[ I'm so sick of people talking about budget in anime. As if that determines the fluidity of an anime. <br><br>I've never seen so many retards who think Japan animation is like a candy machine. Where you put more coins in and you get more candy for yourself to enjoy. That's so bias.<br><br>That's like me saying my post is better than yours because I used for words..<br><br>People let's talk why this term "It was crap cause of the budget" is so popular. It's a scapegoat to bullshit a reason why the show animation sucked.<br><br>Of course budget is a large factor in all animation for obvious reasons but you people make it seem like budget is everything. Which it is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you have autism</br>  check your autism. Sometimes the budget makes or breaks a show. Check Date a Slut Season 2. First one was fluid, and very much agreeable with how it worked. Season two while tolerable, was bad in general. <br><br>Note that while I do agree budgets arent that big a deal, they also are kinda.</br></br>  <br>So in your head a Anime is dependent on budget to be good? Not the person behind your favorite series. Good Animators aren't always the most paid, as well as good animators can be in low-tier studio productions. But you think money is the prime reason an anime is bad? That makes no sense and therefore you have the autism.</br>  <br><br>It's true. KyoAni uses below-average budgets yet consistently makes the anime which looks the most expensive.</br></br>  <br>Do you have the budget stats on-hand? Most of the time whenever that happens it's based around the studio getting other animators to work on other animantor's work. What studio created the show? Are they know for out sourcing their animes and bringing in other people to work on the show. You can't blame budget for everything that goes wrong, that's a fact.<br><br>Budget is a large deal when it comes to anime but the matter is you vastly over-estimate the power of budget and link it to quality of animation. Which simply isn't the case.</br></br></br>  <br>get lucky!</br>  This is true. Notice that Gundam Seed Destiny had a huge budget, but it was horseshit.  Pretty sure the no budget excuse is just an epic maymay. Only a newfag would actually take it at face value. Everyone knows that time constraints are the biggest contributor to QUALITY.  <br> implying bad anime is due to budget  <br> not direction and animation supervision  <br> not music composition or screenwriting </br></br></br>  <br>I can't tell if youre trolling by another very simple explanation or being real, but I choose to agree with that.</br>  Shut up, you buttfor. You don't know what your talking about.  RAGE  <br>You are a really slow one.</br>  [HorribleSubs] Shimoneta - 02 [720p]<br><br>Subs are out</br></br>  <br>Yes and its horrible.

Hell, she looked like she was ready to rape someone when she was chasing down MC.  <br><br>Yeah but think about it:<br><br>If you're a Frenchman working in Japan and you get arrested for watching a movie from your hometown,<br><br>Wouldn't this kind of law in general piss off foreigners who worked in Japan?<br><br>99% of all French TV and movies have sex or some nudity in it. How will French people animating for Satelight survive under this law? I don't want Thomas Romain to get arrested.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  who is the loli with the canvas? i saw somewhere she had a dog collar on MC, is this rare bondage loli being introduced?  Is it just me or do the OP and ED themes sound similar to the OP of Haiyore or is it just common elements of the genre they're using?  <br>That's exactly why he's penetrating his son</br>  <br>I love these.</br>    Have any scanlation groups picked up the manga or the LN yet since the anime's debuted?  <br>Hiryuu's subs are not uncut you idiot.<br><br>The only thing that changes is that the subs are much less cringy than HS releases.</br></br></br>  I wonder if she'll calm down the slut act a bit after a good dicking  <br>I couldn't stop laughing when i saw this part.</br>  <br>so she acts lewd<br>but she's really not that lewd<br>she just does it for FREEDOM so people can be as lewd as they want even though she's not really that lewd herself<br><br>sounds like best girl material to me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His girly voice needs some work</br>  How many LNs are there already? And any of them getting translated soon?  <br> LNs  <br> translated soon <br>Are you new to this?</br></br></br>  <br>To how LNs translation works? Yes, if I'm new at reading them, no I've read quite a few</br>  <br>someone make this without the subs, please</br>  <br>You're either going to wait forever or get a shitty machine/chinese to english translation unless you're waiting for Index or SAO.<br>Then there's Nanodesu, who is good for most of the time, but also really slow.</br></br>  I'm guessing this is also censored?  Is Anna actually Lewd herself?  AOTS period, only Non Non Byori stands a chance.  <br>They should have went with a butthole, even more ambiguous</br>  <br> when they start to fight unironically with terrorist. <br>People going to drop this shit so fucking quick.<br>Is going to be delicious.</br></br></br>  <br>A real man like me<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tx1<wbr>mryKqvT8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>yes, unfortunately. Not sure if there's any uncensored subs out right now</br>  <br>She's a person, people are born lewd.<br>She doesn't understand her own lewdness, or even realize that lewdness is what it is, but I assure you her loins lest like any other.</br></br>  <br>PM's on steroids<br>We all better buy a dog</br></br>  <br>Aren't they doing it unironically already?</br>  <br> show about freedom fighters protesting excessive censorship <br> is excessively censored <br>What a world we live in.</br></br></br>  <br>that sucks man, plus I think none of the volumes are translated yet, the anime might cover 2-4 volumes and adding the time it takes to translate those volumes... will be quite a few years until new content. really sucks, I'd place my hope on the manga but then again... only 2 chapters translated.</br>  <br>If that one picture is any indication, she might be a sniffing pervert.<br>And gorilla is probably gay.</br></br>  <br>Ohys-Raws are AT-X, use the senketsu subs with them and you're set.</br>  I can't wait to find out who has the anal kink.  <br> Funi </br>  <br>At least they're decent enough if you don't want to wait and want to watch it immediatly.</br>  <br>Normally I'd guess the main girl because she was made for it, but a name like "Anna" is just too perfect. The pure, naive, iron-willed seitokaichou has to be the buttqueen.</br>  <br>Reminder, all strong willed girls are weak to anal.</br>   tfw waiting for Hiryuu   <br> 3 seconds <br>How?</br></br>  <br>Apparently 1 in every 200 men is a premature ejaculator.</br>  <br>good taste detected</br>  <br><br>I used to be able to do that when I was young. It's just how fast and horny you are.</br></br>  <br>he dad certainly does belong in jail</br>    <br>They key is to not fap throughout ALL of the several hours, otherwise you may fuck up and bust your nut too early. Pace yourself and cum buckets at the end.</br>  <br>This is what we call "irony".</br>  <br> They key is to not fap throughout ALL of the several hours <br>wow what a casual<br><br>seriously though, why would you stop fapping, can't you control your rhytm</br></br></br></br>  <br> Decent enough <br>You are completely out of your fucking mind if you think it's anything but complete horse shit.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes it just happens. It's not like it's something you plan for, but finishing isn't always easy and time flies.<br><br>It's a pain in the ass, because the chaffing and discomfort start in sometime past the first hour and then the rest of the time is no longer really enjoyable, and finishing becomes more of an arduous endeavor than an enjoyable experience.</br></br></br>  <br>At this point I'm pretty sure that's the joke.</br>  <br><br>If you find that kind of stuff funny then be my guest, I however find that absolutely retarded and anti-climatic.</br></br>  <br><br>full opening before it gets taken down<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dG9<wbr>aRvs59EQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> He's never edge  <br>I once did it for 5 hours, just looking for the source of a picture. My shoulder hurt so bad.</br></br>  <br>Great response.</br>  I could never jerk off in the shower, or at least cum.  <br>I can, but I can have significantly longer sessions if I just intake porn without fapping for periods of 30 seconds or so.</br>  DAMN YOU ABE<br><br>DAMN YOU TO HELL</br></br>  <br>I jerked off at the shower so much, I think I should give soaplands a try.</br>  <br>Too far.</br>  <br>Really? I could never get past the feeling of the hot water hitting my dick, felt uncomfortable.</br>  First it's 'public morals' <br>and then it's conduct<br>then your freedom of speech gets taken away<br>even your actions are restricted<br>what's next then, thoughtcrime?<br><br>what kind of people would be crazy enough to relinquish all their rights and liberties?<br><br>It bothers me that this is actually possible in this world. It just completely dispels my suspension of disbelief because I couldn't imagine people willingly giving away all their freedoms just so a few guys can't jack off at night to nudy pics. <br><br>If it was somehow forced upon the people then I might be able to understand, but for people to support these measures of their own free will?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are living in that world right now, there are people out there that don't want you to masturbate.</br>  <br>Wat?</br>  <br>It's a satire, man, don't take it so seriously.<br><br>In reality, it could still go pretty far though. A LOT of porn is outright illegal or censored now, and many parents/liberals are terrified of anything remotely sexual. Even innocent nudity is banned in many contexts.</br></br></br>  <br>YOUR RIGHTS END WHERE YOUR PENIS BEGINS</br>  <br>Remember if you want anything banned just either say it's to protect the children or stop terrorism.<br>Nothing can stop you.</br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>Can I bullshit them hard enough and say censorship harms children in some way and get away with it?</br>  <br>You just admitted you're a child molester. Good job.</br>  <br>No, because that way it makes you sound like you want children to have sex.<br>Good job losing all credibility and fucking up your life.</br></br>  <br>Outbullshitting people is the essence of life. Go for it.</br>  <br>Freedom of speech, liberty, and the common man having any value or say whatsoever are new ideas the west forced on Japan after dismantling their country, culture, regime and entire sociopolitical powerstructure by force some 70 years ago. The generation who laboured as serfs to an imperialist military dictatorship bent on genocide and manifest destiny still exist today, and their children are the ones that rebuilt that country and govern over it today.<br><br>This whole 'having a say' thing is still a new concept to their government. Hell, even in the west where concepts like freedom of speech and "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are ingrained so deeply into your nationalist character, you have frumpy housewives spearheading movements and lobbying politicians at every scale of government to ban X, legislate Y and stop Z because they don't like that you like what they don't like.<br><br>Ignorant people on a moral highhorse trying to take away the things you take for granted under the auspices of 'common decency' or 'intuitive morality' are commonplace everywhere, and asian cultures have far fewer lines of defense preventing those people from getting their way.</br></br></br></br></br>  So are the novels beyond the 4th available anywhere? Do I actually have to buy them? Did nobody care about this before it got an anime that they didn't even bother uploading the newer stuff? That's like 5 novels missing.  <br>You feel uncomfortable when warm water touches your dick?</br>  <br>Yeah, I do, It also doesn't feel that great for my dick to be pelted constantly with water.</br>  <br>Water makes for a horrible lube, and a wet dick is not a happy dick. It just gets clammy and uncomfortable and the sensations all feel more distance and less satisfying.<br><br>Plus pruning; fuck pruning.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a sad sad world we live in, when we willingly give up those things that good, honorable men gave their lives to protect.</br>  <br>I'm a dry fap too, but how can you dick feel uncomfortable by warm water?<br>Do people not like warm baths too?</br></br>  <br>Using spit is a better lube than warm water.</br>  Just jerk off in the shower but not directly under the shower. That way you have no lubrication problems, you still get the warmth all around you and the privacy.  <br>I can barely reach an orgasm under the shower</br>  <br>I don't fap in the shower much ever, and I hardly use lube, I said I'm a dry fap.<br>I'm not talking about fapping in warm water, I'm talking about warm water on the dick in general.</br></br>  <br>The water will eventually find it's way to my hand, then my dick, thus making it awful.<br>I would recommend doing something with your asshole, rather than your dick.</br></br>  This ain't anime, guys!  <br><br>maybe its a standing up problem.<br>I fap best, and 98% of the time laying down.</br></br></br>  <br> no anime about autistic, weeaboo manchildren masturbatory habits <br>It's a real shame. Lots of fertile ground there for a show.</br></br>  <br>I think so, I almost instantly stop being hard once I stand up</br>  <br>I can't wait to see some 200 KG fatass masturbate while playing with his ass!</br>  <br>Standing up and jerking off is also a weird feeling, maybe I just need to put some muscle in my legs, but they always get weak after cumming.</br>  <br> I almost instantly stop being hard once I stand up <br>I'd recommend having your blood pressure checked</br></br>  <br>I also get headaches when standing up, so yeah, I might</br>  <br>Yeah that's something you ought to see your family doctor about, or at least drop by a walk-in clinic. It'll take them 5 minutes to tell you it's either nothing to worry about or something that needs a specialist and some more testing.<br><br>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</br></br></br>  <br>I can do it if I fap furiously and cum within 10 minutes. I prefer to read my vanilla doujins in bed though which takes a few hours.</br>  <br>Vanilla? What the fuck.<br>Please spoiler your posts next time.</br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>Isn't it past your bedtime, Ana?</br></br>  <br>95% of the time for me is standing up and I never have any problems with my legs, not even the slightest feeling in them.</br>  <br>Anna best girl</br>  <br><br><br>You have shitty bloodflow.

Commie, pls.  dey rnt noiz  <br>Tsubasa better be running around naked for a bit next episode.</br>  <br>The blame for that rests solely on the writers this time.</br>  Sasuga, best character song.<br><br> What do you think of the character songs this season? The only one I like really is Tsubasa's </br></br>  <br>I don't speak fluent nip so I can't comment, but surely the line wasn't that homo charged in actuality, was it? I imagine it was something like "Me and Tsubasa are going to have our way" - as in we're going to do what we want with this car and you guys can't stop us.</br>   yfw Bikki forced to draw Dansleif <br> kills a doll <br> doll doesn't count because not technically alive, therefore not technically killed <br> bikki going to die because of dansleif <br>   genjuuro throws himself on the sword to spare bikki <br>   yfw episode 7 <br><br><br>I too like Tsubasa's the best so far, which is interesting since I typically like hers the least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I seem to be in the minority here, but  I love Chris's so far even though we can hardly hear it at all. Initially I didn't like Tsubasa's, but I want to give it a few more listens first .</br>  <br>I think it's hard to tell. The audio mixing has been pretty shit this season. The music volume is so low you can barely hear it.</br>  <br>Serves you right!</br>  Why is Maria such a titty monster?  <br><br><br>Yeah this seasons audio mixing wasn't quite as hype as it was in S2 or even S1. Part of it having to do with them getting their asses handed to them, just doesn't feel as hype when they're getting manhandled while singing their hotblooded musics</br></br></br>  <br>I've grown a lot warmer on Hibiki's song. I still don't think its quite as good as HIBIKE HIBIKE HAATO YO but then again it's really really hard to be.</br>  <br>There's already been at least two comics playing with it, so the innendo is there in Japanese even if it wasn't intended.</br>   gears get destroyed by nigger noise <br> half the show is filler and them not fighting anything <br><br>I'm getting scared just thinking about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I never noticed she was such a titty monster before. Were they upgraded or something?<br><br>We HSOTD now</br></br></br>  <br> half the show is cute SoL episodes <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br>B96.<br><br>There's just be a lot of focus on the boobs this time around.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they were talking about the car. According to the last thread, she's saying that she'll do what she wants with Tsubasa. That's just the japanese expression for it. Technically correct line if that's the case.</br>  <br>power suits are not /m/; get this moeshit back to /a/ faggot</br>  <br>It might get even worse later on given what we know from them though, but seeing them grab the upper hand again might make up for it.<br><br><br>More SoL is always good though, especially given that G went a little too far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Their taxi got sliced in half, but on the plus side, it looks like they didn't spend too much on it.</br>  <br>She literally says she's going to do whatever she wants with Tsubasa.</br>  Can't hear the songs because of too much  noise : the episode  <br>You fucked up nerd</br>  <br>On twitter Carol's VA said things are only going to get crazier from here.</br>   Useless   <br>I like G-Beat a bit more, I think it might be my favorite Hibiki song, I just love how they repeat G-Beat one an another time.</br>      Copypaste from /m/<br><br>The Concert Tragedy and the Tachibana Family:<br> Thoughtless slander was thrown around, supported by the majority as having "sound reasoning," not because they had deduced this themselves but rather "because everyone else was saying so." At this point the true nature of the tragedy was lost and had turned into something akin to a witch hunt from the middle ages, or the barbaric persecution of Nazis, fueled by some warped sense of "justice." <br><br> turned into something akin to a witch hunt from the middle ages <br> fueled by some warped sense of "justice." <br><br>And Kaneko had said GX is another side of G.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What was up with that? They just posed and didn't even throw an attack. Only made way for Hibiki.</br>  <br>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh &lt;3</br>  <br>Same keyword<br> The darkness in people's hearts, born of a mutual misunderstanding. Having been exposed to this darkness more than most, Hibiki is still capable of believing in others. Surely this is because she knows that in the space between 2 people, there exists sunlight. <br><br>And Exterminate is about "exterminating the darkness in your heart."</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki moe in S1 <br> Chris moe in S2 <br> Tsubasa moe in S3 <br><br>OH GOD MY HEART</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's that little text on the lower left that's untranslated?<br><br><br> Stop that. </br></br></br></br>  <br>They were the cutest in the OP, nothing else matters.</br>  <br>Now that Chris and Tsubasa had their Symphogears destroyed they might play an important role. They probably won't though.</br>  <br> Surely this is because she knows that in the space between 2 people, there exists sunlight. <br>So there's a Miku between every one of us?  Dammit Kaneko, your metaphors are overlapping. </br></br>  <br>Considering Blue wasn't in the castle with Carol, I'd wager she's either going for them or Miku+bakas.</br>  Shirabe arc soon. I hope.  <br>Yeah, Tusbasa's is the best. The others' aren't bad, but they aren't half as good as G's.</br>  Matching  <br>Guess this will be all about Carol and Hibiki finding their own justice amongst their twisted pasts.</br>  <br>Ha, yeah I'm surprised it wasn't brought up in the last thread.</br>  <br>It would be damn nice if they both got some time in the spotlight.  I'm not looking forward to them singing prematurely without LiNKER and suffering horribly as a result though. </br>  <br>By the end maybe they'll swap places. Hibiki goes nuts and tries to tear the world down and Carol works with the geahs to stop her.</br>  <br>They'll force themselves to battle even while low on drugs since Tsubasa and Chris have damaged relics and Maria's is broken from the start. Can't leave Hibiki alone who's having a breakdown and refusing to fight after all.</br>  <br>Airgetlam obviously gets repaired. Now that more Gears are broke, more repairs.</br>  <br>Sure, but repairs take time. They wouldn't just remove a fundamental battle asset from them as a cliffhanger only to give them back said asset right at the next episode. No, they'd surely never do something like that. That would be insane.</br>  <br>This show is insane. They suplex spaceships.</br>  <br>If that means Maria (and Hibiki too, I guess) getting to save the day and be heroes, bring it on</br>  <br>I really hope they don't do this again.</br>  Can Rorona beat up Carol in a fist fight?<br><br> Atelier Carol when? </br></br>  <br>Don't forget they also surfed missiles and punched mountains just before the spaceship suplex, and all in less than five minutes.</br>  S1 <br> I don't want you to hide anything from me <br> Okay, I'm not hiding anything except this terrible state secret and will continue acting suspicious like a husband having an affair <br>G<br> I don't want you to fight <br> Thank you but I'm gonna fight anyway <br>GX<br> Okay, go and come back safely <br> Sorry, I was being a retard and got BTFO <br>Why does Hibiki just keep shitting on Miku's feelings like that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why was Hibiki so useless this episode?  <br>Adventurer Rorona probably could.  I'm still pissed that ending isn't canon. Fuck that "true ending" bullcrap. </br>  <br>Because Hibiki is trying to pray away the gay but Miku won't let her.</br>  <br>Obligatory MC moralfaggotry</br>  <br>Being Miku is eternal suffering</br>  <br>Hibiki is weak to lolis. Remember how soundly Shirabe was able to verbally thrash her.</br>   There won't be a gungnir datto   <br>Just wait for  zombie Kanade .</br>  Who reacts this way to loli legs?  <br>Since when biki can survive explosions without gear?</br>  <br>Since she started eating, watching movies, and sleeping.</br>  <br>Her clothes barely got messed up.</br>  Can't wait to see Maria's face when Shirabe/Kirika join the battle without LiNKER and spill JAM all over the place.  <br> There won't be an ANIME JA NAI </br>  <br>Carol is the little yappy dog who barks a lot but is pretty ineffective on her own.</br>  <br>That whole scene was pretty ridiculous. And it had a cliffhanger building up to it.</br>  I can tell that Maria is going to be badass and useful this season.  <br>It's kind of bullshit. She blew a massive crater into the ground and Hibiki came out of it mostly unscathed.</br>  <br>Serena please.</br>  <br>Biki was only missing Yamcha pose there.</br>  <br>That's how magic works.</br>  <br>Objectively speaking, Miku'd be much more happier if she just leaves Hibiki and goes her own way. All Hibiki ever did is selfishly taking advantages of her kindness.</br>  <br>Useful for breeding.</br>  <br>Actually that one is guaranteed since that's her line in the character introduction page on the official site.</br>  Is there a pastebin or something for all the character songs from S1 and G?  <br>Ver pls</br>  <br>I'd laugh if they actually use her as bait for Ver since they need LiNKER.</br>  <br>Carol wasn't trying to kill her. She needed Hibiki to put her gear on.</br>  <br>Miku probably blames herself for what happened to Hibiki since she sent her to the concert alone.</br>  <br>Shouldn't they have better sync rates because of Xdrive, anyway?</br>  <br>what the fuck is on kirikas butt?</br>  <br> explosives <br>Carol is out to destroy the gears themselves, so she wouldn't kill Hibiki without having destroyed that first.<br><br><br>They're on Nyaa or Jpopsuki, or other places. There's no reason for links to be put into a Pastebin.</br></br></br></br></br>  Garie best doll  Miku needs to join enemy once again so she can get that kissing skill and use it on Hibiki.  <br>Setting aside the fact that you're a dumbass for not paying attention to what board you were on, doesn't that logic mean toku isn't /m/ either?</br>  <br>Chuuni fashion</br>  <br>Using that harmless excavation alchemy.<br><br>In all seriousness, it was earth element, check the symbol in the OP. She just ripped the ground up and threw Hibiki up into the air. Which you'd expect to be really dangerous but maybe not so much as an actual explosion.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't they the first druggies who went X-drive? The others are all natural right?</br>  <br>That would be interesting. Nana did say that  Exterminate  was the song that would destroy the world. So the OP with all the geahs jumping to fight Carol always be a bait-in-switch with them fighting Hibiki in the actual finale to get her out of a funk (with that playing in the background naturally),<br><br> Or we get a Jojo-esque world reset ending with a new reincarnated cast of characters to replace the gears of the first world. </br></br></br>  <br>Garie is trash.</br>  <br>Wouldn't killing Hibiki get rid of her Gear too?</br>  <br>Clearly someone on the staff wants doujins where Kirika has a buttplug tail.</br>  <br>Fine really beat the shit out of her while she wasn't wearing her gear in S1E12.</br>  <br>Best trash.</br>  <br>It almost looks like she peed herself.</br>  <br>Killing Hibiki would be killing a person able to use the gear, not the gear itself.<br><br><br>FIS were first XDrives besides the 3 main girls, yeah. I would assume that going XDrive would ensure that they were compatible without having to resort to Linker, and nobody knows this just because they weren't legally allowed to use their gears.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems like it doesn't count unless the relic is activated. She wouldn't demand Hibiki transform otherwise.</br>  <br>She had the excuse of being a Relic hybrid to take that pounding.</br>  <br>Let's... not get carried away</br>    <br> The only one I like really is Tsubasa's <br><br>G-Beat is the most hyped battle song to date.</br></br></br>  <br>Radiant Force being the best song so far aside, Hibiki's is great, Chris' is good, and Tsubasa' is  shit </br>  <br> My dick </br>  <br><br>I guess some people need reminding<br><br>BEST DOLL POWERANKING<br><br>Blue &gt; POWERGAP &gt; Red &gt; Green &gt; POWERGAP &gt; Yellow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just fondling breasts  <br>Dolls are shit.

Don't let your voice die down.</br></br></br>  <br>she would hang around him more often while 8man struggles to remember her name so he just calls her SAA-CHAN.<br>ensue maximum jelousy from other grills.</br></br>  <br>She would've already be the winrar, she would've never lost so much damn time like double YY and Iroha. Bunch of gutless babies, all of 'em.</br>  <br> Yukino will never sit on your face <br>Let's just say you didn't go on after that, all right?</br></br>  Now that's alpha.<br><br> Will they reach the fairytale ending? </br></br>  <br>Is that Chitoge?</br>  <br>You mean the HayaxHachi end? Of course.</br>  <br>that is kei.chan kawasaki imouto</br>  <br> implying she didn't tease him until he broke down and had his way with her. </br>  <br><br>So genuine would wreck her panties too?<br><br><br>Someone was going to do it eventually, it just happened to be Iroha who did it. I hate to blame the victim but if he went around trying to genuine like that what did he expect would happen?</br></br></br></br></br>  What are these faces trying to convey?   11/10 intelligent and gorgeous girl <br> super cute, sweet girl with a good body <br> both love him to death <br> they are friends so no one relationships will suffer by picking <br> still doesn't pick <br>Why won't he pick?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he refused to believe one could actually like him while he has no idea the other has feelings for him.</br>  <br>Because his fate is already sealed. Are you all ready for this?</br>  <br>I didn't know Fei watched this anime.</br>  <br><br>Haruno's plans have long since been set in motion. At this point, resistance is utterly futile. Yukino may as well prepare herself to be 8man's sister-in-law.</br></br>  <br>She likes all the girls and has a boner for Hachiman. Doujin is likely.</br>  <br>I see you have seen the light as well, my brother.</br>  when can we jump off this  <br>She does pretty enjoyable works but she is terrible with doujinshi because she has a style and is unable to deviate from it, so all the girls look off model.</br>  <br>How fast would Yukino an hero if she lost 8man to Haruno? That would probably mind fuck her worse than anything.</br>  <br> no doujins yet </br>  Why be genuine when you can be  bona fide?   I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?  <br>There's nothing to support this wild thesis.</br>  <br>Is it really so hard to believe that good looking girls that interact with him often may actually like him?</br>  <br>With Yui it's because of the whole nice girls thing but he's over that now.<br>With Yukino, to him her feelings are ambiguous as hell, he probably still thinks they aren't friends, but they treasure their relationship yet they have no idea what exactly to make of it. As far as it goes with Yukino, he has no idea what's going on.</br></br>  <br>Her sameface is so bad it makes it hard to tell who is who.</br>  <br>At least these keep things going.</br>  <br>I don't get what is so bait worthy about that post.</br>  <br><br>Well, I'm not saying he DESERVED to be raped, but... He kinda did, you know?</br></br>  <br>For me it is :^) I assume that it's not a stretch for him to think that too.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>I want to saki Saki's sakis</br>  So is there any particular reason for the naming of characters? I never read anything about it.<br><br>Just for shits and giggles? You know, the whole repetition in the first and last name, like Kawasaki Saki, Yuigama Yui, etc. Not sure why some main characters don't have names like that. Just random?</br></br>  <br> still doesn't pick <br><br>He did. And it was like 6-5 vol ago.</br></br></br>  <br> 渡航 </br>  <br>I want to be her little brother.</br>  Was it rape?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> &gt;they are friends so no one relationships will suffer by picking <br>Why do people keep saying this? 100% normal, adjusted people would be really hurt if they were in the loser girl's position much less Yui and Yukino. I expect them to hurt but overcome it and mend their relationship.</br></br>    I want to yuki Yukino's yukis    Why not both? 8man should make the right decision.  <br><br>Well yeah, I saw his name. But I refused to believe that was the reason. I thought I was missing something.</br></br>  <br>I love that shit, I wish more used it. Water colors? Or whatever it is.</br>  <br>No, she wasn't. <br>She is merely in love with the imaginary white knight who can save her from her "problems", first it was Hayama now it is 8man. <br><br>She will realize it and fall out of love after 8man told her to go fix her own shit in the last scene of volume 11.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the right one is the right choice.</br>    <br>Yep. Choosing Yui, it wouldn't be as bad, if he fucked Haruno on the side.<br>Unless Yukino gets butthurt he's fucking everyone except her.</br></br>  <br><br>Last names are places in Chiba. First names you can already figure out.</br></br>  <br><br>I would marry a girl like saki without even blinking.<br><br>She is a great cook, great at sewing and general housewifeing. Despite this she is not afraid of working and will do in order not to be a burden to her loved ones. She is also great with children.<br><br>Oh, btw, did i also mention her body is built for hadcore breeding?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>8man should get on it. Too bad she doesn't like him romantically.</br>  Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1. Yui<br>  + She is the only girl known in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3.

Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her, she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He chose both. It just that Yui had the romance privilege while Yukino had a platonician treatment.</br>  <br><br>What about prostate apostate Totsuka?</br></br>  <br>8man was making fun of her for not knowing what CPR means. Then Yui responded that she knows it then proceed to prove it.</br>  <br> &gt; - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>What? She said the opposite.</br></br>  <br>as much as you want her to be a girl, she is a boy</br>  <br>  - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>No, she said girls placing importance on not being a virgin is dumb, Yui said it was embarrassing to be a virgin while Yukino said its perfectly fine to be so.</br></br>  Isn't april fools coming up in the LN? 8man should confess to both Yui and Yukino and tell them april fools the next day. <br><br>Or better yet he should get Iroha in on a joke and tell them he is going out with her. They will be holding hands with Iroha as he tells them.</br></br>  <br><br>Is this better?<br><br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and virginity in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she simply doesn't care when people bring up sex.<br>The first time they talk about the contest she outright says she's afraid Hachiman will take her virginity.<br><br>She's proud when she spike because she still is a virgin, she says there is no shame in being one and that placing any importance on losing it is stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, she simply doesn't care when people bring up sex. <br>Really? What if 8man started bringing it up and talking about it?</br></br>  <br>Most likely call him an creepy perverted stalker like always, but as she is now she'd probably do that plus look away rather than look directly at him.</br>  <br><br>She'd parrot him of course. after getting herself a true ahoge.</br></br>  <br> heartboner.jpg </br>    <br> after getting herself a true ahoge. <br>She already has one it just collapsed under its own weight.</br></br>  <br>So when is Yui going to lose it and pounce on him and grind a year worth of sexual frustration into him?</br>  Brothers? <br><br> How's the ship, guys? </br></br>  <br>Who? What ship?</br>  <br>This seems like an awful lot of effort just to say that you hate Yukino.</br>  <br>Thoughts of this make me hard.</br>  Does 8man even realize he feels jealousy?<br>All he ever describes are feelings of pain and disgust inside of him.</br>  <br>She looks so cute in S2.</br>  <br><br>Yukimom and Haruno don't have ahoges.<br>Early LN art of Yukino doesn't have an ahoge.<br>Feels version of Yukino has a more prominent ahoge than BB's.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Because she's beautiful with gap moe of her delinquent demeanour opposite to her diligent family oriented personality.

She can't be kissing him, she likes cookie man remember</br>  <br>If she likes cookie man then why did she give her cookies to 8man?</br>  <br>Those were gratitude cookies.</br>  <br>Oh, okay. Glad you cleared that up because that was bugging me for a while.</br>  <br>She was just practicing on 8man<br>You can never be too careful</br></br>  <br>Well it's a good thing 8man thinks of her only as a friend or else he'd think Yui had feelings for him.</br>  <br>Well, Yukino had Hayama to teach her beforehand so..</br>  <br>You could see Yuki starting to have girl feelings for 8man in the OVA when she blushed at the end of the episode in response to Yui saying that Yukino looked at Hachiman</br>  <br>When is she going to try and have practice sex with 8man for Cookie Man's sake?</br>  <br> thinking Hayama's "Y" girl is Yukino <br>It's obviously Yui</br></br>  <br>Now.</br>  <br>The point. You missed it.</br>  <br> Yui rejected by 8man <br> Miura rejected by Hayama <br> They only have eachother now </br></br></br>  Farewell Oregairu.  <br>Bodyswap doujin confirms Hayama likes Yui and Yukino likes Miura.</br>  <br> 8man practices lewd stuff with Iroha for Hayama's sake <br> 8man practices lewd stuff with Yui for Cookie Man's sake <br> no one actually wants to do lewd stuff with him for his sake <br>Being 8man is suffering</br></br></br></br>  <br> no one </br>  <br>Yukino only wants to do lewd things to Pan-san.</br>  <br>8man is her Pan-san.</br>  <br>She'll scream Pan-san's name during sex with 8man. 8man is only a substitute for her true love.</br>  <br>no problem</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/831908/a8a5ae<wbr>621d<br><br>Is this about 8man cheating on Yui or something?</br></br></wbr>   Yukino's feelings for 8man are associated with pan-san <br> pan-san is a childish character, and her obsession with him is a childish trait <br> the implication is Yukino's feelings are childish in nature <br><br>It's basically the reverse of Kirino's siscon/brocon obsession if you think about it. Yukino's feelings are not actual romantic love, nor are they sexual desire.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this is some next level straw grasping</br>  <br>The "Dizney" version of Pan-san is childish, the actual reason she likes Pan-san is because she read the original story which she said one can feel the overriding message of love the author had for his son at every level.</br>    <br>any gooks around to translate?</br>  <br> anything I disagree with is straw grasping </br>  <br>I think the story is this:<br>Yui and 8man get intimate during club time for Yukino's amusement<br>This hurt her girl feelings<br>Yui and 8man continue to have an intimate relationship<br>8man finds Yukino who is upset over waht happened<br>They make love<br>8man feels like shit for playing around with them<br><br>I don't know any gook.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you retarded?</br>  <br>And Kirino claimed to like imoutoge for the plot, if I'm not mistaken.<br><br>No matter how you look at it the rotten eyes link is pretty shallow in nature, and she felt strongly enough about that particular attribute she was going to go after Miura over it.<br><br><br>Quality post.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't answer my question</br>  <br>That's right.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>8man should come dressed in that and confess to Yukino as a joke. It would be funny to watch her reject Pan-san.</br>  <br>If 8man doesn't want to go out with Yukino then why doesn't he confess to her in a Pan-san suit, give her a warm smile as she is lost for words, and whisper sweet nothing into her ear while she is teary eyed. She will accept, maybe they share a kiss. She will go home happy, go to sleep happy, and wake up happy. Then the day next he pretends none of it happened. That would send her the message that it isn't going to happen and that she should give up.<br><br>As a Yukinofag I would love to see her happy for a bit.</br></br></br>   Yukino is thematically linked to snow/winter <br> Snow inevitably melts/winter inevitably leaves and returns periodically <br> The theme of this arc, as well as it's chronological timing, is snow melting in spring <br><br>Yukino's leaving soon, guys. It isn't actually thematically accurate for it to just be "ice queen melting" because winter always returns, so transfer/abroad news next volume is extremely likely.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8man confessing to Yukino in a bear suit would be a death flag to their relationship, if TRDR is anything to go by.</br>  <br>We all know shes going to study abroad and leave Hachiman and Yui<br><br>Theres a reason why Watari put her in International Class J</br></br></br>  <br>Okay okay okay, I got it this time. What if 8man writes a love letter to Yukino explaining his deep love for Pan-san and that she shouldn't confess to Pan-san. It also says that she should keep Pan-san on the down low and to not bring him up until he says so.<br><br>There, a completely neutered Yukino that won't pursue or confess to Pan-san. Hopefully it turns her off Pan-san completely. <br><br>If she brings it up he will feign ignorance and if she pushes it he says that Pan-san isn't real and that it is probably a prank.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The question now is will 8man wait for her, follow her, or accept that he is not the one who will understand her.</br>  <br>Yuifags everyone.<br>Using edited copypasta and falseflagging this hard.<br>Pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice bait, falsefagging Irohafag</br>  <br>He is not going to follow Yukino abroad<br><br>He will wait for her, it just depends on whether it is in the form of a friendship or something else (potential romance when she gets back)<br><br>In any case, Yuki going abroad regardless of end also deals with 8man's beliefs that you cannot maintain relationships with people as you grow older, that they reset when you go from middle to high, high school to college, etc.<br><br>Its 100% possible to maintain something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hayato x Yukino end confirmed  <br> Yukino leaves to study abroad <br> next few volumes focus on 8man and Yui <br> 8man visits Yukino to convince her to return <br>   OreImo end </br></br></br></br>  <br> Tee hee! </br>  YukinoSHITfags GO BACK TO MAL<br>GTFO</br>  Hachiman loves Yui  <br>I don't have 6.5, what was the scene?</br>  <br>Ishitkifags GO BACK TO REDDIT<br>GTFO</br></br>  1/7  <br>Too bad she only loves Cookie Man.</br>  <br>2/7</br>  <br> implying I am Irohafags <br>I AM A PROUD YUIFAG<br>YOU GTFOOOOO</br></br></br>  Falseflaggers pls GTFO  <br>3/7</br>  <br>Yuragayhomofags GO BACK TO  NONEXISTENCE <br>GTFO</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit,<br>why is Yukino such a bitch?</br></br></br>  <br>4/7<br><br><br> she's just misunderstood, anon </br></br></br></br>  I'm pretty sure it's just one false flaggot trying to cause waifu wars<br>Ignore him and he'll go away</br>     I knew that....somewhat.. <br> There's now way he was going to choose me over her.. <br> I am not beautiful as her, not intelligent as her.. <br> Of course he was going to reject me.. <br> Seeing them made me think that they were made for each other... <br> I felt happy for her.. <br> But she stole from me what I cherished the most... <br> Why does my heart ache so much? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>6/7</br>  <br>7/7</br>  <br>Please  write some more. </br>  <br>God I hate Yukinoshit so much<br>is she allergic to fun or what</br></br>  Only genuine shippers can see what's hidden in the spoiler.<br>If you can't see it, you are not genuine.</br>  <br>You're retarded<br><br>Some people want their personal space intact</br></br></br>  <br>Do not trust this man, he's not  the real thing </br>   you will never watch Yui masturbate while crying while she is listening to her Hikki pounding Yukinon's wet, pink pussy   <br>Are you a genuine enough dude to see this spoiler?</br>  <br> implying Yukino isn't frigid </br>  <br>She is autistic,<br>go easy on her.</br></br>  <br>I imagine Yukino would be pretty quiet when taking the 8inch, but she wouldn't be able to stop the geyser from her cunt.</br>  <br>Yui will always be more beautiful to me.</br>    <br>I wonder if this one made it into the diary.</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127924<wbr>336/#127924336</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> KD deck in anki </br>  <br>Yes, you are fucked if you won't take it easier.

A SHIT.</br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Last thread was kinda too heated, so I waited until this new thread. So, today has a pair theme with the following pairs being the attention: Mushiban &amp; Sirloin  (what the hell is this kind of name?) , Momozono Love &amp; Aono Miki, Kenzaki Makoto &amp; Davi, Tsumugi &amp; Zeke, Pafu &amp; Aroma.<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-11?<wbr>lang=en<br>http://togetter.com/li/846033?lang=<wbr>en</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erika wasn't very interesting asides being comedy relief.</br>  <br>We are literally getting a Kirara + Towa arc just now. I'm not sure what more else you fucks could want. Be grateful because had this been another series none of the girls but Haruka would have interacted with Towa in any meaningful way.<br><br>At this point I'm still amazed people bitch and complain about muh screentime and muh relevancy for non-pinks after 3 fucking years of Precure being PINK, PINK, PINK.<br><br>Maybe things will change next year now that that chucklefuck of Shibata will probably finally be gone but just in-case mentally condition yourself to pre-emptively like next year Pink the most. You'll get all your screentime and relevancy that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but it means that it will have the classic archetypes that little girls like, there are literally no cure that isn't an achetype, the important is the execution.<br><br><br>That is your opinion.<br>Personally I never liked the genky archetype and I love the silent introvert girl archetype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arc </br>  <br>Yes, arc. If you had bothered to read the spoilers you'd see it's like 3 episodes of nothing but Kirara + Towa.</br>   the redemption of kid with huge chin <br>how</br>  <br>Kirara and Towa are roommates. With Towa being the second most important Gopri Cure after Haruka that means Kirara is sure to gain more relevance than she currently has.</br>  <br>I love how she chases after her childish dream wholeheartedly, and puts in the effort necessary. Unlike what people guessed at the beginning, she doesn't keep jumping from thing to thing, and is focusing on mainly violin and ballet, not tennis or tea pouring or whatever. I like how much she values her bond with Kanata, and how last episode when she wanted to save Towa, it wasn't because of some sense of justice or wanting to fight against Dyspear, it was simply because she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata. I like her antics and clumsiness, and how she doesn't immediately win everyone over. Does she share traits with past pink cures? Of course, that's why she's the leader, but it's her specific personality and combination that makes her Haruno Haruka.</br>  <br> she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata.  <br>I liked this part too.</br></br>  <br><br>Even the Crimson Chin admitted his wrongdoings.</br></br>  Favorite silly Precure fanart? I really like this one, the way the skin is drawn looks very soft and smooth. Like a marshmallow.  <br>What? Smile gave good screentime to Miyuki, Yayoi and Akane; only Nao and Reika got shafted. Only DD and HaCha's second half were PINK PINK PINK.</br>    Fresh: KANPEKI and Animal Girl get shafted<br>Hearcatch: Itsuki gets shafted after Moonlight joins<br>Suite: Kanade gets shafted<br>Smile: Nao and Reika get shafted<br>DD: There are characters not named Mana?<br>HaCha: Everyone but Hime gets shafted in the first half, everyone but Gumi gets shafted in the second half</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like this one.</br>  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>This.<br>What makes Haruno good isn't her super original archetype, but the way she has been handled.</br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>This is completely unrealistic</br>    <br>Oh wait, I missed the word "silly". If so, this one.</br>  I know an easy way for a young girl like Towa to earn some money...guehuehue.    <br>Which shafted Cure hurts you the most?</br>  <br>I was about to get mad thinking you thought her suffering was silly, but then I saw you posted , which is cute.<br><br> Peace signs <br>Can't stop associating it with hentai, though the art is high quality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>White.</br>    Some nice one-draws today.      <br>Nao and Reika.<br><br>I'm still mad about no NaoRei episode. God, I fucking hate Yonemura so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Rikka and Minami.</br>  <br>Hime.</br>  <br> Hime <br> shafted </br></br>    <br>I want to impregnate Reika.</br>  <br>We all want.</br>  Reika is top gang bang material.    I want to save Reika from neethood.  Daily Minamin!!  If you had the skills to draw any precure art you wanted what would you draw?  <br>porn</br>  <br>Yayoi doing yayoi things.</br>  <br>Iona as the aunt to me and Maria's kids. That or me married to an adult Rikka/Towa/Iona.</br>  <br><br>Tons of futa porn.  Including futa-on-male. </br></br>  <br> vanilla  porn</br>  <br>A good wallpaper of Precure Rainbow Rose Explotion, since it is imposible to find one.</br>  <br>Cute girls doing cute things, like this. I love this artist and his Cure cats so much.</br>          <br> This late already <br>Fuck</br></br>    <br>On-time Bukki is best Bukki!</br>  I haven't watched this since episode 12. Did they handle the bad guy switching sides thing better than in Fresh?    <br> everyone makes a big fucking deal about Kayano <br> after she starts going to school nobody really gives a shit </br></br>  <br>What makes this way more bearable than HaCha's/Ace's make up?</br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>I wouldn't say better than Fresh. But not a terrible blunder either. Interestingly enough she seems to be the Yellow's companion rather than the Pink's.</br>  <br>She's a toppu moderu.</br>       female muscle <br> brown <br> femdom <br> oneesan/ss <br> tall girl <br> oppai </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go on</br>  <br>I'm going to find this.

But the story is very interesting and is full of character development and a big twist at the end.<br><br>Just my two cents anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck you faggot, you have shit taste.</br>  <br>It's against the rules, faggot.</br>  <br>This thread's existence required the deletion of a different thread.<br><br>Find anime yourself, it's not hard.</br></br></br>  meanwhile on /b/<br><br> "has anyone been to /a/? They're so mean!" </br></br>  <br>I'm not even OP. You seem pretty buttflustered.</br>  <br>So your funny meta shitposts are about how /r/ should be split because people use it for porn and mommy can't find porn in your browser history? Why don't you shitpost about that somewhere else instead of "NOOOOOO /a/ BAD!!!!!"</br>  <br>Good.

The law shouldn't ban drawings, only photographs.</br></br></br>  <br>Your opinion is OK and I respect it.</br>  <br> shutting down a decentralized network <br>They would if they could, anon. The FBI director has been crying about how encryption is evil for years now. Just the other day he said in an interview that encrypted phone apps were helping terrorists.</br></br>  <br> Of an actual human being <br>Seems pretty clear cut to me.<br><br>Animu lolis are too stylized to really be considered actual human beings. It's very clear they aren't real. I think we're fine there for now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Psychology studies say fuck you.</br>  <br>But anon, she's X hundred years old</br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  <br>No reason to not think it is true.</br>  <br>Gon really is cute and sweet though</br>  <br>If we don't can we officially pronounce it dead?</br>  <br>Sweet? Selfish more like.</br>  <br>They'll stop watching a few episodes in. <br><br>"Really, an ant that takes on the properties of its prey? Really, now it's eating humans and producing super human ants? Oh, the ants retain the memories of the humans they're based on? Wait, now we're supposed to feel sympathetic toward this specific ant because he can't save his queen, even though he slaughtered countless innocent humans for said queen? Is this a fucking joke?"<br><br>Of course, they'll miss the part where it gets good, which is soon after the King's birth, but that's the price Togashi paid for starting out an arc with bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  I watched the first episode and liked it, is manga good? Is the romance progressing satisfactorily? I don't want to be addicted to another never-ending nisekoi    <br>This is where it should have ended.</br>  Holy shit this manga is comedy gold. I haven't laughed this much in a while.  <br>Everything lasts too long around here.</br>  <br>link?</br>  Episode 2 just aired.<br><br>Vegeta is still tsun.<br><br>Beerus remembers what Super Saiyan God is.<br><br>Gregory is now canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> no my feet hurt </br></br>  <br><br>his inferiority complex</br></br>  God dammit, this is what I always wanted.
