[ Was it autism?<br><br>Also, did they just undo the "Vegeta accepts Kakarots strength" plotline for like the third time?<br><br>Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? Fucking hell Toei.<br><br>Dragonball Super 002</br></br></br></br></br></br>  just because Goku is stronger doesn't mean he won't want to overcome that.<br><br>Saiyan's be all about overcoming obstacles.</br></br>  <br> Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? Fucking hell Toei. <br>you didnt expect anything better did you?<br><br>They animated the snake fight in episode 1</br></br></br></br>   Your face when that Caveman creature was probably stronger than Freiza   How is [inert]'s release    Is it true the manga is monthly?    <br>comprehendible mostly</br>  I don't think Vegeta was accepting that Goku was stronger than him during the Kid Buu fight. He was more realizing why Goku was strong.  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Damn then the show will surely surpass it quickly</br>  <br>Like he finally realized why Goku is far stronger than him, but that doesn't mean he's going to stop trying to surpass him anyway.</br>  Why is Dragonball even a thing anymore? Even Z lost its luster pretty quickly because it was the same old routine of<br> strong villain appears <br> heroes are defeated <br> heroes receive powerup, beat villain <br> villain receives powerup, beats heroes <br>ad infinitum<br><br>They reached so many new transformation stages for the saiyans that reaching a new stage isn't even anything special anymore.<br><br>The whole show is just a parade for old characters we grew fond of for the sake of nostalgia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you but I'm basically watching for the slice of life stuff</br>  <br> never killed his enemies <br> Piccolo, Raditz, how he thought a Spirit Bomb would just really hurt Vegeta is beyond me, Freiza <br><br>You might wanna actually sit down and talk with Kakarot about his childhood sometime Vegeta.<br><br> Vegeta's face when he finds out a little girl android is stronger than Goku <br><br>I dunno which would bother him more, the little girl bit or the android part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he finally realized why Goku is far stronger than him, but that doesn't mean he's going to stop trying to surpass him anyway. <br> Just because you're right doesn't make you right! </br></br>  Since the afterlife fillers never happened in Kai, wasn't King Kai revived by the dragonballs when everyone killed by Cell was revived?  <br>yup should have ended in freeza</br>  <br>Nostalgia</br>  If the manga passes the anime which it already has what are they basing this on<br><br>Why have the manga lag so far behind?</br></br>  <br>This follows the anime, and in the anime he chose to stay dead</br>  <br>Does it matter?<br><br>That is after all, a promotional manga.<br><br>It's not like actual Toriyama manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br>Goku was stronger at that time and Vegeta accepted it, but Vegeta pride wont stop him from training to be the best</br></br>  <br>is super just a prequel to the lord beerus movie? i dont get it. why is beerus talking like he hasnt fought ss god yet. the movie are out.</br>  <br><br><br>The manga isn't meant to be a substitute for the show; it's just promotional material, a teaser for things to come. The manga will likely just skip ahead instead of following the story linearly. <br><br>This isn't like the other shows, Toriyama is pretty much dictating everything directly to the anime staff, instead of the anime staff just working off his manga and occasionally asking him questions. The manga is based off scraps and scribbles of pre-production animation work. and it's drawn by a mimic-Toriyama artist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is absolutely no reason to think that</br>  <br>That's what I wanna know. It seems like they're going to retread covered ground.</br>  <br>god you fate secondaries are fucking thick<br>that line referred to logic and morality</br></br>  <br><br>For the 17th time, Super is gonna retell the movies and then go to an alternate universe.</br></br>  <br><br>Not quite a prequel. Super is adapting the events of the two films into arcs, but there will be discrepancies between how things happened in the movies and how they will happen in the show. So Super is basically forming it's own timeline of events independent of the movies, and the goal is to tie this stuff all together and move beyond it.</br></br>  <br> toriyama is dictating everything <br>Yeah,no. He did the basic plot outline and the designs,nothing more.</br></br>  Subs when?<br><br>Dubs when?</br></br>  <br> an entire episode of tsundere Vegeta <br><br>I fucking love Super</br></br></br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  Revival of F when?  <br>I hope never<br>but most likely in 15 episodes or so</br></br>  how can anyone NOT love Vegeta?  <br> &gt;Vegeta's face when he finds out a little girl android is stronger than Goku <br> I dunno which would bother him more, the little girl bit or the android part. <br>HOW LONG UNTIL THIS HAPPENS</br></br></br>  <br>I might've been overreaching when I said "dictating everything". Scene composition, visuals, and choreography probably have more of the directors, key animators and storyboarders hands in them than Toriyama, but he definitely has more involvement than a basic plot outline. Especially with Kaio making shitty puns like "Heiwa ga hei wa!"</br>  How come no decent sub group has picked this up?  <br>He accepted his strength. That doesn't mean he won't want to surpass it. <br><br>Did you miss that he reiterated the Numbah Wan speech from Kid Boo fight?</br></br></br>  <br>No one except spics give a shit about DBS</br>  <br>He is the ultimate manlet tsun and I love him dearly.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how many times I'm gonna have to post this link that tells the whole initial plot<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come no decent sub group has picked this up? <br>http://the-moonlighters.ml/pelican/<wbr>dragon-ball-super-001.html<br><br>These guys are a good group</br></br></wbr></br></br>   on vacation with his family <br> all he can think about is Goku </br>  <br>Dragon Team. They are slow to release, but they understand the series and have better translations for Super than you'll find for just about any other series. They are great.<br>http://the-moonlighters.ml/pelican/<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> Two days is slow to release <br>Come on man.</br></br>  <br> Also, was this entire episode a slideshow? <br>Was there anything that particularly needed to be animated besides the fights?<br><br>This part was pretty good</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're okay. They don't translate enough proper nouns and leave honorifics in, though, which is entirely unnecessary.</br></br>  <br>That fucking sucks. I wanted to read manga week to week to see what would happen ahead of time</br>  <br><br>What a badass<br><br>Now, I want to see more of him. T_T</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I was around when they were Baaro-subs and were doing Kai, and they would go weeks without releases sometimes. In fact, they never actually finished Kai.</br>  What the fuck is wrong with Bulma? Why is she even with Vegeta who clearly doesn't like other people, especially humans? This whole thing is just reinforcing the stereotype that women go after the assholes.  People bitched about Bingo Vegeta.<br><br>They retconed the old one.</br></br>  <br>No, it reinforces that fact that morons fall for tsunderes.</br>  <br>Considering the alternatives, I'm not really bothered by that at all. Even Funimation's official subtitles for DB do that<br><br><br>Vegeta loves his family very much. He's just incredibly tsundere about it. That's what Vegeta is, a male tsundere and Bulma sees that. I think Trunks said something about it during the Cell saga that both he and his mom love him for being the kind of person he is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> This whole thing is just reinforcing the stereotype that women go after the assholes. <br><br>but that's true</br></br></br>  <br><br>TL note: tsundere means asshole</br></br>  <br>They didn't retcon shit. He says the same thing he was saying during the Kid Boo fight about how he thought Kakarot was #1. Except here he says that he knows he's #1 but he's not going to stay #2 forever.</br>  <br>To be perfectly honest, I was hoping for the same thing. I can barely stand Sumitomo's music, and I am wary of Toei's pacing and quality issues. So I'd much prefer if I could just read a manga instead. But so far, the show hasn't been as bad as I feared.</br>  <br>Vegeta gonna Vegeta guy. Don't know what I can say.<br><br>He's not acting like how he did during the Cell saga anymore when he didn't give a shit about his family so this is a much better improvement.</br></br></br>  <br>rewatch the scene when he blows himself up to kill Buu</br>  So is AnimeRG the best subs we can get at the moment? I'm not that well versed in the language but I've still noticed a few grammatical errors here and there.  <br>Its the only subs</br>  <br>Fucking Pui and Yakkon was Stronger than Freiza.<br>At this point I'm willing to believe that Freiza was basically shit in the actual scale of the Universe as a whole</br></br>  <br>Patience is a virtue. See </br>  <br>Show proof that they were stronger than frieza</br>  <br>They are for now but the best subs will be Dragon Team<br><br><br>I don't think you can really prove that</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about DeadFish edits?</br>  <br>Deadfish is just Dragon Team's subs but scaled down in size for phones and shit</br>  How are ElSpark's subs?  <br>watchable</br>  <br>Elspark's subs are done quickly and haphazardly. In the new episode, they mistranslate "Beerus has been asleep for 39 years" as "Beerus has been asleep for 30 million years."<br><br>I don't think that qualifies as watchable. Not with the amount of time I will now have to dedicate arguing with retards online who think Beerus was asleep for 30 million years now.</br></br></br>  <br>dragon team is the best Ive seen. The DBsuper subs I just saw are full of errors and even missing lines</br>  <br>Bulma wants the strongest. This is reinforced in the Namek saga where Bulma makes a comment to the tune of, "Maybe I went after the wrong man," when referring to Yamcha in comparison to Goku.<br><br>She couldn't get Goku, though, so she went after the second-strongest: Vegeta.</br></br></br>  <br>My bad. All this time I thought they did something other than convert to mp4.</br>  <br>maybe she just wanted a man as abrasive as she is. <br><br>its implied they conceived trunks in an act of passion anyway</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, literal whore. Disgusting.</br>  So we're getting BoG next week already?<br><br>Good stuff.</br></br>  <br>And to continue on this line: It also explains why Bulma is the antithesis to Chi-Chi when it comes to their wants for their husbands. Bulma is constantly shown assisting Vegeta with his training, trying constantly to make him stronger by building the gravity room, flying that jet in this Super episode haphazardly, and (in GT so not canon) blasting Vegeta to help him achieve SSJ4 status.</br>  <br> People bitched about Bingo Vegeta. <br>I'm pretty sure most people loved it.</br></br>  <br><br>Viz scans where?<br><br>I can only find LQ shit</br></br></br></br>  I stopped watching Kai after the Namek Saga but I just checked the wiki and realized that DBS aired like a week after the final episode of Kai. So it really is like a continuation for everyone who's been watching Kai.<br><br>I guess they were testing the waters with the two movies and Kai, decided the demand was there and fucking went for a new series.<br><br>Sort of off-topic but how long do you guys think DBS will run for? Are we looking at a whole new series of arcs, or just a 4 cour?</br></br></br></br>   <br>Bulma and Vegeta's personalities are actually compatible: they're both jerks, stubborn, vain, smart and deep down have a noble heart. <br>They don't need to be around each other all the time and they can support and care about each other in their own way. I think that's why it works.</br></br>  <br>They stopped Kai after the Cell saga and only did the Buu saga after BoG proved succesful as well. That movie really gave some life back to the series.</br>  <br> decide to say dead <br> hang around Goku <br><br> get revived by the DBs <br> still hang around Goku <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see it having legs. Seeing as how Toriyama came back to the series after 20 years away and has already written two movies and has plans for a new arc in the series, I don't think it'll be ending soon. We got<br><br> Battle of Gods arc <br> Resurrection F arc <br> Super Dragon Balls arc <br><br>The Super Dragon Balls takes this shit to a whole 'nother universe. Toriyama's got ideas, and I think that so long as the money keeps coming in, the show will keep going until Toriyama fucking dies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kakarots victory over Buu <br><br>but everyone knows Gohan's stronger right?</br></br>  <br><br>I have a feeling that he's going to try to tie the Super Dragon Balls Arc to BoG and RoF arc, considering that we've already seen a few animated scenes of fat Beerus.</br></br>  <br> and has already written two movies <br><br>*cough* supervised *cough*</br></br></br>  <br>Gohan WAS stronger but Goku caught up pretty fast, like he always does. Vegeta was stronger too.</br>  <br>Even Toriyama said, "Gohan was a mistake." Not his exact words, but near them:<br> Akira Toriyama: I intended to put Gohan into the leading role. It didn’t work out. I felt that compared to Goku, he was ultimately not suited for the part.  <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/intended-<wbr>end/majin-buu/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>He should still be stronger...<br><br>I mean gohan was kicking super buu's ass and Goku was getting his shit kicked in by the weaker kid buu<br><br>I mean I guess they could use the excuse Gohan slacked on his training...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I loved this guy the moment we saw him. I hoped he will be somebody important, too bad he's DEAD. <br><br>And what the fucks about the story? Is it BEFORE the movies? Or Beerus had amnesia or what <br><br>Literally what the fuck is this shows about?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Battle of Gods. He is the screenplay writer for Resurrection F.</br>  Is there a decent quality Frieza's return anywhere? No shakey-cam crap. Have looked around a bit but after 2 DLs both were Russian.  <br>Here's how Dragon Ball Super will work:<br><br> First Arc: Battle of Gods <br> Second Arc: Resurrection F <br> Third Arc: Search for Super Dragon Balls </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice source. Mystic Gohan doesn't suffer from ki drain or anything that would lower his top level. Nigga's basically SSJ3 full power.</br>  <br>Toei really has crafted a sort of renaissance for Dragon Ball, although I don't believe it was their intention from the very start. <br><br>Nothing has been said at all about the show's episode count, so all we can really manage is baseless speculation. For one thing, they've said that the movies will be adapted into arcs, but there doesn't seem to be the slightest hinting at Freeza's return in the show. It almost looks as if we'll go straight from the Battle of Gods arc into the Universe 6 arc with Champa and Girl Whis. Maybe this new arc will be inserted between the events of the two films? <br><br>If they will finally do what I'm hoping they will do, to go beyond the end of Z post-Uub, I can't see this having any less than 4 cours.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Third Arc is going to be Universe 6 vs 7</br>  <br>I believe in a Xenoverse arc happening.<br><br>I want to believe.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a source for this?</br>  <br>I really hope you're wrong. Those fucking japs can't be this assholes. The really doing series about movies we already saw? what's the point</br>  <br><br>Oh, nvm, I'm dumb. <br><br>Here you are:<br><br> Dragon Ball Super” is a complete continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Character development in DBZ is always being reset in every arc.<br><br>Look at Gohan now. He's a loser again when a couple of arcs ago he was hot shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Kid Buu is more or less on par with Super Buu.</br>  <br>Mystic Gohan is still weaker than Goku.</br>  <br><br>No, it's going to be more like<br><br> Battle of Gods <br> Universe 6 <br><br>we've already seen animations of Fat Beerus and Fem Whiz, which means they should be showing up soon.<br><br>Only Battle of Gods mentioned the other Universes, so we probably have some time before they redo Resurrection of F, if they ever do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta doesn't know shit about Gohan's powers as he was dead and even still he hasn't trained for six months probably</br>  <br>They weren't even close. Goku was scared shitless to fight Super Buu.</br>  <br><br>Toriyama is probably going to tie all those into one another somehow.<br><br>We should be seeing Universe 6's Beerus in just a few episodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because a) it's safe as fuck, b) Even if everybody's seen BoG, RoF has not come out on home release yet and won't for a while and c) since they want to go past RoF eventually they have to lead into it. Also they will fill gaps that were left hanging</br>  <br>Upcoming episode spoilers:  Goku faces off against Beerus on Kai's planet in episode 5. </br>  <br> No, it's going to be more like <br><br> Battle of Gods <br> Universe 6 <br><br>Toriyama said in the showcase event that they are doing the Revival of F arc after the Battle of Gods arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking shameless fucks. <br> T-there will be something g-great I swear, but first here's 90 episodes of slice of life, and shit you already know the outcome of <br><br>Just, why.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For one thing, there have already been considerable differences between the way things happen in the movies and the way they are happening in the show. So it's not things we've already seen. It's retelling, reworking, and tying all these things together. Well, that's the optimistic way of looking at things. They might not give a fuck, and just end up cutting and editing the movie footage down into episodes. I can't see Toei spending money on more new animation for such a thing.</br>  <br> 90 episodes <br>I'm guessing ~20 at the most.</br></br>  <br>Again, nice source. But in a realistic fight Goku would fight just so he could stay SSJ3 while Gohan wouldn't have dropped a sweat.<br><br><br>Nah, he was just worried about the people down there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 90 <br>I will say its at max something like 24-26</br></br>  <br> They might not give a fuck, and just end up cutting and editing the movie footage down into episodes. <br>Bulma's party is on a cruise ship and some of the cast is wearing different clothes so I don't think that's possible.</br></br>  <br> implying Mystic Gohan vs Goku is even mentioned somewhere in the manga or by Toriyama <br>There's no official statement on who's the strongest, but clearly Goku prevailed. And that's for a reason. Also, you could go back and read this: </br></br>  This new series is boring as hell.  <br>If they recap battle of gods, it better be fucking quick. I don't want a 90 minute movie to be spread over 10 episodes which would take 10 weeks just to watch something we already saw. <br>Same with frieza arc if they did that too</br></br>  <br><br>Lets say you're right, and it's 26 episodes at most. It's still a lot of time, waiting on shit, that already happened. <br><br><br>Dragon ball never bothered with plotholes. don't even get me started on them. <br><br><br>Guys, for fucks sake, I just want to see some crazy DB action against wacky enemies, doing crazy shit, like blowing up planets. <br><br>I don't care about Vegita still being an angry prick to his family, or Goku still being autistic, or how Beerus decides NOT to destroy earth, and Goku going SSJGSSJ agains Golden Frieza. <br><br>Actually I'm surprised you guys defending this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're right. All the information we have is pointing towards us getting a fairly different version of events from the movies. I have to wonder how much they might change in RoF... I hope Freeza-kun survives this one....</br>  <br> but clearly Goku prevailed <br>I think we've read different mangos, because I remember Mr. Satan saving the world. Also:<br><br> leading role <br> having anything to do with power levels </br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people think the SoL will continue for so long?<br><br>Hell next week is already about Bulma's birthday</br></br>  <br>are you from 9gag? fuck off summerfag.</br>  <br> I don't care about the characters gib explosions </br>  <br>I wouldn't even care for the SoL if it was good, nicely paced SoL (today's was somewhat acceptable SoL). And it it had some remarkable music.<br><br> I miss Kikuchi. </br></br></br>  <br>If they want to go past the movies, there is an audience who may not have seen them. And its not like everything is the exact same, that's why its a reimagining<br><br> doing crazy shit, like blowing up planets. <br>Uh<br><br> Actually I'm surprised you guys defending this <br>Well it's not like it's done anything actually bad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm nearing the end of the Freeza arc right now and I think it's kinda bullshit that Goku is so much stronger than Vegeta. Vegeta's getting his ass kicked non-stop in order to become stronger and all Goku did was train at ultra-high gravity. <br><br>Vegeta should be so much damn stronger than Goku right now.</br></br>    <br>Zenkais&lt;actual training<br><br>Goku got to actually train AND get beat half to death. Vegeta just kept on charging through everything and get his ass kicked</br></br></br>  <br>he also died, trained on king kai's planet and put himself through 100x gravity training throughout the whole time he was on his way to Namek. It was even explained that Goku is stronger than Vegeta because King Kai's training is faster than normal.</br>  The animation quality for this show while still being pretty bad it's still somewhat tolerable, why the fuck can't toei put at lesat this minimum amount of effort into One Piece.I mean it's still their most popular show and their main cash cow and with a bit more effort it could actually become a far bigger success.  <br> there is an audience who may not have seen them <br><br>Point taken<br><br> Uh  <br><br>I mean, while fighting against each other, should'we been more specific <br><br><br>I said I don't care about shit we already know. <br>We know for like 20 years that Vegita is an angry manlet, and Goku has brain problems <br>And we already wasted two weeks about these<br><br><br>thanks doc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Who did he get beaten half to death by? That shit only happened when he wasn't in his own body -- it shouldn't count.<br><br>But, then again, I'm arguing DBZ power level bullshit, it doesn't have to make sense.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, it seems fairly believable to me. Definitely easier to accept than "We get a kajillion times stronger just from almost dying". Imagine being 100 times heavier and doing pushups and hitting yourself with energy beams, definitely seems like a way to get way stronger.</br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  Was King kai voice always like that in the jap ver?, it sounds like an 80 yo man, he can't scream or raise his voice anymore.  <br> I said I don't care about shit we already know. <br>Well you can also take it on that filling the gaps part. BoG starts with Goku on Kai's planet for reasons and Vegeta training for reasons. These episodes showed how they got there and what the other main characters have been doing since Boo. I'm looking at it from a narrative point of view, not from the fact that I've seen BoG already. And again, I don't think the episodes have even been bad or anything.</br></br>  Episode 3: Bulma's birthday, Beerus visits Goku, Beerus visits Earth<br>Episode 4: Beerus shenanigans, Goku tries to become SSG, Beerus threatens to destroy Earth<br>Episode 5: Vegeta fights Beerus, Goku saves the day, Goku becomes SSG<br>Episode 6: Goku vs Beerus, victory, we learn about the other universes<br>Episodes 7-8: SoL<br>Episodes 8-12: Resurrection of F<br><br>That would be the first cour</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gohan is actually alright. He was never going to stay a badass because he didn't like fighting</br>  <br>Nope.<br><br> Beerus fights Goku for the first time in episode 5. Episode 4 involves Pilaf. </br></br></br>  <br> That shit only happened when he wasn't in his own body -- it shouldn't count. <br>Well it's still his body<br><br><br><br>Episode 3 is going to be before the beginning of the party and also about Beerus remembering his dream<br>Episode 4 is about Pilaf<br>Episode 5, from the title is going to be that part of the movie where Beerus slaps Goku's shit on Kai planet.<br><br>Considering that is about 30 minutes in the movie, it's looking like somewhere around 12 or so episodes for BoG arc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's too fast. this is dbz we're talking about. the pacing is going to be shit like always. it's going to be 1-12 First half of Battle of Gods. 12-24 Second half battle of Gods. Then preview of Resurrection of F, which of course if Dragon Ball Super is not to everyone's taste, will not happen.</br>  <br>we know episode 5 is about goku vs beerus in king kai's planet</br>  Why are they remaking the movies into this series ? That's fucking bullshit honestly.  <br> Then preview of Resurrection of F, which of course if Dragon Ball Super is not to everyone's taste, will not happen <br>But we already know it's happening. We know the first three arcs of this show already</br></br>  <br>Even if ginyu was in gokus body while getting beaten up, Gokus body still got the zenkai boost. It's genetics in the saiyan body not gokus soul</br>  <br>He is an 83 year old man, actually. Joji Yanami. He didn't sound so bad in Battle of Gods, but he has definitely been in poor health lately. It's really depressing, you can hear him trying, but he just doesn't have it in him anymore. I hope he doesn't end up an hero like Daisuke Gori.</br>  <br>You're absolutely right, my mistake. But I still believe the pacing is going to be shit.</br>  <br>Because they want to do a story past RoF but RoF hasn't come out on DVD yet in Japan so they have to lead into it properly</br>  <br>and I will calm down, and enjoy the fuck out of the show, if the other Anons are right, and shit will be done in 5-6 episodes. <br><br>But my whole point is, since my original post, that this shit will take fucking forever to get over with, calling it now. <br>I hope I'm wrong anyway Anon.</br></br></br></br>  jesus christ why is vegeta such a constant asshole?<br><br>can't he just relax for one fucking day?</br></br>  <br>Bulma is a selfish asshole, Vegita is a selfish asshole<br><br>they both get shit done when they are forced to.</br></br></br>  <br>How cute anon<br>It will take at least twice as much episodes</br></br>  <br>Shitty reason tbh. Why not wait until it's out on DVD then? That will be what? One month of wait?</br>  <br>he was the incumbent king of a planet of the universes strongest warriors<br><br>it got blown up by an effeminate lady-boy<br><br>i would be pissed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I can see the first 26 episodes being dedicated to BoG/RoF.<br><br>Now what I wonder is if there will be any breaks in the series or if we'll go right from RoF to new material the week afterwards. I'm guessing there won't be any breaks as there's no manga to wait on and they want to keep Dragon Ball's popularity going.</br></br></br>  The reason Dragon Ball and Z's anime pacing was so bad was because the manga was coming out at the same time. This is anime-original so that problem doesn't exist. Even GT had them already get their first Dragon Ball by like the 5th episode. <br><br>This won't have unbelievably long power up sequences and long moments of staring because they don't have that as an issue</br></br>  <br>Try to see it like this: <br>You know you're a manlet tsundere asshole, who's also stupid as fuck, maybe can't even read, let alone work at some normal place. <br><br>You're only good at one thing: blowing up things, and fighting Android-alien demons. <br><br>But you defeated the strongest of Android-alien demons, and now you're supposed to enjoy life, the thing that you're terrible at. <br><br>I would be agitated</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>RoF doesn't come out in Japan until October.<br><br>You think they're going to wait 4 whole months and lose the hype they have from RoF's film ticket sales and the ending of Kai? This isn't Sailor Moon Crystal</br></br></br>  <br> implying Dragon Ball is not the best when it's about SoL shinnenigans <br><br>I want newfags who only saw Z to leave</br></br></br>  <br>what's a DVD?</br>  I haven't watched the ssg movie. I feel like it's a good thing because now I'm experiencing new stories in the anime. Should I keep not watching the movie?  <br> love SoL shenanigans but hate the fact that it's shit we already saw/know for 30 episodes minimum  <br> mfw i have no face </br></br>  Fuck, that picture looks so much better than the current style. <br><br>Painful.</br></br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>...nigger you fucking serious?</br>  <br>The movie will most likely end up having way better fights.</br>  <br>Everyone look smaller and chubbier.</br>  <br>I miss the older animation style. My favourite shit is the animation during the namek saga. I miss how the ssj hair used to be a pale yellow rather than piss gold like they are now, and there weren't harsh black lines to make it look spikey. Also why do faces look so shiny now?</br>  <br>Battle of Gods might not be a part of the continuity they're building within Super, but I think it's still a very enjoyable film and definitely worth a watch. I think sometimes people get too hung up in canonicity and continuity to enjoy the narrative being presented right in front of them. If the fact that BoG may not mesh with the continuity of Super makes it impossible for you to care about the movie, then you might not enjoy it.<br><br>I personally couldn't give a fuck about a canon. I hope Paikuhan and Garlic jr fuse to hold off Fat Beerus, while Goku recovers from a near fatal wound dealt to him by Golden Cooler.</br></br></br>  <br>The movie and series will be different so you can look at both.<br><br><br>There are many shots in the old anime that are good, but that one isn't one of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True. Watching episode 2 of dbs Vageta looked really really short to me. And I like how in the OP picture his hair is just a block of black. The hair in general was cooler imo in back then</br>  Its funny, Beerus is supposed to be the least villainous of the villain and yet so far he's come off as the MOST evil of all of them.  <br>I'm not sure who Vageta is but yes.</br>  <br><br>You can have Beerus. I'll take Champa.</br></br>  <br> implying mr.satan isn't the champion </br>  <br> I miss how the ssj hair used to be a pale yellow rather than piss gold like they are now <br>Toriyama has it as gold though. Also the anime started making it golder by the Boo arc</br></br>  So currently there's 3 subs out for this. inert, DBSuper and SeNsUi subs.<br><br>Which one's the best?</br></br>  Is there any link for that orchestral version of "Cha-la" that plays during the recap at the beginning of each episode?  <br>None. Seriously, all of them are rips of the same subs and they are shit. <br><br>If you want to see subs that are complete shit but give you a basic idea of the episode, it doesn't matter but you really want to wait for Dragon Team for actually decent subs<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iAd<wbr>uwaFCk_c</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still prefer the pale yellow</br>  anon's RF subs where?  <br>Ahh, only a minute long. Oh well, hopefully there'll be a longer version on the OST. Thanks.</br>   new dragon ball anime <br> two episodes out <br> both are filler episodes <br>I mean, I'm not really complaining. I'm happy to get anything that's both Dragon Ball and canon ever since Z ended, it's just kinda funny to see that even the new anime is going to have filler out the ass.<br><br>Dragon Ball anime will never be able to escape the filler.</br></br></br></br></br>  can someone please give a link for the stream of the 2nd episode ?<br><br>i only find jackshit sites selling magic donkeys that wanna steal my strawberrys</br></br>  <br><br>I do not think that word means what you think it does</br></br>  <br>That is not a flattering shot of Goku there.</br>  <br> filler <br>You don't know what filler is, do you?</br></br>  <br>Do you even know what "filler" means?</br>  <br> filler <br>Do you even know what that word means?

The first two sagas are based on the last two movies, and we're getting episodes based on finding Videl a birthday present and a family vacation with Vegeta.<br><br>Meme all you want, those are filler episodes. The only thing that might not count as filler is the last minute of the 2nd episode.<br><br>If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i agree they should fight from 0:01 until the end without talking to each other.<br><br>same with people complaining about dialogue in walking dead OMG WHY DONT THEY SHOOT ZOMBIE ALL TIME MAN</br></br></br>  <br>Autism</br>  <br> If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler. <br>I guess you don't know what filler is then.</br></br>  Everything that isn't punching bad guys in the face is filler apparently. It's a little depressing, the state of discussion in DBZ communities. You'd think the fans would be older, wiser... at the very least understand what storytelling is.  <br>That's a pretty elaborate way to say that you don't know what a filler episode is but okay.</br>  <br> meme <br><br>There's another word that you apparently don't know the meaning of</br></br></br>  <br> If it doesn't advance the plot, it's filler. <br><br>So you don't understand what filler means.

The CGI for them is noticeably different compared to the characters.<br><br>The shadowy thing on top of the rubble looked like the first "boss" from the game.<br><br>The training room was the tutorial room.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't episode 0 subbed since the 720p raws are out?  Amy stitches?  Any word on who might be subbing this or just Funi?  <br>Daisuki is subbing it. I think they have an exclusive contract.<br><br>http://www.daisuki.net/<br><br>It's free to watch in 480p but if you make a free account you can watch up to 1080p. They make money through ads it seems.</br></br></br></br></br>  Don't use this thread, we already have one <br><br/></br>  <br>Fun fact, 8 animation directors and 12 studios worked on the first episode. The fact that these production credits only appear on the site and not on the episode might be a show of embarrassment.</br>  <br>It's just the 2011 OVA + staff talk show.<br><br><br> I think they have an exclusive contract. <br>Anime Consortium Japan which is running Daisuki is on the production committee.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that random teddy bear in the middle of the webm </br>  <br>We already have this thread you fucking /v/ermin retard. Stop embarrassing yourself.</br>  <br><br>That's the one filled with shitposts.<br><br><br>Is that why it was delayed? Production issues?<br><br><br>Here's one but it's fucking awful because the background moves and lighting changed during the pan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How on earth are they all wearing fitted sleeves with these gigantic bracelets that they can't remove? How did Utsugi take off his jacket?</br>  <br><br>Not sure how to feel about the show yet. Maybe because I haven't played the game.<br><br>I already have a feeling that either the Branch Director or Lindow will turn into the big bad, though. Both of them have that traitor vibe.</br></br></br></br>    <br> That's the one filled with shitposts. <br> If they don't praise the show they must be shitposting! </br></br>  <br>You can not praise the show and it still wouldn't be as bad as that thread. Don't be delusional.</br>  A pretty decent first episode, these CGI artstyle(?) is starting to grow on me, it looks way better than SIdonia at least.<br><br>Unfortunately, I can already see people calling it fujoshit anime if it does well like Kekkai.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127983093 <br>NNB is shit<br>Euphonium is shit<br>GE isn't shit<br>Because it isn't boring</br></br></br></br>  <br> it isn't boring <br>But it is.</br></br>  I wonder if she masturbates with machine oil.  <br> Bringing up two completely unrelated shows <br><br>IRC at full force for this show, I see.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime this shit doing well. </br>  is this burst or not ?  <br> if it does well <br>Not going to happen so don't worry.</br></br>  <br>Lindow dies like a bitch early on.</br>  <br><br>I remember people telling me this when AOT and Free aired too. Screencapped just in case</br></br>  I think it looked pretty good for CG. It's good enough that I didn't feel like dropping it in the middle of the episode. I'll actually stick with it unlike all the other previous CG shows.  <br> Non Non Biyori <br> Working!!! <br> Trouble darkness <br> Moster girls <br>I would be really surprised if this show ends up selling well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Every post get redirected to /v/,MAL and reddit <br> Not shitposting <br>Nice try shitposter-kun but anyone with half a brain will see that the other thread went to shit.<br>Nobody is discussing the show since everyone is too busy trying to frame the other as a /v/ermine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I found that surprisingly enjoyable. I don't really know anything about the show though so I assume it will go to shit.</br>  <br> Unfortunately, I can already see people calling it fujoshit anime if it does well like Kekkai. <br>Nah, that kind of shitposter is being distracted by gangsta.</br></br>  <br>Everybody saw SnK selling, it was obvious as hell.<br>Good thing Japan hates God Eater as well.</br></br>  <br>That's because it isn't primarily CG but mostly hand drawn with extremely heavy filtering. If you pay attention you will spot the difference.</br>  <br> It's just the 2011 OVA + staff talk show. <br>Right but the only available sub I've seen is like 320p. Surely someone would've slapped subs on the 720p version by now.</br></br>  <br>The hell is going on with his collarbones?</br>  <br/>  <br>I'll take it. It looks mostly good for enough of the anime that I don't hate it.</br>  Pretty sure this is what the leader was.  <br>The show isn't entirely CGI like Sidonia.</br>  <br>For some reason they seem to have decided to take hand drawn and get close to the look of the game using post-processing rather than just using CG. Maybe because you can get better animation from hand drawn. At least that is what I think from watching it and looking at the credits there are tons more normal animators credited with working on the episode than CGI artists so they must have been drawing something. The monsters seemed entirely CG though.</br>  <br> Japan hates God Eater as well. <br><br>Sauce: My ass</br></br></br>  <br> m-muh MANime </br>   B-but muh 2D anime <br>I have no problem watching this since I wanted to play the games, but kinda forgot about them</br>  <br> show with brown prostitutes and actual onscreen sex <br> fujoshit <br>you fucking wot m8, at least call Aoharu fujoshit</br></br></br>  <br>Not same anon but if I get bored to death with those anime then i'm <br> muh MANime?  <br><br>KyoAni shitposters need to die</br></br></br></br>  <br>The show has 2 sexy men as the lead. You know the Fujoshi will be all over that.</br>  <br> This is what shitposters actually think </br>   fake sales fags don't realize bamcos doing the exact same distribution strategy Cinderella girls did. For God Eater as well.  <br><br>Sure must be nice having the best competitive advantage in terms of publishers</br></br>  It kinda looks like they're trying to copy the techniques used in Kotonowa no Niwa along with some sort of filter and lots of shading to try and get it to look closer to the game, characters and weapons are definitely not CG but the backgrounds and aragami definitey are ,anime has had CG backgrounds for years now, look at almost any seasonal action anime and "dynamic" scenes, even Pokemon uses it now.<br><br>Still, it's a game adaptation so it's probably going to end up being trash.</br></br>  <br><br> Thinking the characters are CG <br><br>It's like you faggots have never seen shading before</br></br></br></br>    <br> thumb placement <br>So, I'm wondering how they go through all this work with multiple levels of shading and still nobody manages to realize her hand is on backwards.</br></br>  <br>Just you wait until you're looking at sadpanda one day and then you see those two shirtless on the cover of a doujin all about them fucking each other complete with silly hand motions.</br>  <br>nigga you can have shading without making them look like shit</br>  <br><br>It's not. That's just shittily drawn perspective on that hand</br></br>  <br>UFOTABLE IS FINISHED</br>  <br> He thinks because cowtit prostitute is in it it's not fujoshit <br>Two bishounen buff leads who take up a majority of the screen time, noticeable female audience.<br><br>Gotta keep in mind this is Japan we're talking about, not Tumblr landwhales(and even then they like it.)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the new season but I remember Crowds was pretty Fujoshi</br>  <br>Only autists care about that. It's a fucking minor mistake and you fucking know it. <br><br>Bothers you so much? buy BDs.</br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is omnipandering but Sugane is gay as fuck for Joe, and this season they amped it up</br>  <br>The only one suitably Fujoshi-bait in that is Joe, and he barely gets any screentime anyway. That show as a whole went pretty unnoticed, but there were a few Hajime doujins.<br><br>Gangsta has 2 sexy male leads with all the screentime. That makes a big difference.</br></br></br>  <br>The point is it's still not CG you blind faggots.</br>  <br> Only autists care about that. It's a fucking minor mistake and you fucking know it. </br>  <br><br><br>Literally every studio draws perspective shittily at some point. Modern anime scheduling means you get 1 shot to get it right, if not you have to move on and suck it up.</br></br></br>   gameplay is some monhun ripoff <br> game story is evangelion ripoff <br> anime made to be SnK ripoff because that got popular <br>Amazing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's the connective tissue from her wrist to her hand.<br><br>The placement is fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>God eater predates AoT by one year, but nice try</br></br>   next ep probably   Is this CG?  <br>Does it matter? All that should matter is if you like it, regardless of the production.</br>  <br>What is the shadow framing his face even? If I didn't know better I'd mistake it for lazily drawn stubble. Same for  as well.</br>  <br>I get they had a hard-on for 5-tone shading, but you can do it without it looking like CG. Just fix your coloring.</br>  <br>No. Shading.<br><br>Anyways, this <br>But faggots like you can't decide wheter they like something unless someone else tells them. <br><br>I like it by the way, not sure about the story</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it matter what, dumblord? Or do you think I'm asking "Is this CG? If yes then I'll drop it." or what?</br>    Is it more or does Sidonia actually look better than the stylized 3dcg of God Eater?<br><br>I can't put my finger on it but there's something just wrong about it.</br></br>   **1,141位/**1,045位 (***,155 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/10/29 GOD EATER / ゴッドイーター vol.1 (特装限定版) [Blu-ray] <br>UFOTABLE found a way!</br>  <br>to fuck up a show</br>  <br>Ufotable is the new shaft, they can only milk one franchise.</br>  <br>Jesus.

Not Orage though, the actual good one</br></br></br>  <br>anime parodies*</br>  <br>Yeah great work indeed making this one, there's no shitposting at all.</br>  <br>Was talking about the MH post.</br>  <br>I can't imagine a monster hunter anime working unless it's a short ova series. Plus could you imagine the cg monsters?</br>  <br>i cant understand what the ranking there</br>  <br>Tachibana Sakuya. She was in the first episode.</br>  Fucking thread infested by samefag summer cancer. <br><br>I blame ufotable's shitty, trollable CGI-2D mess.</br></br>  <br>Top left is I very like it, bottom right is I very hate it. Just take it like that.</br>  <br>Fuck off IRC</br>  <br>You are cancer. Who are you trying to fool /v/ermin.</br>  <br><br>Nice work, you found me kid. I'm actually getting paid to do this, Ufo needs to boost sales. What about you, enjoying the summer from your mom's basement? I guess summer is the only time you can enjoy your sad excuse of a life, so I'll leave you to it. <br><br>Don't worry, I already talked to Eric and Sam, you're gonna have a fun fall semester.</br></br></br></br>  All those shitposter ruining GE Threads<br><br>Let be honest, was a good episode, non excellent or mediocre. Let praise for Takayuki.</br></br>  <br><br>Ah ok I get what's going on here.<br><br>Monhun faggots are mad because another hunting game got an anime, it's fucking clear as day why the fuck didn't I notice before? <br>You people were mad the other time around because Toukiden something got ported to PC too didn't you? <br><br>Everything makes sense now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reverse trolling?</br>  <br> Boogeymaning IRC <br>What is this, 2013? Don't you know reddit is the post popular boogeyman these days?</br></br>  <br><br>Does Monhun really have that much in the way of a story though? God Eater at least attempted to have one compared to it.</br></br>  <br>cancer-kun why are you so mad? does your life is this bad?</br>  <br>What about SRW OG the Inspector?<br>It wasn't the best, but it was great</br></br>  <br>you must be the happiest man in the world if you found this garbage to be good</br>  So the game fun or nah?  Gave it 6 whole minutes.<br><br>Astonishingly terrible. It's been a long time since I watched something this awful, I guess they saw "tie-in" and decided to not even try.<br><br>Who thought a million cuts into slow-mo make for good direction? Because that guy needs to get fired and blacklisted from the industry.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't a thread for NNB, DB or Kuusen whatever<br>This is the GE thread, which was a pretty good first episode, and not garbage</br></br>  <br> I watched it for 6 minutes <br> Somehow I think I have the right to talk about it </br></br>  <br><br>I love Takayuki and ufotable, no Namco shitty self-inserts games. Takayuki is giving life to GE.</br></br>  <br><br> I watched the whole EP <br> somehow I think I have the right to exist </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah its shit, the game is pretty average though</br>  <br>Monster Hunter but for weeaboos who just suck at games<br>Most of it's fans really bought just it to bust nuts to alisa</br></br>  More like shit eater.  I thought it was pretty good. I like the unique art style too.<br><br>Stay mad at everything, faggots.</br></br>  <br>"That guy" directed one of the best anime movies ever made, KnK5. Learn some respect.</br>  So yet another show this season whose threads to avoid.<br>Who was it that said there's no such thing as summer again?</br>  <br>I kind of liked the artstyle, but everything else in the series was cringe-worthy.</br>  <br><br> HURR DURR IS DIFFERENT SO IS SHIT <br><br>You never change /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can easily spot cancer summer anon </br>  <br> GE anime <br> shit <br>The shit here is your post<br><br> He likes something I don't  <br> he should die <br>Calm down, edgemaster. You'll cut someone with your edge</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this rindow guy.<br>he's gonna die.</br></br>  <br>Sounds much better than being one of you bitter fucks.</br>  Help me Im 2 minutes in and I cant watch anymore  <br>Don't spoil the animefags<br>Although if he stays "dead" depends on wether they adapt the Burst story, or if they limit themselvers to cover only the vanilla game's story</br></br>  <br>But Monster Hunter is already for weeaboos.<br><br><br>Poor man's monster hunter, story is pretty generic. It's faster paced though, had fun with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Make an original story set in the same universe following some cute hunter who aspires to be as good of a hunter as the one that saved her village from a rampaging elder dragon. Along the way, she learns the value of friendship and how to use rage as fuel for her journey as she paves her path toward G rank with the blood of her quarries.</br>  The artstyle looks nice, faggots. When a videogame like Okami comes out everyone praises the art but this comes out and people shit on it. Why? It's clearly intentional.   More reprises of God and Man <br>Not even mad about the MC, just keep on delivering with the music.</br>  Ufo fags on suicide watch  <br> cute hunter who aspires to be as good of a hunter </br>  That was really good, but the lack of Alisa is worrying.<br>She's barely in the OP. Why the fuck do they think we're even watching this?</br>  <br>Why? I'm a ufofag and I liked it.<br>Keep trying to force the meme of it beign shit, though</br></br>  <br>It's because she's so awful she can't bring herself to kill popos, because they're "cute."</br>  <br>JUST DO IT</br>  <br>SUDDELY APEX TIGREX</br>  <br>but I like Hibike</br>  <br> Everybody saw SnK selling, it was obvious as hell. <br> Good thing Japan hates God Eater as well. <br>Rage Burst 2 sold really well. And the Vita version especially had decent legs</br></br></br>  <br> implying it isn't horrible <br><br>Are you this deluded, kid?</br></br></br>  <br>Seek help.</br>  <br>name one thing bad about it that isn't that it looks like CG when it isn't</br>  imo games made into anime never really well tbh   there's like 2 guys constantly on this thread trying to convince everyone that this episode was the worst thing ever <br><br>This is how you choose to spend your Sunday.</br></br>  <br><br> stop liking what i don't like <br><br>We have a big faggot here</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was REALLY good. Stay mad.</br>  So can I skip this shit or not?  if you an chose the another anme studio foe this who woul you chose?  this was really pretty shit mates  <br><br>madhouse</br></br>  <br>yeah, it's not worth bothering imo tbh</br>  I liked ,but need more of best girl   Kanon    <br>Capcom dosent have the money for that.</br>  <br>Is it okay if I masturbate to her?</br>  When will nips stop saying "Goddo"? "Gaud" or "Goud" would be closer to the correct pronunciation...  <br> imo <br> tbh <br>I don't think he wanted any opinions from dumb normies like you.</br></br></br>  <br>This. Needs more Kanon, and Second Unit in general.</br>  <br>This is the shittier one though</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989211 <br><br>so epic</br></br>  <br>tbh that was uncalled for</br>   a minute and 13 seconds in <br><br>What the fuck is this shit?</br></br>  <br>ur being rly rude right now dude</br>  <br>Wit</br>  But Lenka is a girl's name.  <br><br>tbh you must be new imo, if you don't know why tbh you are</br></br>  <br>would have been if it wasn't so pretentious and predictable</br>  <br>Thanks I worked hard on that meme</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989313 <br><br>We quoting reddit now? Please...</br></br>  <br>You fucking retard. MH is Capcom's property. GE is Bandai Namco.<br>Bandai Namco employed Ufotable to make anime, they are paying and getting revenues. Animation studios don't pick up things to animate by themselves.</br></br>  <br> ... </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989313 <br>Maybe it's because I've been watching the 3rd season of Hannibal but I think they could pull back on the amount of slow motion scenes. It's nitpicky though.</br>  <br>Not with that filename</br>  <br><br>it's your new CGI-2D overlord, Ufotable once again innovating and showing how they're 20 years ahead of everyone.</br></br>  <br>it almost feels like they just want to drag it out with this kind of slo-mo. Nigga you're not even fighting right now, stop going slo-mo</br>  <br>Emphasizes the movement he does to show you he's fast.</br>  <br>it would be faster if they just let him go full sonic the entire way</br>  Great opening episode. I forgot ufotable was doing this; the animation and production values are great. Good direction too.<br><br>Overall I'm excited for this.</br></br>    Maybe that's because I'm sleepy but evertything feelt slow as fuck and I don't mean slow-mo scenes: the dialogues and characters interactions, the way everyone reacts to something, even the battles  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989775 <br>Summer is real</br>  <br>That would just show him being fast. They specifically showed his veins/nerves pop out and turn red, which I'm guessing signifies the power of the bracelet activating. They also did that effect with the God Arc lighting up before it transformed. They want to emphasize that he's fast, but also that he was activating something</br>  Is Alisa and Kota a oficial pairing.In the first game Alisa is tsundere for kota.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989775 <br>confirmed for cancer</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989775 <br> Forum <br> ... <br> Reddit </br></br></br>  <br>So is IRC.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989775 <br> top rated post <br>oh my fucking god you cannot be serious</br></br>  I also love the art style. I haven't seen a more visual appealing style like that in some time.  I was planning to just drop it and forget this shit show with horrible visuals, but seeing the horrible fanbase, now i feel it's my duty towards the board to shitpost every thread i see until we drive the 9 retards that actually like this shit into reddit or wherever you came from, possibly tumblr too, same as with space dandy.  <br>Keep up the good fight kid</br>  <br>nice meme<br><br>no one cares</br></br></br>  <br> People can't like what I dislike <br>You need to be 18 to post here</br></br>  <br>Actually I always imagined the MC in the game was more the silent type like from Persona but the anime gave the MC the Eren personality from AoT.</br>  <br><br> this easily baited  <br><br>heh, /v/ermins</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mentioned it being a meme for a reason.</br>  <br>rude lol</br>  Embarrassing, baffles me how ufotablefags still defend this show full of cgi.<br><br>This episode pretty much confirm that KyoAni deliver the best animation anytime anywhere</br></br>  <br>lol got em</br>  <br>IRC is a myth.</br>  <br><br> this easily baited <br>At least try to make it hard /v/ermin, the faggots from /co/ may be sjw fujos but they recognize easy baiting.</br></br></br>  <br>of course</br>  <br>Ufos already committed sudoku</br>  <br>fatefags and ufofags are on deadwatch</br>    <br> /a/ is studio wars now. <br>Please stop this</br></br>  <br>I haven't even watched this show or played this game, I'm just funposting</br>   CGI shit <br> SnK storyline <br> this MC <br> this artstyle <br> I expected nothing and i'm still let down <br><br>I'm out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani <br> in charge of anything but boring shit <br>Who cares about the animation if it's wasted on boring crap?<br>Also, GE isn't CGI except for the aragami. <br><br> I was just pretending to be retarded <br>Fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990358 <br>For the last time: CGI is only for the aragami. This is getting shitposted to hell and back because everyone forgot about the best girl, so careful.</br>  I think I'm better off making a thread on /v/ about the anime  <br>the thumb is on the other side, its just a shadow</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990427 <br>Yes, the horrible quality is blatant. Besides a good fighting scene that is the only good thing Ufo can do, it's pretty mediocre. <br><br>but then reddit/mal is all over here saying "I liked It", "different artstyle, you just don't get It" what makes things even more embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br> now <br>Lurk more kid, What was the kyoani/shaft divide of 2012?<br>This is more of a fanbase thing though, i find this show as cancerous as its fanbase.</br></br></br>  This is the worst MC I've had the misfortune of experiencing recently. So many non-character pieces of shit lately. It's like they can just throw pieces of cardboard in and sell it now.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990427 <br>People like stuff, yes<br> redditor garbage <br>what the fuck does that even mean? Are you so desperate you have to resort to the reddit boogeyman?</br></br></br>  Remember to report shitposters. Looks like their awful thread died so they are migrating to this one.  <br>Yes please, also stay there.</br>  <br>MAL hates it and calls it CGI</br>  Can someone give a straight answer as to why the art style is supposedly horrible?<br><br>I haven't played the game and don't play much vidya at all, so I wouldn't know. I thought it looked great.</br></br>   human weapons called God Eater <br> GOD eater <br>why is Japan so fucking edgy?</br></br>  <br> People who like what I dislike are from MAL and Reddit <br>Why can't you accept people liking things you don't?</br></br>  <br>oh thanks god, although, i dont think CGI isnt neccesarrly bad, i think its a good choice they made aragami with it, they are so complex they would end up just simplfying it or showing them very rarely if they were to draw it</br>  just finished watching it, art style is fine if not great<br><br>but holy shit, lay off the slo-mo would you?</br></br>  <br>Why can't you accept people with solid opinion who have been here longer than you disliking things you like?</br>  Sariel is my aragaifu.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127980445 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127980445 <br>Thread OTY</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990642 <br>Being garbage doesn't validate shitposting.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990684 <br> Dandy suffered it, same with SAO <br><br>Great series there, /v/ermin newfag.</br></br></br>  <br> MAL hates it </br>  Can you just post Alisa?  <br>It's a play off the fact that the aragami cells fused with religious statues thus they became associated with gods.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990684 <br>Anime is disallowed on /v/, you fucking retard</br>  <br><br>great with cereal on a saturday morning.<br>maybe disney channel after this.</br></br></br>  <br> solid opinion <br> WAAAH, PEOPLE WHO LIKE WHAT I DISLIKE DON'T BELONG IN MY SECRET CLUB <br> The above is a solid opinion <br>Whatever you say, faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>the artstyle is nowhere fine anon</br>  I'm actually really digging the visuals.<br>The setting and characters turn me off though.</br>  Why is a Major overseeing the training of two Privates? And why is she so scantily clad?  <br>it looks cool as shit</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken ranking updates daily, wait for tomorrow.<br>Also if you are logged in, STAY THERE</br></br>  <br>How does that pic prove anything?</br>  <br>Never said they were good, i actually support the whole idea since i've yet to like an /a/ forbidden show. It is true it's the autist population driving it out, and the reddit links and obvious crossboarder slang don't help this poor newshits.<br>I'm guessing it's mainly shifted reddit populations from whatever is happening over there with their administration that don't know /a/ is extremely autistic when it hates something.</br></br>  <br><br> Why is a Major overseeing the training of two Privates? <br><br>Lack of manpower.<br><br> And why is she so scantily clad? <br><br>It's God Eater, all the characters are scantily dressed, even the men.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Working s3 is at rank 520, they're about the same, unless you want to say that MAL hates Working</br>  <br> it looks like shit <br>Yeah I agree. Never seen multiple tone shading fucked up so bad.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990844 <br> fanbase argument <br/></br>  <br>it wouldn't be so bad if they actually paid attention to where they were putting the shadows. He looks so fucking blocky.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127989775 <br><br><br> this is the kind of people who will comment on these threads. </br></br></br>  <br>Alisa a shit ,Gina a best</br>  <br>You mean give up by ep 3 and go to /v/ and reddit</br>  <br>It's like they just drunkenly shaded everything without respect to any sort of logic.</br>  Somehow this was extremely boring.  <br>It looks generic as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Gina is fine and also welcome, friend, but Alisa is still where it's at.</br></br>  Why am I the only one not bothered about the shading?<br><br>I thought this episode looked super pretty. And I like the show-don't-tell approach for the storyline.<br><br>Can /a/ please start liking things you're all boring cunts</br></br></br></br>  The artstyle is horrid, not even the clouds look good, is ufo saving staff for ToZ and HF? Normally i like their stuff despite what /a/ says, but this is shit.<br><br>Nevermind the fact that lookin pretty was all this had going.</br></br>  <br> GE anime means another surge of Alisa porn </br>    <br><br>They like having fun playing with shit there i hear</br></br>    <br><br>This is a good thing. I really am looking forward to more Alisa doujins. There are never enough and certainly not enough good ones.</br></br>   that pacing <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br> Why am I the only one not bothered about the shading? <br>You're not.</br></br>  MUST KILL ALL TITANS  <br> Space Dandy <br> Bad <br>It was great, you faggot<br>I agree with you about SAO, though</br></br></br></br>    I love it when you mix autists with newfags that don't know how to deal with them, i'm going to enjoy the threads.  <br>He's actually a good representation of the game players<br>Why do people decide to play GE? <br>If you tell me it's not to go and kill Aragami, you're lying</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127990684 <br>Dandy threads weren't even bad after the shitposters of the first few episodes left.</br>  <br>I'm only watching this show for this girl to show up tbh</br>  <br><br>She starts off antisocial but goes full dere after her redemption arc. <br>During all those stages, she is always smoking hot.</br></br></br>  Do we know whether it's going through just the original GE plot or if it's also going to go through the Burst plot?  Nice to see that mods removed some shitposting  <br>But I'm playing GE for the delicious girls. I couldn't care less about the aragami.</br>  <br><br>It's 1 cour, so I don't see them getting to the burst storyline. Kind of a shame. Maybe they'll make it an OVA?</br></br>  <br><br>They're trying their best, but the shitposting torrent is strong.</br></br>   Shingeki no Digimon <br><br>Can sort of dig it</br></br>  <br>or they can rush it and make lindow dead next episode</br>  Annete is the truly best girl   all this concentrated shitposting  <br><br>My head hurts</br></br>  <br> SnK storyline <br>the game came out in 2010 and been in development for feew years, SnK's manga came ou tin 2009, and SnK wasnt even a "thing" until few years ago<br> CGI meme <br>only aragami is CGI and it looks fucking good<br>Artstyle is decent, they didnt fucked up anything, u might not like their design choices but they still archived what they are going for, it has great production value in it<br>You dont have to like the show but slow down on the shit-posting</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The opening was great and the artstyle looks nice in motion.  <br><br>Nah. If they rush, he'll be dead by episode 4 maybe. <br>But given the pace this episode was, I don't think they'll start rushing this early. Next episode will probably be some more training, probably by Lindow this time.</br></br></br>  I don't understand the complaints and overly antagonistic reaction over this show.<br><br> It's CGI <br>I can tell that the only CGI are the aragami, the rest of the art is just heavily stylized but still 2D<br><br> It's shit <br>That's not a valid criticism<br><br> The MC <br>It's only the first episode. How can you tell the MC sucks?<br><br>Is it the story? the cinematography? What?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, will the MC fuck Alisa?  <br>You're not, but people are almost always more vocal about things they hated than things they liked. The shading reminded me of early Shinkai stuff.<br>The thing I disliked was the CG used for the monsters.</br></br>  <br><br>They'll  hold hands. <br><br> I'm not kidding.  </br></br></br></br>  I liked it, I thought it was stylish. Nothing much to say.   watch episode 1 without any prior knowledge of the show or premise etc. <br> open a thread about it on /a/ <br> Ctrl + F "Shingeki", "Snk" and "titan" <br> several results <br>Glad I'm not the only one, /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Post more Alisa.  <br>Ufotable+unusual art+game adaptation gives autistic shitposters lots of shit to post</br>  I like it.<br><br>Oh and judging from the OP/ED, that top dog from unit 1 is going to die, right?</br></br>   mods/jans deleting criticism of the show <br><br>Why? Fucking gay ass show.</br></br>  <br>Your lack of previous knowledge is showing.</br>  <br> shitposting is criticism <br>There's a difference between<br> I think the shading looked awful and is a bad design choice <br> The plot looks generic <br> MC is generic <br>And<br> CGTABLE DOES IT AGAIN FATEFAGS LOSE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, I played the game and I'm still waiting for RB, fucking Namco.</br>  <br>After she has a freakout and MC repairs her, they Link Burst in every mission and Resonate together a few times throughout the story, if you catch my drift.</br>  <br>i really hope this show doesnt fall victim to rushing, im wathcing the first episode now and everythign seems rushed...</br>  <br>Learn to type correctly, with capitals and apostrophes, then lurk 5 years before posting again.</br>  Does /a/ seriously believe that SnK invented "humankind's last defense against monsters"? Holy shit, you people.  <br> ...  <br>I felt it was really slow, didn't cover that much from the game. <br>Will there be grinding episodes?</br></br></br>  Is Hibari worst girl  <br>I didn't finish GE. Did Lindow actually die? I just remember him getting separated</br>  <br>I just checked out the other active thread about this show on /a/ and when you Ctrl + F<br> snk <br>there are 20 entries found in the thread. Holy kek.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just a few faggots saying that, faggot.</br>  <br>It's just shitposting by newfags and summerfags, also that reddit exodus</br>   &gt;Lindow's death in second episode <br><br>Damn, they're moving quick.</br></br>  <br>HEY HIBARI, WE JUST GOT DONE!</br>  <br><br>See?<br><br>They should have installed Lindows 10</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>No. It's not even worth putting this into spoilers.</br>  <br>Wait, they are doing that so soon? I thought they would take some time to set up the team and introduce the slav.</br>  <br>It's not just the one similiarity. It's also...<br> MC's personality is exactly like Eren <br> walls surrounding the main city <br> team that's best at taking down the monsters is controlled by a COOLEST GUY <br> MC has special power <br>Face it. This show is a direct SnK ripoff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't enjoy the funposting <br><br>You are why this place sucks now.</br></br></br>  <br>The earlier story said he died, but later it was said that he was only pretending because muh missions.</br>  <br>It's just the usual shitposting method to compare target with shows that have been branded as shit</br>  <br><br>But the game came before SnK...</br></br>  <br><br>It might seem rushed, but the story didn't really move very much at all, so I can't say they were rushing as far as story goes.<br><br><br><br> implying <br><br>From the looks of it Alisa will just barely be introduced next ep.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Well, first episode already showed  the two characters that are going to die. Think they will show Lindow 'dieing' before the end?<br>Eric is going to die before early it seems, and we'll see his little sister looking for him and getting mad so they can go shopping.</br>   <br>Not in terms of popularity it didn't.</br>   CG  <br>Please die.</br>  <br> excusing studio wars /v/tier shitposting as "fun"posting <br>Fuck off back to /v/, /b/ or /sp/ cancer</br></br>  <br>But we are talking about originality, and the game came before SnK...</br>  Why did they have to make it look like a PS2 era cutscene.  <br> expecting SnK <br> got Penguindrum  <br><br>How could you be so off?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the monsters were CG, that's less CG than most mecha nowadays</br>  As someone who didn't have any expectations for it and hasn't played the game I liked the first episode.  <br><br><br>Some people on /a/ care about posting quality and try not to write like a 14-year-old in some random online chat.<br><br>I know that's not easy to understand for people like you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>m8. That would require me to type all the subs by hand because the 340p rip is on youtube.<br><br>There's got to be someone ITT who is interested in subbing episode 0.</br></br></br>  <br>It starts with only monsters anon but this is your future. <br>I boycott any show with CG, even that show a few seasons ago that was like mushishi with a little boy, I was so hyped until I saw the trailer. <br><br>I really don't understand what is wrong with pure 2D animation, the west is dead but I'll be even sadder when it happens to Anime. All CG looks like ass on it's own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The game came 1yr after chapter 1 of SnK;</br>  <br>Remember that the game took 2 years to produce, so it technically came before...</br>   Attack on Titan [...] is a Japanese dark fantasy manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. The series began in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine on September 9, 2009 <br> September 9, 2009 <br><br> Gods Eater Burst [...] is an enhanced version of God Eater, originally released exclusively in Japan on February 4, 2010. <br> February 4, 2010 <br><br>Roughly a five-month difference, but since GE probably had a longer development cycle from initial conception (full length video game vs. planning and drawing the start of a manga), the difference in release date is negligible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can somebody explain to me just how the fuck they put on clothes with those huge-ass bracelets in the way?<br><br>In this very episode MC pulls off his tight-fitting jacket and his bracelet just miraculously slips through the sleeve no problem.<br><br>You'd figure they'd give everyone poofy sleeves on their bracelet arm to mitigate this problem, right? Or just forgo sleeves all-together. For once the skimpy female outfits actually make more sense than the male equivalent. At least the armholes are big enough for the bracelets to fit through.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, what happened is that the leaders kept to themselves that Lindow turned into an Aragami. <br>The Burst storyline is about turning him back to a human</br></br>  <br><br>Pure consentrated OBARI  with a minus on "School" plot </br></br>  <br>nice fucking wall</br>   they don't actually eat gods <br>Disappointment of the season.</br>  Nice thread you guys have here  <br>looks like FF7</br>  <br>This looks like Monster Hunter but actually fun.</br>  ITT: anime a shit cg a shit but pls like it and post moar alisa  <br> clawing on a vita <br>for what fucking purpose</br></br>  <br>The real fun comes from the bullet crafting</br>  <br>Does it matter when it still looks positively terrible and will be onscreen for a long time?</br>  <br> Truly you have become a... god eater. <br>Seriously?</br></br>  <br>Don't like the movements, in Toukiden it's fucking fluid and fun to play. <br><br>This feels like monhun, not very good animation.<br><br>The artstyle is really really good tho</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was hell emulating this and playing with a keyboard. WASD + arrow keys worked fine enough for movement and regular buttons, but that made camera movement was awkward as hell.</br>  <br><br>Because japanese definition on god is different from christian god.<br>If i not mistake Aragami mean Berserking god/deity</br></br></br>  <br>The swords do actually consume aragami</br>  <br> team that's best at taking down the monsters is controlled by a COOLEST GUY <br> MC has special power <br>What a startling coincidence.</br></br></br>  <br>i have it in my vita too, is it possible to keep it being from pixelated mess?</br>  <br>Fun</br>  <br>Well it's better than nothing I guess.</br>  <br>Well, their weapons do. The monsters are called aragami where gami/kami means god, and their weapons have the ability to consume aragami so that they can use the aragami's attribute/skill.</br>  <br>the game took 2 years to make</br>  <br>Name a defence structure that is better than walls.</br>  <br>The aragami cells also fuse with religious statues</br>  <br>There's literally nothing wrong with clawing.</br>  <br>Webm for reference.</br>  <br>domes</br>  <br>Electrical pylons<br>Magma</br></br>  <br>Walls with traps?</br>  <br>Been here since 2008 and still act like a newfag, kill yourself.</br>  <br> Since the other thread is filled with shitposting. <br><br>Great job /v/ermin, there's no shitpost in this one too, but it's also filled with /v/ermins  </br></br></br>  <br>Suave motherfucker</br>  <br>UFO reaaly fucked up this adaptation, even pachinko cutscene looks better than this<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XkU<wbr>9SJpX7lM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Kota not talking about Bugarally.<br>Scrubenka almost dies against a Zygote.<br>Eric  death  not being a big joke.<br><br>I like this adaptation. Lenka is bad  for now, who knows if he's going to be worse than this episode. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you're not seriously implying that anyone who plays any form of vidya is automatically a /v/ermin.</br>  <br>first SnK chapter, year 2009<br>the START of the game deveopment 2008<br>hell the first moment i heard GE is gonna get an anime i immediately thought "Goddammit, a lot of casuals are gonna say its SnK ripoff"<br>saying that bullshit is the anime equivlent of saying all those classic bandas copy Glee songs<br>Yeah it spreading this misinformatin legitemately makes me mad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, Lindow literally MIA during first game. Burst game show what happen to him and broken braclet.<br> GE2 extra explain why the guy become Hannibal instead of Susano-o </br></br></br>   tfw her tits will be oversized in the porn <br><br>There is no happy medium, fuck me.</br></br>  I liked it. The artstyle is not something you see everyday and it looks good. I thought MC was gonna be like Eren but he was quite calm and friendly too.<br><br>Also boobs.</br></br>  <br><br>Burst is actually second game though</br></br>  A best sister.<br>A best everything.</br>  <br>But how can she be best sister when Izumi is best sister</br>  <br>She's an alcohol and it's destroying her family.</br>  I think you accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister.  <br>We're posting best sisters, not worst sisters.</br>  Best nee-san.  <br>They all have problems.</br>  <br>Kazue may be divorced but she's holding the family together pretty much on her own.</br>  <br> you will never lick Kazue's butthole after a long day of court <br><br>why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>W-what is going on here?</br>  <br>I want to take care of her.</br>  <br>W-WHAT IS HAPPENING?</br>  <br><br>He's putting heat pads on her because she has some muscle condition where she gets pain.</br></br>  <br>Oh, so that's what it was.</br>  <br>Brotherly love</br>  <br>I want to  hug her tenderly. </br>  <br> Selfish <br> Slut <br> Drunk <br> Loud <br>No she's shit. Then again all the onee-sans are..<br><br> is perfection though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cow tits <br> drunk <br> wastes money <br> isn't Izumi or Nazuna <br>Nah.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remind me, /a/. Why do they never see their mom and why does Katanashi not want to see her?  I just started watching it, but im wondering, is there actual romance at some point?  <br>She's a combination of all his sisters' worst traits and he blames her for their personal failings. She's a 7 foot tall mean, bossy alcoholic whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition.</br>  <br>It's a comedy, not romance. Things do develop with Todoroki and Sanji, eventually.</br>  <br>Assuming this season is the last one and ends like the manga does, yes there is some actual romance. Very little, but it's there.</br>  <br>Wow, that's fucked up.</br>  <br> whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition. </br>  <br>I want her to marry me and take care of me and rape me.</br>  <br><br>You guys are fucking faggots.<br><br>Nothing wrong with liking alcohol. It just means that she's a laid back girl that likes to have fun. Not necessarily a bad trait. And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br><br> implying cowtits is a bad trait <br>Fuck outta here faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to buy izumi cute dresses  <br>I haven't seen that in a while.</br>  <br> And how is she a slut if she found her one true love? <br>Ayyy</br></br>  <br>Drinking alcohol is fine, but when it's a defining trait of hers and she is seen continuously drunk, that is another. Try defending Alcoholism.</br>  <br>She's not killing or hurting anybody, just having fun. Get off her case, party pooper.</br>  <br>Alcoholism is great. The bigger issue is that she is obnoxious and incompetent while drinking and is constantly very drunk rather than simply compulsively drinking.<br>The only reason alcoholism is bad simply because it's a vice and any kind of crutch is bad whether it's cleaning or exercise. If you're reliant on it, it shouldn't be around. It's slightly worse than those because as a vice it invites other issues if done wrong but it's nowhere near as bad as stuff like gambling or stealing which are inherently damaging no matter how you look at it. <br>Alcoholism ranges from harmless to a money sink, to a health issue, to livelihood destroying/family breaking for sure but it still has range.</br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  When she eventually snaps...  <br><br><br><br> being a useless drunk is cool! <br><br>I like this. Being a Foreman at work I already know who the drunkards are and assign them the most work. Their pissing, bitching and moaning while they sweat like whores in church is most gratifying. Vowing to not drink again only to get shitfaced that night and come in drunk/hangover and then I assign them more manual labor. <br><br>It sustains me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  drunk waifu is best waifu  <br>Look at this square ass faggot. I bet you have no friends and no one likes you.</br>  <br>Are you my dad, because he's been doing this to his crew for like 30 years.</br>  i want to be pet by takanashi-kun  <br> divorced <br>No man likes a bossy cunt. MC has good life lessons from his sisters though. He knows what type of women to completely avoid.</br></br>  <br>what if it is your dad</br>  <br>This should bother me why? Unless you'd like to work for me? Come on over.<br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br>Not saying it should bother you, just pointing it out. You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life while people have fun. To each their own.</br>  <br>Not going to work drunk and/or severely hungover isn't living a "no fun allowed" life, it's just being a base-level functioning member of society.</br>  <br>If this is baitoza, then it's the bait of the baits, one-shots both Gilgabait and Baitrou.<br><br>No seriously salsa plz? Is this real life or a sea of Fanta?</br></br></br>  <br> You can be happy in your pathetic, miserable ''no fun allowed'' life <br><br>I am happy thank you. But you, you stay buttblasted over my work ethic lazy deadbeat bum.</br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough, but it's not like Kozue goes to work hungover so why did the faggot bring work into the whole conversation in the first place?<br><br><br>I don't give a fuck about your work ethic, It's not like I'm working for you.</br></br></br></br>  Do people actually find alcoholics appealing?  <br>You should since you sound like a spoiled little brat. A good day's manual labor while get that terrible shit outta you.</br>  <br>Only when I'm fucking them senseless in the bathroom.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br> I accidentally posted a picture of the wrong sister. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br> only when I'm masturbating furiously into my hand at the thought of having sex with an alcoholic whore </br>  <br>It'll be glorious. too bad we'll never see it.</br>  <br>I do. They are fun and laid back characters. What's not to like.<br><br><br> that reaction image <br>Why are there two people on there? There should be only one considering you have no friend to laugh at people with. Stay sadlife.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hinami was so damn cute this episode I mean holy shit HNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNG  So, FFF or DDY?  <br> no man likes a bossy cunt <br>You DID watch the newest episode right?</br></br>  <br> No man likes a bossy cunt <br>I dunno man, given her ex-husband's extreme masochism, she might have not been nearly bossy enough for him.</br></br>  <br> she has some muscle condition <br>It's called "not doing fuckall" in layman's terms. She had those heat patches put on, because her muscles were sore from walking a few blocks.</br></br>  <br>Only 2D ones.</br>  泉ねえわかわいい！！！<br>ね<br>え<br>わ<br>か<br>わ<br>い<br>い<br>！<br>！<br>！</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> わ </br>  <br> No man likes a bossy cunt <br>What a faggot</br></br>  <br> There should be only one considering you have no friend to laugh at people with. <br>I'm laughing at you bum boy.<br> sadlife <br> Making drunkards work their ass off, sweating out their liquor and beer only to make them do it again the next day <br> sadlife <br><br>Hardly sissy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to pet Yamada.</br>  <br> whose boozing led to complications in Izumi's birth, causing her to develop a degenerative muscle condition. <br>Kek<br>Well baited friend.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what happens when you type fast and don't look at what you're writing</br>  <br>Wait, people on /a/ watch anime? I thought we all just saved images and then bullshitted our way through each thread.</br>  <br>There you go. That's a reaction image worth of a sadlife like yourself.</br>  <br> They are fun and laid back characters <br>Most of the time in fiction they're played off as noisy and obnoxious.<br>Just like half the time in real life.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, there are people on /a/?</br>  <br> Defending drunks <br>Your mom does meth doesn't she</br></br>  <br>That's only true for 80% of the threads.</br>  <br>m.3.3.w</br>  <br> thinking not being a drunk is sadlife <br>I fucking have you now. Give it up, throw in the towel. A clever ruse you played but now I hold the deck with the high cards.</br></br>    <br> not liking drunk woman <br>You gay nigga?</br></br>  <br>Kozue doesn't go to work at all. She's even worse than a drunk person with a job.</br>    <br>Gay nigga? You looking for some friends or something?</br>  <br> looking for friends <br> on /a/ <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>They're only ''noisy and obnoxious'' if you never got drunk yourself. If you stop being a bitch, you'll find out the true meaning of having fun while not giving a fuck.<br><br><br>Nice logic. Is this a new maymay?<br><br><br>Of course you hate me. You hate everyone who can have fun. Everyone is a sadlife except you right? You wish people were as smart as you but no one's on your level. Heh, typical elitist loner with no friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No man likes a bossy cunt <br>You sure about that</br></br>  <br>Well you asked if one was gay. I assumed you were looking for some friends or something.</br>  <br>So, are you?</br>  <br><br>why is she so perfect<br><br>I want to lie on the floor next to her and hold her hand and tease her as she tries to write</br></br></br></br>  I like drinking.  <br>That's some absurd logic</br>  <br> Of course you hate me. You hate everyone who can have fun. Everyone is a sadlife except you right? You wish people were as smart as you but no one's on your level. Heh, typical elitist loner with no friends. <br><br>Where does this guy think he is?</br></br></br>  <br> ant gif <br><br>You fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>I can find some that are. Give you their addresses. Of course there is a fee.<br><br>You ever eat seaweed?</br></br></br>  <br>No bullying!</br>  <br>Nah, you just need glasses.</br>  <br>Of course he is, he on /a/</br>  <br>Ah, so you are, good, I can understand why you have weird tastes</br>  <br>I'm a horse.</br>  <br> They're only ''noisy and obnoxious'' if you never got drunk yourself. If you stop being a bitch, you'll find out the true meaning of having fun while not giving a fuck. <br>Yeah, nah.<br>Obnoxious and noisy drunks are exactly that, obnoxious and noisy. <br>It's also the one of two types of drunk portrayed in anime, the other being violent drunk. both are annoying and/or disturbing presences.<br><br>Don't go assuming that just cause you can't behave yourself while inebriated nobody can.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her control is slipping...</br>  <br>A gay horse</br>  <br>Making passes at me?</br>  <br>Nah</br>  <br>I bet she's gotten fucked multiple times while drunk</br>  <br>It's less unappealing than say, bullies, or assholes/bitches, or smokers (some can be forgiven for having great bodies/personalities/looks), etc. But you people don't cry and bitch too much about it because it's unseen.</br>  Post Yachiyos  I want to get Kozue pregnant after a long night of drinking and hot, messy, drunk sex. Then raising our child to be a functioning member of society. Probably alcoholic, but functioning nonetheless.  Why are you so angry today, /a/?  <br>Yamada wants attention first</br>  <br> today </br>  But she's a slut  <br>says who</br>  <br>Yamada is best girl</br>  Takanashi-kun must have a huge dick, considering his family and all.  <br>Smug bitch.</br>  <br>Yamada is too pure for this world</br>  <br>Wow, uncalled for.</br>  <br>Her many partners</br>  <br>lies and slander!</br>  <br><br> Best loli </br></br>  <br>Kyouko playing with her was the best thing.</br>  <br>Kyouko is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br> muh no fun allowed rules <br><br>You must be a boring faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>My  nigga </br>  <br>That's the future demon queen in disguise not the sister.</br>  <br><br>I said tease, not bully</br></br>  Onee-sans stand no chance being best sisters when Nazuna exists.  <br>Yamada can go fuck herself. With a knife.

Is it a lukewarm ending as in "They get along better but no lovers yet" or do they become lovers?<br>Haven't read the manga as I can't into moonrunes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the only resolution inami needs is jailtime</br></br>  <br>Pretty much the whole last volume is  Inami "defeating" Takanashi's sisters and saving him from his mom and then their confession.

Also, he prefers DFC.</br>  I remember when Working!! threads were full of conspiracy theories about how it's propaganda to pull us out of our NEET life, now the threads are full of normalfags.

Jack was a systematic blow out. Reiji made an effort to tear Yuya apart using Yuya's own style of play.</br>  <br>It makes sense for Shun to have this card though, like his rank ups. He said Academia was stealing their monsters.</br>  <br>Well, if he expected to go against someone arrogant from the fusion dimension like sora, who was totally into taking his shit and using it against him, it's fairly reasonable for him to have a card like that, as situational as it is otherwise.</br>  <br>We were never going to fully lose them.

All you're going to do is risk getting the thread deleted AGAIN because you can't talk about the fucking show instead of meta bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a situational card.

Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Just a heads up for you anon, if you should stumble across this post, that I've temporarily switched gears and are working on getting the Basic Dictionary of Japanese Grammar Anki deck out and uploaded in the mediafire folder with the other DoJG grammar page content. Resolved the issue of those two split lines with the second having an indent, in the usage field, with a dirty but workable <br> &lt;br /&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; <br>breaking the line and creating the indent. Expect it online within the next 24 hours, likely within the next 10 hours. <br><br> How long should decks for the other 2 volumes take? <br>The Intermediate volume is roughly a quarter way through editing and I will be putting the deck together when that is complete. Could be in a week, could be in three weeks. As the Advanced volume, well, I predict it will take roughly a month, give a week either side, after releasing the Intermediate deck, before the Advanced volume is fully edited, with give or take a few days for the deck to be released. <br><br>To give you an idea, the workflow is as follows:<br> edit docx file: fixing typos, adding missing sentences, adding formation tables, updating usage notes <br> save docx as .pdf <br> in dreamweaver copy/paste docx content into the current .html file in the mediafire account, updating content for the section <br> in exported deck/template from anki, using dreamweaver and notepad systematically fill html from tables into their formation columns; add spacing and indent to usage field from plaintext; add English sentences, volume/page information and grammar concept from plaintext; change in bulk the html tags from Japanese sentences in a text editor to correct tags for CSS colour for the concept and eventual close-deletions for a secondary card type, copy/paste Japanese into relevant fields in spreadsheet.  <br><br>Reason I've mentioned this in the more or less exact steps is to fill in the process for anyone interested in doing any of this themselves instead of waiting for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it is</br>  <br>usually used when the kanji is on its own, with some hiragana at the end (okurigana)<br><br>note, that those aren't hard "rules" or anything, so expect that to be accurate in like 80% of the words you encounter.<br>That means, without actually knowing the vocab, you can never be sure which reading is the correct one, so you should learn vocab instead of learning readings on their own.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 日も暮れて、辺りには心地よい闇が降りている。 <br>Not that guy, but does this mean "The day has grown late, and around pleasant shadows have fallen"?</br></br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Why not just put a は there then? Why a も?</br>  <br>This is what DJT does to you.<br><br>You end up autistic like this.</br></br></br>  <br>Sweet, thanks for sharing the info with us. Looking forward to the decks.</br>  <br><br>も　gives the sentence a context, it' implying that other thing have happened that's related to the sun going down. basically it's just making the flow of the story better.<br><br>Also, 日が暮れるis usually used withが and not　は</br></br></br></br>  <br>but those are literally the first two lines, there is no context.</br>  <br>I don't see any problem with it being related to the first sentence...<br>Think of it as an "also" or "too" if that helps.</br></br>  <br>Stop reading it like you're a machine.</br>  <br>Explain to me how to not do it like a retard then, either it makes sense to me or it doesn't</br>  <br>If you use が it seems like they day grew late from then and that time might have passed<br>. も makes it obvious that there is no time gap.</br></br>  <br>If you already understand the difference it does seem like a small ting to get this confused about, but as a beginner things like these can be really confusing.</br>  <br>So it implies a connection to something unsaid. This is not an uncommon thing, you better get used to it. Basically, as the others have said, don't think so hard about it, rather _feel_ the sentence. The も doesn't change the meaning, but it adds depth, the sun going down is not the only thing happening, the whole atmosphere is changing. It adds ambiance in a way.</br>  Are there many good RPGs with Furigana? Or is it inhibiting language learning by relying on it?  <br>But how would I have known that if I didn't ask?<br><br>Nowhere in any grammar book I've read or J&gt;J dictionary I've read has it ever said anything about ambiance.</br></br></br>  <br>日も暮れて、人々も家に帰っていって。。。<br><br>Something like that maybe?</br></br></br>  <br>You could have realized it yourself, English works in a similar way.<br><br>Day has ended and...<br>Day has already ended and...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying the も has a definition relating to ambiance that you would find in a dictionary.

The Japanese language has thus a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages. The Japanese language is also uniquely vague. Foreigners who speak it fluently therefore, may be correct in their usage, but the thinking behind it remains inalienably soaked in the alien framework of their original language's thought patterns. This is the Japanese version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, according to which grammar determines world-view.  <br>Huh, I had no idea it had furigana, especially since it's a doujin game. I'll check it out.</br>  <br>On the other hand people can grow up equally fluent in very different languages. Such as Japanese and English.</br>  <br> 1. The Japanese race is a unique isolate, having no known affinities with any other race. In some versions, the race is understood as directly descended from a distinct branch of primates. <br> 2. This isolation is due to the peculiar circumstances of living in an island country cut off from the promiscuous cross-currents of continental history, with its endless miscegenation of tribes and cultures. The island country in turn enjoys a sui generis climate whose peculiar rhythms, the putative fact for example that Japan alone has four distinct seasons, color Japanese thinking and behaviour. Thus, human nature in Japan is, peculiarly, an extension of nature itself. <br> 3. The Japanese language has thus a unique grammatical structure and native lexical corpus whose idiosyncratic syntax and connotations condition the Japanese to think in peculiar patterns unparalleled in other human languages.

This is the Japanese version of the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis, according to which grammar determines world-view. <br> 4. Japanese psychology, influenced by the language, is defined by a particular cast of dependency wishes or desires that conduce to a unique form of 'human relationship', in which clearly defined boundaries between self and other are ambiguous or fluid, leading to a psychomental and social ideal of the fusion of ego and alter. <br> 5. Japanese social structures consistently remould human associations in terms of an archaic family or household model characterized by vertical relations, clan, and (foster-)parent-child patterns. As a result, the individual cannot properly exist, since groupism will always prevail. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some weeabo shit if I ever saw it.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon<wbr>jinron#Specific_theses_of_Nihonjinr<wbr>on</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Has the retard who wrote this ever actually interacted with Japanese people outside of any sort of formal setting?</br>  <br> Japan alone has four distinct seasons <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of this.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ameri<wbr>can_exceptionalism<br>Everyone likes to imagine themselves as being special.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>This is endlessly repeated by Japanese even today. Exchange students coming to my university from Japan never fail to mention it. It's kind of a running joke nowadays among students that care of them. <br><br>Anyway, it's supposed to mean that due to the Japanese islands being very horizonally oriented - aka going from north to south - you can at any given moment experience all 4 seasons at some 4 places in Japan.

But I'll hand it to Japan though, their 4 seasons are very distinct. I have 4 seasons in my country as well but at times autumn and spring can be interchangeable. That's not really the case if we look at Kyoto, with snow during winter, the mild to hot spring filled with sakura, the disgustingly hot and humid summer and mild autumn with bretty guud 紅葉 (where I live, shit just turns yellow and falls off). Are Japan unique in this sense though?

Want to wait for the price to drop because I'm not paying like $80 for it.</br>  Why do people try to avoid generalizations so much when they're teaching a language nowadays? <br><br>For example, if you look at some older learning resources then they say things like, "Japanese is a SOV language. To English speakers, the way that Japanese people arrange their thoughts will seem funny and nonsensical at first but you will eventually get used to it." while newer learning resources go so far out of their way to avoid making any generalizations that it reads more like, "Japanese is not an SOV language, as some ignorant bigots used to suggest, but it sometimes can choose to use an SOV word order. It can also use an OSV word order, and sometimes it will just be an adjective, and then this exception is also possible, and this one, and this exception as well. Above all else though, Japanese word order is NOT backwards or "not normal" in ANY WAY. That is a bigoted Eurocentric hate speech."<br><br>It's such a clusterfuck and for months I was misreading fundamental basic things about sentences because they go so far out of their way to make sure that you are aware of all the exceptions and that you don't generalize that you end up not knowing much of anything. Isn't one of the most important parts of language learning about noticing patterns and what is a generalization if it isn't a common observable pattern?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pick a better textboom, m8.</br>  <br>It's time to start using J-J grammar sources, mate.</br>  <br>I can't imagine the fucked up thought processes it took you to reach that conclusion from his post.</br>  <br>link to this doujin?</br>   be hiki neet trying to learn japanese <br> mom invited a bunch of people over and are making noise <br> will probably force me to introduce myself to them at some point <br>Fuck being a hiki NEET is hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Just search がんばるぞい　on pixiv.</br>  <br>He was complaining about his textbooks having a lack of focus so I suggested trying some J-J material.

It's sad, but the west feels like it's in a mini dark age right now and if you want information that is useful and not batshit crazy or incomprehensible because of PC nonsense then you have to go back to before the 60s or look at what's being taught in the East. <br><br>Education has gone to shit and Common Core is a perfect example of that. Psychiatry has completely lost it and in my mind the only legitimate DSM is the one from 1952. Everything after that is tainted with identity politics.

I actually don't understand how you can see imperative in this.</br></br></br>  <br>No it's not.</br>  <br>Someone telling you to not do something. Imperative meaning you do. Negative imperative to not do something.</br>  <br><br>To add on these, here's something I just read elsewhere:<br> "I told him not to X" -- "(not to) X" -- I told him something, which meant that he shouldn't do X, or to do something else in place of doing X; but not necessarily to explicitly not X, though I could have <br> "I told him to not X" -- "(to not) X or to (not X)" -- I told him, in particular, not to do X <br><br>Basically the general negation vs specific negation is the right distinction.

I think 99% of the time "Don't want to" is used, it would also be with the right side, meaning the same as "Want not to". But if you emphasize it right, you could say things like "Well I don't *WANT* to be an astronaut" implying it's not really your desire but you'd be chill with it if it happened. I think that's a very small minority of cases though. Here we don't really say "want not to" to begin with.</br>  How do you change the default deck?

Besides, from a business standpoint, it's easier to get more money and a stable group of players from single otaku dudes. The same reason why idol groups don't allow public dating: fans wouldn't play so much or spend so much without the self insert content.</br>  I cannot sexualize Yukikaze at all.  I think Yukikaze would've been a much better MC than Fubuki, but at the same time I'm glad she wasn't the MC because the anime would've ruined her.  <br> plenty of blatant, in-your-face yuri content <br> plenty </br></br>  <br>Then what's her pseudonym(s) for eroge?</br>  <br>北川ちんちん</br>  <br><br>The only time I've found her sexual is in the Yukimi manga where Tokitsukaze is a slut and Yukikaze just goes with it.</br></br>    <br>Me neither.</br>  <br><br>Look at more R-18 art.</br></br>  <br>I can.</br>  <br>Why would I do that?</br>  <br><br>Why wouldn't you do that?</br></br>  For some reason Yukikaze underperforms quite hard here.  <br>Did you type this wrong?</br>  <br>The cutest for me</br>  TSUKURU TSUKURU  <br>Your luck is bottlenecking her luck.</br>  <br><br>There's better Kazes to fap to.</br></br>  <br>GF Kari CM turned into yandere ship kari.</br>  <br> marrying a low res .PNG <br>I am so jealous right now</br></br>  <br>Yukikaze has cleared more event maps for me using her torpedos of maximum crit than I can remember.

No.  <br>Why not anon. Frankly, harems are fun to watch and even if we call them shit, they can be fun to watch.</br>  Harem isn't really a genre.   patrician <br><br><br>And no, harem is the bread and butter of anime.</br></br></br>  <br> Make sweet love with blonde on the left, <br> Have Redhead suck my cock, <br> Tie up loli in the middle and fuck her crazy with toys, <br> Doggystyle all night with blue hair on the top, <br> Tittyfuck black hair on the right, bully her, <br> Marry Rei Ayanami, because she is best girl. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if you want theory confirmation. It can be fun to predict all the things you expect out of the whores and see them do it time and again.</br>  This is patrician taste  <br><br>It is not a genre anyway.</br></br>  <br><br>No that's shit taste.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127977080 <br> I fit in now, right guys? </br>  <br>If with patrician you mean pleb then yes</br>  <br>For me it is, I enjoy harems to the max, especially To Love Ru's franchise. Yabuki's art is just unmatched. I have really good taste in manga/animes so it's a one up. Sometimes they are shit, but I just don't watch it then.</br>  <br> Hating cakes <br>Shit taste detected</br></br>  Harems in generale no, but To love-ru is a manga only liked by the most patricians of men. And the elite among the elites have Mikan as their waifu.  <br> Riko &amp; Cakes at bottom <br> B-Tier not higher <br> Momo so high </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127977080 <br> waa~ the shit I like doesn't sell <br>sucks to be you</br></br>  <br>SLUT</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> It contradicts to my taste <br> SHIT, I...ITS SHIT TASTE BAKA </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well done, Captain Obvious.</br>   there are people on this planet who believe Momo is not the best   <br><br>Sorry to break it to you, but you actually do have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>I'm not the poster of that list dude, i'm just pointing out your stupidity</br>  <br> a slut is anything good <br>No</br></br>   being loyal and lusty equals being a slut <br><br>Chilren of /a/ never ceise to amaze me.</br></br>  <br>At least all that shit taste is condensed into a single post.</br>  I started this series having no idea that the fourth season just came out. Funny how that works.  <br>1. Harem is not a genre<br>2. Even if it was, it's a type of anime that purposely targets the lowest common denominator.<br>3. Sales aside, harem series are filled to bursting with fanservice, shameless waifubaiting, and are more or less written as thinly disguised (or sometimes not disguised at all) wish fulfillment power fantasies.</br></br></br>  <br>Captain? I thought he got promoted to Admiral or Supreme Fleet Commander. Or was it archmage?</br>  Harems are great lightweight comedies, especially if you find stupid cliches humorous and love dere girls, like I do.  <br><br> plebs with shit taste that are upset that /mu/ has better taste in music </br></br>  those girls should check their posture  <br><br><br>Momo is such a great girl. She does so much for Rito out of love that I feel bad that Rito has to share his love over a harem and not focusing solely on Momo.</br></br></br>  I much prefer harem series with very visible romantic progress and character development. The only ones I can think of are High School DxD, Mushoku Tensei and Umi no Misaki.<br><br>In TLR, the fanservice and humor are its only redeeming factors.</br></br>  <br><br>in rome most patricians did have harems, so i guess in a literal sense yes.<br><br>in a figurative sense, no. harems are shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Everybody talks about how Nisekoi is shit and nothing happens <br> To-Love-Ru is a raunchy Sci-Fi version with absolutely nothing happening and every pleb sings praises about it. </br></br></br></br>  <br> 1. Harem is not a genre <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hare<wbr>m_(genre)</wbr> <br>Hurrr</br></br></br>  <br>Nisekoi doesn't try to break the rules with its fanservice in subtle ways.</br>  <br> absolutely nothing happening <br> Actually kisses original love interest <br><br>Pick only one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Nisekoifags <br><br>TLR is a legendary manga.</br></br></br>  <br><br>TLR is super interesting</br></br>  <br> Nisekoifags </br>  <br>Everyone belongs in S+ you filthy homo.</br>  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  Harems are usually shit, but they create great doujins so I have overall neutral feelings about the genre.  <br>With fanservice through the roof, the praises can be sung for an eternity.</br>  <br>1. The pleb / patrician dichotomy doesn't leave much in the way of discussion, in fact it actually disintegrates it<br>2. I am confident that my tastes are better than anyone else on that board (except for /classical/)</br></br>  <br> not recognizing Momo <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Don't fall for the troll trying to set two fanbases against one another.</br>      This was my gateway drug.  <br>same here<br><br>...or maybe ranma 1/2, if that counts</br></br></br>  <br>It's romance for boys.<br><br>At least I can't really get into your average girl romance story. Where there quickly forms a couple and then there's only 'drama'. I really like how they fall in love and figure out their feelings. They are meant for each other, they are happy together, they love each other, who cares about those minor problems during the relationship.<br><br>Any love story for boys would be really short, since falling in love is something that happens fast. So to have a romance manga for boys that last more than ~20 chapters there are harems. Where you can have a cycle of characters falling in love over and over again and spend time thinking about their feelings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try "House of the Sun". For a shoujo romance it was cute and interesting.</br>  <br>No, but it's more patrician than all of the shonenshit 95% of /a/ watches these days.</br>  <br>no, but kotegawa is</br>  It's such a funny feeling that I recognize every single character posted here from the literal 100+ h-doujins I've read of To Love-Ru. Never touched the official works.  <br>DON'T, as much as I want to say you're missing out on some very very sexy moments. The Blueballing is just so hard in the both series that you'd love the h-doujins to death. Also I check them all out too. Good to see someone with my same taste. We could be friends.</br>  <br>I hope Yui is the main character of the TLR series after Darkness.</br>  <br> friends <br> with an /a/non <br>Boy what's wrong with you? The loneliness getting to your head?</br></br></br>  <br><br> The Blueballing is just so hard in the both series that you'd love the h-doujins to death <br><br>It is the reason why I avoid echii anime. Like that one with the white haired siblings, I forgot the name, it just annoys me when they don't go all the way. Might as well just read up stuff with no restrictions, especially when god-like artists like 40010Prototype are making doujins of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dream of a harem ending where he marries all the girls  but procreates with yui </br>  <br>That would be the only sensible course to take.</br>  <br> watching non-H anime for H reasons <br>Well, gee.</br></br>  <br>I dream of a harem ending where he marries all the girls  and impregnates everyone. </br>  <br>YnS? There is no blueballing there - the MC fucks every girl except the normie.</br>  <br>Try School Days. The Based protagonist impregnates virtually everyone &amp; everyone's mom.</br>  <br>Campione! isn't half bad but while harem-y it is far less sexual than dxd</br>  <br> not yui on S+ <br>into the trash it goes</br></br>  Momo is fit to be a slave concubine, NEVER a main wife.  <br>I can see her calling dibs on carrying the first child.</br>  <br>They're similar to eating a bag of snacks instead of having a real lunch.</br>  <br> dinner, bath, or maybe m-me?? <br><br>why always the same fucking question</br></br></br>  Harem is one of the entry level genres of anime. If you look on netflix half of the anime on it are harem and the other half are generic shounen.  <br><br>Yeah but it is not explicit, is it? I actually want to see the fucks.</br></br>  Sorry but I really fucking hate harems, always have, probably because I'm too much of a normie or are plebs all over harems now, too, effectively making me too little of a normie nowadays?  Haremshits are battle shounen tier. The scum of the anime, the bottom of the barrel.  <br>That is the mating call of the Salaryman's Mousewife.</br>  <br>That's not moeshit/idolshit/girlshit</br>  <br/>  Harem and moe is literally the only reason to watch anime. Everything else is done better in other mediums. 'Muh intellectual anime' faggots need to go read a book or something.   New Harem anime <br> MC is Tiger Woods <br><br>Would you watch it?</br></br></br>  <br>biggest cue the wife is all ready to be NTR'd</br>  <br>Haremshit is a self-insert medium where the people that are irredeemable find solace.</br>  <br>This.<br>The only thing anime has going for it is the cute girls, and maybe good/different animation here and there.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> mediums <br>You're not wrong though.</br></br>  <br>I wanna snuggle with Ao.</br>  If it's not Mea (Nemesis fused), then your taste is pure shit. The femdom of Nemesis and the sex appeal and flurtaious feisty personality of Mea?<br><br>Oh my god the sex would be out of this world. &lt;3<br><br>some of you fucks just have horrible taste.</br></br></br></br>  Harem is for men of taste.    <br> Rei Ayanami <br><br>Mah negroid</br></br></br>  <br>It's a genre for those who find things like reading a book too much of a chore and would prefer to just masturbate all day.</br>  <br><br>My main problem with Harems that most of the time the author wants us to believe all this girls love the MC just because he is the MC. Also many lack any kind of male competition to spice things up.<br><br>BTW, lately i've been thinking a lot about the target audience for harems and i'm starting to think it's main target are horny 13 y o boys, not the older beta otaku.</br></br></br></br>  <br> those who find things like reading a book too much of a chore and would prefer to just masturbate all day <br>Someone whynotbothed and light novels were born.<br><br><br> i'm starting to think it's main target are horny 13 y o boys, not the older beta otaku. <br>That's my impression as well. Some of these books sell millions of copies so it's not some super niche otaku thing. More like Twilight for boys.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is X Drake, a fucking T-Rex, the most mature character in the entire one piece universe?  I really want to know what this semen demon is up to  <br><br>As we were shown, eating pizza and reacting to newspapers.</br></br>  <br>This, though he's probaly grateful Doflamingo did kill his dad on some level.</br>  Yea, Drake's kind of a badass like that. He stopped Urouge and Killer from going nuts too. He seems like a calm, mature, cool-headed person. Which will all change once Luffy arrives.  <br>yeah, but what is her agenda, goal or plan? hiding from the marines forever?</br>  <br>taking advantage of being a loli like usually</br>  <br>Perhaps trying to find a way to reform her crew.</br>  <br>We know that she is without a crew at the moment and lives like a hobo, thats it.</br>  <br><br> I'm calm and mature and cool-headed guys, I definitely won't underestimate the SH <br> where have we heard this before <br> turns into a T-Rex and goes ape-shit <br> Gets Konged </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drake will fight Luffy <br>Why do I have such a hard time picturing this ? Drake seems like honorary nakama material to me, same as Law.</br></br>  can't wait for the moment Enel fucks Luffy and Kidd's fight up by electrocuting the latter through the shitton of metal things he uses as his arm just because.<br><br> just kidding, I don't think that's going to happen, it may just be the case if Luffy were about to be horribly defeated </br></br>  Nevermind that, can I find a 793 translation that's not dogshit?  <br><br>I get the feeling Drake is going to get Law'd pretty hard when the time comes</br></br>  I am already looking forward to Luffys reaction when he sees the dinosaur  <br><br>I know, it was just the King Kong vs T-Rex/Godzilla etc. thing I was thinking of.</br></br>  <br>I think Drake would just pet Chopper and smile like the cute he is in this situation.</br>  <br> Drake learned how to use Awakened version of his fruit, becomes Godzilla for Kong Luffy to fight </br>  <br>Nah, the most mature character is a giraffe zoan.</br>  Why commissioner Gordon fights crime?  <br>But awakened Zoans make you look like a retard</br>  <br> Kidd alliance attacks Shanks.  <br> Everyone of the alliance is wiped out, fodder from the other side. Only Kidd is left <br> Kidd gathers all the weapons lying on the ground for a final desperate attack <br> Fuckin' Vari out of nowhere. <br>Turns out, Enel came back down and joined Shanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes a lot of sense. And in Wano it makes even more sense, I think you are on to something, even without Godzilla awakening. Oda should make Luffy fight someone from his own generation already. And seeing how Kaidou is on sight, and Drake is working under him, it all makes sense. <br><br>Now I'm really hyped.</br></br></br>  <br>It's better than fighting  your grammar. </br>  <br>But Kid's gonna use Enel as an electromagnetic weapon/pet.</br>  <br>I see, but if the GCPD is in big part responsible for the city's state then he has no right to do it.</br>  <br>Your only option is Viz and manga stream.</br>  Will Law stick with the Strawhats until they take down Kaido? Or will they split ways until it's time for the next phase of the plan?  <br>Enel won't join anyone, he is going to take over Urogue's crew and be a pirate captain.</br>  <br>Because he wants to share his meat with everyone.</br>  <br/>  <br>Because the dynamic duo are useless.</br>  <br>They'll won't be in Wano but they will be when the time is nigh.</br>  <br>My point is: Fujitora is wrong.</br>  <br>What gives a human rights to fight crimes? Being called hypocrite (he's not a hypocrite, mind you) is better than playing blind.</br>  <br>yes, Laws crew is on Wano and Kaidou is pissed at Law now</br>  <br>Akainu is more wrong.</br>  <br>Law's crew in on Zou. And it doesn't look Kaido is on Wano.</br>  <br>Of course. Fujitora is still wrong though.</br>  <br>What should he do?</br>  <br>His job.</br>  Alright gentlemen<br><br>How do we kill the Red Dog marine man?</br></br>  <br><br>shes with the revolutionaries</br></br>  <br>That's wrong.</br>    Guys what do you think about matchup in Red hairs vs Kidd alliance. My guesses are:<br> Kidd vs Shanks (captain vs captain) <br> Killer vs Beckhman (vice captain vs vice captain) <br> Basil vs Lucky Roo (2 guys based on luck) <br>And i suppose Apoo vs Yasopp<br><br>I would also like to add that I think that Kidd has actually a chance to win this fight. I know that Killer is not reckless as his captain so I think they have a decent plan. The problem comes with after controlling territory after fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drake is going to get Law'd <br>I want this</br></br>  <br>Suffocate him using Barto's barrier.</br>  He does look pretty terrible in orange<br><br>Then again, everyone did <br><br>I'm convinced Law designed those jumpsuits so he'd look hotter in comparison. But after a while even he couldn't stand it, and switched everyone to black.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then to my point, Gordon is doing wrong because GCPD is corrupt. <br><br>You can't just shrug off your duties because someone somewhere in your position or higher is doing things wrong. What organization is 100% guilt free?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>did you actually draw out that idea?  I like you <br><br>Did you try white? Only Bepo is orange iirc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The wrong one is some part of the Marine itself, not Fujitora nor the Marine as a whole. By shrugging the corrupted duties he refuse to be that part.</br>  Would you pay her 100,000B?  <br>What corrupted duties?</br>  <br>Playing hero and covering the corrupted part of the Marines.</br>  <br>I'm glad people who do good don't waste time trying to figure out the science behind it. Gordon fights crime because people need help. He worries about his organization's complicity in the situation after people are safe. Fujitora knows that by repeating the events of Alabasta (the government claims responsibility for saving a place that fell victim to a pirate they employed in the first place) nothing would change and the shichibukai would continue to wreak havoc on citizens. By doing nothing now, he's hoping to destabilize the shichibukai system. He's the only one doing anything right in the government. Save the argument to obligation.</br>    <br>His plan was to bow down and make a public apology, can't he do that after doing his job? No, let vigilantes do it.<br><br><br>No need to cover anything, Akainu or the WG would cover AFTER his report. Everything was in his hands.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's actually not too bad. Hat could be a different color but I can totally see it now.</br>  <br><br>This, unfortunately.<br><br>As far as we know she's done jack shit during TS but escape and steal pizza.</br></br></br></br>  <br>very kubo</br>  <br>And read the news, pay attention.</br>  <br>If we're talking about sticking my penis into her, she would just steal my money and leave if she didn't want to do it.</br>  <br>I am so ready for X-Drake to rip someone's fucking head off.<br>I respect the simplicity of his fighting style.<br>Become T-Rex, remove head.</br></br></br>  <br> They keep asking him to turn into a dinosaur while Franky's robot coolness gets ignored </br>  <br> His plan was to bow down and make a public apology, can't he do that after doing his job? <br>No, he can't do it after doing his job, because A) doing his job would defeat his purpose and B) it needed to be done on camera so the government wouldn't have time to spin the story and make themselves look good.</br></br>  <br>Unless his father was a piece of shit he is just apathetic.</br>  <br>Which dinobots are we talking, though? <br><br>The mentally retarded G1 ones, the intelligent Dreamwave, or the IDW ones who were smart but then shockwave fucked them stupid?</br></br></br>  <br>So he can't do his job and say sorry because it was their fault? It was his camera.</br>  everyday until you like it  Is any female ever gonna be a hostile threat again?<br><br>All of them always end up joining the rubber cock alliance.<br><br>Big mum don't count tho</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm convinced Law designed those jumpsuits so he'd look hotter in comparison <br>Ah.<br><br>But he was?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he knows if he repoeted first the corrupted system will be covered and continued. It's needed to fix that system.</br>  <br>I just find the idea that drake defected from the marines after finding a cash of ancient zoans appealing.<br>Until we see his underlings in a fight my silly headcanon cannot be refuted.<br><br>I like to post it as a joke in threads so...whichever dinobots you like.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We met his father in the Corazon flashback</br>  <br> Big mum don't count tho <br>Yes she does.</br></br>  <br> So 100k for a look. <br> How much do you want for "That"? <br>And this is how Nami became a Queen.</br></br></br>  <br>Marvel UK intelligent Dinobots</br>  <br>From Sakazuki's call we all know the report was in Fujitora's control.</br>  <br> &gt;..whichever dinobots you like. <br><br>I like the IDW ones <br>They're the most fucked up. <br>Grimlock got mindfucked so much he's hanging out with a bunch of failure decepticons who scrounge for energy at backwater planets. <br><br><br>Also a great choice. Any version of Grimlock that goes to great lengths to piss off Prowl is a good Grimlock.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will we ever see Gin again?  Some post that interview with Oda about Drake origin. Then post yfw he joins Luffy's alliance.    <br>I don't think I understand exactly what we're arguing here. What is it you think Fuji did and what is it you think he should have done?</br>  <br>I know, fucking hypocrite. Corruption apologist.</br>  <br>What interview?</br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>Drake is on a collision course with Luffy/Law now.<br>Something big will happen that's for sure.<br><br>I think the issue is we know very little of Drake's motives.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's probably Mexican, so a police officer fighting crime an unusual sight.</br>  <br>The report is. The covering isn't, if he didn't control the report by not reporting first.</br>  <br> Luffy establishes some sort of alliance with Drake <br> They need to go somewhere stat <br> Luffy grabs Drakes shoulder expecting him to give him a dinosaur ride there.  <br> Drake does the Chopper-on-head-Law-face.  <br>Oda, pls</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They keep asking him to turn into a dinosau <br><br> &gt;They keep asking him to turn into a dinosaur <br><br> &gt;Luffy grabs Drakes shoulder expecting him to give him a dinosaur ride there. <br><br>Holy fucking shit.<br>Confirmed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since from what I know about Shank's crew, which is very little, all of them predominantly fight with weapons, which Kid can remove from the equation by using his DF to take all of them away. But then comes the problem of Shank's absolutely godlike Haki. If they can somehow find a way to get past that, then I think they have a shot.<br><br>The only real way I can see Kid's alliance winning is if they pull some kind of sneaky, underhanded shit</br></br></br>  <br>Birdtits didn't jump on the rubber cock.</br>  <br>I am saying that you can't shrug off your job because someone, on your level or higher is doing things wrong. Fujitora let vigilantes handle the situation because in his view he had not the right to do anything and that is bullshit.<br><br><br>I am saying he should report first then apologize?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fujitora's looking boss as fuck right now. All this talk from characters about how Akainu is bullshit and an asshole, and only Fujitora's had the balls to straight show how fucked his form of 'Justice' actually is to the world. No boasting, no fighting, just 'yeah the Marines fucked up bad.' And Akainu's so fucking butthurt about it. Delicious.</br></br>  <br>Please Oda</br>  <br>Baby 5 jumped all over fat monkey cock<br>what a fucking travesty</br></br>  <br>Yes she did. She jumped on him and decided to give him a nice cool hug</br>  <br>Fujitora is complicit in the Marine failure in Dressrosa.</br>  <br>You implied he should report here: No need to cover anything, Akainu or the WG would cover AFTER his report. Everything was in his hands.</br>  <br>To give Akainu a little credit.<br><br>This isn't so much about absolute justice as it is about letting shichibukai get away with murder.<br>It also could be said to be a knock against the celestial dragon's rule, though Akainu has also railed against that a little himself.<br><br>The angle of marine/government coverups can be laid squarely at Akainu's feet though, since it looks like that's what he would have done.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, never again, not now that Oda fully bloomed as a white knight.<br>Women will never win a single fight in One Piece from now on, and they'll always prevent the male characters from fucking their shit up by conveniently defecting/marriage/having a male character desperate for attention and ready to protect the shit out of them nearby/making their male opponent fall through a hole.</br></br>  <br>No, I said that whatever the WG or Akauni can do is after Fujitora's report, see? Fuji had everything in his hands and could do things in the order he wished. It was the same with Smoker.</br>  <br><br>In return, Akainu is talking shit to the Gorosei, something that hasn't been done before.<br><br>I was surprised to see him angrily question the WG like that, he only cares for the marines after all.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127987805 <br>   But just remember that Shachi is pure.  <br><br>Damn straight</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Probably, remember Don Krieg is most likely related to the Happou Navy<br> looks just like Sai <br> calls himself Don <br> Sai is Chinjao's grandson, without a father in sight to inherit the title of Don </br></br></br></br>   OP forever ruined by gayshit   <br><br>What, really? That's the whole point of his character; acknowledging/exposing the hypocrisy of the Marines/WG and addressing it frankly. He knows he's been complicit, hence the apology. Why the hell else would he be based on Shintaro Katsu's Zatoichi? Oda is practically beating us over the head with this shit.</br></br>  <br>Thanks obama</br>  <br>He was in control. That's why he chose not to report to prevent the attept of covering the corruption.<br><br>You said he should do his duties. What duties?</br></br></br>  <br>My condolences.<br> What are you even talking about, the gay shitposting isn't even that high in the thread </br></br>  <br>  can't he do that after doing his job? <br>He said that, as an employee of the WG, it wasn't his fight, because it was their employers the one that gave doffy all his power. Doflamingo needed to go down by the hand of pirates, not the WG because they have no right in defeating doffy and then call themselves the good guys since they were the ones allowing doffy to do al that stuff in the first place. So, to be fair, Fujitora's work was not fighting doffy, because technically, a warlord is kind of like his "college" since both are WG's employees.<br>At least that's how I see things</br></br></br>  Reminder that the mystery behind what happened to the Sanji crew and Big Mom has been resolved.  I think Zeff is my favorite One Piece character of all time  <br>Pretty much. Also, Lola and Bonney are sisters. Bonney's ship was even cake themed.</br>  <br>You have a bad gov, your house is on fire but the firefighters are like: we have a terrible gov, you do it because we have not the right. Complete jackshit.<br><br><br>To protect the citizens and remove the threat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's just for you, okay? <br>Calling it right now Big Mom and her crew will fight everybody except Nami</br></br>  <br> Leave him to his pity party. He does this any time people idolize the male characters.   Never complains about the /h/ shit that gets posted here though </br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127987805 <br>Lies and slander. Shachi pleases old men for money.</br></br>  <br>Well, Nardo is over and no one reads Bleach, now the fujos have to migrate.</br>  <br>Doffy did an attack on marines and WG officials,</br>  <br>Ok, it's easier to understand now.<br><br>The thing I think you're missing is his motivation. <br>•Fujitora wants to disband the Shichibukai. <br>•To that end, he continued to fulfill his duty as a marine and helped Doffy. (Which also furthered his cause because it made the marines look bad)<br>•Then when Doffy initiated the birdcage, instead of going after Him, Fuji pretends to be stalemated by Sabo<br>•When Doffy is defeated, Fuji prostrated himself on live camera to make sure the marines can't steal credit again for solving a problem they caused.<br><br>His motivation wasn't to spite those in higher positions with him and it wasn't really because he felt it wasn't his place (although he did feel that way), his very specific goal is to abolish the shichibukai system, and all his actions are to that end.<br><br>So to summarize, Fujitora let vigilantes handle the situation because it would help him with his goal of abolishing the shichibukai system. Even if you still think he was wrong, his motivations are a lot better than simply being petty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Magu Magu is his fruit, wouldn't be better something like "just Hie my shit up" or "just Fuji my shit up"?</br>  law is going to die  <br>Is  Jinbe  old enough?</br>  <br>Then he is more of a revolutionary than a cop. As a "cop" he is doing wrong.</br>  Post your favourite pages.  <br> orca fucked by a shark <br><br>That's taboo <br><br><br>No, Shachi is innocent and sweet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His occupation doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Is the black jumpsuit a post timeskip fashion headcanon or are they actually canon ?</br>  <br>None better.</br>  <br>Please wait. I agree with you that he should had protected the citizens.<br>But then you posted  which makes you like saying he has no right to do so because the gov is corrupted.<br>Unless you're being sarcastic there or not him at all.</br></br></br>  <br>It showed in one color cover. And now Law wears a black jacket instead of his orange shirt.</br>  <br>It does matter because if you are a cop your mission is one and as a revolutionary is another. If he is a cop then he is doing things wrong regardless of his personal view of justice.</br>  <br/>  <br>ill take that into consideration</br>  <br> the most mature character in the entire one piece universe? <br>I think he doesn't hold a grudge more because his dad was an abusive piece of shit who constantly beat him than out of maturity</br></br>  <br>I was making the contrast between Fujitora and Gordon. Gordon is doing the right thing but in OP's bizarre sense of morality and justice he is wrong.</br>  <br> That's taboo <br><br> That's what makes it hot </br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, but I can't help but feel like pointing out their hypocrisy in a naive way.</br>  <br>And further more, technically, he fulfilled his role as a cop to the letter. He sided with Doffy at every point, he captured Law for Doffy, and when birdcage was activated, he was busy fighting Sabo (which we know is just an excuse, but still not a violation of his position, as long as it looks like he was doing something). And then he spent the rest of the time protecting the citizens. If you're judging him by those standards, he did his job just as he was supposed to.</br>  <br>Of course, but he's "showing the Marine's failure" by failing as a Marine.</br>  <br>That was his uncle.</br>  <br>And the hunger games in the birdcage?</br>    <br>Cute. <br>Sanji should have stayed on that boat. He wasn't so shit when Zeff was nearby.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait, never mind. I'm an idiot.</br></br>  <br>there's only one person who's going to die if you don't shut up</br>  <br>We don't need chicks to be relevant in order to have a good story, if their only job in the story is having big tits and act like support caracters (whith the exeption of female SH who can be useful sometimes), I would be ok with that</br>  <br>Its a composite of two pages but whatever. It gives me chills every time<br> Magellan's fist closing in  <br> that look <br>I hope we never see Bon again. He made his sacrifice, it makes me happy to know he's alive and that should be the end of it</br></br></br></br>  <br> Zeff's fucking hat <br>Oda always has to shoehorn something goofy into serious moments<br><br> Sanji's face in the third panel </br></br></br></br>  <br>He never hunted anyone. That was when he was fighting Sabo. And then after that, he immediately went back to sheltering citizens from the birdcage.</br>    <br> Krieg was a weak little shit    stronger than Jozu, though  <br> gets kicked out of the Happou Navy <br> gets anally devastated  <br> travels to the weakest oceans to build himself a fleet of shitters and starts calling himself Don <br>it fits</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> poor little paramecia boy </br></br>  <br>Many of them were in a murder rampage under Doffy's direct control, his mission was to stop Doffy.</br>  <br>Baratie was the first arc I read as a kid, at the part when only Luffy and Sanji were on the ship fighting. He was my favorite for my whole OP loving childhood just for his actions in that arc<br><br>I usually hate that everyone piles it on Sanji but he really did change</br></br></br>  <br>   stronger than Jozu, though <br>fuck you m8, Krieg couldn't tackle Aokiji like a football player</br></br>  <br>Would have been better if he died a hero's death.</br>  <br>How else is he going to show it if he doesn't fail?<br>He was the visible face of th WG in Dressrosa, he needed to fail in order to acomplish his goal</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off hambeasts.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br></br></br>  <br>If its true we'll probably know in the coming chapters.

Weird but kinda hot</br>  How are Doffy and Roci both 10 feet tall when their parents were both normal size?  <br> nami <br> relevant in any way <br> 0 combat skill <br> offers nothing to the crew dynamic <br> has no skill worth anything since they hit water 7 <br> shit backstory <br> people literally only like her because of fanservice <br>you could give all of nami's skills to ussop and the story would be the same except sanji would be x1000 times better because oda wouldn't have to cop out his shitty character writting to a perv trope</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because flamingos</br>  <br>I miss Vivi and Nami's friendship, they had better chemistry than Nami and Robin.</br>  <br>Post them.</br>   mfw have to lurk here for the pics because OP thread in /cm/ died and the one in /y/ is slow as shit <br>The guys here are right, you bunch really need to move and keep it up there with the amount that's being posted here.<br><br>Also Nami a shit post a better girl like  Hina </br></br></br>  <br>Hatred makes you grow in OP universe</br>  <br>By masturbating of course.<br>It helps your growth.<br>Look at the captain of Moby Dick.</br></br></br>  <br> if Homing hadn't moved away from Mariejois the boys would still be wearing those retarded haircuts <br><br>Truly he was a saint, fuck all the naysayers</br></br></br>  <br>Their parents aren't normal sized though. Why would you think that ?</br>  <br> OP thread in /cm/ died and the one in /y/ <br>You're lying, nobody actually goes there. Because neither of these boards even exist.</br></br>  <br>if you want a /cm/ thread go start one<br><br>/cm/ and /y/ has always stayed dead though because both require you new shit. It may seem like a lot of new pics get posted here but really its all things recycled from months ago</br></br></br>  was roger xbox huge?  <br>It's the nose.</br>  <br>roger and rayleigh were about the same height</br>  <br/>  <br>Sabo was just an excuse not to engage Doffy. I already said that. Yes, he talked to Riku and yes he threw some dice symbolically, but I don't see how that is indicative of him being lazy. He had his men controlling the situations in areas he couldn't be (because he obviously can't be everywhere at once) but all the citizens were safe and subdued on the plague where he was. Also, as a soldier in charge, he is responsible for coordinating the battle. That's how almost all militaries work.</br>  <br>She's alive right? The government didn't announce the death of the last Shichibukkai roght?</br>  Can we talk together about Rebecca before I go to sleep?  <br> Their parents aren't normal sized though. <br><br>Show me evidence that they were also 10' tall freaks because even taking into account perspective, they look to be of average height like the other CDs in this crowd. Unless every person present in this panel has giant blood in them.</br></br></br>  <br>*on the plateau</br>  <br> The government didn't announce the death of the last Shichibukkai roght? </br>  <br> Implying Drake isn't the inside man </br>  <br>She's shit. Good night.</br>  <br>It's just a typo, anon.</br>  <br>For whom?</br>  <br> You will never taste her tears </br>  <br>You saw him giving instructions? Can't he do it while protecting citizens if that's what he went for? Is "getting Law and Luffy" all the work an admiral has to do? It's not a matter of lazy, it's a matter of justice.</br>  <br>well said</br>  <br>There are no proof they're average sized either. Because we've never seen them around a character with a known height.<br> Unless every person present in this panel has giant blood in them <br>They're all inbred, why would that be surprising ?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he's talking about how stupid it is to predict that Monet is a shichibukai.</br>  <br>There's some shit in the air on the grandline that makes motherfuckers huge or small, and their body compositions vary vastly. It's why Giants and Dwarfs are a reality over there<br><br> The actual answer is that Oda just likes drawing really important characters really huge because it makes them look more cool and intidimating. He even does this with his perspective at times. Look at how Shanks and his crew were potrayed when they came to Marineford to end the war, he's a pretty normal sized guy, but the spread (you know which spread) makes the motherfucker look huge </br></br></br>  <br>He's not talking.</br>  <br><br>I don't feel like responding to you idiots today, I'm tired.<br>Good night to you.<br><br><br>Tears are all taste like saline water so no you don't need to taste her tears.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Go to bed, Bryant</br></br>  <br> They're all inbred, why would that be surprising ? <br>Dirty giants wouldn't have the blood of the world's creators.</br></br>  <br>she has a fat butt</br>  <br>She's a masochistic pervert.</br>  <br>She really would have been a more interesting character if Oda didn't fuck her up with the damsel in distress trope. That's all i have to say about her. Goodnight anon</br>  <br>Don't forget Buggy.</br>  <br><br><br>That appeases my mind.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I like that he switches everything about them, including personality. Ultra-crass Robin and crazy ass hotblooded Nami are hilarious as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br>You have the right to be idiot too.<br><br>He used her to portray Kyros in a forced patriarchical way during the fight against Kyros.<br>Good night to you, I'll try to talk with you tomorrow but I'll be busy I think.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yet both Doffy and Roci have it. It has to be running in the tenryubitos.</br>  <br>Did you get fired from your job to help the victimes of the patriarchy  again  ?</br>   complaining about gay posting <br>It isn't even half as bad as yesterday, calm your asses.</br>  <br>But I won't use that right. She's a pervert.</br>  <br><br/></br>   not giving a shit about the person who killed your dad is considered maturity now   <br>Akainu agrees with Fuji, he only disagrees with making the Marines look weak right before a war.<br>Akainu showed way more balls than Fuji in the last chapter</br></br>  Why are the scenes of Corazon throwing Law into the dump so entertaining.<br>I can't stop watching them.</br>  <br>man yesterday was wild<br><br>shame I wasnt there for most of it</br></br></br>   keeping Kamiya to play child Law <br> I like the guy as a voice actor but it still doesn't fit at all <br><br>For what purpose Toei?</br></br></br>  <br>Just fuck off fujoshit</br>  <br>Little shit and his grating voice deserve it.</br>  <br> is this furry <br>No it's not. This is cute.</br></br>  <br> Episode of Sabo is made before an Episode of Law <br>Toei will have to give in eventually right?<br><br>Not even a big Lawfag but the flashback was my favorite part of this arc and I'd like to see young Doffy's fashion sense decently animated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>reminded me I need to cut up this page, thanks</br>  <br>Do we know what episode of Sabo will consist of ? Is it filler or a retelling of the ASL flashback ?</br>  <br>I feel like Oda made Robin's fruit too OP and doesn't really know how to make fights for her.<br><br>I mean she can end literally anyone by sprouting arms everywhere and doing a submission hold</br></br></br>  <br> implying Oda can't create characters that would be a challenge for her <br> implying her fruit doesn't have a jarring weakness in that the damage on her sprouted arms means damage to her own body <br>He just doesn't want to make her fight.</br></br></br>  Post underrated sex adonises.  <br> Do we know what episode of Sabo will consist of ? <br> One Piece Episode of Sabo ~3-Kyōdai no Kizuna Kiseki no Saikai to Uketsugareru Ishi~ (One Piece Episode of Sabo: The Three Brothers' Bond - The Miraculous Reunion and the Inherited Resolve) will revisit the childhood past of the three sworn brothers Luffy, Ace, and Sabo, when they all dreamed of becoming pirates. In addition, it will depict how Sabo originally came into the kingdom of Dressrossa (which was not depicted in Eiichiro Oda's original manga or the television anime), as well as his reunion with Luffy from his point of view. </br></br>    <br><br><br>Mite be cool. Hopefully we'll see a little bit of Dragon and Iva.<br>It will probably look a bit stupid because they won't reveal the reason he wasn't there for Ace though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It has that weakness, but that doesn't mean much, when she can make 30 arms blossom all over you in a split second and lock all your movements. Her fighting style would have to be altered to make more interesting fights<br><br>Other than Logias, the only characters that could stand a chance would be fruit users that can split their bodies like Buggy and that Marine VA guy that splits in balls</br></br></br>  <br> Marine VA guy that splits in balls <br>I forgot about that guy, he was pretty cool. I don't think he was a VA tough, was he ?</br></br>  <br>Captain I think.<br>Berry Good was his name.</br></br>  <br>Having Garp for best friend, I wouldn't be suprised if Sengoku never got any pussy.</br>    <br> berry good </br>  <br> that Marine VA guy that splits in balls <br><br>Very Good can't even defeat CP9. How is going to handle Robin?</br></br></br>  With F/SN Heaven's Feel movies on the horizon, is your body ready for best girl to get her time to shine?  <br> those seiba expressions <br>Hnnng, my heart</br></br>      <br><br>What do you mean, anon?</br></br>  <br>Anon was referring to Sakura not getting attention as not being popular, not her actual quality.</br>   Precure thread   <br>Heh. You're actually partly right. Naisho v2 will be last yes, but that's primarily due to technical reasons. I need to source out better raws and we're missing like half of the original scripts, so those either have to be dug up from the netherrealm of Mace's/Lad's computer or remade from scratch. Most of them were remade a few years ago, but we're still missing some.</br>  <br> There were a handful, such as the Witch World being called the Magic Kingdom, Witch Frogs being called Magic Frogs during the -entire- series, the Magical Stage spells being untranslated (The final word is an actual word, as opposed to magical gibberish), and lines that while they may not have been -wrong- they were just lacking a bit of polish or detail. <br><br>So nothing actually offensively bad</br></br></br>  Erika no Tsubomi  <br>Why not just set up a donate thing for people to just buy you the DVDs? <br><br>And unlike with TV-N we know you'll actually release something once you get the money.</br></br></br>  <br> I want to use magic to help them, but that's now allowed. <br><br>Aside from a now/not typo (in regards to mind control magic) in Sharp 4, no, nothing super bad. The only other really bad mistranslation I can think of was in Onpu's debut episode, where her skipping over exams was kinda glossed over and not really articulated properly. Ironically, the 4kids dub of all things alerted me to the kinda ech lines.<br><br><br>Nah, our new raw guy for the v2 project, Puto, is a fucking sorcerer and has the entire series on DVD. Pretty sure he has Naisho too, but if not, I know he can get it, so we're covered. He's just been very busy the last few months due to his new job and other anime projects, so he can only get out about 2 newly encoded Ojamajo episodes per week. The man's help has been most welcome, though.<br><br>Damn captcha expiring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sad Panda thread<br><br>Some random stuff<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/551373/1dabfa<wbr>2be4/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/623067/ea9312<wbr>a88b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/723516/c1bf81<wbr>f7b1/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/649737/6e1d27<wbr>51d2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/816242/48be31<wbr>d8a2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824091/0f4905<wbr>25d3/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821185/1ec1f9<wbr>9dd2/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/631092/a27846<wbr>e642/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/315846/fcff5e<wbr>fb58/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/687306/f1c6e3<wbr>6aba/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wani?</br>  <br>Bosshi works with fakku now.
