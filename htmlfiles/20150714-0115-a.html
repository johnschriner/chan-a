[ T-MINUS 11 DAYS TILL WE GET OFF THE BOAT AND THE WORLD ENDS<br><br>ARE YOU HAPPY?<br>GUTS IS HAPPY!</br></br></br>     <br>It really was 10 years? Damn.</br>  <br>eight years</br>  <br>how about you just google it</br>  <br>We got on in 2007, so yeah, eight years. We should start recounting what happened in that time frame.<br><br> JoJo got animated and is now up to the end of Part 3 </br></br></br>  White girls are everywhere in anime. Post white girls in anime.  <br>what kind of abomination is in that picture</br>  <br>Kill it with fire.</br>  I'll sue!!  Nearly all the girls in anime are white anyway.<br>Heightwise they may be asian, but in all other ways they look more white than asian</br>  This anime is terrible not only in story but appearance. UFO dropped the ball on this one.  <br><br><br>How the fuck is this girl Russian she looks like a American slut</br></br></br>  <br>That's boring, it's a video game adaptation what else would expect.<br><br>I hope these Ufofags stop being so new and retarded though.<br><br><br>They've been 14 years strong with intense sameface. Also if you ignore the Seiba clones their character design is varied.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> contract work <br> thinking studios get a % of the profit from show <br>Where all you fuckheads making these stupid assumptions even come from?</br></br></br>  <br>She came from the Russian God Eater Branch.<br>And her hair is too light of a shade of blonde to be an American anime characters</br></br>  <br>She said she's from Mother Russia.</br>  The face just got revealed.<br><br>This nigga bizarre as fuck /a/</br></br>  <br>Unicorn was awful past the third episode. The animation and music were good but the writing was a mess.</br>  <br>You could have recommended hm a better Takahashi work like Dougram</br>  <br>Buthurt Feddy detected</br>  <br><br>Gargantia was trash that went nowhere.</br></br>  <br>you mean FLAG</br>  Madoka Thread.<br><br>Also, thought I'd ask: Has Rebellion been given the Meduka Meguca treatment yet? And if so, why can I not find it?</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Anyone would react like that if they saw Kyouko in a meido outfit.</br>  <br>Talk about the ultimate trigger.</br>  <br> Is Heavansward worth it? </br>  <br><br>Thanks dudes, I'm not so dumb that I wouldn't know about Tenacious D. I'm pretty sure I could teach you a thing or two about Metal. I was merely talking about the gif, which is fucking ugly.</br></br>  ITT: immeasurable sex appeal  <br> Doujins never </br>  Bar fucking none    <br>too bad the faggot can`t tell lolis and cowtits apart. <br>I had to photoshop her cowtits out of that loli.</br></br>  <br>Beat me to it.</br>  Which Symphogear the sexiest, /a/?  <br>ban me faget</br>  <br> Have you ever considered inhaling car fumes?</br>  <br><br><br><br>B-be gentle.<br><br><br>Her design isn't really appealing to me, and does she really need to be such a baka at all times? The whole "let's stop fighting and talk it over" always makes me cringe whenever it pops, and she's no different. <br><br><br>That pic at bottom was the last episode I saw.<br>So she changes drastically? Looking forward to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Periods, anon. They are chicken periods.</br>  <br>Believe in justice and hold a determination to fist.</br>  When are we going to get the spoilers for the new chapter? Only 4 days to go before the chapter is officially out in Nippon.  <br>I hope he stays the same to what he currently is. That's enough.<br><br>More would be over the line</br></br></br>    Lenalee a shit    <br>mods should make a thread sticky when it comes out<br><br>just like berserk</br></br></br>  <br>As a DGM fag, I prefer no sticky</br>  I actually would want to bang this   go to your kitchen <br> see this <br>what do?</br></br>  <br>I give her a cat</br>  <br>Don't do it. Chris Hansan is probably driving.</br>  <br>Fuck off with your 3DPD shit you idiot.</br>  <br>Call the police. I'm sick of these animes breaking in like they own the place. Eating up all my toast as they run off to school.</br>  <br><br>Get rid of 3DPD from /a/</br></br>  What's going to happen to her /a/?<br>Why is she being made out to be the underdog?<br>Why did the anime skip over and downplay every scene that indicated 8man likes her?<br>How will she fix her self esteem issues?<br>What were 8man's intentions when he asked her out?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Can't wait to see all these waifufags getting BTFO when their waifu loses and they're forced to buy the VN to see their waifu win <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Why would the VAs be told how the series is going to end? There's every reason not to tell them and no reason to tell them.<br><br>At best you can assume that Yui's VA ships 8man with Yukino.</br></br></br>  <br> Yukinofag directed anime <br>Yeah, no.</br></br>  <br>Did you know that FEEL downplaying 8man reaction/monologue/behavior at Yui scene?<br><br>Oh right you didn't because You fags satisfied with what are FEEL doing with anime script.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait to see Irohafags BTFO when Iroha gets even less scenes in vol 12, then is forgotten completely by the end</br>  Imouto thread?<br>Imouto thread.</br>  <br>I love Kirino.</br>  <br>I liked Kirino because she was exactly like my little sister. Except unlike my rotten sister, underneath her tsun exterior she was a sweet brocon hiding her feelings.<br><br>People who talk about how Kirino is such a bitch probably have little understanding of just how bitchy and vile little sisters can really be.</br></br></br>  <br>Blame the anime</br>  <br>It's called a garter.</br>  <br>the anime is not aggressive</br>  With legs like these, who needs boobs?  Still the best.  <br>You could have been by my side for this Aoi.</br>  <br>Does Kumiko shave her legs?</br>  <br><br>Aoi x Haruka would have been great.</br></br>  Those bloody legs.  What does it take for an anime or manga to be labeled as "edgy".<br><br>Is it simply because violence is present or is there something more to it?</br></br>  <br> opening cutscene to Modern Warfare 3. <br/></br>  <br>violence for the sake of violence.<br><br>violence or dialogue with the purpose of shock value, but is completely unnecessary.<br><br>violence without emotion or consequence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daria had it right 15 years ago.<br>And the Japs are behind a decade or two as always.<br><br>I'll go back to what I said:<br> english title <br>Gangsta - the japs can speak fluent dictionary English so shit like Berserk and Bastard can't cut it anymore in contrast Gangsta which is a noneword is still new and fresh for them andclicks with the niggerfied youth of both the West and the East.<br><br> super powers <br>All kids dream about being God. Can't get more safer than that if you're aiming a series at kids.<br><br> caucasian and caucasoid characters <br>Europeans (and more recently niggers) are "beautiful" - The meme - The inferiority complex - the Culture<br><br> dystopia <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128018159#p128021548">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> violence without emotion or consequence. <br>Name a TV anime released in the last 25 years that had violence followed by consequence.</br></br>  <br>I couldn't think of a relevant anime bombing<br><br>How about the scene where Yuno blows up a school in Mirai Nikki just because then? Is that better?</br></br></br>  Top this.  <br>Fucking Godani.</br>  I nominate this scene:<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/kE38SKRT4ak?t=3m5s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>you mean memetastic</br></br>  <br>Oh god damn it Id forgotten about that. Dem feels are real</br>  <br>I had to take a fucking break at that part.</br>  How does it feel knowing the end of the hiatus is coming soon?  <br><br>But in my experience the majority did, hell search the archive and you'll find a lot of people getting corrected from people who've read the manga. But once they were corrected they realized that they misunderstood, and then would go onto correct others. I've been on more than just 4chan and I seen more misunderstandings than anything else.</br></br>  <br>Actually he apologizes to Mito more than once in the manga. <br>And that falls under them making him too pure-hearted.</br></br>  <br>In whatever case, the fact that people who only watched 2011 COULD trace the development on their own and appreciate it shows it's not the fault of the show. The evidence was still there, just not all watchers saw it.</br>  So are there contracts the Zoldyck won't accept? It seems unlikely they went in with the idea they could not beat the Chimera King, but why not hire the assassins to kill him instead of simply transporting Netero there.  <br>But I never once mentioned him apologizing to Mito, so I don't understand why you're even bringing it up. And making him too pure-hearted obviously takes away from the selfish parts of his personality, so I don't get what you're arguing here. Unless you're just trying to say that Gon's never selfish.</br></blockquote>]
