Going for it right after Isla croaking would have been uncalled for and forced even by this show standards.</br>  VN when? i'm pretty sure there will be at least 1 ass pull end  <br> we will never get an alternate ending where Tsukasa goes crazy and leaves Isla to die alone while he pounds Michiru all night <br><br>It would be absolutely terrible, but it would be perfect</br></br></br>    That ambiguous ending makes me wonder whether that new giftia is Isla with a new OS or not. <br><br>The 9 month skip does seem to resemble a sort of rebirthing for both the MC and the new Isla.</br></br>   Tsukasa makes the last memory of Isla giving her the dick hard <br> he reaches over and turns her off before crying out MY SEXBOT IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD </br>  <br> MY SEXBOT IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD <br>Onahole.</br></br>  <br> implying he wouldn't try to ride the wild giftia first <br><br>It'd be like one of those bull ride things, except with your dick</br></br></br>  Surely there will be a OVA that brings her back.  <br> Turn out, there's a secret button at the end of her synthetic pussy, which extends her lifetime with every push. <br> Everyone who tried fucking their giftia had giftia gf because their dick was too short in the first place. <br> Every female giftia then brought to Tsukasa to lengthen their lifespan through a good cucking. </br></br></br>  Would you let him retrieve you?  <br>I know what scenario I'm masturbating to tonight</br>  I'm going to miss her.  ;_; <br><br>Hopefully they will release an after-story in the future.</br></br>  <br>Nope, all you get is the Isla Memorial magazine one-shot.</br>  <br>I could deal with it if it was like that shitty time travel show we had a few seasons back where he spends half his life researching and finally figures out how to extend their lifespan and is reunited with her as an old man.</br>  Such an anti climactic ending. Where is my cop-out bullshit happy end ending that I expected?  The best part no one would remember this show come next month.  Just like Isla   <br>what show?</br>  <br>I didn't even remember the name of the show, but I found a file: "Ushinawareta Mirai wo Motomete".</br>  <br>Isla will be remembered for a while, mainly because she's reaction image gold</br>  <br>Wherever threads that go past the last page go.</br>  <br>Im not sure thats it.<br>Does look like it.</br></br>  Giftias are consumer products, right? And they've already shown you can order them out of a catalogue. And while I imagine you can probably order bespoke ones if you have enough money, the ones working for Terminal Services probably wouldn't be luxury models. So it's likely they'd be based on a standard chassis with perhaps minimal adjustments.<br><br>So it remains the possibility that there is more than one Giftia out there with the same appearance as Isla. Maybe different wardrobe and hairstyle, but same facial features and body shape.<br><br>Imagine being Tsukasa after losing Isla, repeatedly seeing people that look like Isla out there on daily life. Imagine suspecting that one of them might even be YOUR Isla, reformatted and repurposed.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only Tsukasa's penis is large enough to reach the secret switch. <br> Naruhodo. </br></br>  <br>Doesn't, rather.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, made me sad as fuck but cute as fuck as well.</br>  <br>Hide your shame.</br>   lovey-dovey couple <br> even shown bathing together <br> final kissu is offscreen <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>They don't go to heaven where the angels fly.</br>   H- H- H- HOW BIG IS IT, ISLA?

Shirou only lost due to his arm killing him. Archer would not have had a problem.  <br>saber alter is worse than saber and archer can only win in a long range battle</br>  <br>Archer can kill anyone</br>  There's no need for Sparks Liner High to imply it. Archer outright kills Saber in Hollow Ataraxia.  <br>This. Archer is too stronk if you let him strategise. He's great long distance and can endure short distances. What a guy/</br>  <br>No, because UBW is no good against anyone who isn't Gilgamesh. Saber is good with her sword and cannot be overcome by Aacha's sword rain. This is an objective fact and everyone knows it. Both Shirou and the Red Man would be useless against any other Servant.</br>  <br>Confirmed for anime only babby</br>  <br>Archer has one the advantage going for him.<br>He already experience the HGW before and knows all the other servants abilities and skills. The only question is if he is able to pull it all off.</br></br>  <br>You're no better for replying to obvious bait.</br>  <br>Counterbaited, fag</br>  Since archer arm shirou projects herc's ghetto axe and was able to utilize 9lives, can Archer project Kirijou's sword to utilize Tsubame Gaeshi?  His stats are shit, but Shirou with his arm could do that much damage to Saber Alter, despite the fact that in the forest, Saber Alter sent him flying into the trees with one blow. <br> And then he could kill Berserker 5 times in Fate. <br><br>Obviously plot armor.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Archer can beat any servant, it's implied that if Rin never met Shirou she would've been the eventual winner. No servant can beat Archer 1 on 1, he's like Gil, he has a NP that can counter every servant, and his Reality Marble is a natural counter to Gil.<br><br>He needs to take a back seat to Shirou since Shirou is the main character, but since Archer is a grown up Shirou it's known that he can do everything Shirou does in the novel but better.</br></br></br>  <br> plot armor <br> Archer dies in both Fate and HF </br></br>  Archer killed Berserker 6 times in a row in melee combat before getting dropped in Fate.<br><br>Given the opportunity to use actual ranged attacks he should be a fairly decent match for Saber in even circumstances, though with an advantage leaning toward Saber.</br></br>  Didn't Saber Alter have enough mana to spam Excalibur?  <br>Cast time</br>  Why didn't Archer use Nine Lives Blade Works on Berserker?  When did you realize that Yui was best girl Anon?  <br>It's called character development. some shows have it, but it's unusual</br>  <br>Hi Hayato<br><br><br>Picking milf is like picking Saori<br><br><br>Same here. But people who compete in math olympic are handled such things in last year of their middle school</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 10/10 wife with very long expiration date <br> a cute and pure daughter <br><br>Gahamadad is the happiest man in Chiba.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice argument.<br><br><br>The thing that makes this fucked up is the fact that she used Yukino to force 8man's hand.<br><br>It's not like they just went on a date and this happened to come about. The date was her idea, she brought the fucking cookies ahead of time. She literally planned to pull this shit knowing that Yukino is in an extremely vulnerable situation.<br><br><br>If that were the case she still picked the single worst possible time to do it. If Yui's goal is for Yukino to stand on her own she shouldn't be kicking Yukino when she's down with a broken leg.<br><br><br>Doesn't excuse it in the least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> That's bull. Yukino is supposed to have some sort of bizarre complex she developed from her sister, trying to be like her but failing at it. And now she relies on other people to take of things -- her repeating 8man's argument to her sister word-for-word was supposed to be a lame hint towards that. <br><br>She's already over with her complex with Haruno. Her sole problem right now is that she thinks she's a failure.<br><br> But seriously, forced drama is forced. All these chicks have to do is confess to 8man. <br><br>Thinking back at the stuco elections to the christmas party, they really don't want the club to disappear or one person to go. <br><br>With that thought, it makes it for one chick to confess. If Yui confesses to 8man and he accepts, Yukino leaves, if Yukino confesses, Yui leaves. They don't want any of these to happened thats why it makes it so difficult for them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does?<br><br>Have you ever stopped and considered just how much money it takes to produce your average anime episode? We're talking like $100 a second, on the low end.<br><br>So, with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? Even in popular, mainstream anime produced by large studios, plot developments can be completely erratic and nonsensical. Take Mirai Nikki: $130 a second. $70,000 an episode, yet they can't just sit down and make a coherent storyboard?<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br><br><br>All of them unfortunately.<br><br> why is the writing often so poor? <br><br>Because good writing doesnt equal more sales</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  High budget and good writing have nothing to do with each other.<br>Just look at Hollywood and prime time American television.</br>  Literally all of them. People act like it's hard to write a script or come up with a concept for a game. It's not. It's practically all luck of the draw. If the suits that don't know what you're talking about like the cut of your jib, BAM you got a piece of entertainment media in production. Just convince them that it will make them money and you're golden. That's all that matters. Having a high CHA stat is far more important than having an actual good idea or talent.  <br> Because good writing doesnt equal more sales <br>WHYwhyWHYwhyWHYwhyWHYwhyWHY<br><br>That can't be true. Granted, every story doesn't need to be Lain or the Silmarillion, but to THIS extreme? That doesn't make any sense.<br><br>It's not true.<br><br>It can't be true.<br><br>I refuse to believe it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br><br>American television and films.<br><br> So, with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? <br><br>Because the consumer based is populated by morons who have no interest in coherent storytelling.<br><br>/a/ is representative of that. Think about how many idiotic waifu war/best girl threads there are?<br><br>It's these types of people who are the primary consumers of anime. All they want are animated breasts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  LNs. There's a reason why the shittiest anime usually happen to be adapted from LNs.  <br>American TV shows, to my knowledge, still have to have marginally coherent plotlines. That coherency can be cheesy or dumb, but it has to be coherent. Americans won't like it if things don't make any sense. Japan doesn't seem to give one shit like this.</br>  <br><br>How new are you?<br><br>To life in general I mean.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just a little girl, Anon.</br>  <br> Take Mirai Nikki <br>If I take the absolute worst example from any medium obviously it will be utter shit.</br></br>  because japan has shit taste and people in japan who actually consume anime are  fat virgin nerds   <br> complains about writing in anime <br> uses a manga for an example <br>You might as well just complain about Japanese writing in general.</br></br></br>  Who the fuck watches anime for the writing  <br>Please find me a western equivalent. I just don't see something written with THAT extreme of a lack of regard, for anything, being able to achieve the same popularity in the US.<br><br>Twilight, Harry Potter, uhh... god knows what else. Yes, they're dumb, and have alot of insipid, juvenile plot developments: but there is a logical coherency to them. They are 'wrapped up' in a way that anime just doesn't have to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Nips don't care about shitty anime adaptation anon, no matter how shitty it is, as long as the original source is successful.<br><br>Now, on to LN successes, that's just because nips love shitty stories anon.</br></br></br>  <br> What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that anime regularly does? <br>Television, movies, books, American comics, and video games.</br></br>   Implying pic related needs good writing.   <br> You might as well just complain about Japanese writing in general. <br><br>That's basically what I'm doing. In retrospect this thread should be posted on /jp/</br></br></br>  <br>Twilight is a best selling novel. CoD is a best selling game. Pewdiepie is one of the most watched Youtube celebrities. <br><br>Quality will never equal popularity.</br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>/jp/ gives even less of a fuck than /a/<br>They only read VNs</br></br>  <br>I do</br>  <br>You are underage or mentally stunted then</br>  <br>I'll turn you to a big girl anon.</br>  In anime characters and design are more important than writing. Style over substance.  <br>Dude, look at the Simpsons. It has been utter dogshit for many years, but the merchandise still sells, and still turns a profit, hence why episodes still get made despite decreasing ratings.<br><br>You can also look at Family Guy for an example, it got shit on from the very beginning, and yet it was revived from cancellation because of powerful DVD sales and strong ratigs on Adult Swim.</br></br></br>  Good writing is not as important as you think. Or rather, this word "good" doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means. "Good" doesn't mean Shakespeare. It doesn't even mean, you know, Tolkien and uh, whoever the fuck wrote Lain (Konaka?). Mirai Nikki's writing is "good" because many people out there found it exciting and fresh and fun. No matter how much you don't like it, there's no reason that can't be one of many many qualifiers by which to measure the success and "good"ness of an anime.<br><br>If you're wondering why everything can't be highbrow and elaborate and artsy and, ugh, "objectively good", I'm sorry to inform you that what you think is "good" in that way is very very boring to many people. To write something that is "good" like you think things are "good", and yet is not boring to most people out there, is really hard and occurs very infrequently, and it usually gets scoffed by crowds like 4chan anyway, for being too popular.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off shiteater.</br>  <br>Family guy and the Simpsons are episodic comedies. Not character driven action "thrillers," of one sort or another, like the majority of anime.</br>  <br> bad is good <br>Stop jewing me</br></br>  <br> character driven action "thrillers," of one sort or another, like the majority of anime. <br><br>I think we're done here.</br></br></br>  <br> Family guy and the Simpsons are episodic comedies.  <br>That doesn't mean that golden age Simpsons episodes weren't well written.</br></br>  Nips probably don't give two shits to whether we understand their "good writing" or not. <br><br>Look at those real life le funny maymays, do they even make sense on how they just appear? <br><br> Hey it looks cool to put butter on everything <br> better tweet this and make this into a meme wwwww </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it so difficult to accept that whatever you felt when you watched Lain or Cowboy Bebop or whatever you thought was good, is the same feeling that someone else out there felt when they watched something like Mirai Nikki, or Guilty Crown?</br>  <br>Even non conventional shows like Sora no Woto fit into that same basic outline.<br><br> character drama <br> action / adversity <br><br>It wouldn't take much to turn it into a shounen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It doesn't matter if it's well done or not, the only thing that matters is how you feeeeeel <br>No. You're wrong. Stop it please.</br></br>  <br>Search your feelings, you know it to be true.<br><br>You are not aware that light-hearted things can feel better than serious stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Its so difficult to accept that some people have shit taste?<br><br>I liked plenty of garbage when I was a kid that Ive tried to go back only to find how shit it really was, some people stay with their 5yo tastes all their life<br>And you must be one of them because they tend to justify their shit eating habits by saying that "there is nothing objectively good lol"<br>Something only a kid would say</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to realize that objective quality doesn't exist though</br>  <br>Reported and flagged for promoting terrorism<br><br>stop samefagging</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably the only industry where character design is more important than everything else.</br>  <br>I'll take the retardation of Mirai Nikki over the boredom of capeshit any day</br>  I enjoyed mirai Nikki<br><br>But yes there are plenty of times that keeps making me go what the fuck! Why aren't x doing y?<br>I just kept watching instead and ignored the retardedness of some of the writing in the show because it was still entertaining</br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy here we go.</br>  <br>You are a fucking retard<br>Shut the fuck up</br></br>  <br> kids <br> not being convinced their taste is the best and only true one and OMG how can you like that, looooser, lol <br>No, the "objectively good" phase is the kid one.</br></br></br>  <br>You are deluded beyond belief.</br>  <br>Oh God yes, I'll fucking kill myself before I have to watch another cape movie. I don't know how people can just eat that shit up.</br>  /a/ - Its ok to eat shit<br><br>Not surprising though, anime is shit and you have to rationalize somehow I guess<br><br>Manga can be good sometimes</br></br></br></br>  <br> NO YOU <br>totally not the kid phase</br></br>  <br>There is nothing to discuss with a retard that doesnt have any real word experience, keep eating shit.</br>  <br> come in to thread <br> post once <br> get called a samefag <br><br>Who are you even saying I'm samefagging?<br><br>Anyways perceived quality is always going to be subjective. You can say something is shit, and maybe a bunch of people agree with you, but what if a majority disagrees?<br><br>Pretty much all arguments about quality are just going to boil down to pure opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no real world experience <br> strangers on internet have shit taste because they have no real world experience. and how do I know they have no real world experience? because they have shit taste. </br></br>  <br>Amen<br><br>Personally, I've been really surprised by what kind of themes and depth the comic book artists have been able to include in their utterly childish stories about musclemen playing dressup. But when it comes to the normie mainstream, the stories are so stale and cliche it makes me want to gouge out my eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>But thats fucking wrong<br><br>No one can deny twilight is garbage absolutely no one, not even the housewives that masturbate to it, when you present your arguments about why its bad they cant say anything back other than yes I know its shit but I enjoy it<br>Its still shit<br>Same as most anime<br>Enjoy it all you want, but be aware of what you are doing</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>All of your arguments about why it is bad are opinions though that's the problem.</br>  <br>They are not, have you never read an actual critic?<br>Go educate yourself please.</br></br>  <br>  no one can deny <br> ad populum </br></br>  <br>Partially this.<br>Especially, being "logical" (as cited from some previous posts) does not make a work good, and being nonsensical doesn't make it bad.<br><br>Also, though it would be difficult to cite them because I generally don't remember any titles, I hardly think that "bad" writing is a problem that only concerns anime or manga. Movies, series, books and video games seem to be exactly the same to me. There are masterpieces in every form of media just as there are popular "shit" (entirely subjective) in any media.<br><br>I'm actually more interested in understanding why some anime/manga fans genuinely think that said form of art is inherently or de facto inferior to books or tv series.<br>This inferiority complex seems much more inherent to anime than bad writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you enjoy something, it is not shit. Your enjoyment is reason enough to elevate it above shit status.</br>  <br> pixel count is an illusion </br>  <br>Some stories are objectively better than others. There is a structure to reality, and so the human being. We are not special snowflakes who are so completely unique that total shit for somebody else can *literally* be 10/10 brilliance for us. It can only be "seemingly" so. You can enjoy shit more than others for whatever reason. And that might be perfectly okay, maybe. But that doesn't mean that you have good taste.</br>  Japan is extremely conservative, things stay the same for ever. Main reason however is that Japanese artists cater to jap consumers. English market is way more competitive.  <br>Im done arguing with you manchildren.<br>Its so pathetic Im getting sad.<br>Enjoy your shit, see what that will get you.</br></br></br>  <br>lost my shit</br>  <br>It's hilarious AND powerful</br>  <br>Only non-retarded person in this thread. I'm surprised that on a board like /a/ where everyone calls each other tastes shit that people haven't realized by now that our standards for judging any work is far more variable than you'd think possible.</br>  <br> look up twilight critiques <br> majority positive <br> still a large division in positive and negative <br><br>Wow it's like different critics have different stardards which they use to form their opinion about things. Like they are different people with different opinions or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  What other entertainment media can get away with shoddy writing to the extent that feature film does?<br><br>Have you ever stopped and considered just how much money it takes to produce the average Hollywood blockbuster? We're talking like $20000 a second, on the low end.<br><br>So with that kind of money on the line, why is the writing often so poor? Even in popular, mainstream movies, produced by large studios, plot developments can be completely erratic and nonsensical. Take Avengers 2. $27000 a second, yet they can't just sit down and make a coherent storyboard?<br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> our standards for judging any work is far more variable than you'd think possible. <br><br>Sure it's variable, but it's not subjective like so many people are arguing.</br></br></br>  TV shows, books, movies, comics and games from personal experience.  <br> over the span of like 10 years <br> not even 0.001% of movies produced in that time frame <br><br>Try again, anime is shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some stories are objectively better than others <br><br>No they aren't. They may be subjectively better but to be objectively better ever single conscious being that could understand those stories would have to unanimously agree that it was better.</br></br></br>  why are they best girls?  You like shit.  <br>Not Picking<br> Mea <br> Kotegawa <br> Rin <br> Nana <br> Kyouko <br> Yami <br>etc. I can name them all. You have good taste with Momo and Mikan. But if you just stop there then you're a failure to me. Step up your game /a/non.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The harem would be to strong Normalfags wouldn't be able to take it</br>  <br>I don't see Haruna in your list.<br><br><br>remove the underage b&amp;</br></br></br></br>  <br>reminder that Haruna is shit and drags the entire series down</br>  <br>Switch mikan with kotegawa, then we can agree</br>  <br>because</br>  <br>thats not best girl</br>  <br>They would make a good lewd tag team</br>  <br>Haruna &gt; Lala</br>  Momo &gt; Everyone else  why don't theses two get more love?  <br>Such a waste for making an elementary school girl, and then give her a teenage body.<br>Don't misunderstand, Mikan is still delicious, but if they already took the risk of incest antics and being 12, they should have made her a loli too.</br></br>  <br>But shes in middle school? and she needs to fulfill the Imouto you'd like to fuck roll</br>  <br>Pretty sure a lot of people would like to fuck her too if she were a loli.</br>  <br>I can't deny this<br><br>especially the lolicons here on /a/</br></br></br>  <br>The point is that she would fill in a much needed gap.</br>  <br>She is still in grade school.</br>  <br>I really liked loli Lala. It's as shame she is back to normal.</br>  <br>Yeah, most amazing design for sure for a lolicon.</br>  I think the series has enough token loli's as is  <br>There isn't a loli in TLR, that's the whole point we're talking about.</br>  Cakes for me  I got this. Don't worry.  <br>  Nana and Mea not in S <br>  Genderbender shit not last <br><br>Nah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You already have two supreme flat chest goddesses in the S+.</br>  <br>Kyoko not in A, the fuck is wrong with you</br>  Never watched this series but I like doujins with Momo and Nana  <br>The bigger problem is Mea</br>  <br>According to Rito, Kyoko looks exactly the same as Haruna. But purple hair is more pretty than Black hair.</br>  <br>isn't at least Celine the token loli?</br>  <br>She's toddler, not loli.</br>  <br>Would fuck Kyoko in her pussy daily, Harunua a shit</br>  <br>I'm trying to do this shit but I always end putting almost all the girls on S and S+</br>  <br>The Harem is too strong</br>  <br><br> <br>This.<br>And she isn't even appearing. Or having fanservice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's wasted on Rito</br>  <br> tfw you made one of these but your taste is so shit that you don't want to post it </br>  <br>Even though she's this delicious?</br>  Mikan is the that devolving perfection that all young girls envy  I just started watching it.<br>I like it, but I haven't seen shit that I've seen in the gifs of this show. <br>Is season 1 no where near Darkness then?</br></br>  <br><br>I like them both.</br></br>  <br> Putting Riza only in A </br>  <br>Season 1 of the anime is pretty bad. It's very different from the manga (although I like some of the changes) and it skips a ton of stuff (all of a sudden new characters like Celine appears in the anime without any explanation).<br>Next to no nudity or stuff like that in season 1.<br><br>Things start getting into interesting territory with Motto ("season 2") and then with Darkness things becomes super interesting.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Momo <br>End yourself</br></br>  <br> reminder that Momo is shit and drags the entire series down <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Momo is love, Momo is lewd, Momois life</br>  <br> C <br>Don't bully my waifu</br></br>  <br>Momo is a boring whore</br>  <br>The other girls are just so much younger, more energy and fresher.</br>  I jerked it an unholy amount of times to her.<br>Even god lost count I bet.</br>  <br>but Mikan is so fragile.<br><br>You would break her if you came that much inside her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay I can just pull out</br>  <br> pulling out of Mikan <br><br>Absolutely haram</br></br></br>  <br>you're a gentleman of great taste anon, but i'd put ghost-chan in A too, i like her for some reason</br>  I can agree with Momo and Mikan being the best  <br>Mikan is sex</br>  <br>W-what is Mikan doing with the pregnancy test?</br>  Because my waifu is the bestest.  <br>That's a thermometer and it's going into your butt.</br>  <br>Besides Mikado-sensei the others don't have huge- Tracts of land!</br>  <br><br>I sure hope Mikan is gentle with that thing...</br></br>      <br> funnymamma </br>  <br>I prefer calm girls</br>  One day, Mikan is going to grow up  <br>This ain't Nanoha, she's gonna stay perfect forever</br>  <br>Mikan forever!</br>  <br>the series will end before enough time passes<br><br>but still hoping for a pregnant Mikan epilogue chapter</br></br></br>   Liking incest <br> Liking pedophilia <br> Liking hypersexual alien bitch who only wants to give Rito a harem so she can get his dick in her without the other girls going Kotonoha on her </br></br>  <br>Better ranking based on reality and not fantasy.</br>  <br>Switch S+ and C and you're golden.</br>  <br>  Not liking Mikans young lewd body and enjoying Momo's advancing of the plot <br><br>  get out </br></br></br>  <br>Much Better</br>  <br> not liking gender bend <br><br>What are you anon, gay or something?</br></br></br>  <br> too pure <br> Ecchi </br></br>  <br> Liking hypersexual alien bitch who only wants to give Rito a harem so she can get his dick in her without the other girls going Kotonoha on her <br>But that's exactly why we love Momo<br><br>Speaking of which, does that make Momo a cuckquean? A lover of reverse NTR?<br>Does she get more pleasure out of watching her partner subdue and breed another bitch, or is she just doing the harem thing to make Rito happy?<br>She strikes me as the type of girl that would hold another girl down in an optimal mating position to make sure she gets pregnant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Behold my shit taste</br>  <br>oh the cancer<br><br> Run top tier, kill me <br><br>Momo not at least S, go fuck yourself<br><br>Risa not the same as ecchi yami, KILL yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There have been several times where Momo started the harem plan so she can be noticed and loved by Rito and also making the other girls who are attracted to him also happy. Even Rito, THE DENSEST MATERIAL KNOWN TO MAN had caught on to her motive for the harem plan. (possibly)<br><br>To answer your other questions, as far as I know Momo has one sexual preference: Rito- No, then there's the thing with her sister and Rito's gender-bent counter part Riko... Lesbian/Rito? I don't know. But if the harem plan goes through, then Rito's being faithful to everyone in his harem, so there's no "cucking or ntr'ing" per say. As far as I can tell, as long as Momo is apart of the action, or watches then she's satisfied.</br></br></br>  <br>Momo best wingman/wife</br>  <br>So Momo would still hold Mikan down so Rito can properly impregnate her, as long as she gets impregnated that night as well?</br>  Okay, /a/. If To Love-Ru Darkness was a full blown balls to the soft walls of a woman's pelvis hentai (as if it almost wasn't anyway). Who would've Rito already slept with if he was just a little bit more serious in some of his mega intimate moments? Because the first two that popped up into my head were Risa, Yui. (He could have given Risa and Yui the D SO HARD, THEIR BODIES AND MINDS WERE READY). Why I didn't say Momo is because the same chapter where Rito caught on to Momo's motives, was the same one where she realized her body was not truly ready.<br><br><br>I wouldn't put it past her if she did.</br></br></br>  <br> Momo would still hold Mikan down so Rito can properly impregnate her <br><br>This is the route everybody</br></br></br>  <br>But Mikan is still a middle schooler.<br><br>Her body wasn't meant to withstand forceful and constant pumping movements into her womb, those would break her...</br></br></br>  <br>*still a grade schooler<br>But she would take it if it was her Onii-chan~<br>Knowing Rito he would be gentle with her, or he would wait until she's older. Or other things that don't involve penetrating her with his beast.</br></br></br>   not corrupting the tsundere into cock-hungry slut   You guys can have the other girls. I just want Nana.  <br> Nobody has dumped some Mikan doujins <br> Nor any other To Love Ru girl <br>Urusanai.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, it's To Love-Ru Darkness, do we really need to dump doujins?</br>  <br>she would take it<br>and she would love it<br>because deep down inside her long repressed sexual desire for her brother are surfacing<br><br> I noticed this in the later CH of the darkness manga </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't catch onto it, she had to tell him directly what she was planning.</br>  <br>Meant to link </br>  <br>I meat new ones, sharing what we discover in these filthy holes is always a good thing for us.</br>  <br><br>No, no, no. Yes, she told him about the Harem Plan. But he didn't figure out her real motive for it until that chapter, which I didn't realize until I reread that chapter months later after I read it when it first came out.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd love to see a doujin of Nemesis and Momo having a competition to see who can give Rito the better orgasm.</br></br>  <br><br>Momo is the only character that does things and changes throughout the series. Sure Yui and Run can "do things" to your dick but other than that they serve no purpose, Momo is the only character really advancing what little plot TLR has.<br><br>inb4 we get too serious about character archetypes, development, and plot in a fucking harem manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Darkness is basically her and Yami's story</br>  <br>Why are you dumbasses arguing about dick holes. cause that's what this manga is full of. There's no plot at all, it's just "a day in the life of the world's most virgin guy around so many sexy ovalating, ready to fuck hot babes" I'd fuck them all equally. I have no taste. i want them all. Only a dumbass would try and classify these beautiful gems.<br><br>I hope yabuki get's paid well and sleeps at night well knowing millions jack off to his ideas.</br></br></br>  <br>Rito pls</br>  Having a harem seems good on paper but then you're stuck spending all of your time hanging out with 20 different girls and raising about 50 children. <br><br>You'd need some sort of eternal aphrodisiac and spend 30 minutes fucking each one a day and still that wouldn't be enough for them.</br></br>  <br>I can do that. I have lots of energy and I can make loving them a full time job. I can be the stay at home dad.</br>   http://www.at-x.com/program/detail<wbr>/6532</wbr> <br>No parental guidance mentioned on AT-X. I guess it will air censored.</br>  <br> I already went deep, I can only go down further. <br>Momo isn't the only one who has had development in the series. Some of the characters have changed here and there. Run showed she wasn't a complete bitch, Yui has laxed on her uppity morals committee and even became bold enough to offer Rito the D. Even Rito has changed a bit. He's become slightly, slightly less embarrassed and shy with other girls. He maintained good composure until the end during that side story where Nana and Momo switched bodies and noticed that even girls like Nana can be sexy (Delicious Pettanko-Tsundere). Lala hasn't changed much per say, but Darkness has shown she's not completely naive or as oblivious as she was in To Love-Ru. Of course the ones who have had the most development are Momo and Yami of course.</br></br>  <br>Not when YOU'RE KING OF THE MOTHAFUCKIN' GALAXY! With the top medical scientists (Tear and Mikado) with an expert botanist (Momo), they can help Rito perfectly tend to his own private garden of girls.</br>  <br><br>I know where you are coming from and I wish I could see TLR as plainly as you. Unfortunately I took a lot of literature and film analysis courses in college so it's impossible to not pick apart the plot and characters.<br><br>That being said, all the girls still give me a raging boner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good to see I'm not alone in this boat. For a romantic (is there enough romance to classify it as such?) ecchi-comedy, I look into it a bit too much. As DouchebagChocolat said it doesn't really go beyond just being porn really. Maybe I look into it too deep because I'm trying to find reasons to keep reading it and lying to myself that there's something more to it than just porn so it's not a guilty pleasure. I've seen several instances of good porn with good plot, but To Love-Ru Darkness is not that. It maybe because Yabuki Kentaro's art style is just amazing, the characters that appeal to me, hilarious antics, or playing "where did Yabuki-sensei hide the vagina this month?". But I do find solace in a quote from Grand Budapest Hotel, "Times have changed, I love it all just the same, this enchanted old ruin." My tastes may have been refined, but I found To Love-Ru before they were. Even then, every month I hope that perhaps there will be a little bit less fan service and more plot. Perhaps the other girls will begin to make their advances on Rito, and he'll realize how many of them love him. Perhaps Nemesis' master plan will finally come into play and bringing plot to the manga again...

Why is she so slutty sexy<br><br>I thought she was supposed to be pure</br></br></br>  Haruna-chan is my waifu  <br>Does anyone know if horrible subs or fansubers will pick this up?</br>  Every girl is best girl some are just a little bester.  <br>Is this actually what's she's fantasising?<br><br>So she wants to marry Rito, and be sexually assaulted by him every day, while baiting him with Naked Apron?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br> Seconded. Fuck toy that fits you're tiny penis, so it satisfies her completely.</br>  <br>She's not even resisting those girls, she's just letting them have at her.</br>    <br><br>Haruna has end up with quite the lively fantasies in the latest chapter. Even before something happens, she's able to figure out that her pet dog would lick all over her sensitive parts- She's become quite the pervert due to all these groping events.</br></br>    Haruna posters pls go.  Haruna posters pls stay.  <br>as you wish</br>  <br>My penis wants to stay inside Haruna, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Momo please someone has to be secondbestest girl after you.</br>  <br> There are people with a functioning penis in this thread RIGHT NOW who wouldn't impregnate this </br>  <br><br>But I'd rather impregnate this...<br><br>Haruna is simply more sexual than Mikan and Momo.</br></br></br></br>    <br>They got the flattest chests, so they are best girls by default.</br>  <br>I think Haruna has smaller cups than Momo.</br>  <br>I think you need to check out the breasts again</br>  <br> horrible subs <br>Why would you even want that?</br></br>  <br>They have a good speed-to-quality ratio.<br><br>Just look at the Nanoha fansubs who are 2-3 weeks behind, and it's easy to see why.</br></br></br>  Horrible is shit and you should never use it. Speed is not an argument.  <br> Going with CR edits instead. </br>  <br>It's either CR or nothing, nobody subs anything anymore.</br>  <br>doki is very faithful to tlr. I know they're not as fast as hs, but at least they put their heart into it.</br>  New ToloveRu season means more Haruna.  <br>How far do you expect will the anime cover the story?</br>  <br>Didn't it used to be 1 chapter per episode?<br><br>I don't know if it's the same studio as the previous season either.</br></br></br>  Would you?    <br>What the hell.. Is she life sized?<br><br>1:1 scale?<br>How much does that even cost?</br></br></br></br>  <br>1:1? Yes. The 1:8 version is nice too.</br>  <br>They will at least cover it up to chapter 46, I was just hoping for more.</br>  <br><br>Someone printed in on 3d printer</br></br>  I would impregnate Nana.<br>Alot of people don't like her. <br>Dunno why.

The storyline was powerful, especially the ending.<br><br> I'm being serious </br></br>  <br>So is ARM really somehow a completely mundane sports manga, or am I going to get sucker-punched if I go into it expecting that?

Narutaru got so over-the-top that emotional investment was almost impossible.</br></br>  <br>It's written by westerners, too.

What an awful sister.</br>  <br>The devastation was biblical</br>  <br>I actually enjoyed that manga</br>  <br>I could never get into the suffering drama in this. It was hard for me to really get attached to the characters when everything they did was aimed directly at my dick.</br>  <br><br> hurr durr Lolicon did the right decision after statutory rape of the girl </br></br>  <br>Just before she got found she mentioned that she only wanted the MC to father whatever is born from her doing it raw with the punk. Also, she was obviously enjoying the sex better with the punk like the slut she was I don't know why people would wanna be cucked by her but that part of the manga triggered me a bit</br>  <br>She's nine, come on. The dad and the friend are the awful ones.</br>  <br>Okay going to read it.</br>  GUYS<br><br> RINKAS EXCLAMATION BELATE <br><br> WAS RAINED </br></br></br></br>  <br> 127292401 <br>Naruto &lt;3</br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah nah, she knew what she was doing.</br></br></br>  <br> victim blaming </br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Hmm hm...</br>  <br> he doesn't know what statutory rape means <br> "she was asking for it" <br><br>Read the fucking law.</br></br></br></br>  <br> an older teenager actually acts upon his lust on a younger child <br> blame the younger child </br></br>  <br>Okie dokie buddy.</br>    <br> bottom left <br>   Kyon... kun? </br></br>  <br>Mmm-hmm.<br><br> In some common law jurisdictions, statutory rape is sexual activity in which at least one person is below the age required to legally consent to the behavior.[1] Although it usually refers to adults engaging in sex with minors under the age of consent,[1] it is a generic term, and very few jurisdictions use the actual term statutory rape in the language of statutes.[2] </br></br></br>  <br>She still wants his dick after timeskip</br>  <br>Can't you just admit that loli was a slut through and through.</br>  <br>You do realize that regardless of the consent of the minor, if he or she is under the age of consent, that's still rape, right?<br><br><br> S-She was asking for it! The little naked girl is asking for it. <br><br>Found the pedo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> blaming the rape victim </br>  <br> Space Jam <br>All is forgiven</br></br>  <br> the guy himself was blaming himself for raping a little girl <br> n-no, s-she's the slut <br><br>Did you even read it?</br></br></br></br>  Obviously  <br> the guy himself was blaming himself for raping a little girl <br> n-no, s-she's the slut <br>That just further proves she's a slut and rapist.</br></br></br>  <br>She was best girl the entire time.</br>  <br> AMG shit storm spilled over to /tg/ <br> <br>It was beautiful. Such an uproar when something finally fucking happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that there was much of a choice; Aiko was just a psycho and practically no other girl mattered.</br>  <br>the sister fucked up the most.</br>  <br> that's not punpun's mother </br>  <br>that stupid law only applies to the united states and a few other unimportant and illogical countries.</br>  <br>All we need is this.</br>  <br>I hate when characters cut their hair.</br>  <br>you should add like one of the last panels from ressentiment. great manga btw</br>  <br> That just further proves she's a slut and rapist. <br>see <br><br>The minor isn't the rapist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that stupid law only applies to the united states <br> The Japanese Penal Code sets a minimal age of consent of 13.[37] However, all prefectures and districts have (largely similar) "obscenity ordinances" (淫行条例) that forbid "fornication" (淫行) with anyone under 18 years of age, but exempt sex in the context of a sincere romantic relationship (typically determined by parental approval).[38] <br><br>Eve in Japan, he's a rapist, though. Please keep on victim blaming, you piece of shit pedophile.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just waiting for this to turn into a "why men can't accuse women of rape"</br>  Seriously, guys, this "the elementary schooler raped the college student" shit is beyond obvious bait. Stop replying.<br><br><br> Aiko was just a psycho <br>Aiko wasn't really a psycho. She was just scared and not really a functional person. Punpun was far more psycho.</br></br></br></br>  <br> those hands <br><br>It's like a fucking Facehugger.</br></br></br>  <br>i can see this panel being rage inducing if you had a younger sister<br><br>or if you are a virgin</br></br></br>    <br>By being raped?</br>  <br>I hate the Aji Tae one the most.<br>Thank you.</br></br>  <br>By forcing herself on others.</br>  Why did people rage at Kagami no Kuni? Because the author ragequit, or because it was a good manga, or both?  <br> I swear, officer! The nine year old forced herself on me! </br>  All those years of following this manga for nothing.  <br>because it wasn't interesting. mx0 and double arts were less interesting than naruto so Editor in chief had to drop them</br>  <br>does this only occur in the manga? I only watched the anime. do you remember the chapter?</br>  <br>Because the author managed to drive his manga and its sales straight into the ground in just two volumes, and then gave a shitty rushed ending and an "epilogue" chapter that literally resolved nothing, and it was the fucking Mx0 guy, which just made it worse.</br>  <br>Fuck, I wish I never get to know this series.</br>  <br> AVG <br><br>I'm pissed!</br></br></br>  <br>Truly a waste. At least early on she commented on how it was destined that they will fuck.</br>  <br>Best girl won</br>  <br><br>I'm 6'3" and it's my fetish too.<br>I almost wish I was a manlet so it could even be possible at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Kuronekofags</br>  <br> I'm 6'3" and it's my fetish too. <br>To get rejected by a 7" Amazon?</br></br>    <br>Fuck this is one of the few cases where I couldn't handle the edge.
