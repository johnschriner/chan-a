What am I in for, I have never watched a single Gundam.<br><br>Also Finished Ie Naki Ko some time ago and I didn't really like the ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> TL;DR Gundam by Tomino Kawaii </br>  I watched this movie called "Birth" last night. The ending was cool but otherwise it was pretty shit. The animators seriously gave no fucks about proportion.  Finished G Gundam and Ashita no Joe 2. G Gundam was really good, enjoyed it far more than any Gundam since 0079 (have been watching in production order since mid-June) though the second half had a lot of "Wow, really?" moments. <br>Ashita no Joe 2 had a rocky start, what with them retconning the entire last 30 episodes of the first series, but I liked the serious tone a lot more than the first series. It didn't have as memorable of a soundtrack as the first series, but it was still very good. The ending was excellent, though Joe's self-destructive actions mirroring Rikiishi's annoyed me and pleased me at the same time.<br><br>Currently watching Wing, will finish the last 9 episodes later today, and it's not as bad as people say. 40 episodes in and there hasn't been anything that really impressed me, but nor has there been anything that I thought was incredibly bad (aside from a few "euugh" reactions to some outstanding QUALITY). It's not bad, just not very good either. The soundtrack lacks the "oomph" G Gundam and Victory had, and there's a lack of any emotionally charged scenes. The world building is commendable though, as the conflict is very clear and defined as opposed to the previous Gundams, excluding G Gundam. The first OP is nice though, and reminds me of Utena's OP for some reason.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ljX<wbr>FL4dyDIk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gRn<wbr>m-769QLE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>And when I talk about memorable soundtrack for Ashita no Joe, I mean these tracks<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Bf<wbr>jKgLHET0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gBK<wbr>B0Ufu7ic</wbr>  [ ]<br>I've had the second ED stuck in my head for weeks now.<br><br>On that note, post your favourite pre-2000 OSTs.

How does she speak Japanese? Did Papi study or is easy fluency a bird superpower?  <br>What's that?</br>  <br>Consider the common parrot.</br>  <br>Oh shit its angry Miia</br>  Miia is willing to kill herself if darling died.

Just look at places like Somalia where emotions run rampant and science and logic is frowned upon.<br><br>It's probably why the only animes I enjoyed lately have been shows like A/Z, gate, and Mahouka.<br><br><br>I just believe that gay shit should stay out of my animes is all. It has no place. If you want to go make your own homo anime then go make one, but don't put it in my anime where I'm watching it to be entertained not to watch subliminal messages like Avatar did with it's entire nature is good and technology is bad message.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's a funny story.<br>Back in high school, there was this very popular guy in my class, a real ladies man.<br><br>So one day he fucked this one random chick, and she told him not to tell her best friend that the two slept together. Naturally, he assumed that she told him that because her friend liked him too, and it would sour their friendship if she heard her best friend slept with the guy she likes.<br><br>So he started hitting on the other girl and slept with her as well.<br><br>Turns out, the two girls who were best friends were actually a closeted lesbian couple. The other girl admitted to her girlfriend that she cheated on her with him, the truth came out and they broke apart. And everyone started hating on the poor guy because they thought he was a sexist, homophobic, chauvinist pig who wanted to stroke his ego by "converting" lesbians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What kind of person do you think Komari will be when she gets older?  <br>A raccoon.</br>  <br><br>Same seiyuu and personalities.</br></br>  <br> OMOSHIROOO </br>  <br>Nattsun is way more laid back than Mari.
