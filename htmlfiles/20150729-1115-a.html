[ Joukamachi no Dandelion: Aoi shows her Geass. Chapter 9 translated.  That power is way too broken.  <br>Great power comes with great burden and responsibility i guess.

It wasn't too bad. I wish Gon Synchro Summoned something on his first turn instead of the Magnet play. Crow wasn't too bad I guess. Gon played Pendulums and Synchro but it was underwhelming. Not too bad a duel. Doesn't restore my hype though.  I finally realized that Yusei's deck eats through your hand like a motherfucker. No wonder he had to rely on angle baton and graveyard effects alot. Yuma's gagagas need another xyz monster. cowboy and samurai are good at what they do but they need a number  <br>Well Yusei's deck is also largely shit and useless.</br>  <br>I hadn't even thought of that, yes, keikaku right.</br>  <br><br>Dont bump this thread, we still have to go through the old one, let this one die.

All that stuff you mentioned can happen outside of more filler duels. The staff mentioned that the tournament is getting interrupted by Academia and Dennis reveals himself. Just a matter of when. Which is good because honestly it feels pointless. Academia invasion is a better way of making allies and shows proper Lancer capabilities in battle.</br></br>  <br> Make a post about how you aren't going to respond to something <br>But that doesnt make sense.

Just once I'd like to see a tournament fully play out.

Everything else though is anti hype. MESHI duel was stupid, summon chants are ok I guess. The Gon duel wasn't hype.</br></br>  <br><br>1. Nobody brought up a 5 GET.<br>2.

I bet this card was created for the sole purpose of riding duels <br> remember Crow never used against the wind in 5D's <br> remember you couldn't use regular spells in riding duels in 5D's <br><br>Damn that was really a wasted opportunity.

We're getting High Speed Riders in like 2 months, why not print it there since its in the OCG version? Why waste a slot in CORE? <br><br><br>And there was no promotion for it whatsoever.

When exactly do you think Arc-V's quality began it's nosedive?<br><br>I think it was when Sawatari got OTK'd off screen the moment they got to the Syncro dimension.</br></br>  So anybody enjoying this arc still? I don't think it's as bad as you guys are saying.  <br>Thanks for the work, hope Mon feels better.</br>  <br>I'm sick of the writers wanking off Shun</br>  <br><br>I love it<br>Only thing I'm salty about it Action Cards in Riding Duels instead of real Riding duels</br></br></br>  <br>It's not that people dislike Shun.<br>It's that nobody else is allowed to be competent or get the spotlight. <br><br>It's more a problem of the Synchro Arc just being poorly written.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are getting tired of the writer's Shunfaggotry. Brave Claw Revolution can only happen so many times before people get tired of it.</br>  <br> but if you dont like the rules we've all agreed on then you can fuck off <br>Um, I'm pretty sure we didn't agree on those rules.</br></br>  <br>I hate how Standard will eventually incorporate Action cards into all dimensions.</br>  <br>He could at least use Blaze Falcon or Revolution falcon. Rise Falcon has already gotten old.</br>  <br>Don't you like Mario Kart anon?</br>  <br> This may be an ARC-V thread, but it's also a general Yu-Gi-Oh! thread <br>I remember a few months ago people were saying the exact opposite and that only things related to Arc-V should be posted in these thread.</br></br>  <br>What everyone else said, he's being pushed too hard, he's like Cena. <br><br>Now if he was the main character, which would be cool, I'd love him.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm261<wbr>17250</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait til page 8 is pretty accepted on all the general type threads on /a/, there's barely ever any disagreement.

No update for 2 weeks ;_;  <br>Yeah I feel action cards themselves are fine but alot of recent duels arn't as interesting to write using them. Incorporate more traps as well into duels tired of these strategies of just laying your monsters out and then grabbing an action card to make up for bad strategy.</br>  <br>read</br>  <br><br>If you summon it from your hand to their side of the field, then you'd have to have a second one in your hand to summon another one to your side, unless other Kaiju are summoned to your opponent's side as well.<br><br>Sounds like a shit card beyond the token effect, and tokens generally don't last anyways. Well so much for that archetype already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Check the thread.</br>  <br>His computer died or something. I'm willing to wait.</br>  <br>So it's based on getting rid of your opponent's boss by single-tribute Lava Goleming it so that your opponent has a Kaiju and then you can have a Kaiju.<br><br>Basically, you replace your opponent's monster with a Kaiju to have a KAIJU VS KAIJU BATTLE.<br><br>This is so retarded it sounds fun as fuck. And the "You can only control 1 Kaiju monster" seems like an indication they learnt from the Rulers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;you need to discard action cards to build up your action counters <br>That doesnt leave any time to stand around and ZETSUBO</br></br>  <br>You can grab 1 Spell and 1 Trap Action Card per duel. Action Cards are also tailored made for the field spell and not the two individuals decks, which increases the possibility of "I'm playing in a sea field, but I use fire monsters, this 'Increase all water monsters atk by 200' action card does me no good.</br>  <br><br><br>OK glad Mono isn't kill</br></br></br>  <br><br> Incorporate more traps as well into duels tired of these strategies of just laying your monsters out and then grabbing an action card to make up for bad strategy. <br><br>I'm actually okay with that. Yuya has shown against Enjoy that in regular duels he'd put Hippo in defense position to stall, but in Action duels he plays him in attack position to ride him so he can grab an action card to protect him which is more entertaining than to just it there and stall on facedown monsters. <br><br>It just gets annoying when they are able to spam Action Cards with no restriction whatsoever.<br><br>Then again the whole "riding your monster thing" is also non existant in Action Riding duels so that point is moot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently all the kaiju can be summoned on your opponent's field so.</br>  <br> Summon a low-ATK monster or token <br> Special summon that to your opponents side <br> Creature Swap <br><br><br><br>see<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, then that makes it a lot more convenient and better.

We don't know how easy it is to build them up.

Is because of her personality, or her innocent POV at her age?</br>  <br>Nope, it's a Normal Trap card and nowhere does it say it needs nor has to stay on the field.<br><br>Nad it's not really that good honestly, as three battle phases is a bit much. And since it can only be activated in MP, this means even if you activate it in the opponent's turn he can decide to skip their BP.<br><br>Outside of Exodia Stall Trap, the only meta deck I can think of would be Nekroz, since they can stall time by ending BPs and can make use of clearing their own field.<br><br><br>At least it's send to grave instead of destroy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never understood people love for shortstacks fatties like her.<br><br>on that note I'd make love to Eria the water charmer</br></br></br>  <br>She's Yuzu, but even more crude and strong.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Goodbye Towers Turbo. Make place for GOZIRAA</br>  <br>That actually makes the card more interesting, if you can manage to last three turns, you can take a very big advantage, even so if they decide to skip the BP, that's giving you the advantage too. <br><br>It's actually a pretty decent card, it's certainly not Meta, lets be real here, but it's definitely a decent and interesting card by far.</br></br></br>  <br>no, real duelists just win all the by using the most broken combination of cards they can find.</br>  <br>Looks, personality, deck, naivety, everything.

Sawatari sees that there is a time and place for entertainment, and Dennis either uses it as his facade or tries to make a show of things due to his personality. Yuya wants dueling to only be for entertainment both for his audience and himself. <br><br>Jack was right, if Yuya isn't feeling it, if he's worked up or under pressure, he's not doing the entertainment thing for anyone but himself.

I meant that the writers clearly didn't feel the romance was important enough to stop it form turning into a harem.</br></br></br>  <br><br> #7 - To the End of the Flight<br> Touhikou no Hate ni (逃避行の果てに)<br> Aired: Aug 16, 2015 (JST)<br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>----------------------------------<br><br> Episodes<br><br> #5 - The Sound I Will Hear Someday<br> Itsuka Kiita Oto (いつか聴いた音)<br> Aired: Aug 2, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #6 - Unnoticed Happiness<br> Kizukanakatta Shiawase (気づかなかった幸せ)<br> Aired: Aug 9, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #7 - To the End of the Flight<br> Touhikou no Hate ni (逃避行の果てに)<br> Aired: Aug 16, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #8 - Chance Meeting<br> Kaikou (邂逅)<br> Aired: Aug 23, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #9 - The World Not Present<br> Koko ni Nai Sekai (ここにない世界)<br> Aired: Aug 30, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #10 - Plunder<br> Ryakudatsu (略奪)<br> Aired: Sep 6, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #11 - Charlotte<br> Charlotte (シャーロット)<br> Aired: Sep 13, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #12 - Promise<br> Yakusoku (約束)<br> Aired: Sep 20, 2015 (JST)<br><br> #13 - Records of the Future<br> Korekara no Kiroku (これからの記録)<br> Aired: Sep 27, 2015 (JST)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Concert <br><br>Are we getting a concert episode?</br></br></br>  <br>C'mon man. Cut them some slack. At least they add to actual discussion unlike the another ESL shitposter I know of.</br>  <br>No. That is from a LN adaptation of the show that is supposed to show the antics and jobs they do outside of the episodes.</br>  <br>I'mma go find the rest of this 4-koma.</br>  So MC has his power because he hates his own powerlessness, thus possesses others.<br>Charlotte has her power because she wants to disappear from someone.<br>Speedbro has his power because he wants to run away from something/someone.</br></br>  <br>You mean manga, right?</br>  <br>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</br>  Tomori was forced or refused to go to the camp, so she was beaten.<br>The idea was keep Yu away from of Ayumi, leaving her unprotected,so they could kidnap Ayumi, while Yu was in the camp.<br><br>Imagem 2 - Tomori is required to go to a camp to ward off the MC of his sister. Probably Nao it is against and he refused to do so, but she is bullied and beaten.<br><br>Imagem 1 - Tomori appears in the room of the student council all hurt, outcome of events that have occurred in image 2.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's actually really deep<br>What about the sisters' powers?</br></br>  So MC's getting rejected by Nao ?<br>Yusa loves MC?<br>Suddenly Nao gets jealous?<br>Speedbro is forever alone?</br></br></br>  <br>No fuck that. If someone wants to join in a conversation then they have to be able to properly communicate in English.<br>If you cut everyone some slack then you end up with a garbled mess and a bunch of google TL shitposters everywhere.</br></br>  <br><br>Here is the outline of the scene.<br>Who attacks is Tomori is Sala.</br></br></br>  <br>MC doesn't actually get rejected by Nao. There hasn't been any actual confessions (outside of episode 1).</br>  <br>Good I don't want Yuu to get with that bitch, she'd be beaten up most of the time when coming home to him anyway</br>  <br>Their English is better than most people I know and is clearley conveying their messages. We're on the internet, a place of anarchy and freedom.</br>  <br>creators purposely reveal them.<br>The fact is that Tomori is getting someone's order.<br>Only this time she refused to meet so she was beaten.<br>Probably they want to ward off the MC of his sister, and sending them to a camp.<br>Ayumi would be alone and unprotected.<br>Ideal time for her to be kidnapped.<br>probably in episode 6, which is the transition episode for the new phase of the anime, when they return from the camp, it is likely that Ayumi has disappeared.<br><br><br>Remember that Maeda talked about Key Visual<br><br>Left: "The boy confronts fate, even if he loses something precious,"<br>Right: "The monster continues to challenge fate, even if it means forgetting someone precious."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She is shit and so is the show  I love her /a/ help me ;_;   <br>Yeah.<br><br>Anyone notice he's already taken a liking to Nao fast? He felt sorry for her at the end of episode 2, tried to show off in episode 3, and was happy at the end of 4. Also he blushed when he was practically in her chest. Then there's the fact he doesn't really complain about orders anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>It just means you have good taste, Nao is great.</br>  <br>That Ayane Sakura voice. Makes muh blood rush.</br>  <br>Please /a/non. Just accept your feeling for Nao. Confess to her.  Jk, don't. You'll get rejected harder than Jesus was rejected by the Romans. </br>  The MC will have a difficult choice.<br>MC will have to choose who he want to save, Nao or his sister<br>Unfortunately he chooses Nao</br></br>  <br>Not YOU! Yuu Otosaka! PIC. RELATED!  If you pull out that eggman shit, I'm so done with you </br>  <br>I know English is hard, but putting the letters "un" doesn't emphasize fortunate.</br>  <br>Jesus, was he thinking with his dick? Does he hate his sister? Does he believe he'll get his sister with Nao later?</br>  <br> Yuu otosaka <br>But my name isn't Otosaka, are you mistaken?<br>And of course its related, we're in a charlotte thread.</br></br></br>  <br>He can breed with Nao. He can't breed with his sister. It's basic instincts.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>shitposting Nao, you should just ignore them.<br>They are mere fanatics, they create useless topics.<br>spoil all the topics in which they participate.<br>always use the same arguments and always post the same images.<br><br>''We will fight against this cancer for him not to return to if spread us topics again''</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the left mean that confronting fate will help him be with the friends and family he cares for? I don't see any loss.</br>  read the guide buyfag.moe  Reminder: No Togou scale and life isn't worth living.  I'm still disappointed that there were no other Rin scales announce at Wonfest. The aniplex one has a dumb looking face.  Wonfest was nothing but boatsluts and mikushits  <br>at least there was one good figure.</br>    Aren't you glad the USD and Euro are strong against the Yen? <br><br>It almost converts the price 1:1 and makes shipping free.</br></br>  <br>Maybe one day they might make a Ginko figure too</br>  <br>I wish I had a better job and more disposable income to really take advantage of this.</br>    When does the Rin Hoshizora fan book ver. fig come out?<br>amiami.com/top/detail/detail?scode=<wbr>FIGURE-011054<br>its late july already fug</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I can't wait to clean her with  my q-tip </br></br>  Best MF sculptor is now making swords. <br> I like it. </br>  <br>best boy too, hopefully it's not too boring</br>  <br>I'm still mad that even this little shit is getting a scale and Imanotsurugi gets nothing.</br>   payment request for IA/VT Colorful <br>It's finally happening.</br>  Really Aquamarine? That's the shittiest base I've seen.  <br>You should see football Pochaco's base.<br><br>It looks like someone just cut a piece of MDF and used that. Basically the only flaw with an otherwise 10/10 figure.</br></br></br>  <br>Making good bases is a rarely practised art. Some of the large, gorgeous figs are a let down because the characters are just standing on a round piece of plastic.</br>  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually tempted to buy a One Piece figure<br>at least this set is cheap</br>  <br>Do people actually like this art style? I've always thought it just looked shitty.</br>  <br>I never thought it looked good on figures, but this one looks cute as fuck</br>  <br> Trying this hard to fit in <br>You forgot swords and idols.</br></br>  <br>reminder she was in sm brothel around the age shown on your picture</br>  <br>You do know you're supposed to take that off right.<br>It's actually a mirror base.</br></br>  <br>I still can't fathom what the maker thought when he decided on those colors.</br>  <br>I didn't, but that's good.</br>  <br>Pochaco has the prefect fatty body that you just want to fuck, unfortunately her baby face ruines it.</br>  <br>He thought "I'm going to repaint it all white with my cum".</br>  <br>if you like pochacho you've already got shit taste so might as well have shit taste in colours</br>  <br> even better </br>  <br>what the hell is that</br>  <br>1/60 Koto Arbalest's announcement makes the entire event.</br>  <br>That shit is nothing compared to Ayesha's plain white base.</br>  <br>Plain white is fine. It's not interesting but it's not actively offensive either.</br>  It sucks when you get a figure that can 99.99% stand up by itself and then they give it a HUGE base instead of just putting a little base on each foot which would stabilise it and take up significantly less room.  <br>Figures look a hell of a lot nicer with a base than without.</br>  So, did they show anything related to pic related during wonfes?  Is there a gallery I can go too that will show me everything from Wonfest?  Lewd.  <br>I just want clear bases and across all lines. This is the most practical solution. the decorative shit just detracts from the figure.</br>  <br>BEAT's Tamamo? Unfortunately, nothing.</br>  How stupid am I for wanting this? She's a 1/3 scale doll. Shipping will be stupid expensive.  <br>Sometimes unique bases can be great, but I also like the uniformity that clear bases can give across a collection.</br>  <br> 1GBP = 192.89 JPY <br>What a time to be alive.</br></br>  <br>To me that looks like crap. The bottom of the dress looks ratty and hangs in a weird way. Just way for the RAH version. I'm sure that will happen and look a thousand times better.</br>  <br>Between that diamond Miku and this, it's like they're not trying with poses anymore.<br><br>Can you even curl 3 toes without curling the first 2?</br></br></br>  <br>Nope nothing new on that and I've been on the usual twatter tags for it the last few days.<br>But I don't have big hopes for it to be shown anytime soon tbh.<br>FLARE did enough for me!<br>And I'm curious how Broccoli will handle her Goth lolita costume. Too bad there are no better pictures of the prototype though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. I'd never even thought about the curled toes, that's actually pretty much impossible to do.</br>  How are you supposed to display figures that don't have stands?  <br>Have you looked at the pricetag?<br><br>Azone's other homu doll looks kinda sorta acceptable, but not really great either.<br><br>But that just looks like shit. And that's in a promo picture. In real life they often look worse to some degree.<br>Specifically the jagged fringes of her half-skirt look bad.<br><br><br><br>I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The people whose arms get cut off/deformed and then learn to use their feet like hands probably can.</br>  <br>I love this Yuuki.</br>  <br> I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially. <br>I hadn't thought of that. Though now I'm wondering if I can train my toes to do the vulcan salute.<br><br><br>That's disturbing, but a valid point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile on Paypal:<br><br> 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY </br></br></br>  <br>I think this is impossible to recreate as shown. I remember vaguely someone telling that it has something to do with the way the tendons are attached. I think the feet look weird but not unacceptable but its obviously pandering to a certain demographic.</br>  <br>Like figures that are laying? Just put them on the shelf, or on something soft on the shelf.</br>  <br>for that purpose<br>I'm not afraid to pay AmiAmi with my shitty visa classic, and my bank's rates are tons better.</br></br>  <br>Attach magnets to their feet.</br>  <br>Nah, standing up. Just doesn't have a stand.</br>  anybody have her yet?  <br>too puffy. no thong.</br>  <br>Just checked wikipedia. Looks like the small toes mostly move as a group although the little toe can move somewhat independently.<br><br>Let's conclude miku is not human.</br></br></br>  When she's up to pre-order tell me  <br>I think she'll go great with Misa, but I'm begging for a  cast-on .</br>  <br> FREEing <br>I'll be keeping my money</br></br>  <br>thats why I didnt pre-order it, but its takane so I really wanna know how it turned out</br>  <br> thong <br>disgusting</br></br>  <br> I'm glad I'm not the only one. </br>  <br>I like how they conveniently leave out the angle with her disgusting lumpy stomach.</br>  <br>That's the reason why review blogs exist.</br>  Where can I get a rotating base like the ones reviewers use to take photos of figures?  <br> tfw canadian </br>  <br>Well thanks to my country's economy failing it's now 3 to 1, but somehow I still have to get all those plastic butts</br>  <br>What country?</br>  <br>Same as Noodles, Malaysia</br>  Enjoy the twenty-eighth of July.  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  Has anyone here used suruga-ya.jp?<br><br>It's got an obscure book I want but seems kind of shifty</br></br>  <br>They sometimes are a bit slow but otherwise good.<br>Oh, and they didn't include a preorder CD once even though it was listed.</br></br>  <br>The picture actually made me laugh. Thanks, you too.</br>  Where's my fucking Feito, Alter?    <br> shifty <br>Nah, they're fine. Don't expect perfect books though, even if they don't mention any damage.</br></br>    <br>So I should go with the second linked book then?<br><br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185135613001<br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185025353001<br><br>They're the same book but the fact that they're mentioning damage in the first one might mean that it's really bad</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  THREE MORE WEEKS  <br>If they can balance on their own you can just put them on a shelf like any other figure. The downside is that they won't be as stable.</br>  <br>Is FREEing really that bad? From some of the reviews I've seen they weren't so bad.</br>  <br><br>I've just had her shipped RSAL from Amiami, pretty hype, her hair seems like it would be brittle as fuck though.</br></br>  <br>It can't be as bad as Racing Miku 2011's can it?</br>  <br>Yes, avoid Rank B items in general. With that price difference I'm guessing there's some really visible damage. The second listing might not be perfect, but it at least shouldn't have tears or stains.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>   store exclusives are still a thing   <br>Their 1/8s can be pretty subpar for the price. Their 1/4s often look great.</br>  I remember an anon use too post pictures of Magician Miku every thread hoping a figure would be made of her. I guess he gave up hope.  <br> memegenerator </br>  <br>Will we ever see more BRS figs?

Economically speaking, what would happen if Greece is bombed? Would it be that bad?</br></br>  <br>Unless you modify the settings, Paypal automatically uses its own shitty conversion rate rather than the interbank exchange rate.<br><br>For example 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY whereas the interbank exchange rate is 1 GBP = 192.92 JPY. Exchanging £100 under Paypal's rates would cost you £4.50 compared to if you had exchanged under the interbank rate.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it a little early for europoors to be up?</br>  <br> 6pm <br> Early </br></br>  <br>Half 6/half 7 in the afternoon?<br><br>Yeah mate.</br></br></br>  <br>PayPal's rates are always at least 2.5% behind the current rate, sometimes more since they update just twice a day.<br><br>If you use a card through them you can change it to use your bank's exchange rate. Otherwise you're stuck with PayPal's rate.</br></br></br>  <br>The value of the Euro would decrease even further meaning plastic butts would become even more expensive than they already are.<br><br>The only good thing is that if they bomb hard enough we might EVENTUALLY stop pouring down billions of tax money into their shitty country.<br><br><br>How can I sleep when my country is falling apart around me thanks the the EU?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope.

Although I'll probably get my goods well after the event (delays and whatnot), and someone will might scan it before me.</br></br></br>  <br>nah</br>  <br>I like this one more.</br>  <br> Do you eat shit? <br> Nisekoi <br>Goes without saying</br></br></br>  <br><br>The winter one is the best.</br></br>  <br>I go through cycles of which one I like the most. Which is why I've never pulled the trigger on any of them.</br>  nothing will happen if I just let myself get banned from BiJ by not paying, right?<br>I have about 20 preorders but im starting to think it would just be better if I only bought preowned stuff from Manda, it's cheaper, I'd just have to wait longer.<br><br>What would happen to things which I already paid for but dont come out for months?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  Do you dare post  your MFC?   <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Why he is so damn expensive<br><br>30K</br></br>  <br><br>Good taste, anon.</br></br>    <br><br>Iwata's ashes in every one.</br></br>  <br><br> http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/R_Dorothy</wbr> <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/R_Dorothy</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Get both.<br>They're both good.</br></br>  <br>Yes but I've got no reason to or nothing interesting on there so I won't.</br>  <br>Is that yours? in any case keep posting.</br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>not mine</br>  <br>All four main ones I mean, the Nise, both Bakes and and the MSS snow one.<br><br>I would definitely get more than would if I had the  space. </br></br></br>  <br>I'd get all four but I feel four crabs is a bit much.<br>I've got the winter and the staircase, and the black &amp; white weird looking ones with the name I can't remember.</br></br>    <br>the weld is not that bad</br>  <br>I am so fucking happy about him, even if the paint job turns out like shit I will buy him and paint him myself.</br>  <br> filename </br>    <br>Bruvva, we should be glad for Abenomics still.<br>Yes, we are undervalued 20%... but JPY is undervalued 30-40% easily.<br><br>Now let us all pray.</br></br></br></br>  black panties.    <br>It's a strange problem to have when a series has too many figures, I suppose.<br><br>Ougi's looks really nice but I'm not sure she/he is for me yet.</br></br></br>  <br> being a faggot </br>    <br>Doesn't compensate for the stupid face.</br>  <br>Answering to obvious bait.</br>  <br> spoilering the one with nipples but not the other two with visible vagina <br>Good job, anon.</br></br>      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128719604 <br> 16 <br>Mods.</br></br>  <br>I thought that tumblr pictures/gifs were frowned upon thanks to their low quality/terrible colors/awful compression and unnecessary watermarks, but I guess it's now just a meme spouted by crossboarding rusemasters and kids trying to look extreme.</br>  <br>You generally do the inspection yourself if they demand it.<br>I had it happen.<br>Just show them each item and the empty box and you're good.<br>They don't really care about what's under the bubble wrap if everything seems to be normal.<br>Especially if they can clearly see it's Japanese or other shit they won't understand anyways.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah fuck it</br>  <br>I'm close to grabbing her myself.<br>I just started watching the series because of this figure. I want to get at least halfway through before deciding but already I adore her.</br></br>  <br>You should watch the end, but you probably know how it ends just by browsing /a/.</br>   those joints    IA/VT finally came out <br>Thank fuck</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128719604 <br>good taste, mostly.</br>  <br>Paid for it this morning. Fucking excited.</br>  <br>I don't, thankfully.<br>Hope I can keep it that way.</br></br>  <br><br>People will actually buy this</br></br>  <br>Thank you, anon!</br>  <br> It seems like she will be the same titty monster like the PHAT's one <br>That's obvious due to the nature of the costume of course!<br>And yeah I'm also not a big fan of the face they stuck her with.<br>But tbh I don't have high hopes for Broccoli to do it right.<br>Thank god for FLARE their work on her in her best clothes!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can curl my last three pretty easily. Some people just have more control over their toes I guess.</br>  Anybody know how Amazon.co.jp handles pre-orders?<br>Same way as .com? So I'm charged on the day it's released?</br>  I'm so depressed.<br>i really wanted to support my waifu in any way I can, but there's no way I can shill this piece of shit.<br>I can't believe they fucked up this bad, her eye's are way too light, her winking face looks like shit and worst of all her midriff.<br>God damn her fucking midriff, how they fuck it up so bad?<br>NO FUCKING NAVEL, what the flying fuck? And the cherry on top of the shit sundae is that huge fucking seam right across that fucking painted tree stump they call a torso just looks awful, of course they covered it with that claw grip stand before so you couldn't see it.<br>Yes she has decently cute smiling expressions but this is just unacceptable at 7,400 yen, her terrible torso complete ruins it, how the fuck could they just make her body a stick with no navel?<br>I might still buy it because fuck it, but I will hate myself if she ends up getting a figma or any decent figure that's not the nendoroid.<br>She's available for preorder tomorrow if you're interested, please support my waifu in any way you can, but I'm not expecting you to buy this injustice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, we are undervalued 20% <br><br>20%? Are you shitting me?<br><br>We used to get between 1,6 and 1,7 USD per Euro. We are undervalued FAR more than 20%</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then definitely watch it completey before buying her figure.</br>  <br>You're cute</br>  <br>What country you nigger</br>  <br>Nor everyone has the same hobby as you anon.</br>  <br>closed mouth version looks ok to me in my opinion</br>  <br>Murrica strong.<br>30% tops, maybe around $1.50 at most.<br>Still, if Yen wasn't weak it wouldn't make a difference.</br></br></br>  <br> but I will hate myself if she ends up getting a figma or any decent figure <br> not buying multiple figures of your waifu if they exist </br></br>  <br>T-thanks anon, you too.</br>  <br>Naziland.</br>  <br>The RAH is just as terrible.<br><br>dolls only work with more clothes, not less.</br></br></br>  <br>Best Crab. The only one that got the face right.</br>  <br>The RAH looks better but her clothes look like a 3 star diner napkin.</br>  I hope to God the autoscorers get a figma or something. Preferably Leiur  <br>pls halp</br>  <br> You generally do the inspection yourself if they demand it. <br>Why do they even want inspections in person anyway? I've received packages resealed with german customs tape, so they clearly open them themselves anyway.</br></br>  <br>elbow and ankle joints look like shit. and the napkin is part of the shittyness.<br><br>really, hestia only works when her clothing is skin-tight and shows off curves. Not to mention that the ribbon does not work in 3D-land</br></br></br>  <br>You already answered your own question.</br>  <br>No idea, usually they open mine by themselves as well. I guess it only happens occasionally if you fetch it in person, which was the case then.<br><br>Just meant to refute the 'inspect in front of you' thing.<br>It's not general procedure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But with a question. So it's like .com?<br>Their FAQ isn't very helpful in answering.</br></br>  <br> expecting this <br> still haven't even gotten a Chris figma </br></br>  <br>let's just leave the articulated anime girls to figma. <br> actual hair <br> actual cloth clothing <br> those knees <br><br>just..stop</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you are charged when orders are shipped.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br> wanting a figma of worst girl </br>  <br>At least she got a nendo. In two color schemes even. Better than nothing.</br>  <br> I will hate myself if she ends up getting a figma or any decent figure that's not the nendoroid. <br>Why buy something you don't like just because it has your waifu's name on it? Just settle for something better if and when it comes. And if you really want something of her and another thing gets released, just get both.</br></br>  <br>Thanks a lot.<br><br><br>Noooooo</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/TKOFacade</wbr> <br><br>Been at this shit for about 6 months, finally starting to move away from joints.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think some britbong told a story of having his opened in front of everyone in a post office.<br><br>Uncivilized pigs.</br></br></br>  <br> mine still proccesing shipping <br><br>I really need her. ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Just read a summary of the plot out of curiosity.<br> God I fucking hate mysterious Japanese illnesses with no name or explanation </br></br>  <br>The Gears need some GX stuff first.</br>  <br>Nice blog. where do I subscribe?</br>  <br><br>I highly doubt this.

Has anyone ever altered an order to shift from one version of an item to another with them?  <br>I really like the sculpt, in fact I own almost every single one of the sculptor's figures, but this has nothing to do with rikka. Could honestly just be a girl with blue hair and an eyepatch. still might order it, but I don't like the colors and lack of gradient.</br>  <br> Q. There is now a version of the item I ordered with an AmiAmi exclusive bonus. Can I switch to that version? <br>A. Yes. Please contact us with your order ID number and the item code of the item you would like upgraded. We are able to upgrade items only if the version with the AmiAmi exclusive bonus is currently available. Please do not place a new order for the AmiAmi version, and keep in mind that we cannot downgrade items or switch items between editions (eg. regular edition to limited edition or vice versa).</br></br>  <br>You just email them. They'll switch it.</br>  <br>What these two said:<br><br><br><br>I've never had an issue in the past.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This looks like a horrible 80s toddler doll.</br>  <br> lack of gradient <br>What does that mean?</br></br>  <br>Flat colors.</br>  <br> http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/Joul</wbr> <br><br>Beware my shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/OmegaMecha</wbr></br>  <br>We got these.</br>  <br> Tharja, Anubis and Jehuty <br>Jelly as fuck</br></br>  Here is anon's step by step guide to over 100 likes on MFC.<br><br>Step 1: write your comment, make sure its positive, making a joke or meme about your wallet helps.<br><br>Step 2: the most important step, post a gif of the character that you're commenting on, doesn't matter if its relevant, just get any ol gif from google, hell you can skip step 1 if you want.<br><br>Thats it, you're welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the fuck would you post this here?</br></br>  <br>Are we also getting Falcon of Light Griffith or just Femto?</br>    <br> must <br> not <br> post <br> bingo chart </br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you consider MFC to be a social network or what?</br>  <br>Honestly neither of the two really sold me on Revoltechs which is why i didn't collect the other Frames.</br>  <br>I still don't get it.</br>  <br>Don't really know how to explain it better, I'm not the one you're asking anyways.<br>It could use some more shading on the whole.</br></br>  Anyone want to buy my Selvaria?  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Also, shinkis.</br>  <br>I'm excited for hotarumaru</br>  <br>Every time I see more detail of this my heart sinks lower.

Was it his real face?  <br>That's what I'm thinking too.</br>  <br>Probably since everyone comments how average and unpopular is and how Ainz himself says that his own self-evaluation dropped by few grades later on.</br>  <br><br>At least we will get a new LN chapter in 4 days.<br><br>The bad news is that  it is a climb chapter. </br></br></br></br>  <br>4 days to new chapter, s-so it's not all that bad right?<br><br> It's all that bad. </br></br></br>  <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>It was face of old japanese man with some wrinkles and scars buti'm not sure about the last one</br>  <br><br><br>I think it mentions him using an older mans face or something.</br></br></br>  <br>God that was graphic, i hope they dont censor any part of it</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Shallchair <br>kek<br>Any place have vol 5 translated?</br></br></br>  <br>   it is a climb chapter. </br>  <br>The same place as usual nigga.</br>  <br> Ainz took off his helmet after finishing, surprising the four of them with his looks.<br>"Black hair and eyes just like Nabel-san, you don't seem to be from around here. I heard people like Momon-san are common in the south, do you hail from there?"<br><br>"Yes, we came from a land faraway."<br>“He is older than expected, old enough to be called 'uncle’.” <br>- Vol 2 Chp 1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  CLIMB IS REALLY INTERESTING  So far we've seen that the guardians are capable of acting outside of Ainz's direct orders due to various reasons.<br><br> Demiurge willing to fight Shalltear after being told not to. Shalltear losing control due to Blood Frenzy and then attacking people she had no business attacking because she was afraid of failing Ainz, Sebas who doesn't fully prioritize Nazarick above saving people. And finally Cocytus who wants to spare the lives of worthy lizardmen. <br><br>Does PD have anything he can actually work with here if he's cunning and pokes at these characteristics? While the guardians would probably never purposefully betray Ainz, I think there might be some flames to fan if PD plays his cards right.</br></br></br></br>  WHEN IS HAMUSUKE?    <br>Me too. I loved reading that part.</br>  <br>Maybe 2 weeks</br>  Being a skeleton must feel really nice  <br><br><br>It's not like Nazarick's servants even hate humans though. They just think of them as lesser beings, because, for the most part, they are. They respect strength, and the only truly strong humans would be other Player Characters.<br><br>Disregarding that, anyone who Ainz said was to be treated with respect would be. Full stop. Even if they were a cripple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Narbel but older and male.</br>  repost from last thread<br><br>I wonder who would suit her more. Personally I kind of pictured Kana Asumi would do her the most justice.</br></br>  Is there any reason why the manga is sporadic in release dates for english translation?  <br>It's a monthly manga.</br>  <br>Even if the manga is released monthly it still depends on the translation release by the guys translating it.</br>  <br>pretty sure they're just mobs that spawn on her floor and she drags them with her because she's to lazy to walk on her own. That, and her personal sex toys.</br>  <br><br>This. Most of Nazarick evaluates the world like so:<br><br>Supreme Beings &gt; Direct Creations (Mostly Floor Guardians or people like Pandora's Actor) &gt; Lieutenants &gt; Named Mobs &gt; Automatically Produced Mobs &gt; Worthy Enemies &gt; Random People &gt; Enemies<br><br>There's a few exceptions, like Cocytus valuing the Lizardmen more than the mass produced mobs and Sebas in general, but for the most part, anything with a Nazarick label on it is more unimportant that anything without for any inhabitant of Nazarick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  At this point in the anime, is it even clear that Ainz is ACTING how he believes the leader of Nazarick should be acting?<br><br>I feel like telling those quibbling about the "cliched" exchange between Ainz and Nigun or Ainz "showing off" that they're completely missing the point.</br></br>   Touch Me had a brother who played a Human Mage <br> Said brother is   the only surviving member of the Eight Greed Kings and wants nothing to do with the world <br><br>Man, awkward.</br></br></br>  HITTEN MITSURUGI RYU<br><br>KUZU RYU SEN</br></br>  <br> double Tsubamegaeshi </br>  So I really love this so far don't get me wrong, but  how is this any different than Mahouka gary stu bullshit? It's basically the same thing but with good characters and no useless bullshit masturbatory writing <br>Is the MC ever getting any good conflict or opposition? Honestly I find the worship scenes kinda creepy, even thought that's how Kings are, it's been 3 times so far with such scenes in the anime.</br>  I've read all the manga so far, where would that place me for the LN? Like volume and chapter wise?  <br> Is the MC ever getting any good conflict or opposition? <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> Ainz has a sense of smell and touch despite being a skeleton. <br><br>That's not fair, he should have to sacrifice important aspects of being alive like the rest of us.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty much the same to be honest.<br><br>We're just here for Albedo and Narberal. The novels aren't really that good either.</br></br></br>  <br>Less incest.<br><br>Fuck you nerd I'm hear to see the fights. Why are they so much clearer than everything else?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because a lot of the fights are from the villains perspective.</br>  <br>sykthewood's blog, the mega or the googledrive.</br>  Can someone tell me if the color palette on the picture is actually correct?<br><br>This looks way too red for my tastes.</br></br>  <br> with good characters  <br> no useless bullshit masturbatory writing <br>That's literally enough to make a world of difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's another picture for comparison.</br>  <br>Well yeah that's why I really love it anyway.<br><br><br>Great, thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What's that red orb Ainz has below his ribcage?<br><br>It's not his fucking phylactery is it? What kind of Lich carries his phylactery on him, rather than buried in an admantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about that one  lich? </br>  Why did spoopy skeleton let soldiers die if he was going to kick theocracy ass anyway  <br>Because he doesn't really care.</br>  <br>He's not dead<br>...right?</br></br>  <br> He wasn't going to do shit till they said they were going to kill the villagers. Pay attention.</br>  <br>I meant the random nameless soldiers</br>  <br>What it is hasn't been mentioned as of vol 5. It seems unlikely liches even had phylacteries in Yggdrasil.</br>  <br><br>Why do you have the need to see anime with bullshit shounen fights?<br>Try thinking past the individual fights. it's not about IF he wins or loses, it's about HOW</br></br></br>  <br> What kind of Lich carries his phylactery on him, rather than buried in an admantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible? <br><br>The ones that don't want to revive trapped into a adamantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible?<br><br><br>Didn't you heard? Humans are like insects for him. Just those to which he talked are being upgraded to "small animal" status.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a World Class item.</br>  <br>In the LN he had more intrest keeping the villagers safe so he went and made sure they were safe before doing anything else.</br>  <br> forgetting overlord has one of the most bullshit shonen fights ever. </br>  <br>Oh. Literally who cares?<br><br><br>Of course, and? The way he defeated anything so far was excessively simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These:<br><br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a fucking Lich. By definition, he's a powerful spellcaster. If he can't even cast teleport, he shouldn't be a fucking Lich.</br></br>  Could someone make a .webm of Albedo freaking out because Ainz got damaged/  <br><br>Nigger, please, this is an anime about an all powerful skeleton and his Eldritch abomination pals putting humans in their place.<br><br>How can you not think that this is pretty motherfucking cool is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> What's that red orb Ainz has below his ribcage? <br>same this that  skullgreymon  got</br></br>  <br><br>I got a boner while reading it.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon for telling me which answers were real.</br>  <br>If you place your phylactery in a location where everyone who can teleport can go you could just as well take it with you, at least it would be under your eyes and there wouldn't be an adamantium chamber to protect any teleporting invader from the lava and the guardians.</br>  <br>Is that a later vol spoiler? I can't recall him mentioning anything about that orb at all.</br>  So which do you prefer /a/?<br><br>Playing as a powerful evil overlord from the get-go, or playing as a an inexperienced adventurer with no insta-win abilities but becoming a legendary figure through hard work, wit and effort?</br></br>  <br>Well, considering the Death Knight scene showed decapitation and some other cool junk, we might get a watered-down hug scene at the very least.</br>  <br>See this is what I don't get. Did Ains suddenly lose all empathy and whatnot, and if so, is this something that will be addressed later?</br>  <br>Do I have to be evil?</br>  <br>I never said it wasn't fucking COOL as fuck nigger.<br>It just need more opposition to make things more interesting on top of the COOL<br>And it apparently will, so it's great news</br></br></br>  <br>I want to start as a no-body weakass warrior who becomes a powerful allmighty lich later.</br>  <br><br>Why would you tell anyone about the location? Why wouldn't you place an artifact in there that prevents inward teleportation but allows outward? Think, anon.</br></br>   Lv1 D&amp;D spells <br>I fucking love this show.<br><br>What race was Touch Me, btw?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that some Quest for Glory?<br><br>Because holy shit that might be the best game series ever made.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did Ains suddenly lose all empathy <br>Why do people keep asking this? He literally says that is what happened to him. Are you people even reading or are you just looking at the pretty pictures?</br></br>  <br><br>Dragonkin with a human base form.<br><br>Basically the same as Sebas.<br><br><br><br>Fucking hell, is that Quest for Glory? I haven't played that in years,<br><br>Wizard Best Class.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragonkin.</br>  <br>Hasn't been revealed yet as of vol 5</br>  <br>It was mentioned in the web novel versions of the events in Vol 7.<br> In the WN the priest thinks the red orb is Ainz's weak point and tries punching it, does nothing, then Ainz goes on a long explanation about what the orb is and how it's not an actual weak point, etc, etc. </br></br>  <br>Dragonkin, as far as I know.</br>  <br> Why would you tell anyone about the location? <br>Scrying nigger<br> Why wouldn't you place an artifact in there that prevents inward teleportation but allows outward? <br>Then how would you get there in the first place?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Everyone creates a cool NPC. <br> Touch Me makes himself as an NPC <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Because fuck you, he's Touch Me.</br>  <br>The man was a extreme paladin.</br>  <br>Because nobody could think of anything cooler.</br>  <br>In the novel is more evidenced, but even in the anime he already said that being in a Lich bodies is influencing him, and that he found disconcerting the fact that could see the massacre without feeling anything. <br><br><br>Yeah, just know that while this anime season is gonna end in one helluva fight   against the red knight in the opening   who is a mind controlled Shalltear    the true enemies aren't gonna appear still, and they work much more behing the scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dayum, Albedo going crazy is tasty.</br>  <br><br>Where's all this dragonkin stuff coming from? I don't think anything pertaining to Touch Me's race has ever been revealed.</br></br>  So does ainz ever meet the surviving member of the eight kings of greed?  <br>I haven't read the source material, is this an actual plot point which will be addressed later?</br>  <br> Wanting people to oppose Ains-sama <br> ''COOL'' </br></br>  You spawn on the New World as the last MMORPG character youve played as.  <br><br> not putting in an anti-scry spell <br><br>That's basic shit.<br><br> spend a few years reading a book while Thralls build a chamber around you <br> then TP out <br><br>Honestly, the magma is just for the atmosphere.

I don't care if you're okay with the idea of him having one or two concubines. Stop. </br>  aots by far  <br>An unreliable narrator making an off-hand statement does not seem like the end all be all of a MAJOR character development.</br>  <br> Never played a MMO <br>Welp.</br></br>  <br> my level 40ish fem TERA goat demon <br>The hell did I do to deserve this?</br></br>  <br> Summon my succubus, have sex <br> You are dead.</br></br>  <br>level 90 mithra from ffxi.

I miss Jeff Goldblum  <br><br>Pick one or more as desired:<br>a) The manga has a very distinctive artstyle that the show has eschewed in favor of a cuter, "safer" look<br>ii. The show has taken some liberties with the source material, with one scenario that doesn't crop up until chapter 66 of the manga being adapted in episode 4 of the anime. Note that these later chapters often feature characters that haven't been properly introduced in the anime yet.<br>3: The manga itself takes about 15 chapters to hit its stride. Those familiar with the source material are unlikely to buy in until the anime reaches that point, since even the original wasn't anything special until then.<br>IV- The character who saves the manga won't formally debut until episode 6, probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goldblum has another threadly dose else to fawn over when there's nothing Kyoani now.</br>  <br>They abandoned the manga art style for a more generic "safe" style.

The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were infected in the school. She didn’t see them, but had expected them now for days. Her note to her students were not read to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>Megumi was a school teacher for fourteen months. When she was teaching she watched the highschoolers and she said to the principal “I want to be teach at the school.”<br>principal said “No! You will BE KILL BY INFECTED”<br>There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got working he stopped. But now in the Megugaoka High school of the Yokosuka she knew there were infected.<br><br><br>“This is Kurumi” the megaphone crackered. “You must find the antidote!”<br>So Megumi left her emergency manual and opened the shutter.<br>“IT GOING TO KILL US” said the Rii<br>“I will shove at him” said the Shovel and she shoved the shovel. Megumi ran at him and tried to shack him off. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>“No! I must kill the zombies” she shouted<br>The radio said “No, Megu-nee. You are the zombies”<br>And then Yuki was a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Text in pictures isn't hard, but mspaint isn't the best so I can't help.</br>   I think Hika's a zombie. She was driven off by the other group when she received a very minor injury with the other girls following her, hence her reacting when Kurumi brought them up. The entire other group of violent hyper-pragmatists couldn't reach the food store and generator despite massive tensions due to the lack of electricity, but apparently Hika alone was able to find it - perhaps thanks to zombie stealth. That would also have been where the serum was, whether or not she's mentioned it to the others yet or not.   <br>It's a lot harder than people think.<br><br>Or at least a lot more tedious.</br></br></br>  <br>Just dropping the size and centering would improve it.

You've posted that every thread, we know. You can move along now.</br>  <br>It's not what it does, it's that it does it well.</br>  <br>Every thread</br>  I'm reading the manga and I stopped in the scene with that helicopter guy. Why did he destroy the medicine? Was it because it had terrible consequences?<br>Why did he get infected? Is it because the disease could be transmitted airborne?<br> Kurumi's already dead isn't she? </br></br>  <br>Definitely a broom. She doesn't seem comfortable without some wood in her hands.</br>  <br>There is an airborne disease, but we don't know how he was infected. He crushed the picture and the medicine because lol zombie tremors.</br>  <br>why the fuck are you namefagging</br>  <br>Welcome to /gg/.</br>  <br>Why are you such a fucking idiot incapable of reading blatant visual cues?</br>  <br>non namefags pls go.<br> just kidding </br></br>  <br>No, there's not anything airborne. There has been literally nothing indicating that.<br><br><br>Here. Use your eyes. He's just meant to indicate that the serum isn't permanent and must be reapplied and to foreshadow what's gonna happen to Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But thinking of the most obvious conclusions is boring.</br>  <br>Radio girl gets infected inside isolated bunker</br>  <br>Radio girl was already infected, like pilot-kun, and went through her serum supply. If there was anything airborne, all the School Living Club would be dead by now as they all were in Radio-chan's bunker.</br>  <br>She could have been infected before going into the bunker.<br><br>Hell, she could have not been infected at all and just have been sick and lonely.</br></br></br>  <br> There has been literally nothing indicating that. <br>The hazmat suits imply it might be. At least one of the strains might be.</br></br>  <br>This is why I hate these threads. People like you keep making stupid conclusions up while people like  completely points out why you're wrong.<br><br>Every time, every thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Just finished watching the first two episodes, Kurumi is hard as fuck.<br><br>What's the general consensus on the show thus far? I'm enjoying it, but haven't read the source. Is the adaption generally doing a good job so far/Is the source worth going through or should I just keep watching?</br></br></br>  <br>anon if he's namefagging he's probably baiting or just a newfag. In either case, you shouldn't reply to him.</br>  <br>I agree. She's better than Yuki. She gets shit done. Yuki's annoying but really without her they would all be crazy or something.</br>  <br>They've been changing a few things  for the better . It's generally a good thing to read the source though because  Megu-nee is dead. </br>  <br>Most people not drop it and pretty positive response.<br>Beware the fanbase though.<br>As usual read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to stick around GG threads, read the source material. If you want to experience the anime without spoiling yourself with the manga, you'd best avoid these threads.

When people say the anime is better than the manga, they're not saying that lightly.  and I am in fact in disagreement. </br>  <br>Nobody's saying the anime is better than the manga, just the the anime is a worthy adaptation and that the differences from the manga are justified.</br>  <br>It's better in the sense that it added little bits and pieces that the manga didn't have the chance to put in. If the mangaka wasn't in charge of the composition it'd probably get shat on</br>  <br>It's amazing how autistic someone has to be to do this, but what's even more amazing is the fact he thinks it's fine</br>  <br>It's really fine. Media is referenced by writers all the time, and Gakkou Gurashi is clearly written quite well. While any "serious" reference to an anime or manga may come off as retarded or autistic to someone familiar with it, you can't forget that it is in fact a proper work of fiction written by a single person in an attempt to tell a serious story, and is thus worthy of analysis. I feel that anyone going out of their way to do so does it tongue-in-cheek, knowing that it's kind of silly, but also with enough effort to uncover some hidden truth in the writing or application that might not be obvious.</br>  <br>Have this</br>  <br><br>It's funny how many people have no idea what actually is autistic.

Yuki is suffering from very deep-rooted denial.</br>  <br>Miki is not a professional psychologist, however.<br><br> I personally agree with that interpretation, but it needs to be said regardless. </br></br></br>  scanlation when?  <br>Miki doesn't know shit. The way Yuuki acted when she snapped out of it (around chapter 30) suggests actual delusions, not just denial.</br>  <br>Miki observed her firsthand and had medical books to help. If she was wrong then the author would have found a way to correct her. Miki's diagnosis is what the author left us with, not your speculation.</br>  <br>Nigga...</br>  <br> open sea oil rig <br><br>With how fast those things fuck up, it'd be a 3 episode series. <br><br>The ending would be brutal as fuck.

If you agree with it, that's cool, but don't try to pass it as fact. It wasn't presented that way.</br>  <br>Miki fag detected. In all seriousness her delusions were very much so real to her. Psychosis and delusions are most certainly what she had, and those are both actual ailments. They were brought on by her Post Traumatic Stress, the author is just trying to make it sound weird and unique with the "Nobody's ever had these symptoms before" trope.</br>  <br>That's ok, after episode 3 the anime can be about EPA lolis trying to fix the massive oil spill the Oil Rig lolis made. And then we can have lawyer lolis as they sue the company responsible for damags and lost wages of the local fisherman.</br>   You'll never be free from these threads    deconstruction of the CGDCT genra <br><br>I hate this trend of creating a show just to do a super edgy inversion/deconstruction of it.

Either that or drop it when she does.  <br>She was taking Miki's place</br>  <br>I just can't continue if Shovel dies to death.</br>  <br>I want an incredibly realistic slow-paced story about all the aspects of a man-made environmental disaster. And every character is a cute girl.</br>  This is why vns like Planetarian work really well. You need something cute, a girl with a very innocent worldview, and to place her in a situation she doesn't understand. She continues to pretend everything is okay but really, deep down, she can sense nothing will ever be the same again.

You're ignoring the truth bub, she was bullied.</br>  <br>The first time I saw Goth-chan I was, "She's really friends with this moe cathat girl? She sorta looks like she'd be a snooty bully to her, I guess I shouldn't judge people based on appearances." GUESS I SHOULD ALWAYS JUDGE BASED ON APPEARANCES</br>  <br>I think I remember seeing it in a past thread, but I must not have saved it.</br>  <br>All they said was look at her hat, it was a compliment if anything, no one would really bully Yuki she gets along with everyone.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Now I know you're trolling. You're that "What zombie apocalypse, it's just a SoL" fag, aren't you?</br>   Watashi tachi wa koko ni imasu~   <br>People always giggle quietly to each other before they compliment me.  It's because they all have crushes on me and giggle like schoolgirls around me. They all had crushes on Yuki because she's such a cool classmate, Yuki/Gothgirl confirmed. </br>  <br>She was depressed that she had too many friends and couldn't spend time with all of them!</br>  <br>Is this the one?</br>  <br>Ah of course that's it. Everyone was pinning after her because of her great hat!</br>  <br>I wonder how it feels to be a moe girl with cute accessories, yet the world around you are a bunch of normies who bully you.</br>  <br> Too many friends <br> Depressed because you can't hang out with them all <br> All your friends die <br> Happy because you no longer have to worry about hanging out with your friends <br><br>It's weird how much sense this makes, in a sociopathic kind of way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither Kurumi or Rii knew Yuki before the outbreak. Not saying she wasn't depressed before, but I think that part was talking specifically about after the outbreak and before the formation of the club.</br>  <br>Holy shit do none of these girls know how to eat a candy apple or something?<br><br> that fan <br>how subtle</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Megu-nee talking.</br>  <br>She looked mighty depressed in the flashback, and Megu-nee new her before. She could have told Kurumi and Yurii that Yuki was depressed before.</br>  <br> Holy shit do none of these girls know how to eat a candy apple or something? <br><br>Can't say I'm complaining.</br></br></br>  <br> I think that part was talking specifically about after the outbreak and before the formation of the club. <br>No it clearly wasn't, look at the sentence structure.<br><br> Yuki who had ALWAYS been very depressed </br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever eaten a candy apple before? The hot sauce gets everywhere that's why they put the damn thing on a stick.</br>  <br> her smile and optimism: found </br>  <br>It's not though.</br>  <br> hot sauce <br>What the hell kind of candy apples are you eating?<br><br><br>Always, sense they new her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing I don't get is that Yuki was ALWAYS depressed, or only after the outbreak.</br>  <br>My bad, you're right. Megu-nee only said she behaved too much like a little kid.</br>  Would you bring about the zombie apocalypse to see her smile?  <br> Mosaic.wav </br>  <br>The anime just canonically showed she was depressed before, even though I believed she wasn't. That scene was added by the author to clarify the point, most likely.</br>  I still maintain that the Uni girls are going to betray the Gakkous or were just using them all along. Those guys in the helmets run away way too fast after seeing them get into the Uni.  <br>I'd rather see someone depressed than see them broken.</br>  <br> No it clearly wasn't, look at the sentence structure. <br>Ambiguous even in the original Japanese.</br></br>  <br>Well it's a good thing the anime cleared all the ambiguity of it away then!</br>  <br>Thing is, she says she was always depressed, yet Rii-san only got to know her on the day of the outbreak.</br>  <br>I want to bring her happiness.</br>  <br>I'm sure Megu-nee would've talked about it to them at some point.</br>  <br>She only met Kurumi on Z day, but she might have known Rii before. Megu-nee's diary did say people liked to hang out on the roof and Rii was in the gardening club.</br>  <br> http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26<wbr>809520</wbr> <br>This ain't a guitar solo, you faglord, but yeah, the bridge section is showing again that Japan can't compose for shit recently.</br></br>  <br>She could have heard from Megu-nee, but I agree that I used to think Yuki was only depressed starting after the outbreak.

I told them there would be a twist and would be stopping it at parts where there were hints of what the twist was. For those 20 or so minutes, it was fucking hilarious. I kept fucking with their heads about what the twist might be as they guessed every plot twist under the rainbow. They even went and said "there isn't any twist, your full of shit" to "they are all actually dogs.

Seriously though, who's going to die next?</br>    <br>Miki obviously she's the only boy anywhere near Yuki<br><br>Unless it was actually from Yuki's dad and the reason why she was so depressed at school and so childish is because she was trying to escape from the daily rapings from her father.</br></br></br>  <br>They'd have to be alive, with men around for that.<br><br>Oh, and be straight.</br></br></br>  <br>The only boy in the group.</br>  Please do not call Miki a boy.    <br>Gurashis are straight, occasionally bi at most.</br>    <br>I wanted a Gurashi spin-off with the girls having cute club activities at a non-zombie school.<br><br>It'll never happen.</br></br></br>  <br>You know girls who are on cutesy childish behavior and voices in reality?

The hard part was realizing there was an emergency shelter with stockpiles in the first place.</br></br>  <br>Because she is louder than the others? Zombies don't snore to begin with. They don't even sleep or else humanity would have a lot of freedom during their bedtime.</br>  <br>You are wrong</br>  <br>We'll see about that, c88 is just around the corner.</br>  <br>She's the one who found the supplies and turned on the generator  because she could sneak past the zombies .

I actually think Hibiki will recover next chapter, and after that she will have to face her biggest issue, probably about her late past.<br><br>This comatose status won't last too much,  I hope so. </br></br>  <br>Worst OP post I've seen so far this season.<br><br><br>FUCK YEAH.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll marry them both, polygamy haters get out.</br></br>  <br>No FLAC again?</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Anyone who claims Hbiki as a waifu but denies her her sunshine should be publicly executed.</br>  <br> You will never sleep in the middle of a sunshine sandwich <br>Why even live</br></br>  <br><br> Worst OP post I've seen so far this season. <br><br>Do you missed the crackshipping one with Miku and Chris?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell them "symphogeah"</br>  <br>Anon you will marry no one, Hibiki will fist you fully so you would come faster and Miku could extract your sperm into the cup, nothing else for you than a knowledge you will have a kid but won't be allowed to be a father to him/her.</br>  So how long until Gary eats Carol and becomes the real villain?  <br>Go back to your cage, we're not even close to bump limit yet.</br>  <br> implying crackshipping yourself with any of the girls isn't worse </br>  So are we going to get symphogear Miku next episode?  Just the best.  <br>I thought Mikugear won't come back again. Isn't she supposed to kick ass some other way?</br>  <br> why even live <br><br>Because you need to hold out for the movie in 2016.</br></br></br>    <br><br>What's that I read about a movie now and then?<br>Is this just a troll or are there actual rumors?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mikugeah isn't supposed to appear again, staff said so, but for some reason I can't buy that.

I don't understand why people want it back </br>  <br><br>Fine isn't supposed to appear again as well. Or Kanade.<br>But I don't think we can trust the stuff on anything they say.</br></br></br>  <br>I pulled that out of my ass, but there has been a desire to do a movie so it's not entirely unfounded. Believe in justice.</br>  So do we know what Gary's actual plan is yet?<br><br>No chance in hell is she going to be happy just licking Carol's feet clean every night</br></br>  <br>I agree. Miku is the sunshine that waits for Biki.</br>  <br>Why do people get so fixated on Mikugeah? It was nice, but it was better because it was only temporary.</br>  Anyone else really liking these?<br><br>A lot of the time they're my favorite part of the episode after the songs</br></br>  <br><br>Please no movie, better make another TV season.</br></br>  <br>They better not. While the design and song was nice, it was the most hamfisted dues ex machina for the series.</br>  <br> Mikuhat <br><br>Every fucking time.</br></br></br>    <br>We need a full webseries for Zesshoushinai. And more SoL material in general.</br>  <br>What are you talking about exactly? Those are from last season.</br>  <br>Maybe she will learn alchemy from Carol or Fine (if she somehow returns), but that will be probably more relevant in movie than this season.<br><br><br>It's just Giaru givinig you hope, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What if Miku becomes a gear?</br></br></br>  <br>Even worse.</br>  So is Hibiki going to get another scar?

I like it.</br>  Remember when this was Chris?  <br>It isn't a coma - it's shock to her system. It'll probably be a temporary paralysis, unless they decide to play the psychological angle, which would totally destroy her character.<br><br>If anything, they might pull out the drama as"I wanna fight!" "No, your body is still recovering" for a couple episodes, until they level up Gungnir.</br></br></br>  <br> Miku goes full yandere <br> makes herself into a gear so that by being worn by Hibiki she'll always be as close as possible to her <br> her weapon of choice are intense beams of energy and light because she's her sunshine <br> Gungnir is not needed anymore and passes to Maria <br> Mikugear stays on Hibiki forever, she can't get take it off ever again <br> Hibiki becomes an empty shell, living and fighting with soulless eyes while Mikugear clings to her body on its own will <br> finally she breaks and they together become the final boss in season 5 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I see your true colors. <br>Does that mean she can tell if someone is a lesbian?<br><br> like a rainbow <br>I think you're right.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Double tap</br>  <br>Didn't Carol make all the Autoscorah's?<br>While she seems like the kinda character to stab her boss in the back i can't see the dolls being made without some innate loyalty to their maker.

It's great.  <br> Maria is beautiful in every outfit. <br>Fixed</br></br>  <br> massive magical girl crossover <br> lists only "yuri" series </br></br>  <br>You got a problem with that fuccboi?</br>    <br> no Nephilim <br> no Grape-kun <br> no standard noise <br>Also Anime-chan should be a space cop.<br><br>Sakura and alike wouldn't fit a fighting game, precures are out of the question thank to Toei,</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fuccboi <br>Don't, please.</br></br>  <br>How about  2hus </br>  <br>Sooo,  Carol. </br>  <br>That'd be Ver with the cane. He's a puppet character with a fucking army instead of a puppet</br>  <br>I'd play with Ver just so I could spam grape-kun.</br>  <br>Anime-chan is the joke character anyway, and that'd totally be her alternative skin.<br><br>And Ver (Solomon's Cane) would be using the standard noise anyway.<br><br>Also, how do you guys predict the tiers would look?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is it about Maria and Kanade that makes them so perfect?</br>  Sometimes I forgot Phara and Leiur existed simply because Garie and Micha are there<br><br>Why are they so best?<br><br>Also after rewatching EP1 for a few hundred times I just noticed that Hibiki has anchored herself on the shuttle 100% of the times, as well as Tsubasa extending her leg wings out instead of folding it because the downforce would made it possible for her to stand on the speeding shuttle. Chris on the other hand has nothing to hold her in place and had to use Bikki as stepping stone to stabilise the missiles and held in place by Tsubasa. Dem details.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gungnir with mature bodies and being the onee-chan.</br>  <br>Larry and Pharrel haven't done anything since ep.2 anyway, it's mostly Gary and now Micky as well.</br>  <br>They should be back soon since their designated rivals are about to get nebulously-evil upgrades.</br>  <br> TRUE COLORS <br>this one was surprisingly good</br></br>  <br><br>It would still make more sense to have other noise for story mode and to humiliate your friends by killing them with Iron-kun, like saibamen or  Yamcha  in DBZ games.</br></br>  <br>What does that read? LiNKER club?</br>  <br> &gt;Not beating them with Ginyu </br>  <br>You wouldn't clip a bird's wings, would you?</br>  <br>Homolust Miku is best Miku.</br>  <br>Something like that.</br>  <br>Personally I think it should be<br>Start<br> hibiki (g) <br> tsubasa (heavenrend) <br> chris (ichii-bal) <br><br>then easy unlocks<br> maria (g) <br> kirika(i) <br> shirabe(s) <br><br>then just move chris's nehushtaan to secret characters and put fine in unlockables.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LiNKER team would be a better translation.</br>  If there was a Symphogear game and it had a mechanic where when you're just dominating your character starts singing. Which song would you choose.<br> Who G-Beat here</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128723555 <br> unrequited </br>  <br>Gyakkou no Fleugel for mah Kanade/Tsubasa team up.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128723555 <br> not bland-as-fuck self-insert MCs <br>That's objectively wrong. It's up there, though.</br></br>  Listening to Eiyuu Koji right now. We need another training montage with Genjuuro singing.  <br>Ame no Habakiri without a doubt.<br><br>If you could select Edge Works for a match of Shirabe vs Kirika it would be great.</br></br></br>  <br>HIBIKE HIBIKE<br>in fact, all I would want is for the "this fist... my life... they are Symphogear!" line to be one of her win quotes.</br></br>  <br>Meanwhile if you're facing Miku as Hibiki the song becomes Rainbow Flower</br>  <br><br><br><br>So basically the victory/taunt customization system from Jojo's All Star Battle mixed with a dynamic music system, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria with Ressou Gungnir would be pretty sweet.<br><br>So how would character match-ups with duets work? Would it play the duet throughout the entire fight?</br></br></br>  <br>Guilty Gear Xrd did something like that  for one character. <br> The BGM changes when you're losing, I think. <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=h71<wbr>Qh2pDORU</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br>  <br>Maria while singing Dark Oblivion, with the funny english an all.</br>  <br> symphogear sing along <br> if you sing dark oblivion in correct english you fail </br></br>  <br>歪鏡・シェンショウジン</br>  <br>Is there any non-multi Gear song that is more triumphant than Ressou Gungnir?</br>  What is her favorite anime, other than Gundam?  <br>G-Beat</br>  <br><br>Electro Inspector Bang, of course.

I seriously can't wait for Shirabe's new chara song</br>  What's going on here?  <br>Force-feeding. It's fucking inhumane.</br>  <br>I think she said something along the lines of "It's my first time wearing something this pink".</br>  <br> Or did you think a lesbian couple would seriously want you to fuck them. <br>You would be surprised.</br></br>  <br><br>Hibiki songs = Kanade songs = Chris songs = Tsubasa Songs = Dess songs = Jii songs &gt; Maria songs<br><br> FORRIN TO PEEZIS ZA SHADDAH DREAM WARL NASHIMZASHADDAHSNAHW </br></br></br></br>  <br>She only seems slightly inconvenienced though.</br>  <br> not liking the engrish <br>Thats just not fine son.</br></br>  <br>Beserbikki would be a secret character, ala Evil Ryu or something</br>  <br>KORT EL FES GUNGNIR more than makes up for that though.</br>  <br> Holy fuck that dude was such a fucking idiot he probably deserved to be NTr'd, shit son. </br>  <br>  Shirabe transforms into her mecha <br>  Kanade does her Superb Song nuke <br>  Maria in Gungnir has Horizon Spear Beam <br>  Ogawa would shadow weave an enemy into place, then run them over with the jeep from the end of G <br>  Serena sings her Superb Song, causing the arena to crumble onto her opponent </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Son, I get off by that, don't you try to put me down</br>  <br> &gt;Ver (Solomon's Cane) <br> fight by summoning noise all over the place while running around shouting "LASTO ACTION HEROOO" <br>Fund it.</br></br></br>  <br>Whose hand is that?</br>   frilly white panties   <br>I always imagined her more as a sports bra/panties person.</br>  How can she be so evil yet so cute?  <br><br>I assume it's part of the cheerleader outfit<br><br>Either that or she borrowed Miku's</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? Aside the fighting thing, Hibiki is pretty feminine.</br>    Does anyone have the webm from s1e1 with Hibiki's first henshin? How the hydraulics were flying from her body and shit.    <br>I loved her henshin sequence but it also made me kind of sad that she has already filled most of her fanservice quota for the season so soon.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck.<br>I don't even remember this shit.</br></br>  <br><br>You literally have brain damage</br></br>  <br>Maybe you ought to re-watch S1.</br>  <br>Human<br>Relic <br>Fusion</br></br></br>  <br>I think Kanade should be moved from secret to unlockable because she's too obvious a character to be secret.

I mean, even if the Gungnir fragments in her chest were destroyed her body can't have been completely rid of the changes Gungnir brought upon it or else Hibiki herself would have been destroyed by the lesbian laser of purification.</br>  <br>It might not work well on anyone but her.</br>  <br>her arm was entirely regenerated by Gungnir so it should have been erased too</br>  <br>Well considering the implications of project ignite its implied she can fix them regardless, ignite is just the upgrade not the repairs.<br>so she might give them a tune up, but focus all the upgrades on hibiki.</br></br>  <br>what if it works well on everyone but her, and she has to awaken Gungnir on her own to fight?<br> Then when everyone goes berserk from using Dainsleaf she can stop them </br></br>    <br> jii ahead of dess <br>I don't believe it.</br></br>  <br>Shit, I realized I haven't watched the lesbian laser episode yet.

Did you skip an episode or something?</br>  Finally, no more bullying.  <br><br>What are you even doing in this thread if you haven't seen G? Did you mean "rewatch"?</br></br>    <br>The gay beam removed the fragments giving her cancer but I'm pretty sure her body is forever changed by the way FIne talked about it. Her left arm is made of Gungnir after all.</br>  <br><br>I saw G except just that one episode. Dunno how that happened.</br></br>  <br>Anything if it means she can lose the necklace again.</br>  <br><br>Don't worry, they'll suffer together plenty when the Ignite upgrades start to kill them.<br><br>Maybe Tsubasa will get a kiss before Chris turns to ash</br></br></br></br>  They should have just let Fine destroy the moon  <br> somehow skipped the rainbow flower episode  <br> I watched G guys I swear! </br></br>  <br>I never understood the issue<br> fine destroys moon <br> everyone can understand each other again <br> OH SHIT GOTTA STOP HER FROM MAKING PEOPLE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Destroying the moon would destroy the planet, stupid</br></br>  GARY  <br>realistically speaking breaking a quarter of the moon would have caused all sorts of issues as well.<br>universally speaking it probably would have been fine.</br></br>  <br>Have you ever heard of something called the ocean?</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br>These dolls are getting much too lewd.</br>  <br>I didn't watch it week after week together with /a/.
