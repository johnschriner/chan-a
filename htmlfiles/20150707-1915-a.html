[  3 days after aired <br> still no fucking sub  <br>Why is this happening?</br></br>  <br>That would be dangerous. She might become a black hole or something.<br>Also there are probably limits to their powers.</br></br>  So if Calculator Guy can calculate everything, why doesn't he use his ability to sabotage his siblings and become the ruler?<br><br>Having a manipulative dickhead with a seemingly shit power rise up would be a much better anime than "oh no people saw my magical pantsu"</br></br>  <br>Maybe because he's not a piece of shit?<br>He only knows probabilities, that's not enough to get him to where he needs to be. In order to win you need to do things dumbass. Akane is best MC.</br></br>  <br>I think he can only calculate what's happening right now and shit, not stuff like the chances of the heat death of the universe happening exactly in 4 million years, 3 months, 2 days. 5 hours and 23 minutes.</br>  <br>Because it turns from twincest to twincest harem.</br>  W.E.G.      <br>A lot of them go over the boarder, and it's nicer to just have a clean template. Not really mandatory, just a personal preference.</br>  Exactly what I thought I would get. Wasn't actually that bad for a /u/ show.  <br>The pinnacle of modern animation.</br>  Anon, can you just be human?  <br>While forward unto dawn was bad, I felt it was worth watching once they got to the covenant showing up. I watched it like a Godzilla movie. You know the human element will be terrible and overall the movie will be bad, but it's still ends up being a good movie for what it is.</br>  <br>Enjoy. I really wish they cut the credits out because each one appears much longer than it is because the credits take up like 5 minutes alone.</br>  <br>I played the shit out of Halo Wars with some friends. 10/10 would purchase a sequel.</br>  The short about the Spartan finding her clone was referenced in Hunt the Truth.<br><br>So it's canon.</br></br>  <br>I remember they said all of Legends will be canon. Yet it was bullshit. Prototype was also referenced somewhere.</br>  Why are Japs so suicidal?<br><br> gate to an entirely different world shows up <br> new humanoid species run out of it <br> send in HUMAN scouts <br> don't hear back from scouts <br> send in a HUMAN army <br><br>Why the fuck would you risk lives when you can have drones/rovers do the scouting and confirm that humans can even fucking breathe on the other side.<br><br> inb4 digital messages can't be sent across the gate <br>It's trivial to program a robot to drive/fly 1 mile forward, take air/rock samples and footage, then turn around and fly back.<br><br>Fuck japan just let America handle it before you kill yourselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> send in HUMAN scouts <br> don't hear back from scouts <br>But they do.</br></br></br>  <br>People were begging to be sent overseas after 9/11. People like getting revenge with their own hands.</br>  <br>Drones are shit anyway. I have to repair these fuckers every single day, the fact stupid fucking civilians are afraid of these shows what a huge gap in knowledge they have from everything outside of their safety net. <br>A strong wind will knock this over and destroy them utterly, you can't fly them in any kind of weather, they have extremely low fuel, they're fire-and-forget at anything regarding direct combat, they're a piece of shit to control, and the people in charge of them are all old fat babyboomer fucks who have no idea how they work, just like the old fat babyboomer leech fucks who are afraid of "the drones taken over the gubment and our land no privacy when the amazon drones come and sneak into our houses and shoot us!" <br>You could break a drone with an airsoft gun. They're a kite with a propeller.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, you're trying to explore an entire planet and instead of focusing on air power that could provide the fastest intel on a fantasy world, you slow yourself down with ground troops that barely explore the nearby town.<br><br>A nation would want info on all continents as soon as possible in a fantasy world.<br><br>You aren't going to accomplish that by focusing on such a small amount of ground troops.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious as to how you think drones work without satellite signals to control.</br>  Has there EVER been a proper live action adaption of an anime?  <br> Taimanin Asagi </br>  Speed Racer was pretty good  <br>The medium is shit for storytelling, though.<br><br>Translating a story to video game form doesn't really work unless it is designed for a video game. It is a bit like trying to cut the laugh track out of a show which is built around a laugh track.</br></br></br>    <br>This is porn, isn't it?</br>  Iconic anime scenes  <br>Of course anything from Punchline isn't iconic. It's part of the seasonal shit everyone forgets once the new season comes. I don't even know how anon could think it was iconic or even just rememberable.</br>  <br>Damn that was pretty fucking amazing, I want to reread it now.</br>      <br>I think we could use the change of pace considering every other scene in the series is going for scary or funny.</br>  HOLY FUCK MY DICK.  <br><br>Thanks anon. Will try not to fuck up anything.</br></br>  <br>Note that recent madVR has SuperRes, which is better than NNEDI3 (IMO) and uses much less GPU resources.</br>  <br>I'm using it, but it's a setting for further refinement, not the upscale itself. I noticed better results using these SuperRes configs together with NNEDI3 upscaling than without.</br>  <br>Just make sure to throughly uninstall all your codecs and reboot your PC before switching over and installing KCP.</br>  <br>But if you don't have monster SLI setup (I have no idea how much headroom you have at 1080p, I just have a 2560x1440 monitor which makes those upscalers pretty expensive.), then Jinc+SR is much better than just NN3.</br>  So /a/, what was the reaction when this originally aired?  Season 2 made hate Rikka and whatshisface.<br><br>You have to do a pretty shitty job to make the audience hate your fucking main couple. Pink was better. Nibutani deserved more screentime. Dekomori was WAY too retarded this season. Imouto needed way, way more screentime.<br><br>They fucked up big.</br></br></br></br>  It helped me find my waifu<br><br>There was a lot of woop woop hype, then afterwards most people said they liked it and were excited for season 2. Then when season 2 came there was excitement for about 4 weeks, then people started doubting the way the story went. After about episode 8 only the most devoted anons  like me  kept faith all the way till the end.<br><br>From what I know about the LN  which last I checked isn't translated,  Shichimiya was supposed to hold Rikka hostage in exchange for something to do with the dark flame dragon and Yuuta loving her instead, and chuuni fight ensued. Based on that, and the fact that kyoani took a lot of liberties with the story such as with adding deko, kumin, and shinka, I came up with an alternation to the story that a lot of anons said they liked, based around:<br><br>-Rikka starts off similar to the end of the first season, still having slight chuunibyou but not as bad as at the start<br><br>-The reason she gets back into full chuuni mode is because shichimiya shows up and she learns about the dark flame dragon and something something <br><br>-Yuuta and Rikka kiss on the lips while on the school trip instead of on the cheek<br><br>-the cat doesn't have fucking babies at the end</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  A billion threads<br>Lots of bitching about Shinka<br>General waifushit<br>Debate over the dramatic second half</br></br></br>  <br>Season 1 was really big on /a/. Hell it even got a sticky on /b/.</br>  <br>WOOP WOOP<br><br>Now that there's already a bunch of specials, a movie and a second season, I guess that's all there is for the animated parts of this franchise?</br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related, contains all the basic info and much more:<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>BIJ, amiami.</br>  <br>Could I request a link for that specific daki?</br>  <br>From recent memory the Pochaco noodle stopper was up on BiJ and I believe that amiami sometimes has the ones that FuRyu makes. I don't believe very many people here actually buy them so getting information might be tough.</br>  <br><br>Where have you been?</br></br>  Cute.   An adaptation of some tabletop roleplaying sessions that some famous dudes had <br>Well, that sounds interes-<br><br> Urobuchi, Nasu and two faggots I don't know <br>Oh.

Is it good insane or bad insane?   8 minutes long. <br>Fuck this gay earth, another one of these.</br>  <br>Pretty much just adapt the ecchi scenes at this rate. Also, really not sure on whether people care about the story.</br>  <br>the manga is basically amazing<br><br><br>they should, its cute.

At the very least, he'd be one part Senjou snark, one part Araragi helping. <br><br><br>Yes, it does. <br><br>Why would you willingly want to watch Monogatari go to shit so NisiO can get paid?<br><br>Don't drag on something after it's run it's course.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shaft can still lewd <br>And yet it's not lewd enough for me to fap to it. fuck that shit.</br></br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  SOON  <br>With a low attack like that, Wild Vulture probably has a special summon from the hand effect like other RR.
