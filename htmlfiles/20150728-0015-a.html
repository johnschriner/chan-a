Everyone else is inferior.</br></br></br>  <br>you have very shity opinion, you should consider chancing it</br>  <br>Who would have the hottest sex?<br><br>Yoko and Aya, Kusshi and Karen or Karen and Honoka?</br></br></br>  is there anything to do in bongistan? ie. getting to the cottage used as a model? i'm well aware of this: http://www.thepoke.co.uk/2015/07/08<wbr>/new-official-uk-tourism-map-bit-de<wbr>pressing/</wbr></wbr>  <br>just breeding the best animu girls<br><br> apart from alice </br></br></br>  <br>European anime girls are the best while american ones are sluts and a shit</br>  <br>Your opinion is shitty. Kusshi has best body, best personality, best hair.<br><br>Yoko and Aya. Aya is secretly very wild.</br></br></br>  <br>you don't get to have an opinion pleb Yoko is best girl</br>  <br>Some of us let our funny bone choose our best girls instead of our dick.</br>    <br>Nope. Kusshi superior and is part of superior couple.<br><br>Let me know when Yoko stops being a dumb with Ayaya.</br></br></br>  <br>I would kill for an Aya figure.</br>  <br>kusshi is not the worst in the show only not the best in my opinion and if aya would be straight forward about her crush on yoko everything would be solved pretty fast.</br>  <br>Sorry, only Alice.</br>  Karen when  <br>I still await Ayaya and Yoko. THE WAIT IS PAINFUL.</br>  <br>there are Karen figures on the German amazon</br>  <br>I don't want it that much, but if it comes out, I'll take it.<br><br>Karen already has a  shitty  1/8 figure.</br></br></br>    <br>When does the Nendo come out?</br>  <br><br>I want it.<br><br>Here's hoping for a Shino and Karen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But these figures typically exist to feed off of animu love, right? So do we have to hope a S3 even more?</br>  <br>Well the second season just ended. We could be seeing figures coming out soon. Nothing at wonfes though.</br>  <br> That girl doesn't look like Aya.... </br>  <br>But Aya is looking at her.</br>  <br>Good one, anon.<br><br> Now make them kiss. </br></br></br>  Next chapter when?  <br>We're working on it. Should be tonight or tomorrow hopefully. Next chapter was put into the second season though so it's nothing that new.</br>  <br>I don't mind. thanks.</br>  <br>I think they'd have announced it during the season though.<br><br>I hope I'm wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>honest Ayaya makes my heart hurt.</br>   friend   <br>It's a step. Honoka wasn't even part of the cast in the first season.</br>  Off topic, but I hope Yamada steals Working s3 as much as Karen stole Kiniro Mosaic s2  <br>Honoka was there but she was almost non-existent.<br><br>That said:  This is fucking date bait isn't it? </br></br></br>  <br>That's a date, plain and simple.</br>  <br>On the third shopping trip they'll finally kiss.<br><br>YAS.</br></br></br>  Best girl.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=APl<wbr>l8yIuJIY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tSK<wbr>luz7c2qA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Assuming it's not original, if anyone knows the BGM for the 2nd video, I would appreciate it. </br></br></br></br>  REMOVE KAREN   Asenshi-Mezashite releases Ep 8 of S2 now <br><br>...where the hell have you been?</br></br>  Shh Karen's sleeping.  <br>WAKE UP</br>  I want to  date  her.      <br>What is she dreaming about?</br>  <br>Going to teatime with Honoka.</br>  <br>What it would be like to be a boat.</br>  <br>Where's an Alice to hug? Or Kusshi to fluster?</br>  I bet she likes it on her stomach in the prone position, whatever that's called.  <br>My dick.<br><br><br>Don't say mean things about Aya, I will fuck you up fam</br></br></br></br>  <br>Delete this, lewdposter.</br>  <br>No lewding Kinmozas.<br><br>By the way, is it true the Kinmozas have flower motifs?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, the original character songs from 2013 were about it:<br>Shino is the Poinsettia<br>Alice is the Camellia japonica<br>Aya is the Cosmos<br>Youko is the Hydrangea<br>And Karen is the Anemone</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> has anyone else caught themselves doing this pose at random times? Asking for a friend </br>    MAMA AYAYA WHEN  <br>Why is Karen such a semen demon even when she looks like Shitno</br>  <br>The eyes.</br>    Friendly reminder that for Karen's dad, plowing this on a nightly basis and having Karen call him 'Papa' are just normal parts of his every day life.<br><br>He may have only 10-15 seconds of screentime total, but I salute you good sir.</br></br>  <br>Let me surprise you.<br><br> Karen's mom is actually more like Karen than you think. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Denying Aya the pleasures of love. Big Brother, please.</br></br>  <br><br>Man, Ayayaya got so sexual in season two</br></br>  <br>You're giving Aya the wrong kind of love. The only love she needs is something from Yoko.</br>  <br>Never forget Ayaya stripped Yoko.</br>  Sex with all of them would be really nice and soft.  <br>They will only have with each other anyway.</br>  <br><br>Yep, this is what I meant. </br></br>    <br><br>That level of softness might break the universe.</br></br>  <br>Like November I think</br>  <br>Most puffy AND softest.</br>   Ayaya <br>Maybe we should stop this. Think about Ayayas.</br>  <br> moon runes <br>I can't read shit<br>but it looks adorable</br></br></br>    <br>They are both talking about how they are gonna get turnt the fuck up.</br>  Don't know why I didn't think of this before. Isn't it likely that she needs glasses?  <br>He's the pinnacle of male evolution. On par with that glorious Aryan from Hidamari Sketch.</br>  <br>And not to mention the pussy slaying Selleck stache!</br>  Is Kuzehashi the kind to have sex on the first date?   THE   <br>ハロー</br>  <br>Doesn't even need to go on a date.</br>  <br>She'd be a maneater.</br>  <br>So basically we need Kusshi to go on a date with Karasu.<br><br>IT'S DOUJIN WRITING TIME MOTHERFUCKERS</br></br></br>  I want to impregnate them all and after they give birth impregnate them again.  <br>They aren't baby factories, and they don't thirst for you anyway. Out.</br>  <br>You don't know that, I'm a nice person.</br>  <br>PSA for people like anons like him.</br>  <br>I'm really cool and nice.</br>  <br>Good for you anon.</br>  <br>My kindness and coolness will lead me to their vaginal holes.</br>  <br>The vaginas are already taken.<br><br>By other vaginas. Dicks don't get their way unless you're a random background character.</br></br></br>  <br>Fear not, I'll become part of the main cast in no time and with that a father to all.</br>  <br>Ahem. Yes, hi, Yui Hara? A straightfag is trying to corrupt this yuri universe. Can you... correct him?</br>  <br>Corrupt? I think you mean cleanse, you're welcome by the way.</br>  <br> getting in the way as something as precious as this <br>FIGHT ME.</br></br>  <br>Give me your address, loser.</br>  <br>It's 1215 Kickass Ave. Let's go! Hand to hand. It's the basis of all combat.</br>  <br>I actually won't show up, I'll just continue on my quest to cleanse and sow my seed.</br>  <br>Go to the GJ-Bu universe instead. Everyone is ready to hop on.</br>  <br>I don't like fat girls or Canadians. I'll stick to those miniature brits and Japanese youth.</br>  <br> Japanese youth <br>There are like countless examples of that you fool.</br></br>  <br> Saki-Haram </br>  <br>Yeah, but I know what I want.</br>  <br>You're not getting it. Because this doll protects everyone from your cum machine.</br>  <br>My cum will pierce that trinket right though it's heart. True love beats all the odds.</br>  What if they were all boys? Would the show be as entertaining?  <br> your true love <br> Alice x Shino <br> Ayaya x Yoko <br> Karen x Honkers <br> Kusshi x Karasu <br>You really only have Mitsuki left. Enjoy the imouto.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess who would approve.</br>  <br>That shit ain't love, that's a crush at best, and I'll crush that crush with my love.</br>    <br>Not me, just your niece. Yeah your niece is a filthy fujoshi.</br>  <br>Maybe if it also was about a japanese git and his hlf-jap buddy coming to live in Blighty.</br>  Anyone remember when Kinmoza was supposed to have a literal magic/alien character rather than Alice now?<br><br>I'm not bullshitting this.</br></br>  <br>It's called Karen</br>  <br>On second thought, it's not really so clear.</br>  <br>Karen is an alien and clearly magical and some points.</br>  <br>Said magical individual/alien was supposed to be Alice.<br><br>But whatever. Karen is a force of nature.</br></br></br>  <br>She can fuck losers up and look good doing it.</br>    <br>Unless she's in this outfit here: </br>  <br>Not what I'm talking about.<br><br> This still doesn't beat musical number of S1. </br></br></br>  <br>Yuuki Yuuna S2 when?</br>  <br>Even she can pull it off, that's how super seckshe she is.</br>  <br>I preferred her sushi + glasses outfit.</br>  <br>*shirt<br>Shit I forgot that crucial part.</br></br>  <br>I'd actually like to see her just sushi and glasses outfit.</br>  <br>Too lazy to cut up raws, I should clean up my desktop first.</br>  Is this worth picking up?  Kana should have had more screen time.  <br>If you like cute girls doing cute things? Sure.</br>  <br> worth <br><br>don't act like your time is so valuable you can't watch a few episodes to form an opinion</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it hilarious how Kana's VA voiced Nanami in Sakurasou and Karen's VA was the minor friend chracter?</br>  <br>I recently watched it and ended up marathoning both seasons.<br>It's great, very funny and cute.</br></br>    <br>Oh, I though she was naked covered in sushi wearing glasses, disappointed.</br>  <br>Dude we got a bathhouse scene already, chill.</br>  <br>Honoka: I'll find some clothes that match Karen!!<br><br>Honoka: Is it too much...? Something's off. What's missing?<br><br>Honoka: We have to bring out something more foreigner-like.<br><br>Karen: I don't think that's the problem.<br><br>Karen: These are clothes that Youko would choose!<br><br>Because I was bored.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kana  So when's S3?  <br>Good joke</br>  <br>TLer kun you came back? How's the typesetting?</br>  <br>We have half of the pages typeset. I think there is some redrawing to be done which is taking some time.</br>  <br>I wasn't joking</br>  <br>Jokes can hurt people as well you know. Maybe be a little more considerate next time.</br>    <br>If BD sales do well, hopefully 2 years. If not, goodbye to moe comfort.</br>  <br>Redrawing? Some tricky text?</br>  <br>I think so? I'm not the one typesetting. I can only translate. There is a lot of text outside of the bubbles.</br>  <br>Shit. THERE WAS A WATERMARK.</br>  <br>I KNOW! I thought we were leaving it though... you didn't need to stress yourself out.</br>  <br>That stuff looks ugly and would have been called out upon. It's good that our typesetter is going to destroy it.</br>  I wish to have a daughter like Karen  <br> stupid <br> will become a slut <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah. She'll be grating on your nerves.</br>  <br>If you think Karen is stupid, you're so very wrong. She's probably the smartest of the bunch. Just look how effectively she can troll even the adults around her.</br>  <br><br>Who's the next smartest one after Aya?</br></br>  I WANNA RENEGADE DOWN  <br>OMOIDE WA<br>OMOIDE WA<br>OKKUSEMAN</br></br></br>  IT'S UNLIMITED<br>IT'S UNLIMITED</br>  TUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUURN<br>TURN A TURN<br>TURN A TURN<br>TURN A</br></br></br></wbr>  <br>ANIME JA NAI<br> ANIME JA NAI </br></br>  SOX SOX SOX SOX SOX SOX SOX SOCKS  AND I AM A MATERIAL GIRL  BEEF SUTOROGANOFFU  <br>moeagare<br>MOEAGARE<br>MOEAGARE<br><br><br> GUNDAMU </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Really Anons?<br>JIIIIBUN WOOOOO</br>  KONOOOO UTA GA KIKOETERU<br>INOCHI ARU SUBETE NO MONO YO</br>  *inconprehensable blabbering* BOKU GA NAI<br>BOKU GA NAI<br>BOKU GA NA-I</br></br>  WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU  YUUKI<br>GIMME GIMME POWER</br>   Naruto <br> Chakra is a natural part of setting, goes along well with ninjas and shit. Used to bring variety and tactics to combat <br> Bleach  <br> Spiritual pressure, again, makes sense in a manga about fighting spirits. Also used to bring variety to battles that are otherwise just people swinging swords <br><br> One Piece  <br> Haki is just some random shit that has absolutely no place in a manga about pirates and sailing. Becomes relevant very late when author writes himself in a corner with power levels and used to turn every fight into dick-measuring power contest. <br>Tell me I'm wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>arguably "sage mode" is the retarded mid-point asspull in Naruto.</br>  <br> Becomes relevant very late <br>Putting aside Shanks, Haki was brought up as early as Skypeia, so the idea was always there just not expanded upon until later.</br></br>  I don't have any problems with the AoE Haki, but the others feel unnecessary.  <br>asspull, just like the awakening of the devils fruits</br>  You compared the non-asspull version of the "powers" from Bleach and Naruto with the asspull version of One Piece's powers.<br><br>The dynamics of the devil fruits were just as interesting as Chakra and Reiatsu were in Naruto and Bleach. Both Chakra skills and Reiatsu usages (and Zanpakutos/other powers too) went to shit eventually, Haki is relatively still used decently.</br></br>  <br>There's a difference between an asspull and expanding something that's already there. Haki was always there but only "offically" introduced later, it has absolutely nothing to do with asspull. Awakening is a new thing that kinda came out of nowhere (at least for an ignorant idiot like me) but it's still far from being an asspull, it would have been one if Luffy randomly gets it to make another comeback in a fight.</br>  Problem is Naruto's combat system and chakra started out interesting but then it just devolved into stupid power levels and people doing ridiculous bullshit because of the gradual escalation of the series and it ends up making earlier fights between powerful characters look like jokes.<br><br>Haki is perfectly relevant in One Piece since it's so focused on willpower, dreams and ambition anyway. And it even makes sense that it's introduced so late too because the characters start off from the very bottom in the weakest Sea and go on a journey which gradually exposes and brings them closer to the really strong elements in the setting.</br></br>  <br>One Piece powers never made sense, but hey, it's OK when Oda does it</br>   giganigga mode is just a visual representation of willpower which has been asspully since the beginning of One Piece <br> mantra/observation is just a name for when people have really sharp senses <br> conqueror mind blast only works against weak mooks who would've lost anyway <br><br>It's really not that bad. There eventually had to be a way for people to hit logias.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;mfw jojo hamon and stands are netter then all this other shounen shit <br><br>:^)</br></br></br>  <br>One Piece is barely about sailing and pirates anyway.</br>  <br> weekly shounen manga over 200 chapters long <br> not already in asspull territory <br>The cow must produce.</br></br></br>  <br>haki is a problem for having no place in a pirate story<br>but DF are okay?</br></br>  <br>Devil Fruits are just fruits.<br>Its a manga about beaches and sunny weather, so yeah, having powers come from fruits fits the story.</br></br>  <br>It's a story about dreams, ambition and adventuring</br>  <br>The guy's point was how haki wasn't a concrete thing from the story's start but was rather written in later. It's a long-running shounen though so it's hard to hold it under the constant scrutiny of some objective "quality writing" standards.</br>  <br> the awakening of the devils fruits is an asspull <br> implying WhiteBeard's had not awakened his DF to spread earthquakes all over </br></br>  <br> Its a manga about beaches and sunny weather <br><br>It's a manga about  romance <br>That's also why  Jaya/Skypiea  is the best arc</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a manga about romance <br> Nobody has sex </br></br>  <br>So BB immediately got the awakened fruit too?</br>  <br> Awakening is a new thing that kinda came out of nowhere <br>Crocodile mentioned it during Alabastra arc.<br><br>Also </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. That was probably the whole point of risking his life to take it.</br>  <br>It may also imply that an awakened DF stays awakened after his awakener dies.</br>  <br>He did? Thanks for telling me, I'm not that involved in One Piece so I already forgot that and it looked like Oda just had a new idea.</br>  <br> Strongest and most experienced person in the world <br> Not awakening his DF <br>We are going to meet a lot of awakened DF users, I doubt WB didn't awaken his DF, being in the New World for so long.<br><br>Also we have seen 3 different Gura Gura No Mi powers. <br>1) Earthquake punches<br>2) Earthquakes everywhere<br>3) Earthquake "mass" on weapon<br><br>One of them is probably a form of awakening (probably number 2).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He did say that people can increase their DF capabilities and powers. It seemed a lot vague back then, but it makes more sense now. <br><br>There is also a theory that his DF was awakened too. Afterall why would a sand Logia be able to make things become sand instantly?<br>Of course it may just been taking water away from them, but absorbing it?</br></br></br></br>  If i remember correctly, the jailers of Impel Down were Awakened Zoans  <br>He said that DF powers can be increased. To me the most convincing hint about awakening is White Beard. A paramecia can't be so powerful on its own.</br>  <br>I think they were just Smile. That's why they could not return to normal.</br>  <br> can't spell <br><br>Jojofags everyone</br></br></br>  <br>Oh my fucking god. I'll never doubt Oda again.</br>  <br>The only reason you exist is because romance and sex aren't the same thing</br>  <br> all of them have strange colors except the cow <br> japanese pervy boy is a pink dragon <br> all of them can't go back to human <br> japanese pervy boy couldn't too (Smiles are bugged DF) <br><br>That actually makes a lot of sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> all of them have drooling nose and big lips <br>I can totally see those guys being originally 4 brothers then forced to eat Smiles.<br>Or maybe it's a countereffect of some old prototype.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crocodile says they're awakened zoans</br>  <br>What asspull? The only person we've seen so far who has officially "awakened" his fruit is Doflamingo, and guess what? He got his shit kicked.</br>  <br>Artificially Awakened Smiles.</br>  <br>The jailer beasts of Impel Down were awakened too</br>  <br>How though sage chakra was known about early on when Jiara was introduced.</br>  <br><br>Plus awakining was mentioned and hinted many times before.<br>See<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still awakened, so it's not a sudden asspull when Doflamingo mentions awakening the devil fruit powers.</br>  <br>I'm ok with it. <br>Never said it was an asspull.</br></br>   throw in a bunch of terms early on without explaining any of them <br> congratulations, you now have a convenient toolkit for future asspulls <br>Hack writing 101</br></br>  ITT: Tragic manga scenes  <br>Bitch deserved it since women are inferior beings.</br>  <br> TL note: tragic means edgy </br>  <br> tragic <br> character doesn’t either embrace death, use whatever strength/power they have in accordance to their world view or realise a fundamental truth that saves them and/or their loved ones </br></br>    <br>shhhh, don't alert the SJWs</br>   I love you <br><br> I know </br></br>  the mc fuck loli in earlier party though, so not only the mc is edgiest but also rapist kek  <br> Not being the one who fills her dark soul with LIIIIIIIIIIIIGT <br><br>D rank devil hunter</br></br></br>    <br> OMK <br> Tragic <br>Did we read the same thing?<br>The ending is basically "and they all lived happily ever after: the end".</br></br></br></br>  <br>It all turned out well though.<br>It's not tragic at all.</br></br>  I take it this series was supposed to be longer?.

She might slut it up with your best friend  That's what you get, you cheating harlot  <br>Onii-chan did nothing wrong. Fuck that little slut.</br>  <br>Onii-chan was not giving his imouto the proper amount of love, so she looked for it elsewhere. Everyone in that manga was in the wrong</br>  Same author as Nichibros  Probably because everyone is tired of all the /v/ermin and reddit fucks who come straight to them and complain nonstop about being told to conform or leave.  <br>This manga was trying so hard to make the MC out to be the bad guy though<br> How dare you get angry at your best friend for fucking your elementary school sister! <br> Wow, you won't let them date despite only being at least 10 years apart? <br> It's your fault our deadbeat father left us because you kept calling him out on being a deadbeat! <br> You're working hard to support me and get an education, but since you're not spending enough time with me I'm going to go have sex with your friend! </br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I know what you are trying to say, but that doesn't mean that every character in that manga isn't a piece of shit<br> Onii-chan is brutally honest, and works to hard for his sister <br> Imouto is growing up and wants to be loved, and given that onii-chan is always working, seduces his friend instead <br> Friend is an idiot for letting an elementary schooler seduce him, the only good thing he did was not come back in the end <br> Dad was a complete deadbeat who abandoned his children because his son called him out on it. <br>Yes, a lot of emphasis is put on MC being a piece of shit, but that is just to distract you from the rest of the cast being fuckers too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about that  suffering ?  <br>That was my point, MC is hardly the bad guy in the story. Sure, he's a pretty unpleasant guy but everyone else is just as bad or worse.</br>  C A N O N<br>A<br>N<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br>     tfw   the magazine fell through and the story never got picked back up   <br>This is such a depressing manga. Sure, the artstyle looks cute, but damn. Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. The MC is a hardworking, but hard to like guy who just wants to care for his sister. The friend is a victim of circumstance.</br>    Be gentle when you dump the crazy ones  <br>The real kicker is that she get's off scot-free after shanking her ex-boyfriend in front of his sister. Sure, she's in a psych ward, but there were really no consequences for her</br>  <br> victim of circumstances <br><br>Yeah how can We blame him, it's just a peadophile that banged his best friend's little sister who's in elementary school behind his back while that friend worked his ass off for the only family that's left for him. (Yeah the pure little girl that the victim of circumstances deflored)</br></br></br>  <br>Used goods like her won't even sell at a clearance sale.</br>    <br> Woman cut her hair.  <br><br>Didn't read but dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, let me rephrase. He was a victim of circumstance, right up until he kept their relationship going. If he had cut her off after the first time she seduced him, I would have more sympathy. But, as it turns out, little girl pussy is just too dank.</br>  <br>You shut the fuck up. She was more pure than your waifu.</br>  Let's get some decent pages going and not endless boring conversations over 8 panels.  If there is a third, I hope MC stops being such a massive faggot, and gives in to the crazy, qt, time bending mothgirl  Getting people into Mx0 knowing the ending.<br><br>YOU MONSTER FRISBEE</br></br>  <br>  Fuck you  </br>  <br>I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of  heart-breaking suffering </br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>You.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should read it just to condemn japan for their shit taste.<br><br><br>What's the author up to these days ?

Fuck you right in your stupid face</br>  <br>Why does anyone read this shit series?</br>  <br>There are two hints in the biggest panel.</br>  How about, instead of suffering, some tall girls instead?  i don`t get it   fucks waifus and they came <br> turns strong men gar in the pants <br> even hot aunt is beginning to succumb to the true Genji power <br><br>Minamoto is the harem king we need</br></br></br></br>  <br>Posting a better page from later on when it gets a bit less lewd that isn't a downscaled jpeg from some reader site, because more people should read this series.</br>    <br>He fucked a girl in elementary school. He is not a victim of circumstance.</br>  <br> Anime never <br> Maybe it's a good thing </br></br>  <br>Updates when?</br>  <br>No, you are not a victim of circumstance even if you are only once seduced by an elementary school student.</br>  <br>Play Persona Q.</br>  <br>Never ever.</br>        Nothing makes my heart go doki-doki quite like stupid vampire girls falling in love            <br>Yeah, so sad she died.</br>  <br>It's really ambiguous, but there is no evidence to say whether she survived or not. For all we know, she died, and he's burning incense, and he see's her ghost. On the flip side of that, maybe the white hair is from the stress of her surgery, he's cooking and she just came home.</br>  <br>I'll never get why didn't the MC jump all over her. Guess that his charm was not being like everyone else but then again, what was the point?</br>    <br>so first I thought maybe they weren't actually fucking, maybe just some kissing or whatever. then she drops the bomb when she talks to him later about how when she grows up, it'll stop hurting when they have sex.</br>  <br>They're both nude. There was definately some little girl sexing going on here. Plus the look of shame the friend is giving off, and the horror on imouto's face</br>  <br> Naked on the bed <br> Maybe they weren't actually fucking <br>Anon, you can't possibly be this dense.</br></br></br>  <br> she means walk me home gently </br>  <br> walk her home gently  <br>every fucking time</br></br>  <br>maybe he spilled coffee on both their clothes so their only choice was being nude</br>    <br>My little anon can't possibly be this dense</br>  <br>This is such nonsense. He did what he could given how busy he was. His friend is a huge asshole for calling him immature and shit. He was, at first, but manned up when his retarded dad (who explained nothing) took the advice of a child and left.<br><br>Fuck, I'm still mad.</br></br></br>    <br>at least the omakes at the end served as a sort of palate cleanser after reading that mess.</br>    <br>HE COULD'VE SAVED HER</br>  <br>This. It's only good when it's against their will and it upsets them.</br>  <br>She even asked for salvation with those subtle "let's just go out"</br>  <br>Ah, yuri: just what I want from my trap manga.<br><br>Prunus Girl went to shit way too fast. Had great potential too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, they were worth reading to calm down. Plus, ending with yuri was good. I fucking love yuri.</br></br>  <br>The novelty wore off pretty quick. Though it was a happy end.</br>  <br>I this worth the read?</br>              <br>I'll riot if this doesn't end in happiness.<br><br>C'mon, you've got an infinite amount of time to get it right moth-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>This manga is fucking hilarious. Love the scumbag MC who has a thigh fetish.</br>      <br>Moth-chan chose a shit husbando, if he'll run away from her like that, and call her a monster. Then again, she did off his mom because she got in the way.<br> That lying fucking title <br>I thought it was going to be happy, with moth-chan actually being pregnant</br></br></br>    He did not deserve anything that happened to him in this arc.  ;_;       <br>no, its strange ive been here for 5 years and ive almost never seen a /a/ talk about this manga even though it has good art, good story, an anime adoption, neat /k/ stuff, gooks actually looking like gooks and is still ongoing</br>          <br>Is this Naze Toudouin Seiya 16-sai wa Kanojo ga Dekinai no ka? I searched by the guy's name but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Sauce, yandex and reverse gives nothing.</br>  This manga made me fucking sob. Not light crying, actual sobs of pain.      <br>Reiroukan Kenzai Nariya.<br><br>Yes they do.</br></br></br>        <br>I love this one, mostly because every tradition and custom in the manga is so familiar to me since I'm  Turkish . Especially this part made me cry so much.</br>  <br>dont forget shes not wearing the right season uniform</br>      <br>thanks</br>    <br>So was she a normal girl possessed by something?</br>    <br>This guy looks like I wouldn't mess with him.</br>    whatever you do, don't click on the image    <br>Fuck, i can't remember the name for this.<br><br>The girls name starts with a K right?</br></br></br>    The NTR    <br> short as fuck <br> still taking forever to scanlate <br> some smartass translated just the ending for some reason <br>This happens far too often.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Kyoko</br>    <br>GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br><br>Doesn't Alibaba get shit on every arc though? I mean man, I stopped reading a while back, but he was always going though tough shit.</br></br>  <br>There's a TTGL manga?</br>  <br> Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. <br>The girl is really selfish, but all kids are like that. There isn't any "real" villain, except the dad. They were trying to make him likeable, but he's still a piece of shit.</br></br>    <br>First arc is the worst so far, at least from what I've seen. I'm not caught up yet though, gotta read 60 or so chapters. This guy had it bad too.</br>  <br>This any good?</br>  <br>Luruku Mo Aru</br>  <br>holy fuck</br>    <br>Damn, you got me</br>  <br>He left because his son called him out on being a piece of shit, and his daughter got sick of hearing it. Why the fuck would you let your daughter, who is elementary school, push you out of your own fucking house? Jesus christ, the dad is a piece of shit</br>  <br>Well... I'll just tell you, you will feel the need of droping it every now and then</br>  <br>I may check it out then.</br>  <br>btw is in hiatus either by the translators or the mangaka</br>    <br>That's not a great sign, but thanks for the head's up.</br>  <br>This manga sure was a emotional rollercoster</br>  <br>fuck that manga and the most beta MC i've ever had the displeasure of reading</br>  <br>Yep. Basically, Kanda and the dad are human cockroaches.<br>I mean, the imouto told the dad to get out of the house so he can have peace from his chucklefuck son. Okay. But did he use the time out to search for a job and come back home ? Nope. Goin to rest in the mountains. He didn't even give a fuck about his son.<br>Kanda has by far the worst personality, he always puts up a good front and seems like a nice guy, and he's a little shit with no sense of responsibility or self control. And he still calls out MC, a "normal" teen (He isn't more of an asshole than your average 16 years old), on his being immature and shit.</br></br></br>    <br>This manga was really good. Wish it was shorter; there was too much nothing and unnecessary drama.</br>  <br> I think I may "love" this series for discussions about it. Everyone always sounds so passionate about their fury and interpretation can be varied. It's kind of exceptional. </br>  I hoping this thread is the best place to ask but I need help to find 2 mangas I read ages ago.<br><br>One was about a ninja girl who fell in love with a normal guy but the whole ninja clan ended up staying in the guys house they also made the :x face a lot.<br><br>The other I only read the start but it was where a guy was really good at playing piano (I think) but then ended up meeting a girl and doing drugs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even ignoring the fact that he didn't immediately run out of the house when confronted with a naked loli, and continued their fucking relationship, and then calls out MC on being a piece of shit. The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop<br>This manga tries so hard to make it seem like MC is the one at fault, when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>Second one is Bokura no Henbyoushi. The piano and drugs thing is only the first part, it's a collection of short stories.</br>  <br>Interesting read. I wonder what fate the prostitute will have. My gut tells me not good, and he'll have something to do with it.</br>  <br>Yeah, me too. I reread it a while ago, and the way the manga was made also enrages me. It's really pushing the MC as a selfish, unlikeable asshole when he's right about everything.<br>  He's still an asshole for forgetting his imouto's BDay  </br></br>  <br> when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit. <br>The little girl did nothing wrong. She's just a child, and had to shoulder crushing responsibility, which she did. Everything she did that was "wrong" should have been taken care of by the adults :<br>Kanda shouldn't have fucked her<br>Dad shouldn't have listened to her about getting out of the house<br> The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop <br>His way of doing things is absolutely despicable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. Yes, the adults should've acted like adults. But she was the one who seduced Kanda and she was the one who told the dad to leave. She is also at fault here.</br>  <br>Even if his method of leaving was despicable, it was still the only respectable thing Kanda did throughout the entire manga</br>  <br>Well, he also helped out the MC a bit after the dad left.</br>  <br> Not-Kuro looking to sensei as a father figure in the authors next work. <br>I've always loved the relation ship between the teacher and Kuro, glad it's getting more focus in the next work.<br> even if the main guy and not-rin are boring as shit. </br></br></br>  <br>I really did feel that she was the most venomous character in the series. I realize it was because she was a product of her environment and I hope she got the therapy/help she needed after all was said and done.</br>  <br>Updates when. Chapter 11 raws should be out by now. I wanna see the two childhood friends fuck already.</br>  <br>I hope there's a third as well. Would love to see the MC get his mind broken and just fuck the moth girl for all eternity. I still have no clue what the fuck was going on though</br>  <br>And that makes up for all the other shit he pulled?</br>  <br> Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. <br>Kinda does actually. She was even younger when both these things happened. And having a crush/trying to seduce an older teen is quite frequent among children. And it's always brushed off as a joke by the target of the affection. It just took a kiss for Kanda to lose self control and stick it in her.<br>She just told the dad to leave. It wasn't an order, but an advice. Dude booked it the second he heard her say that. Usually this would be followed by the dad telling the girl about why he can never abandon his children. But no. He listened to a 9 year old and left.<br>And keep in mind that for Kanda, she was desperate for affection, she has excuses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Given what happened in the second part, mindbreak is the only possible way moth-chan will have a happy ending, given faggot-kun's actions</br>  <br>It seems like the MC is stuck in some sort of time loop, like he's constantly reliving getting raped as a kid by a moth girl every single day...at least I think that is what's going on</br>  <br>Is IB a light novel or a manga original?</br>  <br>No, just saying.</br>  <br>Moth-chan is reverting time whenever he comes back. But I don't think his mom has ever come into the shed before. Something might have changed</br>  <br>From what I understand, she reverses time each time he returns, so she fucks him as a kid, he runs, 10 years later he gets headaches and returns, and she reverses time again to make him a kid.<br>It's like steins;gate, but instead of repeating time to save tuturu shes rewinding time to fuck the shota.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but to say she did "nothing wrong" is just false. She was the reason for everything that happened. But she shouldn't be blamed for it, I blame the environment she was raised in. Mainly her Dad though, if he just gave a little bit more of a shit about his family this wouldn't have happened.</br>  <br>People don't magically obtain the burden the burden of 'responsibility' on their eighteenth birthday. It's a gradual process where their family and society slowly raise the bar and more is expected of them. Whether or not a person is 'responsible' for something is complicated function.</br>  <br> But she shouldn't be blamed for it <br>Yeah sorry that's what I meant to say.<br>And I get she can be kind of scary as a child, and that now her personality's all fucked up, but she's still functional.</br></br></br>  <br>Barely. I'll be surprised if her tryst's with Kanda haven't made her dependant on using sex to get affection.</br>  <br><br>So basically if I'm right about this:<br><br>-He gets headaches like you said and decides to go back to his childhood home to find out what happened to him in the past<br>-He finds a shed in his parents backyard, where in which his headaches start getting progressively worse <br>-He enters the shed and meets the moth girl<br>-Moth girl rapes him in the present<br>-After he starts crying about how she was the cause of his problems, she reverts time back to the day he was raped as a child. <br>-He runs away as a kid<br><br>Going forward to the newest part of the doujin<br><br>-Once again the MC is back heading toward the shed, suffering from the same issues he had in the first one  basically once he left time reverted back to the present <br>-He enters the shed again and the same thing happens, although this time Moth Girl reverts time back to when he was a kid before she rapes him<br>-She proceeds to rape him as a kid<br>-As the kid is crying his ass off, his mother shows up, something that didn't happen before in the previous time loop<br>-The Moth girl panics and causes something to attack the mother. <br>-The kid runs from the moth girl and goes to rescue his mom<br>-Time once again reverts back to the present, where the MC is about to enter the shed yet again<br><br>so its like the MC is literally stuck in a timeloop put upon by the moth girl so that she can break him in so that he can fuck her for the rest of his life. However the mom showing up was interesting, as that didn't happen in the previous time warp in the first doujin. So I am assuming that different things will happen the more the moth girl reverses time...or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Manga  but it gets shittier as the story goes on. </br>  <br>I'm guessing that there are slight variations each time, and this has happened before as the moth said "again... you are interfering again".<br><br>I'm guessing she keeps trying until she gets a timeline where he stop running away and he becomes hers.</br></br></br>  <br>If she'd been 12 or more at the time she told her dad to fuck off and kissed Kanda, I'd agree.<br>However, this wasn't the case. She was still a kid and there was absolutely no one who dared to say "Nah you're full of shit, you still have a lot to learn"<br>She was raised to be a substitute housewife, and that caused her to think that she's always right about how to handle the house better. She was alone all the time in her house except for Kanda, and when she did what could be called a gesture of desperation and yearning for affection, instead of giving her the usual speech about love and stuff, he gave the child a good dicking.<br>She isn't responsible for anything.<br><br>You might be right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How much is translated, I've only found up to chapter 9. <br> It's not as good, but it's still bearable. </br></br>  <br>Hopefully if the author decides to make another one, which might possibly happen, we'll defiantly get a mindbreak ending, where in which the MC in the present just gives himself to the moth girl</br>  <br> There hasn't been translations after that chapter, only raws </br>  <br>It seemed pretty clear in the epilogue that she hadn't been fucking anyone since then, though.</br>    <br>Let's be honest here, she's going to keep him as a shota sex slave for eternity.<br> Every time he ages past a certain point she just reverts back to him being a kid. <br> I love how a OPT turned into a discussion about the plot of a moth girl hentai. <br><br><br> Does it get worse? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just so insane how this hentai doujin is. Yeah the moth girl is fucking hot and all that, but god damn is the plot drawing me in. Like I wanna see what shit the moth girl is gonna pull next</br>  <br> It does, sadly. Hopefully someone can pick it up so you can see for yourself. </br>  <br> How so? does the MC stop being an edgy faglord because of the power of friendship or some shit. <br> &gt;Last translation like 7 months ago.<br>It's dead isn't it.</br> </br></br>    <br>I said i'll be surprised. I didn't say it was a definate. Maybe onii-chan finally showed her the affection she was craving.<br> Or maybe she and Onii-chan are doing the dirty </br></br>  <br>Sauce? It looks like decent read.<br>Cant find it.<br>Pretty please</br></br></br>  <br>Would you rather have your imouto get fucked by creepy pervy men or do it yourself?</br>  <br>God tier romance manga. This is how you mix sex into story.</br>    <br>Why do you fags self insert into this fucked up situation?</br>  <br>Most overrated thing in OPTs.<br><br><br>MC was awful, but Karin was pure happiness, and that was enough to carry the manga until the rejection, when it went to shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's talking about it hypothetically, you dunce.</br>  <br>Maybe not god-tier, but definately worth a read. Cheating aside, of course, if that's not your schtick</br>  <br><br>Think about it. I'd equate it with letting your kids drink at home because it's a safe place.</br></br>  <br>Except if the reason you're doing it is that she's dependent on sex for affection, that's like letting your alcoholic kids drink at home.</br>  <br>Well it'd be in moderation like only twice per day</br>  <br>But that's still just going to worsen the issue if she's overly attached to sex. You need to make her not dependent on it, not just give it to her.</br>  <br> some smartass translated just the ending for some reason <br>Why do people do this? It's cruel and unusual.</br></br>  <br>Google fu is failing me.</br>  <br>You fail yourself.</br>  <br>Sauce?<br>Show some mercy please.</br></br>  <br>Mitsuharu's short story.</br>  <br><br>Did the trap turn out straight?

I just remember seeing some twitter post saying it will be coming back summer of 2015</br>  <br>She technically  cheated on his boyfriend with MC.   But still, she was using him and didn't deserve to be with him.</br>    <br>Yuusha mc is more of a ZR fetishist</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are all you butthurt. She clearly survived.</br></br></br></br>      <br>So maybe the guy just waked the imouto home gently right?</br>  <br>Didn't realize 10 had been translated at the time I made that post. At the end it says the next chapter would be out on July 25th, so I guess we should see something soon.<br><br>Would like to see her recent shoujo series translated as well. Or was that just a oneshot?</br></br></br>  <br>She's dead?</br>  <br>I'm handicapped with internet here but the filename and Google aren't assisting. Not sure how to use yandex with a phone, though I'll try. In the meantime I'll also check the archive, but anyone mind giving me even an author's name?</br>    <br>I don't understand how the filename couldn't help. It's literally part of the title, and the series is the first thing you get on google when you google it.</br>  <br>He's trying to trick you into spoonfeeding him! Watch out!</br>  <br>I assumed it was porn.<br><br>I regret making that post, I literally found it two seconds after hitting submit.</br></br></br>  <br>It's in the filename, just drop it on mangatraders... <br>It's Mozuya-san Gyakujousuru.</br></br>  <br>You didn't need to say the title, I had a moment of stupidity.</br>  <br>I'm not aware of a shojo she's working on right now, but I'd love to read anything else she's done. Aside from the 3rd grade teacher one.</br>    <br> I assumed it was porn. <br>Why would you think that?</br></br>  <br>http://myanimelist.net/manga/89197/<wbr>Neko_to_Gohan_to_Souteika Sorry for using MAL, but the mangaupdates page has no info on it at all. <br><br>Has anything else she's done besides Kodomo no Jikan and Joou-sama no Eshi even been translated?</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Night time, adult male, little girl, filename sounded like an h artist name I'd heard before (it turned out to be, though not a loli artist), and the art looked kinda lewd to me, kind of like Jikken Shirou's artstyle.</br>    <br>From what I can see, no.</br>  <br> Night time, adult male, little girl <br> probably porn <br>That gave me the chuckles. Not that you're wrong in general, of course.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Source?</br></br>  <br>Glad I brought a smile to your face, anon.</br>  <br>Isn't this spinoff more popular than the original?</br>  <br>It's better, I think</br>  <br><br>It sure deserves to be. I like it far more than Barakamon.</br></br>  <br>Source pls google gives nothing.</br>      <br>Google Yandex and the archive gives nothing, sauce?</br>    <br>Because every girl is best girl. Even the shit tier girl who had the biggest boobs.</br>      <br>next chapter fucking when</br>  <br>Read this the other day.<br>I liked it, nice and short, though by the ending  implies a few things which aren't as happy as it leaves off as , but still a good read overall.</br></br>  /spoiler/deep/spoiler/  Why the fuck the artist make depressing shits when he can make something like this instead?    really need some help finding a manga I want to re-read, I forgot the title and the author's name<br>I still remember some part of the manga tho<br><br>There was this guy who works in a convenience store and a woman who's the head of some company,he signs up for some experimental marriage stuff and he begins living with the woman for money. I remember a reference about a crocodile/bird and panther/turtle</br></br></br>    <br>I refuse to read the sequel after how the original ended. Still mad.</br>  <br>Henjo: Hen na Joshikousei Amaguri Chiko</br>  <br>Thanks.<br><br>Fuck, I tried googling the chinese that turned up and wound up thinking it was System Engineer.<br><br>No regrets though.</br></br></br></br></br>  fuck I love this scene  <br>sauce</br>  <br> that new chapter <br>Why must she keep suffering?</br></br>  <br>Was expecting hentai. Fuck you.</br>  <br> posting Mx0 <br> when it will forever have that ending <br>Do you hate the world, anon?</br></br></br>    <br><br>Murciélago</br></br>  <br><br> literally a whore <br> pure <br><br>She might have a good heart, but come on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I know this one. it has the weird non immortal "operator" chicks and everyone in the world is immortal, right?</br>  <br>Did she kill herself in the end?</br>  ;_;  <br> 450 yen is around 450 yen </br>  <br>Nothing from google or yandex. Willing to share?</br>  <br><br>Alibaba mother was abused by Cassims dad (best friend father) and whored her self out for money for them,then later alibaba found out his father was the king and moved into the palace intill Cassim broke in and stole a ton of stuff</br></br>  <br>I remember reading a manga where the translator said that "(x) yen is about (y) Danish krone". I didn't know if it was a joke or not because he kept using the same currency pretty consistently.</br>  <br>She is pure. This is not up for debate.</br>  <br>Sounds like Norway scans</br>  <br> Danish <br>Wrong Scandinavian country.</br></br>  <br>This is one of Norway's regular things that he thinks is funny. No, I don't agree either.</br>  <br>0 krones is about 0 yen <br>I think it was Norway scans</br></br>  <br>What don't you agree with? I don't understand.</br>  <br>He was upset the translator was using the same currency that wasn't his own I am guessing</br>    <br><br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br>See, the currency thing I don't mind, but interjecting Norway! in the actual panel kills the flow of whatever the hell is going on and pisses me right the hell off.</br>  <br> Watari-kun <br> Ojojojo <br> now this <br>Fuck everything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inserting shitty trademark gags into all your translations.</br>  <br>Better than just writing random comments as TL notes between panels.</br>  <br> Watari-kun <br> Ojojojo <br> canceled <br>W-what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i wish i could be the little spoon</br>  <br>Watari-kun might return in another magazine, so there's still hope. Ojojojo's dead.</br>  <br>I really don't see how little scribbles in between panels can be that much worse than actually replacing the contents of speech bubbles with your very own forced meme.</br>  <br>I forget which manga, but the worst I've seen recently was the one where the guy shoved a meme in the translation and then put "T/N: This is inaccurate but I'm addicted to memes" in the margin.</br>    <br>Updates fucking never</br>  <br> T/N: This is inaccurate but I'm addicted to memes <br>Hey, at least he's being forthcoming.<br><br>Better than<br> horrible joke <br> Editor's note: xDDD </br></br></br></br></br></br>    Will Minamoto ever get the courage to fuck her?  <br>This guy is my Idol<br>  Temp teacher so he doesn't bother with staff meetings <br>  Doesn't bother going beyond the call of duty <br>  Just wants to sleep on the job </br></br></br></br>    <br>Mr and Mrs Fujiyama</br>  <br>Why have the scans stopped</br>  <br> We're looking for a jp-&gt;en translator for Desert Punk. </br>    New chapter is out  <br>reading it now</br>  <br>It's a shame that he's going to change into a better person as a result of Not-Kuro and cute Kohai-teacher.</br>  <br>Wow that's gay.</br>    <br>That side mouth</br>  <br><br>I only watched the Barakamon anime, but this spinoff is great so far it actually made me laugh a few times.</br></br>  Figured a OPT might be the best to ask.<br><br>Where do you guys normally go to read manga?<br>Do you have preferred sites, or backups if the first doesn't have it?<br> I just google and pick whatever looks best, normally. have since forever. </br></br></br></br>  <br>God-tier manga, it was so enjoyable can't wait to read it again</br>  <br>little sis&gt;big sis&gt;loli&gt;glasses=slut</br>  What is this type of pose called?  <br>WHEN WILL HE FUCK THE AUNT?</br>  <br>He wants you to bitch about it on the exhentai gallery comments.</br>  <br>The art is so fucking good I can't believe it..</br>  <br>I use a manga downloader to download from manga viewing sites.</br>  <br>Badass Motherfucking Walk-away.</br>  <br> -Time once again reverts back to the present, where the MC is about to enter the shed yet again <br><br>I don't think anything reverted there, 10 actual years passed before the now grown-up MC returned again.<br><br>That's why Moth-chan is so crazed, she literally has to spend 10 years alone waiting every time for just a few hours of time with him. Whenever he comes back as an adult she reverts time to when they first met, hoping that child-MC won't run away this time.<br>He does, every time, and every time she has to wait another 10 years for another chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Remeber dropping this around the daddy issues girl. <br> It's not at 177 chapters or something. <br>When did it get so long?<br> has there been much progress in regards to anything I guess? </br></br></br></br>  Oh, wow. Guess what is this  <br>I demand information about this.</br>      <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>You got it all wrong. Glasses is only pure.</br>  <br><br>Akai Mi Hajiketa cap3<br><br>Kikimimi Zukan cap5</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll give you hint - anime is airing currently</br></br>  This is the best Re: by far  <br>looks like denpa kyoushi</br>  I still think Guts will somehow end up forgiving Griffith for what he's done    shitty meme manga  <br> meme <br><br>Name one from berserk</br></br></br>  <br/>  I'm just glad that Miura is taking a break from idolmaster again.  <br>still on the boat...</br>  <br> boat <br> man bag <br> le rage face </br></br></br>  I don't know what's funnier. The moron who misused the words shitty and meme because he wants to fit in or the moron who still blames The Idolmaster for Kentaro Miura's lazyness because he wants to fit in.  <br><br>Not in a thousand aeons</br></br>  <br><br>everytime I read this new chapter I feel this fear creeping up on me. I don't know why and I don't know how but only when reading Berserk this fear comes to me.<br><br> tfw Iwata, Robin Williams and Christopher Lee died before reading the new chapter of Berserk <br> tfw I may die before finishing Berserk <br> tfw I may not finish Berserk and HxH in my lifetime <br><br>Maybe my children will finish them but I'm afraid that I'd die and wonder how will it end?<br><br>;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way I see it it's going to go 2 ways.<br><br><br>1. Griffith/The other God Hands sacrifice Falconia<br><br>2. Guts becomes the bad guy by fighting Griffith and thus not allowing the people to have their "paradise"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm still in disbelief at the fact that a chapter came out.  <br><br><br>/a/ never change</br></br></br>  <br>But the question is, will you forgive the magaka for dragging out a series for so long?</br>  <br>Casca a shit</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up you stupid namefag</br>  <br><br>Hell I can forgive Miura for "dragging" out Berserk since the art is nice and the story is rich. And you have the author of Hajime no Ippo after 1000+ chapter Ippo is still a punching bag that uses his head literally to block punches and be the champion. Ippo should just die already and have the manga focus on Sendoh instead</br></br>  <br>I just saw the source yesterday. I'm still mad.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus the Berserk threads have been awful lately.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be more worried about Miura dying before he finishes Berserk. That way not even your children will get to read it. No one will.</br>  <br> Your coffee is shit <br> You drink this shit? </br></br>    <br> 2015 <br> Not liking coffee </br></br>  <br>It's been shit ever since it attracted faggots like a certain tripfag.</br>  <br>yeah fuck that guy</br>  <br> he actually talked to that retarded butthurt hypocritical newcomer <br>You're dumb.</br></br>  <br>The butthurt moron who likes Mihawk is the funniest</br>  <br>There are theories that this guy and the Skull Knight are the one and the same.<br><br>Is the Skull Knight the kind of a person who would murder an innocent?</br></br></br>  <br>SK is Gaiseric</br>  <br><br> Is the Skull Knight the kind of a person who would murder an innocent? <br><br>He literally wouldn't give two shits about murdering an innocent to achieve his goal.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are theories that this guy and the Skull Knight are the one and the same. <br>lol what</br></br>  http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/the-i<wbr>dolmster-r607<br><br>Which one of you did this?</br></br></wbr>  <br> KidCongo </br>  Wow I hate this whore's reasoning<br><br>"dont be mad cause griffith killed anyone who you cared for and pretty much planned to kill you too, stay in the capital! lol!!"<br><br>I swear to god if he/that little girl stay I'll kill myself</br></br></br></br>  <br>He went out of his way to save best girl in the conviction arc and he decided to save guts and casca during the eclipse instead of taking void's hed.d</br>  <br><br>That's getting your priorities straight, not "forgiving"</br></br>  <br>What? I think you meant to reply to someone else.</br>  <br> dont be mad cause griffith killed anyone who you cared for and pretty much planned to kill you too <br>Except she has no idea of what you just said. At all. What she knows is Rickert has a responsibility to take care of the girl and it's safest to keep her in the city.</br></br>  <br>Rickert choosing to stay in the city would be like Guts choosing to prioritize healing Casca over revenge on Griffith. Priorities.</br>  <br>She doesnt know what happened and even if she did, shes still right. Rickert cant go live outside of falconia where demons and monsters are fucking running around everywhere.</br>  Why have berserk threads been so shit lately?  <br>;__;</br>  <br>Nothing left to talk about. This is the fate of every franchise with substance and a substantial number of threads.</br>  <br> he actually spoonfed that retarded butthurt hypocritical newcomer <br>You're dumb.</br></br>   M-Miura didn't really kill her, right? Guts will meet her again in Elf Helm, r-right? ;_;    Old /a/ used to talk about Nanoha daily <br> New /a/ doesn't even talk about the current airing show <br>Has /a/ been taken over by normies?</br></br>  <br>Times change, grandpa. Durarara and Aquarion barely have any threads either.</br>  Vivid anime killed off all new interest in the series.

Hurr let me show you my "awakening" that no one used at marineford and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy </br></br></br>  So Drum Kingdom is going to be independent of the WG, right?  <br>Then Luffy could have easily made Law fuck off with trebol, that isn't really the issue.<br><br><br>I did not deny that, you have no reading comprehension.
