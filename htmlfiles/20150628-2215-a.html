Why can't they do one of Shirow's good works, like Dominion?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching 3dp movies <br> ever </br></br>  <br> Scarlett Johansson <br><br>Fucking why. She fits nowhere in this series. What are they going to dye her hair purple and make her dress up like the pic?</br></br></br>  <br><br> bae tho <br><br>Fuck you, normie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can any 3DPD do justice to the Major's Chara design though?<br><br>ScarJo was chosen because she can do action and is probably one of the better actors among the attractive female actresses in Hollywood.</br></br></br>  1, there's no way this movie will ever actually get made.<br><br>2, that casting is actually just fine.</br></br>  <br>Shit sorry I accidentally put female actresses lol. It's just suppose to be attractive actresses.</br>  <br> throws the box instead of closing it with the lid in her hands <br><br>Darwin when.</br></br></br>  <br><br> attractiveness <br><br>Yes, before she got her breast reduction. Now she looks like an anorexic whore.</br></br></br></br>  <br> breast reduction <br>that really exist?</br></br>  <br>I think scarjo should be replaced with Aisha Tyler</br>  <br> Now she looks like an anorexic whore. <br>I don't think you know what anorexia looks like, anon.</br></br>  I remember the Weebs and SJW's wanted Rinko Kikuchi to play the Major. Stupidest casting choice ever.  At least she has the boobs for it.  <br> &gt;breast reduction <br> that really exist? <br><br>Lots of women get them especially to remove breast implants when they get older. That's actually a necessity. It's one of those odd things on the medical benefits. As for getting corporate medical benefits coverage, it is impossible to have breast implants covered but fairly easy to have breast implants removed.</br></br></br></br>  Not to be like one of the SJW faggots that has sent boards like /b/ further down the shitpipe than they already were, but why not protest this shit? At least it would be a justifiable protest compared to the rest of the shit people bitch about nowadays. The fucking kikes that manage the pocketbooks in Hollywood are never going to stop whitewashing as long as stupid people keep watching the movies and the money keeps flowing from what limited ticket sales they have left.<br><br>In the ensuing aftermath ordinary people would discover the origins of Ghost in the Shell, and more people would probably watch the original series and read the manga than watch the shit piped out by Hollywood once again. If you aren't going to do anything about the issue, why talk about it?</br></br>  <br><br> protest <br><br>Autism aside, it's too late. The normies have already won kiddo, go and look at anime category on netflix if you have it.<br><br>It's only downhill from here<br><br>The only answer is to find a small house in the japanese countryside and enjoy it in the land of the rising sun until you die a lonely death</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> is bae <br><br>How many time that shit tier slang changed of meaning already ?</br></br></br>  <br>This movie was at the easter conference and is already in production :^) it's happening</br>   a movie that makes it living of being technically impressive due to impressive directing, and talented animators <br> "LETS JUST REMOVE THOSE TWO ASPECTS!!!" <br><br>I'm all for adaptations, mostly because I am curious, but really there's not reason why this needs to be made</br></br></br>  <br> Fuck this gay earth. <br>Getting gayer every day.<br>THANKS AMERICANS <br> fucking sodomites </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Protest exactly what anon? The live action adaptation of this movie is going to be stellar train wreck.<br><br>You've got a type-cast actor, who isn't a good fit for the role. You have the movie taking place in New York with CGi effects to simulate future Tokyo. <br><br>To make matters, worse, the director of this movie only has ONE movie under his belt; an edgier version of Snow White, which I must point out was a box office flop. It also has a 33% on rotten tomatoes based on viewer AND critic ratings.<br><br>The rights have been secured, script has been written, and the filming started in February of this year; with the movie slated to release late next year. So, the only thing that we CAN do is not go see it so that it becomes a complete flop and Hollywood leaves future adaptations or continuations alone because it assumes that it was not a good investment in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Well shit, you've got a point. I'm just so tired of seeing the shit that is churned out nowadays, the fact that so many stupid people eat it up, and the fact that unless they get a really good director these assholes don't even do a half-assed adaptation of whatever source material they use, and that goes for anything; not just anime or manga. I guess what this boils down to is personal army faggotry without even intending to make such a request.<br><br>My point is that unless someone takes a stand at some point and forces these people to cease this endless bullshit, we're going to be surrounded by more brain-dead assholes than there already are (did I say that right? It's about midnight and it's been 100 degrees out, not firing on all eight). For the people who actually give a damn and need some sort of escape, everything that we call "entertainment" isn't going to be worth seeing, reading, or listening to. I'm just tired of the defeatist attitude taken towards projects like this; they CAN be a success if the right people are involved... but that's just my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> ScarJo was chosen because she can do action and is probably one of the better actors among the attractive female actresses in Hollywood. <br><br>Oh that's fucking rich. She was chosen because she's popular right now. Her acting is okay at best and her action scenes are also okay at best.<br><br>We all know this is going to be a shitty "we need to stop the hacker before he finds the .txt file containing the whole worlds nuclear launch codes." sorta movie with maybe just the tinniest amount of transhumanism thrown in by accident.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her deciding to get a nose job was like, the best decision ever though.</br>  <br>I'd like to see a proper Appleseed adaption. Not more shitty CG movies, not another low budget OVA, a proper goddamn adaption.</br>   mfw normies start trying to talk about GitS near me   <br>Never going to happen after all these years. Might as well wish for Shirow to give up drawing shiny girl porn and finish the series from where he left off when the Kobe earthquake happened.</br>  <br><br>she's plenty hot but can't act for shit.<br><br>plus you know they're just gonna Whedon up her motoko becuase of Black widow</br></br></br></br>  She was well cast in the role.  <br>You know, Deaunan and Bri's relationship raises some questions I don't think I want answered.</br>  <br><br>He has a penis and it's huge</br></br>  <br>I was more meaning the direct size difference. He's practically a Landmate, she's a fairly normal human.</br>  <br> why not protest this shit? <br>Only in America do teenagers think protesting a Hollywood adaptation of an anime is something worth effort and time. How's your healthcare system working out? How about those cops of your shooting everyone? What about the lack of jobs in your economy? Forget that, protest muh animes!</br></br>  <br><br>she's a flexible girl</br></br>  Not like this year's animated movie will be any different.<br><br>After all, it's the same staff as ARISE, with Tow Ubukata writing it. They haven't learned their lesson at all.</br></br>  <br>  but why not protest this shit? <br><br>Because freedom of expression is a thing and regardless of whetether or not I think the movie will be good ( I don't ) It is well within the producers rights to make this <br><br>I will vote with my wallet and not see the movie in theaters in hopes that it bombs but I will not silence someones freedom of artistic expression simply because I don't like the casting choice <br><br>also you're an idiot</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ghost In The Shell wasn't all that great to begin with. Typical Shirow mystical technobabble that starts great and promptly goes nowhere.  <br>There's still some fundamental logistical issues that I'm sure Shirow has spent a worrying amount of time solving.<br>Maybe that's the reason he dropped Appleseed, after the earthquake he lost his notes on the physical side of their relationship.</br></br>  <br><br>eh Arise is alright, not great but hardly offensive unless you're some SAC baby eager to bitch about the new kid <br><br><br><br>Oshi is the one who made it what it was</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did they actually have a physical relationship? They were definitely close but there was nothing beyond some implied romance in the past.</br>  <br>See also every Ore Monogatari thread.</br>  <br> Did they actually have a physical relationship? <br><br>Yep. He fucked her till she couldn't walk</br></br></br>  <br> Oshi is the one who made it what it was <br>You mean take nice character designs and make them fucking ugly? Because Makoto looks like ass in the GITS movie.</br></br>  <br> but there was nothing beyond some implied romance in the past <br>Did we read the same manga? Honest question, I'm not sure how else it's possible you could've missed their ongoing relationship.</br></br>  <br>Huh, it's been a while. I guess I don't recall that.<br><br><br> Oshi <br>Except his movie is probably the worst adaptation. Stand Alone Complex is way better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to kill everyone that unironically uses the phrase scarjoe.</br></br>  discuss     anime   <br>Manga &gt; Anime</br>  <br><br>But what if it doesn't have a manga?</br></br>  When did you realize that Yui was best girl Anon?  <br>Remember when he refused to drink the water to avoid an indirect kissu with Yui and said he wouldn't be able to taste the water?<br><br>I bet he was just thinking about the spoon and couldn't taste the chocolate until she left and he licked the choco from his face (too sweet)</br></br></br>  can someone explain to me what they were talking about at the end of ep. 13? what was yui going to do if she wins the bet? <br><br>felt like she was giving up on hachiman and instead going to support yukinon and hachiman instead, but at the end it felt like she was gonna try and beat yuki anyways</br></br>  <br>Now imagine everything she done is washed by one official rejection from 8man.<br><br>If that happen FUCK YOU WATARI.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Would have pretty retarded if they were real.<br><br> Anime promo on a big brand product <br> don't even bother making real promo art, just rip off the same art used for the trains </br></br></br></br></br>  Does watari browses 2ch?

After that it was like, it couldn't compare to the first episode.</br>  One Piece  Haruhi  <br>I'm not sure what "irrelevant" means, but they have more than three good shows, and Madoka is not in their top three.</br>  Plastic Memories is the closes this season  <br>Go kill yourself. I bet you like Naruto and bleach.</br>  <br> amazing first episode <br><br> Haruhi </br></br></br>  Angel beats. There I said it    This  <br>Im@s CG<br>WUG if you count movie as first episode.</br></br>  <br>FUCKING  Chaos;Head </br>  <br>Pic not related.</br>  <br>Wrong. Haruhi was shit through and through.</br>  <br>The concert episode was the best episode of any show in the season.</br>  <br>more like the first ~3 eps and then was utter shit</br>  <br><br>no one should disagree with that.</br></br>  Admit it.  <br>this is correct</br>  Surprised this hasn't been posted yet. Awful show, but the first episode was very well done, it's hard to deny that.  This one.<br>It had such a high budget movie like feel to it the first episode.</br>  Tower Of Druaga  <br>The first episode was one of the worst.<br> it's not a bug it's a feature <br>Stupid bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>well obviously, because the premise was the only good thing in the show (so naturally the first episode, which is always premise centered, was good)</br></br>  <br>This show was ass from the first ep though</br>  Wizard Barristers  The beginning of AO was fantastic.  <br>This is the most correct answer.</br>  <br><br>I really wish the author hadn't decided to have there be a system for changing all the characters to look like their real-life counterpart. It would've been much more true to MMOs to have there be tons of slammin' hot female characters who are really played by guys. <br><br>Shit, could've made a great twist for the female lead even.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, this show. When it aired the first episode, I was already calling it the anime of the season. That first episode was fucking dope. Dropped it on episode 5 I think.</br>  <br> Hidamari <br> Irrelevant or shit <br>Get some taste newshit</br></br></br>  <br>The first episode of Plastic Memories was some crazy tear-jerking shit. If you can't feel at least some emotion for a little girl robot crying as she realizes she's about to die, you'd have to have zero feelings at all.</br>  <br>What is so great about KlK's first episode?</br>  <br>Not really. I was cringing right from the start, especially at the part where the random civilian and the war torn soldier are screaming at each other.</br>  <br>Read the visual novel</br>  In fact the first three episodes were fucking amazing.<br><br>But holy shit it went downhill.</br></br>  <br>let's be real here you're probably an overweight college kid from malaysia there's no way I'm gonna be offended by that lmao</br>  <br>You could write it anon.</br>  <br> calling shows like Paniponi Dash! and Hidamari Sketch irrelevant <br> let alone implying they're shit <br>wow</br></br></br>  <br>Rest of the show was still good. Not as amazing as the first few episodes. Up to the point when Eren got eaten by the titan, I had a hard-on for how amazing the anime was. If the anime had ended with Eren just being eaten right there with his entire squad just getting wiped out, I think it would have been the greatest mini-series ever produced in anime.</br>  <br>Don't remind me.</br>  <br>Thats oddly specific anon</br>  I think I'm going to watch the first episode of every series posted in here. I'd love to one-and-done a bunch of anime. Sounds fantastic actually.  <br> lmao <br> doesn't like wide </br></br>  <br>I guess I have no feelings then. I fucking hate this buzzword but I feel that Plastic Memories is a show built on forced drama. All the sadness in the show comes from the incredibly contrived reason that the robots are built with a time limit so they can die and make their owners sad. I couldn't take what I saw of the show seriously because of that</br>  Deceptively well animated first episode that would lead to mediocre animation for the rest of the show and shitty "humans were the real parasyte all along" idiocy.  People don't talk about this anymore  <br><br>Regardless of whether you liked it or not, it's not inconsistent. What you get in the first episode is what you continue to get for the rest of it.</br></br>  <br>The MC pretty much says 'fuck you' to the hoominz r the bad guize faggotry at the end.<br><br>But yeah it certainly went downhill. That second half was mostly boring.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Meh. We didn't even see her for more than half the episode, I can't get that attached to a character in 5 minutes. <br>The scenes with Isla in the last 3 episodes were tough though.</br></br>  <br>Why malaysia</br>  <br> Making me remember this exists <br>Fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Maybe the first half of the first episode. The second half made it very clear the show would be dogshit.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>dropped all on the first episode<br>where are the amazing first episodes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I seriously thought this would have made AOTY until it rapidly declined the moment they started doing their retarded riddles on Youtube.  <br>Two kids stealing weapons-grade nuclear material from a top secret lab was retarded.<br>You should have known.<br><br>The episode where the bomb went of was good though. Stupid on a conceptual level perhaps, but well put together and nice to look at.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone could write it anon.</br>  <br>That's more like edging for hours on end and never cumming</br>  <br><br> I want more fanservice </br></br>  <br><br>More like I just want more honesty in the presentation, but whatever floats your boat.</br></br>  Akame Ga Kill.<br><br>Fuck that bait and switch for making me think it'll get better.</br></br>  <br><br>It would be like that if I thought these shows were going anywhere, but thanks to this thread I know I'm done with the good part as soon as the episode ends, and then I can just imagine the rest.</br></br>  <br>I was more than welcome to suspend my disbelief how 2 genius-savant kids managed to break into a heavily guarded government lab to steal plutonium if it meant I could have had 11 episodes full of them blowing buildings up.</br>  <br>Started edgy, ended edgy.<br><br>First episode was whatever, but I sure didn't think it would end up one of the worst shows of the year.</br></br></br>  <br>I was cringing at the end of that whole episode.<br><br>The 'reveal' was so cartoonish and over-the-top. Not to mention those whiplash-inducing tone shifts.</br></br></br>  Last two episodes made the 47 shitty ones worth it.  Rolling girls was comfy though. 3 and 4 were the only bad episodes. It peaked in the middle with the race and music festival arcs  <br> everyone stands on top of each other and spins with greatswords in dungeons <br> everyone's either a girl wearing almost, a huge guy in armor, or a pretty boy edgemaster <br> everyone is hyper elitist <br> &gt;erp </br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Exactly what I wanted out of it. Such beautiful cringe.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean? It's still mentioned, more so with Euphonium airing. It was also very consistent.</br>  <br>Nah man. Rolling girls fell the fuck apart in the last 4 episodes. I'll agree with you on where it peaked though. Those episodes were great.</br>  <br>First episode was 6/10, watchable but not great.<br><br><br>  an overweight college kid from malaysia <br>You have like ninety different variations on "faggot" you could call him, and instead you choose this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably over half the shows I watch are built around teenagers doing stuff that would never work out in real life. That's not even an issue. "We're terrorists who use non-violent terrorism to make the cops learn about Oedipus," was an issue.</br>    First few episodes were good, most everything after was almost unwatchable. The last episode was decent though  <br>Oh yeah, the pacing was all over and tying up all those plot points was bad but they were still enjoyable.</br>  <br>I thoroughly enjoyed the entire thing.</br>  <br>It was cute and fun. Great OP+ED too.</br>  <br>I don't see how you can post that image and say it was great when most of the show after episode four cut out the fun and focused on shitty drama.<br><br><br>OP and ED were great. It would have been my AOTY had it stayed good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did I let it fool me.</br>    Mekakucity Actors had a ep1 that i could rewatch many times, but the series fell flat on its face.  <br>Finishing that show felt like dragging myself through a field of rusted barbed wire.</br>  <br>I'd say AssClass was good overall but that first episode was great</br>  <br> all that budget </br>  <br>Oh man I completely forgot about this show. I remember there being plenty of threads though.</br>  <br>I "dropped" it at episode 6 back when it was airing.<br>I actually am planning to finish it soon though.</br></br>  <br> plenty of threads <br>At the start, sure. Then they got really quiet.</br></br>  <br>My fucking nigga.</br>  <br>It was still a good series as a whole. 8/10, not worthy of being in this thread which is for mediocre shows.</br>  <br><br>This. It completely fell apart shortly after the halfway mark. It peaked in the first episode to be honest, but the racer arc was great too.<br><br>But fuck me if it didn't go to shit in the last third.</br></br></br></br>  Elfen Lied.<br><br>Wonderful first half of the first episode, then runs out of steam quickly.</br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/UhmBnaEcbfA  [ ]<br>lel</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding?</br>  <br> RAISON D'ETRE <br> RAISON D'ETRE <br> RAISON D'ETRE <br> RAISON D'ETRE <br> RAISON D'ETRE <br> RAISON D'ETRE </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Amazing soundtrack though.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pyi<wbr>BOwTQRMQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Obligatory  <br>That fucking show, they killed fox but everybody refuses to die even when they were supposed to.</br>  Ontopic, Campione. Started like it was going to be different, INSTANTLY became haremshit beta MC plot armour etc.<br><br>Opposite of topic, Busou Shinki. Weak first episode, okay second, fucking amazing everything else. I miss that show so goddamn much.</br></br>  <br>After the father died it went to shit. Purple was best girl.</br>  <br>How do people even like Love Live.<br>It's not even in the same galaxy as iM@S.</br></br>  <br>M a r k e t i n g<br><br>I was In Akiba both six months ago and today and the only consistent presences there are Love Live and for some fucking reason Angel Beats. Both of those are EVERYWHERE.<br><br>Obviously I'm not even bothering to mention mainstream stuff like Dragon Ball or One Piece.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>First episode was the husband and wife in the car, right?<br>One or two of the other episodes were better I thought.</br></br>  I was going to say something else but I forgot. I'll go with Sora no Otoshimono. I'm not into fanservice or harems as I think they're just boring. But the first episode was really interesting, it could have been a really great movie if they expanded on what happened. After that I felt like I was lied to. I actually do enjoy the plot whenever it pops up. When Nymph was introduced I decided to stick with it, but most of the time it was hard to pay attention. I liked the humor sometimes.<br><br><br>Arcana Famiglia? The first half of the first episode was completely awful. It was just characters being introduced, and in turn introducing other characters by name, the most formulaic way they could have done it. The second half started on an interesting plot and got me to keep watching but the rest of the show was them going on picnics or being angsty about arbitrary shit. The final episode was the worst.</br></br></br>  <br>i mean this whole was a let down didnt live up to the hype</br>  <br> angel beats <br>I feel very annoyed by this.</br></br>  <br>I don't even know why it's everywhere, didn't that shit end years ago?</br>  <br>The doujins are fucking incredible.<br><br>I would suggest watching it just so you can appreciate them more.</br></br></br>  <br>I watched it while it was airing it was 2010 or something, it wasn't even that good. <br><br>iM@S doujins are incredible too.</br></br></br>    I have JUST the fucking answer for this OP.<br><br><br>Kotoura-san.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't even remember the first episode, aside from jizzing at the mech animations.<br>The boxer episode was pretty great though.</br></br>  <br>Idiot</br>  <br>We already said that dipshit.</br>  <br>It's not the anime's fault, it had to follow the manga.</br>    Gungrave  Re:monster (manga).<br><br>The manga seemed so promising but the WN was absolute shit. At least it lead me to find Mushoku Tensei and some fun chink powerlevel WNs.</br></br>  It felt like the whole budget was spent on first episode.  <br>worst main girl in existence? I certainly think so</br>  Tall green Ryuuko is best girl  <br>Sorry to all the fans out there.</br>  So I guess the lesson here is that anime that try to stick to some convoluted story with extremely weak characters, suck? Action packed adventure of the week type shows are always the best  <br>Loved the first half, second half was meh. So yeah, 8/10 for me.</br>  <br>Thank god I dropped it one the first episode then.<br>Somebody post the weg ski thing</br></br>  <br>REGENTROPFEN SIND MEINE TRÃÃÃNEN</br>  ITT: I really need to watch the first episode of Kotoura-san.    <br>I agree.<br><br>This show, man, I know it isn't the greatest thing around but I just liked it so much.<br>The whole setting was pretty cool, shame the story and plot were all over the place but I wouldn't mind watching another show like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd argue that the best scene in the show was the bike ride.</br></br>  <br> muh music <br>It was alright.</br></br>  <br><br>it was comfy watching. nice music too</br></br>  <br> that tight pacing and focus in the first episode <br> episode 2 introduces everyone at once in the most gimmick character way possible </br></br>  <br><br><br>It wasn't just the music, the whole scene had a great sense of Lisa's emotion. I'd say the ferris wheel scene was the best part, though.</br></br></br>  <br>And I really liked some of the background art too.<br><br>But I don't have any good pics of that saved.</br></br></br>  Season 3 basically confirmed, right?<br>They wouldn't end on such an utterly unsatisfying anticlimax unless they intended on making more, right?</br>  <br>is this b8?<br>of course not his is "read the LN" ending there will be no season 3</br></br>  Here's mine:<br><br>Monday:<br>Teekyuu<br>Non Non Biyori<br><br>Friday:<br>Soma<br>im@s Cinderella Girls<br>Miss Monochrome<br>Wooser<br><br>???:<br>DRRRx2 2<br>Gatchaman Crowds<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127283360#p127283360">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will I need to watch Aquarion Evol before Logos? I've loved Genesis but I heard Evol sucks so I didn't watch it.  pretty good  <br>Evol wasn't that bad. That's more of a meme if anything. It's not like there's an abundance of good anime that are keeping you from watching it anyway.</br>  <br> wasn't that bad <br>Actually, I agree. The fact that I blotted out every episode after the banana one makes it so much better than it actually is.</br></br>  <br>You won't be able to speculate about reincarnations as well</br>  They never even kissed ONCE.  <br>Rin's VA posted it on twitter</br>  <br>It's the front page of the script Rin's VA had for this episode.</br>  <br>Holy shit, the end was cute.</br>  <br>she's wonderful</br>   script covers are accurate representation of what happens in the show <br><br>Sure, Shinji was so happy he had the Grail, right? Are shipperfags so desperate to prove they have a nonplatonic relationship that resort on fanservice where 'Shirou' resembles Archer to make it more acceptable to the Japanese fanbase that largely ships Rin with Archer?
