Or something.</br>  Hopefully more Laurenfrost imouto in this volume.  <br>Is this that one LN where the MC /ss/'d and became a legendary trap?</br>   airing in an hour <br> no thread <br><br>Dead show.<br>Dead fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  I could list everything wrong about it, but it's 1:00 AM here.  <br>I thought this aired on saturday.</br>  <br><br> Classroom <br><br><br>This is a complete turn off for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to watch it live, I was just too lazy to make a thread.</br>  Igarashi SB today, hyped  <br>It's a corporate drama with betrayal and intrigue. Or something like that.</br>  <br>It has much more than a school setting since they have on the job training as engineers as well as a corporate plot line</br>  Please don't mock sensei today. He's trying his best.  <br>isn't that tomorrow?</br>  <br>I want to marry Sensei.</br>  <br>Is it though? Is it anything?</br>  <br>No, you're confusing it with A/Z again. It's today.</br>  <br>Supposedly it will be clear by ep4.</br>   Motivated by his own speech.   <br><br>Great, he's turned into the jaded veteran who drinks instead of doing something useful. I hope he gets over it off screen.</br></br>  <br>Sensei a shit.</br>  who /Engineer/ here?  Half an hour to go.  Who /purple Inaho/ here?  <br>She's the reason I'm watching this.</br>  Who /yuriOTP/ here?  <br>Engineers best A-TECs</br>  <br>Girl Inaho/Orange Girl best couple. The guys can fuck each other, everyone's happy.</br>  STARTING  Sensei got rekt<br>Also dat Kobayashi Yuu</br>  <br><br><br>Me</br></br></br>  What was that about a spin-off about Iris and Mizuki?  Well done sensei, now they're all unemployed  <br>I can't into moon. What happened?</br>   that part where Iris tried to console Mizuki   Is Nagisa homosexual?  <br>how was it I missed it</br>  I want Nagisa to look down on me.  Suddenly Nagisa ass.  <br>  grill?  </br>  Too much dialogue, I didn't understand shit.  This seems to be shaping up what I wanted Plastic Memories to be, company stuff + a group actually working together instead romcom drama. Also Christmas cake flirting with underage man. Lot of good faces thanks to Igarashi.  <br>Dat ass though.</br>  <br> Dead fanbase. <br>There was no fanbase in first place, retard. To die something must exist.</br></br>  <br> bullies Sensei while encouraging him to try and drag him down <br> ignores hot woman in a towel <br>You tell me, anon.</br></br></br>   no capper on futakuro <br><br>Completely RIP.</br></br>  <br>I can't figure out my opinion of this show is. It's kinda shit, but I'm still intrigued.<br><br>Pilot best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Same. I'm still watching for GirlNaho, Mizuki and maybe Sensei. Also they said episode 4 was going to be important.</br>  I watch it for OreImo art style  <br>Sera was made for bullying</br>  I just want a show about mechanics ding mechanics things. . . <br><br><br>Pretty sure this is as close as I'm going to get.</br></br></br>  <br>Same.</br>  The only consistently good thing about this is Iris giving zero fucks about absolutely everything (except of course Mizuki).  <br>Iris is the only reason I watch this crap.<br><br>Her blowing off the Edgelord Buisiness guy is great</br></br></br>  <br> Igarashi storyboarding this episode <br>Can't wait</br></br>  Sensei was moe today.  <br>To be fair, there isn't any caps of Shokugeki no Souma episode today on futakuro as well.</br>  <br>TBS must be fucking up something then.</br>  Episode was 95% talking and money drama, the rest was Sensei drinking, Nagisa shower scene and 1 second of Iris/Mizuki. Still going to watch the next one.  <br><br>That only means that no one cared to be capper in there</br></br>        Who's this bitch    <br><br><br><br>Reminder that Nagisa finds this less interesting than working on the computer and angsting in the shower.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how successful men are made. You can't get to the top if you're weak to flesh.</br>    <br>Dat ass.</br>  Why do people link Purple with Inaho? I thought she looked more like Yuki.  The cutest.<br><br><br>Which Inaho are we speaking?</br></br></br>  <br>What other Inaho do you know?</br>  <br>She acts exactly like Inaho. So she's either Female Inaho or Inaho and Hime's lovechild (because she has Hime's VA)</br>  <br><br>I guess you mean A.Z Inaho then? I didn't watch A.Z S2 and wasn't sure if I'm remembering the name right.<br><br>I see the similarity but the fact that she's not MC and is openly recognized as a super-talented person who's been fished out from all over the nation as opposed to just being coincidentally there makes the whole thing much more believable and less obnoxious.</br></br></br></br>  Sensei will save A-TEC next week. I believe in him.  <br> complaining about mecha MC coincidentally being there </br>  <br>Because they are retarded newfags<br><br>Except Inaho was planning everything and was backed by the eye, Iris is completely reckless</br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched almost no mecha shows in my life but going by the only other one I remember, Buddy Complex, holy shit you're right.<br><br>Didn't know this was a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inaho was completely reckless whether he planned things or not.</br>  HS is up now    <br>Yes! I can finally understand boring business crap and Nagisa angst.</br>  <br>Inaho confirmed for beta<br><br>Iris confirmed for alpha.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why you bother watching it if you find the business stuff boring.</br>  <br>Is she also female L-Elf/Yuuki Kazami as well?</br>  <br>It has potential. I'm waiting for A-TEC to start fighting back not just them getting BTFO because their fucking around isn't profitable.</br>  How long until Iris will fall for Nagisa for real?  <br>fuck off, this is maruto's first attempt at yuri</br>  <br>They're both gay, so never.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are brother and sister from the same mother, you mongoloid.</br>  <br> Oreimo character design <br> MC is a 20-something old dude <br> Male ass shoot <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br><br>Just who is this show aimed at?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both reckless but stoic types who do everything for a girl. They're whatever that means.</br>  <br> yuri <br>Stop it<br>She obviously was disgusted by gay antics of her friend in this scene<br>Yes, even autist like her showed real human emotion</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>    <br>Everyone other than shounen, haremshit and straight romcom fans.</br>  <br><br>Take off those anti-yuri goggles.</br></br>  <br>Maybe there's some medication that could help with your autism, anon.</br>  <br>And if you think that's not enough, read the lyrics of the very same OP.<br><br>It couldn't be any more blatant really. Absolutely no holding back on this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Iris seems pretty into Mizuki, but it doesn't seem to be the same way in reverse</br>  <br>Lyrics about her and Nagisa, retard</br>  <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br>Like Hyouka's first ED?</br></br>  <br>Anon, you're cute.<br><br><br>The ED has Mizuki being all over Iris, and the show showed us Iris being all over Mizuki.<br><br><br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking retarded<br><br> takes away all the tools <br> use your creativity <br> told to top-end R&amp;D </br></br></br></br>  <br>He is going to get orange as a rebound.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are sibling, retard<br><br> Nagisa knows her name <br> ED shows Iris being all sad and shit, hinting sad past <br> Nagisa is a bastard child <br><br>HURR HURR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is dumb.  Not enough female Inaho.  No I don't want the cute nerd boy to leave  I still don't get the point of this garbage anime  <br><br>Maruto wanted to try something different from haremshit. Unfortunately, it backfired.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? It was pointed out the most simple way possible in this episode. Just drop it if you can't follow it even that much.</br>  <br>It's a clusterfuck</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/notcycaiyt.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Don't worry, it'll catch fire eventually, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>  Podracing when?  <br>How exactly, or are you just spouting out words? So far it's very simple story of two plotlines, Nagisa VS his brother and Sera trying to save A-TEC. And both of them are getting connected together.</br>  <br><br>Your face is a clusterfuck.<br><br>How fucking ADHD do you have to be not to get what's going on in this show?<br><br>Well, some parts are complicated. Nagisa's exact intentions aren't clear yet, but that's all.<br><br>One of the better shows of the season so far if you ask me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salarymen are right - the anime</br>  <br>now rei clones are called "female inaho"</br>  <br>It's just for the Mars setting retard.</br>   she sees your budget management   <br>Monstershit and haremshit prison are right next door.</br>  <br>That makes even less sense though given the amount of mecha newfags on this board its no wonder they think A/Z invented everything</br>  <br>Is Yuu Kobayashi typecast nowadays?</br>  <br>Yeah, A/Z is now also the only mecha anime that did the generic Mars/Spacenoids VS Terrans setting. Now I get why everyone on this board compare anything to that forgettable show, it's the only war themed anime they've seen.</br>   there are people that honestly haven't realized that edgy oreimo-man and girl inaho are going to end together   This ending reminds me of the Hanamonogatari ED.  <br> I am this blind </br>  <br>Without a doubt. It's sad considering the range she can do.</br>  <br> there are people who are honestly going to force this meme in every thread from now on <br><br>We need context-sensitive mods so we can successfully report shit like this.</br></br></br>  I really enjoy Nagisa and the accountants side of things compared to the A-TEC team. To see Sensei get absolutely laid into both Nagisa and Accountant in the beginning felt so satisfying to watch.<br><br><br>The engine the class was working on in the very beginning looked like Anakin's podracer engine.<br><br>When it gets up and running, someone better shout "IT'S Working, IT'S WORKING!" or else I'll be very disappointed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's the only war themed anime they've seen <br><br>While that might be true, A.Z is still fresh in the board's memory, hell there have been comparisons a lot of comparisons with Valvrave too. There's no need to get all butthurt only because you watched some other entry level mecha like Gundam.</br></br></br>  <br>If you've seen lot of robot war anime then it's just another forgettable one among many others. It did nothing special and it doesn't really deserve the attention it gets, whether it's positive or negative attention. Comparing CC to AZ because both have Mars setting in them(when you can barely even notice they live on Mars here) is just ignorant. I'm surprised people still even bother remembering it.</br>  <br><br>I hate it.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter if it deserves the attention it gets or not, people still keep talking about VVV or Cross Ange despite both being absolutely horrible too, they just happen to be quite recent or left some impact in the board, for one reason or another, when they were airing. That's all there's to it.</br>  <br>It's even worse when A/Z never actually explored the Mars setting at all so the comparison makes even less sense. I would have went with Rei-clone, female Chirico or hell even a female Setsuna since at least they're more popular.</br>  <br>Do you actually think this will be a thing? /u/ bait very rarely becomes anything more than bait.<br>There probably won't be any romance at all.</br></br>  <br>You've never had a job with a shit boss?</br>  They have no creative spirit. Terrible engineers, all of them.<br>This anime hits me in the right spots though. I'm enjoying it.</br>    <br><br>Yup, she's also Smith from Monmusu lol<br><br>Well, Iris is Miia, and Mizuki is Papi as well...</br></br></br></br>   tfw your teacher fucked up with his naive dreams and you now have no education or experience for any real job <br>Becoming a boipussy is the only choice.</br>  <br>10/10 hank hill ass.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>I have yet to watch the episode... they fired shortpants?</br>  <br> boipussy <br><br>Wait isn't that a girl?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you understand how art works.</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you so autistic about this? At this point you're just bringing more attention to A.Z. Let it die in peace.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you?</br>  <br><br> Get OreNoImouto character design <br> Do a speculator ass-shot with it <br><br>Sure, why not?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He left on his own, he's the rocket tester and can't do shit in those conditions.<br>Though I'm hopeful they all come back and can do podracing again.<br><br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a girl called Subaru last season.</br>  <br>Fuck these kids and fuck the teacher. Bunch of spoiled self-entitled cunts.</br>  <br>He quit.</br>  <br>Well, yes.<br> Also most Japanese names are gender-neutral, newfriend. </br></br>  <br>I hope we will see them cry like bitches the moment they realize they did the wrong choice.</br>   nii-san   So Nagisa's broher is hogging the money to his own pocket and uses A-TEC as excuse?  <br> Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you? </br>  <br>MC saved A-TEC. Had he left them in their state they would have disbanded in less than 3 months.</br>  I want to fuck girl Inaho and watch her stare blankly into my eyes.  I'm really enjoying this. It's Maruto and all, but I hope this continues to ignore romance for the business and regular drama.  Is MC a faggot?  I skim through the episode now after the first ep.<br>It's so fucking boring.</br>  The Glasslip of the season.  <br>He has no time for needy Christmas cakes</br>  <br>Fuck off, retard</br>  <br>He's alpha. Wanting to fuck constantly and doing it when presented the opportunity at the drop of a hat, is a sign of a virgin.</br>  <br><br>Next episode looks like it's gonna be hijinks...<br><br>He said to watch out for ep 4, but it's probably another bait and switch episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you people understood that wrong. He said that by episode 4 you have the whole idea what kind of show this is, as it's more slow-paced and we still aren't entirely clear what Nagisa is about to do.</br>  <br><br>Yes, end-game pairing are Iris x Mizuki and Sensei x Nagisa</br></br>  The best transfer student  <br><br>Guess that's when Nagisa lays out his goals then</br></br>  <br> his goals then <br>Become CEO<br>Destroy brother<br>Get some student pussy</br></br></br></br>  DISREGARD BITCHES<br><br>ACQUIRE INFLUENCE AND POWER</br></br>  At the same time I think it's good if the cast size is being cut half but then again I don't want some characters to leave. How can the smug boy leave his nerd bro behind, at least keep him.  <br>Whit dat ass nobody notized the scars on his back.</br>  <br>But anon, I too would prefer to work on a functioning spaceship than wasting my time with a girl like that.<br>It's much more thrilling and satisfactory.</br></br>  Not you too.  So, is the CEO secretly embezzling funds for some shadow project? <br><br>I hope it's not going to be that the Kirishina company is somehow trying to create weapons or new types of military craft because that is more profitable, or even fund a private army of mercenaries to take over stuff. That would be too cliché.</br></br>  <br>Asumin leaving, THAT really broke my heart. Though now that they have Angelina I guess she's become actually superfluous. If only they had listened to her all along, they could've prevented this.</br>  <br>I think the brother is incompetent and the company is going down the drain.</br>  <br> posting Korrashit <br><br>Now you have me convinced you yurifags are just trying to stirr shit up. That is, if you even are the real thing and not just some bunch of falseflagging shitposters who are still riding high after your success of killing countless Hibikek threads.</br></br></br>  STOP BULLYING  <br> yurifags <br>You realize that's an anti-yuri poster?<br><br>The yuri in this show is overt. Go watch it.<br><br>Also I don't remember a single time I've seen "yurifags" ruining a thread, but I've seen countless times people were complaining about "yurifags" supposedly shitting up threads, and actually shitting up the thread in the progress.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But they're selling laser-guided vehicles and are some sort of huge insurance company now. <br><br>By having made the A-TEC R/D department irrelevant, surely the company wouldn't have any financial problems anymore. <br><br>Unless the big brother CEO did some really terrible investments.</br></br></br></br></br>  You guys seriously have nothing better to discuss than the potential yuri or lack of thereof between a background character and the MC's sister? Really?  <br> The yuri in this show is overt. <br> This is what yurishitters actually believe <br><br>Here we go again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first time witnessing shitposting on /a/? Forcing straigh vs yuri wars has become the method du jour for that.</br>  <br>Thank you based Christ. I got about three minutes into this episode before realising I needed to start 120Sing it.<br>Returned for dat ass, though.</br></br>  Just finished ep 3. First episode was ok, second was meh but this one was actually good, just need a little more of this and we are good to go.  <br>Shame it's starting out so slow and takes some sweet time for getting into gear. That's a risky road to take for an anime original show, since a substantial portion of the brain dead general audience suffering from ADHD will have dropped it by the second episode. Just look at our very own threads.</br>  For what purpose?  <br>Yes I have, what is Subaru going to do from now on, will he ever come back, will he ever be smug again.</br>  <br>yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom<br>gotta bait those fujo bux if you want to turn a profit<br><br>kiryuu is a true business hero, saving a-tec and disc sales at the same time</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. Despite the company he's still managing to fuck it up, and due to the brother complex, he don't want to be seen as inferior to his little brother. So he's thrown him at all the toughest problems and given him impossible jobs, but he's still managed to save every company he worked for and give them V shaped results. <br>Now the older brother is getting even more angry and has thrown him at the A-TEC department, hoping he won't be able to save it.</br></br>  <br>There's lot of man ass this season. Kobayashi's little boy butt in Chinpo Kitan, shower scene in Prison School and now this.</br>  What's wrong with alpha-females?  <br>Only faggots let themselves be pushed around by women.</br>  <br> Angist in the shower <br> Sensei red face shows up <br><br>I thought he was going to fap to sensei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri people are wearing their goggles tighter each season, anon.<br><br>Soon they'll claim that BL-shows are yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean, why did she got mad when she was called alpha?</br>  I love the faces, it was especially good with Igarashi's SB this episode. Also that Iris.  So did DDY drop this show or what?<br>they had the only good release of the first episode.</br>  <br> yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders </br></br>  <br>I think they're aware the material might be a bit boring for some, so they add in some fanservice to keep people interested until something exciting happens.</br>  <br>nobody watches this shit</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be easier for the big brother CEO to simply promote his little brother into a position where he'd have absolutely no influence? Also, there would still be that problem with the funds for A-TEC that aren't being reported to the rest of finance and administration. They do say that the money has to go somewhere. Would the big brother CEO really use it to pay some huge debts that were caused by his own incompetence?</br>  <br>Igarashi and his sunsets</br>  <br>And since when that stop they keep making yuri?<br>Probably is a sucess but you are ignoring other things</br></br>  <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders <br> and yet the show as a whole barely sold somewhat decently <br><br>your revered hibikek was no smash hit, anon</br></br></br></br>    <br>you are cancer<br>kill yourself</br></br>  This show is really bad. I think it's only going to get worse. The only shows this season less deserving of threads are like:<br><br>- Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan<br>- Dandelion<br>- Shimoneta</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's professional baiting.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>i am the quimioterapy</br>  <br>Japan likes their women to be subservient Yamato Nadeshikos. Therefore instead of calling her "alpha woman" she might as well have called her an unlovable hairy bull dyke.</br>  <br> Kuusen <br><br>The only one you got right.</br></br></br>  <br>Engineer Flamenco just wanted to dream</br>  <br>You're probably just some random shitposter who's into roleplaying. In a way, it's even worse than tripfagging. So yes, you should definitely kill yourself.</br>  What is this show even trying to do?<br><br>They marketed it with the two girls, but they don't do anything and Kaito and Nagasa are for all intents and purposes the protagonists. Then they yuribait in the ED while having the actual show focus only on Kaito and Nagisa, complete with gratuitous man-ass of Nagisa. Commit to one thing and stop trying to pander to everyone, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>Either you're retarded, or you're commenting despite not having watched the show yet, which I guess also makes you retarded.</br>  This show needs more of the shota.  <br>But he left  ;_; </br>  <br>He and the IT guy are the best characters.</br>  <br><br>That's why</br></br>    <br>This director's last work ignored the cutest smug shota most of the time after episode 1, I don't trust him anymore.</br>  <br>FFF is doing it, though I have no idea how their release is.</br>  I'm not picking this up until the ending is confirmed to not be edgy drama relationship garbage like WA2.  <br>At the very least they're better than Crunchyroll</br>   Claris ED <br><br><br>I thought they had split up?</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't much better than CR, which they were likely editing from. They did typesetting and fixed some of the more blatant errors, but name orders were still getting switched around.</br>  <br><br>WA2 was an exception, the last anime he worked on was very fun to watch.</br></br>  <br>One of them left the group, remaining one brought in another friend.</br>  D-did they fuck?  <br>Saekano was also edgy relationship garbage with that bully tsundere.</br>  <br>Apparently not. She did intend to, he on the other hand just baited her by allowing her to use the bath.</br>  <br><br>I see. Still sounds more or less like before to me. Not that I mind.</br></br>  <br><br>That was only one scene in episode 9 and it ended with the tsundere getting BTFO</br></br>  <br>He's gay.</br>  <br> shower scene immediately cutting to this face <br>No wonder</br></br>  <br>Please, even if he was gay he wouldn't have such low standards.</br>  <br> hot teacher <br> low standards <br>pl--<br>oh, you mean teacher about Nagisa. Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Nagisa is rich, ambitious, powerful and good-looking.</br>  <br>He's scarred to hell and back, probably ass raped used goods.</br>  <br>Ahhhh, corporate politics and embezzling fraud. I love this so much it hurts.</br>  <br>But Sensei is hardworking, cute and kind<br>Please don't bully</br></br>  I wanted to drop this show, but god damn that cast. It even has Chiyo-chan. I can't do it.  <br>I like him, that's why I bully him</br>  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>Thought that was her voicing Angelina<br><br><br>Didn't he call her Hattori-kun before going to the shower?</br></br></br></br></br>  I watch this for her.<br><br> Yes, my autism is at such level. </br></br>  2cute4me  <br><br>Only reason to watch this show. I want to see more of her racing.</br></br>  Nagato a cute   Subaru quit <br> PR qt quit <br>Will they come back, /a/?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Of course. Theres going to be that generic scene where the characters that didn't leave are all working towards some goal which has time constraints and then all the characters who left start showing up one by one saying stuff like "Heh looks like you can use a hand." and all that.</br></br></br>  This is bullying.  <br>Nothing wrong with that. Those sensei and those kids were running things like lockheed martin.</br>  <br>Literally the only reason I'm still watching  but to be honest I'm still kind of interested in all the business drama. </br>  <br> probably ass raped used goods. <br>This, you don't go from illegitimate child from rich soon-to-be-CEO without pleasing few old-men for money.</br></br>  He wants A-TEC to succeed ultimately?  <br>Seriously, she was the best.</br>  <br>Probably. Even if it's just to spite his older brother. Of course, officially, he will comply with his orders and do whatever is necessary to downsize A-TEC, but in a way so that it actually still retains enough efficiency and really forces the staff to be extremely creative, searching for new ways to be cost-effective, environment-friendly, cheap, and yet good.</br>  Who Subaru here?  I really like the ED song. Full version when?  Nagisa wants to fuck Kaito right?  <br>They actually the spoiled kids, they really should known that money is serious problem.</br>  <br>Yes. Chief said Nagisa needs him sexually.</br>  another show that could have been great with maybe half the characters. I feel like the other half is just there because they had some anime cliche quota to fill.  <br>Ehh. R and D should be the last place you cut money if you're a megacorp. Google pisses away billions on its new hires, and they do so because one good innovation can literally change or even create an entire industry.</br>  <br>Well you're in luck because half the cast just left forever this episode</br>  <br>Yeah, he's the tough love boss.<br><br>...AKA totally fucking boring, give more screentime to Iris</br></br></br>  <br>Is it really R&amp;D if it's a group of sixteen-year-olds pissing away their money with nothing but a busted rocket to show for it?</br>  <br>Yup. Have you seen the first few Space X launches? The early days of Nasa? Shit's on fire, yo.</br>  <br>Was Space X created by sixteen-year-olds?</br>  <br> Chinpo Kitan <br><br>How have I not heard that before? Also, what the fuck is up with all these shitters watching this show and complaining about it not being haremshit?</br></br></br>  <br>What about F-35-chan?<br>What's the excuse?</br></br>  So will sensei plow the delicious Christmas cake?  All auditors as scary as Angelina?  <br>This show is about business. Like all this shit is about business. Next thing you know, they're going to be doing six sigma or some shit as well as have someone do the quality and process management.</br>  So, do they expect us to be on the side of A-TEC? So far, I'm feeling Nagisa has the better side.  The A-TEC students and Kaito are spoiled as fuck. That much money wasted on a rocket that ultimately got destroyed, and they request even more? Angelina was 100% correct with everything she said to them. All that money with no innovation. Terrible. And they wonder why they're downsizing.  <br>That seems to be why most of them left after the huge budget/facility cut.<br>Being used to being pampered with all that nice shit and to fool around in because of how special they are.</br></br>  <br> MC </br>  is this the worst thing maruto has written?  <br><br>Yes. How did he go from writing masterpieces to writing this?</br></br>   generic fanservice harem romcom <br> /a/ hates it, demands that studios drop the cheesy romance in favor of plot and subtle characterization <br><br> office drama with heavy dialogue and no apparent romantic arc <br> /a/ hates it, wonders why nobody is having sex </br></br></br></br>  Who exactly is this show pandering to? There aren't really moeblobs, not a lot of action, and I wouldn't say any of the characters are self-insert worthy.  <br> Engineers </br>  <br> Who exactly is this show pandering to? <br><br>Me.</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>As engineer I feel cringeworthy having some fucking office rat take away all their tools and equipment.<br>What are they expecting them to make? Hammers?</br></br></br></br>  <br>As an engineer, I cringe at the vague way they talk about the technology.</br>  <br>Because its a fucking anime. They can't talk about technology in detail, because authors themselves have no fucking idea.</br>  <br> because authors themselves have no fucking idea. <br><br>and even when they do it's not like the audience does so they'd have to dumb it down anyways</br></br></br>  <br>Tough love boss &gt; rei clones</br>  <br>I enjoy it, guess that means it's for me.</br>  <br>You and me brother.</br>  <br>Well at least it didn't panders to those harem or romcom. So it's okay in my book.</br>  <br>Will take in your ass.<br>Does not begin to soil the anime like you did in Hibike.<br>If you're going to start with yuribait of shit, go Bostar their delusions and hallucinations in / u /.<br>your trash miserable</br></br></br></br>  Who is this shit mc anime?<br>I still do not know who is the MC?<br>anime rotten</br></br>  <br><br>Go back to animesuki you stupid fuck</br></br>  <br>it's going to be<br><br>sensei x angelina<br>sensei imouto x nagisa<br><br>rei clone will be nagisa's half sister.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they will end up being siblings to match up with Kaito and Mizuki.</br>  <br><br>2016 Hibiki Love Story</br></br>  <br>Shit's kinda dry. I wouldn't mind so much if there was some sort of greater intrigue going on in the background.</br>  Nagisa and Angelina make a hell of a team. Oh wow. I very much look forward to seeing how A-TEC gets through this.  <br>It was quite clear the previous episode.</br>  <br><br>Will take in the ass.<br>There is no yuri this show is so delusions and hallucinations yurifag.<br>You have mints diseases, Hibike wires were all aruinados for you guys desgraçaos yurifags.<br>Forcing your tastes disgusting other users.<br>Va post your shit on / u /<br>I read the wire Hibike, you disgusting yurifag destroyed the anime<br>Do not destroy this anime as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I very much look forward to seeing how A-TEC gets through this. <br>They don't.<br>The focus on A-TEC is just a ruse. The real focus is on Nagisa vs. his brother. A-TEC people are just side characters.</br></br></br>  <br> actually shitting up the thread in the progress. <br>It's both. Them and the stupid yurifags.<br><br><br>On a separate note, I can never take Angelina's seiyuu seriously when she's trying to be serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa wants to help them though.</br>  Is it improving? Should I pick it back up?  <br>Yes, that is quite obvious.</br>  <br>nah, it sucks, and goodbye</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128242547 <br> 10k sales <br> failure </br></br>   R&amp;D guy gone <br>I'm not an engineer, but isn't this a huge blow?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128242547 <br> fem/a/nons <br>You poor, desperate fools.</br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>I'm expecting some stupid asspull to make A-TEC relevant.</br></br>  Nagisa did nothing wrong.  <br>And his brother is up to something quite wrong for sure.<br>I await to see how based Nagisa busts him and ruins him.</br></br>  <br>He didn't fuck Angelina</br>  What is this anime actually about? The first three episodes all seem like they should be from different shows; their tone and direction all seem wildly opposed to eachother.  <br>Giving thirsty hoes what they want when they demand it is how you stay beta, pleb.</br>  <br>Serious question: are you retarded?</br>  <br>You gonna answer the question?</br>  <br>Are you intoxicated?<br>High as the int'l space station?</br></br>  <br>I'll take that as a yes.</br>  <br>Don't do drugs anymore, son.</br>  <br>He's underage and she's an old lady.</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>Well his brother already tried to get him killed</br>  <br>I don't get why you people like her, I find everything except her interesting about this show. Boring quiet girls suck, bring back Subaru or PR girl in her place.</br>  <br>I mean, whatever he's cutting budgets for.</br>  <br> if a girl doesn't have super exaggerated emotions she's boring </br>  <br> her </br>  If they're bleeding so much money, then why don't they get involved in projects than can bring them so much money in the first place?  <br>because of traditions faggotry</br>  <br><br>They don't want to do stuff they don't like.</br></br>  <br> They don't want to do stuff they don't like. <br><br>this is the problem with the "Artistic freedom" mindset. Everyone has to do shit they don't like, you're not exempt</br></br></br>   Combustion Tester <br> Designer <br> Accounting/Administration <br> Materials Engineer <br> PR/Promotion <br><br>All a bunch of faggots who left. At least best girl is still here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Won't the others have to take up the slack?</br>  Isn't Hattori a boy's name? Did Angelina have some surgery?  I remember being very disappointed with episode 1 of this show, thinking that it was going to be the same old highschool kids and their wacky hijinks. I am actually really liking the direction episode 3 took, and I hope it will stay along that route.  <br>Wasn't Maruto saying something about episode 4 is where things start really picking up?</br>  <br>Well, that would make sense because of all the shit that happened in this episode. It all depends on how good their comeback from now on is.</br>  I was hoping this will be a show about space travel and life in a Martian colony<br><br>But this is just an anime about Japanese corporate culture</br></br>  <br>Salarymen who hate their bosses</br>  <br>Along those lines. Episode 4 is when you should have a clear idea of what the show is about and where it's going.<br><br>Somewhere earlier in the thread, someone clarified it.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea. I never check source material or previews etc.<br><br>I used to but I'd rather just let myself be surprised nowadays</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, considering how the japs force some high school stuff into pretty much everything, I can perfectly understand why some people are fed up with it.<br>Especially whne it has absolutely no place in a show (not really the case here).</br></br>  <br>Yes, literally.</br>  <br>Well, if somethings BL, it certainly makes yuri-sides (perceived or confirmed) somewhat less unlikely if there are female side characters. But this show is neither, there is just Fuji and /u/ bait.</br>  <br>I think it panders to people that work and know the value of money. I don't hate my boss but it did irk me when the characters would just go on about 'we need this and that' and simply demanded it as if they were entitled. <br><br>It's a good thing that the show is about them coming down from cloud 9, having been born and growing up there, and working their way back up.</br></br></br>  Why does barely anyone ever consider gravity on Mars?<br>Those guys should be either over 2 meter or walk very long low-gravity steps or both.<br>Honestly, that it's on Mars is so secondary, the setting might as well be a Bishop Ring or some other gigantic habitat.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they wear gravity shoes</br>  <br>Most science fiction is basically "normal stuff, but in space!" anyway. However, most also pay attention to some special technological/social situations. This show, so far, doesn't (which isn't bad per se, Cowboy Bepob and LotGH are the same here, but they would lose a lot of charme without the space setting).</br>  <br> fuji  <br>Fujo<br><br>Sounds impractical.</br></br></br></br>  My fucking god. Angelina and Nagisa are making it real hard for me not to drop this.<br><br>I'm going to severely disappointed once the inevitable 'happy end they don't get decommissioned' but holy shit it feels fucking glorious to see the cast get their shit pushed in hard.</br></br>  <br>Probably helps with lifting but they don't show it? Artificial gravity adding to Mars' gravity to create a comfortable 1G environment?<br>Or at worst, it's a forgotten detail.<br><br><br> going to severely disappointed <br> Yes, my autism is triggered. <br> I think I should go to sleep already, I'm tired. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it feels fucking glorious to see the cast get their shit pushed in hard <br><br>THIS</br></br></br>  <br>I like the idea of "Normal stuff, but with sci-fi tropes!", but this barely feels like it.<br><br>This might as well be taking place on Earth. The enviornment looks just like earth (which can be explained to be on purpose, but we still need to hear the explanation). Gravity is the same, length of days are the same. Had I not seen the start of the first episode, I would assume this just takes place in futuristic Akihabara or whatever.<br><br>Even the other interesting concept, of privatized cities owned by companies, is hardly explored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her family name, dumdum.</br>  <br>Mars days are 24 hours and 39 minutes.</br>  <br>That would probably still require a special time system, but fair enough, we can ignore it.<br><br>Still doesn't answer everything else.</br></br></br>  Am I fucking supposed to feel bad for them?<br>Because all I'm feeling now is absolute bliss knowing that those spoiled little fucks have finally gotten a well-deserved taste of their misgivings. <br><br>Almost eight god damn years in a shit office job having to deal with red tape, bureaucratic bullshit, and a more than corrupt executive management is making me appreciate every other character aside from the class and teacher far more than I should be.</br></br></br>   Non engineers say BE CREATIVE THAT'S ALL IT TAKES! <br><br>Yeah no fuck you guys. You can't shove people in a corner and tell them to think their way out of it when you don't know an engine from your dick.</br></br>  <br> I had to put up with shit so fictional characters in a far more complex field than I could even imagine have to as well </br>  <br>Are you saying you can't simply unlock the power of friendship to help you after strengthening your bonds with coworkers?</br>  I came in for the girls but now the guys have my attention. What the fuck?  <br>So this is "Idea Guys" vs Engineers, the anime?</br>  <br>Well Nagisa is carrying the plot</br>  All I can say for now is it is going to be a business-wars type  <br><br>he's doing nothing more than making snide remarks and foreshadowing, he may have a plan but he's a right cunt</br></br>  How would you feel about a boss like this?  <br>Indifferent. If we do our job properly and don't make stupid decisions then he won't lash out.</br>  <br><br><br>well We're also assuming he's not out to get us like he is A-tec</br></br></br>  <br>what you say is true, but in ep3 where the teacher asks for parts with the cost and nagisa exploding on him telling him that that isn't sufficient paperwork to warrant him to accept his request, shows the level of competence these people are at.<br><br>I understand that the executives of companies and accountants etc don't understand fully the complexity of engineering but then it goes both ways too. The students+teacher had to understand that money doesn't just simply grow in a garden and you have to earn it. It's a compromise or take a hike situation, and growing from this is the direction that I hope this anime will kind of go to. Undoubtedly there's the drama between the two brothers that will take precedence though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd be wholly satisfied by a boss with a work ethic like his. Of course, barring whatever power struggle he's doing in the sidelines.</br></br>  <br><br>well for whatever reason the higher ups are suddenly out to get A-tech. We don't know the reason yet but this extremely sudden shift is a bit much,<br><br>You can't pull the rug out from under your employees like this and say "HUR DUR USE YOUR HEAD" you have to give them something instead of setting them up to fail harder <br><br>right now they're just throwing shit at them till they quit on their own, which happened with a number of students and that's a right dick move</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they've already thrown science out the window with this one. I mean fuck, all the spaceships fly like airplanes. And in the first episode they just accelerate straight into a space station and crash land like a plane! They don't even do a counter burn. Couldn't they have at least played KSP for like 5 minutes before making this shit?<br><br>I mean fuck, if they want to pander to engineers they need to get their science together<br><br><br> &gt;Artificial gravity adding to Mars' gravity to create a comfortable 1G environment? <br>if you can manipulate gravity, then you don't need whatever engine they're supposed to be developing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty good, I had similar one and there was no problem with pay, vacations, breaks or anything. <br>Then he changed the place and was replaced with more irresponsible boss who didn't have enough authority to keep the shit together, which lead to the slackers not doing their job properly. That only leads to bad atmosphere and you're surrounded by Tarous who can make your job a lot harder because the boss doesn't care.</br></br>  <br>Feels pretty good.</br>  <br>Capitalist master race</br>  <br>Because he went for a drink and a whine once he is now a useless alcoholic?</br>  <br>True, and which was hinted that its the older brother embezzling the funds for unknown reasons.<br><br>It's a fact A-tech's budget has been cut, and nobody can do anything about it. Although it is also a fact that Nagisa and Angelina are giving the class tough love but both of them don't want A-tech to fail. So yeah, the higher ups are dicks for sure, but I suppose I find the plot convenience of - the class left to their own tools and make the best of it due unbeknownst to them that corruption from the top, on the facade of budget cuts and how someone is out to expose the truth while at the same time covertly helping the class 'grow' as a team - interesting. Hey shit this might not even be the plot at all, but in my head its something like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's interesting, the heroes need adversity to overcome of course. I just don't see how people can take the "business" side when previously spoiled or not they're being dicked with pretty hard. It's not like they really flaunted or where assholes either. Hell the one thing we see them do is risk their own necks to save someone who ended up being a cock</br></br>  <br>...best of it unbeknownst to them that its*<br><br>I should stop posting now.</br></br></br>  <br>There's also the mystery of where the money goes, it clearly has something to do with Nagisa's brother.</br>  <br>Then fuck them. We'll see who's the real "master race" when every last capitalist is hanging from a bridge.</br>  <br>I personally find it hard to like with the so-called 'heroes' though. In fact, I absolutely loathe Sensei's character.</br>  <br><br>safe money is one secret weapons project.<br><br>I don't want to say Metal Gear buuuuuuuuuut</br></br></br></br>  <br> I absolutely loathe Sensei's character. <br><br>Why? Because he's excited about his job and wants to build his dream? Wow, What a bastard. How dare he give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is that? I think Sensei has a lot of good points in his passion and drive as well as a lot of room for growth and to get himself together</br>  <br><br>Like I said, it's a personal reason. I'm not in a shitposty enough mood to blog and rant about it right now so just write it off as a disgruntled anon's shitty opinion.</br></br>  <br>Seconded.<br><br>I think the same can be said for the students that decided to stay. While I may not fully be able to grasp the situation the class is in I find it hard to believe that their situation was 'over'. Dire, but it ain't over surely. I like to think it was some convenient screening process from Nagisa and Angelina that, on top of fulfilling the quota of budget cuts, also weeded out the weak willed so that the ones who stay really deserve to be there.</br></br></br>  <br><br>see if you're not gonna bother to explain than Im just gonna assume you a cunt because from what we've seen you're hating on pretty decent people for no reason beyond having a bug up your but</br></br>  <br><br>you don't find out who's worthy by antagonizing your help. That's asinine. You don't find the best people that you that's how you find who can put up with the most garbage. The fact that they're even in that school is already proof of their talent, the kids who left will have new jobs by the end of the day.</br></br>  <br> the kids who left will have new jobs by the end of the day <br>Not even that long, even as they walked out they said they already had other job offers they were walking in to.</br></br>  <br>Except combustion tester who was constantly worried where he can go now</br>  <br><br>yeah but I figured a few of them may stop for lunch first, probably take the rest of the day off. you don't want to go into a job interview pissed</br></br>  <br>I did mention tough love, I don't think that's the same as antagonizing but ymmv.<br><br>Also, pretty sure their class is special even by the academy's standard.<br><br>As for the kids that will have new jobs, I can loosely connect it to my statement of people that deserve to be there, may also want to be there. Theoretically speaking if another company offered better accommodations than A-tech without budget cuts would they have left anyway? This part though is just my own subjective perception though</br></br></br></br></br>  B is incest, C is yshit.<br><br>Pattern A is the answer. You know it's true.</br></br>  <br>Do really people care about shipping in this show<br>If there was some romance to come I'd like it to be between Kaito and Angelina because they're same age and Angelina can whip him to proper shape.</br></br>  <br> mfw sensei and nagisa have the same haircut </br>  <br>Nagisa has no choice over the matter that A-tech's budget has been reduced to 1/3. I don't think he's antagonizing them on purpose.</br>  <br> Theoretically speaking if another company offered better accommodations than A-tech without budget cuts would they have left anyway? <br><br>You don't test loyality by treating your employees like shit. You can rationalize it all you want but if a company isn't going to be loyal to the employees why should the employees stay loyal.<br><br>Of course they're gonna leave you rube. They went from the top to literally kicked out of the building in a day. That's not tough love that's outright disloyalty</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>C is the only one with any good chemistry and contact record so far. So by Occam's Razor, C is likelier until we see more chemistry between the males and females.</br>  <br>This show won't have any romance, you ape. Maruto personally apologized on the official twitter that romance is out the window, because for once in his miserable work life of pleasing the otaku crowd, he wanted to do something different than all the fapgames he's done before. This is gonna be pure corporate drama, so shippershits should of all stripes should fuck right off.</br>  <br>Well it is true that the older brother guy wants A-tech gone and he's being a real cunt about it for sure.<br><br>But from Nagisa's perspective  what would you have him do? I was subjectively trying to connect the convenience of the plot to his actions on episode 3 that is all.</br></br></br>  <br> no official romance <br> Option C will never be invalidated <br>Feels good.</br></br></br>  <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/<br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/anywherebuthere/</br></br></br>  <br>Jokes on you, I fly with the /y/.</br>  <br>What's wrong with incest?</br>  <br>Go write your slash fanfiction elsewhere, you cancerous faggot</br>  <br> Do really people care about shipping in this show <br>This. It's fucking stupid but /a/ will ship every character who look at each other in the eyes and treat it like it's the most important thing in the show.</br></br>  <br> Maruto personally apologized on the official twitter that romance is out the window, <br><br><br>Source</br></br></br></br>   has to become a male prostitute now <br><br>doujin when?</br></br>  <br>https://twitter.com/clcr_project/st<wbr>atus/617025200270413824</wbr></br>  <br>Seems more like he's saying the series won't be a romcom. Not that there won't be romance in it period. Either way I'm liking it so far so the romance isn't even needed.</br>  <br>You can bet your ass there won't be any romance. Screencap this.</br>  <br>Not so smug anymore</br>  <br> Classroom <br> Crisis <br>C all the way</br></br></br>  <br> C is the only one with any good chemistry and contact record so far. <br>This. It's the only way it makes sense regardless of who's a guy or a girl.</br></br>  <br>tumblr pls</br>  <br>Fuck, and I wanted a yurish romcom.</br>  <br> implying he can go against director's wish </br>  <br>If anything it should be his wish to write romcom since romance is all he has written so far. Meanwhile Nagasaki has done a sci-fi LN adaptation with gay ending and toy robot commercial with some romcom.</br>  <br><br>This. I love Angelina and Corporate L-Elf. I hope they triumph by whipping these idiots into shape and defeat corrupted Niisan.</br></br>  <br> if you can manipulate gravity, then you don't need whatever engine they're supposed to be developing <br>Maybe space magic that doesn't work with ships.<br>Didn't they have something like this in Firefly?</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br>evil Kyouske gonna get befriended and learn what dreams mean</br></br>  <br><br> well-deserved taste of their misgivings. <br><br>If those "idiots" were as useless as you thing you yourself are, then they wouldn't have to sabotage them like that. Why are you so bitter against talented people?<br><br>The only thing A-TEC needs is somebody controlling them so they don't crash any prototypes into asteroids again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can still have some slight subtext.<br>That's not really romance.</br></br>  <br>Angelina will end up with Sensei because they have a bickering relationship. That always ends in fucking.<br><br>I'll give you Sensei Sister and Nagisa, that's likely to happen because it's Genki+Brooding guy, another cliche couple.</br></br></br>  <br>I choose the best option, D: nothing beyond some subtext. Nothing.</br>  <br> No more smug boy </br>  <br> If those "idiots" were as useless as you thing you yourself are, then they wouldn't have to sabotage them like that. <br><br>They are idiots in the sense they had no idea of the real world. I have nothing against talented people, they just needed to learn the hard way to work hard and be aware of money.<br><br>The duo will make them tougher so they can unmask evil niisan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't say that they're useless, he said that they're spoiled little fucks.<br>Which is arguably true.<br>That's why they need punishment and discipline.</br></br></br>  How old is Nagisa? Is he a precocious corporate genius?  <br> it should be his wish to do X since it is all he has done so far <br>That line of thinking only leads down to being stuck with a shit job for the rest of your life.</br></br>  <br>300 years. because future tech.</br>  <br>But he said he couldn't drink because he's underage and he's still attending to high school.</br>  Anyone else who prefers interstellar settings over intrasolar ones?<br>That way you can avoid things already pointed out more easily, like Mars gravity.

They knew damn well what they were doing from the start.</br></br>  <br>[muffled sounds of best girl winning]</br>  <br>I find it hilarious that Haruto, in his berserk rape stupor, still bothered to completely remove his pants and shoes.</br>  <br><br>I'd do the same<br>better enjoy that prime pussy naked</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sLI<wbr>QrFY3fUk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> &gt;it's been 2 years since valvrave aired <br>Why do you feel compelled to point this out to us?</br></br>  Valvare had potential, even though it ended as an entertaning trainwreak.<br><br>I feel that even though the setting was crazy, the gambits in general were simple (not enough mcgiver erufu hijinks)and the characters mostly undeveloped. they played much too safe. Maybe 20 minutes 13x2 episodes was too little.</br></br>  <br>EVOL was entertaining, unlike most of those other shows</br>  <br> there are actually people who think anything on here is worse than AO </br>  <br><br>Aquarion EVOL<br><br>The themes in that were all kinds of fucked up and I still have a bad taste in my mouth after it.</br></br></br></br>  Patiently waiting for the next Geass/Valvrave, it's always the most fun to watch with /a/.<br>Aldnoah turned out boring as fuck, but then again it wasn't by based Sunrise.<br>Then gg can come back and sub it ;_;</br></br>  <br>Right; I meant that when they were writing it they decided it was so shit that they were going to re-write it on crazy pills.</br>  <br>Valvrave probably would have done better if it were longer</br>  <br>You missed Cross Ange?</br>  <br>Sacred 7</br>  <br>cross ange and g-rekto. dis-honourable mention: valvrave</br>  <br> Valvrave <br>Was absoultely retarded and dull when it didn't throw an outrageous asspull out of the left field at the audience.<br> Cross Ange <br>About as funny as watching kids talk about poop and piss.<br> Aldnoah Zero <br>The absolute winner. A gigantic pissing contest between two boys that got cucked in the end. Nothing happens, no one die and Inkofags are the delusion champions.<br> G-Reco <br>A bit of everything. Bad, mediocre, decent, good.<br> GBF Try <br>Meh. Fapfapfpa. Meh.<br> Nobunaga the Fool <br>Was absolutely awful whenever the mecha were around.

How is this even a contest?</br>  So is Valverave worth watching now or was it only good due to /a/ like Guilty Crown?  <br>It's worth watching for the same reasons that SEED and CG are.</br>  <br>So it's a masterpiece?</br>  <br>vlvshit doesnt has god tier visuals and music like Crown. In fact /a/ hipsters are still salty because vlvshit was nowhere near as successful as it.</br>  <br> anything by Sunrise <br> hipsters <br>u w8 m8</br></br></br>  <br>It's just the same old VVV shitposter</br>  <br>Openings are great, show not so much.</br>  I really liked the visuals, especially that hard light thing in space. Russia/Deutschland fan service was a nice touch too.  The worst 2 shows of the last 4 years were objectively Captain Earth and Sacred Seven.  <br>I managed to complete GC at least.</br>  <br>Haruto was a terrible protagonist and should have died in ep 1.</br>  <br>Haruto was a terrible protagonist and shouldn't have made it past the planning board.</br>  <br>He really shouldn't have. He is basically everything a protagonist should never be: incompetent, unlikable, gutless, never grows or changes, ineffective, and completely useless.</br>  <br>I hate animations where the main protagonist doesn't have balls. It's an Action/Mecha. Enough with all the poorly created, shit-hole characters. I've watched way too many action animes where the main character is "Oh I'm so weak and lame, and I'm going to cry 90% of the time." Pathetic, I want more animes with main characters that have guts already.</br>  <br>Nothing was worse than this</br>  These threads are how I decide what mecha anime I watch.  <br><br/></br>  <br>I only see people talking about shit mecha in here though.</br>  <br>Have there even been any good mecha anime in the last few years though?</br>  on subject of questionable mecha shows<br><br>what the heck was M3 all about in the end?<br><br>I still don't get it</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>On paper, Haruto has a lot of similarities to Tekkaman Blade's D-boy.<br><br>S1 Haruto was somewhat tolerable (I still prefer the edgy "You killed my waifu, now I'm gonna obliterate your whole world Dorssia!") but S2 Haruto was given shit after shit with little to no breaks in between. He's wavering on a different aspect of his curse but the pacing of S2 makes it appear like he doesn't have enough resolve to things he had committed before.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is my manga collection.  I'm usually not really into "realistic" anime/manga. But this shit is great. Can we have a thread about it?  Go spend your time reading Planetes instead.  <br>Already watched it and read it. I liked Planetes, but his anachronistic views on post-industrialism made me cringe somewhat.</br>  <br>by his I meant the author's.</br>  <br>I don't think I've ever heard anybody describe it anachronistic and while I can probably think of some examples, what in particular actually bothers you?</br>  Dat foreshadowing.  <br>There's more OP. Broken windows in the middle of the episode, Mi-whatever yelling while entering classroom or that fucking cross on the roof.</br>  <br>I actually wrote a list of all the things I noticed in the other thread, but it got deleted by the mods.<br>The barricades are another huge red flag.</br></br>  <br>can you find it?</br>  I'm happy I went into this show completely blind honestly. Makes it more interesting when it takes that turn.    <br>is this going to be a read-the-manga type of anime?</br>        <br>I don't see it.</br>  If Yuki always see her surrounding with her delusion mode, why she saw the "ghost" ?  <br>Didn't even notice those zombies.</br>  it's saying there's malicious code in my screenshots.  Is the dog real? They can't actually have dog food, right?  Shovel sucks zombie dicks.  <br>are you asking for spoilers? Because that's how you get spoilers.</br>  <br> All is in the darkness in the past <br> Please don't throw me away <br> Help me <br><br>That's brutal. How metal is this show?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>above the bottom right desk</br></br>  <br>Because she's not batshit insane, just in denial. Her own mind wont allow her to put herself in danger.  That's why Megu-nee took her away and protected her. </br>  <br>watch it and find out for yourself faggot, it's only been 2 episodes so far</br>  <br>It's got Narutaru syndrome.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I'm not seeing any of these.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i know what you're doing. now stop</br>  <br>The dog is real. Otherwise, Mii-kun wouldn't feel so down when he ignores her.</br>  <br>seeing what?<br><br> tfw they realise "can you find it?" was referring to the list  made <br><br>I'm just posting apocalypse signs</br></br></br></br></br>    How different is the anime from the manga? From what I've seen of the anime it looks like some characters were introduced way early/ out of order. Did garter belt chick show up before or after the dog?  <br>almost done</br>  i'm missing one  <br>Miki shows up on volume 2, the dog  shows up only for a chapter in a flashback then dies. </br>    the whole "I wanted to go home" is a big flag too  <br>The whole scene with the dog is anime-original, since the dog becomes a zombie that Megu-nee eventually killed or something like that a while back. Mii-kun isn't supposed to come in for another episode or two (she's still living in the mall during the test of courage, and they find her during a "field trip"), so she's added into scenes that only had Rii, Kurumi, and Yuki in the original. So it's basically different.</br>  <br>The anime chronology doesn't even make sense now that I think about it, since they went in the field trip because going to the school store wasn't cutting it anymore, but then they go to the store in the test of courage with Mii-kun.</br>  please, someone make a stretch of this  <br>Aya is Mega Man. She defeated Shovel Knight and acquired the Spade Sword. She splattered enough zombies to get the Zombie Arm. She salvaged the Bullet Caster but Miki threw it away. What power up will she find next? Crossbow? Metal Blade?</br>  Punished Mii is a best.  <br> Infectious bite. </br>  <br>They just need to make up another reason for going to the mall, anon. It's not that much of an issue, and since the author is in charge of the series composition, I wouldn't worry too much.</br>  Why is Mii-kun so sexual?  <br>Because boys are the best</br>  <br>She's trying to please her girlfriend</br>  Copypasta from the other thread<br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>From the third link<br> Alternatively, widespread infection may lead to mutation, and different versions may appear <br><br> Also reminder that mutation in the context of widespread infection might also imply immunity to vaccines. <br><br> ÜberShovel when? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to flirt with Miki in English and hear her grammatically correct but awkwardly pronounced replies.    What I'm gathering from this thread is that it's decided that Miki is best girl?  <br>Of course</br>  <br>No, shovel's name is Kurumi</br>  There's the fact that the chair at choker-chan's desk is tucked under and we don't see her legs, until Yuki imagines her sitting there a bit later on  <br>This is the next scene.</br>    <br>Don't cry for her. She's already dead.</br>  <br>Well wtf did you all expect. We can't have a cute show about high school girls with an old hag in it.</br>  So are we going to have an anime original ending?  <br>What makes you think that? It'll probably end with the graduation.</br>  <br>If they do I hope the writer deliberately gives it a tonally opposite ending from the manga, whether it's a sad ending or a happy ending. It'll be like two alternate endings, both canon.</br>  Jesus christ, watched the first episode expecting SoL, received tragic zombie drama.  <br>Were you away from /a/ for the last 2 weeks or something?</br>  Now we know why  helicopter-kun gave up   <br><br> girl </br></br>  <br>kek</br>  I thought this was Gochiusa type stuff from the name and art, should I pick it up?  <br>  I thought this was Gochiusa type stuff  <br><br>Holy shit it isn't. The story revolves around a bunch of battle-hardened moeblobs trying to protect the smile of a crazed, hallucinating moeblob in a post-apocalyptic zombie world with dwindling supplies and equipment.<br><br>It's obvious that things are going to end very very badly from the onset. Either everyone, or almost everyone (everyone dies but pink) is gonna die at some point, and there's nothing they can do about it.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kei-chan kawaii!</br>  I'm a filthy casual who rarely goes into this board, but I just fell in love with this show. I thought I'd seen just about everything that anyone could do with the "zombie apocalypse" genre, but I was wrong.  I'm pretty sure that one chick who was huddling with the protagonist in the library and giving her advice is one of the figments.  This is my first time watching an anime as an airs, so, uhhh.. does Japan do hiatuses?  <br>That end though. I watched it with some friends because they wanted me to see it and I honestly expected it be shit but that end tho. It was so worth suffering through 18 minutes of suger sweet loli garbage. Really interested to see how this plays out</br>  <br><br> does Japan do hiatuses? <br><br>Not really, though it will only be 12-13 episodes. Also spoilers everywhere, so stick around at your own risk. Or you could go and read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br> casual <br><br> friends <br>Read the manga</br></br></br></br>  REMOVE DOG  <br>Taroumaru!</br>  <br><br>Dog  a best </br></br>  <br> friends <br>Yea I have those. We get together once a week and watch anime for most of the day. Pretty fun<br>Also I'm gonna hold off on the manga since I don't anything spoiled</br></br></br>  Yuuri a shit.  <br>Well o-okay have fun then.<br> Do not open legit spoiler </br></br>  <br><br> Do not open </br></br>  https://soundcloud.com/prodigisedm/<wbr>loli-zombie-loops<br><br><br>Fuck you, /a/.<br>Fuck you for getting me into this shit.<br><br> Now take my shitty present. </br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Yeah, I get that most shows are one story=one season. What's important to me is that I don't have to wait more than a week in-between chapters.</br>  <br>hold up, im sorry, but seriously why the fuck did he just crash himself instead of doing anything remotely helpful?</br>  <br><br>So, ya think anime Taroumaru is already  infected ?</br></br>  <br> He saw the school overrun and was stricken with grief   he crushed the photo and vial out of anger . He uses a 21 ton exit strategy.<br> Serum doesn't work. He mutated to retard strength   he didn't mean to crush the photo or the vial prolly . Loses control of his body.<br>And hey, he was super useful. He got them to move out gave the girls a 9mm handgun.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Only having watched one episode so far, I let my mind imagine the meaning of this scene.  Now we know where the meat for the spaghetti came from and why imaginary dog is afraid of her. </br></br>  <br>This the same store that was selling blue ribbons for 500 yen?</br>  There's also another thread up<br/>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I like that you came to that conclusion. You should write manga.</br>  <br><br>That thread is gonna hit reply limit soon anyway</br></br>  Well, anons, should I read the manga or watch as things unfold in the anime?<br><br><br>I'm surprised this is popular enough to be used to sell water bottles. How does the water relate to the show/manga, though? There doesn't seem to be any sort of label. I'm also curious as to what the sign says.</br></br></br>  <br>holy fuck, how did I not notice that</br>  <br>Manga</br>  <br>I understand hestia ribbons, but what the fuck do bottles have to do with Yuki</br>  <br>It's zombification protection holy water</br>    W-what are you going to do?  <br>They taste like survival.</br>    <br>I'm hungry, but<br><br>I'M HUNGRY, BUT</br></br></br>  <br>Marry</br>  <br>Genuflect</br>  <br>so I watched both episodes and I don't know if I want to continue. Feels like it will be depressing.</br>    <br>Lick the rear of them thighs.</br>  why are all the windows broken  <br><br> Gurashiiiiiiiiiiis </br></br>  <br>Because of delinquents.

I thought this show was going to be about zombies. It's just about some girls living at school. Typical main girl and everything slice of life that came up with an excuse not to animate homes or parents.<br><br> Seriously what sort of school lets a girl keep her dog at school? <br><br> It's like some crazy girl's imagination or something. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is always a story about the school that has been destroyed by delinquency, it is the job of the school club to help in securing the school</br>  <br>Don't fall for it.

Why are ALL the windows broken?<br>There doesn't seem to be a single intact pane in the entire school.<br>There are windows where broken shards have tape on them, as is to try and hold them to other shards to create a full pane, but who the hell would bother trying to tape up a couple of shards when EVERY window is broken.</br></br></br>    <br>Not only are the windows broken, but if you pay attention the walls are cracked and falling apart. When they cleared the zombies out of the top few floors they must have used some heavy weaponry.</br>  Why is glasses  the best girl?   <br>Purely for atmosphere.<br><br>Same reason for doorways 'boarded up' with just one or two planks.<br><br>And those desk barricades are sketchy as hell.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A mutated Kurumi chasing Yuki and Miki <br> It also carries a shovel launcher </br></br>  <br>A distant powerful explosion in the initial chaos is my guess.</br>  <br>That ain't jean shorts</br>  https://twitter.com/Battlefield/sta<wbr>tus/622194241226280960</wbr>    <br> Purely for atmosphere. <br>Yeah that's obviously the reason, but I think they kinda went a bit overboard.<br>There's rubble in places that shouldn't have had any structural damage, there's broken glass that shouldn't be reachable, and some which would be terribly difficult to break into shards like they are (main mall doors).<br><br>I guess it's fine for a once-a-month manga where you need the art to drag everyone back into the setting, but logically looking at it, it looks forced.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>      Little girl is a lie.<br>Kill them all with fire</br>  Why is Kurumi   a best?    <br>Because you are a necrophile.</br>  <br><br>But she is not anon<br>see </br></br></br>   Dat foreshadowing. <br><br>ITT: People 2 weeks late</br></br>  <br>well, fuck.

After use, they throw them out of the window at zombies.</br>  <br>Why would it? There's been no signs they are attracted to blood</br>  <br>Why bother? All that time spent trimming could be used for sharpening shovel blades or building a radio transmitter out of car stereos and VCRs. Gotta have priorities.</br>  <br>Wait, how do they deal with garbage in general? There's no garbage man to come and take it away.</br>  <br><br><br>Yes, very cool. I like a lot of the in-store displays and stuff that have been posted. There must be one selling shovels somewhere. I would buy a shovel from Kurumi-chan for sure.<br><br><br><br>No shit? I have always heard that hair and nails continue to grow, but didn't realize this was why they only appear to. Interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There isn't any pads for girls period at the shops in high school in Japan....<br>3DPD Japanese girls are bitch but shy. They won't buy such a goods in their school</br></br>  Clementine will remember that.  <br><br>I say no. Bodily function has ceased, no beating heart, no pumping blood, etc. <br><br>They might leak a bit of fluid here and there.</br></br></br></br>  The beginning of the ED song sounds so familiar to another ED from another anime but I don't remember where I heard it from. It's been bothering me for the past days.  <br>All they have to do is to throw them out of the window.<br>We, zombies are willing to eat them which has heroin's smell.</br></br>  <br><br>What happens if they have their first one at school? They must have a dispenser machine in the girls bathroom, or keep a bunch in the nurse's office maybe</br></br>  <br>I'm assuming they picked up as much as they could get back at the mall, and the nurses might of had some</br>  <br>They've probably go an empty room they throw everything in and close the door.<br><br>What I want to know is if Miki had a toilet or not at the mall. It looked she lived in a big storage closet or something. But she did have a sink, so I have to assume assume she did have a toilet. I don't really understand what sort of room she was in.</br></br></br>  <br><br>B R A V O<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gggguuuuuhhhhhh... C-cunt blooooood.... so hungry.</br></br>  I love you Iori.<br>I love you.</br>  <br>If girls have their first one when they're in school.<br>They run into the infirmary and get some pads and hear how to use it from women teacher.</br></br>  What did Kurumi said to Miki /GG/?  Who cleaned up  Megu-nee when Miki finished her off?   <br><br>Where is this from? Which chapter?</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>They probably left her there.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>hmm I see.<br>BTW Why you know the story of the mall?<br>Is the comics of School Live sold in overseas?</br></br></br>    Were they dating? Way to tear my heart out.  <br><br>No anon. We get people in Japan to scan Japanese copies and then we translate into English.<br><br>Basically we all read pirated copies. I would buy it if it were available. And actually a lot of us do purchase and import manga from Japan for series we like. I plan to for GG</br></br></br></br>  <br>The manga is translated by some groups on the internet<br/></br>  <br>As long as that company doesn't send someone like him after the girls for reasons, yes.</br>  <br>Not yet in English, though starting in November it will be.</br>  <br>Don't worry she would rebound to me over you.</br>  <br><br>Hey it's the creepy teacher from Punchline, right? Kurumi would make short work of him.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks !</br></br>  <br>This is why you invest in a safety razor. Upfront cost is 40 bucks for a good brush and handle. Add on a jar of soap that smells of sandalwood for 15 dollars that seems to last indefinitely. Steal a cup from your kitchen. And finally 20 bucks for a hundred two sided Japanese stainless steel Feather razor blade. You'll be smiling into the apocalypse with a nice, clean shaven smile.</br>  <br>But you don't normally carry razors with you, and who is ever at home when the zombie apocalypse hits? Aside from Shaun.</br>    WTF my friend in Akihabara sent me this photo!<br><br>A famous shop in Akihabara sells the holy water which can prevent people from being zombie!</br></br>  <br>That's not even in the manga. They should've sold shovels.</br>  <br>truly the japanese are slant eyed jews</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>hmm...but people in Akihabara is like zombies.<br>so They don't have to shovels.<br>They should be rather afraid of her shovel.</br></br></br>  <br> That aliasing <br>Shoulda used Waifux2</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what you're trying to say.</br>  <br><br>I follow I think. Like the people are zombie-like, so they fear the shovel, and thus they wouldn't sell?</br></br>  <br>I forgot to say "have"<br>so They don't have to have shovel<br>They are in zombie's side.</br></br></br>    <br>yes yes ^^</br>  Does anyone like Rii-san?  <br><br>Fuck you anon. Fuck you. Now I'll never get to sleep with that damned song echoing through my brain over and over.</br></br>  <br>Two or three anons do.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>She's my least favorite, but the poor girl needs love too, before she snaps. Incidentally the anime has made me warm up to her a little.</br>  <br><br>Some people do. She's worst girl in my opinion. But some anons seem to favor her. Mostly I think they like her big tits and fat ass. Lots of talk about forcing her to carry children in old threads.</br></br>  <br>One or two anons do.<br>almost all anons are Loli-com</br></br>  <br>There's this dude who fantasizes about whiteknighting her and keeps arguing here that she's okay and not a problem in the group at all in her current state</br>  <br>Does anyone like Slutrumi?</br>  <br><br>Shhh anon you might summon him. He never stops posting his insane shit once he starts.</br></br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth. Go die in a fire.</br>    Hello maintenance, something is broken here can you fix it  <br>I'm just stating what is canon. Go complain to the mangaka for writing a slut character.</br>  What could it mean? Rii is kill?  <br><br>Sure anon</br></br>  <br>No, Anon  it means you are kill </br>  <br>This is just a magnet</br>  <br>It looked to me like some sort of office for a live-in Janitor. So some kind of duo supply closet/mini-apartment, which is why it had lots of supplies but also a bed/sink/toilet/etc. Was probably used as a general storehouse for the mall survivors too, which is likely why she had enough food and water.</br>  <br>Doge is kill and  yuki isn't real </br>  <br>What shop was that? Didn't see it when I was there a few days ago. I'll have to go find it when I go back tomorrow.</br>    <br><br>Ok, I'm gonna stop doing this shit now</br></br>  <br>If you want a practical reason<br> it's Japan, and not unheard of to get nasty ass storms <br> general chaos from zombies like people breaking windows to jump out, missing targets, zombies breaking shit because these seem to be mostly hearing based zombies </br></br></br>  <br>even if they were to have some sort of generator problem with their solar powered school which would definitely have showers,<br><br>have you never heard of a sponge bath?</br></br></br>  <br>Please fix Ruu.</br>  <br>They're all 16-18, they definitely have hair<br><br>I really doubt their priorities are shaving their vaginas. They wouldn't even have a reason to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>I assumed it was some kind of janitor's/employees closet, it's not unheard of for them to have a largish private room with a toilet.</br>  <br> They wouldn't even have a reason to do so. <br>Except to be hygienic. Just because there's no chance of you getting plowed in the butt by anyone ever doesn't mean you can't keep your shit together.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't worry about it.</br>  <br> Just because there's no chance of you getting plowed in the butt by anyone ever <br>Well, in their situation, there's plenty of chances of them getting plowed in the butt, especially now they've come in contact with armed survivors.</br></br>    <br>They're armed also. They have that pisto lthey found in chopper-kun's briefcase</br>  <br>You mean the one Miki tossed?</br>  <br>I knew people from Akiba were unusually lifeless.</br>  <br>Yes, the one that Rii totally picked up.</br>    <br>She's probably too useless for that.</br>  <br>I mean there's interior windows broken that are out of zombie reach (small windows above interior doors).<br>Kurumi's house has chunks taken out of the brick fence, both entrance windows damaged, apparent rocks or other rubble outside her room, but her nameplate is still happily hanging there. Inside her room which apparently has been untouched since the event, there are bookcases and books with dings and marks as is they've been sitting outside for a few months.<br>Further on when they're at the gas station, there's a shot of the city, and there are building with massive multi-storey cracks in the walls.<br><br>I know the easy was to show dilapidation and neglect is to break windows, ding, dent, and dirty things, and have concrete cracking, but if you were to add it all up, it's almost as if it's either an active military warzone with missiles and gunfire, or otherwise abandoned for a hundred years.<br><br>Still I'm happy to accept it as artistic licence, it just kinda comes off a bit thick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the sexiest body/face wise and I have a soft spot for onee-san's who try to shoulder the burden. I don't normally like the token cow tit, but hers are reasonable and not ridiculous.<br>Best Personal "flair"(i.e garters) and hair goes to Miki<br>Kurumi has the best personality and style<br><br>Yuki is pretty shit in comparison to the others, but her design is better than Megu-nee's, but worse than the others partially because of the token pink haired loli aspect. I'll like her more when she becomes less of a liability and more of a happy voice of self-aware reason when the others aren't handling things well as it's been mostly just her making up a new "game" or something which is all fine and dandy, but not every/the majority of situation.<br><br>Miki=Kurumi&gt;Rii&gt;Kei=Yuki&gt;&gt;Megu-nee</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm confident that the curtains match the carpet in all cases.<br><br><br>Yuki probably can't grow much more than a little peach fuzz despite being a grown woman. Shovel and Rii would have some. Rii would trim it neatly, and shovel would be a little wilder. Miki is the most likely to shave, but with the apocalypse making that more difficult, she might fall back to trimming it short.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with hygiene.</br>  <br><br>Isn't it romanized daijobuu?</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's the omega strain.</br>  <br>why are they glowing</br>  <br>It's actually more hygienic not to shave, the hair helps to protect the vagina and urinary tract from infection via dirt and general nasty things.<br>It's not more hygienic, it just arguably looks nicer(my preference), no sticking out hair in a swimsuit, doesn't leave hair in your mouth during oral, and isn't an issue if you're not poor or in unsanitary conditions.<br>lrn2basic body health.<br> Also in grown hairs and cuts can become infected and cause big problems in their situation.<br><br>And again, theirs literally no good reason for them to shave.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're cute girls.</br>  <br>Punished Miki doesn't need a gun she's confident in her CQB skills</br>  <br>I don't know what the joke is or why you repost it several times in every thread.</br>  <br>nVidia Lightworks™ brings your anime closer to life with real time ray trace scattering by leveraging the power of delusional highschool girls and shovels.

Threw it out the window.</br>  <br>This is the most horrifying picture in this thread.</br>  This show isn't comfy at all.  <br>What are you, some sort of normie?</br>  <br>dispair</br>  So this is why Rii kept asking Yuki if she hears anything in the elementary school. She got a sixth sense to detect life forms.  <br>Let's hope she didn't have to deal with diarrhea.</br>  <br> It's okay, they are just chatting somewhere <br> THERE IS NO TIME TO BE PRETENDING TO BE RETARDED RIGHT NOW </br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's hilarious.</br>  <br>All the healing without any of the sleep-providing comfy, for anons needing quick healing in the middle of a long "work" day.</br>  <br>Diejoubu</br>  The one thing that always bugs me about zombie stories like this is how the survivors are always worrying about supplies like food and water and yet the zombies never seem to need any of that shit. Even assuming they knew how to operate faucets and whatnot for water (if they didn't they'd all be dead in less than a week), they can seemingly go for weeks at a time without eating anything (not even each other) without so much as slowing down. ATP doesn't just make itself; they've got to be getting all that energy to shamble around from somewhere.<br><br>I know that would ruin the entire setting, but I still get taken out of a world when people are all "oh shit we only have a week of supplies left and those zombies are somehow still out there after months." At least this story somewhat gives an explanation with the whole "maybe they remember their past lives" thing.<br><br> Although I haven't read the manga, so maybe it is explained, at least indirectly, I dunno </br></br></br></br>  So why do people change appearance when they become zombies?  Gakkou Gurashi or School Live?  <br> The more I read this manga, the more I'm expecting each of the Gakkous to be test subjects who are closely monitored, and each one seems to have a different trial being put on them. Yuki seems like she can detect others who are alive, Kurumi's combat skills are insanely powerful, Yuuri's protectiveness is so powerful that a lack of things to put it on drives her mad, and Miki's a phenomenally quick learner. This little party could go places in an apocalypse like this.  </br>  <br>Living at the School</br>  <br>calling it Gakkou makes it harder for rnormies to get into so that</br>    <br>Dying at school<br><br>Zombies don't need no energy conservation</br></br></br>  <br>Because if zombies had their present mental state, but the same degree of needed consumption as regular humans, a zombie apocalypse would be over in a week at the absolute longest.</br>    <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr><br>ENOUGHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></wbr></br>  <br>Big Boss Miki shoop when?</br>  <br>Why is her armpit on fire?</br>  <br>So Kurumi can extinguish it with her tongue and saliva.</br>  <br>She's my favorite. I don't usually like the "onee-san"-type characters because they're often too perfect and infallible, but I really emphasize with her conflict and personal problems. She has the best character design too.</br>    Yo, I'm dumb as fuck, so 36 is out? Where can I find it, sorry for being a flid.  I'm buying a Kurumi figure as soon as one releases  <br> mfw the only thing we'll get is Yuki <br> it's a nendoroid </br></br>  <br>Try actually reading the thread</br>  <br>Read this very fucking thread, you KS shitter.</br>  <br> Yo, I'm dumb as fuck, <br>At least you are self-aware.</br></br>  I need MORE Kurumi crops   Kaisha Gurashi! <br><br>Spinoff of cute salarymen doing cute salarymen survival things when?</br></br>  <br>Not a solo crop, but I still really like it</br>  <br> cute salarymen <br>You mean OLs, right?</br></br>  <br>Why is Kurumi so fucking boner inducing?</br>  How did that one zombie get to the 3rd floor?  <br>Because she is wearing pantyhose.</br>  <br>horror section of the library.jpg</br>  Yuki is for having fun pretending to be delusional with her.<br>Kurumi is for bro'ing around gardening tools for zombie-killing.<br>Yuuri is for bitchslapping back to genjitsu.<br>Miki is for tender loving sex and childbearing.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the plot demanded it.</br>  <br>She never left</br>  <br>fingerless gloves<br>twintails</br></br>  <br> Old hags <br><br>No, no I do not. Are you trying to imply middle-aged salarymen aren't moe?</br></br></br>  <br>She's part zombie, so she'd try to ravage your dick</br>  <br>You mean the one after the fire? Cause the barricades would have been gone then.<br><br>What really bugs me is where did all the zombies come from when they went to the bathroom at night? Or do they have to cross the barricade every time they have to go? Seems like the bathroom would be one of the first places you'd try to secure, after the sleeping and cooking areas.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the explosion made it fly into the building. It's very weak after all. Or it was lurking there all the time, but they missed it because it wasn't standing up and kept the door closed, since Yuki was mainly raving on the second floor, they pretty much skipped the third and every time they went for the roof.</br>   According to the July 18 report by Hon no Hikidashi, the official news site owned by Nippan/Nippon Shuppan Hanbai, one of the biggest book distributors in Japan, the sales of the based manga's first volume in the week of July 6-12 increased about 10 times more than the previous week of June 29 to July 5.   <br>They broke the barricade. It was a stupid chapter.</br>  <br>It's a flop, they said.</br>  <br>How about playing pretend child making with Yuki? It's still pretend, as long she believes it's only a game.</br>  <br> Are you trying to imply middle-aged salarymen aren't moe? <br>Are you implying women past their prime can't be moe motherfucker?</br></br>  Just finished ep 01.<br> a group of girls playing pretend 24/7 so that their club's retard blob mascot don't go full bonkers <br><br>Poor things. How's the cute slice of life/shit is going down balanced for the whole series? 50%-50%, 75%-25%?</br></br></br>  <br>Yuki is pure. Cute genki pink-haired girls are meant to stay virgin.</br>  <br>Can I be proud of this even though I've not spent a penny on it?  Reading and hyping the manga on a thai moon drawing site must count for at least 0.1 sales right? </br>  <br>For the manga, it's 50-50 until a certain incident. Then it's 70-30. Recently, the school life club has more or less stopped activities.</br>  <br>Probably something like 20%-80%, but gradually shifting to 0%-100% as the story goes on. After the reveal the only real SoL is the occasional peek into Yuki's head.</br>  <br>Trickles down ever so slowly. Last time they did anything SoL-related was playing at the river in their swimsuits, which only lasted for two pages or so because it's the middle of the fucking winter.</br>  <br>It's the other way around, Yuki is pretending so the rest of the girls won't go full bonkers.</br>  <br>The manga has a lot less cute than the anime, but that's because they are pretty much making each chapter an episode by extending how long the cute moments last</br>  <br>No, he said "ep 01". At the start, Yuki is obviously totally delusional and the rest has to play along.</br>  <br>Well, yeah of course.</br>  <br>Point is, they let her roam free so they can have a peace of mind by having her being all cheerful and genki.</br>  <br>Those TIGHTS</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> read this <br> going to marathon 2nd season of Bojack Horseman this sunday  <br><br>I d-don't think I'm gonna make it, brahs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Waiting warmly for the next update of your blog ;)</br>  <br>Yeah but at that point, she's not doing it for the sake of the others, she's just being a liability to the group, navigation skills aside. You need to wait until the zombie class incident before she becomes the pillar of the group.</br>    <br>Hopefully they'll be at least one intercrural doujin for the series</br>  <br>Episode 2 was two chapters, wasn't it? And I imagine next episode will be Miki's backstory, which is itself a couple chapters. Man I might have to go read the manga again, I'm forgetting all this basic stuff.</br>  <br>Dog, bathroom, and Megu-nee is next, probably.</br>  <br>They don't have anything else to do anyway. Yuki's usefulness outweighs having to dote her tenfold.</br>  <br> Taroumaru becomes human instead of a zombie <br> fucks everyone except Miki </br></br>  <br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/18-1/school-live-manga-s<wbr>ales-increases-10-times-after-tv-an<wbr>ime-premiere<br>It's doing quite well, i'm tempted to buy it, but i'll probably wait for the english version</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Any doujins announced on GG! for C88?</br>  <br>Yes episode 2 was 2 chapters, but my point still stands; they aren't adapting a huge amount of material per episode. I agree with  though, next episode will probably cover the bathroom scene and start of megu-nee/dog/basement stuff. I reckon the basement stuff will carry over into episode 4 though</br>  <br>Yea I might buy the english manga . Hopefully they adapt all of it and don't pussy out. Might not sell too hot though considering how many people think it's generic SoL and might not have bothered watching because of that</br>  <br><br>That seems normal for any anime adapation</br></br>  <br>If they keep going 2 chapter / episode, that's still over 2/3rd of the manga.</br>  <br>Here's a bit less brown.</br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br>It'll end on  Yuki blacking out for sure. <br>Can't wait for Yuki's VA performance as she shouts at the door while being held back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True. I think they might try to speed it up though, the graduation scene would make a really good endpoint for S1</br>  <br>NIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNIGGERNIGGE<wbr>R</wbr></br>  <br>Yes, Yuki's monologue makes a perfect ending sequence. I just hope they won't skip anything for the sake of fillers.</br>  <br><br>By basement/Megu-nee, do you mean the bunker and Megu's zombie and Kurumi getting bit? Cause that seems more like something that'd happen at least around ep 6-7, maybe later; it seems way too early right now. I was basing my assumption of Miki's story on the next ep. preview/title.<br><br><br>And isn't the Graduation scene about 2/3 through the manga? They've been out and about for a little while now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuki's monologue makes a perfect ending sequence <br>God, it'd be too heartbreaking to end it just before they leave. I'd rather they end it with them driving off or with their messages on the blackboard.</br></br>  <br>Literally perfect.</br>  <br>Probably that's what is going to happen. The helicopter crash is also a nice climax before an epilogue.</br>  <br>At one point in episode one, you can see the zombies kneeling on the ground, presumably eating something. I assume that's a dead zombie since I can't imagine anyone else having survived that long just to die in the school field.</br>  <br>I'd vote for anime original ending since they've already butchered it by putting Mii in the start<br><br>Kurumi doesn't heal and ends up eating the rest, final scene is helicopter guy coming to the scene with the "we are fine" pic</br></br></br>  <br> This was supposed to be a SoL. Why make it dark?</br>  <br><br> Helicopter guy arrives and lands on the roof <br> gets to the club room <br> opens it  <br> look of shock and immediately closes it <br> shakes his head and looks at the paper as he crumples it in his hands as he walks back to the roof and flies off <br> END <br><br>Lets make it happen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone said Urogutcher was writing an episode</br>  <br>Ah, right. They didn't send the post card with the balloons.</br>   yfw they skip/absolutely ruin this scene   <br>Graduation scene is late 20s I'm pretty sure, so more like 75% through the manga. I'd rather the graduation scene be s2 if they'd have to skip important stuff to fit it into s1, but it really would make a good ending scene, since it's essentially the end of a chapter in all of their lives and the start of something new.</br>  <br>Without a source, that was just bullshit.</br>  <br>They already ruined her lonely terror.</br>  <br> putting Mii in the start <br>Anime starts after they went to the mall, fag, with the events of the first couple of chapters happening after. Have faith in the mangaka.</br></br>  <br>Maybe that's the reason they outright cut out an entire volume with Miki. Who knows, maybe we'll get an OVA of that?</br>  <br>It's still pretty heartwarming, if a little depressing too.</br>  <br>Nah, I'm pretty sure they'll still cover Mikis history at some point (though they might condense it). Unless you meant the graduation scene as an OVA, in which case that'd essentially mean the anime is dead since it's such an important scene</br>  <br>I'm betting on a flashback/backstory before and during initial breakout episode happening</br>  <br>Perfect, anon</br>  It begins.  Jesus Christ. Asign Miki as her babysitter and have her on a leash the whole day. You don't need to comply with all her requests, specially if it means going on hazzardous missions and bringing her along as a handicap.<br><br>Learn to say "no" and raise your moeblob reatrd properly.</br></br>  <br>Considering how low the sales were, ten times is lower than I expected, but sill great the anime is doing its job</br>  <br>Nope. Without Yuki's delusions and her pushing them to actually do things other than sit on their ass moping, they would be dead by now.</br>  <br>They didn't express it very well in the anime, but Rii was planning the trip anyways. They were running rather low on supplies, as seen a bit earlier in the episode. The 'test of courage' was just the way Yuki's mind framed it; in the manga she didn't mention it until Rii had already told the others they needed to make the trip for supplies.</br>  <br> .kr <br>Sasuga Worst Korea.</br></br>  <br>Why are your screenshots such an odd resolution?<br><br>A lot of Yuki's ideas are actually the sane part of her mind putting logical thoughts in a way that stops her from breaking down. The test of courage being to gather supplies, and wanting to graduate being the fact they can't stay in the school forever (especially after the helicopter scene)</br></br></br>  What will the next episode be about? Will it be about  Megu-nee being dead and all?   <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CJQ<wbr>2fOtHKvQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The guy even uses PS for drawing. Just how low can they get?</br></br></br>  <br>MODS</br>  <br> Why are your screenshots such an odd resolution? <br>He is probably streaming and uses PrSc.</br></br>  <br>It's going to be a flashback from when Megu-nee was alive. The only indication it takes place in the past is because Miki (and maybe Taroumaru) aren't there.</br>  <br>He put up a fucking speed drawing video for that?</br>  <br>Yes. Time to comment on how much of a faggot he is.</br>  nice face  <br>Aspect Raidou.</br>  <br>Why is the face for Miki her face of excitement?</br>  Would you still a second-hand shovel?  <br>Some heavy stuff.</br>  <br>No. This impure wench can die at a dark alley.</br>  <br>The mangaka is doing a really good job with those horrified/shocked expressions.</br>  <br>Did someone jab your goober with a shovel m8?</br>  <br>I would act cool and protect her so she would drop the shovel, then abandon her on a supply run and tell her it's her fault for being a loose woman.</br>  How will the Big Mom ship encounter turn out?  I hope we scenes like this for the final battle and Luffy's crew being named with their own panels.  <br>Then they get wrecked by the Marines.</br>  <br>Jinbei will come and save them, Kid's alliance will take her down.</br>  I'm positive everyone on the ship jobbed  <br> final battle </br>  <br>Hate to ask to be spoo nfed, but where do I get HQ scans?</br>  <br>Capone seemed to think they were doing well.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Sanji and Brook defeated Pekoms and Tamago; and Caesar blew up the ship.</br></br></br>  <br>I really think Jinbe is too strong in water to be a straw hat.

They did.</br>  <br>I dont know if its safe to assume but its possible?<br><br>Shanks and co intended to sell the one fruit we see them with. Perhaps selling DFs was a thing they did in their spare time.

Judging from the interest in Buggy's fruit it seemed like they didn't really care too much.<br><br>You also have to remember that as a pirate you spend most of your time on the sea, and losing the ability to swim is enough for the majority of the pirates to avoid eating one (Especially if the fruit is unknown), the only reason we don't see shitloads of fodderish DF users drown is because it would be pretty boring and somewhat morbid. <br><br><br><br>If PH is any indicator, they can permanantly change the climate of an island.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Devil <br>Demon <br>Literally god'a natural enemy</br></br></br>  <br>Transform/alter the environment into their element; as seen on Punk Hazard and with Crocodile.</br>  <br> Daring </br>  <br>There is no evidence Shanks intended to sell the Gomu Gomu.<br>Zero.<br>There is evidence against it.<br>For example on the first page of storyline canon (actual page one is a color spread of Luffy and Shanks and many characters in a open area full of treasure, celebrating), a narrator tells us Shanks arrived 1 year ago. We are shown his last night and day at the island.<br>Before docking one year ago, Shanks stole the Gomu Gomu from an enemy pirate ship. A year later, Luffy eats this fruit which was hidden on the red hair's ship.<br>Shanks flips out.<br>Later in the story we are told that BB gave Shanks his scar, that he was a 20 year member of Whitebeard's crew (joined before Roger died but within the same year). <br><br>Shanks hid in East Blue for one year because he invaded Whitebeards ship to steal Gomu Gomu and was scarred by Blackbeard.<br>Blackbeard would only expose his power level to a Roger pirate if it was over something really important.<br>There's no canon that suggests Shanks planned to sell Gomu Gomu.

I really don't see it happening.<br><br>Whitebeard and his crew all saw Luffy fight, and Luffy has interacted with a lot of legends like Rayleigh and Chiango who would have mentioned something about similar powers.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Zou will be an arc similar to the Davy Back Fight arc because Oda know when to give his readers a break after long, exhausting arcs.  <br>Roger has only been shown going into battles with a sword and pistol, and presumably haki on top of that.</br>  <br> shit song <br> terrible outfits <br> shit drawing <br> shit animation <br> cheesy dialogue <br><br>Only good things were the Dressrosa parts, and that was only about 30 seconds of the whole thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what new fate things Zoro learned from Mihawk.  <br><br>I'm hoping there's a huge amount of buildup for Big Mom, including flashbacks to fights with WB/Roger/Kaido etc...

Literally just overpower them by being strong.</br>  Do you think Marines will uprise to the WG at the end?

It's all pretty clear.</br>  I'm hoping they managed to get away<br>What I'm expecting is that only like one or two of them got away and everyone else was captured.<br><br>If anything, I'm sure Sanji's being forced to cook for big mom</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can see that happen under akainu's tutelage.<br>He doesn't give a fuck about the WG and wants the marines to be his own tool of justice.</br></br></br>  here is as good a place to post this as anywhere  Why does Oda always pierce your heart by his shit and you start to almost cry?<br> That person they spoke of wasn't some random pirate and he wasn't the cursed offspring of the great pirate era that everyone spoke of, Ace was my brother </br>  So I am reading one piece again and I'm at Skypiea. Here is this scene where Robin talks how the lightning fruit is one of the invincible powers. Is she talking about Logia in general or are there fruits which are considered invincible?<br><br>Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line?</br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I think the line was about the most powerful ones <br>the goro goro is one <br>pika pika is another<br>gura gura <br>and probably the magma one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line? <br>Oda confirmed that he would have had a 500 million bounty if he were on the blue sea. So New World tier of course.<br><br>Also, I think it's one of the invincible in that the user is very hard to kill perhaps. He did restart his own heart with the fruit after all.<br><br><br>Could also be this; I'd argue Enel's fruit is the best in the series so it could be reference to the overall power of the fruit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason Enel lost was because for no real reason he made himself really big and unable to dodge.<br><br>Maybe Oda bumped him out of the plot early on because he's planned out all the biggest powers early on and the lightning one was so strong he needed it out of the way.</br></br></br>  <br> new world tier <br>Yeah, no. Bounty != strength. Enel would get trashed by any top-tier New World Pirate/Marine.</br></br>   big mom showing up already to get jobbed.   <br>yeah, i like to imagine Roger as a beast, no fruit, no weapons, only the good old barehands and his fukking super haki<br><br>Also i want an entire Arc for Roger adventures/flashback (at least the early and the late years)</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like for Roger's flashback to show him as a  horrible criminal who burns down cities and steals fucking everything. <br><br> But I'm aware he'll have to be another good guy who never does wrong. </br></br></br>  <br>Has she been conirmed for battling anyone as of late? I'd love it, if she pulled a Gecko Moria and got a lot weaker for not dong anything for a long time. She's able to keep her position due to her past notoriety, but it's not based on anything anymore.<br>Then her whole crew should job against the SHs on the Sunny.</br></br>  <br>People tend to forget how insanely strong Doffy is.<br>He wasted Law and Luffy while mantaining that stupid birdcage that not even a whole island could stop, including Zoro and Fujitora. Also Gear Fourth Luffy could not finish him even when Law already injured him big time. Doflamingo is fucking strong.</br></br>  <br> brook drinking soda which would dissolve his bones <br> luffy feeding a fish soda which would fucking kill it <br>Robin's hot legs are the only thing that save this pic.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Roger will be a  a complete retarded who act before thinking  with enough knowledge and focus to reach raftel.<br><br>Also  final boss is Davy Jones, Admiral of the ancient kingdom, become the keeper of Raftel and One Piece, who is something world gov needs to achieve the complete control of the world </br></br></br>  <br> Told people to blame God <br><br>I thought Zoro is an atheist?</br></br></br>  <br>man, croco is so weak now. luffy can stop his attacks like nothing.</br>  <br> people forget <br>Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't.<br><br>Oda dropped the fucking ball with this arc its presentation is so boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DFs &gt; Haki<br>Enel would destroy people with lightning. No-one is immune to it but Luffy in the world.</br></br>  <br>Everyone is forgetting that Enel has the most advanced form of Kenbunshoku Haki seen so far.</br>  <br>Implementing his DF power into it really is unique. I can't wait how he applies niggermode into it.</br>  <br>dont read it through mangapanda if you are. if you arent, dont see what's so hard to understand</br>  <br> Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>No it's not, it's just that when you read weekly you forget events much quicker due to a certain amount of things taking 2 years, while with every other arc you got to experience the whole thing in a continuous hit.</br></br>  <br>Because any NW pirate/marine can do something about Enel's god-tier CoO and speed of light.</br>  <br> he becomes black with lightning powers </br>  <br> Because any NW pirate/marine <br><br>Why do people say this sort of thing about 'all' nw denizens when the majority of them, including crews, seem no more stronger than most of what we've seen before? There's just a few captains and things who are strong. Their crews are still the same jobbers.</br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora also likely does a similar thing with his gravity to advance his CoO.<br><br>Exactly (correction though; speed of lightning =/= speed of light, but it's still a fucking massive velocity which would be comparable in the OPverse)</br></br></br>  <br> I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>or maybe it's cause you're dumb. one refresh should be enough to remind you or keep up with things, only because it's so long.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>I would forget about some things from Impel Down, Marineford, Fishman Island and Punk Hazard as well. <br>It's kind of sad we'll always have newfags whining about whatever current arc is, no matter how good it may be.</br></br></br>  <br>You realise that Zoro, Usopp, Sanji and Robin survived his lightning, right ? Just CoA up and block that shit.</br>  You guys think Law will the be next Straw hat? Here is my thought:<br><br>Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats. It's always been like this and now we have seen Law's. <br>You guys think there is any correlation with that?</br></br></br>  <br>People survive every DF, however Enel's is one that's highly effective at incapacitating people.<br><br>Haki wont block out lightning by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the crew got stronger too ? I feel like it's relative. The crew fought fodder before but that same fodder would be dust in the NW. The fodder in the NW would be semi-successful in the Grand Line.</br>  <br>What role could he fill though?<br><br>I've been saying this for ages: the strawhats need a cook</br></br></br>  <br>Law has his own crew, but they can die, or he can give command to someone else. It's possible.<br> Kaido or Big Mom massacre Law's crew <br> Law seeks revenge again </br></br></br>  <br>We've seen bunch of non-crew members having flashbacks. By that logic Hody Jones should be a member already.</br>  <br>Surgeon.<br>Chopper is a great doctor, but can he perform surgery?</br></br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br>Senor Pink/Baby5 for next nakama!</br></br>  <br> Implying that Zoro is not a God. </br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I preferred the translation "Blame it on a quirk of fate."</br>  <br> Haki wont block out lightning anyway <br>You base this on absolutely nothing. If Haki can block fucking Light and Magma, it sure as shit can block Lightning. <br><br>Also, the NW people are obviously going to be a lot tankier than the Grand Line people. We have no idea if someone with Doffy's endurance would be incapacitated at all. Shit, he didn't fall unconscious after getting his insides scrambled.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would not even be mad.</br>  <br>Proof?</br>  <br>Zoro doesn't really have a role except being the badass sword fighter does he? Law could just be another fighter because they need one. And his surgery skills are needed. Chopper can't do every thing by himself. Not the kind of surgeries Law can handle.</br>  <br>Post yfw Zoro is revealed to be an ancient deity based around anger and carnage.<br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br>When has haki blocked light? Not in the sense of Rayleigh using it on his sword; but if Kizaru shot a beam of light at you, your haki on your body wouldn't defend that. Especially when haki like Vergo's can't even block out Law's ability</br>  <br>Zoro's just the Swordsman, yea.</br>  <br>That would be such a pain. He's been emo for long enough now, I want to see him enjoy life for once.</br>    <br><br>it's not really official but he fits the role as the first mate.</br></br>  <br>There's more required to become a crewmate than just a sad backstory.<br>You need:<br> Goal which requires travelling the seas <br> Sad backstory <br> A general role they can take (which is either wanted by Luffy or necessary I'd say) <br>Jinbei for instance has it all, which is why he's confirmed to join.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not talking about how every one who had a backstory joined the straw hats. But every straw hat that did, had a backstory before joining.<br><br>Just a thought that popped into my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way the user can be blocked, I suppose. I'm not saying it will negate the attack. I'm saying you can put up a defense, since Enel's lightning seems more similar to Magma than Light for whatever reason. And we really haven't seen anyone use CoA for defense against Kizaru, so I suppose I'm being baseless too. That's my bad.</br>  <br>Like an Archaelogist!</br>  <br> Kaido or Big Mom kill Law <br> Law's crew joins Luffy <br>A whole bunch of new nakamas is better than one.</br></br></br>  <br>Robin does have a dream though. It's to discover the true history of the world.</br>  <br> implying they don't need an archaeologist for reading the poneglyphs </br>  <br>Robin is indeed necessary for finding One Piece. Luffy is lucky that his fate lead her to joining.</br>  <br>but they could also have that backstory introduced later in the series. like robin. so characters that didnt have a backstory in dressrosa shouldnt be automatically ruled out, or Oda might not even keep up with that pattern. I think having a dream that makes sense to travel the seas with the strawhats and a new role they can fit into on the ship seem like a better criteria for now. <br><br>Which is why I dont think anyone's joining this arc.</br></br></br>  <br>chapter 816 second page</br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br><br>Robin.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, that's Law performing immortality operation on Chopper. You fucked up, /a/non.</br>  <br> Robin <br><br>What is the Tragedy of Ohara</br></br></br>  <br>ooh shit sorry youre right</br>  <br><br><br>I know, I know. I was just joking because Luffy doesn't seem to give 2 shits about it right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why did Oda make him suck so much ass?<br>All he did was essentially was use birdcage and then tank every attack thrown at him until he lost.<br>We didn't even get to see him actually fighting save for a few exchanges.</br></br></br>  <br>He was against his own protege and a prick that trained for 2 years solid. The majority of which was under Rayleigh himself. There was no way Doffy could have predicted that kinda growth.</br>  <br>Luffy and Law were absolutely thrashed with just a couple of blows. Also he has to lose, so Oda wrote it that way. We already saw him kicking ass in Marine Ford (Joz and Oars Jr), then fucking smoker up, tanking Aokiji attacks and wasting Luffy and Law. He has been the major villain who kicked the most ass in all fairness.</br>  I wonder how long it'll be before Luffy loses a fight again.  <br><br>Regardless of what happens, Doflamingo will be the best just because of that fabulous pink feathers coat.</br></br>  Which Yonko will Luffy oneshot?  <br>But he did fight back. He put Law on the verge of death, then put Luffy 3m deep inside a wall.<br>Without the whole colliseum team, Doffy would have finished this in 5min, it was a 200v10</br></br>  <br>He technically lost in PH. Most of the crew did.</br>  I'm beginning to suspect Brook might be a bit of a pevert...  <br>Shanks cause he'd be too busy crying over how far Luffy has come.</br>  <br><br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br> backstory of a character before they join  <br> before they join <br><br>Robin joined the crew before her story was even remotely explored. <br><br>It's entirely possible for someone to join then have their backstory explained later.<br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was just traveling with them until after Ennis Lobby. Her "I wanna live!" moment was when she officially became a Straw Hat, I reckon.</br>  <br>(Like how Nami was with them for a while and only became a Straw Hat after Luffy took care of Arlong.)</br>  <br>Technically we didn't get Nami's either. Or Usopp, I think. I think we got Usopp's just when they set sail, right ?</br>  <br> sail on a ship <br> obey captain's orders <br>That's all you need to be a crewmate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking serious?<br><br>How was Robin not a part of the SH during Skypeia?
