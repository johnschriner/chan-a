[ What makes the prison school manga so great? <br><br>I fucking love that art.</br></br>  It's Japan's equivalent to The Shawshank Redemption  <br>;_:7</br>  Did the mangaka do anything else?  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  good job anon  Ayy.  <br>I don't know how you guys can even watch Funimation's, the video quality is truly hideous and the 3D scenes were for the most part "lagging".</br>    <br>and aside from the fanservice, what does this anime have to offer?</br>  <br>Did you see what they just did? For Akagami episode 3 they fucked up the ENTIRE episode by having the audio not be from the episode itself, but from the next episode which hasn't even aired yet. HOW can you fuck up that bad</br>  <br> Overlord <br> fanservice <br>Your definition of fanservice must be different from mine, because the first two episodes don't have any fanservice at all</br></br></br>  <br>KILL<br>I<br>L<br>L</br></br></br></br>  <br>WAIT, SERIOUSLY?<br>Did they just go beyond the impossible in fucking up shit? <br>How does that even happen? What the fucking hell?</br></br></br>  This is why we need to be able to delete our own threads still. <br><br>I make this mistake like once every 2 weeks. <br><br><br><br>I have little patience</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128348887 <br><br>I see your scrip failed you bateman.</br></br>  I applaud this series for its uniqueness in the first two episodes. The main characters appearance is a definite change of pace. Like a skeletor anime. But it'll have to bring something to the table soon. Starting to really slog at the end of the second episode there.  <br>There have been employees from Funi here before. They treat anime with disdain and the working environment is horrible</br>  So is this going to be an overlord thread or just waiting for the pruning?  <br>Gotta love Funi's fuck-ups.</br>  <br>Poop, possibly a few cool fights as the floor masters face off against whatever human enemies they end up facing later, I'm assuming, and assuming momonga doesn't just walk all over them.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, time to download the RAWs then.</br>  <br>literally every single screenshot I've seen of this show on 4chan has a sexual innuendo.</br>  <br>That's from Mikagura. <br>The Shirayuki hime fuck up was release episode 3 with episode 4's audio</br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>Sexual innuendos=/=fanservice<br>Also, there aren't that many innuendos.<br>What you see from some cherry picked screenshots proves nothing</br></br></br>  <br>And HorribleSubs encoded it without making sure everything was fine?</br>  <br> And HorribleSubs encoded it <br> smug anime face.jpg </br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs encoded it </br>  <br><br>I meant stole. I'm not that dumb.</br></br>  <br> HorribleSubs rips it manually </br>  <br>How would I know they're using a bot.. I mean yeah, it makes sense. Pls no bully.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, at least lurk before posting.<br>Fucking newfag, I swear.</br></br>  <br> How would I know they're using a bot <br>Because they have literally said multiple times that they use a bot to rip stream sites, newfag-kun.</br></br>  <br>I dunno Papa Bones is sexy as fuck.</br>  AINZ - SAMAAAA!!!<br>KISSU!<br>KISSU!!</br></br>  <br>Moe~</br>  So what are you fellas doing while waiting for your weekly dose? Currently going through 37 year old, ex-businessman slime tensei.  Is there any other manga or anime where the MC is an ruler or an overlord?  Tomorrow's the day  <br>I'd give Shalltear my Spuit Lance if you get what I mean.</br>  <br>Next episode the slaughter begins, and it keeps going up from there and end on a pretty high note.<br><br>If by some crazy stroke of luck we get a second season it will escalate even further.</br></br></br>  <br>Lizard sex animated on TV! Crusch x Zaryusu OTP!</br>  <br>I wonder if its any different from anahole when i put my dick in there</br>  <br>Pretty sure it's only adapting up to volume 3.</br>  <br>Oh never mind, didn't notice the second season part in the post you was replying to.</br>  <br>I really do want to see the lizard sex animated though.<br><br>For research purposes of course.</br></br></br>  <br>  We will never get to Volume 9 and see Ainz in his World Domination mode glory.  <br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>sure we will. Five years from now.</br>   nothing to talk about till tomorrow   <br>Don't worry, if we keep studying Japanese I'm sure we can sort of read it in a few years.</br>  <br><br/></br>  If the anime means that we get more so-bin art, I'm all for it.  <br>Oh thats a new one. I like it.</br>  <br>How can anyone fuck up this much?</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl is passing by</br></br>  <br><br>I can't properly describe what my dick is feeling at this pic.</br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope some retard got fired, right? I also hope I'll live to see the day funi goes under.</br></br>  <br>Eh, Overlord air on Hulu later in the day. So whatever I catch first.</br>  <br>It's finally time.</br>  Over Lord? More like Over Bored.  <br>no quite. We won't get that far tomorrow.</br>  <br>No patience animeonlyfag gtfo</br>  <br>*not <br><br><br>*airs <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hulu is better than Funi? How is this even possible? Funi is the direct source.</br>  <br>At least death knight will have some fun.</br>  <br>I'unno. If it is or not I never noticed it. <br><br><br>Yup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We should get him summoning the DK and blowing up people's hearts though.</br>  <br>Ainz always blowing up peoples heart.</br>  Threadly Reminder  <br> retard lovers <br>not even once</br></br>  <br>Who is last born and toilet? <br><br>Also what race is Yuri? Is she a dragon like Sebas since she's the only one who doesn't hate humans?</br></br></br>  <br>You could check the wiki.</br>  <br>Nobody really knows who they are yet. <br><br>Yuri is a Dulahan.</br></br></br>  <br>Lastborn is the immortal human lieutenant of the meidos who ranks above Yuri but below Sebastian. She hasn't been shown in the LNs yet.<br><br>Toilé(t) is  the whore Sebastian saves from Eight Fingers and the sister of Ninya <br><br>Yuri is a Dullahan.<br><br><br> retard meme <br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> narberal being retarded is a meme <br>Narberalfags are as braindamaged as their waifu.</br></br>  <br>No bully pls</br>  <br>Reminder that Entoma literally means "bugs".</br>  <br>Narberal is cute precisely because she's so bullyable.<br><br>Her best moments are when she screws up and Ainz has to correct it.</br></br></br>  <br>Pls</br>  <br>I figured that's who toilet was, but just wanted to be sure.<br><br><br>What would one level in Dullahan even give you?<br><br>Also I though she was the head of the maids excluding Lastborn, but why is she like 12 levels lower than Narberal? That just seems weird to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't say<br><br><br>She's the one most fit to lead them when Sebas isn't around.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the head of the Pleiades.</br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>Not being harmed by decapitation.</br></br></br>  <br>Solution is second best though</br>  <br>The main character aka protagonist is a fucking SKELETON! A spooky skeleton with a fucking armor! Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh?</br>  <br> Isn't that enough for you tough boy? Eh? </br>  <br>damn, I haven't seen this pic in a long ass tme lol</br>    <br> Fake tits </br>  <br>Mononga sama is great.</br>  <br>When does it even air? Threads have up since Saturday.</br>  <br>Tuesdays, with LN chapter translations on Saturdays.</br>  Prepare yourself for terrible CG.  <br>Best girl is not even a girl</br>  <br><br>Yeah, it's doppelgänger.</br></br>  <br>Can't be worse than anything we've seen so far. Looked a bit awkward but okay in the preview.</br>  <br> implying </br>  Longest 7 days ever.  I don't understand why there's an argument over who the best made is. Yuri was made by Papa Bones, who's simply the best. His direct children should always rank above his adopted ones.  <br> Yuri was made by Papa Bones <br>We don't actually know that yet. It's not been said in the Tld chapters so far.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's a broken translation, Naberal is a shapeshifter while PA is a doppelganger. PA looks like how doppels normally look like, naberals "natural" form is half man half woman mostly monsterous looking.</br>  <br> Implying there are people who don't rate PA the best guardian. <br><br>Like a lot of families with adopted kids, Ainz tends to treat his surrogate kids way better than his direct kid.</br></br></br>  <br>They're both doppelgangers, not a broken translation m8.<br>Plus in the web novel Narberal actually shows her true form which is exactly like Pandora's actor, a face with holes for the eyes and the mouth.</br></br>  drop after 15th minute ep.1... is worth or what?  <br>No.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck is going on here?</br>  <br>Mare gettin shit done</br>  <br>Just because he treats PA like crap, doesn't mean PA still isn't the best. Same goes for Yuri. I thought her being his creation was one of the earliest spoilers we got in these threads.</br>   My order of volume 3 and 4 will arrive today <br><br>Yiss</br></br>  <br>Again, that's never been proven.</br>  <br>While it's heavily implied that all guild members had a hand in making the maids, we still don't know who made what.</br>  Just why is PA rated so highly anyway? Is it because unlike the other guardians, he verifies Momonga's orders before he does them?  <br>Is that the translated one? I thought someone said it was translated in their country to something but I can't remember what.</br>  <br>More like it's because he's a goofball nazi.</br>  <br>PA's ability to mimic up to 45 other builds at 80% power gives makes him a very tough opponent apparently.</br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>Mare was practicing after receiving Demiurge's private lesson.<br><br> “In addition, regarding the plan to strengthen Nazarick, I am also very interested. I want to know how far our kids can go. How about it Mare, you want to have children?” <br><br> “Uh? Huh?” <br><br> “However, that is impossible without a partner… If you find any humans, dark elves or wood elves, could you please capture them?” <br><br> “Eh? Ehhh?” Mare briefly nodded: “I-, if this helps Momonga-sama…. Then I will do it. But how are children born?” <br><br> “Well, when it comes to that time I will teach you. If you decide to experiment on your own, Momonga-sama will probably scold you. Due to maintaining the Great Tomb of Nazarick’s operating cost, it should be better if we try to maintain the balance first.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Apparently <br><br>You really think that level of versatility doesn't make him high tier?</br></br></br>  <br> Elf rapist <br> No elf being raped <br>Why</br></br></br>  <br>There were guys in the guild that were broken, like Touch me. 80% of fucking invincible is still a lot.</br>  how long has momonga been in charge anyways? that blob guy from the first episode said he last saw him like 2-ish years ago right? and it sounded like he was surprised momonga was in charge now and that's why the guild is still around.  <br>This dialogue will be animated?</br>  <br>It's not like he can take on more than one form at a time and wouldn't there be a lag between forms. Also that 20% from top form is pretty significant. I don't know if just having a counter build is enough to bridge that.</br>  <br>It was skipped.</br>  <br>No, it got skipped. It was during episode 2.</br>  <br>For a very long time. He wasn't surprised that Momonga was in charge NOW, but that he was STILL around and covering the Guild's maintenance fees because almost everyone else had already quit.</br>  What's the current pace of the anime (1 LN = X episodes)?<br><br>Are the LNs worth reading?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much 4 episodes per volume. And yes.</br>  <br>It's only an issue if he was facing someone who had the stats that could match one of those forms at 100%. 80% of a God's stats could still wreck 100% of an ant's stats.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;No elf being raped <br> implying <br>Demiurge want Mare to capture elves too (). I wouldn't be surprised if that guy has already prepared a rape dungeon filled with Orc.</br></br></br>  <br>Patience is great, but just like SAO and Log Horizon it's clear that this show will wear out its welcome after a season, and there's no chance it'll get more than two seasons. So, there's a limited time in which events can happen.</br>  <br>What  said but be advised that the translation quality of like half of the first volume is pretty poor. It gets better though.</br>  DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION  <br>I thought you meant against other equals, then the advantages are situational. <br>Just about anyone in that world is pretty puny.</br></br>  <br> But how are children born? </br>  <br> <br>The woman is a noble who lead a criminal group<br>Said group pissed MC off by kidnapping Sebas' waifu<br>He sent Mare and Entoma out<br>They go to her house.<br>Entoma eats the guards.<br>Noble chick tries to launch a sneak attack on him, sending out magic snakes.<br>Mare grabs those snakes and crushes them in his hands.<br>He then proceeds to twist her foot, causing the bones to protrude from the muscle.<br>Then he grabs her hair and drags her along, telling her to move faster.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Good alignment my ass, that kid's fucking creepy I swear, just look at his face.</br></br></br>  <br>Even against most other level 100s Pandora's Actor would still have an overwhelming advantage from having copied Touch Me (World Champion) and Ulbert (World Magic Champion).</br>  <br>Mare is actually kidnapping a girl to fuck her then? Interesting frown there.</br>  <br>It's neutral good, not good.</br>  It's ok to be Mare sexual right?  <br>Otoko.</br>  <br>Good does not mean nice</br>  <br><br>I'm sure his versatility and ability to transform into two world champions is extremely powerful, but he lacks in the knowledge and items for proper use for those builds. Also, Albedo only considers him to be on the same level as herself and Demiurge. Of course it's possible she just never considered him turning into world champions, but her assessment is probably accurate.</br></br>  <br>He's Neutral Evil. Neutral Good is Shizu and good is Yuri or Sebas.</br>  <br>Mare's actually evil though.</br>  <br>Why would punishing some uppity animals affect his alignment?</br>  <br>Why Mare and Entoma? Knowing Ainz, he must have thought really hard about it before he chose them.</br>  <br>Well it's not like he can send most of his guardians<br><br>Cocytus is a giant lizard monster<br>Albedo would probably murder everyone in a fit of yandere rage<br>Shalltear obviously cant be trusted to take hostages<br>Victim is pretty easy to kill<br>Gargantua is a xbox hueg golem<br>Demiurge and Sebastian were busy with their own stuff</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cocytus <br> lizard monster </br></br>  <br>Why not send meidos?</br>  <br>*bug-lizard monster</br>  <br>He's an Ant Mantis.</br>   Sharknado is a real spell and we will see it animated <br><br>Thank you based Momonga</br></br>  <br> Meidos were sent to help Demiurge. </br>  <br>Characters act according to their alignment. Their behavior doesn't change it.</br>  <br>Looks more like some amalgamation of large beetles, like stag/hercules beetles.<br><br>Immediately thought of this guy when I first saw him</br></br></br>  <br>Is this what pokemon has become</br>  <br>I fucking wish</br>  <br>So he's a mANTis?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br>Entoma IS a meido...</br>  <br>How much was it? Shipping cost? <br><br> So Bin artbook when? </br></br></br>  <br> What would one level in Dullahan even give you? <br><br>The ability to give good head.</br></br></br>  <br>Clackity clack clack.</br>    <br>If I recall, he sent almost everyone that could be disguised as a human.  The whole event only got out of hand once Blue Rose intercepted Entoma. Both were after the Eight Fingers, but the goody two-shoes Blue Rose adventurers wouldn't let Entoma go once they met her, because she was eating people in front of them, even if those people were guards of Eight Fingers. Entoma even asked if they would ignore her, but the muscle thing/woman wouldn't let her go. </br>  I've been reading the LN, and mostly it's "We don't know fuck all, so we need to investigate." When they finally do, they discover the MC and his minions are hilariously overpowered compared to everybody else.<br><br>It gets interesting when  one of his own minions gets mind controlled , though, because he actually has to form a plan. Judging from the OP of the show, that battle will probably be the finale.</br></br>  <br>I'm still pissed that their leader  managed to resurrect the two that Demiurge killed. What good id resurrection magic if everyone and their grandmother can use it? </br>  <br>Feel  kinda bad  Gagaran  is probably going to be brutally wasted.  <br>I hate her character design, but I admit it fits with her personally rather than the "beautiful butch musclegirl with the 10/10 face" and she's bro-tier as hell going by the last chapter.<br><br> But god I hate Climb. Even though I want to like him. But I hate him. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Have we ever seen Ainz hold any writing instruments? My mind is boggling on how the hell he holds a pencil or brush with those slenderman skeleton fingers.</br>  <br>Who doesn't hate Climb? Fucking Climb, man.</br>  <br>with those points all Ainz needs is an Inkwell</br>  <br>Well, I don't really care for him but I don't particularly hate him either. I'm just waiting for the day he discovers what his precious princess thinks of him and humans in general.He'll wish he were dead.</br>  <br> lolis never EVER get any kind of sex in any anime, ever <br> any time a shota is introduced, he ALWAYS fucks someone <br>Fucking double standards holy shit, so frustrating.</br></br></br>  <br>I only see a chair</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>It's only everyone we meet because they have the resources to do so.<br>It's costly as hell to resurrect people, since the New World plays by D&amp;D rules. And that sort of magic is costly as hell for anybody not a wandering murderhobo-cum-adventurer-thief. Like, literal lifetimes of commoner money, if not the effort to find people who can actually do it.<br><br>As well,  it only works on "strong" people anyways, since you seem to lose levels on respawn with that sort of magic. Anyone too low in "level" can't be brought back, as Khajit implied about his mother. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You see anon<br><br> something something boys always want sex says men who have messed up views of sex </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, that's hilarious. And a good point. I've always wanted to just be able to finger write without having to literally write it out with a stick that made it not look smudgy and shitty.</br>  <br> Plus the person has to want to come back, though I wonder who'd not want to come back if they could. How many levels did the Blue Rose people lose? </br>   Ainz says dark elf twins are too young to know about sex <br> when they're 70+ years old <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>I WANT to like him. He just tries so hard, the poor bastard. He is the stuff that real heroes are made of, what with his obviously pure as grace heart.<br><br>But he just eats up so much story with his goddamn sob story and STOIC LOYALTY. At least Gazef was fighting an uphill battle physically and politically with a modicum of personality.<br><br> though I am preaching to the (dark) choir of Nazarick, I assume </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To him, they're less than ten years old, since they were "born" when Bukubuku Chagama(?) created them.<br><br>As well, that's how they were created. 70-year old virgins. Because of roughly-made NPC blurbs that did nothing for Yggdrasil's gameplay other than making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds).</br></br></br>  <br>Ganbatte, toilet-san</br>  <br>If Khajit somehow got his wish, I would assume the irony would be that his mother would reject him trying to call her back to the earthly world. <br><br> I mean, he'd kill thousands, if not millions, to get enough negative/death energy to become a lich, THEN kill more to research his perfect resurrection spell for her. What mother wouldn't be appalled she was even tangentially related to that sort of slaughter? </br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. All we know is from dubious rumors by Chinafags and people who read moon off of the (admittedly quite different, especially for later volumes) web novel.<br>All we know is who gets rekd, details are lost (if they're even true at all). And once they get published in the re-written LNs as opposed to the WN volumes, who knows where the story will head?</br></br>  Can Ainz-sama bring back Ed's mom?  <br>Bait response aside, he could. She'd come back as a shambling mess of organs, bones, and necrotic goo screaming in mindless agony and rage, but yeah, he could. <br>I mean, it's not much different from what Ed/Al did.</br></br>  <br>Ed/Al might have had a bit bigger success if, you know, those weren't revealed to be a different woman's bones.</br>  <br> making PCs feel awesome about their OCs in their virtual circlejerk palaces (read: guilds). <br>You just have to know that probably a lot of guilds were Magical Realm as all get-out. If future /a/ played Yggdrasil and remade Touch the Fluffy Tail or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts and terrible and disgusting fetish blurbs on every R-15 (due to game age restrictions, not that a dedicated modder wouldn't get around that) sex puppet there.</br></br>  <br>Eh, disgusting flesh horror made from a summoning built off of true familial love gone wrong, gory lost limbs off some innocent-but-well-meaning kids, same difference to Ainz. <br>He'd just take a look at it, take notes, then let Demiurge play the remnants.</br></br>  <br><br>I used to lurk the tera generals, and I can confirm those fags were such sluts it was unbearable. But then again any /a/ guild would probably be the same if some game like Yggdrasil ever pops up.</br></br>  <br> or whatever TERA guild there was, it would be a den of sluts <br>Should have joined Pettan.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Ainz be able to effortlessly bring hdr back too life? Death is a minor hurdle at his level.</br>  <br><br>Well considering it requires the sacrifice of lvl experience, she'd probably be too low to be resurrected.</br></br>  <br>it's not his level that matters as the person that's brought back is the one that looses levels.</br>  <br>By name alone, I can tell that guild was probably sluts pretending they weren't sluts.</br>  <br>He probably could, even without level-loss. He has an assload of rare items, many of them not even Pay items that could probably do perfect resurrections without level loss. Magic too, even.<br>But why would he spend the effort (or more importantly, items) to do so?</br></br>  <br>They spent all their time hanging out in the arena. Nothing happened in their entire lives except getting killed by at least one raid group.</br>  <br>He might be interested In having alchemists who he can learn about a new form of magic from. I can't see Ed/Al being of use for anything else except Demiurge experiments. Of course he could just grant himself the ability to use it with his wish item.</br>  What time tomorrow's the livestreaming? I always get confused. 10:30 or 11?  <br>Ainz has enough resources and competent minions to do pretty much anything he sets his mind too, in the New World. <br><br>The issue is that he generally lacks motivation and is too cautious to ambitiously experiment. His primary concern is to protect Nazarick and his children. Most of the activities he undergoes are incited by the Guardians. He would rather just stay in the background, looking for his former guild mates and having adventures.</br></br></br>  I hope to God that the next part of the LN isn't more Climb.  Finally finished reading Vol4.<br>Fuck that was long.<br><br>Vol5 chpt3 translations when?</br></br></br>  <br>Saturday.</br>  <br>but chpt2 came out 2 Sats ago ;_;</br>  <br>The LN translation seems to be on weekly basis.<br><br>Crazy, right?</br></br></br>  <br>The fuck you talking about? Chp 2 came out 2 days ago.</br>  <br>What kind of time loop are you in?</br>  <br><br>well fuck me then, time for bed.</br></br>  Man looking at the illustrations for volume 7, I feel really, really sorry for the Workers. Poor saps took the worst job possible.  <br>Is that you undead flash? Please tell me about episode 4.</br>    <br>Surprise.  More Climb. You get to see Sebas teach him how to be a man (or die in the process.) </br>  <br>Oh god please no.<br><br>Somebody save me from this fresh hell.</br></br></br>  wait a minute. If she is dead, how can she still produce body fluids.<br><br>who programmed this shit.</br></br>  manga update when?<br>i need that hugging scene illustrated</br>  <br>Her creator designed her that way. It's why they all worship the 41 Supreme Beings.</br>  3/5    <br>What?</br>  <br>She does show off her natural fingers at some point in the published novels, I'll be fucked if I can remember where though.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear, papa Bones stuck all of his friends armor onto statues or threw them into storage.</br>  <br>It triggers my autism knowing there will always be a gap in his collection from the last 3 that left without deleting the characters and giving him their gear.</br>  So how much do the NPCs remember about the Players or Supreme Beings? Its clear they know they were created by them but do they remember the game as it was their reality or just the background they were given?  <br>right after fighting khajit/clementine saving alchy shota in the tomb. The Virtuous King of The Forest asks about it. I'm wondering if they are going to bring up the sentient item they gave to the King. Probably not for another 10 volumes.<br><br>Probably because they are in the game world somewhere. Papa has 11 world class items anyways so its not like he needs more crazy shit to fuck around with.<br><br>They understand their settings but the characters seem to take after their creators in the gaps. They act as if they were always sentient.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They act as if they were always sentient. <br><br>That just makes me imagine all the terrible shit that could've happened if a pervert played this game<br><br>Imagine some pervert making his NPC follower into a scantily clad waifu and then forcing her to take on humiliating poses using the menu or giving her a cringeworthy backstory a la "She loves me and is a nympho who needs cock at least three times a day bla bla bla"<br><br>Then you accidentally go to the new world and your NPC waifu who was accustomed to doing the "bend over" pose and "sexy dancing" emote is real and remembers every single thing you've done together, even the times you ran into her character model repeatedly and pretended it was sex.<br><br>Man, I'm glad for Ainz but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but I would have fucked this opportunity up so badly <br>Oh anon.</br></br>  So did anybody else hear him at the end of episode 2? It was the last thing I was expecting.  <br>If you think that's bad, just imagine what /tg/ and /d/ would get up to as part of an evil guild.</br>  reading time  <br>Woot! Reading! Literature!</br>  <br>Chinese or Korean?</br>  <br> actual literal cherry picking <br><br>Sasuga disinformators.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo, stop being so perfect please. I am trying to work, not to produce instant, infinite boners.</br>  <br> Dullahan <br> head maid <br> head <br><br>bonelaugh.gif</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget he gets to copy secret weapon Rubedo and he can do lame shit like go Ainz -&gt; Eclipse CD -&gt; transform into someone else and not be fucked over by Ainz's shitty build. Unless 80% of kill everything period means only kill it by 80% and leave 20% alive, which is still pretty damn good for just one attack.</br>  <br>Isn't he just 80% of the original's level when transformed? That would make him too low to use eclipse when mimicking Ainz</br>  <br>The one that turned into clothes?</br>  <br>It's 80% stats, not 80% of the level.</br>  <br>Is this Vol 7 or Vol 5? I'm gonna guess the 11k words is total and not per page.</br>  <br>You know what's funny. Khajit and Zuranon have to sacrifice thousands of lives to achieve lichdom. Ainz just needs a book, that he probably hoards by the hundreds.</br>  <br>But that's just how it is. Players are different than New World denizens. Compare 13 heroes leader who was a player to Climb. It's not even remotely fair.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Ainz to show Zuranon just who is the true master of the undead.</br>  <br><br>What is this!?<br><br>He's just bones....</br></br></br></br>  <br>believe it or not but skeletons are usually just bones</br>  <br>So is the human body. Oh wait.</br>  <br>A book?<br><br>I thought all he needed was the character creation screen.</br></br></br>  Next episode in 7 hours. And then it will be another 7 days until we can see Papa Bones animated again.  <br>I still wonder where we're going to stop at this episode.</br>  Hey does anyone have the image of the world map? I swear there was one, but I don't remember which volume or chapter it was, or if it was only in the manga.  <br>I say virtuous king.<br>If it happens I'm buying a hamster.</br></br>  <br>Right before the confrontation or a quarter into it.</br>  <br><br>Introduction of Strogonoff, before the battle with the Angels start.</br></br>  <br>that's a stupid move though. the Eclipse CD augments Insta-death spells which are the main reason that Ainz RP build sucks(in the game there was lots of anti-instant death resistances and Rez at high levels), so PA is better of copying Touch me or that PVP wizard</br>   In that room, a white lizardman was being pressed down with its tail lifted up. A black lizardman was riding on top.<br><br><br>Baffling.<br><br><br>Ainz didn’t understand what was going on in the very beginning. The next instant, that changed to confusion as to why they are doing that thing at a time like this.<br><br><br>Ainz then moved the sensory organ outside silently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>T-Too lewd</br></br>  <br>angel battle won't last part A anon haven't you watched enough animus?</br>  <br>I just started the lizardmen chapter. I had no idea you could make lizardmen so boring.<br>At least Shalltear drowning herself in drink that shouldn't even effect her was hilarious.<br>I hope they put Eck in the anime. A penguin plotting to usurp Ainz is hilarious.</br></br></br>  Where I can read the LN? <br>I just found about this anime and it was great</br>  <br>It was from Volume 9, but we only have a shitty camera picture since there are no scans yet.</br>  <br>really?</br>  <br>It's a race change item, it's mentioned in Volume 4.<br> One of the conditions was a specific item. For example, you would need the ‘Book of the Dead’ to be a lich. To turn into an imp required ‘Fallen Seeds’. And the ‘Heaven’s Feather’ that Ainz mentioned was a required item to become an angel. </br></br>    <br> shadbase </br>  <br>Ah but that's the kicker, the Eclipse CD is the only worthwhile move in Ainz's build, and it's honestly not that shit just easily countered.<br><br>Besides, it's not like there's any known counter to rez items as far as we know. Ainz himself has a ring that gives him 3 self rezes in a row without losing exp. Being able to instantly take down 1 of them then transforming into Touch Me/Ulbert/Rubedo is very useful.</br></br></br>  <br>But Ainz started the game as a skeleton, he doesn't need any items to change.</br>  <br>I laughed.</br>  <br>He was just a weak skelly in a tattered robe, he could've taken up a curved sword and maybe be one of those spooky pirates. He probably needed the book to be magical spook lord.</br>    <br>http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/2015/<wbr>05/O42.html<br>start from vol 2 at the very least</br></wbr></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br><br>Cool, thanks based anons<br><br> start from vol 2 at the very least <br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You will understand as you read.</br>  <br>Spookman is still a alright mage, his insta-gib stuff does debuffs if it doesn't kill and he still has some bread-and-butter things to be good enough at just straight up killing things when he's not being busy playing support-bot.</br>  <br>Just ignore him, start from the very beginning prologue. The minor details that the anime and manga discarded are nice</br>  <br> You will understand as you read. <br>But did I will lose any detail/info if I didn't read vol1 or it was bad translated?<br><br><br>Ok, thanks again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess the book is needed to class up from a spooky skele mage to a lich. What else could he have become other than a lich?</br>  <br>It's probably in one of the D&amp;D 3.x books seeing as a good chunk of stuff in the novels is lifted from there.</br>  <br>A wheel skeleton, I guess.<br>At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider.</br></br>  <br>Death knight?</br>  <br> At worst, he becomes Ghost Rider. <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br> Papa Bones as a level 100 wheel skeleton <br><br>The mental image is simultaneously hilarious and horrific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The only proper answer is to become a bone wyrm instead.</br></br>  <br>It's only worthwhile when compared to the enemies he faced in YGGDRASIL and other undead, but when up against pretty much any other opponent, Ainz is loaded with all kinds of incredible moves, such as all his summon abilities.</br>  A lich's soul is attached to his phylactery right? What item would that be for Papa Bone?  <br>To become a lich in 3.x you pretty much just have to create a phylactery; that requires a caster level of 11, Create Wondrous Item, 120,000 GP and 4800XP.</br>  What would the guardians do if Ainz announced that he would go adventuring alone?  <br>Reluctantly agree while praising the unknown plan Ainz has concocted that their feeble minds could never fathom. They would soon become stalkers of the highest order.</br>  <br>I do know that the orb in his chest is a world item so that can't be it.</br>  <br>Do liches even have independent phylacteries in this setting? We know that Ainz can be resurrected normally and the lich that was destroyed by the lizardmen would have automatically resurrected if it had a phylactery, but it simply died along with its body.</br>  <br>How does one turn himself into a bone wyrm?</br>  <br>They would put up a fight and pester him endlessly to try and send at least one maid to accompany him. If he still refused, they would have someone skilled enough follow him and keep tabs on him</br>  <br> stalkers of the highest order. <br>Pretty much this.</br></br>  <br><br>Dracolich it up.<br>Or just do what I did and  reform a collection of ground up bone dust from various species, preferably those with high magic affinity, into the inexplicable visage of a dragon's skeleton. During the bone creation process, you fuse pieces of your soul into the various parts of the skeleton and then assemble them together into the aforementioned dragon shape. <br><br>You have to then to find a way to keep the form together, there are numerous ways to do this but I prefer simply empowering the bones and possessing them en masse hence why I embedded my soul into them. Some have resorted to simply practicing bonemancy or utilizing a single gemstone acting as the heart to keep the whole thing together. If you did things right, you should be able to leave your mortal body and become a spooky skelly dragon.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>What's the source on that? I know he has a WC item cause the guild said it was okay but I didn't read anywhere that it was the orb.</br>  <br>So you used the bones as an unconventional phylactery instead? Neat.<br> also /tg/ pls </br></br>  <br>Stalking is highly possible. So is suicide.<br> “Ai- Ainz-sama, please agree to me, promise to me that you will never abandon us and leave this place!”  <br> “......I apologise, however……” <br> After ‘however’ , Ainz did not continue speaking. He had a particular reason for it, but Albedo assumed that his silence was due to something else. <br> “Why! Why can you not make that promise? Did you have thoughts about abandoning us already? Why! Is there something which makes you unhappy? If you would just explain, I will immediately remedy it! If you think of me as a hindrance, I shall immediately take my own life!” </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More or less he's an umber hulk</br>   Precure Thread <br> Muh Twilight-sama </br>  Bring back Nagisa. Save Precure.  <br>Bringing back Nagisa would kill Precure.</br>    I just realized how weird it was that they were on break for the entire first part of this series. I thought it was summer, but since they only just went up a grade it must've been 10 episodes of spring break. And I only just consciously realized why Onpu looks completely different from the others.<br><br>And that gender-bend self insert of Nobuko's was kind of funny. It seems like she has "more than friend" feelings towards Aiko if she'd write a story like that.</br></br>  I finally started GoPri.<br><br>It's pretty damn solid so far. Might be Heartcatch tier. If Pafu values her dog-chastity she shouldn't let me anywhere near her.</br></br>  <br>How do you like Close?</br>  <br>That's Setsuna from Fresh, why is it the file called dokidoki?</br>  <br>Did you see Doki?</br>  <br>Seems suitable. But more importantly, I think the monster designs are among the best I've seen in the franchise, at least 2 episodes in.</br>  <br>Be glad, because the Zetsuborg designs keep being unique all the way through the present episode.</br>  <br>The biggest failure of Doki Doki was the fact that the villains always congregated in a bowling alley, and yet there was not a single big lebowski reference, subtle or blatant.</br>  <br>sorry.<br>I made a mistake.</br></br>  <br>Supermodel, Violin and Butler have been the best ones so far, I'd say.</br>        <br>Especially butler was great. Both design and fighting style.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128302953     <br>I wonder if it's diamond shaped, as we've been led to believe.</br>   Preferred the blue.     <br>What a cute Pikachu.</br>  Where is the new precure movie up for DL?   there will never be a precure gayer than dokidoki   I'm going to marry Haruharu!  I want to fug Pafu      <br> I did too </br>  <br>I hate that fucking episode.<br>It seriously reminds me of stuff like Pic. <br><br>NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL SASUGA VOL:40<br><br>So did I.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   <br>I don't remember who's supposed to be on the right.</br>  <br>It's also Towa. They used her school skirt for a quick scene transition. So did Haruyama.<br>Fucking sasuga.</br></br>  She sure is cheeky.  Wow, the budget on this Akane's Treasure episode of Smile is nuts. The details, man, all over the place, not even just during action sequences. It's like I'm watching a movie. And also, I finally noticed the Smile movie ad in the OP and wow, does that look very pretty too. Mother fucking ICE SWORD? You know I'm downloading that right now.    <br>You're disappointed that your Japanese little girls show didn't make a reference that Western stoner man-boys would love?</br>  Whoa  Posting best mum.  <br>Someone at Toei loved Akane very, very much. Every time the spotlight shifted to her, she looked fantastic and her fights are some of the best in the series. She may have seemed like a goober but once the fighting started, she became this incredibly stylish, tough-as-nails monster. It's not easy to look that good standing beside Beauty and her scenes, as well.</br>  <br>Yeah, Beauty's ice sword caught my eye, but it also looks like Sunny shoots something full of fire causing it to explode at some point during the movie too, so yeah. And this thing during the episode I just watched, where she exploded herself basically was awesome. WOlfrun looked menacing, evil, crazy even, frightening. So did Joker. Even little details like when Miyuki was explaining she wasn't good at seweing, Reika and Yayoi both grinned and squinted their eyes ever so slightly. Gorgeous gorgeous episode. Akane is gorgeous just by default obviously, but man did they really go for it in this episode.</br>  Those teeth are a bit off-putting, I must say.<br> Dat CG Twinkle armpit though </br>  <br>Those last character focus episodes are great. The one that focuses on Beauty in particular is a real treat.</br>  And they mentioned Brian again too! THe girls focusing on the word "like" made me laugh out loud when everyone around me is sound asleep. <br><br>Also, Haruyama, please.</br></br>  <br>you're just saying that because you love misery</br>  <br>Well, Smile was a pretty series any way you slice it, so the prettiest moments of that year are going to look awesome.<br><br>I really liked the WolfrunxSunny thing a lot. My the time this episode rolled around, it seemed like the most natural thing ever that he should choose to go after her, just like I'd expect her to be the first to step up against him.</br></br></br>    Who is Micchy's favorite Precure?    Who would want to remember him? His plots were terrible. I hope he doesn't stay in this for longer.  <br>Boys don't like Precure.</br>  <br>Yuri. They both enjoy murdering their siblings, and would identify with each other on that basis.</br>  Dead thread. I want to fuck a dead or dying precure.  <br>Like Yuri?</br>  <br>Wearing a towel in the bath is silly!<br><br>But yeah, Precure is dead. HaCha was the nail in the coffin, and there's no coming back.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking of Megumi actually. I remember early in Happiness Charge thinking Megumi might have some chronic illness, and I never finished so I have the superpower of letting my imagination decide what they did in the second half, as opposed to whatever actually happened.</br>  <br>It was her mom.  And it turned out to be nothing. </br>  <br>I think he meant both of them, and nothing meant something to her.</br>  I want to NTR Tsubomi.  <br>I want to pick up the pieces of her broken heart that you leave and gently deflower her.</br>  <br>cat is dog</br>   everyone expects Kirara episodes to be funny and/or lewd with tons of budget <br> most of them are drama episode and have no budget <br><br>Literally what went wrong?</br></br></br>  I want to pafu Pafu's pafus.  <br>not enough lewd</br>    <br> create a character that's just too lewd <br> have to damage control by making her episodes as bland as possible <br><br>It's ok, c88 will do her justice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't-</br>  <br>Those are shorts for boys though.</br>  <br>Sexy boys.</br>  <br> kill Erika in her sleep <br><br>Damn, HaCha girls are cold, no wonder Yuri is there.</br></br></br>  <br>Three years later and she's still the milfest Curemum</br>  <br>Oh Miyuki how I wanted to  defile  your smile</br>  <br>Never to be surpassed.</br>  <br>The sexiest.</br>  <br>You think comedy and development is bland?</br>  <br>We all know that Mana has a  big fat dick .</br>  <br>I want to find out about it first hand.</br>    <br>You have to be a little girl to see it.</br>      Where do you guys download the movie?  <br>In chinese internet.</br>  <br>I was going to say something about futagohime, but I couldn't think anything clever.

She would either try to get Tsubomi herself, or Rikka, Alice, and Makopi would scheme against Tsubomi in secret to help Mana.</br>  <br>Either sounds fine to be honest.

I've seen fresh, hc, hacha, and am currently almost done with suite<br><br>I really liked the first two and thought hacha was okay until it became about Megubrains even though Iona is my waifu  and I want Megumi to be my mistress. <br><br>I think suite's okay too, but it could be better. Anyway, so for somebody with my taste, which series should I watch after suite? I've heard that I should probably stay away from dokidoki but that's it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Smile is fun and awfully pretty, up there with Suite. Based on what you said so far, I think that's your best bet. (I think Yes!5 is just a mediocre version of it, though someone here will probably be sad that I said that.)<br><br>If you just want hardcore fighting, you could go back and watch FW, it's pretty good for that.</br></br></br>  <br>Heartcatch and Fresh are about as good as it gets.<br><br>Smile has really good comedy/slice of life and contrasts this by occasionally getting about as real as Precure gets, but the ending is not terribly good but it might not be that bad if you've never seen DX3. It's worth watching though.<br><br>The original is worth a shot, even if it is a bit rough around the edges. It's easy to warm up to it, though.<br><br>GoPri is also consistently good so far for what it's worth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watch it all, and no, I dont think you should stay away from it.</br>  <br><br>Alright, I'll probably go with Smile and then FW, thanks anons.<br><br>I just heard that people that didn't like Megubrains stealing spotlight would probably hate Mana too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui confirmed! I knew it!</br>  <br>I think the original has some nice characterization and a sometimes serious tone that they've rarely managed to recreate since. Heartcatch is great. Fresh has some really good parts too, but it has plenty of boring streaks too in my opinion. Smile has some very enjoyable episodes, but it's pretty weak as a whole (whereas the other ones I mentioned are strong in that area).</br>    <br>Kiruminzoo and/or Kuuga</br>  <br> already watched all the best series <br>You dun goofed.</br></br>  <br> I just heard that people that didn't like Megubrains stealing spotlight would probably hate Mana too. <br><br>That sounds reasonable, but I should warn you that /pc/ is generally not to be believed when it comes to issues regarding "screentime" or limelight-stealing or anything along those lines. In this show, the pink cure is always the main character with an overwhelming majority of the focus and then varying amounts of time are spent developing the other characters, with other cures getting priority over side characters like classmates. All of the seasons are pretty similar in this regard, with only a slight shift away from or further towards that dynamic in any of them. Max Heart (with only 2 cures and 1 kinda-cure) is probably the best example of this phenomenon, often reffered to as "pink privilege," and then Yes5 (the first season with 5 cures, and then a 6th ranger in the sequel) would be the one I think moves away from this the most. But Nozomi is still overwhelmingly the main focus of the Yes5 series, and Honoka still manages to be developed enough that she was near the top of a popularity poll ten years later. Some people in these threads just have favorite characters that aren't the pink (not the main character) so they get mad about the main character getting the main chunk of focus of development. It's just such a silly thing to complain about when this franchise is so formulaic and predictable.<br><br><br>You can rewatch Fresh anytime though.

Whenever Towa finishes befriending all the girls.</br>  <br>It sounds like you want to try Pretty Rhythm. It's the most serious of the regular /ai/ shows, and you can pick Aurora Dream or Rainbow Live. I recommend the first if you're the kind of person to start watching Precure from the beginning (kind of rough and not as nice looking but still great), or the latter if you'd sooner recommend someone Heartcatch.</br>  <br> Hating Party Has Come <br>Learn to love yourself.</br></br>  <br>Party has Come wasn't very good at all so probably no. I also thought the second Smile ED wasn't very good.

Top class episode.<br><br><br> I've passed the climax. <br>Yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure I've seen these posted in .png sometimes. Does anyone know where they come from? I thought I'd typeset this one, but it's much nicer to work on clean images.</br>  <br>Will he wear Twilight's old mask?</br>  Oh boy, it arrived.<br>Will scan all the character art pages for you guys at some point, when I have the time.<br><br>Also has shit loads of interviews with the staff and each of the major character's voice actors, I'll do those too if anyone would be interested in translating.</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing this stuff keeps me on the straight and narrow. Imma get some sick gains later when I'm more awake.</br>  <br>Good page, this one.</br>  <br>Definitely interested in Honey's stuff. I wish the best for her and hope she gets more roles in other stuff in the future.</br>  <br>Flicking through, I think they've actually got some unused outfits for her, like this variant of the roller skating one Megumi and Hime used.</br>  <br>They did use that one, briefly. Good outfits.</br>  <br>  tfw we won't get Lollipop Hip Hop anymore. </br>  <br>How are you scanning this without ripping out the pages?</br>  <br>I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.</br>  <br>Where did you order it from?<br><br>I picked up the Dokidoki one while at AX but I'd like to get this one, too.</br></br></br>  Naisho has a really nice opening  <br>It ties with the Motto OP as my favorite.

I guess you can't spell Kiriya without Ira. Or something. At least it's something interesting to think about until Regina gets back.  <br>One of the few good Doki episodes.</br>  <br>Why not? Isn't that what they're for?</br>  Ohhh, bad news, yellows.<br><br><br>It was really sweet. It didn't seem like they would leave it hanging so I'm counting on more, but I wouldn't put it past them to ruin this completely.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This the only "pairing" of Doki besides muh Mana?</br></br>  "Naturally"? Man, I'm not even sure I prefer this over no explanation at all. I guess Cure Muse was just a half-assed cure, then. Heck, was it even necessary for her to get older, other than so that it wasn't a little kid lecturing them for the past five episodes?  <br>Yep, that is definitely the reason.</br>  <br> It gets explained better. It's a good idea to take every single thing Aguri says as made up bullshit straight out of her ass at that point. </br>  I want to be Rikka's fuccboi  <br> Aguri doesn't know shit. </br>    Some seriously awful animation in this episode.<br><br><br><br><br>Did someone actually think this was a good idea?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It ends up making sense, but it won't make you like Aguri any more. She's just giving the other girls the run around.</br>    <br><br> Did someone actually think this was a good idea? <br><br>They fellated themselves on the interviews about how much of a good idea they thought everything about the show was.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They were writing fanfic basically. Somebody pitched their fetish in, and everybody though it was a good idea.</br>  I think Doki was good.  <br>Well, we'll see. Just because something makes sense doesn't mean it's good. Or not stupid.<br><br><br>That blows my mind a little. And I'd like to think everyone got fired on the spot for it, but from the look of it they just gave them another season.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Oh, it's not good, and it's definitely stupid, but it makes sense.</br>  <br>Everyone but the producer is gone, from positions of influence at least.</br>  <br>You really should stop believing all the random bullshit people people out of their ass regarding Doki.</br>  <br>People have been doing it since the start, I've been fed a lot of hilarious misinformation. The trick is to just react in the moment and keep watching as if nothing happened. The interesting comments will get callbacks anyhow.<br><br>Besides, do you really think I should be fact-checking every reply, or questioning everything that people post? I haven't got the time or the energy for that... it's easier just to take everything at face value, even if people like you think I'm dumb for it.</br></br></br>  <br>He's literally going to see the bullshit for himself in a dozen episodes or so.</br>  <br>What does this even mean? Do you think people make shows with things that they think are bad ideas?</br>  <br> People have been doing it since the start, I've been fed a lot of hilarious misinformation. <br>The only misinformation you've been fed about Doki as far as I have read (and I'm here all day every day, reading every post carefully) is the occasional "Doki is good, Mana sue is a meme" token reply from the local /u/ crossborders.</br></br>  In order to revive we should poast meNes and general shitpost  <br>Not just about Doki. It's been a thing since I started watching Suite.</br>  <br>Most people are smart enough not to boast on interviews about something that was so badly received it made little girls cry, literally.<br>Of course h/u/mans just look like people, but they really aren't.</br></br>  <br><br>It means I disliked their work so I'm shoveling some dirt here because of my hot opinions. I literally believe they should self-flagelate but I also think they'd enjoy that too.</br></br>  <br><br>You can take it easy, that board isn't here anymore.

How do you manage to rip a scarf while falling on your ass?      Walk into your room<br><br>see this<br><br>what do?</br></br></br></br>  Wonder why my mattress is on a bed frame and not directly on the floor. Frames are bad for my back.  <br>My room is not pink or 2D so clearly I am in the wrong fucking room.</br>  Call the police  Commit a crime, go to jail, do not pass go, etc.  <br>If the frame is straight, and pretty much all bed frames are straight, why does it matter?</br>  <br>Wonder why OP is a fag</br>  Lie down in between them and stare at Illya while creepily smiling as she slowly wakes up to my pale disgusting fat neckbeard face.   people are actually turned on by this <br><br>It almost as disgusting as that Iori gif with her shaking her nonexistent ass and those soulless eyes.</br></br>  Nothing because I don't find Prisma Ilya attractive. I only find F/SN Ilya hot.  <br><br>Generally it's just not flat or solid enough for me. The elevation too.<br><br>The closer my mattress is to the floor, the better I sleep.</br></br></br></br>  Flop down on the mattress and see how high it launches them.  Crawl under the bed and sleep if heads<br><br>Roll up and down the bed from foot to head and back again while I pretend to be dio's road roller.</br></br>  <br>road roller if tales* I meant.</br>  <br>Lay down on my bed.</br>  Prisma hype reaching critical capacity and it makes me happy inside. 3rei is all but confirmed now.  <br>Take the pillow away from the bad girl and give it to the good girl</br>  <br>Dig into their anus with my index and middle fingers and lift them up with them.</br>  Would ask them to move away from my bed, however I really dislike waking people up.  <br>Shit I should do this.<br><br>Or better yet do best doing what they do in the land of the gods.</br></br></br>  <br> I put my mattress on the floor when I was 8 because that way no monsters could hide under there. <br><br>I was a fucking GENIUS.</br></br></br>  mape the raids  <br>Hope that next time 2D comes true, it won't be a FUCKING LAZY SHIT QUALITY COPY PASTE PANTY WORTHLESS SHOT like this was, holy shit I was angry that they couldn't even draw panties appealing.</br>  The maids rape  Which one farts more in their sleep?  <br> Give Kuro a Pillow <br> Give them a blanket <br> Shut down the light <br> turn around <br> get on the floor <br> everybody do the dinosaur </br></br></br></br></br></br>  [x] Put it in  I crawl into bed and enjoy the best day of my life. My hardest decision will be which one I'll tenderly love first.  <br><br>yeah instead they just slept with you dumbass nice going its probably why you post on this anonymous saudi homosexual activism imageboard.</br></br>  <br>I put on my robe and wizard hat</br>  <br>Wonder how my bed which is a couch turn into a normal bed.</br>  <br>Press face on the brown girls butt and enjoy the every second of it.</br>  Turn 360 degree and walk away.  <br> tap them gently  then  ask them if they need a blanket </br>  <br>Wish I had two faces.</br>  Rub my dick in between both of those beautiful ass cheeks until I cum on both of their backs.<br><br>Then go to bed in the middle with an erection, so when they wake up they can service me.</br></br>  <br>I can get away with it if I can cook, right?</br>  <br>What's the appeal of cummong on a girl's back?<br>That always happens in everything western.<br>Cum inside their butt, vagina or mouth for greater satisfaction.</br></br></br>  <br>On their backs? It is like you aren't even thinking of their pleasure. You'll turn one of those girls over, pull down her panties and lick until she organisms, then you can cum. The will be cuddling afterwards and then you'll need to turn over and help the other girl. After they are both satisfied then you can sleep.</br>  [X]Rape the maids  Cover them with blanket. Slip in between them and wait for what happens next.  The prisma fanbase managed to outcancer the regular fate fanbase.<br><br>That is a pretty impressive feat.</br></br>  <br>What the hell did you expect.</br>  <br>Yeah, so now go back to your fucking FSN generals.</br>  <br>I find it odd that the prisma spinoff is more interesting to me than the main fate universe.</br>  <br>He thinks the fate franchise is cancer, so that means he hasn't read the VN and hates fate threads.<br><br>Get your shit right.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he doesn't like Prisma, which makes me think he is actually a normie, so probably a Fate fag in disguise, just here to throw his feces on Illya fags.</br>  <br>I think it's quite hot if they have a nice butt<br>not sure why entirely but i like it</br></br>  <br>and how would raping some poor innocent maid help the situation?</br>  <br>Scoring up deep inside her butt, effectively forcing them to digest your semen is way hotter.<br>Or hitting their little womb, obviously.</br></br>  <br>Normies don't read VNs, and anyone who has not read the VN does not have an opinion on Fate, therefore what's his face is a total outsider.</br>  <br> Normies don't read VNs, and anyone who has not read the VN does not have an opinion on Fate <br>Not true, when it's FSN.<br>Every casual and his mother read it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't wait for Fate to be on steam</br></br>  <br> actually believes this <br>People who read the VN aren't "normalfags"<br>For proof, look at all the people in the UBW threads calling others secondaries for being dumb</br></br></br>  Im sure the majority in fate threads are anime only fags.  <br> tfw not into anal </br>  <br>Faggot.</br>  I want to F*CKING murder everyone who sexualizes Ilya. SHE IS NOT YOUR LITTLE SEX TOY YOU LOLICON F*CKERS!  <br>That's why fate threads become much better the further from an anime they are. In half a year, the threads will be good again.</br>    <br> People who read the VN aren't "normalfags" <br>Yes, they are.<br>People calling out secondaries are the biggest casuals.<br>Reading one, very casual and teen appealing VN won't make them somehow hardcore. Not when it's basically on Naruto level of popularity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br> SHE IS NOT YOUR LITTLE SEX TOY  <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>[ ] call the police<br>[ ] call mods<br>[x] genuflect<br>[ ] confess to john cena</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course she's not your little sex toy, she's MY little sex toy.</br>  <br>I only like anal if it's with a man, so that's pretty accurate</br>  <br><br>Fate fags should fucking get out of Prisma Illya threads, and everything would be nice.<br>Fucking A type scum.</br></br></br>  <br> getting upset over animu <br>either b8 or you have the patchiest neckbeard on /a/</br></br>  Kick them out of my fucking room.<br><br>They have their own beds. I wanna lay down and watch chinese cartoons.</br></br>  <br><br> "I-if it's popular it's bad!!" <br>Kill yourself. And I know you're the same fag from the other Illya thread.<br><br>Nobodies shitting up the Illya threads with "normalfag" shit. Look at the threads and it's clearly normal prisma discussion, with you shitting up the place constantly complaining about a non-issue. <br><br>Oh and by the way, Prisma and Fate are the same shit. You can't hate one and love the other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The real crime is that you posted the gif instead of the webm. I want to fap to them in higher quality.</br>  <br>underrate post</br>  <br>Draw my gun, but keep the safety on for now. Call police.</br>  From the perspective of the picture I'm assuming that I became taller.<br><br>I would go outside and look the world from this newly acquired height.<br><br>Probably go and kick some ass on b-ball.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't hate one and love the other. <br>Having completely opposite target audience says otherwise.<br>Get lost you fucking normal faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> You can't hate one and love the other. <br><br>Oh, so that means DEEN's fate now can't be shit on. Great one.</br></br></br>  <br>post it</br>  <br>Tuck them in. What else is there to do?</br>  <br>Nobody is turned on by this. It's drawn horrible.<br>This, on the other hand.</br></br>  <br><br>A lot of things, I can think at least 500 things to do in any given room.</br></br>  <br>You have my full attention sir. Do go on.</br>  <br> completely different audience <br>Where did you get this bullshit from? You're making Fate out to be Naruto which it isn't. And Prisma isn't some "lel super hardcore loli show" like your making it out to be.<br>They're both meant for an 18 and older audience.<br><br>I'm talking about the worldbuilding here, it's the same shit between both.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Normalfags love the franchise and a lot of them played the vn. Stop being delusional.</br>  <br> They're both meant for an 18 and older audience. <br> FSN <br> 18 and older <br>My sides. Orbit.<br> You're making Fate out to be Naruto which it isn't <br>It is.<br> And Prisma isn't some "lel super hardcore loli show" <br>At least it has loli sexualization, something that FSN casual fags are disgusted in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck them, I guess.</br>  <br> shiny red butt <br>absolutelyharam.jpg</br></br>  <br>fsn is literally 18+ though, its porn</br>  <br>huh what? prisma is fan service for TM fans<br>the prisma anime has the best fight scenes in any TM adaptation, the loliservice part isnt the most important honestly</br></br>  <br>Porn for kids.<br> implying we live in the 90's where this mattered </br></br>  <br>The one being delusional is the one claiming that Fate and SAO have the entirety of the same audience, which is bullshit.<br><br>Not only that, but he's claiming these "normalfags" read a 60 hour eroge VN.<br><br>And not only that, he's claiming these people specifically go into Prisma threads and shit them up, which is clearly not happening.<br><br>And how am I being delusional? I know there are normalfags who saw the anime, it doesn't mean all of the Fate fanbase is on that level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Both are made for an 18 and older audience so its the same !!!! <br><br>I really hope you aren't serious.</br></br></br>  <br> implying SoL and loli service isn't the important part of Prisma Illya <br>Thank you FSN casual, now fuck back to generals.</br></br>  <br>rub my ugly, stinking dark, hairy weiner and balls on their crotches and asses.</br>  <br> relying on the "Fate is shounen XD" meme <br>Can't even take you seriously. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>All of these loli what do threads...</br>  <br> Fate and SAO have the ''entirety'' of the same audience, which is bullshit. <br> Not only that, but he's claiming these "normalfags" read a 60 hour eroge VN. <br><br>That is true, though. <br><br> I know there are normalfags who saw the anime, it doesn't mean all of the Fate fanbase is on that level. <br><br>Obviously not all of them. But its the majority.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one being delusional is the one claiming that Fate and SAO have the entirety of the same audience, which is bullshit <br>They are almost exactly the same audience.<br> Not only that, but he's claiming these "normalfags" read a 60 hour eroge VN. <br>They do.<br> And not only that, he's claiming these people specifically go into Prisma threads and shit them up, which is clearly not happening. <br>Apparently, it's happening.<br> And how am I being delusional? I know there are normalfags who saw the anime, it doesn't mean all of the Fate fanbase is on that level <br>There are probably some Naruto fans who aren't normalfags either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please dont shitpost and lets discuss things like sane people without telling each other to kill ourselves<br>you can't deny prisma has the best fight scenes in the franchise, s1 had the best version of Emiya as well<br>sure there are lots of loli images posted in the threads but when you actually watch the adaptation you realize it's not all there is going for it</br></br></br>  <br>That's a fucking wonderfully erotic thought.</br>  <br>Lay down between them and take a nap, couple of nice space heaters like that will keep me warm.</br>  can someone tell me what is a normalfag now? if we're counting vn readers as normalfags then i dont fucking know anymore<br>i thought they were just, well, normal people who had a wife and kids and whatnot</br>  <br>Nigga what the hell is wrong with you? The main focus of that show is clearly the loli fanservice.</br>  <br>The fights might have been animated well, but they were still shit. Would have been much better as a complete SoL series, with more of the classmates.</br>  <br>Almost the entire fanbase of Prisma has seen another Fate work, why the fuck can you not claim they don't intersect at least on some of the audience?<br>I'm not claiming that everybody whose seen Fate is going to like Prisma obviously.</br></br>  <br>have you watched/read it?<br>the plot and fights are great, i read it for those</br></br>  <br> VN readers <br>It's like saying "anime watchers".<br>There are VNs for many kind of audience, and FSN is for normal fags. FSN normalfags = kids, who still live a normal social lives, go to school, talk about how cool they and their hobbies are with their friends.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Have no argument <br> "well it's happening I swear!" </br></br></br>  <br>Don't use image of a girl you don't even like for more as "daughteru", you faggot.</br>  <br> Almost the entire fanbase of Prisma has seen another Fate work <br><br>No shit, sherlock. It doesn't work the other way around, though. <br><br><br>You are the 1%.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you even saying? I like Prisma.</br>  <br>ive never seen someone in highschool who knew about fsn<br>then again, i wasn't in highschool when fsn was a thing<br><br>can you tell me what normalfag means now though? seems like the meaning is pretty broad</br></br></br></br>    <br>Then what the fuck is your point? If Prisma shares entirely people that have seen Fate, then obviously Fate can't be just "normalfags".</br>  <br>What kind of evidence am I supposed to have for something like this? I don't want to bring up my personal experience with people like that. Also, its not like you have any evidence either.<br><br>Well, just go to /r/anime or some other casual faggot forum and ask them if they have played the fate vn.</br></br></br>  push them to one side and sleep<br><br>fuck are u hogging all the room on the bed for bitches, you best sleep right next to each other if not hugging each other</br></br>  <br>You know, people who live a normal life, like socially acceptable things and definitely wouldn't feel attracted to little girls like Illya or Kuro.<br>In short, FSN fags.</br></br>  <br> a/nons <br> making their bed </br></br>  <br> Flat chests and flat butts <br> no hips <br><br>You guys are going against nature.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this too I guess.</br></br>  <br>this just sounds like "someone i hate" to me<br>generalizations are usually pretty dumb<br>im pretty glad "normalfags" exist anyways, i wouldn't get my autism money if not for people who were working</br></br></br>  <br> not making your bed </br>  <br> his room isn't pink <br>u gay son?</br></br>  Also theres no way normalfags would read a 60 hour eroge VN, lol, unless they're readers and are especially fast at reading. Which a lot of normalfags do not like reading to that extent.  <br><br> not having a cute loli meido that makes your bed <br><br>P L E B<br>L<br>E<br>B</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If Prisma shares entirely people that have seen Fate, then obviously Fate can't be just "normalfags". <br><br>Not ''entirely'' and not ''just''. I feel like you are trolling me. Nobody can be this dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>but fsn has anime porn, and it still has illya<br>i really dont know what you people are on about, it sounds kinda insane to me that an anime porn game would appeal to your typical dudebro</br></br>  <br>If you couldn't tell by the way he writes, don't listen to him. His definition of a normalfag is screwed. He also makes out Prisma to be a series he only watches for his "leet loli hentai" and ignores that the rest of it like the fights are pretty decent.</br>  <br>Pull down there panties.</br>  <br>I prefer to bully anyways<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bmt<wbr>JzjWhcY8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Except Prisma fans probably didn't like that other Fate work, since it has a completely different appeal, such as having edgy murders here and there, a whiny fag male protag who "mans up", and it hating loli.<br>Illya is pretty much the opposite. Even Shirou is better.</br></br>  <br>I have this too.</br>  <br> You are the 1% <br><br>but i have a friend who thinks alike, i guess we're the 2% or something</br></br></br>  <br>Which is why that guy is full of shit<br><br>I was addressing your point on Fate being "casual and entry-level", which you just admitted has a ton of fans who clearly are more than casuals. <br><br>The other point you wee making is that Fate "normalfags" were shitting up Illya threads, which they weren't. And even then, it's dumb as shit seeing Prisma is a subset of Fate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats not how it works.</br>  <br> Outcancer <br>You must be crazy. They are way worse.</br></br>  <br>Nah, liking lolis is natural instinct of all men, especially after they start developing hips and budding breasts. Illya definitely fall into the category that men finds biologically arousing. Except faggots who probably have problems with erection too. <br>That picture is just shit quality lazy work, which I'm angry about too.</br></br>  <br> Shirou never had hot, passionate but hard sex with his   onee-chan <br>This is why reality is cruel.</br></br>  <br>sniff their butts.</br>  <br> lol <br><br>You are the normalfag.</br></br></br>  <br>You are so fucking delusional. Not even gonna entertain your comments about Shirou being whiny and it "hating loli" (what does that even mean? How can you hate loli? You mean the Illya route which was cut due to time restraints? Jesus.)</br>  <br> even having a bed <br><br>Fucking hammocks bitch.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It is casual and entry level. Exceptions aren't examples.<br>And rest assured, the average Fate fag is disgusted in lolis, and it's no coincidence FSN doesn't have Illya sex scene.</br></br></br>  <br> it is casual and entry level <br>yes, but that isn't akin to appealing to dudebros<br><br> and it's no coincidence FSN doesn't have Illya sex scene. <br>because nasu is a lazy butt?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cut due to time restraints <br>Sure. It's interesting that it just happened to be a loli we can't fuck.<br>No, they never even intended on it, Illya is just there for cheap drama and shock value, getting brutally murdered as how teens like it, since she's a "shitty little girl".</br></br></br>  <br> casual and entry-level <br>Define what this even means? A lot of people play it as their first VN? Okay. Doesn't make the series worse off.<br> no Illya sex scene <br>Holy shit I can't even believe you're posting this like it proves a point. You're literally just going<br> lel DFC true otaku XD <br>at this point. And by the way it was cut due to time restraints, not for "not disgusting the audience" like you think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>why the fuck would you want more nasu h scenes, they're fucking dumb as shit</br></br>  <br> I was addressing your point on Fate being "casual and entry-level" <br><br>Thats exactly what it is. <br><br> which you just admitted has a ton of fans who clearly are more than casuals.  <br><br> It has tons of non-casual fan because of prisma and other obvious reasons. That doesn't mean it can't be an entry-level anime. Your whole way of thinking is absolutely retarded.<br><br> The other point you wee making is that Fate "normalfags" were shitting up Illya threads, which they weren't.  <br><br>I never said that. How do you even know they aren't doing that?<br><br> And even then, it's dumb as shit seeing Prisma is a subset of Fate. <br><br>Amd its something completely different at the same time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cheap drama and shock value <br> getting brutally murdered <br>Only happens in a third of the routes, did you even read the VN?<br>You obviously haven't read Heaven's Feel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it was cut because loli is niche, and disgusting for your average teen.<br>I'm not saying only people who like loli are "true otaku", but I can assure you that normalfags don't like lolicon, and are disgusted by the idea.<br>That's the real reason a loli hating franchise decided not to have a route.</br></br></br>  <br>Lie inbetween and cuddle them. Assuming I know them.<br>Else I'll double check to be sure I am in the right house.</br></br>   getting turned on by little girls <br>Pedos, every single one of you.</br>  <br> acting like Prisma is why Fate has a ton of non-casual fans <br>You're fucking insane. It's clearly the VN and Zero.</br></br>  <br>dude, you're not special because you like loli<br>just go on the boorus and look at how many dumb teens post LMAO BEST LOLI EVAR xDDD<br><br>again, you are no special snowflake</br></br></br></br>  <br> VN <br> Zero <br> not for casual <br>Please, this is weak even for a bait.<br><br><br>I've read it, and guess what? Still no Illya route.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or more likely because Nasu is lazy?<br>It's not like type-moon hasn't done sex scenes with lolis, look at Len from Tsukihime.</br></br>  <br>Redditors/mal/other anime sites and americans would flip their shit if the fate anime had a sex scene with illya.</br>  Gag them, tie their hands and feet, carry them downstairs and then tie their bodies around a pole. Rape them.  <br> special snowflake <br>Nobody said that, ever.<br>It still doesn't change the fact normalfags are disgusted by lolis being sexualized. Not to mention if we got to plow her.</br></br></br>  <br>do sleep better on the ground floor rather than on the fourth? how about at sea level instead of above it?</br>  <br>I said ''and other obvious reasons''. That cinludes the VN. <br><br>But now normalfags started playing vns so it doesn't mean all that much anymore.</br></br></br>  <br><br>so? normals are disgusted by anime in general <br>unless we're using some warped version of normalfag, kind of like what /v/ did with weeaboo</br></br></br>  <br>You're acting like liking Zero and the VN instantly makes you a casual. Which is just your shit taste that nobody agrees with. And Prisma is literally the same thing, the only differentiation is that it has loli fan service. <br><br>So what you saying is that the only reason anybody watches and likes Prisma is loli fan service. Which isn't true for majority of people.</br></br></br>  <br>They'd flip a shit if there was ANY sex scene. It's an anime, not a hentai. The VN is different obviously.</br>  <br>Anime is not as niche as to prevent the most casual fanbases from being normals.<br>See Dragon Ball for example. And obviously, FSN is among those fanbases mostly consists of normals.<br><br><br>Exceptions still aren't the rules.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Tie them before they wake up, then procced to enjoy my new toys.</br>  <br> normals are disgusted by anime in general <br><br>Are you living under a rock?</br></br></br>    can you watch this without giving a shit about regular Fate anything?  <br>even if this was true, i still fail to see the problem with having people you dont like liking the same things as you do<br>in the end, why does that even matter and how does it affect you in particular?</br></br>  <br>The point was you haven't provided any solid reason why TM cut Illya route due to apparently hating lolis?</br>  <br> it has loli fanservice <br>And SoL. And cuteness. Actually, aside from the fights, it's the complete opposite of FSN. Which is what I am talking about.<br>And even the fights aren't edgy in the manner of killing off everyone or something, they are magical fights, not murdering people.<br><br>They'd flip a shit if there were Illya sex scene in the VN too.<br><br>And there's a reason why FSN got crazy popularity among the normals, and not Tsukihime's sequel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Go play vidiya gaems or something  <br>i dont think you should really, its pretty much akin to things like carnival phantasm in terms of TM fanservice</br>  <br>Not anymore.<br><br>Fucking garbage like CR and Netflix are trying to make anime socially acceptable.</br></br></br>  <br> You're acting like liking Zero and the VN instantly makes you a casual <br><br>Thats not what he said/implyied/whatever. <br><br> And Prisma is literally the same thing, the only differentiation is that it has loli fan service.  <br><br>Its not even close to being the same thing. Its centered around loli fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude what<br>FSN is like 70% SoL<br>did everyone somehow forget about the cooking?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Go die you spic scum</br></br>  <br>Yes, liking loli is a good reason to watch it.</br>  <br>this nigga knows the comfy life</br>  <br>Having a loli only to be killed in different humiliating ways, and never giving her a route speaks for itself.<br>For your information, kids usually hate little girls.<br><br>The problem is not with those who like FSN and Prisma Illya too for what they are. The problem is with FSN fags that start to post their FSN faggotry and how disgusting pedos those are who enjoy Illya for what it is, not to mention those who spout "secondaries" to people who don't want to read that boring shit VN.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lol where da problem at? xD <br><br>Normalfags like you posting in Prisma thread are the problem.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit this entire post is retarded<br> battles in FSN are only about murder <br>What? And Prisma has Servants who die too, the class cards. <br> They flip a shit if there was a Ilya sex scene in the VN <br>Not they wouldn't. Who gives a shit? Every other VN has that.<br> There's a reason why FSN got crazy popularity with the normals, and not Tsukihime's sequel <br>Yeah, and that's clearly because Fate is the bigger fucking franchise, as opposed to the add-on to the lesser known franchise. Acting like it had ANYTHING to do with a Len sex scene is insane.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course. You're ven better off in a sense.<br>Don't listen to this  faggot. All you will miss are the references to a shitty VN.</br></br>  <br>Thats simply not true.</br>    <br> Not they wouldn't. <br>Yes, they would.<br> Who gives a shit? <br>Normalfags.<br> Every other VN has that. <br>Those are not massively popular with normals.<br> What? And Prisma has Servants who die too, the class cards.  <br>You can't compare to those fights with the murderous intent FSN fights. Class cards are just cards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well all i see is this thread with someone going on about how fsn is shit for being a dudebro vn apparently?<br><br><br>dude, i have autism bucks, does this look like something a normal would own to you?</br></br></br></br>   retards think normalfags don't read Visual Novels <br><br>Aren't there vns on steam? Also, there was a kickstarter for a localized Grisaia. Normalfags love vns if they get an anime. Friendly reminder that they also use the word ''waifu'' all the fucking time.<br><br>Times change.</br></br></br></br>  Commit adultery.  <br>Yes. Yes it does.</br>   NORMALFAG NORMALFAG NORMALFAG <br><br>and you people say you're better than the other boards when it comes to memespouting</br></br>  <br>It's not centered around loli fan service. Maybe in the beginning, and it's a recurring thing, but it's mostly a lot of SoL comedy and battle scenes.<br><br> Kids usually hate little girls <br>How does this apply? Even if you're claiming Normalfags are invading they aren't fucking 12. Don't give me bullshit like "a lot of 12 year olds have read a 60 hour eroge VN and are now shitposting in Prisma threads"<br> normalfags are calling out Prisma for loli fan service <br>Again the<br> lol DFC otaku superiority!! <br>meme. Which isn't true, just accept the fact that not everybody loves DFC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure write and argue like a normalfag, though.</br>  <br> memespouting <br>It's not memespouting if it's used for its intended purpose.<br>Nice try though, /v/.</br></br></br>  <br>uh ok? well i guess im a normalfag then, fuck me<br>you guys should really drop all the memespouting though, for real<br><br><br>you sorta stop caring about dumb memes and namecalling after being here for 10 years</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a law abiding citizen of legal age and I will not act upon my sexual urges.</br>    <br> things are true because I say so <br>Okay. And when has any mainstream anime site get butthurt by loli porn? Nobody cares. Maybe you're Southern Baptist mother does. People will just ignore it if they don't like it.</br></br>  <br>Once again, since you are dense and don't get things. I don't claim that all "otaku" is into DFC or loli. <br>I do however claim that normals are NOT into lolicon.<br><br> memespouting <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  this thread was supposed to be about sexualizing two cute girls in the op.<br><br>everything fucking sucks.</br></br>  <br>Literally /v/ tier shit.</br>  <br> EVERYONE I DONT AGREE WITH IS /v/ <br><br>I've been browsing /v/ and /a/ for years, its always funny seeing people on both boards redirecting each other<br>both are shit anyhow</br></br></br></br>  <br> And when has any mainstream anime site get butthurt by loli porn? <br>Literally every time.</br></br>   prisma fans   <br> fuck off <br><br>can i at least have a sane reply instead of more insults?</br></br></br>  <br> I've been browsing /v/ for years <br><br>Aaaand into the trash it goes.</br></br></br>  <br> someone actually wasted time making this shit MS paint <br><br>Im dead.</br></br></br>  <br>Once you start typing or arguing like a sane person.<br><br><br>This is actually the majority of FSN fags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yet ill still browse it and /a/ like ive been since 2007<br>how horrifying</br></br>  <br> ''LoL I'M NOT FROM /v/!!! <br> I've been browsing /v/ years, <br><br>That explains a lot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> normalfags aren't into Lolis. <br>Sure. That doesn't make any of your claims not blatantly dumb.</br></br>  <br>what's wrong with /v/? its full of shitposting sure but so is /a/</br>  <br> we will never have this in anime <br>Why is life so unfair.</br></br>  <br>And you are absolutely fucking retarded. Congratulations.</br>  <br>oh fuck <br>someone called me retarded<br>on the internet</br></br></br>  <br>I would call the police.</br>  <br>I'm not even trying to pretend I don't watch Prisma Ilya for loli fanservice.</br>  /v/ and /a/ are the same.<br><br>Both board hate normalfags<br>Both board hate mainstream and popular shit<br>Both board have Niggerell and his faggots tripfags friends from foolz shitposting.</br></br></br></br>  <br> what's wrong with /v/? <br> all these stupid arguments <br><br>I will be serious. I really hope you are trolling. I don't want to believe someone could be this dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>drink their toilet water and rub their dirty clothes from the hamper on my cock.</br>  <br>you haven't answered my question though<br>trust me after being here for so long, 4chan as a whole is a mess<br>i only come here when im too bored of anime or video games but i wish i had other things to do</br></br></br>  <br> /a/ hates mainstream and popular shit <br> being this new/stupid <br><br>/v/ please leave.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people do. Most people don't watch for that or are just overall indifferent to it, they watch it because it's another thing in the Fate universe, has pretty decent fights and comedy scenes.</br>  <br>does me getting turned on by girls with flat chests make me a pedophile, anon?</br>  <br>Go back to /v/ faggot. /a/ is not your shitposting dump.</br>  <br>what? what is even the point of your post anon<br>no im not gonna stop browsing a board because you told me to</br></br>  <br>You don't even browse this board, do you? Get the fuck out /v/ermin.</br>  <br><br>Is it really so hard to admit I watch it for loli fanservice, fight scenes and I just love the fateverse?<br><br>why cant I just like those 3 things at the same time?<br><br>Its the same for with mitsudomoe, I watch it for chubby loli fanservice AND the silly misunderstanding jokes, people need to understand that you can watch a show for multiple reasons and they cannot be mutually exclusive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SnK <br> SAO <br> KLK <br> Naruto <br><br>Yeah those are /a/ most loved series ever.<br><br> all the hate for No game no life because reddit loved it <br><br>Just like /v/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I told you guys, UBW has ended, /v/ will be a permanent pest in Illya threads.  <br>You only come here to shitpost, you just said so. Get the fuck out.</br>  <br>there is literally nothing wrong with browsing /v/<br>actually there is, but it's just as wrong as browing /a/ since they're just different flavours of shit</br></br>  <br>Concrete Girl 2.0</br>  <br>Not it's not but there's always shitposters on /a/.</br>  <br> /v/ shitposters can't help but shitpost everywhere they go <br> so they think every board is exactly like /v/ <br>No, faggot. It's you. You're the shitposter.</br></br></br>  <br> all the hate for No game no life because reddit loved it <br>Or because the fucking Madhouse decided they can't sexualize a loli of a source with top tier lewd and glorious loli sexualization?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Being turned on by underage features makes you a disgusting pedophile. You people should be chemically castrated.</br>  <br>where did i say that<br>i come here to see discussions of things, i mostly come to /a/ to look at caps of cute anime girls though since discussions are rarely worth<br>im waiting for fate GO to come out though because that should have some decent shitpost-less discussions like CCC had</br></br></br>  <br>No, there's /v/ermin like you shitposting on /a/. Because you all have the same mentality, where you think you can just act like shitheads wherever you go.</br>  <br><br><br>At first I watched it because I saw Archer Ilya vs Saber fight and wondered if there's more. But then it turned out to be magical girls in Fate, which made it infinitely better, and then Kuro showed up in 2wei and my dick is hard since then.</br></br></br>  <br> SnK <br>People like the manga.<br><br> SAO <br>Its shit.<br><br> KLK <br>Its shit.<br><br> Naruto <br>Its shit. Threads were full of retards and it attracts people no one wants on /a/.<br><br> No game no life <br>Its shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tell me of a bigger shitposter from /v/ that is worse than Nagi, a shitposter from /a/</br>  LITERALLY BUILT FOR SEX  <br>It's not a sin, and it just indicates good taste.</br>  <br>Ok? good job proving my point which was that /a/ hate popular and mainstream shit just like /v/.</br>  <br>I'm not the /v/ guy faggot.</br>  <br>But /a/ doesn't hate those shows simply because they are popular. /a/ hates them because they are shit.</br>  <br>youre fucking retarded and bleed irony; you continue adding to the cancer that is crossboard shitposting but you think youre the slick cunt with all the answers.<br><br>eat shit and die, newfriend.</br></br></br>  <br>one day when you've been here long enough you'll realize all boards are terrible<br><br><br>little brown girls are the best</br></br></br></br>  <br> expert narrative of prior entries <br>Tohsaka's<br>Anus</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone who's not a drone dislikes mainstream shows.</br>  <br>You post like a retard. Its pretty obvious that you are new to /a/.</br>  <br>The same kind of argument /v/ would use for overrated triple AAA games.</br>  <br>Its really fucking obvious that you are a newfag. Just shut the fuck up.</br>  <br>yes yes whatever you wanna believe anon<br>i hope that one day you realize /a/ isn't the high quality board you're deluded into thinking it is though, but hey ive been there as well, back in '05 i used to laugh at the DONATE TO 4CHAN threads</br></br>  <br>So what? I don't know anything about games. I can't tell you whether they are right or not but I'm sure it really depends on the title. Well, I just opened their catalog and the first thing I'm seeing is a thread for that new popular nintendo game and a fallout thread. You are full of shit.<br><br>Those anime you listed are simply bad.</br></br></br>  <br> im le oldfag xD see i mentioned it again <br><br>No one is going to believe you, newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>its ok anon<br>you can sperg at me over nothing all you want, im used to that kinda shit here<br>actually what the fuck are we even arguing about anymore</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's more of a thing where the more popular a show is the more vocal-minority people who dislike it show up. There are a lot of "mainstream" shows on /a/ which get posted about, with people liking them. Although Naruto and shit is particularly known for being bad, they still do have their own threads.</br>  <br>I believe him.<br><br>/a/ is just as bad as other board. Only a fool can't see that.<br><br> 20 recs thread everyday <br> people pretending to be normalfags <br> people pretending to be new to anime <br> people pretenting to hate loli <br> blogging shit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Although Naruto and shit is particularly known for being bad, they still do have their own threads. <br><br>Yes, their own threads full of tumblr, deviantart and /b/ tier posting. Geez, I wonder where those faggots come from !</br></br></br>  <br>is a flat chest an underage feature though?<br>I don't like little girls but flat chests just get me goin</br></br>  <br>To how many other boards have you been? Some are full of Tripfags and some boards even have reddit threads. <br><br>/a/ is like a completely different website compared to them.</br></br></br>  Ass play time!  Prisma Illya will be the chemo /a/ needs for it's normalfag infestation. 2 more days.  <br>We got our load of tripfags here too.</br>  <br>Of course they get you going. You're a pedo.</br>  <br> slut <br> turbo slut <br> granny </br></br></br>  <br>What are you doing in this thread? Fuck off.</br>  <br> thinking cowtits are superior to flat chested goddesses </br>  <br>Only a few, though. You can count them on one hand. Most people on /a/ ignore them or tell them to fuck off.</br>  <br>Oh man I can't wait for all the normalfags telling pedo to fuck off this is going to be so amazing.</br>  <br>Big tits are objectively the most attractive feature on a woman, unless you're a nigger.</br>  <br>u figured me out</br>  <br>That chart doesn't specify big tits. But you're just trying to bump the thread so you don't care.</br>  <br>This only shows that boobs are more attractive than butts. Not BIG boobs. Nice information manipulation there, SJW.</br>  <br><br>Nice try. It just shows how media's brainwashing works.<br>Sadly women with power push breast glorifying propaganda just because they can get "perfect big breasts" without effort.<br>Also, pretty sure that small, well shaped breasts are instinctively more appealing. Fuck off mediawhore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats not saying anything about big tits. Also, its a normalfag chart for 3dpd. It literally doesn't matter.</br>  SHOULD BE SOON  Its like somone saw illya and went<br><br>WE HAVE TO GO DARKER<br><br>AND LEWDER<br><br>OH YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ITS LIKE, WHAT IF WE TAKE ILYA, MAKE HER DARKER AND GIVER THE MORALS OF A MAN</br>  <br>Kill myself for having a pink room</br>  I think this is just too underrated  It went way to far with the magic shit, just give me back the punk teams skating for areas and parts.  The music was still badass tho  <br>It got too shounen. The beginning was amazing though. The anime is still one of my faves just for the fact that it ended before it got into all that super crazy shit. ova excluded of course.</br>  <br>Fucking Oh!Great and his ridiculously escalating storylines that don't even make sense</br>  One of the very few manga I've read through all the way. I still don't understand what the fuck happened at the end though.  <br>It was a cluster fuck.</br>  <br>r u new to shonen.<br><br>Why is this even a complaint?</br></br></br>  <br> shonen = magic <br>You seem to be the new one.</br></br>  S2 never  <br>I agree, it was great in the beginning and they ended on a good note on the anime. I could not finish the manga though because it started getting to be too much.</br>  I don't care what you say.<br>Kururu best girl.</br>  <br>Best shonen ever made for sure, at least way better than Naruto,Bleach and HxH, and at the same level of enjoyment as One Piece.</br>  <br>I would sure be nice if a good studio took it over and made S2.<br>But it will never happen.</br></br>  <br> Kururu best girl <br>That's not Ume.</br></br>  <br>lolicon</br>  Best looking girls ever. Great art. Wonderful concept and world. I love that damn universe. The music was great. Anime made me want more..<br><br>Just wish Oh Great had a real writer because man it was so crazy after Koga were truly on their own.</br></br>  <br><br>This so much. I'll always have a spot for Air Gear because the first several volumes are just so fucking cool. The world, the characters, the concept, it just screams "groovy."<br><br>But it just keeps getting more and more fantastical, until characters are basically brawling it out with super powers just like in any other shounen, except worse because OhGreat keeps pulling nonsense out of his ass. By volume 20 or so I honestly couldn't keep up anymore.<br><br>Still though, the art was fucking sublime, and the setting was unforgettably cool.<br><br>The anime was okay, it had a great soundtrack and if nothing else it's valuable for being able to see Air Trek in motion. It's such a fast-paced sport that stills just aren't enough sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one does.</br>  so many memories... watched it with my sister years ago, one of the first anime shows we watched. after that we hooked up on the manga but i stoped reading when obama appeared, that was just too much.    Ringo a shit. Simca a best.  <br><br>Agreed mx0 went to shit too when it started including magic</br></br>  is ohgreat! doing anything right now?<br><br>all of his works devolve into a clusterfuck but i can't get enough of his art</br></br>  The fucking character designs in this were amazing.  <br>For a long time I thought he was doing Shokugeki no Soma since the art styles are so similar. Did ohgreat! work with Shun Saeki at some point?</br>  <br>Fucking cheater tuned quints.</br>  <br>Quints do not lie, anon.</br>  Its this like jet set radio the manga?  <br>For the first two or three chapters? Yeah, yeah it is.</br>  <br>Nah, it's like Jet Set Radio Future. The manga.</br>  Onigiri was based as fuck.    So much shit happened towards the end I couldn't keep up with all the characters or their names, what the fuck was that dude thinking.          <br>This<br>Kururu a best though</br></br>  <br>For a bit then it just devolves into magic shounen battle manga #529108<br>After a while they don't even really use skates anymore and just sling magic at each other.</br></br>        <br><br>Christ almighty</br></br>  <br> Ringo a shit <br>Damn right.<br> Simca a best. <br>Fucking right<br> 77777 <br>DUDE YOU DA BEAST</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>IMAGINE</br>  <br>How the fuck did a shit like Ringo win da Ikkibowl over Simca? I don't understand it.</br>  <br>Quints spoke the truth.</br>  <br><br><br><br>As fantastical as this series got, I always dug the visualizations they'd do for the special abilities. Like the various imagery for the Regalia roads. Made shit seem cooler than it technically was.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Simca <br> ringo <br> not BASED Kururu <br>I'm still mad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You will never overwhelm a 10/10 slut with the sheer aura of your perversion. </br>         read the manga <br> made sense <br> somewhere down the line started to have no fucking clue what is happening <br> kept reading it because the art was incredible <br>please someone tell me u have that page where it shows akito or that girl that looked like him with the amazing butt</br></br></br></br>  <br>Time for Buddha!</br>  <br>I think that's how it went for everyone.<br>Last part I remember that I think I understood what was happening was the fight on the airplanes or gliders or whatever the fuck they were</br></br>  Reminder Air Gear did it before it was popular.  <br> There is no need to be upset. </br>  <br><br> read the manga <br> made sense <br> somewhere down the line started to have no fucking clue what is happening <br> kept reading it because the art was incredible <br>Every single reader.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even sluts can be reformed, if Onigiri shows them the way.</br>    <br>How is this guy not one of the most successful manga artists? It's fucking criminal that he isn't doing anything right now. Air Gear's art was amazing.</br>  Also, Ton-chan best girl.  <br>I mean I liked regalias in concept but they shouldve been more grounded and not too outlandish<br><br>overall yea the "magic" did ultimately push the manga into the point of no return of trying to top itself every chapter</br></br></br>  I loved the anime.<br><br>How much longer is the mange? Is it finished? Can someone spoil it for me?</br></br>  <br>You can't spoil something you don't understand</br>  The anime sucked donkey balls. The manga at least has that amazing Oh!Great art, and even how retarded it got in the 2nd half, it's still a manga worth reading in my opinion.  <br>It's finished. Ikki and Ringo go fight sora in some big ass tower/missle and win because Obama</br>  found it  <br>Forgot, Kururu best girl.</br>  Mikan's episode in 5 hours<br><br>Episode 03:<br>Part of the chapter 02<br>Chapter 03<br>Chapter 04<br>Part of the chapter 08</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When you're that transparent, it takes all the fun out of it.</br></br>  holy shit. What a bitch.  <br>she's just pretending</br>  <br><br>How the fuck can shiragami have such a cute voice?</br></br>  <br>Because Shiragami herself a cute.<br> CUTE! </br></br>  I want to protect that blush.  <br><br>Who is this cute boy?</br></br>  Is Riu just stupid or a literal retard?  <br>Once he's a literal  corpse  next episode, that won't matter anymore.</br>  <br>But he did the right thing.</br>  <br>No. He was just super optimistic and naive.</br>  <br>Well, it was either that or giving VAPE the pretext to actually start killing people.</br>  <br>And now he has shown them that they can basically demand everything. Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes?</br>  <br>When you think about it, it reinforced people's disdain and hate for VAPE, making the red-haired guy's plan less likely to succeed.</br>  <br>No? He was portrayed as the good guy. Even if he dies (and he won't die), he'll go as a well beloved martyr and vape will be the bad guy.<br><br>Didn't you see the obvious OPINION-SHIFT on the people which were all turned against Vape? Rui's nobility touched them.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Whatever Rizumu does now, he'll lose. Rui put him in a no win situation.<br><br>People will no longer support him and he comes across as weak willed psycho who breaks his ideals while Rui comes across as too pure for this sinful world who is strong in his ideals. <br><br>He's just cornered and made himself everyone's hateful enemy not to mention he assaulted someone LIVE. He can be arrested with evidence now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Too bad he is about to be burnt to a crisp by Tsubasa  <br><br>I just finished the first season of this and it was very good, how is the second fairing up so far?</br></br>  This anime is why you should kill anyone that vapes.  <br>It hasn't really gone anywhere yet, Hajime gets some unusual focus cuts to imply that maybe something is wrong with her and the new Gatchaman is a qt hothead.<br><br>It's fun though, new OP is great.</br></br></br>  <br>This. There's a reason hostage negotiations include having snipers ready to take out the hostage taker.</br>  Do you think Joe was 100% right?  <br>Joe is always right</br>  <br>Why didn't Joe die in the first season?</br>  <br>He got his note tore off, but Katze didn't stab it.</br>  <br>Will he die this season at least?</br>  <br> joe <br> The guy who is always proved wrong <br><br>Anon... when the antagonist and joe make a point, expect it be the opposite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is about RuiRui suffering, not Joe. Joe gets the happy ending.</br>  <br>Because female audience would drop it.</br>  <br>Joe is my least favorite character and the show would improve for me if he died  I'm a grill btw </br>  <br>Joe needs more Bird Missiles for a happy ending.</br>  <br>OP has amazing visuals.<br>ED is not as good as the previous one but passable.<br>First episode was a good first episode. <br>Second was more exposition heavy.<br>And now we got to the Rui suffering in half the time of the previous season!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Joe is always right. If Joe saids the sky is green then the sky is green.</br>  <br>i hope he die</br>  <br>This, Rui is pretty much series' messianic figure, of course he'll be proven right in the end, Joe is just some capefag wannabe.</br>  <br>If he does die it would probably be near the end because he is one of the more popular characters (according to pixiv anyways). Maybe he is still depressed deep down but not enough to be suicidal. Joe is the only male eye candy so the female audience might go down. Carrot doesn't count because he is a cunt and Rui is eye candy for both genders.</br>  So who sponsored all the tablets they were giving for free to everyone?  <br>Except he's not entirely right.</br>  <br>That reminds me of some experiments in social psychology.</br>  <br>As much as I hate carrot, he does have a point. There are good people and there are shit people. Something Rui doesn't seem to understand. Joe doesn't really want to be a messiah. He just wants to protect people. He doesn't seem to like much attention. Out of all the gatchas he is the one that appears less in public. Joe understands that there is evil people out there. I don't know how the show is going to prove Rui right.</br>  <br>Well you have to use the public funds for SOMETHING</br>  <br>It's the power of being attractive</br>  <br>Rui is naive in his idealism but carrot does not have a point. Crowds are a tool just like any other. A bad person can take a knife and go stabbing spree, a bad person can take a car and drive it into a crowd, that's not a reason to ban knives or cars. <br>There is always a risk, it's simply a matter of pros outweighing the cons.</br></br>  <br>Me too. I hate cross dressers like him.</br>  <br>You won't be able to anon. We all know what route Tsubasa will go.</br>  <br> his accuracy with the darts matches how accurate his words are <br>DEEP</br></br>  <br>The show already proved Rui right last season, when him giving out the crowds to everyone didn't turn into a massive bloody clusterfuck. You can either love or hate how optimist the show's worldview is, but it's part of the suspension of disbelief. Hajime has that worldview too (the boys who won't give up their seat on the bus are probably tired, the wife of the man who was speeding with his car had just gone into labour) and she is always shown to be in the right.<br><br>Anyway, Rui has clearly looked up Rizumu and deduced he couldn't have been that bad (in fact, if he really were evil he would have gone along with Katze's plan as soon as he had his chance), so it's not even about Rui naively believing that there are no evil people.<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm not sure. What other motivation could they have?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Senran Kagura is the best Gatchaman.  So did Rizumu not have the balls to use his Crowds right away, or was he just not interested until Rui's idealism rubbed him the wrong way?  <br>Maybe he was busy studying. <br>I'm pretty sure he is a decent person who snapped, possibly after losing someone to the incident in Tachikawa. (How long have the red crowds been active, anyway?)</br></br>  <br>I don't get it that's what I said. I mean Rui believes everyone is good deep down in their hearts which is not true.</br>  <br><br><br>Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you. That's the basis of their concept. <br><br>Rizumu destroyed his credibility to have a point when Katze cheered up for him and became a knife-wielding psycho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity. That's why villains are always attacking him or try to corrupt him. His resolution and his pain are important for the outcome of all. First season, it was about Katze and Hajime tug-fight for Rui, this one Rizumu and maybe Tsubasa join the fold for it.<br><br>He's like the mecha pacifist princess, only male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joe can do no wrong.</br>  <br>Alcoholizing Sugane was pretty wrong. Remmeber when Sugane was an earnest diligent boy. Now he's a drunkard.</br>  <br> mecha pacifist princess <br>All he is missing is a song, but I think the White Ash lead singer's got that covered.</br></br>    <br>Why is Utsu-tsu the most underrated girl on the show?</br>  <br>Hajime is way more of a senran.</br>  <br>Word<br><br><br>It's good because Sugane enjoyed it. Joe can't do no wrong. Sugane knows Joe is best boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tsubasa will fuck Rui. <br><br>Hotblooded hero mc gets peace princess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish, but<br> Crowds <br> romantic development <br>Choose one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have enough dick to please Rui.</br>  <br>She's more manly than anyone in the cast. Even Paiman is girlier.</br>  <br>Because if they tried that shit again, then it's no longer the Gatchaman's fault for any other deaths that occurred. No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. Now it's up to Vape to prove they can honor any other agreements from that point on. And until then, it would be no quarters from everyone else.</br>  <br>Hotblooded hero mc who fucks up the peace princess Honorable Sacrifice doesn't deserve shit. <br><br>Anyway Sugane and Joe saved Rui first, Tsubasa needs to respect seniority.</br></br></br>  <br>No, not really. The moment Tsubasa intervene, he won. Now he can say he meant every word he said, but because the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations, they are the ones that broken the agreement. They are the ones that can no longer be trusted. Any further deaths will be on their heads now.</br>  <br>Hajime needs a tragic backstory to be a Senran</br>  <br> No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. <br><br>But Gelsadra absorbed everyone insight and they were against Vape.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sugane and Joe have each others.</br></br>  <br><br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br> Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity <br>Where was this said?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sugane feels the need to apologize for everything he does <br> Joe turned him into an alcoholic <br><br>Nice and healthy.</br></br></br></br>   mfw Rizumin and Tsubasa have reversed eye/hair colors   <br>That's because no one has died yet and they haven't learn what the full details of the discussion. If someone had died and Rui could have prevented it, it will cause massive backlash. They all saw Rui willingly give away his Note, that means he accepted whatever deal VAPE has proposed. Now that the agreement has been ruined by Gel and Tsubasa's intervention, they now share part of the responsibility for any other deaths.</br>    <br>Fuck, it's true.</br>    <br> the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations <br><br>I doubt stabbing somebody to death is "negotiating"</br></br></br>  <br>You should have found the back of Sugane's head for good measure.</br>    <br>Being manly != having a dick</br>  <br>Rui willingly gave him the Note and told the others to stay away. Rizumin's plan probably required someone to come and stop him since he knows if he actually stabbed Rui to death through the Note, it would only make him into a martyr and spurn the populace into fully adopting Crowds. Rui and Hajime probably knows this and didn't interfere because they know Rizumin can't follow through with it for the reasons above.<br><br>By having someone come and intervene, no matter how it looked, they now share responsibility in any eventual deaths as well as prove that just because Rui believed in him, doesn't mean other people will. The same applies to the Crowds system. There has to be trust between everyone for it to function properly.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, if Rui could call lying in a pool of his own blood a "fight"...</br>  More Rui suffering next week?  <br>Maybe next time he should communicate his plan with the rest of the team.</br>  <br>It's not like there was much time. The rest of the team should trust him to make the right decision and respect his wishes.</br>  <br>From Tsubasas perspective it did look like he was dying for nothing.</br>  <br>Tsubaka.</br>  <br>Never discuss about Symphogear and Gatachaman at the same time.</br>  <br>Utsubasa.</br>  <br>When OD, Hajime and Rui all say not to interfere, it's a good sign that you shouldn't interfere. But I think that's the point they're trying to make. Both Hajime and Tsubasa has a tendency to rush into things, but one does it based on logic and reasoning while the other based on instinct and emotions. It's a nice contrast between the ideology between the two heroines, while providing a parallel to Rui and Rizumin. There's no right or wrong ways, just different ways of doing things.</br>  <br>O.D. had *just* finished explaining everything to her.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways <br>I get what you are saying, but even if you act on emotions and instinct alone you still need to respect other people wishes. Especially if it's your first day on the job!</br></br>  <br>Will Rui´s elephant say "Tuskete"?</br>  <br>And ultimately, she was prepared to accept the responsibility of defying other people's wishes. OD told her as such and she accepted. She couldn't stand suffering, even if it's the logical thing to do. Kinda like the sacrifice one to save many mentality. Logically, it is a good trade-off, but she just can't accept such a sacrifice and willing to bear the burden of saving that one life.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways, <br><br>But in the end Rui's way will be the 'right way'</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, in the end, it will be a compromise. Rizumin will become co-admin of the Crowds system or something.</br>  <br>Probably but next episode they are going to portray her way as bad.</br>  <br>Doubtful. It's a bit too early for that. They'll probably raise Tsubasa and Gel on a pedestal for a while for saving Rui's life and ask why the other Gatchaman didn't help. Build both of them up as the true saviors before having them come crashing down and causing Gel to turn evil in the process. Then understanding and hand-holding happens, and suddenly everyone fights as a team and an understanding ending occurs. Oh, and Katz probably goes crazy at one point because someone had hurt Hajime.</br>  <br>Why would Katze go crazy about someone hurting Hajime?</br>  <br>Because it's clear that he likes her. He's a massive tsundere when it comes to her. No amount of his bullshit works on her, she saw him in his real self and still accepted him. It's true love.</br>  Next episode is called 2-6-2, so we'll probably hear more of Rizumu's ideas.<br><br><br>Agreed. It works with the presenter saying he liked the two of them and with the titles of the episode being marketing terms (or so I've heard?)</br></br></br>  <br>2:6:2 is what, a bell curve?</br>  <br><br>I think so. First time I've heard the term.</br></br>   2-6-2 <br> Under the Whyte notation system, a steam locomotive that has two leading wheels, six coupled driving wheels, and two trailing wheels. <br>Wait what? Probably not it.</br></br>  <br>The thought of Katze being protective of Hajime instead of delighting in her suffering and the world burning around her is dishearteningly boring.</br>  <br>They're essentially the same person though. No one will be able to understand them more than each other. He might want her to adopt his viewpoints, but losing what amounts to his soulmate? Never.</br>    <br>I can't tell if you're a retarded troll or a just a retard.</br>  Is Rui transgender or just a crossdresser?  <br>Just a crossdresser.</br>  <br>Hajime called him a boy and he didn't correct her.</br>  <br> Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes? <br>Hajime.</br></br>  <br><br>Creators confirm he's just a crossdresser. I think OD's gender is unconfirmed though.</br></br>  <br> O.D was born and raised on a distant planet between a native and an Earth human. O.D gained their NOTE through some unknown event. One day, Berg Katse appeared and had the people of O.D's planet turn on each other. O.D found Katse and fought him in their Gatchaman form and while they managed to damage Katse, they ended up destroying his home planet. Katse had thought that O.D was dead when they really just went to Earth.  <br><br>I guess I really should finish S1</br></br></br>  <br><br>I always thought OD was just a gayy lmao.</br></br>  <br> &gt;O.D was born and raised on a distant planet between a native and an Earth human. <br>So there's other humans in space? What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Maybe it was a Gatchaman who traveled.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways, just different ways of doing things. <br>What you say is correct but it doesn't mean you're right.</br></br>  <br> red crowds and blue crowds? I don't care, I just want to protect everyone even if that doesn't answer your question! <br> he's fighting for his principles? I don't care, I just want to protect everyone even if it makes his sacrifice completely pointless! <br><br>Truly the worst Gatcha. Does that everyone she wants to protect include Rizumin? Because if it doesn't she's just a hypocrite full of shit that only wants to save people she handpicks. That's not really everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Truly the worst Gatcha <br>Joe is a faggot but at least he has a reason to exist. Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change.</br></br>  <br> Joe is a faggot but at least he has a reason to exist. <br>What reason? Make Sugane an alcoholic?<br><br> Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change. <br>Sure. There wouldn't even be a S2 because everyone would be dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Utsutsu is OD's daughteru. He needs her.</br>  <br>"Utsuutsu shimasu" is an extremely important line, you know.</br>  <br> Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change. <br>True, but that would be a terrible decision. Plus, Hajime got some cool dialogue from scenes with her.</br></br>  <br><br>Also be sure to watch the ep0.<br>Looks like they had to fit (again) 15 minutes or so of extra content outside the 12 eps to make things clear.<br>At leat they did it in advance this time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still have no clue about how that single line gets subbed with tons of different meanings depending on what people are talking about.</br>  <br> What reason? Make Sugane an alcoholic? <br>Sugane's character in general (including making him an alcoholic), and getting beat up like a bitch by Katze.<br><br> Sure. There wouldn't even be a S2 because everyone would be dead. <br>I can't actually remember any time she healed another Gatchaman. The only scene I remember of her using her healing powers for some practical purpose was the one in the tunnel from S1.<br><br><br><br><br>I don't really hate her either, she's cute, but she's also by far the most useless character. It's like she exists only because they really wanted a loli in a swimsuit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last time it was because they didn't have it ready on time, not because they ran out of time.</br>  <br>She healed O.D and Joe and is pretty obvious she's the one healing others in the background. She'll probably save Rui from certain death too. If you think Joe is useful for Sugane's development I don't understand why you can't see Utsutsu was good for other character's to see Hajime's influence, like O.D or Joe. Joe was motivated by Utsutsu wanting to help others with her life in the tunnel.</br>  <br>She exists to show how Hajime changed everyone and also to, you know, heal Joe, Sugane and eventually Rui after they were beat up by Katze? That tiny little turning point of the season.</br>  <br> because they didn't have it ready on time, not because they ran out of time <br>Those are the same thing.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Running out of time means 12 episodes weren't enough, they needed more. Not having the episode ready on time means they could have done it in 12 episodes, but they didn't have the episode ready when it was due so they filled half of it with a recap. If they came up with episode 00 that suggests 12 episodes weren't enough for Insight.</br>  <br>Correct me if i'm wrong, but wasn't ep12 of S1 a regular 20-ish minutes one? <br>Because then either they planned to get a longer slot and didn't get it/have the content ready on time or they actually underestimated the runtime of the plot they planned.</br></br>  So is this episode the reason Rui's shadow is X? I don't expect him to die, but maybe he'll become more integrated with X?  <br><br>The impact Hajime had on her was far smaller than on most other characters, and I don't think Joe was really motivated as much as just empathetic towards her. I guess healing people in the background is a legit feat though, a bit plot device-y but definitely important.</br></br>  They ran out of time for the animators to actually animate. Tatsunoko Pro has really shit schedules. Did you guys miss half of the animation for the Yatterman Night finale being missing and the animators apologizing on Twitter and telling people to wait for BD?  <br>Geez Hajime, how does your director allow you to have two frames in the opening?</br>  <br>It was regular length. They didn't have ep 11 done in time, so they added a recap for half of it. This pushed half of 11 into 12, so there had to be a director's cut so we could see what was supposed to be in 12.</br>  <br>OD seriously puts my straightness to the test.</br>  <br>MmmmmMMmmmmm it's almost like she is not alone in there</br>  <br>The other anon explained it all. In order for episode 12 not to be cut off completely they tried to fit in as much as possible by cutting bits here and there but it was worse that way in my opinion. Everything was confusing and some of the international releases don't even come with the director's cut so there's people who never watched it. It would have been better to try to get another timeslot for it later on or release an OVA and end episode 12 with a cliffhanger.</br>  I want to leave it to Sadra  <br> Did you guys miss half of the animation for the Yatterman Night finale being missing and the animators apologizing on Twitter and telling people to wait for BD? <br>No, but that didn't have any holes in the plot that will need extra content, it's just that they didn't make in time with all the needed cuts and had to work out with what was avaible.<br><br>It's kind of strange to think the same Tatsunoko delivered a nearly flawless YZQ just few months after Crowds S1 and a year before Yatterman.<br> Tablets magic <br><br><br><br>I see, i completely forgot about the recap in ep 11.<br> It would have been better to try to get another timeslot for it later on <br>Just as Kekkai Sensen then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I actually really like Tsubasa.<br>Am I the only one?</br></br>    <br>Hell no you aren't. Where'd you get that idea.</br>  <br>She needs to get a bit of her shonen protagonist hotheadness sorted out, but otherwise she's alright.</br>  <br>Unconfirmed-gender aliens are fair game. I'd do it.</br>  <br> Joe  <br> not looking at Sugane like he just spiked his drink <br>The style reminds me of Kinako but there's just no way.</br></br></br>  <br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br><br>Does this have something to do with Rui being Gatcha 100 and Hajime Gatcha 101?<br><br>Maybe anybody after 100s is suppose to be a new kind of human.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hajime gives Rizumu her Note with Katze inside and then Katze drives him insane by his endless shtitpost. It's a perfect plan.</br>  <br>is this some kind of new BD cover?</br>    <br>Where'd you get it?</br>  <br><br>Found it: it's from kinako's twitter : https://twitter.com/kamabokoita<br><br> Guy that I was thinking the cover of the old wants Design Works Once old folder watching  <br><br>I think it's one of the first sketches for the Design Works cover</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>OD is confirmed as non male by the director. When he's asked what sleepwear and what underwear do his male characters wear, he mentions Rui's and Katze's (with Sugane's and Joe) but omits OD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, her ero Twitter is locked. What a shame. I wonder if she has porn Gatcha art there.</br>  <br>Interviews.<br><br>When first season started, Rui and Hajime were called "new human beings" that heralded the future.<br><br>Before season, they explained Rui's symbolic role and why Katze and Hajime basically fought over his heart. When he chose to believe in himself, the plot solved itself.<br><br>Right now, Rui's not believing in himself, despite his actions, because he got troubled and isolated from the Gatcha and there's a new antagonist who is unsurprisingly predatory on him. They'll always be predatory on Rui because he's the one who holds the key to the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guy that I was thinking the cover of the old wants Design Works Once old folder watching  <br>My sides.<br><br>"I get nostalgic when I look at old folders. I was thinking about the Design Works's cover at the time"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  <br>I always thought they were so predatory on Rui because he looked like such a perfect rapebait fuccboi that even straight males don't care.</br>  <br>...Close enough.<br><br>Thank you!</br></br></br>  <br>What sleepwear DO the guys wear?</br>    <br>Utsutsu had an arc in the first season, she's also OD's daughteru, and has lesbian love with Hajime and potential straight love with Rui.<br><br>I'll be mad this Tsubasa bitch replaced her.</br></br></br>  <br> those hips <br><br>How can a boy have those hips?</br></br></br>  <br>That's purposeful. Rui was female originally. He's always been the show heroine among the heroes.</br>  <br>The song that plays when Rui's alone and Katze is creepy on him is a song of a leopard stalking his prey. No shit.</br>  <br>They are predatory because Rui's role is of main heroine. They just changed his gender.</br>  <br>My moonreading abilities are still green but if it helps, I couldn't ask for more.</br>  <br>I can't believe OD ditched based Baracchi for that green fat faggot.</br>  Friendly reminder that green faggot will have part of the blame for Gelsadra taking over humanity.    <br/>  Tsubasa is right  <br>This is "Why couldn't you protect this smile" in gif form.</br>  <br>The eye twitches are so good.</br>  <br> blood not changed to white color <br>Why did I even expect anything good?</br></br>  <br>This scene deserves a webm, not a gif.</br>  <br>I'm sure OD knows the dude is a cunt, he's just there for show.</br>  <br>Hes such a bad trap you can always tell its a boy no mater how many tricks he uses. <br><br>But doesn't that oddly also make hing a far better trap?</br></br></br>  <br>Anon i would do it if the scene didn't make me feel so uneasy... Actually i'm surprised nobody has done a proper webm already.</br>  <br>The fact that they had released pic related as a promo picture a few days earlier made everything that much sweeter.</br>  <br> No matter how many tricks <br><br>He's actually not using many. One of the first rules of trapping is hide your manshoulders and he always has them out. I think he just dresses how he likes without regard to how well he's passing or if others can tell he's a boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Rixumu/Tsubasa confirmed<br><br>Tsubasa/Rui anon BTFO</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Rui and Rizumu have the same birthday and same powers.<br><br>Other Shippers BTFO.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>rui is so fluffy looking</br>  <br>He seemed surprised when Hajime referred to him as "-kun" when they first met. <br><br>So yeah, he is trying to pass off as a girl, but because the whole fucking world knows he is a boy by now he doesn't really give a shit</br></br></br>  Tsubasa and Gel-chan will "save" the day at the cost of Rui's ideals. Tsubasa and Gel-chan will explode in popularity and MIRIONE SHOE will capitalize on it. Tsubasa and Gel-chan will be everywhere and people will begin relying on Gel-chan more and more. The VAPE conflict will be escalating at the same time and it will become more violent. Gel-chan will become a dictator to maintain order "because that's what everyone wants!" and Tsubasa will be in the middle of the conflict.  <br>His manshoulders also change in size between one scene and the next.<br><br><br>He looked very nice in this scene.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wasnt expecting tsubasa's gatchaman suit to have a himecut  <br><br>didnt look that way in the opening</br></br></br>    <br><br>If you insist.</br></br>  <br>OD is genderless.</br>  <br>Thanks, anon. Have a Kinako Bane.</br>  <br>I love Tsubasa's voice but she also voices such dumb girls. She will fuck it up majorly. Unless Gel fucks her first in the sexual way.</br>  <br>Do you happen to have those interviews around? I'm interested in reading those or anything about the earlier concept.</br>  <br>Tell me about Rui, why does he wear the wig?</br>  So do they refer to Gel Sadra as -kun out of respect, because she's some genderless alien like OD, or because she's a trap?  <br>1 or 2. She's not a trap.</br>  <br>Option 1 or 2, but 3 is okay if you want to shitpost and get people riled up.</br>  <br> 2:6:2 <br>Apparently it also refers to something in locomotives called a prairie.</br></br>  <br>Q: Please tell us what are the G Members’ best swimsuits!<br><br>A:<br><br>Hajime: A colourful and cute swimsuit with frills.<br><br>Sugane: The school designated racing swimsuit.<br><br>Joe: Surfer pants.<br><br>Utsutsu: The bikini she normally wears.<br><br>O.D: High leg boomerang swimsuit.<br><br>Rui: Pleated bikini.<br><br>Paiman: Can’t swim and thus has no swimsuit.<br><br>————————-<br><br>Q: Please tell us what the male characters’ nightwear and underwear are!<br><br>A: I’ve received confirmation from Director Nakamura.<br><br>Sugane: Nightwear is a t-shirt and sport short pants, underwear is low-rise sports briefs.<br><br>Joe: Has no nightwear so he either sleeps as he is or in the nude, underwear is branded high class low-rise briefs.<br><br>Rui: Nightwear is high class yoga wear, underwear is cute briefs.<br><br>Katze: Has no nightwear because he doesn’t sleep, doesn’t wear any underwear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> underwear is cute briefs. </br>  <br> Joe: Has no nightwear so he either sleeps as he is or in the nude <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br> Katze: doesn’t wear any underwear <br>Slag.</br></br>  <br> Utsutsu: The bikini she normally wears. <br><br>Is Utsutsu a poorfag?</br></br></br>  <br>She probably wouldn't even have that if it wasn't for Earth's social norms.</br>    <br>What does Utsutsu even do in her free time? Where would she even get money? Utsutsu is a mystery.</br>  <br>She works at the park. Takes care of the plants.</br>  <br>Speaking of money, where does Rui's come from?</br>  <br>Ad revenue from CROWDS?</br>  <br>Oh, that's really cute.<br><br>She probably just doesn't care about swimwear or fashion norms then.</br></br></br>  <br>GALAX microtransactions.</br>  <br>Beach episode when?</br>  <br>Apparently he know Japanese, English and Chinese so maybe he is actually a chinkfag?</br>  Latest episode really stepped up its game and reminded me of what I loved about the first season. I'm glad to see shit finally going down.  <br>She's a volunteer at the park so she probably doesn't get paid for it. Maybe OD spoils her with cute swimsuits.</br>  <br>His current income should obviously come from the Galax app. As how he got the money to set the whole network up i would guess, considering the whole Batman parallelisms going on, that he got the richies from his ded mom and dad.</br>  <br>And you're not understanding that Katze and Hajime were never against each other. They are parallels to one another. Both are the same type of existence, which is to say none at all. Prior to their fusion, both of them are catalysts, they rarely do anything for themselves and fixated on influencing the people around them. Both of them manipulate people, Katze does it through subversion and lies while Hajime does it through encouragement and trust. They get people to do things that further their own end goal (Katze is destruction and chaos while Hajime is creation and unity) while getting enjoyment from seeing their goal being met. <br><br>In fact, had circumstances been difference and their positions switched, I believe it would've been Hajime conquering worlds by forcing everyone in a single mindset and purging all negative emotions while Katze saving his world by instilling chaos and individuality into the populace. It would've ended in a similar way to episode 12, with Katze probably shoving Hajime into his loin or something. <br><br>They are too different from everyone else. No matter what they do, no one will be able to fully understand them than each other. Watch, as the series continue, they will bring up even more parallels between Katze/Hajime and Rui/Rizumu, and how despite their differences, they are incredibly similar.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She ought to get paid. Imagine how much you could accomplish with your clones.</br>  <br>But what is Utsutsu? It's a difficult question because Utsutsu is impossible to describe. One might ask the same about Gatchamans. What are Gatchamans? We just don't know.</br>  <br> Utsutsu is impossible to describe <br>I can tell you she's gloomy.</br></br>  <br>So the logical conclusion is for Rizumu and Rui to "fuse?"</br>  <br>But Utsutsu means gloomy. So you're just describing A by saying it is A.</br>  <br>she doesn't even look gloomy anymore, for the other gatcha member atleast we know their names but utsutsu? is that her real name? what's with the "Miya" before her name on the official webpage?</br>  <br>Pretty much. It's inevitable that some sort of fusion/merger/understanding is going to happen between the two. Going by their arguments, both aren't wrong. Like Katze and Hajime, they're both going to realize they aren't against each other, but parallel. They can both 'win' if they just compromise and work together.</br>  <br> OD <br> not wearing one of these <br>I reject this reality.</br></br></br>  <br>A high-leg boomerang is a great choice. Maybe his alien dick or lack thereof can't accommodate that suit.</br>  <br> That thing <br>What the hell. What would happen if you popped a boner?</br></br>  Reminds me that time Teal'c told a joke in stargate    <br>Thanks anon, I can't stop laughing at the thought of OD casually wearing that next to the other gatchas.</br>  <br>I think volunteer suggests she doesn't get paid but I'm sure they didn't think too much about it. They're lucky she's not greedy.</br>  Do we know when the OP and ED singles come out? ED really grew on me this week because of how perfectly it went with the end scene.  <br>Best trap indeed.</br>  <br>I can't find the original scans, but someone posted a translation.<br><br> Depicting new heroes in a world that is very close to reality <br> When this work was being created, the theme of "What kind of heroes are needed in the present day?" was established. To answer this, would it necessary to depict the present by setting the story in a real city with a social network community that had spread through it? Because of this, a city was chosen for the setting and GALAX was created. Tachibana was chosen because of its wide area disaster prevention base, and so it was possible to portray a miniature version of Japan. <br><br> Design concept of the new Gatchaman suits <br> Although the planning was done before the live action Gatchaman, the old work had been made, and so from the start we wanted to distinguish them. When creating them, to emphasize the supernatural powers of the Gatchaman, we ventured to discard a sense of unity and show powers and personality with the designs. Elements of the old work were included, such as Sugane being a Gatchaman Fencer and Joe being a phoenix. <br><br> Gatchaman's old enemy! The new Berg Katze <br> In Gatchaman Crowds, Berg Katze is the invisible ill will on the Internet, the symbol of unexpected disasters, and a representation of the internal conflict of impatiently wanting the world to change. The question of how to face him, a being using violence and not directly negotiating, is part of the idea of "the heroes needed in the present day" that will be developed. <br><br> Former protagonist Sugane and former mascot Paipai <br> At first, Tachibana Sugane was the main character when the story was being developed, but after the director Nakamura said"From now on, won't the ones improving society be women?", Ichinose Hajime was created to personify the heroes needed in modern times. In addition, Paipai, originally the mascot character for comic relief, became a self-appointed leader, an amusing middle mannager who couldn't make decisions. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tell me /a/, why doesn't Rui wear any panties?  <br>He's wearing cute briefs. They're just riding up a lot at the moment.</br>  Is the budget higher? I swear this season has a lot more action scenes than S1.  <br>Underwear would get in the way of penis.</br>  <br>Not really, his goth loli outfit is a by the books how to trap 101<br> chocker to hide neck <br> corset to achieve a more feminine frame <br> fluffy skirt to hive the illusion of wider hips <br> Belts on tights to give the illusion of softer tights <br> boots to cover muscular calves <br> biceps high arm fingerless gloves to hide man hands and man arms <br>whoever did his design did his homework on how to trap<br>The colors are also well chosen, black on long and wide areas, red on small ones, this makes it harder to actually see his lines while makes you focus your attention to the red and smaller areas, he even paints his nails red while wearing this outfit to take your attention even more from his masculine parts<br>Not covering his shoulders is not that important when his shoulders aren't wide to begin with, even without his get up his whole body frame aint that masculine to tell the truth</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't unsee her wig as some buff roid muscle arm. Fuck.</br>  <br> her </br>  <br>see <br>he wears slut pantsu, they don't show that well unless you lift his skirt</br></br>  <br>He's wearing a thong.</br>  <br>How can he walk around in that? Rui is so shameless.</br>  <br>he is cute and got the dough to be able to not care about what other thinks about him</br>  <br>He's got nothing to be ashamed of.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, Joe is dirty, I bet he is one of those that walk around naked at home.</br>  <br><br>See this kind of shit is why everyone wants to rape him.</br></br>  <br>Everyone wants to rape him because he's sexy.</br>  <br>It is possible for most people to think someone looks good without wanting to rape them.</br>  <br>It's possible for someone to look good without showing it off to most people.</br>  <br>Thank you! I was able to track the thread down thanks to you. I'm also realizing now I was in the thread the scans were first posted but didn't save them back then. I would really appreciate it if someone still has them and would be willing to share, all I could find were these tiny samples.</br>  <br>I don't think the shadows mean anything, Pai doesn't even have one.</br>  <br>oh god, "The Dog's Nose Dripped."</br>  <br><br><br>Rui is a mecha Princess. <br><br>He's rich because he created Galax and X from scratch. He self taught himself English and Chinese.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Katze-san. How lewd. (instead of sleeping I bet he used to draw dicks on Rui's cheeks)</br>  <br>Yeah, I regret not saving them before. That page is actually mostly readable. If you have the other pages, could you post them?</br>  <br>Indeed I do, I'll post them. The parts that were translated are all somewhat readable but it would be really nice to have these in better quality.</br>  <br>They're from the 2013 October issue (released in September) of Newtype magazine, in case you're wondering.</br>    <br>These two are a two-page spread.

If it's pronounced with a hard J, the faggot should have spelt it that way.</br>  <br>What's a hard J?</br>  <br>Demonio de semento</br>  <br>And Dr Seuss is pronounced Soice, what's your point?</br>  <br><br>Both pronunciations are equally valid, dumb dumbs</br></br>  Creature Type UMR.  <br><br>Technically you're correct, as that's what the Oxford English Dictionary says according to that article, but it's fucking Graphics Interchange Format. Graphics is pronounced with a hard G. Why would the abbreviation switch to a J sound? The creator is clearly an idiot. Maybe an idiot savant, but still an idiot.</br></br>  <br>Me on the right</br>  Like many other living creatures, domestic hamsters in Japan underwent serious mutations following the second Fukushima disaster, affecting genes responsible for their metabolism. This eventually caused the animal's phenotype to change significantly.<br><br>A mutant hamster of this type, known as a "Flesh" among otaku, is one of the clearest examples of Japan's perversion of nature. The hamsters have developed a protective layer of scales and bones, their regeneration potential grew significantly and their nervous system became more complex. A side benefit of this mutation are their enlarged eyes, which can see in a greater spectrum of light and has olfactory receptors within (in layman's terms, the flesh can smell with its eyes).</br></br>  <br>ASAP is pronounced "ay-sap" even though as is pronounced "æs"<br>That's not really an argument. The letter g can represent both sounds, and the creator of the word defined which of the two sounds is to be used. Sounds pretty cut and dry to me. You don't just go pronouncing "giant" as "guy-ant" because you fucking feel like it, do you?</br></br>  <br>and he loves his imouto</br>  <br>Good vid.</br>  <br><br>Don't feed the shill. And it wasn't a good vid. Both of you should get out.<br><br>Probably the poster samefagging anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Spunk Skunk  <br>What? I liked his vid, is that so unbelievable? Christ, you autistic cunts need to calm the fuck down.</br>  <br>You have a nice voice but you should just stop with this shit. Go on twitch and make money that way. I'm sure there are some gay sugar daddies that will give you money if you talk dirty to them.</br>  <br>Thank you, I try<br><br><br> "Someone likes something I don't like, must be samefagging!" </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not a bad argument, but no matter what the creator intended, most people have been pronouncing it with a hard "G" sound since forever. Language is determined by usage over time, not by the person who invented the thing the word is describing. <br><br>Anyway if both are deemed acceptable by the OED, then both are acceptable. That really is fairly cut and dried.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Shilling your youtube channel on /a/ is against the rules, not to mention obnoxious. Also if you are going to do video anime reviews, at least learn passable Japanese pronunciation. Or better yet, don't do them at all. <br><br>But whatever you do, advertising doesn't belong here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>u a faggot son</br></br>  <br>Literally kill yourself, you fucking faggot.</br>  <br>I liked his video and probably wouldn't have seen it if he hadn't posted it. What, you think other anime youtubers like sexkik and demo-senpai didn't occasionally post their videos here and there before they got big? You faggots are so fucking paranoid about advertisement and recommendations and so forth that it's a wonder how you even function as human beings.</br>  <br> learn passable Japanese pronunciation <br>You don't have to pronounce a foreign work's name to be able to review it.<br> weeb <br>But I agree. No Advertising on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pronouncing something correctly doesn't make you a fucking weeaboo, it means you put more than absolutely zero effort into your hobby.</br>  <br> You don't have to pronounce a foreign work's name to be able to review it. <br><br>You do if you don't want to sound like a mouth-breathing retard.</br></br></br>  <br>He's posted the video several times in multiple threads, with no justification other than 'hey give me views'. <br><br>He's advertising, and that's against the rules. It's not complicated</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Homo.</br>  <br>End yourself faggot</br>  <br>"Weeb" was a joke mimicking people who overuse the word. Sorry for the confusion.  Sarcasm can't be conveyed through words. <br><br>Do you sound like a mouth breathing retard if you mispronounce the name to a Chinese dish when recommending it to any friends you may have?</br></br></br>  <br>Still no<br>Also it can be pronounced either way</br></br>  <br>Mankgas.</br>  <br>Oxford man.</br>  <br><br>If you are presenting yourself as someone who knows enough about Chinese cuisine to review restaurants, then yes, you do.</br></br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br>    <br>He said himself that this was the second video he made on anime to an audience of 300 people. In YouTube terms, this is like reviewing two Chinese dishes to your friends and saying to anyone who asks: This is good/bad.</br>  <br>Oxford also recognizes fo shizzle as a word.</br>  <br>It was used. It's as much of a word as "thou".</br>  <br><br>Good, Snoopspeak is god tier.</br></br>  <br><br>Look I'm not going to keep debating this with you. Why are you defending the faggot? Reviewing something you can't even pronounce the title of or names of main characters in makes you sound like a moron. Hands down. If you disagree, then you are likely a moron as well.<br><br>Either way, mentally deficient or not, advertising your youtube channel on /a/ is not only frowned upon by the community, but actually against the rules. It rightfully should be pointed out, mocked, reported, and hopefully deleted, with a ban issued for the poster.</br></br></br></br>  <br> americans pronounce j as ch <br> americans pronounce jesus as cheesuz </br></br>  <br>I'm not defending him, I'm defending my opinion that you don't have to be able to pronounce a name of a work to review its plot or entertainment value.<br> You're a moron for having a different opinion <br>Fantastic.</br></br></br>  Japanese gobrin.  <br>You don't technically HAVE to watch something to review it either. You don't HAVE to do anything. He's not saying the guy HAS to do it, he's saying he SHOULD do it, because it sounds awful otherwise to anyone who's actually heard Japanese (read: your target audience).</br>  New, in a sense. I have seen a few anime and have a friend that's suggested some good stuff, but I want to branch out from one persons tastes. Open to pretty much anything, I've liked stuff like, Mirrai Nikki, Angel Beats! and Baccano. Ty~  <br>You are the same guy that made that apple and recs threads.</br>  Nausicaa  <br>??
