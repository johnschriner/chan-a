People don't care that she is.</br>  <br> humans <br> can't breed with any small species <br> giants and large species are all okay <br>And here confirmed once more that the author really doesn't like small girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I read that as <br><br> It's stuck in my butt!

Lizard</br></br>  Your Suu has become dehydrated.<br><br>What liquid do you refresh her with?<br><br> And what effect does it have on her biology/personality? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, they're more reptilian.</br>  <br><br>Shouldn't she be drowning? Or was that retconned out?</br></br>  <br>Well she has nostrils and a mouth.</br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>HEY GUYS LOOK I DID IT AGAIN AM I OLDFAG YET<br><br><br>Well there's the explanation. I think Germanic kobolds lay eggs so that's prolly why.<br><br><br>WHY, SEMEN OF COURSE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Centaur accepts rape <br><br>As expected of a slut.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she doesn't stay in the water for long. She tries to put up with it to be with darling, but then she cashes out.</br>  <br>Her entire book lung is submerged though.</br>  <br>I honestly believe that Cerea's horse part looks great.</br>  <br>Miia would be the depressive kind.<br><br>Papi would become the Flash.</br></br></br>  <br>You stupid furfag, do you really think that everybody is accepting of your disgusting shit?</br>  <br>Cola.<br> She becomes SUUUUUUUUper </br></br>  <br>Every time</br>  <br>I honestly believe  that it should've been a lighter shade. You know, like most horses? She should've had white fur. </br>  <br>Judging by what had been seen in thread so far, yes.<br>Why would you not accept the glorious Polt ass?</br></br>  <br> White fur Cerea <br>There's a thought</br></br>  <br>Horses are big majestic creatures, mostly stupid and easily frightened, but big and powerful creatures.</br>    <br><br>When you are up to your neck in water, your entire set of lungs is submerged too.</br></br>  <br>Because I'm not a furfag?</br>  <br><br> wet horse <br><br>Probably smells terrible</br></br></br></br>  <br> Trash can rattles <br> Cerea freaks the fuck out <br> "SHOW THOU SELF!" </br></br></br>  <br>EMBRACE THE ASS</br>  <br>Please contain your hatred for when someone posts an actually disgusting furry.</br>  <br>I see Miia as the drunk singer and Manako as the mean drunk. Cera could be the sick type I guess</br>  Polt butt is best butt<br><br>You cannot deny</br></br>  <br>Nose is fine, her other facial features are also human so she is definitely not a furry.<br><br>A snout and an animalistic facial structure is what makes a furry.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Especially seeing as she bathes at least once a day. The only time horses stink is after long rides and that's mostly due to the saddle blanket being on them for hours trapping the sweat and heat on their skin.</br>  <br>Horses actually do have some form of beauty in there figure they look sweet and kind but are really powerful when they need to be just like Cerea.</br>  All this talk of horse pussy girl makes me wish I had screenshotted that post on /adv/ where a guy talked about fucking one of the horses on his parent's ranch when he was 12.  <br>I'm not trying to argue or anything. I was just curious if they retconned it after the group bath scene in one of the volume openings.  is a good enough answer for me.</br>  <br>Move away faggot</br>    <br>Why should I? Papi's got a good butt, Suu has a bigger butt, Lala's got a nice ass, HORSE PUSSY too... really, the list goes on and on.<br><br><br>But Polt IS a disgusting furry. The animal nose is what does it. Shouldn't you be wandering around with your trip off trying to rally hatred for the lack of Papiservice?<br><br><br>The nose is the killer. Pigsnout, beak, whatever, it's too much. You people really are stupid if you think that doesn't make her a furry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As much as i like Cerea the most you should just go to /mlp/ to know all about horses.</br>  Booty call!  <br><br> You will never get to spend time in a warm hot-spring with Miia, watching her enjoy having her body-temperature raised and having to stay vigilant and watchful for what she might do with her tail to you under the surface of the water <br><br> Then again, Darling won't get to experience this either. At least not without Cenrorea the walking cock-block raining on that parade, or Papi mucking it up somehow. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Lala's got a nice ass, HORSE PUSSY <br> Polt IS a disgusting furry </br></br>   Cerea has a baby <br> YOUNG SPAWN FROM MINE LOINS, THOU HAS BEEN BLESSED WITH YONDER CRIB! BEHOLD! THE MOBILE! </br>  <br>I wanna wash Cerea</br>  <br> Polt is not acceptable, but full-on animal vagina is. <br>Nothing to see here folks. Move along.</br></br>  <br><br>why is her womb there? She's got the body of a horse the womb wouldn't be there.<br><br>2/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cry more, you wish your gf had an ass like Polt.<br><br>I bet Polt has to be careful during anal lest she clench to hard and cruss her bf's dick</br></br></br>  Darling name tier<br><br>Darling &gt; Honey &gt; Husband/Hubby &gt; Master (horse pussy) &gt; Dear Sir &gt; Master (jello pussy)</br></br>  <br>Yeah? I emphasize with the human face Cerea obviously has.<br><br><br>See? This is why I can't stand you furfags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Behold, the only instance Cera is considered flat</br>  <br>Bigger != better.<br>That's a horse you're posting for all intent and purpose.<br><br>Not bad, but I can deny it, as Papi still has the best butt.<br><br> for the lack of Papiservice? <br>Truth to be told, I've seen much worse adaptations in that regard. Just think ViVid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pffff</br>    <br> Doesn't like Polt's ass <br> Likes HORSE PUSSY <br>Damn, it's times like these where I wish I had some popcorn</br></br></br>   "Darling, come quick, Papi's learned a new trick!" <br> He walks into the living room <br> Suddenly you hear a wet frrrt noise <br> eggs start pelting his face </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128100224 <br>Wow i haven't heard that one before so original</br>  <br>It shows how naive Cerea is<br><br><br>Nigga are you serious<br>You just said that horse ass is nice but ostensibly insulted someone for finding an anthropomorphic animal attractive</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Miia would be the depressive kind. <br><br>"Did you know.....before all thesh whores showed up........Darling and I....we shpent every day together.....and he cooked me eggsh....<br>Every day....<br>And now....now ish all gone.......I want to go back to that time.....I want to..."[suddenly passes out on the bar-top].</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Darling's laying in bed <br> Slowly he wakes up <br> he hears clicking, clopping, sliding, wheels creaking, flapping and glooping <br> He walks down to the kitchen <br> Fridge is empty </br></br></br></br>  <br> That's a horse you're posting for all intent and purpose. <br>Wrong again, LRD.<br><br> Truth to be told, I've seen much worse adaptations in that regard. Just think ViVid. <br>Yeah, but you were doing that earlier. Just go back to doing that instead of trying to spread your furry-loving shittaste. You've reached a new low for me, LRD, and that's sad.<br><br><br>Yeah, I like a centaur and not a furry. Is there a problem with that?<br><br><br>See above. See<br><br><br>There's no goddamn animal nose or snout on Cerea. Stop trying to equate her with Polt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too pure to know how baby making works. She doesn't know the raw power her pussy holds.</br>  Sorry to interrupt again; here's the rest of the new Hitomi!  <br> She vomits up four whole eggs. </br>  God damn why is Darling so attractive?  <br>The horror.</br>      <br> that first panel <br><br>Shit I shouldn't have opened it, I actually got into this now.</br></br></br>    <br>Papi's not a Poultry, though.</br>  <br> There's no goddamn animal nose or snout on Cerea <br>And there's no animal body on Polt, you furfag.</br></br>  <br>Only one was her real egg.</br>    <br>There's a goddamn snout on her, you putrid furfaggot. Keep clinging to that delusion, you've just managed to add another layer of patheticness for me to mock at, as a guy who likes loli. I'm out of here.</br>  <br><br/></br>  Why the fuck is she so cute fucking hell i can't stand it.    <br>It'll be better without a furfag like you here.</br>   Drunk Lala <br> "Hey...Hey you...

Check AP if you're part of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump  <br>Its legit</br>  <br>Isn't this just Episode Sabo? What's the point of having that if it's gonna be in the main story anyway. So there'll be an Episode Sabo and then the same thing in the main anime?</br>  <br>At least we'll see some Dragon. A montage with the Revs would be fun too. Kinda like the Donquixote pirate flashback montage. Hope they explain why Sabo wasn't able to make it to Marine Ford.</br>  <br><br>Another fillershit chapter</br></br>  <br> world building and character development <br> filler <br><br>I bet your favorite arc is Enies Lobby</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was anticipating a Sabo flashback chapter but didn't expect it to be now.

It's Bellamy</br>  <br>Franky what the fuck is that face?</br>  <br>Bellamy HYPE<br><br>it's happening</br></br></br>  <br>his face turned terminator after his fight with senor pink</br>  People really need to stop hating on sabo so much.

It isn't really that big of a deal.  <br>Sabo looks like he's ready to kill them all<br><br>Crazy Adorable Motherfucker</br></br></br>  Who is healing Luffy Law, Kyros, and Bellamy?  <br> no chapter next week <br>damn. hurts every time.</br></br>  <br> Bellamy as Usopp ammunition <br>Pls Oda</br></br>  <br>nobody was hating on him just now?</br>    <br>It's time for Oda's monthly sex with his ugly wife</br>  <br>Doesn't look like the usual first page spoiler, but then again we're a day early.</br>  <br>Only speedfags and Marineford babies hate Sabo.</br>  Why does this fucker say dasuyan all the time? It's fucking annoying.  <br>I think he mean people mad the whole chapter is his.<br>I'm kinda bummed redone get to see what Fuji does, what Burgess does, etc, too.<br>But I think a full Sabo chap can reveal more about dragon and such so its overall good</br></br></br>  <br>Huh I guess I stand totally corrected on that.<br>Good question then</br></br>  <br>HE'S THE WORST MEMBER<br>OF THE DOFFY CREW</br></br>  <br>Are Bellamy's teeth still fucked up?</br>  <br>It's a fake accent.</br>  <br>I mean, I think people were expecting a Sabo/Rev chapter sometime during the post-arc stuff so not sure why they'd be mad. I didnt really see any angry reactions either.</br>  <br>You can see in the spoiler he is missing at least one</br>  <br>Go onnnnnnn</br>  <br>Can anyone translate the glyphs?</br>  <br>Well fuck. I mean I know the flashback is more for the reader than the characters but is nobody going to listen to Sabo's story?</br>  <br><br><br>poor bastard is probably gonna have a lisp from now on</br></br></br>    <br>I don't know if I still want to fug him if it's going to stay that way.</br>  <br>aparently Franky, Zoro, and Robin are.</br>  <br> Zoro completely unscathed <br><br>he's gonna have a hell of a fight in Zou</br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's night time already. It sure has been a crazy day in dressrosa. And we still had no idea what happened to sanji and the rest.</br>  <br> Franky's face so fucked he can't hear too well <br> Zoro doesn't give a shit <br> Robin already knows all this <br><br>lol Sabo is fucked</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aww it's like they're having a sleepover.</br>  <br> think <br>Luffy would not care and Usopp would say the very same thing marine fodders were repeating about how crazy infamous Luffy's brothers are, it's ok if only Zoro, Robin and Franky hear what Sabo has to say.</br></br>  <br> bartobell <br><br>is there more of this?</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy would not care <br>when it comes to sabo? i think he would</br></br>  <br>maybe at the end of the chapter we will get luffy trying to call sanji on den den and it not working?</br>  <br>All I can tell is Franky says, "Slamma jamma my nigga. Yo all done look all fucked up...."<br>Then Ace proceeds to say, "Bitch ass white man dun got me real good like 3 arcs ago. Fuckin white fish bowel head nigga taught me once fo being all whitey and shit. I aint dun gon goofed once when this big ass nigga with tats all up on his face fished me outta sea and gave me some nice lessons on getting that ass all nice a fresh and..."<br>Thats it on that page.</br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't Luffy care? His brother happens to be alive and he's going to talk about why he wasn't there for Ace and how he heard about it.<br><br>Luffy would probably be interested in that.</br></br></br>  <br>No way is Fujitora messing with that home squad. He may have left the island already.</br>  <br>Not much.</br>  <br>Nope, Zoro will roller coaster all of his fights until Kaidou swordman, and even then I don't really see Zoro being as injured as Luffy ever again, Oda ruined te character for me.</br>  <br>Dude you should talk to mangastream about being a translator.</br>  <br>get out</br>    <br>ill take what i can get<br><br>much appreciated, anon</br></br></br>  <br>A character is ruined for you because he got stronger? what the fuck</br>  <br>I'll put in my application right now.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128099895 <br>well then good luck with that</br>  <br>so Mansherry does not heal them huh?</br>  <br>People in different areas of Japan say different words at the end of their sentences as part of a regional accent. Like how Canadians stereotypically say "eh?" all the time. Oda takes opposite sentence endings from different areas of the country, combines them, and makes interesting fake accents. <br><br>Dasuyan is a combination of Osaka's "-desu", which you use when stating something factually, and Kansai's "-yan", which you use when asking a question. <br><br>Neptune's Jamon, Jora's Zamasu, and Bastille's Dara are like this too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Bellamy was the most rage-inducing character back in Jaya, and now he has his own little fanbase. Who would've thought.<br><br>All the more reason why Caesar can and will be next strawhat.</br></br>  <br>Kinemon will wreck Zoro when they duel, Zoro will only win from plot armor.</br>  <br>No problem. Not related but I like the image.</br>  <br>Kinemon isn't that strong.</br>  <br>what's the point? So they get healed and then return to their hurt state? Might as well just sleep it off.</br>  <br> Bellamy invited to the sleepover but not Barto.  <br>Why.</br></br>  <br>I liked him back in Jaya because he was a douchebag.</br>  <br>nice Terminator reference Oda</br>  <br>How do you know? Kinemon didn't do shit.<br><br>His Dofly disguise was great 10/10 though.</br></br></br>  <br>Storywise an omnipotent character is boring, this is why Usopp was a 10/10 in this arc. When was the last time Zoro was in bandages after fighting another first mate/second in command? Daz Bones?</br>  <br>Ok thanks for this and for the 1:1 translation of the spoiler you provided here:<br><br>We'd be stuck waiting without you anon.</br></br></br>  <br>only her dandelion thingy heals temporary, her watering can heals permanently</br>  <br>What does jamon mean?</br>  <br>Kin'emon is fucking Brook-tier<br><br>he wont be able to touch Zoro. The mystery samurai that he and Kanjuro were travelling with might be stupid strong though</br></br></br>  <br>How are you so sure he's not underneath the bed holding Luffy's hand</br>  <br><br>Check em</br></br>  <br>it's ham in spanish.</br>  <br>who's on the bed with Luffy and Sabo? Usopp?</br>  <br>Robin pls keep this haircut</br>  <br> Kinemon isn't strong because he's goofy and humble <br>Yea you are a retard. He has not redacted his duel proposal even though it harms his country if he loses, since he should seek out the strongest want swordsman to get their legendary blade back from zoro the thief.<br><br>It's more logical to conclude that he IS the strongest swordsman in Wano, and protecting the royal blood heir Momonosuke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Combination of Akita's "-jya" (old man speak) and Kansai's "-damon" (childish speak).</br>  <br>Hmmmm<br><br>I feel like we're forgetting something...<br><br>Like there use to be other members of the Straw Hats....<br><br>Nah, the Straw Hats have always only been Luffy, Zoro, Ussop, Robin and Franky.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kin'emon can use black Haki, maybe you mean his torso is above Brook level.</br>  <br>Sabo and Law dont like Romeo<br><br>Only Luffy and Zoro would have a problem with Bellamy but clearly Luffy has adopted Bellamy into his sphere of protection and Zoro does whatever Luffy wants</br></br></br>  <br> Zoro didn't even ask Brook to help him cut steel but Kinemon yes <br><br>Brook is even worse. No haki, his speed can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse, skeleton body can't take much damage. Nigga should fight with music hax like Apoo.</br></br></br>  <br>Kinemon owned Brooke easily with no head and no legs...<br>Also Brooke isn't weak.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>The power of dubs says new crew member.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he's been fighting weaker characters since post-timeskip. We've seen him struggle with Fuji, so we know he's not all-powerful yet. I suspect he'll get a real challange during the Wano/Kaido arc.</br>  <br> no Moocy <br><br>I guess</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really see the point of Brook being another swordman, a sorcerer or some other shit would have worked better.</br>  Bellamy is at the SH sleepover but Barto is not.<br><br>THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT. I'M WAY MAD!!!</br></br>  <br>Zoro was left for dead unconscious KOd by the yeti cool brothers last arc, but I still agree with you he needs a hard fight.</br>  <br>Brook ran off because he was creeped out though<br><br>I'm sure that's officially a 'defeat' but they havent gone all out</br></br></br>  <br>Brook is a bard with some swordsmanship.<br><br>He mostly will just sit around playing music to buff the party.</br></br></br>  <br>He is the soul king, he is just also competent with swords.<br>His music is his #1 weapon.</br></br>  <br> can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse <br>Literally what.</br></br>  We need Brook to be more like Apoo.<br><br>Damn Apoo is one cool fucking character.</br></br>  <br>He directly stated<br> too strong! <br>Before he ran away. Of course he was scared, a torso swordsman was coming at him like a demon and he could barely defend himself.<br>Vs Doffy Kinemon did as good as Zoro or arguably better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;too strong! <br>scan?</br></br>  On a side note, there's a mistake in one of the panels.  Alright guys it's speculation time.<br><br>How is Sanji able to escape from a yonkou and Capone for half a day?<br><br>My guess is that Mom actually got Ceasar and Capone is trying to retrieve him.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Kyros can grow legs! Starfish zoan!  <br>Law fixed him</br>  <br>Sanji already said he wasn't giving Caesar up. So if BM has him then Sanji and co. surely went after him<br><br>alternately, they could just have sailed out of range. No way in hell is Big Mom's ship any variant of speedy</br></br></br>  <br>But they showed Capone and his possy at least near Big Mom's ship. Saying alright guys lets get this Ceasar dude.<br>So I'm assuming Ceasar is at least close to Big Mom's ship as well.</br></br>  <br>perhaps they were pursuing from a distance</br>  <br>That would be super anticlimactic.<br><br>Like Oda shows Sanji the the rest in no danger whatsoever being all like "wew that was close, good thing we had cola"<br><br>Although it makes the most sense to how he managed to survive for so long.</br></br></br></br></br>  Has any devil fruit user hacked his powers to an extent comparable to Kuma?  794 Sabo's adventure<br>Doflamingo lends his sunglasses to a Flamingo<br>(but hiding his face from the readers)<br><br>FUCK YOU ODA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are Bellamys legs. Look at his arm. Most likely turned in his sleep.</br>  <br>Shanks so strong he can swim even with his devil fruit.</br>  <br>This is manga streams translation.<br>In another it says "too strong" and in all of them the point Brooke makes is that the torso is scary and incredibly strong.<br><br>Seeing as it was just a torso, and that this is post skip Brooke, it is only reasonable to consider Kinemon as <br>Very strong.<br>Oda intentionally keeps him out of serious fight scenes so far to hide this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Belamy is obviously the guy in the middle..</br>  <br>Whoops wrong pic<br>To argue that Kinemon is "brooks tier" when he was owning him like guy um a did but without a fucking head and wit joint legs, and adding on that he engaged Doffy better than Sanji and zoro (rescued law), is fucking stupid.<br><br>He challenge Zoro and he is strong enough for it to be a real challenge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious Kinemon is a beast.<br><br>I mean the fucker was able to overpower brook without even being able to see. He probably was just fighting on reflex or something.<br><br>Also he can speak with his farts.<br><br>As to how he could hear form his butt. That is still unclear to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're D's after all</br>  ...And we were all having a great time. Until these two faggots showed up.

WELL WHO'S LAUGHING NOW.<br><br>" Not me </br></br>  Dropped  Picked up.    Man how quick do people think the fanart machine is going to start going with this?  <br>Not really that well. It's a sausage fest, but character designs isn't exactly what Fujos want. and also manlet army.</br>  PV: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Idd<wbr>xplDVGw8</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Idd<wbr>xplDVGw8</wbr>  [ ]  <br> manlet army. <br><br>Levi is a manlet too just to let you know.</br></br></br>  Confirmed higher sales than g-rekto and age.    <br> Okada <br><br>Wure, why not.</br></br></br>  <br>Xeno was great.</br>   everyone assumes Gen will write new gundam <br> instead it's the only person who could possibly fuck it up worse </br>  They should let Aoki Ei direct gundam.  Okada is making a gundam?<br><br>And there are shotas involved. Have they been warned about Okada?</br></br>  <br> AGE <br><br>Not much of a feat.</br></br></br>  Polygon time?   there are people posting on this board, right now, that will defend this after it's shittier than people already expect   <br>So basically they are hashing Valvrave + MS 08th + Gundam X + 00. Wonderful.<br><br>Just bring back Seed. Jesus said he's be back right?</br></br></br>  <br>This is what we get for not buying more G-Reco BDs. I miss Tomino already ;_;</br>  <br>I should have supported Try more instead of shitposting that it's not as good as GBF. REGRET</br>  <br>From the PV, it doesn't look bad. The Mobile Suit designs are cool (except maybe the piston waists), the characters look look alright and the setting doesn't seem too out of the ordinary.<br><br>It's all left up to Nagai and Okada. Which sure, no one has faith in them, but we can cross our fingers and hope.</br></br></br>  <br>You know I wouldn't have cared, but since they showed us the PV before I got all hyped because it looks and feels like a good Gundam series. Even the main Gundam looks great. But then they announce these two and I know they're going to throw all that potential down the drain. I hope I'm wrong though.</br>  <br><br>M3 was great.</br></br>  <br> M3 was great </br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  I'll summarize the story synopsis:<br> It's 300 years after the last great war <br> old governments destroyed, new governing parties on earth <br> there is a colony on Mars and a girl named Cordelia Aina Vaughnstein (?) wants to have it self governed <br> manlet is part of a civilian security company (CGS) and gets tasked to escort the girl <br> CGS gets attacked by Galhorn(?) whose purpose is to prevent the revolt <br> CGS uses the iron-blooded orphans as decoys to escape <br> the leader Orga gets pissed at the company and decides on a coup d'etat <br> manlet is tasked with driving away Galhorn and takes the mobile suit serving as CGS' power core (It's the Gundam) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please.</br>  <br>It wasn't, but I like Okada's general style.</br>  <br>Better than Taniguchi+Butcher tbh</br>  <br>you and maybe 5 other people think that</br>  <br>Olga is the leader of the kid's, not the company. I'm tired, there's probably more mistakes.</br>   Okada   <br><br>Gundam Cycled</br></br>  <br> Confirmed higher sales than g-rekto and age. <br> M3 <br> WIXOSS <br> Nagi </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was entertained by the series, I guess I like it too.</br>  <br>Yeah, nope. I'd rather take Butcher's 'fuck seigi no mikata' drama over Okada's drama. Since it's Gundam, you can be confirmed that Butcher will at least chuck in some kool operator shit.</br>  <br>I don't.<br>Tomino and G-Reco can fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Except you're dead wrong.<br><br>This is Nagai + Okada. Therefore it will sell. Plus the bishonens getting all hot blooded for fujobucks.</br></br></br>  <br> anohana <br> toradora </br></br>  <br> Okada career is finally dying <br> now she gets the mega job </br></br>  <br><br>We need fujobucks to fund the next Tomino Gundam.</br></br>  <br>I feel like Okada can do a beginning well. There's always interesting setups. After that, it's a complete mess. There's often too many things trying to be resolved at once and they're usually done improperly or not at all.<br><br>Perhaps it's due to others on the staff or other constraints but it always seems to go this way from the anime she's worked on, at least the ones I've seen.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are people that will have also shitposted it to death long before it even airs so it all balances out.</br></br>   We'll never see Tomino, Okada,and Kawamori working on the same project   <br><br> This is Nagai + Okada. Therefore it will sell </br></br>  <br> What is Toradora? <br> What is AnoHana? </br></br>   inb4 one episode worth of battles <br> the rest is just high school girl drama <br><br>Yes. YES!</br></br></br>  <br>Anohana is her only original to break 10k. But who knows how this would sell.</br>  <br> What is Toradora? <br>Sold less than G-Reco retard. Also a shitty drama is different from mecha</br></br>  I for one look forward to Okada saving anime.  <br>It's not just the height. They're too 00s for fujos. Not pretty enough.</br>  <br>It's already got a boost with the Gundam brand name attached.</br>  <br><br> M3 <br> Xenoglossia <br><br>You've already lost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the fucking point idiot. I'm talking about it selling and Toradora sold 10.3k which is more than G-Reco. Do your research.</br>  After this Okada will be a household name and the Wixoss movie will sell millions  <br> angry manlet MC <br><br>Reminds me of Shingeki.<br><br>In a bad way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Xenoglossia was Nagai<br><br>M3 was Okada<br><br>This is Nagai + Okada. All the anime they've done together have made over 10k.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually the best thing to happen in my life.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br> I'm talking about it selling and Toradora sold 10.3k <br>Wrong again dumbfuck</br></br>  <br>Geez that's guy-heavy</br>  To be fair the new Gundam setting feels a bit like Mad Max.   Director: Nagai Tatsuyuki <br> Series Composition: Okada Mari <br> Character Design: Chiba Michinori <br> Music: Yokoyama Masaru </br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind the character designs, except maybe the silver haired guy in the back.

But there are some genuinely good ones out there.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, right? I can't tell the difference between bad Japanese voice acting and good, shit all sounds the same for me.</br>  <br>Denial. Denial is how they deal with it. That and/or ignorance. The reason Disney's are generally the best dubs available is due entirely to them hiring actual actors as opposed to acting industry rejects. Literally, the entire American English anime voice acting industry is full of people who started in either radio or theater, and when voicing local radio proved to be a retarded deadend job (shocker) and when the steep competition of having to actually act to be a successful actor proved too demanding, they turned to whatever job they could get to help keep the income flowing. No, not "voice acting" that was filled by standup comedians transitioning into film and TV gigs. The tiny desperate struggling anime localization projects who barely had enough money to cover their repackaging and translator fees were the ones who would actually hire them. Then even when that industry sort of took off (then crashed, then sort of took off again) the scene was small enough for the companies to stick to the model they started with, which was under paying their actors, effectively keeping their budget to a minimum while ensuring no real talent would ever be desperate enough to stoop so low as to accept the subpar wage.<br><br>The one exception is of course, Disney, because John Lasetter's pet project rainday penny jar is bigger than the entirety of the American anime market.</br></br></br>  <br>When did I say anything about "liking" them? SAO's the only really exceptionally bad one. Also the 1989 Akira dub is the one that sucks dongs. 2001 is better.</br>  <br>I don't think you even understand the nature of the problem. No one's complaining about "realism" in the acting, it's about "appropriateness" as is always the case with acting. There's nothing inherently bad about exaggerated or cartoonish acting, but it has a time and place.

Latin American dubs at least try by getting voice actors that already had considerable experience in their field (it helps that a lot of them don't limit themselves to anime, they do voice work for spanish dubs of western movies, TV shows, etc)</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Surely, if you're a "big" enough fan to buy an English dub of an anime (either from funimation or a retail store), you most likely already have watched some anime on the internet in Japanese via Crunchyroll. Would companies like Funimation and Sentai really lose that much profit if they decided to stop dubbing and simply localize/distribute everything but their largest of shows? Even if they did lose sales, wouldn't it be counterbalanced by the reduced costs of localization?</br>  <br> Hey have you heard of this underrated show Another??? <br> MUST SEE ANIME MOVIES: It's all Miyazaki with like one Shinkai <br> anyone know where I can watch this show dubbed? legally please! <br>Never again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex really wants to shove her in everything too.</br>  <br>I'd imagine they've run the numbers on this, as they've been doing it for decades. It's profitable, to be sure.</br>  <br>Truly the worst kind of people.</br>  why does anyone give a shit if someone watches dub or sub. watching either one supports the already faltering industry  <br> le pepe images must all be deleted, no exceptions!  <br><br>I hate these new janitors to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br> I watched the dub for Another, it was ok. </br>   MC is played by Todd Haberkorn   <br>I seriously don't understand how you can claim to be a big fan of something as relatively niche as anime and refuse to watch it subbed. It's fucking mind boggling.</br>  <br>I don't believe you.</br>  <br>He's outdated. Bryce is the new Todd.</br>  I accidentally watched some of Monster dubbed because I couldn't get the subs working on my tablet, what do anons think of it? I didn't mind it aside from Johan's airy girly voice, but then I watched subbed later and he sounded exactly the same in Japanese.  <br>It is not possible to post a meme and not be shitposting at the same time.</br>  <br>You have Dubs and dubs.<br><br>Dubs are done well enough to be called "good" by a majority of poeple that actually like anime (See: no one on /a/). Anime that fall under this category are most movies, ghost in the shell, cowboy bebop, and space dandy.<br><br>Then there are dubs which are so bad you realize within the first five lines that its a quick attempt at a few bucks from newfags that want what they think is a hottest newest anime. Shows that fall under this category are shows like Master of Martial Hearts, every single dubbed hentai, Railgun, and anything done by funimation between 2003 and 2014.<br><br>Anime watcher tend to come in three types, subs only, subs and dubs, and weeaboo. What generally happens is a person will start as a weeaboo, then eventually go subs-only because they believe its the purest form to watch an anime in. Then they, or at least most, eventually grow up and realize that they can like anything they want when they remember that no one elses opinion matters. Most of a/ watches subs and dubs, but subs-only is the status quo as a general filter to keep newfags from coming in and asking stupid questions about shows that are airing in their country several months or years after everyone else watched them.<br><br>Most dubs are bad, not because japanese voice acting is good, but because when you watch a show in japanese first, you set what the voices should sound like, then when you watch the dub the voices dont sound the same, so you default to "its bad". There are plenty of dubs that are bad in their own right, like Railguns, which anyone with more than 100 shows under their belt would notice right away.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There are good dubs and good dub actors, the problem is that they are generally more inconsistent in quality of voice acting and casting than the Japanese.  <br>Yeah, the general level of voice work in anime is a disgrace compared to regular films. Even if you compare cartoons to cartoons, in ancient looney tunes a one man Mel Blanc show was as far away from anime dubs as Broadway is from elementary school plays.<br><br><br>The worst is when there's a song in English and I end up reading the English subtitles anyway.<br><br><br>I don't see a need for it aside from shows that will air on broadcast TV.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From a buyer's perspective, what's the point in buying it if you already watched it subbed on a simulcast stream? Unless it comes with something extra and/or in the extremely rare case that it's good enough to rewatch subbed in non-streamshit quality, why bother?</br>  <br>How retarded do you have to be for this to be a legitimate problem?<br>Shit excuse, subs are always superior.</br></br>  <br>Perfect, I just love it when my cute little girls sound like soul-drained hags who've given up on life.</br>  <br>Raildex dub wasn't bad until Kuroko showed up.</br>  <br>They should all be deleted. At least the janitors are getting one thing right.</br>  <br>Saten and Mikoto disagree.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? That post was of the same quality as any other post on here. <br><br>Why isn't  deleted too, then? It's even more shitpost-y than the other. Why isn't it deleted? <br><br>Oh, but it has the "shitposting frog man" image so that must mean the post should be completely discarded and possibly even banned. Fucking shitposters, I swear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pepe is facebook tier now, despite /s4s/'s best efforts. Oh well.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> I'm not an autistic weeaboo who can't read more than words on a screen.<br><br>Try reading an actual novel for once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga Kuroko has the best voice in the dubs. It's the translation of "Onee-sama" as "sissy" that kills it. Saten and Uiharu sound like 40 year olds</br>  <br><br>my unpopular opinion is that I actually like kuroko more in the dub. <br>I'm not baiting, I'm not trolling. I think its a really good performance.</br></br></br>  To be honest, I think most contemporary dubs these days have reached a certain level of quality control that there's nothing really bad to say about them other than "well yeah it exists".<br><br>This isn't the 90s or early 2000s anymore.</br></br>  <br>Kuroko without the old hag rasp isn't good.</br>  <br>But it was though</br>  <br> old hag rasp <br> crazy preteen lesbian </br></br>  I think the big problems with dubs is that they always mix the dub too loud, and it always sounds like the voice is coming from a recording booth rather than the environment the character is in. <br><br>The second big problem is that the cadence of the speech is slightly wrong as they try to fit English into the Japanese length of character speech. <br><br>Dubs are shit, and dub actors are terrible at their jobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why bother buying it in the first place if you have access to that simulcast stream? I know Funimation offers both the Dub and Sub on it's website, so it doesn't make sense that a person would buy the blu-ray to watch the English dub when they already can watch (and support) it on Funimation.</br>  <br>Because some people like physical memorabilia.</br>  <br>Bryce is the new Johnny. You barely hear Johnny in anything anymore.</br>  <br>I am new to animu, and I always demand subtitles when I watch a new series. However, once I've watched it once, if I go back to it, I will often seek out the dubbed version just so I can compare them. I was actually pretty butthurt when I couldn't find a dubbed version of Nichijou, even though I am militantly pro-subs.</br>  <br> my tablet <br>PLEASE tell me it's a Kindle.</br></br>  <br>ironic</br>  <br>There are actually people who hold a "no dub, no buy" mentality when it comes to anime on disc. I don't know if it holds true for all series or just the really popular ones.</br>  <br>When so much of the average anime fan's experiences consist of watching anime for free on the Internet, it's certainly nice to have the option if you buy it. Especially if there's a dubbed version on the Internet somewhere.</br>   not watching dubs   <br>What leap of logic did they make to think that oneesama meant sissy?</br>  <br>I hate when they use honorifics in dubs.</br>   Every aggressive adult female is voiced by Colleen Clinkenbeard <br> Every cocky bad guy is Scott Mcneil <br> Every male MC is either Vic Mignogna or Johnny Young bosch <br><br>Why does funimation keep using the same fucking actors</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered why they don't just leave the honorifics or their English translations out in dubs. English dosen't have them, and hearing characters say "brother", "big bro", etc. just sound unnatural.</br>  <br>the fucking jojo dub, why</br>  <br> He didn't like dubbed Soul Eater <br><br>All the voices were pretty much spot on except for maybe Patty.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=648<wbr>0V-5GDos</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They really use honorifics in dubs?<br>Isn't that weird?<br><br>I thought dubs would be completely localized.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>faggot.</br></br></br>  I liked dubs that take on the life on its own. That it practically offers a similar yet different experience.<br><br>A good example would be Yoru ga Kuru ~Square of the Moon~. The original Japanese is a plain VN to H-OVA quickie adaptation. But, the English dub was a campy B-movie with porn which have some funny jokes that is absent from the original.  There's this one H-scene where the MC feels that something's not right. The English dub has the MC comment that he might be gay .</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish, they use to be but some use honorifics still. It just sounds so unnatural.  Azumanga dub and Persona 3/4 come to mind </br>  <br>Similar to Ghost Stories?</br>  I prefer Dub over subs only because I like to watch anime while laying in bad before I go to sleep and if I'm watching sub i need to wear my glasses because I'm blind as fuck.  <br> I used to have closed captioning on when i used to watch tv. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>This only happens for series nobody otherwise gives a crap about. It's not like VAs and scriptwriters can just dick around all day long and expect to bring any profit.</br>  <br>script/10</br>  <br>Yup<br>Same person argued with me that the PS4 version of Elders Scrolls Online was somehow better.<br>You're paying 60$ for a free game, you can use a controller on the PC. I can't see an argument.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be the extreme end but yeah.<br><br><br>I only expect the dubs to make the show feel like it's already set in the dubbed language. No forced equivalent for honorifics (just use "Umi" for "Umi-chan" and not "Umi-ster"), no out-of-place Japanese (no students call each other "Sempai"), etc. Also, put some effort in localizing the jokes. I don't need a TL note for a dub.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably has a shitty PC.</br>  <br>It's because they haven't tried sub enough. I used to be a dubfag then had an anime I wanted to watch enough I watched it sub, I struggle because retardedly slow reader who constant pause. But there are some good dubs and a lot of shit dubs that make you want to cut out your eardrums with a scalpel through your nose. <br>Some dubs I liked was sao, spice and wolf, high school dxd, mayo chiki, haganai, heavens lost property, my bride is a mermaid. If you want a laughable dub try watching chaos head dubbed, the English sub and audio is so off from each other it fucks the story.</br></br>  <br>i wish funimation licensed everything</br>  <br>I feel the same way.</br>  <br>They practically do these days.</br>  <br> no students call each other "Sempai" <br>Makes me wonder how Burgerplex/Bang Zoom is gonna handle UBW and HF. The old DEEN F/SN dub just kept it as is.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Sentai grabs a lot of crap too. They're the dubfags' worst nightmare.</br>  <br><br>But I'm in this thread!</br></br>  <br> No Game No Life <br><br>I actually like those voices especially Shiro, i'll go kill myself.</br></br></br>  <br>In that case I wish sentai got all the releases.</br>   Michael McConnohie   <br>Why?</br>  <br>It's a she, and not really?<br><br>That being said, Space Dandy Dub was pretty great, only really "disliked" (as in it wasn't amazing) QT's role. Some of the English episodes were better than the sub, some were on par... Some of the songs were better in English.</br></br></br>  <br>but they dont have cool boxes and box sets like funimation does</br>  <br>They're that stupid that they can't handle looking at more than one point of the screen at a time.</br>  I've come to the assumption that dubfags don't even like anime. If you actually liked it, you would at least have seen a number of shows subbed before/if they were ever dubbed in the first place.  Can someone link me to a dub that is considered objectively "good"? <br><br>There hasn't been a single dub I've heard that hasn't made me physically cringe, and I'm trying to figure out if it's just me.</br></br>  <br>Fuck funimation.</br>  I love /a/ culture  <br>there hasnt been an anime that hasnt made me physically cringe, especially not your favorite anime</br>  <br>I would have been fine with "Big Sis", but sissy just sounds horrible</br>  <br>but thats sentai filmworks. you can tell by hoa horrible it is</br>  <br>Cowboy Bebop, Big O, GitS:SAC, Outlaw Star, some of the 90s and older Gundams, etc. Early Bleach was pretty good too.<br><br>Most of the older toonami shit is decent. The new stuff has been dogshit lately.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tfw don't even notice I'm reading the subs anymore <br><br>I always fucking read this shit before I'm about to watch something, and then I'm suddenly super conscious of the text and can't concentrate on the video.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nLm<wbr>sVBgZiak</wbr>  [ ] <br>here you go :^)</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RVR<wbr>OU28Q1_w</wbr>  [ ]<br>video is shit<br>it's ight otherwise.</br></br></br>   i actually think the Welcome to the NHK dub is better than the sub. the english VA's really gave it their all. <br> same with Bebop </br>  <br>that dub is brilliant though</br>  Personally, while I'm still a subfag. I've grown an appreciation toward some american dubs. Even if they are only somewhat decent. I think it's because the dubs in my country is so horrendous, and voiced by the same 5 terrible 'actors' over and over again.  <br>That's Sentai bud. Funimation is alright every once in a blue moon.</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Em<wbr>ncf4kP_m0</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>Sora's English VA was actually not shit even though he's completely new. If the dub had a little better direction and editing he would've been really fucking good. That's saying a lot compared to "I'm Typecasted As Every LN MC" Matsuoka.</br>  I used to think dubs were bad just because the VAs had to manage to match the flapping but it's more than that.<br>There has never been a dub with vocal intonation matching that of other media such as films or theater. What people pass for good such as Cowboy Bebop, GITS, Baccano<br>dear Jeebus if you heard that stuff accompanied with live action you'd be killing yourself.<br>I'm not saying I don't like those dubs but we just have to acknowledge that the standard 'good' for dubs will always be fucking shit.<br>Maybe it's the director, or indeed the annoying lip flap matching, but it's probably just the VA fucking it up once in a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br> objectively <br> good <br> That shit <br>Would you stop forcing this meme? It's not dank at all.</br></br></br></br>  Of all things, Genshiken had a legit good dub which I prefer over the jap  <br> forcing a meme <br> as far as dubs go it's generally considered breddy gud <br>I don't know what to tell you<br>here's your response.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the baccano and bebop dubs would do just fine in live action</br>  <br>I don't have to like it nor the show itself if I don't want to you know. So stop forcing me onto your taste.</br>  <br> ask for recommendations/other peoples' thoughts  <br> cry bitch tears and act like you've been raped <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>In general, the Japanese don't actually animate to pre recorded voices. They just have generic lip flaps that move arbitrarily whenever someone is saying something with the occasional specific line.</br>  <br>Even though Nozaki-kun was not only the objectively better comedy but the objectively better anime of that season? No one fucking cares anymore.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>that guy is a retard anyways. lets just giggle at him and humiliate him while he sulks in a corner</br>  <br>Why is it that in every one of these threads the Dandyfags have to come out and force their stupid shitty show as if anyone even cares? Just do the world of favor and drink a gallon of bleach.</br>  <br>Dubs generally sound bad because when you hear the original Japanese voices you associate a character with that voice. The voice becomes part of that character. So when you hear the dub voice it sounds bad partially because the dub voice is not part associated with that character.</br>  <br>If every single dub you've heard made you physically cringe, then what non-cringeworthy English work are you comparing them to?</br>  Posting in a /co/ thread  <br>In live action, if an actor or actress knows they fucked up, they'd probably stop of their own volition<br> that was a reaaaaaally bad take. <br>Now, because there are moments of utter shit in dubs, even if the vast majority of the voice time is okay or good, too much shit and it wouldn't pass for live action.<br>I admit, Baccano is the one show I have seen with the most consistency - so many characters who are solid most of the time.<br>But fucking Nice's accent is grating on the ears. Maybe that's the VAs native accent, I don't know. Regardless, it was a bad decision.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't get that way with languages that I do not speak.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128099734 <br>I never said that you fucking idiot. I'm saying that I want you to just fall off the face of the planet already because you already did enough damage by shitposting in every single thread for every single show that season because everybody just had to care about your piece of shit.</br>   Really like Ayumu's dubbed voice <br> Look up his VA <br> Sort of a newcomer who hasn't been given much work <br><br>This shit kills me<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GPA<wbr>GeRGZr90</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your show fucking sucked then and it sucks now and it always will, so just fuck off.</br>    <br>That's all you can do is post stupid reaction images. You have no real rebuttal besides that because you already know.</br>  <br>I enjoyed it<br><br>literally opinions/10<br>It's not a debate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Think they had him do the MC of D-Frag and Ben-to if you want more of him.</br>  <br>He fits the roles he gets.<br><br>Except Accelerator.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, he's amazing. i also love how they did the dub for that anime, because besides the OP and ED, they re-did all the songs, and all the jokes too, so it's a different experience from the sub</br>  Yea, it seems the sub is always superior. I used to think there were dubs that at least rivaled the subs (Sean Schemmel as Goku, or FLCL) but was won over by the originals eventually.  <br>He's also Shoe from Guilty Crown and he's going to be Kaneki.</br>  <br>Ahem</br>  <br>This is how it should be if some things are too japanese.</br>  The worst part about dubs is the translator always feels the need to change or censor shit way more than with subs. Happens with video games too. The original audio is necessary if for no other reason than to keep the translators honest.  <br> literally the dub's script, put into subtitles <br><br>i don't think that'll fly, doc. a translation is a translation</br></br></br>  <br>That's one of the reasons why I think I prefer watching Steins;Gate dubbed. It really doubles down on the banter and the atmosphere changes slightly, but I think I prefer Tatum's take on the show than the original Japanese audio.<br> Word to your mother. </br></br>   tfw I started watching the Durarara!!! dub because I was still high off of how good the Baccano!! dub was <br><br> mfw too deep into the marathon to turn back and start over <br><br> That Isaac and Miria cameo </br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the most random anime they've ever gotten. They could afford to add their own flair to the dub because not much would be lost in the process.</br>  <br>durarara's dub is pretty good. i don't see what you're going on about</br>  <br>too bad Durarara isn't.  Baccano isn't very good either. </br>  <br>in the commentary they said they had to improvise and change a lot of things because a lot of the jokes were puns that would not translate, or pop culture references literally nobody would get</br>  <br><br>DRRR was literally just Baccano for fujos.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit this, in fact sometimes I'll look down at my phone because it's such a natural thing now and realize I didn't understand what the fuck they just said, because I didn't read it.</br>  <br>And dubs are consistently a lot more liberal with their translations. I'm not talking about localization either, dubs will erase any subtext they find offensive or ship characters or turn conversations that weren't jokes into jokes, etc.</br>  <br>wanna get hurt?</br>  <br>Like how in Pokemon I heard that the dub put a lot of Misty liking Ash subtext in when there wasn't in the original?</br>  Maybe I'm alone in this, but I kind of like the broadcast dub thing Funi is doing. The dubs are all of varying quality, but it extends the amount of enjoyment I get out of a show. I can watch it in Japanese first and then watch the dub as it comes out. If it's bad then I can just make fun of it, but if the dub is good like with Assassination Classroom or Kekkai Sensen, I get an entirely different and unique experience.  <br>that's 4kids</br>  <br> Changed Seraphim's pet name for Ayumu ''piece of shit'' to ''maggot'' <br><br>Not sure if they did this because of voice matching issues or they were afraid of negative feedback.</br></br></br>  <br>A dub transcribed into subtitles is for people with hearing problems.<br><br>A typical subtitle script used directly as the dub script is not only awkward due to literal translation bias, but also inconsistent with the duration of the character's animated dialogue.</br></br></br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with broadcast dubs.<br><br>It's living proof of the T E C H N O L O G Y our society has today.</br></br></br>  <br><br> talking shit about Baccano <br><br> I understand why people wouldn't like it. I enjoyed it but it was definitely a love-or-hate anime </br></br></br></br>  <br>More than likely it just had to do with lip flaps. "Maggot" in English goes by a lot quicker than "piece of shit."</br>  <br>in my opinion, maggot sounds more comical, and funimation doesn't like using profanity unless the anime is really dark, like deadman wonderland.<br><br>i'd take maggot over piece of shit because the show isn't about driving some guy to depression</br></br></br>  <br>IIRC there's a scene in the dub where they almost call him a  faggot  because it rhymes with maggot. So maybe it was another "lost in translation" thing?</br>  <br>I can understand why people like it but it just wasn't for me.</br>  <br>Yes they sound much less elegant. It's like that for all languages, in my opinion.</br>  <br>I have a feeling that broadcast dubs cost FUNi no extra time or money, but that the real reason their standard dubs are so delayed is because the Nips don't want them releasing dual audio BDs so soon.</br>  <br> tfw Monica Rial has such varying degrees of good and bad  <br>i don't even know what to think.</br></br>  Only dun I've ever legitlly enjoyed was<br>GTO</br>  <br> There is literally nothing wrong with broadcast dubs <br><br>The concept is great. I really enjoy them. But I'll be the first to admit that some of them are kinda shit. Seraph, an already middling show, had a lot of miscasts and just downright bad acting. There were a few standout performances, but it's just a really odd dub.<br><br>Then you get shows like Yuri Kuma and Otaku Teacher, which are arguably just better left alone and the dubs for them are just bizarre. Not bad, but nutty.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she does cute voices pretty well but that's just me.  Speaking of her https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pWS<wbr>rSudcpRU</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>She's pretty much the go-to for loli vampires.</br>  <br> tfw never a monogatari dub <br><br>i would miss hearing kamiya and hana and everyone anyways</br></br></br>  <br>I got pretty floored when I learned she voiced  Michiko in Michiko to Hatchin. </br>  <br>They've come out and said that it doesn't cost any extra time or money. But the reason the BDs are delayed are because: <br>1.) They're using the tv broadcast tapes and there are usually changes between broadcast and BD release. <br>2.) The production committees don't want reverse importing because it's becoming a major problem, as the price for BDs in Moonland is ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br><br>okay that sounds reasonable</br></br>  <br>Well that was just pure speculation on my part. Glad to see that it's actually the case. I didn't want them sacrificing quality for speed.</br>  <br><br>you're precious jap va's do that too tard</br></br>  <br>Does FUNi have a seperate crop of VA's for the broadcast and non-broadcast? They just dubbed Noragami and the cast is mostly veterans.</br>  <br>How is it?</br>  <br><br>these kids don't remember the dark days. although those manga entertainment commercials were bad ass</br></br>  <br> eyes were built </br>  <br>It is literally impossible to dub Monogatari with all of those Japanese puns.</br>  <br>No idea. When they did the broadcast dub of DxD BorN, they switched out the MC for some reason, yet they were able to restore the cast of Haruhi. I don't know what goes into these decisions.</br>  <br>Yato's voice is pretty weird, but everyone else is decent.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uOj<wbr>CKI2RXoM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> yet they were able to restore the cast of Haruhi <br>Gotta give em credit on that one. What a fuckin miracle.</br></br>  <br>Broadcast dubs are new, so it's hard to say. There are still a few shows in Funi's catalog that aired a few seasons ago that need to be dubbed and released, because they aired before broadcast dubs became a thing.<br><br>That being said, there are a lot of reoccuring actors in the broadcast dubs. Ian Sinclair, Monica Rial, Chris Sabat, Sonny Strait, and Aaron Dismuke are all popping up a lot. However, so are a lot of new voice actors. A lot of the people in these broadcast dubs are rookies in the field, only having prior experience in local theater, as do most of the Funimation regulars. <br><br>Broadcast dubs for sequels, spinoffs, or new seasons usually get the old cast back (with the exception of High School DxD, where two actors had to be replaced), even if they aren't Funi regulars, so again, it's hard to say. I know Nagato Yuki-chan was outsourced to Bang Zoom in LA instead of being recorded in house or by Okatron in Dallas.<br><br>Right now, Funi is still trying to figure out how to best go about broadcast dubs, so there's occasionally going to be odd casting throughout seasons or lots of reoccurring actors, but they're probably going to get better at it as time goes on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what the deal is with the girl who got recast, but I do know that the guy who voiced the main character is battling with some type of cancer and a general rough patch after a nasty divorce. <br><br>All the Haruhi VAs are LA regulars, so it probably wasn't harder than just outsourcing it to Bang Zoom. Kind of like what they did with Ocean up in Canada when they dubbed Roberta's Blood Trail.</br></br></br>  Reminder that the casting in the dub of Spice and Wolf for Lawrence is objectively better than in the Jap version, and Holo is possibly better depending on the viewer's taste.  The best part about broadcast dubs is seeing /a/'s reactions to all the voices.

That cute, high-pitched way of speaking doesn't work in English. Dubs a shit.  <br>I remember watching this shit in VHS dubbed.</br>  <br>elfen lied? whenever i think ADV i think elfen lied. the dub wasn't bad, but i have this one dvd case of it that was pretty big, like a VHS tape box, but had no extras and had all 3 disks stacked on one disk holder. it's weird, but it's the best looking release of the show there is</br>  <br> Bang Zoom <br>If they were able to restore the cast for Haruhi, why couldn't they do it for ufotable's UBW? They fucking mangled the original cast, which was consistent for DEEN's TV and movie releases, save for Saber.</br></br>  <br>does he have down syndrome?</br>  <br>Azumanga (even though Japanese is still better)<br>Ghost Stories<br>Evangelion<br>RahXephon<br>Those are the first 4 I think off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow.<br><br>I'm actually impressed. Too bad literally every other VA is horrendous. I hope this chick gets more (and better) roles though. Sugu is a low bar.</br></br></br>  萌え is impossible in English. That's why I almost never watch English dubs.  <br>She was also Kyuubey in Madoka, Amy in Gargantia, and Taiga in Toradora.</br>  <br>in english please?</br>  I watched Nagi no Asukara dubbed because I had never watched anime dubbed; it was decent  <br>You still watched SAO tho</br>  <br> not liking the Ranma dub <br><br>Shit I first watched it as an adult in the 2000s and I still think it's enjoyable.

It's Moe.</br>  <br>Actually, I wasn't saying anything about the Ranma dub, though I made it look like I was accidentally.</br>  <br>It was kinda husky if I remember right and eventually got replaced by the guy who would eventually do Inuyasha's dub voice.</br>  <br>Deen's version and the movies were licensed and dubbed my Sentai, so the cast is different. Aniplex of America has first dibs on the Uforable stuff because the Japanese branch is part of the production committee.

Then Sentai rescued its license years later.<br><br>Sentai then picked up the UBW movie and outsourced it to Bang Zoom, who brought back the original cast.<br><br>Shekelplex has the rights to ufotable's UBW. I don't know who has the final say in the casting decisions, but unless the VAs themselves have an excuse, whoever didn't want to restore the original cast must be fucking delusional or so new that they don't even know about the other dubs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> RahXephon <br>this dub confuses me. it's like, there are some good performances sprinkled through it, but then there are some really terrible ones. and then the guy who plays the lead, you can tell he's trying really hard to be good but he just falls flat, which is strange because he was really good in NHK and Soul Eater.</br></br>    <br>I prefer the Japanese.

One person even said it's a compliment. But, well, it's the internet, so I'm sure there are retards and trolls mixed in.<br><br>At any rate, more people definitely seem to see it as negative.</br></br></br>  <br>But that probably has more to do with how its heard subjectively. I'm guessing that it's like saying "you look young for your age". Many woman will take it as a compliment and many others will through a fit. Calling someone "normally cute" might be a compliment to some and not one to another(the cuter ones I'd imagine).</br>  So what languages do you plan on learning after Japanese? I want to learn Chinese, but not because I have any interest it in outside of just learning the language itself. I wonder if that will be enough to push through.  <br>I uploaded two entire sentence packs from AJATT to MEGA. Lemme get them for you.<br>Sci-Fi Pack: https://mega.co.nz/#!v9BFBZSb!N6Tu3<wbr>fYYR6TvE50Yc0wufA26GAOnEgMOJrkmLC6z<wbr>yhE<br><br>My first sentence pack: https://mega.co.nz/#!vogGzIYa!l1c2m<wbr>T4alCAc-s_P3GIucm14x93Vdpvh-pJCzI41<wbr>tx4<br><br>Sentences are way better than pure words, since you learn them in context and you kind of absorb the grammar by osmosis. More fun to do it that way, too.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>busu is also just used as a general insult for females. It means ugly, but is often times used on cute girls as well if they are not as attractive as others. If you watch akb48 media they will call each other busu a lot, and there are busu kyara but they are actually attractive compared to the average person.</br>  <br>Russian or maybe Chinese like yourself. To have something to do when I don't feel like studying Japanese. I think I'll be occupied with Japanese for a while longer.</br>  <br>The problem is knowing when to stop. I don't want to start Chinese because I don't want to stop Japanese, even though I'm at a pretty good level. I've been studying for 3 years, but I am still learning of course. I'll stick with Japanese for now.</br>  <br>I'm learning spanish because it's easy enough that I can just add 10 sentence cards to anki a day and still feel like I'm making progress.</br>  腹上死  <br>  It means ugly, but is often times used on cute girls as well if they are not as attractive as others. If you watch akb48 media they will call each other busu a lot, and there are busu kyara but they are actually attractive compared to the average person. <br>That doesn't really say much about the word ブス, just about media. Just like how the girls who are uglier by setting in hollywood films are still usually really hot.</br></br>  <br> I read this and the second in the series and it was boring as shit. <br>The second one is so good though.<br><br> Read prince of nothing <br>I'll check it out.<br><br><br>I also read portuguese books though that is not fair because that is my native language. The other anon said it the best already. People interested in languages will eventually be interested in books. You'll probably reach the point where you'll stop reading manga/VN yourself and move on to novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just telling you the usage of it. It is a general insult that means ugly, but it isn't all that insulting and it's thrown around quite a bit.</br>  <br> The second one is so good though. <br>Actually, I liked the first a lot more than the second. I just didn't like how it turned into too much of an "adventure" type book. Kind of like The Hobbit or Alice in Wonderland. I much prefer the style where the world is more known (while still being fantasy) and is developed more, rather than the main character encountering some crazy monster, getting out of the situation, and then the monster never coming up again.</br></br>  <br>And also it's only used for females.</br>  <br> but it isn't all that insulting and it's thrown around quite a bit. <br>I doubt actual Japanese people not already being paid a bunch for being cute would feel the same way.<br><br><br>There's ブサメン for males</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The second one is so good though. <br>Have you read the sequel? It's also good, but it takes a bit of a different approach and some might think they'd be better of not having read it.</br></br>  What is some good listening practice for beginners?

Haven't finished, lost interest.<br>Also haven't read the fourth one either for obvious reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a pretty casual insult. People even say it about themselves. Like "I don't want to cry because I will be busu".<br><br>I don't know why you're just guessing at things when you clearly don't have much experience with actual Japanese media.</br></br></br>  <br>The Pokemon anime is pretty simple. Although this is similar to reading Yotsubato in the sense that it doesn't really prepare you all that well for more normal stuff.</br>  <br>Ah, thought you were talking about the third and forth part. My two books are separated into the first and second, and third and forth part. I was talking about the Urth of the New Sun.</br>  <br>How much of a beginner? Honestly I don't think you should bother with material meant for natives, no matter the target group, until you're at least like N4. Find some audio meant for learners, like in textbooks with audio CDs.</br>  <br>Oh didn't know that, the e-book I downloaded is split into 4 parts. <br><br>Haven't read urth either.

If you make it too simple, it simply becomes misleading and will cause you headaches when you get past the beginner level.</br>  Should I go through the trouble of adding vocab from VNs to a separate decklist before finishing Kore6k? <br><br>Currently I am about 1/3 into 6k and KD decks, started reading about a week ago. As I mostly read on my Vita  Amagami. I know reading with no text-hooker is a royal pain in the ass, but being able to read Sae-chan's route is one of my main motivations to try and do my best. Besides, it's not too extreme, I expected it to be much harder, considering my current level of knowledge , interrupting every minute to add words on Anki seems conter-productive, as it takes away from my concentration, and I am pretty sure that even if I do add reading vocab now, I'll still encounter 90% of them in core6k anyway, then why bother?</br></br>  <br>Try to find the Nihon Shock Cheat Sheet.

Why can't they just use Hiragana for everything? It's so much easier ;_;  <br>I think the hard part about Katakana is that you get much less practice with it.</br>  <br>I'm around ~2600 words into Core2k/6k and I started a mining deck a while ago, with around 1k+ words already in there after a few weeks-1 month of reading VNs. I just paste them to a word document and add them to anki thru Epwing2anki afterwards. If it's too much of a pain w/o a text hooker I wouldn't even bother with it, but for your next reading material I would definitely choose something that's on PC or otherwise easy to get text from so you can start a deck. I'm planning to stop adding new cards on core once it's at 3k words and start focusing more on my mining deck, but try stuff out and do whatever works for you.</br>  <br>i just started CAPITAL LETTERS today. why can't they just use lower case for everything? it's so much easier ;_;</br>  <br>Why do we even have capital letters?</br>  <br>Romans and Greeks.</br>  <br>SO THAT WE CAN EXPRESS OUR RAGE THROUGH TEXT</br>  <br>The same reason Katakana exist.<br><br><br>Although I'm the first one to spit on memrise, the site can be useful to practice your Katakana skills, learn some words and overall get used to them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why does katakana exist?</br>  <br>Be happy you don't speak german<br>English capitalisation is extremly easy<br> Not that german capitalisation isn't but you need to pay more attention </br></br></br>  <br>To trigger your autism.</br>  <br>Why don't the japs have capital hiragana and katakana?

Like those people who think they can learn japanese just by watching anime<br><br>It's quite simple really, if there is hardly any text in that VN then you can hardly use it to study.<br>and on top of that, just reading japanese is not studying, just like simply watching anime is not studying. If you want to use reading to learn then you need to have something with a lot of text and you have to actually _study_ it in some way, not just read it.</br></br></br></br></br>     You're learning Japanese so you can understand weird shit like this <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e22<wbr>VnQF4NtQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Such an odd people the Japanese.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll just save this for later</br>  Anyone know a list similar to that of English SAT to increase advanced Japanese vocab?  <br>The best translators are often good writers, and the best writers are often good readers. Read more and write more and you'll find your translation skills will improve. <br><br>That said, the translation is fine, I guess. It's not something easy to translate because the idea of the "flow" isn't something we really talk about in English. It's really common in Fukumoto's stuff though for example.</br></br></br>  <br>What is おひえて here?</br>  <br>教えて. This is a dialect commonly spoken among sluts.</br>  <br>Reminder (from Ixrec's grammar guide on second person pronouns)<br> お前 (おまえ) you the default second-person pronoun (especially for males) <br> 君 (きみ) you more friendly than おまえ, implying that there is some sort of relationship <br> 貴方 (あなた) you a second-person pronoun used by females, sometimes used specifically to address her husband <br> あんた you a more colloquial version of あなた without the strong connotations <br> てめ you used primarily to express contempt of the subject. Also, attaching め to the end of any noun or pronoun conveys the same nuance of contempt. <br> 貴様 (きさま) you essentially a more formal version of てめ. In some contexts this does not convey contempt, but rather an expectation of humility or submission. <br> お主 (おぬし) you a very old second-person pronoun </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh, i see, so it's like she's talking with her mouth hanging open or something</br>  <br>Yea. Another thing you'll see is dakuten being added to words. いぐ for example, instead of 行く.</br>  <br>What the fug is an Ixrec?</br>  I've been studying for about 1 year and a half, know a few thousand words and I'm still not sure what だって means.  <br>It means all kinda things depending on context, kinda like "fuck"</br>  <br> 君 (きみ) you more friendly than おまえ, implying that there is some sort of relationship <br>No, 君 can be used with strangers in the proper context. Policemen stereotypically use it, for example. Also, using お前 with close friends is very common. <br><br> てめ you used primarily to express contempt of the subject. Also, attaching め to the end of any noun or pronoun conveys the same nuance of contempt. <br>Except this め has nothing to do with the め in てめえ.<br><br>I don't know much about ixrec but it sounds like he's just pulling this out of his ass. If he's going to bother covering shit like お主 he might as well cover 汝 or 自分 as a second person pronoun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It can mean either "also/but" (similar to でも) or be a quote. It's also used to elaborate reasons, especially when arguing or trying to convince the other person. <br><br>It would help if you posted specific examples, because explaining a grammar point/word that has so many uses is difficult without being specific.</br></br></br>  <br><br>By the way, since you two were nice enough to help me. Is it okay if most of the time I read けど at the end of sentences as a mood-marker-word(I don't know if I'm getting my meaning across) like よ? Because it almost never seems to mean "but" unless it's at the beginning or in a sentence.</br></br>  <br>I think you've got some problematic assumptions you're working on. No, けど doesn't always mean "but" in English, but that shouldn't be something surprising. It gives the listener room to interject and can make the difference between a natural and an unnatural sentence.</br>   looking up top reasons to learn english because i'm convinced its not worth it <br> most of the reasons are to get paid more money <br> doesn't matter if you already have a good job <br><br>Why bother learning English?</br></br></br></br>  <br>to my mind, it's almost exactly like ending an english sentence with "but..."<br><br>it sort of expresses doubt/uncertainty and prompts the other person to speak. like you hear people answer the phone and say 失礼けど… meaning something like "i know it's rude, but... [may i ask who is calling?]"</br></br></br>  <br>75% of all media is in English one way or another, so you'll have a lifetime of entertainment available.</br>  <br>Unless you're Japanese or Chinese (or a normalfag) other countries' internet suck immensely.

You have to lead the conversation 100% and be aggressive as hell. Once you've had a few "conversations" then you need to advance the relationship to the next level. For example, if the conversations were in text then tell (not ask) her that the next conversation will be voice. Then trade pics of each other etc etc. You have to keep it going. If you're stuck at the first step then drink a bit of alcohol. <br><br>If you're looking for just a friend then find a guy. They're MUCH easier to talk to than the women are.

You all have been saying it all along but I thought I'd persevere somehow. After two years of practicing on and off, the process is just too long that I'm starting to hate the language.

Not to mention the god awful accents because that makes them 'sexy' and once I swore they were just straight up speaking Spanish.<br><br>English movies are a blessing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure. I hate language exchange sites because the conversations always seem to die out really quickly.</br>  <br>Are you at least learning every day for an hour? If you can't manage that, then there's something wrong with you. If you are spending that hour everyday on only anki then I'm not surprised. Drop anki and spend that time reading. Reading is the most important thing, although you should also listen and produce if you are able to. But if all you can do is read, do that. Spending all your time on anki will not teach you japanese. Beyond the beginner months, anki is a luxury. <br><br>I have a question though. You've been studying for 2 years; what is your ability at now? Can you read VNs at all? can you read shounen without a dictionary yet? If not, I'm sorry to tell you but you've been doing it wrong with whole time because I am quite capable already after half that time. Yes, I make mistakes all the time and have trouble with complicaed japanese, but I can understand 2ch and youtube comments completely and can understand most music I listen to, can read most manga without a dictionary and can understand youtube and niconico videos as long as it's not a long rant. You need to step up your game if you are not a tleast half that at this point. I'm aware that I'm privileged from being a neet so I'm giving you a 100% handicap, but you should at least be at half my level as a normie, I think. Otherwise you haven't been trying at all. Now, if you're only complaining because you're not fluent; that's to be expected, especially with an east asian language. Without living in the country fluency may never come.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you often go on autistic rants like this?</br>  <br>I'm probably autistic, sorry.</br>  Studied 29 cards in 13 minutes today.<br>Again count: 8 (72.4% correct)<br>Learn: 17, Review: 7, Relearn: 5, Filtered: 0</br></br>  I found this website ages ago about that had a pretty detailed explanation of 開け口 and words similar to it, explaining nice 連用形 too.<br>Anyone able to figure out what website it was? Sorry to give you so little information but it was such a detailed site for Japanese and I just can't find it anymore.</br>  <br>why are you only doing 17 per day?<br>I feel like I learn nothing with 30 cards a day and put it up to 40 now to see how it goes</br></br>  <br>I never tried VNs. I started sometime in 2013 at my college. For that year I didn't really do anything outside of class so I basically knew nothing. But 2014 I found anki and started practicing off and on. This summer I started going hard on anki and got burnt out so I started reading and that's what I'm doing now. <br><br>I still can't understand music, 2ch, or youtube comments. I can barely read manga cuz I always have to look up words. And you're right my effort has been shit thus far. <br><br>I'll just take it slow and read and do listening practice for 2hrs a day.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just started mining.

If you're reading and listening everyday, then you're on the right track. Good luck. <br><br>Do you have a good grammar base? Are you having any trouble when reading with grammar? This is very important, I think It's a huge different if you have a strong grammar base. <br><br>Personally, I used tae kim's guide and then afterwards, learned grammar from absorption. But if you have used a different source for grammar, maybe a bad text book that doesn't cover important slang stuff, you should maybe go back and study some grammar.

While it doesn't teach EVERYTHING it teaches enough to where you won't be confused. It shouldn't make more than a few weeks to go through. Do 1 lesson a day, it should take just 30 minutes or less.

There hasn't even been a question about even basic grammar in quite a while despite there being questions like "How do I study Hiragana?" and "Why does Katakana have to exist?" as well as other equally stupid things that only a 5 year old would ask, and almost all of this has been caused by the overrun of summer fags. There's also been an increase in frog and shit posters as well, which I expect has also been caused by summer fags.<br><br>Of course, this is all only temporary. Once the summer fags leave because they've given up, things will go back to normal until Christmas comes again.</br></br></br></br></br>  How do I study Hirganaga?  <br>In addition to this, perhaps a really simple visual novel?

Please tell me this isn't true and she was just a nationalist or something...  <br> kanji <br>2,500-3,000 is probably more accurate. However she is probably talking about vocabulary in which they probably know at least 20,000 vocab.</br></br>  <br>It's true, at least for most educated people, but typically they can only write about 2000 or so of those from memory. The other 3000 or so are Kanji that they can only read.</br>  <br>I think I read somewhere that the average is 3000-3500, and that a really well educated person would know 5000 and any more and you get into specialized people who learn them for a living.</br>  <br>Your low with that vocabulary estimate. A 20 year old Japanese person will know about 45,000 to 50,000 words.<br> 語彙の総量を「語彙量」という。満年齢で6歳になる子どもの場合、理解語<wbr>彙の総量は、およそ5000～6000語ほど。13歳では3万語前後。20<wbr>歳ではおよそ4万5000～5万語ほどという調査結果が出ている[1]。</wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br><br>Damn it... All this time I had the magic number 3000 in my head and I thought I would actually be able to do this shit. But 5000 is a whole other ball game.</br></br>  <br>Interesting. I wonder if they count conjugations and similar. Just threw the number together based on English lexicon. I guess we just suck at everything.<br><br><br>The number of kanji is pointless, you'll learn them eventually on your road to learn tons of vocabulary.<br><br>If you can learn 2,000 you can learn 5,000. It doesn't magically get harder.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you reach 3000, then reaching is 5000 is just a little stretch more. It's much tougher to go from 0 to 3000 than from 3000 to 5000.</br>  I've got a splitting headache, I don't think I can read today.  <br>How many hours do you have left in the day?

DoJG gives a simple translation of one use case and no further note.</br></br>  <br> Language can be perfectly grammatically without being... <br>I hope you don't think you're being clever by bringing that up. All of those can still be corrected by anyone qualified. If you don't know what you would correct and how, then you aren't good enough at Japanese to trust about what is natural or not to begin with.</br></br>  So, I've got the Kana down, I'm reading through Tae Kim, and I've been working through the Kanji Anki deck.<br><br>Am I on the right track, or...?</br></br>  <br>I remember you freaking out about that ages ago. Damn, man, give it a rest. You aren't remotely in the sort of position to make such judgement calls about the inclusion of that sentence. <br><br><br> All of those can still be corrected by anyone qualified.  <br>They ARE correct sentences which do not need to be corrected as nothing is "wrong" with them. That is the entire point. Most of these were created by linguists to show the point of distinction between grammar and orthography. I don't think I'm clever; It is a red herring to be equating grammar with "good language". It shows a fundamental misunderstanding of language as it is clear you are viewing it through a lens of prescriptivism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Language isn't an equation. <br>It is in any significant context. The most important category of language usage is that of formal writing. Such writing must abide by standardized prosaic formulae.</br></br>  <br>Nope. By this point you've fucked up too much to ever be able to understand Japanese.</br>  <br>Nobody brought up grammar specifically except you. You seem to agree that the Japanese above is at least grammatically correct, which would mean the claim that it is "broken" is wrong. So I don't even know what your point is.<br><br> It is a red herring to be equating grammar with "good language". <br>Your entire post was a red herring.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It is in any significant context. <br>No. <br> The most important category of language usage is that of formal writing.  <br>Not fucking remotely. The most important aspect of a language is how it is primarily used: which is spoken language. Spoken language precedes all other aspects of language. <br> Such writing must abide by standardized prosaic formulae. <br>How fucking naive. These "forumlae" have been changing constantly over time and the biggest changes have always come from the same roots as spoken language changes: usage. There is no definitive vanguard as to what constitutes correct language or not. You likely have absolutely no idea how much time academics spend arguing about different ideas of correctness of the written language. What you see as these standards are flimsy at best. <br><br>Linguists build entire careers around just how wrong your statement is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I remember you freaking out about that ages ago. Damn, man, give it a rest. You aren't remotely in the sort of position to make such judgement calls about the inclusion of that sentence. <br>U wot? Who?

SOLD.</br>  <br> Megumi becomes a boy and cancerous romantic plot goes the fuck away <br>Wouldn't it just become a yaoi romance plot and, as such, even more cancerous?</br></br>  <br>You know the answer to that already, though then it would be a harem show.</br>  <br>I sincerely doubt Megumi, Blue, AND Seiji would turn gay from this revelation</br>  <br>The only one I can think is  but only is he maintains his personality.<br>And Mana, she is basically a cute boy already.</br></br>  <br>Who said anything about turning gay?</br>  <br>How do 6 girls have sex?</br>  <br>Don't you mean more fabulous?<br><br><br>Eh, Megumi could be a trap.</br></br></br></br>    <br>now you're just being difficult</br>  <br> One Precure in any team becomes a boy. Which one would improve her show? <br>Just one single Precure in the team?<br><br>I would be interested in Itsuki, if only to see the reverse trap thing being played as a trap situation instead.<br><br>Pic related (albeit the entire team)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why a furby?<br><br>Actually, this kind of looks like a retarded aroma from the thumbnail.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Seiji and Hime is the worst crackshipping.</br></br>  <br>the boy isn't important, hime being cute is</br>  <br>Rin because a boy and starts fucking Princess Crepe during GoGo!</br>  <br>  South Africa <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  I'm never really sure what they're imagining when they think just presenting a super powerful character will somehow be fun for anyone. I guess in this case they might have thought that people would cheer at seeing Regina get her ass handed to her, but I think that's a longshot. After all, they worked so hard to build her up as a sympathetic villain who's torn between the two sides.  <br> thought that people would cheer at seeing Regina get her ass handed to her <br><br>I did.</br></br></br>  <br>YuuYuu as a boy will get all girls.</br>  <br>This bitch.</br>    <br>But how will Mana become the Prime Minister? Surely she doesn't want to be the PM of the White Niggas?</br>  Geez, that scream.<br><br><br>Yeah, and the same way, Ace probably had instant fans despite her coming out of nowhere to kick asses. Underdogs just get their appeal through relatability, while watching an ultra-strong character just win over and over with no real struggle gets more from self-insertion or vicarious victories.<br><br>Or I suppose you might've just hated her and loved to see her suffer. If you were a horrible person, I mean.</br></br></br></br></br>  Right, Toei. Because this worked so smoothly and naturally before.  Wow, she really is just as naggy (if not more) than Mana. Is the rest of the year going to be a giant bitch-off?  Daily Minamin!! Take care of your Pafus  <br> But how will Mana become the Prime Minister? Surely she doesn't want to be the PM of the White Niggas? <br>She isn't white that's already half the job done.</br></br>  <br>No, she goes soft once she falls in love with Mana.</br>  wut<br><br><br>Man, I don't even know whether that's better or worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Better, she gets to be very cute later.</br>  HAHAH, oh wow.<br><br>I love how the villains are all "We'll get you next time, Cure Ace!" instead of pissing themselves because she's so powerful that she could probably kill them instantly any time she wanted.</br></br>  The second coming of Madokami.  <br>That's not even accurate. She gets better in episode 27 when she finally gets a real focus episode of her own which has little to nothing to do with Mana.</br>  Well that wasn't so cute. Why you so Karen?<br><br><br>Yeah, for the moment she's a bit of a mess. I'm sure they meant for her to be a little hated, with how harsh she is. Makes sense that getting to know her would soften her up, but there's not much room to go the other way and still be a good.</br></br></br>  <br>It does make a bit more sense at the end of the series, but that's no excuse for how they did it.</br>  <br>It's not the sudden appearance of an ultra-powerful character so much as feeling like they wasted so much good build-up with Regina. I can appreciate swerving, but if you watch Suite or Fresh, there's no sense that they wasted time developing tension that was just thrown away in the end.  Miyuki was built up, but nothing near the level of that lava pit scene, and Beat/Muse was a surprise without sacrificing anyone in particular. </br>    <br>She is hardly ultra-powerful.</br>  <br>Tokimekinasai!</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ikU<wbr>oVVAT8Fo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br>Regina was one of the few things I actually liked about Doki, and they do this to her.</br></br></br>  <br>My heart is not aflutter.</br>  <br>"Get Hype" was the best translation I saw for that line.</br>  <br>Regina was poorly handled, but that isn't saying much in one of the worst seasons of Precure.</br>  <br><br>I dunno, Miyuki was obviously a red herring in Fresh. Everything about the idea of her as a Cure was done in a tongue-in-cheek manner outside of that one scene where Tarte was having a breakdown, and even that wasn't entirely serious since he was digging through a basket of donuts to find Akarun.</br></br>  <br> Doki <br> bad </br></br>  <br> meme arrows will change reality </br>  <br> meme arrows <br>It sure is summer. Hawawa~</br></br>  <br>Aguri doesn't really get better, she just gets different kinds of bad.<br>She's very much stuck in her ways and only really starts to see things through the eyes of her team members in the last couple of episodes.</br></br>  <br>Did you already forget HaCha?</br>  <br>HaCha had Hime. Automatically better than DokiDoki.</br>  <br>Yes, very<br><br>HaCha was a sillier show and it succeeded in that. Better characters, a more unique theme, more consistent story.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm just from /jp/, relax.</br>  <br>have you done your daily kanji reps?</br>  <br>Hogwash. Every focus episode for her was about her changing and growing as a person.</br>  <br> changing and growing as a person <br>I see what you did there.</br></br>  <br>She did neither of those. To the very end she was an unsympathetic murderous psycho phony know-it-all.<br>She learned how to eat carrots, but that was the extent of it.</br></br>  <br>top kek</br>      Would deadpool improve your favorite season?  <br>Actual Deadpool or the lol so randumb deadpool?</br>  <br>Nope, every single episode where she forces development down the girls throats she too changes slightly. And the largest example I can think of is the culture fest episode where Mana gets sick and she realizes how Mana's style of leadership works. I can see how you'd hate her if you love Regina though; but only if you completely missed the point that the two of them are programmed to kill each other and emerge as the one true existence. Regina's just as much an "unsympathetic murderous psycho phony" if you look at it that way.</br>    <br>Yuuyuu has some big shits.</br>  <br> I can think of is the culture fest episode where Mana gets sick and she realizes how Mana's style of leadership works <br>That's not character development. She didn't grow from that experience in the slightest and acted exactly the same as before.</br></br>  <br>Or you didn't notice or acknowledge her change.</br>  <br>You're wrong.</br>  <br>It's been a while since I last saw this post.</br>  <br><br>Why does it always bring up dog faces?</br></br>  <br>Dogs were one of the things it was heavily trained to recognize with large image libraries.</br>  So, uh, is there a reason the magical seeds look and act like sperm?    <br>They're musical notes</br>  <br>Can we train it to recognize cures?</br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Today's theme is Precure's favorite karate bugman, Mr. Bunbee!

Just being bland or boring isn't enough to get sales as low 250~, usually having cute girls is enough to get more sales than that. Did Japan really hate the show that much?  stupid sexy Futaba<br><br>I need to buy these printed copies somehow</br></br>  <br>It was going well for a few episodes; but, it succumbed to DRAMA out of nowhere and the MC became an edgelord. The DRAMA then ended suddenly and it returned to how it was before for the last episode. Seriously, the MC acted like airsoft was an actual battlefield.</br>  Despite all the hate for different artstyle, it's pretty good. Like they put a cute filter on everything.<br><br>Also OP of the season. <br>Tsu-rii times!</br></br></br>  <br>That's unfair though, Alium is best girl.</br>  <br>She has the same belt.<br><br>Belts are hereditary.</br></br></br>  <br>Granddumber is great and a cute. We need more chapters about her.</br>  <br>I dunno, I thought Alium's slick backflip into her cockpit was pretty cool.</br>  The girl in the glasses is pretty cute. How long will I have to wait for her to ditch them.  What the fuck, this isn't about cute girls doing cute things.  <br>Shit gets pretty damn heavy pretty damn quick<br> If you have broken the seal on the main book, tolerance and sympathy are no longer virtues. <br> Prepare yourself. <br><br>And the advise to isolate affect people. At gunpoint if necessary. Using deadly force as required.

She pays close attention to the others' mental states and does what's necessary to help them and is pretty quick thinking in a pinch.</br>  <br>Isn't it already obvious that that's her role?<br><br>Rii-san is the responsible one, Kurumi is the brave one, Miki is the smart one and Yuki is the heart.<br><br>They all got their issues, though Miki is likely the more composed one because her own issues were solved already in the school arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When Kurumi says she has always been a great help <br>Are you retarded? I'm talking about the other fucking panel, where Kurumi states Yuki cleaned the whole place up for them. Something Yuki did not do at the beginning of the manga (i.e. taking care of stuff). Therefore, Yuki has become more useful.<br><br>Damn man, you really need to understand what people say to you.<br><br>I wasn't the guy talking about who weighs down what, but if you think Rii hasn't become less reliable and is close to being a liability just from what has already happened, then I fear for your future in life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   emphasizing the whole "self-efficient" and independence in the extras  <br>I'd wish the author explains the back story and the relationship between the infection and the school.</br>  Best girl in their respective series thread.  <br> only <br> Yuckyno/a fags actually believe this </br></br>  <br>Is this better?</br>  <br>One of the few times the anime designs are objectively better than the original designs.</br>  <br>this is so true.
