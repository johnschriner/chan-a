I'm a real gamer you see and real gamers don't pretend games are something more. People that try to convince others that their hobby is mature and adult are just ashamed of their hobby and therefore not truly invested in it.</br></br>  <br> It is such blatant bullshit <br>Because characters in a comedy series need to be realistic, right?</br></br>  <br>The point is that she doesn't actually act like the typical otaku at all. She has her obsessive hobbies, but they don't consume her entire life. She's able to live a normal happy life in society and then come home and enjoy other things, in proportion. It's not a mirror, showing an otaku an idealized version of themselves. It's showing them a completely different, better, more responsible and happier version could be, if they tried to be better. Of course they hate it. It's not escapism, it's aspirational.</br>  <br>Yukino from Kare Kano did it well.

Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" masked man, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your MORNING COLA on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about an chibi imouto anime. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic meme-posting NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?" You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now.

Young things ought to want to grow. <br>Based on your in-depth child psychology knowledge I'm sure.<br> But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. <br>Based on your in-depth psychology knowledge of mental disorders.<br> When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. <br>Okay. <br> Now that I am fifty I read them openly. <br>Okay.<br> When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up. <br>Okay.<br><br>Unlike you, some people grew up not being ashamed of things they liked. Their tastes developed and matured, and they begun to enjoy more intellectually and/or emotionally stimulating 'art'/'entertainment' (let's not get caught up on which word applies here).<br><br>If anyone has 'arrested development' (which they don't), it would be you. You refused yourself the opportunity to enjoy things appropriate for your age when you were younger, so once you hit an age where you realized you didn't have to impress people, you slingshot backwards to try to experience the things you missed. But that's absurd pseudo-psychology. <br><br>Slightly too long. Continued.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, you're arguing against CS Lewis. He's dead man, let it go.</br>  <br>you just seem butthurt people like a cartoon you don't like, what are you, a child?</br>  ITT: I only watch adult cartoons for an adult like my self  <br> this fucking autism </br>  <br> pretentious teen: the image <br>The thing that separates an actual anime fan from some kid who watched a bunch of grimdark seinen anime is that we watch more than 20 anime<br><br>Kill yourself you pretentious child</br></br></br></br>    <br>Fucking hilarious actually getting butthurt about and taking the time to argue against a copy pasted quote from a famous children's author and even more amusing you thought someone on /a/ actually wrote that.</br>  <br>Continued.<br><br>Anyway, you seem to like personal stories and analogies. My aunt, who is around your age, recently got diagnosed with cancer. Since then, she started doing coloring books with her 1 1/2 year old granddaughter. It's stress-release, and that's good for her. But she comprehends that she isn't making great 'artwork'. You see how that works? She wouldn't compare herself to someone who practices/studies art. She wouldn't dream of comparing her colored page to an artist's painting. <br><br>And for similar reasons, if you like children's shows, good for you. But when someone objectively critics the complexity as 'intended to be fully comprehended by a 5 year old child', that should make sense to you.<br><br><br>I don't understand what you are saying?<br><br><br> tokusatsu <br>Yeah, I still don't know what that term is supposed to mean.<br> Sentai <br> Kamen Rider <br>I'm lost here. Those aren't mecha, are they? <br><br>I'm very confused as to what you are saying/what point you are trying to make. How is this related to anything I've said?<br><br><br><br><br><br>I'll gladly hear your points if you think you have any.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't have a point, me and fellow /a/non's are just mocking you, and rightfully so.</br>  <br> Stupid faggot is actually expecting people to take him seriously  <br><br>lmao</br></br></br>  <br>1) You're arguing against a famous quote by a celebrated children's author as if he posted it on this image board. It's cute.<br><br>2) Tokusatsu is essentially Japanese SFX; the complexity can be "fully comprehended by a 5 year old child", but many fans are adults who aren't emotionally stunted in their growth. It's not that weird to just genuinely enjoy children's media alongside whatever "intellectual pursuits" you consider superior, or more deserving of time.<br><br>I think general confusion is a popular theme with you though, so don't sweat it too much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever considered suicide?</br>  <br> I don't understand what you are saying? <br><br>What  said was a quote from a writer named CS Lewis, and you are a fucking idiot.</br></br></br>  <br> actually trying to educate this angsty /v/ browser <br>Stop</br></br>  <br>Why are uncultured individuals like you so against watching kids shows?Just because you are 18 now you don't have to watch Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, stop being a insecure fuck.</br>  <br>Are you ashamed of yourself?</br>  <br>Alright. I'm missing something here. It's directly on topic and people seemed to agree with what it was saying. I responded to it. So what's the point? Is the quote posted sarcastically? Or do my points not stand because it's a quote? <br><br><br>Alright. Mocking me for not knowing a random obscure quote? Or because you believe what I said was actually wrong. If it's the former, by all means, amuse yourself.<br><br><br>1. Okay. Was the quote meant sarcastically? Otherwise I fail to see the relevance.<br><br>2. Alright, I still don't get how 'tokusatsu' got brought up in the discussion. And I suppose my definition of 'weird' is different than yours. I find it weird, as in illogical, not necessarily 'unusual' or 'uncomprehendable'. There's not exact words for what I'm trying to say, but I think you get the point.<br><br><br> quote from a writer named CS Lewis <br>Yeah, someone else said that. I usually put quotes in quotations, or lead them, or put a parenthesis with the author at the end.<br><br> and you are a fucking idiot <br>And why do you say that?<br><br><br>I don't go on /v/. Also, I'm not sure why that would be an insult. And for that matter, I'm not 'angsty'. <br><br><br>I'm 23. I don't watch Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones. I wouldn't consider myself 'uncultured', but that depends on the context (specifically, which culture(s) we are talking about).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> my points not stand because it's a quote? <br>Your points don't stand because you are an autistic fuck with no idea what he is babbling about spilling his spaghetti everywhere in this thread . Keep going though its entertaining.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not that I think what you said is wrong, it's that it is wrong. Your entire arguments stem from your subjective experience of "maturity" or whatever fucking idea you have. It seems to me that you think yourself to be mature and developed and therefor what you consider to be "intellectually" or "emotionally" stimulating is the only standard in which others find those same qualities. You are so close-minded you can't even understand why someone else finds quality in a fucking cartoon that you don't, and you are so insecure that you want to justify it by proclaiming "maturity" and other bullshit.<br><br>You are a fool, that is why we are mocking you.</br></br></br>  <br>hahahhahahahahahahah<br>This thread is fucking gold</br></br>  <br> CS Lewis <br> obscure <br>I heard that quote for the first time in English class in school, when I was like 10. The teacher brought it up specifically because some little shit was prancing round like a peacock about how 'mature' he was, so the teacher straight up reckt him<br><br>It's one of the most famous quotes in the world LMAO<br><br>Also you're obviously from /v/, you only watch exactly what /v/ likes and then claims are the only good anime like they've seen it all suddenly. Grow up kid</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LMAO <br>way to ruin an other wise good post</br></br>  <br> Alright, I still don't get how 'tokusatsu' got brought up in the discussion. <br>I mentioned /m/. <br><br>Just because I can understand post-graduate thesis papers doesn't mean I'm going to enjoy them more than my shitty chinese kid's shows. The idea that that's "illogical" is no-fun-allowed tier autism.<br><br><br>I'm speedreading comics while watchin Ultraman, I have shit else to do unfortunately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the easiest bait ever though, it's too tempting to just leave tbh smh LMAO kek all around my posts<br><br>You can't stop me</br></br></br>  <br> Keep going though <br>I'm trying. No one's attempting to argue against me.<br><br><br> Your entire arguments stem from your subjective experience of "maturity" or whatever fucking idea you have <br>No it doesn't. I never said nor alluded to 'maturity'. <br> It seems to me that you think yourself to be mature and developed... <br>Yes I do.<br> and therefor what you consider to be "intellectually" or "emotionally" stimulating is the only standard in which others find those same qualities <br>I never said anything of the sort. Everyone in these threads is giving their opinion of other peoples top 9 favorite anime. That's the point of these threads. I, like everyone else, used my own standards to form an opinion on other people's 3x3's (meaning the shows within them). <br><br>But that's irrelevent. I don't think the people who included the children's shows consider those shows to be particularly intellectually/emotionally stimulating. Which is fine, if they like the show then so be it. But it gives them no basis to argue against other people's opinion on their 3x3.<br><br> You are so close-minded you can't even understand why someone else finds quality in a fucking cartoon that you don't <br>That's not true. I don't like mecha, but I fully understand why some people might. Or older verse newer animation styles. Or episodic vs serial. Or whatever else have you. What I don't understand, is why someone would like something that on all merits seems to be objectively intended for young children.<br> and you are so insecure that you want to justify it by proclaiming "maturity" and other bullshit <br>I never did or said anything like that.<br><br><br>I know CS him, but the quote is fairly obscure. <br> you're obviously from /v/, you only watch exactly what /v/ <br>As I said, I don't go on /v/. Here's my vidya 3x3 if you don't trust me. I've never posted it (I assume /v/ has 3x3). I've legitimately beaten less than 20 video games and I'm sure /v/ would laugh it. Anyway, what's wrong with someone browsing /v/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3/9</br>  <br> What I don't understand, is why someone would like something that on all merits seems to be objectively intended for young children. <br><br>Yeah, because you don't like it. Not because you don't understand, but because your subjective experience deems it not "likable" or good. If someone says they find the coming of age aspects in some children's show endearing or admirable, is that enough for you? If someone says they enjoy childlike qualities in characters such as naivete or innocence enough for you? Cuz to me, it seems like you want to bash them just for having that preference, and deem it as whatever negative connotation you are giving it. <br><br>  I don't think the people who included the children's shows consider those shows to be particularly intellectually/emotionally stimulating. <br><br>I'm sure everyone here that likes Anne thought it was emotionally "stimulating". <br><br> But it gives them no basis to argue against other people's opinion on their 3x3. <br><br>Your opinion is "why would you like a kid's show?" and when people have told you why, you deemed it insufficient. Your arguments have no basis, you are retarded. <br><br> I'm trying. No one's attempting to argue against me. <br><br>troll or not, this kind of mindset is pitiful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The fuck is going on in this thread  <br> Just because I can understand post-graduate thesis papers doesn't mean I'm going to enjoy them more than my shitty chinese kid's shows <br>No, not at all. But you should 'enjoy' ('appreciate' is a better word in this context) them more than a grade/middle schooler's paper on closely related topic (ignoring the fact that the later would obviously be shorter). <br><br> The idea that that's "illogical" is a no-fun-allowed tier <br>If 'fun show is fun' is your style, so be it. I have nothing against that. I just find it strange that it would compose of his entire top 9 shows. I think that's simply having shitty tastes if that's their favorite shows. What you are essentially arguing, is that all tastes are equally, and everyone's 3x3 is a 9/9. I honestly don't think I'm making straw-man of your argument here, that's what you are saying, right? <br><br><br>Well, your bait failed I guess.<br><br><br> because you don't like it. Not because you don't understand, but because your subjective experience deems it not "likable" or good. <br>I think you aren't seeing the point I'm making here. If I compared a portrait I painted to one by Rembrandt, I don't understand how anyone can like mine more. Yet, hypothetically, I can hear someone saying "I like that one, it is so much more colorful and carefree". To me, that means they aren't comprehending it, and have bad tastes.<br><br> If someone says they find the coming of age aspects in some children's show endearing or admirable, is that enough for you? <br>Enough for what? Liking the show? By all means, they can like the show for whatever reason they want. Calling it one of their favorites? One, maybe, multiple children's shows, no. <br><br> it seems like you want to bash them just for having that preference <br><br>To some extent, yes. But you are drastically oversimplifying. <br><br>Continued</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Continued <br>No, please stop. Please.</br></br>  <br> But you should 'enjoy' ('appreciate' is a better word in this context) them more than a grade/middle schooler's paper on closely related topic (ignoring the fact that the later would obviously be shorter). <br>For fuck sakes.</br></br>  <br>A guy who say he only is watching adult cartoons for adult people like himself</br>  <br>Are you the same guy with autism from the Orashura thread yesterday?</br>  And yet his taste  is nothing special.  You guys told me there was no anal in her S route. You lied to me! But I forgive you.<br><br>(Wednesday is Friday in...dog years).</br></br>  MC fucks all the heroines in the ass, I think it's all of them.  <br><br>He only did Mayu and Chris in the original. Everyone said, nope, no anal here. Liars.</br></br>  Yamato is a huge ass man  I'm pretty new to Vns, i've only read about 6 or 7 of them. is this worth picking up? if not someone want to spoonfeed me?  Best scene  EVERYTHING WAS GOING BACK TO NORMAL<br><br>UNTIL THIS CUNT SHOWED UP<br><br>PLEASE, SOMSONE SHOOT HIM IN THE FACE</br></br></br></br>  do girls in S turn into massive subs during sex too?<br>that shit killed the base game for me</br>  <br>I hate that fucker with the force of a thousand suns</br>  <br>Now that I finished the route, I'm 10 times more happier with 'Capt then I already was<br><br>god I love that man so much, I loved him during TTGL and I'll do so today again</br></br></br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br><br>You got tsubame if you want that, other than that well there is one drunk chris scene in S I'm sure you'll enjoy.</br></br>  I think every other girl has anal.

Is she worse than that Platinum bitch?</br></br>  <br>yeah just make sure to pick up lightbulbs ahead of time though</br>   she gets tired of anal so she forces him to accept a titjob <br> hes still going for the booty <br>man after my own heart</br></br>  Reminder that Yuu Asakawa is love.  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Best seiyuu, best grill</br>  Are there more girls which Yamato cant date in default world no matter what? Besides Hagruo.<br> ;_; </br>  <br>That's Koyuki, not Kosugi<br><br> Are there more girls which Yamato cant date in default world no matter what? <br>Ageha</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't do Koyuki in the butt. He takes things surprisingly slow with her. I don't think he'd ever do her in the butt unless she suggested it.<br><br>Looking at the CGs in S, he sticks a finger in Mon's butt, but never sticks his dick in it. I can't tell if he sticks it in Wanko's butt or not from this, and I don't feel like checking right now. I don't think Tatsuko or Iyo get it in the butt either.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't actually do anal that much, I think. The thing with Mayucchi is that even if he doesn't stick it in her butt every single time, he's still overwhelmingly focused on it. He's almost constantly got at least one hand grasped firmly on those cheeks.<br><br>It's less that he likes to stick his dick in her butt (he does, but not constantly). He just likes to shove his face in it.</br></br></br>  <br>Some people are still butthurt about her crushing Wankos hopes and dreams in her ignorance. Also her JUSTICE can get annoying.  I like her though . But not nearly as much as some of the other girls..  </br>  <br>Both actually, loves to stick it in, loves to worship it and train it. The guy is true assman.</br>  reminder that human girls &gt; monster girls  you're damn right  <br>Holy fucking shit is that Ms. Smith ? Noice.</br>  <br>He said human girls, not Pokemon!</br>  absolutely agree, monster girls are disgusting as fuck.  <br>pls no bully ;_;</br>  <br>Yeah, We should exterminate all monster girls.</br>    <br>post more</br>  <br>This old lady is back again</br>  <br>Smith is worse than 3DPD.</br>  <br>There's a reason why monmusu are niche.</br>  <br>Legs are important.</br>  <br> the jokes on you<br>smith is not a human<br> shes a witch all along </br></br></br>      Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128686<wbr>899</wbr></br></br></br></br>  中に出されるの喜び  <br>Production practice = grammar practice, it's easier to get grammar after you write some shit using it.

But the only one I can think of right now would be Zoro because of his eye.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Zoro <br><br> It doesn’t really matter if you know or don’t know the thing called the One Para Column, but this appears to be last of behind the scenes talk. The last story to tell is more of a behind the scenes policy, rather than a behind the scenes story. So what is a "pirate"? If you ask someone with artistic talents to draw a pirate, you will normally get a sketch that looks like this... or this ....  <br><br> Indeed, a pirate. Very easy to understand, but if you take off the eye patch, there's a big difference to one with, and one without (the one without looks like a normal middle-aged man). So then, that means, eye patch = pirate. It’s just like, afro = champion type thing... so have you noticed yet? Well, you probably haven’t. That in One Piece, there has not been one single pirate with an eye patch! ... yes i know, who cares right? But this is my secret "behind the scenes policy". It’s not like every pirate has an eye patch!!! ... right? You can totally draw pirates without an eye patch!!!! <br><br> And with that thought in mind it all began; the story of a normal looking boy's pirate story. <br><br> I thought, if there's an image in everyone's head about what a pirate is, then I thought I would write/draw about the process of the boy getting there. But its not like I dislike eye patches, so in the final scenes of One Piece, there is one pirate who appears with an eye patch. <br><br>It's Luffy<br>Why the fuck would Zoro need to wear an eyepatch when he's been getting along fine just by keeping his eye closed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't Luffy keep his eye closed as Zoro?</br>  <br> yfw when luffy uses two eyepatches as fashion because he loses both eyes instead of sunglasses or shit like that </br>  I think Usopp is the most likely to lose an eye. Especially since he's the Sniper and unlocked CoO.  <br>Usopp will probably get his eye shot out by Van Auger but still win.</br>  <br>Luffys style is that of a pirate<br>Zoro resembles more of a samurai <br><br>Zoro with an eye patch would look off putting.</br></br></br></br>   tfw Bisoromi Bear-Sama is gone   <br>This disqualifies any straw hat who is not a normal human.<br>Only Usopp is stated by Oda as<br> the closest to a normal human <br>When he joins Luffy's crew he was actually about to start his own journey as a captain but Zoro said get on the boat.<br>Usopp then said (and Luffy agreed with all crew present and not objecting that should luffy die, Usopp is captain.</br></br></br></br></br>   There are at least 15 notebooks that include Oda's ideas about Dressrosa arc. <br><br>That guy really does work 24/7 even when he is on a break doesn't he?</br></br>  <br>Mangakas doesn't sleep.</br>  <br>At first I thought that sounds like a bit of a longshot but if you think about it there could be a little bit of foreshadowing for this.<br>Recall the first chapter where Luffy tries to stab himself in the eye to prove he's tough?<br>Then there's the volume cover where he has one eye closed.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy was likely an infant when he gave Luffy to his grandfather. Cant be toting a babysling while overthrowing the government<br><br>Sabo was old enough/strong enough to fend for himself by the time Dragon fished him out of the ocean</br></br></br>  <br><br> "I just remembered, I love the D." </br></br>  <br> Zoro resembles more of a samurai <br>por que no los dos?<br><br>he already wears a bandanna. It would look good with an eyepatch</br></br></br></br>  <br>CARLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS</wbr></br>  <br>Luffy will die before One Piece ends.</br>   yfw Sabo is actually a D.   <br> le everyone is a D. meme xdxd </br>  <br>So is Tanjihado Loluflamingo.</br>  <br> My name isn't Sabo, I turned the D around when I was young, my name is Sah D. Ou </br>    <br> por que no los dos? </br>  <br>yes?</br>  <br> everyone who ever had a D in their name ever is a D </br>  <br>Nami is the daughter of Portgas D. Rouge's sister<br><br>Zoro is actually the son of gol d rogers younger brother who took the name of his wife because he didn't want to be connected with him obv<br><br>Sanji is actually half-giant, his real name is Jaguar D. Sanji<br><br>When bBook set sail 50+ years ago he had a son at home, his real name is Marshall D Brook and he is blackbeards granddad<br><br>Franky is actually a cousin of Law, Trafalgar D Water Franky. <br><br>Only Chopper, Robin and Usopp are no D's. :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only Chopper, Robin and Usopp are no D's. <br>anon none of them has a D it fits</br></br>  <br> Trafalgar D Water Franky <br>More like Trafalgar D. Cutty Flam</br></br>  <br><br>That much is obvious. He actually has no interest in changing the world, even if it does happen as a result of his actions. Every time he ended up benefiting someone other than himself and his crew, was because he held a personal grudge against the Big Bad because they did something to someone he liked.<br><br>The Revolutionaries are by definition geared towards the needs of the (supposed) many vs the needs of individuals. Luffy would never sacrifice himself for a goal (other than his own obviously), but only for a person he cares about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Usopp's real name is Jeffrey D. D. Osu.</br>  <br>you can blame Roger for that<br><br> those idiots of the WG are calling me Doflamingo now, can you believe it? <br> &gt;hmm? That's not your name? <br> No it's Donquixote D. Flamingo <br> &gt;D, huh? What's that D. stand for anyway? <br> You wanna know? Fuffuffu! Then i'll tell you. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw franky wrote his name wrong as kid and it's actually Cuu D. Flam </br>  So why did Oda introduce sacrificial immortality if it won't be used?  D. D. D.    <br> luffy, law and   x drake  have to take on kaidou together <br> law is mortally wounded <br> TORA!! <br> don't you worry mugiwara, I- I just used you <br> NANI!? <br> back when we were at marineford I performed the immortality operation on you - reducing my life too three years, that's why you survived. I knew that you would one day take down the shichibukai including doflamingo <br> TOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <br>I would hang myself while linking /a/ a livestream link</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Diez D. Drake?</br>  <br>My god anon how dare you. I don't want that to happen but it felt like a spoiler reading it.<br>But both Jinbe and Luffy were mortally wounded, and both lived.<br><br>Law is a heart thief. He controls his enemies literally by keeping their hearts.<br>So to me it seems obvious the way Law grants "immortality" is, he swaps his heart with yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  I haven't been keeping track of One Piece since Chopper was introduced. Have they found the One Piece yet? Is it even relevant anymore?  <br><br>My god anon how dare you. I don't want that to happen but it felt like a spoiler reading it.<br>But both Jinbe and Luffy were mortally wounded, and both lived.<br><br>Law is a heart thief. He controls his enemies literally by keeping their hearts.<br>So to me it seems obvious the way Law grants "immortality" is, he swaps his heart with yours.<br>So he either already did this with Monet or Luffy's heart will get shredded by Kaido.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Have they found the One Piece yet? <br>yes they found it the series is ending in august.</br></br>  <br>They are half the way to the One Piece.<br><br>We still don't know what it is.</br></br></br>  <br>no and yes</br>  <br><br>What is the point of the One Piece at this point, how is it still relevant?</br></br>  you have ope ope no mi<br>you make self immortal you die<br>but you immortal?</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!   BB had the Ope Ope immortality operation performed on him by the previous user <br> now has two hearts <br> can use two devil fruits <br> irregular body structure </br></br></br>  Is Oda preparing to have the top 6 of the worst generation duke it out? Kid, Hawkins and Apoo vs Luffy, Law and Drake?  <br> halfway <br>That was Fishman Island.<br>Alabasta ended in Paradise and it was:<br>Mock Town<br>Skypiea<br>Long O Ring Island<br>The Train Station<br>Water 7 and the still mysterious Aqua Laguna and PLUTON blueprints.<br>Ennies Lobby<br>Ghost Ship/Florian Triangle<br>Thriller Bark<br>Saboady<br>Impel Down<br>Marine ford <br><br>I really hope we have 10 arcs left but shit seems more rapid in the new world than in paradise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not relevant. The One Piece is the anicent weapon that'll unite all the seas and release all the devil fruits into one surprise ALL-ALL no MI Fruit. It would also absorb all the Haki from every Haki User to power the machine.<br><br>That's literally the end.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like it'll be over when they get to Raftel.<br><br>That's just when all the history and overarching plot reveals will come out. They still need to restore the world's magnetic fields, get rid of the Calm Belts, and break the Red Line before shit will be fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>Well yea if you prefer fanfiction to the acual story.<br><br>I don't think Roger's great treasure is a weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah because one arc took two years excluding the previous build up arc</br>  <br>That would go against the "risking your life for your dream" thing that Oda seems to value above all else.</br>  <br>That is just perception anon. Time seems to go by faster the older you get because every day is a smaller percentage of your life. Although that hasn't stopped this arc from being eternal.</br>  <br>Dressrosa is the buildup arc for the end of the story, though.<br>Everything about dress rosa is about the yonko, the marines, the WG, and the revery.<br>Specifically, an arms race with Doffy selling shit to all sides.<br><br>The arms race is for the final war which follows or even coincides with revery three months from Doffy defeat.<br><br>Fuji speech on TV will affect revery too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> above all else <br>Like when Zoro sacrificed himself to Kuma?</br></br>  <br>Do you know what build-up arc means? It doesn't mean foreshadowing, it describes a previous arc with direct relation to the actual bigger arc, see<br><br>Jaya - Skypia<br>Water 7 - Enies Lobby<br>Impol Down - Marineford <br>Punk Hazard - Dressrosa</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have spoilers come out yet? I've been watching  dota  all day long.  <br> Sacrificing my life means nothing if the SH can continue their journey toward their dreams <br>Kinda, I guess ?</br></br>  <br>I'm referring to the story arc in literary terms, not the wiki's arc system.<br>Even under that definition though Dressrosa is absolutely just the little garden of this saga which won't end till Kinemon's conflict is resolved.<br><br>For example Laboon, Whiskey Peak, and little garden were all buildup to Alabasta with Vivi being introduced at Laboon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Lawhats didn't form to kill Doffy they formed to kill Kaido, and taking out Doffy was just an essential step.</br>  <br>Dressrosa is more important and longer than alabasta, so year no comparing it to little garden is retarded at the first place there is nothing that suggest tha kinemon is the main factor that describes the current saga instead of kaidou, big mom or someone important on wano. Afterall the baroque works saga was not named after vivi, but after the organisation of a big shot</br>  <br>spoilers won't come out til tomorrow</br>  post yfw Bellemy joins the strawhats  <br>That's the difference between an saga, a arc and a build-up arc. The Saga SHOULD be about kaidou while dressrosa still is an actual arc and Punk hazard was a direct build-up arc for dressrosa</br>  <br> dressrosa isn't just a segment of the "Luffy and Law take down Kaidou" arc </br>  <br> I don't know the difference between arc and saga <br>Look ist up</br></br>  <br>Water 7 is actually longer than Enies Lobby I'm pretty sure. <br><br>EB was actually more like a conclusion arc to Water 7 that went on for way too long.</br></br></br>    <br>Arc and saga are words that exist and have their own meanings outside of the context of One Piece.<br><br>Inside the context of One Piece, arc and saga don't necessarily refer to a specific thing because the source material is in fucking japanese.<br><br>Are you ESL, or just autistic?</br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder Shanks will BTFO Kidd and his allies, and will make them serve him rum everyday  <br>  <br>Inside the context of One Piece, arc and saga don't necessarily refer to a specific thing because the source material is in fucking japanese.<br>Are you actually retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks will lost another arm.</br>  <br>please show me where in the one piece source material it is specified that alabasta is an arc and baroque works is a saga, and that the words arc and saga refer to specific story patterns</br>  <br>It is important but only in that it gives us a lot of the pieces for the Great War and Revery. Only in that it is buildup for Kaido/big mom/akainu. Only in that it shows us Luffy's strength max, so that when he gets owned by Kaido it seems impossible Luffy could win.<br>Dress rosa is longer than Alabasta but Alabasta introduced:<br>Poneglyphs <br>Roger's real name<br>Fire fist Ace<br>Shichibukai<br>The ancient weapons<br>Inanimate objects with devil fruit<br>Dr. Vegapunk (not sure if his name was dropped though could be wrong)<br>Logia<br>Steroids<br>and poison</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard</br>  <br>It's the Yonko saga, Dressrosa is a really long arc but not the main one of the saga which is going to be yonko resolution, not shichibukai working for a yonko resolution. Not that anon.</br>  <br>Nah he was intro as a silhouette at Drum. Also I forgot Krieg used poison gas. Still, also the only person who can read glyphs joined the crew at the end of it.</br>  <br>Initial<br>D<br>D<br>D</br></br></br></br>  <br>Logia were already introduced with Smoker<br>Gold Roger's real name was mentioned in Drum<br>Steroids and poison aren't important plot points<br><br>But other than that yeah</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>and Bepo.</br>    <br>Thanks for the correction but multiple royal families had secret royal steroids so they are relevant.<br>Poison is relevant because poison can also be a fatal disease.<br>Smoker wasn't a very overwhelming logia like croc but you are technically correct.</br></br></br>  <br>Lets face it. Only reason Kidd's crew is going after Shanks is because Hawkins cards predicted that their survival rate is the highest against the Red Hairs verses the other Yonko. And that's only because Shanks is a chill guy and will probably give them a little beating and then laugh about it and party with them afterwards.</br>  <br>I disagree with that being even the main reason.<br>Shanks is the most desirable Yonko to defeat because looting his ship and even just asking him how to get to Raftel could have good results.</br></br>  <br>We don't know that it hasn't already been used. She's a prime candidate if you ask me.</br>  <br>I want it to happen</br>  <br>Dammit, every time I see Doctorine my head changes her symbol to the 4chan clover</br>  <br><br>Is it impossible for Blackbeard to be Pluton?<br>The Blueprints Franky burned in front of Spamdam said PLUTON but when Franky talked about what he had to people in confidence it was stated as the<br> countermeasure <br>To PLUTON, rather than the weapon itself.<br>This has always confused me because sometimes the manga says frankly has plutons countermeasure and others it says the weapon itself.<br><br>How did Blackbeard know Luffy was at Water 7 after Skypiea is my main question though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dragon was too busy with revolutionary stuff when Luffy was born probably. Plus he's mentioned in some of his appearances that he approves of Luffy's choices in terms of finding his own way in the world. It's very possible he wanted Luffy to grow up and form his own opinions on things and also new that while Garp would want him to be a Marine he would also be too busy to raise or influence Luffy that much (which is indeed what happened)</br></br>  <br>I think you're confused. It was stated that Pluton was to be used as a countermeasure against one of the other ancient weapons in case the government or someone else revived one.</br>  <br>Makes sense, I'll re read it.</br>  <br>You didn't answer the main question.<br>It makes no sense that Blackbeard could know where Luffy would exit the sky.<br><br>But on to other shit, check out this 330 year old skull that Robin found from the ship that fell from the sky and read what she says about his smile.<br><br>Then remember that Luffy found a treasure chest in this boat that fell from skypiea which had been in that place while roger was alive.<br>Roger undoubtedly found this boat while it was in skypiea, and learned his own family history.<br><br>Unfortunately the exclamation pointed treasure chest was never opened, but at least luffy found the map of skypiea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  posting canonically gayest one piece character  <br>You mean Delly</br>  <br> canonically gayest one piece character <br><br>you mean fanonically<br><br>Gayest award goes to Whitebeard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is the ship.</br>  <br>that quote is bullshit. Just because you can't imagine a new color, doesnt mean there arent any more</br>  so how did those people on the island find out tanjihadou laluflamingo were former tenryuubito? did he literally tell someone he used to be one?  <br>The quote never said that things humans can't imagine don't exist, it just said all things they can imagine are possible.</br>  <br>Pluton is a ship man</br>  <br>it says that anything your imagination can create can exist in the real world, not that only things you can imagine can exist<br>reading comprehension</br></br>  <br><br>Here is the exclamation marked treasure chest that got eaten by the sea turtle.</br></br>  <br>So it is Water 7 then, because the saga ended with Iceberg telling Franky Water 7 would be converted to a ship.</br>  How different would the Dressrosa arc have been if Akainu sent Kizaru instead of Fujitora?  <br> read what she says about his smile <br>Are you talking about how he had rubber oil put on his teeth after his death?<br><br> Roger undoubtedly found this boat while it was in skypeia and learned his own family history <br>Okay, first, the boat was floating around in exile on a cloud island or something in a place where it couldn't get back. I'm not sure how Roger could have found it.<br>Second, in what way is this tied to Roger's family history? I see no indication of any of this. Roger is from the East Blue, this guy is from South Blue.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora did nothing. <br><br>Kizaru doesn't give a fuck about anything so he wouldn't have done anything as well.<br><br>I like Fuji but with Kizaru the arc would've been 3 times better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kizaru would've gotten shit done<br> laser beams gladiators that try to join Luffy's side <br> Sabo tries to hold him off but get kicked with the speed of light <br> Law and Luffy would probably try to escape, the two of them could barely take down Dofla, so Kizaru would've been out of the picture. <br><br>I still don't get why they don't just send kizaru to destroy the ships of the supernova.He could just uasaka no magatama them to oblivion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rubber oils <br>Or he was a rubber man till he died.<br>If it can literally fall next to luffy I think roger would find it too. He found skypiea.</br></br></br>  <br>More pages dumpin no order though.<br>All the other skulls miss teeth by the way.</br></br>  <br>i like how this one really happens by the rust user at ennies lobby</br>    <br>I love that page so much, only because of how Robin can decipher something as simple as a skull and extract a ton of information. Ohara's researchers were ahead of their time. Damn the fights, I want Oda to release a book on all the information regarding One Piece's world. Just an atlas of stuff explaining certain areas and the like. Some people just can't appreciate One Piece for what it is.</br>  <br>Coating the deceased's teeth in rubber oil is a custom of a specific region of the South Blue. That's how Robin finds the name of the ship, which is later confirmed in the page you posted .<br><br>If he were a rubber man, that would be a hell of a coincidence. Also, if his teeth were rubber, then either they would still be rubber (which is not the case), or they would have ceased being rubber upon his death, in which case they wouldn't have been stayed in the same condition and deteriorated.<br><br>And yeah, I don't expect Roger to have found that ship, and there's absolutely no proof that he did. I'm just not sure where you're pulling this from.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora would've gotten shit done if we wanted to, too</br>  <br>Also, the log pose pointed to the sky only after/while this ship fell from it. Before that it was pointing normally.</br>  So once Luffy gives the hat back to Shanks, what is he going to do about his Crew name and Jolly Roger?<br><br>Cant very well go on being known as Strawhat Luffy after that.</br></br>  <br>Shanks is going to die at the hand of the Kid alliance.<br><br>He can't give the hat back.</br></br></br>  <br>Fire Fist and I sodomized your son.</br>  <br> ship with a treasure chest falls from the sky, then your log pose immediately points at the sky thereafter, and you get a map of skypiea  <br> not a hell of a coincidence <br>Ugh</br></br></br>  <br> implying Shanks wouldn't just give the straw hat back <br>Would be petty of shanks if he didn't</br></br>  <br>Ahos need not reply</br>    <br>didnt Shanks say to return it though? It IS still his hat. One he got from his deceased captain no less</br>  <br><br>He'll learn to awaken his power and make everything smoke.</br></br>    Who is the most autistic character in One Piece?  <br>Imagine this. After a big fight Shanks is dying, Luffy returns it and then Shanks immediately gives it back to him. And then when Luffy finds the One Piece he will pass the hat to the next strawhat.</br>  <br>Getting the map is not a part of the coincidence. The ship was on Skypiea.</br>  <br><br>Wanze</br></br>  <br>Luffy, he has Dragonball Goku levels of autism at times.</br>  <br>Hard to say. Going by the internet's definition, a lot of characters are autistic.</br>  <br>Vegapunk.</br>  <br>You're making a theory (Roger found his history) based on two baseless theories (Roger found the ship, the Saint Bliss guy was a rubber human) and another unproven theory (Roger was a rubber man).<br><br>It's highly unlikely Roger even found the Saint Bliss, and even if we're assuming he could because coincidences happen in One Piece, there's no evidence that he did.<br><br>The ship crashing down next to them giving them a map of Skypeia is a hell of a coincidence, sure, but it for sure happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro:*unseathes katana* shishi sonson Pssht.Nothing personnel kid</br>  <br>The map being completely untarnished while the sword disintegrated as it unsheathed is a pretty lucky coincidence.<br>So is Luffy of all people being the one to find it.<br>The falling ship coinciding with the change in magnetic field is the only reason they got the map as well so yes it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like he just said it to make some sort of promise that they'd meet each other again. I think seeing Luffy again is more important to him than getting his hat back, and I'd think he'll know that the strawhat would be important to Luffy by then too. I don't know, he might take it back, but I don't see him doing that.</br>  <br>that's too predictable</br>  When will the rest of the Sun Pirates be killed so Law can join the Strawhats  <br>Where did I claim Roger was a rubber man? I just claim this ancestor was as all other skulls on his ship had missing teeth and he was murdered so there was no one to put rubber oil on his teeth and manicure him after death.<br>You drew the roger was rubber on your own.</br></br>    <br>Roger hears the voice of all things and found all the great treasures because of it, and there was a treasure on the ship, and the drawn map was clearly NEW compared to all other artifacts on the ship.</br>  <br>Nah. Actually I think Luffy is very in tune with other's feelings and naturally knows what they need to hear or do to make them feel better. Like how he handled Laboon for example, though he's an animal. Definitely not stunted when it comes to social interactions.</br>  <br>looking at it like that, maybe he wasnt expecting the hat back. There was always a chance, Luffy would give up or die and he'd never see that hat again<br><br><br>I dont think Aladdin dying would effect whether or not Law joins. He can hardly stand Luffy, there's no way he'd stay with them</br></br></br></br>  <br>My mistake, I assumed you were using the "Roger had a rubber fruit" theory to try and prove your own.<br><br>You said that Roger discovered his own family history on that ship, correct? How on earth do you draw the conclusion that he find this information on that ship?<br><br>Maybe I'm misunderstanding you. I'm trying to clear it all up now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like Shanks knew someone like Blackbeard would kill him and take the hat so he bet it on the next generation. Even though BB will still kill him he will only achieve that much.</br>  <br> There was always a chance, Luffy would give up or die and he'd never see that hat again <br>I think that was the point. Shanks making Luffy promise to give the hat back, was in a way making Luffy promise not to give up on his pirate dream until he's able to meet up with Shanks again in the New World.</br></br>  <br>its just a hat. If what you're getting at is that the Hat is necessary to the future somehow, then im going to have to stop you right there</br>  <br>I dont think thats true, BB mentioned that he was willing to die a normal death if he never stumbled by the darkness fruit, which probably means he was mortal.</br>  <br>I suppose. But there was also the chance he'd die at sea before meeting Shanks again. Hell Sabaody should have been his end. Roguetown should have been his end really</br>  <br>Yeah, you're right, the hat isn't necessary for anything.<br>It still is, unbeknownst to almost everyone, Roger's hat. It's possible it's older than that as well. There's that image of a kid wearing the same hat while Noland told a story 400 years prior.</br></br>  <br> BB mentioned that he was willing to die a normal death if he never stumbled by the darkness fruit, <br>when did he say that?</br></br>  <br>Is Luffy a true Egoist?</br>  <br>Yea thats why no one told luffy it was Rogers hat even though many who met him know this, especially shanks and Rayleigh.<br>Faggot.</br></br>  <br>I never realized Rayleigh has a vertical eye scar like zoro</br>  <br>dont be a moron<br><br>If the hat was important, Roger would not have given it to Shanks. At least not until he was about to turn himself in to the marines</br></br></br>  <br>Passing the hat to the next generation in no way suggests it is unimportant.<br>Surviving (at least) three generations of pirating suggests it is special.<br>Appearing twice in Norlands story also suggests it is special.<br>The time skip also gives the hat specifically a heavy focus (page related).<br>The Straw Hat has dodged every attack except Buggy's, including lightning, magma, ice, and lasers.<br>The straw hat flew to shanks feet when it dodged magma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll be known as Pirate King Luffy</br>  <br>I smiled<br><br>Fuck You</br></br></br>  <br>ur a faget</br>  <br> Passing the hat to the next generation in no way suggests it is unimportant. <br><br>the hat going from Roger to Luffy only means the hat is being returned to its rightful owner. That's all<br><br> Surviving (at least) three generations of pirating suggests it is special. <br><br>special=/=important<br><br> Appearing twice in Norlands story also suggests it is special. <br><br>this means nothing until it's actually proven to be the same hat. Not just fanon speculation<br><br> The time skip also gives the hat specifically a heavy focus <br><br>because it's his symbol. He's was going to essentially reform the Strawhat pirates after that.

In the first Luffy gets the pirate kings hat from a future or current yonko after declaring he will become it.<br>Also when Crocodile threw luffy in quicksand the straw hat flew to Robin, who freed luffy and threw the hat back to him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If it is not proven it is the same hat to you, then you are an irrational person. <br><br>please provide actual proof.

It is on purpose and therefore extremely relevant.<br>2. It's accidental, Oda is known to draw straw hats like luffys by accident here's some other examples.<br>I can understand arguing that the hat is not the key to raftel but I can't understand the argument that Ida "accidentally" drew the iconic version of the straw hat in nolands flashback.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The hat probably didn't stay long with Roger, seems like only his own crew (Shanks and Rayleigh) know its original owner. <br><br>Here you can see Roger's long time rival WB associating the hat with Shanks rather than Roger.</br></br></br>  <br> Wait is your argument seriously that Oda didn't draw it on purpose? <br><br>no, my point is that strawhats arent some rare commodity. It's a hat made of grass. That village is full of farmers.

All of you are really fucking bored, aren't you?  Didn't Jinbei say he was going to get a crate of straw hats for the kids on FI?  <br>At this point it appears you are just saving face. I'll let you anon, sure.<br>My point was that a dude faked being the most famous supernova who fought at Marineford on TV just by wearing a non straw hat made to look like a straw hat, so it's pretty clear that straw hats like Luffy's are extraordinarily rare, or more specifically that his is unique like the eye patch.</br></br>  <br>If we had access to fun/friends/a life we wouldn't be on /a/</br>  <br> At this point it appears you are just saving face.

Of course she has a bit of gay in her.</br>  <br>It's stated as a modified hat. I can't refute you because your claims aren't even substantiated enough to be refuted. Your example of another straw hat is a guy mistaken by a nation state as straw hat luffy</br>  <br> You mean they tricked everyone until when someone (Sentomaru) who had directly fought Luffy 1v1 in the past showed up? <br><br><br>you're talking about a universe where people dont recognize Sanji because his wanted poster is drawn<br><br>you can't just negate comedy because it doesnt make sense in the real world</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I can't refute you because your claims aren't even substantiated enough to be refuted <br><br>of course you cant refute me because nowhere has it been stated that there is only one strawhat. Which is my point</br></br></br>  <br>A straw hat is used to keep the sun out of your eyes and help prevent heat stroke to a small degree.<br><br>Pirates very much could wear straw hats in One Piece, but don't.<br>Neither do the people in Water 7, Alabasta, etc.<br><br>I never said it is 100% sure to be the same fucking hat. I said exactly the opposite in the same post that you linked. We do not fucking know if it is the same hat, there is simply not enough concrete evidence for that statement to be factually true.<br><br>However if you are trying to say that the theory is stupid and unfounded, then you're being ridiculous.<br>The straw hat is an iconic symbol in the One Piece franchise, and you do not accidentally a drawing of it. The fact that it appears twice should at least make you go "Huh, that is a bit odd."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji's wanted poster is so bad he realistically should go unrecognized, though.

Being with the worlds most wanted man only leaves one option: become a Revolutionary at his side just as Sabo did.</br>  <br>I just realized, luffy looks alot like roger in this shot<br/></br>  <br> Stating "it's funny" doesn't substantiate your claim that the straw hat is not unique. <br><br>it's NOT unique because Demaro has one and as  say. Jinbe promised to bring a bunch of them for the fishman island kids.<br><br><br><br> It being passed from Roger to Shanks to Luffy, with Shanks telling Luffy <br> &gt;protect it for me <br> Does suggest it is unique. <br><br>Shanks passing the hat to what he see ass the reincarnation on his captain just means he's returning it to its rightful owner<br><br> That Luffy is identified by the hat, that Shanks returned it to him at Marineford, that it appears when roger meets Rayleigh, and in norlands flashback twice suggests it is unique. <br><br>because he's had the hat for years, because Shanks gave it to him and isnt just going to let him leave without it, because its Roger's hat, there's no proof that the Norland flashback hat it the hat Roger passed to Shanks<br><br><br> But it's been shown, anon <br>where has it been shown that there's only one strawhat in existence? Children can MAKE strawhats, people BUY strawhats, Demaro picked up a strawhat from somewhere or other.

Or Pandaman at best.<br>Why do people think it's gonna be someone important?</br></br>  <br>So what?<br>You can only post translated dialog, because you have NO example.<br>The straw hat is the straw hat, it's the one drawn on Rogers head, and the one drawn in Norland's flashback.</br></br></br>  <br>The straw hat predates one piece.</br>  <br> So what? <br>so he isnt making Wano hats, he's buying hats like Luffy's<br><br> You can only post translated dialog, because you have NO example. <br><br>what does dialog have to do with anything? The kids want strawhats because Luffy is wearing one. Why would Jinbe bring them something else entirely when he KNOWS what they're asking for?<br><br> The straw hat is the straw hat, it's the one drawn on Rogers head, and the one drawn in Norland's flashback. <br><br>Where is your proof? You have none and until you do, they're different hats</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>can you reiterate?</br>  <br>Unless you can show another hat identical to Luffy's that isn't his they are presumed the same hat.</br>  <br>Eichero Oda was an assistant on Kenshin. This straw hat/Jolly Roger is in the kenshin manga.<br>Oda talked about it in SBS.</br></br>  <br><br><br> People actually think the hat from Nolands flashback isn't an easter egg. </br></br></br>  <br>He looks more like Ace.</br>  <br> they are presumed the same hat. <br><br>you can assume whatever you want but same style=/=same hat. It's not proof and will never be proof. How do you even know its the same hat? Do we EVER see it in color?</br></br></br>  <br> drawn twice <br>Why presume something as non canon instead of canon in the most world history revealing flashback in the manga?</br></br>  <br>oh that's neat</br>  <br>So if he were to join, he'd just become Luffy's student? <br><br>Honestly I just want Bartomelo to join more so. I know he's got his own crew but I think if he were given the chance he'd jump to it. <br><br> I'll settle for alliance tho </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's literally drawn the same, and other than luffys hat, in 17,000 pages, no other hat is.<br>It isn't an assumption, it's a drawing of the same unique hat.</br></br>  <br> &gt;drawn twice <br> on the same farm kid </br></br>  <br>You wouldn't think Sabo was a Noble looking at him on trash island.<br>that it's on the same person proves it is not random, none of the other "farm kids" have that hat.</br></br>  <br> It's literally drawn the same <br><br>as I said same style=/=same hat<br><br>why do you assume its the same and not a similar hat made by the same artisan? Maybe that kid wearing a similar hat demonstrates that Roger's hat came from the area or descendants of the people living there?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> that it's on the same person proves it is not random <br><br>why would the hat switch around?<br><br> none of the other "farm kids" have that hat. <br>nor do they need to</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can say it all you want but if Oda draws Zoro I'm gonna believe it's Nami until something suggests otherwise.<br><br>The hat is an older character than Zoro and drawn just as unique.</br></br></br>  <br> if Oda draws Zoro I'm gonna believe it's Nami until something suggests otherwise. <br><br>is this a strawman? how ironic<br><br> The hat is an older character than Zoro <br>we know this already<br><br> and drawn just as unique. <br>THIS is fan speculation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> zoro I'm gonna believe it is Nami <br>Welp I'm done.<br>Can't wait to see another straw hat drawn just like luffys that isn't his hat.<br>Oh wait there isn't one, so the skypiea hat is obviously his and has been passed down, which is supported by it being handed down in canon by the pirate king</br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless you can show a duplicate of the straw hat it is not speculation. Technically Zoro has been faked by Mr. 2, so the straw hat is MORE unique in its depiction than Zoro.<br>That you refuse to accept this is irrelevant to the truth of it.</br></br>  <br> Unless you can show a duplicate of the straw hat it is not speculation <br><br>this is where your logic is flawed though. You have no way of knowing its the same hat whether 3 of them exist or not. Another hat looking similar doesnt make it the same hat and you cant prove otherwise</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly, it is one hat passed down.</br>  <br><br>Robin has double Ds though.</br></br>  <br> Exactly, it is one hat passed down. <br><br>exactly what? Nothing I posted implies its the same hat</br></br></br>  <br>That's the issue though, you'd be right if other hats looked like it.<br>None do, so when it is drawn it is recognizeable to the point that the protagonist is colloquially named after it.<br>Thus unless you allege it doesn't look like the straw hat, or can show that hats exist which look like it, but are different hats from the one lift wears, it's proven Luffys hat is at least 400 years old and probably 800</br></br></br>  <br> There is no reason to believe the straw hat drawn to look like luffy's hat, twice, in the norland flashback, is not luffy's hat. <br><br>What the fuck are you talking about man<br>It's a fucking straw hat<br><br>There's no reason to believe it's the same hat unless you're a turbo autist<br><br>There's a reason why Shank's gift to Luffy wasn't some jeweled impressive looking hat, just a regular straw hat. To show that even mundane objects can mean a lot if they're connected to people you care about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you'd be right if other hats looked like it. <br>this isnt true in the slightest <br><br>other hats dont have to look like Luffy's to prove the one in the flashback isnt the same. Until we're actually shown that hat being passed down TO Roger, then you cant say its the same one because you dont know</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shanks arm got cut off before he gave Luffy that hat.<br>It being drawn the same is a very legitimate reason in a drawn story.</br></br>  <br> trying to be able to backtrack when the story ends and it's made even more obvious <br>Haha.</br></br>  <br> Shanks arm got cut off before he gave Luffy that hat. <br><br>what are you even talking about? Shank's arm has nothing to do with anything</br></br></br>  <br>please dont resort to greentexting because you cant refute me. If you have nothing more to say then bow out gracefully<br><br>otherwise make a point that actually makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks was hiding in east blue for a year, Luffy found Gomu Gomu at the end of that year, on the same day he got the straw hat and Shanks set sail after saying "protect this."<br>Sure it has sentimental value, it just also has more value than that, being 400 years old.</br></br>  <br>All of my points make perfect sense.<br>A unique object being drawn is assumed as that object until proved otherwise, not the other way around.<br>You have yet to refute this or show that Luffy's hat from Kenshin all the way through 17,000 pages of one piece is not unique.<br>Since it is so unique, when it is drawn in a flashback, like rayleighs of Roger, we can assume it is Luffy's hat.<br>This doesn't stop applying just because one of the flashbacks it appears in is 400 years ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and what does Shanks arm have to do with any of that. Setting aside that your timeline is a tad off in the beginning, how would Shanks even know if it was 400 years old?<br><br>He gave the hat to Luffy because Luffy reminded him of Roger, who he's pretty much the living embodiment of</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it was two days. Shanks directly stated to Whitebeard that he lost his arm because he bet the future on Luffy.<br>When you place a bet you lay down chips. But I won't say more than that because you will derail from:<br/></br></br>  <br> All of my points make perfect sense. <br>none of them prove anything. Not one of them.<br><br> A unique object being drawn is assumed as that object until proved otherwise, not the other way around. <br>The only person defining a unique object is you. You arent Oda and dont know HOW he'd depict similar style/identical hats<br> You have yet to refute this or show that Luffy's hat from Kenshin all the way through 17,000 pages of one piece is not unique. <br>Why would a hat from a different manga matter in the OP universe?<br> Since it is so unique, when it is drawn in a flashback, like rayleighs of Roger, we can assume it is Luffy's hat. <br>No we can not.<br><br> This doesn't stop applying just because one of the flashbacks it appears in is 400 years ago. <br>there's no proof that applied in the first place. That's YOUR speculation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't need to prove it.<br>When Luffy's hat is drawn it is the default assumption.<br>When it was drawn on Rogers head in one panel in only one flashback we knew it was Luffy's even though shanks could have just had another straw hat.<br><br>Your only issue is you don't like that it is in not lands flashback because it violates your belief that the hat is insignificant beyond sentiment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shanks directly stated to Whitebeard that he lost his arm because he bet the future on Luffy. <br><br>as in the next generation of pirates because he saw Roger's will in Luffy and believed in it</br></br></br>  <br>Or you know it's just a fucking straw hat drawn worn on a complete nobody 5 million chapters ago with no reference to it otherwise</br>  what one piece movies are worth watching besides baron, strong world and z?  <br>Except that is extremely unlikely because Oda intentionally thought out every panel of Norlands story, and there is no reason for the norland the liar book to have the straw hat as its a fabricated tale of what happened yet Oda still included it that second time. He did not have to draw the scene twice at all but he intentionally did so.<br>You're a moron if you believe he accidentally included that hat.</br></br>  <br> I don't need to prove it. <br> When Luffy's hat is drawn it is the default assumption. <br> When it was drawn on Rogers head in one panel in only one flashback we knew it was Luffy's even though shanks could have just had another straw hat. <br><br>All of these people are related/in contact with eachother. Random Noland kid is separated by time AND association. <br><br>I dont believe it because there isnt any proof. None. You're trying to urge me to accept head canon just because you WANT to believe you found so hidden relevance in a farmboy's hat</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Oda preparing to have the top 6 of the worst generation duke it out? Kid, Hawkins and Apoo vs Luffy, Law and Drake? <br>I expect this post Wano</br></br>  <br>Movie 4 and 3D chase are alright</br>  <br> Except that is extremely unlikely because Oda intentionally thought out every panel of Norlands story <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>do you actually think oda draws luffys hat with it in mind that its the hat from kenshin? it has nothing to do with kenshin you complete autist. there is no reason to believe the hat goes any further back than roger, if you actually have some complicated theory that its hundreds of years old then you are trying too hard</br>  <br> Noland isn't associated with the straw hats <br>Except he very obviously is, being relevant as far along the journey as Dressrosa.<br>Norland either went backwards and was at green bit before jaya or he went the same way as Luffy across the grand line.</br></br></br>  <br> You're a moron if you believe he accidentally included that hat. <br><br>You're a moron if you don't think that was just an Easter Egg<br><br>It doesn't have to be unintentional to not mean anything</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not Drake vs   Monster Point Chopper </br>  <br>I didnt say anything about Noland. We're talking about the kid.</br>  <br>This is the only valid alternate possibility.<br>It is unlikely because it is the straw hat, something that has been in an equal amount of chapters as Luffy.</br></br>  <br>But Norland is in panel with the straw hat and the kid.</br>  <br>are you saying he stole the hat off a random kid to pass down to Roger's ancestors?</br>  <br> Norland either went backwards and was at green bit before jaya or he went the same way as Luffy across the grand line. <br><br>If that's your reasoning literally every godamn sailor on the grandline has an association with the straw hats</br></br></br>  <br> complicated theory <br>It looks like the same hat so it might be the same hat.<br><br>That's not very complicated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No but it is possible Norland gave that kid the hat, or someone associated with Norland.</br>  <br>That four weeks felt more like a year</br>  <br> No but it is possible <br>sure its possible, i never argued against that</br></br>  <br> something that has been in an equal amount of chapters as Luffy <br><br>You are literally the most retarded person I've ever talked to on 4chan, holy shit<br><br>Luffy wears the straw hat you dolt, of course it's going to be in the same chapters as him. That doesn't mean anything beyond what we already know; the hat is special to him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It looks like the same hat so it might be the same hat. <br> might be <br><br>Nigga might be isn't what you've been arguing all this time. Although the possibility is quite low that it actually is, just by using common sense about how retarded that would be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also I am not saying he took the hat from the kid.<br>Rayleigh stated all this about fate, just read this full page and know that Roger actually says<br> turn the world on its head <br>Roger was wearing the hat when he was "ready" in his own words, but otherwise preferred a different hat.<br><br> there may be no such thing as coincidences in this world <br>Above Roger wears luffy hat, and you argue that the straw hat in norlands story is a coincidence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you <br>That's not me anon.</br></br>  <br> Norland <br>How's Binami, Tanjihado Lofulamingo, and Bisoromi Bear?<br><br>wtf is this 2004?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rayleigh is reminiscing of Roger while thinking of Luffy. It's reasonable to think that it's the same hat, given that Shanks was also in Roger's crew. If that wasn't the case, I'd assume it was a different straw hat. <br><br>There's no fucking connection between some random farm boy on Livneel and the Straw Hats. It's an easter egg bro.</br></br></br>  <br>Would be cool if it was</br>  <br>I was watching the fight, he does much better than law.</br>  <br> watching <br><br>But nah Smoker only does better than Law because Vergo had Law's heart. Once Law got the heart back he fucked that dudes ass.</br></br></br>  <br>I just watched the anime version of that fight myself. Law one shot Vergo.<br><br>Law is infinitely more powerful than Smoker currently is, which is clearly shown when he wrecked his shit outside of the facility on Punk Hazard, and in the SAD room when he one shot Vergo.<br>Smoker on the other hand, was consistently outmatched at every turn. To be fair, Vergo was a damn powerhouse.<br>But yeah, if Law had his heart from the get-go, he would have won immediately. End of story.<br><br>Smoker is unfortunately a fucking jobber and there's nothing we can do about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I just watched the anime version of that fight myself. <br><br>Anime version also makes Hody faster than gear 2 Luffy, and CC almost as strong as Gear 3 Luffy.</br></br></br>  <br>Why couldn't two people in the same crew have a straw hat?<br>Your pretending to be consistent but actually a hypocrite.<br>The straw hat on Rogers head was assumed Luffy's by appearance. The other statements just compliment the obvious.<br>But because Norland was 400 years ago and this conflicts with your view of the hat, you deny it.<br>Maybe you just werent reading weekly when it was first revealed that Roger had a straw hat;<br>And Lvneel is not some joke country.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a faggot and it showed up on my youtube recommended videos. I didn't actually watch Punk Hazard, FI killed officially killed the anime for me and I switched to the manga during the FI flashback.<br><br>The anime Vergo fight is basically the same as it is in the manga, the big difference is somehow Smoker is less of a jobber in the anime.</br></br></br>   mfw you faggots are actually arguing about the fucking hat <br> mfw this idiot believes the fun easter egg in the Noland flashback is relevant </br>  <br> I noticed the straw hat in norland's flashback too I swear guys! <br>The only value of your post.</br></br>  <br>You act like there's only one of us saying that it might actually be more relevant than we've been led to believe.<br><br>And yet I'm also getting the sneaking suspicion that you're actually just one person who keeps posting shit like <br> <br><br><br><br> I think I fell for the bait, boys. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT DAT MONKEY IS WEARING STRAW HAT THAT IS LUFFYS HAT</br>  <br>If that hat is relevant I'll throw myself off Tokyo Tower in full Bon Clay cosplay and a sign with /a/ taped to my chest</br>  <br>do you think kanjuro's cabbage is tasty</br>  <br> being so stupid you don't realize the poster who's arguing Luffy's hat is in Norland's flashback posted this picture <br>Also, proving you backtracked. One post ago it was an Easter egg, Luffy's hat but not significant, now you are back to arguing it isn't luffy's hat.</br></br>  <br>nope, I just got sick of talking to you since you had no proof besides<br> muh unique style <br> muh rare grass hat <br> muh kenshin </br></br></br></br>  <br>I am okay with this and will hold you to it, anon.<br><br>I assume we mean relevant beyond the whole "passing the torch to a new generation" thing, because it already holds some relevance, and it wouldn't be fun to have you sudoku now.<br><br>In return, I will stop talking about the hat because I'm pretty sick of the faggotry that has been achieved in this thread now too. I can't stop the others, but hopefully we can make it die off by the time the next thread rolls around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't harm yourself when it's made even more obvious anon.</br>  <br> you <br>Funny thing is, I'm not even the guy you were arguing with the whole time. I was in the thread a few hours ago, and came back for like, two posts. I've never once mentioned Kenshin. That's definitely just Oda drawing it ahead of time because he could.</br></br>  <br> implying that me calling it an easter egg means it is Luffy's hat and not just a hat that looks like it </br>  <br> I'm not even the guy you were arguing with the whole time <br><br>of course not. Im not the guy you were talking to. I stopped reply around that Robin post and someone else has been arguing the point since</br></br></br>  <br> nope, I just got sick of talking to you since you had no proof <br> of course not. Im not the guy you were talking to. <br>Were you pretending to be that guy? That's silly. Why would you do a thing like that?</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>post yfw we've been passing down the hat arguing just like how the pirates have been passing down the hat<br> GODA is proven fact </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;And yet I'm also getting the sneaking suspicion that you're actually just one person <br> nope, I just got sick of talking to you since you had no proof besides... <br> &gt;Funny thing is, I'm not even the guy you were arguing with the whole time <br> of course not. Im not the guy you were talking to. <br><br>apparently both players left awhile ago and new people joined in. I left like 30 minutes ago</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> just like how the pirates have been passing down the hat <br>Starting at Roger of course</br></br>  <br>thats how laws power works though. he would one shot whitebeard if he could hit him. (whitebeard wouldnt go full retard and charge him though)</br>  <br><br> mfw </br></br>  <br>Is that picture supposed to connect that farm kid with Luffy?</br>  <br>Only in that they both possessed the same straw hat and so did Gol D Roger and Red Haired Shanks.</br>    <br>and how is that conveyed in that picture?</br>  <br>Haha silly bitch<br><br>WHY IS THERE NO FUCKING HENTAI OF HER<br><br>ACTUALLY, WHY IS THERE ALMOST NOTHING OF THIS ENTIRE SERIES<br><br>THEY HAVE 2 FUCKING LOLIS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In my defense, I am currently the torch bearer for the hat, and back when the discussion started four hours ago with posts like<br><br><br>I was defending the theory, because it seems reasonable as hell. That said, I mentioned it was a goddamn theory and have maintained that the entire time. <br><br>Hilariously just before that, I was debunking someone's retarded theory that Roger discovered the Saint Bliss and uncovered a secret about his past, and that the guy from the ship was actually in possession of the rubber fruit 200 years prior to the current time.<br><br>Okay so I said I'd stop so I'm done. I have better shit to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It shows how Eichero Oda focused on Norland (The Liar) Montblanc. Luffy wasn't shown reading stories about Dr. hiluluk, Bellemere, or etc.<br>Hell, I think this is the only time Luffy was shown reading a book, like <br> even a retard knows Norland is important and the straw hat appearing in his flashback/story book is not a coincidence. <br>It is boring to see you attempt to turn a colored cover page of luffy reading about Norland into something more than a jab at your own comprehension, as proved when you believe it's an argument.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not who you're responding to but to imply that Luffy being entertained by a picture -book for children more than deep personal shit about his own crew who he already knows he loves implies the hat is the same is a bit of a stretch</br>  <br>usopp better pray to enel he never ends up in that town</br>  <br>How does Noland getting screentime mean anything about the hat? Being read about doesnt suddenly mean he's more important<br><br>And STILL doesnt prove that a random strawhat on a random kid is the one that Roger passed down to Shanks<br><br>I dont care that you like to headcanon it, but im not taking it as fact because you REALLY want it to be THE hat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am from the side of hat importance, and I want everyone to disregard this obvious bait.</br>  <br>I didn't imply that. I said Oda making a point of it on a colored cover page shows Oda's focus on the subject.<br><br>Your shit is your own keep it that way.<br><br>The straw hat is drawn on panel in Norlands flashback so I don't have a reason to argue about that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The straw hat <br>A straw hat<br><br>that hat could be pink for all you know</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. Post another one that looks like Luffy's.<br>There is not one.</br></br>  <br>Stop. Just stop.<br><br>You have not added anything to the thread, what you have said has been said before, and you are replying to bait. We need to collectively move past the hat.</br></br></br>    <br>According to some the colored manga is official.<br>Is the straw hat in Norland's flashback pink there? Is the band green or black?<br>I don't consider the colored manga as canon but it still at least proves you are grasping.</br></br></br>  <br> According to some the colored manga is official. <br><br>Is it colored by Oda?</br></br></br>  Chapter tonight  <br>Thank fuck, we need a change of topic.</br>  <br>Like I said I agree it's not canon, but it shows that you have to grasp to color it pink, and that you don't have to grasp at all to say it's the same straw hat.</br>  <br>Was that supposed to be a question? Or are we getting this one a day early?</br>  <br>Cool beans.</br>  <br> but it shows that you have to grasp to color it pink, <br><br>im not saying its pink, im saying you dont know WHAT color it is<br><br>Oda didnt color that page so it is unable to prove anything. You cant KNOW whether or not that hat is Roger's hat because Oda himself hasnt made any connections<br><br>It's all speculation based on probably's and perhaps'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so how many other characters died outside of flashbacks besides ace, whitebeard, roshio, and the countless amounts of impel down prisoners  <br>No it is based 100% on it being drawn by Oda in the Norland flashback. You could paint the hat it would still be Luffys though. It really doesn't need more of a basis than being drawn in canon.</br>  <br> You could paint the hat <br>you realize its straw, right?<br><br> No it is based 100% on it being drawn by Oda <br>then that means shit all because you can't prove its the same hat. Despite what you think, looking almost identical doesnt make it the same. It COULD just be the way Oda draws strawhats by default</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Countless amounts of impel down prisoners <br>You assume.<br><br>I mean, I assumed everyone died in Skypeia when they got their face lightning'd off, and somehow literally nobody died. I'm actually more skeptical of deaths in this series than I am in A Song of Ice and Fire.<br><br>It's fucking ridiculous, is what it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Citation needed<br>There's nothing at AP or redon's spic site</br></br>  <br>They didn't have anything up for last chapter either</br>  <br>The only other straw hats look different. The one in Norland's flashback doesn't.<br>It is the same hat to the eye, whereas all others are not, so it is the same straw hat.</br></br>  <br>Moria marine zombies were alive at the beginning of the war.</br>  <br> The only other straw hats look different. <br>yes and? I said default<br><br>he has a different style for imposter hats(Demaro, Saruyama) For plain strawhats? they look the same(Luffy, Livneel kid)</br></br></br></br>  <br>I already posted Masira's, which is just as plain as Luffy's, but very different.<br>Lvneel kid had the same straw hat as luffy is more likely than not given the fact straw hat luffy's straw hat is always unique all story.</br></br>  <br> Lvneel kid had the same straw hat as luffy is more likely than not given the fact straw hat luffy's straw hat is always unique all story. <br><br>yeah sure but it isnt proof</br></br></br>  <br> luffy's straw hat is always unique all story. <br><br>until the Lvneel kid of course which may be proof that Luffy's hat isnt unique rather than proving that it is</br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay, boys, we've had this discussion before.<br><br>Yes, the hat looks identical.<br>No, there is no proof that it is the same hat.<br>Yes, Luffy's hat is unique in all of One Piece except for the two instances with the Lvneel kid. This gives lots of credence to the theory, but it remains a theory.<br><br>Can we move on now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, the hat looks identical. <br> No, there is no proof that it is the same hat. <br> Yes, Luffy's hat is unique in all of One Piece except for the two instances with the Lvneel kid. This gives lots of credence to the theory, but it remains a theory. <br><br>this is what ive been saying theory=/=fact</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and that guy is not going to admit it, so you can both keep bashing your heads against the same wall everyone else was several hours ago, or we can drop this nonsense already and move onto something else.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128744397 <br> Or rather the probability that this hat is different is the same as the probability that Roger wore the same straw hat as Shanks and Luffy. <br><br>no. Lvneel kid was from hundreds of years ago. Roger to Shanks to Garp is a generation. And I really dont care about probability. I'm saying it isnt canon and there's no proof of it being canon.<br><br>It's fanon unless Oda steps up and proves otherwise</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont see what the big deal is with debating<br><br>No one else is saying anything. It's not like anything else is happening in thread because no one else is here or there'd BE conversation running along ours</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It baffles me that people don't realise it's just an easter egg</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats bullshit though because the same straw hat Luffy wears is literally drawn in the Norland canon.<br>You have to show it's a different hat, because there is no different hat that is depicted like it, and it is the most famous hat.</br></br>  <br> Thats bullshit though because the same straw hat Luffy wears is literally drawn in the Norland canon. <br>[Citation Needed]</br></br>  <br><br>There is no reason to doubt what is drawn in the flashback, and Luffy's straw hat is drawn there.<br>As shown by how every depiction of the straw hat luffy wears, regardless of who was wearing it, being actually his same hat.<br>The default assumption therefore isn't negated just because it's drawn in a place you didn't expect it to be</br></br></br></br>  <br> There is no reason to doubt what is drawn in the flashback <br><br>it's not about doubt, its about proof which you have none of. Insisting its the same hat doesnt magically make it the same hat no matter how many times you say it<br><br> and Luffy's straw hat is drawn there <br>[Citation Needed]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I had an argument with some One Piece nerds.<br>Who would win in a fight Crocodile vs Enel.<br><br>I personally think Crocodile but everyone was saying Enel because he would have a 500mil bounty and he can use lightning. So /a/ who would win?</br></br></br>  <br>Again the drawing of the hat is proof, you are right it is not about doubt.<br>The same hat as the one Luffy wears is literally drawn in Norland's flashback.</br></br>  <br><br>Bounty has never been indicative of power level, merely a numerical representation of the threat people pose against the WG.<br><br>They gave an 80million dollar bounty to an 8 year old after all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lightning against sand <br>depends on who oda wants to win</br></br>  <br>Blackbeard had a 0 bounty and captured a 550 million bounty to become a shichibukai.</br>  <br>thats where it was hard to pick.<br><br>lightning vs sand. like wtf looks like a stale match</br></br></br>  <br>If we go by logic, Enel would win because the heat from his electricity would turn Crocodile to glass.</br>  <br>just like it should have melted rubber?</br>  <br>That's why I said "If we go by logic".</br>  <br> Again the drawing of the hat is proof <br>it isnt.<br><br> The same hat as the one Luffy wears is literally drawn in Norland's flashback <br>[where is your proof?]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enel would be able to hit Croc with physical attacks but he wouldn't be able to overcome sands insulation properties if he couldn't overcome rubber.<br><br>Crocodiles Sand being an insulator like rubber would make Enel tangible and therefore vulnerable to all Crocodile's attacks as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Assuming Croc busts out haki, then Croc.</br>  Fuji's making his move  <br> Maynard sighting <br><br>We better see Gambia. If he ends up banished to cover stories, I will be pissed</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit</br>  <br>Yeah, that would be the most logical thing if Croc vs Enel happens.

I don't want you bleeding for those scum." <br> She snatches her hand back <br> "Don't you get it!? I don't care about them! I care about-" <br> "...the Mera Mera fruit, right?" <br> Rebecca stares <br> "You've been acting strange ever since the news broke. I know it's what you want." <br> "If you know that then why would you stop me-" <br> "I don't want to fight you." <br> Rebecca's eyes grow wide <br> "He made me a promise... Doflamingo. If I win this upcoming tournament he gave me his word I'd be welcomed as a new member of his inner circle." <br> Bellamy stands up <br> "Can you imagine it!? It's what I've wanted ever since I was a kid! Me, one of Doffy's inner circle!" <br> He turns to look at Rebecca <br> "And when that happens the first thing I'll do is ask- no. Beg. I'll beg if I have to. For your freedom." <br> He raises his arm towards Rebecca <br> "Rings are so common, and easily lost. I'm a pirate. I've seen so many rings. But a devil fruit, that you don't see everyday. I'll come back for you with the Mera Mera fruit as a gift." <br> He bends down to stare Rebecca in the eye <br> "For your hand." <br> Rebecca is speechless <br> Bellamy stands up, both arms spread open, gesturing at the other prisoner gladiators <br> "And all you miserable bastards here will be freed and invited to the wedding! Walk away, or come join me under my new flag!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> <br>One day while Bellamy was masturbating, Rebecca got wood. She could no longer help himself! She watched as Bellamy stroked his juicy kawaii cock. She approached Bellamy which startled him and make him pee everywhere on the floor and on Rebecca too. Being drenched in his urine made him harder than ever! Rebecca: "Bellamy Senpai! I'm alive and I want to be INSIDE OF YOU." Bellamy: "Oh Rebecca Chan! I always knew you were alive! I want to stuff you up my kawaii ass!" Rebecca grabbed a bunch of flavored live and rubbed it all over her own head Rebecca: "Oh my! It's cherry flavored lube! Cherry is my favorite! Rebecca then stuffed her head up into Bellamy's tight ass! The other fighter around the room watched intently as Rebecca shoved her head back and forth into Bellamy's nice ass, continuously making a squishy wet noise. The others also became aroused and they all gathered around Rebecca and Bellamy and started to urinate all over them, and then they started to masturbate. Bellamy: "Oh my goodness, Rebecca Chan! You are churning my insides up so well! Your nose is stimulating my prostate! OH YES! All the others became so aroused by this, that they could not help themselves anymore! They pushed Rebecca completely inside, and they all went inside. All of them wanted to be inside Bellamy's nice round ass. Bellamy: "No wait guys! My ass cannot hold this much! I'm getting so full! All thes went inside of poor squirming Bellamy and pretty much, he was beyond full, and died from having his insides completely damaged. Luffy came inside and found Bellamy, dead with a huge ass hemorrhage on his anus, with a HUGE belly full of pirates.</br> </br></br></br>  August 17 <br>Obon Holiday<br><br>So we get two chapters and then another 2 weeks of nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>Ace was an overpriced shitter, how did he even get 550 millions?</br>  <br>Sand turns into glass when struck by lightning.

Donmai!  Perfect anime doesn't exis-  I don't usually post on /a/ but this is more like /co/  But the El Chavo animu is one of those rare cases where the live action version is far better.  <br> the El Chavo <br> the El </br></br>   not franklin and beyond or Nichijou season 2 <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rBy<wbr>c2iMz84U</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mpa<wbr>QukVWQmQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Which SCP would you fug.  682 and 173  Adding 166 as well.<br><br>But anyone would fug her.</br></br>  This would be the fucking cool but then I remember all the fucking scary SCP there are.  Can you fuck a box of pizza?<br>Because 458 is best SCP.</br>  <br>173 is damn scary.<br><br>And disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone whose favorite pizza place closed down several years ago, I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>Fuck, why cant that be real?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-458<br><br>Also, SCP anime would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never carry out Procedure 110-Montauk   I would Candy. 1548 will me along with the rest of the human race.  105 of course  I wrote the original, and yes I wish it were not so shit.   <br>You know, SCP-166 could be used as a way to determine if the universe considers trannies to still be male depending on whether or not they react to her.</br>  Why dont they just give 682 a picture of 096's face and let them kill each other?  <br>Because it would probably end up just like when they tried to use 173 to kill him.</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>It's been a while since I read the log, but I believe 173 got driven into a corner, and 682 grew a few dozen extra eyes, then made them bulletproof when the researchers tried to shoot them out.</br>  <br>http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--<wbr>files/scp-682/682.mp3<br><br>Because 682 just won't fucking die. They tried crystallizing the damn thing and it didn't work.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>But could 096 actually have died to either 173 and 682?<br><br>Because I think that 096 is actually one of the worst SCPs, especially because of all the photos that were spread around it in the world without people realizing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>would be a great idea.</br>  <br>If they really wanted to terminate 096, then I'm sure they would have done it by now.</br>  <br>076 vs 682 or 096<br>what happens?</br></br>  <br>/a/ would be the perfect recruiting ground.</br>  <br>Shit you wrote 105? That's one of the most recognizable ones now.</br>  <br>to be honest I like to concept, but looking back now I don't like the execution. I've asked some of the writers still around for a rewrite but they said people wouldn't be happy if they did.</br>  <br>What, preggo raping until she miscarriages?<br><br>Not my cup of tea tbh.<br><br>But I'd volunteer donating the daily sperm for 166.</br></br></br></br></br>  I stopped following this because there was a giant amount of shitty SCPs when it started getting more well known. Has there been any big developments in lore or anything lately?  <br>This. I remember following it about 3, maybe, years ago, but stopping because the influx of new users due to the game (Which was actually cool, it was pretty fun) and it was hard to filter out the shit.</br>  <br>The author is adamant that it is not rape, and is much worse than rape.</br>  <br>What could it be?<br>Slowly cutting her, or taking her organs out and dancing on them or something like that?</br></br>  <br>Probably the more painful kinds of torture. Drilling into the bones, small repeated acid baths, things like that?<br>Nothing is scarier, as it were. It's never going to be explained clearly.</br></br>  <br>It's hard imagining something worse than rape that won't leave any permanent damage and that you can keep doing week after week for years.</br>  <br>"Permanent" damage has a different meaning when you have all the sciencemagic in the world including a reusable regenerative pendant.</br>  <br>Seconded</br>  <br> 076 vs 682 <br>Ended up with 076 having 60% of it's body destroyed<br><br> 682 vs 096 <br>Dunno, 682 would probaly win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is 682 so strong?</br>  SCP-999 if it turns into a slime-girl.  <br>682 was also completely fucked up after the fight<br><br> why is 682 so strong? <br> Bad writing. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't mean it can't include rape.</br>  <br>Plot armor. Any number of SCPs should have completely removed it from existence already.</br>  <br>Because it's virtually indestructible. It's normally kept suspended in a cell flooded with acid. They tried to crystallize it, which was painful but ultimately not lethal. On top of that, it's just very strong and can grow stronger from eating.</br>  <br>Then they probably torture her until she is nearly dead and then heal her afterwards.</br>  <br>Nah, the joke of 999 is that he looks like an abomination but everyone finds him cute.</br>  Reading the SCP-231 article makes me feel like shit.  <br>That much is obvious. The question is, what kinds of torture?</br>  <br><br> All persons within the wave’s range collapse into crippling fits of laughter, allowing SCP-682 to escape and slaughter all in its path. Meanwhile, SCP-999 quickly rescues as many persons as it can, taking them to a safe place to recover from SCP-682’s "laughter wave" while agents suppress and recontain SCP-682. <br><br>Holy shit, SCP-999 is such a bro.<br><br>I really like SCPs that aren't unimaginable horrors, they get boring after a while. I like the camera one where it takes a picture of your truest desire and the other machine that gives you any kind of drink you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bookkeeper SCP is the best.</br>  <br>076 is just a really strong guy with respawn hax.</br>  <br>My favorite is the clockwork one that modifies stuff based on the input.<br>It's the coolest shit.</br></br>  <br>Stupid regeneration that breaks physics.</br>  <br>Same thing, to this day i still wanna know what happens if you put a monkey/human on it, the parts with it were all [REDACTED] or censored.</br>  <br>I like the experiment logs of that one and the greenish sponge sphere.</br>  <br>what number is that?</br>    <br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1230<br><br>Nicest SCP ever.</br></br></br>  <br>I want SCP-1230 to be my husbando. I'm gay for a magic book.</br>  <br>Yeah, that guy is boss as hell.</br>     http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076 <br> SCP-076-2 resembles a lean Semitic human male in his late twenties. Hair is black, and eyes are gray, skin tone olive. Subject is 1.96 m in height and 81.65 kg in weight. Numerous tattoos depicting arcane and occult iconography are present all over the body (mostly in the form of leering demonic faces) and ranges from subtle to openly ostentatious. Subject, when encased inside SCP-076-1, is technically dead. <br>  <br> SCP-076-2's most unusual ability, however, is its ability to apparently materialize bladed weapons out of nowhere. Slow-motion video footage reveals that the blades in question are actually pulled from a miniature dimensional rift described as a "small hole in space." Where this portal leads is unknown, as is how SCP-076-2 is capable of generating said rifts. Footage of the blades in question shows them to be made out of a completely non-reflective black material appearing as a "black void in space." As the blades rapidly vanish after leaving the subject's possession, no structural analysis is possible at this time.<br>Wait a second, isn't this just Gilgamesh+Avenger?</br></br></br></br>  ID on all?<br><br>Gelbooru still is incomplete with that.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's basically Gil, but more hax.<br><br>He's actually Abel or Cain, cant remember.<br><br>Also, most SCPs are capable killing Servants.</br></br></br></br></br>  And why was 953 suppossed to be deadly or scary again?<br><br>She's basically a 2hu</br></br>  <br>Just finished reading the article<br>If only there were people so nice in real life</br></br>  Boy their shithole really went to hell. From what I see now anyone who has been around the longest now exists within a huge circle-jerk which is padded by "fans" and they have this whole group peer pressure shit going on to keep their crappy OC in while booting out any dissenters. <br><br>What's more is they have a monopoly on the entire thing by making it incredibly iconic. I remember back when the logo was half a cat, it being somewhat of a mascot. Where's the cat? <br>Now the place is fanfiction.net-tier garbage and nobody can reclaim its once former quality because if anyone were to create anything similar they'd be seen as a shoddy rip-off by their shitty subcommunity that has never watched the Friday the Thirteenth series. <br><br>Get out, /v/ermin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Less hax. Mary sue awesome swords, not bullshit plot hack macguffins that can do anything that he needs at the moment.</br>  man what would be /x/ and  /lit/ 's reaction to this?  <br>How did Japan even know about SCP?<br><br>there's quite a bit of art on pixiv as well.</br></br></br>  <br>SCP was created in /x/<br>/lit/ would have your average reaction, some are good, other not.</br></br>  <br>http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/</br>  <br>Youkai are all deadly and scary. The Foundation would have a hell of a time rounding up Gensokyo.</br>  <br>/x/ has long since disowned SCP; go there and ask right now. As welcoming as they are of shitposting you'll be surprised at how quickly they'll tell you to shut the fuck up and leave.</br>    <br>SCP is pretty creepy though, anyone on japan with too much free time will discover SCPs.</br>  <br>results:<br><br><br>2hus cant be contained.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only recognize 073, 076, 096, 105, 173, and 682. At least, those are the ones I'm sure of.</br>  Which SCP would be the best waifu?  <br>But 2hus are good girls.</br>  <br>999, the guy who makes Guro toys (forgot the number) and the eye ball things (that i also forgot the number) are there too.<br><br><br>I don't know waifu, but see  for husbando</br></br></br></br>  <br> but upon opening SCP-1230, all its pages were soaking wet with the same message on every page: “I’m so sorry. I never intended for this to happen. I just wanted to make people happy.” repeated over and over. SCP-1230 remained in this state for three weeks and its desk  <br><br>Oh god, that's so sad.</br></br></br>  I like 106 and the one about the furry murdering korean foxgirl. <br><br><br>that's horrible, but funny. My favorite is doctor bright's things he's not allowed to do</br></br></br>  <br>That's the fate of any community that got too successful/popular for its own damn good.</br>  So 073 and 076 are ancient astronauts or something?  Which one is the little girl that telepathically compels people to rape her?  <br>I thought that was from the Monster Girl Encyclopedia thing</br>  #11-18.  <br>191 is carrying the calculator and digital camera.</br>  They need to purge every humanoid SCP and animal SCP. The ratio of shitty ones to good ones is too high to justify. <br>Of course it will never happen because 90% of them are written by esteemed members of the community's hierarchy.</br>  <br> The camera that photographs your truest desire <br><br> Subject: SCP-173 <br> Photographed Activity: Standing in its container. <br> Photo Result: No change. <br><br>Either it's not truly sentient or  it's exactly where it wants to be.  I'm not sure which is worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what's so bad about the latter.<br>Maybe it doesn't want to kill people.</br></br>  <br>Evidence from any time someone blinks while in its presence suggests otherwise.</br>  <br> Subject: SCP-451 <br> Photographed Activity: Weeping in Site-19 cafeteria. <br> Photo Result: SCP-451 lies awake in a bunk in the Site-19 sleeping quarters, surrounded by other staff members. SCP-451 exhibits a look of relief on his face. <br><br>Oh god.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be an unwilling reflex response.</br>  <br><br>According to her case file, no other SCPs, drugs, or procedures are allowed to be used on her aside from Procedure 110 montauk and the Class A Amnesiac she must be administered weekly so that the emotional pain she must endure is always at it's peak.<br><br>It's just rape, at worst, it's gang rape and beating. Nothing she couldn't survive on her own, but definitely shit that causes her a lot of pain and possibly very minor permanent damage. She's not allowed to be given anesthetics either.<br><br>Shits fucked. At least they're trying to find a cure for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's worse than rape.<br>The foundation is just more imaginative than you.</br></br>  <br>It's not.<br>The author is just full of shit. gotta go for that true horror factor mate.<br>They aren't mutilating her. They're emotionally torturing her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not torture if it's for science</br>  <br>it's not rape if she can't remember</br>  <br>Then why do the doctors assigned to SCP 231-7 commit sudoku as result of merely witnessing the procedure.</br>  Is there a loli SCP?<br>Can't remember.</br>  <br>The scientific data is just too much for them to handle.</br>  <br>It'd clearly have to be much worse than rape to induce that.</br>  <br><br>I love the friendly SCPs. Because despite their power, they still strive to be decent things in a world of fucked up monsters and horrors.</br></br>  How come sometimes I see japanese artists doing SCP shit?<br>How do they find out about it? Most jap artists are terrible at english.</br>  <br>Sometimes it's the japs who translate our shit and not the other way around.</br>  <br/>  <br>The one that befriended 682, the cyborg and the reality warper spring to mind</br>  <br>231 probably counts. <br>She's between the ages of  [REDACTED]  and  [REDACTED] <br><br>You think some people wouldn't kill themsevles if it was their job to to watch an innocent, probably underaged, be repeatedly raped/beaten. <br>Not everyone gets as much pleasure from watching that as you do. Trust me anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohhhhh</br>  <br>Lots.</br>  <br>Dude.<br><br> Subject: SCP-085 <br> Photographed Activity: Tinkering with a drawn car. <br> Photo Result: Engaged in the same activity, however, the photograph depicts 085 as a three-dimensional human. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not just the act but also the realization that nothing can or will be done to help her.</br>  <br>Which SCP is the camera one?</br>  <br>978</br>   http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-914 <br> Input: Subject D-186, male Caucasian, 42 years old, 108kg, 185cm tall. (setting: 1:1) <br><br> Output: Male Hispanic, 42 years old, 100kg, 188cm tall. Subject was very confused and agitated. Subject attacked security personnel. Subject terminated. <br><br>Hahaha that poor fucker. No one should have to die a mexican. I thought this SCP improved things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 1:1 <br> improve things </br></br>  That book that absorbs blood and keeps re-writing the past is so fucking creepy.  Is there an SCP ona hole?  <br>There's a dildo that causes you to melt from pleasure</br>  <br>Literally melt?<br>Why are the object SCPs so dangerous and confusing?</br></br>  <br>Not all of them are dangerous, but their confusing nature is what makes them require SCP. They are objects that cannot be explained though conventional means.</br>  <br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-297<br> When turned to the highest intensity setting (labeled "suicide"), SCP-297's vibration frequency swiftly increases to upwards of 200,000 kHz. If the upper portion of the device is touched to any solid material, SCP-297 will change frequency to one that causes a positive harmonic feedback loop in the object, causing the object to lose cohesion within sixty seconds of continual contact. This invariably kills organisms that it is exposed to. </br></br>  <br>Because all the other objects go to warehouse 13.</br>  <br> 108kg, 185cm tall to 100kg, 188cm tall <br> not an improvement <br>when will you learn</br></br></br>  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1478<br><br>These cactus are fucking assholes holy shit.</br></br>  There's a yotsuba doujin that have a SCP twist in it. Check it on sadpanda.  <br> Why are the object SCPs so dangerous and confusing? <br>Because "SCP" means "Secure. Contain. Protect."<br>The story is about securing and containing things, and to a limited extent protecting things.<br>If it's not dangerous or confusing, why the hell would it be there? Things that are both safe and nominal are not SCPs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because "SCP" means "Secure. Contain. Protect." <br>SCP actually stands for "Special Containment Procedures," which is what the Foundation creates to contain the anomalous objects.</br></br>  <br>That's a bit of chicken and egg, isn't it? It's both.</br>  <br> If it's not dangerous or confusing, why the hell would it be there? <br>So the Foundation can protect it from abuse by other people. Can you imagine the pizza box exposed to the world? That would crash the existing pizza economies, if not the entire food industry. It creates matter from nothing.</br></br>  I didn't know stuff like this existed  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-348<br><br><br> Subject: 6-year-old male, recently injured self while playing with friends (minor scrapes and scratches) <br> Brief Background: Parents divorced, currently lives with mother <br> Notes: Message appeared, I’m sorry, son. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn.</br>  <br>Iris was lucky to be transferred out by the time 076 went bananas again.</br>  <br> didn't know she was 2D <br> they went to ridiculous extremes to keep her from finding out <br> found out by accident <br> now showing symptoms of clinical depression <br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminds me of that comic strip where an artist draws a generic loli and draws himself asking her what she wants, and she replies "I want to be real," with a smile on her face. And then he kills himself with a shot through the head.</br></br>  <br>That's a confusing item. You've violated the proposition.</br>  <br><br>Idea is basically if it survives it, it becomes immune to it which is why they don't use the last resort options right off the bat, like nuking it or sending it off into a black hole or some shit. Every time it escapes, they have to device a new powerful method to incapacitate it. <br><br>Also, bad writing and it becoming a meme that even the admins got fucking tired of. 682 was fun at first, but now it's overblown.</br></br></br></br>  /a/, would you work at the SCP Foundation if given the chance?  <br>No because I like being alive and not insane.</br>  <br>Depends on the facility. I don't want to be be anywhere NEAR anything Keter or Euclid.</br>  <br>Would it be possible to clone 682 and have the two of them kill each other?</br>  SCP-085 is my waifu. <br>Best part is, she's 2D, which automatically makes her perfect, and if I dropped her into a manga, it's even better.</br>  <br>There are a fair many Euclid objects that are fairly innocuous, and a few Keter objects that are extremely predictable, and only pose a threat outside containment.</br>  <br>As some nameless mook?<br>Fuck that.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>One of the two 682s overpowers the other and eats it, becoming more powerful than ever.</br></br>  <br>No thank you. I'm in desperate need of a job. But not THAT desperate.</br>  <br>I used Cabin in the Woods as a reference to describe SCP to people. <br>It just sucks that a lot of people haven't see this movie. It's an interesting blend of comedy and horror.</br></br>  <br>No. There's always a chance that you'll encounter a SCP that has unknown effects that will fuck you up.</br>  <br>682 kinda reminds me of Primate Murder from the Nasuverse, except I guess 682's preferences are more varied.</br>  <br>That movie was one of the highlights of the year for me.</br>  <br> warehouse 13 <br>Fun show, but could do with better cast and better writers.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if I was a fucking superhero on a good salary. Those poor grunts at SCP are literally stormtroopers in SWAT gear.</br>  <br><br>Is the movie scary at all? I wanna watch it but I am horrible with jumpscares and tense moments.</br></br>  <br>Definitely, but I'm a fan of shows that have ordinary objects do strange and creative things so it was watchable.<br>Lost Room is one case of doing it very well. Shame it died so early.</br></br>  <br>The movie starts off in a way where you know its going to be a parody (somewhat). Its has more of a monster movie feel than an actual "scary" feeling. It just takes a 180 halfway through and goes full pic related. It's pretty great if you ask me.</br>  <br>Just watch it. It's better to go into it as unspoiled as possible.</br>  And of FUCKING COURSE THAT I'D SPEND 3 HOURS LOOKING AT SCP LINKS, AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THIS THREAD<br>FUCK YOU /a/</br>  <br>So true. Both the game and the users it draws in are shit.<br><br>Series 3 are mostly pretty good. Not on the hub yet, but there's a new canon which introduces Sarkicism, basically a sorcery cult and the Flesh (has ties with SCP-610, so you know how that goes) that the Church of the Broken God actively opposes. Really wellwritten and captivating, especially if you are into occult shit like me. Other canons in the hub seems to have gotten a lot bigger, but I've only started reading the wiki again recently, and not checked all of them out yet. Anyway, links: http://www.scp-wiki.net/metaphysici<wbr>an http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/meta<wbr>physician (the lowest part with "SITRA ACHRA" as the first tab)</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> You will never be a badass agent like Lombardi. <br> You will never be a badass driver like Dr. Gerald. </br></br>  the scp that's basically just a tape of a basketball game is one of my favourites. the concept seems so fucking stupid at first than quickly becomes fucking terrifying.<br><br>imagine being one of those poor digital copies with no way to escape your current situation. <br><br>anyway speaking of scp, I remember when i read it a while back some fucking cocksucker was busy editing some of the articles so that his faggy ass professor/doctor donut steel character showed up in it. is he still doing that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who was that guy? The name of that character, I mean.</br>  <br>166</br>  <br>I would immediately kill myself if I found out I lived in a world like that.</br>  <br>Don't worry, there's probably something that will make you kill yourself for you.</br>  <br>What if you are the SCP item and 4chan is the mean of quarantining you?</br>  <br>Once I reach page 10 I be free</br>  <br>1733, right? I'm a sucker for loopy-type skips, but SCP-1733 and SCP-176 dwarf all the others. 1733 for its fantastic concept, 176 for the awesome tales asscociated with it.</br>  <br> every humanoid SCP and animal SCP <br>Quite the sweeping generalization you've got there.<br><br> Of course it will never happen <br>It will never happen because there are enough votes from various fags to keep shitty articles from being deleted, authors notwithstanding. I suggest picking good scps from this site<br>http://scp-nala.wikidot.com/statist<wbr>ics:split-ratings</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then you saw another thread that interest you and the cycle continues.</br>  <br><br>... You do know that's D territory right?<br><br>You just said "You'll never act out an atrocious crime against decency, nature, empathy, another sentient being and yourself, then be promptly liquidated for the next batch of expendables."</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In a heartbeat.<br><br>I've got a bit of a martyr complex; I'm the exact kind of guy they wish they could have there.<br><br>I'd probably meet a bad end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine that gives you any kind of drink you want. <br>Share and enjoy!</br></br>  <br>A cup of Joe, anyone?</br>  <br><br>The vending machines a favorite. Treats ranged from delightful and quirky to deadly and terrifyingly sickening.</br></br>  <br>SCP 040</br>  <br> Also, SCP anime would be great. <br>I agree.<br><br>Warehouse 13 sort of has a similar premise. Agents work to locate and secure artifacts that do weird things and are too dangerous to leave out and about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, knowing it'll end terribly like the movie doesn't sit well.</br>  <br>which movie?</br>  <br>The SCP movie, duh.</br>  <br>The Cabin in the Woods</br>  862 is actually pretty nice.  <br>862 is a safe class, of course it's nice.</br>  <br><br>I dropped it when the foundation killed the man-of-war. He was a fucking bro and they killed him because they're assholes like that.</br></br>  <br>The only reason I would be nervous about an SCP anime is because the cynic in me knows that they'd focus primarily on the humanoid SCPs and have them as the main characters.<br><br>If you're gonna make an SCP anime, it should be almost like a slice of life anime, with a different plot each episode, from the viewpoint of the D-class, taskforce soldiers, researchers, and RARELY an SCP. Also, the only recurring characters should be the shadowy 05 that you see maybe once every other episode.<br><br> And then have a major plot arc where everything goes to shit and they have to detonate the on-site nuke. </br></br></br></br></br>  I hate that everyone and their mother is expendable trash.<br><br>The foundation has their heads stuck so far up their ass that they are directly causing global warming because of their misplaced sense of duty.<br><br>They're removing everything that's fun and interesting about the world and are even hoarding beneficial items by outright robbing the original owners.<br><br>Fuck them and their glorified mafia organization.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this :_;</br>  <br>who is this man-of-war?</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/yUpbOliTHJY?t=7s  [ ]</br>  <br>Ah, but that's part of the fun. The SCP foundation is only concerned with preserving the well-being of the human race, at any cost.<br><br>Which is worse: Global warming, or a pot that spawns a never-ending army of monsters?<br><br>I like the SCP foundation because it's the extreme version of "To be good, sometimes you must be evil."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's one of the scp's. It's a guy that has his fighting skills increase exponentially the better the weapon he is using.<br><br>A pocket knife is enough for him to fight an android on equal terms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least they are not GOC. Fuckers destroy anything they deem anomalous.</br>  <br><br>Meh, I was never fond of fucked up systems and societies. I'm pretty sure that way of thinking is going to bite them in the ass in the long run.</br></br>  <br>Ohhhh, that mary sue? Didn't they make him kill himself by  giving him an SCP sword that makes you a horrible fighter and he accidentally cut his own head off with it ?<br><br>I'm glad he's gone.</br></br></br>  <br>682</br>  <br> GOC <br><br>What's that?</br></br></br>  <br>Welp. No wonder he got wiped, the wiki doesn't take kindly to superhero-like character, and that's not saying much.</br>  <br>What's the alternative? Let those eldrith abomination bite humanity in the short run?</br>  MOOOOMMMMM the chuunis got out of their containment board!  <br>Global Occult Coalition<br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-hub-pag<wbr>e (read the "About" tab)</wbr></br></br>  <br>The Global Occult Coalition<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-i<wbr>nterest#toc8<br><br>Imagine the SCP foundation, but instead of containing things, they try to kill them.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>They've been living with/harassing humanity for thousands of years. The foundation is probably stifling human evolution by trying to contain them.<br><br>I say let the world have fun and interesting things once more.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's just a "lesser of two devils" thing. The Foundation is cold, not cruel.</br></br></br>  Joukamachi no Dandelion: Aoi shows her Geass. Chapter 9 translated.  That power is way too broken.  <br>Great power comes with great burden and responsibility i guess. I thought they have time when they can't control their power? What will happen to Aoi in this case?</br>  <br> geass like ability with permanent effect <br><br>fuck it's even scarier than geass</br></br></br>  YAMERO  The most badass of them all is her!!!  <br> Great power comes with great burden <br>Aoi doesn't want to be the King because of this. She isn't really sure anymore whether people are good to her because they wanted to, or because she geassed them to.</br></br>  <br> with permanent effect <br>I doubt it. What I can see is it can be used on the same person multiple times. But still scary.</br></br>  <br> And don't commit crimes from here on either. <br><br>You mean this will expire?</br></br></br>  <br>This is how I think of it.</br>  <br>So, they will also remember later on?</br>  <br>If the order is absolute, then their memory have been wiped. "Remember later on" is not an option.<br><br>But then, can Lelouch wipe people's memory by Geass?</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure if wipe entire memories, but Geass can replace memories, remember early episodes in 2nd season.</br>  <br>This may as well count...</br>  <br>Well, I know it's already on Batoto, but guess it doesn't hurt to upload the remaining pages.</br>        <br>Note she checks there're no mics around.</br>  <br>The next page is the OP image.<br/></br>    <br>Last page. End of chapter.</br>  What if Aoi was bullied?  Why doesn't she just Geass Akane into not being embarrassed anymore?  <br> Only Aoi, her parents, and her personal doctor are supposed to know this power. </br>  Is she that one with the powers of remembering shit? How the fuck does that work  <br><br>She geassed herself into being unable to forget anything.</br></br>  <br>  How the fuck does that work <br>Just photographic memory. However: in Chapter 16,<br> Kanade suspected that she was just smart and not due to any superpower. </br></br></br>  <br>Aoi wasn't bullied at that page though.</br>  The anime left out this page that explains why eventually Akane didn't put her shorts on. tl;dr: Akane thinks being on class on time is MORE important.  <br>Well good thing they left it. I can't fucking stand anymore of this shit show that doesn't even let me get a view.<br><br>I mean, a fucking faceless background minor character got to see Akane's panties. FUCK THIS SHIT SHOW.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you need to post this every thread?</br>  <br>Because I lust over her so much, I can't even get a glimpse of her panties. Fuck she's so pure yet the show whoring her out so much, how can I not be mad and stop posting this?</br>  <br>But she's still not a whore.</br>  Where's scarlet blossom?  <br>Chapter 19... It would be adapted, sooner or later.</br>  <br>Lelouch  and his strupid jokes  a shit.</br>  <br>This is amazing on so many levels</br>  Does anyone know whether spring ephemeral are planning to redo the chapters they released with physical scans now that they have the digital raws?  <br>Yes, Akane's priorities can get really weird if her sense of justice get into the way.</br>  Akanyan, and yet still no better fan art of her lifting her shirt  <br>Best power, best nee-chan. Can't wait for her to get more screentime.</br>  Broken ass powers. She could literally bring world peace.  <br>Aoi gets a lot of appearances in the 2nd volume of the manga.  But Shuu gets almost none. </br>  !    <br>So why did they change the artstyle so drastically in Herz?</br>  Her name is Koko!  <br>She is loco!</br>  <br> this is allowed <br> no loli will ever get sexed by older guy in anime <br> ever <br>The double standards, my god.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>   MADAO thread   Amazing the ED joke    <br>I like those gradual changes they do in the OPs some times.</br>  20 minutes until subs  <br>How many days for good subs that use the real raws?</br>  New chapters were released, I don't understand why anyone would waste their time with the anime.  <br>Call the police and report them for breaking and entering.</br>  <br><br>Whip it out of course :^)</br></br>  <br>I have a basement?</br>  <br> 3P with Rii and Hika </br>  Rii's gonna die because of Ruu, won't she?  I always thought Rickert was a girl.  <br>I hate him so much<br>But thats the mark of an excellently written villan</br></br>  <br>It's all that moe shit seeping in. <br>Everybody has googly eyes now.</br></br>  <br>Miuras art was the best around the end of conviction arc imo pic related<br>I dont like the way he draws characters now, especially guts. He looks like hes 50, but is in his mid 20's</br></br>  Who's ready to go full shounen with a timeskip at Elfheim?  <br>You speak as if shonen was a genre.</br></blockquote>]
