Any resources I could look into? Written in Japanese, preferably.  <br> Written in Japanese, preferably. <br>For what purpose? Do you think having it written in Japanese is going to make it any better? Try Visualizing Japanese Grammar. You aren't going to get much out of a guide written for natives if you are still stuck on the differences between は、が、には. <br><br>DoBJG covers は and が more than enough, if VJG isn't helping.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't see how you could read that nip definition and think that the EDICT definition is going to be accurate even 20% of the time. <br>That's because you don't understand the English definition properly and think you understand the Japanese one more. <br><br>Anon was right in that they are basically the same thing. Maybe you should look up the words used in the English description of the definition, as it means something you don't seem to understand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand both because I'm not a stupid ESL like you.<br><br>The Japanese definition may be a subset of the English one, but the English one is broad to the point of being outright wrong. You might as well say 猫 means "animal"</br></br></br>  I'm watching through Space Dandy for the first time, and holy shit, this anime is fucking amazing.<br><br>Space Dandy thread, I guess</br></br>  <br>Simple, easily understood story that was well-animated and featured a prominent female character who eventually became the lost love interest. It's just something easy to watch and understand.<br><br>Dandy required viewers to digest the quantum nature of pionium without any development until the last 4 episodes, sit through a bunch of completely inconsistent stories that ranged from terrible to amazing, and didn't have any real waifus for otaku to fap to.</br></br></br>   everybody circlejerks when an anime consists of lolis tsunderes generic mc moe etc and they dont care about flaws despite the very flaw of it is the anime itself <br> everybody "objectively" shits on an anime that has actual intriguing things  <br>Why must this happen?</br></br>  <br>It's nice you enjoyed space dandy but it had been 'full of intriguing things' then more people would've liked it. People thought it fell flat because it mostly did.</br>  <br> terrible to amazing <br>None were terrible. I'd say good to amazing. The worst episode of Dandy is still better than 99% of the garbage we get each season.</br></br>  <br> laughtrack <br> MASA NI SPACEY SOUL <br>Aren't they the same one? With the dancing supernova?</br></br></br>  I can't take it.<br><br>You can't have a hyper flawless skillset with 10 out of 10 looks and massive popularity and STILL play off a NEET lifestyle.<br><br>Shit doesn't happen. Fundamentally it is impossible. You can't have it both ways<br><br>I hate this hamster.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>psychiatrist please go.</br>  <br>I am fucking offended by this "fake NEET" trend and I want it to stop immediately</br>  <br>Not everyone has what it takes to be TruNEET</br>  <br>Jesus christ, go outside.</br>  <br>I enjoy "normal" Umaru more than video game snack all day Umaru I gotta say.</br>  Doffy is fucking dead Edition<br>The strings inside his body dissolved with the birdcage and law knows that, that's why he who is exhausted let's the marine's take doffy with him, because doffy won't even live long enough to reach impel down. But we all know that either Crocodile, Moria or Kaidou will attack the marine ship and see doffy dying. <br>Also Sanji a best  Secret Dellinger a whore thread </br></br>  <br><br>He's going to live so Kaidou can fuck him up.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't seem like Kaidou is a guy who let's a failure live. Isn't that why doffy's afraid of him?</br>  <br><br>Pretty much.</br></br>  <br> A master story teller like him has to know its time for a villain to actually die. <br>Icameheretolaughatyou.jpg</br></br>  <br>See I disagree and am fine with villains not dying because I still feel that sense of danger, it doesn't deprive me of my joy from the story and it also means character arcs can continue and develop.</br>  NEXT G COMING SOON     tfw no more genki protagonists   <br> But I think that is part of Tomino's charm, he is not making anime just to please you, he is making them because he has something to tell. <br>This goes before <br> # <br> Is Jeremiah supposed to be Garma? </br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Jeremiah supposed to be Garma? <br>That would be Clovis. Hell his funeral is a homage to Gihren's speech is 0079 and like Garma Clovis was more of a fool who wanted to be of use to his family but got killed by the person who least expected. CG was filled with references to 0079 what with Suzaku being called the White Devil and all.</br></br>  <br> HP Lovecraft-inspired Gundam <br>I want this so bad.</br></br>  Give me one reason to come out of my comfy S1-ending bubble and get myself invested in S;G 0.  <br>No, but it's a decent watch anyway.</br>  <br>No. The only good thing about it was watching it with /a/ anyway.</br>  <br>I wish someone did these but so that they actually look like Kurisu.</br>  <br>Damn, Leskinen somehow looks like a vampire.</br>  <br><br>Not particularly, though it's still fun to see the scenes from the VN as animation. Personally, I wouldn't turn down more S;G, but the VN covers the essential bits.</br></br>  ITT: h-manga/doujin or ecchi with good plot<br>  ch. 6 when  </br>  That one vanilla doujin Quzilax did<br>It was called love is blind or something</br>  <br>can't wait for good ol necro action</br>  <br> not posting his best work </br>    Well this one is pretty interesting and fucked up imagine if shinji was a furry animal this is probably how it would turn out.  THOUARS  <br><br>Is that you, Phoenix?</br></br>  No love for twirl?  <br>If I cut off the twintails, would she die?</br>  <br><br>I love Aika</br></br>  <br>aika a cute</br>  you will never accidentally stumble across a picture of a cute girl you know dressed up as a maid  <br>Bump</br>  <br> implying I know any girls </br>  <br>But I did. The picture was on the Internet though.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>God, I can't stand that fucking face. KyoAni's designs are awful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    So /a/, how do we pronounce this?  <br>Or not using the laws of physics. Due to his makeup he looked more like a clown, he was the most edgiest, boring and disgusting person both physically and otherwise in the series. No wonder people hate him and is glad seeing him dead.<br><br><br>STEALING MONEY FROM PEOPLE IS A ACCEPTABLE WAY OF LIFE HURRR!!<br><br><br>You used the same dumb adhd type of shitposting before, it does not help its one post next to eachother. <br>This adhd faggot was litterly saying that "Logic is reason and facts are bad! I dont have to lissen to those!" and you wonder why he can't accept that he is dead.<br>Go back to /tumblr/, there your emotional rationalisation will fit right in.<br><br><br><br>Nooo, he sings even in a more monotone way then his dialogue is monotone and repetitive.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127890554#p127916828">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Snail = Bat = Doll &gt; Kaiki &gt; Bird &gt; Bee &gt; Monkey &gt; Snake &gt; Crab &gt; Cat  <br>Weird, I didn't get that error and it seems to be a pretty commonly used alternative to pomf.
