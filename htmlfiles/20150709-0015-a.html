[ Shingeki no Kyojin chapter 71 thread.<br><br>Is Keith the most pathetic character of the SnK universe?<br><br>Also Lost girls gets Manga adaptation.<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-08/attack-on-titan-lost-g<wbr>irls-novel-gets-manga-adaptation/.9<wbr>0188</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>   The magazine also notes that there will be an "important announcement" regarding Saki Nakagawa's Attack on Titan: Junior High comedy spinoff manga in the magazine's next issue.  <br><br>ANIME<br>A<br>N<br>I<br>M<br>E<br><br>It will be shit but we will watch it anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was with manlet this chapter?  <br>Chuugakkou gets an anime? I saw something about it but I thought it was speculation. FUCK YES.</br>  <br>It's still speculation.</br>  <br>That would be nice. There are some chapters I would like to see animated.</br>  <br>Carla is truly best girl. The way she spoke about Eren to Keith made me choke up a little.</br>  Link to chapter?  <br>Read the thread</br>  <br>He was selfish and self centered, he deserved to be NTR'd.</br>  Allah uh Akbar  <br> we </br>  Connie is on his village, but where is Historia?  <br>Well, this chapter felt like a waste of time. Are we going to wait around 20 chapters before anything interesting happens again?<br><br>On a semi-related note, the manga is set to end in 2018, right?</br></br></br>  What's with Isayama and his cock plot lately?  Keith a shit.  <br>Not him but you know we will. All shingekis are in it and it's retarded enough to bring some keks. Get hype.</br>  <br>Have fun with the low budget piggybacking, I guess.</br>  <br>Where's the old thread?</br>  <br><br>You could at least link to the old thread can't find it in the archive</br></br>  <br>There isn't any link and it's not up anywhere but ishuhui</br>  <br>She's busy being a Queen.</br>  <br>The "shingeki" was in the name field, not the subject field.</br>  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>225<br><br>Here you go folks</br></br></wbr>  <br>The chapter was a waste, but all we can do is hope the next one is better.</br>  Jesus fuck, how the hell did Isayama think that spending 45 pages on answering ONE QUESTION (and then not really answering it very well whilst simultaneously creating even more stupid questions) would make for a good, or even passable chapter?<br><br>This chapter was fucking watching paint dry/10. I can't fucking believe I waited 30 goddamned days for this and now I have to wait 30 goddamned more in the hopes that SOMETHING, ANYTHING fucking happens next time.<br><br> Eren: What do you know? <br> Shadis: Honestly, I don't know much at all. <br> This entire fucking chapter in two and a half seconds </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I stopped reading after the discussion to rebel against the kingdom and make Historia Queen.<br><br>Did Plot advance or something?</br></br>  <br> hey I found your father outside the wall and he married my waifu <br>Even less than two seconds with all "answers" involved.</br></br>  <br> lately <br>It's been there since the beginning.</br></br>  <br>we saw monkey trouble in human form, so that's a thing</br>  <br>Imagine how the anime will play this out, it's going to be a fucking bore. That is, if we're ever going to see it animated. How big is the chance that the entire manga will be animated, anyway?</br>  <br>What did Keith do?</br>  <br>  You are now reading a spoiler. Hello.  </br>  <br>10/10. If not, fujos will riot.</br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie a reason to live<br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek why did you photoshop her nose</br>  <br>MT and BR were back for two whole pages, but now we're back to the usual.</br>  <br>Why would I ever do something like that? That's the original picture. The artist chose to have her nose emphasized by its shadow instead of a curved line. I think it looks quite nice.</br>  <br>I just want more MT.I don't care about boring BR.</br>  <br>Same, but over all I'm glad that Ymir wasn't with them, I hate her the most out of BRY.</br>  I dont get why authors do this. The problem isnt that its a flashback. Nor that its the flashback of a side character. Its that nothing of actual value was revealed. You can make a chapter like this worthwhile by simply laying a few breadcrumbs. Or at least some implications about future events. But I guess Isayama is planning that far ahead. At least give people something<br><br> when I found Grisha he mumbled something about a mission, but he didnt know what it was <br>There you fucking go. Chapter now has an actual purpose and drives the plot forward. Also leaves people with something to talk about. Is it that hard?</br></br></br>  <br>I guess Keith could've just told how Grisha found Eren, brought Eren to the forest, and then disappear. The stuff about Grisha was from outside the walls stuff and him marrying Carla could've been answered with whatever was in the basement or a flashback.<br><br>But I guess Isayama needed to remind everyone about how life sucks and doesn't always go as planned no matter how hard you try with Keith because that's one of the themes of the entire series.</br></br></br>  <br> Also Lost girls gets Manga adaptation. <br>If they picked an Ereri doujinka to do ACWNR I hope they choose Pandaniku to do this one.</br></br>  <br> Its that nothing of actual value was revealed <br>Yeah it's not like we learned that Grisha was from outside and probably related to MT. The whole chapter was to make the story more coherent and give more information about events and characters. Not advancing the plot doesn't make it a bad chapter.</br></br>  <br>Does it look like his art?</br>  <br>she supposed to have a big jew nose</br>  <br>He confirmed EM and YH as the canon ships.</br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>What was the Lost Girls VN about anyway?</br>  <br>I s this real life</br>  <br>You sound like a bumrustled EHfag.</br>  Any info about the new high school spin off chapter?  <br>Yea they suk</br>  <br>They aren't that bad anymore, after reading some translated chapters.</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up they suk</br>  <br>It's decent though. I didn't like it much because anons were claiming it was out of character, but everyone is pretty damn in character in the translated chapters I read. I couldn't tell before because it was in nip.</br>  <br> The magazine also notes that there will be an "important announcement" regarding Saki Nakagawa's Attack on Titan: Junior High comedy spinoff <br>Their voices in the spinoff would sound awkward as fuck, especially Annie's.</br></br>  <br>So is LM confirmed or BTFO?</br>  <br>Depends on the art stle. Is it gonna be in the same shitty style as chuugakkou? Is it gonna be like the chibi versions? Or is it going to be like the actual anime? <br>Chuu wasn't even funny so the only reason I'd bother to watch it is if it looks aesthetically pleasing.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>I liked some chapters so I don't care about the style. If it's going to be an anime, then I guess it will keep the same style. If they made it as anime BR specials they could do it in the usual chibi style.</br>  <br> Annie playing the tsundere with a deep voice </br>  <br>Why? It didn't really bother me in the anime specials.</br>  <br>Because she was in character in the specials.<br>In the spinoff the only thing they have in common is the name.</br></br>  <br>Annie isn't tsundere in the spinoff, she just has a crush on Eren and is indifferent about everything else, slowly warming up to Bert but nothing romantic so far. I don't know why people keep calling her a tsundere.</br>  <br>Not really, she's pretty much herself. Unless you're in denial about her crush on Eren.</br>  Season 2 never.  <br><br> Annie isn't tsundere in the spinoff <br> she's pretty much herself <br>Okay. I honestly see no resemblance, neither in appearance or character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't even have her beautiful nose.</br>  I'm looking forward to the chuugakkou anime if that's what the announcement really is. I hope they do something with Spoof too. Maybe they could make them the new specials for season 2 or something  <br>Nice cherrypicking, I can do that too to prove the opposite.</br>  <br>That's not what tsundere means but I agree that she's looks pretty out of character there.</br>  <br>This looks more like the author making fun of the fanbase. The gorilla joke was also started by fans.</br>  So, can we agree that The Norns = MRS?<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norns<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I don't mind Chuugakkou Annie either, I can see her acting like that in a universe where she hadn't been raised to be an assassin who treats the world as her enemy. Characters' personalities are often shaped by their environment, past or experiences. This is especially true for Annie.<br><br>I am angry about her nose not being represented properly, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Why were the walls named after Mario, Rose, and Sina if only one ancient titan built them?</br>  I like the titans this chapter.  <br>Yeah the designs are more generic but I don't really care about the looks in a comedic spinoff. It isn't as out of character as some anons claim though.</br>  <br>This is not a good example of tsundere behavior.</br>  <br>Every thread until you like it?</br>  <br>It sold shitloads, it will be animated, and with a bigger budget for that matter.</br>      <br>Under normal circumstances I'd share your sentiments, but Annie's nose is a sacred thing.</br>  <br>Post yummy curry instead to celebrate YH/EM's confirmation in ch71.</br>  The rarest.  <br>Read this chapter. And the volleyball one</br>  <br> dat Annie </br>  The spinoff doesn't do a good job at keeping them in character. I think the author tried too hard to exaggerate one of their character traits to the point that some of them are not themselves anymore.  I was looking some pages up and this showed.<br>Is it just me or he resembles  Kichiro Moto  a bit?</br>    <br>What the fuck is wrong with his eyebrows?</br>  <br>You're thinking too much into it, for a parody it's just fine.</br>  <br>Not at all. He's supposed to be this guy I think.</br>  <br>Not really, at least the hair doesn't look similar.</br>  I don't like the way the spinoff forces shipping into it. Most of the ships are absolute crack  <br>The best kind of curry.</br>  <br>That curry actually looks pretty gross.</br>  <br>I like to imagine that the spinoff is making fun of the fandom for doing the same thing and you shouldn't take it so seriously.</br>  <br> Mikasa&gt;Eren <br> Annie&gt;Eren <br> Bert&gt;Annie <br> Ymir&gt;Historia <br> crack <br>You what.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which ones? YH, EM, BA, and RH are all taken from canon, you can make the argument that EA is as well. Those are the ones it usually uses more than others and none of those are crack.</br>  <br> Annie&gt;Eren <br> not complete delusion <br>I can mention a couple more like how ErwL gets teased, Frieda having a thing for her sister and Hitch being a slut for Annie.</br></br></br>  <br>There is some teasing for joke ships, but the ships that get the main pandering make sense.</br>  <br>It's debatable, but not crack.</br>  <br>Annie&gt;Eren isn't delusion, Eren just doesn't like her. ErwL doesn't get teased, contrary to popular belief, and Frieda finds Historia too cute, she doesn't have a thing for her. Stop pretending to be retarded. I agree about Hitch but Hitch being a slut is a thing almost everywhere, in Spoof and the VNs included.</br>  <br> Annie&gt;Eren isn't delusion, Eren just doesn't like her. <br>They used to be good friends, that's all.<br>Whether Annie liked him or not is another story.</br></br></br>  <br>It's about time the spinoff started including Historia &gt; Eren and some rivalry between Mikasa and Historia.</br>  <br> Whether Annie liked him or not is another story. <br>It's not another story, it's the point. It's not going to happen in the manga or the spinoff since Eren is on one hand oblivious and on the other hand he doesn't like her in a romantic way. But Annie liking him is hard to deny.</br></br>  <br>In the Valentine and Frieda chapters it's heavily implied that YH are a couple.</br>  <br> Annie&gt;Eren isn't delusion <br>Except that it is. She never gave any signs that she liked him in that way. I saw nothing but admiration and respect going from Annie to Eren and vice versa.</br></br>  <br>Eren is too retarded to like anyone so that spinoff author takes advantage of it.</br>  <br>Isayama is giving the author a lot of ideas and is supervising the manga. He seems to be fine with Annie&gt;Eren</br>  <br> I saw nothing but admiration and respect going from Annie to Eren and vice versa. <br>Yeah okay, but you should read the manga for a change<br> learn how to talk to girls </br></br></br>  <br>She was telling him to pay stop being oblivious about Mikasa.</br>  <br>She probably has his porn book and is threatening him she'll post them if he complains about anything.<br>On a serious note, I doubt Isayama cares.</br></br>    <br>Yeah. Sure. Whatever you say.</br>  <br>Disgusting. How can people eat this shit?</br>  <br>Who knows. The manga is still mostly pandering to the main ships besides some teasing for joke ships. Hitch/Annie felt more like a joke for example, since it only happened in one chapter. In the Valentine chapter Hitch actually gave Marlo chocolate, which makes sense.</br>  <br>Fuck off and die EHfag. Historia hates and resents Eren and is no competition for MIkasa.</br>  <br>Like the sauce looks like shit, literally. The piece of cheese stuck in the second bowl is pretty out of place. The meat is black like rotten hrse meat. And there's menstrual blood in the other half of each bowl.<br><br>The rice is nice though.</br></br></br>  <br> blushes when he compliments her <br> she hates and resents him <br><br> is no competition <br> "you're an amazing person Historia" <br> "I like you just the way you are" <br>Kek<br><br>I would start worrying about Mikasa being the next Keith</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Good one.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if there's a chapter with EH shenanigans in it. I'm hoping for a chapter with Uncle Troubles bullying Reiner next though.</br>  <br>She likes him like a brother, she doesn't hate him.</br>  Next Chuugakkou is probably going to be about Keith getting cucked since it's the most obvious choice.  <br>So she wants to fuck her brother?</br>  <br>That would be hilarious actually. The manga chapter was already funny as is.</br>  <br>God, you sure are mad, go take some pills.</br>  <br>That's retarded. Annie is neither a matchmaker nor an altruist, she had no reason whatsoever to bring them together and was shown to ignite a rivalry with Mikasa two pages after.</br>  Speculation time<br> Grisha was a spy from an outside faction  <br> his heart softened and he became empathetic for the walled people and the SL's cause <br> he ended up betraying his faction <br><br>Grisha is what BRA could have been had they given in to their growing attachment to humanity. The question is, did Grisha know about the attacks? If he knew then how come he allowed his family to live in Shiganshina? Unles he needed to be in shiganshina for x reason. It's even possible that Grisha never stopped being a spy, his loyalty was always with whichever faction he was allied to. <br> steal coordinate from the evil Reiss <br> give it to his son <br><br>What kind of predictament does this put Eren in? Grisha could have been one of the leaders of the warrior village, making Eren a possible heir. How will Eren react to finding out that he has an affiliation to the very people who destroyed his family and killed his comrades? Will he take pity on them or will he mercy kill them. I can see BR siding with Eren against MT, I can't see how Eren can take MT on one-on-one. <br><br>Or Grisha could have been from Ymir's faction, however I don't see this as likely considering Grisha and MT look like they could be blood related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Sasha a titan?  <br>He seemed surprised and vengeful at Carla dying. I don't think he knew it was coming since it didn't look like he was in a hurry.</br>  <br>We still don't know where Ymir's faction is on it, MT could even be the actual ruler of them, or someone who decended from them. I don't much similarities between him and Grisha besides maybe the glasses.</br>  What is this Lost Girls anyway? Any summaries?  <br>I don't think Grisha is from BRA's village.<br>I doubt he was on a mission, but rather fleeing from somewhere, judging by the bruises.</br></br>  I want to abuse the Young Grisha.   Mikasa &amp; Annie &amp; Historia &gt; Eren <br> Reiner &amp; Ymir &gt; Historia <br> Jean &gt; Mikasa <br> Bert &gt; Annie <br> Ouruo &gt; Petra <br> Erwin &gt; Marie <br><br>Does Isayama like to add one-sided romances because it makes his characters more flawed and pitiable? Or does he add it for the sole purpose of suffering?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Frieda &gt; Historia</br>  <br><br>And Keith &gt; Carla &gt; Grisha<br>and  Kenny &gt; Uri </br></br></br>  <br>He adds it for the  cuck </br>  <br>You know I wouldn't call Annie &gt; Eren so one sided though.</br>  <br>And Marco &amp; Armin &gt; Jean</br>  <br> Kenny &gt; Uri <br>He seemed to have more of a thing for NotAnnie to be honest. He was just close to Uri in the BR kind of way.</br></br>  <br>Isayama said Eren doesn't see her that way. Actually he said there's just mutual respect, so it kinda sinks the ship from Annie's side too.</br>  <br>Historia &gt; Hanji is missing</br>  <br>Isayama seems to really have a thing for loyalty. Keith still liked Carla after almost 20 years. Sames goes for Kenny still being loyal to Uri after he died.</br>  <br>You forgot Eren -&gt; Mikasa and Historia -&gt; Ymir. and you made a mistake with Historia-&gt; Eren.</br>  <br>It's time to let it go.</br>  <br>for you</br>  Who will be the next cuck and why is it Levi?  <br>When things comes to romance authors will never be truthful and in your place I wouldn't take his words too seriously. <br><br>For me personally the way it was depicted in manga it didn't felt one sided at all. And overall this ship is very subtle.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not fooling anyone Isayama.</br>  <br> not posting CR </br>  <br>Eren still doesn't like her.</br>  <br> it didn't felt one sided at all <br>This. He even blushes because of her </br></br>  <br>I'd rather believe Isayama's words and my opinion than yours. To me Annie x Eren is a crackship as much as Historia x Eren.</br>  <br> author denies the ship <br> h-he's lying! <br>Come on.</br></br></br>  <br> Historia x Eren. <br>I can give you EA being crack but Isayama is obviously going for EH.</br></br>  <br> obviously <br>Not really.</br></br>  wasted chapter. That flashback with Eren's mom could be summarized for 2 pages. Isayama missed a chance to involved Mikasa. Her keeping a damning secret would add depth to her boring character.  <br>We still have to wait for more chapters and development for a confirmation.</br>  <br>This. Nobody would love a Jewgirl, only uggos like Bertl. Especially when Eren has Mikasa already.<br><br><br>It is.<br><br><br>Ahahah. Even Eren x Annie is more canon than the delusional crackship that is EH.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's blushing because he is being nearly suffocated. I think it's very possible that Annie had a thing for Eren, but there's no reason to believe it was reciprocated.</br>    <br>Fucking this. Perfect explanation. Same thing happened to Historia when she "blushed" for Eren (she was just being embarrassed from Mikasa choking her using her Darth Vader powers).</br>  <br>He's obviously blushing because of her comment and her wanting to teach him how to talk to girls.</br>  <br>For how long will you be in damage control? I though you said you would drop out of butthurt.</br>  <br>All shipping aside, I hope we get a flashback scene showing her actually trying to teach him that and him just being horrible at it.</br>  <br>He can't breathe there, he eve says it, stop being so delusional.</br>  <br>In all seriousness, Historia is probably developing feelings for Eren. She acted like the typical girl that just got complimented by her crush. She also sensed the jealous aura around Mikasa and looked terrified by it.</br>  <br>He might leave when Jean finally dies. Hopefully MT will do the job, since obviously one or all of JSC are going to die.</br>  <br>You forgot Jean</br>  <br> third panel </br>  <br> being this delusional </br>  <br>What does Jean have to do with loving Yummy curry? You sound like a deluded reverse shitposter.</br>  <br>This. Frieda had the same reaction when Historia told her she was a nice person.</br>  <br>And also Eren was the first one to say he liked her by what she is besides her best friend, and he was willing to give his life for her.</br>  <br>Why is Annie there?</br>  Reminder that Historia is the worst girl.  <br>JSC will be the only ones left in the end</br>  <br> give his life for her <br>That's not exactly how it was.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>This</br>  <br>Finally some good poster for a change.<br><br><br><br>People like you should be put in a mental asylum.<br> expecting hetshit in a LGBT manga like Attack on Titan <br>Titan = cishetwhite patriarchy<br>Attack on = ^</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does Mikasa look so pissed at Armin after he smiled and waved at her</br>  <br>This. It obviously wasn't for humanities sake. He just wanted to save Historia.</br>  <br>Nah, second place after Mikasa.</br>  <br>She probably started developing feelings for him right after he told her that he liked her just the way she was. There's this panel in the political arc where she's staring at him with such intensity that you'd think she was raping him with her eyes.</br>  <br>He wanted to give his life to her so she could save humanity, that's how it was.</br>  <br><br>YHbrothermind</br></br>  <br>Its like <br> dont do dirty stuff <br> fuck off Armin </br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Mikasa is second best after Ymir.<br><br><br>Kinda true. She has no value outside of YH and she's the center of a lot of shitposting from hetfags and waifufags who think that every dumb good looking girl belongs to them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> anyone who calls out on your delusions likes the opposite thing <br>Classic.</br></br>  <br>Hahaha! I bet they did dirty stuff together after all.</br>  <br>See this</br>  <br> And also Eren was the first one to say he liked her by what she is besides her best friend <br> besides her best friend <br>Ymir never told her that she preferred Historia.</br></br></br>  <br>If you don't like YH then fuck off Islamfag.</br>  <br>No, Mikasa is just a tsundere for Armin.</br>  <br>Maybe that's her secret, she molested Eren while he slept.</br>  Armin &gt; Annie is a more believable ship.  <br> keep trying bitch, it ain't happening </br>  <br> Ymir never told her that she preferred Historia. <br>YES SHE DID<br><br><br>it's not really molesting when Eren loves it (he got hard so)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> EHfags in change of fingerpointing <br>No wonder no one can stand you.</br></br>  <br>Why people like Historia in the first place, bitch has no personality, literally, and was too much of a pussy to turn into a Titan.</br>   Discussing Historia's relationship with Eren <br> Shut up you fucking shitlord hetfag </br>  <br>No she didn't, take it from someone who likes YH.</br>  Let's settle this<br>http://strawpoll.me/4861979</br>  <br> &gt;Discussing Historia's relationship with Eren <br>Let me fix that for you mate, you made a small error there<br> shitposting <br>here you go.</br></br></br></br>  Rod Reiss did nothing wrong. He just wanted a good life for his daughter.  <br>She did it way before in the flashback.</br>  <br> inb4 "subtle" Ymirfag proxyfagging </br>  <br> tfw voted 4 times <br> tfw 7 votes </br></br>  <br>Thanks for letting us know that you are going to proxyfag again, Allahfag.</br>  <br>No she didn't.</br>  Just reminding the delusionals in this thread that Annie only smiles with Eren and also Eren was highly interested in her before the betrayal.  <br>I'm probably the only Ymirfag who isn't in complete denial about EH.</br>  <br><br>It's not proxyfagging, I just voted 3 times for Ymir to balance out this faggot </br></br>  <br> all this bitterness <br>Historia is best girl. Ymir and Mikasa are the actual worst.</br></br>  <br>You are a reverse shitposting EHfag.</br>  <br>See, this is proof that Historia-hetfags/waifufags/EHfags need to be permanently removed (killed, etc.) form /snk/ generals.<br><br>Like it's okay to maybe dislike Mikasa but disliking Ymir or even saying that she and Mikasa are the worst is just blatant shitposting.<br><br>Ymir is the deepest character in the SNK universe. She is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no personality <br>That would be Mikasa. If Historia turned into a titan she would've killed MC and then this manga would be pointless.</br></br>  <br> admit EH could happen <br> he must be a reverse shitposter </br></br>  Honestly, how delusional can all you be? It's been obvious for a long while Historia only likes  Dazz.   <br> Implying Eren didn't want to hit that female titan ass </br>  <br>Yeah you say that after I see numerous posts from Ymirfags and Mikasafags and others hating on Historia but no one seems to care then.</br>  lel people hating on ymir, she's just a emotional girl that likes to protect her friends<br>she comes off as a bitch sometimes cuz she wants to hide that fact and is pretty picky on who she choses to trust<br><br>historia doesn't deserve ymir, historia is a shit</br></br></br>  <br> but no one seems to care then <br>How can I care when you all point it out 24/7?</br></br>  <br>This is why I hate Ymirfags and don't feel pity for them when she gets shat on because of how obnoxious her fanbase is.</br>  <br>Hugo is retarded, news at 11.</br>  <br>Not sure if samefagging or if you're just retarded.</br>  <br>How can you like Ymir and hate Historia?</br>  <br> Historiafags sad that they character got hate when they're the ones shitposting about other characters the most </br>  And people thought harem waifu threads were cancer, bitches don't know about shingeki no kyojin cancer waifu wars.  <br>I was literally the only one to point it out just now. I'm pretty much the only one who defends Historia when she gets hate here.</br>  <br>That's kind of true, but if Ymir wants Historia then she should get her.<br><br>She is the best character after all (which is evident by how she's so unpopular on /a/ these days - she is the Frederick Chopin to Historia's One Direction).</br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself, Allahfag.</br>  <br> that's why I hate Ymir-fags <br> doesn't even post why  <br><br>Nice baitou anon-kun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then explain why there's always a lot of hate for Historia too. Don't pin the blame on some characterfags when I've seen numerous times that Mikasafags an Ymirfags do it too. Hell, there's several examples of that now.</br>  <br> ass <br> not face </br></br>  <br>So much for you being able to tell what posts are mine and what aren't, Ymircuck.<br><br>I am masturbating to how you cannot even tell apart real Ymirfag posts from my Yummycurrylover posts.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not the only one, I am at it too.</br>  <br>Why is there a need to explain when they make reasons for disliking them obvious as is.</br>  <br>Trips don't lie</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br>You mean Allahfag? That autistic idiot doesn't count. I see shitposting about other characters way more.</br>  <br>Well thank you then.</br>  <br>Guess that the power of autism is just going to make you believe every Ymirfag poster is a shitposter unless it's you, that's fair enough with me (and it's ironic, because of all the Ymirfag shitposters, you are the biggest one, right after our moderator).</br>  <br>I like Historia and I'm sure that the majority of Ymirfags like her too. You're forgetting that you're on /a/, too, where it's easy to samefag and pretend to be someone you're not.</br>  <br>I love it when fedora wearing actual autism diagnosed Atheists call a well socially adjusted smart humorous good looking man "autistic".<br><br>It's like literally projecting.</br></br></br>  <br>He wanted that too</br>  <br>Maybe you should read the thread over again. It's obvious that not all of it is Allahfag. Plus there's been plenty of times where I've seen people jumping on the Historia hate brigade sometimes out of no where when she isn't even mentioned prior.</br>  <br> trips <br>Confirmed for truth.</br></br>  <br> Allahfag <br>That's a Historiafag.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't even need to say why. They're plain annoying.</br>  <br> you are the biggest one <br>No, that would be you.</br></br>  <br>Learn to fucking deal with it</br>   tfw senpai noticed me   <br>We deal with it all the time. You're no special.</br>  <br>I see them hating on her more than vice versa.</br>  <br>I think the opposite.</br>  Let it be known that if you dislike Yummy Curry you are a filthy subhuman EHfag Islamfag Allahfag.<br><br>God is also a social construct just like gender and I am enlightened by my euphoria.<br><br>EM and YH are the only canon ships, everything else is shitposting.<br><br>Etc.<br><br> This is what Ymirfag actually believes and his mod buttbuddy supports hm. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I do deal with it usually. But I also see others wanting to defend their favorites too, including Ymir.</br></br>  <br>And so what if an Ymirfag hates on Historia? It's totally fine if it's the other way around right?</br>  <br>Not him, but if you're a Ymirfag then you're not dealing with it. Even this post is proof that you can't stop whining about it. Every time someone hates on Ymir, the thread turns into a whinefest until it dies.</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying.</br>  <br>I think not. I see it in /u/ and I see it here too.</br>  <br>Who is them? You mean the obvious shitposter that always comes in here because he's too bored?</br>  <br>I don't mind if they hate her but it doesn't mean you have to act like autists about it just because you guys can't ignore Allahfag.</br>  I noticed that whenever the plot slows down, the waifu wars intensify.  I want to kiss Annie on the nose.  <br>This, Historiafags are entitled cunts that think every Ymirfag should automaticlly love her, see</br>  <br>I like how Ymirfags pretend to be retarded when it comes to others getting hate but they will be sure to point out all the "hate" Ymir gets before all else.</br>  <br> you guys <br>Generalizing much.</br></br>  <br> Every time someone hates on Ymir, the thread turns into a whinefest until it dies <br>Literally every time someone hates on x, it turns into a whinefest. You just obsessed with the mentioned character and that's the only thing you notice in those shitholes.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that what people have been doing about Historiafags too?</br>  I know Ymirfags will have seizures over this, but Historia is a great character and also has great looks and possibly a thing for Eren. EH won't be canon from both sides because Eren is retarded, but Historia never showed signs of being a lesbian in the whole manga.  You're all retards.  Why do you guys see romance in every single thing that happens? Why do you all seem to be baffled by platonic respect and friendship?  <br>Because Erwin is straight  ;_; </br>  <br> also has great looks <br>Mikasa and Annie are better looking.</br></br>  <br>Get in line</br>  <br>It's been done about everyone, it's retarded but that's how it goes.</br>  <br>Most whinefests last for 20 posts, not whole threads like with Ymir. Grow a thicker skin, and over all grow up.</br>  <br> never showed signs of being lesbian <br>Are you serious?</br></br>  <br>I get it. And I know it happens to everyone and sometimes I just ignore it but other times I do want to defend my favorite. I also really like Bert and I know he gets a lot of hate too.</br>  <br> never showed signs of being a lesbian <br>Sure at hell showed more of a love interest towards Ymir than she ever showed towards Eren. And I dont even give a shit about this whole shipping non sense.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, I knew you'd have seizures over it. Mikasa and Annie are also cute.<br><br><br>Absolutely.<br> inb4 a shadow means she blushed <br> inb4 asexual bullshit </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I see haters posting for whole threads even when they don't get attention. It's not like they are the ones at fault.</br>   Reminder that the Ackerman seed will die out. <br> Reminder that both Ackerman's will never reproduce since their love will never be reciprocated. <br><br>FeelsBadMan.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd argue that she did have feelings for Ymir, but those went away and now she's developing feelings for Eren.</br>  <br>Because SnK gave me a NTR fetish.</br>  <br>Interest, sure. Love interest, not even close.</br>  <br>Is that how kisses on the nose usually go?</br>  <br>Manlet a shitty shit.</br>  <br>Funny how it's Ymirfags doing the very same right now</br>  <br> even when they don't get attention <br>Not really, you always give them more than enough attention. Hell, you give them enough attention to go for months, that's how oblivious you are to your own whining.</br></br>  <br> a shadow </br>  <br>Ymirfag here, I completely agree with you. I never thought Historia was anything but straight ever since that time she blushed to Reiner.</br>  <br>Women. Or fags</br>  <br>Direct the hate elsewhere like you always do, Ymirfag.</br>  <br> a shadow <br>How desperate are you?</br></br>  <br>Because muh romance</br>  <br>Ymirfags sure are butthurt today.</br>  <br> directing the hate to Ymirfags </br>  <br><br>Maybe try harder next time. We already got over that. Shadows are on the nose, blushes are on the cheeks. Get your eyes checked.<br><br>Not to mention that she looked creeped out when that happened. So romantic, right retards?</br></br></br></br>  Armin and Mikasa will most likely end up together.  <br>Naw. I've seen a lot of unanswered hate posts. The bait is posted until someone catches it.</br>  <br> implying Ymirfag doesn't deserve it </br>  <br>Why are manletfags so retarded and so obviously from tumblr?</br>  <br>Finally someone with some common sense ITT.</br>  <br> shadows "in the nose" when face is completely pointed to the sun </br>  <br>One anon doesn't represent all of them</br>  <br>I'd prefer that over most outcomes. Too bad it's not happening.</br>  <br> proving you're the shitposter </br>  <br>Probably</br>  <br> Not to mention that she looked creeped out when that happened <br>She was shocked. Creeped out would be if she pushed her away and made a disgusted face.</br></br>  <br>She was surprised, hence the exclamation mark.</br>  <br>Most of them deserve it.</br>  <br> So romantic, right retards? <br>You said it yourself.</br></br>  <br>Sure anon.</br>  Historia &gt;&gt;&gt; Ymir  <br>She made a disgusted face, everyone would if a friend try to lick you.</br>  <br>Light Novel.<br>It's retelling the story from the POV of Annie and Mikasa while the titular part of the story is about Mikasa and her memories, opinions and thoughts of Annie.<br><br>Goodbye Wall Sina is Annie's part, telling what she did the day before the expedition.Was also adapted into a VN.Which is where info came out like Annie and Hitch sharing a room.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch out. We have a real deal here.</br>  <br>You're not familiar with how animu drawings work, are you.</br>  <br>It also goes the other way around, how can you ignore the obvious dykery coming off of Ymir?</br>  <br>They do, actually.</br>  I like Ymir and Manlet. Am I cast out of the fandom yet?  <br>See </br>  <br>I'm familiar with the denial here if that counts.</br>  <br>I never saw that as plausible. She was surprised at everything that happened in Trost. If she had been in on anything then she'd have known that he was the titan that was helping them and that he was still alive, but she was surprised by all of it. Or if she did think he was really dead, she's know that there would be a new coordinate shifter that she would then have to find and help. Everything that happened showed that she was as in the dark about it as the rest of them.</br>   these whole thread   <br> disgusted </br>  <br>Yes because you have double shit taste.</br>  <br>Is it any good?</br>  <br>Levi is okay, Ymir is not. You can still repent.</br>  <br>Eh?</br>  <br>She wouldn't know any of these things if all she saw was Eren transforming and eating his dad.</br>  <br>Ymir is cute.</br>  <br>Underrated post.</br>  <br>She looks disgusted.  And it is disgusting, trust me. </br>  <br>Look at how happy and aroused she is, she obviously enjoys it so much. <br> Ymirfags sure are retarded. </br></br>  <br> he can't read facial expressions <br> he can't see the exclamation mark of surprise </br></br>  Historia could do better than Ymir.  <br> shadow <br>Even a blind person can see it's a blush and I don't even ship anything besides EA.</br></br>  You guys are so funny  <br> Historia can't get anything better than Ymir so she has to settle for the asexual MC <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br> EA <br>Then I assume you took Eren suffocating as a romantic blush too? And you tend to ignore the author's interviews? Good to know.</br></br>  <br> Ymirfags sure are retarded <br>What else is new?</br></br>  <br> implying she wants Shitmir or Eren </br>  <br> Then I assume you took Eren suffocating as a romantic blush too? <br>No but I do think Eren had special feelings for Annie that had the potential to develop into something more.</br></br>  <br>If the author disagrees, then sorry but you are objectively wrong. It's not up for debate anymore.</br>  <br>You do know Isayama is notorious for fucking with fans, right?</br>  <br> romantic <br>Because it isn't romantic is why it is mentioned.</br></br>  When will Ymir finally confess  ARE YOU READY!!<br>IM READY<br>Hajimeyou<br>Yareba dekiru kitto<br>Zettai watashi NANBAA WAN<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-08/berserk-manga-confirme<wbr>d-to-resume-as-monthly-series-this-<wbr>month/.90187<br><br>WE FINALLY OFF THIS BOAT RIDE</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>POST YFW OFF THE BOAT SOON</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7F1<wbr>H0T8RyWQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>    <br>Well shit, about time. <br><br>It's still going to take forever to finish at a monthly pace though.</br></br></br>  <br>PUT YOUR GRASSES ON</br>  <br>It's grasses time now</br>  Read all the chapters over the course of a few months learning about how slow the plot progressed makes my head spin  Where were you when Berserk is live?  <br>At work reading berserk on my phone<br>No jokes<br>I found out just 20 mins ago about this by accident holy dick fuck</br></br></br>  for the anon that wanted epic boat memes  Seems it will have 4 chapters, 100p at once.

Is that what it says?</br>  So it begins.  So are there official English translations released at the same time or do we have to wait for those? I just want to know where I can go to get my hands on each new chapter as soon as possible. I started the manga during this past hiatus so I've had easy access to everything since it's all been out for awhile.  Post sluts.  <br>Hey buddy I think you got the wrong floor, Eclipse room is two blocks down</br>  EIGHT<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>YEARS<br><br> and counting </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It usually takes a few days for an English translation<br>Last time it took around a week though which was unusually slow</br></br>  <br>Look up evil genius scanlations, they get it done fairly quickly usually.</br>    <br>And then it will gö back to hiatus for 5 years<br>yeayea</br></br>  <br> some people followed Berserk since the 90's </br>  <br>Been following since 2002<br>Im pretty fucking happy right now to see Miura san is back in the game</br></br>  <br>She is going to get healed and then want to return to Griffith.</br>  <br>You're gonna jinx it, Miura already had two heart attacks and it's not likely he'll survive the 3rd.</br>  <br>What the hell is this?</br>  <br>When did he ever have any heart attacks?<br><br><br>Miura drew a thing that shows all the characters like 20 years older for some reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some april fools joke from SK years back.</br>    <br>Caska is high as fuck</br>  PUT YOUR GRASSES ON<br>NOTHIN WIR BE WONG</br>  <br> Miura already had two heart attacks and it's not likely he'll survive the 3rd <br>source: your ass</br></br>  <br>Why on earth would she do that?<br>Shes retarded but she doesnt have stockholm<br>She loves Guts<br>I bet youre one of those "she loved it" Griffith fags</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish the anime would come back after so long, sorta like Jojo.</br>  <br>I can't imagine how that must feel.</br>  <br>he didnt. his health hasn't really popped up unlike other mangaka who have wrist pains or other health issues.</br>  <br>Thank god, I really hope the boat ride won't take that long to end</br>  <br>dude did you see how shaky those lines were in chapter 337? no wonder it took this long for 338, he had to learn how to draw with parkinson's</br>  Just so you know a new Idolm@ster game is in the works and will probably be out within a year  <br>ive been following since 2006 or 2007. cant remember. shit was so cash and still is.</br>  <br>So what were those drops of blood on the second page?

This has to be fake. There's some higher power that stops Miura from releasing chapters. No matter how hard a fish swims, it cannot change the course of the stream.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=70G<wbr>D2SBCq64</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>I'll believe it when I'll read it.</br>  <br>I just think that expecting anything else but suffering for Guts isn't realistic. No matter what happens I don't think it is going to be anything happy.</br>    <br>Cool. I guess I will come back in a year and marathon through it. All two of them.</br>  to think so many of us weren't even born when this series started, and there is still no ending in sight  Fucking finally.<br><br>Plus it's monthly. So that's good.<br>I think this might make up for this long ass break.<br><br><br>Nah, it's going to be about Griffith and his beautiful tottaly perfect and not a slaughterhouse kingdom.<br><br>But man, once Casca gets her memory back, they better fucking fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But man, once Casca gets her memory back, they better fucking fuck. <br>Her pussy is probably destroyed from that demon dick though.</br></br>  <br>A lot of people assume Miura is cruel and unforgiving because of all the violence and rape but forget that the only people dying in droves are nameless background characters, Past the Eclipse i can't think of a single named character who wasn't a villain dying except Flora. Even minor assholes like nina the prostitute, the priest of that troll village and Jill's dad walk away unharmed, usually even after growing a little into slightly more likeable characters. The fact that /a/ always goes on about how Casca is going to get brutally killed just before she can be cured or farnese will sacrifice everybody or fucking Isidro will get ripped apart by trolls in front of a horrified puck and Schierke just makes it seem like they're basing berserk off secondhand information.<br><br>Guts has been becoming a better and better person every volume, beast of darkness nonwithstanding. And i doubt Miura intends to just throw it all away and make the final message "life sucks bruh, nothing you can do".</br></br></br>  Looks like I chose the right time to start on the manga  <br>this tbh</br>  <br>But Guts doesn't have a demon dick...</br>  <br> /a/nons have died before we got off the boat </br>  <br><br>I'm still convinced Schierke is gonna get raped.</br></br>  <br>Question: Why is Guts always drawn with obviously pointed ears? Is he part elf or something? We know nothing about his parents after all.<br><br> inb4 his dad is the elf king </br></br></br>  <br>Earlier in the story pointy ears were a little more common, i remember Gambino had them as well, i guess Miura just grew out of that style but was in too deep to change the look of the main character.</br>  <br>Guts being a half-elf mongrel would crush my soul.</br>  <br><br>His great great great great grandmother was the Elf Queen.</br></br>  <br><br>Same here, I would feel pretty down about it.</br></br>  <br>Because Miura hadn't learned how to draw round ears yet.</br>  <br>You greatly underestimate Miura.<br>The fact that Guts has been becoming better and better emotionally is just a ruse for his fall. If you can imagine how broken he can be with repeated use of the Berserker armor, you know how horrible Miura will go.<br><br> I can still imagine Guts, layed on his back, unable to even more or do anything, inside the Berserker armor, so damaged he can't even leave, talk or see, only for Casca to ask him to fight.<br><br>If you can imagine a Guts that can no longer see, touch, feel, smell, a broken shell of a man who only fights on command and does nothing else, you can imagine how cruel Miura can go.<br>Simply murder and rape is just too boring.<br><br>For me, at least, Miura is harsh but fair.<br>Casca getting buried, killed, etc, with the gang is just too random to ever happen because everyone needs to survive until the big final showdown between Guts and Griffith with both having armies destroying each other for the sake of the world.<br><br>It's at that point, I believe, that Miura will show horrible ways for each of his characters to die.<br><br><br>Nah, nothing's ever going to happen to her.<br> Erika, however, will be eaten alive.  <br>I have foreseen it and it will happen. I have someone betting their entire Berserk collection on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's Zodd's son</br>  <br> The fact that Guts has been becoming better and better emotionally is just a ruse for his fall. <br>Indeed. There has already been some foreshadowing that his current happiness won't last.</br></br>  <br>i can't wait to see some horny demon wearing Erika like a condom<br>it's my only reason to live right now</br></br>  <br>this tbh</br>  <br> I MUST KILL ALL THE DEMONS <br> No Guts, you are the demons <br> and then Guts became an apostle </br></br></br>  <br> the big final showdown between Guts and Griffith with both having armies <br>I feel it will be more of a Guts vs The world deal.</br></br>  <br> monthly <br>I will not believe this even while I'm reading the 2nd or 3rd months release. 4th or 5th I might get some naive expectations, and it won't be until 8-10 chapters that my skepticism is gone.<br>But even one new chapter is fucking amazing.</br></br></br>  <br> Berserk Manga Confirmed to Resume as Monthly Series This Month <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHA</wbr></br></br>  My Japanese is shit, does the "A total of 100p" bit mean all at once or over a few months?  <br><br><br> Erika being eaten alive <br> or brutally raped to death <br><br>I don't want this.<br><br>But if Miura was planning on having Schierke raped but stopped, I think it's probably gonna happen eventually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  lets all guess how long this would last until miura gets the fund he needs for idolm@s merchandise.  LET US REMEMBER THE LAST TIME SOME AUTHOR RETURNED FOR MONTHLY RELEASES   caska is healed <br> guts and caska get kids <br> they are daughters and they give them idolmaster names </br></br>  <br>I still wish* Schierke would get raped.<br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br>Okay at the very least i agree with you that Guts getting better and better is being balanced out by Miura dumping greater and greater hardships on him. But i don't really see anything of those hypothetical ever happening.<br><br> I can still imagine Guts, layed on his back, unable to even more or do anything, inside the Berserker armor, so damaged he can't even leave, talk or see, only for Casca to ask him to fight. <br><br>When has anything like this ever happened in Berserk? It runs completely opposite to Guts and Casca's previous relationship, she hated it when Guts fought, especially when it was a half dead suicide run. I mean i get that after being cured she's likely going to be a completely different character, but there's no evidence of any of this happening. All i'm getting from the rest of this is you're projecting some weird fantasy, and i'm not getting into that.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm not quite sharp on Berserk lore anymore, what were the rules to Behelith sacrifices? I was wondering if Guts could hypothetically sacrifice Griffith, with him being the first or second most important thing in his life and all.  <br><br> Guts saves puts Casca to live in a safe place  <br> dedicates his life to killing all demons  <br> kills all demons in the human realm but they will come back  <br> sacrifices his life to make the world of Berserk demon free  <br><br> Reincarnates into a new better world <br> Meets Casca and his old friends as kids <br> ...and befriends Griffith <br> The End </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't sacrifice your enemy, and that's who Griffith is to Guts right now.</br>  <br>I'll take it!<br><br>Now all what's left is HxH.</br></br></br>  this cannot be true  <br>sacrifice your loved once so you lose your humanity</br>  <br>Guts is strong but there's only so much one man can do.<br>Everything seems to be pointing towards an eternal showdown between Guts and Griffith in the form of a huge war.<br><br>First, you need to consider that outside of Falconia, everything must be hell on earth with all those fantasy monsters running around.<br>Any people not going or heading to Falconia will be stricken with fear and unable to go anywhere without major escort, and even then, seeing how that Cockatrice attacked the convoy of Rickert and Erika before the Band of the Hawk saved them, it's doesn't even seem plausible to travel.<br>Since there are monsters eating everyone, wars will end but mercenaries will have work. Guts explained that mercenaries will do anything just to get food on the table. I doubt that the knights protecting kingdom will be enough to fight off monsters, so what will happen will be a shift and merging of mercenaries selling their services to protect people.<br><br>The people who will be the most annoyed from Falconia are those with financial and property such as the nobles. I heavy doubt that any noble will gladly throw away all their financial superiority just for safety. I heavily suspect people not going to Falconia will resent Griffith having the only safe spot in the world. They won't do anything like mounting an assault on Falconia but they'll be annoyed.<br><br>The nobles will eventually find out that Falconia is a slaughterhouse, that people are being sacrificed by the hundreds/thousands without anyone noticing. And since people keep immigrating there, no one notices the losses. Essentially, the God Hand have entrapped the entire human race into a box for them to sacrifice however they want.<br><br>And they'll also figure out that the big ass Tree of Life is what is generating all those fantasy monsters to appear. So, perhaps, destroying it will restore balance to the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Casca is in a retard state since 20 years <br>Will Miura finally cure her, or will she stay like this until the end?</br></br>  <br>I's still funny that he got addicted to some game. What do you even do in it? Dance? I could see if it was a JRPG or something.</br>  <br>He doesn't even play Im@s games, it's just a stupid joke taken too far because of all the hiatus.</br>  <br>It's a meme</br>  <br>Farnese's father was shown to be very wealthy. He was stated as being the primary backer behind wars and I don't think that info drop was random either. Farnese's father will use all his money to collect an army of mercenaries to attack Falconia to hopefully save the world and destroy the Tree of Life. <br><br>Don't forget what the Duck Knight said when he first saw Griffith.<br>He said that a legendary war was coming, something greater than what will be written in history books.<br><br>So, to me, you have this huge mercenary army that will be potentially be used to attack Griffith for the sake of the world and that's where Guts, Casca and the rest of the RPG gang will be involved. They're going to add Witch and the Bākiraka assassins clan (along with possible whatever is left of the Kushan Empire).<br><br>And to me, that seems like a big ass army.<br><br>Guts, alone, cannot defeat Griffith and his kingdom alone.<br>Griffith has every apostle, the entirety of the Vatican army in his kingdom and a shitload of food and supplies. There's only so much a single man can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1,5 months<br> fans are fucking buying all of the Berserk manga available in their countries out of hype <br> Miura releases the best bait m@ster of a chapter since 9/11 <br> everyone is happy <br> Fans buy even more of his manga  <br> second chapter is complete shit  <br> they buy it anyway <br> Miura stops writing the third one mid-way and it becoms an unpublished piece of art <br> fans pay fucking millions of dollars in yen to see it from someone who has it   (it's Miura in disguise) <br> ??? <br> Profit </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's going to happen. Someone's going to have to burn all their Berserk copies.<br><br>Loli witch is too cute for anything to ever happen to her and she's always next to Guts.<br><br>Erika, however, is dead. Her death flag was already announced the moment Rickert saw Falconia. <br><br>When Rickert saw Falconia, he said that he had to find a safe place to live because Erika was the only thing he cared for. (and that alone rang some alarms to me that she was fucked).<br><br>You also have to remember that Rickert doesn't understand Guts' pain because he was not present at the Eclipse, so he can't fight Guts' battles. But what if he did? What if the only thing he cared for was sacrificed in the same manner that everyone in the band of the hawk were sacrificed. <br><br>This makes me think that in Falconia, there will be endless pseudo-Eclipses with sections being given to each God Hand member to sacrifice, eat, do taboos (Slan doing endless orgies, Ubik making everyone delusions, Conrad making everyone die of starvation/plague, etc).<br><br>If Rickert saw all of this, he would know how Griffith is no longer the Griffith he knew and would try to escape Falconia. He would probably try to warn everyone that they're all going to be slaughtered without anyone listening to him.<br>He'll probably escape and tell what is going on to the nobles which, then, he'll recommend Guts as a possible person who could help in their quest to destroy Griffith and free the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Implying it won't be 100 pages of boat.  <br><br>Everything you said....sounds very reasonable. <br><br>But....isn't there any other way for Rickert to go through a similar situation but not have Erika die?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her sanity will be restored but all of her memories of Guts, Griffith, and the Band of the Hawk will be erased. There, loose end tied, tragedy retained, foreshadowing given purpose, and it frees up Guts to go take care of Griffith.</br>  POST VICTORY THEME<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hV0<wbr>qK53UCVw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>She'll get her memory back and kill herself, Guts goes mad, kills trap boy Griffith</br>  <br>yes god</br>  <br> I can't see <br>How can you not see it?<br>Did you already forget the omen by Skull Knight? How Guts will lose all he cares for the more he fights?<br><br>He just sacrificed a lot in that battle against that Sea God.<br>Just look at his current usage of the Berserk armor. He used it once in the woods and lost most of his fat along with the color of his hair.<br>This means that Guts could lose all color in his hair (what the fuck does that change??) and all his fat.<br><br>Now that he used the armor against the Sea God, he showed signs of losing his sight.<br><br>What would happen if he lost *everything*?<br><br>So yes, this has happened in Berserk and it is the logical conclusion to how shit Guts' journey will be. Considering that there are fucking fantasy monsters, Guts will have to keep using the Berserk armor more and more to make sure Casca and the rest of the gang doesn't die.<br><br>But the whole 'Casca talking to Guts to get him to fight' is more of a romantic notion that he's completely dead in every way but keeps fighting when the woman he loves asks him to fight. There's a sort of cute romanticism in there that I find sad and perfect. It'll probably simply be loli witch going to his astral telling him to fight.<br><br>As for <br> runs completely opposite to Guts and Casca's relation <br>I think that Guts will actually give up on his quest for revenge once Casca's mind returns. Griffith will achieve his lifelong goal while Guts will have achieved a small goal but important nonetheless. Both men will have found their safe heaven, with Griffith in his kingdom and Guts on that Elf Island. But something is going to force both sides into a collision. <br>What will make Guts go back to the mainland? I have no idea.<br>But that resting time will be good for Ishido to train and for Farnese to develop magic powers.  I still think she's going to tap into her childhood insanity of fire and because crazy good at shooting fire everywhere.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   responding to noname   <br><br>FUCK OFF MIURA, EITHER FINISH IT IN ONE GO INSTEAD OF COCKTEASING ME LIKE THIS</br></br>  <br> (Slan doing endless orgies, Ubik making everyone delusions, Conrad making everyone die of starvation/plague, etc). <br>This is implied to already be happening, though.<br>Falconia was Griffith's ambition manifesting in the world, Slan got a tunnel of flesh or something, Ubik got the Garden of Earthly Delights, Conrad got a swarm of rats and Void got a giant brain.<br>Falconia is Femto's slice of heaven, I don't think the others will try and do anything with it and risk their own place.<br>Then again, Femto is Ambition, so he might start some shit, but on the flipside everyone in the God Hand is supposedly omniscient so he'd have to do something pretty fucking good to spring it on everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Been following since 1997. <br>human language can't even describe</br></br>  <br> Everyone is somehow old and feeble despite being maybe in their late 40s at best </br>  <br> miura meditated for years to mentally recharge himself to give us a proper ending <br>the hero we need</br></br>  <br>This better not be trolling.</br>  <br>I don't see it.<br><br>The way I dreamed was that Rickert would hear whispers and a bit of gossip how a person who was living at XXX is no longer there and someone else took their place. But, of course, no one will really care and I doubt it will be in Rickert's mind. Just enough to foreshadow something is up.<br><br>Then one day, Erika's going to go missing and Rickert will look around for her. Only to find himself in a place he isn't suppose to and will see people being sacrificed in the most horrific ways.<br>And then, I dunno, maybe he'll find Erika's body or he might just see her being eaten. Either way, he'll understand that bringing Erika to Falconia was his fault and it will drive him mad and angry towards Griffith.<br><br>Someone suggested to me that Rickert might find out about the bad side of Falconia and he might just take Erika with him and run away but I don't think it's possible.<br>Erika's death would light a fire in Rickert to see justice done towards Griffith. I can just imagine Rickert working endlessly to build more armors for the mercenary army that are going to attack Falconia, hoping that his tireless work will help in the cause to get Griffith killed.<br><br>If Erika survives, well, I dunno, there seems to be less emotion and rage in his quest. To me, it's already over.<br>No matter how I look at it, Erika is fucked and dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spending 8 years on a boat will do that to you.</br>  <br>FUCK YOU, GRIFFIIIIIIIIIIIIIITH!!1!!</br>  <br>fuck my life i didn't even realise. Should have recognised that awkward schizophrenic writing style sooner.</br>  <br>Please answer. If we are getting a mega sized chapter like In the early days I will cum</br>  <br> It turns out to be some sidestory about Guts' or some other character's childhood. </br>  <br><br><br><br>"The previous four episodes will be republished in the coming issue to refresh people's memory." -Aazealh</br></br></br></br>  First time in a long i've felt some sort of happiness<br><br><br><br>Sorry for my stupidity but, 100 pages for 4 chapters this month?</br></br></br></br>  <br>republishing last 4 episodes</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>The part where he's trying to pass his headcanon off as fact, and makes no attempt to hide it as such, didn't tip you off?</br>  <br>Yes, when the astral and the real world merged, through Griffith's ambitions and Skull Knight cutting the Emperor's huge body, the God Hand are hinted to have gone on earth.<br>But what I'm saying is that rather than them just roaming around doing whatever, they just have to wait in Falconia.<br>Essentially, what the God Hand have done is make the entire world toxic and uninhabitable except for a single location. So they can keep sacrificing people without end.<br><br> God Hand is supposedly omniscient so he'd have to do something pretty fucking good to spring it on everyone. <br><br>I don't know about that.<br>The God Hand were surprised with Skull Knight showing himself and saving Guts and Casca.<br>However, I don't think it matters since Rickert was waiting right outside the Eclipse with some fairy elf healing magic for the both of them. Meaning that even though the God Hand did not see Skull Knight saving the day, Idea of Evil likely put that in motion and knew it would happen, and made sure Rickert would be there to heal Casca and Guts.<br><br>So now they're on Earth, I don't think that they're are omniscient.<br>It's possible that being in the astral is what made them able to predict and influence the world. How they do it will likely never be explained but I think that they won't be able to perfect anything on Earth. <br><br><br><br>New Berserk means more speculation.<br>You know you love it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You guys are far too optimistic in the caliber of those happenings. needing some rest or not, Miura has changed since years ago. I really cvan't see any main character die brutally, or Guts consumed by the demon armor even if its been foreshadowed. they will just fix things with magic, one hundred chapters of final battle, Guts kill Griffith and dies surrounded by the party in tears. something tame like that.</br>  in the end guts will go blind, that much is certain IMO  <br>Fuck yeah</br>  <br> they'll just fix it with magic <br>Hahaha.<br><br> Guts dying while surrounded by the party <br>HAHAHAAHA.<br><br>No, Miura is still the same good ol' Miura.<br><br>Berserk is going to end with Guts killing Griffith with the latter saving himself by sacrificing Falconia for his life. By doing so, Griffith, just like Void before him, will go to the Astral and the cycle will begin again.<br><br>And just like Skull Knight before him, Guts will have to wait 1000 years to be able to kill Griffith.<br>Guts will have to wait 1000 years for a new messiah to rise up and bring the God Hand down like Void did 1000 years ago.<br><br>That will be Gut's end. Waiting 1000 years to complete his revenge.<br><br>As for his party, everyone's probably going to die.<br>Falconia is going to be raided by mercenaries, rape and pilaging will be everyone, no one will be spared and everyone will die.<br><br>The reason Miura is spending so much time showing how Falconia is beautiful is so that he can destroy it. The mercenary army will be historically seen as a dark menace that destroyed the greatest place on earth and only a select few will know the truth that Falconia was the one who brought the world to ruin.<br><br>And after the Tree of Life is cut down (somehow, that shit is huge as fuck), everything will return to normal.<br>However, all kingdoms will be ruined and destroyed due to all the fantasy monsters that have destroyed everything.<br><br>So, in the end, Berserk will end as it began 1000 years ago, without any kingdoms, only clans with endless fighting, just as it was in Skull Knight's time.<br>It's causality. <br>A spiral spins counter and returns to where it began with a slight difference. <br><br>That's how Berserk is going to end.<br>With everything in ruin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  yyeeeeeeeeees  <br>Party pooper reporting in, how many expect it will go back on hiatus shortly after it comes back?

I translated a few Wani stories and got PMs telling to just give up because it's a waste of time, those people are such pussies, it's not like there aren't other places to upload porn manga.  <br>Wait, more info on this? There was a guy on /jp/ that was doing an uncensor patch but I thought that died. What's this for? I thought it was already pretty much translated.</br>  <br>Because most of them got DMCAs from Wani last April and chose to obey them.</br>  So how does /a/ feel about Fakku going full Crunchyroll and making a subscription model for Wani mags?  <br>Did someone translate this one? I recall the magazine with it was posted in a previous thread but it got a translate request but I never saw the link</br>  <br>Read the thread.<br><br>Read the archives.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking of http://exhentai.org/s/5fc4c4615b/82<wbr>9259-66<br><br>but thanks for the kind response anyway</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> .rar <br>Please don't use a meme compression</br></br>  <br> wasted <br>I want plebs to leave.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127672144 <br>Kill yourself back to reddit, retard</br>  Any good NTR?  <br> NTR <br> good </br></br>  <br>subsciption is fucking stupid, only casuals (which means all the fakku audience) will go for it.</br>  <br>Subscription is fucking stupid because they won't include the download links and we'll be stuck with 1800px rips which are barely better than japan's 1500px digital releases.</br>  <br> subsciption is fucking stupid <br><br>Have you ever used any subscription services yourself, out of curiosity? I thought the same until I tried out Netflix, and while I have issues with Netflix's quality (mainly subtitle quality), it was very easy to see the value that a catalog rental subscription model can offer.<br><br>And it's really the only way to legally replicate the kind of H-manga reading experience you get illegally with sites like sadpanda etc where you get new content constantly and read said new content without paying for things individually.<br><br><br>The online reading images are going to get a slight bump in resolution soon, but really, 1800px isn't exactly that tiny as it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think most of them just respect Wani's request. If you do scanlations, you know how much time goes into a single release, and if no one will see it, it kinda defeats the purpose (e-peen if you're a cynical leecher, or sharing your labor of love if realistic). <br><br>Some might seriously be scared of legal actions, but that's a fairly unreasonable fear. Fakku won't try to stop you, and you need to make a name for yourself before Wani-senpai notices you.</br></br></br>  <br> shilling intensifies </br>  <br>No download means I won't subscribe.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Daiz. Everyone here wishes you were dead and you know it so the only reason you would come here is to start up shit or shill for Fakku.</br>  <br>I have a 2K monitor. That shit looks tiny.<br>Bump it up to 2400px at least.</br></br>  <br> (e-peen if you're a cynical leecher, or sharing your labor of love if realistic) <br>It's e-peen (or money, or furthering your own abilities), there's nothing cynical about it. Altruism may or may not exist, but if it does, it certainly wouldn't manifest in something as unbelievably tedious as editing manga.</br></br>  <br>Why can't it be a mixture of both?</br>  New lewd moth noises<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/830582/56110a<wbr>0138/</wbr></br></br>  <br>Well, sorry to say, but there's probably never going to be a subscription service that would allow you to download everything.<br><br>I mean, even on the panda you have to pay pandabucks to download things.<br><br><br>There are actually some technical limitations to maximum image size right now due to having to support some older mobile devices. The bump I'm talking about will push it up to basically that limit - going further than that would require more extensive work for the reader to support multiple resolutions for the same pages.<br><br>Anyway, what exactly is your display's resolution and how do tend to read on it? Technically you could count basic 1920x1080 as "2K" already since 3840x2160 is considered "4K". And if you had a say, 2560x1440 display in pivot, with the reader fullscreened and set to fit to width, you'd only need 1440x2036 pages to fill the screen - 1600x2262 in case of 2560x1600 in pivot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean, even on the panda you have to pay pandabucks to download things. <br>except, you know, torrents.</br></br>  <br>Netflix offers a wide variety of genres, while Fakku currently only provides h-manga, and only that of the wani brand.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then the obvious solution is to allow the purchase of individual magazines along side of a subscription service.<br><br>Alternatively, several premium streaming services allow offline access. <br><br>Also, pandabucks is a bit of a strawman. They have torrents and you can download each individual image if you so choose. <br><br>Basically it comes down to how easily can I access the magazines offline? What sort of DRM are we talking about? Will I be able to download individual images fairly easily? DRM is horseshit and you know it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add that you can rent dvds and blurays from netflix and rip them to your hard drive.</br>  <br>Of course, the perceived quality of the catalog is in direct relation to the perceived value of a catalog rental subscription. But I was talking about the concept of catalog rental subscription in general and how there is value to it.<br><br>Anyway, the point about pandabucks was that online reading and downloading are quite different levels of access, to the point that even a pirate site makes you "pay" individually for their primary direct download method.<br><br><br>Well yes, being able to buy individual magazines (and even individual chapters) would be ideal in my opinion, and hopefully that can happen down the line. I've been pushing for that from the start and I will be pushing for it until it can be made to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw the thought of renting h magazines just entered my mind </br>  <br> Switching trough crusty pages </br>  <br>July 6th is now over. Still no patch.</br>  <br>So how much DRM are we talking here? If I can rip the magazines without a loss of quality with some scripting, I may consider it. I supported the tank releases since you can download them at full quality DRM-free. I refuse to support anything that impedes the customer from consuming digital goods in their preferred manner. You don't beat piracy by making your content harder to consume. You beat it with ease of access. Why the fuck do companies not realize this?</br>  <br>I just tried playing this and I don't get it. It's really subpar.</br>  <br>It's probably your unmatched shit taste acting up.</br>  <br>It's a catalog rental subscription. You're not supposed to download stuff to own with it. If that's not to your liking, then well, don't subscribe. <br><br>As I said, ideally we would be able to offer individual magazine purchases to have legitimate downloads available too (in my ideal digital distribution model everything should be available for individual purchase with nothing restricted to rental subscription only), but it's not something we can offer right from the start.</br></br></br>  <br> but it's not something we can offer right from the start. <br>Why not, cuntlips?</br></br>  <br>Because the ultimate decision is not ours to make for the content we have.</br>  <br>Probably in the license agreement. <br><br><br><br>I think you should have fought harder for it. I'm pretty disappointed in the decision to use DRM, not going to lie. All it does is drive potential customers away.<br><br>Actually it is your(FAKKU) decision to make since you agreed to the license/contract.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop dodging the issue. Who's decision is it to make and why can't they offer that particular service?</br>  <br>Maybe I didn't play the right game but it was some shitty VN that had Newgrounds level of touche-her-breast gameplay.</br>  <br>I'd like to know what newgrounds games you've playing that have that quality of art and animation, faggot-kun.</br>  Bumping with Watamote: <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/627789/371428<wbr>635b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/575394/00268c<wbr>8d41/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>God damn. Doujin-moe isn't even this fucking bad. At least when you sub to them you can download everything they've done in the past in full quality till your sub is up. This has to be something imposed by wani. I don't believe the guy who preaches about full res highest quality everything would do this without being forced. Of course if it is, you can't say anything. This is fucking dumb though and you know it. I would have subscribed but I was afraid this arbitrary shit would happen.</br>  Hey guys, we just finished QCing this thing. Enjoy. http://exhentai.org/g/830615/ae54da<wbr>d65d/</wbr>  <br>WANI is probably just using FAKKU as a guinea pig to see what works and don't. In the long run, they'll probably terminate the contract and do it themselves.</br>  <br>Well it's 5 pm in here, give it some time.</br>  <br> I think you should have fought harder for it. <br><br>We obviously ask for as much as possible, but this is what we got for now. And as much as it frustrates me, I can understand the cautiousness. Pretty sure a "simulpublishing" deal like this hasn't been made for H-magazines before, and as progressive a company Wani has been with their licensing otherwise, this seems to be their limit at the moment. I'd expect them to relax as we continue to show our prowess, though, which in turn should hopefully allow us to eventually get to the point that is my ideal digital distribution service.<br><br><br>Newflash: Doujin-Moe is a pirate site, and them being able to offer unlimited downloads comes straight from that because they don't have to pay any kind of licensing fees and such. As I said earlier, a legit subscription service where you'd be able to download everything DRM-free is just not something that is going to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you Daiz.</br>  <br> a legit subscription service where you'd be able to download everything DRM-free is just not something that is going to happen <br><br>Speaking for yourself of course. Lots of really good subscription services do it.</br></br></br>  Reminder to report all shilling and samefagging "discussion".  <br>Like what? Can you name me some that would actually have a larger catalog consisting of multiple artists? Because the only things I know are basically small single-artist kind of things.</br>  <br>W-what<br>Where did you get this, I'm loving that people are starting to translate his manga works.<br>Are you working on it anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Use this actually, http://exhentai.org/g/830618/e0b43d<wbr>381f/ had to change the title and the credits page cause I couldn't be arsed to translate properly.</wbr></br>  <br>I guess I'll just stick with the DRM-free tanks and pirate the magazines, then. Being forced to access content through an online viewer is something I refuse to support. Ideally, there will be enough people like me to make the gap between the subscription model and the DRM-free model large enough for Wani to change their position. I imagine that if the subscription model was super popular, Wani may not budge since they're getting enough money to not justify DRM-free magazine releases.</br>  <br><br> ahegao <br>Bless you anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about hentai specifically. There's music and movie streaming services that offer full drm free download of their entire back catalog starting the moment you sub.</br>  <br> Being forced to access content through an online viewer is something I refuse to support. <br><br>Is the online thing your main issue with it? If that's the case, then yeah, can't really help that. If it's the online viewer, though, then that's something that can be worked on.<br><br><br>Like what? Again, I know stuff like that exists on smaller scale, but I've yet to see any in larger scale myself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forced to access content through an online viewer <br><br>This. This is the worst part of it. Not gonna fap like some common pleb that doesn't download everything. And you faggots shit on anyone who says they stream anime. Hypocrites.</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of DRM are we talking about here? Does it just not let you save files or does it prevent you from taking monitor screenshots? Some of the DRM image viewers that do let you screenshot don't let you view the original resolution, only a version scaled to your monitor. <br><br>Nevertheless, nothing beats lossless capture cards, unless you take infeasibly drastic measures, so it's all pointless anyway.</br></br></br>   Came so hard that the cum went trough a sock and hit my monitor <br><br>I'm not sure if i should be amazed or worried that my cum is not thick enough.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824456/b4fd03<wbr>dc59/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>No offline access in the program/app of my choice is a no go in my book. Online viewers are not customizeable (filters/interpolation/upscaling/et<wbr>c), and have sluggish performance, especially when seeking.</wbr></br>  <br><br> Newflash: Doujin-Moe is a pirate site <br><br>So is Fakku, right now. This is literally irrefutable, but I know you'll try anyway.</br></br></br></br>  Good things to do after fapping?<br><br>Drink water, what else?</br></br>  <br>Eat something.</br>  <br>Read cute hentai mangos.</br>  <br> new Orutoro <br><br>OH GOD YES</br></br></br>  <br>Clean your onahole.</br>  <br>Take a nap.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Eat the cum for the protein</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dont stand up for atleast 15 minutes, less stand up quick just after you came.</br>  <br>JESUS CHRIST FUCK OFF</br>  <br> Online viewers are not customizeable (filters/interpolation/upscaling/et<wbr>c)</wbr> <br><br>Personally I don't think the lack of customization in scaling filters is an issue as long as the methods used by default are good. Admittedly FAKKU's online reader does currently rely on just browser scaling, but hopefully I can do something about that in the future. Anyway, filtering is really the one big area where providing customization in an online reader would be hard, but otherwise offering customization isn't really any different than offering it in any other reading application.<br><br> and have sluggish performance <br><br>Man, I really should set up an open demo for the FAKKU reader somewhere just so I could ask any random person to take a look at it themselves. But since I sadly don't have that, I can only give you my word that performance has been a major concern in my reader - I want it to perform like a desktop application, and I'd say it does a pretty good at that...<br><br> especially when seeking. <br><br>...albeit admittedly fast seeking (basically holding down next/previous page button) is something it lacks right now (I do have an idea on how to implement that, though). But at least there's chapter points to let you jump around to where you likely want to go anyway quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That filename, jesus christ I can't stop laughing.</br>  <br>This is the fucking worst part of owning an onahole. It's not that it's a hassle to clean. It's the shame and embarrassment as you scrape your cum out of a rubber tube and wash it down the drain. I always imagine some sad violin music playing as I'm doing it.</br>  <br>I've never felt this, I actually like seeing how much cum i pumped inside.</br>  Any good vanilla doujins featuring impregnation and pregnant sex?  how often do you have a sad cum  <br>Sure you can optimize your reader, but it will never come close to the features/performance of a dedicated program. And what options do you have if the site is down or you don't currently have internet access (traveling, isp issues, etc)? You lose access to something you paid for. I think paying for something but not owning it is dumb.</br>  <br> that initial load of cum that plops down when you turn it over <br><br>Almost makes me want to go again.</br></br></br>  <br>Never sad just "ruined". Like accidentally closing what you were reading just as you cum because your hands became retarded and now you can't get it open in time because your shaking.</br>  <br>IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT IT'S OUT <br>http://belldandy100.tumblr.com/</br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't mind washing them out. I fucking hate drying them though. I've actually been using those tenga eggs recently. They take less prep time and you can reuse them even though they're disposable. Cleaning them is a breeze, too. I just rinse them out and let them air dry on top of some microfiber cloth.</br></br></br>  <br>Time to fap.</br>  <br>Have you even cummed too soon? Cumming during foreplay can be underwhelming.</br>  <br>At least you don't have siblings who takes your stuff without asking.</br>  <br> but it will never come close to the features/performance of a dedicated program. <br><br>I beg to differ on that. The web is a pretty powerful platform these days, you know.<br><br> I think paying for something but not owning it is dumb. <br><br>Well, as I've been saying, it's a catalog RENTAL subscription. You pay a fee to have a rental-like access to a catalog for a limited time. The value of this model has been demonstrated by a great many services. But if you don't want to pay for it, then well, don't. But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br>At least pretend like you know where you are.</br></br>  Diaz don't you have somewhere better to advertise your shit?  <br><br> people actually spent 2 years translating and decensoring a work whose art looks like it came out 20 years ago <br><br>Why? What a waste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br><br>Did you really just fucking say this? I really never thought you could shill any harder but you somehow find a way.</br></br></br>  <br>Cool bait dude</br>  <br> At least pretend like you know where you are. <br><br>Well, it doesn't hurt to say it, you know. And there's still plenty of non-Wani content that is not easily legally available, so it's not like it'd be that infeasible of a request.</br></br></br>  <br><br> But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br><br>Where the fuck do think we are? Holy shit, Sad panda will always be the superior site, fucking kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The web is a pretty powerful platform these days, you know. <br><br>Would you rather stream anime or watch it locally? Talking about home viewing here so don't try and make up some "great if traveling" strawman.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you trying to say that my eyesight is "bait"? Anon please.</br>  <br> But preferably don't consume the content of the service via illegal means then either. <br>Has the chemo damaged your brain? Or were you born retarded?</br></br>  does anyone have the translated TOC for Shitsurakuten 2015-06? i was on a trip when it came out and the jews already removed it from the panda. i can't find it anywhere else  Is there a way to filter out fujoshi content in search other than using the '-' function without being reminded of it? Bad thing is that I might miss out on some stuff from time to time if they are tagged wrongly or is only a small portion of it.  <br>Video playback (especially anime/fansub playback) is more complicated that local playback would be preferable due to better availability of technical possibilities, but I wouldn't be opposed to high quality streaming either (think eg. 10-bit HEVC with hardsubbed typesetting and softsubbed dialogue with high quality HTML5 canvas rendering - picture related from some experimenting I did a good while back).<br><br>Manga reading is technically much simpler, though, with scaling algorithms used being basically the most complicated thing involved, and I believe you could get some nice results on that front with WebGL and some shader work.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure the web is powerful, but there will always be high overhead.<br><br>If you don't want me to pirate, use a DRM-free viewer. But of course, you won't do that. I really don't get the logic. You have 3 groups of people interested in the content. One group who doesn't care about offline access, one group who will pirate regardless, and one group who does care about offline access. Group 1 will be paying customers regardless.

I tried to play around with Levels() and ColorYUV() but I can't get myself to make colors match. The public raws (MX) for Ushio and Tora are disgusting and even Sentai's video manage to be better than them. </br></br> </br>  <br>[Bosshi] Asoberu Karada<br>[Kisaragi Gunma] Suki ni Nattara Icchokusen!<br>[Naruko Hanaharu] Shoujo Material<br>And there will also be Toshio Maeda releases in the future.<br><br><br>Unless the color difference between TV&lt;-&gt;CR is a simple Colormatrix conversion, don't bother trying to match them up. It's pretty much fruitless unless you want to start matching every scene individually with Tweak().</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>source</br>  <br> color correcting a tv stream </br>  <br> 10-bit <br>Oh God he's at it again.</br></br>  <br> shits on other digital distributors for shitty drm and practices <br> now forced to do the same by the behind the times japs <br> suddenly there is no other way and it's okay <br><br><br>It would have to be some super obtrusive drm to do that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats its not DRM anymore, its plain malware.</br>  <br>You do need some sort of content protection to enforce a rental model - realistically speaking, the options are either that or no catalog rental subscription at all. The shitty part is really the not being able to also sell the magazines individually DRM-free like with everything else, but given time I believe we'll get there too.</br>  <br>You could always just offer a premium+ style service that includes downloads.</br>  <br>I can't color correct it at all with a ColorMatrix conversion.<br>The difference is this bad:<br>screenshotcomparison.com/comparison<wbr>/134025<br>I just read the lastest Torchlight blog entry (https://mechaweaponsvidya.wordpres<wbr>s.com/2015/05/21/merging-colourimet<wbr>rically-different-sources/) and he seems he didn't manage to color correct CR successfully. So should I let the colors as they are or should I go with MX?<br><br><br>In this case, I'd like to color correct a web stream.<br><br><br>Nothing wrong with it, I wish we would have someone like him in the french fansub scene. Groups here in France are filled with 14 years old fuckers who only know how to rip CR, re-encode their stream and burn their sub in a bitrate starved mp4. The worst is when they're attempting at translating english subs for a show, there's literally a mistake every 3 sentences.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>It's 100% malware. Only things I can think of that do that are ones that force you to download their own viewer that basically locks your computer down while it's open. Often virus scanners will go crazy while it's doing its thing as well.</br>  <br>Jesus the art for that new Shokugeki doujin was too good. <br><br>I knew there'd be another doujin of Soma coming soon.</br></br></br>   page is incredibly hot <br> fap furiously <br> cum <br> next page is even better <br> mfw </br></br></br></br>  My new favorite artist:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/713335/82ce08<wbr>363c/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/768633/b71143<wbr>35b7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/698630/92858f<wbr>952d/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/785347/c278eb<wbr>b639/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824914/a6778e<wbr>a2bc/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> You do need some sort of content protection to enforce a rental model <br><br>Fuck off. A service you have to pay to access the downloads is already content protection. I've poured a fair amount of money into hentai over the years and I was mildly optimistic about seeing a lot more translated content from Wani but this is bullshit.<br><br>Stop trying to justify this crap, you're not getting a single cent from me again as long as you're this stupid as to make people pay for online viewer-only. No amount of your shilling or 'but it's HTML5!' will change the fact that it's still a freaking online viewer only.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Quickshot. </br>  <br>I always finish reading whatever I'm reading and go back to the good part first.</br>  <br>Again, sorry to say, but when it comes to a catalog subscription model, it's basically rental or nothing. DRM-free downloads will only be available for individual purchases, and ideally we'll be eventually selling magazines like that as well, but you're just not going to get a catalog subscription with DRM-free downloads.

Doujin-moe is shit.</br>   endorsing DRM, a thing that has never stopped piracy in the history of mankind and has only ever inconvenienced paying customers <br> 2015 <br>Is this seriously the same guy who coded 10-bit anime subs?</br></br>  <br>an app called e-hentai reader</br>  <br>Wut. You can download every single thing on the site immediately after paying for your first month. The fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br>No you can't, they changed it after the last leak</br>  <br>Wont this just move leaks 70 days?</br>  Well, I put up a demo of the reader in its current state for anyone interested: http://test.daiz.io/readerdemo/<br><br>Controls-wise you can navigate with arrow keys and WASD. You can also change pages with Page Up and Page Down, and jump chapters with Home / End (as well as Q and E). Space also works for Next Page. You can also use the scroll wheel to change pages at the top &amp; bottom, though you can turn that off in the options if you wish. F or the button in the top bar to go fullscreen, Enter to hide / show the UI (also toggles via mouse movement and slightly after page changes).<br><br>There's also some touch controls for mobile devices but for some reason this demo version seems to be crashing my phone browser (while the version on FAKKU has no issues) so I don't recommend trying that right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't it say that anywhere on the site? Just says "Download any hentai gallery to your hard drive as a single zip-file which you can keep and view forever." as what you get for subbing. Nothing about a wait period.</br>  <br>holy shit, it's  great </br>  Fucking NOICE. I love Okusan doujins, but only when they're rape/cheating/NTR.<br><br>That's the only thing this sow is good for. Fuck happy people and fuck happy marriages.</br></br>  <br>Daiz please.</br>  <br> taking the time just to brag about how edgy you are on an anonymous image board </br>  <br>It's actually not half bad.

Specifically I'd be interested in stuff you'd like to have that isn't there right now.</br>  <br>Once you get past a certain age it's no longer being edgy, just normal and expected.</br>  <br>Being a little crybaby afraid of human relationships is not normal or expected, it also has nothing to do with age.</br>  <br> Autoscroll to next page when arriving to the bottom of the page <br>That's horrible, makes it too easy to change pages accidentally.</br></br>  <br>There's a small buffer to that (it takes 4 wheel turns for the page to change if the page requires scrolling). It doesn't work optimally on laptops though or anything that produces a ton of scroll events, which is why there's an option to turn it off in the settings.<br><br>I do plan on investigating if I could improve on the behavior. If nothing else, I'll probably just make it default to off if tons of scroll events are detected in rapid succession.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127706785 <br><br><br><br> click on NEED HELP? <br> tells me to buy a book if I want help <br>DAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZ!<wbr>!!!!!<br>Otherwise, it seems fine.

The thread in question mainly just includes the same control information I gave here as well as some explanation for the various settings. I really need to add some real in-reader help prompts at some point...<br><br><br>My main reason for using Ubunchu is that it's simply the only CC-licensed actual manga that I know.</br></br></br></br>  Daiz is confirmed Fifth Column.<br>The question though is, for whom and against whom?<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth<wbr>_column</wbr></br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/830663/55b03a<wbr>adf5/</wbr>  http://exhentai.org/g/830669/485c35<wbr>ee44/<br>Put up the first chapter.</br></wbr>  <br><br>Thanks, anons.</br></br>  <br>Whats even the deal with that h-manga?<br>Literally no buildup and girl was a fullblown slut right away insulting MC while at the same time saying she loves MC in her mind. The entire characterzation was all over the place.</br></br>  I read a series a while ago that was a school of femdom women who controlled everything in the school. Anyone that did something bad such as being late to class was "punished". Can someone help me remember that title?  <br>It takes under 5 minutes to set it up manually. It's not hard at all and you dont have to rely on a plug-in.</br>  <br>There are several stories like that, including the upcoming animu.</br>  <br>I'm sure that its not hentai, but who knows, maybe it is.</br>  <br>Double S Size, probably.</br>  <br>So it's just the same shit as sadpanda's buttons.<br>Great invention there.</br></br>  <br> implying Daa-san can be NTR'd <br>Okusan might cheat on him, but noone will ever beat Daa-san's enormous cock, not even gaijins.</br></br>  <br>Who cares, I've been fapping to it the last few weeks.<br>Seeing a girl being dominant towrds her boyfrind but still being submissive towards while being fucked by another guy is one of the best aspects of NTR.<br>NULL Mayo's NTR is so stupidly hot I can't help it. I'm glad he's now being published in a magazine, makes him get over his fucking doujinshi and jump on original material.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess its different tastes. The girl is kinda sjitty and the teacher has as much character as a floating dick which makesthe NTR kinda lame.<br>Also tell me your opinions on why the girl still says she loves MC despite being so vile to him and trying to make him raise a bastard child. Maybe you got a bigger insight to this.</br></br>  <br>Dunno if you're still here Daiz (who am I kidding, you have nothing better to do), but when you say DRM are you talking the current reader-only stuff or will you be ramping it up somehow?</br>  Anyone got som NTR artist recommendations with the girl cheating on her husband/ boyfriend willingly without the use of drugs, blackmail or resulting in mindbreak?<br>Kinda like Mizuryu Kei pkus NTR (Im aware that he has some NTR stuff)</br>  <br> Also tell me your opinions on why the girl still says she loves MC despite being so vile to him <br>Because she awoke her sadistic side, possibly? Because she has been drugged and twisted her mind? You can see in the end she went full sadistic and bitch. And this is NTR so of course she will prefer the stealer's cock. You don't have to look further to "understand" this story.<br> and trying to make him raise a bastard child <br>Because it's hot to the reader? That's the pinacle of NTR.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Double S Size <br>Yes.

I think the moral degradation tag covers that, so try searching with it.</br></br>  There is a new one that probably wont get translated too.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830660/ce3b96<wbr>ed28/</wbr></br>  <br>Wrong link.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830337/58ab0d<wbr>8e41/</wbr></br></br>  <br>moral degration isnt specific enough.

It ruined that whole momentum with the cliched asspull of getting her first role at the end of the anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> forced <br><br>Nope<br><br> ruined <br><br>Nope<br><br> asspull <br><br>Extra nope. The whole thing was set up perfectly fine early on, with Zuka leaving an impression but ending up concluding that she sounds a tad too young for the part. Also, the younger sister character was introduced with zero consideration for Zuka until they started thinking about who they should get to voice her.<br><br>I'm surprised someone can be so wrong in such a short post.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was a great fap.</br>  <br> asspull <br>You never been in the job market before? Getting called back for an entirely different position from the one you initially applied for is a thing you know.</br></br>  <br> Also, the younger sister character was introduced with zero consideration for Zuka until they started thinking about who they should get to voice her. <br><br>Right there. They could've picked anyone but they happened to pick her. It doesn't always work that way. It's fine that they picked her, but it's not completely realistic.</br></br></br>  <br>Now, you're just nitpicking.</br>  <br>No, it didn't. Her getting a minor role doesn't mean she's no longer struggling in her job. If anything, ending with her not getting a role would have been a massive waste of time since there's no sense of closure.</br>  <br><br><br>He's also guilty of backwards thinking.<br><br>Just think for a second.<br><br>You're the director and as you're listening to auditions, a girl comes in that you think sounds great and runs it by the rest of your team. They concluded that she sounds a little too young for the part.<br><br>At the last minute, a younger sister character is created. It's perfectly reasonable to go back to that voice that stood out for you and that you liked from before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like I said it's fine that they picked her, but I would have found it more compelling that when she got the call back, get a little excited/nervous, and give an extra best effort it still wouldn't be enough to get the role. Many times in life you give your best effort and it just doesn't work out, but the silver lining is that there was progress made, she was one step closer to her dream than before with that callback, so if she puts in a little more effort and keeps a positive attitude then one day she will succeed. <br><br>It just felt a little contrived, since everyone else was getting their "happy ending" in terms of overcoming obstacles in their professions and they just did a quick setup and gave Zuka a chance of getting the role and she got it. For a feel-good series like Shirobako it works but I personally don't find it as compelling. I would've liked to see at least one person in that show not get to where they wanted to be but still live with hope and determination to get there one day.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeap, pedantry.</br>  <br><br>Sounds like a pretty moronic complaint if you don't mind me saying</br></br>  <br>  Many times in life you give your best effort and it just doesn't work out, but the silver lining is that there was progress made, she was one step closer to her dream than before with that callback, so if she puts in a little more effort and keeps a positive attitude then one day she will succeed. <br><br>It's worth noting that a very minor one-episode anime-original-character role doesn't exactly make her a silver screen superstar. Plenty of VAs have gotten similar one-bit roles and never been seen again.</br></br></br>  <br> get a minor role <br> omg she got a happy ending, so contrived  <br>Fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  Mii-chan a cute! I love her!  <br>It's a major milestone for her though, and I said "happy ending" pertaining to the anime itself since it occurred near the end and everyone's problems were being resolved. I realize she's just starting on her voice actress path.</br>  <br> but I would have found it more compelling that when she got the call back, get a little excited/nervous, and give an extra best effort it still wouldn't be enough to get the role. Many times in life you give your best effort and it just doesn't work out, but the silver lining is that there was progress made, she was one step closer to her dream than before with that callback, so if she puts in a little more effort and keeps a positive attitude then one day she will succeed. <br>Which was basically what was going for like the 1st 20+ episodes of the series. Did you even pay attention to the series?</br></br>  <br>Eh, I guess I can see it that way. But I'm a sucker for an everyone wins situation so I was happy she got the role, however minor it was. But I've been in plenty of situations where my best wasn't enough so I can kinda see what you're saying.</br>  <br>easily AOTC</br>  <br> hurray, I got an entry level fixed term job with shit pay and no guarantee of future projects yet! <br><br><br>No, he's just an idiot who can't into narratives. The one fucking time an anime actually resolves shit and not leave it open ended and you have faggots like him turning up to bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hurray, I got an entry level fixed term job with shit pay and no guarantee of future projects yet! <br><br>Doesn't change the fact that it's a big accomplishment for her. Everyone has to start somewhere no matter how small. Her friends even celebrated her success and Aoi cried tears of happiness.<br><br><br> No, he's just an idiot who can't into narratives. The one fucking time an anime actually resolves shit and not leave it open ended and you have faggots like him turning up to bitch. <br><br>There's nothing wrong with having an open ending. My personal take on the situation would be to see Zuka at the end sad that she was so close to clinching her first role, but even more motivated than she ever has been throughout the entire series to do better. That still counts as character development. I could look at her character and think, "Yeah she's definitely been through some hard times, but she's been making lots of strides, and with just a little more effort she'll get there one day" and just have the anime end with her unresolved storyline to engage the viewer into thinking what her future would be like. Again this is just how I would see it. <br><br>Her getting the role is fine too, but I realize for the sake of her narrative since everyone else's was being closed out, would make many people mad wondering whether or not she would ever get a role in acting. I would like it a little more ambiguous though, because in a very competitive and rigorous environment like voice acting you just never know what could happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  BD 7 cover is Andou and Satou!   shitobako circlejerk <br><br>Daily reminder than got cutdown from 4 cours to 2 and S2 never ever, faggots.</br></br>  <br> S2 never ever <br><br>Good, I like the show but there's literally no way it would have the same charm if they make a s2. Everyone's problems have been resolved and they're developed. Seeing them make more anime would just be the same stuff from s1 and it would be boring. Leave it now at its peak so people can look back at it fondly.</br></br></br>  <br>Take it easy, anon</br>  <br><br>For some reason I now want to see tem rendered in the style of Yahari S2.</br></br>  <br> 9400$ annual income <br><br>Might cover cigarettes for the year</br></br></br>    <br>Isn't she just great?</br>  <br>What a disgusting mesh.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  I want to make notMiuna cosplay as Miuna.

The characters and execution were well done, and the anime was full of best girls.  <br>We just have to believe</br>  I miss all those delicious cakes and milfs.  <br>Oi-chan's legs are miracles of the universe.</br>  I loved this show.<br>Shirobako went straight into my top 10 favorite anime after it ended. Maybe I was just waiting for a show like this with characters that aren't high-schoolers.</br>  <br>Well fuck. I can't believe I hadn't noticed how much she looks like Miuna.</br>  So, /a/, which Bakos are pure and which are not?  <br>Rufus is more or less confirmed cut, so you're out of luck.</br>  have all of these frames been scanned yet?  <br>Zuka was made to suffer the entire show. I was seriously worried watching her repeated slurring, drunken debacles in front of her friends. Near the end with the rejections piling up, she took to drinking alone in her little cubicle apartment where you could imagine one day they'd find her wearing piss crusted clothes and babbling incoherently, the beer cans waist deep, and she'd have to return home to the provinces to reabilitate and become a bank teller and ponder what couldn't be while her friends gradually move on with their lives in the city.<br>The point was made seiyous lead the toughest lives following their ambitions, giving her a small role at the end wasn't contrived when considering this.</br></br>  <br>you can't buy a portal into the 2d world.</br>  <br> there are people that didn't watch this live. </br>  <br>Ema is the purest. <br><br>Miyamori is the slut of the group.<br><br>Diesel probably sucked a couple of dozens of cocks for info.<br><br>Mii fucked a few guys for the position she was in initially.<br><br>Zuka fucked a couple of dudes to get some roles but they all turned out to be liars.

Thank god.</br>  <br>She made start appreciating tomboys.</br>  <br>They added a bit of extra text in some episodes. Not really worth waiting for BDs.</br>    <br>Fuck you.

Sure she's happy for Zuka, but she also finally realized after looking for the answer all series on why she should be passionate about being a producer; it lets her help the people she loves and those around her to accomplish their dreams, and that's a perfectly sound motivation to have toward your job. It made the journey of the series 100x better with just one scene.</br>  It would have been better if Zuka hadn't fulfilled her dream. The entire anime is grounded in reality and yet it ends up idealizing the anime industry way too much.  <br>I overall agree, but Haruoka did a pretty good job showing the ugly side of the industry.</br>  <br>Motherfucker, you don´t understand nothing about Aoi´s perfection<br><br>You sir, got that scene absolutely right</br></br></br>  <br> Motherfucker, you don´t understand nothing about Aoi´s perfection <br>She's a perfect slut.</br></br>  <br>I´ll fight you, nerd</br>  <br>What if PA Works in charge Yahari s3?</br>    <br> not a slut </br>  <br>As a production assistant you gotta do crazy shit to get things done by the deadline. Miyamori is the sort of girl that inspires people to get work done through ANY means. She literally meant it when she said: "I'll do anything.". It shouldn't surprise anyone that she fucks almost everyone around the office to inspire them.<br><br>Miyamori a slut but she is also the best production assistant.</br></br></br>  <br> Miyamori best girl <br>good man</br></br>  <br>You mean Ema.</br>  <br>You mean Mii-chan.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Sorry, but I dont remember Mii.

Or perhaps "They're saving their budget!".<br><br>So why was the topic of budget not brought up a single time in Shirobako? QUALITY was always attributed to either time constraints, or rushed keyframers, or Studio Titanic.</br></br>  <br>There's a TAGS OVA?</br>  <br>/a/ knows nothing about animation.</br>  <br>Budget is a descent catch all.</br>  <br>/a/ has a boner for it because its christmas cake the anime. Shirobako is overrated shit</br>  So, like, what's the plot of Third Aerial Girls' Squad?<br><br>All I get is that there are towers all over the world and they're swarming with Lockheed-Martin stealth fighters that are evil and will destroy everything, and somehow Vietnam-era fighters can score guns kills on Raptors.</br></br>  <br>Are you seriously trying to find logic in an anime plot?</br>  <br>Nah, I can forgive the guns thing because knife-fight range engagements are more visually interesting than BVR missile sniping.<br><br>I'm just trying to grasp the plot. Did Lockheed give birth to Skynet?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm more interested in the plot of Exodus, and in what kind of story would a cowboy showing up with one hundred horses be treated as logical.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9y6<wbr>fTTZBJ60</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Doesn't even really count as Christmas Cake since they all look like fucking HS girls. Literally everyone else looks like a real person but the main girls need to retain their moeness. Fucking stupid, just cheap otaku pandering.</br>  <br> So, like, what's the plot of Third Aerial Girls' Squad? <br>Cute girls riding cool planes while fighting awesome aerial fights.</br></br>  <br>She didn't deserve that job, she should've kept suffering. Fuck Zuka.</br>  <br>more budget would mean you could afford to hire someone who does stuff, in shirobako they had a few animators jump ship and had problems finding animators, more budget-&gt; more money to pay those animators, more likely to find someone willing to draw your keyframes. At least that's what I guess,</br>  <br>thats exactly i want. the panty stuff totally ruined SW for me</br>  <br>Don't bother, I think that the Third Aerial Girls' Squad is just a sarcastic take on the anime trends. It's a parody of Girls und Panzer, except with planes.</br>  <br><br>Except Girls und Panzer is pretty much a sports anime without any saving the world plot.<br><br>It really seems a lot closer to Strike Witches.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Complaining about moe? Why?</br>  <br>It's basically a "all girls cast fights a numerically superior foe after the world ends" story. With the usual philosophising about reasons to fight and a main character who's a void person with no reasons of her own.</br>  <br>Smart missiles got a little too smart for their own good</br>  <br><br>Neither Exodus nor Third Aerial Girls Squad require any explanation, because you've seen them before (or at least something like them).<br><br>Exodus is a standard idol show where the idols are hunted by law enforcement. You've seen one before. This one is just embellished with nonsense like aircraft carriers and cowboys and a hundred horses because it's not a real anime so the staff can have fun with it.<br><br>Third Aerial Girls Squad is a standard post apocalyptic military story about the remains of humanity fighting to survive against a numerically and technologically superior foe. You've seen one before. This one is just embellished with philosophizing about reasons to fight because the whole cast is the author's self-insert.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Shirobako was AOTS. Fuck Kiseijuu.  <br>*AOTY</br>  <br>Why is the corner of Andou eye red? If it weren't for that and the dyed blonde part she'd look even more generic that what's-her-name next to her.</br>  <br>AOTC*</br>    <br>Who?</br>  I don't think PA works understand how enjoyable this show was to people unless they're just putting it on hush to surprise everyone with an S2.<br><br>It sold pretty good too.</br></br>  <br>Who is this nectar angel?</br>  <br> their best-selling show ever <br> they don't understand <br><br>A S2 is also unnecessary. Such shows tend to get easily ruined by having a S2 that is too copycat or doesn't have enough plot material. Almost everything has been said and the characters all had their purpose achieved. We need to move on. At least, I know what kind of merchandising I'm going to get when I go to Japan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>anon shirobako WAS a 4 cour anime<br><br>they decided to do the anime in a 2 cour instead for some reason</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with <br>It worked great as a 2 cour and I think it'd get repetitive if we got more. <br><br>A second season after a (long) gap would work much better in my opinion if anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Prequel when?</br>  <br><br>Her name is on the card, come on anons</br></br>  <br>Boys can't be angels.</br>  <br>Because a lack of budget is usually not the problem. No budget is just an /a/ maymay.</br>  <br><br>And the giant robots ruined TTGL for me</br></br>  <br><br>I'm guessing they put it on hold to animated Charlotte. That's what I hear, anyways.<br><br><br><br><br>Every girl practically or literally just took their first step into the door. There's a story to tell as they move up the ladder in their respective fields. On top of that, they still have that movie the entire main cast keeps going back to time and time again throughout the show.<br><br>What you're suggesting is akin to mountain climbing, with the peak being the goal. When they made it through their first night, you would claim that showing anything further would be too repetitive.<br><br>In other words, it's a moronic claim to make.<br><br><br><br>Because they were unsure of its success. Doing a 4 cour is a huge risk for a show that may not do well.

She's never going to make enough money to retire, never going to have financial security, and will be working well into old age and arthritis doing something physically taxing and highly performance-dependent that could be robbed from her in one bout of illness or physical injury. Her angst should do with coming to the realization that just being good enough isn't enough, and despite the joy she feels now, her future prospects are grim.<br><br>Zuka should do eroge because it would be cute. Tonnes of popular A-list sieyuu have done, and continue to do ero regularly. Seeing Zuka struggle in a role like that would be cute, and considering how late of a start she got on her career compared to other seiyuu, bringing up the age angle makes for interesting angst.

The demand for character designers and gothlolis is much, much smaller than it is for regular gruntwork animators and even people like Sugie are still down in the trenches doing the cheap stuff after a lifetime of work.<br><br>To just say "oh, I'll just be good enough to climb out of this hell of mediocrity and claim financial success" is unrealistic in a field like that, and even if she does end up being the few of many, Gothloli demonstrated that even the most senior-level animators and designers still have to get back down in the trenches frequently and do the ugly work. Being stuck working into her golden years and living on shoestring savings and no financial fallback is just a reality.

It wouldn't match s1 and it would just be the same shit over again and lose all originality. Musani gets a new project, everyone knows what they have to do, shit happens and deadlines aren't met, suffering, then they pick themselves back up and continue. Add in some comedic workplace banter in between scenes. <br><br>The point has been made from a thematic perspective that each of the girls has overcome tremendous challenges and accomplished major milestones to truly ground their reality and passion of working in the anime field. This was easily the biggest strength of s1 and what really gave Shirobako its depth and uniqueness. No matter what, they know they love anime and want to continue working on producing it. Sure in s2, they might have to meet some different people and do things a bit differently, they may not adapt well to these new changes at first, but then they will get used to it and smile at the end of the day because they're doing what they love despite how tough of a job it can be at times. I don't see the point in repeating that. It's to be expected since the girls have committed themselves to that path of life. The only thing I wouldn't mind is an OVA showing them retired from working in Anime and all getting together for some Tea and watching the anime they made as HS students that later turned into a successful original anime project at some point in their professional careers.</br></br></br>  <br>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-</br>  <br>Hhhhhhhhhhhhhhh-?</br>  <br>What was the literal point of this character?

Thanks for buying me dinner, Anon!    <br>I want to race Aoi</br>  I just want to cum all over Arupin's face.  <br>The detective was the best.</br>  The fact that there's still multiple threads a day really shows how iconic this show was, and how much the characters had a lasting impression on everyone.<br>The crying scene is legendary. And it sold well too which is odd for elevens to have good taste for once.</br>  <br>It's definitely one the better made animes to come out of the past decade. Such a solid show hasn't come out in so long. The characters are astonishingly well-developed for such a large cast to the point that each character was memorable for something they had done in the show. A solid 8.5/10 for me.</br>  <br>This was the first scene I've seen in an anime where I felt like crying because of the amount of happiness I saw.</br>  Is Aoi the most /fa/ of the decade?  Did everyone forget about based Tarou?  <br>kouhai for ema</br>  <br> filename <br> not Aoi ni mo makezu <br><br>Tarou best boy</br></br></br></br>  Rewatched it recently. One of the best I've seen. But I just have been watching anime for a year now. Only have like 100 completed list entries. But still I can say that Shirobako was very clever. I didn't like the first episodes but I gave it a chance. Couldn't have decided better. Aoi gave me the chills and yes I almost cried when Zuka finally got one step closer to her dream.  Ema's dance is probably the best dance I have seen in my life. Diesel-san is good girl. Kinoshita had really funny moments.  The creator raid was epic. The golf battle made me laugh out loud for real. Funny story, that editor of the creator got what he deserved. Hiroshi trying to escape several times was hilarious. Tarou is a dickhead but I'd totally drink with him. Honda-san changing jobs was pretty surprising. Sugie-san is oldfag. Wouldn't have thought that Iguchi would join Ema's dance. Also the president always being calm, making food was awesome. He knew from the very beginning that everything would work out. Maybe he believes in the power of food. <br><br>I may not be as experienced as other people here but I still think that if you give Shirobako a 10/10 it is nowhere near being exaggerated. But still I understand if someone would declare me being crazy giving this a 10. It's just that the feels it gave me where astonishing. Overall it was more than enjoyable to watch. Will definitely rewatch again when my memories of it become hazy and hard to reach.</br></br>  Who wants this<br><br>Probably everything since the beginning of second half and maybe some from the first.</br></br>  <br>I think giving it a 10/10 is perfectly fair although I would give it a solid 8 or at most between 8-9. It's extremely well-made and excels basically in every aspect possible. It really comes down to personal preference I guess. The beginning was a little dull for me, but as I kept watching, it became more and more interesting.</br>  <br>Yes, please!</br>  <br>Thanks! That's kinda what I've been thinking - that I would totally understand if people gave it like 7 - 9 out of 10. Sure it's almost all about personal preference. But I've read some very bad reviews about shirobako after I watched it the first time. It seems that there are people who hold a grudge against P.A. Works - apparently because of earlier works they released. I think that it is very stupid to drop Shirobako because one hates the studio and also after seeing only 2 or 3 episodes. Afterwards they go ahead and write some really really bad reviews on Shirobako, proably typed with their middlefingers after they shove both of them up their arse, just to let out all the hate they have for a studio. But deep within they know that P.A. Works outdid themselves with Shirobako but of course they would never admit it. In my opinion it's as you said:<br> well-made  <br> excels in a lot of aspects <br>I found the characters to be damn well-established and I love the development a lot of them go through. The Art is top-notch quality and If you think about an anime-studio producing an anime about an anime-studio that is producing anime you should quickly come to the conclusion that the cleverness with shirobako really is strong. Because they're basically animating their everyday life. At least until some point. It's what they're probably best at. And I think you could definitely see it in each and every episode.<br><br>Sure, you get thrown into Miyamori's life and it may be a bit hard to get the hang of it but once you do (which happens if you just keep going) everyone should see that Shirobako is not an anime you should rate below 6-7/10</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is what deluded shitrobako fanboy actually believes </br>  <br>Yes, I do. And I won't accept any other opinion because I'm a deluded ignorant sick fuck.</br>  Remember the threads immediately after this episode?<br><br>Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant.</br></br>  <br>You and me both.<br><br> still more than 3 weeks until vol.7 ships from Amazon. </br></br></br>  <br>The episode had more than that dance.</br>  Miyamori loves herself dem donuts.  <br><br>I'll take a copy too, thanks. Are the webms in there too?</br></br>  <br><br>Hang on, I'm uploading a slightly newer version of the folder<br><br>Not much animated pictures inside but I don't think you'll be missing much</br></br></br></br>  <br>Other than those delicious trips and dubs, do you happen to have some Shirobako icons?</br>  <br>It's not just that. Shirobako is also incredibly easy to relate to, as long as you're studying or working. The episode where Ema had a hard time dealing with both the quality of her work and the deadlines hit me hard when it aired because I had just done the same with a stupid presentation of mine I thought I had absolutely ruined (ended up with an average mark) in front of everyone because I hadn't worked on it enough and rushed it all in 3 days almost non-stop with 3 hours of sleep per day. I was absolutely paranoid and depressed after that, and the Shirobako episode hit me damn hard.</br>  Continued from <br><br>Real subs when?<br>LN update for V7 was set for tuesday, and today is wednesday<br>FUNI a shit<br>Albedo gets the ED, but Narberal will be every secondary's waifu by the end of season 1</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because you like a typo, it doesnt make it cool or right</br>  <br>No, the head maid has a dog's head, IIRC<br><br><br> How strong is she compared to the guardians? <br>Weaker</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Real subs when? <br> FUNI a shit <br><br>Ahh, EOPs.</br></br></br></br>   1 cour <br> Will definitely up to the 3rd volume <br>My body won't be ready for this.

I wish they skipped Serena vs Dennis to show it properly.</br></br>  I'am free so who wants a duel on<br>Ygo Pro it just got an update with new cards only for the android version</br>  <br>Maybe. I thought for sure that when Dennis said Serena would be right along during the prison break that he actually meant he'd ported her back to the Fusion Dimension, but he didn't.</br>  <br>The first one is literally the best YGO duel of all time, most duels suck in comparison to it.</br>  His face looks more fox-like every episode.  <br> Lavalval Chain <br><br>why<br><br> Infinity <br>Agreed<br><br> Vanity <br>why</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>his forehead nose conjunction must have hurt that mom pretty badly in childbirth</br>  <br>No, but that one wasn't even a duel. They showed the beginning and the end and that's lame.<br><br>Meanwhile, if they skipped Serena vs Dennis, things like Tricklown wouldn't exist too.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't make it xyz as those are their big money makers and nobody cares about synchro and Ritual is a bad joke so it had to be Fusion by process of elimination.</br>  RURI~<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>05685</wbr></br>  <br>Q U A L I T Y</br>  <br> Lavalval Chain <br>It's fine<br> Infinity <br>The problem is the card in conjunction with Ptolemy that and the fact that you're allowed to use overlays on opponent's turns, it effectively can shut down anything if used properly, which is a bit much, deserves to at least be limited or allocated solely to Rank 5 decks, having it in Tellar is too much especially multiple.<br> Vanity <br>Needs to be banned.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't make this game more complicated than it already is.</br>  <br>Synchro already got to be the evil one in 5D's and Xyz was a bit overdone in Zexal<br>And Fusion makes the most sense story wise as it makes sense that Fusion dimension would be the one trying to fuse all dimension.</br></br>  <br><br>I like that we learned that Jean-Michel is actually just some lower dog and doesn't have that much power after all. Makes him somehow more interesting, dunno why</br></br>  <br>And what about the fags like me who just like Cyber Dragon and the fact that you can use Infinity with a lot of deck you may like (like NK or LS) is something I can love even though everyone else can also do it?</br>  <br> not overlaying the dimensions </br>  <br>I love Cyber Dragon too, but the card is a tad much considering it's not limited and can be used on either turn and keep consistent Xyz materials. It mostly just needs to be banned from Tellar, they can easily get two of them out in short work.</br>  <br>How do you make Cyber Dragon Nova or Infinity in NK or LS?</br>  <br>In LS you can use Clownblade and the milling does the rest. NK it's something I have never see tho.</br>  <br>how do you Noble Knight into infinity I need to know for science reasons.</br>  <br>How soon until he turns on the Council and attempts a coup or joins up with Leo as head henchman?</br>  <br> not fine tuning the dimensions </br>  <br><br>It's more of a tech anyway, I have a weird use of outdated cards like Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge, and sometimes I can make a Ptolemaius&gt;Nova&gt;Infinity, at least with NK, with LS is what  say.</br></br>  <br> outdated cards <br> Call of the Haunted and Soul Charge </br></br>  <br>the only NK combo that goes into infinity on its own would be. Brothers +2 fillers into pto into nova into infinity. But even then why would you even run it in Nobles? When will you ever have 3 monsters on the field.</br>  <br>The problem with Ptolemaus is that it took a deck that was already incredibly easy and cheap (Rank 4 spam) and then gave it Rank 5 spam. Now, there's basically no reason to play CyDras because Tellars do it better, and that's just a very sad place to be.</br>  <br>I've seen plenty of NK decks that get three monsters on the field rather easily.</br>  <br>tbh I don't even know why tellars exist except to raise the price of good xyz's. Komoney pls.</br>  <br> Not Penduluming the dimensions </br>  <br>Could you post the Ygopro download link? I'm a devpro user.</br>  <br>Because fuck, designing cards is hard.

I don't think her predictions are specific enough to be that helpful to the Lancers, and she'd be another head to keep count of and out of trouble.</br>  <br>The real reason is that Aoi Yuuki is expensive and they already have Kakki as pseudo main character.</br>  <br>Think how confused Jean-Michel would be, seeing someone ritual summon.

FINALLY GOT TOLD, I hope Yuya will get character "development" from that.

And Shinji too.</br>  <br><br> Shinji vs Tsukikage <br><br>Pls don't job Ninjabro ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> He stalls constantly to let Shinji rant about social injustices some more and appear competent <br> It was all according to Reiji's plan to cause Civil unrest and reform the dimension </br></br>  <br> He drops the entertainer persona after losing to Jack. <br> No more Entermates, just Magicians and MUH YUZU cards. <br> Duels only for Yuzu. <br>Also sets up Yuya's rematch with Jack where he'll crush Jack with the next evolution of Odd Eyes.<br>Also how pissed would Yoko be at Jack telling her son not to duel for EGAOS anymore?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gon losing to fucking Crow </br>  <br> Neo Bomber <br> not jobbing </br></br>  <br>Are all of these riding duels, or is it like Fortune cup that alternates?</br>  <br>If Gongenzaka is on a d-wheel, then there's a high possibility that the tournament is riding duels only.</br>  <br>So that is one part of the ED covered.<br>Still need a detective filler episode, a concert, ruin exploration, space travel and some billiards</br></br>  <br><br>I'd actually be disappointed if Crow loses his first duel and Gon already got against Bennis this arc so it's alright</br></br>  <br>Crow has an entire series filled with his victories. He doesn't need any more, especially against a good Arc-V character.</br>  <br>Did he actually have any TOURNEY wins?<br>I know Jack had at least one</br></br>  <br>Seriously anon, do you truly believe in what you said just now?</br>  <br>In the epilogue of 5D's he's shown to be nearly as accomplished as Jack on a different Pro Circuit.</br>  <br>So, nothing on-screen?<br>Man</br></br>  <br>Yes. There was no reason to bring him back to begin with.</br>  <br><br>Huh? Jack is telling him the exact opposite. If anything Jack tells him to not use Egao dueling only to make himself happy so basically Yuya is supposed to go even beyond Egao and needs to entertain the crowd no matter how he himself feels. Which of course is bullshit, but that's exactly what Jack is doing as KINGU. <br>The only thing Yuya can take from this is being more persistent with his Entertainment dueling and just use it when he feels like it, which is also what Yoko told him</br></br></br>  <br>For all the crap he gets, Crow actually didnt win much at all in 5Ds. He jobbed more than Jack</br>  <br><br>This is just stupid. Arc-V Crow has nothing to do with 5Ds Crow and brining your hateboner for Crow to Arc-V is absolutely retarded. There is literally nothing wrong with Arc-V Crow</br></br>  <br>There is literally no reason for him to exist here either. Shinji could have easily taken Crow's role so far.</br>  <br><br>He didn't have a single loss in part 1 but in part 2 he jobbed quite a lot</br></br>  <br><br>The same logic Shinji has absolutely no reason to exist</br></br>  <br>No he didn't. Look at all his wins.<br><br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Crow_H<wbr>ogan#Duels</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Someone had to save Yuya &amp; Co.'s bacon when they first got to Synchro and then bust out of prison.<br><br><br>Also for someone who spent a decade in the clink, Hanafuda Man remained mark-free so what did Crow do in this dimension to warrant getting one?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And let's not forget that a Blackwings and RaidRaptors, be it in 1vs1 or as a team in a tag, is sounds like a pretty good opportunity for Winged-Beast infested comboes.</br>  <br>Maybe he was imprisoned before the marks were implemented.</br>  <br><br>Chojiro is a celebrity and also was the most powerful man in prison. His goons had markers too</br></br>  <br> Kalin <br> having cards in his hand <br><br>Yeah if you want to fuck up his deck strategy</br></br></br></br>  BUT WHAT DOES IT SAY?  <br> Episode 65: The Shattered Entertainment Duel <br>I know exactly why i got this boner<br><br> Episode 66: Opening Duel!! Crow vs Gongenzaka <br>Seems interesting<br><br> Episode 68: Rise of the B Forces <br>I'm rooting for Tsukikage</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was in the cells for 10 years. He didn't even know Friendship Cup was a thing, let alone Riding Duels. He was probably sent into prison before markers started going out.</br>  <br>Is this gonna be like when Yugi gave Judai Winged Kuriboh?<br><br>Will Yuya debut Junk Kuriboh?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you see the arena?
