[ Hey guys, maybe we can actually talk about the plot this time?<br><br> https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr> </br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br> Thanks, OP. </br></br>  <br> Dat pic <br> Dubs 8 <br>Komachi aproves</br></br></br>  <br> Hee.. Hee.. </br>  <br> 88 <br>Well done OP, 8man will be proud of you.</br></br>  Iroha has no feelings for 8man.<br><br>Yui's feelings are not genuine.<br><br> Long time no see, /a/! </br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Oregairu will end with this scene.  <br> Those look strikingly similar to the glasses 8man bought her. </br>  <br> “Did you say pointless!? I-Is not! Actually, I’m not the one being sly, it’s you, senpai!” <br><br>Well if anything, I'm glad we got the full context of this scene. This line kind of confused me in the anime since the progression of the conversation didn't give me the impression of 8man acting "sly" in anyway; so I just assumed it was Iroha doing making a comeback. <br><br>But after reading the chapter it actual does kind of give the impression of 8man being sly; at least from Iroha's perspective. Denying the fact that he has a preference for younger girls, but bringing up her birthday and commenting that he doesn't consider her younger than him (in other words it could be interpreted by her as him saying she is still in his hit zone), does actually sound like he's being tsundere about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Watari sabotage her character like that?<br>I'm very depressed.<br>Does she have any chance of of development?<br>It looks like a never ending night for her.<br>I'm not so sure anymore about what will happen to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouhou, is that you?</br>  <br> Yukino <br> character </br></br>  <br>  not ZR <br>8/10<br><br><br>  being this much of a faggot </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yuki <br> no </br></br></br>  <br> Why did Watari sabotage her character like that? <br>It's not so much sabataging as it is setup. All of her defenses are down around 8man. She wants to be herself but doesn't know who that is. Yukino will be a much stronger character once her issues have been resolved.<br> I'm very depressed. <br>Fuck off with your blogshit.<br> Does she have any chance of of development? <br>She has the highest chance of character development out of any character in the series right now.<br> It looks like a never ending night for her. <br> I'm not so sure anymore about what will happen to her. <br>Quit being so pessimistic. Remember that this is literature. Every time a problem is introduce it's so that it can be resolved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukinofags <br> taste <br><br>Go back to animesuki and circlejerk with that Spyro tripfag.</br></br></br></br>  rip sexy yukino<br><br>fuck FEEL</br></br>   She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt. With moist eyes, the breaths she let out were hot. <br><br> Then, she spoke in fragments. <br><br> “Do you hate… younger girls?” <br><br> I…… do not! Yeah! If you had to ask, I absolutely loved them! <br><br>WHY DID YOU SKIP THIS FEEEEEEEEEEL?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sensei lived with some guy? Someone give me some source/context here.<br><br>I was sure she was a virgin.</br></br>  <br>FEEL animators are Irohafags<br>FEEL marketing department are Yuifags<br>FEEL writing team are Yukinofags</br></br></br>  <br>Because placing too many Iroha flags in an episode meant to set up for drama would be silly.</br>  <br>She did, that guy also ran away with some of her stuff<br><br>Not sure if he's gigolo or just a con-man</br></br></br>  <br>Because if you want the best girl you need to BUY THE LNs</br>  <br>So she could easily still be pure. Just a roommate.</br>  <br>  roommate <br>The context is both romantic and sexual<br><br>Let me search the LN just to be sure</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please do.</br>  <br>You can dream about it if it makes you feel better.</br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night anon-kun</br>  Hikigaya Yui  <br>Sensei won't be pure because she's not a love interest. Sending her around the block a few times in her earlier years is the best way to highlight why the age difference actually matters in barring their relationship from leaving platonic territory.</br>  <br>She is pure unless she's willing had sex with more than one specific guy.<br><br>Is there any proof of that?</br></br></br>  <br> She is pure unless she's willing had sex with more than one specific guy. <br>Now that's just moving the goalpost<br><br>Anyway, Sensei is so sharp and mature when dealing with them because she's old and experienced a lot of things, sex and bad relationship is just part of the mountain of firsthand knowledge she had.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for the information. But by my standards its safe to assume she's pure, right? I wasn't trying to move the goalposts, that was what I originally meant by pure.</br>  <br><br>What's your definition of pure?</br></br>  <br>This<br/></br>  <br>It's safe to say she's pretty loyal (if not obsessed) to any partner she had at the moment.<br><br>As for the number of men who gave her the D, she probably had multiple broken relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not looking for probably.</br>  <br>Well then, she is pure by your standards, but used goods anyway</br>  <br>And did you ever find that passage in the LN? Because it didn't sound very definitive.</br>  What are each girl's chance of winning at this point? Or if there's any at all  <br> Komachi  99%<br>Loner 1%</br></br>  <br>DUDE GENUINE LMAO</br>  <br>It's difficult, no matter how much flag raise, 8man refuse to give definite preference<br><br>His feeling to Yukinoshita is the strongest, but it's ambiguous in nature.<br>He is the most conscious to Yui, who he got a boner on, but he's allergic to nice girl.<br>He enjoy Iroha's company, but can't decide to treat her as a girl or second little sister.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the one who was looking for the passage in the LN. But I read that part where she states she lived with a guy but things didn't work out because he conned her, only that I don't remember in which volume. And I'm not going to bother find that part because you would keep insisting she has her hymen intact unless WW states she got a dick in her womb</br>  <br>Well, yeah. Girls and guys can live together and have nothing happen. Existence doesn't make assumptions. Without explicit confirmation there's no proof in either direction.</br>  <br>Order of likliness:<br>Yukino &gt; Yui &gt; Iroha &gt; Saki &gt; Haruno &gt; Ebina &gt; Miura &gt; Sensei &gt; Komachi &gt; Saika &gt; Gahamama &gt; Yukimom<br><br>I think that covers everyone.</br></br></br></br>  Iroha x Zaimokuza<br>Yui x Cookie man<br>Yukino x Hayama<br>Saki x Yuu<br>Komachi x Tobe<br>Haruno x truck-kun</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Komachi x Tobe <br>That was random</br></br>  <br>  but he's allergic to nice girl. <br>I thought he gradually overcome his "nice girl" trauma in latest volume especially in this scene.<br><br> “Mood, huh…?” <br><br> Like what kind of mood? <br><br> For example, the mood on Valentine’s Day? <br><br> I suppose I could understand in that case. Occasionally, I’d learn from the masses, take in the mood, and play it off. Then, I’d just brush it all off with a simple “it’s what everyone’s doing.” Doing that made you want to have expectations, be spoiled, lose yourself, and wait. <br><br> But I don’t think that’s something you should do. <br><br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br> “By the way…” <br><br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br><br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br><br>The fact in this scene that 8man genuinely take initiative by himself to step forward his relationship with Yui is something rare to seen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gigolo: a young man paid or financially supported by an older woman to be her escort or lover. <br>Not that anon, but she specifically mentioned that guy was a gigolo, who left and took the furniture with him when he was done with her. While not explicit, it's really silly to be clinging to the purity thing at this point.</br></br>  <br>I don't think chances matter in face of Yukino's more or less destined route that is overwhelming. How Hachiman feels about Yukino is a cut above the rest.</br>  <br>If that's actually true I don't have much of a leg to stand on. Jesus Christ I don't want to believe she's just some rest-stop slut.</br>  Volume 10.5 pdf for anyone who wants it.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/hvcjzhcori.pdf<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>See now you say that but he also just asked Yui out this volume.<br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br> “By the way…” <br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br> “Huh? U-Um, yeah, I do… I think, “ Yuigahama said, prattling on and moving her hands in surprise. She fidgeted as she frantically took out her cellphone. But then, her movements abruptly stopped. <br> She shot a glance to the door of the club. After that, she had trouble bringing out her voice. And unlike earlier, her expression sank. <br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again? I just wasn’t confident in any of those. <br> Unable to exchange any more words, I glanced at her face, my back still slumped and my eyes downcast. The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. <br> To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying he didn't invite her just because he feel guilty about delay it too long (and gone with Iroha in the mean time also) </br>  <br>Thanks anon, been waiting to grab this for a while now. <br><br><br>I was thinking that might have been what motivated him to ask her. In the anime it feels like it almost comes out of nowhere, but considering that pang of guilt he felt at the end of the Iroha date, it seems likely that he asked her because of that.</br></br></br></br>  Finally got around to watching KLK over the past few days. It was absolutely, irrevocably  _fun .  Best outfit, expression, pupils and razormouth, there can be no denying.  <br>She bullied Senketsu, that automatically make her a shit.</br>  <br>Seeing her trash the rest of the cast was great though.</br>  <br>P L E B <br>L<br>E<br>B</br></br></br></br>  I think we all know who wore it best  <br> it </br>  <br>I'm sorry, Him. it was very insensitive to insult brogestu like that.</br>  <br> Him <br><br>Senketsu is a genderfluid</br></br></br>  Satsuki a best.  <br>He has a drill though, he must be a boy.  Girl Senketsu's a supreme beauty though. </br>  <br>You imply that you've seen lots of Femketsu. Show pls. My  heart  needs it.</br>  <br>I wish to unsee it.</br>  <br> genderfluid <br>Please be gay somewhere else, anon.</br></br>  <br>I wish I had lots.  I do have a bunch of alternate designs, but this one's the best easily. </br>  <br>Superior tastes friend. Those sadistic sinister eyes and facial expressions do it for me. Plus I just like the overall look of the outfit fitted onto her.</br>  <br>I had such a heart boner for Senketsu by the end, it wasn't even funny. Mako shipping him and Ryuuko throught the series gave me hope...  I was left actually speechless when he was incinerated and left floating in space. .</br>  <br>It's OK,  he's wrapped around Ryuko's heart, someday I'm sure they'll get him down from space.  </br>  Why is Imaishi the most based creator in the anime industry?  <br> MFW <br>Why?</br></br>  <br> that face <br>Kek.</br></br>  <br>Also best waifu.</br>  Shameful Ryuko best Ryuko.  <br>Nui isn't waifuable on the account she had too much pink, was the most annoying, and had the weakest arms.</br>    <br>That blush isn't anything.</br>  <br>just imagine them together, they could  discipline  all of japan in a matter of hours.</br>    <br> weakest arms <br><br>Nui was in the best shape out of the entire show. If only I had my old kill_la_fit image from my old computer.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, I think that is one of the things that aren't meant to happen.</br>  <br>Yeah, I agree. She might as well been born without.</br>  <br> Best shirt ever cheating on waifu for such endeavors. </br>  <br> you see ryuko, you can do it with jelly or without jelly. Some people use syrup; I personally prefer jelly </br>  <br>I like that blush. <br><br> Nui was in the best shape out of the entire show. If only I had my old kill_la_fit image from my old computer. <br>The lack of arms say otherwise.<br><br>Ragyo must of have been disappointed at Nui.</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>That seems more like a dream Satsuki should worry about considering what Disco Mom put her through.</br>  <br>We don't bother with little details here, we look up at the stars and think about the future that we have, and the sacrifices of those that were close to us. We ask ourselves "Is there something we could have done differently, something better?" We come up with hair-brain ideas like that one to try to just the fact that we were just too weak to save him, and there was nothing we could have done to change that. So we dream, because that's what he wanted us to do! So here's to you Senketsu, you were an inspiration to us all!</br>  <br>That actually makes sense.</br>  <br>I don't think ryuko is worrying in that image. its like those dreams u get when you haven't beaten off in a while. ryuko just needs to satiate her thirst  for satsuki's pussy </br>  <br>hey they could be browsing here man watch that.</br>  <br>That would be the worst thing to do. Disco MILF was into incest? Why have sex with your sister when your horrible mother would probably fap to that beyond the grave? No.</br>  <br> Imouto, I... </br>  <br> that look in her eyes <br>Well isn't that proof she has Ragyo's genes in her.</br></br>  Why am I liking short hair Satsuki more than long hair Satsuki?  <br>Because it shows her determination to undo her mom's mistakes.</br>  <br>I think that's it.</br>  <br><br>Because it focuses attention back on her tits.</br></br>  <br>oh yea that too, nearly forgot. It's like I was distracted or something...</br>  <br> Because it focuses attention back on her tits. <br>But her backside is better than her tits.</br></br>    <br>But now that you've seen that you can enjoy her tits. You get the best of both worlds.</br>  I want to cuddle that smile  <br> But now that you've seen that you can enjoy her tits. You get the best of both worlds. <br>I think you're on to something. I do however prefer Ryuko over Satsuki.<br><br>My Anon.</br></br></br></br>   you will never tease and flirt with Ryuko until she calls you an idiot and punches you <br> you will never get her to reluctantly go on a date with you <br> you will never make her happy <br>Why live?</br></br></br>    <br> mfw <br>Dang it, Anon, I didn't need to feel like that.</br></br>  <br> I met a girl like this <br> I could have had this <br>Now I'm just eternally sad<br><br>And I watch anime<br><br>This couldn't be worse</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      I think I'm just going to go to bed. I'll post more pictures if this thread is alive when I wake up. <br>Maybe I'll get a Ryuko dream. One that won't somehow change into a dream about Gamagori, Satsuki, me and a park. I think there was a French clown somewhere in that dream too.</br>  <br>just remember this <br>so you get a good nights sleep.</br></br>    <br> MFW <br>I don't need lewd yuri or yuri in general before I sleep.</br></br>  <br>LONG MAY HE REIGN!</br>  <br> was in somewhere in that dream too <br>Fixed.</br></br>  Best girl coming through    <br>YEA</br>    The best part of KLK was  lewd Ryuko fanart   <br><br>I wish I could have protected that edge</br></br>  The real question is  <br>Or</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127860796 <br>Also gays, and sometimes things just  get out of hand </br>  this show literally saved anime.<br><br>Mako a best.<br>Nonon for also best.</br></br></br>      <br>Mako a shit.</br>  <br>absolute garbage taste, i bet you like Nui too you shitter</br>  <br>Nope, you're the underage kid with garbage taste here.

Watashi am trained in kanji, and watashi is the top letter writer in all of southern California. Anata are nothing to watashi but just another weaboo. Watashi will korosu anata the fuck out with vocabulary the likes of which has never been mimasu’d before on this continent, mark watashino fucking words. Anata thinks anata can get away with hanashimasing that kuso to watashi over the intaaneto? Omou again, fucker. As we hanashimasu, watashi am contacting watashino secret netto of otakus across the USA, and anatano IP is being traced right now so you better junbishimasu for the ame, ujimushi.

Nami is just as useful and relevant as anyone else in the crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably moreso than most. It's just almost entirely a behind-the-scenes sort of thing</br>  <br>Nami looks much better now, other than that she is still the same character</br>  <br> she is still the same character <br>The same shit, yes.</br></br>  <br> Nami looks much better now <br><br>Nami literally doesn't have a fashion sense. All she does is go around in bikini. Also she looks like shit with long hair. <br><br>But Nami is old and busted anyway and the next girl to join will be the new hotness</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But she still is, before FI, during FI, during PH and just before the Sanjihats where last seen. Are you fucks even reading this manga?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127868493 <br><br>what about those weather wizards?<br><br>Even if you're suggesting shes weak. We've not seen her fight properly yet, but we will soon once we catch up with sanji et al</br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br> Also she looks like shit with long hair. <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Rebecca will join and many people hate her already.</br>  <br>this was just to show how vast the One Piece world is.</br>  <br><br>please, just stop trying</br></br>  <br>Robin beats her out now because of her jew greed</br>  <br>Why should she join? What is her dream? What does she wants to find?</br>  <br> I don't understand Nami's new design <br>It's okay. Just come out and say it. Fuck you probably don't understand most of the reasons behind the timeskip redesigns</br></br>    <br>clothes<br>and a place to be useful</br></br>   there are literally people who say her new design looks shit <br>Nostalgiafags and queers have shit taste and are as cancerous as always</br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br> good design <br>Tell us more about your shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>just let them be and let them whine about losing their boobless, short-haired stick-girl forever</br>  At least we can all agree that Brook is useless  <br> implying there's a deep reason for any of them beside Luffy's vest getting longer <br>Please stop. Oda only wanted Nami to look like a slut..</br></br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br>She had them since Skypia though. Someone post that one comparison pic please.</br></br>  <br> saved Nami &amp; Co from dying by beating Jora <br> saved Zoro &amp; Co from being shot while vulnarable and being easy targets at the lake in PH <br>nope</br></br></br>  <br>Is there a resin for luffy's vest getting longer? Really?</br>  <br> to look like a slut <br> look <br><br>Nami is a slut. It's one of the few cases in anime when you can't call her a slut to just to insult her, that's exactly what she is.<br><br>Nami doesn't feel romantic love for anyone, she would sell her body to fat old men just to have some money</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*reason</br>  <br>Nice head canon you got there.</br>  <br><br>You shouldnt use the figurine as a critique of her design<br><br> 0 gravity tits <br> 0 gravity neck </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She flashed people for money and as a kid offered to pay for things with her body. That's pretty slutty.</br>  <br>Those pirates who took on Arlong Park?<br>A bunch of kids. Kid's with promise but kids all the same.<br><br>The pirates who left Sabaody and took on the New Fishmen Pirates? A crew fit for the Pirate King. Designs that imply determination and confidence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is supposed to be on a journey from an ordinary boy to a pirate. So along the course of the series, his clothes will become more and more piratey. Longer jacket, sash, pants, boots, tricorn hat, and probably, by the end of the series, the famed eyepatch.<br>On pic related you can clearly see Oda wasn't quite sure at first of exactly how much more piratey Luffy should be after the timeskip. He made multiple variations and settled for the tamest one.</br></br>  <br> Implying any redesign happens for any reason other than to sell more merchandise </br>  <br>Here. The tits are literally the same size.</br>  <br>Entities which lurked the Florian Triangle long before Moriah arrived, and were the cause of the ships disappearing within. Whatever they are, they absolutely dwarf the likes of Oars/Sanjuan Wolf, as well as Thriller Bark itself which is probably similar size to Dressrosa.</br>  <br>my brain. it hurts.<br><br>how can anyone that has followed One Piece this far be so fucking dense??<br><br>Awesome  gets it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We saw Bonney just before Dressrosa started, eating pizza and reading the newspaper about Law and Luffy's alliance.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127869131 <br>long hair makes every woman a lot prettier</br>  <br>That's neat, I like it. I hope by the end of the journey he'll get a coat to, in strong world was amazing</br>  <br>To slowly weaken Blackbeard's forces from the inside, or use Blackbeard's additional force to make his task of taking out the remaining 6th level prisoners in the world somewhat easier.</br>  <br> post-skip Namis tits are a lot bigger than pre-skip <br>Another myth busted, nice</br></br>  So Im on episode 7, when does this show start to get better? This begging is weak, but there have been cool moments.  <br>My favourite was "Why doesn't Zoro smile anymore?!"</br>  <br>A few arcs in.<br><br>Some will say during Kuro, some will say during Baratie. If your not in by the end of Arlong Park then you wont be at all</br></br></br>  <br>People who hate on post-ts Nami are mostly tumblrinas who hate the fact that her outfit is more revealing because of muh sexism</br>  <br>After the dressrosa arc</br>  <br>Read it.</br>  <br>Stop watching the anime and read the manga, its for your own good</br>  <br><br>Why lads?</br></br>  <br> back facing one of Luffy <br> it's the pirate symbol he drew for the flag <br>I hope he has that shirt lying around.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda isn't exactly consistent when it comes to breast size.</br>  <br>Fight me irl faggot</br>  <br>Around episode 300 the pacing gets utterly horrible and a bit later the drawings and animation are extremely low budget most of the time</br>  <br>Quality's better, less filler and around episode 300-400 the pacing drops to the floor.<br>It's basically a slideshow now.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OF0<wbr>MZ6FH67g</wbr>  [ ]<br>Shouldn't be many spoilers (if at all).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The manga is the original material, you dont have to put up with shit animation, shit art and filler.<br><br>Same reason in you wanted to judge a sng you'd listen to the original version, not a version produced by underpaid sweatshop animators.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook has actually been useful in every arc since he joined. It was just not as spectacular as some stuff other chracters did.</br>  <br>I want more badass Brook moments</br>  <br>You can read the first 700 chapters in glorious color on Batoto</br>  <br><br>But the anime has a God Tier OST<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sYK<wbr>owP0WEIc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then listen to it while reading the manga.</br>  <br>Already complaining 7 eps in? You should be hooked by now.</br>  <br>He still gets them some times. More for sure though.</br>  <br><br>Well get used to it because you're going to hear a lot of it while background characters gasp and tremble for 5 seconds to every line from the manga</br></br>  <br>Its okay I guess, Luffy is a mad cunt which regularly destroys my sides.</br>  why doesn't his power also knock out all his opponents? wouldn't his fruit technically slow all blood circulation?  <br>Have you encountered our Lord and Saviour Buggy-sama yet?</br>  <br> Luffy is a mad cunt <br><br>You don't even know.</br></br></br>  <br>Magic nigga.<br>How is Luffy alive when he's made of rubber?</br></br>  <br>Buggy just got rekt for fucking with the hat, also a side terminator.</br>  <br>Zoro's dimple is so kawaii</br>  <br> no captain's coat for Luffy post TS <br>That bummed me out a little.</br></br>  So by know we've all realized that Kaido isn't human<br>What animal is he and what fruit does he have?</br>  <br> What animal is he and what fruit does he have? <br>It really is still anyone's guess.<br>You'll get nothing but wild speculation.<br><br>Anyone who claims near certainty on this issue is a fool.</br></br></br></br></br>  I bet Drake will end up in alliance with Law and Luffy as a thanks for defeating Doflamingo, who he probably hates a lot more than he admits.<br>(Oda wouldn't place him in Law's flashback for no reason.)</br>  <br>He's a human with a zoan who prefers to remain in his hybrid form, thus being called a "beast/creature". I don't believe that was his silhouette we saw this chapter.</br>   Works for Mam now <br>Goddamn it I had hopes for him.<br><br>What's left for Drake &amp; Capone now they've both sold out.</br></br></br>  <br>He seems perfectly content working under Kaido though.</br>  <br>It doesn seem very strange he doesn't have a grudge against Doffy...unless his father was an asshole.</br>  <br>He's one of the few recurring "villains".<br>You'll start loving his shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait until he's revealed and there's suddenly a wave of:<br> I knew that <br> It was so obvious <br> You'd have to be a retard to think otherwise <br> Really obvious there Oda, getting lazy are you? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> well-designed <br>yes<br> interesting <br>meh<br> useful <br>not yet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't seem to like Barrels much though; he even ditched him before he died.</br>  <br><br>Just makes the eventual payoff sweeter</br></br>  <br> Works for Mam now <br><br>Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br>All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> concerned <br>*confirmed, obviously</br></br>  <br>I hate retards like you.</br>  <br>She's the navigator, they'd be dead several times over without her. <br><br>I agree her design is shit now, her boobs may not have gotten bigger but she shows them way more so they appear that way. Completely removes the uniqueness of her character. Same with Robin in my opinion, both their new hairstyles turned Robin (my favourite character) to below Zoro and Luffy, and Nami who I appreciated for being Nami not looks like a random slut. Fucking hate it. Oh well, at least Franky got a badass Robot.</br></br></br>  <br>Aw, how cute. <br>I hate shitposters like you too.  ;^) </br></br>  So Urouge met Enel right?  <br>Was Arlong Park the last time Nami had a proper clothes?</br>  <br>Enel is probably still on the moon. If he were to come back though, I see him going down to the blue sea.<br><br>Perhaps this is how he's reintroduced through. I just can't see him being "rational" and wanting to meet someone in such a way.</br></br></br>  <br>It's this guy.</br>  <br>What makes you think he's wanting to meet someone?<br>They said somebody's here not somebody wants to meet you</br></br>  <br>I don't remember having problems with her until post-time skip, but now that I think about it she was probably wearing a bra after most of Arlong yeah. What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service?? I assure you, Nami's breasts aren't what I'm fucking watching it for.</br>  <br>Oh right, I must have read it with someone being there to see them.</br>  <br> google image search <br> Nami water 7 <br> Nami enies lobby <br> Nami sabaody <br> all have shirts on </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>interesting idea<br>proof?</br></br>  <br>Probably stems from the fact he has wings and is likely from the sky islands (or has some angel zoan).</br>  <br>Blackbeard's crew is after pirates for their powers and Lafitte has shown to have the ability to fly.<br>Urouge in particular has a power to convert damage into power. Since he's a Skypeian, Lafitte is the only one able to track him reliably.</br></br>  <br> is likely from the sky islands <br><br>Wasnt he a cop in some blue? And those wings dont look like those stubby little things sky islanders have on their back, even the ones on the moon hieroglyphs in the cover story had different wings.<br>It has to be a DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br> All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar. <br><br> he's after Ceasar on his own <br> doesn't work for Mam at all <br> wants to make a killing on the black market with Ceasar's drugs and other shit <br> Capone has gone full Broker during the timeskip <br> Wants to be the kingpin of the underworld, harking back to his namesake <br><br>Holy fucking shit please god yes.<br>I believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Luffy has been in the New World for 3 FUCKING DAYS and he already captured the second most famous scientist in the world, defeated a Shichibukai an one of the most influential person in the New World, formed alliance with countless rookies and managed to piss off the whole fucking world<br><br>Why haven't you accepted Luffy as your lord and saviour</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Lafitte already has a devil fruit and it's Rosinante's. He was able to enter a room with VA's and Shichibukai's without any of them noticing after all.</br>  <br>Just because he lived there doesn't mean he's from there.</br>  <br>Luffy becoming Pirate King in two weeks confirmed.</br>  <br>Not sure, seems like Oda has something in store for him though.<br><br>What worries me more now is Bonney.<br>She's stealing food in the street like a homeless person...she's still pirate right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, pirates do steal shit.</br>  Spoilers out:<br><br>・グラントリノ事務所――職場体験3日目 PM5:00。 <br><br>・ボロボロでひっくり返っているイズク

Shigaraki's quirk is disintegration, he can completely destroy whatever he holds with his own hands (the special U.A. gate that kept out the press, Aizawa's elbow, Stain's knife) <br><br>He protected that hand because he called it 'father' before. That hand means a lot to him. It doesn't have a special quirk of its own: a dead hand can't have a quirk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been following Berserk and HxH for years now, I suffered already but I'm not imune to it yet.</br>  <br>So thats why he's a villain in the same vein of Bakugou, poor motherfuckers cant masturbate.</br>  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>251</wbr>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>Finally.</br></br>  <br>THE 5 MINUTES ARE OVER<br><br>FINALLY</br></br></br>  <br> IIDA LIVES YES.  </br>  <br>Good, man.</br>  <br>Is it too late at night to summon Translatorfag?</br>  <br>We don't know that anon. The hands on his face + the hands all over his body might still hold quirks, we still haven't been informed.<br><br>If the author really does intend to make Facepalm the anti thesis to Deku, then it wouldn't be strange for him to somehow have multiple quirks (in the form of hands).</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Iida's saying some epic shit.<br>What do you think GT and Deku are talking about in the beginning ?</br></br>  <br>Deko has no Quirk<br>Hands has many quriks.<br>its the opposite</br></br></br>  <br/>  Begin the SUMMONING!  <br><br>SPIRAL STAIRCASE</br></br>  <br>To me those hands seem more like an unwillingness to let things go than anything else. <br><br>The way they are positioned on his body gives me this sensation as well. If you look clearly, you can see that they're all positioned in a way that would restrain a person (around his neck, under his arms like how you would lift a toddler, on his arms etc.) <br><br>If they still contain their quirks and they would work in the way you said, it'll need a lot of explanation. To me personally it sounds like nonsense, but we can only wait and see. (Besides, if he had to use multiple quirks at the same time, I reckon he'd become brainless just like Noumu, the body can't take that many quirks and still function perfectly)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Premum vos Translator</br>  <br>People were really expecting him to die ?</br>  <br><br>Maybe to use the quirks he literally has to swap hands?</br></br>  <br><br>Well he will still probably turn to villain, violent vigilante or get crippled, since Deku said that one line in hindsight.</br></br>  <br>The one on his face is the one whose quirk he's using.</br>  <br>He will probably lead to the death of someone else, get expulsed and then go vigilante I think.</br>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>thank you</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127868652 <br>No need to be rude, it was obvious he was going to live even with the pic above, maybe the guys was just excited or something.</br>  <br> replying to shitposters </br>  <br>I forgot what website I was on for a moment sorry.</br>  <br>Looks like Deku is going to fight some Noumu Rip offs.

Maybe Kurumi will have a new item depending on which club the episode is about (Shovel for the Gardening Club, Baseball Bat for the Baseball club etc).<br><br>Anyways, what did you think of episode 1?</br></br>  Is the manga worth reading?  They weren't that helpful in the gardening club though.<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/temxsehvxg.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  SHOVEL BEST GIRL    <br> Multiple thread reach post limit <br>So /a/ like it ?<br>How about 2ch ?</br></br></br>  GARTER BEST GIRL  <br>Shovel my waifu!<br><br><br>I can only say, the suffering will be no where near as good in the anime as it was in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't see it coming.<br>Saw the barricade, saw the grave, thought it was odd, but didn't see it coming.<br> please tell me the dog survives. Taroumaru ;_; </br></br></br>    <br> I suppose. I mean, we know it works, just not how long it works, otherwise that guy wouldn't be flying the helicopter in the first place. <br><br> This is a different script. In the manga, he dies very quickly (was found bitten). He'll probably live, at least for a few episodes. </br></br></br>  <br>Do we have any word of how closely this will follow the manga? How close was the first ep, mangafags?</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck that shovel.</br></br>  <br>It was completely different.</br>  <br>It was VERY different, and in a good way too.</br>  <br>Oh shit where was the grave?</br>  <br>I want to cut her legs off at the knees.</br>  <br>On the rooftop in the garden   Its Megu-nees grave  </br>  <br>In terms of plotting, it was basically the first chapter but stretched out. However, there's two characters already here who aren't introduced until later on in the manga. <br><br>These aren't bad changes though, and the manga author is in the staff.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. After Yuki and glasses-chan leave the roof, Kurumi goes to rest on the railing, there's a small grave behind her in the "crops"<br> I'm guess Yuki sees the graves as crops and Kurumi and rumble-chan were burying bodies? </br></br>  Who would off shovel when she finally joined the zombie ranks?    <br>Yuki.</br>  <br><br>No, those are actual gardens. They need to get food somehow.<br><br>The grave is as  said.</br></br></br></br>  I need to stop revealing spoilers expecting something lewd instead of actual spoilers.  So what's the different between green and blue uniform?<br><br>Yuki and her classmates got blue while other three got green.</br></br>    Miki rescue confirmed.  <br>That would be hilarious. Even more so if Yuki somehow found herself trapped with Shovel as she's about to turn.<br><br>Just imagine Yuki seeing her friend about to slowly walk up to her and eat her, battling her delusions between accepting that it's just her friend and there's nothing wrong and forcing herself to protect herself from being eaten.<br><br>That would be hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As so far, no one has any idea why Yuki has a different color uniform.</br>  <br>  keeping a corpse this close to your food supply <br>And this is why  Yuki is delusional </br></br>  <br>Must. Not. Open.</br>  Why did they change the beginning? Are they really going to have enough episodes to cover whats happened in the manga?  <br> keeping a corpse this close to your food supply <br>No corpse in there buddy.<br>I wonder where it is.</br></br></br>  <br>But no one is buried there.</br>  <br>Maybe they're simply different grade?<br><br><br>Vegetables need nutrients you know.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br> grave with no body <br>What, did they  just make a grave for her without actually killing her? WAIT, does that mean that when yuki saw mega-nee, she walked right by her zombie? How many other zombies did Yuki just fucking walk right by without getting bitten? </br></br></br>  fashion-chan zombie death when  <br> Maybe they're simply different grade? <br><br>Of course not.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck her  lifeless body </br>  <br> Maybe they're simply different grade? <br>Nope yuki, Shovel and crazy are all third years. The only one in a different grade is Mii-kun who is a second year.<br><br>There is NO explanation for Yukis clothes.<br><br><br> WAIT, does that mean that when yuki saw mega-nee <br>Megu-nee is on basement duty.<br>hint hint.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She didn't walk past any zombies, they're all behind the barricades/outside. </br>  <br><br>Kill yourself, retard.</br></br>  Alright, you win, /a/.<br>I'm normally an anime-only fag, but after Sidonia no Kishi ended i had to read the manga to catch up because I needed my fix.<br>I might as well start reading this and Shingeki no Kyoujin too, while I'm at it.</br></br>  <br> Just a reminder she's not actually in it, though. The grave was there before Kurumi was bitten. We don't actually ever see them bury her body there, either, though we do see them praying at it after they kill zombie Megu-nee. I'm not sure there's even enough dirt there to bury someone. I think they just put Megu-nee's cross necklace on it instead of actually taking her up there to bury her. </br>  <br>As far as introducing the character early, I think it's a fairly good idea. I'm not a fan of shows that introduce a new main late in the season, only to finish a few episodes later and  no S2 .<br><br>And yeah, it is said they plan to close the anime at the graduation. I think they can pull it off pretty comfortably.</br></br></br>  <br>Whoops, saw that someone else already said that. That's what I get for trying to do 3/4 things at once.</br>  I remember reading a bit of this when the manga was first getting translated. I couldn't keep up with it. I just couldn't handle it.<br><br>I'm going to try again this weekend.</br></br>   *1,073位/***,978位 (---,--- pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/09/26 【Amazon.co.jp限定】がっこうぐらし!第1巻 (全巻購入特典:「描きおろし全巻収納BOX」引換シリアルコード付)(初<wbr>回限定版)[Blu-ray]</wbr> <br><br>Shit sales incoming.</br></br>  <br>Amount of fucks given: 0</br>   Thought how they they handled Megu-nee was really good; was really great how they subtly hinted she wasn't there by how the rest of cast responded when she "spoke".   <br>Sure thing, if you don't want a second season.</br>  <br>I blame the fucking dog</br>  <br><br>The only thing that really matters here is the manga boost, assuming Gurashi vol. 1 doesn't sell at an Etotama level.</br></br>   Okay I'm going to write this sroty about a group of people living in a school in a post-zombieapocalyptic world <br> And I'm going to make the art as cute as humanly possible <br>Is there any reason behind this other than fuck you?</br></br>  <br>This. It ate up way too much time and made the first 2/3rds really hard to watch. First impressions are everything and I was ready to drop despite already knowing the twist.</br>  <br>There never was going to be a second season.</br>  Is the pink haired teacher still alive or just an illusion? It looked like the other girls were able to hear what she said when I rewatched the episode.  <br> Etotama level <br>Don't remind me.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the popularity of the anime more or less reflects the amount of boost as well.</br>  <br> Is there any reason behind this other than fuck you? <br>To amp up the terror and emotion when shit hits the fan.</br></br>  <br>It makes good contrast<br> So yes, a big fuck you </br></br>  <br>Fuck the dog!<br>I hate that little shit.</br></br>  <br>I noticed that, too. The others patiently waited for her to stop talking before they started to talk, but I think that's just a Lerche goof.</br>  <br>Pilot episode sales doesn't mean much really. I'd rather wait till episode 3-4 to see the numbers start rolling or go flat.</br>  So Yuki's failure to adapt to reality is going to get them all killed huh<br><br>The final chapter has got to be the whole school is on fire and Yuki is in the auditorium surrounded by zombies and in her fantasy it is Graduation Day and all her friends and family are their to celebrate</br></br>  <br>Gotta admit, it was a bit too much from him.</br>  <br>Maybe it's a special item, like, one of those stat boosting items which makes her's different from everyone else.<br> But it helps induce delusions. <br><br><br>Did you watch YuYuYu?<br>Because the answer should be obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd be impressed if she she knew English well enough to have even relatively grammatical hallucinations.</br></br>  <br>They left the school a long time ago.<br>And Yuki is pretty much the only sane at this point in the manga.</br></br>  <br>I remember this from YuYuYu, and Itsuki being ana amazing singer.</br>  <br> 8/10 would watch <br> But no. Later, Yuki goes  full battle mode  </br></br>  <br>Yeah, this isn't the kind of show where people will buy based off episode 1. It's definitely perked a lot of interest (), but people are understandably wanting to see where it goes.<br><br>It's a tired example, but it's worth mentioning that Girls und Panzer languished in the 600s until episode 3-4. Ended up selling 30k something.</br></br></br>  <br> And Yuki is pretty much the only sane at this point in the manga. <br>That's honestly an achievement.</br></br>  I just read c33 and I'm kind of confused.  Is this the reason why she wasn't aggroing the zombies while walking past them like 4 pages prior?   <br>contrast. shock value. fuck you. madoka of survival zombie animu. maybe becoming an internet meme while at it?</br>  <br>Because cute and cuddly things that have something very wrong with them is far scarier than any eldritch abomination.</br>  <br> Yuki is pretty much the only sane at this point in the manga <br><br>It seems that WEG image didn't lie then huh. Man I really wanna just read the manga now.</br></br></br>  <br>But does she smile?</br>  <br>In latest translated chapters  Yuki seems to have recovered from delusions and fakes it for the sake of others. <br><br><br>Actually possible anime original end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>YYY was a completely different kind of bullshit, though. Here's this edgy author who promises everything will be daijoubu but guess what! It isn't! Oh wait, in the end it actually is! GG is full WELL SHIT from the start, apparently.<br>On the other hand, I can't really complain, it's my job as a fan of cute girls to look at them no matter what kind of situation they're in. And I'd rather have these qts than something uncute anyway.</br></br>  These are science zombies, not magic ones right? I mean, the idea of zombies (at least if they're really dead and not being controlled by a parasite) is impossible anyway, but there is usually a difference.<br><br>The weird thing is, if the dog apparently turns, doesn't that mean the infection of whatever can effect different species? Well, the idea is absurd to begin with, but that sort of thing still triggers my autism.</br></br>  Reminder that everything is okay, they're just really chuuni.  <br>science, by all indication</br>  <br>Its because she's   Half zombie  <br><br><br>You should, the anime could never do justice to the emotions in the manga.<br><br><br>Randal corp, zombie making bastards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't one of the girls die in the VN of YYY? So if you view it as a unified work, the ending isn't completely happy.</br></br>  <br>Science, I'd say<br>Also, the infection can target mammals. Birds unaffected</br></br>  <br>Also<br> effect different species? <br>We've been told that only mammals can get infected.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be hilarious if Yuki is alone, talking to herself alone, everyone dead but still alive in her delusions.<br><br>Ah shit, I just thought of something insane.<br>What if  when Shovel dies, she also becomes part of the delusions Yuki sees just like how she sees Megu? <br> That way, Shovel will still be a part of the team! <br><br><br>Yeah, the ending of YYY was bullshit and should have ended in everyone dying or floating around in space forever.<br><br>I meant that YYY shows you cute SoL and then fucks you with despair.<br><br><br> recovered <br>I personally don't buy that she's fully recovered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's like a Sanka Rea zombie now.</br></br>  <br>just started reading it on kissmanga after watching the first episode.<br>It feels a lot darker than the anime did already.<br><br>Question though, mangafags,  Where is dog and mii-kun? Someone said earlier they find the dog bitten already, but where's Mii-kun? Is she surviving somewhere else in the school somehow? </br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't just use Chuuni to explain everything dammit.</br>  <br>They find Miki later<br>And the dog is just a flashback bit</br></br>  <br>Mii-kun is introduced when the girls go on a shopping trip, she was hiding in a room at the mall.</br>  Looks like they had one hell of a fiesta.  <br>It was  to die for. </br>  <br>Someone spilled a truck's worth of salsa</br>  <br>It was pretty  crazy. </br>  What if Yuki is actually the sane one and everyone else is crazy running around murdering people?  <br>Anon that's blood from their dead classmates that they had to slaughter since they turned into flesh eating zombies.<br><br>I doubt it was any fun at all.</br></br></br>  so who's ready for  wesker shovel?   Wow, they actually adapted this? That was fast. How long has it been out as a manga? It felt like just last year I read the first few chapters on /a/    <br>Then she wouldn't still see Megu-nee</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Its been out for around two and a bit years.<br>The first chapter was translated two years ago.</br></br>  <br> complete<br> global<br>moeturation</br> </br> </br>  <br>Damn. I know I'm getting old when time flies by that quickly for me. Thanks, anon</br>  <br>That would be fucked up. You're fucked up.</br>   reading the manga <br>Jesus christ.<br> So it's pretty obvious from the get-go that Megu-nee isn't there, the way Rii and Kurumi talk over here and only notice she's there when Yuki starts talking to her. And yet, Rii and Kurumi play along and pretend she's there to keep Yuki's fragile sanity in tact. They even started all this club shit just to help her cope, and all the "club rules" are their survival rules. This is some grim fucking shit. I'm loving this. </br></br>  <br>It gets even  better </br>   the show actually is about healing <br> but healing deals damage to zombies </br>  <br>Anon that's silly.<br>You're silly.</br></br>  <br>I should really stop ignoring threads from franchises I don't know of. Wish I could have gotten into it sooner.</br>  <br>One Page Threads, man. That's how I first learned about this manga.</br>  <br>I am not understanding the 'healing' part of this anime</br>  <br>Cute girls doing cute things and nothing happens is definition of healing.</br>  <br>I've been in these threads from the get go and let me say, you missed nothing. We had usually a thread a month which were usually only chapter dumps, the only time we ever had good threads was when something "happened" in the manga, and then the next day no one cared about it again.</br>  <br>Basically feels good stuff.</br>  <br>We all know the nips have shit taste, anon.</br>  What's wrong with Mii-kun?  <br>Fear of being the only rational person left.</br>  <br>She's the only normie left in the group.</br>  <br>After that ending, I dont see hope for any healing.</br>  <br>It has to hurt you before it can heal you.<br><br>It's the best kind of healing, it just makes the threads annoying to follow when they're full of people who assume that the current arc's problems will just never get resolved.</br></br></br>  <br> it's a healing show where the healing doesn't heal </br>  <br>That's how a lot of manga threads on /a/ work. Then the anime comes out, a lot of people start talking about it a lot more often, and then the anime ends and all discussion stops entirely.</br>  <br>Hahaha<br><br> Hahahahaha </br></br></br>  Holy shit, didnt see that coming. I saw that text on the board in the class but I thought they just had english class or something. I kinda knew something was off from the tags, and also the barricade, but holy shit.  <br>Daijoubu!</br>  <br>Rawr!</br>  <br>She's wondering why she was introduced way too early.</br>  Do the girls ever "comfort" each other, if you know what I mean?  <br>The grave in the garden was off putting too. But there are other subtle hints that I missed most likely.</br>  Why? Why is there no fanart?  <br>Why does that keep happening though?<br>It's fucking annoying and sad.</br></br>  <br>Its all Diejoubu<br><br><br>I want to shovel Shovels trench if you know what i mean.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The only other thing I noticed before the reveal, having read part of the manga and knowing what to expect, were a couple of shots where the windows in the background were cracked.</br></br>  <br> the dog is only in the manga for a chapter or two. He is somewhat important showing the that the girls can't really kill anything that is close to them, thus resulting to Shovel chan almost dying </br>  <br> we didn't have casualties, so it's all good <br> I'm a casualty  <br>Oh my god. This fucking bullshit.<br>I just fucking noticed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes; Yuki comforts her friends a lot. She even  unchained Yuki from the couch and slept with her. <br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br>  Which Gurashi would you repopulate the earth with?  <br> tfw I'll never nibble on Shovels thigh <br><br><br>Shovel!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shovel.</br>  <br><br>Good luck having her  last 9 months </br></br>  <br>Statistically speaking 4 girls aren't enough genetic diversity. Humanity would be on life support, and there's nothing you could do about it.</br>  <br>Garter. The only sane one.</br>  <br>Garters.</br>  <br>All of them <br>It won't be easy, but it's something I have to do</br></br>  <br>I'll make those nine months the greatest she'd ever had.</br>  <br>You just have to make sure every second counts.<br>Hell, she's basically disposable goods at that point anyways.</br></br>  <br> the greatest she'd ever had. <br>Or her worst.</br></br>  <br><br> dead people having functioning wombs </br></br>  <br>Maybe they killed her too and shes a vengeful spirit only Yuki can see because shes giving everyone else the cold shoulder for killing her.</br>  Since people seem to theorize that shovel is half zombie, have they taken more of the medicine with them after they left school, I forgot.<br><br><br>The only sane one  Rii </br></br></br>  <br> she's basically disposable goods at that point anyways. <br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel. I am trained in shovel warfare and I’m the top shovel wielder in the entire US armed forces.<br><br><br>I guess so, having to separate from me would be awful for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TWELVE KIDS</br>  <br>#2 GO AWAY.</br>  <br>I'm not going to impregnate her. Who would impregnate a dead person?<br>Just keep using the serum on her as long and as much as possible. Since she's already dead, you have to make the most use out of her while she's still fresh.<br><br>And all you would have to do is convince her that she's going to be eventually a threat to everyone around her and that it's better if you chained her up. Preferably next to your bedside so that you can keep her very closely under observation.<br><br>And having sex with her would, probably, keep her warm, thus putting her further from turning into a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they took the three syringes with them but I'm really not sure. We also didnt see specifically what supplies they packed into the car so that could another possibility. Regardless I feel like theres a good posibility she'll either change fully at an inconvient time so to completely avoid this.</br>  <br>Shovel's descendants will inherit her superhuman abilities and retake the planet.</br>  <br>I see you feel threatened by my presence.</br>   mfw I downloaded this off Nyaa without knowing anything about it <br>Was the reveal in the manga better than the anime?</br>  <br>Yes, but the buildup to the reveal was better done in the anime which has a lot of good foreshadowing.</br>  <br>The anime kind of dragged it on way more than the manga but it turns out for the better.<br><br>Miki being there is weird though.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a bit different from the original source which makes me feel looking forward to the next episodes.</br>  <br>Of course not, #2s are and all ways will be #2s.</br>  <br>I liked it in the manga more. We didn't have some other character to show it to us, instead it was just all of a sudden, we saw the world for how it was.<br><br>That said, the anime did a better job of foreshadowing the reveal than the manga, but that had more to do with the fact that it was 30 minutes instead of 30 pages.</br></br></br>  <br>I did the same and found the reveal to be pretty well done, there was enough to make you know there was obviously something wrong but not enough that showing you exactly what that was wasn't a surprise.</br>  <br> 30 minutes <br>Were you watching an extended version?<br>Where did you get it?</br></br></br>  <br>Definitely prefer the anime reveal. Mangafags cant admit it.</br>  Mi-kun &gt; Kurumi &gt; Yuki &gt; Zombie#231 &gt; Megu-nee's car &gt; Rii-san    Mangafags cant admit it. <br>Only over half of us have been saying we like the anime reveal better. <br><br>Stop pulling shit out of your ass.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I just rounded both of the numbers up. Manga chapter was like 27 pages if memory serves, and that might have included the scanlation credits page.</br>  <br> actually being genuinely surprised by the tweest by being completely oblivious about the series <br>I envy you.</br></br>  <br>The sudden shock twist was better in the manga but the lead up to it was better done in the anime.<br>I'm pretty sure everyone can agree on that point.</br></br>  What the fuck is the deal with Mi-kun being with the group from day one? Would the episode really have lost much if it was Kurumi doing the escorting?  <br>It's just, like, my opinion, man. I think the lack of another character's perspective on the scene in the manga shows that it's really more of a coping mechanism than a delusional break, and that Yuki knows it isn't real. In the anime it felt more like we were just shifting from Yuki's view of the world to Miki's.</br>  <br>There's probably going to be a flashback episode.</br>  <br> Apparently in the latest chapter Rii and Yuki's mental status literally swapped <br> Now Rii has her very own "megu-nee </br></br>  <br>I noticed the grave and the barricade as well as a shot where the windows looked broken, They did a good job of foreshadowing while not making it too obvious.</br>  <br>In the manga, she isn't escorted at all, nor does she stand there and talk to the 3 people. Otherwise, it basically happened the exact same way.<br><br><br>Wouldn't the lack of another's perspective make it the other way around? She doesn't have anyone to pretend to in the manga in that scene, yet she still sees the delusion.</br></br></br></br>   this translator   Do we know how much of the manga they're going to adapt?  <br>All of it!</br>  <br> In the manga, she isn't escorted at all, nor does she stand there and talk to the 3 people. Otherwise, it basically happened the exact same way. <br>Yeah I know that fucker, I've read the manga. Obviously they made some changes. I just don't know why they couldn't stay faithful to Miki's arc in the manga and have Kurumi do everything Miki did this episode.</br></br>  <br> fashion-chan <br> you mean whore-chan, right?</br></br>  <br>She's not pretending for anyone's sake but her own.</br>  <br>It does help everyone else though.</br>  Nothing will happen to the best grill, right? ;_;  <br> She dies. </br>  <br> She dies </br>  <br><br> She half-dies </br></br>  <br><br><br><br> not enjoying this little ball of innocence warming your cold hearts  <br>It's like you're already dead inside.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be pretty foolish to kill off their only twin-tailed girl.</br>  <br><br><br><br> She goes cold </br></br></br></br>  I read the whole manga in one go over the last few hours<br><br>Why was Miki in the show at the start? Whys the show look so bad? How bad of an adaptation is this anime aiming to be?</br></br>  <br> you're already dead <br>Why do you think we like this manga and are attracted to the girls?</br></br>   How did Rii-san found her sister? I find the recent chapter plain hard to believe.<br/>   <br>Oh shit, is that loli really not real?</br>  <br><br>Recall the part where  Yuki leaves the bear inside the school </br></br>  <br>The adaptation is great. Copying 100% of the original source would make it boring.</br>  <br> It's not her sister, she's going crazy and thinks a teddy bear is her sister. </br>  <br> look so bad <br>How does it look bad? The animation was serviceable.</br></br>  <br>That's not an excuse, even the deadest of the dead  like Shovel  accepted him into their hearts. Step it up, zombie-senpai.</br>  <br>What does that have to do with anything?</br>  <br> That's not an excuse <br>Sure it is, we also want to eat the girls.  Lewdly. </br></br>  <br>Look at her clothes</br>  <br> Whys the show look so bad? <br>Is this your first time watching an anime adaption from a well drawn manga?</br></br>  <br>oh shit</br>  <br>My waifu is half dead, I've been dead inside for a long time.</br>  <br>Like eating their severed legs while making odd groan noises?</br>  <br>So does that mean you'll follow her the whole way once the time comes?</br>  Why did you open the  Catbox  that is the school /a/?  Everybody say!<br>Everybody say!<br> That marketing.. holy shit i dont want to know how many anons have been fooled </br></br>  Would you guys let shovel give you a blowjob in her cold half-zombie mouth? Would you be willing to take that risk?  <br>No I'll live the life shen didn't get to.<br>She those who kill themselves are cowards.<br>I'll be strong for her.</br></br></br>   &gt;mfw the Dog is only in like two pages in the manga <br> I was really afraid it would be all cute and adorable and win my heart and die miserably, but at least this way I'm not attached. Fucking weird how Taromaru is in the anime from day one with Miki, but Taromaru was dead long before Miki was even picked up, what the hell. </br>  <br>GOD FUCKING DAMN IT WHY DID I HOVER OVER THE SPOILER I SHOULDVE KNOWN BETTER FUCK FUCK FUCK</br>  <br>More like ticking them before eating their stomach.<br><br><br>We wanted to know if the  dog  was still alive.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be willing anyday.<br>Im sure her cold mouth feels great.</br></br>  this thread has so many spoilers it looks like porn on television fuck  <br>Read the manga. That becomes obvious after about 3 chapters. If the anime stays anywhere near close to the manga on that, it'll be obvious after about two or three more episodes.</br>  <br>Imagine it on a hot summers day.</br>  <br>They must have gotten scarred for life.</br>  <br>Wait, does that mean that you might have wished unconsciously for her to get bitten and die for good too so that you aren't alone anymore in your bleak existence of feeling nothing?</br>  <br>Putting meat in her mouth is just training her to accept her fate.<br><br><br> I'll be strong for her. <br>Unfortunately, I don't think your waifu will be strong enough for you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I picked up the manga after the first episode because I am a filthy secondary, and woah they sure changed a lot from the source material huh? But I like it, it's really good pacing to be honest. How do you feel about it you guys?</br>  <br>There were  4  chairs in the club room.<br>Only  Yuki  was talking to  Megu-nee. </br></br>  <br> wanting her to get bitten <br>I wanted nothing but to see her with a large beautiful smile. ;_;<br><br><br>It'd be a nice refreshing feeling.<br><br><br>She can do it, i know she can!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in the manga <br> Rii makes lunch <br> sets out   4  plates<br> mfw  <br> Watching them play along with Yuki's delusional insanity is heartbreaking </br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that shovelfags are into necrophilia.  <br>I wonder how long the dog is going to last in the anime. Also, how long are they going to hide the secret of the teacher from animeonlys?</br>  <br>Not only that, look at <br> She blatantly and openly admitted that she's dead. <br>Like, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I like both.</br>  <br>this anime sucks, watched the first 10 minutes and dropped it YAWWWWWWN typical moe anime</br>  Actual spoilers ahead. Click image and spoiler text at your own risk, anime-onlyfriends<br><br>WAITWAITWAIT<br>WHAT?!<br> WAS THIS ZOMBIE VIRUS PLANNED?

Could there have been a translation error? Maybe it's more subtle in Japanese.</br>  <br>I have high hope in her as well, waifu fag.</br>  I saw the desk barricade and knew something was up. I've never had that feeling before, like an uncanny atmosphere. I thought it was fucking great.  <br> She can do it, i know she can! <br>I'll cheer her on for you!<br><br> Fight-oh Shovel~ <br> You can do it, yeah! <br><br><br>I don't think so. I personally didn't pick up on it until it was posted here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MIND = BLOWN</br>  <br> not wanting a half conscious zombie waifu who mixes her desire for flesh with her desire to be with you <br> not wanting to place a ballgag in her mouth so she can sleep with you at night <br> not letting her lust overtake her and change from enthusiastic and violent spooning to extremely weird zombie sex </br></br></br>  <br>And, hey, the more you use her, the warmer she'll stay.<br>It's like fire, you just have to blow on the ember to keep the fire up.</br></br>  <br>Im willing to be if its for her!<br><br><br>As you should!

What the actual fuck, man. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think about what you just wrote, what do you think is the reason for him to be more prominent this time? <br>Yes, feel those eyes staring deep into your soul. Can you already imagine how you huddle close together with him and your favorite gurashi in your sleeping bags trying your hardest to ignore the groaning of all the zombies outside? How feeding him and seeing his happy wagging tail every day has become one of the few normal constants in your new lifes that lets you at least temporarily forget how bleak everything is? <br>He will be cute and adorable and they will make you enjoy every minute of it till he takes his last shaky zombie dog breath.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally why I'm not going to watch the anime.<br>I'm a huge animal lover, dogs especially. Whenever a dog dies in something I'm watching, I instinctively go grab my pooch and cuddle with her for a minute or two, then carry her up into my room and let her sleep on my bed while I finish whatever I was watching.<br><br>I want to be a vet when I grow up, but seeing animals suffering would kill me, man.</br></br></br></br>  Do you think they'll change the OP now that the gig is up?  <br>Fag.</br>  <br> &gt;my waifu died<br> she struggled to safe them while turning <br> almost kills Shovel <br/></br></br> <br>When this comes in the Anime.. i can't handle it anymore</br></br>  <br> I want to be a vet when I grow up <br> when I grow up <br> grow up </br></br></br>  <br>It would be hilarious if the anime ends on a original ending where everyone dies.</br>  <br> that'sthejoke.jpg </br>  <br>   original ending </br>  <br> when I grow up </br>  About 24 hours have passed and I still can't get over this smile.  <br> he didn't read Sidonia from the start <br> he watched that cancer-cg-shit <br>Get the fuck back to reddit.</br></br></br>  <br>My waifu is beautiful, isnt she.</br>  <br>I don't see it but meh.</br>  <br> I want to be a vet when I grow up <br> when I grow up <br>I'm really feeling conflicted now.

Now sit back and enjoy it.</br>    <br>Not necessarily.<br>Sometimes living on is harder than sweet death.</br></br>  Shovelfags please go watch Sankarea and never come back.   that Miki development <br>You know, she was a cunt at first, but she's growing on me.<br><br>So far, <br>Kurumi &gt;Megu-nee  in the middle of turning  &gt; Miki &gt; Rii &gt; Megu-nee &gt; Yuki</br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched it ages ago, it was good i liked it.<br>But im fine here, i like these threads.</br></br>  <br>That was just sick.</br>  Post cool shovels.<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b6<wbr>0OZhrTB6o</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>   yfw everything. will not be alright   <br> everyone <br> implying Yuki won't be standing till the end  <br>Heathen.</br></br></br>  <br>Not for long.</br>  <br>She's especially beautiful when  she's holding Taroumaru more closely than she'll ever hold you. </br>  It was garbage I hope you guys are kidding.  I've just rushed through the manga and  is Yuki still delusional or is she just pretending to be to keep the group together so that no loses their shit? <br><br> I mean she became a lot more reliable with her surroundings ever since the helicopter crash but I'm still confused if she's actually delusional or not, or half-delusional? </br></br>  <br>Just wait until it's gone, together with her optimism.</br>  <br>Thats just rude.<br>;_;</br></br>  <br> everyone dies but Yuki <br> she still acts as if no one has died because   they're not all part of her delusion like megu <br>Truly the perfect ending.</br></br></br>  Is there a good scan of this?  <br>Recall that Rii  asked Yuki if it was alright with Megu-nee to swap cars  and Yuki  looked at her like she was crazy  but played along  </br>  Most promising show of the season so far<br><br>...it's going to completely fall apart in 3-4 episodes, isn't it..?</br></br>  <br>Why can't they stay pure?</br>  <br> <br> she never was delusional <br> she just pretended to keep the group together <br/></br></br> <br>But is still don't understand  what megu-nee meant with the sin she committed to yuki.

You should be happy, too!</br>  <br>Because they wanted you to fall for it, and you did.</br>  <br>I'd be her flesh</br>   I find it hard to believe one can hold consciousness while you slowly become a full-fledged zombie. <br><br>I say it's a convenient tool created by the author to progress the story.</br></br>   <br>Are you telling me this isn't the face of true happiness?</br>  <br>I dunno, i think it makes sense.<br>Like, when you get sick or drunk, and your brain slowly goes fuzzy and it becomes harder and harder to think, yeah?<br> It's like that, only with hunger for flesh, and eventually Megu-nee just completely loses her consciousness to the hunger </br></br></br>  How the hell are they going to explain the imouto surviving by herself all that time?  <br>Unlikely, all of the big emotional scenes are based around the upbeats in mood.</br>  <br>You sound like an expert on this topic. Do you work for XEDRA or what?</br>   Reading the standard.   <br> That's not her sister, it's the teddy bear Yuki had at the start of the chapter.

And only then do you become an actual zombie.<br>It's not a slow process into becoming a zombie but a process to the point of death where you turn into a zombie.<br><br><br> awww, isn't it cute how she's always holding onto that bear-I mean-Imouto <br> isn't it cute how she's always sleeping with her imouto <br> isn't it cute how she's calling that bear her imouto <br><br>Also, now that I think about it, Rii asked if Yuki heard anything in the school but she said no.<br> Only Rii heard it because she's delusional. <br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those eyes give me the chills.

This didn’t exactly sell much to start with (2,142 wk1) but wooooooow, this is an absolute collapse. Down 65.5%. What sales v1 got were clearly from the included visual novel, as I’m not seeing mention of an event ticket. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if Nisekoi had a huge documented yurifag following.</br>  <br> 9,254 Show by Rock!! <br> 8,589 Hibike!

Male fans who, traditionally, are the ones who buy disks.</br>  <br>Not all event tickets cause boosts.

It's probably not that much in the first place since it's only diehard KyoAni fans buying from there.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK And I thought Japan will like it!</br>  <br>Fuck you m8 FMP shits on Hibike any day of the week</br>  <br>part 1 sold 12k, egypt will probably make 8-10k. It'll be enough for Part 4. Just keep waiting.</br>  <br>The manga sell much better now, so there's no problem. Like most other shoujo or LN adaptation out there.<br><br>Really what the fuck with this assumption of anime = everything?</br></br></br>  <br>big fucking deal. How new are you? Madhouse anime never sell unless they exclusively pander to otaku with trash like NGNL and Mahouka. Otherwise they adapt good manga which boost manga sales, get good TV ratings, and get high grossing live action adaptations.</br>  <br>No, Kyoani doesn't have high budgets, the quality comes from their proper scheduling and highly motivated staff (they don't use freelancers)</br>  <br>KyoAni shop done goof with Hibike<br> shit extra <br> limited release <br> pre-order only <br>I'd be surprised if they sold more than 1k copies at the shop</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We're not sure, probably a scheduling fuck up. Though episode 12 is now confirmed to be over 30 minutes so maybe the staff changed the ending last minute?</br>  <br> KyoAni don't use freelancers and pay their employees well <br> but they don't have high budget! </br></br>  <br>It's garbage, it's only normal that It' would sell like shit.</br>  <br>Such a flop that the 4k Tamako and 4k KnK got film sequels amirite?</br>  <br>Nice trolling and shitposting, idiot.</br>  <br>Good scheduling can save a budget. If things get into a crunch the staff has to throw cash at hundreds of freelancers just to get the episodes out. Compare the number of key animators for a normal Kyoani episode to a show with well known shit scheduling like Shingeki. One episode had well over 50 key animators.</br>  <br> and highly motivated staff <br>How do you know?<br>Have you ever talked to any of them?</br></br></br>  <br>Every thread.<br><br>I'm surprised someone hasn't made a bingo chart for stock phrases that appears in these threads.

I find the characters in Kekkai moe.<br><br><br> Hibike wasn't a moe show <br>It did have some moe characters though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing gay about that culture.</br>  <br>True, Kyoani was only ever good when they stole a franchise from Gonzo.</br>  <br>Those are just the BDs, I'm talking about BD+DVD</br>  <br> Hibike wasn't a moe show <br>That's debatable.<br> nor did it target male otaku <br>This is pure nonsense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It did have some, yes, but ultimately it was more gloomy and serious, not really something i'd watch if I were up for some "moe".<br>I also salute you for knowing moe is not some genre, and not the "moeshit" genre.</br></br>  <br> You don't either <br>I can agree with that, but it's doesn't change the fact that you are stupid pest.</br></br>  <br> Hibike music CDs are sold out EVERYWHERE, <br><br>Guess what? Your shitty CDs combined won't even beat Kekkai Sensen OP which sold 200k+</br></br></br>  <br> Hibike wasn't a moe show, nor did it target male otaku. <br><br><br>Cute highschool girls doing cute shit is pretty moe i think.<br><br>Its target probably is japanese teenage girls but male otakus will buy it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure nonsense. <br> pure nonsense <br>So show me some fanservice that would appeal to otaku, or sexualization.<br>You can't? That's right. It had an all audience target.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You see those (*,***)?<br>It means the BD sold so shit they oricon didn't even report it.<br> BD(DVD) <br>http://dvdbd.wiki.fc2.com/wiki/%E7%<wbr>94%98%E5%9F%8E%E3%83%96%E3%83%AA%E3<wbr>%83%AA%E3%82%A2%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E<wbr>3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni achieved its goals with Hibike.<br><br>Their favorite bakery increased sales 10x times!<br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/658<wbr>65<br><br>Now KyoAni staff likely to even get discount there!</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but ultimately it was more gloomy and serious, not really something i'd watch if I were up for some "moe". <br>Yeah, it was definitely a character drama first, especially compared to say Hidamari Sketch or Kiniro Mosaic or something.<br><br><br>I like Kekkai, but the OP mainly sold because Bump of Chicken are fucking huge with normals in Japan. Apparently the song actually drove some people to watch the show because of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cute highschool girls <br>Not exactly cute, the most prominent characters (Kumiko/Reina/Asuka) were all pretty "rotten" for that.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded?<br>Otaku buy anime not just for fanservice or sexualized girls.<br>Who the fuck do you think watch and buy all these late night anime?</br></br></br>  Show By Rock is an example that multi pandering could still do well, so what gives it's not so common anymore.  <br>Those charts tell jack shit since they don't include all sales. And studios/publishers never tell the exact numbers.</br>  <br>Some casual men and women, alongside a few hardcore fans of KyoAni and some grateful fujos.</br>  <br><br><br>Moe or whatever aside, i'm surprised how Kekkai sensen got such a great OP and ED. Usually you get either one or the other.<br><br>Too bad it kind of got lost on itself in the last 3 episodes, should have probably been a 2-cour instead of a very forced anime original ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Those charts tell jack shit since they don't include all sales <br>Then why are we having this thread?<br><br> And studios/publishers never tell the exact numbers <br>So where did you get that 9k number of Amagi from?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>according to someanithing, vol 1 had 8.3k before it stopped charting on the Oricon weekly ranking list. However, during the 2015 Oricon mid-year ranking list, Amagi had an extra 2.3k BDs added to it's 6 volumes, so if you divide that by 6 you get about 400 and adding that to 8.3k is approximately 8.7k which is close to 9k.</br>   *2,059 Wish Upon the Pleiades <br>I'm so happy, it reached 2k. It might not feel much but for a story like that it did well and this is the first time in years Gainax has reached even 1k. And it happened with actually good title.</br>  <br>KyoAni should invest in bussinesses and promote them. (Yamaha deal is like that. They also did have product placement in Free!)<br><br>This season`s market placement show is Gatchaman, advertising Samsung Galaxy Tab</br></br></br>  <br>source<br><br>Amagi's individual volumes that ranked on the chart: http://www.someanithing.com/1059<br><br>Oricon 2015 mid year ranking: http://www.someanithing.com/3405</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then why are we having this thread? <br>Shit flinging and fanbase wars, duh.</br></br>  <br>Whether it's fujobait or not doesn't matter, without the boy band it wouldn't have done as well. The MC is a boring a glasses girl(though she doesn't wear glasses most of the time, thank god) and otherwise it's just another Fantasista Doll, but the heavy focus on the boys and Igarashi doing the beach episode with them clearly affected its sales a lot. Actually most SB69 media I've seen has been about the boy characters.</br>  <br>I'm actually pleasantly surprised by how good the series was. The story isn't out to break new grounds, but everything about it is solid.</br>  <br>You know that most of people on /a/ are just people who know a little or nothing at all about the industry.</br>  <br>I dudn't tell you any number, you were arguing with someone else. And these threads are cancer. You can tell a shows popularity from these inaccurate numbers but you can't say it sold X because that doesn't include all the sales.</br>  <br> source is a website that cites no source whatsoever </br>  <br> someanithing <br> no source <br>How new are you?</br></br></br>  <br>It's as credible as a random 2ch post.</br>  <br>the dude cites his sources, he's very meticulous as well, look harder newfag</br>  <br>Go back to MAL, kid.</br>  <br>Ha ha this site is hilarious.<br>http://www.someanithing.com/1020</br></br>  <br>Look at his FAQ newshit, it's all from Oricon.</br>  <br>Sasuga UtaPri. Otomefags save anime.</br>  <br>He's a fucking autistic yurifag, but I appreciate his work on displaying disc sales</br>  <br> I'm so happy, it reached 2k <br> it reached 2k <br><br>Hahahaha.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm so happy, it reached 2k. <br>I'm sorry.</br></br>  <br><br>He's also a Kyoanifag and an im@s fanboy.</br></br>  <br>1839 people bought Ninja Slayer<br>what the fuck why?</br></br>  <br> More than 90% of Love Live! fans are males, bro. <br>That's not true. In reality, it's closer to 50-50.</br></br>  <br>because of the sales they are probably tacking on a S2 hook</br>  <br> This season`s market placement show is Gatchaman, advertising Samsung Galaxy Tab <br> still no GALAX app <br>Why bother</br></br></br>  Who is the best, anon?   NEVER FELT LIKE   <br>Animeonlyfag here. Is that Shinoa's older sister on the left top ?<br><br>Will Krul get more screen time on next season ?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's Shinoa's older sister.<br>If they do a good job, Krul will get screentime at half second season and at the end, but I heard the final will be original.</br></br>  YOU GOTTA TELL ME YOUR LOVE CAME ALL OVER ME  <br><br>I'm pretty sure that's how anime genetics works, and I can say this from having watched quite a few animes in my time: boys look like the father, girls like the mother.

A thread for secondaries?  <br>I'm sorry, would you rather they shit up your threads like what happened with the JoJofags?</br>    Is the anime censored? Should I wait for the BDs?
