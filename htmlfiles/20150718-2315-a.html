[ Just finished part 5. Can someone explain what just happened...that ending felt really rushed. I get what happened to the villain and i know Giorno becomes the head gangster but that epilogue was really off putting.<br><br>also Bruno&gt;&gt;&gt;Giorno</br></br>   Jotaro could have been an athlete winning all the time <br> Jotaro could have become a better manga artist than Rohan <br> Jotaro could have joined the army and ora ora'd some terrorists <br> Jotaro could have been a doctor <br> But no, he becomes a fucking dolphin fucker where he probably never uses his stand </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, he is Dr. Kujo, fuck you</br>  <br>Well he did become a Doctor just not a medical one</br>  Pucci kills Jotaro  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Partially from the translation.<br>Did you know that Mista beat the shit out of people that talked shit about Clint Eastwood for change, and that the reason he dodged all those bullets was from him simply being determinated and not due to Sex Pistols?</br>  pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>Pucci gets killed by clouds</br></br>  <br>Part 5 is BuBu's Gangsta Revenge. Bruno is the real MC and Giorno a shit.</br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br>The chapter with the ball thing was fluff so that araki could meet the required number of chapters he needed for the last volume.</br>  i guess i'll post this here too<br><br>translation please?<br>if this is an actual story mode i'll be so hype</br></br></br>  <br>forgot the fucking picture</br>  Please enjoy the sweet tunes of Heaven.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/khk5V6L8Vos  [ ]</br>  <br>Strike - Li - mode - Degas Sonhidaritsu<br>best I could get off of google translate</br></br>  <br>Story Mode.</br>  never ever  <br>The text in yellow says "there is a story mode"<br>the other text is saying they'll cover some of it</br></br>  <br>I don't recall a scene like this at all, though. Is it an original story or something?</br>  <br>Keep in mind that every battle was in Cairo according too ASB</br>  <br>Yeah, and every battle in Part 1 was in Dio's castle. ASB fucked itself a bit with the lack of stages.</br>  He makes me feel confused and funny about myself. Is this a bad thing?  <br>My point is that it could just be a scene where they're just talking to each other but they don't want to bother making a background for the scene so they just use the Cairo stage</br>  <br>Oh, it's Cairo? It looks like a big shopping mall or something to me.</br>  <br>If it were an original story, it'd be cool if it was about all the JoJo's finding themselves in some weird universe and they have to fight ton survive</br>  <br>With a name like eyes of heaven. You'd think the story mode would be the JoJo time crossover we've always wanted to see. I mean it's already set up in the post battle quotes, might as well just go all the way.</br>  <br><br><br><br>fuck i'm hype<br>i'm getting actually giddy about the idea of an original story mode<br>just actual character models speaking instead of text scrolls like ASB is enough for me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot Pants is cute!! cute</br>  <br> You will be able to walk around Morioh in your lifetime <br>How is EoH not the best JoJo game?</br></br>  <br> Swastikas <br>Stroheim would be proud</br></br>  <br>Funny in what way, anon?</br>  <br>The ending is definitely underwhelming, but it helps to consider GER not as the climax, but part of the resolution. Whoever gets the arrow wins instantly, so the fight that happens before is the conflict.</br>  jojo is gay  <br>wait what?</br>  <br>Every day until you like it</br>  im evil?  <br>Around bottom left</br>   still not confirmed   <br>Wow..that was a surprise</br>  <br><br>They probably stand for temples but I don't really know</br></br>  You now remember Avdol  name all stands that transform the user  <br>oh but it will be</br>  <br>Yeah probably. The nazi swastika is some sort of buddhist symbol rotated.</br>  How the Eyes of Heaven look like?    <br>Better than ASB as a fighting game, but that's not difficult at all<br><br>I won't ever play unless it's on PC though</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty fucking good as long as you ignore Capcomfags.</br>  <br>Proof that Another version of Stroheim was a Buddhist, or something</br>   jojo's english dub <br>kill me now</br>  Can we get some jojo gifs and rare images going?    <br> yu voicing johnathan <br>Is there any chance of redemption?</br></br>  <br>You sick fuck.</br>  <br>I think the rarest I have</br>        <br>Even rarer tbh</br>  <br>Is Araki a vampire?</br>  Wiki page for EoH says Fatty, Akira and Kira have been confirmed. When did this happen?  <br>Yes.</br>    why does josuke in 8 have the same first and last name as the josuke in 4?  <br>Read Part 8, if you're a faggot hover  Josuke is just how Yasuho's dog was called, Higashikata is the family that adopts him. He doesn't have a real name because he's the fusion of Yoshikage Kira and Josefumi Kujo </br>    <br>my friend's oc</br>   old translations of part 5 <br>I'm reading part 6 now.</br>  <br>Hopefully SHA will work better here than it did in ASB.</br>  <br>He's David Bowie.

Start from grade 1-6 then go on to the next 1000 or so with regard to their frequency.</br></br>  <br> Brute forcing Kanji </br>  The anki method is fucking bullshit, you can't just learn these 6000 cards from seeing them a hundred times.  <br>About time the "guess" meme made a comeback.</br>  <br> not doing this while learning core10k <br><br>No excuse, you're gonna need a strong grasp of kanji.</br></br></br>  <br>Associate a dance for each kanji then. You'll learn it in no time.</br>  <br> I did RtK first </br>  <br>Almost as bad as the dancing shit, and RtK counts as another way of brute forcing kanji</br>  <br>Stupid methods work best for a stupid language.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with the dancing method...</br>  <br> RTK <br> brute force <br>It's literally making mnemonics up with radicals and names of other kanji. It's the exact opposite of brute force. Did you even read the introduction?<br><br>Anti-RTKfags, everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> RtK counts as another way of brute forcing kanji <br>Are you mentaly retarded?</br></br>  Anki brute forces vocab.   forced learning <br>Dropped.</br>  <br>elaborate on different ways to learn vocab</br>  Is there any way to force anki to display cards in a random order after they've been forgotten? <br>For example, when I'm doing core2k, I get 効果と結果 one after the other, unfortunately, my memory works against me and if I correctly guess 効果, I'll immediately know that after it comes 結果 which isn't really learning the words, more like the order they're displayed in.<br><br>It has something to do with the "again" interval, is there any way to make that global for all forgotten cards?</br></br></br>  <br>Your daily cards should always be in a random order.</br>  <br>I get them that way quite often actually, it's ironic that I'm doing a better job at remembering the order of the signs instead of the signs themselves.</br>  I did my reps drunk today and got a significantly higher rate and accuracy than usual.  <br>I guess namasensei was onto something all along.</br>  <br><br>I've been going for a decade this year.<br><br>I can't handle any kind of reasonable rate without being overwhelmed, but at least I am always progressing.<br><br>You can't "forget" if you've actually learnt something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   see this shit <br> go to make an image of it <br> see someone else already has </br></br>  <br>I've watched that video 3 times.</br>  READ RIGHT NOW!<br><br>DO IT!<br>JUST DO IT!</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, I'm watching anime</br>   having to tell apart りを and りょう in listening   Why is it harder to understand Japanese people when they don't use a lot of words and easier to understand them when they use a lot of words?<br><br>That doesn't make sense to me, but I still have a much easier time reading a very long and wordy news article (while using rikaisama a lot) than with reading some manga where they speak short and choppy Japanese.</br></br>  <br>Given that they got the other part basically correct, I have to think this was just some kind of brain fart on the part of the translator.</br>  <br>It's not really "bare minimum" but rather "whatever works", "random", etc. "bare minimum" has the connotation that you're just scraping by, but 適当/テキトウ is closer to just bullshitting your way through.</br>  <br> not watching dramas or niconico </br>  <br>Watching detective conan makes me think translators just didn't give a single fuck 10+ years ago. They clearly pick up a lot of words that I have trouble catching, but at the same time make absolutely retarded mistakes multiple times an episode.</br>  <br>I spent like 2 years watching niconico already and there's nobody worth watching left anymore. Dramas are probably just as bad as they are in the west so haven't bothered</br>  <br>You mean worse than they are in the west</br>  <br>Jap TV is shit in general</br>  hey /djt/, I've started to learn japanese about 3 weeks ago and I notice one issue a lot. I have a lot of trouble retaining actual vocabulary. When I see the english/japanese I can point it out in the opposite language but I can't actually say what it is off the top of my head. Is there a good process of how I should learn? I'm thinking I should learn all the hirigana characters and then start to learn the vocabulary afterwards. Good or bad?  <br> hey /djt/, I've started to learn japanese about 3 weeks ago <br> I'm thinking I should learn all the hirigana characters <br>That's what you should have been doing with those three weeks.</br></br></br>  <br><br> ignore this post <br> internet cuts out <br> forced to read <br><br>Thank you God.<br><br><br><br>I actually learned a bit of grammar before learning Hiragana too but as a general rule you should learn Hiragana as soon as possible. Like, one of the if not the first things you do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kindness breeds weakness. DJT is better than this because DJT isn't very friendly.  <br>No one gives a shit</br>  <br>I made this image over a year ago, didn't realize anyone saved it. I had since formatted my computer and lost it.</br>    <br><br>This person is an ungrateful cunt but I can sympathize to an extent. I hate when my parents waste money on stupid shit that they know I don't want, but they feel obligated to get me SOMETHING for Christmas. I'd rather not receive any gifts and just buy things throughout the year as I need them. Being with my family is a present enough.</br></br>    <br> Being with my family is a present enough. <br>Fuck, I wish I was non-autistic and could feel these feels.</br></br>  <br> Millennials <br>This generation is awful. We really need a major war to inject the masculinity and common sense back into the men. There's nothing like nearly getting your head blown off and watching your friends bleed to death that will make you stop acting like a spoiled and effeminate little cunt.</br></br>  <br> Millennials </br>  <br><br>Strangely enough, the previous generations would probably call you a massive retard for actually wanting a major war. (I'm also going to assume you're American faggot that has never had their city actually attacked.)<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Im going to call troll</br>  <br>Where do I meet people like that? I like talking like a cute faggot and enjoy using smilwys and talking like a kid. I won't learn anything but they will look at me like a leader and I honestly just want to fucking cutepost with weebs the normie weebs ok. <br><br>Fuck</br></br></br>  てっちり<br>壷中の天地<br>餡蜜<br>天守閣<br>蟷螂の斧<br>墨汁</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go to like, literally any forum related to Japanese media ever</br>  can you guys post your kanji grids pretty please?  <br>cb4960, nukemarine, Tae Kim, Jim Breen, cangy, buonaparte, uisukii/cor-kun, etc., people and users affiliated with Japanese language acting forums/websites aside from DJT. They generally act/acted with kindness towards others but on the flip side of this without those members of the Japanese language learning community including those previously mentioned and many others outside of DJT, DJT itself would be looking rather worse for wear as more or less everything in the Guide relies on various things in conjunction which have been shared by these peoples. <br><br>I don't get this attitude. Arrogance breeds myopia and we aren't in a position to go about acting like dicks and pretending it makes us better people. That sort of thing is reminiscent of a kid who goes about flashing the expensive goodies his father spent most of his life working to be in a position to be able to afford.<br><br>Humility can be a virtue, man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm only 1.5 months in, but today was the first time I broke 80% retention so I'm really happy about that.</br></br>  <br> there are over 400 japanese letters <br><br>jesus christ</br></br></br>  <br> I'm only 1.5 months in, but today was the first time I broke 80% retention <br>Thank you for boosting my self confidence.</br></br>  <br>those aren't letters</br>  <br><br>For me 天守閣 is the King of "why bother remembering this oh it showed up again..."

Or at least the one I remember most. <br>It was 心中（しんじゅう） for me, although I don't think I've seen it in a year or more now.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, technically they have none since they have no alphabet. (Using the Latin one sometimes aside)</br></br>  <br>no thats the alphabet which japan adopted<br><br>what is a japanese letter</br></br></br>  What is some good manga or novels or whatever that I can read with my shit Japanese? I only know 1200 words or so and am fairly comfortable with grammar.<br><br>I refuse to put myself through anymore yotsuba</br></br>  reading japanese stuff feels so good dammit  <br>just pick something that seems enjoyable to you, even if it is difficult, a little bit of challenge is good to progress</br>  「あたしに何か用」という意味何？<br><br>Context is<br> Employee quits job <br> She sees her old boss <br> He looks at her funny <br> She says this with a sigh <br><br>I think it means "Do you have something to say to me?" but I'm not sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love all of you.<br>It does get easier anons.</br>  <br> It does get easier anons. <br>Why do you lie to the people you supposedly love?</br></br>  <br>It's just "Do you need something?" It can also be "Do you need something of me?" in a more formal setting.<br><br>Also, you forgot the は before the 何.</br></br></br>    <br>Oh alright. Thanks bro. <br><br>Also, she doesn't say the は, she says exactly what I typed.</br></br></br>  <br>But it does get easier.  Once you know 2000 kanji with all their readings and 30k vocabulary. </br>  <br><br>There is no feeling greater than going back to something you struggled with before, going "how the hell did I ever read this at that level?" and breezing through it.</br></br>  <br>No, I meant the part that you typed. It should be 意味は何.</br>  Why are you learning a degenerate language like Japanese when you could be learning a glorious language like Old English instead?  <br>2000 kanji really isn't that much anon. when you look at it like a whole yeah you spend a lot of time on learning. I am almost a year into doing anki 289 days or so on just this one deck over 300 hours but I don't look at it as a waste. It is just time that I am going to use in some other way somehow. The time is going to go by whether or not you spend it studying something you love or just doing something else. <br><br>Basically just never give up. I know much more than I did before but nowhere near the level I want to be at. Even when I reach that level I am either going to change my Japanese learning goals from there or completely trash Japanese learning and pick up something different. Human aren't meant to content or  happy.  We have to keep changing, its the way of the human.<br><br><br>It's one of those feelings that keep us going, It's great being able to read your guys manga pictures you post here with no problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>*Englisc</br></br>  <br>I intentionally leave it out when I'm not speaking formally. My Japanese friends omit particles all the time, so I've kind of picked up the habit.</br>  <br>Oh, the は makes it obvious.<br><br>という before a noun can be used similarly to an adjectival phrase. It's just "what's the manner of business that you have with me?"</br></br></br>  <br>You can't always omit particles. という意味何 sounds strange and childish. It's even stranger in written form like that.<br><br>Been living in Japan for 8 years.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't doubt your superior Japanese know-how. <br>I'm just saying it's a habit. <br><br>I say stupid childish sounding things in English too, so I don't care all that much. <br><br>Thanks for looking out for me though, anon. (What part of Japan do you stay in?)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, why do you browse these shit threads if you're that much of a jap vet? Seems a bit redundant if you ask me.</br>  <br>Omitting particles is fine. Don't worry about that. You just have to remember when you can because sometimes omitting too much sounds like baby talk.<br><br>I'm in Chiba.<br><br><br>I'm bored and decided to help people with their Japanese while at work.

From what I've seen of the anime it looks like some characters were introduced way early/ out of order. Did garter belt chick show up before or after the dog?  <br>almost done</br>  i'm missing one  <br>Miki shows up on volume 2, the dog  shows up only for a chapter in a flashback then dies. </br>    the whole "I wanted to go home" is a big flag too  <br>The whole scene with the dog is anime-original, since the dog becomes a zombie that Megu-nee eventually killed or something like that a while back. Mii-kun isn't supposed to come in for another episode or two (she's still living in the mall during the test of courage, and they find her during a "field trip"), so she's added into scenes that only had Rii, Kurumi, and Yuki in the original. So it's basically different.</br>  <br>The anime chronology doesn't even make sense now that I think about it, since they went in the field trip because going to the school store wasn't cutting it anymore, but then they go to the store in the test of courage with Mii-kun.</br>  please, someone make a stretch of this  <br>Aya is Mega Man. She defeated Shovel Knight and acquired the Spade Sword. She splattered enough zombies to get the Zombie Arm. She salvaged the Bullet Caster but Miki threw it away. What power up will she find next? Crossbow? Metal Blade?</br>  Punished Mii is a best.  <br> Infectious bite. </br>  <br>They just need to make up another reason for going to the mall, anon. It's not that much of an issue, and since the author is in charge of the series composition, I wouldn't worry too much.</br>  Why is Mii-kun so sexual?  <br>Because boys are the best</br>  <br>She's trying to please her girlfriend</br>  Copypasta from the other thread<br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL<br><br>From the third link<br> Alternatively, widespread infection may lead to mutation, and different versions may appear <br><br> Also reminder that mutation in the context of widespread infection might also imply immunity to vaccines. <br><br> ÜberShovel when? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to flirt with Miki in English and hear her grammatically correct but awkwardly pronounced replies.    What I'm gathering from this thread is that it's decided that Miki is best girl?  <br>Of course</br>  <br>No, shovel's name is Kurumi</br>  There's the fact that the chair at choker-chan's desk is tucked under and we don't see her legs, until Yuki imagines her sitting there a bit later on  <br>This is the next scene.</br>    <br>Don't cry for her. She's already dead.</br>  <br>Well wtf did you all expect. We can't have a cute show about high school girls with an old hag in it.</br>  So are we going to have an anime original ending?  <br>What makes you think that? It'll probably end with the graduation.</br>  <br>If they do I hope the writer deliberately gives it a tonally opposite ending from the manga, whether it's a sad ending or a happy ending. It'll be like two alternate endings, both canon.</br>  Jesus christ, watched the first episode expecting SoL, received tragic zombie drama.  <br>Were you away from /a/ for the last 2 weeks or something?</br>  Now we know why  helicopter-kun gave up   <br><br> girl </br></br>  <br>kek</br>  I thought this was Gochiusa type stuff from the name and art, should I pick it up?  <br>  I thought this was Gochiusa type stuff  <br><br>Holy shit it isn't. The story revolves around a bunch of battle-hardened moeblobs trying to protect the smile of a crazed, hallucinating moeblob in a post-apocalyptic zombie world with dwindling supplies and equipment.<br><br>It's obvious that things are going to end very very badly from the onset. Either everyone, or almost everyone (everyone dies but pink) is gonna die at some point, and there's nothing they can do about it.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kei-chan kawaii!</br>  I'm a filthy casual who rarely goes into this board, but I just fell in love with this show. I thought I'd seen just about everything that anyone could do with the "zombie apocalypse" genre, but I was wrong.  I'm pretty sure that one chick who was huddling with the protagonist in the library and giving her advice is one of the figments.  This is my first time watching an anime as an airs, so, uhhh.. does Japan do hiatuses?  <br>That end though. I watched it with some friends because they wanted me to see it and I honestly expected it be shit but that end tho. It was so worth suffering through 18 minutes of suger sweet loli garbage. Really interested to see how this plays out</br>  <br><br> does Japan do hiatuses? <br><br>Not really, though it will only be 12-13 episodes. Also spoilers everywhere, so stick around at your own risk.

What's important to me is that I don't have to wait more than a week in-between chapters.</br>  <br>hold up, im sorry, but seriously why the fuck did he just crash himself instead of doing anything remotely helpful?</br>  <br><br>So, ya think anime Taroumaru is already  infected ?</br></br>  <br> He saw the school overrun and was stricken with grief   he crushed the photo and vial out of anger . He uses a 21 ton exit strategy.<br> Serum doesn't work. He mutated to retard strength   he didn't mean to crush the photo or the vial prolly . Loses control of his body.<br>And hey, he was super useful. He got them to move out gave the girls a 9mm handgun.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Only having watched one episode so far, I let my mind imagine the meaning of this scene.

Bodily function has ceased, no beating heart, no pumping blood, etc. <br><br>They might leak a bit of fluid here and there.</br></br></br></br>  The beginning of the ED song sounds so familiar to another ED from another anime but I don't remember where I heard it from. It's been bothering me for the past days.  <br>All they have to do is to throw them out of the window.<br>We, zombies are willing to eat them which has heroin's smell.</br></br>  <br><br>What happens if they have their first one at school? They must have a dispenser machine in the girls bathroom, or keep a bunch in the nurse's office maybe</br></br>  <br>I'm assuming they picked up as much as they could get back at the mall, and the nurses might of had some</br>  <br>They've probably go an empty room they throw everything in and close the door.<br><br>What I want to know is if Miki had a toilet or not at the mall. It looked she lived in a big storage closet or something. But she did have a sink, so I have to assume assume she did have a toilet. I don't really understand what sort of room she was in.</br></br></br>  <br><br>B R A V O<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gggguuuuuhhhhhh... C-cunt blooooood.... so hungry.</br></br>  I love you Iori.<br>I love you.</br>  <br>If girls have their first one when they're in school.<br>They run into the infirmary and get some pads and hear how to use it from women teacher.</br></br>  What did Kurumi said to Miki /GG/?  Who cleaned up  Megu-nee when Miki finished her off?   <br><br>Where is this from? Which chapter?</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>They probably left her there.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>hmm I see.<br>BTW Why you know the story of the mall?<br>Is the comics of School Live sold in overseas?</br></br></br>    Were they dating? Way to tear my heart out.  <br><br>No anon. We get people in Japan to scan Japanese copies and then we translate into English.<br><br>Basically we all read pirated copies. I would buy it if it were available. And actually a lot of us do purchase and import manga from Japan for series we like. I plan to for GG</br></br></br></br>  <br>The manga is translated by some groups on the internet<br/></br>  <br>As long as that company doesn't send someone like him after the girls for reasons, yes.</br>  <br>Not yet in English, though starting in November it will be.</br>  <br>Don't worry she would rebound to me over you.</br>  <br><br>Hey it's the creepy teacher from Punchline, right? Kurumi would make short work of him.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks !</br></br>  <br>This is why you invest in a safety razor. Upfront cost is 40 bucks for a good brush and handle. Add on a jar of soap that smells of sandalwood for 15 dollars that seems to last indefinitely. Steal a cup from your kitchen. And finally 20 bucks for a hundred two sided Japanese stainless steel Feather razor blade. You'll be smiling into the apocalypse with a nice, clean shaven smile.</br>  <br>But you don't normally carry razors with you, and who is ever at home when the zombie apocalypse hits? Aside from Shaun.</br>    WTF my friend in Akihabara sent me this photo!<br><br>A famous shop in Akihabara sells the holy water which can prevent people from being zombie!</br></br>  <br>That's not even in the manga. They should've sold shovels.</br>  <br>truly the japanese are slant eyed jews</br>  <br><br>This.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>hmm...but people in Akihabara is like zombies.<br>so They don't have to shovels.<br>They should be rather afraid of her shovel.</br></br></br>  <br> That aliasing <br>Shoulda used Waifux2</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what you're trying to say.</br>  <br><br>I follow I think. Like the people are zombie-like, so they fear the shovel, and thus they wouldn't sell?</br></br>  <br>I forgot to say "have"<br>so They don't have to have shovel<br>They are in zombie's side.</br></br></br>    <br>yes yes ^^</br>  Does anyone like Rii-san?  <br><br>Fuck you anon. Fuck you. Now I'll never get to sleep with that damned song echoing through my brain over and over.</br></br>  <br>Two or three anons do.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>She's my least favorite, but the poor girl needs love too, before she snaps. Incidentally the anime has made me warm up to her a little.</br>  <br><br>Some people do. She's worst girl in my opinion. But some anons seem to favor her. Mostly I think they like her big tits and fat ass. Lots of talk about forcing her to carry children in old threads.</br></br>  <br>One or two anons do.<br>almost all anons are Loli-com</br></br>  <br>There's this dude who fantasizes about whiteknighting her and keeps arguing here that she's okay and not a problem in the group at all in her current state</br>  <br>Does anyone like Slutrumi?</br>  <br><br>Shhh anon you might summon him. He never stops posting his insane shit once he starts.</br></br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth. Go die in a fire.</br>    Hello maintenance, something is broken here can you fix it  <br>I'm just stating what is canon. Go complain to the mangaka for writing a slut character.</br>  What could it mean? Rii is kill?  <br><br>Sure anon</br></br>  <br>No, Anon  it means you are kill </br>  <br>This is just a magnet</br>  <br>It looked to me like some sort of office for a live-in Janitor. So some kind of duo supply closet/mini-apartment, which is why it had lots of supplies but also a bed/sink/toilet/etc. Was probably used as a general storehouse for the mall survivors too, which is likely why she had enough food and water.</br>  <br>Doge is kill and  yuki isn't real </br>  <br>What shop was that? Didn't see it when I was there a few days ago. I'll have to go find it when I go back tomorrow.</br>    <br><br>Ok, I'm gonna stop doing this shit now</br></br>  <br>If you want a practical reason<br> it's Japan, and not unheard of to get nasty ass storms <br> general chaos from zombies like people breaking windows to jump out, missing targets, zombies breaking shit because these seem to be mostly hearing based zombies </br></br></br>  <br>even if they were to have some sort of generator problem with their solar powered school which would definitely have showers,<br><br>have you never heard of a sponge bath?</br></br></br>  <br>Please fix Ruu.</br>  <br>They're all 16-18, they definitely have hair<br><br>I really doubt their priorities are shaving their vaginas. They wouldn't even have a reason to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>I assumed it was some kind of janitor's/employees closet, it's not unheard of for them to have a largish private room with a toilet.</br>  <br> They wouldn't even have a reason to do so. <br>Except to be hygienic. Just because there's no chance of you getting plowed in the butt by anyone ever doesn't mean you can't keep your shit together.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't worry about it.</br>  <br> Just because there's no chance of you getting plowed in the butt by anyone ever <br>Well, in their situation, there's plenty of chances of them getting plowed in the butt, especially now they've come in contact with armed survivors.</br></br>    <br>They're armed also. They have that pisto lthey found in chopper-kun's briefcase</br>  <br>You mean the one Miki tossed?</br>  <br>I knew people from Akiba were unusually lifeless.</br>  <br>Yes, the one that Rii totally picked up.</br>    <br>She's probably too useless for that.</br>  <br>I mean there's interior windows broken that are out of zombie reach (small windows above interior doors).<br>Kurumi's house has chunks taken out of the brick fence, both entrance windows damaged, apparent rocks or other rubble outside her room, but her nameplate is still happily hanging there. Inside her room which apparently has been untouched since the event, there are bookcases and books with dings and marks as is they've been sitting outside for a few months.<br>Further on when they're at the gas station, there's a shot of the city, and there are building with massive multi-storey cracks in the walls.<br><br>I know the easy was to show dilapidation and neglect is to break windows, ding, dent, and dirty things, and have concrete cracking, but if you were to add it all up, it's almost as if it's either an active military warzone with missiles and gunfire, or otherwise abandoned for a hundred years.<br><br>Still I'm happy to accept it as artistic licence, it just kinda comes off a bit thick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's the sexiest body/face wise and I have a soft spot for onee-san's who try to shoulder the burden. I don't normally like the token cow tit, but hers are reasonable and not ridiculous.<br>Best Personal "flair"(i.e garters) and hair goes to Miki<br>Kurumi has the best personality and style<br><br>Yuki is pretty shit in comparison to the others, but her design is better than Megu-nee's, but worse than the others partially because of the token pink haired loli aspect. I'll like her more when she becomes less of a liability and more of a happy voice of self-aware reason when the others aren't handling things well as it's been mostly just her making up a new "game" or something which is all fine and dandy, but not every/the majority of situation.<br><br>Miki=Kurumi&gt;Rii&gt;Kei=Yuki&gt;&gt;Megu-nee</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm confident that the curtains match the carpet in all cases.<br><br><br>Yuki probably can't grow much more than a little peach fuzz despite being a grown woman. Shovel and Rii would have some. Rii would trim it neatly, and shovel would be a little wilder. Miki is the most likely to shave, but with the apocalypse making that more difficult, she might fall back to trimming it short.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with hygiene.</br>  <br><br>Isn't it romanized daijobuu?</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's the omega strain.</br>  <br>why are they glowing</br>  <br>It's actually more hygienic not to shave, the hair helps to protect the vagina and urinary tract from infection via dirt and general nasty things.<br>It's not more hygienic, it just arguably looks nicer(my preference), no sticking out hair in a swimsuit, doesn't leave hair in your mouth during oral, and isn't an issue if you're not poor or in unsanitary conditions.<br>lrn2basic body health.<br> Also in grown hairs and cuts can become infected and cause big problems in their situation.<br><br>And again, theirs literally no good reason for them to shave.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they're cute girls.</br>  <br>Punished Miki doesn't need a gun she's confident in her CQB skills</br>  <br>I don't know what the joke is or why you repost it several times in every thread.</br>  <br>nVidia Lightworks™ brings your anime closer to life with real time ray trace scattering by leveraging the power of delusional highschool girls and shovels.

She's as likely to not be a stuffed bear as Megu-nee is likely to be alive in the anime.<br>-Not confirmed at all, all we know is they likely hideout around if not in the campus.

It's clear as day. <br><br>Contradictions</br></br></br>  <br>I've always been shit at noticing subtleties in media</br>  <br>Out the window of course</br>  <br>In paper bags. Threw it out the window.</br>  <br>This is the most horrifying picture in this thread.</br>  This show isn't comfy at all.  <br>What are you, some sort of normie?</br>  <br>dispair</br>  So this is why Rii kept asking Yuki if she hears anything in the elementary school. She got a sixth sense to detect life forms.  <br>Let's hope she didn't have to deal with diarrhea.</br>  <br> It's okay, they are just chatting somewhere <br> THERE IS NO TIME TO BE PRETENDING TO BE RETARDED RIGHT NOW </br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's hilarious.</br>  <br>All the healing without any of the sleep-providing comfy, for anons needing quick healing in the middle of a long "work" day.</br>  <br>Diejoubu</br>  The one thing that always bugs me about zombie stories like this is how the survivors are always worrying about supplies like food and water and yet the zombies never seem to need any of that shit. Even assuming they knew how to operate faucets and whatnot for water (if they didn't they'd all be dead in less than a week), they can seemingly go for weeks at a time without eating anything (not even each other) without so much as slowing down. ATP doesn't just make itself; they've got to be getting all that energy to shamble around from somewhere.<br><br>I know that would ruin the entire setting, but I still get taken out of a world when people are all "oh shit we only have a week of supplies left and those zombies are somehow still out there after months." At least this story somewhat gives an explanation with the whole "maybe they remember their past lives" thing.<br><br> Although I haven't read the manga, so maybe it is explained, at least indirectly, I dunno </br></br></br></br>  So why do people change appearance when they become zombies?  Gakkou Gurashi or School Live?  <br> The more I read this manga, the more I'm expecting each of the Gakkous to be test subjects who are closely monitored, and each one seems to have a different trial being put on them. Yuki seems like she can detect others who are alive, Kurumi's combat skills are insanely powerful, Yuuri's protectiveness is so powerful that a lack of things to put it on drives her mad, and Miki's a phenomenally quick learner. This little party could go places in an apocalypse like this.  </br>  <br>Living at the School</br>  <br>calling it Gakkou makes it harder for rnormies to get into so that</br>    <br>Dying at school<br><br>Zombies don't need no energy conservation</br></br></br>  <br>Because if zombies had their present mental state, but the same degree of needed consumption as regular humans, a zombie apocalypse would be over in a week at the absolute longest.</br>    <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr><br>ENOUGHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></wbr></br>  <br>Big Boss Miki shoop when?</br>  <br>Why is her armpit on fire?</br>  <br>So Kurumi can extinguish it with her tongue and saliva.</br>  <br>She's my favorite. I don't usually like the "onee-san"-type characters because they're often too perfect and infallible, but I really emphasize with her conflict and personal problems. She has the best character design too.</br>    Yo, I'm dumb as fuck, so 36 is out? Where can I find it, sorry for being a flid.  I'm buying a Kurumi figure as soon as one releases  <br> mfw the only thing we'll get is Yuki <br> it's a nendoroid </br></br>  <br>Try actually reading the thread</br>  <br>Read this very fucking thread, you KS shitter.</br>  <br> Yo, I'm dumb as fuck, <br>At least you are self-aware.</br></br>  I need MORE Kurumi crops   Kaisha Gurashi! <br><br>Spinoff of cute salarymen doing cute salarymen survival things when?</br></br>  <br>Not a solo crop, but I still really like it</br>  <br> cute salarymen <br>You mean OLs, right?</br></br>  <br>Why is Kurumi so fucking boner inducing?</br>  How did that one zombie get to the 3rd floor?  <br>Because she is wearing pantyhose.</br>  <br>horror section of the library.jpg</br>  Yuki is for having fun pretending to be delusional with her.<br>Kurumi is for bro'ing around gardening tools for zombie-killing.<br>Yuuri is for bitchslapping back to genjitsu.<br>Miki is for tender loving sex and childbearing.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the plot demanded it.</br>  <br>She never left</br>  <br>fingerless gloves<br>twintails</br></br>  <br> Old hags <br><br>No, no I do not. Are you trying to imply middle-aged salarymen aren't moe?</br></br></br>  <br>She's part zombie, so she'd try to ravage your dick</br>  <br>You mean the one after the fire? Cause the barricades would have been gone then.<br><br>What really bugs me is where did all the zombies come from when they went to the bathroom at night? Or do they have to cross the barricade every time they have to go? Seems like the bathroom would be one of the first places you'd try to secure, after the sleeping and cooking areas.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the explosion made it fly into the building. It's very weak after all. Or it was lurking there all the time, but they missed it because it wasn't standing up and kept the door closed, since Yuki was mainly raving on the second floor, they pretty much skipped the third and every time they went for the roof.</br>   According to the July 18 report by Hon no Hikidashi, the official news site owned by Nippan/Nippon Shuppan Hanbai, one of the biggest book distributors in Japan, the sales of the based manga's first volume in the week of July 6-12 increased about 10 times more than the previous week of June 29 to July 5.   <br>They broke the barricade. It was a stupid chapter.</br>  <br>It's a flop, they said.</br>  <br>How about playing pretend child making with Yuki? It's still pretend, as long she believes it's only a game.</br>  <br> Are you trying to imply middle-aged salarymen aren't moe? <br>Are you implying women past their prime can't be moe motherfucker?</br></br>  Just finished ep 01.<br> a group of girls playing pretend 24/7 so that their club's retard blob mascot don't go full bonkers <br><br>Poor things. How's the cute slice of life/shit is going down balanced for the whole series? 50%-50%, 75%-25%?</br></br></br>  <br>Yuki is pure. Cute genki pink-haired girls are meant to stay virgin.</br>  <br>Can I be proud of this even though I've not spent a penny on it?  Reading and hyping the manga on a thai moon drawing site must count for at least 0.1 sales right? </br>  <br>For the manga, it's 50-50 until a certain incident. Then it's 70-30. Recently, the school life club has more or less stopped activities.</br>  <br>Probably something like 20%-80%, but gradually shifting to 0%-100% as the story goes on. After the reveal the only real SoL is the occasional peek into Yuki's head.</br>  <br>Trickles down ever so slowly. Last time they did anything SoL-related was playing at the river in their swimsuits, which only lasted for two pages or so because it's the middle of the fucking winter.</br>  <br>It's the other way around, Yuki is pretending so the rest of the girls won't go full bonkers.</br>  <br>The manga has a lot less cute than the anime, but that's because they are pretty much making each chapter an episode by extending how long the cute moments last</br>  <br>No, he said "ep 01". At the start, Yuki is obviously totally delusional and the rest has to play along.</br>  <br>Well, yeah of course.</br>  <br>Point is, they let her roam free so they can have a peace of mind by having her being all cheerful and genki.</br>  Paveru Hakase, Sumisu-desu  <br>Tell me about the Lamia.

What is this sorcery</br>    <br>a million times better than manga rory*</br>  She looks like a HanaKana character. Am I right?  <br>dem legs</br>  <br>I want to do dirty things with her.</br>  I wasn't even trying to get boner this episode. Dammit Rori. <br><br>Overall, a good episode, although the cgi dragon is lame.</br></br>  <br>So fucking lame, why can't they show her panties in anime? Do they have to use these stupid physics to cover her up?<br>Fuck this. A-1 is really apologetic fucks.</br></br>  <br>Why do you need her panties when you have her voice to fap to.</br>  <br> liking lame pantyshots </br>  <br><br>It's the difference of being awkward and apologetic, or being proud and glorifying about a girl.<br>Fuck you for promoting censorship.</br></br></br>  <br>I find it way more entertaining to see all the different ways the actually cover up her panties. Besides, that's not why I like this series. Go watch K-On or some shit if you want that.</br>  <br> Go watch K-On or some shit if you want that. <br>Excuse me, are you retarded? K-On has no panties.<br>Also </br></br></br>  She's even better than I imagined, All hail Rory Mercury.    <br> being a loli hater satisfied by censorship <br>As expected of Lelouch.</br></br>  She's shit on the anime  Can we all agree that elf is the worst?<br> Muh PTSD </br>  <br>Jesus christ Rory's design is fucking awful, this shit is Kuroneko yandere mode and nothing more than that.<br><br>The novel designs are much better than this piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Agreed, and to be safe, A-1 censors her needlessly.</br></br>  I prefer anime design over old looking manga design<br>Rory is pure sex</br>  <br>Bullshit, anime Rori is much less loli,<br>can I say 'TOO OLD' hahaha</br></br>  <br>That's obvious, and you are replyng to bait.</br>  <br>So you preffer a 15 years old girl who use gothic dress and looks like shit.<br><br>You're a pedophile and a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. Should had stuck with the original.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128217141 <br>Really?</br>  <br> So you preffer a 15 years old girl who use gothic dress and looks like shit. <br>More like 13. 15 is too old, and you are a retard with a shit taste if you like faulty older girls, kill yorself and go back to MAL.</br></br>  <br>This is captive combatant torture.<br>Must report to Amnesty International.</br></br>   actually drawing an anime character with visible lips <br>stop it</br>  No wonder Hardy wants her so bad. I would also get myself a Goddess of Love  <br>It is absolutely best for a man to become her servant after death.</br>  Bozes is the best girl.  <br>Heresy</br>  Anime Rory a best.  <br>Drill&gt;all</br>  <br>Doing stupid shit to hide panties is just as fucking weird and lame as doing stupid shit to show panties</br>  <br>YFW you will not see real drill hair girl IRL</br>  <br>Rori &gt; Persia &gt; Drill</br>  what kind of name is Rory Mercury seriously  Delilah best girl you faggots  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>There is nothing wrong with liking little 2D girls you faggot</br>  <br> Risa voicing these two on Fridays <br><br>Boner please.<br><br>My dick can only get so hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delilah a shit<br> I got this letter that makes no sense, is clearly forged, and would jeopardize my standing while ruining everything for everyone else even though the entire purpose of my organization is to have a better life as a monster girl <br> BETTER DO WHAT IT SAYS AND KILL THE GIRL </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br> mental illness <br> defend <br>No need to defend. I'm proud of it since objectively more perfect and not rotten.</br></br></br>  I don't even like loli characters. What the hell is this?  <br>Anyone who likes the autistic novel version is autistic themselves.</br>  So i've read somewhere bf4 that in the end mc stays in this land and all 3 girls go to japan,and the portal can never open again,Is that the truth?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>I think the real mental illness is trying to draw a connection between 3D little girls and 2D loli.</br>  Do I need to watch Steins;Gate before this?  <br>I haven't watched the episode yet but from the concept/teaser art I liked the original design way better.<br><br>Then again, its really her facial expressions and personality that make it, so maybe the redesign will be alright.</br></br></br>  <br>It's inversely proportional to how shitty the CG dragons look.</br>  <br>There are two fucking episodes out. Just watch Steins;Gate along with this as it comes out, dipshit.</br>  <br>Not being able to separate reality and fiction is a key indicator of mental illness, so yes. <br><br>There's no difference in the "loli is CP/pedo/child rapist!" comparison and "You watched a Hollywood movie, now you'll be charged with murder."</br></br></br>  <br>The dragons could use more frames.</br>  <br> We won't ever get her spread eagle nude and showing off her pubes in the anime <br>Why live</br></br>  <br><br>is it a coincidence that Rory in japanese sounds like loli?</br></br>  <br>How does one sound like a lewd 12 year old?</br>  <br> Likes 2D girls looking like kids <br><br>You're a sick bastard.</br></br></br>  <br>The warrior bunny's pubes could be even better to touch than nopubes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128221263 <br> So you're proud about being a pedophile? <br>Why not?<br><br> go back to jail you degenerate fucker. <br>charge me with a crime first, retard :^)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it worse than Chaos Dragon?</br>    <br>If she was sitting on me I would not be able to contain the boner.<br><br><br>You have great taste anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to do the anal with rory's ass</br>  <br>Best girl is finally here.<br><br>I don't dislike her design in the anime at all.</br></br></br>   pantsu shown in the magazine posters <br> no pantsu in the anime <br>Man, I don't mind fanservice or not, but trollphysics are always annoying.<br>Rori a best.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not usually into loli but she makes me want to do technically legal things to het</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>faggot</br>  <br> porn will use her bleh anime design instead of the glorious goth loli LN/manga version </br>  <br>hardy must be one hell of an otaku</br>  <br><br> Tuka in a sweater <br><br>dick status: muh</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, she's as much as a loli as Hestia is one, she's more of a petite woman than anything.</br>  <br>I don't get why anyone would think she's a loli. She has literally 0 features of a loli.</br>  <br>  deleted <br><br>You killed him anon</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much only because she was said to have stopped aging at around 13-15 years old. Which doesn't means anything by Anime standards.</br>  Reminder that Magic&gt;guns.  <br>please leave wizard anon.</br>  A-1 Pictures couldn't even <br><br> show the part where Rory makes those bandits dig graves. <br> even mention the rape.  <br> even explain why she just went and killed them  <br><br>How are they going to deal with Zoral? Turn him into a snot nosed beta?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guys, what if. Stay with me here, combine the two. Eh? Anyone?</br>  <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Da slugga!!</br>  <br>Like this ?</br>  This thing<br><br>I've seen it before what the fuck is it?</br></br>  <br>I agree this part was really lacking, 2 minutes for that wouldn't have killed them. It's quite important as to show who she kills and who she doesn't. Though I guess the fact kids knowing and liking her makes it a bit obvious.</br>  <br>It better then adding fucking white/black bars to everything.</br>  <br>Original design, do not steal</br>  <br>Gargantia?</br>  <br>Patamon fucked an Eevee</br>  So is Rory's height in anime?  <br>*what is</br>  Disappointed by this episode tbh.<br><br>I feel they're missing a lot of the gravity that the JSDF's actions are having on the general populace, as well as the general fucked-up-ness of the surrounding area now that it's become mostly lawless.<br><br> Bandits raping and pillaging cut <br> Gravedigging cut <br> No one else willing to help the stuck cart cut <br> Reactions to the JSDF rushing the fire dragon cut <br> Reactions to the JSDF fending off the fire dragon cut <br> Last scene didn't show the kids and old people being relieved <br><br>It just feels like the anime is way more lighthearted than it should be at times, which makes me worry about upcoming events like the Italica Crisis.<br><br>That being said, at least Rory and Lelei were enjoyable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I've heard somewhere it's like 5'3. I might be mistaken but it seems about right.</br>  <br>Tiny. She can basically stand up straight inside the hummer.</br>  <br> 5'3 <br>Nigga, adult men are 5'3 in Japan, try again</br></br>  <br>It's anime though and the men seem pretty tall</br>  So can we all finally agree that the anime design is better than the manga design?  <br>Agree? This is 4chan we don't agree here.<br><br>But everyone on the anime side are not autistic.</br></br></br>  <br> can we all agree <br>Over my dead body.</br></br>  Is this going to become a full harem? Or is it just the elf, sorceresses and goth loli?  <br>Call her a loli one more time...</br>  <br><br>I can't wait for that upskirt page to be animated.</br></br>  <br>Just the 3 girls and only the loli want the MC</br>  <br><br>Why?<br><br>Is going to be censored</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>time of upload this image again</br></br>  <br>Is also a dark elf and to a really minor extent his ex wife later on.

I don't see what the complaints are.<br><br> Just minor stylistic details.</br></br></br>  <br>My eyes are being assaulted.</br>  <br>140cm Range</br>  <br>I dunno why I always think mc will end up with pina.</br>  The LN are translated?<br>I couldnt found em</br>  <br>Oh man fuck Rory look at them tittes.</br>  <br>Holy shit her VA giggled way too much in all of her scenes.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>The best.</br>  <br>Are you offended or raped?</br>  Goddamn, watching the episode made me feel like Im making up scenes but apparently its the studio cutting off parts.   tfw a loli will never sit in your lap   Does anyone know where this step scene is? I can't find it.  <br>Got it.</br>  I hate her voice.  <br> IT'S NOT THE MANGA <br>that's basically it</br></br>  <br><br>The anime design is bleh because its all done to be easier to draw. Less layers and frills and shit. The anime design is very clean and neat, but also just takes stylistic choices like the awful bunny ears</br></br>  I love axe users!  <br>This. Her VA was trying way too hard to sound seductive.</br>  <br><br>the gay is real</br></br>  <br>And she succeeded.</br>    Modern military rekting medieval period fags was the only reason I didn't drop this show.

Maybe add black bars or lens flare?  <br>They included the one shot of a murdered refugee but yeah it definitely could have used a bit more setup.</br>  Why did my RSS download this twice?  Why did Rori kill those guys?  <br> it definitely could have used a bit more setup. <br>There's been 3 episodes of setup. Lots of people been dropping Gate like hot shit because of it.</br></br>  <br> Why is she so perfect? <br><br>Man, this design is really pretty.<br>10/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's actually a pretty nice person, and she killed those bandits and deserters because they're assholes that preyed on regular people.<br><br>That's why she asks the kids in the convoy if they're being force to go with the JSDF, if that little boy had said yes, she probably would've slaughtered them.</br></br></br>  <br>This. If she was just some mass murderer, those kids wouldn't have ran up to her excitedly.</br>  <br> tech&gt;fantasy <br><br>That's not the point of the show at all. <br><br>Hardy could rape Japan along with the entire Earth if she wanted to. And just wait until manga or possibly anime get into the stargate part.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LN Rory</br>  <br>According to her religion she's allowed to kill as she pleases, and so are the bandits.<br>My understanding isn't that she was killing the bandits to punish them from a religious point of view, but merely doing so because she could, according to her religion.<br><br>Besides, every time she kills people, it feels like sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Second saga might be ocean Gate with Atlantis and battleships.</br>  <br>There's a second saga???</br>  <br><br>Well, she is the future goddess of  love  after all.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that pic completely unrelated to Gate in any way? Different author and title, and all?</br>  <br>She's perfect for petting on the head and telling how cute she is.</br>  <br>Yeah, there's 5 novels for the first and 5 gaiden books.<br><br><br>Yeah but it's just an example of what I think the next saga will be. Haven't read Rune Troopers either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I like her LN design better.</br>  <br>Probably because no retarded red underlip.</br>  <br>I prefer her anime version to the manga one by a good deal but the LN design definitely strikes me as the best.</br>  <br>So you like the anime version more than the manga version and vice versa? That makes no sense at all.</br>  <br>boner</br>  <br>LN design and manga design look quite different most of the time, and anime design is sort of its own thing.</br>  <br>LN Rory &gt; Anime Rory &gt; Manga Rory</br>  <br>LN design and anime design are the same thing in essence, same dress and all. It's the manga design then went far left field with her gothic design.</br>  <br>are you color blind ?</br>  <br>No? I have all the illustrations with me here.</br>  <br>I think  was implying that the LN designs have red lips too. The anime design uses bright red so it's much more prominent.</br>  <br>she has a purple lipstick on, and your scans quality are rather on the meh side too</br>  <br>Do you think we will be able to get the pantsu version from the BD?</br>  <br> she has a purple lipstick on <br>Where is this said? At best it's pink. Scan quality would not get rid of trances of purple that easily.</br></br>  Scan quality is pretty top actually.  <br> Retking <br> Wreckeding <br>Regardless, there should be. There is in the manga, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>her whole color sheme is black and purple. Sure her lipstick is not as purple, but it sure ain't fucking red<br><br>compare the colors of  and  and this image</br></br></br>  <br>I hope it's this rather than . I'm not a fan of the type who thinks it's okay to kill if they think the person is bad, I'd much rather her just be killing.</br>  this fucking autism about lipstick<br><br>nigger if you wanna be gay so much put on some lipstick and get out of your basement</br></br>   Rorifags are this cancerous <br><br>I'm glad I'm not.</br></br>  <br>Anime did it black and red so I think we have a winner here.</br>  RedBlack&gt; MagentaBlack  The only thing bad about rori are the huge ribbons on her head  <br>Yeah, the cat ears bug me.</br>  <br>If she is Gothic, why is she always smiling?</br>  <br>Goths are occasionally happy and will express this through facial expressions.</br>  Anyone know where I can download CH. 31 and 32? /ak/ links are dead.  <br> can't make a believable, happy goth character <br><br>dunno about that<br><br><br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/gate-<wbr>thus-the-jsdf-fought-there-r5353/<br><br>should be there</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>That is disgusting.</br>  <br> dissing on Abigail Sciuto <br><br>BRUH.</br></br></br>   name is rory <br> not loli </br>  <br>When does that happen?</br>  FUCKING LEWD  <br>Is that a tranny?<br>From what series is sh-<br> ncis <br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought that was Bailey Jay</br></br>  <br>Yeah they have a plot point as a result of a panty shot but they still went to ridiculous lengths not to show it, way more than magic skirts. You want pantyshots go to Punch line or some shit.</br>  <br><br>There is an appropriate term, jailbait.<br><br>People should use it more often.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Besides, every time she kills people, it feels like sex. <br>Basically, her god does't care who she kills, as long as she kills. But Rory is still half-mortal and has enough agency to decide who she gets to kill. Her picking targets she consider evil is a choice she made. There are other demigods who were far more cruel, some of who were so unpopular that they got subdued by opposing demigods and sealed away in pieces because they were doing too much damage to society.<br><br>in short, Rory has the licence to kill, but she gets to pick who unless her god told her to do something specific.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wish this scene was included in the anime.<br>Apparently it wasn't in the novel, but still.</br></br>  <br><br>Glorious hand drawn dragon with little, to no animation, or CG dragons of middling design and with actual animation?</br></br>  <br><br>Regenerating immortal with superhuman strength.

You can pray and give sacrifices all day, they could still just ignore you. One thing about Gate Gods is they had to remind their worshippers that mortals aren't that important. That the Gods don't owe them shit and as such does not need to care or do anything.<br><br>The Empire, in any case, was the strongest military power in the Gate world and as such never needed to ask the Apostles for anything. They were never in danger of being defeated until now, so they never tried to gain divine favour.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about a giant lizard that can fly at the same speed as a Phantom, and you assume it actually flies entirely scientifically by using its wings, or that its wings are less durable?</br>  <br>It comes up time and time again. <br>Gods don't really give two shits about religions or mortals trying to appease them. <br><br>The followers of God of Light for example, sees the followers of God of Darkness (such as Rory) as enemies and tries to appease their own god by spreading lies about their rivals and causing conflict. <br><br>But in truth God of Light has no beef with God of Darkness, and none of what his followers are doing pleases him. <br><br>It's one of the ongoing plot in the novel how despite the existence of actual gods, religions are still mostly man-made bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He already has a wife.</br>  <br> Kuroneko Slut Edition is perfection <br><br>Anons have such low standards these days.</br></br></br>  <br>Divorced.</br>  <br> Kuroneko <br> black cat <br>Literally who</br></br></br>  <br> implying Shitneko wasn't a slut </br>  <br> my first goth bitch was oreimo  <br>this is an 18+ website, please leave.</br></br>  I was gonna say this story lacks tsunderes and then realized how tsundere Yanagida was<br><br>Both towards Itami and towards his own woman</br></br>  <br>Her whole outfit is ugly and is the goth loli equivalent of a cheap halloween costume you pay way too much for.<br>Even Kuroneko's outfit was better, and I think that was supposed to be actual cosplay in universe?</br></br>  <br> gif <br>It's 2015 and it's time to move on, found memories or no.</br></br>  <br>this looks pretty good, good job</br>  <br>It's only for a goddamn second anyway.</br>  <br>It's A-1, what the fuck did you expect?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128247489 <br>Thank you, you seem to fit in very well.<br>Enjoy your stay.</br></br>  I estimate Rori's ax to have a weight between 65 to 80 kg.

On the other hand when Rory IS holding it, the Axe weighs nothing and you can carry her around while she holds the axe in her hands.<br><br> You find out later that the axe actually contain Rory's divinity. This isn't very relevant to her, but another Demigod messed up and accidentally lost her weapon to Rory, who absorbed it. This caused that demigod to became a mortal for the next 39 years until Rory ascend and gave the power back, assuming she didn't accidentally die in the mean time. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Was the scene where Rory put her axe on a sleeping Tuka in the novels too?</br>  <br><br>Muh dick, guess I'm watching this.</br></br>  <br>No<br><br><br>Poor Mabel, losing her blood sword.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Poor Mabel, losing her blood sword. <br>I am not sure it happened to her.

Because of Japanese law Itami is not willing to take advantage of any benefits in having a slave, so she forces him to uphold his master obligations in providing for her daily needs instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't he take it as standard employment contract?</br>  <br>Being an apostle meaning a god chose you. Rory is still a demigod. The contract just means his soul will go to her and not to some other god like Emroy.</br>  <br>She's the best fit society-wise.<br> not a loli grandma <br> not underage for Japanese law <br> no daddy issues <br> not a sex slut </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why doesn't he take it as standard employment contract? <br>The point is that he could make her do ANYTHING, but he obviously wouldn't do such a thing especially since his superiors wouldn't approve.

He can't really free her against her will either.<br><br><br> Being an apostle meaning a god chose you. Rory is still a demigod. The contract just means his soul will go to her and not to some other god like Emroy. <br>The 39 year duration means it is actually possible for Itami and Rory to die together consider his expected lifespan. If Rory ascend with Itami still alive, she would become a deity and in the position to make him her apostle if she wishes... And the benefit is that after 1000 years HE would become a deity too. I can see the benefit of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only issue is we are not sure what deities do with themselves. We only know of one deity who desires marriage, and it seems to be an odd case and that no other deity have declared such intentions.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I wonder if Rory will make more contracts.

That whole merry band of elves, human mage and Itami is pretty fun. The midget with huge boobs is also interesting. <br>The issue is that the contract transfers injury to Rory's own body. So it is a hassle to hand out contracts to random people. Imagine minding your own business enjoying breakfast when suddenly your left arm just fell off. Sure, she woud regenerate, but it hurts like hell and if she had too many contracts the injuries would probably never stop coming.</br></br>  <br>I'm wondering why they haven't sent any of those helicopters through already.</br>  <br> I can see the benefit of that. <br>You can see the benefit of Itami not being able to have sex for 1000 years unless someone is being killed in the distance?<br><br>I don't think Itami would like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll stop having a corporal body in 40 years or so, which means that it doesn't matter after that point I guess?</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #4<br><br>Remember to please take it easy and relax.<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  Requesting embarrassed Eureka.<br><br><br>Additional Refs: http://imgur.com/a/jK9yw<br><br>Thanks for your consideration!</br></br></br></br></br>  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume.

Not sure if it's a native 1080p production, but it's certainly higher than 720p.  <br> Who needs to use spear <br>Kanade.</br></br>  Why are DMJii so best?  How lewd did they get on the ten hour flight on their private jet?  <br>I bet Tsubasa  held Maria's hands  very tightly while they were flying back to Japan.</br>  <br> growing up lolis <br> basically married, or the underaged version of that <br> best color schemes <br> great bodies <br> DESS <br> Mecha Gear <br> Right now the only ones with functioning gear <br> just cute and loveable <br><br><br>Here's a problem, I doubt Tsubasa knows anything about these things, and Maria is too shy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Right now the only ones with functioning gear <br>You forgot Hibiki.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to Gungnir.</br>  <br> Maria is too shy. <br>She seemed pretry bold in episode 2.</br></br>  <br>Did you already forget how ep3 ended?</br>  What if Aoi Yuuki really lost her voice and they wrote plot based on that?  <br>Shirabe's arc can't come soon enough.</br>  <br>I don't want that to happen, Aoi's voice is nice.</br>  <br>Not sure whether to be impressed by the level of dedication or disappointed that all the faces put together don't make a giant Shirabe face like those mosaics.</br>  <br><br>It's spear-like pilebunker according to Design Archive.</br></br>  <br>Her armed gear is (was?) literally the power of holding hands.</br>  <br><br>Shirabe is generic dfc <br>DESS is cute but Hibiki, Chris, and Maria all have better bodies<br><br>Personally I really like Kirika's design but I'd hardly say they are the best girls right now. We'll see if things change over the course of the season, they are already much better than they were in G.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are Crunchyshit going to be a week behind all the time?  Hopefully we get some good twists soon. Hibiki being useless again doesn't really keep me on the edge of my seat.  <br>They'll catch up next week, thankfully.</br>  <br>I usually prefer CR over commie in most shows, but I feel like they'd be shit with Symphogear.<br>Are they even translating songs?</br></br>  <br>No, pay attention. They're doing episode 3 and 4 Friday, then it will be on time each week.</br>  <br>I'm happy, but a bit anxious. Hopefully we won't get an influx of CR/HS-only kiddies.<br><br><br>Not the individual character songs. They translated Radiant Force though.<br>Maybe later on in the season? I know sometimes they start translating the OP a few episodes in.</br></br></br></br></br>  KIRI-CHAN SONG PREVIEW WHEN?   People still bashing Crunchyroll, despite the fact that their Symphogeah translation for episode 1 is more accurate than Commie's invented dialogue   <br> Hopefully we won't get an influx of CR/HS-only kiddies. <br>How will we get that if the previous Symphogear aren't licensed?</br></br>  <br>There's always the type of people who ask if they need to watch the previous seasons.<br>Or worse they type who watch the new season and complain that they're confused.</br></br>  <br><br>This. No fucking around with this line, just plain and simple.</br></br>  <br> There's always the type of people who ask if they need to watch the previous seasons. <br> clearly 3 seasons <br> SHOULD I WATCH THE PREVIOUS SEASONS <br><br>The fucking worst type of watcher.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's plenty of other reasons to bash CR. But let's not start that here.<br><br>I wonder if Commie will start editing the CR script from next week. H&amp;D might too.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Then again I'm not so happy with this line.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm a spear now </br>  <br>I once came across posts like that, but it turns out he was shitposting, trying to clutter the thread just because.</br>  <br>It's accurate.<br><br><br>Hopefully someone just typesets and does some light editing. Everything about the CR release is superior, besides some questionable translations and awful subs/no subs at all</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I always watch CR over Commie or even groupls like FFF. With Symphogear it doesn't matter anyway since I'm patient enough to wait for H&amp;D after watching the stream.<br>Now Funi I can't fucking stand.<br><br><br> hey can someone give me the chronological order of this I don't want to watch it how it aired and was intended <br>2nd worst type.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also their encodes can be awful.<br>I'm not complaining though. Waiting for subs every time isn't fun.</br></br>  <br><br>I often have trouble believing the people behind the keyboard posting those aren't just baiting because it's just so retarded on too many levels.</br></br>  <br>Well, to be fair, it's not necessary to watch the previous seasons if it's episodic show like Doraemon. They're just dumb/uninformed. I'd say that someone who watches shows 'ironically' are worse than that.</br>  <br><br>The few song translations they actually did are pretty ass though. They make up shit almost as much as Commie.</br></br>  <br>I've said it a few times already and I'll say it again, the way I'm getting the whole experience is<br><br>Livestream &gt; Raw &gt; HS &gt; Comeme &gt; H&amp;D<br><br>Assuming that's the order those groups release in.<br><br><br><br>It's not even hard to find out elsewhere, anyway. A quick Google search, or even MAL will tell you it's stupid to not watch things in order.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not even hard to find out elsewhere, anyway. A quick Google search, or even MAL will tell you it's stupid to not watch things in order. <br>For people who socialize a lot, it's more pleasant that they ask another person for information, rather than finding it themselves. That's why customer service is still needed, although there are always manual books included when you buy something. Because of that, sites like ANN or MAL have forums which are very helpful, in a similar way to customer service. These forum users unwittingly do unpaid labor toward the sites, which generate revenues from popularity and stuffs.<br><br>These retards create jobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>But don't they actually get the scripts to translate?<br>I mean, I'm amazed Commie actually managed to do song translations for Tsubasa and Chris looking at how much noise there is inbetween.  Pun unintended. </br></br></br>  <br>You know, I never actually thought of it like that.<br><br> Normalfag tier weaboos </br></br></br>  <br><br>Symphogear is not the kind of show where you get lost if you start with 3rd season though.</br></br>  <br>You're clearly not watching Symphogear.</br>  <br> Everything about the CR release is superior, besides some questionable translations <br>What did they do with Heavenrend's name? It's important.</br></br>  <br>https://c.milkteafuzz.com/#/shows/a<wbr>iring<br>They used 3 translator for that.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Yes it is.<br>You wouldn't know what Maria was talking to the American guy about, or what the loli science lab was about, or what linker is, or why Maria's pendant is broken, or what noise is, why there was an old lady's corpse floating around the moon, and many other things.</br></br>  <br>Is there a need to know that?

Just need to understand that this chick lost her power, because pendants = suit activator.<br> what noise is <br>Are you kidding me?<br>  why there was an old lady's corpse floating around the moon why there was an old lady's corpse floating around the moon <br>Gonna concede on this one, but then again someone can google the previous season's synopsis.<br> and many other things. <br>Probably unimportant bits of information.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does Symphogear manage to keep making girls this wonderful?<br>They already nailed it with Bikki, we don't need any more.</br></br>  <br>posting best stroganoff</br>  <br> fat legs <br>not even the good ones.</br></br>  <br>The retards who skip previous seasons aren't going to google shit.<br><br>Also we're only three episodes in, so it's hard to say how much they're going to connect to S1 and G.</br></br></br>  <br>God I love her shade of blue!<br>She looks really refreshing.</br></br>    <br>I want to lick her fivehead.</br>  Every episode this season has been like this  /m/ is considering making a fan letter to Nana.  <br>She has such a pretty smile, too.</br>  <br>Sorry anon, I was too busy staring at her beautiful smile.</br>  <br><br>That's actually quite impressive.<br>If only they were less liberal with their translations.</br></br></br>  <br> slowpoke <br> subs aren't even out <br><br>Dude, I have neither watched stream nor raws yet, only getting spoiled by the threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're commies, so it's impossible.</br>  No bikibutt this episode  <br> liberal <br>Their site's theme says Republican Subs. They can't be liberal.  I don't actually know anything about US politics. </br></br>  <br>You don't know how angry I was when I realized I missed the broadcast</br>  <br>Symphogear is literally the only anime where I can't wait and go watch the stream.</br>  <br>What's inside the box?</br>  <br>Another box.</br>  <br>American liberal is european socialist.<br>European liberal is american libertarian.<br><br>American red is european blue, also blue→red.</br></br></br></br>  <br>she kinda looks like a guy</br>  <br>How many boxes do I need do open before I know what Elfnein is?</br>  Dat screech  I want to hug and cuddle loli Maria.  <br>I want to bully her</br>  <br>Get in line.</br>  <br><br>Will you make up with her afterwards though?

That'll get her back for all the teasing she does.  <br> 8.8/10 <br>It's 8.88888 repeating of course</br></br>  <br>Next time Yukino teases 8man too much he should pin her down and platonically fuck her until she cums.

"Genuine" is not a valid descriptor for his feelings for any of the girls or their feelings for him. It is however a defining quality of a relationship between them.<br><br>You're at least right that 8man's behavior may partly be conciliatory because of Komachi, but the real death knell for her ship is that she has put no real effort or thought that we've seen towards being genuine, and 8man has given no sign that he cares enough about Iroha to pursue "something genuine" with her.</br></br></br>  <br>A 2 hour movie would be</br>  <br> closest to genuine <br> wasn't even at genuine part 2 <br>I bet you think Iroha can realistically win too, don't you anon</br></br></br>  I literally want to punch yui  <br>I also literally want to punch Yui<br><br>in the womb<br><br>with my dick</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here, punch your monitor.</br>  <br>No bully.</br>  <br>Assuming you said "would be enough"<br>I'm more comfortable if I we got 6-7 episodes instead of a movie, although that's unrealistic that it would be 2 hours long</br></br>  <br> &gt;wasn't even at genuine part 2 <br>I bet you thought she wasn't in genuine part 1</br></br>  Friendship end is the only plausible ending.<br><br>Bonus points if Yukinoshita goes abroad then returns for the timeskip finale.</br></br>  <br><br>bring it on dweeb</br></br>  <br> muh girl getting called fake <br> muh genuine <br>You guys cling to that scene as if it was a blessing from the heavens when it's just 8man proving that double YY are full of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>But Yuigahama was pulling that bullshit purposefully in the hope Yukinoshita would refuse her proposal.  Or maybe she wouldn't have minded, too <br><br>Too bad 8man still had to step in.</br></br></br>  <br> wasn't even at genuine pt. 2 <br>She didn't need to be there because she is already genuine enough. 8man doesn't need to call her out like he did double YY.</br></br>  <br>Yui didn't pull anything but the last drop that made 8man say "fuck it".

Saki is pretty great  <br> Choosing the easy way out with a shallow relationship out of convinience <br>Literally the one thing he doesn't want.</br></br>  <br> iroha end <br> easy way out <br> friendship <br> shallow <br><br>You must be one of those fags that believe that double YY won't be hurt by not winning the 8bowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He likes Iroha romantically. Friendship with double YY can be genuine after he rejects them. Yukino goes off to college abroad and Yui goes somewhere else.</br>  <br> He likes Iroha romantically. <br>Woah there, enough with the falseflagging.</br></br>  <br>I have this weird feeling that either Yui or Yukino will get tremendously hurt if 8man doesn't choose them. Even if he rejects both I think he still might really hurt their feelings. Both Yui and Yukino are dependent on him to various degrees. A lot of what they think and their emotions are tied to him. <br><br>Yukino has a ton of issues and helping him find his genuine thing plus "saving" him is very important to her. Yukino doesn't really get close to people so since she managed to fall in love with someone it would really hurt her to have that relationship go up in smoke if he doesn't reciprocate her feelings. Also she wouldn't be chosen again, that won't feel good for her is all the relationships with guys in her life end up with the guy going with a different girl.<br><br>Yui has really poor self esteem and she is madly in love with him. She is so emotionally invested in her relationship with him, due to length and intensity, that it would be hard for her to recover from it. 8man rejecting her in favor of someone else would only exacerbate her issues and it would slowly kill her to see him with someone else. Even for someone who is well adjusted with no issues would be hurt in her situation.<br><br>Based off of that reasoning I have concluded that both girls would be really hurt if they got rejected or if they weren't chosen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You believe acting considerate towards them again when they aren't asking him to won't hurt them even more.<br><br>He already learned his lesson.</br></br></br>  <br>So what? He should go for the triangle route with YY2, when it's already been pointed a thousand times that their relationships have been superficial.<br>And the only thing he likes about them is Yukino's face and Yui's Yuis.</br></br>  <br> He likes Iroha romantically. <br>That might matter if the same couldn't be said for YY. Meanwhile he's actively pursuing a deeper relationship with them, but not with Iroha.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't have to pursue one because his relationship with Iroha is already deeper that with double YY</br>  <br>Right because treating her the same way he treats Komachi and her shoving a spoon in his mouth is so deep.</br>  <br>Or you could say his relationship with Iroha grows more naturally and doesn't have to be forced as fuck.</br>  <br>Let's say he picks Iroha.<br>Double YY is hurt and he knows it, he doesn't lie about it and that's it.<br>If they can't handle that then that's the end of the club, simple.<br>He won't act considerate regardless of his choice. There is no easy way out of his situation.<br><br> These fish captchas don't have Yukino's pic in them. Better call google requesting a fix. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8/8 you should take your comedy act on the road.</br>  <br> Right because treating her the same way he treats Komachi <br>EOP please.<br> spoon in his mouth is so deep. <br>Summerfag please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally somebody with a brain.</br>  <br> There is no easy way out of his situation. <br>Not to chose one and ignore that they are in love with him after him telling them not to be disingenuous with them.</br></br>  These threads keep getting worse. I want to die.  <br> Le EOP meme <br> Doesn't post anything else </br></br>  <br>Check yourself, we already killed you and turned you into one of us.<br><br><br>Nigga that's fake as fuck, ignoring the issue is everything but genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nigga that's fake as fuck, ignoring the issue is everything but genuine. <br>I was being cheeky because that is exactly what he is doing. Nothing happens until he acknowledges their feelings and actively think s about them consciously.</br></br>  <br> Next time Yukino teases 8man too much he should pin her down and platonically fuck her until she cums. That'll show her. <br> platonically fuck her until she cums <br> platonically <br>I don't think you know what that word means.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck me then.</br>  <br>He acknowledges Yui's feelings but after the "thank you" gift he's doubting himself wondering if those feelings are anything more.<br><br>He has no idea what Yukino feels for him.</br></br></br>  <br>You somehow reminded me of when the 2nd season started and we were all talking about superficiality.<br>I called out the service club for being superficial and everyone called me a faggot even the LN "primaries".</br></br>  <br> that's the meme, anon </br>  <br>Is it so wrong to love someone so platonically that you want to fuck them platonically?</br>  <br>Buy it, fagget!<br><br>Then you can punch it whenever you like.</br></br></br>  <br>They were reactionary idiots then. The whole point of the plot is that the service club is working to discard their superficial behavior. They aren't genuine yet but they will be by the end, basically.</br>  <br> fuck them platonically <br>How the hell would that even work?<br>Sex is inherently sexual.</br></br></br>  <br>Not if you do it platonically, while showing no emotion as you look platonically into her eyes and climax together in platonic bliss,  platonically. </br>  <br>people fuck prostitutes platonically all the time, when jacking it can't get them off.<br>Some people just can't get off because of something mentally that's not necesarrily sexual in nature.</br></br>  <br>Under normal circumstances she doesn't. But in narration media. Author/editor pulling an ass and says "fuck you! No one gets in muh OTP" Happens a lot.</br>  <br>So let me get this straight, he wants them to be genuine with their feelings while he doesn't know what is really bothering them? He doesn't see himself as the root cause of it? If he made a choice or stopped leading them on this wouldn't even be and issue.</br>  <br> He likes Iroha romantically <br>[citation needed]<br><br>Vol 11 ch 1 8man outright stated that Iroha flew under his radar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't know what the cause of the problem is, he thought they were talking about Yukino's family problem, Yui was being extremely vague about the problem she would be solving.<br><br>He seems somewhat hopeful that Yui's feelings are real while he views Yukino as someone above him thinking someone like her wouldn't even be interested in him.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this just a reworded version of that 'missionary position for the soul purpose of procreation' meme?</br>  <br> He has no idea what Yukino feels for him. <br><br>He knows. Haruno knows.<br><br> “That’s right. That isn’t anything remotely like trust… It’s something much more horrible.” She smiled, only her lips appearing tender. But the quality of her cold voice made her appear as someone else entirely from earlier. “Nothing’s changed and that child thinks that’s fine. I mean, sure, that part is also what makes her adorable, but… I really don’t like that.” <br><br>Except you believed that Yukino was incestuous bi-sexual to Haruno and/or Hayama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino's issues and whatever pursue of romance she's going for are two different things.<br>Hachiman already took one step towards ending her dependency of him by refusing to help her.<br><br>The problem with Haruno's vision is she's only seeing that one side of Yukino, for one she misunderstood the reason why she asked about Hayama's future and didn't let her get another word in.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't know what the cause of the problem is <br>It is going to fuck with him hard once he realizes and fully acknowledges he is at the center of a love triangle. It will kill him to think he will have to choose one over the other. 8man can't reject anyone at this point, his last hurdle will be to have the balls to reject one of them directly.</br></br>  <br> He seems somewhat hopeful that Yui's feelings are real while he views Yukino as someone above him thinking someone like her wouldn't even be interested in him. <br><br>I'd say he's aware of Yukino's feelings at this point too, it's just that thanks to Haruno he's worried about where they might be coming from. Most of his "she's probably not interested in me" is still directed at Yui I think, even though he is making major progress on that front.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Sensei's talk about how it's okay to hurt someone that's close to you and him witnessing Hayato rejecting Iroha first hand served to prepare Hachiman to reject at least one girl by the end of the show.</br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  <br> by refusing to help her <br>When did that happen? Volume 11 ended with her request. We won't get 8man's response until vol12.</br></br>  <br>Why is this guy NTRing Zaimokuza?</br>  <br>everytime</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Whynotboth.jpeg<br><br>Hayama was wrong about YY2 being better than Orimoto.<br>Orimoto should take the transfer exam to Soubu and show them why 8man fell in love with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Big breasts on Iroha <br>Compensating much?</br></br>  <br>I don't know man, Zai deserves better than to be the victim in some faggot's NTR doujin.</br>  <br>He doesn't have to reject anyone though. All he has to do is accept Iroha. There will be on one rejected that way and the girls won't be hurt as a result.</br>  <br>Just like Iroha herself, that artist knows deep down who best girl really is.</br>  <br>That's because it's actually Yui without her hair dye and color contacts.</br>  <br> There will be on one rejected that way. <br>Not chosen=Rejected.<br><br>It doesn't matter who he picks, these things aren't painless, he could choose Saki or Orimoto and it would still be painful albeit a lot more since it just shows to them that what they thought was wrong from the beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br> want a Yahallo/Senpai~ end <br> Yukinofags hate me for leaving her out  <br> Yuifags only want 3P with Yukino <br> Irohafags don't want to share <br>Am I the only one of this Island?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree and so does the mangaka.</br>  <br>You are not alone. Just imagine the sex, Iroha helping Yui to do paizuris</br>  <br>No, rejected is a straight up rejection. Neither Yui or Yukino will be rejected if he goes with another girl. They would be fine with it because it won't blow up their friendship so it wouldn't hurt to see him with another girl that makes him happy and became his genuine thing.</br>  <br><br>here's how this scenario plays out. pic related</br></br>    <br>I want Yaharifags to leave</br>  <br>Then what makes Iroha so special? According to your logic he can choose either YY and the other YY wouldn't be hurt.</br>  <br>Why is she mad? He had no control over that whatsoever. If anything she should be incredibly embarrassed and apologizing to 8man for her sister's actions.</br>  <br>Stop biting.</br>  <br>She's mad at Kaika for stealing her man</br>  <br>I'll bite anything m8, at this point there's no discussion. We're stuck in an eternal limbo of shitposting until Spyro translates, then a slightly shittier storm of shitposting will arrive.</br>  How can he unlock the Miura end?  <br>He has stronger feelings for Iroha than Saki, Orimoto etc.<br><br> According to your logic he can choose either YY and the other YY wouldn't be hurt. <br>No, it would hurt their friendship and make one of them feel like an outsider. I actually don't think loser YY would be all that bothered by not being chosen. Yukino is a strong girl and Yui is a nice girl./ <br><br><br>He is angry at him for not being able to handle that and ended up kissing her little sister. She doesn't want guys kissing Keika and she doesn't want 8man kissing other girls/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is she raping him?</br>  <br>Using voodoo magic to pop up into her thoughts when she schlicks.<br>Or he can compliment her on her legs.</br></br>  <br>Hey wait a minute, you're not me. </br>  <br>Who said you were the only Miurafag?<br> Huh, didn't know archives lasted that long. </br></br>  <br><br>Fapman becomes the MC of yahari. there</br></br>  <br>Is it weird that I want to see Hayama imagine break 8man's shit to finally get his head out of his ass about the girls?</br>    <br> How dare you get attacked and not instantly think to protect yourself from being kissed! <br> Yes, that would imply you would have had to think about kissing her to prevent it. <br> If in such a case you did predict it, then I would still be angry at you for thinking about such a thing. <br> But wait a minute, that would mean that I would have been angry regardless of what you would have done. <br> If I'm angry regardless of what you did then that means my anger must be misplaced. <br> Perhaps I'm not actually angry at you, but at Keika. <br> Sorry for the misunderstanding Hachiman, please forgive my sister's actions and my unwarranted aggression. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I will remind you.</br>  <br><br>didn't mean to quote, just wanted to show what OTP was</br></br>  <br>Try prove it anon</br>  Why was she so flustered in this scene? She was acting like a schoolgirl in front of her crush  Mods please set me free.  If 8man didn't want a romcom to appear then why didn't he prevent Yukino from falling in love with him and have Yui fall out of love with him?  <br>Wait a minute, you're not me. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875414 </br>  I love Oregairu, 8man is so cool. He's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. 8man is a true hero, who sees through society's lies. I love watching Oregairu because I find 8man relatable. I also hate nice girls, and I hate all these superficial teenagers who surround me. Who /8maninhighschool/ here?  I've only watched the S1. Does the cake have any possibilities or should I drop this instead?  <br>It's canon that if 8man fails to date any of the girls, sensei will marry him.</br>  <br>You were MIA for too long</br>  <br>2nd to last episode of season 2 she says she can't watch over him forever.<br>I teared up a little.<br>But she still has a small chance, she can still watch over him if they get married.</br></br></br>  <br>Enough the show is over, move on already</br>  Why did it bother Yukino so much when Yui gave 8man her cookies? They were thank you cookies.  <br>I've been in every thread though.<br><br>Also here, have a gif of Hayama and Yumiko without their hair dye making out behind a witch hat.<br> I might as well embrace this meme at this point. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  There are retards in this thread who actually thought Iroha brought 8man on the date in 10.5 specifically to have a date with him, and not to help get ideas for her newspaper, save money, and have a partner in crime she could blackmail later.  <br>I wish sensei would marry me instead.</br>  <br> Yumiko <br> implying it's not Iroha disguised as Yumiko disguised as Yukino </br></br>  <br>foreshadowing</br>    Whose grave are they standing over?  <br>Haruno, she shot herself after  failing to lead the superior Aryan race to victory </br>  <br>At least it won't be a loveless marriage anymore.</br>  <br> Their own, because they could only be together as ghosts after Yui killed them. </br>  <br>That makes no sense. Why would her parents put her grave next to a poor persons grave?</br>  <br> when she goes into yandere mode she still loses to Yukino <br>even in fanfiction Yui can't win</br></br>  I love Oregairu, Haruno is so cool. She's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. Haruno is literally Hitler, and did nothing wrong. I love watching Oregairu because I find Haruno relatable. I also failed to get into art school, and I hate all these inferior non-Aryan pigs surrounding me. Who /literallyhitler/ here?  <br>Yui buried them alive</br>  <br> Together forever. </br>  What would 8man look like with normal eyes?  <br>Yui vision: Activated</br>  <br>The closest we got to something like that was when 8man tried out the glasses but they cut that from the anime.<br><br>Apparently he's actually attractive once the dead fish eyes are gone.</br></br></br>  <br>8.8/10 turns into 10/10<br>then all the assertive girls will get 8man and his old harem will be forgotten</br></br>  <br>Nah, she sees his bad eyes, but he probably looks more like this to her.</br>  Not a ship, but that's okay. I just want more Meguri-senpai.  <br> once the dead fish eyes are gone. <br>Then what is Yukino supposed to schlick to?<br><br><br>I wonder if Yui really has Yui vision, like him being attractive and him being a super good person no matter what he does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how I figure Yukino sees him.</br>  <br>The fish eyes are her biggest attraction to him.</br>  <br>Shit nigga, reason she fell for him was how nice he actually is underneath the unsociable loner image.<br><br>Dog incident was just the spark. Remember "Hikki did his best!"</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK YUI!</br>  <br>That, and Yui nearly wetted herself when Hikki tried [and failed] to stop the "bullying" Yumiko was doing to her.</br>  When will 8man kill Yukino's cunt?  How different would things be if Saki overheard genuine?<br><br>You think she'd be more proactive in the race for the 8?</br></br>  <br> Cake winning <br> Ever </br></br>  <br>If only he were born ten years earlier.<br><br>Hiratsuka's life is so unfair.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant could 8man do something awful (I don't mean social suicide) to achieve something and she would still see it as him being a good person.<br><br><br>I don't think it would wreck her panties like it did Yukino. It didn't even wreck Yui's and Iroha's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When she lets him. She should have let him in this scene.</br>  <br> a super good person no matter what he does. <br><br>She definitely doesn't see that. Maybe a good person overall, in spite of what he does. "that guilt won't go away" is a perfect example of it; she recognizes when he's done wrong</br></br></br>  <br> How different would things be if Saki overheard genuine? <br> You think she'd be more proactive in the race for the 8? <br>She'd probably think or say something like "That's stupid, what could be more genuine than your family?"</br></br></br>  <br>Fair question.<br><br>I figure she'll try to understand why or desperately keep the image she has of him.</br></br></br>  <br>Jelly Yui and Yukino</br>  Ok, I've been out from yahari threads for a while.<br><br>Has Iroha already won?</br></br>  <br>I thought she only said that because she knows what he did would hurt him in the end, not because she thought what he did was a bad thing.</br>  <br>Need more filters</br>  <br><br>Yup  Tobe has been really kind to her. </br></br>  When will it happen?<br>What will be going on her mind?<br>What will be going on his mind?</br></br>  <br>This isn't tagged with Kawasaki on Pixiv.</br>  <br>she'd have to have a piss-poor understanding of what guilt is, and "dumb genki" tropes aside, I doubt that's the case. She knew it was wrong, but she also knew that was probably the only thing they could do.</br>  <br>You just reminded me of Goth.<br><br> Yui: Hikki-kun, if you promise to reject Yukino and marry me I'll let you out. <br> 8man: Please let me go, I'll reject her. <br> Yui: I'm sorry, but I can't trust you so easily. I'm going to have to bring Yukino here so that you can break up with her and I'll make sure she'll accept it. <br>next day<br> Yui: Hikki~ I brought Yukinon. She's buried right next to you. I think she can you from there. We'll just have to wait for her to wake up first. <br> Yui: C'mon say something. Hikki why so mad? :( <br> Yukino:Yui is that you? What's going on? <br> Yui: Yahallo, Yukinon. I brought you here because Hikki-kun has something important to say to you, but he's not being very talkative right now. I left you some snacks. I'll see you tommorow. <br>next day.<br> Yui: Yahallo. <br> Yukino: Please let me out! <br> Yui: Did you guys have a nice chat while I was gone? <br> Yukino: Is Hikigaya here too? HIKIGAYA HELP ME! GET ME OUT OF HERE! <br> Yui: Tsk! Hikki-kun you need to take responsibility soon. I can't keep buying all of this for you guys. (drops snacks down the large bamboo chutes) <br>next day<br> Yui: Oh man you're really starting to smell bad Hikki. I guess I should have brought you guys some toilet paper and ziploc bags. <br> Yukino: HIKIGAYA PLEASE SAY SOMETHING! <br>next week<br> Yui: I'm all out of my allowance and money from my part-time job. So you better say something now Hikki. <br> Yukino:He told me what he needed to say already. So please let me out. <br> Yui: So did you accept it? <br> Yukino:YES! <br> Yui: Do you promise we'll always be friends? <br> Yukino: Yes. I promise you, hikigaya and I will always be friends. <br> Yui: What...? You liar. Hikki didn't talk to you. He was suppose to tell you that we were going out. Since you accept that you'll never be with him I'll only leave you buried. <br>Yui opens the box and finds bags and bags of unopened snacks. 8man had stabbed himself in the jugular over week ago.<br> Yui Sobbing: You baka. I spent the last of my money to buy you a can of Max Coffee™ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably wouldn't understand why 8man was holding back from being genuine in the first place and make him realize he's being rather selfish and stupid.</br>  <br>I thought she was referring to her own guilt that isn't going away. She is still hung up on the dog thing.</br>  <br>Isn't that only if he doesn't change?</br>  <br><br>Then why did she comfort him then? If he did wrong she should reject him, not affectionately fondle his hair and tell him sweet words.</br></br>  <br>Yui places the can into his open grave and walks away.<br> Yukino: PLEASE DON'T GO. DON'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS. Give me his pen so I can atleast end my life like he did his. <br>Yui gathered up all the kindness in her heart to turn around, pull the pen out of his neck and drop it into Yukino's box. A moment later she hears gasp and gurgle from Yukino's box.<br>She looks back at Hikki's grave one last time, but it's empty except for an open can of Max Coffee™. <br>Thwack! Her body falls into his grave. The lid is slammed shut and dirt gets slowly piled on.<br> 8man: Max Coffee™ really makes you feel alive. <br> This has been a paid commerical by Georgia Coffee. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Whenever Yukino is afraid she instinctively clings to Hachiman like in the trolley, when walking through the dogs, Sable running towards them, the drop in Destinyland.<br><br>What if the next time she gets scared she  holds his hand. </br></br>  <br>Expect 2 paragraph of adjectives</br>  <br> They walk after laying flowers on Yui's grave. <br> Sable gets hit by a car while searching for his master. <br>THE END.<br><br> Tobe gets hit by a truck and no one notices. <br><br>This time, it's really the end!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why didn't 8man just tell Yui straight up that he wasn't that into her instead of leading her on for months on end? If he told her that much earlier he wouldn't have broken her heart.  <br> Tobe gets hit by a truck and no one notices. <br>I've read this before, where did you steal this?</br></br>  Is the novel still sad?  <br>both YYs afraid of Meguri. Good thing she's too busy studying for exams than playing with 8man.</br>  <br> She wanted to keep visiting them as an alumni <br>She wants the 8inch.</br></br>  <br>The logical conclusion of anime's slow progression towards pure advertisement</br>  <br>"Yukinoshita, let's go that way"<br>"Yukinos--??"

Just like the Sun in Spring that melts the snow that Winter left.<br> There's one thing troubling my mind however, why was she watching me? I've always known that she was unique in her own way  <br><br>but I didn't expect her to say something as bizarre as this.<br> "T-that so..." <br> I blurted out a poorly contrived retort to hide my bewilderment. <br> "Hikigaya-kun, I know that most people would think that you're not capable of being loved and even you might know that  <br><br>yourself"<br> With a sharp tone, Yukinoshita had lambasted me the way she used to the first time we met, with an insult that digressed  <br><br>further than my current thoughts.

She has stayed around this long and has suffered more than any other girl over her Hikki. No girl loves Hikki more than her, she would accept him no matter what.</br>  <br>Is someone other than Spyro translated this now?</br>  <br>Outside of Yui no girl (besides Komachi-chan) loves Hikki. Yukinon is dependent and is not interpreting it correctly, Iroha-chan just has a wishy washy crush, and Kawasaki just gets a little tingly over Hikki.<br><br>The only girl for Hikki is Yui.

Thus she cannot fulfill Hachiman's request  <br>Yukino doesn't even care that much about genuine to begin with either.</br>  <br>She probably only cares because Yui and Hachiman do. Its not like she has any thoughts of her own honestly</br>  <br>She barely has her own thoughts on anything. She is only in "love" with 8man because Yui is.</br>  <br>She didn't know Yui was in love with him until the date.</br>  <br> well <br>She knows he likes sweet things and doesn't like superficial things.<br><br>I'm pretty sure; besides Komachi, Shizuka, Haruno, Orimoto, Saki, Saika, and Zai care about him more than she does. <br><br>Heck even Tobe is more of a bro than Yui has ever been.<br> Almost gets NTR'd by Hikitani <br> Doesn't even get mad </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Hachiman ends up with Yukino, then they could never stay friends with Yui. <br><br>Yui would be constant reminder to him of that there used to be a girl like her who loves and cares about him more than everyone else did.</br></br>  Where will you be when Muira wins the 8bowl?  <br> She knows he likes sweet things and doesn't like superficial things. <br>Isn't Yukino the one who points those things out?</br></br>  <br>Shush let them drown in delusions</br>  <br>Re-reading OMK again.</br>  <br>Never<br>Yumiko is not Yukino, She's a good friend<br>Unlike Yukino, She won't steal her best friend crush</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter who pointed it out.<br>That's all she knows about 8man and that he's a siscon.</br></br>  <br>I thought Ebina was closer to Yumiko than Yui is</br>  <br>She loves and cares for both of them. She just wants them to be happy. Not as if she would sabotage their relationship just because she couldn't have him. <br><br>Yui wont be really hurt be losing out of the 8man bowl. She has friends and family to support her and she is emotionally stable.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is such a cutie.<br> tfw Yukinofag and don't want Yui to lose </br></br>  <br><br>Getting real tired of these faggots cropping pics like that in stead doing a spoiler tag or putting censors in it.</br></br>  Who has that Oregairu map with the locations of the characters?  <br>The three are equally close, Yui regularly hangs out with Yumiko on days off.</br>  <br> &gt;tfw Yukinofag and don't want Yui to lose <br>Then 8man should do what is right. If this is his genuine answer then so be it.</br></br>  8man is going to reject Yui and Yukino in order to marry his one true love:<br><br> Max Coffee </br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure; besides Komachi, Shizuka, Haruno, Orimoto, Saki, Saika, and Zai care about him more than she does.  <br><br>Heh.<br>Whatever makes you sleep at night.<br>whoeverfag that is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he could just reject Yukino. Well its more likely Yukino rejects him or falls out of the 8manbowl or something</br>  <br>Yui is a good girl. I am glad it wouldn't hurt her to see Hikki with a girl who isn't her making him happy.</br>  <br>Now I feel like rereading the LN's so I can pinpoint all the times people have helped 8man and had considerations about his feelings whereas Yui was selfish and jealous.<br><br>IE Haruno teasing 8man with her tits and he's enjoying it and she's enjoying his reaction/pretending not to like it. Yui butts in and tells her to stop.</br></br></br>  After the camping trip why did Komachi invite Yukino to go shopping with her and 8man but not Yui?  <br>Date, third time's the charm</br>  8man should just take Yui and Yukino on seperate dates, tests the waters, and decide which girl he harbors stronger feelings for. <br><br>Which girl can make his heart doki doki the most? Or make him feel jealous at the thought of other guys making a move on Yukino/Yui</br></br>  <br> Or make him feel jealous at the thought of other guys making a move on Yukino/Yui <br>This only works with Yui because she turns them down in an extremely roundabout way, Yukino shuts down anyone in a very coldly and straightforward.</br></br>  <br>He should bang them too. You can't tell how you really feel about a girl until you have sex with her.<br><br>Also her should keep this a secret between them.</br></br></br>  <br>I think in the LN they mention Yukino will be going in the same direction as them and Yui will be going in the opposite direction.<br>Also Yukino has money to help pay for groceries.</br></br>  <br>Go ahead and try.<br>I'd like to see whatever bullshit you can come up with.<br><br>BTW that's a really stupid example.<br> Other girl was sexual assaulting 8man <br> Yui told her to stop <br> Somehow it means that she doesn't care about 8man. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What else could it mean? Why would it bother Yui if other women are being flirty with 8man?</br>  <br>Here you go.</br>  <br>It bothers both her and Yukino, go back and read or see Megurin's debut.</br>  <br>She'd get the Yui treatment.</br>  <br>Yukino is selfish and uncaring about 8man too.</br>  <br> Is this Hayato's fetish? </br>  <br> Yukino is selfish and uncaring about 8man too. <br> What is volume 10.5 </br></br>  <br>Selfish and uncaring about 8man.</br>  <br>Thank you</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Hayato was there</br>  <br>She did it all for him.<br><br>Yui:"I don't like seeing you in pain, but what can I do?"<br>Yukino:"Stop hurting yourself or gtfo"</br></br></br></br>  <br> I stared at the ceiling peacefully and Yukinoshita entered my field of vision. As she looked down at me, her face looked somehow anxious. <br> “…Here, take this.” <br> As Yukinoshita spoke, she quietly set something wrapped in a handkerchief near my chest. <br> I lifted my face and took the wrapped object from her; it was slightly warm. The handkerchief was decorated with an adorable design of cat paws. After unwrapping it, what came out was a can of MAX COFFEE. It looked like she tried her best at keeping it warm. <br> Seeing that brought a smile to my face. <br> “Take a breather. You’re not going to get anything done if you’re staring at the screen the entire time. It’d be better if you take a short break,” Yukinoshita said, abruptly looking away. She went back to her seat and resumed her work. <br><br> Selfish and uncaring about 8man. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You seriously need to reread the LN if you really believe that Yui doesn't have any considerations about 8man feeling.<br><br>She is the most considerate girl in the whole cast, <br>to the point that she forgives anything that 8man did to her despite herself getting hurt by it. (e.g. Iroha date)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You responded to bait</br>  <br> she forgives anything that 8man did to her despite herself getting hurt by it. <br>Who else thinks that if she an 8man get together 8man could rough her up and cheat on her and she still wouldn't leave him?</br></br>  <br> Other girl was sexual assaulting 8man <br> teasing someone with your breasts is literally rape <br> this is what yuifags actually believe </br></br></br>  <br>Its a male fantasy anime....</br>  <br>Why don't you go and try to rub your dick on some little girl's shoulder?<br><br>According to your logic I'm pretty this doesn't count as sexual assault.</br></br></br>  <br>This feels like a good time to mention that the club members have intentionally got in the way of 8man and Iroha's interactions in recent volumes.</br>  <br>Do you think the map will have any foreshadowing as to pairings and shit?</br>  <br> breasts are genitals <br> this is what yuifags actually believe </br></br>  <br>I knew Yuifags were a bit soft, but do you really think breast rubbing is equivalent to shoulder dicking?</br>  <br>GTFO feminist scum.<br>I bet you also think that a rape isn't a rape if the male victim enjoyed it.</br></br>  <br>Don't misunderstand, it was for Isshiki-san's sake. Leaving her alone in a room with Hikigaya-kun is dangerous. She shouldn't be so friendly with guys she doesn't like or else they'll get the wrong idea.</br>  <br> Kamakura <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>8man's cat</br>  Why doesn't 8man just get from behind Yui if she is walking away in an emotional moment, hug her, and tell her he loves her. I wan't to see her call him gross.<br><br>What happened to Yui's tsun?</br></br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is objectively the worst girl.  <br> wanting to jump off the wild ride and suffering <br>AHAHA YOU PUSSY</br></br>  <br>late reply, was cooking<br><br><br>Yui is the female equivalent of a "nice guy", she's a nice girl.<br>Swap everyone's gender and Yui would come off as a awkward beta faggot.<br><br>And something like this  would definitely happen.<br> 8man accepts her feelings, but doesn't clearly state he doesn't want their relationship to move forward <br> He falls in love with someone else <br><br><br>I point that shit out all the time.<br><br><br>If 8man and Iroha were left in the club room together<br> He'd sit at the middle of table opposite of her like a normal person.<br>And then he'd engage her in lighthearted conversation about Komachi</br> <br>Thank god YY2 is there to protect her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1.

She will look for a job that is convincingly 15 minutes away from 8man's place and visit when she can.</br>  <br>What a bummer, and here I was hoping for her to be an hero.

I was thinking how I’d like to poke those cheeks of hers, but there was no way I could do that and I shrugged my shoulders instead.  <br><br>How do you think she would have reacted if 8man had poked her cheeks? <br>Would 8man still be a virgin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, she would have raped him then and there in front of Orimoto and Chika.</br>  <br> How do you think she would have reacted <br><br>she would fk him up</br></br></br>  <br><br>this would be her vn route but sadly keika isn't included somehow. the romcom would be taishi and keika asked 8man stuffs.8man could easily handle keika fine due to having little sister while having no clue how to appease taishi's curiosity</br></br>  <br> Poking her cheek <br>She'll force him to take responsibility for his actions.</br></br>  <br>In a good or bad way?</br>  <br><br>she would hold onto him and snap a picture of them close together. use it to work Yukino up next time they meet.<br><br>can you say 8man in deep shit?</br></br></br></br>  What would Yui do if 8man genuinely confessed to her and she believed he truly loved her?<br><br><br> can you say 8man in deep shit? <br>Yukino isn't the jealous type, not would it bother her if she saw her love with her sister being friendly. God help us all if Yui sees it.</br></br></br></br>  Yuieeeeeeeeeeed!!!!! (&gt;o&lt;) <br> (&gt;o&lt;)</br>  <br>Mouth kiss him in front of Hayama, earning his eternal rage, and entertaining Orimoto to no end. If it got out that 8man kissed Haruno you best believe double YY wouldn't let him be by himself with her. <br><br>You think double YY are hands off because they are afraid of being hands on or do they just think there is no way a girl will fall for him?</br></br></br>  <br> Yukino isn't the jealous type <br>Yukino is a pretty jealous girl and she knows what to do when she is, Yui has no idea how to react to such a thing.</br></br>  <br>wow, so platonic.</br>  <br><br><br> The gardens were green and full of flowers. There were stone steps and bamboo walls that resembled the gardens in the old capital like some forgotten temple for blown off course onto Chiba. <br><br> Yukinoshita Haruno led the way. <br><br> It was only now, following her brisk short steps, that I noticed what she was wearing. Elegant and colorful, with a cool blue kimono that appeared a softer shade in the moonlight. Her hair was bound up, and being behind her I was given an exquisite view of her pale nape. <br><br> For a while, we said nothing. Then we turned a corner. <br><br> In an instant, she pulled me close, the distance between our lips were nearly zero. <br><br> I'll admit, for a moment my heart fluttered. <br><br> "You know Hikigaya-kun… when a girl asks a man to be alone with him… there are always other motives." Her breath was sweet. Her skin was smooth, and without pores. It looked ethereal in the pale moonlight. <br><br> I gulped. <br><br> Her hand was pressed against my chest. The scent of her air was causing my mind to wander. <br><br> Flash. <br><br> Huh? What? <br><br> "Oh wow! This is a great picture!" Haruno-san giggled to herself. In her free hand, she held her phone that now possessed a picture of myself and her. If anyone else saw it without the proper context they'd definitely get the wrong idea. <br><br> "H-hey now…" <br><br> "Wow! This is going to go on my Twitter…" <br><br> "That's a bit much… no…" I tried reaching for her phone. I just wanted to hold onto it long enough to delete it. <br><br> "There, there, don't be such a prude," Haruno-san smiled. "Aren't men supposed to be happy they are taking pictures with lovely women? Or perhaps you aren't into women…? Or maybe you think I'm an old onee-chan that's too withered for you, eh? Eh?" <br><br>Continued.......</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was a throw away, Yukino hasn't been known to be jealous otherwise. I am sure she would be fine with 8man fawning all over Haruno or any other girl.</br>  <br><br> The self-deprecating humor suited her as the flower patterns on her bosom blossomed with each jest. It appeared that Haruno-san was a master of masks, able to take any form she so desired or needed. The garden was her natural habitat, full of tall grass and plants, that hides the viper that is her beneath. <br><br> "I just think people might get the wrong idea here…" I said looking around, worried I was getting caught up in her rhythm. If things continued at this pace, I think the situation could become irreversible. <br><br> The woman didn't pay attention to me as she fiddled with her phone. <br><br> "Voila! Uploaded! I'm going to be Twitter famous," Haruno-san giggled to herself. "Aren't you excited Hikigaya-kun? You'll be known as the latest and only in my list of lovers…" <br><br> "Latest… wait, only? Does that mean you've never-?" <br><br> A finger silenced my lips. <br><br> "Feel special now, don't you?" She tucked the phone away into her carry-on bag and walked away to the beat of her own drum. She was happy. <br><br>Something like this could happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay then.</br></br>  <br>This is the only answer.</br>  <br>If Haruno and 8man hooked up Yukino will be finally pleased with Haruno having something better to do and Haruno having something nice. If it happens that way Yukino doesn't even have answer 8man's request or be his genuine, Yukino doesn't have to be part of 8man's genuine at all. Yukino would like that.</br>  Can't wait for volume 12 when  Yumiko  got rejected.<br><br>I wonder how  8man and Iroha would act, seeing they were watching over her through the course of volume 10 and 11.  </br></br>  <br>She won't get rejected because she won't confess, she knows that it's out of the question, that's why she decided to follow him instead.</br>  <br> they both decide to comfort her <br> this and that <br> XXX <br> My 3P ending is wrong as expected </br></br></br></br>  <br>That would make me actually want to kill the fucking cunt.</br>  <br>As comparison<br><br> “Say you, if you’re going out with Yui, then you should understand what the deal is with Ebina, right?” <br><br> “T-T-There’s no way we’re going out or anything…” <br><br> Being suddenly told information about my own well-being that I didn’t know, I hurriedly retorted in response. Oh gosh, what’s with this girl? What’s she saying out of the blue? I-It’s not l-like I’m going out with that girl or anything at all! <br><br> As the gross feeling of droplets of sweat trickled down my body, Miura looked at me and mocked me from the depths of her heart with a laugh. <br><br> “What exactly are you misunderstanding here? Gross. Like Yui and Hikio could be going out. That’s not the issue, you know? I’m talking about Yui once you actually talk to her. Gross.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So this is the big question, between Yui and Yukino who would take the rejection and not being the chosen one the worse? I think it would be Yui, she is heavily invested in her relationship with Hikki. Yukino would be fine.  <br>But she will confess. But I guess you are an EOP and didn't read volume 11 (at least up to Iroha giving 8man giri-choco scene). It was made obvious that Miura is going to confess sooner or later.</br>  <br>The cunt is the king of suffering, haven't you already known it already?<br><br> The only way to resolve his (and Haruno too) issues is to fix Yukino's dependency issue. Only after he get rejected by Yukino (after cured) this time he can finally accept love. </br></br></br>  <br>Kirito</br>  What happened here, /a/ ?  <br>I'm not EOP  I just can't read moon. </br>  Dumping manga irohasu  <br><br><br>I like how you think anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I am ESL and I can still read moon. What's your excuse now?</br>      today i come to sadly accept that i am an Yui fag<br>she is not the best girl, but i desperately need 8man to love her, to hug her and tell her everything is gonna be alright.</br>     Yukinoshita Yukino <br><br> Likes: Pan-san, cats <br><br> Turnoffs: Boys with dead fish eyes, boys who like sweet things, boys that want something genuine </br></br></br></br>  <br> What would Yui do if 8man genuinely confessed to her and she believed he truly loved her? <br><br>Obvious outcome would be a happy development if they both accept each other's feelings. Yukino's matter would heavily sway this, depending on whether the confession happens before or after her request is solved. <br><br> Yukino isn't the jealous type <br><br>she is, if not unconsciously so. Meguri being friendly in the club, isshiki's birthday etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd playfully bite his finger.<br>"You need to be gentle with girls. Like this."<br>She'd grab his hold his hand in place and caress it with her face.<br>"But I'm a big girl, so I don't mind if you get a little rough with me."<br><br>Haruno decides to stay and eat there with 8man. He tells her he only came to study and have some Max Coffee™. They decide to share a sammie and cake. <br><br>Then the rest of the night would be 8man being deredere with Haruno. Holding hands and playing footsies under the table while Haruno talks to Orimoto's friend about Hayama.<br><br>Orimoto bursts into laughter "Hey Hikigaya you're having dinner with three cute girls. If people from junior high heard about this, they'd freak out. Dayone~."<br><br>"Heh, I bet."<br><br>"Dahling, Ahh~&lt;3." Haruno cuts off a piece of cake and presents it to 8man, but he's a bit embarrassed. <br>She ends up getting frosting on his cheeks and he doesn't hesitate to stick a finger into the cake and dab her on the nose.<br><br>Orimoto gets his attention and leans in real close to whisper to him, "Y'know, I'd never really think I'd see you having so much fun. When you smile like, you don't look half-bad, almost boyfriend material. It's hard to believe she's not your girlfriend. Too bad, dayone.<br><br>8man pulls away and tries to hide his smile.<br><br>Haruno grabs his head and licks off the frosting. "What were you talking about?"<br><br>"Nothing really, you still have some frosting on your nose." With Haruno still holding his face lose to hers he barely mangaes to reach the tip of her nose with his tongue.<br>"We were just talking about how you're not my girlfriend. Because you're my Fiancée." <br><br>Orimoto can't help but blush at all the lewdness that had unfolded in front of her"D-Dayone~"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Hmm you say that but you still haven't gotten me a ring yet. See." She playfully shoves her hand into his face, emphasizing her ring finger.<br><br>8man bit down on it hard enough to leave some marks "There you go, now I just need to meet your parents and wait until I turn 18."<br><br>"I don't like boys who don't keep their word." She goes in for a kiss. He doesn't resist, in fact he doesn't let her go."I think we should go somewhere else now."<br><br>"T-T-Time out. I know you two are still in love, but Hikigaya is still underage and I don't think he has enough experience. So you should really think about safety first. DAYONE!"<br><br>"Then you can come along with us to make sure we're being safe. Dayone~&lt;3. You don't mind since you used to like her. Ne~.<br><br>"I guess I don't."<br><br>"Orimoto's friend, you can come too to make sure Orimoto is being safe."<br><br>"What about Hayama-kun..." Her friend tags along sulkily.<br><br>After paying for their bills, they make their way to a love hotel. 8man stops at the vending machines in the lobby while Haruno fills out the paperwork. They get to the room.<br><br>"Did you get enough condoms? What's that in the other bag."<br><br>"We're going to need this, if we're planning to spend the whole night. Max Coffee™ it gives you the energy you need. And these are new Georgia brand condoms in various flavors."<br><br> Share a Max Coffee™, it really brings people closer together.<br>This has been a paid lblaiaoihabn;awe.</br> <br>Goddamn I type too slow. Someone else beat me to the punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so isshiki is a weasel, certainly resembles that in the art of the girls with kemonomimi.</br>  <br>The time when Iroha was still a cute little kouhai.<br><br> Yet 8man at a first glance instantly knew that she was dangerous. Guess this is another series of "How I met your mother" </br></br></br>  <br>What are her turnons?</br>  <br>1/2</br>  <br>But that means she'll never get to see her kids graduate highschool/college and get married.  ;_; </br>  <br>2/2<br><br>"That's the way, son, How I Met Your Mother."</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have an on switch.</br>  <br>She was pretty damn scary.</br>  <br>son: What, so cliched like that? And you dare say your romcom was wrong as you expected?<br><br>father:  But son, she is not really your mother. </br></br></br>  <br>Yes,  Haruno's shadow copy  was pretty scary. I have to agree on that.</br>  <br>Besides the simple grammar mistakes, this is pretty good.<br><br>This one too lewd for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Same guy.<br>I really like this scene.<br>"She'll still be reading her books in this room, even if the world ends."<br>That's why I think both are perfect for each other.<br>They connect in a way that no one else can.<br>They get along even if they fight superficially.<br><br> But that's my own opinion which may vary from others </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It just occurred to me that both Yukino and 8man at the start of the series essentially had the same solution to different problems. It seems however that Yukino's barriers were stronger than his.</br>  <br>Because that was not the real Yukino you dumb fuck.<br><br>That's just a shell, a mere shallow copy of her sister.<br><br>So you are saying 8man and Haruno should be a couple, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with 8man? Those aren't dead fish eyes.</br>  <br>Pretty sure damn Haruno has never acted like that at all.<br><br>Yukino being a loner, reading on her own all day and insulting 8man is something she did on her own without any influence.</br></br></br>  <br>ayyy</br>  <br>Shut up Yui, you don't even like his eyes.</br>  Why does a girl who has been confessed to countless times by better looking guys than 8man get embarrassed by a comment of her being cute by some creep with dead fish eyes?  <br>Dead fish eyes are okay if it's Hikki's.</br>  <br>because that manga tried to copy Bakemonogatari.</br>  <br>Yui doesn't like everything Hikki. I bet she hates his posture, his eyes, his awful attitude etc.<br><br>In fact why does she even like him? I bet she just has a simple crush on him.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he makes her heart go doki doki</br>  <br> Yukino's matter would heavily sway this <br>Would she be happy above all else?<br><br>What if they solve Yukino's problem and 8man was left with A) Yukino and B) Yui to end the series and he chose B?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Learned who he really was and fell for that. Doesn't want to see him hurt himself. Worries for him.</br>  <br/>  <br>So how is it different than a crush? All she is is infatuated with him and finds him interesting. She doesn't really want to be by his side to support him, she doesn't want to be with him just to be with him. If he got a GF that wasn't her she wouldn't be that bothered by it.</br>  <br>Didn't you see when she thought Yukino was going out with him? She didn't even want to hear about it. She clearly does want to be with him. But now she also sees that her friend is having issues that need to be resolved. There are also moments where she thinks she's not progressing because she sees her friend/rival get some alone time with him.</br>  <br>That's just crush alright. But it's hard to get over your first crush unless you tasted some rejection or depression.<br><br>So I bet even when Yui and 8man became a couple, they will break up soon after.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be happy, if she's sure Yukino isn't looking to Hikki for anything else than friendship. By which Yukino and Yui has to make it clear their feelings for each other and towards Hikki.</br>  <br>Hikki holding off on her advances after so many times already already counts as rejections. And she's not asking anything more other than wanting him to take her up on her offers.</br>  <br> if she's sure Yukino isn't looking to Hikki for anything else than friendship. <br>Even if 8man loved Yui but if Yukino still loved 8man she wouldn't accept? I think she would accept 8man and try to smooth things over with Yukino rather than reject 8man just because Yukino exists.<br><br><br> She didn't even want to hear about it <br>She was being considerate. It didn't eat her up inside to see him with another woman. <br><br>Am I The only one who thinks that there won't be any hard feelings or hurt feelings?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i would love a Miura end. Iroha fag from the bottom of my heart, but i like to watch a girl love a freak cos she hust love him. No motives, no reasons, no mind. Just and pure wild feel of love.</br>  <br>There will be hurt feelings no matter what but they won't be as harsh as they would've been before.</br>    <br> End of vol 10 <br>8man chooses one over the other<br><br> End of vol 11 <br>8man chooses one over the other. <br><br>How would things change?<br><br><br>She was being nice and didn't think she should intrude on their nice little romance as a third wheel. She was bothered by that, she wasn't bothered that 8man was with another girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a good take on that situation. Climax for Yui's development as well since the whole reason she couldn't speak her mind at the start was because she was too mindful of how other people are instead of being herself. <br><br>Which does mirror abit of Hikki's loner excuse of not wanting to bother other people by making himself noticed. Huh. perhaps Yui and Hikki's development is really subtle and linked if that's true.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a good take on that situation <br>How would that take be good? It would be frustrating and awful. <br><br>I thought she couldn't speak her mind was because of how little she thought of herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She was being considerate. It didn't eat her up inside to see him with another woman. <br>It didn't eat her up inside at that time because she didn't even know them for that long but it still hurt her.<br><br>In the LN the misunderstanding looked pretty bigger with the way Yukino was clinging to 8man's back then going on about wanting to tell her to come to the club to talk about "us".</br></br></br></br>  <br> It didn't eat her up inside at that time because she didn't even know them for that long but it still hurt her. <br>So are you implying it would eat her up on the inside now that she knows them so well?<br><br>Just because it was a huge misunderstanding that doesn't mean her actions weren't based off of consideration rather than hurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  she would accept 8man and try to smooth things over with Yukino rather than reject 8man just because Yukino exists. <br><br>Her talk with Miura the next episode showed it more clearly she holds herself back because of other people. If it's about her self-esteem issue, her giving cookies to Hikki shows she's already doing something about it. <br><br>vol 11's last scenes can be read a one giant roundabout way of her holding herself back again. <br><br>Saving grace was she had a motive to achieve behind it, whether the motive was good or bad is up to your take.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> one giant roundabout way of her holding herself back again. <br>And Hikki told her that it was not kosher to do that sort of thing anymore out of not it being genuine.<br><br>Her giving him those cookies out of "thanks" will be a huge mistep even if Yukino, me, you, Yui, and everyone else but Hikki knew damn well they were not "thanks" cookies.<br><br>  whether the motive was good or bad is up to your take. <br>I imagine if this were an eroge that would the choice that gave a normal end if Hikki didn't say anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First season was so much fun</br>  <br>Her finally saying "I want this, whatever happens happens" would be great even if she failed because at least she tried.</br>  Iroha is so fucking lewd.<br><br> I love it </br></br>  <br>Is Iroha going to do things to his 8? Why? I thought she liked Hayama, unless this is practice.</br>  <br>Why Yui called herself unfair? Why 8man said he won't let her call herself unfair? Did he know what is this "unfair" is all about?</br>  <br>she went in knowing it wouldn't be genuine. My point is she made a stand about what she wanted instead of what other people wanted to hear.<br><br>if the anime wasn't clear, the TL of chapter 9 showed Hikki knew better it wasn't just thanks cookies.</br></br></br>  <br>Might as well TL it too since I have nothing else to do.<br><br> I've been interested since some time ago.. <br> Doesn't it become haard? <br><br> Senpai's t.h.i.n.g. / This part of senpai. <br><br> Haah?! Wait a moment, yoou! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for practice.<br><br><br>I get your point. I want Yui to develop a more assertive streak for better or worse. I have no clue she wants but it will be nice once she's out with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui was always been assertive. It just that it wasn't in your face and the competition was non-exist. She asked for a date and reminded 8man of it.<br><br>It just that she tends to avoid conflict. So, once she felt that she was having a conflict of interest, she was willing to kill any chances she had.</br></br></br>  <br>This is just my assumption from Vol 11 chapter 9 TL.<br><br> Why Yui called herself unfair?  <br><br>Because Yui forcing them making decision that will affect their relationship without 8man and Yukino are preparing theirself for it.<br><br> Why 8man said he won't let her call herself unfair?  <br><br>Because 8man have faith on Yui already thinking through her action is the best way to solve their problem.<br><br> Did he know what this unfair is all about? <br><br>Yes. I think he did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  8man, if there are two flowers you must pluck them both, Nothing is stopping you.  <br> flowers <br> not plastic replicas </br></br>  <br>8man only interested to go on "someday" with Yui only.</br>  <br>Is that, according to you, genuine?</br>  <br>If he wants it and they want it. It doesn't have to fit society to be genuine, it is their feelings that matter.</br>  <br>He has a favorite though, and neither of them are interested in being a 2nd wife.</br>  <br> He has a favorite though, <br>Hasn't been established<br><br> neither of them are interested in being a 2nd wife. <br>We don't know that. It hasn't been shown that the girls think about having him to themselves with no other girl. They are friends so it would work out somehow and neither has a jealous streak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think there would be no hard feelings for another girl?<br>Look at reality. Reality is not a fairy tale where amazing things happen just for the sake of convenience.</br></br>  <br>It has nothing to do with hard feelings, it has everything to do with what is right. This isn't a convenient ending, it is the correct one.</br>  <br>Claiming he didn't have a favorite would be a lie.<br><br>Let me paint a picture, they all go skydiving and the girls' parachute don't open.<br><br>8man has enough time to make his way to one of them and save them. In that instance he would be forced to make a decision and there's no way in hell his decision would be "Sorry but I like you both equally so I have no choice but to let you both die because I can't pick a favorite."</br></br></br></br></br>  What does this mean?<br> Is this subtle foreshadowing? </br>  <br>It has nothing to do with what is right either. It's about something they want. Yui already told what she wanted, Yukino about to say what she wants and the finale, we'll have what 8man desired.</br>  <br>You know it's really not that difficult to take snapshots in mpc or vlc.</br>  <br> Let me paint a picture, they all go skydiving and the girls' parachute don't open. <br>Let them both die then sue the company for everything they got.</br></br>  <br> It's about something they want. <br>And this could be the ending if they want it. "Everything" Yui said could go many ways.</br></br>  manga Yui.

Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>What are you talking about dubs kun?</br>  Anyone here ordered this yet?  <br>Every little bit matters. Why do you think /d/ is now a shithole full of furries, ERPers and western art?</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>You're incredibly late to the party.</br>  I'm very lazy about watching anime. How do I fix this? I have a fairy decent sized list of things to watch, but I always end up fucking around on 4chan instead. I guess I haven't found any series that really "stuck" with me for a while, or I might find a series that has an uninteresting first episode and I end up dropping it. I do like anime, I'm just lazy about watching it. What do?<br><br> If this thread is unallowed just let it die pls no ban </br></br>  <br>Thanks for the advice, gonna watch Overlord now, heard it mentioned and it looks pretty good. Giving something 3 episodes sounds better then just one even though a lot of the stuff I like had a good first episode, its not really fair to judge a show that way</br>  <br>It's not like someone pays you for watching your chinese cartoons so maybe if you are not in a mood for something just don't force yourself.</br>  <br>You just power through it, reminding yourself that if you finish this anime, you have one more thing to talk about on /a/.<br><br>Once in a very rare blue moon you find an anime that you literally cannot stop watching, even for /a/, but you can't watch anime expecting that to be the case even 5% of the time.</br></br></br>  Anime is shit and it's not your fault you can't seem to feel attached to any show, just think about watching anything next time you procrastinate.  <br>Just block 4chan in your hosts file or actually sit away from your computer. Get an Xbox controller and map the buttons to control your media player then sit far enough away from the screen so you can't reach the keyboard. That way you can still pause adjust volume and take screenshots while not being tempted to do anything else by having the keyboard or mouse within reach.</br>  Anon, I love you.  <br>It's not on screen, but you can infer it from the fade out at the end.</br>  <br>well thats not much to go on...</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/FHFDZbrAsSM  [ ]<br><br>I'm so fucking confused</br></br></br>  <br>Is the script not enough? <br><br>Context-wise, there was a fade to night and then Ufotable posted that on their twitter.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DPt<wbr>-4Nwght0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Implications.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
