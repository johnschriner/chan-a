[ Anon, can you just be human?  <br>I don't care what anyone says<br><br>Halo Legends was alright</br></br></br>  <br>It certainly was, had it's ups and downs for sure, but it was overall pretty enjoyable.</br>  <br>i think this was my personal favorite from the episodes</br>  Crap I gotta get around to finally watching this  <br><br>That shonen battle episode was easily the best shit.</br></br>  <br>Goddammit this scene got me right in the heart.</br>  <br> mfw Halo Legends is one of the only, and best modern military anime </br>  <br>I loved the one where the spartan and ODST's go assassinate some high prophet. <br><br>That spartan was a qt</br></br></br>  <br> What about Gate? ignore the nippon stonk </br>    <br>This is honestly a travesty.

Or am I fucking up and forgetting one of them?</br>  <br><br>The parody with spartan-1337</br></br>  <br> only one episode so far, to early to tell but they did dumb down the destruction/gore seen in the manga </br>  The DBZ parody episode of this show was fucking crazy  <br>It could be either Spartan-1337 or the bit with the Samurai Elites.<br><br><br>I like Halo Legends besides the Samurai Elites. That bit gave me cancer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah amazon babes</br>  <br><br>I personally liked Prototype more but yeah, the parody episode was pretty damn amusing.<br><br><br>That and the pagoda-syle covie houses in The Babysitter were fucking awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw no gentle femdom doujins of her with the manlet ODST </br></br>  <br>i think <br>is referring to this </br></br>  <br><br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br> modern <br> year 2500 <br> modern <br><br>unless you mean recently made</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unless you mean recently made <br><br>I did</br></br></br>  <br>then carry on anon, carry on</br>  Call me a faggot but Origins ll always gets me. The soundtrack of Halo is just too good.  <br>don't worry anon. i won't judge. Everytime I hear the Halo 3 menu music I tear up. I've always liked the feeling of hopelessness and mystery that the early Halo media caused. The books by Nylund we're great. My personal favorite is The Babysitter followed by Homecoming because i've always liked the dynamic of ODST resentment for spartans.</br>  YFW BASED HALO EVEN HAS BASED COMMERCIALS<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0cr<wbr>bRn_USQg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br> 1337 </br></br></br></br></br>  This should have been the mantis.

Then the MCC announcement, which looked like it was going to be my biggest video game wish turned into reality, until it released and was the most disappointing thing I've ever bought. MCC being unplayable for months and having absolute shit features destroyed any hope of a big resurgence in the old Halo community.<br><br>Now they're gonna bait me into getting excited for Halo 5 by including Chief's squad.

Sucks we wont ever get to see Kurt animated. Heres to hoping we get some sort of movie or series based off Ghost of Onyx. Kurt is based as fuck. Most bad ass Spartan of them all.</br>  <br>Linda was always described as a Red head anon, although she shouldn't have that man face.</br>  <br>Its the opposite for me. Sure, they're finally in a game, but half the game won't even be about them, it'll be about Locke's squad that no one gives a shit about except for Buck. And knowing 343 they could very well end up killing some or all of blue team by the end of it.<br><br>I'd seriously consider getting an xbone for blue team, but not for THIS.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll always have our memories anon. And each other.<br><br><br>Lore may have been utterly fucked in that game but damn if it wasn't a fun as hell game. Hell, even in the quasi clusterfuck of balancing in the beta it was still shitloads of fun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>On the plus side Nathan Fillion is a damn good actor and him being Buck should have enough Charisma to easily carry all of the Locke missions. I hope they cast properly for Kelly, Fred, and Linda's voices.</br>  <br>If those bastards kill off a Blue Team member they better make sure they go out like a total hard ass. They have some big shoes to fill in order to top Kurt and Sam's deaths.</br>  <br>Even though it was a clusterfuck of a story and messed up a ton of the lore it still managed to really capture the hopelessness of Reach. Seeing your team slowly getting picked off one after the other as the Covenant only got bigger and bigger was really well done. The scene where the spartan two in your team died sacrificing himself only to have dozens of more ships appear was extremely impactful and nailed the theme of Reach.</br>  <br><br><br>Honestly, I never cared for the story in any of the games all that much. I was always in it for the split-screen LAN multiplayer with my buddies, whether it was playing 4v4 CTF in Halo 1, 2, 3 or running an 8 man big team battle squad into matchmaking on Reach, the fun has always been in local multiplayer.<br><br>I and all my friends thought that Halo 4 had terrible multiplayer in all aspects (and shitty framerates in split screen) so we skipped it.<br><br>Halo 5 Multiplayer Beta got all of us excited for Halo again, because the combat felt a lot more like Halo than Halo 4 (kill-cams and iron sights aside) and the added movement options and promised forge enhancements added a lot to the game and promised lots of fun in multiplayer.<br><br>Then they announced that they'd be sacrificing split-screen to the graphics gods, and that pretty much killed Halo 5 for us.<br><br>As for Halo: Legends, it was alright in places (and pretty bad in other places) but overall it would have been better if it was a little less anime and a little more Halo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wow, im actually seeing a full on Halo thread on /a/. This board really does have great taste. I actually always thought that Halo has an extremely well written and deep lore. Probably one of the best ones ive seen in a video game franchise. Glad to see im not the only one on here who thinks so.  Eric Nylund, please come back.  Can anyone explain just what the fuck the Flood is?  <br>I gained a lot more appreciation for Reach after Halo 4 came out. God damn I miss the days of old Bungie. Bnet was my internet home before 4chan, I browsed those forums every day and read all of the weekly updates. Now new Bungie is disgusting and their website has become an abomination.</br>  <br>Obligatory space zombie/parasites</br>  <br>A parasitic organism that takes over the hosts body. Sort of a hivemind as it is controlled and lead by the gravemind.</br>  <br> Now new Bungie is disgusting and their website has become an abomination. <br>Destiny had so much potential, too. It could have been as good as the original Planetside, but instead they made a shitty PSO with a Call of Duty-ish multiplayer tacked on.</br></br>  <br> PAN UP PAN UP PAN UP <br><br>LRN2DIRECTION TBH</br></br></br>  <br>The Halo franchise has the best lore of any well-known sci-fi franchise since Star Wars IMO.</br>  <br>Bungie's version<br> An extragalactic threat that waged war with the Forerunners. It infects organic hosts and takes over their nervous system. <br>343 version<br> the precursors liquified themselves and turned into the flood to test the forerunners and the ancient humans and the ancient humans were the ones who passed the test, not the forerunners so the didact destroyed them but our lore is so fucked up we have to make two didacts now xD </br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally nothing wrong with the expanded version; now that the Flood isn't just another generic hivemind</br>  <br>Starcraft was really popular when Halo: CE was developed. It's basically Bungie's version of the Zerg.</br>   tfw no qt 3.14 Spartan waifu   <br>That is some damn good taste you got there anon. I completely agree. Halo is a universe that is just begging for stuff to be made about it. Heres to hopefully getting a movie of The Fall of Reach.</br>  <br>Probably a pretty accurate analysis, seeing how Halo started life as an RTS.</br>  <br>Originally they were some threat that came from another Galaxy. In the current lore they're the remnants of a race called the Precursors. the precursors went around raising up budding civilizations and seeding worlds and followed what they called The Mantle of protection which basically was to protect the Galaxy and their creations. The forernners and Humanity were both uplifted by them. The forerunners were Daddy's favorite child for a while and were supposed to inherit the Mantle but the Precursors saw their bullshit and how they treated other races and decided humanity would get it. The Forerunners said Fuck You and killed them all. Some escaped and turned themselves into a powder that would reform into themselves later and spread outside the Galaxy. the rage and fear pent up in the race that never expected it however, turned this powder into a parasite. Eventually space humans find the powder and use it to domesticate animals until shit starts going wrong. They run from the flood into forerunner space and dont tell them about it. Forerunners once again say fuck you and fight humanity because humanity glasses one planet and doesn't tell them about the flood. Humanity gets rofl stomped and devolved back to earth, then split into races to prevent us from going back to space. We don't tell them about the flood and they reappear to destroy forerunners and such.</br>  <br>You mean, the Zerg and the Flood are just ripoffs of the Tyranids</br>  <br>Except humans didn't pass the test, and it wasn't a test but a revenge. The precursors that went mad were jerks, while the forerunners were arrogant space elves.</br>  <br>Star Wars is an awfully low bar to set.<br><br>Star Wars media was best when it stepped away from the established lore.</br></br></br>  <br>I knew this was going to pop up as soon as I read .</br>   there will never be a 12/24/50 episode Halo series following a Spartan II and his progression from abducted child to super soldier <br><br>I'd give it to Kyoani with as much budget as they could possibly use.</br></br>  <br>Aren't tyranids just ripoffs of the arachnids from Starship Troopers? Like how the humanity-zerg-protoss trio is the same ripoff of the novel's races.</br>  <br>More like the Zerg and the Tyranids ripped off the Xenomorphs and the Bugs and each other over several iterations. Original Tyranids are markedly different from current day Tyranids and the Starcraft II Zerg have more than a few art choices inspired by the newer Tyranids that were absent in their original incarnation (most notably, they're a lot more purple and spikey).<br><br>It's never as simple as it seems.</br></br></br>  <br>Pre-343 lore, it was left vague and implied they might be extragalactic.<br><br>Post-343... There were super advanced aliens called Precursors that went around playing god. They made humans and forerunners, and picked humans to inherent the galaxy. This caused the forerunners to chimp out and genocide them. Some survived by turning themselves into powder. Ancient humans found the powder and put on their pets, which turned into the first flood outbreak. Turns out staying in powdermode for so long turned them into crazy assholes that just want all their creations to suffer as one big flesh blob.</br></br></br>  <br>What are the odds of us ever getting a full 24 episode anime series based around The Fall of Reach being done by a competent animation studio? Inb4 0%</br>  <br>Actually 2nd from the left  is supposed to be a waifu. And the reason the Dub for Persona Dancing has a different Rise.</br>  <br> you'll never be a strong alpha spartan with a tsundere ODST gf <br> you'll never tease her that she can't even lift a brute shot <br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>The Fall of Reach would work perfectly as a movie. There's no reason not to go through with it. A Halo movie has been teased and talked about for like 8 years now, they should just do it. <br><br>Most video game franchises would suck as movies, but Halo has enough lore and source material for it to be good.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah 0%<br><br>And as we draw ever closer to October I suspect we won't get that live action Spielberg series that is supposedly still in the works. Only with nothing to show for it.</br></br></br>  <br>0%</br>  <br>Wasn't that Nightfall? I didn't watch it.</br>  <br>I don't really mind 343i's additions to the prehistoric Halo lore, they had to add a lot of detail that Bungie simply omitted, and if it was Bungie adding that detail, they would have probably done something similar. When universes grow, part of it inevitably get stupid and confusing.<br><br>On the other hand what I can't stand about 343i is their art direction, Bungie's aesthetic was clean and utilitarian, and alien stuff looked alien and ornamental but still clean and pleasing to the eye. 343 on the other hand went overboard with tiny details and stuffing their models full of normal maps and glowy bits and shit, and their aliens are just generic "look at me I'm so alien even my shit glows orange," and it's all really busy and garish and taxing to the eye particularly in combat.</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully 0% for kyoani animating it</br>  <br>No, Nightfall was Ridley I think. And it was fucking trash as expected. Had so little to do with anything Halo that you could have changed a few names, removed verbal references, etc, and nobody would even know it was related.</br>  <br>If you were a Spartan then chances are that you'd become asexual.</br>  <br>While I agree that Halo is the new hotness and that Star Wars' EU lore is amazing, what about 40k?</br>  <br>I haven't been keeping up, are Spartan-II's still impotent from all the strength treatments and the sex-drive suppression drugs, or did 343i retcon that out?</br>  <br>I'd be okay with Kyoani doing it if they spent the amount of detail they did with those hibike webms on ODST and Spartan armors instead. My dick would explode to see some high quality Mark IV or V</br>  <br> KyoAni SoL set on Reach shortly before the Covenant invade <br>I never knew I wanted this so much</br></br>  <br>Honestly the fact that we somehow havent gotten a movie of Fall of Reach with how solid the source material is yet is just down right saddening. Halo is one of the few video game franchises that is literally begging to have movies made of it due to how tight and good the source material is.</br>  <br>Still the worst shit fanbase.</br>  Off-topic threads on /a/ are the best.  <br>After seeing what KyoAni can do in the action scenes from Kyoukai no Kanata I would donate money to get them to make a Halo series.<br> KyoAni adds in Slice of Life elements because it's KyoAni. <br> SoL of the Spartan IIs hanging out and training together. <br>Would actually be really entertaining.<br><br><br>Japan would have to care about Halo first, and since the Japanese hate Xbox none of them care about Halo. So yeah I'm gonna go with 0%.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still like that, although Spartan II's have been able to decommission them selves and have their implants removed since the Graphic novel and that one guy in Nightfall.</br>  <br>40k isn't really sci-fi (well, neither is Star Wars, but whatever) and it's not particularly interesting lore-wise. Everything is really predictable and samey (aside from details) and there's basically two archetypes, once-glorious civilization struggling to survive or unfathomable horrors from the depths of space that would fuck up everybody if only they just got their shit together.</br>  <br>To my knowledge I believe so. I know that most of the remaining Spartan-II's arent actually that old since they had multiple treatments done to rapidly induce growth. Its been awhile though since I read the books so I could be off.</br>  <br> has a real animu made by elevens <br> off-topic <br><br>You wut m8?<br><br><br>Kyoani could nail it. They still have enough mecha capability to make the armor look fantastic. And yeah some SoL elements to break up the horrendous suffering would be good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There were never any "sex-drive suppression" drugs. That was just a possible side effect from one of the augmentations that didn't necessarily happen to all (if any) of them.<br><br>Their upbringing probably curbed their sex life more than the enhancements.</br></br></br>  <br> aren't that old <br>Isn't John like 50-60 now, not including time spent in slipspace/cryo?</br></br>  <br>Nigga what are you talking about?<br>Halo is basically the only game they actually like out of the xbox line up, not counting those timed exclusive Idolmasters and Tales of Vesperia.<br>They actually took the time to write the OVAs for it. They could of said no you know?</br></br></br>  <br> There were never any "sex-drive suppression" drugs <br>IIRC, it was specifically mentioned in one of the books that their sex drive was suppressed (although I don't recall if they said anything about drugs or mental conditioning or plain old education) to make them better warriors, but I could be wrong since Halo 3 was still new when I read any of the Halo books.</br></br>  <br>Mid 40s</br>  <br><br>deus ex machina</br></br>   spartan IIs fucking <br>It would be an aggressive pile of muscle, with skin as white as milk and crisscrossed with scars.</br>  <br>Wasn't it a side effect of the pituitary augments or whatever?</br>  <br>Don't see whats so off-topic about discussing Halo in a thread on the Halo anime shorts.</br>  <br>He's 46 years old not including cryo. With it I think his body is just reaching 40.</br>  <br>Yeah true I guess I'm retarded. I need to watch Halo Legends. I forgot that it even existed until this thread reminded me. Gonna download it now.<br><br>I raise my odds to 2%.</br></br></br>  <br>They were paid by the gaijins to do it, they didn't want to make it</br>  <br>Maybe, the two factoids I remember from that time is that all active Spartan-IIs were impotent and that the women were indistinguishable from the men when wearing armor (any armor, not just MJOLNIR).</br>  <br>I don't think so, since they artificially induced puberty they had to also repress sex drive with other drugs.<br><br><br>You just reminded me I really want to see spartan smile and that i'm mad 343 makes it easy for you to tell the women from the men in their armors.</br></br></br></br>   tfw Halo peaked in popularity back in 2008 and no movie was made. <br> tfw it is now 2015 and Halo isn't the king anymore, meaning that with every passing year the chance of a Halo movie being made grows smaller and smaller. Especially since 343 keeps fucking up and destroying the franchise. </br>  <br>Nigga of course they got paid for it, but they could of declined.<br>Time used making the OVAs could be used to be paid making something else, they were all well known directors and writers after all.</br></br>  <br>God, if they made a well-animated Halo anime series and put in the Spartan-smile I'd be so goddamn happy.</br>  <br>with 343 trying to focus on the expanded universe we better at least get an Oly Oly Oxen Free too.</br>    <br><br>I dont remember much about the Spartan-ll's augments but I do remember that the Spartan 3's got fucked over and were given some extremely brutal and fucked up augments.The only thing I remember about the Spartan-ll's treatments where that they were really nasty and had a terribly low survival chance. If I recall even some of the people who did survive came out fucked up in some way or another.</br></br>  <br>Japs referenced Halo in To love ru which is mad popular.</br>  <br>Wasn't the fact you couldn't tell them apart because of the unisex focus of the armor?<br>Anyway it was bungie that started the trend anyway with Reach and those spartan "ASSets"<br>In Halo 3 it kept with the lore and choosing female would just change the spartan's voice.</br></br></br>  <br> spartan IVs.jpg </br>    <br>No, Spartan-II women were all huge and manly due to all the augments they went through to make them more effective combatants.</br>  <br> there will never be a movie  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/1_5csXHegb0  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Spartan II was the brutal under the knife type of augs.<br>Spartan III where the streamlined version that did away with that granting a 100% success rate but a shorter and weaker result, still miles ahead of a regular human though.</br></br>  <br>I think I remember hearing somewhere that Halo is actually pretty popular in Japan. Its one of the few Xbox titles that Japan really likes. If I recall a few of the directors working on Halo Legends actually liked Halo's story. Though I could be wrong. Its been awhile since I heard that.</br>  <br>Really? I've never seen that series but I'm curious, what was the reference?</br>  <br>Technicacally Cat was a III not a II and didn't receive the same enhancements that the IIs did which was one reason she wasnt 7ft tall like Jorge.</br>   343 Industries.   <br>It was in ep 5 of the first series iirc. It was two shots, one with MC posing with the assault rifle, the other one was a space battle around High Charity.</br>  <br>To call the Spartan lll augments streamlined isnt necessarily true. When Kurt saw some of the augments and chemicals they were pumping into the Spartan lll's he was visibly bothered by it and even commented asking why they were using those. The Spartan lll's were made faster and instead of being augmented to be super soldiers that were hard to kill, they pumped them with chemicals and augments that forcefully kept them alive even after sustaining lethal damage until the adrenaline wore off. They were designed to be suicide soldiers. They sent hundreds of them on suicide attacks with almost zero chance of survival. They werent even given proper armor. They were given shitty SPI armor that couldnt even take a single plasma pistol shot.</br>  <br>Spartan 3 augmentations were much safer than the II augmentations, and almost as good. What really fucked some of them over was an extra drug that let them out-berserk brutes.</br>  <br>Didn't the spartan-II Maria from the first Graphic Novel look pretty normal despite the armor? Hell, hadn't she retired?<br><br>Hell, speaking of the original Graphic Novel, is all of that canon?</br></br></br>  <br> Spartan 3 augmentations were much safer than the II <br>This part is true<br> almost as good <br>This part isn't, or at least wasn't in the Ghosts of Onyx and Halo: Reach, I dunno if 343 changed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didnt Kurt get really disturbed and pissed off when he found out that they made the Spartan-lll's to keep going after taking lethal damage? I remember the scene when one of his team members gets hit by a needler round and after the fight is over said he thinks he got hit and then dies instantly and Kurt checks the wound and comments that his entire left side was blown away and he as missing most of his ribs and organs.</br>  <br><br>Here you go<br>https://<span>youtu.be/y44v663W-F0  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> female spartan lls gangbanging the ODST manlet <br>This is too much for my weak dick.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Kurt is the one who ordered and signed off on those enhancements. I think it''s mentioned when he's watching Beta company while they go in for surgery or to Halsey later in the book. He angry at himself for having to do that , but, like Halsey, want to keep his people alive.</br>  <br> Maria <br>Wasn't she the same size as Master Chief?<br><br>Anyway, the original books made some strong assertions about the Spartan-IIs and then subsequent media has been weakening them little by little.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and it's not particularly interesting lore-wise. <br>40k lore is bigger and richer than both Hola and SW though, even if it's sci-fantasy. Any person who has read even a little bit of proper sci-fi will tell you that Halo's lore is as generic as it can get (and Marathon is still millions of times better), and whoever calls SW EU's lore amazing is seriously insane, like if you know about even a small chunk of the EU you can't possibly praise it, it's a clusterfuck of unprecedented proportions that gets more and more stupid as you read on.<br><br> once-glorious civilization struggling to survive or unfathomable horrors from the depths of space that would fuck up everybody if only they just got their shit together. <br>Shows that you're talking without any knowledge about the setting really. The first of those archetypes pertains only to Eldar, the second one partially pertains to Chaos. All the other races are completely different.<br><br> Everything is really predictable and samey <br>Like what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair the Spartan-lll's were equipped and built to be suicide troops. They were given less training, shitty armor, and sent in on insane missions that even Spartan-ll's would struggle in. They knew that since they could mass produce them that they could just throw them at the enemies in mass suicide missions and be able to easily replace the casualties.</br>  <br>I remember him signing off on it but if I recall didnt they keep some of the enhancements secret from him? I remember him being really bothered after finding out they gave them berserk enhancements that forced them to survive after taking lethal damage.</br>  <br>Okay how the fuck did I miss that?</br>  <br>The armor isn't exact but whatever</br>  <br>Boobs.</br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br>Wow</br>  <br>This why people don't like you w40k fags. Of course it has bigger lore, they are writing it for like 50 years. You don't have to go into threads and shout that everything ripped off w40k that it is high literature while everything else is shit.</br>  <br><br><br>From my understanding he knew what the enhancements were, there was the whole thing with the splinter-AI warning him before it died, only for him to do nothing since from my understanding the writing implied he knew already since he had ordered those mods added in.<br><br>Him growing unnerved/disturbed after that S-III died IMO was just supposed to be him trying to come to terms to what he'd really done to his recruits by giving them those modifications. Like he was detached from what it would mean for them to be that resistant to injury before killing over like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't start this shit here</br></br>  <br>He was bothered that the thousand kids he trained died. Only Gamma company got the rage augmentations because Kurt was tired of seeing them die. Halsey was the one bothered by I think. I havn't read the book in a while so I might be wrong.</br>  <br>I mean the augmentations, not the spartans themselves. IIIs had worse training and didn't screen for absolutely perfect genes, which is half of what made the IIs so amazing, but the augmentations weren't that much worse.</br>  <br> 40k lore is bigger and richer <br>It's might be bigger (in sheer volume, if you count all that was retconned anyway) but it's definitely not richer. It's all the same boring stuff throughout, and it almost has to be that way to keep the table top game going and making money. The older stuff was a bit more varied and tongue-in-cheek and fun, but modern 40k is universally terrible.<br><br> The first of those archetypes pertains only to Eldar <br>And the Imperium and the Newcrons.<br><br> the second one partially pertains to Chaos <br>And the Necrons (see also first archetype as of the Newcrons), the Tyranids, and the Orkz. They're all a bit different flavor-wise, but they're still horrors from deep space.<br><br>The only one that's a bit different is the Tau.<br><br>And I'm not praising neither SW nor the SW:EU (most of it is garbage with one or two decent things), nor am I really praising Halo lore, but 40k isn't any better than either of those.<br><br>As an avid reader of sci-fi, I dislike all three, but modern 40k is the worst of the lot. Also the fanbase is annoying and tends to think that 40k invented all the cliches (instead of just copying whatever was popular at the time) and is the bestest thing ever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So whose eyes should it be above him?</br></br>  <br> You don't have to go into threads and shout that everything ripped off w40k that it is high literature while everything else is shit. <br>I never said that though. Relax son, no one's trying to bully you.</br></br>  <br><br>Was the case? Its been so long since I read the books so I could have mistaken. I mostly remember the Spartan-lll's being used as shock troopers that got sent in on suicide missions. I think only 2 of the kids Kurt trained survived the first mission and one of them was so traumatized that they just stopped talking completely. Actually, what was so special about Kurt? I remember that every member of Chiefs team had a unique specialty but for the life of me I cant remember what Kurt's was.</br></br>  Man fuck this thread. Fuck it to hell, and fuck you guys especially about reminding me about this shit. Fuck. You.<br><br> It hurts, anons ;_; I miss Halo, I miss its lore, I miss dicking around in the game, but after Reach, I just couldn't go any further. It hurts ;_; I miss it, but I know it's dead </br></br>  <br> I never said that though <br>This whole 40k thing started because every time someone mentions the Zerg a 40kfag is summoned to tell everyone how the Zerg are a rip-off of the Tyranids, even if it's in no way relevant to the discussion at hand.</br></br>  <br>Close anon. Kurt replaced Sam and was recognized as being a people person among the Spartan II's. He was the most sociable. All of Alpha died and 2 survived from Beta's suicide mission because Kurt trained them harder to help them survive. One of them did stop talking but fucking Karen Travis made her talk again because someone was bullying an engineer in front of her.</br>  <br>The two survivors were from the second wave, Beta company. Nobody made it out of Alpha.<br><br>As for Kurt, if memory serves he was notable in that he was the most like a normal person and would socialize the most with regular people. Not much of a distincition at first, but I think they said it showed he though differently than the Spartan-IIs, though like a normal peprson might and thus brought a new perspective to the team by notixing things they wouldn't have. Best example of that is when he noticed something was up during the nuke snatch-and-grab operation where the rebels nearly killed Blue Team when he saw all the ammo was AP, meanwhile the rest of the team hadn't noticed anything at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Also Kurt was supposed to have really good intuition with sensing traps.</br>  <br>Hey at least you didn't touch 4</br>  <br>Kilo 5 better get fucking retconned soon, it was full of awful shit like that</br>  <br> Karen Traviss <br>I thought her Republic Commando shit was okay/enjoyable enough to read for fun but holy shit when I read that change shit with Lucy's voice I wanted to clock her in the jaw.<br><br>The mute one's name was Lucy, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasnt Kurt described as being a good leader like Master Chief? The only difference between them was Chief was naturally lucky and Kurt wasnt. Man, I always loved how every Spartan-ll had a unique thing about them. I love how Chief is actually considered rather average for a Spartan-ll. His only specialty was inspiring troops and his stupidly good luck.</br>  <br> tfw even though the Master Chief Collection exists and I can go play the original trilogy online whenever I want it will never, ever be like it used to be. Especially because of how hard 343 managed to fuck it up. <br> tfw all my old friends, both online and in real life, have moved on from Halo and I will never spend hours in full lobby custom games messing around with them ever again. </br></br>  <br>That's because there aren't many Japanese people who are still alive to understand what war was like.</br>  <br>Hey, at least you and your friends didn't all buy Xbones and MCC specifically to relive the glory days on Halo 3 LAN parties.<br><br>Man, was that a disappointment.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's not the same when you know it gets shitty <br><br> I played a little of it. I know how it turns out <br><br><br>343 fucking piss me the fuck off. Once again proving that you can't hand off an IP to someone who isn't the original creator, and think it'll somehow work. <br><br>RIP Halo. I loved you, and know you loved us, but it's best you just lie there and pretend you don't exist. What adds insult to injury is shit like Microsoft naming their Siri counterpart "Cortana". What the fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How could humans produce something like Spartans, which were much stronger than any soldier the Covenant had, despite being technologically inferior?  <br>Yeah, Kurt was one of the most proficient leaders in the II's even though he made some of them uncomfortable because of the amount of time he would spend making friends outside of missions. I really wish we had seen him pt on the MJOLNIR at the end of Onyx rather than the SPI to truly fuck up those covies before he nuked them. One of my favorite things is how chief considers Linda the best II. At least I think it was Linda.</br>  <br> I wanted to clock her in the jaw. <br><br>Its funny because the mute spartan clocks Halsey in the jaw.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Lucy-B091. She was one of the shortest Spartan III's.</br>  <br>"Jackie's nose sure is big"</br>  <br>The thing about 4 that angered me the most, aside from the general lore raping that comes from forced milking of a franchise that ended perfectly, was the Spartan IVs.<br>What the fuck where they thinking?<br>Spartans are now consenting adults already in the army? What the fuck?<br>Took the entire mysticism out of the Spartans when every jarhead can just sign up for it, might as well not even call them Spartans now that anything that remotely resembles the ancient ones is gone. Not to mention they would still get their asses kicked by a real one easily, yet they still go about like they are the hottest shit.<br>Also the armor designs, Jesus Christ, are they absolute shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part is that he was  killed by a fucking terrorist and not a covenant </br>  <br>Any other Halo references in anime?<br><br><br>That's what happens when you start learning, the war would've been more different if the grunts were tiny spartans instead of just a reskinned contemporary Marine</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this shit</br>  <br>Good bait. Try to get familiar with Halo lore. Humans are not inferior technologically, and the elite elites are better than Spartan lls.</br>  <br>Don't forget that  Mickey then joins said terrorist. Fuck I hate him so much now. </br>  <br>  but it's definitely not richer. It's all the same boring stuff throughout <br> 4u <br>It is richer in terms of content though, that's a fact and has nothing to do with quality. The same "boring stuff throughout" argument can be made for pretty much every single sci-fi universe that is big enough. Go ahead and name a single one that is immune to this if it isn't the case.<br> And the Imperium  <br>The Imperium is, in the global view of things, a "glorious" civilization currently. It's just facing existential threats despite that. Of course it's a shit civilization compared to the apex of pre-Imperium mankind, but compared to pre-Great Crusade mankind they're really quite glorious.<br> and the Newcrons. <br>While you can say that they're the remnants of an old glorious civilization, they're not struggling to survive and are one of if not the most comfortable race in 40k right now.<br> And the Necrons (see also first archetype as of the Newcrons),  <br>The old Necrons fit the second archetype, the Newcrons don't. Old Necrons are irrelevant unless you count the ones that are still supposed to be there under the C'Tan, but those are far from the threat old Necrons were.<br> the Tyranids,  <br>They're fathomable horrors from outer space that are actually fucking everybody up, their shit is already together as much as it can be.<br> and the Orkz.  <br>Not unfathomable horrors, just green-skinned savages. It's true that they would rek everyone if they were ever united, but that's not their objective in the first place, they're already doing very well in their current state.<br> The only one that's a bit different is the Tau. <br>And that one remaining race that you forgot about.<br><br>There are many legit reasons to dislike 40k, but being ignorant of the setting and trying to twist things to fit your narrow and outright false views isn't one of them.<br><br><br>Who cares? It has nothing to do with the issue here.<br><br><br>And this is different from other Western nations how?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love just how much detail is put into the halo books and lore man. Seriously the scene were they sent all of Alpha and Beta on the suicide mission was so graphic and detailed. I loved how they described just how ineffective the SPI armor was at defending against covenant weapons when they describe how a single grazed shot from a plasma pistol melted all the way through the guys armor and his chest like it wasnt even there.</br>  <br>I'm not familiar with Halo lore, that's why I'm asking. I spent like 30 minutes reading the Halo Nation wiki because of this thread and I couldn't find the answer. The wiki stated humans were technologically inferior and I just assumed Spartans were the best because the Covenant apparently feared them and called them Demons and Master Chief smashed everything like it was nothing.</br>  The only one i didnt like was the one with the Arbiter and ps1 cutscene graphics  <br>Linda is a hard ass so it would make sense. She had ungodly accuracy. I dont remember exactly how they described her accuracy but I remember a scene in Onyx when she took out several sentinals with one ricochet shot from her sniper. She also shouldnt even be alive considering she got lit up by multiple plasma rifles and pistols while her shields were down.</br>  <br>It's modern military, UNSC embrace shameless 80s aesthetic, except with FTL that is.<br><br>Of course they changed quite far in few decades but hey.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the package was the worst</br>  <br>My favorite scene with Linda is from First Strike when she's sniping elites out of there Banshees while hanging upside down.</br>  <br>What's weird is that I pictured her the same way even though she was never described as such.</br>  <br>The package was entertaining when they started the run towards the command room<br><br>Arbiter one was just eyecancer</br></br></br>  <br>The covenant pretty much just copies Forerunner tech, and barely makes any of their own. Since it's against their religion to tamper with it, they don't even bother improving it much. So when humans finally get hold of forerunner tech, they make shit like the Infinity which solos entire covenant fleets. Spartan armor isn't forerunner, but it does incorporate some of the covenant shield tech derived from forerunner shields and improves upon them a little. Spartans still drop like flies vs the covenant though, it's just the chief and a few others that are lucky enough to survive.</br>  <br>at least the scene when he fights the army and the hunter was cool</br>  <br>The Spartan-ll's were made to battle the rebels originally. It just so happened that while they were being made the covenant showed up. The UNSC and the Covenant are sort of both equal to each other in terms of weaponry. Due to how the Covenant shields and ships were designed with defending against energy weapons the UNSC's kinetic based guns and tech have an edge against them if I recall. The MAC guns are extremely effective against the Covenant ships. Though the plasma weaponry is also extremely effective against the UNSC ships and soldiers due to them designing around dealing with kinetic weapons so the armor doesnt do much to stop the plasma.</br>  <br>The UNSC are extremely outmatched compared to Covenant technology. While the MAC guns are effective the UNSC still lose like 3 to 1 in every ship to ship fight. The place they excel compared to the covenant was on ground.</br>  <br> It is richer in terms of content though <br>It's bigger in terms of content, but it's not richer because it lacks variety. It's also not richer a lot of the stuff that actually made it richer in the past has been retconned out.<br><br> Go ahead and name a single one that is immune to this if it isn't the case <br>Pretty much any universe that's not constrained to games and has a single author (Asimovs Robot and Foundation universe, for instance)<br><br>I'm not going to go through each of your arguments for the races because you're focusing on specific flavors, while ignoring that the two archetypes of "race that was better in the past" and "horror from deep space" are still predominant. They're all vehicles for justifying the color of little plastic army men, and that makes them pretty limited in what freedoms the writers had, because they have to balance lore with gameplay to a large extent.<br><br> And that one remaining race that you forgot about. <br>What would that be? The Squats?<br><br>I'm not as ignorant of the setting as you'd like to believe. I may not be as educated as a dedicated fan and because I don't play the game, but that means I'm not blinded to its flaws either. I considered playing (and immersing myself into the lore of) 40k in the past mainly because of evangelizing 40k playing friends of mine who kept telling me that it's the best thing since sliced bread, so I studied up on it and decided that it was not for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks, sounds like it makes sense.</br></br>  <br>The Spartan-ll's were never really designed to be used as front line troops if I recall. Their specialty was hit and run guerrilla warfare tactics. They would send it a team and run assassination missions and other missions like that. The reason Reach was such a complete slaughter was because in a front line battle the Spartan-ll's arent that effective. They are only around as strong as the Elites. I think they only advantage they really have over them is their super enhanced reflexes.</br>  <br><br>Covies got most of their tech from copying forerunner relics, and weren't very good at inventing new stuff or even optimizing what they had. Cortana was able to vastly improve their plasma weapons and do crazy shit with their slipspace drives just by tweaking the settings. Plus their culture didn't really need a supersoldier program. Elites were fine with their natural strength and wouldn't want the other races having something like that.<br><br>Or you could go with the 343 explanation: Augmenting people and sticking them in powered suits is actually a genetic imperative implanted by a forerunner when humans were still cavemen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What they said. Read the First Strike and the short story compilation. Covenant doesn't know how to use forerunner tech, ut is revealed when Cortana gets into a flagship and realizes that the covies use about 1% of its potential. Also there's a story where a group of spartans are slaughtered by some elite specops that watched them to gather info. Elites and brutes are still stronger than spartans.</br></br>  Have you worshipped a tomboy today?    <br><br/></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br/>  <br/>  <br/>  <br><br/></br>  <br><br/></br>  The fuck is this thread!?!?!?!  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL<br><br>Why does every jojo series start with one person doing a simple action that fucks over the whole story without reason?<br><br> Part1 <br>George Joestar is fucking trusting to a flaw.

How far in are the colored guys?</br>  <br>Heaven, my child.</br>  <br>Cool gif but can it beat Enrico Pucci? And I'm not talking about just church boy Enrico Pucci. No, I'm not talking Whitesnake soul stealing jizz mode can make a mans head play gospel, can make a frog fly away and explode and stick his hand in someone and control them sleeps in bed with DIO , Let's DIO plow his ass, I can't wait for heaven DIO is just so sexy I'm a 39 year old in a black Italian twink's body with a huge black girl ass Enrico Pucci. I'm talking about finding 38 sinners and turning DIO's bone into a green baby then making it fuse with Whitesnake after reciting the 14 words (Spiral,staircase,Rhinoceros beetle,Ruins street,Fig tart,Rhinoceros beetle,Via dolorosa,Rhinoceros beetle,Singularity point,Giotto,Angel,Hydrangea,Rhinoc<wbr>eros beetle,Singularity point,Secret emperor .) Then travels to Cape Canaveral Air force station gaining the power over gravity and the stand C-moon causing, floats into mid-air and attains Heavens and kills everyone speeding up non-living things, while gaining the power of super speed, and resets the universe killing everyone Enrico Pucci. </wbr> </br>  Who would win in a fight, DIO or Diavolo?

DIO?</br>  <br>Been while since I've seen this gif.</br>  we never woke up  Is Pucci the best example of how fucked super speed is in fiction?<br><br>He killed everyone with almost zero effort despite going against a time stopper with the equivalent of Substitute from Pokemon and the only reason that he lost was the side effect of speeding up the entire fucking universe alongside him<br><br>Compared to people like the Flash or Quicksilver who constantly get beaten by banana peels and shit, it seems a lot better written</br></br></br></br>  <br>DIO can only be defeated by the power of bullshit protagonism.</br>    <br> How many times have we had this again? <br>If they use their Stands at the same time then the stopped time will be erased resulting in nothing.<br>Whoever uses it first wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Jojo is manly, show me a single panel of two men having sex with each other.</br>  <br>DIO wins. Then he'd fuck Doppio while Diavolo watches.</br>  anyone have the ALIVE part 7 MAD?

So I recently just finished the Part 2 manga and I'm on SC now. Are Stands permanent? This shit is pretty boring to be honest. Also does Jotaro ever get interesting?  <br>Please calm down mr. Newfag</br>  <br>Considering Gappy's balls are like a pool table, I don't think he should take the risk.</br>  <br> Pucci kills Jotaro. </br>  H O T P A N T S<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why didn't Fugo go with the rest of the group? Why was he the only one who was afraid when he had the best power out of all of them at that point?  <br>Yes and no.</br>  <br>Why didn't Joseph just destroy DIO's body with Hamon after he was killed by Jotaro?</br>  Isn't it funny that they're the opposite when push comes to shove?<br><br>Diavolo is a complete nutjob most of the time, clinically paranoid while DIO puts on this cool and charismatic facade that attracts people to him.<br><br>But when Diavolo fights he don't fuck around, so if we exclude Giorno, every person who has faced him died. He killed them, he didn't play around but instead was straight to the point. Diavolo seems very calm during his fights, analyzing while DIO, goes full ham and starts going crazy, making these faces and hammy speeches.<br><br>I feel like DIO's the more appealing, functional and charismatic leader, while Diavolo is the far more unstable yet competent leader</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because his stand was OP as hell. Araki literally came out saying he had to write him out because he would have ruined the later fights. <br><br>Either way his stand was just recycled for green day.</br></br></br>  <br>Diavolo = italian for devil<br><br>Dio = spanish for God<br><br>woooooooooooooow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that Diavolo isn't a competent leader at all, part 5 is literally just him digging himself a deeper grave.</br>  <br> reading manga when anime improved everything <br>Yes, they are permanent.<br>Jotaro got interesting after Part 3.<br>SC is the most boring part so far but it have good battles.</br></br></br></br>  Why is Weather Report such an underrated stand? Every time the "strongest stand" or "X vs Y" comes up it always turns into a debate about King Crimson, The World/SP, MiH, D4C, GER, etc.<br>Weather Report fucks up Pucci's shit not once, not twice, but THREE times, ultimately killing him without a whole lot of effort after he single handed curb-stomped the entire cast. Being able to control the weather and elements is insanely powerful, and the oxygen attack would kill just about any opponent regardless of how broken their stand ability is. I don't care how much time KC erases or how much bullshit GER is, it won't matter when Weather Report paralyzes them and then smashes their head into paste.</br>  The most cancerous JoJofags are those that hate Part 6 with an inexplicable passion. None can compare to the degrees of shitposting and buttmad these faggots exude, whenever someone implies that part 6 is good.<br>Prove me wrong.</br>  <br>To be fair, how would KC deal with poisonous gases? It's not like he can "evade" them or "erase" the time when The Boss gets intoxicated, because even if he does he's still going to end up being poisoned.<br> That's the problem, it is useless against people who know who he is. <br>Have you read the page posted though? They perfectly know who he is, but he is still able (or, rather, gained an ability) to control and activate it freely and manually.</br></br></br>  <br>Dio is italian for God.<br>Dios es "god" en español.</br></br>  So the shitposter aside who doesn't know the difference between MiH and BtD, whats everyone opinions on the Eyes of heaven lineup?<br><br>I wonder if they are gonna reveal a large amount of early part 4 in anticipation for the anime or if they'll just keep milking 3.</br></br>  <br>The most cancerous JoJofags are those that love Part 6 with an inexplicable passion. None can compare to the degrees of shitposting and buttmad these faggots exude, whenever someone implies that part 6 isn't good.<br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br> 666 <br>Oh lawd</br></br>  <br>you just need to open up to stands more. araki was able to do much more with them than hamon.</br>  <br>Because Weather Report is asspull in stand form.</br>  <br>I just did.

Jesus christ what a shitty ending.What a shitty part overall really. Only characters I really liked were Diavolo and Mista.<br> Also I'm still not sure I understand KC. Why doesn't Diavolo do more stuff like he did against Metallica where he let the bullets phase through him by erasing time? Is it an inconsistency?  </br>  <br>Part V felt like it was missing a lot of inbetween things, which I guess is ironic considering the nature of King Crimson. <br>The entire thing reminded me of how Dio's World felt rushed near the end, like Araki was setting up the fight to go on a whole nother chapter but then got rushed or something so just ended it quick. <br>All of Part V feels like that to me. Maybe it was a theme to go with King Crimson, or a gag that I'm not getting like Part 8 having Jo2uke constantly dodging plot hooks, but I didn't like it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess you two don't have the volumes.</br></br>  <br>Separate content, separately judged.</br>  <br> I really liked were Diavolo <br>He was the worst character on part 5.</br></br>  <br>More like his stand was poorly thought out. Depending on the time of the day, it's either extremely useful or really useless, not to mention that it's an enormous collateral damage risk. It's just a shit stand outside of its design. Araki could have written 2 ways to deal with him: he gets sniped by a ranged stand user, or Diavolo stealths and punches through him or impales him somewhere, like what happened with Narancia. Either would be pretty shit, taking him out of the story altogether was the right decision. GD is a much more interesting Stand than PH but you couldn't use it as a protagonist stand.<br><br><br>Because the fanbase is retarded and doesn't understand that fights between complex Stands would basically be like the high tier 2hus fighting to the death. To talk about the outcome you'd have to make comparisons between various vaguely understood concepts, based on extremely limited circumstantial observation of those concepts in action (and sometimes, actually based on nothing). It would only be conjecture at the end.<br>As far as I can remember, WR was normally talked about as one of the most powerful Stands, but I guess the final bosses became memes when JoJo became popular and WR has been forgotten. GER-wankery of course existed since Part 5 ended and it's been so strong that the fanfiction that's been established about it is now taken as actual fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Araki literally came out saying he had to write him out because he would have ruined the later fights. <br>No he didn't, that's something fans made up. What Araki did say is that he planned for Fugo to be a mole for Diavolo, but felt he'd be letting his young readers down so he decided to get rid of him instead.</br></br>  So do any of you fags have any figures?  The paste has been removed.<br><br>Also, where can I find the colored scans for part IV after Kishibe Rohan's adventure?

Later on, he was more prepared for any of Kira's shenanigans.</br>  <br>Josuke had potential but the end of part 4 really left me disappointed<br><br>He played second fiddle to Jotaro at the last minute<br><br>And him stealing Joseph's wallet like a faggot punk left a bad taste in my mouth</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He did it for the photo his mother wanted, he's so pure</br>  <br>Cutest JoJo is always purest JoJo.</br>  <br> no pyjama alt costume in ASB </br>  <br>is that [THE ROCK] ???</br>  <br> he played second fiddle to Jotaro at the last minute <br>You know, until now I've never really looked at it like that. A fair amount of fights involve working together, like when Koichi and Jotaro run into Kira. Besides, Jotaro just finished him off. Josuke is the one who fucked his shit up.<br>Only thing I could want more out of part 4 is more Okuyasu action.</br></br></br>  <br> Josuke is the one who fucked his shit up. <br>Josuke was about to get killed by an air bubble before Okuyasu and then everyone else showed up.<br><br>The entire final fight really belonged to Hayato.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The pacing in the manga was so much better. It feels so unnatural in the anime.</br>  <br>So pure</br>   Mista Guido's stand is the exact same as Hol Horse's stand except better   <br> part 4 <br> not Okuyasu gigantic fuckup </br></br>  Since Gappy has four balls doesn't it make him jizz master just like in my singaporean wood carvings?  <br>Who is the kid standing between Rohan and Giorno?</br>  <br>Mista's Stand is not a gun.</br>  <br>Mista is a thug while Hol Horse is assassin. Of course Mista's stand would just about spraying around. Hell, his stand isn't even a gun.</br>  <br> emperor = just a pistol. <br> mista = little automated stands that are used along with a real pistol <br>Yeah exact same</br></br></br>  <br>He was just a coward and had no control over his stand</br>  <br>Fugo had ridiculous stand considering he was just a puny coward. Stand that kills every living thing around it in 30 seconds? That's fucking Vanilla Ice tier soul he has.</br>  <br> except better <br>Really nigger? Hol Horse has infinite bullets and can't miss. Mista's stand is just a far depowered harvest,it sucks hard.</br></br>  <br>No,that would be Polnareff</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GvF<wbr>90NJS-84</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Speedwagon, he was a criminal and then became an ally, also they got the scar</br>  So you get teleported to part 6 of jojo, how would you kill pucci? carbomb? shive him while hes weak from fusing with the green baby/  <br> Implying I wouldn't help him. </br>  I know we have a lot of "whos the most op" circlejerks here, but is there anyone who could realistically kill or much less harm the green baby?<br><br>Everything coming close to him just gets divided in half and then once it touches him will be erased. Not even GER could do anything because as he closed into range to do something he'd just get halved until eventually being erased.<br><br>Green Grass of Home is the most unbeatable stand there is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> d'arby beats him by playing super mario kart  <br>Fugo could probably beat him, Risotto too</br></br>  Is her voice this bad in the manga? Alraedy considering dropping this shit  <br>Don't like kansai ben?</br>  <br> Is her voice this bad in the manga </br>  <br> Is her voice this bad in the manga? </br>  <br>the anime is better than the manga, manga art looks like shit anyways</br>  <br>gays not allowed</br>    <br>The voice is perfect. Not what i imagined, but better being both great in formal mode and kansa-baka mode.<br><br>And not just her voice, others are surprisingly great too, also i expected Teacher to have more rought smoker voice.</br></br></br>  <br> Is her voice this bad in the manga? </br>  <br>Ask a less retarded question later, OP.</br>  Why is Taki-sensei so based?  <br> but she's also completely insane. <br><br>Imagine the sex, anon. Imagine.</br></br></br>  <br> Does she hang out with anyone besies Yuuko? <br><br>No, she doesn't even hang out at all.</br></br></br>  <br>They should have Taki remembering his wife when he speaks with Kumiko. Reina is jelly the Kumi is more like Taki's dead wife than she is.</br>  <br>He doesn't do anything other than stop the shit people from playing instruments and waving his hands about.</br>  <br>Love can't be forgotten easily like that.

What makes you say that</br>  <br>Best anime of the 80's</br>  <br> someone actually took the time to make this <br> I'm actually taking the time to write this post about it </br></br>  Well Skyward Sword was FULL of anime tropes, so yeah. It'd probably be more enjoyable as an anime.  <br>I remember reading about that on a few sites. Apparently they even made a card game and had merchandise based on the show.

It's fucking incredible. They sound almost identical to the original. Each and every one.<br><br>If that doesn't prove Japan puts a shit ton of effort in their voice casts I don't know what does. Best voices AND dubbing.<br><br> From what I've seen Spongebob's dub takes a few liberties though. Spongebob himself sounds spot on but Patrick has a kid voice.  Plankton is a kawaii little girl.  Krabs is fine. I don't know about Squidward though. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rolf could have had a better voice, but overall its pretty good<br>I wonder if Sarah was any little nip's waifu<br><br>Got any links of Spongebob?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The JP Cartoon network channel on YouTube has tons of free full episodes of their dubs in high quality</br>  <br>I swear I remember reading Zelda manga as a teenager that wasn't horribly offensive.</br>  <br>dunno, but there will be harem</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1eq<wbr>N2FVyqtc</wbr>  [ ]<br>This is the only semi decent one on Youtube.

He is the boy’s alternate universe counterpart, who has risen in hate with the MC’s own AU self, who too is unhappily unaware of his crush. <br><br>Good behavior ensues as the one blocks down a disagreement to take each other their lightest, least public secrets in disorder to disarm the other with the weapons they need to surrender the heart of their other selves.

"Nice" is an extremely vague, meaningless term that pretty much everyone thinks they can call themselves. If a girl in anime was attracted to a guy for being hot, or confidant, or athletic it would make otaku feel insecure. But by just liking him for being "nice" the otaku can think "Hey i'm nice. That means if I were in that guys place, she would like me!"</br>  <br>so what are some legitimate reasons then</br>   I fucking love piloting this giant robot   <br>I already listed some.</br>  <br><br><br>"Nice" is a pretty subjective description of someone.<br>In this context, nice is someone who's ideals, actions and looks coincide with what the person perceives as good human traits<br><br>In anime, being kind to others and shit is the ideal and thusly is "nice"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> megas XLR (not anime but still) <br> code geass <br> half the   villan  characters in gundam</br></br></br>  <br>You forgot Patlabor.</br>  <br>well list more then<br><br>I still don't understand human relationships at all and I would very much appreciate it if someone were to explain it to me in detail</br></br></br>  <br>Are you by chance an alien.</br>  <br>I've forgotten a lot of shows that are like that, really.<br>something about /m/ shows make them fade from memory really fast.</br></br>   I won this climactic battle between mechs using skill and the capabilities of my machine, which are consistent with the setting and tone of the franchise.

The US wrote their Constitution and had bases in Japan for a couple of decades, so of course they're gonna use English words from time to time, it was literally integrated into their culture by the Americans who basically wanted to destroy the aspect of the culture that allowed the Japanese to fully give themselves up and fight for the emperor.</br>    <br> had bases in Japan for a couple of decades <br> past tense <br>I bet you think the occupation is over.</br></br></br>  Weak, weak, weak!! You need to train more, boya.  <br>And now they make cartoons for us.</br>  <br>Using foreign words considered cool.</br>  <br><br>Kek, America still has multiple bases the most notable one being the one in Okinawa. The Japanese military is also unable to act without American approval and America is effectively responsible for the defense of Japan. Sargon of Akkad had a good video about it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8HZ<wbr>dVDTN_2Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  English might have a lot of foreign words but at least they fit the language unlike those mockeries of english words they use in japanese.  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>They make cartoons for themself, you're torrenting them.</br>  <br>My bad, thanks for pointing that out, I know they still do have bases, less than before but still do</br>  Murrican education always impresses me.  <br> 1945 <br> English starts influencing Japanese <br><br> 1066 <br> French starts influencing English <br><br>English in Japan had five decades, French in England had five centuries.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they actually got a lot more loan-words from german as germany was their main trade and scientific exchange partner during industrialization.</br>  <br>Because it's classy, like talking in fr**ch.</br>  <br>Actually, a shitload of the loan words English uses are mockeries of the words they were based on. It's just that we've had them for so long they don't seem out of place and unless you actually know the language it came from you wouldn't notice.</br>  <br>An entire millenium actually. My bad.<br><br>My point is that French had much, much more time to get integrated into Anglo-Saxon to create words that "make sense" in the English context.</br></br></br>  <br>They make cartoon for themself, you wouldn't know about them if you hadn't found them on the internet.</br>  <br> Actually, a shitload of the loan words English uses are mockeries of the words they were based on. <br>Which is why Georges Clemenceau once jokingly said that English is badly pronounced French. A gross simplification for the sake of humor, but it does show that for those who know French a lot of English words sound like a butchering of their language.</br></br>  <br> "Hey man, meet me by the REH-ZUH-VWAH." <br> "Fuck, I can't drive all the way out in the BOON-DOCKS, sorry." <br><br>Also adding to this other anon's posts:<br><br><br>Boondocks originated in the 1940s from Tagalog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jeez, why do they use so much foreign words? <br><br> complains an ENGLISH speaker <br><br>Burgerland education at its finest, though I'm pretty sure this is just a 0/10 shitty bait</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read it with her Japonaise voice <br>I'm giggling.</br></br>  <br>Best girl<br>Man I miss Girlfriend Beta</br></br>  <br> tycoon came from Japanese <br>Huh.</br></br>  The same reason weebs use Japanese words in their sentences, but on an entire country wide level of adoption.<br><br>Foreign shit just sounds cool.</br></br>  <br>It's retarded, but allow me to play the devils advocate. England had been ruled by French dynasties (first the Normans, then the Angevins and for a short period even the Capetians) from the Norman Invasion until the War of the Roses. That's five centuries. In that period of time English evolved not because the Anglo-Saxon peasants thought it was cool, but because the Norman-Angevin upper class kept speaking French. During and after the Hundred Years War, this started mixing into some patois that would later become English. Despite the permanent split between France and England, the French language kept influencing English as it became the lingua franca under the rule of Francis I and remained so until about WW2 (the Versailles Treaty being formulated in English in addition to French is often interpreted to be the first crack in French linguistic dominance). All the French words in English make sense due to their history with France.<br><br>Japanese on the other hand... why? Loanwords for things they don't have words for like computer and processor make sense, but they simply seem to interject English words willy-nilly because it's cool. They use haato when kokoro is a thing, they use sooru when tamashi already exists. They were never ruled by an English speaking upper class in the same way the Ango-Saxons were ruled by a Francophone one, they just copy words because it's "cool" (or should I say "kuru"?).<br><br>It's understandable that the Japanese tendency to do this for the sake of sounding cool is grating.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They use haato when kokoro is a thing, they use sooru when tamashi already exists. <br>Because Heart means heart in a different way than kokoro would. Kokoro means heart literally, Heart means heart in a more romantic sense.</br></br>  <br> They were never ruled by an English speaking upper class </br>  <br> but they simply seem to interject English words willy-nilly because it's cool. <br>That's exactly how language always works.<br>You can see it in rapid-evolution mode on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>Epic is a great example.</br>  <br> You can see it in rapid-evolution mode on the internet. <br>I hope not. I dread for future generations. Imagine political speeches.<br><br> Murika's industrial output totally rekt China's last year #humblebrag </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> English loaned words so it's ok if the japanese do it! <br>No, you fucking weeb retards. It would make sense if they don't have a proper word already. But they use english words for things they already have words for. That's just stupid and sounds retarded as fuck when they actually say it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kokoro means heart literally <br>no, thats shinzou</br></br>  <br>It's both.</br>  <br> because it's cool <br>Really? You're on the internet where what little "proper" English that remains is decimated everyday and hip youngsters keep coming up with new fancy talk.</br></br>  <br>It's already happening. CEOs are already adapting to the new slang. Politicians are inherently a bit slow on the uptake, but in a few decades they will definitely embrace the new world lingo.</br>  <br> It would make sense if they don't have a proper word already. <br>Anglo-Saxon had words for most of the things English now uses French words for. For example, 'retard' is of French origin.<br>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php<wbr>?term=retard<br><br>Do you really believe the Anglo-Saxons did not have a word for someone who is of simple mind? What about that other insult of yours, idiot?<br>http://www.etymonline.com/index.php<wbr>?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=idiot&amp;se<wbr>archmode=none<br><br>From French as well! Am I supposed to conclude that the Anglo-Saxons were so stupid that they didn't have words for this, and the Normans had to use French words to explain just how stupid the Anglo-Saxons were?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I see your point there. But, look, when a word gets adopted into other language it often evolves a new meaning, sometimes wholly different from its origin. 'Kokoro' and 'haato' are used for quite different occasions and I can tell you this because I've encountered such cases quite often. It's just a process of enriching a language's vocabulary. Remember the Japanese had done this for almost 2000 years with Chinese, not to mention adopting the Chinese characters altogether. It may sounds a bit weird due to distinguishing differences between the Japanese language and Western ones, and sound funny, but it doesn't mean it's stupid or pointless<br><br>Oh and one more thing. English isn't considered that 'cool' anymore, due to its long and rampant usage since the end of WW2. When they want to sound 'cool' they usually go for French, German, or Lantin</br></br></br>  <br> It would make sense if they don't have a proper word already. <br> English doesn't have multiple words for the same things </br></br>  <br>In many cases, English uses loan words for things there already were English words for too. And I say again: the bastardised English versions of loan words sound equally bad to natives of the languages they're derived from.</br>  <br> one definition must have only one word! <br> one word must have only one definition! <br><br>I don't even know what kind of shit this idiot's trying to say</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anta is going full baka.</br>  <br>When will the 4chinz talkz become the normal way to talk?</br>  Will Japan end up having their own kind of English like Singapore's Singlish?  <br>Ever read a dictionary that says "See XXX" which leads to another "See XXX" or just a whole list of "See also?"</br>    <br> a word gets adopted into other language it often evolves a new meaning, sometimes wholly different from its origin <br>An easy example for english is pepperoni, which in italian was peperoni and means bell peppers.</br></br>  <br>Unlikely.<br>Japan speaks Japanese natively, so their English will always be a foreign influence.</br></br>  <br>It'd be like this guy who somehow managed to be the most frustrating thing I've seen in anime in years.</br>  <br>Is this a meme?</br>  <br>Made. They made, and they were good.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HcG<wbr>NqrAtsgg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The gh in the word light used to pronounced like the German ch in the word licht. It's just that the French couldn't say German ch so the pronunciation changed. The only reason you think it's normal is because it's been this way for seven hundred years.<br><br>They also do make the words fit their phonology. They say haato not hart etc.</br></br></br>  <br>That was infuriating more because it was management bullshit, not because it was English.</br>  <br>Well that too, but I've been working on my moonspeak, so making half the things that come out of your mouth be another language and not even be loanwords was irritating to listen to.

It lends itself real well to people well versed in gundam and its a pretty fun what if story/alternate future if the federation utterly failed in protecting earth. Although I don't think there has been any mention of Zeon or any other link to the original series other then the whole gundam/federation affiliation. I feel like they wanted it to have stronger ties but didn't so they could have their own story and what not.<br><br>If you want my opinion on the series, its good. Very good action mecha. Likable developing characters. Brutal violence. I especially liked the episode dealing with the two side character gundam pilot's back stories pretty great for just a one off episode.</br></br>  <br> Also, it doesn't really count but I'm watching HxH 2011 right now and I don't like it that much.
