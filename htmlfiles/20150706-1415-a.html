[ Compulsory Gatchaman CROWDS thread.      : &gt;  <br>Hajime-taaaaaaan</br>  Is Sugane's katana cute, or is Rui just gay?  <br>Hajime's hajime's are a gift to mankind.</br>  <br>Gay. And I used to think he was the only straight one...</br>  The only character I like is Hajime.<br>Watching Insight is a chore, but hey, more Hajime.</br>   that music right before the ED <br>Can't wait, this is gonna be my AOTS.</br>  I wish Katze would start kissing people again. And hopefully that hair will grow.  You guys think Hajime did gravure because she's a fucking superstar now?  <br>She has the body for it.</br>  <br>Rui</br>  <br>the opening was even better that the first one.<br><br>It helped that the song had less engrish</br></br></br>  <br>I want hajime to sit on my face.</br>  <br>than*</br>  I hope Hajime will be wrong for once.  Why is Hajime broken?  I watched episode 13 on the BD; does that basically cover what was changed in the director's cut of 12?  <br>because of autism.</br>  <br>Nevermind, it finished downloading and I skipped through it. It's literally the same thing.</br>   new Gatchaman song <br>OST release when?</br>  <br>The 26th iirc</br>   g-g-g-g-g-g-gatchamaaaan wasn't playing when Tachibana transformed  <br><br>fuck</br></br>  <br>because of enlightenment.</br>  <br>I've noticed people acting like this is a new show. I watched this ages ago. I'm not saying you are OP, but what is with people thinking this is new? What gives?</br>  <br>You mean Gforce or?</br>  <br>Don't be a dummy.</br>  <br>What. Are you trying to trick me? I guess you could have watched Gatchaman ages ago, but CROWDS isn't that old and insight is airing now.</br>  <br>Insight is a new show, sequel to Crowds.</br>  <br>Hajime best character, paipai best gatcha.</br>  musically OP1 &gt; OP2<br>visually OP2 &gt; OP1<br><br>that said, I love both, it's not like one's much better in either case</br></br></br>  Who's gonna be the next prime minister?<br><br>Fuck, who cares, everyone is just watching this for Hajime.</br></br>   You will never embarrass Utsutsu on national television  <br>Utsutsu</br>   gay man <br> crossdressing boy <br> gay boy <br> panda <br> asexual <br> weird alien <br> UNKNOWN (lebian?) <br> very gay alien <br> maybe lesbian alien <br>Man, not much in the way of normal sexuality huh.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They pull it off in one fell swoop a lot better than DC or Marvel could EVER do</br>  <br>Pretty sure Hajime is pansexual.</br>  <br>Crossdressing isn't sexuality, anon. Rui has show some attraction to Hajime. At best you can say he's bi.</br>  <br><br>Hajime is Stationarysexual. She even stuffed Katze's note inside of her.</br></br>  <br>Seeing as Hajime = Katze now I suppose bi makes even more sense.<br><br>On that note<br> omnisexual alien living in a pair of boobs </br></br></br></br>  <br>She swings toward scissors too. She likes arts and crafts.</br>    Why is Hajime so great.<br>No, seriously, why.</br>  I really missed Hajime not giving a fuck   there will be no insight OST release party like with there was with s1   <br>Joe is not gay.<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>  I didn't like Crowds the first time I watched it, but I rewatched it today because I was bored and found myself really enjoying it.<br><br>Also Hajime's suit should've gotten some of Katze's characteristics like the diamond tail.</br></br>  This is such a wonderful idea, who even thinks of doing this? It's so bloody neat. The stop motion through the countryside and such too.  <br> Also Hajime's suit should've gotten some of Katze's characteristics like the diamond tail. <br>I'm hoping it happens later.</br></br>  I watched all of Crowds Yesterday for the first time. I did not know there was going to be a sequel. I feel very lucky.  <br>Straight as an arrow.<br><br> I know this isn't evidence, but otherwise he does kinda set off my gaydar. </br></br></br>  <br>Hajime is Genocider Shou.</br>  <br>Rui is not attracted to Sugane, he was just being polite instead of calling him a filthy sword otaku</br>  <br> pays no attention to the cute girls he works with <br> keeps trying to get Sugane drunk <br>He's gay, Jim.</br></br></br>  <br>The straightest.</br>  <br> OD, glancing back at Joe, knowingly </br>  <br>He looks so seductive when his head rests on his hand like that.</br>  What's this episode 00 thing? Recap?  <br>A bit of recap and some action.</br>  <br>Only for the intro. It's mainly like a half-standard length prologue episode. You should watch it first.</br>  <br> OD <br>uhh no?</br></br>  <br>That's not OD, it's the bartender guy.</br>  <br>That ain't OD<br><br>Why is tumblr trying to invade these threads with "muh sexual diversity/fujoshit delusions" again? Don't you know what bait is?</br></br></br>  <br>It's 50/50 recap &amp; new content, watch it because it shows the new villain.</br>  <br><br><br>Good to know. Grazie</br></br></br>  <br>I thought we were just joking around. That's what I'm doing, at least.</br>  <br><br><br>Well shit, I could've sworn</br></br></br>  <br>Yup.</br>  <br><br>It gets annoying when it happens every thread</br></br>  Will Berg be relevant again?<br>Hajime seems to have complete dominion over him.</br>  <br>That's his friend Alan</br>  I keep seeing people say OD is a guy, is that actually confirmed? I remember the first season when OD commented on the shotas touching his breasts.  So basically Katze-san is living inside Hajimes chest now? There's certainly enough size. Comfortable.  <br>O.D!</br>  <br>It's not much evidence considering Berg's method of taunt, but he refers to O.D as an okama, which is jap for drag queens basically.</br>  <br>Don't be so upset, Jesus Christ. It's not our fault Joe is a flaming ga tchaman. </br>  <br>That mouth looks like a fine shape  for my dick .</br>    <br>Ep 13 is the DC of 12</br>  <br>I might agree if it seemed like anybody was actually serious about it, but none of these posts feel anywhere near real tumblr fujoshit tier. Doesn't seem like a big deal to me. /a/ jokes about this sort of thing all the time.</br>  <br>Tiny.</br>  <br>OD is maybe gay. Rui is a crossdresser, but we have no reason to believe he is actually gay so far. And everything else you got straight from your ass.<br><br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br></br></br></br>    <br>He's an okama, a flaming gay man.<br><br><br>It's almost like I'm joking around or something.<br><br>You sound insecure.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Alan wasn't the new gatchaman or one retired <br><br>what a let down</br></br>  <br>FLCL did it with the vespa, and there's been non stop-motion live OPs before, but yes it was cool.</br>    <br>It's not just the stop motion but using those promotional character things for stop motion. It's just not something that would've ever crossed my mind.<br><br><br>That doesn't make sense as a retort considering I am not "trolling" or anything, just bullshitting. Like a lot of people in this thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno man, that post did read like a joke (or at least an exaggeration) to me. I mean, he listed "panda" as a sexuality.</br>  <br>Yeah, happened in the directors cut</br>  <br>So, Ginger-kun will probably try to stir up sentiments against Rui and CROWDS, accuse him of hijacking the mayoral election via X, etc. Then, with anti-CROWDS sentiments at a high, he'll force some kind of revolutionary change in power to his preferred anti-CROWDS candidate by making it a referendum on Rui-rui and X, encouraging people to vote "against X", and continuing to fuck shit up with red CROWDS. G-team gets caught up in it and can't be neutral brokers because Rui is now Gatcha. Gel gets co-opted by Ginger-kun because he promises to make everyone the same (I.e. red-emotioned monkeys).</br>  <br>They grew because he's there.</br>  Jou isn't gay, he's just fucking sexy and we're all gay.<br>Hajime is probably very open, but clearly likes boys. Didn't she once say Rui was cuter as a boy?<br>Sugane is just dedicated to his work, comments like this can be taken either way.<br>Rui is straight, just a sissy crossdresser, I'd believe he's gay if he wasn't so interested in Hajime and X didn't have a cute girl voice.<br>OD is super homo.<br>Utsutsu is うつうつ.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Didn't she once say Rui was cuter as a boy? <br>There was a bit of metaphor in that, but yes.</br></br>    <br>In my 100% honest opinion, Joe is gay, Sugane is straight, Rui is straight, Hajime is ??? I guess straight?, OD doesn't even need to be commented on, and Utsutsu probably doesn't even know what human sex is.</br>  <br>I'm wondering, really. It's actually legal to carry a fucking katana on public spaces in Japan?</br>  <br><br>She said he looked better without make-up, aka she prefers him to be honest.</br></br>  <br>I wonder.</br>  <br>Fatty.<br><br><br>There's stuff like Kendo clubs that at least use practice swords, it's wrapped up, and he's a student. So even if it is illegal I doubt he runs into any legal trouble.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sugane. The tryhard faggot.</br>  <br><br>AUGUST 26th<br><br>Enjoy your pain</br></br></br></br>  <br>That seems reasonable, thanks.</br>  Sugane have some feelings for Hajime or I'm just bad at reading it?  <br>Thank god I have a bit of a masochistic side.</br>  <br>Admiration, just like everyone else.</br>  <br>He definitely does. Does anyone have a gif/webm of that scene in which OD hugs him and Hajime pats his head?</br>   not "ninomiya_rui utsutsu" images <br><br>Why Japan?</br></br>  <br>It turned red, just like her NOTE.</br>  I really like the setup for Tsubasa. The contrast between Yuri-jii being a cool, calm old dude but a master of fireworks against Tsubasa's hotheaded and fiery love for them puts her personality into perspective. In his eyes you probably have to be collected and able to control yourself in order to not be overcome by the destructive power of the fireworks, which is the opposite of how she is right now. That her suit and powers activate when she "explodes" seems to be leading to some intense development later on when she learns to hold back and bit and really speak to others properly (likely after she learns from Hajime). There are just a lot of little things that come together about her introduction that really synthesize well and make it feel complete and fulfilling.  <br>Utsutsu isn't an alien.</br>  <br> Yuru* <br>Sorry almost 100 year-old guy, I've clearly been here too long.</br></br>  <br>Of course not anon, she's a beautiful, normal girl in a bizarre and grotesque world</br>    <br> Yeah right, bitch. I bet you don't even know how to light a firecracker. </br>  <br>Sorry, I forgot about the completely human ability to replicate oneself at will.</br>  <br>I guess you must've also forgotten about the fact that  SHE'S A FUCKING GATCHAMAN YOU RETARD! </br>  <br>Calm down you buffoon. It slipped my mind that one could use abilities outside of their transformation.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's one of her Gatchaman functions. Her hair isn't ears, according to Kinako Design Works. I'm pretty sure she's human.</br>  <br>This still confuses me, but I love it too much to question it.</br>   While without a surname early on, the profile for the second season reveals it as "Miya" <br>Anyone have the source on this?</br>  <br>Probably added as an afterthought so she doesn't seem "alien"</br>  <br>No hope for a Casshern Sins sequel? That was a great Tatsunoko series remake.</br>  <br><br><br>I am pretty sure the whole make up thing was just a metaphor from Hajime's part about him hiding behind X and the Crowds which is why he decides to confront Katze head on in the next episode<br><br>But yeah, she prefers to refer to him as male and he even seems surprised that she was able to tell his real gender when they first met</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh, it happens</br>  <br>Hair ears are moe</br>  <br><br>Just a reminder.</br></br>      <br>Hard to say, they'd probably have to escape for that since I can't imagine them letting Hajime look bad or weak in any way.</br>  <br>That's not a problem.</br>  OP is a faggot.<br><br><br>But he's a cool faggot like OD.</br></br></br>  <br> Seikon no Qwaser <br>you just took a fucking sledgehammer to my nostalgia<br>I'm gonna go watch some lolicon lesbian BDSM now.</br></br></br>  <br>Hajime's thing is grey because she wants to get into that grey bush<br> same for the old man </br></br>  <br>I think Tsubasa will be a very bipolar personality with different strong emotions and her Gatcha form will probably have different colours to represent that. Meanwhile the alien will showcase it even further.</br>  <br>We all have to say from something, even if it only leaves a :&gt; in your epitaph.</br>  <br> to say <br>to die*</br></br>  <br>Nirvana's a hell of a drug.</br>  <br>By all means, don't let me stop you</br>  <br>Is that a TV/BD comparison?<br>I'm dying.</br></br>  <br>They added chocolate filling.<br><br>Very important!</br></br></br>  <br> Jou and Rui-Rui will use X to rig the vote, keeping their puppet Sugayama in power. </br>  <br>That would be awful, but a good source of dramu against the gatchaman if word gets out</br>  <br>He may be relevant in the respect that alien-girl seems like she's going to be a complete foil to him<br> Katze shows up to break everyone apart and send the planet into flames <br> alien girl shows up to unite everyone and turn the world into Psycho-Pass </br></br></br>  <br> chocolate <br>b-baka!</br></br>  <br> implying anyone would actually eat it if it was red bean paste </br>  <br><br>I think it's more likely that Vape will stir up conspiracy theories about X and Gatchaman rigging the Mayoral election (remember, they're electing both the mayor and Parliament this way). Then, they sweep their anti-Crowds party into office on the premise of voting "against X's undemocratic interference".</br></br>  <br>Gelsadra is both Tsubasa's Usutsu and Katze</br>  <br>Red bean paste is actually pretty nice. I was skeptical at first, too.</br>  <br>I can eat a little bit of it at a time, but the way they pack those things full is just gross.</br>  <br>Nice and sweet.</br>  Has anyone in the series ever commented on Hajime's big fat tits?  <br>Well then, guess I don't need to even ask if I should watch this after that garbage S1.</br>  <br>Is just the elephant in the room at this point<br><br>She would just probably laugh and say how it hurts her back if anybody ever commented on it</br></br></br>  <br> Katze has made them fatter <br>I fell in love with Hajime before the first season was over, but the fact that she has a crazy, androgynous alien living inside her breasts makes her even hotter.</br></br>  <br>How does that even work?</br>  <br>In a world where Gatchaman have to protect the human race from potentially dangerous aliens, I don't think anyone is shocked by huge boobs.</br>  <br>Mammary glands are good at storage?</br>  <br>I should also note, that according to an anon in the previous thread:<br> There is a typeset in the OP with the GALAX voting system and it has the buttons I AGREE / I DISAGREE / I'LL LEAVE IT TO SADRA. Now, SADRA is likely referring to GelSADRA, which makes me wonder how exactly is she going to get involved with X. <br><br> If you don't believe me, wait for decent subs who translate that sign (probably Cthuko, since Commie won't give a fuck). <br><br>Given this percentage graphic in the OP that then approaches 100% as well as the visual of Gelsadra surrounded by "red" emotions, I'd infer that Vape will somehow interfere in the national vote by influencing Gel, who will in turn influence the outcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He definitely is. Or I really want him to be. He's a qt.</br>  <br>So absorbing an evil androgynous alien makes you more well endowed?</br>  <br>Conservation of matter, or whatever. If you're storing it inside you it has to go somewhere.</br>  Poor girl got publicly penetrated by JJ on national television.  <br>Maybe she's just getting fat.</br>  What do the colors mean?  <br>I love the irony of a raging homo being trapped inside huge tits.</br>  <br>They would be R34 levels of huge if what you're saying is true, which is not.</br>  <br>That scene is so hot.</br>  <br>Maybe Katze is bisexual? He even called OD a gay insult this episode</br>  <br>I noticed that JJ-dono is also wearing women's shoes. Is this a trend between aliens?</br>  <br>But it was just the Note that she shoved in there.</br>  <br>Assuming Gelsadra isn't actually the Big Bad...</br>  <br>He just hates OD.<br>Remember when he kisses men he ravages their mouths, but the one time he kissed a chick it was a little peck. Dude's really gay.</br></br>  <br>It set me on fire.</br>  <br>Is this just overall or is it associated with one of the factions? The colors are kind of like what Gel was doing but the breathing relates back to Tsubasa and her great-grandfather.</br>  <br> being this slow </br>  <br>It's just the character designer. She loves high heels, even for males.</br>  <br>He already did stuff with those colors in [C]<br>"Good evening. Are you feeling well? As you can see right now, the ending theme of TV series [C] mostly uses three colors, and does that on purpose. These three colors are cyan, magenta and yellow, and these colors were chosen to represent Kimimaro, Mashu and the Financial District, respectively. They were deduced by the color of worn clothes and overall visual impression. Basically, cyan = Kimimaro, magenta = Mashu, and yellow = the Financial District. This is why the cube that is the central point of the ending visuals stays cyan for the whole time and without changing its color to magenta, for example.<br><br>Moreover, cyan, magenta and yellow become black if you mix them together. This is, in a word, the future. The future, a mental phenomenon that cannot be observed, stays covered in darkness to us who can only live in the present (This is why the words about “bright future” have such a great impact. Because the future is usually dark, and one is relieved when there is hope about it). However, as the future is always the result of your own actions, like when cyan=Kimimaro, cyan=Mashu and yellow=District are mixed together, everyone should not hesitate and mix other colors together. As this theme will get developed in more detail soon, I thought I should take the risk and tell you about it now."</br></br></br></br>   there are people not expecting Gelsandra to be the big bad   <br>dat smug</br>  <br> alien with "good" intentions <br> looks like satan <br><br>It's Sinestro all over again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least she's not called Maleficent.</br>  <br>She's cute, she can't be evil. I'm sure she'll take care of all the red CROWDS without any trouble, too.</br>  I will assume the half-and-half here is Berg as red and Hajime as gray. She covers her eyes as things become all red, possibly because her eyes change to be Berg's, and then it transitions to all gray as she uncovers them.<br><br>Is this the deepest OP of the year so far?</br></br>  QUALITY feet.  tfw even fatalpulse realized hajimes hajimes got bigger  <br><br><br><br>Paiman and Katze say she is not bad, so if she fucks something up it won't be on purpose</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Apparently, with Hajimessu already providing the T&amp;A portion of the PLOT, Tsubasa will be providing the thigh and midriff portion.<br><br>I am more than okay with this.</br></br>  <br>Because they can't possibly be wrong?</br>  Tsubasa is the tallest Gatcha girl now  <br>Paiman is not a reliable source at all, remember Mess? Katze isn't someone who's word should be trusted</br>  <br>She has good intentions wil bad results and she will try to "unite" everyone into a single hivemind.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? There's nothing QUALITY about that shot or those feet. They're obviously not footservice level feet, because the focus of that shot is clearly meant to be Tsubasa's delicious thighs.<br><br><br>And now Hajime is even shorter in contrast. It's perfect!</br></br></br></br>  <br>"good" or "evil" depends of point of view.</br>   Paiman not drawn with his "awakened" eyes <br>Why is this allowed</br>  <br>Those are just his "getting serious" eyes, the blank black ones are his default. He wasn't drawn with them like after that moment, right?</br>  <br>I want to lick those thighs.</br>  <br> Paiman and Katze say she is not bad <br>If Katze told you it was cool to jump off a cliff, would you do it?</br></br>   Rui's pose <br>My dick</br>  Wait, so Katze just called OD a faggot in this episode, but isn't Katze gay himself?<br><br>Is this just a joke that I overthought?</br></br>  <br>Katze is asexual.</br>  <br>Delicious best legs.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't <br><br> GatchaGatchaGatchaGatchaGatchaGatc<wbr>haGatchaKATZEGatchaGatchaGatcha</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>I probably would, but that's just because Katze seems like he'd be really good at persuading/torturing you into it.</br>  <br>This is my favorite op this season for now. The music is nothing special but the animation and cinematography is amazing.</br>  <br>And yet everything he does has some sexual undertone?</br>  <br>Is there a scorebook for sale or something? Where's that from?</br>  <br>I dunno.<br><br>But they always go back to saying Katze is like a child and just wants to play.<br>He's flamboyant as all shit though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> OD is maybe gay. <br> maybe </br></br>  <br>That might just be how people are on his planet... maybe it was one big gay planet.</br>  <br>But he's half human, too, so do we also apply human standards to him?</br>  Why did Sugane turn into Vergil?  <br>Have you seen him fucking men? He has only been acting as a very exaggeration gay stereotype, but he hasn't done anything legit gay so far.</br>  <br>You mean aside from scoping out Baracchi? Admittedly that might just make him bi.</br>  <br>He did think the Fire chief was cute.</br>  <br>Admiration.</br>  I think OD is  cute   <br>Dude almost hugged her to death in the Director's Cut of Crowds, you tell me.</br>  <br>An insecure man might be afraid of expressing his admiration towards another man, but OD certainly doesn't seem very insecure, does he now? He likes to play the role of an obnoxious character. It is very likely he thinks it makes him more human.</br>  <br>He calls him Okama.<br><br>Katze is a shapeshifting pansexual.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you not hug your comrade that just made something very noble? You know, like putting away the evil overlord inside your body, risking your life and sanity for humanity.</br>  <br> He <br>Watch yourself shitlord</br></br>  <br>He's an okama, anon. He's gay.<br><br>Go and check out his profile in the guide. GAY.</br></br></br>  who's Rizumu?  <br>Sure, but gauging his reaction to everyone else in the situation, it seems like he cares the most.<br><br>And hey, would you blame him? Imagine Hajime died and you never got to motorboat that rack!</br></br></br>  <br>He's not in love with her or attracted to her like that.<br><br>The only ones who are might be Utsutsu or Rui. He might have fallen for Load before he found out Rui was a guy. Rui was his love interest when he was female in the prototype.</br></br></br>  I swear some of you could watch any of these characters fuck the everloving shit out of each other for a full episode, and you would still say they did it out of nothing but pure admiration.  <br>Fuck yourself back to tumblr and keep that shit to yourself.</br>  <br>do you really think he was serious</br>  <br>You are so easily baited.</br>  <br>Maybe she mistakes solidarity for "good atmosphere" because of Tsubasa's shitty explanation</br>  <br>On this site, I can never quite tell the ratio of people being ironic and people being fucking idiots. And when it comes to a show renowned for have an xboxhueg tumblr following, I'd rather not take chances.</br>  <br>And why does he wear the mask?</br>  <br>spoiler: fucking nobody on 4chan is tumblr, even the trannies on /lgbt/ mock them.</br>  <br>So you are easily baited.</br>  From the previous thread:<br> Tsubasa's suit is #60, which chronologically makes her the oldest gatchaman after Paiman and OD. It may just be an old suit getting reused though. </br>  <br>Suits are representative of the Gatcha. The more likely reason is that she's taking the seat of an off-world Gatcha who died.</br>  <br>What if she inherited the suit from someone?<br>Like her great grandpa for example.</br></br>  <br>But as you say, suits are personalised and therefore highly unlikely to be able to inherit a suit from somebody else.<br><br><br>Can you even stop being a Gatchaman?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's plenty of Tumblr on /v/. They're usually pretty blatant though.</br>  <br> Can you even stop being a Gatchaman? <br>Well Katze quit but it's not like JJ appeared and shoved his soul back in to his chest or something.</br></br>  <br>What if it was her great grandpa's brother's? The grandpa was praying to his brother's memorial in the show.</br>  <br>And /co/, where they're also blatant about it.</br>  <br>Could be. I was just wondering why grandpa had a gray thought bubble like Hajime.</br>  <br>I think that's related to "patience" or "waiting". Hajime, despite her spontaneity and quickness to act when absolutely needed, usually takes her time and thinks things through, especially at the end of S1 before she faced Katze. The old man has been waiting for Tsubasa to mature, giving him the same color. It's interesting they showed it to us this way that Hajime's color wasn't unique.</br>  <br>The special thing about gray bubbles is that they don't change into another color.<br>Maybe a certain state of mind makes you unable to be manipulated or influenced by others.</br></br>  <br><br>Shirou levels of broken.</br></br>  <br>POWDER BLUE</br>  <br>Hajime is already a hero of justice.</br>  Could someone post that gif/webm of Rui sitting alone with the fireworks?  <br>Anon, if anybody in this show is actually gay<br><br>Is definitely OD</br></br></br>  Tsubasa's suit is a full-blown "battle-type" suit with super-speed, super-strength and light beams.  <br>Did you miss the scene with the firefighter in episode 8?</br>   Gatchamen suits are bird inspired <br> Tsubasa's is a cat <br>this bugs my autism</br></br>  <br> The Broken Child will Reveal Itself <br><br>Even JJ knows bitch is cray</br></br></br>  <br> telling a cute little girl NOT to touch your boobs <br>You're right, he's a fucking faggot.</br></br>  <br>it's questionable if OD's even a guy or has a gender<br>I mean, who knows what kind of fucked up genes you'd get if you're half alien half human</br></br>  <br>Yeah. But he is male now and Sugane not the MC so is irrelevant to keep bringing that up</br>  <br>So can someone remind what the fuck happened at the end of the last season? Some shit just doesn't seem to be right with the new season.</br>  <br>You didn't watch episode 12 Director's Cut with 15 min of new content nor episode 0, right?</br>  <br>If you haven't seen the Directors' Cut of the last ep, you should.</br>  <br>Okama gender is a difficult thing to convey from Japanese, and it's usually more complicated than just "gay." For example, Leeron says he's "neither man nor woman," while you learn in the second Tiger &amp; Bunny movie that Fire Emblem is both man and woman at once.</br>  <br>It's relevant because Hajime and Sugane don't have anything romantic going on. They only hang out together a lot in the first season because Sugane was her partner, Rui became her partner next and now is Tsubasa.</br>  why does Rui wear wigs??<br>I think her hairs better.</br>  <br><br>Okama can be:<br><br>flamboyant gay man<br>or<br>bigender<br>or transsexual character<br><br>It's a catch all. Calling OD "she" isn't inaccurate (unlike tumblr that insists Rui's trans when it's most likely OD).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true, but if the Tunnel incident demonstrated anything, it's that she's also fucking nuts.</br>  <br> The only character I like is Hajime. <br>Things people never say.</br></br>  <br>I like Hajime the most, but I also like the rest of the characters.</br>  <br>I recall several anons saying that last season. Personally, I like everyone so far.</br>  <br> her <br> inb4 he's a girl as long as he's wearing a skirt </br></br>  <br> her </br>  <br>I'd fuck him either way</br>  <br>Though it begs the question if Hajime has always been grey or if she's grey because she doesn't know what to do, or just started waiting on something. It's not like color = personality. Katze says something that'd make you think that she's always, but we do see she can have changes of mood and temperament in season 1</br>  Hajime and the old man are both enlightened and share the clean gray.  <br>Well I wasn't talking about Sugane having feelings for Hajime because is obvious he doesn't, at least not that way<br><br>Is just that there's no point in bringing up that Rui was originally female and MC Sugane's love interest because a lot has been changed since then and all its left is fujo baiting from the novels</br></br></br>  <br><br> Gatchaman <br> This <br><br>Hipster Heroes and Gatchaman pop art<br><br>Someone delivery me from this garbage</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder Hajime has that picture saved on her phone</br>  <br>well if it makes you feel any better, I think i speak for everyone when I say that we all watch it for Rui, am i right?<br><br>fuck yeah Im right, Rui best girl and boy.</br></br></br>  <br>I like crowds but it makes me sad to think what could have been</br>  <br>Who wouldn't save that picture.</br>  <br>Is that a trailer for something that never happened?</br>  <br>and the sky is blue.</br>  <br>that's an interesting fanmade trailer, why is Paipai a little boy? :&gt;</br>  <br>That's one of the three NTT commercials featuring Gatchaman.</br>  <br>I do too, what's your point?</br>  <br><br>Is weird to think Rui had a similar blue jacket to the one he wears now when he was 8</br></br>  Calling Chekhov's gun on Katze. He wouldn't still be a character if he had no role to play.<br>I can see Hajime getting knocked out or otherwise incapacitated and Katze taking control of her body and actually doing good with the excuse that Hajime is lots of fun.</br>  <br><br> Fanmade <br><br>HAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Loli Hajime is a miracle.</br>  <br>OST 1 came with an score book,</br>  <br>Well he's still an important character now, talking as much as possible and with the potential to take over her Gatchaman form at any time. That's when she's most vulnerable too.</br>  <br>Any scans?</br>  <br>He's into men, he had the hots for Sugane and Joe.</br>  <br>It has been two years, it's time to get over it.</br>  <br>Can't wait for Birdmen anime</br>  <br>Same here. I really enjoy crowds, but I also think that Yoru no Yatterman-type sequel would be rather nice. Ah well, at least as Katzefag I'm not as butthurt as others in the fandom.</br>  <br><br>No. Fuck You.<br><br>Gatchaman is older than you are you little kid it gets the Micheal Bay treatment and little kids like you who don't know any better adore it</br></br></br></br>  <br>lolwut</br>  <br>It's pretty much an entirely different thing.<br><br>Get over it.</br></br></br>  what anime has the most booty?

If you don't like breasts it's hard to believe you are heterosexual. It doesn't matter if you prefer them small, big, medium or whatever, as long as you appreciate them it's good.</br></br></br>  <br>nice buzzword.</br>  <br><br> objectively <br> clearly  <br>Yes, because tits vs ass is totally objective. God, you faggots are annoying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please more of those dank memes son.</br>  <br>My opinion is pretty much always correct though.</br>  Technically, a good combination of both creates a full curvy body that is more attractive to men with normal/high test levels. Preferring just tits however is a sign of low test since a good pair of tits can't create a full curvy body.  <br>Vividred</br>  <br>Technically wide hips don't have to mean a nice ass so just having an ass doesn't mean much. <br><br>Hips and ass are different categories, but most people seem to group them together. <br><br>Tits and hips are more important to be than butt.</br></br></br></br></br>  I absolutely love nice, shapely, pillowy, bountiful tits.<br><br>But I can also appreciate a flat chest or modest pair of breasts.<br><br>HOWEVER I WILL NEVER ACCEPT A WOMAN WITHOUT AT LEAST A DECENT BEHIND. I'm sorry, but I just can't. There are so many wonderful aspects of the female form. But... the ass is just too important. So it will always take priority in my mind. Forgive me, brothers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>this tbh</br>  Tell me /a/, what makes you prefer ass or tits over the other?<br><br>Bothfags need not apply</br></br>  <br>Ass isn't the only thing that creates a curvy body. Waist and hips is what gives you the curvy shape. Neither ass nor tits is what determines it. <br><br>If you're looking at the profile than an ass adds as much curviness as the tits. <br><br>I like both. I'm just saying this theory is fault. A lot of women have wide hips and a great waist to hip ratio but no ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Small butts are very cute. Flat is a different story. <br><br>Flat chests turn me off equally.</br></br></br>  Good Butts coming through.  <br>I don't know what you consider "decent" but small asses were always my preference. Small boobs too. Of course, I can appreciate all body types as long as they're slender.</br>  <br> not posting the gif </br>    <br> not posting the gif </br>  <br>Let's be real.

There's a reason why people think he's black.

All we know is that they did lay in bed together.</br>  are the damedame subs just machine translation or outright parody? also are they good?  <br>True, thanks<br><br><br>The latter probably<br><br><br>I thought they had separate beds? Mind posting a pic to refresh my memory?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably depends on how seriously Pucci took his vow of chastity. Catholic priests do that right</br>  David Productions created the worst adaptation of JoJo I've ever seen.  <br>You should be able to figure this out by yourself</br>  <br> Implying Gold Experience isn't a BtD-style powered up stand already <br>the events of Black Sabbath could explain why GE has so many broken-ass powers</br></br>  <br>They were in the same bed.</br>  I'm morbidly curious as to what would happen if you knit Jolyne up into a scarf or something. <br><br>Would she be able to unravel herself? Would she be into it?<br><br>How long do you think you could get her to stay like that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dunno. Yes. Dunno.</br>  <br>That  fet is h  an interesting question. It depends on how much you unravel; there is a point to which she will die.

I just cant think of a name. Who is that in your picture, btw?</br>  <br> Just fanart of human Indominus. </br>  <br>It was a joke faggot, and technically he makes up parts of Josuke.</br>  <br>Achtung Baby</br>  <br>Superman would be Giorno and his "I win" Stand.<br>Batman would probably be Gyro; he doesn't have powers until his fight with Funny Valentine and relies on his wits and his steel balls for survival</br></br>  <br>Oh right on. It kinda looked kid a fujo fanart version of Hody Jones from One piece but I didn't want to presume</br>  <br>I knew there was a Stand User with those powers in the series I couldn't remember! Thanks!</br>  When will Kanye West be used in JoJo?  I don't exactly remember but was anything done with Kira's testicle-lacking body in Part 8?  <br> Hody Jones <br>Fuck, it does look sorta like him.  The shittiest shounen Villian I've laid eyes on in a while </br></br>  <br>Araki is probably saving him for a JoBro role in Part 8 or a villian role</br>  <br>You take vows when you become a priest and he wasn't one yet at the time. He also murdered people, so who knows how seriously he took vows.</br>  <br>Plus, he regarded Dio as much as God himself.</br>  <br>He was pretty much introduced to flesh out the race theme of Fisman island and to be the Strawhats punching bag. He did those two things pretty well, even if Shirahoshi keeping quiet about him murdering her mother was a little retarded</br>  <br> he wasn't one yet at the time <br>Oh yeah, you're right. but he didn't kill anyone yet though. His actions led to his sister's suicide and some officers deaths but he didn't kill. Pucci also read sleazy sleazy books didn't he?</br></br>  <br>So I guess the only question to answer is "Would Pucci fuck God?"<br><br>Would YOU fuck God?</br></br></br>  <br>I did like Fishmen island but as a Villian Hody was such a damn let down, considering he was suppose to better than Arlong.</br>  <br>I think it's the other way around. Would you receive the blessing that is God's phallus up your butt?</br>  <br> Superman is OP and boring <br>This again. Superman is featherweight compared to some of DC's cosmic villians like Darkseid and The Anti-monitor. Thats why he often needs assistance from the rest of the Justice league and other allies to take members of his Rouges Gallery down</br></br>  <br>let god come unto you</br>  <br>He took survivor and probably some other discs, which I'm guessing killed folks considering how Emporio's mom turned out.<br>And yes, he read lewd books.</br></br>  <br>true, I haven't read any superman comics and haven't payed attention to much and know that he's not immune to magic and things like that<br><br>forgive me ;_;<br><br> GER vs superman, who would win? I go with GER </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I could imagine DIO swaying him somehow. <br> DIO needed a friend who had no interest in sex. <br> Fucks Pucci once. <br> Pucci is no longer interested in sex. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course GER. Hell, even Superboy-Prime at his highest can't beat GER.</br>  <br>True. Guess it shows how far the Strawhats have come since Arlong. If he had actually trained like Luffy did instead of doping he would've been harder to take down than Doffy. Jinbe is a perfect example of how OP fishmen can be if the trained</br>  <br> How Joseph was able to make the plane fly using hermit purple <br><br>Wasn't it implied he had technokensis of some sort? I mean in part 4 Jotaro says that it can go through wires and manipulate technology just like Red Hot Chili Peppers.</br></br></br>  <br>GER</br>  <br><br>Ebony Devil, depending on your interpretation.</br></br>  <br>What if Dio has tons of charisma and everyone wants to fuck him but he's actually REALLY REALLY BAD at actual sex? <br><br>That would be the most hilarious thing</br></br></br>  <br>I, DIO, am the BEST at sex</br>  <br>Golden Experience Requiem. I think the only way to beat GER is to move the battle to another place of existence where hopefully its powers dont work. Its impossible to fight an ability that nullifies and reverses any action you make against its user</br>  <br> tfw he killed most of those women he slept with cause they told him he sucked. </br>  Some person claims a friend of his was at AX and Kars is going to be voiced by Steve Blum in the dub.  <br>It was cremated.</br>  <br><br> I, DIO <br> Yeah see that's the problem hon, it's all about you isn't it? </br></br></br>  <br>Or it is able to be beyond existence like Yog-Sothoth or Elder God Demonbane.</br>  <br><br>Dio had serious confidence issues after that incident with Erina</br></br>  <br>I,DIO AM BEST!! ZA WARUDO!!!!!!<br>WRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY<wbr>YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</wbr></br></br>  <br>What is GER was actually the way to attain HEAVEN and Dio and Pucci were wrong? Because living a life where you literally cannot be harmed by anything or anyone ever could be seen as some form of HEAVEN. Characters in Jojo's are always calling enemy stands "invincible" but the only ture "invincible" stand is GER</br>  <br> Pucci_disgusted.png <br>If you're going to do this dumb shit, there are better expressions.</br></br>  <br>GER is the ultimate defense. It is not the ultimate offense though.</br>  <br>Are you implying the Pucci.png you posted is disgusted?</br>  <br>Dio uses Za Warudo during sex to regain his stamina so he doesn't cum early</br>  <br> during sex the women begin to notice that every few seconds DIO shouts out Za Warudo. <br> He never seems to cum. </br></br>  Do you think stands can have sex?<br><br>I'm serious even if this is a shitpost</br></br>  <br>It is the ultimate defense in terms of killing you dead though. It can ORA ORA ORA you without fear of reprisal and can kill you for eternity. Thats pretty OP offense</br>  <br> How Giorno was able to turn a piece of Purple haze, a stand, into a snake, a physical object. <br>he never did that<br><br>Yes he did. He made a vaccine for the Purple haze virus by turning it into a snake to aquire an antivenom.<br><br>It was the most bullshit thing every</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't really have genitals but you could probably get a handjob</br>  <br>Thanks to your weird ass covers I discovered that pink kryptonite turns Superman gay.</br>  <br>Isn't time stopping a stamina draining power?<br><br><br>They say the best offense is a good defense.<br><br><br>What do you think happens when The Hand tries to finger someone?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With humans or each other?<br><br>Either way the answer's probably 'yes'<br><br>Stand-on-Stand sex is probably especially fulfilling for the users because you're having sex with your body and mind, in a way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They say the best defense is a good offense<br><br>Or is it the other way around?? Either way, GER's power can be seen as offensive and defensive imo<br><br><br><br><br>fucking kek, thank you for your serious replies anons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Giorno and Joseph are asspull personified characters. Theres a good reason Joseph's luck got nerfed in Pt. 3 and Giorno never showed up to kick Puccis ass in Pt.6, though frankly it'd have been a nice addition to the theme of how children defy parents expectations if he'd shown up to wreck his fathers boytoys plan.</br>  <br>Yeah I was thinking stand on stand sex, maybe at the same time as user on user sex.<br><br><br>Hmm, well he is called the hand, not the finger, so I think she would be alright</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there was an image where Dio and Kira imitated their stands' infamous pose, your post reminded me of it.</br>  <br>Stands probably wouldn't be able to have full on sex, it'd be more like rubbing against each other. But since users can feel everything the stands feel, it probably feels like indirect fucking.</br>  <br>When I was reading Part 6 I was thinking that weather report was Giorno  the Joestar birthmark and his golden hair horns, I thought the white hair was fake stupid hair. I figured Pucci had taken GE(R) from him and someone Giorno was able to use a stand called weather report </br>  <br> Joseph <br> luck <br><br>Only luck he ever had was gaia throwing his arm. Everything else was skills and planning.<br><br>Giorno literally pulls powers out his ass every chapter and literally has ultimate lifeform kars as his stand.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying that GE's real power isn't to make up convenient powers when needed </br>  <br>I thought that was Whitesnake's power.</br>  <br>I though the was Josuke</br>  <br>I figured it was Pucci's power, and thus having mastered the power of asspulling he developed a stand(s). <br><br>Anyone know how the fuck Dio managed to think up the green baby and any of that heaven shit? Like is he a fucking wizard?</br></br></br>  <br>He sucked something that was close to Joestar blood and wrote everything down in his diary. I don't think he actually thought it was going to work.</br>  <br>I'd like to imagine Dio being high as balls and writing all this shit down while Pucci taking it seriously   and it actually worked </br>  <br>he turned a brick into a snake. Because Life always finds a way, the snake developed immunity to the virus. Then Giorno injected himself with snake ichor to gain immunity in his on heart, which is still pretty asspull.</br>  <br>Can someone actually lay out DIO's plan in a manner that would make some degree of sense? Every time I try to think about his plan and the extraordinary degree of luck it would take to make it work, my head starts spinning. Its more like a "best case scenario" than a "foolproof plan"</br>  <br> 02▶ <br> File: Pucci_after.png (380 KB, 309x466) <br> Gay Priest is here now. <br>ty</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, it's really simple. First you have to find 30 something sinners and then Dio destroys his stand and at the same time absorbs the souls of those sinners (in the case of SO Pucci just used his bone) which gives birth to a baby. Then Pucci whispers some words to the baby that Dio previously carved into The World so that the baby would know it's him and they'll fuse somehow to make a whole new stand, C-Moon (Do you believe in 「GRAVITY」). Then you take C-Moon to the Kennedy Space Center at the right place at the right time for it to get even more gravity and it becomes super gravity, MiH.<br><br>Simple.</br></br></br>  <br>Dio plans to fuse The World with a certain number of powerful souls. 38 criminals'souls. For that he must destroy his stand temporarily. This was a gamble.<br>A friend will say the 14 words password to fuse with the result. This friend is Pucci<br>Pucci now wields a human-stand hybrid which has the power to bring their idea of Heaven.<br>Now Pucci needs a place with the exact gravitational conditions to unlock MiH, this was Cap Canaveral, how he came to that conclusion is unknown.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Joseph sounds so boooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<wbr>ooooooooooooooooooooooooooring</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Its official; this shit makes no sense. But thanks for explaining as best you could. Its Araki's fault for making such a nonsensical plan that involved things that he failed to establish (like stands absorbing souls and GRAVITY). Fuck it, I'll just keep going along with this ride</br></br>  <br>Part 6 is just outright nonsensical halfway though.</br>  Does anyone have that one picture of the Jojoilon cast traced over the Phantom Blood volume 1 cover? I've been scrounging pixiv for it, but no luck.  Wait shit, are all his pictures album covers?  <br>Tell me about it. I'm re-reading Pt.6 and I have to take a break every twenty to thirty minutes so I can ground myself somewhat.

Only reason George Joestars killer was alive was because DIO was still alive at the bottom of the sea<br><br> Was Mintaka actually an alien or a stand user <br>Obviously a stand user. Just because he couldn't see stands doesn't mean anything. Lots of stands don't follow basic rules like judgement not killing the user when destoryed. He even has a Stand card so hes a stand user.<br><br>Everything I don't have a clue, but everything I listed is absolute.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> part 5  <br> animated <br> least popular part <br> inb4 some fag says it's the most popular one WITH NO SOURCES, stardust crusaders always topped top lists </br></br></br></br>  <br>"this must be the work of an enemy stand."</br>  <br>There's no way we can know if it activates by movement (think of it was millions of tiny fanblades on his palm that start cutting/spinning only when moved), or by just touching him palm without moving.<br><br><br>A way to figure out it's mechanism is to perform an experiment: put The Hand in a small room (with enough room for Okuyasu of course) and just have his hand be still. If Okuyasu passes out (the hand obliterated the breathable air in the room) or the room starts collapsing by itself (from the space in the room disappearing) that would prove that The Hand works by just things touching his hand, and no movement. <br>I think that would be incredibly stupid, so I'd like to think it's only by movement.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading part 4, liking it so far.</br>  <br>If she ever acquired a Stand, what do you think Lisa Lisa's would have been?</br>  <br><br><br>I'm pretty sure that when he was introduced it was specifically stated he had to do a "cutting" motion, otherwise how would the Stand know what to "cut out"?</br></br></br>  <br>Shit. So basically getting a handjob from The Hand is like picking your poison.<br> Get your dick obliterated straight away <br> Starts the handjob and obliterates your dick while stroking </br></br></br>  <br>What happened to Achtung Baby? How come she never shows up later as JoJo helper? <br>Or does she, I've only read up to five so far.</br></br>  <br>She never shows up again.</br>  <br>Well, so much for that.</br>  <br>She did, she was there during the entirety of act 6</br>  <br> Dio has all joestar powers <br>no<br><br>crazy diamond has a limit to what he can repair, but it's never been made clear. i think if somethingn has been a certain way for a certain time, it can't be changed back. I think Dio just used some of his blood or some other nonstand related bullshit.<br><br>Everything else you said I agree with, eve Mintaka. I think he was just a crazy guy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My guess would be something related to hamon. Either something that would complement her ripple technique, like Joseph having whips that very much resemble in use the strings he used in Part 2 fights, or something that has to do with ripple powers like healing etc.</br>  <br>Mintaka probably could see Stands, he was just a nutball. Probably why his Stand was so versatile as well, dude was not stable. I wish it was named Mothership Connection though.</br>  <br> only other part to get its own video game <br> got the a lot of characters in asb like three <br> screaming fan girls in character release videos <br> it actually gets merch <br>whatever you say anon</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does /a/ hate Vento Aureo so much? I finished it two days ago and I enjoyed it quite a bit. What does /a/ not like about it?  <br> Josuke restored a table back into a tree </br>  <br>you just posted it</br>  <br> i think if somethingn has been a certain way for a certain time, it can't be changed back <br><br>Turning a road into tar, turning a wooden table into a tree</br></br></br>  <br>So why does /a/ hate Giorno then? Hes not that bad of a Jojo</br>  <br>Sleeping Slaves was awesome.`</br>  <br> Chuuni who wants to be an alien <br> suddenly shapeshifting power <br> awww sweet I am special <br> learn of people like you <br> fuck, not so special anymore <br> it's alright, my delusion still works here, just have to do some bluffing <br> I can't actually see those <br> not special enough <br> I've got it, sirens! <br>seems a reasonable theory</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Regardless, you people keep saying "turn back into it's original form". Pucci's foot was in it's original form. CD can fuse objects or revert them back to their original form, not just change them to whatever the fuck his wants. What do you suppose Dio fused with Pucci's foot to fix it? Also, doesn't the stand have to be out to fix something?</br></br>  <br>Why does Joseph have an English accent, he grew up in New York.<br>Also, <br> The asian memeVA is voicing Johnathan  <br> With a shitty forced English accent <br>This is so bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what you're referencing sorry</br>  <br> CD can fuse objects or revert them back to their original form, not just change them to whatever the fuck his wants <br><br>Angelo.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikitaka</br>  r8?  <br>I would fucking hope that it's not animated in the same style as the new anime.<br><br>That would be like a fucking punch in the balls.</br></br></br>  <br> grew up in new york <br><br>He fused him with a rock didn't he? Either way, CD's powers aren't explained enough and just saying fucking Dio had them is stupid  becuase I don't agree with it, of course </br></br></br>  <br> ayylmao/10 </br>  <br> &gt;grew up in new york <br>He did, didn't he?</br></br>  <br><br>Because he's boring just like Johari and the later protagonist put GioGio to shame.</br></br>  <br>Their skin's kinda pale there</br>  <br> He even has a Stand card <br>It's an ability, not a stand</br></br>  <br>When he bought the soda, the vender noticed his english accent and said you're not from around here, are you? Either way it would make sense since he learned english from his english grandmother.</br>  <br>I don't think anybody here "hates" any part of Jojo, Vento Aureo is just a low ranking part for a lot of people. Mostly because of Giorno and the translation.<br><br> 7 = 4 &gt; 1 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 </br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, that dude voice every fucking protagonist and doesn't even change his voice<br><br>Vash<br>Luloche<br>Ichigo<br>Yu narukami<br><br>He sounds nothing like a gentleman, a Brit, or what Johnathan should sound like. Honestly I'd rather antfish than this garbage.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, he doesn't have an accent in SDC. These niggas are shitty dubbers.</br>  <br>It's okay but their skin is way too fucking pale and shading would make it look better.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gdx<wbr>L4nkCPrc</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>I tried making Mikitaka a little bit pale  because lmao's </br></br>  <br>And? That doesn't explain Okuyasu</br>  <br>I actually like the SC test dub</br>  <br> he grew up in New York. <br>Anon pls</br></br>  <br>I wouldnt mind the dub to be like this, but they should of just kept star platinum's voice the same<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZUi<wbr>0L28WJyc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>SDC was a test dub and DIO didn't have an accent there, either. They're obviously going to have some changes if they dub those episodes again.</br>  <br>Yeah me too, it'll just take me a little time to adjust to it. Do you think it would have been better to give avdol a "muslim" accent? Or are you glad with their decision to give him some uppity sounding american one?</br>  <br>To add on, he does eventually live in New York for the rest of his life, so his accent would definitely diminish (I think). He has a full american with no trace of british accent in the test dubs for SC.</br>  tfw Stroheim was the best brojo and he died before he could help Joseph in part 3  <br>I tried to make the shadding harder in okusayu but i think it failed, anyways fixed </br>  <br>Stroheim would have used science to build lasers that could hurt Stands.</br>  <br> Crazy Nazi Cyborg who shows up like three times <br> Best brojo <br> Even the best of Part 2 when Caesar existed <br><br>Shit taste</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fixed <br>No it isn't...</br></br>  <br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=&amp;v=<wbr>QAuHQphwJLY<br><br> SEEMS LIKE THEY TOOK THE JO FROM HIS FIRST NAME AND THE JO FROM HIS LAST NAME AND PUT EM' TOGETHER <br> ＭＡＮ　ＴＨＡＴ’Ｓ　ＬＡＭＥ </br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>His sounded like a bassy black man.<br>I was cool with it.</br></br>  <br>Anon, are you forgetting THAT GERMAN SCIENCE IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD?</br>  <br>Star Platinum needed to be the same. but overall captured the mood very well.</br>  <br> "You speak really good Japanese." ~Man speaking English to English speaker <br><br>I keked as well</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that could have been changed.<br><br><br>It IS really lame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like Avdol's voice in this</br>  We'll never get more of Test Dub Polnareff.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p2o<wbr>FsNQQ68E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I like to think we're moving past the Sailor Moon days of every dub moving the setting to America for no reason.<br><br>The setting's pretty clearly Japan (until they start traveling anyway), the protagonist is Japanese, etc. etc. It'd be condescending to the audience to pretend otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was good. :P<br>Here's dio<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J_-<wbr>iyhQLiKM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Funimation gets the rights to Jojo in America</br>  <br> he grew up in New York <br><br>He didn't move to New York until he was 19.</br></br></br>  <br> Kock yo in </br>  <br>eh...</br>  <br>The style is really good, how's it bad?</br>   Johnathan <br>Why the fuck is Johnny Yong Bosch voicing him. Hes not asian or an angsty twink. Fuck and forced british accent that just makes it even worse 1/10<br><br> DIO <br>A slight hint of sensual and malevolence to him. Its passable. 6/10<br><br> Speedweed <br>Cockney without being too outlandish or stereotypical. 8/10<br><br> Joseph (young) <br>Forced british accent that sounds more geniune than his actual british granny and grandfather. Has some playfulness to it. 5/10<br><br> Joseph (older) <br>Richard Epcar voices all old people in anime and its fucking gotten old. Jesus christ get some new blood. And you didn't even give him the accent he had as a kid wtf. 3/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon, Warner Bros. already has the rights. Bang Zoom! is doing the dubbing.</br>  <br>Now I realize that I only like Jotaro's and Dio's voice from the test dub. The rest sounds more like they're just reading instead of acting, most of the time.</br>  <br>I liked smokey, what do you think about him?</br>  <br>I agree with this rating.<br>The mansion fight is my favorite fight and I have ZERO hope that JYB can BRING IT</br></br>  <br>I like joseph's voice :/</br>  <br> And you didn't even give him the accent he had as a kid wtf. <br>Kind of hard to when the SDC test dub came before that one, m8. They probably gave young Joseph an accent because of so many people complaining Dio and Joseph didn't have any in the test dub.</br></br>  <br>Eh, to be fair Jotaro is half english</br>  <br>I hope Jotaro gets Patrick Seltz. His sad Dandy voice is great for Jotaro. At the same time, his Dandy voice in general is good for young Joseph</br>  <br>Space Dandy? But that was Ian Sinclair, not Patrick Seitz.</br>  <br>No, he's half American with British and Italian ancestry.</br>  <br><br> :P <br> :/ <br>Stop that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jolyne is wasted potential in terms of personality.</br>  I find it really hard to judge young Joseph's English voice until we actually hear him more of him yelling and shit. All of these clips are when he was acting all calm and cool, even Sugita's delivery in these scenes sounded different from his usual Joseph.  <br>No way, Dandy's voice is too old-sounding for Young Joseph. Joseph definitely needs to sound like a young guy just out of childhood.</br>  <br>You right, you right. In that regard, Sweet JP is what I imagine as Young Joseph's voice.</br>  <br>Patrick Seitz already voices Dio.<br><br>Matt Mercer is a pretty good Jotaro though.</br></br></br>    <br>Right, I think Joseph has some potential.<br>His VA can get playful, so I hope we get more of that.<br><br>Speedwagon had it best, and the "Father/Son" speech was transitioned very well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it matter? I just meant his other half spoke english</br>  So Rolling Stones was the reason why Buccellati was tough as nails?  <br><br>Jolyne could've had the most complex character traits, especially her relationships with everyone was based on how much she could truly trust others. I was kind of disappointed how she started trusting everyone so easily, even though she had gotten screwed over by those she loved in the past.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much</br>  <br>THIS. I haven't heard a lot of Diskin's roles but as Numbah 1 and Numbah 2, he could definitely bring the emotion and ham it up. And what we've seen so far has been good, I haven't lost faith in him yet. He's the one I'm most stoked for (after finding out the atrocity that is Jonathan Yong Bosch, jesus christ).</br>  <br>I know some hate the Cockney accent, but Speedwagon was my favorite, too.</br>  <br>I think it does it well, without going too far.<br>Honestly, I don't really know what Speedwagon sounds like in my head.<br><br>But it's likely close to that.</br></br></br></br>  Is the stuff about Steve Blum as Kars in the English dub actually true?  <br>Speedwagon is supposed to be poor (or at least not high class) so it would make sense for him not to have "Queen's English" sound that many might associate with Britain.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/EkbRxzp7T9M?t=4m33<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]<br> Joseph's WRYYYYYYYY is better than DIO's </br>  <br>And it doesn't sound as needlessly breathy as Jonathan's. Which makes it sound better in relation.</br>    <br>The WRYYYY sounds best in HTTF with that weird effect put on it</br>  So Araki so far has named stands after<br> Tarot cards <br> Egyption gods <br> muscians/songs <br>What else do you think would be an acceptable medium to name stands after? I would be fine with gods from other religions, what else do you think would be good?</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vHP<wbr>2Z3go8Is</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=geI<wbr>H4iM-qqo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Aztec gods</br>  <br>Foods</br>  <br>Music references soudn good</br>  <br>Oh man I would be SO for this.

I have over 300 confirmed kills and I'm trained in Gorilla (sic) warfare, so just try it buddy." Then I'd walk away with a totally badass look on my face like ahhhhhhh yeah bitch.

How'd you know I prefer the leaner Vega just a bit more than his buff versions? Thank you Boxas and have a great week.  I should also make a proper ref too. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't we all?<br><br> I lurk around /v/ too, nothing to request there either. <br><br><br>I really have nothing to request and I was suffering from intense Hestia poisoning.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting my waifu Suzuna cheering for the US women's world cup team. Hope the weekend finds you all in good spirits.  <br>Hestia is shit and the only good thing about her clothes were the gloves.<br>I have never been so confused by a fad in my life.</br></br>  Requesting Mao!  <br>Would you draw her for me anon? Bwaka a cute and while I love my waifu and that will never change, I also appreciate cute art of characters I like and Tohka is one of them. It's a shame what MF has done to these threads, but at the bare minimum there's at least one other person who likes her and she's 100%anime related. <br><br>I respect your commitment to draw only for legit waifu fags though, keep doing God's work anon.</br></br></br>  <br>It's cool anon, just wanted to make sure you saw it. You got till next weekend to make a reference so get on that.</br>  <br><br>Welcome back Clioneanon! I haven't seen you request in a while I think. I hope you feel better and request more often, I love drawing crying.</br></br>  <br>Loki is the best.</br>  <br>You just have shit taste. Or you're just gay, only explanation for being confused about why people like a woman.</br>  <br>A ghost of the past that no one remembers or cares enough to mention my name in years. I'm better off being dead.</br>  <br>Woah, that looks nothing like her!</br>  <br>Get a load of this guy.</br>  <br>I was confused by the Hestia fad too, I was choking on her being shoved in my face all day. Poison, Hestia was a harsh poison slowly killing me.<br><br><br>Freya for life!</br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as you aren't Surtic, all is well.</br>  <br>I'm going to have the agree to disagree and say Loki for life.</br>  Anything that is SFW is fine by me, maybe something zanny/comical like a bunch of /m/ anons in cosplay trying to save Hitomi from something incredibly mundane or kidnapping her to do something /m/ related that is fun for them and not her.  <br>I'm glad you're a reasonable person.</br>  There are faggots that actually like manbody, manface, man personality shitty ass Loki.  <br> surtic <br>I've only seen him posting on /a/ once for over a year.</br></br>  <br>You'd probably like a load from that guy, queer.</br>    <br>I never feel any better, I am always in a constant state of being depressed. Still seeing Clione's face covered in tears gives me a tingly feeling in my chest and I really appreciate you drawing her sorrow for me. Only someone like me would be a bit more happy seeing his waifu suffering.</br>  <br><br>ok ok I gave her colors</br></br>  <br>Thank you drawfriend, I love it even though its lewd</br>  <br>Not OR, but nice colors. I think OR wanted the burger with black buns though.</br>  <br>Oops you are right, I was too excited to draw her. Here is a quick kind of fix.<br><br><br>You're welcome, crying girls are very cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have some nice taste, Loki was alright. Still Freya for life!<br><br><br>I was waiting for that adaption for the longest time but then the Hestia got a bit insufferable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You used to be cool, Shinjiro. You have fallen.</br>  <br>Alright alright simmer down, or take it to a different thread.</br>  <br>You linked the wrong post. </br>  Sorry to bother you again drawfriend but it seems you forgot the shirt thing on her left, or was that intentional?  <br>I'm not into jealous, Over - bearing cunt sandwich. <br> <br>What are you even saying, nigger?</br></br></br>  <br>No you're just into men.</br>  <br>ah not really, it was lewd to begin with, but thanks for noticing</br>  <br>I feel that tears show the truest emotion, everyone can relate to sorrow. Thank you again, though I feel like trash for always wanting to see Clione's pretty face in a frown and her beautiful eyes pouring tears out.</br>  <br>O-oh, o-okay...<br> Thanks again drawfriend for putting up with my selfishness </br></br>  If your waifu had a dick would you swallow her babyjuice?

And it ended on such a friggin sweet fluffy way too.</br></br></br></br>  .<br>Hyuuga Hinata’s thoughts had wandered over to a place beyond the sky again.<br>Neji nii-san…<br>Glancing out the waiting room’s window, she could see the blue sky free of any clouds.<br>I’m getting married.<br>She whispered those words inside her heart, and turned to look at the young man standing next to her.<br>Looking at the intense look on his face, her heart started thudding despite herself. Even though she’d always been looking at him, just being with him like this made her pulse rate pick up like it had the very first day she’d met him.<br>Naruto’s unflinching eyes were looking at the Hokage Monument, the faces of previous Hokage carved into rock.<br>Or rather, to be more accurate, he was looking at the carved face of Namikaze Minato. His dad.<br>Just looking at him as he did that, Hinata felt so full of emotion, her chest could burst.<br>Ahh, she thought. Right now, this second…<br>Standing next to the person she loved like this made her feel unbearably happy. She was so happy, she couldn’t even hope to express it with words.<br>This moment is bliss. Hinata thought, simply, honestly.<br>As she did, maybe he noticed she was looking, because his eyes turned to meet hers.<br>Hinata’s face turned red. She ended up fidgeting a little.<br>He gave her an embarrassed grin too. The serious look on his face turned into another one, innocent like a young boy. She adored every single one of his facial expressions.<br>Her father Hiashi and little sister Hanabi entered the waiting room.<br>It was almost time.<br>Hinata took Naruto’s arm, and held on tight.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Uzumaki Naruto and Hyuuga Hinata.<br>Their wedding ceremony now begins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks anon</br>   thumbs up on his own wedding photo <br> his house has a balcony with a view of the giant ass statue of his face <br>how fucking arrogant is this little shit</br></br>  <br>They really should make at least an OVA of this</br>  <br>more like 1 hour special episode</br>  <br>I still am in utter belief that fucking Naruto, one of the shittiest, managed to somehow redeem itself with its ending. I had so much anger and animosity towards it, but all I can feel is a bittersweet happiness at how it ended. God bless Kishimoto for having the best taste in ships.</br>  <br> they fucked that night </br>  fuck off  <br> Kurama watched the whole thing <br> Probably took over one of the Naruto's Clone and sandwiched her with Nardo </br></br>  <br>Is Pierot retarded enough not to do it?<br>The Konoha and Shikamaru Hidens are the only ones I've read, but they would make for some actually good material to make, instead of botched and sorely disappointing exam arcs.</br></br>  <br>iirc exam arc was they did back when shippuden was a thing but arc was scraped/unfinished so what they did is they continued the arc right before gai vs madara fight to gain time <br><br>also SP is huge NHfaggots and i bet they would make anime adaptations of at least 2 said books</br></br></br>  <br>My problem is that when you take something potentially interesting and useful for world/character building and make a half-assed mess of it not only are you producing some shitty filler, but wasting an opportunity for someone decent to do a good job of it later.<br><br>Skipping stage 3 in particular was truly stupid, almost as bad as promoting fucking everyone and even giving Neji a double promotion for kind of saving the Kazekage's life, but not promoting the MC for doing way more than that. It's fucking stupid.<br>At least stage 2 could have shown characters really grown and taking charge at the right points, but instead what we got was jobbing against joke characters and never really having a decent fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Naruto shopped Sasuke into this wedding photo later.</br>  <br>I don't think he knows how to computer much, he merely uses it to shitpost on ninja /a/.</br>  <br>newfag here, are these novels canon? were they made or supervised by kishimoto?</br>  <br>I think they are written by his assistants or something.</br>  <br>I dunno, but at least whoever write them seem to care more about the non Naruto and Sasuke characters more than Kishi does.</br>  <br>It supposed to be bridge between part 2 and 3</br>  <br>Is there actually going to be a part 3? Couldn't they at least wait 20 years like Dragon Ball did?</br>  <br>Gotta milk the dead cow while it still warm<br>And about dragonball theres still time to liquidify the bones and make milkshake</br></br>  <br>Nah. Only Sakura cuts herself and Sasuke into photos together.</br>  <br>Look at this smug cunt, marrying the man of her dreams and having a wonderful family.</br>  <br>He saved all sentient beings. He's entitled to some arrogance.</br>  <br>btw movie isnt released yet fujoshits already started to draw shit like this<br> tfw we probably get borumitsuki doujin before naruhina </br></br>  Do you guys like cute stuff?<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/vItnC</br></br>  <br>Where's that guy who always talks about lolinata and shotaruto?</br>  <br>right here<br>Naruhina a shit<br> ShotarutoLolinata the best <br>also Orochimaru, Madara and Shizune best waifu<br>gotta sleep</br></br></br></br></br>  I like the new ending.  <br>Pretty dick move not to invite Orochimaru and Kabuto</br>  <br>They would be stupids if they don't do it</br>  <br>How did Ino and Sai end up together?</br>  <br> Shikamaru's chapter <br>Damn he's an idiot, even Chouji realizes about it</br></br>  <br>Sasuke is the background aka Darkness</br>  <br>they must have retconned his gayness im order ro make shitty next gen kids<br><br>nh (and shikatema i guess) are the only good pairings to come out of the nardo end.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura pasting herself over Karin's picture and chimping out and making her kid cry at being reminded of the fact Sasuke doesn't care about her was the funniest thing to come out of gaiden</br>  <br>ino does some deep-sea diving into his mind in shikamaru hiden, that sorta kickstarts their relationship</br>  <br> Mind rape. </br>  <br>adorable as fuck</br>  <br><br> Ino <br> bigger than Temari <br><br>H-h-how?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ino does some deep-sea diving into his mind <br><br>Didn't she see how many penises were in there?</br></br></br>  <br>He's just drawing Ino. Where's the joke?</br>  <br>Back when this was first released, someone posted what all the wedding guests wrote in their guestbook, but it never showed up in this translation.Was that actually from this novel, or was I rused by some fanfic?</br>  <br>In the 4th panel.</br>  <br>Woosh.</br>  <br><br> trash <br> ino </br></br></br>  <br>he's clearly drawing Sakura</br>  Damn, that cute as fuck Temari in the novel. I want to see it in the anime so bad!  <br><br><br>Sai was never gay, just metrosexual</br></br></br>  <br>Look at fucking Chouji.<br><br><br>The thumbs up is just rightful mockery to NSfags for scoring Hinata.<br> That's right, it's Hinata! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chatte and LGT on suicide watch when?</br>     naruto episode comes out <br> 24min <br> 12 hours later there are subs <br> naruto movie comes out <br> 90min long <br> should take 45 to translate but people do other shit so, 1 week tops <br> takes a year to come out <br><br>Why</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't exactly rip in HD from a theater.</br>  <br>oh yeah<br><br>nvrm</br></br></br>  <br>Use your fucking head.</br>    <br>I'm not spoiled enough to say I require that.</br>  <br>She found out how fucking kinky was the Sai, and wanted in</br>  <br>They were "brothers" and had to work as underground assassins.

For what? <br> Maybe she felt awkward in front of such a fancy looking place? <br> If such a high class place had prices that were too high for him to afford, then of course Shikamaru was going to give up. He’d think it was a shame, but he would. But they wouldn’t ever know without going in and checking the place out. Whether his decision would be to go for it or pass, he’d still have to look at the rooms and hot springs. He had no way to work around it. It was going to be a problem if they just gave up right in front of the place’s doors. <br> “Temari, for now how about we just go in, and then you can think about it. Okay?” <br> “I– it’ll be too late to think about once we go in. I could get carried away with the atmosphere, so…” <br> “What do you mean?!” <br><br>GOD DAMN IT, WHY IS HE SO STUPID!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's an aussie camrip floating around and an HD Korean dub with shit subtitles.</br>  <br>Because he's a genius.</br>  Just downloaded this along with the specials.

Which is disappointing, because the manga is great. <br><br>All of the characters feel so hollow in the anime adaptation compared to the manga, they made the main cast into keion-tier husks.

Only LO is because she is a loli.</br></br>  <br>No it's because of that ahoge.</br>  <br> They aren't <br><br>But they are. The dull eyes do wonders to an otherwise plain and boring design.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Touma always have that, "Durr, what the fuck is going on?" look on his face in screenshots when he's doing something with a girl other than punching her face in?</br>  <br>Railgun is more popular than index and makes more cash.</br>  <br>Only the first season was. Index II sold more than Railgun S.</br>    <br>bumping</br>  <br> The Railgun anime adaptation is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.  <br><br>You really haven't seen much anime have you? <br><br>Season 2 was great if you stopped watching after episode 16.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares, give me more of both, but I prefer Index even with all the annoying magic shenanigans because I want more WW3.</br>  <br><br>Soon.<br><br>JC Staff is a great studio that won't let us down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's impossible now since the mediafire folder is also gone. Time to give it up anon, Ingun is garbage anyway.</br>  <br>They should have never changed the eyes.</br>  <br> questionable characters doing questionable things <br>Oh well, at least my favourite character didn't feed another favourite character of mine their own leg this time.</br></br>  <br>Most of those shows are literally shit on there. I like the shows they are adapting currently though.</br>  <br>All trash except for Azumanga.</br>  <br>I don't know how they gonna animate all the retarded shit that happened in the last third of OT.</br>  <br>Changing viewpoints every 15 minutes? Golden hands? I'm sure it won't be too bad unelss they decide to slideshow everything.</br>  <br>That helps too.<br><br><br>Mikoto's design is simple and plain, but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth. But also important is her fierce and..sparky personality that creates a bold contrast. On top of that, she generally acts cuter and childish, which enhances the moe-ness she produces. Her clones look her like aside from eyes and panties, but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. LO is an exception mainly for being a loli, and is even more childish in various ways that burst with endearment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to admit.<br><br>On some level, I am kind of wondering what kind of canon assassination Season 3 of Railgun will bring to the table.<br><br>I'm assuming a Railgun S3 would be like the first two, with the first half being a serviceable to stellar adaptation of a canon arc (I'm thinking Liberal Arts City), and the second cour will be Nagai's playground.<br><br>So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wake me up when they finally make an accel anime.  <br>Does Accel even appear in the Railgun manga other than the Sister's Arc?</br>    <br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>Time travel arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Added to my backlog.</br>  <br>He does get prodded by a Daihasei rep to advertise, but because said rep brought up the Sisters project, he ate a brick.</br>  <br>I think he's learned his lesson already</br>  <br>Index PSP did time meddling. Please no.</br>  <br> but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth <br>But she looks best when she's not in her base design.</br></br>  <br>Oh hello there, I was thinking that you'd never show up in an actual thread.</br>   There are people in AC who don't know Accel   <br>The first question, the oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.</br>  I loved Railgun but I am 10 episodes into Index and I am just not feeling it. Half of each episode is Touma yelling into a really bright light while holding his hand up and they never even developed a relationship between him and Index before shit started exploding. Touma has no motivation beyond "lol me so awesome save cute girl!" And all the pseudo-church babbling and HAHAMAGIC nonsense just feels cheap and stupid.<br><br>Or is Index a masterpeace and I am a tasteless faggot?</br></br>  <br>It's shit. Only reason to watch either show is for biri biri but she can only do so much by herself.<br><br> I prefer railgul </br></br></br>  <br>No, it is not. Railgun is much better.</br>  <br> but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. <br>And that makes their moments of childishness all that much more adorable.</br></br>  <br>Index II is a lot better, except for a few awful magic arcs.</br>  <br>Mikoto has worn many outfits. I would say her best is that tomboy outfit, the white dress she wore for the violin play, and the winter school uniform.</br>  <br>Where were you when they were all splattered dead on the floor?</br>  <br>Yeah you have to wait until NT4 to get the barest minimum of Touma development.<br><br>At all. And after  alternate universe genocide the subsequent effects are barely mentioned again.  </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br><br>MODS<br>O<br>D<br>S</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s0vqHSWkiRwS</br>    <br>Touma is still a very boring MC.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's depressing. At least he isn't unbearable, though.</br>  <br>Now I really want a literal taste of Misaka too</br>  Shirou &gt;Touma.  <br>Accelerator confirmed Misaka doesn't taste that good.</br>  <br>Thinking "FUCK YOU /A/ YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS CUTE GIRLS SOLVING CRIMES."<br><br>You can call me an idiot for watching a series without knowing anything about it but I was not expecting that at all.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br>How many times do I have to report this guy?</br>  <br>Why did he chew on her fingers? Nigga is disgusting. Someone should snitch to LO.</br>  <br><br><br> eating Mikasa raw <br>The reason the Accelerator hated it was because the food was improperly prepared.</br></br></br></br>  Her vagina is pretty popular.  <br><br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>First half of S2 was Misaka trying to save girls from cruel experiments from the dark side, leaving her friends behind and falling into depression to be saved by Touma. Then the second half was Nagai doing the same arc but with power of friendship saving the day<br><br><br>If the first half of S3 is Daihaseisai, where Mikoto and a level 5 team up to fight against a crazy scientist who's objective is experimenting with them, going crazy and finally being saved by Touma; then the second half will be Nagai having Mikoto team up with a super special snowflake level 4 girl who's almost a level 5 (pretty much every other level 5 doesn't give a shit, Gunha doesn't look like Nagai's style and Misaki again would be too much) to fight another crazy scientist who wants to experiment with them, Misaka going crazy but this time is saved by a friendship speech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what LO is actually for, making him sedated enough to not go out of the plan</br>  <br><br><br>Alright who is this fag?</br></br></br>  <br>That pose is way hot.</br>  <br> Implying accel even eats good meat </br>  <br>What's the matter? Her cooch too   shocking  for you or something?<br><br> Misaka's vagina </br></br></br>  <br><br>The problem is, you go to Index for the worldbuilding. Touma himself is literally a blank slate and after a while you realize the harem stuff is a mere footnote played for laughs.<br><br>Since the anime has to cut down on tons of exposition you end up missing a lot of stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, it turns harem? Fuck that.</br>  <br> look at me I think everything is lame fuck you mom </br>  Only good male character in Index.  <br>Indeed. And as a further bit of note...<br><br>Don't expect any concrete, lasting romantic development of any kind in this series. Some of /a/'s most virulent shitposters started out as people who made the mistake of latching on to a "ship" in Raildex.</br></br></br>  <br>You're kidding right? Hamazura is the original cuck.</br>  <br>Kakine 2 and Accel aren't too shabby.</br>  Index is the best.  <br> Beetle good </br>  <br> to be saved by Touma <br>I hated that crap. I knew the whole time how it would end and it spoiled a good story. Misaka is doing great as the MC only to become a useless crybaby wreck waiting for the big strong man to swoop in and solve all her problems for her. <br><br>I was almost hoping they would make Railgun a parallel universe asspull so they could change that arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Index has a pretty shit adaptation that only gets decent once index's novels start getting good (around the end parts of season 2)</br>  <br>You must be a special kind of retard. You cite volume 5 as your source where he explicitly gets sexually aroused by Mikoto as she's helping him with his homework.</br>  <br> Shit taste </br>  <br> Telling other people they have shit taste when you're clearly the one with really bad taste </br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br> Index has a pretty shit adaptation <br>Nice meme.</br></br>  <br>You missed the entire point of that arc. I bet you're also mad about Touma having to save her in Daihasei as well. You sound just like the idiots who get butt flustered every time she helps/saves Touma in the main novels.</br>   Remember me, /a/?   this is downright ancient shit right here  <br>There are plenty of faggots here that take shit too seriously. Have you heard of the dangers of irc and crossboarders, my friend?</br>  <br>That site gave me many a great fap.</br>  <br>I first came here in 2008. Even then, /v/ was full of overly-serious morons<br><br>The difference was the rageface being in vogue at the time, with it being an ironic meme making fun of the pointless rage Xbots had against Nogaems and towards "casuals", while since 2011 they've moved towards feels and now to even more idiotic rage, this time without the irony to take it's edge off<br><br>Also<br><br> that neverending spam of "moralfags vs immoralfags" threads </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Houkago no Pleiades was fucking great, pleb.</br></br>  Why is Erina so lewd?  <br>Do you think Tosh keeps the actual SnS porn in his closet?</br>  <br> Not fapping to both <br><br>Never doubt the choices of your dick anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> my birthday <br><br>it's gonna be such a nice fap my breath is getting heavy just thinking about it</br></br></br>  <br>Explains Hinako.</br>  This is a cock.  <br>I implore you to reconsider by showing you this, which is indeed the best anything</br>  <br>This is a dead cat.</br>  <br>This is so sad.</br>  This is forever loli.  <br>This is right.</br>  Sinbad will be a major villain in Magi. Hes already halfway fallen into depravity, and will become hakuryuu tier edgelord once he falls completely. Alibaba and Aladdin will defeat him together.  <br> Alibaba is half-fallen as well <br><br>what? No, he isn't<br>unless you are talking about those S1 anime bullshit fillers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He is. It's why he couldn't djinn equip before seeing those nomad people. He has two types of Rukh in him, his and Cassim's. Cassim's is obviously black Rukh.</br>  <br>That's some nice headcanon.<br>He just couldn't control rukh from two different sources. Cassim's rukh is also white</br></br>  <br> Sinbad djinn count: 7 <br> Aliblahblah djinn count: 1 <br><br>The author's already confirmed the series is more than half over. Ali's never gonna catch up to a point where he could plausibly take on Sin one on one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cassim's was turned into a black djinn and nobody knows how to turn black Rukh white. How could his Rukh be white?</br>  ***,104位/***,100位 (***,922 pt) [*,**8予約] WORKING!!! <br>***,230位/***,255位 (***,489 pt) [*,**0予約] WORKING!!! <br>***,276位/***,267位 (***,416 pt) [*,**0予約] To Love Ru Darkness 2<br>***,298位/***,316位 (***,593 pt) [*,**1予約] To Love Ru Darkness 2<br>***,393位/***,357位 (***,806 pt) [*,**1予約] Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 3<br>***,593位/***,614位 (***,*38 pt) [*,**0予約] Shimoneta<br>***,640位/***,670位 ○ (***,*76 pt) [*,**0予約] Hetalia The World Twinkle<br>***,843位/***,942位 (**3,400 pt) [*,*66予約] im@s CG 2<br>**1,202位/**1,408位 (***,123 pt) [*,**0予約] Overlord<br>**1,320位/**1,231位 (***,*87 pt) [*,**0予約] Aquarion Logos<br>**1,580位/**1,421位 (***,*20 pt) [*,**0予約] Wooser <br>**2,172位/**1,960位 (***,*24 pt) [*,**0予約] GANGSTA. <br>**2,366位/**3,305位 (***,*63 pt) [*,**0予約] Chaos Dragon<br>**3,669位/**3,499位 (***,*78 pt) [*,**0予約] GOD EATER <br>**4,726位/**4,418位 ○ (***,171 pt) [*,**0予約] Junjou Romantica 3<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127643813#p127643813">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally the only source of what the "breaking point" for KyoAni is some idiots making numbers up to back up their stupid arguments.
