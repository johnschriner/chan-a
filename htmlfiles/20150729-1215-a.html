[ Severe lack of Shallchair in this episode.<br>I am disappoint.<br>Her vampire brides were waifu mateiral though.</br></br>  I want to fuck a demon.  <br> Shallchair <br>Don't you mean Shalltear?</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, Shalltear will have the best moments and arc this season for the anime. Just wait and see, her time will come.<br><br>Also, Shalltear is mai waifu.</br></br></br>  Why are people so butthurt that the show's getting a positive reaction?  <br> the brides die </br>  <br><br>I enjoyed the new episode way too much, that small moment of silence after Ainz black hole's the angel made me grin.</br></br>  <br>Nobody's butthurt, people are just acting like people usually act on 4chan.<br><br>Every series has it's shitposters. If it didn't happen it's because the threads were dead and unimportant.</br></br></br>  <br>Op knows what op said</br>  <br>No. Really? Fuck. Are no characters sacred in this series?</br>  <br>I shall tear her hymen with great prejudice</br>  Worth reading the manga? Or should I just watch this season first?  <br>Read the LN.</br>  <br>No, I really do mean Shallchair. Read the novels and come join the Shallchair League. We fight to make her our Chair. Current winner: Ainz.</br>  <br>Read the LN</br>  4 more weeks  <br><br>Ok then where do I pick up?</br></br>  <br>Read LN, then read manga for funny faces.</br>  <br>Can't wait to see Heaven's Downfall and The goal of all life is death.</br>  <br>None of them have been introduced with a name, only  2 have been in a scene and they were exterminated by either Shalltear or the spook who made her auto-defense mode rely on her valkyrie mode .</br>  I want to live inside Solution!  <br>Vol 1 Chapter 1.</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>   6 days without a new episode <br><br>Life is suffering</br></br>  Did they ever mention what he altered his face to? Was it his real face?  <br>That's what I'm thinking too.</br>  <br>Probably since everyone comments how average and unpopular is and how Ainz himself says that his own self-evaluation dropped by few grades later on.</br>  <br><br>At least we will get a new LN chapter in 4 days.<br><br>The bad news is that  it is a climb chapter. </br></br></br></br>  <br>4 days to new chapter, s-so it's not all that bad right?<br><br> It's all that bad. </br></br></br>  <br> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>It was face of old japanese man with some wrinkles and scars buti'm not sure about the last one</br>  <br><br><br>I think it mentions him using an older mans face or something.</br></br></br>  <br>God that was graphic, i hope they dont censor any part of it</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Shallchair <br>kek<br>Any place have vol 5 translated?</br></br></br>  <br>   it is a climb chapter. </br>  <br>The same place as usual nigga.</br>  <br> Ainz took off his helmet after finishing, surprising the four of them with his looks.<br>"Black hair and eyes just like Nabel-san, you don't seem to be from around here. I heard people like Momon-san are common in the south, do you hail from there?"<br><br>"Yes, we came from a land faraway."<br>“He is older than expected, old enough to be called 'uncle’.” <br>- Vol 2 Chp 1</br></br></br></br></br></br>  CLIMB IS REALLY INTERESTING  So far we've seen that the guardians are capable of acting outside of Ainz's direct orders due to various reasons.<br><br> Demiurge willing to fight Shalltear after being told not to. Shalltear losing control due to Blood Frenzy and then attacking people she had no business attacking because she was afraid of failing Ainz, Sebas who doesn't fully prioritize Nazarick above saving people. And finally Cocytus who wants to spare the lives of worthy lizardmen. <br><br>Does PD have anything he can actually work with here if he's cunning and pokes at these characteristics? While the guardians would probably never purposefully betray Ainz, I think there might be some flames to fan if PD plays his cards right.</br></br></br></br>  WHEN IS HAMUSUKE?    <br>Me too. I loved reading that part.</br>  <br>Maybe 2 weeks</br>  Being a skeleton must feel really nice  <br><br><br>It's not like Nazarick's servants even hate humans though. They just think of them as lesser beings, because, for the most part, they are. They respect strength, and the only truly strong humans would be other Player Characters.<br><br>Disregarding that, anyone who Ainz said was to be treated with respect would be. Full stop. Even if they were a cripple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Narbel but older and male.</br>  repost from last thread<br><br>I wonder who would suit her more. Personally I kind of pictured Kana Asumi would do her the most justice.</br></br>  Is there any reason why the manga is sporadic in release dates for english translation?  <br>It's a monthly manga.</br>  <br>Even if the manga is released monthly it still depends on the translation release by the guys translating it.</br>  <br>pretty sure they're just mobs that spawn on her floor and she drags them with her because she's to lazy to walk on her own. That, and her personal sex toys.</br>  <br><br>This. Most of Nazarick evaluates the world like so:<br><br>Supreme Beings &gt; Direct Creations (Mostly Floor Guardians or people like Pandora's Actor) &gt; Lieutenants &gt; Named Mobs &gt; Automatically Produced Mobs &gt; Worthy Enemies &gt; Random People &gt; Enemies<br><br>There's a few exceptions, like Cocytus valuing the Lizardmen more than the mass produced mobs and Sebas in general, but for the most part, anything with a Nazarick label on it is more unimportant that anything without for any inhabitant of Nazarick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  At this point in the anime, is it even clear that Ainz is ACTING how he believes the leader of Nazarick should be acting?<br><br>I feel like telling those quibbling about the "cliched" exchange between Ainz and Nigun or Ainz "showing off" that they're completely missing the point.</br></br>   Touch Me had a brother who played a Human Mage <br> Said brother is   the only surviving member of the Eight Greed Kings and wants nothing to do with the world <br><br>Man, awkward.</br></br></br>  HITTEN MITSURUGI RYU<br><br>KUZU RYU SEN</br></br>  <br> double Tsubamegaeshi </br>  So I really love this so far don't get me wrong, but  how is this any different than Mahouka gary stu bullshit? It's basically the same thing but with good characters and no useless bullshit masturbatory writing <br>Is the MC ever getting any good conflict or opposition? Honestly I find the worship scenes kinda creepy, even thought that's how Kings are, it's been 3 times so far with such scenes in the anime.</br>  I've read all the manga so far, where would that place me for the LN? Like volume and chapter wise?  <br> Is the MC ever getting any good conflict or opposition? <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br> Ainz has a sense of smell and touch despite being a skeleton. <br><br>That's not fair, he should have to sacrifice important aspects of being alive like the rest of us.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty much the same to be honest.<br><br>We're just here for Albedo and Narberal. The novels aren't really that good either.</br></br></br>  <br>Less incest.<br><br>Fuck you nerd I'm hear to see the fights. Why are they so much clearer than everything else?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because a lot of the fights are from the villains perspective.</br>  <br>sykthewood's blog, the mega or the googledrive.</br>  Can someone tell me if the color palette on the picture is actually correct?<br><br>This looks way too red for my tastes.</br></br>  <br> with good characters  <br> no useless bullshit masturbatory writing <br>That's literally enough to make a world of difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's another picture for comparison.</br>  <br>Well yeah that's why I really love it anyway.<br><br><br>Great, thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What's that red orb Ainz has below his ribcage?<br><br>It's not his fucking phylactery is it? What kind of Lich carries his phylactery on him, rather than buried in an admantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you talking about that one  lich? </br>  Why did spoopy skeleton let soldiers die if he was going to kick theocracy ass anyway  <br>Because he doesn't really care.</br>  <br>He's not dead<br>...right?</br></br>  <br> He wasn't going to do shit till they said they were going to kill the villagers. Pay attention.</br>  <br>I meant the random nameless soldiers</br>  <br>What it is hasn't been mentioned as of vol 5. It seems unlikely liches even had phylacteries in Yggdrasil.</br>  <br><br>Why do you have the need to see anime with bullshit shounen fights?<br>Try thinking past the individual fights. it's not about IF he wins or loses, it's about HOW</br></br></br>  <br> What kind of Lich carries his phylactery on him, rather than buried in an admantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible? <br><br>The ones that don't want to revive trapped into a adamantium chamber buried ten miles beneath the surface of the earth, surrounded by magma.and guarded by the most powerful (and utterly mindless) guardians possible?<br><br><br>Didn't you heard? Humans are like insects for him. Just those to which he talked are being upgraded to "small animal" status.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a World Class item.</br>  <br>In the LN he had more intrest keeping the villagers safe so he went and made sure they were safe before doing anything else.</br>  <br> forgetting overlord has one of the most bullshit shonen fights ever. </br>  <br>Oh. Literally who cares?<br><br><br>Of course, and? The way he defeated anything so far was excessively simple.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These:<br><br><br>In that order.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a fucking Lich. By definition, he's a powerful spellcaster. If he can't even cast teleport, he shouldn't be a fucking Lich.</br></br>  Could someone make a .webm of Albedo freaking out because Ainz got damaged/  <br><br>Nigger, please, this is an anime about an all powerful skeleton and his Eldritch abomination pals putting humans in their place.<br><br>How can you not think that this is pretty motherfucking cool is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> What's that red orb Ainz has below his ribcage? <br>same this that  skullgreymon  got</br></br>  <br><br>I got a boner while reading it.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon for telling me which answers were real.</br>  <br>If you place your phylactery in a location where everyone who can teleport can go you could just as well take it with you, at least it would be under your eyes and there wouldn't be an adamantium chamber to protect any teleporting invader from the lava and the guardians.</br>  <br>Is that a later vol spoiler? I can't recall him mentioning anything about that orb at all.</br>  So which do you prefer /a/?<br><br>Playing as a powerful evil overlord from the get-go, or playing as a an inexperienced adventurer with no insta-win abilities but becoming a legendary figure through hard work, wit and effort?</br></br>  <br>Well, considering the Death Knight scene showed decapitation and some other cool junk, we might get a watered-down hug scene at the very least.</br>  <br>See this is what I don't get. Did Ains suddenly lose all empathy and whatnot, and if so, is this something that will be addressed later?</br>  <br>Do I have to be evil?</br>  <br>I never said it wasn't fucking COOL as fuck nigger.<br>It just need more opposition to make things more interesting on top of the COOL<br>And it apparently will, so it's great news</br></br></br>  <br>I want to start as a no-body weakass warrior who becomes a powerful allmighty lich later.</br>  <br><br>Why would you tell anyone about the location? Why wouldn't you place an artifact in there that prevents inward teleportation but allows outward? Think, anon.</br></br>   Lv1 D&amp;D spells <br>I fucking love this show.<br><br>What race was Touch Me, btw?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that some Quest for Glory?<br><br>Because holy shit that might be the best game series ever made.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did Ains suddenly lose all empathy <br>Why do people keep asking this? He literally says that is what happened to him. Are you people even reading or are you just looking at the pretty pictures?</br></br>  <br><br>Dragonkin with a human base form.<br><br>Basically the same as Sebas.<br><br><br><br>Fucking hell, is that Quest for Glory? I haven't played that in years,<br><br>Wizard Best Class.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragonkin.</br>  <br>Hasn't been revealed yet as of vol 5</br>  <br>It was mentioned in the web novel versions of the events in Vol 7.<br> In the WN the priest thinks the red orb is Ainz's weak point and tries punching it, does nothing, then Ainz goes on a long explanation about what the orb is and how it's not an actual weak point, etc, etc. </br></br>  <br>Dragonkin, as far as I know.</br>  <br> Why would you tell anyone about the location? <br>Scrying nigger<br> Why wouldn't you place an artifact in there that prevents inward teleportation but allows outward? <br>Then how would you get there in the first place?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Everyone creates a cool NPC. <br> Touch Me makes himself as an NPC <br><br>Why?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Because fuck you, he's Touch Me.</br>  <br>The man was a extreme paladin.</br>  <br>Because nobody could think of anything cooler.</br>  <br>In the novel is more evidenced, but even in the anime he already said that being in a Lich bodies is influencing him, and that he found disconcerting the fact that could see the massacre without feeling anything. <br><br><br>Yeah, just know that while this anime season is gonna end in one helluva fight   against the red knight in the opening   who is a mind controlled Shalltear    the true enemies aren't gonna appear still, and they work much more behing the scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dayum, Albedo going crazy is tasty.</br>  <br><br>Where's all this dragonkin stuff coming from? I don't think anything pertaining to Touch Me's race has ever been revealed.</br></br>  So does ainz ever meet the surviving member of the eight kings of greed?  <br>I haven't read the source material, is this an actual plot point which will be addressed later?</br>  <br> Wanting people to oppose Ains-sama <br> ''COOL'' </br></br>  You spawn on the New World as the last MMORPG character youve played as.  <br><br> not putting in an anti-scry spell <br><br>That's basic shit.<br><br> spend a few years reading a book while Thralls build a chamber around you <br> then TP out <br><br>Honestly, the magma is just for the atmosphere. Any character past lvl 20 can fucking swim through that shit with the right gear. It's just to keep out the plebs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Motherfucker he says it in the anime pay attention.</br>  <br> Elin buttslut priest <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br> level 60 White Mage <br>Oh boy, time for EXPERIMENTS</br></br>  <br>What does he say it is? I'd like to know the long explanation.</br>  <br>What do you do if someone finds out about it and gets there ahead of you? What do you do if someone just wishes to know where it is?</br>  <br> I would be a human warlock who looks as if he was in his 70s. Cool.</br>  <br> orc enhancement shaman with the herod axe <br><br>I will spin till the world ends</br></br></br>  <br><br>Male Human Warlock.<br><br>Summon my succubus, have sex, move on to setting up a mountainside retreat where I can advise future heroes on how to do shit and shape the course of history over centuries without actually doing anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather be one of the Guardians.</br>  <br> Duke Nukem knockoff <br><br>Okay. Time to chew ass.</br></br></br>  <br> Capped RO Ranger  <br>Life is good.</br></br>  Reading ahead of the releases.<br> Evileye, stop being cute. This will only end poorly for you. I don't care if you're okay with the idea of him having one or two concubines. Stop. </br>  aots by far  <br>An unreliable narrator making an off-hand statement does not seem like the end all be all of a MAJOR character development.</br>  <br> Never played a MMO <br>Welp.</br></br>  <br> my level 40ish fem TERA goat demon <br>The hell did I do to deserve this?</br></br>  <br> Summon my succubus, have sex <br> You are dead.</br></br>  <br>level 90 mithra from ffxi. At least I could do everything and have yagrush I guess. Being a catgirl could be interesting.</br>  <br>The only MMO I ever played was Tera for like 10h in the course of a week, a friend asked me to help since he needed an extra healer<br>so I guess Im a lvl 20 elin healer</br></br>  <br> Something about how it's an item that costs levels to use (doesn't actually specify what it does), and that it was used to deliver the finishing blow to the all the people that invaded Nazarick's 8th floor. </br>  <br>Finally a girl who isn't Ainz "child", maybe she'll win the Ainzbowl.</br>  <br>He literally says he didn't feel bad about watching people die and killing people or feel much strong emotion in general. He just doesn't care that much about it because being a lich affects his mind.</br>  <br>It is so very satisfying because for once the cunt gets what she deserves.</br>  <br>Christ dude</br>  <br><br>Not in WoW. Warlock Succubi are literally all Albedo.</br></br>  <br>And thats leaving out the bit about not getting a boner.</br>  <br> female mage that teleports all the time and kills enemies by snaping <br>YES</br></br>  <br><br>Well shit, I'll swim in pussy in no time</br></br>  <br>Considering players could customize almost every aspect of their characters, I'd say it's there cause Ainz thinks it looks cool.</br>  <br><br>They'll probably just be puking blood to a cut away with squishing sfx. Doesn't mean I'm not very looking forward to seeing how it plays out though. It definitely wont be as detailed as the novel though.</br></br>  <br>My old RuneScape character. Great, just when I thought I forgot about that time sink of a game.</br>  <br> lv 3  <br>You'll be dead in no time.</br></br>  <br>souce, looks cool.</br>  <br>He has no libido, so he's never getting laid.</br>  <br>I want to serve underneath a powerful lich.</br>  <br>Its a hover device. Becoming a semidemilich caused his legs to crumble into dust,</br>  <br>What I am asking is if this will be a running plot point in the series. <br><br>It seems to have been completely forgotten in EP4.</br></br></br>  <br>Beginning Reality mmo.</br>  <br>Is it final fantasy?</br>  <br>Does destiny count?</br>  <br>How is it forgotten? It's not addressed because there hasn't been a change. He states at the start of the episode he likens the h7umans to small animals at least. Which is an improvement from seeing them as insects. <br><br>Yes, FF14</br></br></br>  <br>Pathfinder 20th level Skald. Time to get people to LISTEN TO MY SONGS.</br>  <br>This was a pretty good chapter. Is Ains like this in the LNs?<br><br>I usually avoid them because they're terribly written, is Overlord LN better than most?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss where he called humans insects and later upgraded a few to small animals? Why would he talk about it? He doesn't care much.</br>  <br><br><br>Yes, FFXIV. There's a 15 day free trial on Steam.<br><br>I played it for about 3 days and decided not to buy due how dull it was, subs and paying for the expansion (You have to buy the game, the expansion and pay for subs).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> last mmorpg <br> eve online <br>well this should be easy</br></br></br>  <br>My Lyn Blade Master<br>Time to spin</br></br>  <br>Lvl 75 Caseal Ranger. Do robots have sex drives?</br>  <br>Unlimited spawning toys. The great thing about being an unnamed NPC.</br>  <br>Do you spawn with your ship though?</br>  <br><br>I guess I am just wishing there was more introspection.</br></br>  <br> Mid level undead warrior with whirlwind axe <br><br>I hope I can still climb the ladder</br></br></br>  <br>I'd immediately proceed to fuck a lot of girls.<br>Even as a girl.</br></br>  <br> It seems to have been completely forgotten in EP4. <br><br>Sure Buddy</br></br></br>  Now that I think about it shaltear is the only one (non lizard) it ever mentions having sex isn't she? At least someone gets action.  <br>More like ROKU RYU SEN</br>  <br><br>you see hes been saying this in presence of his subordinates so its hard to tell if its just him playing the part or not</br></br>  <br> level 70 Tauren Hunter with stats in all the wrong places and shit gear <br>goddamn it</br></br>  <br>Four reasons, <br>1. He doesn't give a shit about the soldiers <br>2. Didn't really feel the need to get involved in the fighting between other nations<br>3. Was more interested in protecting the villagers, his new source of information<br>4. He didn't want to jump in a fight unless he knew he could win. <br>After seeing Gazef fight them though, he realized #4 wasn't even an issue though, then he heard they were planning to kill the villagers which interfered with #3. At that point though, the soldiers were already dead, so #1 was pointless. So he decided #3 was more important than #2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the last MMO I played was Tibia more than 5 years ago <br> level 150 Royal Paladin, with my Backpack filled with Assassin Stars and Infernal Bolts <br><br>Hahaha, headshots everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  On a recent /v/ thread, someone asked which game you can play as a lich. Nobody there mentioned "Might and Magic 8", but that is the only RPG I've ever known that lets you:<br><br>1/ Start as a mage<br>2/ Join a necromancer guild<br>3/ Complete a long line of quest in order to turn yourself into a lich<br><br>You can also play as a fire-breathing, non-armor-wearing dragon, but that's just icing on the cake.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I dont think there's a cooler MC this season than mr skeltal  <br>There is here and there but in general why bother think about something you dont care about?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Touch Me's actual race is unknown as of yet. Everyone just assumes he's the same as Sebas since Touch Me made Sebas and both Touch Me and Sebas are "Good Justice Alignment". For all we know, Touch Me could be a doppelganger or a vampire or a slime under that suit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The armour is Touch Me </br>  This anime really makes me want to plunge myself back into MMOs but I know they're all shit.  <br>The left out the part where he apologizes to Albedo for wasting her special protection for a lowly Angel. But they kept the projectile part in at least. I hope people saw the after credit scene. Too bad we will never see Vol 7 animated.</br>  <br>in the end they're mindless grindfests, fun during the leveling part.<br>if only that could last forever..</br></br>  <br>They'll never not be shit, even the one in the anime is dead and clearly P2W</br>  <br>skythewood blog</br>  <br> You'll never play your first MMO again and have mindless fun not knowing what you were doing. </br>  <br> He has no libido, so the girls are never getting laid <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>Damaged....yeah like 1 or 2 HP. Seriously it was like when Kirito was regenerating faster than he was taking damage but way more awesome since Ainz was doing EVIL SKELLY LAUGH. I just wish the BGM was more epic, it would be doubly better.</br>  <br>feels bad man</br>  <br> Elin BAMhunter/Crowd control archer build <br><br>I'm okay with this</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I guess it's fine.</br></br>  <br> undead rogue in this set <br>i mis tbc</br></br>  <br>Looking past the nostalgia vision, common first MMOs such as Runescape and Vanilla WoW were seriously awful and only excusable because they came out 10+ years ago.</br>  <br>Shalltear does, just not with the bone.</br>  <br> with what? </br>  <br> mis <br>tfw making typos<br>im tired ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Just waiting for virtual reality to become a thing. Even though I know it is going to be bad at least it will be a new experience.<br><br>True but those years held some of the fondest memories.</br></br></br>  Was it this guy ainz turns into a lich? I don't remember who it was.  <br>He kinda hinted at it very early in the beginning. When Ainz first mentioned about world class items that the guild got, he mentioned that since he was the guild leader, people in the guild agree that he should have one world class item in his possession, the first thing I thought of was the giant red ball in his Rib cage.</br>  <br>Fuck. I haven't played an MMO since WoW BC, I think it was a female Blood Elf mage. No idea what level she was, but far from the cap, so I'd be fucked.</br>  <br>I'd be a mnk/drg. Not what I would prefer but pretty good.</br>  <br> Tera Elin berserker  <br>God. Fucking.  Bless Tera </br></br>  What the fuck was up with Nigun's eyes?<br> Did he smoke magic crack or something?</br>  <br>Because it's not their usual moe shit nor as edgy as it could be, nor their usual pretentious pandering insertbuzzwordshere Monogatari-esque show, but something else, not too cliched but digestible enough while being creative.<br><br>Therefore it's good, therefore, to "them" it's shit. You know, "them" being a group of "that guy"s.</br></br></br>  <br> The entire time he was nothing but a floating head, arms, and legs. <br> Traveling the world in search of a worthy piece to complete his body while smiting evil. <br> He finally compeletes his body after becoming a World Champion. <br><br>Looks like he had a touch of spookyness in him after all.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to rub mare's ears  This show is so much fun.  <br>Solution derives pleasure from having people inside her as she slowly dissolves them. I guess that's as good as it gets for a slime woman.<br><br>Just look at how happy she is from sticking her own fingers in her chest.</br></br></br>  <br>I disagree, Newer MMO's have become casualized to the point of becoming trivial. The main reason I think this is because of the Raid finders and everything.<br><br>No longer will you spend hours spamming chat looking for groups for dead mines only to wipe at the first boss because your party is shit, nor do you no longer get the sense of achievement for actually beating it.<br><br>I think what I'm trying to say is that the souls of MMO's are gone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His talent was being born with MeoDP.

Here, have some more.</br>  <br>its fucking true you basement dwelling fatass</br>  <br><br>Here's a common pepe</br></br>  This manga is so goofy and over the top.  So why can't I stop reading it?   <br>There's no need to stop. Just keep goin, man. Keep Medaka Box fresh in your mind. <br><br> Don't click the spoiler </br></br></br>  <br>Why must you tempt me like that ;_;<br>I'm so scared to click it cause I'm only on like chapter 134</br></br>  <br>Don't click it. It's a spoiler. It's alright to click this spoiler however since it's not a spoiler. <br><br>I'd recommend you leave. You are actually going to get spoiled just by making this thread. It's a testament to just how contradictory some people are, the kind of people who would spread eight hundred lies and spread labels for provocation purposes. Some people just have no style.</br></br></br>  Look forward to when Medaka destroys the moon and disappear, only to finally come back on graduation day.  <br><br>It really turns to shit towards the end. Medaka is a terrible character, even though they intentionally made her over the top.</br></br>  Medaka is best waifu, but worst waifu  I miss my weekly Medaka Box threads.<br><br>I was very sad to see a manga as entertaining as this to end.<br><br>Sleeping 22 hours a day Election Chairwoman Kiruko Tachiarai still had the undisputed best ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I should drink more if I'm to pair the wrong images with posts.</br>  Minus &gt; Unknown Shiranui &gt; Medaka Trial &gt; Normal &gt; Abnormal &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Jet Black Wedding<br>Any other opinion is wrong</br>  <br> Not Medaka Trial &gt; Minus &gt; Unkown Shiranui &gt; Abnormal &gt; Jet Black Wedding &gt; Normal <br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br> Not Unknown Shiranui &gt; Minus &gt; Abnormal &gt; Medaka Trial &gt; Normal &gt; Jet Black Wedding. </br>  Election&gt;Minus&gt;Fresh&gt;Jet Black Wedding&gt;Trial&gt;Abnormal&gt;Normal  I wanted to make her a mother so badly.  <br><br><br>shouldn't minus go at the end since it's the most negative</br></br></br>  I always hear this is suppose to be a good read but my backlog wont let me read it<br><br>can someone at least spoil &gt;128718280 for me<br>I see this guy so often but i have no idea what it's suppose to mean</br></br></br>  <br>It fails at failing. Like a true minus.</br>  Ajimu a best and I still cry because she never came back <br>I don't remember much about this manga, picked it up in the first place only because I heard it was amusing but ended up hating everything about it and skipping most of everything from the beginning <br>Dropped after the minus arc<br>Kumagawa and Ajimu were great everyone and everything else was really terrible</br></br></br>  I might actually want to start reading this. I watched the animu, but does it follow the manga? If so, what chapter should I start off on? If not, what would I be missing?<br><br>  Give me spoilers if you want, i'd probably just make me want to read it more.  </br></br>  <br>ho my dick</br>  <br>chapter 56 where best arc (minus) is beginning</br>  I liked it before it turned into every single thing it claimed to be a satire of.<br><br>Girls are still hot though. I might pick it up again if there's another pool segment or a beach chapter.</br></br>  <br>Ch. 55 or 56</br>  <br/>    the only reason i have read entire manga is kumagawa  <br>who is this nigga and why is everything he says in quotations?</br>  <br>It's cool</br>  <br><br>Thanks a lot, m80s.</br></br>  <br>Same tbh</br>  <br>Kumagawa and IIRC the brackets meant he was speaking monotone.</br>  <br>It's a Japanese pun. The Japanese word for "in brackets" sounds like "being cool" iirc</br>  Who is best girl?  <br>All of them</br>  it's a manga with fresh and memorable antagonists, a bad MC with a good sidekick and a shitty group of supporting character.<br>the art was the best part. pretty good for a weekly, nishio sometimes showed he was sick of continuing it.</br>  <br><br><br>well i never watch the show but saw him in my j stars game, he seems like the only interesting aspect about it</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually the least interesting aspect about him</br>  <br>i meant he was most interesting aspect about the show not the brackets.. it was his attitude that caught my eye. not sure if i should watch a show for just one character.</br>  <br>imho all the characters are interesting, but this is definitely a case where you may read it only for him and be satisfied anyway</br>  <br>I skipped to ep 11 where he first appears. Don't know what's going on. But I understand that Medaka is the student council pres whos all powerful and fights for friends typical shonen protagonist type shit. Don't know why she's fighting that little guy though.</br>  every chapter i waited<br>i waited for the day zenkichi would beat medaka<br>but that day never came<br>that stupid fucking diplomatic victory didn't sate my desire to see medaka defeated. <br>they hyped that shit up so much, and i fucking ate it up. i thought "shit maybe the world's biggest mary sue's weakness is the world's biggest underdog".<br>i know the point of zenikichi was to be the designated jobber, but come the fuck on. just once, let him fuck something dangerous up.</br></br></br></br></br>  I wanted Zenkichi to end up with Shiranui because it stayed true to their friendship over the seasons as well as his Loli family nature. His mom was a Loli, he should have gotten with her to keep the Loli going and make her a mother.  <br>Reading the previous chapter probably would be useful</br>   Beginning <br>Meh. Standard wacky highschool manga.<br> Flask arc <br>And now it goes full shounenshit.<br> Minus arc <br>Wait, this is great. Damn fucking great.<br> Elections arc <br>Still amazing despite the nisioisms.<br> Jet Black Wedding arc <br>Japanese puns and Mary Sue extravaganza. Garbage.<br> Fresh arc <br>NO.<br> Graduation arc <br>At least it's over.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  he's good at screwing  <br> &gt;Elections arc <br> Still amazing despite the nisioisms. <br>Not "Meta gloriousness in its greatest form"<br><br> &gt;Fresh arc <br> NO. <br>Nice shit taste you have here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> meta for meta <br>Worthless.</br></br>  <br>Fresh Arc made me drop it until Graduation Arc and ending. <br><br>Minus was the best damn Arc ever, I looked forward to seeing it, wish a little more happened but it was good as is.</br></br></br>  <br> dat symbolism </br>    <br>He's  you. </br>  WHY DID THEY KEEP IMPLYING THE WRESTLING SENIOR WAS A MINUS<br>WHY DIDN'T THEY FLESH IT OUT<br>AAAAAAAA</br></br>  <br>Akune?<br>He just had a bad streak. That's not the same as being a Minus. I think he got fleshed out enough during Medaka Trial.</br></br>  I picked it up for Kumagawa, turned out to be semi-decent, with some fun arcs, until it went to shit in the final ones.  The only thing i wanted was more from her.  <br>No, the girl with the green hair.<br>She was immune to book maker.</br></br>  <br>Wait yeah I always wondered about her, so she what a Minus, abnormal or not equal? she was all of them?</br>  <br>Kumagawa went easy on her because she didn't have any ability.</br>  <br>Minuses aren't immune to Bookmaker or anything like that, so that's a moot point.</br>  <br>Abnormal.<br>by the way her Blood Type was AB plus .</br></br>  <br>She's a special<br><br><br>Source?<br><br><br>But a minus obviously can't get turned into a minus</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't have Bookmarker at that time, the screws were just weapons.</br>  <br>Kuma used Bookmaker on Shiranui, so it does work on minus people. It just makes them even more of a fucking minus which is dangerous. Considering how the powers work, minuses are honestly the strongest bunch, but also the highest in rates of killing themselves because their lives are so fucking horrible.<br><br><br>Oh, thanks for clearing that up m8.<br><br>Also, why are there so many fucking abnormals?! They dominate the fucking school.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Weapons that caused severe mental damage to every other person it hit<br>Except for her</br></br>  <br>There's degrees of abnormality.<br>That's the entire point of Medaka and Kumagawa.</br></br>  <br> which is dangerous <br>That's not how it works. Kumagawa is strong because he's weak. No one other than him benefits from it.</br></br>  <br>She faked getting beaten, so she didn't get wrecked in the same way as they did.<br><br>Frankly, it seems like you're grasping at straws about her being a minus.</br></br></br>  <br> strong because he's weak <br>Why is there noone who is weak because he´s strong?</br></br>  <br>Ajimu jobs in every fight despite being the strongest motherfucker in fiction.</br>  <br>I think that Mr.Unknown was that person in this manga. Considering he'd fuck you up, but as he's fighting you, you're forgetting who he is. This he's so weak you can't remember him? He was an Abnormal though so it most likely didn't work that way.<br><br>Also friendly reminder that Kumagawa had a son with Mogana but didn't stick around because again Minuses lives suck no matter who is in them.</br></br></br>  <br>It just annoys me how she's so powerful and involved in the story yet ignored<br>Even if they didn't plan to have her be a minus, it's obvious they originally planned to use her more</br></br>  <br>Wasn't he so strong that people unconsciously got so terrified of him that they forgot him?</br>  <br>I don't understand how there's people that didn't get it. You just need to look at Kikaijima's face when they talk about him.</br>  Nisio's worst work  <br>But she literally has a constant blush.</br>  <br> she's so powerful <br>She was just a regular Special. She wasn't even remotely that powerful. I think you've read a lot into her that wasn't there anon.</br></br>  <br>That was most likely it kek, gotta re-read it over. Thanks man.<br><br><br>Exactly, it was pretty self-explanatory. Sucks for her though, but their son will most likely be a minus who always wins and wants to lose. Considering his name means win or winner. <br><br>They could have used the Public Moral's Committee a lot more in the later arcs too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still good</br>  WHAT WAS THE DEAL WITH IIHIKO?  <br>But we never saw her lose to anyone other than medaka at the end.<br>She pretty much effortlessly wins every other fight she's in.</br></br>  <br>no objections</br>  <br>Man, what is the point of actually translating that fuckload of text in the background? It's not like anyone is going to read even a tiny fraction of it, seems like a lot of wasted effort on the scanlators end.</br>  <br>Holy shit this makes me remember the poor scanlators and how much shit we gave them before those chapters.<br><br> What was their name? </br></br></br>  <br> She pretty much effortlessly wins every other fight she's in. <br>Because she isn't in any fights after Abnormal arc. And she got floored by Kumagawa. There's zero evidence of what you're implying.</br></br>  <br> He didn't read it all <br>There's a lot of funny or cool skills in there-</br></br>  whoa a Medaka thread??<br>Kumagawa best husbando<br><br>I read all that skills<br><br>cxc scans</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't she use Undead genius or Death Meeting against Iihiko?</br>  <br>Holy shit they are still alive<br><br> CXC Scans powered by brackets. <br><br>That is  Cool </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She just pretended to be retarded against Kuma, she was relatively unharmed at the end of it.<br>It doesn't really matter though<br>In the end she's just another ignored background character.</br></br></br>  <br>"Turn enemy into a stronger enemy skill." LOL<br><br>FUCK IT!, WHY NOT HUE HUE</br></br></br>  <br>It's fine to have a head-canon and all, but don't try to push it as the real deal.</br>  <br><br>Stop acting like a retard. It is not funny.</br></br>  <br>Lighten up anon, the skill was funny to me at least.<br><br>I also liked "Wall Creation Skill".</br></br></br>  <br>She has a Become God skill that doesn't work. Metatextual genre-based bullshit transcends skills.</br>  <br>Tfw I read all of those pages<br>My favorite was "Pull skills out of dishwasher skill"</br></br>  <br>Yes it was funny, but there's no reason to go<br> LOL <br> FUCK IT! WHY NOT HUE HUE <br><br>There's something called making quality posts, which are supposed to be encouraged.<br><br>You don't want this to become another stupid forum with kids spouting le epic maymays, or do you?<br><br>Anyways enough rant</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As much as I hate to admit it, you have a point anon. I was the retard, it's my loss.</br>  <br> Grant a disgusting interest skill <br> Change Gender <br>The doujins write themselves<br><br> Too bad no one is drawing them </br></br></br></br></br>  why he is so [not]perfect?<br>this manga is funny, my personal best skill is "Scar Dead" is so overpowered, did you guys imagine how much pain will suffer guys like Goku, Naruto, Ichigo, Luffy, etc??<br>Ouch man!</br></br>  Zenkichi &gt;Kumagawa  <br>yeah theres still on action<br>theyre doing To-love ru Darkness and Murcielago, and other cool mangas</br></br>  <br>This, so much. The rest of the cast was for the most part likeable, but Kumagawa stole the spotlight so much and it was so damn enjoyable when he did it.</br>  <br>fait me fgt</br>  <br> Holy shit they are still alive <br> not reading the most super interesting manga </br></br>  <br>Is this ironic shitposting? I can't tell.</br>  <br>My nigga. Heat is top-tier. Kumagawa is the peasantry choice.</br>  Why does heat say he's the weakest member of the student council when akune can beat the German loli when he goes all out, and zenkichi is mentioned being "on a totally different level" than akune  <br> turn damage into debt skill <br> [credit damage] </br></br>  <br>But that's wrong, it started off as everything it eventually became a satire of. Neither the normal nor flask plan arcs were nearly as goofy and meta as everything after.</br>  <br>Nah, it's meta for fun.</br>  <br>That's like saying checkers is a boring game compared to chess just because the pieces are nothing but abstract objects.<br><br> Checkers is a boring game compared to chess, but not for that reason. In fact chess would be just as fun if its pieces were just abstract objects, only harder for certain people to get into. </br></br></br>  <br>I know what you mean, anon. I wanted a beat down too. But the diplomatic victory was also a severe blow to Medaka's ego which left her completely mind broken. The cherry on top was Zenkichi saving her and having her lust after him. <br><br>There's also the final boss who fucked up Medaka, and was defeated by Zenkichi only after everyone else failed. Seeing him get the final victory against the strongest opponent even when Medaka couldn't do it, felt good to see.</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br>It is my favourite Nisio work.</br></br>  <br> mfw my autism made me read all this shit <br> [Noface] internetskill that allow you to post without reaction picture </br></br>  <br>I'm sorry about your shit taste, anon.</br>  <br>Because he's /a/ except somehow manage to be worst</br>  <br>I am sorry about your shit taste.</br>  <br>you're wrong though, I don't have shit taste</br>  <br>in a way he really did beat the main characters since he was the most popular</br>  Post underappreciated girl like Nowachin.

Next season they'll follow the Dandelion strategy and delay all of their releases until the next week so that fansubbers will always beat them.</br></br>  <br><br>That would eliminate a lot of the reason people sub to them though. Pretty stupid.</br></br>  I'm just glad that Shirobako is a genre now.    <br>Only idiots subscribe to funimation. Idiots will still subscribe even if a better translation with better video quality is available faster and through a method better suited for watching because it's "official" or "easier" or "supporting the studio." The only thing it would cut down on is people downloading HS releases, and even that wouldn't decrease by nearly as much as it should.<br><br>Just look at Dandelion. HS has 5x more downloads than MPT on Nyaa alone despite releasing 4 days later with translations full of typos and skipped lines and standard funi video quality and lack of typesetting.</br></br></br>  What are the best-looking manga out there?

He's just asking for people's opinions on something and providing his own. No need to be an asshole about it in this case. <br><br>Besides, it's more acceptable to a casualfag when it comes to manga on /a/, since 90%+ of the discussion that takes place here is about anime.</br></br></br>   The previous villain comes back to help MC take down the new villain of the series   <br>Yes.

I think the problem was that there was so much more the anime could have done but decided to focus on the romance only. However, it was still an ok show that didn't fail to deliver what it promised.</br>  Personally, it was AOTS for me.  Not enough scifi.      <br>It felt very gimmicky and was obviously a series where they tried to insert elements that are popular and would sell well. Like following a formula. Obviously it didn't work too well for them even when Aniplex wasted money on an ad in Asahi Shimbun.</br>  <br> focus on romance with no problems in the end <br> have 2-4 episodes going full on psycho pass </br></br>  Episode 4 and 5 needed some work, but I loved the anime overall and I'm sad it ended. One of my favorite shows last season.  <br><br>not enough scifi action<br><br>revealing too early the actual expiration dates of Giftias<br><br>revealing Isla's expiration date too early in the series; should have been revealed around episode 8-9.<br><br>not enough background on the technology<br><br>ending could be seen miles away from the start<br><br>pic related; even something like this is better executed and I even bawled harder  as a straight no-homo cis male than this plastic series</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Psycho-Pass</br>  <br>Good. Every character a shit and deserved to suffer.</br>  <br>everything aside from Isla's design.</br>  <br> revealing Isla's expiration date too early in the series; should have been revealed around episode 8-9. <br>We knew about it from the very start, anyway. They should have made the characters actually respond more, instead of spending whole episodes doing nothing and worrying about how to respond to a confession.</br></br>  <br>I actually expected this to be shit, and was in for a pleasant surprise.<br>It should have been 24 episodes, lovey-doveyness should have been a single episode instead of 3.<br>More background on how giftias work needed, maybe a bit more of Isla's and the other crew members' past.<br><br>Generally- not bad, ending was executed well, hats off for not doing a major asspull and letting stuff run their course.</br></br></br></br></br>  There was no ass pull happy ending so it left the audience sad and hollow at the end, that never makes for good sales.  It didn't do anything wrong it just wasn't that good  <br>It was too average.</br>  <br> It was too average. <br><br>The absolute bane of any entertainment peice<br><br>being boringly average</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Introverted =/= no personality. I thought the show actually approached her character reasonably well. (Though I'd agree that her character felt under developed, considering she's the central pillar of a 1-cour anime.)<br><br>She was cold, distant, somewhat unapproachable at first, and extremely awkward. However once she warmed up to Tsukasa we learn she's really engrossed in an interesting hobby (botany), she learns that work isn't everything, and she enjoys his soft-spoken accompaniment.<br><br>I actually found her character really relatable, it's all stuff I've dealt with. While her character may not have translated well to the screen: I do think it was fairly realistic. (Especially given her circumstances; it makes sense that she would try to avoid further attachment.)</br></br></br></br></br>  Forced drama<br>Forced moe<br>Forced comedy<br>Forced romance <br>Forced animation<br>Forced autism bot</br></br></br></br></br>  It was very eh. Not very good, but not really bad either.<br><br>Forgettable.</br></br>  Which SCP would you fug.  682 and 173  Adding 166 as well.<br><br>But anyone would fug her.</br></br>  This would be the fucking cool but then I remember all the fucking scary SCP there are.  Can you fuck a box of pizza?<br>Because 458 is best SCP.</br>  <br>173 is damn scary.<br><br>And disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone whose favorite pizza place closed down several years ago, I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>Fuck, why cant that be real?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-458<br><br>Also, SCP anime would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never carry out Procedure 110-Montauk   I would Candy. 1548 will me along with the rest of the human race.  105 of course  I wrote the original, and yes I wish it were not so shit.   <br>You know, SCP-166 could be used as a way to determine if the universe considers trannies to still be male depending on whether or not they react to her.</br>  Why dont they just give 682 a picture of 096's face and let them kill each other?  <br>Because it would probably end up just like when they tried to use 173 to kill him.</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>It's been a while since I read the log, but I believe 173 got driven into a corner, and 682 grew a few dozen extra eyes, then made them bulletproof when the researchers tried to shoot them out.</br>  <br>http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--<wbr>files/scp-682/682.mp3<br><br>Because 682 just won't fucking die. They tried crystallizing the damn thing and it didn't work.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>But could 096 actually have died to either 173 and 682?<br><br>Because I think that 096 is actually one of the worst SCPs, especially because of all the photos that were spread around it in the world without people realizing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>would be a great idea.</br>  <br>If they really wanted to terminate 096, then I'm sure they would have done it by now.</br>  <br>076 vs 682 or 096<br>what happens?</br></br>  <br>/a/ would be the perfect recruiting ground.</br>  <br>Shit you wrote 105? That's one of the most recognizable ones now.</br>  <br>to be honest I like to concept, but looking back now I don't like the execution. I've asked some of the writers still around for a rewrite but they said people wouldn't be happy if they did.</br>  <br>What, preggo raping until she miscarriages?<br><br>Not my cup of tea tbh.<br><br>But I'd volunteer donating the daily sperm for 166.</br></br></br></br></br>  I stopped following this because there was a giant amount of shitty SCPs when it started getting more well known. Has there been any big developments in lore or anything lately?  <br>This. I remember following it about 3, maybe, years ago, but stopping because the influx of new users due to the game (Which was actually cool, it was pretty fun) and it was hard to filter out the shit.</br>  <br>The author is adamant that it is not rape, and is much worse than rape.</br>  <br>What could it be?<br>Slowly cutting her, or taking her organs out and dancing on them or something like that?</br></br>  <br>Probably the more painful kinds of torture. Drilling into the bones, small repeated acid baths, things like that?<br>Nothing is scarier, as it were. It's never going to be explained clearly.</br></br>  <br>It's hard imagining something worse than rape that won't leave any permanent damage and that you can keep doing week after week for years.</br>  <br>"Permanent" damage has a different meaning when you have all the sciencemagic in the world including a reusable regenerative pendant.</br>  <br>Seconded</br>  <br> 076 vs 682 <br>Ended up with 076 having 60% of it's body destroyed<br><br> 682 vs 096 <br>Dunno, 682 would probaly win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is 682 so strong?</br>   You will never wander from village to village smoking trees and solving mysteries related to psychedelic ghost insects that only you can see.   <br>inb4 why even live</br>  <br>He smokes Mushi.<br><br>And Ginko is based</br></br></br>  <br><br>It turns out weed is actually a type of mushi.</br></br>  Aren't the movie BDs supposed to be coming out these days?

Supposedly the deal with Pizza Hut happened because Eureka 7 featured a different pizza chain. The person in charge of Pizza Hut marketing saw it and thought "Damn, why didn't I think of that?", and after that approached the Code Geass staff with the idea.  <br><br> Originally Pizza Hut was supposed to make only about 3 ~ 4 appearances in the show, but either Taniguchi or the producers must have been really amused by the idea and added all sorts of scenes. The marketing manager was really shocked when the delivery motorcycle actually made an appearance in the show. Neither did he expect to see the Pizza Hut logo all over the place. <br><br> According to him, the limited time-only Code Geass Pizza Hut box is now considered a "rare" item. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  WCdonald is everywhere.  <br> I love cocks. <br><br>Confirmed for actually being Moot.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
