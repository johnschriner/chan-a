[   <br>イケメン</br>  Her thing was overdone a bit in the Gaiden, however it was still cute in that retarded-12-year-old kind of way.<br>I don't think she'll be in the Burrito film much, though.</br>  <br>She already had more screentime in the gaiden than her father did in all of part 2.<br><br>It's very likely that she'll get shafted in favor of her teammates who we have barely even seen.</br></br></br>  'Sup niggers.    <br>There's also a new poster. Bort can do the splits.</br>  fuck off  naruto is so gay, rock lee was supposed to be the strongest considering he beat naruto and sasuke. He could've beaten Gaara too with the 8 gates release  <br> Take in all of Himawaris Love! <br> -Takeuchi Junko <br>Yes I shall!</br></br></br>  <br>Does this mean she'll get more than 5 minutes of screentime?</br>  <br> both his objective and true form are surrounded in mystery <br>Not really. They fucking showed it off in the preview.</br></br>  <br> rock lee was supposed to be the strongest considering he beat naruto and sasuke <br>That's rather silly. 8 gates or no, and he could not open them all at that age, Lee would still have lost to Nardo if he used the Fox.<br>Relative to people of his generation Lee was probably in the best point at that age because everyone kept on using simple taijutsu most of the time, something he could compete with. Later on everyone and their grandma was spamming ultra super special clan magics that dwarfed his contributions. By all means I like Lee better because of his hard work and general cheer, but let's not pretend he's anything but a jobber. Not a Yamcha tier one, he's maybe up to Tien tier, but permanently stuck there.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Bolt really should have kept the lavender eyes from The Last. They suited his face and general design better.</br></br></br>  <br> Yurei challenges Bolt and co during the Chuunin Exam <br>To what? A rap battle?</br></br>  <br>It doesn't make much of a difference. I enjoy both equally.</br>  <br>Why? It's the same in the end.</br>  <br>We know it's Shikamaru's clone he's up against in Stage 3. This means either they run into each other in stage 2, prelims, or an earlier round of stage 3.<br>I'd actually like to see a proper, genin-level fight and having two lightning users face off could be pretty fun.</br></br>  <br> and having two lightning users face off could be pretty fun <br>Shit, I never even thought of that. Maybe Eminem here will end up as Bort's B.</br></br>  <br> Sarada is capable of using the Sharingan. Can she be the post powerful of her generation? </br>  <br><br>The blue colour fit Naruto who was pretty upbeat and active. Bolt is a bit more subdued and cheeky fuck or not, a bit more low key than his father was at that age, so having a bit less strongly coloured eyes would work better in my opinion. Plus it was a nice thing for him to have inherited from Hinata besides the hair banana.<br>Not that I'm too hung up about it, just noting a preference. Which was it originally?</br></br></br>  <br>Yea he just becomes a shadow of Guy-sensei, doesn't even have a son</br>  <br>Since when does Hinata have banana hair? Anyhoo Hinata already has her mini-me.<br><br> Which was it originally? <br>Blue, since that is the way they are colored in 700 which was written by Kishi.</br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't even have a son <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br> Shinki the edgy puppet kid <br> gets kicked through a wall like a little bitch <br>Why are Sand nin the absolute worst at everything?</br></br></br>  <br>wait is that confirmed his son?</br>  <br> pink line connecting Rock and Metal <br>Anon, you silly bitch. This was weeks ago.</br></br>  <br>Shut your whore mouth, Temari is good.</br>  <br> Bort is that kid at the movie theater <br>God fucking dammit.</br></br>  <br> Temari is good <br>At  sucking dick. </br></br>  <br>I'd guess so, yet she still shows up less in promotional material than Inojin does.</br>  <br>Shikamaru's looking a bit middle eastern there. Also what the hell was Konohamaru doing while Sausage taught lighning shit to Bolt? Teaching Mitsuki (since Sarada is likely being forced to adapt the ways of the healslut from her mother)?</br>  <br>Makes sense. She's not participating in the Chuunin Exams, which make up at least 2/3rds of the movie.</br>  <br> Shikamaru's looking a bit middle eastern there <br>He married a literal sandnigger. <br><br><br> Also what the hell was Konohamaru doing while Sausage taught lighning shit to Bolt? <br>Probably being irrelevant, as always.<br><br><br> since Sarada is likely being forced to adapt the ways of the healslut from her mother <br>Gotta learn how to revive Bort's fish for later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd guess her scenes at most would be<br> birthday party <br> potentially a breakfast scene <br> cheering at the stadium <br> maybe a 'take care of mom for me, okay?' scene between her an Bolt before he goes off with the Kages to rescue Naruto <br>I'd normally guess maybe two scenes tops and background duty in those at that, but the VA did specifically mention her, so who knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, they don't. <br><br>It looks to be father/son drama, training with Sasuke, chunnin exams/villains attacking and Naruto rescue mission</br></br></br>  <br>What movie are they watching?</br>  <br> http://www.billboard-japan.com/goo<wbr>ds/detail/494363</wbr> <br>If you pay attention to the OST the ayyliens don't show up until the third act. The backdrop of most of the movie is the Chuunin Exams.</br></br>  <br>I know Sasuke only has one arm, but it looks like he's going "I-I-It's not like I want you to have popcorn or anything, Sarada."</br>  <br> Salad gripping her firm hard large soda with both hands and sneaking a peek at her edgy father <br> Sauce being such a sperg to his own daughter he can't look at her while handing her some fucking popcorn <br> Bort being a hyperactive shithead <br> Nardo not really knowing how to deal with any of this <br>This fucking  family. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yea he just becomes a shadow of Guy-sensei <br>It's not like he was ever meant to be anything more, nor did he want to be anything more.<br>I wonder if he's still a chuunin or somehow managed to get the jounin rank. Having fuck all of an idea about most of the stuff he'd need to teach any pupils I'm guessing he stays chuunin.<br>It's also rather strange how no one confirms or denies whether he smelted Metal with 10/10 or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wonder if he's still a chuunin or somehow managed to get the jounin rank <br>He's the exam coordinator for the movie. Him, and 10/10, and Shino.<br><br>The only member of the Rookie 9 we still know nothing about is Kiba, and I wouldn't be surprised if he's the new InoShikaCho's instructor.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing Shino gets stage 1, 10/10 stage 2 and Lee stage 3?<br>The last part could lead to some fun moments.</br></br>  <br>Seems that way. Lee coordinating the intelligence portion of the exam would be fucking retarded.<br><br>Honestly, the more I hear about this movie the better it sounds. Everyone gets to participate.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Lee going bald?</br>  Sarada becomes the Hokage and Boruto is the first lady of the ninja world.  <br>No, he'll become his generation's Jiraiya, wandering around, being based as fuck (once he settles his butthurt about daddy and grows up a bit) and generally being the village's eyes.</br>  <br>Isn't that what Sasuke does already? Minus writing smut.</br>  <br> Responsible for the operation of the chunin exam <br> The amount of hair on the front and back of his head is decreasing...? </br></br>  <br>Pretty much, yeah. Another bit of POTTERY I suppose, although linking someone as based as Jiraiya to a faggot like Sasuke seems deeply wrong.</br>  <br>Yes, but Bort won't need to atone for anything. Hopefully. <br><br><br>If he's serious about not follower his father's "lame era" he'll probably be her Danzo.</br></br></br></br>  <br> inevitable skits with Lee having a horrible comb-over <br> a repeat of the Kakashi mask episode, but with Bolt, Sarada and Mitsuki trying to see whether Lee is wearing a wig </br></br>  <br>Well, Danzo was tsundere for Hiruzen.</br>  <br> a repeat of the Kakashi mask episode, but with Bolt, Sarada and Mitsuki trying to see whether Lee is wearing a wig <br>Fuck. I want that now. A lot.</br></br>  <br> If he's serious about not follower his father's "lame era" he'll probably be her Danzo. <br>I just hope he'll actually poke holes in how retarded Kishi's setting is, asking what exactly is up with the whole 'child soldiers' thing or why are they essentially making the muggles pay like no one's business for protection against another group of ninjas who were paid by other muggles to off the poor fucker, questioning what good at the end of the day their people end up actually doing.</br></br>  <br>That and if the village ever comes under attack he'll be the one to defend it since Salad is basically her mother.</br>  <br>Both did abandon the closest thing they had to a family for over 12 years, attempted to kill them right after meeting them and didn't tell them jackshit about their mothers.<br><br>Though at least Sasuke hasn't blown all of Sarada's money on ninja prostitutes (so far)</br></br></br>  <br> Though at least Sasuke hasn't blown all of Sarada's money on ninja prostitutes <br>Like how Bort blows all of his dad's money on ice cream?<br> captcha is ice cream </br></br></br>  <br>In all fairness Jiraiya probably thought the Third would take care of Nardo, had no actual blood connection to him, returned and trained him willingly and spent those years collecting info about a group actively looking to kill Naruto for the fox instead of wandering about in the forest.</br>  <br>What the fuck are those shoes Momo is wearing?</br>  <br> In all fairness Jiraiya probably thought the Third would take care of Nardo <br>That's even worse.</br></br>  <br>They're some traditional Japanese folklore thing, just like everything to do with this pale alien clownboi.</br>  <br> The focus is on the kids! </br>  <br>Why is everyone (but Hinata) always leeching Nardo's money?</br>  <br>Because he's financially irresponsible.</br>  <br>Naruto is his dad and he is a 12 year old kid. Why would he pay for the ice cream if they are together.<br><br>The dick move is stealing Naruto's ice cream and running away.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Why would he pay for the ice cream if they are together <br>Because Sauce can buy it for him instead?</br></br></br>   Precure thread   MANA DA BES    <br>I bet she can't even 1st grade math</br>    I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>Ugly cures after bump limit please</br>  <br>whats that? post more rin?</br>  Haru no Carnival when???    <br>Me too dude.</br>      <br>Akane is just plain better.</br>  <br>Rin is actually very attractive in fan art.

Occasionally has a wise word to give.<br><br>Franky - Goofy sitcom-esque dad who's hard to take seriously. He can make cool things that impress all the little ones and generally does all the heavy work. Can occasionally get serious.<br><br>Robin - Mature and understanding mother type. Finds everyone amusing and funny, except dad-member, as is typical of sitcom parents. Has wise words and advice but often lets everyone to their own devices.<br><br>Zoro - Cooler older brother who's got his family's back. Often admired and relied on but he's capable of being thick headed.<br><br>Sanji - Older middle child, has talents and is somewhat reliable, but he comes off as more rebellious and someone out to make himself a name. Can be understanding of others or easily provoked into fighting.<br><br>Nami - The girl in a house of crazy men. Serves as the anchor of sanity and sort of has privilege over the others. Gets along best with the "mother".<br><br>Usopp -THE middle child. He's a lot of fun but he's all about getting attention and proving himself as something viable, dorky and awkward but lovable.<br><br>Luffy - Bratty child who decides things and then everyone has to follow him because he's always three steps ahead. Loves his fam tho.<br><br>Chopper - The babiest, cute and reliant and well liked. However he shows a lot of promise and potential, nothing to scoff at.

I'm assuming they'll have to do at least one filler arc soon or else they'll catch up with the manga.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HS3<wbr>bFRSshyk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>what exactly is wrong with a low birthrate though?<br><br>maybe it's a natural progression type thing?</br></br></br>  <br>WHY.<br><br>WHY MUST YOU /a/SSHOLES MAKE ME HORNY?</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ what are French people</br>  <br>Only when you're a third world coutry undergoing demographic transition, ie lower infant mortality + contraception means you procreate less so the birthrate decreases lower.<br>For a developped country it's always bad because the active part of the population decreases, and there's no money to take care of the growing population of elderly.<br>A good birthrate for a developped country is 2 per family.</br></br></br>  <br> so the birthrate decreases lower <br>I should get more sleep.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't help but imagine him picking his nose while he said that</br></br>  <br>Superior beings</br>  <br>Oh no, I wasn't pointing out your language.

What do you guys think?  <br>Baron Omatsuri, Srong World and Z. Everything else is garbage.</br>  <br>As a German i can confirm that. The future looks bleak.</br>  <br> Toei <br> doing substantial filler arcs <br> 2014+1 <br><br>Ha, good one anon.<br>Since 2009 they've done two 4 episode filler arcs purely as promotions for SW and Film Z, then they had the perfect opportunity for a long arc in between PH and DR but for whatever mind boggling reason that filler lasted only 2 &amp; 1/2 episodes. It's not gonna happen, they'd rather just move at a snail's pace and adapt 10-12 pages per chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Baron, Strong World, Z.</br>  <br>Oh I know, It's just that I quoted the wrong post.</br>  <br> Brook, Sanji, Nami, Chopper <br><br>Why are you bringing up characters who aren't part of the Straw Hats? You might as well be talking about Vivi.</br></br></br>  <br>Film 4 is good</br>  <br>nah it was at best okay-tier. would have worked as a filler, but not really good as a movie.</br>  <br>4, 6 and Z<br><br>people like Strong World but I don't think it was that great.</br></br></br>  <br>Christ, considering how fast they're catching up, they really should put a few fillers in, else they'll have to take a break or we'll end up with a Naruto-style year of filler whilst Oda starts the next arc.<br>I remember really enjoying the one that was set just after Skypeia, in the marine base. More like that would be nice. Just strawhat shenanigans.<br><br>Since they'd be wise to include Law in these fillers too, just from a cashmoney standpoint given his popularity, i;m expecting a few fillers that at least take place after Dressrossa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one was film 4?</br>  <br>dead end race shit</br>   Law's gonna be shipped off in a few chapters <br>Not even a Lawfag but this feels surreal. He's more like a crew member than half of the SHs at this point.<br><br> yfw the plot twist is that Law was lying about his crew being on Zou, he's already disbanded them and now he's open to be next nakama </br></br></br>  <br>They're doing filler scenes already, they even gave a name to the town we see the family raid while Gladius is explaining everything about Flevance to Baby5, so I suppose an entire filler arc isn't out of the question. There's also a possibilty they'll try to expand on all the stories we can guess happened in the training montage where Baby5 clings to Doffy's leg.<br>Better not to get our hopes up though.</br></br>  <br>Dead End Adventure, the one with the Croc rip off villain</br>  <br> Vivi <br> not a Strawhat </br></br>  <br>Is there an edit of him with other character's eyes? I want to see a full Strawhat eye compilation.</br>  <br>this meme is so stale it is just annoying now</br>  <br> yfw the plot twist is that Law was lying about his crew being on Zou, he's already disbanded them and now he's open to be next nakama <br>This would trigger me if it were true</br></br>  <br>Would vivi be the cousin?</br>  <br>Law is the only character who fits the prequisites to be recruited next (Luffy saying HES MUH NAKAMAS, adventured and bonded with the whole crew, hasn't done a one piece cryface yet but is probably building up to one), but the SH crew already has a doctor and a swordsman.<br>I wouldn't mind him staying on, but I doubt his crew would disband easily given they seem very loyal  unless they've been killed or arrested and taken to impel down </br></br>  <br> yfw the plot twist is that Law was lying about his crew being on Zou, he's already disbanded them and now he's open to be next nakama <br>But then who was vivre card ?<br> the sunny is going to Impel Down </br></br></br>  <br> Is there an edit of him with other character's eyes? <br>Someone photoshopped Rocinante's eye onto Dofla and he's literally Zoro. Eyebrows may vary.</br></br>  <br> no more Bepo </br>  <br> But then who was vivre card ? <br>Kaidou</br></br>  <br>No wai</br>   yfw SH get Law to Zou and we find out   Fujitora previously came through the area on his was to Dressrosa and wiped out the Heart Pirates   <br>as if he'd just leave Bepo behind<br><br>also why bother recruiting Jean Bart if nothing was even going to come of it?</br></br></br>  <br>He did give us two of the best OSTs though.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pJT<wbr>mGfy2zzs</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gd-<wbr>a8I00Tc8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Will Rebecca join the SH crew?</br>  <br>Gambling the life of citizens to prove a point has never been so correct.</br>   yfw we reach zou <br>   it's don krieg's personal sex island </br>  <br>Yes, right after Doflamingo, Borsalino and Blackbeard do.</br>  <br>I'm going to be seriously disappointed if we never see him again.</br>  <br> the panties aren't just a texture <br> they're actually modeled to squish her butt </br></br>  <br>Fujitora knew he'd win either way. If the whole Dressrosa would get wiped, Akainu would rape Doflamingo.</br>  <br> also why bother recruiting Jean Bart if nothing was even going to come of it? <br>Contrary to popular belief Oda doesn't have every detail of OP planned out years in advance.<br><br>I don't even think he gives a shit about Jean now, he wasn't present in the Lawhat color page.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda never forgets my friend, by now you should have faith in that.<br>It might only happen in the final arc though.</br></br>  <br>It'll be a Sanji arc if we see him again. Hopefully one where he's forced to kick a woman to save his nukamas. He's gonna have to do it sometime.</br>  <br>no he doesn't have any detail planned out but he does pay careful attention to what he's drawn in the past. <br>And the Jean Bart recruitment was a set-up if nothing else.</br></br>  <br>I have faith that Oda remembers Gin, but I don't have faith that he'll reintroduce him in a way that satisfies me. A quick cameo support in the final war isn't good enough.</br>  <br>I'd want to see Akainu vs. Doflamingo at full power. Akainu seems like he would win because he wouldn't get cowed by Doffy's troll tactics but he doesn't have Conquerors' Haki, so he'd probably take a few hits.</br>  I'm okay with this translation.  <br>We could always go he goes the Hachi road with him, but he'd have to pop up in a cover story first.<br>Or imagine when Sanji finally shows up again it'll be with Gin by his side.</br></br>  <br>I want him to be captain of his crew and be journeying through the new world. Whatever happens he should be a fighter still.</br>  <br>Gandalf</br>  <br> Dorothy = ? <br>IF ONLY THERE WAS A FEMALE SUPERNOVA HMMMM</br></br>  Not again i missed out on chapter discussion now there's just gay shit.

The initial thread was all people calling Sabo and Haki an asspull and arguing about it.</br>  Reminder that we could have just read chapter 810 if Oda wasnt so stupid to deprive himself of sleep to the point where he needs so many breaks.<br><br>Inb4 apologists, his art isnt that complex and he has assistants do the backgrounds.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather a slower pace than him dying and never finishing. You'll probably call me an apologist but thats just being realistic.</br>  <br>be glad we get consecutive chapters with only 1 break between them, look at HxH or Berserk and you suddenly appreciate Odas work ethic a lot more</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128130042 <br>reminder that you are an ungrateful shitlord</br>  <br>And HxH could be at chapter 837, instead it is at 351. <br>I don't feel too bad about Oda.</br></br>  <br>Still better pace than Bleach without breaks.</br>  <br>He wont die of sitting down and moving his hand around. All he needs is more sleep but hes a fucking idiot.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128130042 <br>I'd love to see his work schedule.<br>I speculate that he wastes most of his time on these color pages. As far as I know he makes all of these himself. That time could be better spent on sleeping and thinking stuff through more. We'll be fine if he stops making these.</br></br>  I think i realised why I disliked Dresrossa so much: all the time that could have been devoted to fleshing out villains/villain fights was given to random fucking side characters charging around like that Legs guy and that dude with the massive dildo cone for a forehead. I don't hate side characters but there were just way too many for me to care about or keep track of outside of Barto and Cabbage.<br><br>All the Donquixote execs seemed like jobbers despite being fearsome pirates because of all the chaotic nonsense with side characters. There was a whole fucking chapter dedicated to those stupid dwarves, even, when Oda could have given Baby 5 a proper backstory and made her decision to totally abandon the Donquixote pirates less ??? suddenly Lao G turns on her? <br><br>I truly hope Zou/Wano has less side character garbage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece has surprisingly dense text and art compared to other shounen, a lot more shit gets done in one chapter than something like Bleach despite being around for a lot fucking longer</br>  <br>Theres no way its the color pages, they don't come out frequent enough to be causing the breaks.</br>  Trippy, right?    Can't wait for spoilers.  <br>Toriyama had a really bizzare lifestyle back when he was drawing Dragon Ball. I expect Oda to be no different.</br>  <br>Thats because other shounen artists (Especially Kubo) like to do more dramatic, full page type shots in each chapter whereas Oda prefers to try and cram as much on each page as he possibly can.</br>  <br><br>Sanji  when he actually did shit <br>BISOROMI THE STRONKEST<br>Niggabeard<br>Kumadori<br>Jozu<br>Killer or Basil<br>B Clay<br>Rosinante<br>Akainu<br> waterniggers <br>Kuzan</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True, in Alabasta the side villains were introduced in major fights leading up to the big one, not during the main conflict. You shouldn't go introducing characters during what's supposed to be the climax.</br>  <br> Legs guy <br> dude with massive dildo cone <br>go away and take your blogposting with you</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but still. I'd imagine that even for a pro like Oda these each have to take 1-2 work days to complete. All those details won't make themselves.</br>  <br>Why is he going to be shipped off? Luffy can't take Kaido on his own. The Straw Heart pirates are going to be together for a while.</br>  <br>Kubo is hands down the worst when it comes to wasting pages. Spreads, full page panels, characters repeat their lines between the chapters.</br>  <br>Sauce </br>  <br> Nami 3rd <br> not 5th <br>Why does it annoy me?</br></br></br>  <br>Are they gonna help Bonney get home to her big mom, so she can get a freshly baked new ship and crew?<br>Is Killer the dog?</br></br>  <br>I guess? This is just a musing based on what Oda lists in his SBS stuff but you could call traveling companions like Vivi and Law akin to things like cousins.</br>  <br>Even if it took 2 full days, that would be like 3 and a half color pages to make him fall a week behind. We get a break every 4 weeks and color pages way, way less often than that.</br>  <br> There was a whole fucking chapter dedicated to those stupid dwarves <br>wow, a single chapter out of 90+, oh what tragedy. <br><br> Oda could have given Baby 5 a proper backstory and made her decision to totally abandon the Donquixote pirates less ??? suddenly Lao G turns on her? <br>what we got was totally sufficient and what about Baby5s character did you not understand even though it is really simple? are you dense? Lao G did not even turn on her. You can't remember characters names, nor what events actually took place. maybe you would have enjoyed the arc more with more than a quarter of your brain switched on.</br></br></br></br></br>  Strawhat sleepin' times (sbs)<br><br>Luffy: Whenever he wants, around 5 hours <br>Zoro: Sleeps at 4 AM and wakes up at 7 AM (plus naps)<br>Nami: Sleeps at 11 PM and wakes up at 7 AM<br>Usopp: Sleeps at 1 AM and wakes up at 8 AM<br>Sanji: Sleeps at 12 MN and wakes up at 5 AM<br>Chopper: Sleeps at 9 PM and wakes up at 7 AM (plus naps)<br>Franky: Sleeps at 1 AM and wakes up at 9 AM<br>Brook: Same as Sanji<br><br>Which schedule fits yours?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kubo does really do whatever he wants with the page space, but I kind of like that about his art. It drags the pacing out somewhat but the full page panels are often well worth it.</br>  <br> Luffy on heels <br>What a bizarre view.</br></br>  <br> yfw this is foreshadowing for an arc where Luffy is captured by an enemy but rescued by his crew and Sabo joining hands. </br>  <br><br> Sanji playing as Beta-Banana </br></br>  <br>The Nefertaris were celestial dragons.</br>  <br>That Nami does things to me</br>  <br>Pretty much Usopp or Nami</br>  <br>I didn't claim it was the single source of his break, it just contributes to them.<br>But he likes doing them, so we shouldn't be mad at him for making these. If these keep him happy and excited (which is good for the manga), I don't have a problem with him spending a little time on them.</br></br>  <br>I really hope that after he's done with Bleach, he will draw for someone else. His artstyle is wasted on his shitty writing.</br>  <br>I wouldn't have expected Brook to sleep so little, or Franky to sleep so long. So Zoro is the last one awake and Franky is the one who wakes up the latest.</br>  <br>Are those the fake SH from Saobondy? Amazing.</br>  <br>You forgot Robin<br>11 PM to 6 AM</br></br>  <br>why isnt Sanji in the picture?</br>  <br> Straw Hat <br>Franky/Brook.<br> Shichibukai <br>Crocodile.<br> Yonko <br>Shanks.<br> CP9-member <br>Kaku.<br> Whitebeard Division Captain <br>Blamenco.<br> Supernova <br>Apoo.<br> Baroque Works member <br>Bentam.<br> Donquixote Pirate <br>Señor Pink.<br> Main Antagonist <br>Magellan.<br> Fishman <br>Hacchan.<br> Marine <br>Kizaru.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I know you weren't claiming that, I'm just pointing out how minor of a factor it must be. I don't know the average rate we get color pages but its gotta be at least a few months between each one, so spending a day or two working on it isn't a big deal time-wise.</br>  <br>The biggest problem with his writing is the pacing though, and thats mostly caused by his art style as we were talking about.</br>    <br>I don't doubt he's linked with Kaidou somehow.<br> post yfw Gin ipso facto is a top Zoan leader of Kaidou's crew </br></br>  Feels like Sabo is really dying soon and Luffy won't see him alive again.<br><br>The CP0 is after him, okay.<br><br>But what is the thin with Fujitora now?<br>Isn't he going to get the Strawhats?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>The best strawhat has the best sleep schedule, 01:00-09:00. Robin is close second in both cases.</br>  <br>Bellamy?</br>  <br>What if  Krieg is his underling </br>    <br>why the threads aren't quartering Sabo tho? Top lame, I concur</br>  <br>It's the first time we get a goofy reaction from him right ? <br>He may be a true Monkey D in the end.</br></br>    <br> Zoro only sleeps for 3 hours <br><br>No wonder he is always in pissed mood.</br></br></br>  Are CP0 members stronger than Doflamingo?  <br> Inb4 apologists, his art isnt that complex and he has assistants do the backgrounds. <br>Oda has stated that he sketches everything and inks EVERYTHING that moves. That obviously means all of the characters, but it also means all of the smoke/dust, moving pieces of the environment (Dressrosa's shifting and tumbling buildings), explosions, close up ocean/water scenes, crowd shots, etc.<br><br>Compared to other mangaka (or comic artists in general), Oda does a fuckton of work in a week. Compare Kishimoto: He only did the sketch and the color pages; every bit of ink was done by his assistants. And this goes all the way back to the Chuunin exam.<br><br>And I doubt anybody who hasn't drawn a comic page understands how time consuming they are. There's a reason weekly series authors have numerous assistants, monthly artists still need them, and American and Euro comics are assembled piecemeal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not sexy. Death has to be sexy.</br>  <br> Straw Hat <br>Robin<br> Shichibukai <br>Buggy.

Similar to what Garp does, but doesnt make him goofy.<br><br>Why wouldnt he be a D if he wasnt goofy? You are shaped by the people who raise you, Ds are most likely raised by other Ds so they would act similar. Maybe Garp didnt raise Dragon.</br></br></br>  How perfect would one piece be if the whole story was based on all the cover art and spreads?  <br>Or loyal to Robin whos waaaay better.</br>  <br>fuck i can't wait for the space arc.</br>  <br>...I don't understand.<br><br>It is?</br></br></br>  <br>holy shit Franky you filthy pervert</br>  I don't like this. Feels like a chapter was skipped.<br><br>At the end of the birdcage everyone was literally in a hundred square foot area.<br><br>Jesus, Sabo, Luffy, strawhats, civilians, marines, Fuji, all of them.<br><br>Then we got that chapter with Akainu and the gorosei reacting and Fuji declaring he'll hunt Luffy down and all that and now the strawhats are somewhere hiding more or less.<br><br>I mean why didn't Fuji grab them right away. Why not track them down right away if he had to report to Akainu first, they're on the same island that had all the buildings wrecked and they were all wounded. Shouldn't be too hard to locate them.<br>Why didn't he capture Jesus too? He was KO'd. <br><br>I was expecting some more after-the-battle banter and a parting of ways but the last two chapters are a bit screwy since they imply all these combatants just walked away from each other. <br>Given that Fuji didn't even exert himself much during the battle he could've easily taken all the strawhats down right away. Why even let them walk away? <br>Despite the civilians being on the side of Luffy, it would be an unprecedented victory for the marines to take down almost all of Luffy's crew + Law + Jesus.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or robin or franky<br>not every straw hat is on every color page ya dingus</br></br>  <br>this. it's indisputable. <br> the baron did nothing wrong </br></br>  <br> mfw Bellamy is in Kyros' cottage sleeping with God Usopp, Luffy, and Law <br> mfw Next Nakama NuBellamy <br><br>So does no one give a shit about the Merry Go? I guess they're just kicking back and having a good time for the night while Oda just writes the rest of the crew off?<br><br>I guess that's for the best, really. The most important saga so far and anyone who isn't Franky, Robin, Usopp, Zoro, or Luffy has been nothing but gags and minor plot points. Get rid of them completely.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think most of the art is like a parallel universe, do they have time to visit everything that's been drawn?<br><br>The log pose keeps pointing towards the next arc</br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't trying to give Zoro the picture, he wants to use it as bait and Zoro seems reluctant.</br>  <br>arent those his pants on Brook's leg?</br>  <br>You read the panda translation.<br><br>Dont do it</br></br></br>  Anybody has more gifs or webms like this? I know what the sauce is, but I need more stuff that I can post here.  <br>You'd get stuff like the Boss Luffy or Chopperman fillers. It's fun for a while and then it gets old.<br><br>The colour spreads are great for what they are.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you've really misinterpreted Fujitora's character. He never declared that he'd hunt down the strawhats.</br>  <br> and Fuji declaring he'll hunt Luffy down <br>I'm pretty sure the "exactly what I want" part of his statement refers to Akainu forbidding him from setting foot on marine territory rather than ordering him to catch the Lawhats</br></br>  <br>It's already the longest story ever told, it'd take several generations to add that much extra stuff to it and make the art that much more detailed.</br>  <br><br>Well those are parody covers, they'd have a hard time fitting in the story anyway.</br></br>  <br>maybe nami was wearing pants for once?</br>  <br>he's still probably gay though<br><br>   left Johnny and Yosaku because he was tired of being fucked every night </br></br></br>  <br>He definitely couldn't take on all 3 even at full strength. I'm sure at least one of them has a df and they probably have very good teamwork if you assume they've fought together before. He could probably beat some of the members 1v1 but the captain of cp0 could probably beat him.</br>  <br> Not only is Sabo an asspull surrogate Portgas OCDonutsteel <br> He also rides away on a flock of Ravens <br><br>How can anyone like this fucking character. Jesus Burgess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>These would make amazing anime filler arcs</br>  <br> Fuji declaring he'll hunt Luffy down <br>there really seem to be people who read the shitpanda chapter and do not bother checking better translations when they aer released</br></br>  <br>Here you go</br>  <br>A traumatizing flashback could take all his goofiness away though</br>  <br>I thought Fuji meant that it's perfectly fine that he has to quit being marine thanks to this</br>  <br>he's  hot </br>  <br>That works both way. Either he just wanted to hear akainu saying "you won't set foot in any naval base in the world" or "bring strawhat's and law's heads."</br>  Am I the only one who feels the comedy from early One Piece has disappoeared? There used to be genuinely funny moments that weren't just silly faces.  <br>and where does he say he will hunt Luffy down? you are completely misinterpreting this one</br>  <br>Sometimes not spoonfeeding you every dumb detail of the plot makes it flow better and faster.<br>You really needed to see them scurring away from the battlefield? Honestly, you can't seriously mean that you'd enjoy it. The most important part, that fact that everybody except the Dofla family will be left alone has already been confirmed, showing any more of it would be just a giant waste of our time.<br> And I'm sure Toei will not miss the opportunity to make 5 episode headcanon out of this. I just hope it won't be too bad. </br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br><br>And how exactly is he going to take down the Seven Warlord system and make his stamp on the World Government if he's not a part of it?</br></br>    <br> hot <br>In fanart maybe. I think the Luffy face is off putting coupled with how mature everything else about his design is.</br></br>  so wg uses bats (for one thing at least)<br>news fags use gulls<br>the rev boys use ravens<br><br>wut elseee</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pica's voice and Luffy and Zoro's reactions to it were some of the funniest stuff it's done in ages.</br>  <br>It is obvious how he meant it though, especially after the conversation with smoker and the fact that he let all of them go</br>  <br> Straw Hat <br>Luffy<br> Shichibukai <br>Kuma<br> Yonko <br>Shanks<br> CP9-member <br>Jabra<br> Whitebeard Division Captain <br>Jozu<br> Supernova <br>Aside from Luffy, X Drake<br> Baroque Works member <br>Crocodile<br> Donquixote Pirate <br>Doffy<br> Main Antagonist <br>Crocodile<br> Fishman <br>Jinbe<br> Marine <br>Kizaru</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah the stuff with Pica was great.<br><br>I thought Issho being Japanese Mr. Magoo was hysterical</br></br></br>  <br>Fuji doesn't even know that Burgess was defeated also this chapter fast forwards the world time. I'm tired of the crew going through 3 arcs in one week. The reverie is gonna happen in 4 months so there needs to be more chapters like this.</br>  What would the strawhats be if they weren't pirates? According to an SBS - <br>Luffy - fire fighter<br>Zoro - police officer <br>Nami - child care worker<br>Usopp - graphic designer<br>Chopper - elementary school teacher<br>Robin - flight attendant<br>Franky - pilot<br>Brook - detective<br><br>What do you think other people in One Piece would be if they didn't turn to piracy? Keep in mind that with cases like Chopper and Sanji, piracy helped them become their real profession, so real world relevancy with current positions wouldn't apply. For example Law could easily be a tatttoo artist or a fashion model instead of a doctor.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the whole interaction between Franky and Pink was fucking gold<br>seriously, either you people have short memory or your sense of humor changed</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OjW<wbr>cFJsg-yg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Oh man this has got me wondering what Sanji would be</br>  <br>that's how he's supposed to look<br><br> The Artful Dodger is characterized as a child who acts like an adult. He is described as wearing adult clothes which are much too large for him. <br><br>he's probably ripped under his clothes though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Fujitiger ain't gut goofed and got that huge ass bitch nigga akadog signing the song of his poeple ma boi, but there ain't no one, but god to judge, so he got gud and maddog mode, so antimoe, you gotta fear those oposition's guts but like the magical negro fuji didn't as he was shooting his discussion back as backed hit up, so cash, that moment was without regrets.</br>  <br>Brook and Zeo in Fishman Island were fucking hilarious. <br><br>Let's not forget Vergo too, goddamn Vergo was a fucking riot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you're the only one. Theres been plenty of comedy post timeskip.</br>  <br>I think people forget, during serious times there's less of a chance for jokes. Arlong Park didn't have a lot of humour in it for example. We've been in the battle with Doflamingo for like a year, had like 3 or 4 pretty harsh flashbacks. It's not changed, you've just got to follow the tone. A lot of funny stuff happened in Dressrosa but it doesn't mean that it's changed or that it's never coming back.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yif<wbr>yhUEDQis</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Shit I forgot to mention him.<br><br>He's a hair stylist apparently. I'd wager it's so he could be around women all day.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a fucking boat and it's dead. Who gives a damn</br>   Sabo's telling the story to Zoro <br> Zoro was not far off when it was actually happening </br>   sanji and chopper now   Can Dragon fly?<br><br>It seems like he's pulling Sabo out of the water and there's no real platform to stand on... except for maybe the debris of Sabo's boat.</br></br>  <br> Robin - flight attendant  <br> Franky - Pilot  <br><br>Gee Oda, could you make it any more obvious that they're fucking?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you don't think Luffy and co.'s disguises were the most ridiculous and awesome shit you need to get out of my face</br>  <br>he can teleport</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NUT<wbr>lCLXFjsU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  can we please talk about how one of the fawning flamingos on the cover looks like a male one  <br>He doesn't need to do anything. Now that the Shichibukai system is mistrusted by the population, things will change on their own. In due time, but they will.</br>  <br>Because we all take drugs that allow us to hear sounds in the manga</br>  <br> I guess they're just kicking back and having a good time for the night while Oda just writes the rest of the crew off? <br>Luffy and Law have been unconscious since the fight ended and need to rest, what else should they do in the mean time? Without their captain fit again the show can't go on.</br></br>  <br>Geppou?</br>  <br>Probably has something to do with his DF hurricane power, or maybe they sailed past when the nobles had docked and saw the burning wreckage</br>  <br> I have no imagination and need everything spelled out for me <br>Suddenly these threads make so much more sense</br></br>  <br>More importantly, did he sink the ship of that Celestial Dragon ? What else could have taken him so much time ?</br>  <br>gay flamingos isnt a shock considering we've been reading about a family of them for 2 years now</br>  <br> can't hear the characters talking when you read <br>I pity you.</br></br>  <br>It was also pretty great when they were wearing the animal costumes, and when Kinemon was pretending to be Doffy.</br>  So he was amnesiac, you could have brought that up instead of some poetic bullshit Koala! No, Oda, he knew it and just thought it up.  <br>Dragon has Hito Hito no mi:Model Jesus.</br>  <br>I didn't dare hope it was one, I though it was a short haired female.<br>Doflamingo confirmed bisexual ?</br></br>  <br><br>There is steam/wind/smoke coming off him when he lands on the ship, does Geppou do that?<br><br><br><br>Looking at the angle of the smoke, it doesn't look like he teleported.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Franky trying to blend in <br> Rolling around the city on fucking tank treds <br>The most conspicuous inconspicuous disguises ever</br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't that Brook's fruit?<br><br> Comes back from dead <br> Walks on water </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because that's possible when you read aloud </br>  <br>I find the whle thing just unnecessary. He could have just been busy at the other side of the world.<br>The news about Ace's execution broke only a couple of days before it happened. Considering the travel technology level of the One Piece universe, it would have been believable that he wasn't able to get there. Luffy was fairly close and travelled on special exclusive marine routes, that's how he was able to rush there.</br></br>  Why most of top tiers have such boring powers?<br> Garp just punches shit <br> Whitebeard just punches and quake shit <br> Raylegh just kick and cut shit <br> Mihawk just cut shit <br> Shanks just cut shit too <br>It's like strong people despise imaginative powers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Taking too much time ended up him going to fetch Sabo without both of them drowning. I doubt he did anything else.</br>  <br> More importantly, did he sink the ship of that Celestial Dragon ? <br><br>We don't know yet!!!</br></br></br>  <br> We're on a mission from God </br>  <br>Except for Whitebeard, we haven't seen any of those people go all out.

He was by far the weakest opponent the Strawhat crew has faced so far, really only getting his position by blackmailing the World Government.

We don't know how long Jinbei's cover story was in comparison to what day it is in the manga.</br>  <br>Oda says that when Luffy's with Usopp he becomes more like a normal boy. He never said "mimic".

Is it just me, or do her boobs look insanely huge?  <br>I think they are in the show's universe<br>I think Yamato and Suna's sister were both pretty flat</br></br>  <br>Show should have been divided in seasons with 6 months between them, Now it's dragging.</br>  <br>Yamato only really noticed how big her chest was, so yeah they are supposed to be pretty large.</br>  <br>She's fucking stacked compared to everyone else.</br>  <br>Why do you think she runs so slowly?</br>        <br>what an ikemen</br>  REMOVE SAIJOU SAN  <br>Behead those who insult Saijou-san</br>  Is Yamato's yan awakening?  <br>THERE WILL BE BLOOD<br>SHED</br></br>  <br>I hope there's more of her in the future.</br>  <br> Crepe scene <br>she's a bitch<br><br> Can I call you master? <br>MY DICK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that Takeo :^) </br>  <br>She'd just do really petty things that would backfire on her.

If we really need another Sawano OST it should be Nanatai.</br>  <br>True, but as far as memorability goes SnK's music trumps a lot of the other soundtracks. You hear that orchestra and immediately know what show it's from. Can't really say that about the others.</br>  <br>Not really. We don't need more than 5 albums from the same composer, especially when his style doesn't differ much from one to the other. All the other Sawano OSTs on there show off the best of his diversity and SnK doesn't bring much to the table. SnK is one of Sawano's most generic OSTs.</br>  I remember Katanagataris being pretty great  The Garo: Honoo no Kokuin OST was God Tier:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oI9<wbr>r-_Logn0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=g3t<wbr>7fbhHUIM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Feu<wbr>kNp1XYUM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_BY<wbr>6l8UnbJc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd have to be crazy to not include Ping Pong, Butterfly Joe and Ping Pong Phase 1 and 2 are brilliant homages to minimalist composers like Steve Reich.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JyT<wbr>DKxZfafM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zLc<wbr>kHHc25ww</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I think this is the most recent that I have.<br><br>I think these probably should be added into the list :<br> Nana <br> Yuri Kuma Arashi <br> Kekkai Sensen <br> Punchline <br> Hibike!

Put Garo in its place.</br>  <br>Don't be retarded and listen to the actual OST.</br>  Evangelion, Code Geass and FMA:B are 3 of my favourite animes but are the soundtracks really that good? I enjoy Cruel Angel Thesis, TUMBLING DOWN and JIBUN WOOO but apart from that, meh.<br><br>Samurai Champloo is GOAT imo, Steins;Gate is great too.</br></br>   Super is getting worse ratings than Kai <br><br>Kids don't like it, old fans don't like it. Toriyama finally managed to kill dragon ball.</br></br>  <br>It really is boring and feels like unnecessary SoL fillershit. If I wanted that I'd watch garbage like plastic memories. this is not the dragonball that any one would buy.</br>  <br><br>I just want someone to hurry up and punch someone else. It's taking too long to get going.</br></br>  <br>We need proof nigga. <br><br>Also, Kai focuses on action with the DB we all know and love. Super is focusing on SoL, which we don't really love. <br><br>It will pick up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source? Dbz fans eat up anything as long as goku is in it.</br>  <br>When I was a kid my grade school had the biggest playground but know that I went back and saw it, well its nothing impressive.</br>  <br>not surprising considering the slow start, we have to wait until the action/story officially begins</br>  <br><br><br>http://nomusoku.blomaga.jp/articles<wbr>/45632.html</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> I watched two episodes and can asses an entire show </br>  http://squallchannel.com/archives/4<wbr>4772127.html<br><br>And here's the viewer rate for episode 2.<br><br>Hint: It's even lower</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br> ratings <br> meaning anything </br></br>  <br>That's not proof nigga don't know what you have smoked but did we watch the same dragón ball super?<br><br>The anime was received very well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ratings are everything.

In this era people don't give a fuck about plot just give them oppai and other lewdness and they are on. <br><br>Anime has died.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it has always been that way you dumbfuck</br>  <br>Whatever. The BDs will sell like they already have with BoG, and Heroes and FnF are killing it in Japan.</br>  <br>Were Super and Kai in the same timeslot?<br><br>I know Super airs in Japan on Sundays at 9am.<br><br>I mean come on. Sunday at 9am. Who wakes up at this time (or am I self-projecting).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure which part I hate more.<br> The horrible japanese voice acting <br> The modern clean art style with all the highlighting <br> Fucking nothing happens <br><br>Also is this just a prequel to the movie we've already seen?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The entire ratings block was down this week even Conan and One Piece. If it's similar next week then I'll worry<br><br><br>Dragon Ball is a Sunday morning kids show</br></br></br>  <br>It airs at 9 AM in the morning<br>This isn't a late night show that depends solely on otaku buying BDs</br></br>  <br>It's rewriting the last two movies and doing new shit</br>  <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>If the beginning is unnecessary, it says a lot of the show itself</br>  This has been so disappointing. First those shitty SSJGod movies, now this...Dragon Ball should've just stayed dead. Not even GT was as bad as all of this.  <br> we <br><br>bitch speak for yourself<br><br>this new dragonball is a breath of fresh air<br><br>the whole series doesn't have to be entirely about mindless action</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean come on. Sunday at 9am. Who wakes up at this time (or am I self-projecting). <br>You're self projecting<br><br>Dragon Ball has been running in this timeslot for a while now inbetween Precure and One Piece. It's a morning kid anime block</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not even GT was as bad as all of this. <br>But this is better than GT. I actually liked the first episodes compared to GT which just left me annoyed and confused at everything</br></br>  <br>What an incredibly dumb line of thinking<br><br>Did you watch episode 1 of DBZ? Gohan was chasing a fucking tiger with Raditz making a slight appearance. You can say the same about Super but with Beerus.</br></br></br>  <br>It might have done better with a primetime spot.<br>I wonder what the differences in ratings are between a primetime and morning spot.</br></br>  <br><br>No it really isn't better. How can you say that this shit where nothing happens is better? For all it's flaws, at least GT had some interesting concepts, despite some bad execution and things started to move on right in the first episode.</br></br>  <br>I believe Japan never shows cartoons / animation / anime in primetime. They are always on in the mornings on weekends for kids or in the dead of night.<br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> I wonder what the differences in ratings are between a primetime and morning spot. <br>High. Primetime shows do not get nearly the amount of ratings as morning shows</br></br>  <br>Are you literally saying Super is good, because it rehashes the direction that Z took? Let the nostalgia go and look at the series as it is you retard</br>  Kids born after 1990 don't even know what Dragon Ball is...they wouldn't watch a boring slice of life about it.  <br>Some do. They don't get in the top of ratings though</br>  <br>You just fucking said <br> If the beginning is unnecessary, it says a lot of the show itself <br>I'm drawing the comparison that Super and Z both have the same starting lines, and now you're changing the topic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Could you provide some examples?<br><br>I'm raking my brain and can't think of any.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kids born after 1990 don't even know what Dragon Ball is. <br>Oh anon, this couldn't be more wrong.<br><br>If anything kids today know about Dragon Ball more than ever thanks to this being the most popular thing in the Dragon Ball franchise. Then there's the movies being best sellers</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, those seem pretty high compared to the show that come before it.</br>  <br><br><br>Pokemon airs at 7PM on Thursday<br>Aikatsu airs right before<br>also tamagotchi or something like that airs before Aikatsu<br>And Naruto airs after Pokemon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in 90s. There were alot of anime at primetime slot in Japan. DBZ, Rurouni, Hakusho, Sailor moon<br>and so on.<br>But in 00s, It became harder for anime to get decent rating at the prime time , making anime move to morning time.</br></br></br>  <br> Super and Z both have the same starting lines <br><br>So they both begin with a shitty episodes? That's no excuse, that's just why Z was a shit show.<br><br>Super doesn't have the manga excuse that Z does.</br></br></br></br></br>  We're 2 episodes in and<br> ratings <br> &gt;&gt;/MAL/ </br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>You're stupid.</br>  <br>Those shows air on TV tokyo, which doesnt have<br>as strong network as Fuji TV and NTV have.</br></br>  <br>I'm enjoying it. It's just really laid back and lighthearted similar to how a lot of the original Dragon Ball was while still having it's own charm. I don't want another Z.</br>  <br> Super and Z both have the same starting lines <br>Have you seen DBZ? Shit starts almost immediately. Raditz shows up, kicks Krillin through a house, and kidnaps Gohan.</br></br>  You're a fucking retard, OP.<br><br>It's only two episodes in. At least wait till around a dozen or so episodes in, till you make up your mind.</br></br>  I hope they don't cancel it. I'm really enjoying it so far,  <br> gif <br><br>That scene was always so OOC for me</br></br></br>   IT'S NOTHING BUT SHITTY SOL GARBAGE <br><br>there's only been two episodes.</br></br>  admit it faggots, DB was always shit.   don't mind SoL stuff because this allows the characters to develop a little on screen for a change <br> but all promised future arcs will just be recreations of the movies </br>  <br>Sure, but it was our shit.</br>  <br>Well, the first episode of DBZ is actually chapter 195 of the manga, so it's not really the beginning of anything. It aired literally the next<br>week after the first series ended.</br></br>  <br><br>The first episode of DBZ was literal filler that involved Goku trying to find Gohan in the woods before going to Master Roshi.</br></br>  <br>No, Dragon Ball Z starts with a shitty filler episode where Gohan falls in a river. Raditz doesn't show up to Kame house until episode 2, and he doesn't kidnap Gohan until episode 3. You're forgetting just how shitty Toei is.</br>  <br><br>That doesn't sound right. Let me check.<br><br>First episode of DBZ literally starts with Raditz showing up. He flies around, intimidates Piccolo, Goku and friends are having some kind of Reunion at Kame House. Raditz shows up at the end and grabs Gohan. It looks like he doesn't actually fly off with Gohan until episode 2 though so I guess there's that.<br><br>So unless the torrent I got just left out some kind of filler first episode I never saw and labeled every episode with the wrong number, you're wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama should know that his current take at Dragon Ball is half assed and doesn't deliver better than GT.<br><br>Early Dragon Ball was GOAT, then if you turn it into a powerlevel race, it's just too hard to go backpedal.<br><br> Also post source faggot. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>biggest problem is the ART. Its horrible low budget</br>  <br>The original English dub combined some of the episodes to make them less awful. I'm guessing you're watching that.</br>  <br>It's actually pretty high budget for a Toei show so far.</br>  <br> I watch Dragon Ball for the plot </br>  <br>personally I don't mind the slow pace and mundane scenes in ep1 &amp; 2, I just have a big problem with the art</br>  <br>The colors are the biggest problem. It's like watching pokemon.</br>  <br>Probably because most DBZ fans hate SoL. I'm really enjoying super so far</br>  <br>Vegeta was hilarious in episode 2. Also Beers/Whis are always great. Goku farming was lame though.</br>  <br><br><br> being this new <br> not knowing about Toei's master plan </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched pleb tier dubs that were on TV in the 90's so I tried Super for nostalgic reasons.<br><br>was the japanese voice acting always this bad? I mean, 6 year old voices for Goku and Gohan? what the fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Super airs after Precure, or was it before, I don't remember</br>  <br>No, it airs after Kamen Rider, Super Sentai, Precure and whatever other toy commercial show where ratings doesn't matter comes before it. What's your point?<br><br>Different channels maybe but still, sunday morning shows are just commercials, dude. Ratings have never mattered.<br><br><br>At least its not as bad as the dub.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Super is good so far, just like the original Dragon Ball. Americans wouldn't know that of course.  <br>Except GT which they despise with a passion.</br>  <br>Neither do the Japanese apparently.</br>  <br>Not true. GT is loathed and BofG/F got a lot of bad press. Also sounds like a lot of people hate Goku.</br>  <br>Usually the ratings for the whole show can be determined by the first 3 episodes or so.</br>  <br>Does this really come as a surprise to anyone?<br><br>It was guaranteed to be shit from the very start. Like holy shit how fucking dumb or deluded do you have to be to have expected super to be any good.<br><br>And I fucking love DragonBall.</br></br></br></br></br>   show word wide recognized by its gruesome violence, prolonged fights, deaths and super sonic punches <br> two episodes and still no action. The training scenes don't even last <br><br>Big fucking surprise.</br></br></br>  <br>There was nothing wrong with the dub.</br>  <br> just like the original Dragon Ball <br><br>Yeah, just like GT did.<br><br>Oops.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GT had great concept. It's the execution that sucked. Super clearly has Toriyama's buttcheek humour in.</br>  I'm quite enjoying it at the moment as a replacement for Jojo, and I'm not even a fan of Dragonball, however, I'm preparing to hate it in a few episodes as I can't stand similar shows such as Naruto and Bleach for their walls of dialogue and episodes of nothing happening.  <br>It isn't known in Japan for that.</br>  <br>How are they fans to deem what's necessary or not when they don't know where the plot is going? The amount of foreshadowing that could have occurred so far that they blindly say is irrelevant because they want fights scenes.</br>  <br>Yeah, they hated the fighting aspects so much that it redefined the shounem formula forever.<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br> F got a lot of bad press. <br>RoF sold cumbuckets,it's singlehandedly the most successful movie of the year in Japan</br></br>  <br>You do realize that all of those shitty Dragon Ball Z movies that are 5 minutes exposition and 80 minutes fighting were made in Japan? And shown in theaters in Japan? And watched by Japanese people?</br>  <br>Google Calm Before the Storm</br>  I actually love SoL Dragonball  I'm getting the feeling that this is way too "happy" feeling at the moment. As the above anon said, colors are too bright, the main enemy who blew up the planet looks stupid..i mean compared to dbz enemies like cell/buu/frieza he seems like hell be forgettable.  <br> SoL Dragonball <br><br><br>what does SoL mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>are you all fucking retarded? don't you remember the "happy days" inbetween every season arch in both Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT?</br>  <br> changing names <br> changing original score <br>the american dub sucks dick</br></br></br>  dragon ball has never been good  <br>Silence of (the) Lambs</br>  <br>Slice of life.</br>  <br>What names did they change?<br>And I prefer the dub score most of the time.</br></br>  <br>you gotta have nice moments to better contrast them with bad moments<br>if the whole show was just fucking beating on each other and destroying universes it would get stale fast<br>fucking burgers</br></br></br>  This is how Dragonball should be.<br><br>Yankees are getting blown the fuck out with their falconer and rock the dragon shit.<br><br>Based Toei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>lel, every amerifat says super is shit since they didn't watch the adventures of kid goku first,<br><br>fucking plebs</br></br></br>  <br><br>This, Americans have a twisted notion of what Dragoon Ball is, but what do you expect of people who started watching DBZ and probably never saw DB. Same reason they all go for Gohan's dick since they believe he was the actual main character for the amount of focus given to him.</br></br>  <br><br>It's a fucking retelling of the movies. When we finish going over the two movies again the third will be in theaters and the remaining episodes can cover that.</br></br>  <br><br>You should at least try to lurk more, crossboarder.</br></br>  <br> BofG/F <br>In Japan? No they didn't</br></br>  <br>Then I guess he's not wrong.</br>  <br>I like the SoL side of dragonball and like the show. <br>Then again it must be because i'm a huge fan.</br></br>  <br>Fucking shounenshitters.</br>  <br><br>Super is shit because we already know what will happen.<br><br> Goku gets rekt in BoG. Twice <br> Goku gets rekt in RoF in the shittiest way possible and had to rely on an even shittier plot device than the Dragon Balls to win <br><br>You'd think they'd pander to Gokufags instead of turning on them.<br><br>Things will only start getting interesting again once they go universe-hopping.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They're probably going to be dropping hints about Universe 6 as they cover the movies.<br><br>Honestly, the only reason they're covering the movies is probably because they announced the series so soon and rushed it to completion that they need to give Toriyama and friends time to come up with something.</br></br></br></br>  This is why the new series is such a bad idea. Having new content every few years is fine, but when you give them exposure every week, nostalgiafags will eventually realize the series is just mediocre.  <br><br>Well, Toriyama was trying to shift the focus on Gohan, but received a lot of negative feedback, and just went back to making Goku the protagonist.<br>As far as the "twisted notion" is concerned, it really comes down to the the transition from DB to Z.<br>Dragon Ball is more light hearted, and adventure/fantasy based. As opposed to Z, where the emphasis is on action. It still has humorous moments here and there, but there's certainly a difference in tone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself. <br><br><br>You, too, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  ITT ADHD kiddys that want EPIC FIGHTS instead of character development <br><br>We are fucking two episodes in guys, we can only tell if it's truly shit after 5</br></br>  <br>there was a lot wrong with the dub</br>  <br><br><br><br>Not true at all.Sounds like you guys need to rewatch the series.<br>The tone of the show is the same, whether you choose the Japanese OST or Faulconer music.<br><br>DBZ is about action. Dragon Ball, is the goofier/less serious one. It's not a problem with localization. You guys probably just prefer DB to DBZ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So does this mean Super will end as early as GT, or even earlier? What other factors are at work here?</br>  <br> but received a lot of negative feedback <br>Exactly, because people grew with Goku, while Americans started from 0 with Goku and Gohan but the show was focusing on Gohan.</br></br>  <br><br> If people watch Naruto fillers, why should not watch Super?</br></br>  <br>  DBZ is about action. Dragon Ball, is the goofier/less <br><br>talking about DBZ first.<br><br>DBZ does not exist, as manga is just DB. <br>you murricans are wrong. just stop.<br><br>every time<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lJ7<wbr>I8_ux-4E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> A little like Madoka Magica, with the difference that an anime without little girls, is more difficult to do.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KFQ<wbr>YL2JsXZU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>This is worse than OLHA BEEEM! WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!</br>  <br> The tone of the show is the same, whether you choose the Japanese OST or Faulconer music. <br>Sounds like you need to rewatch both the dub and the sub. <br><br>In the sub (ie the source material for what constitutes the animated series), there's no huge tonal shift of "one's action one's goofy" between DB and Z. Despite the arbitrary name change, they still feel like one singular connected story. The tone began taking a very gradual shift beginning in early Dragon Ball, and kept going until right before the Buu arc. The characterization and musical score reflect this. <br><br>The dub of Z on the other hand has inaccurate characterization and a severely over the top score that's not even the same kind of music anymore, compared to the DB dub. This makes the two series actually feel distinct and different, which, while it's fine to prefer it that way, that's not an accurate localization of the story. <br><br>That's the problem a lot of people have with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DBZ does not exist, as manga is just DB.  <br><br>Yes, but there is a very clear change in direction once Goku reaches adulthood, and the show/manga becomes much more action oriented than previous episodes/chapters.<br><br> you murricans are wrong. just stop. <br><br>How am I wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't prefer DB over DBZ but since my first interaction wasn't Z I know the series is no stranger to goofiness and can lack any notion of seriousness. People complain about Super because is harder to go from serious to silliness than from silliness to serious.</br>  <br> Yes, but there is a very clear change in direction once Goku reaches adulthood <br>Not as clear as the dub likes to pretend it is. <br><br> the show/manga becomes much more action oriented than previous episodes/chapters <br>Trying to say that the Saiyan arc is significantly more action oriented than the three arcs that preceded it is just wrong though. Two of them were literally story arcs about a fighting tournament, sandwiching a story arc about an ancient demon going around and killing martial artists. <br><br>The Saiyan arc had its share of goofyness and down time, like Goku dicking around in the afterlife, and all of that anime filler.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Super is getting worse ratings than Kai <br><br>Check your ratings. These ratings are lower than what the original Kai got, but they aren't lower than what Kai had gotten lately. There has been an overal drop in general Japanese tv ratings in the period. The highest rated anime only hits around 12-14% now and One Piece around 8%, when the original Kai aired, One Piece constantly went above 10% while the highest rated anime (Sazae-chan) reached almost 20%.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah there is a change, which you didn't live. <br>at the beginning DB was not all about action. <br>nor goofier asdfasd<br><br>That was dragon ball. the story of goku, his adventures and friends. a fucking shonen.<br><br>since Z is just fights nonsense , you all have a weird perception of what DB is<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dP7<wbr>5aZvWVdw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> show is like two or three episodes <br> HURR DURR ITS BAD </br></br></br>  <br> Trying to say that the Saiyan arc is significantly more action oriented than the three arcs that preceded it is just wrong though. <br><br>That's what I mean. The show gradually became more action focused. By the time Goku's fighting Piccolo at the martial art tournament, it's basically full blown DBZ minus the Faulconer music.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes?</br>  Sailor Moon Crystal level of failure incoming.    <br> full blown DBZ <br>That's the problem. You keep treating DBZ like more of its own thing than it actually is.</br></br>  <br><br>You have to be kidding me, if you don't think DBZ has a greater emphasis on action as a whole when compared to DB.</br></br>  <br>Ratings ain't shit, it's DVD sales they care about.</br>  <br>For long running series in normalfag timeslots TV ratings do matter.</br>  i don't know if japanese kids these days know what DB is.<br><br>I mean DBZ this , DBZ that. and i don't think DB is on air sometimes or at least all their parent have dvds or something.</br></br>  <br>It didn't effect Hunter X Hunter, and that got pushed to an even worse timeslot.

It's literally one fucking story. It was written as one story. There's no division. There's no ending of DB and then start of Z. I'm not talking about marketing, which is obviously a different beast. <br><br>Yes, if you cut the series into two halves, one half is going to be more action oriented. If you made that cut after the Saiyan arc, or before the 23rd Tournament, you could say the same exact thing. That doesn't amount to much. The action escalates gradually on a scale. Saying "this half is action, and this half isn't" is incorrect. Saying "this half is more action oriented than this half" is stating the obvious, and doesn't at all help paint Z as its own isolated story.</br></br></br>  https://dragonballsuper-france.fr/s<wbr>poilers-sur-le-2eme-chapitre-de-dra<wbr>gon-ball-super/<br><br>Narrator : Somewhere in the universe ... there is a certain someone.<br><br>Champa : Huh ?

This happed for about 10 minutes of a lot of episodes.<br>I watch Dragon Ball when I was around 14 afterwards and I thought it would be shit, it was great truly a fun ride from start till piccolo saga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sazae-san is on top <br> never heard about it <br> look it up <br> "it's the longest-running anime and non-soap opera scripted TV series in history" <br><br>Wtf? Why did I never hear about it? Never seen any threads on /a/ about it either. <br><br>Is it good?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you don't live in japan you won't understand it</br>  <br><br>The first episode was good. But I hated the second episode because it ruined Veggies character development and the trip wasn't as funny as I expected. Vegeta barely even did anything. The only good part was when he ordered that octopus.</br></br>  Production values for this show seem pretty shit.  <br>it didn't ruin any character development<br>vegeta has always wanted to become stronger than goku, even in the epilogue of the manga<br>just because he accepted that goku was stronger than him during the buu saga doesn't mean he wants it to stay that way</br></br></br>  <br> because it ruined Veggies character development <br>In what way?</br></br>  I love how most of a shits on dubs all the time but when DBZ comes up a dub that <br><br>1. Had a terrible replacement score<br>2. Would constantly fuck with the script<br>3. Freaking change characters at times (Goku's hope of the universe speech is so out of character it hurts)<br>4. Would treat the viewer like a retard (shit like Gohan explaining to the audience what he's feeling after 16 dies when we can already see it on screen)<br><br>If this were ANY other series this would be shit on constantly. Nostalgiafaggotry is strong on this board.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This and if it is about Vegeta being tsundere or that he accepted Goku being stronger at the end of Z then his point is bullshit.</br>  <br>Grandpa please, not your life story again...</br>  <br>I've never seen anyone but a handle full of people bitch about the sub here. I grew up with the dub but the sub is better, grandma Goku stopped bothering me after two episodes.</br>  <br> most of a shits on dubs <br>kek<br>But yeah, DBZ has the shittiest dubs, and anyone defending them is a retard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are two possibilities. Either Vegeta's internal dialogue changed anything or it didn't. If it didn't change anything, it was completely pointless. <br><br>I thought that he was no longer obsessed with Goku and that he accepted that he was simply better than him. You already acknowledged that Goku was better than him before. That's nothing new. The entire reason for him being frustrated is the fact that Goku is stronger than him. <br><br>Now we see that he is still obsessed with Goku. He thinks about him while he is with his family, has a constant frown on his face when he is not training because "MUH KAKAROT MIGHT BE TRAINING RIGHT NAO". <br><br>So his revelation changed nothing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying the likes of Sasuke Uchiha, Kacchan and most "Blue characters" of the "edgy" category aren't treated as self-insert characters as well </br></br>  <br><br> one piece loses more viewers than dbs <br><br>ONE PIECE IS FINISHED</br></br></br></br>  Fuck all of you, I'm enjoying Super so far.<br><br>I'm not a spic though, so the moderate amount of action per episode so far doesn't fluster me.</br></br>  <br><br>I hope so. I've read this for over 10 years. I want to fucking know what the treasure is godammit! STOP STRETCHING THIS SHIT INTO INFINITY BY TURNING ONE IN-MANGA-DAYS INTO ACTUAL YEARS AND TELL ME WHAT THE FUCKING TREASURE IS ALREADY!</br></br>  <br>Americans are the ones who got edgy Dragon Ball, not spics.</br>  <br>How much do you want to bet that the treasure is something like the adventure or friendship.</br>  <br>Fuck you. Spics got Dragon Ball and loved it. <br><br>You burgerfuckers are the ones that got DBZ and think it's all about the action</br></br></br>  <br><br>Every American I've spoken to about Super is happy with it, though.</br></br>  <br>You really dont understand the fanbase, do you?</br>  <br> We're talking about the story, the narrative, the whole product. It's literally one fucking story. <br><br>Yes, I know. Again, DB slowly becomes more action oriented. Compare the beginning of DB to the end when he's fighting Piccolo. There's a lot more action. It continues to escalate further after that.<br><br> Saying "this half is action, and this half isn't" is incorrect. <br><br>Not the point I was trying to make. I'm just stating that the tone of the show, changes as it progresses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's only been two episodes holy shit<br>save for episode 5 or 10</br>  <br><br>Oda said that he wouldn't do that. It has also been stated that One Piece is something that can turn the world on its head.</br></br>  <br><br>This indicates that it's shit because Amerishit rodents have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>Are you implying friendship and adventure can't turn the world on it's head.</br>  <br>It must be something pertaining to the old empire. It can't be gold or a weapon or something, everyone in OP is already so strong those things are meaningless. But this is a DBS thread.</br>  <br> You burgerfuckers are the ones that got DBZ and think it's all about the action <br><br>Burgerfucker here. We love Super so far. Everyone I know who watches anime, is enjoying it immensely. <br>Not sure why so many people here are buttblasted and insecure about DBZ being more action focused. It's obviously true. There's nothing wrong with that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched it once when gg randomly subbed a couple episodes. I don't think it can be enjoyed unless you're an old Japanese person.</br>  <br>After all these years I still don't understand why they made goku sound like a prepubescent naruto.</br>  <br> Super has been enjoyable so far <br>not really<br>Its boring as shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he was a prepubescent naruto?</br>  <br>Because having the same actor voice a character for so long is pretty amazing, and it fits the character.</br>  <br>I understand about having the same voice actor but what about that voice is fitting?<br>He's a buff ass adult male.</br></br>  <br>Because the voice should match his character, not his body.</br>    z fags getting BTFO <br><br>Not surprising.</br></br>  <br>It should match both.<br>The dub did a fine job with that.</br></br>  <br><br>Goku acts like a manchild in the US dub though. Imagine how jarring/retarded it would be if he still had the kid Goku voice in English.</br></br>  <br><br>Z fans love Super so far. I'll never understand the hatred toward Z simply due to the action. Yeah, it's more action packed. Can't you guys just appreciate both DB and Z?<br><br> inb4 the manga is all Dragon Ball <br><br>Yes, we all know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kek I actually started out with z as a kid and rewatch it, <br>There's your problem<br><br>  has a shit load of scenes where it is people standing around looking at each other with the occasional thought, speech and maybe a hmmm. This happed for about 10 minutes of a lot of episodes. <br>So you havent seen the show, yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  I don't know which retard decided the best way to approach a 100 episode anime was wasting at least 1/4 of it re-animating 2 movies, one of which hasn't even come to home media yet, but clearly they shouldn't have a job anymore.<br><br>seriously, what the fuck is the point? oh you want to flesh-out the movies? well that WOULD be cool except one of them is only a couple of months old. it's just stupid to rehash them. and on top of that, we haven't really started yet because they're dragging things out so damn much. dbz wasted most of its first ep, but at least the plot got rolling by 2nd one.</br></br>  <br>Awful animation, dumb story, 20 years too late<br>Will still watch tho</br></br>  <br>It didnt ruin Vegeta's development, he's still a good guy that loves his wife and kid.<br>He accepted Goku being the number 1, but wasnt willing to give up, just like at the end ofthe Cell saga where he said he wasnt gonna fight again and he did anyways.<br><br>Heck, coming out of RoF where Goku and Vegeta completely forgot about Buu saga, this was refreshing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It fits Toei's bastardization of the character, maybe. In the manga Goku isn't a retarded manchild.</br>  <br>Nope, your taste sure seems shitty, though</br>  <br>The Japanese are the ones who went to see the first Broly movie in theaters.</br>  <br>Yeah, and they already had to retcon when the movie events took place.<br><br>It's like seeing Dragon Ball Kai's Buu saga. You end up being surprised by the SoL parts, but then you realize it's going straight downhill after that.<br><br>With all that said, I wouldn't be surprised if the ratings really do end up being inferior to Kai's. This quote summarizes why I wouldn't be surprised:<br><br><br> How can we miss you if you won't go away? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Japs have shit taste what else is new?</br>   BAAAW FUCKING NOTHING HAPPENS <br><br>Meanwhile, we have plenty of meaningful events<br> Goku now works as a radish farmer and Gohan is going to get engaged with Videl, Satan is thankful to Goku for saving the world. <br> Vegeta has some family bonding and Goku goes on to train, which will help him prepare for the upcoming battles against Beerus. <br><br> BAAAAAW BUT THERE'S NO FIGHTING DURR ROCK THE DRAGON HURR </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we don't really love <br>Talk for yourself, fuckface.<br><br>I'd pay to watch a full series about Vegeta's daily life and getting somehow dere with bulma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of fights, we actually had two already, in both episodes.</br>  <br> &gt;The horrible japanese voice acting <br>Your fat is showing, merican</br></br>  fucking burgers ruining dragonball the same way spics ruined saint seiya, although that one was already ruined for a good time  <br>Yeah, the point of these episodes was very obviously to establish just what the fuck is going on with the characters now, and to introduce the villians.<br><br><br>"ruined"?<br>I've seen Saint Seiya recently, and believe me, there wasn't much to "ruin"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying a white piggu that doesn't understand Japanese can tell how bad it is </br>  <br>It is fucking horrible.<br>Have you even listened?</br></br>  If like to bring up saint seiya omega which had shit ratings but decent merchandising and that got like 98 episodes.<br><br>Ratings are important but not that much</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It's the same fucking show, no matter which dub.

Gohan always was dragged to the fights, he was never meant to be a warrior.</br></br>  <br>I watched DBZ when i was a kid before i even knew what anime was...Because it was the only anime airing (besides pokemon and digimon). You got to realize, back when we were kids, the internet wasn't as huge as it is now. I remember trying to download dbz movies from kazaa and getting porn every time.</br>  <br>so why do we need him in this show? his useless, just make him third plan character like bulmas mother or father or even chichi, dont show him at all or whatever and everyone will be happy</br>  <br>For the reacord, DBZ was shown in US television spanish dub via Telemundo.</br>  <br> http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/<wbr>01/dragon-ball-super-complete-showc<wbr>ase-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr> <br>Not even close to merican.

The worst being probably trunks... for gods sake his voice.</br></br>  <br>for super wee need someone strong to be defeated by the big evil that is not Goku or Vegeta and Yamcha can no longer fill that role since everyone can beat him.<br><br>So is up to Gohan to take Yamcha's mantle.</br></br></br>  <br> You got to realize, back when we were kids, the internet wasn't as huge as it is now.  <br>Maybe back when you were a kid, dad. Oh, wait,<br>that's impossible, DBZ started airing in 1996.</br></br></br>  <br>GT's concept was godlike and the music</br>  <br>nigga, gohan IS yamcha 2.0, everyone capable of fighthing can beat him, vegeta is better character to be beaten by evil, it will give impression that evil guy is actually strong and not kuririn tier</br>  <br> despite some bad execution and things started to move on right in the first episode. <br>Huh... it took 2 episodes for them to leave the planet in GT. Right now, we have Beerus going around blowing up things. The only issue here is that we know where it's leading, but Super has actually spent more time on the current threat than GT had done at this point.</br></br>  <br>Dub with japanese music is the best way to watch DBZ.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=t8q<wbr>WlqYNtTw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Get ready to hear this track for like 30% of the show.

If this happened to humans in real life and humans were technologically sophisticated enough to achieve FTL there is zero chance we would accidentally happen upon a race genetically identical to us in the depths of space.

Just that it had a healthy blend of jokes with action that escalated.</br></br>  I honestly don't know how people can tolerate the Japanese music over faulconer<br><br>It all sounds the fucking same</br></br>  <br> This kid needs a new epic song for every bad man <br>Do you know what is the sense of familiarity? Each song tells you how close you are from shit hitting the fan.</br></br>  Guys seriously<br><br>When was the last time any show ever got cancelled because of low ratings in the last like decade? Shows getting cancelled because of ratings are a thing of the past. Also it's only been two episodes. Wait until they continually drop with no sense of recovery before freaking out</br></br>  <br>because the japanese music fits.</br>  <br><br>This.<br>Jap soundtrack is like the same 3 songs on repeat.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you honestly trying to imply Faulconer's score didn't repeat the same songs over and over too? Without ever shutting up even</br>  <br>Well, it was two attacks, a headbut and a kick. Beerus pretty much beat SSJ3 Goku in one attack too, and in that case it was just a tap.<br><br>Either way, the movie's script writer was a Vegeta fan and when he gets angry he temporarily surpasses everyone aside from Saiyan God Goku and Beerus himself..</br></br></br>  <br> Seriously thinking Gohan can beat a god <br>Even Goku couldn't bear him as a god</br></br>  <br><br>It's still unbelievably repetitive.

That is the question.<br><br>I'd say "maybe". <br><br>I don't know. Remember when Goku was falling to earth in BoG and was unconsious? First thing he thought about was Chichi calling for him and then his friends. It was like the only time I thought Goku showed affection for her since ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm wrong that Gohan wasn't getting his ass kicked by Gotenks Super Boo?<br><br>Because he was</br></br></br>  <br>lrn2read</br>  <br> SS3 Goku never met regular slim boo <br><br>After he removes everyone from inside Super Buu, he tells Vegeta that they still can't get out since Buu is still too strong. Then they remove Fat Buu from him too, which leads to Kid Buu.</br></br></br>  <br> and was holding his own against Gotenks Boo <br>That's filler, actually. In the anime, he matches Gotenks Buu until he starts getting tired. In the manga, he's beaten up from the start.</br></br>  <br>As a dragon ball z fan I agree, but watching as a dragon ball fan I like it. Just seeing the character development of them winding down a bit while doing something funny is nice. I want to see gohan racing dende with cars. :D</br>  <br>oh well, was a long time since I read the manga</br>  <br> :D <br>What the fuck? <br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he wasn't SS3. Also he was INSIDE Boo, not actually fighting him. They weren't going to be able to escape from him while they were still inside Super Boo. Until they ripped the fat one out anyway</br>  <br><br>"I'll blast you into another dimension!" <br>"The Home for Infinite Losers!"</br></br></br>  <br>P sure Toriyama said Goku just considers Chi Chi his good buddy, but i'm pretty sure he'd be mega pissed if anybody beat the snot out of her.</br>  <br> They weren't going to be able to escape from him while they were still inside Super Boo. <br>Huh, they said nothing about being unable to escape though. They said that they shouldn't escape because Buu was still too strong for them, which means that they could escape, but didn't want to.<br><br>And, yeah, he wasn't using SSJ3 in that exact moment, but it's not like he forgot that he had that ability or something.</br></br></br></br>  Personally i wont be judging the show till we get to a major fight.  <br>DB was just fight nonsense too, from the World Tournament arc with Tienshinhan on. I would say that it started as early as the Jackie Chun tournament, if it hadn't been broken up by the Red Ribbon Army/Baba stuff (which is still action, just not as serious).</br>  Gohan wouldn't even have beaten Cell if it wasn't for Vegeta  <br> I'll never understand the hatred toward Z simply due to the action. <br><br>It's because that's what's most popular.</br></br></br>  <br>After the namek saga everyone kicked the shit out of Vegeta so beating him doesn't prove anything.</br>  <br>Dragonball's biggest die hard fanbase lies in european and south american countries who only got the dub a bit later and so it was the 90-94 generation that grew up with it. Not to mention that, at least where I'm from, they ran reruns of DB through GT for years and years until Kai came out (at which point they eventually started airing Kai).</br>  <br>Butthurt and jealousy. They hate that they're an afterthought in everything, and have to settle for table scraps from America and Japan.</br>  <br>Latin American literally has not stopped airing DB &amp; DBZ since the early 90's</br>  <br>It's the same here in Portugal and I suspect it's the same in many other Euro countries. There has not been a day in my life where I couldn't turn my TV on and watch Dragonball.</br>  <br> table scraps from America and Japan. <br><br>But spanish translation comes out before the US ones and its more accurate even the speed subs for Super.</br></br></br>  <br> Dragon Ball Kai was when Funimation finally got it right, they just had the bad luck of having their shit censored in Toonzai and Nicktoons <br><br>I could be wrong, but isn't that airing on Toonami now?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, the uncut DVD version is airing now</br>  <br>beating gohan mean even less</br>  <br>damn beerus has a super manly voice in the english dub,it does not fit his character at all</br>  <br>Yeah, that bugged me too.</br>  <br>Super is like the average chapter of Bleach, nothing happened 4/10.</br>  <br>I don't know, I personally like it. I like Bulma's new voice way better too.</br>  <br> this episode ranking below maruko chan <br> HURR DURR GUYS ITS FINISHED! </br></br>  <br>You mean Latam dub right?<br><br>Because ONDA VITAL HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.

At that age people are really into cringy shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese version of that scene is a piece of shit. They play emotional music and make Gohan cry, which completely misses the point of that scene. Gohan wasn't triumphing over evil, he was succumbing to his anger and turning into a monster. <br><br>No matter how bad Funimation was, Toei was a hundred times worse.</br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck did spics left the Japanese song? How did kids would know what fuck the song is saying?</br>  <br>This was one spot where the original BTFO of the dub, but I prefer Falcouner's music for Cell's Death.</br>  <br>Are you stupid? <br><br>Jesus christ you're some blind motherfucker.</br></br></br>  <br>So you havent seen the show, yeah.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G3<wbr>qThJ_9090</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>  <br>Hey look it's the scene in the manga right before he transforms and his eyes are conspicuously dry. <br><br>Of course, anyone who thinks Soul vs Soul was fitting for that scene has never actually read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh god all of them are shit, this is why you always read manga.</br>  <br> American Cell sounds like some Infomercial narrator <br> Spic Cell sounds like a giga nigga demon <br>Did they used some voice changer? Talking like that can't be good for you vocal cords.</br></br></br>  <br>The first time we see Super Saiyan 2 Gohan he isn't crying either. It's almost like this isn't supposed to be an emotional scene.<br><br>Perhaps the fact that the only main character who doesn't thrive off of combat suddenly wants to torture someone to death is meant to be a little scary.</br></br></br>  <br>This is definitely a scene that should be associated with uplifting and optimistic music.</br>  <br><br>You can see tears from gohan. When he transforms (in a second) tears are gone. <br>In the Anime it talkes longer and when he looks at cell after transforming his tears evaporate and he goes sadistic mode.<br><br>Jesus it's like you didn't even watch the anime</br></br></br></br></br>  DOKKAN DOKKAN TSUITERU  <br>Wow you really are an autistic fuck aren't you. Defending the disgusting dub. <br><br>Check the entire fight in japanese, after gohan transforms he just kills the cell juniors and there's no upbeat music. <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As the show currently consists of two episodes that is entirely correct.<br><br>Anon has literally watched the whole show.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The reason everyone loves the transformation so much is because it's a bait-and-switch that makes you completely misunderstand what's happening? It's too bad literally no one who praises that scene has ever made that claim.</br></br>  <br>Assuming that anyone who hates the Japanese version loves the English version just gives credence to the idea that you've never actually read the source material.</br>   tfw I like Dragon Ball in both english and japanese besides a few fuckups in the early days of the dub  <br><br>why is there always such a dickmeasuring contest? Is there really such a need to feel superior over which language you watch chinese cartoons in?</br></br>  SoL is the best part of dragonball  <br> Assuming that anyone who hates the Japanese version loves the English <br><br> No matter how bad Funimation was, Toei was a hundred times worse. <br><br>I've read the manga 3 times and there is no difference. Gohan stops criying after he transforms and he just starts playing with cell. <br>The only difference is that the scene is longer in the Anime you retard</br></br></br></br></br></br>   DBZ goes full powerlevels and edgy <br> WAAHH WHERE'S THE FUN ADVENTURE <br><br> DBS goes back to fun SoL antics <br> WAAH WHERE'S THE POWER LEVELS <br><br>Can't win em all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The same reason they put and let songs in latin, even if 99% of the the people can't understand it.</br>  <br>Battle of the Gods is a good inbetween.</br>  <br>Battle of gods is terrible SHIT.<br><br>Super is good.</br></br></br>  <br>Funimation did a crappy job dubbing a horrible adaptation. Their mistakes were pissing in an ocean of piss.<br><br>If you understand the scene at all you know how stupid it is to make it so positive. The music should be foreboding and Gohan's expression should have nothing but anger. You can't tell me "all they did was extend Gohan's for 3 more pages" when that shot of him crying is probably the most iconic part of that scene in the anime. You know good and well what Toei was going for there.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally Appeal to Manchildren Nostalgia: the Japanese Cartoon</br>  <br><br>It was more like Gohan finally letting go of his restrictions after all his years fighting since he was 4, Gohan laments his dead friend the peaceful android who enjoyed life but died to make him cut loose but steels himself to avenge him and protect the planet they love with no holding back. <br><br> Gohan wasn't triumphing over evil  <br><br>He was triumphing his own emotions which held him back from defeating the evil, with them now gone he will now go beyond his emotional barrier which limited his power.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Xenoverse is apparently canon <br><br> your garystu MC is as strong as Beerus </br></br>  <br>What didn't you like about Battle of the Gods that you like about Super?</br>  <br>Remember this part? He wasn't triumphing over his emotions, he was succumbing to them. Just think about how out of character this is for Gohan.</br>  DB threads always have the worst dubfags come out of the woodwork.  <br><br>That's not the emotion that was holding him back. That was just him being arrogant, angry, and taking it down the wrong path, it took his dad dying to see it was a mistake and finally made him know he just had to get shit done quickly.</br></br>  <br> Oh fuck, half of Cell is in the air and my son won't finish him <br> If only I had a technique that could get me there fast and blow up what's remanining of him! </br></br>  <br>I think this show is a double A+ hit!</br>  <br>Something is going wrong there. Not only DBS dropped, but One Piece did too and Detective Conan and Youkai watch are also 2~3 points below the usual.

But nope, Goku has to be always right and this one time it actually mattered.<br>In retrospect this shit was so forced. <br> Goku couldn't just immediately teleport to King Kai's planet, grab him and get back. </br></br></br></br>  <br> viewer rates <br>those are tv ratings, are you fucking retarded? according to that it had more people watching it than precure and yokai witch and they are both supposed to be popular as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br> Mfw trying to listen to that fucking awful grandma goku </br></br>  <br>Yup, spics can make it work</br>  <br>The power of pounding the supreme Kai of time in the ass is great</br>  <br>You still haven`t named a problem with the JPN audio</br>  <br> implying everyone shares your shit-taste </br>   nothing happening  <br>are you guys new to DB? literally in all the seasons NOTHING happened in the first 10 eps</br>  Nothing wrong with SoL when the fucking show prolonged fights and grunting power up scenes obscenely long<br><br>Only niggers are complaining because they just want to see chimp outs and people fighting</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Fh<wbr>pxA7MFlU</wbr>  [ ]  <br> It continues to escalate further after that <br> I'm just stating that the tone of the show, changes as it progresses <br><br>Fair enough. All I'm saying is that the dub makes a far bigger contrast between two sections of the story than there already was. <br><br><br> thinking chainsmoker Vegeta is better than literally being voiced by Captain Falcon <br><br><br>I enjoy both as well.

But usually nobody's on the same page with me on that one</br>  What Toriyama needs to do is sit down and actually write/draw a new manga series<br><br>Doing this as a straight anime is ruining the artwork, the story, the world building, the character development - fucking everything!!!<br><br>I can't believe he's been idle all this time and hasn't thought out some better stories</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything Toriyama wrote, including his tweets.</br>  <br>the original Dragon Ball manga<br>Dragon Ball Z manga<br>and maybe Dr. Slump</br></br></br>  <br><br>Saying nothing is happening is a little bit off as the Beerus stuff in the background is things happening. The plot is being advanced. It's just that the main characters aren't really doing much. They have no threat and nothing to really do other than live their lives. Things are advancing though. This is why it seems like the BoG is really getting started next episode.<br><br>What's really going to be interesting is the Pilaf episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>also possibly Neko Majin</br>  <br> What Toriyama needs to do is sit down and actually write/draw a new manga series <br>Bro<br><br>If you mean a new long series, that's never happening.

Which one's canon?<br><br><br> Doing this as a straight anime is ruining the artwork <br>nigger, have you seen Toriyama's current artstyle?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   finally managed to kill <br><br>Oh I wasn't aware suddenly getting multiple new movies and a whole new TV show after over a decade of dormancy was "killing" your series. Sounds more like a revival to me but then again I'm not a stupid shitposter so my definition of words is probably a little different</br></br>  <br>fuck Jump's schedule, at this point in technology he can write and self publish whatever the hell he wants and release the story on his own schedule<br><br>shit, he could even release it online!</br></br></br>  <br> why the hell wouldn't he!? <br><br> fuck Jump's schedule, at this point in technology he can write and self publish whatever the hell he wants and release the story on his own schedule <br><br>You are so out of touch with Toriyama's personality it's sad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nigger, have you seen Toriyama's current artstyle? <br>yes, he's still got it</br></br>  Why isn't this being simulcast? Are they really delusional enough to believe it will be successful on Nickelodeon?  <br>You're under the impression that Funimation has the license to Super at all at the moment.</br>  <br>how exactly am I out of out with Toriyama's personality?<br><br>are you sure you're not the one who's out of touch?</br></br></br>  <br>Well someone must. It's not popular enough to be on tv but it still would be insane for it not to be brought over.</br>  <br>Because you think he actually wants to do a new long-term manga in this day and age.<br><br><br> Well someone must. <br>Nope</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy took it easy after DB, he already had millions.</br>  <br> he's still got it <br>that's your opinion I guess</br></br>  <br><br>you're both wrong<br><br>watch this new series tank<br>watch Toriyama get motivated to preserve his legacy<br>wait for better DB</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're deluded, holy shit.</br>  <br> lazy asshole keeps being lazy <br><br>stop the presses. The guy is, at his core, a gag manga artist. He really doesn't give a shit</br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I find it hard to believe that they had no takers. Even if Funimation passed others like Crunchyroll must have been all over it.</br>  <br>I think you're going crazy<br> watch Toriyama get motivated to preserve his legacy <br>That already happened with Battle of Gods</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, I never thought I'd see Dragon Ball Z in this light. That's funny.</br>  <br>Because Toei is a bunch of stuck up hoarders. <br><br>They probably had plenty of takers. Doesn't mean they will actually give it to them. You know of any other Toei morning series that was simulcasted before?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I really shouldn't be surprised that people this stupid find their way onto the internet, but I am surprised that any of you have enough intelligence to type words on a keyboard<br><br>it's truly a miracle</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh okay, I thought you meant it wasn't getting licensed in general. Still dumb though, every who cares has already watched it.</br>  <br>I'm not the one who is delusional enough to think Toriyama wants to write a new long manga series instead of one-shots and short runs like Jaco but if that makes me crazy so be it.</br>  <br><br>This.<br>Battle of Gods &amp;Resurrection F were amazing. It's far too early for people to be dismissing Super, it's only two episodes in. It'll likely be on par with the latest movies, since it's incorporating their stories into it.<br><br>If you don't like the latest movies, and Super you're in the retarded minority. Everyone I know loves them so far.</br></br></br></br></br>   (((( ;°Д°)))) <br> /ai/ - Idle Activities </br>  The guide: http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6  First in passion, you say?  <br>First in something.</br>  I need to catch up with Aikatsu has anything cool happened?  <br>Just Miyabi becoming best girl.</br>    Official PP stamps to commemorate the 1 year anniversary.<br>Can't imagine what you would use them for.</br>  <br><br>That part was adorable, she really looks like she's enjoying herself</br></br>      <br>units and everyone being cute</br>  <br>see <br>In short, this is a thread (read: general) for all shows and things with a target demographic of little girls.</br></br>    I miss Aikatsu so I think I'm going to have to pick it back up later today.  bump <br><br>I'm currently on episode 137.</br></br>   Boring episode. I don't like the Jalapeños at all. <br>And yet again they made Juri wear something that doesn't suit her.<br><br>This thing was cute though.</br></br></br>  Ah a newspaper dress.  I want to fuck Lala.  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>Stamp Lala's face on my cheek</br>  <br>God damn, Pink is so sexy.</br>  <br>Shion is very pretty.</br>    <br>pretty dead</br>  <br>Long haired Shion was great.<br> Short hair still cute. </br></br>  <br> loli Shion <br>I had completely forgotten.</br></br>  <br>Why, thank you.</br>  <br> candlejack jokes </br>    Feels like it might be about time for the plot to kick in now. I'll have to start avoiding posting spoilers.    <br>I wanna fuck this little faggot.</br>    How many people watch Aikatsu raw and how many wait for subs? It kind of feels like half and half so there's hardly ever a big discussion of anything.  <br>Since it airs at 5am my time, and Mezashite usually gets subs out within 3-5 days, I usually wait and watch it subbed.</br>  <br>I watch subbed, but sometimes I end up letting episodes stack up for a few weeks before I catch up.</br>  <br>I used to try to catch the livestream and download the .ts if I missed it but I lost my cap source so I just waited for subs since they're out in a reasonable timeframe. I refuse to watch Ohys and there's no decent raw groups for Aikatsu so the Mezashite encode is the only way.<br>I say used to because at some point (ep 133 judging by my text file) I got too pissed of by Madoka so I stopped watching and considered dropping Aikatsu altogether, but I'll catch up some day soon probably.<br>If I do end up dropping it that means no more BDs bought by me, but since another person on /ai/ has buying/uploading covered for now it's not the end of the world.<br>Now why the fuck did I write so much... I'll get back to finishing JPMC 02 now I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you have against Madoka?</br>  <br>Weird, I haven't seen anyone complain about Madoka since before she even joined the shows. A certain group of people thought she would be boring  and were then BTFO , but then she turned out to be a fun, honest, teasing little devil that loves her Akari-senpai.</br>  <br><br>I honestly can't remember exactly what I had against her as this was 2 months ago, but she ticked me off for some reason and made it not fun to watch Aikatsu!, which is a terrible thing to do.<br>I'll give it a try again soon and it will probably be resolved as she's probably not going to tick me off again.<br> I might've been under quite a bit of stress at the time and my mental well-being is always shaky when that happens especially now that I'm not taking antidepressants any more. </br></br></br></br>  <br>133 was when Madoka first showed some real weakness, and had to overcome her fear and face her grandmother to get a premium dress. I guess only you can know why you didn't like it.</br>  <br>I'll rewatch 133 right now to see if I was just really fucked up at the time.</br>  Behead those who insult Madoka.  <br> implying that I didn't dropped it already   sometimes I wonder why I still hang around </br>  <br>I haven't watched since halfway through S2, but I still keep up with the music and performances  because I honestly believe Aikatsu has the best music out of idol anime and love the CG. </br>  <br><br>What the hell are you doing guys, Aikatsu is better than ever right now.</br></br>  Why is Akari so  insane ?  <br>Me three.</br>  <br>You might like her this time around. I personally found her to be quite endearing in 133.</br>  <br>I don't have the motivation, I'm over 60 episodes behind at this point.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay rewatched it and it was fine, not entirely sold on Madoka but wasn't as terrible as I thought at the time at least.<br>I guess I'll catch up till 141 tonight since I have the time anyway.<br> Given that my mental health affected my enjoyment this much it does mean that I care a lot about Aikatsu! since other shows weren't affected this much. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what the hell are you doing <br>Waiting for Banruse to stop being assholes</br></br>  <br> You don't have time until you finish working on MC </br>  <br>Is that a panty shot?</br>  <br> It's why I said tonight okay, it's only 17:10 here... </br>  <br>It needs 100% more Ichigo though.</br>  <br>what should I make mine say? I'm thinking just かしこまっ! but maybe it would be better as a lewder message</br>  Ded Pirates    NOW IT FLIES TOO?<br>This fucking skateboard...<br><br> she really is </br></br></br>    <br>Raw, Aikatsu is the only show I care enough about to watch the livestream  despite having to stay up until 3AM for it. </br>  <br>Hinaki and Sumire go away.</br>  Can I just skip the second season of Aikatsu  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You'll miss a lot of good stuff, including Akari's introduction.</br>  <br>No. Did you even try? It's certainly better when you don't have to wait weekly. There are some good episodes in the first half, and the second half is required viewing if you want to watch S3 and the movie.</br>  I think I'll keep this for future use  <br>But he would be spared of the dreadful DreAcas stealing screentime, auditions, and constellation dresses from the superior girls.</br>  <br><br>It isn't THAT bad but it is a bit boring compared to the first season. You'd need to see Akari's episodes at least, and I think the season gets a little better once they stop doing the whole tie thing - around when Mizuki makes her return and introduces her partner.<br><br>Your enjoyment/tolerance of Season 2 would probably depend on which of the Dream Academy girls you like. If you like Kii, you're in luck. If you like Maria, however, you're SoL. And I don't mean slice of life.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you like Maria <br>There is anybody besides the little "I also want to be a princess" Japanese girls, who actually like Maria?</br></br>  <br>I like Maria. She's not close to my favourite or anything, but there's no reason to dislike her.</br>  <br>There's no reason to have any opinion on her. She may as well not exist.</br>  <br>That's kind of a negative and pointless opinion. She's there so that viewers can enjoy her, and in-universe she wants to be an idol and just so happens to be good at it. Thinking about it, she's kind of a perfected Fuwari, being an outdoors lighthearted girl but also a princess.</br>  <br>She literally did NOTHING, and had everybody else do stuff for her, while she was busy being cute.<br>Literally Maria Sue. And I don't like the way she got her constellation dress either.</br></br>  <br>It's fun when you take exactly the same screenshots I did.</br>  <br>Those three were really fucking cute.</br>    <br>Somebody set us up the bomb.</br>  <br>I think I've experienced too much Plutia... now I kinda wanna go bully those cut innocent little girls.</br>   you came to the wrong neighborhood puri   <br>It's less the bikini and more the style. Dorothy's is really racy for a 13-year-old and she's posed like a slut. Shion's would probably be okay if they didn't choose the absolute lewdest wrap thing configuration to make it look like she's wearing nothing at all underneath.</br>  <br>I agree with the little girls. This kind of stuff should be left to fanartists.</br>    Alright I just hit the end of the third cour of kira deco. Only 13 episodes left. I'll finish it off tomorrow. Probably.   Spanish and Mexican Cuisine has a deep connection. <br><br>1. A Spaniard is saying that.<br>2. ANYONE is surprised by that.<br><br>The tortilla factoid was pretty interesting though.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=knz<wbr>UzruxDG0</wbr>  [ ]  <br> So  from  now  on  we're   Prizmmy </br>  <br>EVERY fucking time.</br>  <br>Reina still sounds like the most feminine one.</br>  <br>I don't even know how I messed up those spoilers. Oh well.</br>  <br>I've done the same thing  with the exact same quote  before. I think it doesn't like it when there are no spaces between the tags.</br>  ALIVE    <br>The red-eyed demon is so beautiful.</br>  What are they watching? It looks lewd, going by their faces.  <br>They're watching Skips, you can see it.</br>  <br>Yes, exactly what he said. Skips is lewd.</br>    Is there a stitch of Hinaki doing Juri's thing?  Passion Jalapeno are fucking gay.   <br>Oh, Mizuki has taken up Gardening? I wonder how she's doing in the Second Banana Independent Aikatsu business.</br>  <br>I think that's taken from an old poster.</br>  The one on the left looks like Wakana.  It really feels like some egg manufacturers have bought into Aikatsu. They've changed it so that little girls will remember to buy eggs in future.<br><br>Long-term marketing strategies like this must be risky.</br></br>  This was alright. Do Juri and Hinaki have the most songs of all the units this season? Three that they've performed together so far. <br><br>And with the next episode preview: will this mean that Yuu is coming back? Kokone has already stayed for several weeks longer than she was supposed to. And Miyabi is just hanging around.</br></br>  <br>Where's Mikuru?</br>  Miyabi a cute.<br>A CUTE</br>  <br>Putting the last touches on the garden I presume?</br>    <br>Who left that kiss mark?</br>      puri  So I said I would catch up to Aikatsu, so I'm working on that.<br>134 - Okay I might've had a wrong idea about Madoka that was somehow amplified the wrong way in 133 causing me to stop watching altogether... I actually like her now after watching this episode I guess.<br>135 - For this new character we took a squirrel and modelled a human after it... And it actually worked I guess.</br></br>  <br>I'd pop-step-get her pregnant.</br>  <br>squirrels are cute shit dude</br>    <br>Rude.</br>    <br>136 - The return of Miyabi, still one of the cutest idles around. <br>I'm guessing nobody redid this stitch yet (haven't bothered checking the last 4 weeks of threads), so I'll be doing that when I get my BDs in a few days (and I guess that also includes the 2 Ran stitches from 125).<br><br><br>They sure are.<br><br>I really like squirrels okay, it wasn't my intention to sound rude...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have that UR.</br>  <br>We can be choco squirrel buddies</br>  Stop saying gracias.  <br>Siento, tsumari gomen.</br>  <br> SkipS goes up against the best duos <br> Goes commando <br> Wins <br><br>Passion Japapeno should have gone bottomless to compete.</br></br></br></br></br>    Akari thighs.   Won by half a percentage point <br> Clear leader of the pack <br><br>THE FIX IS IN</br></br></br>  <br> They were the leaders/on top <br> It was clear from the points <br>Yes, and?</br></br></br>  <br>Must lick.</br>    ded    <br>Well I caught up so here's some thoughts I wrote down in my notebook... Why do I even bother...<br>137 - It sure would suck if holding my breath didn't work to solve hiccups since it's probably the most convenient method.<br>It looked like she might not have held it for long enough though, perseverance is important.<br><br>138 - Well this rating system makes about as much sense as fan calls in DMF so I'm not sure how accurate it is (the small difference they needed to win might not be significant enough).<br>Overall I think the execution of this unit cup was nice, limiting to 2 performances/ep and having backstage shenanigans makes for a nice format.<br>I don't really have much of an opinion on the results, but they were okay I guess.<br><br>139 - MISUNDERSTANDINGS, oh well Johnny was cute as hell and the OTP of Bepp x Gakuen Mother seems to be accurate.<br>Also hey Dreaca exists and I don't mind seeing Seira any more so that's an improvement.<br>And that was a cute scene with Sena and Akari.<br>Song was nice too, I usually like it when it's not generic idol stuff.<br>Also I guess Miyabi is still around for now.<br><br>140 - Play episode, not much to write about, but well executed.<br>I liked the cuts to the audience with Johnny theories.<br>Also I'd just like to add that Miyabi was once again the cutest, but that's not much of a competition when she's around.<br><br>141 - Lol Aikatsu 8. Nice slightly terrifying mascot character.<br>It's good to see Hinaki doing more things I guess.<br>And I guess they're keeping Miyabi around until Kokone leaves? I don't remember if they actually mentioned the duration of her stay at some point.<br><br>Anyway with that I'm caught up and I can once again state that it's one of the more enjoyable shows I watch, I was wrong to consider dropping it after 133.<br><br>tl;dr: Johnny was cute, but Miyabi was the cutest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        dedXded  <br>Kyupikon!</br>    /ai/ needs something to give it some life  Miyutan!  <br>What the...how do I make MPC make screenshots the right resolution?</br>  <br>Miyu and Himika do things to my pripara.</br>  <br>Don't use anamorphic video or use mpv.<br><br>I don't think there is a way for MPC to play nice with anamorphic video.</br></br></br>      <br>Rainbow Live: After Story</br>  <br>I want to fuck Mirei.</br>    <br>Rainbow Live: Dear My Future</br>    It's all downhill from here.

Take responsibility.</br>  <br> In the scene when she flung around Naru chan’s hand too, when watching that part I felt like « wah, Bell is scary ! »  <br>I had the same reaction.</br></br>     your waifu will never blast you with a pink beam <br><br>Why live?</br></br>   Talk about Chekhov's gun... Or chekhov's decostone as the case may be   <br>The thread is perfect only because you're here, senpai!</br>  And with that I've finished Kira Deco.<br>I'm still not sure what the fuck I just watched though.<br>All those twists and turns in the final couple of episodes, it took a while but shit did finally get real.<br> Coal's chaos dunk was simulatneously hilarious and awesome as a heroic sacrifice <br><br>Subs made my head hurt at some points, but I can't complain too much, because I could just turn them off if they were that bad.<br><br>Peridot is now my favourite jewelpet.<br><br>And I think it'll be a while before I watch another JP series.

Looks like there are two Aikatsu (アイカツ) ones each with 116 sheets up at the moment.<br><br>Mine in particular (240ish sheets) has to mainly do with the 12th episode of the 2nd season plus some other general stuff it seems.</br></br></br>  <br>So all of the cans are from a single episode?

One day in a village where English soldiers are pillaging and killing, a little girl seemingly held off all the invading soldiers, saving the village. All witnesses saw apparitions of angels and the Virgin Mary intervening, protecting the village and declaring how the girl will be the savior of France. The little girl is of course, Joan of Arc.<br><br>The Catholic Church and the Pope soon got word of this but is worried that proclaiming such an event as a miracle would sour relations between the Papal States and England. Thus, the Pope decides it would be better for the miracle to be considered "Satanic" and for Joan to be killed.

Kosuda then falls in love with her for real, but she rejects him after finding out that it was all just an act before.

Maybe when she turns into a women she'll be better.</br>  What was even the point of bringing the Sternritters along? They basically killed themselves.  <br>Well never hurt to try.</br>  <br><br>Kubo is being very harsh with his characters, he is not even giving them the chance to have one last decent fight, the same is gonna happen with the vice-captains, there is really not point in bringing them along either.</br></br>  <br>For the first time, I'm actually getting the impression he just wants to bring Bleach to an end. Whether it's because he's tired or because of its fading popularity, the more this arc goes on the more he seems to be rushing through things.</br>  <br>Everywhere else is already fucked, where else are they going.</br>    everyone jobs, the chapter <br><br>But GODAMNIT, I refuse to believe Liltotto/Gigi/Bazz are dead, did they seriously went against their broken ex-boss who has gotten even more overpowered without any plan ? And what's more this happen right right away at the start of the battle ? Cut this shit Kubo, I want more of them.<br><br>Though Giselle looks as "dead" as in her previous defeats so there is still a chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yhwach has future sight. Whatever they plan will be useless in front of his eyes.</br>  <br>Because Jump rankings are mostly about what series Jump wants to try and push, and theres no reason to push a series that doesn't have an anime and is in the last arc.</br>  <br>So ? They could still try something besides attacking him straight ahead like retards. He's not omnipotent. Might as well say the same thing for the shinigamis and we know they're gonna win. Why making them back to set all the 'abandoned soldiers" revenge if it's only to make them die right at the start of the battle ? Especially when it was shown Liltotto is far from being stupid.</br>  <br> Bad guys want to join you in fighting the main bad guy <br> They run off to their deaths while occupying strong enemies <br>Two birds one stone.</br></br></br>  <br> I really wonder why bleach is suffering so hard in the ratings. <br>because focus on boring characters. At least the esada were fighitng against fan favorites or where fan favourite themselves. But who the ever living hell cares about bazzbe and lord toofsy?<br>Blue balling us with a few anel of grimjow, el, aizen and kempachi before changing focus didn't help.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no fading popularity, its been pretty steady since this arc has been going on.</br>  Hype  <br>They foolishly try to get revenge and fail, showing how strong Toofsy and Bach are. I see no problem with this at all.</br>  <br>What in the world is this thing?</br>  <br>Yeah but that's the thing, they didn't occupy shit. Ideally you'd come up with a plan to make them useful before you use them as fodder.</br>  <br>They should know their strengh way more than the shinigami, there is foolish try and being retarded. Might as well help a bit the shinigamis to get all the changes on their side. It's like they weren't even trying.</br>  <br> Zaraki and Mayuri double team <br>This has the potential to be one of the craziest fights yet. Hope Kubo doesn't fuck it up.</br></br>  <br>*all the chances on their side</br>  Why did Kubo have to kill off Gigi? But at least now things are getting interesting, Kubo has my attention. Oh and I guess Hisagi is also dead so no bankai from him.   Hisagi snipped and dies like a literal bitch <br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</wbr></br>  <br>I always keep repeating Ken and Mayuri gets way too much screentime when others characters would deserve some, but damn, this duo is way too good.</br>  <br>I fear it's another fake hyppe that will be followed by some asspull ass resurection to mirrror what happened with the sternritters a few chapters ago.<br>Might b Orihime, Mayuri, or Squad 0, most won't stay dead.</br></br>  <br>And he has a particular hatred for Kensei and Mashiro too, they both jobbed off panel by never mentioning them ever again for the rest of the ark.</br>  <br>They aren't trustworthy enough to actually plan around or rely on, but they are disposable enough to let them tag along and rush in ahead.<br><br><br>The sternritter wanted revenge for themselves, even though they knew they could never win. I couldn't really see them actually seeking help from the shinigami.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Kek.<br><br><br> Mayuri <br> Too much screentime <br>No such thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The X's shot seemed to go through around where the heart/lungs are, and his shots go through everything. And you know Kubo and his hearts.</br>  <br>Try reading Bakuman to know about Jumps inner workings thanks</br>  <br>Oh, Kubo will definitely fuck it up.</br>  <br> They actually think Hisagi is dead <br>Just like Kira is not dead, right? Kakked at Kubodrone.</br></br>   Miracle is the team joke more than levar hiself <br> power is literally miracles <br><br>I can already see the resurection plot coming.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a bit of a difference between getting shot and having half of your torso blown away. It also seems that you're forgetting the golden rule of Bleach deaths, that no matter how injured someone is, as long as a top tier healer gets to them before they die they can be saved. Hisagi might be dead and he might not be, but its too soon to assume for sure and be mad about it.</br>   Fuck it... I'm gonna kill it. <br><br>Kenpachy best Bleach.</br></br>  rip in holes hisagi  <br>The only thing worth being mad is how shit Bleach became.</br>  Grimjow, more like Grimjobber amirite?<br> cafeine AND milk poisoning <br>he's literrally sharting himself to death</br></br>  Hisagi will survive because the sniper didn't blow his head off.  <br>If you don't like it why are you reading the chapter as soon as it comes out and then discussing it in the thread?</br>   liltotto portrayed since the beginning as a caculating rational person <br> dies after attacking the very source of her power heads on <br>This is the worst. Gigi being tupid is OK but liltotto as literally disposed from the tory there with no dignnity</br></br>  <br>Reminder that when an arrancar uses resurreccion their wounds are healed.</br>  <br>It was obvious from the beginning that the sternritter were launching a rage filled suicide attack. The only people upset by this are liltotto fans who wanted her to survive.<br> MUH WAIFU IS 2 SMART 2 DIE LIEK DAT </br></br>   Liltotto, Giselle, Grimmjow and Hisagi literally one-shooted <br><br>Also, based Askin Nakk Le Varr and Lille<br><br> None of them died, right?! Right?! Gigi is still alive, huh? Huh?! </br></br></br></br>    tfw Grimmjow got really beaten like this and will be out of the battle for months <br>  tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works </br>   Hisagi down <br> Grimmjow down <br> Rebellious Quincy down <br> Kenpachi nearly decommissioned <br><br>Not a bad chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His power is OP when he doesn't explain it to people.</br>  <br> kenpachi <br> nearly decomissioned <br><br>it's like you haven't read this manga ever.</br></br></br></br>    Rebellious Stern gets offscreen'd after doing nothing <br><br><br>I just want a Liltotto/Gigi/ZBambi/Bazz SoL spinoff in the real world damnit.</br></br></br>    <br>yeah and?<br><br>kenpachi with an arm twisted is nowhere near defeated.</br></br></br>  <br>If they stopped to get him or heal him they'd also be sniped.</br>  <br>Liltotto and Giselle got beaten off screen, we don't know if they were one shot or not. Also Hisagi was already injured and a weakling so meh.</br>  If ASKIN is dealing with Grimmjow Ichigo and Co<br>PERNIDA: Kenpachi and Mayuri<br>LILE with Shunsui Urahara and them<br>who will URYU and GERARD end up facing when the only people missing are Yoruichi and Aizen. And I doubt Yoruichi hopped over to another plate and I definitely doubt they let aizen go off on his own</br></br></br>  So who will appear behind Barro next chapter?  <br>He can't use 2 hands. That's like not having a Bankai.</br>  <br>I think our lord and savior Aizen will crush gerard with reiatsu, and uryu will have a round with ginjo and facebook.</br>  <br> &gt; tfw Askin does exactly the same thing to Nel in the next chapter and it works <br>Exactly what I'm expecting. But Kubo might Kubo and reveal that Nel's ability to eat other entities spirit energy allows her to adapt to it or something.</br></br>  <br>Given how some of these fucks didn't even use their Bankai against Aizen, I doubt it matters.</br>  <br>I know it isn't really lined up to happen, but I really hope that Gerard ends up fighting Chad. I don't know why, but I think that would be a really cool matchup.</br>    Orihime, Chad and Ganju are looking for Askin on their own <br>  Separation themselves when most of the group is pretty weak to begin with <br><br>Why the fuck is no one mentioning this.</br></br></br>  <br>SOi fon uses bankai kills everyone close<br>Shunsui uses bankai ends up getting everyone killed<br>Hitsugaya uses Tenso Jurin in bankai accidentally freezes everyone<br>Yamamoto uses bankai everyone incinerates rom being close to him<br><br>See why sometimes bankai is a bad idea in group fights?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Parnkgjas, "C", going full zit.</br>  <br>because they don't matter</br>  <br>he will drop his pants and use his dick</br>  <br> orihime rejecting the doses from Askin <br> kills him by healing him and putting him to a normal level of tolerance becuse he is constantly poisoned or some shit <br><br>it would be a curious matchup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Askin can't do shit to Orihime with his power. He'd have to got beat her up old school and we have no proof he isn't fodder tier without his ability.</br>  <br>I would be genuinely impressed if Kubo makes Orihime relevant, especially when her power just works too well against Askin.</br>  <br>  All of the group job against Askin's power <br>  tfw Orihime kick beat him </br></br>  <br>Even for Ken chan, it's still his whole arm.</br>  <br>No Kendo</br>  <br><br><br><br>KUBO MAKE THIS HAPPEN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, a lot of them (soi fon especially) were too weak/tired to even be able to use bankai by that point. The only people still healthy enough to bankai against Aizen would have been Shinji and Kyoraku, and they both have weird zanpakto that would lead to friendly fire.</br>  <br><br><br>this would be gold if it happens</br></br></br>  <br>Akin can do whatever he wants because if you don't know what's going on you just fall dead.</br>  <br><br>Every fucking time. Every fucking time Kenpachi is paired up against these crazy abstract powered weirdos, and every time his raw power blows them away.<br><br>His only appropriate fights were Noitra and his reigai self.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gremmy is the only person hes fought like that</br>   people think Ken lost his arm for real <br> with Mayuri around him <br>He'll gladly zombify im and you know it</br></br>  <br>That's not how you spell Yoruichi. It's even right there in her name, "Ichi".</br>  <br> Ishiin </br>  <br><br>Not only Mayuri, the royal guards may still have something to say.<br><br>Maybe.</br></br></br></br>    <br>That's not Rukia, the reigning queen supreme.</br>  <br>This is only the second time though.</br>  <br>Not tall enough to do that, she'd be facing his dick.</br>  <br>If we're talking about flat tiny girls Liltotto is better.</br>  <br>that's a very cinematic page</br>  Thread needs some most popular girl.   when did you fall into the impression you didn't see kyoka suigetsu? <br> it was momo all along who took all those hits </br>  Just like to note, Hisagi probably ain't dead. He was wounded to attract attention of the medic who will be killed. Think more that he is bait for Hanatarou/Isane/other healers.  <br>hisagi vs nigger round 2</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  Why do I get the feeling that this match-up : Kenpachi &amp; Mayuri vs Pernida is important? That the revelation of Pernida's identity will be shocking to the two of them?<br>Is there somebody who could be connected to both Kenpachi and Mayuri that is now Pernida?</br>  <br>The only ones that would be shocking to Kenpachi would be Unohana or Yachiru, and I don't think Mayuri would care much about them. I doubt it would be somebody we know.</br>  <br>if it's yachiru everyone will shit bricks.</br>  why did the chapters release today?<br><br>will this be the schedule again?</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't really like it but at least it would be something other than the awful "yachiru is sword" theory.</br>  <br> will this be the schedule again? <br>Nope. The magazine simply came out earlier than normal in Japan and as a result we got the chapter earlier.</br></br>  <br>Oh I see.<br><br>I was just surprised.</br></br></br>  NIGGA AND PANDA TRANSLATIONS ARE SO FUCKING DIFFERENT THEY'RE BASICALLY COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CHAPTERS<br><br>WHICH ONE IS THE BETTER ONE?</br></br>  <br>pernida's reveal will be a  twist </br>  <br>mangastream always unless they go full retard then wait for Cnet or Badkarma on mangahelpers</br>  <br>..c'mon Carlos, not now!<br>But I admit, I chuckled.</br></br>   Grimmjow is dead <br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br>    FINALLY some plot progression. And thinning the numbers, too, which is a good thing.  <br>You say that but then shit like this comes up.<br> ain't no shame in kinging like kong retard </br></br>  <br><br>Don't think the numbers willg et too thin, the royal guards will do somethign for sure, like revive all the injured/dead shinigami or some other shit.<br><br> I am watching you! <br><br> how are the tracks going? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  What was Akins really planning to do back here  <br><br> unless they go full retard then wait for Cnet or Badkarma on mangahelpers </br></br>   It'll be 100+ chapters until Rukia and Ichigo see each other again   I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a Bleach chapter.<br><br>I literally don't give the slightest fuck about any character in the manga. That wasn't the case before and I was always looking forward to someone's fight.<br><br> About the only thing that might make me interested again is if Ichigo led Orihime into an alley and made out with her on-screen, as he's groping her all over. </br></br></br></br>  <br>This disgusting shit taste.</br>  <br>the same everyone else is planning, to kill everyone.</br>  <br><br> low test babby <br><br>sickening</br></br></br></br>  <br> We have two plus years before the delusional shippers start shitting up the threads again <br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>Cool blog bro. If you don't like it then stop reading it and browsing the threads.</br>  <br> wanting Ichigo/Orihime <br> calling another person sickening </br></br>  <br>I remember when wanting Rukia and Ichigo to interact didn't mean you were a shipper.</br>  <br><br>The only way is to get off the ride. <br><br>I can't believe people are still watching Bleach.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> being a Rukia pedophile <br> haven't already offed yourself </br></br></br>  <br> brings up Rukia all of a sudden <br>Someone's defensive.</br></br>  <br> people complain about the pacing being slow because side characters get fights <br> people complain when Kubo offscreens unimportant fights to speed up the pace <br>No matter what he does he can't win with /a/.<br><br><br>Wanting them to interact doesn't make you a shipper, but them interacting always brings out the shippers in full force.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> watching <br><br>if only....</br></br></br>  <br> implying people other than ichiruki shipper are passionate enough to bitch about ichihime </br>  <br>Literally anyone who wants shipperfags to fuck off will.<br><br>That said, fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't want good material because it may bring out shippers? What the fuck is wrong with you?</br>  <br> good material <br>Well thats really more of an opinion than anything else, personally I find most of Ichigo and Rukia's interactions either boring or annoying. But anyway, I never said I don't want them to interact just that I was glad it wasn't going to happen for awhile.</br></br>  <br><br> hating shipping <br><br>What are you, gay?</br></br></br></br>  <br> round 2 <br><br>the number of times Hisagi has gotten KO'd, even though he's supposed to have gotten stronger and show a Bankai is just disgusting</br></br></br>  Pictured: the only good thing about this trainwreck of a manga.<br><br>Everything else is just meme characters (i.e. Kenpachi, Aizen, Mayuri), stereotypes, filler, asspulls, needlessly extensive exposition, and powerlevels.</br></br>  <br> I find most of Ichigo and Rukia's interactions either boring or annoying </br>  <br>I'm not 200 lbs overweight, or mentally unstable, or a NEET, or a tumblrwhale, or retarded, or even unreasonably stubborn.<br><br>You can keep doing what you like with your meager pitiful life, just keep that shit away from here so we can get on with our meager and pitiful lives.</br></br></br>  <br> If you don't like shitty tsunderes and boring glances you must be gay! </br>  <br> our </br>  <br>You're on 4chan are you not?</br>  <br>Absolute shit tier opinion. Rukia isn't even the best girl, hell she isn't even the best shinigami girl.</br>  <br> The fights we get to see are repetetive and slow as fuck, you can predict the outcome before they even start <br> Meantime characters whose powers we rarely see see get ofscreen fights <br><br> WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU GUISE WHATEVER KUBO DOES YOU COMPLAIN </br></br></br></br>  <br>Another delusional opinion. Such a simple fanbase.</br>  <br>Dont act like people knew MAsk de Masculine was going to destroy Kensei and Rose</br>   Bleach's fanbase doesn't appreciate best girl. <br>It must be hard to recognize quality when you're used to shit.</br>  <br> el aizen </br>  NOOOOOOOOOO LILTOTTO!  <br> actually wanting to see Grimmjow, Aizen, and Kenpachi instead of based Chad and Orihime. </br>   just be a good boy  <br> be a good boy <br> BOY <br><br>kek'd, Gilette was the trap all along!</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The fights we get to see are repetetive and slow as fuck, you can predict the outcome before they even start <br> &gt;Meantime characters whose powers we rarely see see get ofscreen fights <br>This seems like a decent argument but it doesn't even remotely apply to this chapter. You're saying you want fights with obvious outcomes to be skipped, yet you want to see the weak quincy fighting against the quincy boss when we all know he can easily defeat them without any effort? You want to see fights where we see powers we haven't gotten to see, but you're mad about a fight involving 3 characters whose powers we all know? The fight had an obvious outcome and wouldn't show anything we haven't already seen, so why would you want to waste the time of it happening on screen?</br></br></br>  What happened?<br>Why a new one on Wednesday?</br>  <br> only Rukia fans are shippers and people who don't even read Bleach </br>  <br> &gt;unless they go full retard <br>which is their natural state</br></br>  <br>Why would people with good enough taste to appreciate Rukia waste their time with such a terrible series?</br>  What's this 10/10 character doing in a 3/10 series?  <br>I didn't realize pedophilia was considered good taste.</br>  Askin continues to be the most amusing Quincy and we're finally probably gonna see Pernida's face next chapter. And Gerard seems like he'll be fun to watch when he gets focus.<br><br>I'm guessing that Yoruichi went to get the stuff her brother brought with him, as she disappeared from Ichigo's group. But Ichigo really is an idiot sometimes as splitting the group in hostile territory is never a good idea.<br><br>Anyway, while I did expect it, it's still a shame that Lilitotto and Giselle were off-paneled as I was at least hoping to see them at least start the fight.<br><br>Well, including the entertaining Zaraki and Mayuri interactions this chapter was pretty decent I suppose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> callinga one 6/10 a 10/10 and a 4/10 a 3/10 <br>0/10</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Fuck off, samefag</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As expected of an earnest reader of Bleach, your brain is the size of a pea.</br>  <br> But Ichigo really is an idiot sometimes as splitting the group in hostile territory is never a good idea. <br>I would disagree with that. In Soul Society and again in Hueco Mundo they split up and it worked out well both times.</br></br>  <br>Your idea of reality is so skewed. I almost feel bad for you.</br>  <br> discussing a series that you hate and don't follow just to push your love of a fictional character <br> thinking you're smarter than anyone else in the thread <br>Funny m8.</br></br></br>   ship posting <br>Well, damn.</br>  <br> getting agitated when someone tells the truth about MUH SHONEN MANGA </br>  Another great thread, people! Keep it up. See you!  <br>The only person in this thread thats agitated is you, anon.</br>  <br>But they all got wrecked or captured when they split up in those arcs Anon-kun. It only turned out good in the sense that they beat or escaped their opponents.</br>   yfw kenpachi and mayuri rape the elite kill off the royal squad that now has to obey yhwach.   <br><br>at least the two most overhyped support characters are fighting together so they aren't cluttering up something like 4 months of chapters with two different fights. At least Mayuri's fights tend to be interesting with their gimmicky special moves. This might be the first time Zaraki's been in a legitimately interesting fight.</br></br>  <br><br>but mangastream is always full retard</br></br>  <br>Damn, Niggastream Nemu would have had her shit smacked hard if she ever spoke that way to Mayuri.</br>  <br>what a fucking faggot you are</br>  <br>The thing is that if they split up, even if some of them are defeated they can still be rescued/complete the mission. But if they are grouped up and get taken out by a hax power then its immediately over.</br>  <br>Oh yeah! Isn't Ichigo's birthday supposed to be around this week or something?</br>  <br><br>Every mayuri fight excluding Ishida has been the same interact with someone close to him and die</br></br>  <br> Ichigo vs Kenpachi not a legitimately interesting fight. </br>  <br>Actually it's today.</br>  Wow. I was expecting jobbing, but I wasn't expecting jobbing of quite this magnitude.   Thor and B. Sniper will fight Kyoraku and co <br>Talk about filler</br>  <br> Projecting this much.  <br>It must have been a rude wakeup call, to suddeny realize that Rukia is above and beyond the manga like this.</br></br>  <br>Mangastream is better this time.</br>  <br>While that is true, my point is still that they tend to get fucked up badly when they split up; and besides this arcs opponents are all are hax or strong as fuck, so team battles are still a better idea in regards to finishing the mission this time.</br>  <br><br><br><br>what the fuck are you all on about? thats just a fleshwound for zaraki. his battle power goes up with the amount of blood he loses ya' know.</br></br></br></br>  I see that Kubo is trying to appeal to the cancerous part of the fanbase by setting up a Kenpachi and Mayuri battle.<br><br>Needs more Rukia. This is a shitheap.</br></br>  <br>the outcomes being obvious aren't the point. The details of the interactions at least have some dynamism with Mayuri's science antics filling the space differently in between the obvious overarching plot developments. Zaraki's fights are all just the same shit filling the space between the same old beats, none of it ever changes. The best fight Zaraki was in was the one where he was the villain fighting Tousen. And then it was only any good because Tousen's end of things kept it interesting.</br>  <br> Actually it's today. <br>Amusing I had thought his birthday was 17th for some reason, but I guess I combined the date Masaki died with his b-day for some reason.</br></br>   Caring about a shitty protag's birthday.   <br>Here's your reply, but I'm not even going to grace that post with a fish image.</br>  <br>How is that even possible?</br>  <br>People actually enjoy Kenpachi and Mayuri over Rukia? Yikes, this fanbase does it to itself.</br>  <br>my thoughts exactly</br>  <br>We all know that Ichigo is going to fight 1v1, having people with him just gives him spectators, not more fighting power.</br>  God this manga is awful. How the fuck can Kubo live with himself after writing this shit?   Kenpachi &amp; Byakuya tag team got offscreened. <br><br>KUBO I'M WATCHING YOU</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck</br>   all that hype about grimmjow <br> he dies like a bitch <br><br>LIKE A BITCH!</br></br></br>  <br> people actually think Bleach characters are dead just because that got knocked down in a chapter <br>When will you people learn?</br></br>  <br>Hopefully he offscreens more of these battles so we can get to Rukia faster.</br>  Liltotto was the last of the rebel quincies standing, strongest female quincy there. She is strong somehow but we never see it, like in the fight with Byakuya or when he put down Meninas.<br><br>I will riot if Liltotto dies, but I now I need for this to advance to confirm if they are truly dead like with Harribel.</br></br>  <br>Well this arc kills off characters much quicker than it was before, so...</br>  <br> Next time we see them, Mayuri and Nemu is in twisted pieces and Kenpachi is a ball. </br>  Did Yhwach just call Lilotto a boy?<br><br>How many more of these people are traps?</br></br>  <br>It was panda's translation but I think what he said translates to "children"</br>  <br>EVERYONE!</br>  <br>Since when has there been so many Liltotto-fags around?</br>  So Jugram has The Almighty after all. Is that a common trait of all the "defective" quincies, or does it appear because he and Yhwach are two sides of the same coin?  <br><br>I assume being able to see fucking everything is pretty stressful. He can probably just pass his power to Jugram in order to relax for a while.</br></br>  <br>he can see the future wen yawach sleeps, we don't know if the all mgihty are those eyes.</br>  <br> We all know that Ichigo is going to fight 1v1, having people with him just gives him spectators, not more fighting power. <br>But Ichigo really is the lone exception in this case considering his power and MC status. And everyone else who was with him don't have those benefits, so they should stick with him, or be partnered up with another to even stand the slightest chance of surviving. <br><br>Besides that, I doubt he'll be fighting anyone 1on1 properly unless it's Yhwach, Jugram, or Uryuu, but I guess we shouldn't factor out of series logic into this though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he just does it gather souls more efficiently, or it has another purpose. At least he spared Gigi and Liltotto. Either way now we know that they both have the potential to use the almighty at least. If the Sternritter had waited just another hour they'd probably be more successful now that the transfer has taken place.</br>  <br><br> Yoru/Ichi banter topped every Ichigo/Rukia back and forth, forever, in the span of a single page </br></br>  <br>The almighty eyes thing is shown on Hasch immediately following the panel Yhwach's own eyes close. So it stands to reason the power was transferred to Hasch rather than him having it all along.</br>  <br> banter <br>KEK<br>Shippers are truly the worst.</br></br></br>  <br> so they should stick with him, or be partnered up with another to even stand the slightest chance of surviving. <br>Well, they are still in groups just smaller groups. It looks like Ichigo went with Nel and Chad/Orihime/Ganju went together.</br></br>  <br>The way I think it works is this:<br>When Yhwach sleeps, Jugram holds all his powers for safety.<br>Here, Yhwach was awake killing Lil, so Jugram killed Bazz on his own.<br>Then, after Yhwach goes back to sleep, the powers he had, including the Almighty, go to Jugram again for safekeeping</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The ironing.</br></br>  <br> trying to salvage your ego that reaching <br>Take refuge in your shitty fanart.</br></br>   Retards arguing with retards over who's the biggest retard. <br><br>Typical Bleach fans on /a/</br></br>  <br>Even Bazz knew better than to take Yhwach on personally, even if he had more personal reasons to go after Hashbrowns.</br>  <br>If soul distro comes with The Almighty then it makes sense that Yhwach would need a second user to safeguard his powers while he sleeps. Begs the question of does Yhwach having Jugram on board strengthen his powers of foresight?</br>   People are deluded enough to think that any self-respecting girl would be interested in Ichigo   <br>But he's a manga protagonist, that means that girls will slob all over his knob like corn on the cob.</br>  <br>Only three girls. Orihime, Riruka, and Nel. Who are all shit-tier girls. Thankfully, Rukia and Yoruichi are above that shit.</br>  <br>and that tsundere chick.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br> Well, they are still in groups just smaller groups. It looks like Ichigo went with Nel and Chad/Orihime/Ganju went together. <br>Hopefully that's what Kubo was doing with that panel and they did form those teams. But we'll have to wait and see if it turns out that way next week or the next time we see them.</br></br>  <br>Those are the ones that are full on lusting after his dick, but there are more than that interested in him.</br>  <br>If they split up individually I want them to do the chant that Renji made them do in Hueco Mundo.</br>  <br>No, not at all. Just those three. Anything else is reaching and baseless speculation.</br>  <br> If they split up individually I want them to do the chant that Renji made them do in Hueco Mundo. <br>That'd be an amusing throwback. But, unfortunately, I doubt Ichigo, Chad, or Nel the only ones present that were there in HM during the chant even remember it.</br></br>  <br>Even if they did remember it, I doubt they would do it without any actual shinigami there. But like you said it would be a great throwback if they did something similar.</br>  <br>Wait a minute, duck-Kun is a bush or a tree?</br>  <br>I have a feeling that Yhwach killing Lil and Gigi was actually a vision of the future, based on Jugo's comment. So they are alive for the time being.</br>  <br>Kenny cut Pernida and she explodes, why did nothing happen when Ouetsu stabbed her?</br>  <br>Because it died on the former but not the later</br>  <br> forget saving the world <br> let's look for the guy who wants to kill me <br>Ichigo, the smartest shounen MC.</br></br></br>  <br>Bad guy actually does the smart thing without any asspulls, I'm impressed.</br>  <br>Like Gate of Babylon, but with poison.</br>  <br>I dunno anon, if it was as you say there would be no reason to show Yhwach going to sleep after killing them.</br>  TONIGHT IS THE HYPE  <br>Are we getting another chapter tonight?!</br>  <br>Well, no. It's just the night before release to hype it.</br>  <br>Hey guys, I totally have my bankai now! No stop beating me before I get to use it!<br><br>Fuck you Hisagi you useless sack of shit. Hurry up and die.</br></br></br>  This week in bleach: Hisagi gets shafted for the 20th time. The end.  <br>i love how Askinn is subverting what we are used to in Bleach. great character.</br>  <br>Didn't you read previous chapters? When Yhwach goes to sleep, Jugram gets his powers.</br>  <br>you know how itll be. all of a sudden hewill go bankai and rek someone who is immensely powerful.</br>  <br>are you retarded?</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>I didn't want to read the thread because the OP mentioned spoilers. Why did it release so early?</br></br></br>  <br>Is he dead?<br>Seriously, would be annoying.<br>Well, at least they have Orihime with them.</br></br></br>  <br>Askin is the poison man. The gun man is Lille Barro.</br>  <br>They didn't notice Mayuri, a powerhouse, missing. They won't notice Hisagi either, and by that time his reiatsu has vanished. They have to leave him behind or risk getting shot again.<br><br>At least Rukia is at the top echelon, she won't be sniped any time soon.</br></br></br>  <br>I know. what are you on about?</br>  <br>If you follow the replay line, they were originally talking about Barro.</br>  <br><br><br>Was talking about Lille and you responded to him talking about Askin.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> YFW 'Gift' is German for Poison </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Has Orihime a time limit for reviving people?<br>Probably, or Kira and a few more would be back. But I hope it won't take that long for Hisagi. Or Buzz-B, Giselle, Liltotto, Candice and Meninas.</br></br>  <br>Oh gee, I never thought he would use a german-english pun within japanese text, so I didn't notice.<br>What does the original say? Gifutu or something?</br></br>  <br>Even if she didn't have a time limit, she would just get sniped if she tried. I wonder if there's anything that can block Barro's attack. Maybe Orihime's shield... at least it would shoot back.<br><br>Perhaps Hisagi's bankai allows him to escape death or strike beyond death, since his shikai is associated with death. I don't mind him dying, I just don't like to think that those panels with him, Kensei and Mashiro were totally wasted.</br></br></br>  <br>barro looks like wesley snipes</br>  <br> WATCHING bleach <br>Retard.</br></br>  <br>Soundtrack, motherfucker! Do you appreciate it?</br>  <br> Even if she didn't have a time limit, she would just get sniped if she tried <br>Well, Barro must be defeated or otherwise occupied before that, obviously.</br></br>  <br>Hey, it was really nice.</br>  <br> End <br>ASJKDFHAHKGVBJLAFGNDHKNGADGJKL<br><br>Getting a spoiler for an upcoming chapter that is a cliffhanger for the next chapter.<br><br>Fucking kubo, fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Third time, you forgot Not-King Bradley.<br>And Gremmy and Giriko were both complete idiots, so they don't count.</br></br></br>  <br>Rukia is pretty safe from being KO'd any time soon. Thankfully.</br>   This trainwreck ending <br><br>Almost reminds me of something glorious...</br></br>  <br>Oh man, that's awesome.</br>  <br> 128122506 <br><br>1000% Kubo</br></br></br>  <br>The anime is fine as long as you aren't getting mad about filler.</br>  <br>Who are the three? Giriko doesn't fall into that category because his fight was pure power, his power wasn't even crazy or abstract. The first time Kenpachi fought against a power like that was Gremmy, and now this is the second time.</br>  <br>Your definition of 'trainwreck' is really wrong if you think this even comes close to that.</br>  <br><br>You joking right? Code Geass at least made sense within the realm of its own lore.<br><br>Bleach makes absolutely no sense and Kubo cucks himself every single chapter of complete nonsense and trainfuckery that even sunrise couldn't match.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>spotted the cancer</br></br>  <br>I interpreted mangastream's version as "Uh, wait up dude... Mayuri-sama, do something about it"</br>  <br>not me m8 i hate fagg b. im the Unohana fan</br>  <br>then you should fuck off with him to reddit</br>  <br> cucks <br>Heres your reply, next time try not to make your trolling so obvious.</br></br>  <br><br> leddit mod is posting on /a/ <br><br>do you understand the implications?</br></br></br></br>  <br> only one person in the whole universe knows German word for "poison" <br><br>Also, it's you who came here with the screenshot from reddit.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Being a sperglord bleach autist who can't defend his own trainwreck of a series <br><br>haha wew lad. What's it like being Kubo's poo finger? You like fingering his asshole mate? You like sucking his dry, asian cock? Watch out for the dick cheese, there's sure to be plenty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe it's just an obvious fact for people who speak both german and english that those two words are spelled the same.<br><br>retard</br></br></br>  <br>I'm also a britbong. i didnt know what reddit was until 4chan told me.</br>  Does Askin have the dumbest, most Kubo power ever?<br><br> I increase your toxicity to whatever I want <br><br>Just say his power is poison, Jesus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But his power isn't poison.</br>  <br> Bleach makes absolutely no sense  <br>What part do you not understand?</br></br>  <br> implying 60% at the very least here aren't from reddit/tumblr <br>I'm here since a long fucking time ad this is sadly the true. There's no sekrit club.</br></br>  <br>Hey, Orihime is always relevant.<br>If it's not in the manga, it's in our hearts.</br></br>  <br>Don't respond to such an obvious troll attempt, can't you tell hes just throwing out as many buzzwords as possible to try and get replies?</br>  <br>It's abstract. He can increase the ammount of blood in your veins to a deadly dose.<br><br>It's like whatever is in you, you can have too much of it. And he can increase whatever you have in you to that deadly dose.</br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people just don't remember or understand what they've read.</br>  <br>So you're saying Bleach is deep as fuck? We all know that's not true, it just doesn't make sense.</br>  <br><br> im too stupid to understand it so its shit </br></br>  Mayura called Kenpachi a fool. Motherfucking Kenpachi. And he accepts it, what  <br>It's not really deep, just rather convoluted. (although the mythology references are nice). It still makes sense.<br><br>Go ahead, explain which part doesn't make sense. Perhaps you've forgotten something.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You can tell he's trolling because instead of giving examples he just vaguely says it doesn't make sense. If he actually gave an example you could argue against it and prove him wrong but keeping it vague makes it easy to defend his trolling.</br></br>  <br> his fight was pure power <br>Because he wanted to use it against Kenpachi, that's pretty much why he lost. The original Time Tells No Lies might have been capable of killing Kenpachi. But Giriko's power was not for direct confrontations anyway.<br>That makes Giriko, Gremmy and Pernida.</br></br></br>  I'm glad we saw Orihime this chapter. I hope she'll play a big role in a fight, she hasn't had that much of a spotlight lately.  <br>Really? I think that's pretty creative. And Askin uses it cleverly, too.<br>Compare him to Gremmy "muh imagination" Thoumeax who showed the ability to transmute matter, but fought Kenpachi by throwing random shit at him; or Pepe, whose love makes people attack their friends for no reason whatsoever. Kubo has come up with plenty of bullshit powers, but Askin's isn't one of them.</br></br>  <br> cucks <br>People should get autobanned for a week if they use this word.</br></br>  <br>To get killed. Haschwalt would have probably balanced it out.</br>  <br>Giriko does not count at all. He used the strongest version of his power and lost easily. I don't know where you're getting the idea that he might have been able to kill Kenpachi in a different way.</br>  <br>Actually no, he lowers toxicity. So the amount of blood stays the same as before, but now it's harmfull to you.<br>Otherwise the obvious effect when he uses it on blood would be the Scanners-gif.</br></br>  <br>He stopped them from hitting each other by putting that in front of them.</br>  <br>He did use the strongest version of his power in a dumb way (make me big and full with muscles!). compare it with Gremmy who lacked the imagination he needed.<br>Here's what TTNL normally does:<br>"This power works by allowing him to set "timers" upon things and beings to which they are attached. These timers are linked to specific conditions that Giriko himself can set. Once the time period is established, however, not even Giriko himself can deactivate his Fullbring. If a "timer" placed on someone or something is interfered with before the prerequisite time period ends, then all things and people under the effect, including the area itself where the effect takes place, will perish in the flames of time."<br>He also killed his wife with a thought.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I could be wrong, but I think it's the first time that Kubo made a German-English "Wortwitz". Maybe it was just the translator fucking with it.</br>  <br> her power just works too well against Askin. <br>her power defies the realm of god. Ywach is god. <br>He can see what will happen. She can make things unhappen. <br>but nah, kubo won't give a shit about that and it will be just ichigo getting stronger and beating him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously he can't just put a ridiculous timer on someone strong and instantly win the fight, or else he would have done so. Even if he could put a reasonable time limit on Kenpachi that would kill him (no proof that it would even work on someone as strong as Kenpachi), he would have been dead and his power dissipate well before the time ran out. And even ignoring all of that, his fight didn't go like that so you can't bitch about all of Kenpachi's fight being against abstract powers when his power was used very straightforwardly in their fight.</br>  <br>Literally everyone knows Bleach is a huge shitfest with asspulls, even more than JoJo.</br>  <br>Great argument there. Everybody knows. Solid.</br>  <br>  show us boring ass buzzbee fight <br>  offscreen Bach vs erection duo <br>fuck Kubo</br></br></br>  Could Aizen beat the royal guards  <br>their /b/ is showing...kanker</br>  <br>He got beaten by a non-royal jobber ritter, so no.</br>  <br>I think he could probably take any of them minus Baldmonk 1v1, he would stand no chance in a 5v1 situation like the quincies faced though. Which, I imagine, is why he bothered to build the arrancar and didn't help them when they were fighting against the gotei 13.</br>    <br>Why is lab such a dork?<br>He's the only one who makes and uses bleach reaction images anymore. Get with the times.</br></br>  <br>Incapacitated for a short while during which they couldn't have done anything to him, as he is immortal.<br><br>Royal Guards would probably seal him up again, but it's not like Aizen can ever be completely defeated.</br></br></br>  <br>And do what? Spam "cuck", dankest bait images or some other bullshit? No thanks.</br>  <br> He's the only one who makes and uses bleach reaction images anymore <br>You're wrong.<br><br>Get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Waifu portraits aren't reaction images.</br>  I'm surprised that Bach actually had to get up off his seat to kick Liltotto and Gizelle's asses, as opposed to simply giving them the Luders/Ivan treatment.  <br> be a good boy <br>Yeah, I refuse to believe that shit.</br></br>    <br>Bach can see the future, everything is going according to the script.</br>  <br>he is a fucking fool.</br>  Excuse me if I can't understand the retardation Kubo came up with when writing Dio's power, but basically he drink your blood, you die ?  <br>He doesn't take Mayuri seriously. It's like when Yachiru mocks him.</br>  <br>What?</br>   it's such a cruel callous power, isn't it your majesty? Being able to see into the future... <br><br>That's sad man.</br></br>  <br><br>Askin nask le vaar's power</br></br>  Pernidas's lightning thing reminds me of Aizen's hougyoko regeneration magic thing.  <br><br>The Deathdealing (致死量 (ザ・デスディーリング), Za Desudīringu; Japanese for "Lethal Dose"): Askin can perfectly calculate the "absolute lethal dose" of any substance he consumes - the amount that will cause death without fail - and raise or lower that value as he sees fit. By consuming blood, he can decrease the lethal dosage of the blood in his opponent's body, thus making it fatal to them.</br></br>  <br>I already said that his power is no good for direct confrontations.<br>But he could have tried.<br>Also<br> no proof that it would even work on someone as strong as Kenpachi <br>Fuck, I'm so glad that this isn't true for the Quincy. This was the laziest shit Kubo ever used.<br> Oh, your power is OP? <br> Too bad, I'm stronger, so it doesn't work </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Against Quincy he can't use the "Muh reiatsu beats your reiatsu" card.</br>  <br>He can change the amount of toxicity of a thing for a person. And he can shoot poison.</br>  <br>Meh. It's lame to be able to negate powers with pure reiatsu, but it would also be lame if some of the cheesy powers could beat anyone no matter how strong they were. Either one has issues and I don't particularly favor one over the other.</br>  <br>Addendum:<br> or else he would have done so <br>Literally know, Giriko outright said that brutes like Ken should be destroyed by brute force, so he tried this.<br>That was the whole reason for that argument, Giriko had a rather nice power thta COULD have worked wonders, but he was a retard about it and didn't even try because he was butthurt about muscles or some shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kinda suspect that Kubo wrote himself into a corner with Giriko and Gremmy, so he killed them in really pathetic ways.<br>I have no idea why TTNL suddenly can be the Hulk-serum after getting a boost, nothing like this has ever been hinted at.<br>Alternatively he just wanted to make Ken look badass, but he just made his opponents look stupid. Ken was the absolute worst choice for opposing Gremmy (storywise).</br></br></br>  http://bleach.wikia.com/wiki/Sternr<wbr>itter<br><br>Ishida is the A sternritter? what</br></br></wbr>  <br>Yhwach made him the second A.</br>  <br>MACH 20 READER<br>A<br>C<br>H<br><br>2<br>0<br><br>R<br>E<br>A<br>D<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stupid <br> envelops ken in space itself <br> not cool <br><br> i-i dont like bleach honestly! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole point of Giriko's power was that the simpler the contract, the more powerful it was. He made it incredibly simple to draw out the most possible power and still lost. Giriko died in a pathetic way because the fullbringers were just THAT outclassed by the captains. I definitely wouldn't say Gremmy's defeat was pathetic.</br>  <br>When they interact it means shit is going to be going down.</br>  Rukia stopped being a good Bleach character a long time ago. Orihime has potential at least.  <br>"Potential" is a nice way of saying "I cannot think of anything, but there has to be a way".<br><br>And no, Rukia did not finish as a character. Now she could actually build herself, as she has dealt with two of the things that have been an issue - Kaien and Byakuya.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why it needs to happen.</br>  <br>Her power already got nerfed when she tried to heal the ex-king of spirits.</br>  <br>Is that successor shit even a thing anymore now that he has become god himself ?</br>  <br>I must be, after all I am the president of the faction.</br>  <br>Thank you. People in these threads are getting increasingly ignorant.</br>  <br> m-muh loli <br><br>Fuck off you faggot pedos.</br></br></br>  <br> loli and trap are still around and getting panels while best girl barely got any screen time <br>Fuck you Kubo.</br></br>  <br><br>They are great and Nel is great.</br></br>  <br>What best girl?</br>    So where the fuck is Aizen now?  <br>in his chair</br>  <br> Aizen being left alone in the confusion <br>This will surely end well.</br></br>  <br>Well, I do not care if the story goes full Kubo this time. If it is for amusement of all, this arc has been thoroughly bad, but all these tragic, swift death are nothing but entertaining. Looks like a real war telled in a black comedy fashion. It will be a shitfest if Mayuri die in this way to be honest.</br>  <br>She was the only female quincy there unless you count Zombambi, and I'm pretty sure Zombambi is weaker than normal Bambi.</br>  <br> A normal sternritter defeated by Quincy overlord, with Yamamoto's Bankai, who absorbed the lynchpin of 3 universes plus it's sentient arm and activated his power of seeing and controlling the future <br><br>Not bullshit. We'd only have seen Yhwach move a finger and the fight would be done.<br><br>The real bullshit is that Liltotto and Giselle didn't wait until Yhwach was completely asleep. His powers hadn't been transferred.</br></br></br></br></br>  who the fuck still cares about Bleach at this point?<br><br>It hasn't been good since Soul Society, and it's been utter tripe since the tail end of the Hueco Muendo saga.</br></br>  <br>She screamed "I need to job"</br>  <br>There was not much for her on the accounting of things. She is(was) vastly inferior to any captain.</br>  <br>Kubo could have at least kept her around long enough for us to get some fan art.</br>  <br>your /b/ is showing paedo-kun<br><br>last standing =/= strongest</br></br></br>  <br> Calling someone a pedo as an insult <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Hisagi just became the disputing jobbing champion along with Shinji. Yamamoto must be really joyful wherever he is.</br>  <br>Yamamoto only lost because people literally had to plan their whole keikaku around beating him, he doesn't even count.</br>  <br>But that's not She-Hulk.</br>  <br> Discussion of biggest jobber <br> Neither Renji or Chad mentioned <br>Good for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking his point of view as The Commander of Gotei 13. This begs the question if he can be viewed as a good leader after all. Is he a good leader? <br><br>Renji redeemed himself killing the German-Mexican wrestler, he is pretty much stronger than most the Sternritter showed. I agree with Chad.</br></br></br>  <br>To me Chad and Shinji both fall into the same category. They job a lot but its mostly due to bad matchups so you can't really blame them for it.</br>  So whos gonna rescue Harribel now that Grimmjow and co jobbed?  <br>Nel</br>  <br>The kids and Tessai.</br>  <br> most of the  <br>Fast fix'd.</br></br>  <br>"C"reature</br>  <br> just <br><br>i said in a thread recently how much of a pussy he is. i think that jumping tosen from behind is his only ever win in bleach</br></br></br>  making a quiz on bleach..<br>don't know any good questions to ask cos i never read or watched bleach. can any anons help?</br>  <br>probably someone else who represents Sacrifice</br>  <br>The Gotei creed is 'stab it in the back'. They're not trained to fight fair, they're trained to kill their enemies. They've come a long way but they're still an organization built on the backs of murderers.<br><br>Also it was technically his second of two 'wins'.</br></br></br>  <br>No tbh :^(</br>  <br>He defeated Barragan's fraccion in that same arc. Putting your captain out of his shame like that is manly as fuck though.</br>  <br>who else did he beat?</br>  <br>Why would you do that? It seems like a terrible idea.</br>  <br>ah yes. but wasnt that only implied in the manga? im sure that was an anime only scene</br>  <br>A top notch anime scene, I remember. God, dat were magnificent scenes.</br>  <br>What? Which part are you talking about? Both him beating the fraccion and him finishing Tousen were in the manga.</br>  <br>Who is best girl? <br><br>Who is the biggest jobber?<br><br>How many times did someone appear behind another?<br><br>What is the super-speed technique used by Shinigami? Quincies? Hollows?<br><br>How many times faster than Cero is Bara?<br><br>The first two questions are subjective so they can be long answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Kubo quickly removed the Matsumoto and Orihime clones of the group to only keep the actual good characters <br><br>Based.</br></br></br>  <br>where he raped the fraccion. im sure it was anime only.</br>  <br>I'll give you Orihime clone, but she was nothing like Matsumoto. Also you're kidding yourself if you think Liltotto is an even remotely good character, she's shown literally 0 personality so far.</br>  <br>Litterally Matsumoto with spikes everywhere and smaller boobs</br>  <br><br>It wasn't, the anime just extended the fight.</br></br>  <br>Starkk<br><br>:3</br></br></br>  <br>Crab arrancar who claimed he was Captain-tier.</br>  <br>Nope, it was in the manga. <br><br><br>Did it? I just checked and the manga version seemed to cover the whole thing, what parts did the anime extend?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I honestly don't remember, i just remember the anime extending the fight a lot.</br></br>  <br>I don't think it actually did, unless it was just minor attacks here and there. All of the stuff about starting out as a 5th seats power and working his way up, exacta, hisagi's shikai and his speech about how he doesn't like it are all in the manga. If you remember it extending it a lot you might be thinking of a different fight.</br>  <br><br>I just went to check, they definitively extended the fight, for example, Hisagi uses Kidou a lot more in the anime. And Hisagi tears through a Cero with Kazeshini.<br><br>Just off the top of my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ass-B is finally dead <br>For once something good happens.<br> Yet another off screen fight <br>&amp; then this happens.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Like I said, I wouldn't consider adding a few minor attacks in "extending the fight a lot", its pretty standard for the anime to do stuff like that.</br>  <br> unohana_yachiru <br> UNOHANA <br><br> DIED VS KENPACHI IN A MOSLY OFF PAGE BATTLE <br><br> Understand why this anon is pissed <br><br><br>FUCKNIG KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br> I felt the same way about uno and she was my fav bleach female.<br><br><br> This has the potential to be one of the craziest fights yet. Hope Kubo doesn't fuck it up. <br>Its like you know nothing about kubo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complaining about this offscreen <br><br>Did you really want to waste a chapter on two random nobodies getting wrecked by yhwach? The fuck were they even thinking trying to fight him?</br></br></br>  <br>As if Liltotto and Gigi actually stood a chance against Yhwach? I'd rather get to the real fights.</br>  <br> Actually wanting to see 2 boring characters whose powers we already know fighting a battle they could never win <br>Why are people upset about this? The only reason I can think of are pedo's who love Liltotto but that isn't a good enough excuse to bitch about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Point is, they extended the fight.</br></br>  <br> mostly off page battle <br>Are you kidding? Didn't that fight last almost an entire volume? At least 5 chapters dedicated to pure swordplay and violent bloodlust.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, I disagree that adding an attack or two counts as extending the fight.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you disagree that extending the fight counts as extending the fight, good for you.</br></br>  <br><br>Please pick a new topic, you're both going in circles at this point</br></br>  <br>Not how i remember it.<br><br>I recall it happening during the battle where everyone was getting assraveged by the quincy and kenpachi was the last hope.<br><br>He was fighting uno off page while everyone else was getting destroyed by the quincy.<br><br>Bomb bitch and the kid with the imagination asspull powers damn near killed everyone then it cuts to kenpachi killing uno and going to save everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pernidas is the most creepy Bleach character I've seen so far.  <br><br> not Allon or Kirge or F the fear </br></br>  <br> Not how I remember it. <br><br>You're remembering it completely wrong. Ichigo was still training with Ouetsu at that time. Kenpachi shows up late to the 2nd invasion but the fight had been long over at that point. Tankobon 59 "The Battle" in case you weren't sure. Followed by the Masaki/Isshin flashback arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure about that?</br>  <br>Go reread it then, you're getting mad about nothing. Their fight took place between the two invasions, not during the second one. Their fight got a lot of panel time.</br>  <br> C the Compulsory  <br><br>The fuck does that even imply? For some reason I'm expecting it to affect causality somehow combined with telekinesis.</br></br></br>  <br>They could have interesting Völstandings, quadsman.</br>  <br><br>We already saw all their vollstandings though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and jobbing to the main villain is a great way to show off your power up. If they had anything interesting left we would have seen it by now.</br>  <br><br>No you fuck off SJW post 2013 cancerfag.</br></br>  <br><br> tbh <br><br>crossboard cancer kill yourself.<br><br><br><br>Kill yourself faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because people realize how shitty Bleach has been for the past few years.</br>  <br> not liking prepubescent girls makes you a SJW </br>  <br>Just responding to a Shitpost with shitposting. <br><br>Speaking of which </br></br></br>  <br>Compulsory means something that is required by law.<br><br>Notice how Kenpachi only got his arm twisted when he stepped up. Probably has something to do with range. Everything within a certain range of Pernidas is required to twist their arms or some shit.<br><br>Mayuri or Kenpachi are gonna pull some "I never followed the rules anyways" type shtick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In these conditions jobbing is a very subtle way to call it.</br>  <br>Are you still on the bleach dick porky?</br>  <br>I actually wouldn't mind the two of them getting their asses kicked for once, they're both overpowered in their own ways so it's hard to imagine the two of them combined to lose in any way.</br>  <br>If I was Porky I'd be spamming Rukia pics by now</br>  <br>What's more important is that Yhwach likely has access to both G and Z schrifts now.</br>  <br>porky was a rukiafag, despite hating ichiruki. Nadia was the one who kept repeating the same ichihime and orihime bullshit</br>  <br>I don't think he gets the abilities of the sternritter when they die, just their reishi. He's never used any of them and it would be redundant anyways because the Almighty is the best power by far.</br>  <br> porky was a rukiafag, despite hating ichiruki <br><br>what</br></br></br>  <br>Yhawch said in the flashback that Jugram was his other half</br>  <br>Just because he hasn't yet doesn't mean he cant. We'll see if anyone can make him fight seriously. I still suppose he has use for the dead Royal Guard, and may use Zombie to resurrect them.</br>  <br> porky was a rukiafag <br><br>Spot the newfag</br></br></br>  <br>It's literally all the same shit.</br>  GIselle is still alive  Kubo has a hate boner for the 9th division. Kensei, Mashiro, Tousen and Hisagi jobbed endlessly throughout the manga like fodder.  <br>Kirge was a fucking badass, i really liked his Sklaverei power. it's a shame he got split down the middle by Grimmjow.</br>  <br>Never drop your guard in a land of Mexico.</br>  Orihime is a more useful character than Rukia. Her power is to reject anything, even injuries or faults in an object. Hence why Aizen wanted her for repairing the Hogyoku.<br><br>Rukia is a watered down version of Hitsugaya<br><br>Checkmate atheists</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would have liked to see Kirge in SS, just to see what kind of fuckery he could get up to with Sklaverei, in a world composed of Reishi. It would have been magnificent.</br>  <br>They are the Oblivion division. They might as well be the Jobber division.<br><br>3rd division gets shit on the most though. Marigold = despair. RIP Gin, RIP Kira.</br></br></br>  <br> Hence why Aizen wanted her for repairing the Hogyoku <br>But he didn't want her for repairing the Hougyoku.</br></br>  <br>They both have an equal amount of holes.</br>  <br>ALWAYS MANGASTREAM</br>  and why is it Princess Tutu?  <br>It was at its core a monster of the week series about the cards, you can't just cut on the cards.</br>  <br><br>It was perfect, I loved every episode, it could have been extended by 70.</br></br>  <br>I remember trying to rewatch it a few years back and I just got really depressed.</br>  <br> purincesu chuchu </br>  <br>They added more cards compared to the manga.</br>  Is Planetes the greatest love story ever told?  <br> <br>A contender.</br></br>  <br>I finished it this morning. I was really happy when I thought Tanabe was gonna take it.<br><br><br>Moot has great taste.<br><br><br>One thing I really liked is that every character is fleshed out, even the joke characters. It was pretty great</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you're a psychopath and should seek psychiatric help immediately.</br>  <br> greatest love story ever told? <br><br>nope, but a great story about getting shit done.<br>who else here loves this magnificent bastard?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The recovery thing was a bit weak, but I am willing to admit I would have been entirely too goddamn upset if it was irreversible</br></br>  why is Carla so fuckable but at the same time not because she has Eren's face?<br><br>i'm so confused.<br><br>also let's talk about the latest chapter and what you think happens in the next one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, he already gave birth. See </br>  <br>Kek.</br>   Hiana is a single mother who joined the SL because they'd give her child financial support. <br> she's afraid that she will die in battle <br> after Eren and Mikasa get separated she tries to seduce Eren and tries to make him promise to be a father to her child <br> In the end she ends up being eaten </br></br></br>  <br>The fuck?</br>  <br>So movie Eren is going to raise some woman's baby and movie Mikasa is going to be fucking OC manlet?</br>  Hey. Dumping an ongoing scanlation that was adapted into a live-action movie.<br><br> Azumi focuses upon the life of the titular young female assassin. The manga begins an indeterminate number of years after the Battle of Sekigahara. <br><br> As Azumi begins her duty, the manga introduces its characters into mainstream history. Many of the early missions that Azumi undertakes are the assassinations of the prominent supporters and generals of the Toyotomi Clan, against whom Tokugawa Ieyasu expected to again go to war. The manga 'reveals' that many of the Toyotomi leaders who conveniently died of diseases or accidents prior to the final confrontation between the Toyotomi and Tokugawa were actually victims of assassinations by Azumi and her comrades, thus indicating to the reader when the events were taking place. <br><br> Note: Won an Excellence Prize at the 1997 Japan Media Arts Festival and the Shogakukan Manga Award in 1998. </br></br></br></br></br></br>      </blockquote>]
