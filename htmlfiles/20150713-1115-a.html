Swimsuits? Tits out? Most figures are a bit lewd.</br></br>  <br>I don't think swimsuit figures are lewd in generally, unless they're presenting.<br><br>But they usually get filtered by the boringness threshold anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok mom, but can you please stop insulting my Pochaco collection, shes not fat just horizontally challenged and I like that.</br>  <br>I'm so fucking sick of hair seams</br>  <br> oppai mousepads any worse than figs. </br>  <br>Get good at garage kits.</br>  <br>Imagine all the great figures that could have been bought with that money instead of that fat garbage</br>  <br>Who dis?</br>  <br>YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE</br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>They all are.</br>  <br>Rize is best tho. <br><br>She will be the one to return us Ken Kaneki, haise will die when he meets Rize.</br></br></br>  <br>Also Hinami's body makes me hard in that pic</br>  <br>How could anyone like any girl over the paragon of sexy-cute that is Touka?</br>  <br>When was the last time we even saw Rize? Like chapter 100ish right? I forget she even exists half the time at this point</br>  <br>That Touka</br>  <br>I forgot Touka exist because she's fucking irrelevant</br>  <br>The last we saw her she was tied up in Yomo's container. Kaneki tried talking to her but she ignored him and went psycho bonkers.</br>  <br>We've already discussed the last chapter. There's no need for new threads, anon.<br><br><br> She will be the one to return us Ken Kaneki. <br> I do believe it. Rize and Amon will trigger Kaneki and he will be finally back </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rize will be the last one. <br><br>He will just see her and go insane. He'll have to fight Amon or talk to remember</br></br></br>  <br>The thread got deleted for some reason though.</br>  <br>Why not? thread got pruned in 100 posts. Is there a rule somewhere that forbids more than 1 TG thread? <br><br><br>Reminder that seeing Touka did shit to Haise</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that Yoriko is a waifu tier and the future mother of Kuroiwa quality genes, she is going to be more relevant than Touka.</br>  <br>Since that Christmas chapter things are pretty dead, here.</br>  Which boy is best boy?  Jo.  It's out of the MC and glasses <br>  shin is the worst, he's the biggest traitor there is  <br> Andre even if he's insane right now he has shown he will switch loyalty easily for a female  <br>  and joe was going gay for a moment, like it's cool to be gay and shit but no nigga wants his friend to become gay and start liking him <br> glasses is a true bro since day one  <br>  and MC is a true bro </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MC or Glasses<br><br>everyone else is S H I T</br></br></br>  <br>1. Kiyoshi<br>2. Gakuto<br>3. Andre<br>4. Jo<br>5. shitgo</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This</br>  Chairman is best boy  Why is the adaptation so impressively bad?    <br>Jofag detected</br>  <br>It's legitimately hard to choose between them except for Shingo because he's shit.<br>But I'm gonna go with  the chairman. </br></br>  Threadly reminder that Hana is the best girl.  <br><br>overrated girl</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you understand what the word "overrated" means.<br>She's perfect.</br></br>  <br><br> hana <br> perfect <br><br>now that's a good joke</br></br></br></br></br>  make way for best girl<br>  she need some eyebrows tho  </br>  <br>It's not. Mangafags just set their expectations too high and don't understand pacing in a manga will differ when it's translated to animation.<br><br>The only bad thing is the shitty airbrush effect they have going on. It's ugly as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> hana <br><br>thats a funny way to say meiko</br></br></br>  <br>what is bad about it?</br>  Andre<br><br> mfw he might not even be relevant in this cour </br></br>  <br>I don't think so.</br>  Gakuto. My friend and I began referring to each other as anon-dono after reading the manga.<br><br>Any fan of ROTTK must be a good person.</br></br>  <br>I'll never understand why people like her, she has absolutely no appeal except for cowtits.<br><br>She hasn't kissed a boy, but she has eaten pussy. A+</br></br></br>  <br><br>So in a way similar to that of Jo and Gakuto, you two became faggots?</br></br>  <br> Any fan of ROTTK must be a good person. <br>This</br></br>   Tfw I know a 1:1 Hana in real life <br> I still haven't seen her take a piss </br>  <br>They're all shit<br>Like really, really shit<br>Hana is best boy</br></br></br>  I'm going to wait for the uncensored rips. Anyone else?  The one thing I like about the anime is Gakuto's colorful manner of speech<br>It doesn't translate that well into English and hearing it is quite amusing.</br>  <br>Is there a group doing that? Or are you talking about the BDs?</br>  <br>One day anon-kun. Have faith.</br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  <br>the BD's.</br>  <br> no appeal <br>I like her because she's airheaded, loyal, and surprisingly innocent. Her sadistic tendencies are just her weird way of approaching things, she doesn't do it because she derives pleasure from it like a true sadist.</br></br>  <br> <br>Part of what made the manga work too, though, was the contrast between how absurd it was, and how serious it was drawn. It doesn't look like that animated - it's bog-standard.<br> <br>That wasn't even a thing that doesn't translate well. The studio just decided it didn't need to do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of the things you're saying are such a stretch.<br>I mean, she's innocent? Really?</br></br>  <br>Innocent in the sense that her mind is really straightforward. <br>Like, remember the escape arc, how they just challenged her to buy time and she agreed right away? She didn't even consider they had an ulterior motive and just wanted to show off her strength. She's mentally just an oversized kid, ergo, innocent in mind.</br></br>  <br> <br>At heart she kinda is really.<br> <br>Though some of the things she does in her right mind don't jive like that. I think it was more a case of the artist doing one thing at first and then going "you know that'd be cool if it was actually like THAT" later.</br></br></br></br>  I'm not sure how the manga will end, all I know is that a harem end would be the absolute worst.  <br>Good thing you're not reading a harem.</br>  <br>How could it even be a harem end? Only Hana and Chiyo have had development with Kiyoshi, every other girl's been hitting it off with the other guys.</br>  <br> <br>I'd end it with everyone expelled and walking off into the sunset in seperate groups, western-style.<br> <br>Even the principal, who'd get the last walking away from campus scene, dreaming of the next ass waiting for him, somewhere on the hori-<br> <br>ZON.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> every other girl's been hitting it off with the other guys. <br>and other girls if you know what i mean</br></br>  <br>Mari wants to go on a date with Kiyoshi. That's three girls.</br>  <br>This is no harem. This is ending on the chairman taking the boys on a south american field trip.</br>  <br>She doesnt want to, she just agreed to it while thinking of something else. The date isnt even a fucking thing, if you read it again in previous chapters kiyoshi says "Us boys will take you girls to eat yakkiniku" its not a fucking 1:1 thing like you retarded shippers think.</br>  <br>Make the chance, bro. Make it happen. Do it for the ASS </br>  <br>What? It's pretty evident you lack reading comprehension.<br>Go reread that chapter again.</br></br>  <br>She doesnt seem the slightest bit interested.</br>  <br> We should all go out and eat </br>   tfw meiko/mari ending isnt very likely <br><br>why even live</br></br>  <br>I forgot facial expressions didn't display emotions, my bad.<br>I knew I was missing something.<br><br>Who knows, her devotion to the president may push her to the edge. It might happen, all you can do is wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What he means is there is no "date" because its a group thing. There is literally no romantic development built anywhere around the two that suggests the two would ever just go themselves, it would be completely out of character especially when kiyoshi is obsessed with his ideal and them being sisters and all. Theres also the hana shenanigans he never denies and recently opened up his soul to.</br>  <br>Whos to say? Theyve been close since kids.</br>  <br> hana shenanigans <br>I wonder when Chiyo will confront Hana, she obviously knows something is going on between them.<br><br>That'll be fun.</br></br></br></br>  That feel when this garbage gets an adaptation while Ore to Akuma no Blues will never get finished.  <br> chairman taking the boys on a south american field trip. <br>Man, I never thought I wanted this so badly. Hiramoto must deliver it. Please.</br></br>  <br>She doesnt really have anything to confront hana about yet other than "why would hana take kiyoshis headband in that manner and thank me for both of them". Maybe the suspicious throw off call when they almost found the two under the futon as well. Chiyo can't be as stupid as shes written so far at least i hope not.</br>  <br> Devil blues fags still butthurt </br>  <br>Chiyo has absolutely no depth to her character. The only thing we know is that she likes Sumo. That's it. <br><br>Her confronting either Hana or Kiyoshi would be the most interesting thing her character has done in the entire manga.</br></br></br>  <br>The only thing bad about the adaptation is the animation, which in turn is only noticeably bad because the coloring is so fucking terrible</br>  <br><br> waiting for BDs </br></br>  <br>Also related. She definitely knows something is up.</br>  <br>I.... Agree!<br><br>Although you forgot the best..... MAN</br></br></br>   Everyone is saying the adoption is shit <br> I wouldn't know since I don't read manga <br> Having a good time for the Anime <br><br>I might actually watch it per week since It was so fucking funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br>not</br>  I've been thinking about getting into this, whether or not by anime or manga. Could someone give me the run down on it? I don't think I can stomach another beta male/dominatrix story.  <br> i dont read manga <br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone is saying the adoption is shit <br> the adoption </br></br>  Didn't entirely know what to expect, but is the manga basically like this too? It doesn't really seem all that good. I was expecting the greatest thing ever and got nothing near it.  <br>do it</br>  Man this show and manga are shit why do people like it again?  <br>Where do I go to cut myself on Joe's edge?</br>  <br>Gokuto</br>  <br>double 6s, the gets of a man with a taste for shit.<br>Shit taste confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Read the manga. The art is prolly one of the best out there. The best thing about Prison school is the comedy though. And holy shit is it good. Also the boys become fucking men after a while (not in the early chapters).</br>  Holy shit that was a terrible first episode.<br><br>I thought that copy pasta about girls beating the shit out of you while spitting in your mouth and calling you worthless was a joke.</br></br>  <br> I was expecting the greatest thing ever <br>Why would you ever expect that?</br></br>  <br>They´re all great. Kiyoshi/Gakuto/Joe overall. Andre during the economics chapters. And Shingo ... i used to like him until the  betrayal . Still want him to get with Anzu though.</br>  <br>What do you mean? The comedy is so fucking good in this. I rarely get to laugh this hard at manga... well maybe except for GTO.</br>  <br>I heard the sick one is gay. Is it true?</br>  <br>Always Kiyoshi.</br>   mangafags in denial everything is actually good in the manga   <br>who is this Pussy Destroyer?</br>  <br>Joe ? He has an ... err confusing episode with Gakuto. He does like girls too. And i think he was just interested because he doesn´t usually get intimate contact due to his sickness/shyness. </br>  <br>That cover tricked me into thinking that it's about highschool bros being badass</br>  <br>Well they are in a highschool. And Kiyoshi is pretty badass. And he has several bros.<br><br>Kiyoshi,  proud disciple of assMAN </br></br></br>  Is this a mananime?  Kiyoshi is a motherfucking G<br><br>The manga is full of fucking bro moments. Seriously. Gakuto makes I &lt;3 Wet T Shirt Contest Shirts to signify the reassembly of the Wolfpack in the later chapters.</br></br>  Why must no anime air uncensored these days?  <br>True. So many fucking pages I saved from just how absurd and funny they were.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi starts off as a massive unlikeable shit and becomes a fucking man. 10/10 character development, best boy.</br>  <br>Kek I read walking as wanking</br>   watch first episode <br> love it <br> check on /a/ <br> general disdain <br>Shit, was it the wonky light beams or just overhype for manga-tier art? I fucking loved the VAs and exaggerated SFX</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/a/ hates prison school because /a/ hates femdom.<br><br>femdom is pretty shitty fetish, and its' apparent that most of /a/ agrees with me here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Plastic water bottles will never be the same again.</br>  I wonder how the anime will adapt the hand holding scene.<br><br>That was one of the best non-lewd lewd moments in the manga.</br></br>  <br>Like shit.<br><br>I want them to adapt the Mari body search scene already.</br></br></br>  <br> wonky light beams <br>Unacceptable.</br></br>  <br>Dont listen to this shithead troll <br>There's only two reasons, one beeing the light beams (they dont even make sense because we still get pantyshots) and 2nd, the pacing. In that chapter alone they merged like 6 manga chapters and, of course, ran past many hilarous moments. To the manga readers, the pacing is way too rushed.</br></br>  <br>Don't get your hopes too high. They really like skipping moments.<br><br>There are some things that they hopefully won't, but who knows at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for saying literally, otherwise I might have thought you mean there is figuratively no romantic development built anywhere around the two that suggests the two would ever just go themselves, it would be completely out of character especially when kiyoshi is obsessed with his ideal and them being sisters and all. Theres also the hana shenanigans he never denies and recently opened up his soul to.</br>  <br>The pacing did feel swift as fuck to me, but what was skipped specifically? I can probably reread it since I love it, but might as well ask first</br>   that fucking scene where   chiyo becomes a slut and kiyoshi debates on whether to grope her boobs or not, with detailed illustrations on the right to fondle boobs, the technique, and mindset <br><br>truly, a man's anime. also, mari is exceedingly hot in the later chapters of the manga, if you're not blinded by cow tits.</br></br>  <br>As long as they don't skip the three or four moments between Hana and Kiyoshi we'll be fine.<br><br>Realistically, you can't fit all of the moments in the manga into the anime. I know that they've missed some shit, but I feel like they were able to establish the premise well.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't find Meiko attractive at all. She's gross.<br><br>I don't exactly remember the point where Mari was drawn to seem attractive, but that was a good decision. Her eating out Kate is A+.</br></br></br>  <br>there are so many fucking good moments and asspulls in the manga</br>  Is this confirmed one cour? Seems way too fast to be two if they're planning on covering the main arc.<br><br>Although I'll be satisfied as long as the water bottle scene gets well adapted either way.</br></br>  <br> there will never be a full anime adapation of this glorious manga </br>  <br>Which water bottle scene? There's many.</br>  <br>My nigga</br>  <br>The first one, right? With  Hana? <br><br>Or is there one before that?</br></br></br>  <br>We have prison school threads weekly and they're nice, I don't understand this backlash after the anime was released.</br>  <br>So has JC Staff gotten their shit together, or is Prison School terrible?</br>  <br>Oh okay. I agree, I really hope they do that scene well. All of the Kiyoshi and Hana scenes in the manga are really enjoyable.<br><br>There's a bunch of dumb shit that the other four guys do with plastic bottles. There was also Shingo trying to kiss Anzu with Kiyoshi's water bottle advice.</br></br></br>  <br>I read the manga and my expectations were lowered by the opninions of these fags. I surprisingly liked the first episode a lot. Of course the manga is still better but it's not an awful adaptation.</br>  <br>I that really all there is to this then? Goofy slapstick and bro-ness?</br>  <br>There's actually some decent romance involved. It isn't all just that one cow tits girl.<br><br>Furthermore, this manga is surprisingly good at suspense. It's surprising given the context.</br></br></br>  i should go back at reading this<br>i stopped at Chiyol turning into a slut</br>   that Kamiya fag voicing my husband <br>The lord is surely testing me</br>  <br>You just need to get past that. It's one of the low moments in the manga, it picks back up after that.</br>  <br>I stopped there too even though it was the hottest part apart from Anzu. I blame the lack of downloads though.</br>  <br> kiyoshi <br> bro <br>He has literally never shown to actually care about his friends and always do things for his own gain.</br></br></br>   tfw the plans executed in this manga are jojo-tier levels of asspulls and logic   <br> &gt;USC's escape from prison <br> &gt;tfw ASC's president was an underwear thief all along, so that's why Mari texted the french word for thief </br></br>  <br>More like hardcore psycho tsuntsun, bitch was crazy from childhood.</br>  Holy fuck this episode, I didn't have so many boners with anime since...I don't even know.<br>Finally, some femdom in anime. Last I remember of was MM!, but it was barely ok.</br>  <br>But...but that scene. That fucking scene. You know the scene.<br><br>I fapped to that scene so many times.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, I think it may actually be fun to anyone that's not even in femdom.</br>  <br>You should subscribe to andrenomics.</br>  <br>You must invest diligently in the wall street of masochism.</br>  <br>You can't even begin to imagine how much.</br>  I thought this would be something more serious from the artstyle of the pages posted in the past.    <br>That was the scene where Mari became best, and most perfect girl.<br><br>Shit gets serious.<br><br>Like, melodramatic-funny serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, Prison School is one big fucking hype semen fest, fuck.<br><br>Mari is truly a rusemaster.</br></br></br>  <br> she uses the concept of MAD to ensure equal footing in a school contest <br><br>brilliant</br></br></br>  Should I watch this? I'm too scared that they butchered the source material.  <br> You'll never get the high paying job you deserve with your masters degree in andrenomics. </br>   kanahana is voicing hana <br> tfw kanahana is gonna do lewd things all season <br><br>my dick is ready</br></br></br>  <br>She's already doing. The pissing scene was great. I don't really like her but actually she was a good choice for the role.</br>  So, how many of you actually seen a real domina?  Still don't get why Kiyoshi got so depressed about being pissed on by Hana. If I were him, I'd drink Hana's piss by the gallons.     PBR-sama isn't in the opening   <br>Joe tbh</br>  <br> canonically ugly <br> best girl </br></br>  <br><br>Directly?</br></br>  <br> tbh </br>   rape doujins <br><br>my dick cant wait</br></br>  <br>stop this forced meme</br>  Okay everyone I need all your attention right now please! <br><br>Will this be uncensored now or will I have to wait for the DVDs?! I want to know! I haven't readed the mangas yet though but I intend to! Hehe ;-)</br></br>   meant for   Mangafag here<br>The adaptation is pretty good so far. I hope it will get to the end of the first half of the manga without skipping too much.<br>If you expected it not to be censored you're a fucking idiot. Who reads prison school for the boobs?</br></br>  <br>Irl Kiyoshis.<br>Jokes aside, all I want is the Meiko interrogating Anzu scene to be animated. I spilled the most milk to that in the entire manga.</br></br>  has it aired on at-x so far so we can know if it'll be censored there too?  <br>CENSORED until BD.</br>  Why did Gakuto show up in meiko's flashback is the author trying to ship them together? Was it just coincidence?  <br>is this your speculation or it aired on at-x already and we saw lightbeams?</br>  <br>just because shimoneta is uncensored on at-x doesnt mean everything is anon</br>  <br><br> not seeing the beauty in her heart </br></br>  <br>Is asking for a direct "No, it hasn't aired on at-x yet, but don't get your hopes up" too much?<br>I checked the usual place though, no at-x raws, I assume it didn't air there yet.</br></br>  <br>You should beg for it if you want that sort of answer from me.</br>  <br>You can act tough all you want, we all know how you'll end.</br>  What's wrong with his face?  <br>He's focusing very hard.</br>  How will they handle this scene?  So I'm kind of new to this series. Should I read the manga first, or could I get away with watching the anime without reading the manga?<br>Since the manga has so damn many chapters, my plan was to watch/read at the same time.</br>  <br>He probably took his mask off</br>  <br>avoid anime, read manga.<br>second arc is much better anyway.</br></br>  <br>Read the manga. Took me a day or two.</br>  <br><br>The main reason I haven't read the manga yet (other than being 180+ chapters long) is because after skimming the first few chapters, the translation comes across as kind of awkward. It... it gets better, right?</br></br>  <br>It's just summerfags and animeonlyfags shitting everything up.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with the TL, what release did you read? Also, if the style gets you hooked, you will blaze through the manga pretty quick. And you will wish there was more.</br>  <br>I was reading whatever version is on Kissmanga. The dialogue in the first few chapters comes across as slightly awkward, but from a quick glance ahead, it seems like it gets better. The art style is fucking amazing, though.<br><br>I've started the first episode of the anime, but once I'm done, my plan is to read as much of the manga as I can each week, and watch the anime episodes as they air.</br></br></br>  <br> Kissmanga </br>  <br>Any suggestions for what websites are better, then?</br>  <br>I downloaded the chapters and didn't notice any issue or change in the translation. Maybe stop streaming manga.</br>  <br>I'm just paranoid about downloading stuff because I'm worried that one day I'll forget to hide the chapters on my disk and somebody will see them if they borrow my computer.<br><br>But yeah, the translation seems to get better as early in as chapter 5. I guess the kind of awkward, stilted dialogue was just some early-installment weirdness. Gonna start reading the manga now.</br></br></br>  <br>Pic related is some of the awkward dialogue I was talking about. It seems to be this way in every version of the first chapter on every website I could find.</br>  <br><br>Jesus fucking Christ, are you a 12-year old Mormon?</br></br>  <br>No, but I use my computer for work stuff and people have borrowed it before, and I have been known to be forgetful sometimes.</br>  <br><br>That's one hell of a character transformation.</br></br>  How did we go from this<br><br><br>to this?<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Prison does things to a man</br>  What is this show even trying to be?  <br><br>Ecchi comedy.</br></br>  Tell us here when uncensored version come out.  <br>nah, he goes back pretty quickly<br>is just an act, he has a mental breakdown after he finds out he kept his strong facade act too long and without any real reason</br></br>  <br>Romance, School Life</br>  <br><br>One man's attempt to show his contempt for the current state of the industry. It still ended up being pretty entertaining.</br></br>  <br> romance </br>  <br><br>my nigga</br></br>  I've made up to about vol 13, and I need to know whether Drill-hair Eyelashes features prominently in the later chapter.<br><br>Help a brother out anons.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12797554 <br>Certainly not enough screentime for her. Which is a shame. My dick riots every time.</br>  <br> Not Romance </br>  is there are a digital version for the yen press Prison school?  man the bd is going to be great  <br>No problem.</br>  <br> Animeonlyfags  <br>"Wow this looks like it is going to be a fun show!"<br><br> Mangafags <br>"SHIT!<br>ITS SHIT!<br>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It kinda makes me mad how accurate this prediction is even though it's just a joke</br>    <br><br><br>Please spoiler this shit</br></br></br>  <br>Altair</br>  <br>Sucks that its true</br>  <br>Light dies</br>  This pissed me off so much. Where are the gainz jo? Where are the fucking gainz.  <br>Gainz are harder when you have an illness.</br>  <br>Don't judge him by his appearance, Anon.</br>  Non funi subs where   there are people that think this isn't the cutest creature in existence   <br><br>I don't like sumo wresting, so she's shit.</br></br>  <br>the only trues bros is Kiyoshi and Gakuto since day fucking one</br>  <br>Wasnt there an instance where kiyoshi wanted to kill gakuto or was it someone else</br>  <br>If your problem is the video quality/font, you can use Senketsu Subs funi ripped subs with the RAW. If you have a problem with the translation, then I can't help you.</br>  <br>Yeah, Gakuto said there were only 4 of them, trying to cover for Kiyoshi. Gakuto is best bro.</br>  <br>Yeah there was. Kiyoshi and Hana have a lot in common.</br>  Okay, as of now HanaKana isn't pure anymore.  <br>the bloody chunks he been hacking out are his gainz</br>   tw reading this expecting some heavy fanservice <br> actually read it <br> cant even fap because of my sides leaving orbit <br> cant even fap on how much of a true bro Gakuto is <br> so much bro moments that i forgot about the fanservice thing <br> tfw the unlikeable shit Kiyoshi becomes a true man <br><br> tfw all i got is a story about bros helping out each other </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. I mean who fucking ruins his entire school life just for your bro to get that sumo date?</br>  <br>Like what?</br>  <br>Well he only did it because he had something in it for him as well which was the figurine. The breaking of the figurine though was pure bro glory.</br>  <br> I wonder how the anime will adapt the hand holding scene. <br>That's the second arc. It won't get there. We'll get kiss kiss bang bang though.</br></br>  <br>An extremely rushed kiss kiss bang bang. This is not ok.</br>  <br>Maybe they are 'rushing' for those scenes?</br>  <br>That scene was almost as good. All of the scenes between Hana and Kiyoshi are good.<br><br>I don't know, Japan loves Hana, maybe we'll get a somewhat decent interaction.</br></br></br>  <br>We can only hope it reaches where we think it will, boys release.</br>  <br> Hanakane will say things like "Piss on me!" <br>Suddenly it got a lot more hotter here.</br></br>  <br>What's even more awesome is that the mushroom scene comes after that one.</br>  <br>I really, really hope that this gets to be animated one day. I would love to see how bad it gets censored.</br>  have any sjws hated on the anime yet? im expecting tumblr to go all out against it.  Is 80% of the manga chapters still Google Translated or are there proper translations?  <br><br> not knowing about jo the bro <br><br><br><br>why would you care in the first place?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Caring what pieces of shit like SJW think is what got them where they are now.</br>  Why is Shitgo such shit?  <br>Definitely NOT Andre<br><br>Fuck that backstabbing bitch. I want him to suffer</br></br></br>  So I've read the first few chapters of the manga and watched the first episode of the anime. Honestly I did not expect to laugh as much as I did. Those facial expressions are hilarious.<br><br>The art style is amazing and definitely different from most other manga I've read/anime I've watched, and I really like it.<br><br>Also, since I don't know much about these threads since I've never been in them before, would too many people hate me if I said Meiko is best USC girl?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meiko gets much better after her backstory.<br><br>Still not the best girl though.</br></br></br>  <br><br> would too many people hate me if I said Meiko is best USC girl <br><br>Maybe some of the more rabid Hanafags, but they are in the minority.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They eventually get pretty badass. At least Kiyoshi and Gakuto.</br>   <br>I doubt his brain is functioning enough to think about backstabbing. He is more like a animal than run from place to place</br>  <br>He will suffer.<br>But he'll love it.</br></br>  <br>Andre was a mistake</br>  <br>My thoughts on the USC so far:<br>Hana scares me and I wouldn't be surprised if she gets even creepier than she already is as the story goes on, but I'm expecting there to be some really neat character development<br><br>Mari is actually pretty fucking cool. She trains crows to work as her spies. That's some LotR level shit right there.<br><br>Meiko is best girl in my opinion. White hair + glasses + good god damn that chest + sadist + me being a complete sub = holy hell please step on me meiko</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can you even consider a self-admitted misandrist as anything but the lowest of low, below turd level?<br><br>You're right on the other two though and Hana gets a little development.<br><br><br><br>stay mad, andre is the only man among the group</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have a terrible way of determining good characters and i have a feeling i know which tripfag you are.</br>  <br>Personally Hana is my favorite girl but Meiko is fucking top-tier. Too bad she's ruined in the latter part of the manga.</br>  <br>I don't really know enough about Meiko to have any idea if she's a good character or not, I'm just saying she's hot.<br><br>Honestly, so far Hana seems like the most interesting character for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>mari is a terrible character and i doubt it will change, seems set up to be the obviously evil character that everyone eventually works against<br><br>im probably really wrong though i havent read the manga</br></br></br></br>  <br>meiko, aside from providing top tier fanservice is really lame at first, she only has any depth as character after her backstory is shown</br>  <br>see you in a few months then</br>  <br> implying <br>Kiyoshi only does things when he has his own personal gain and constantly lied to all of them out of his ass ,he's by far the most detached from the group.</br></br>   All these mangafags crying about pacing <br><br>God forbid an anime keeps your attention and gets the fuck on with it. There are so many times while watching a show that it feels like forever for the episode to be over with needlessly drawn out scenes so they can save on animation. I like fast paced shows because it doesn't treat the audience like they are retarded 5 year olds that need a solid 20 seconds of a scene to get the point across that "he's angry" or "this bad guy is bad" or something.</br></br>  <br>thanks for taking your trip off</br>  <br>I wasn't saying her backstory ruined her, but her progression back to Moeko. I want best Meiko back.</br>  <br>Im a mangafag and share your sentiment.</br>  <br> mari is a terrible character and i doubt it will change, seems set up to be the obviously evil character that everyone eventually works against <br><br>That's literally the opposite of what happens</br></br></br>  <br>mari is handled in a really lame way.<br>when the usc  gets defeated by the boys  she doesn't suffer at all, she doesn't get her face rubbed in the mud, all she has done don't blow up in her face.<br><br>she  gets in prison, but not under the boys order, under a different girl prez and now the boys work with her against the new one .<br><br>the problem is, the narrative starts portraying her as , not exactly more sympathetic, but less of a "hate target", without any development from her part it's just, "well new arc now, we change villains"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lets just say evil meets evil and one will seem less evil</br>  <br><br>how is meiko ruined?</br></br>  <br> Moeko <br> Not ruined <br>Meiko was just a massive fanservice character but she always had her moments. Moeko is pure shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>does sound lame tbh</br></br>  <br>See <br><br><br>That's the funny part. Eventually you begin to think man, this new arc sucks ass, I miss the old times back with Meiko and the USC. It's like fucking Stockholm syndrome.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I like fast paced shows because it doesn't treat the audience like they are retarded 5 year olds that need a solid 20 seconds of a scene to get the point across that "he's angry" or "this bad guy is bad" or something. <br>Are you retarded? That's not the point at all, that's what you call proper directing, generating tension and atmosphere. Prison School isn't just a gag which is what the anime tries it to be, it's supposed to be a parody, but with how quick everything goes by, that entire aspect of the manga is lost.</br></br>  <br><br>it was a legit question i dont know what happens</br></br>  <br>You'll have to read and find out.</br>  <br>That's you.<br>I think, man, where will we reach glorious boy council era and mandatory usc-in-prison like uniforms for all female students.<br><br>Jokes  wasn't really joking  aside, I like the new arc, in total, more than the first.<br>I kinda dislike the whole "boys getting beating by girls" gig, it's kinda cringey, I admit the way mari is handled in second arc is lame and moeko has gotten boring -early 2nd arc meiko was awesome though-, but on average, the rest of the arc is better than the first. It doesn't have the ass-talk, okay, but it developed the characters more, had great tension moments and the pbr-medusa talk was hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but less of a "hate target" <br>Well in recent developments the trigger for meikos return is mari getting hurt in some way and the boys plan to harass the fuck out of her.</br></br>  <br>Meiko will awaken when andre gets on mari.<br>I just hope he spends some panels, or a chapter mauling her first, before she awakens.<br>And I meant "hate" target is an, villain, from the audience's perspective. The boys were always perverts, they value t-shirt contest above everything, it makes sense they'd work with her  sort of . But narrative-wise, especially if you take into account how she treated meiko in the first arc, the way she's portrayed feels a bit like a glove two sizes bigger and with one less finger.</br></br></br>  <br> Prison School isn't just a gag <br>Hey man, I like funny shows. Shoot me.</br></br>  <br> I kinda dislike the whole "boys getting beating by girls" gig <br>Didn't find it that funny either but there were still a lot of great scenes, with the Chairman like you mentioned, and also Hana. Not to mention the whole sense of camaraderie between the male prisoners. They've been feeling more disjointed until recently. For me, the second half on the manga has been pretty slow. There are still some great moments (Mari/Kate, Andrenomics) but it feels like they are few and far in between instead of being consistently entertaining like the first half on the manga.<br><br>I guess I'm the only one who got indignant at the new Student Council for taking the place of the USC. No fucking wet t-shirt contest? Get the fuck outta here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a feeling the wet-tshirt contest is a complete lie or different from what the boys expect and there will be absolute insanity when they get to it.</br>  <br>The only people that prefer the second half of the manga are Hanashippers and 14 year olds that think the Mari/Kate scene is the 'OMG HOTTEST THING EVER"</br>  <br>And "clamming" which is kates event is actually the dirty version and more in line with what the boys would want</br>  <br> not liking Andrenomics and their fall <br> not liking early PBR antics <br> not liking Joe's romance with Gakuto <br> not liking Ouroboros <br>I still prefer the first arc, but the second half has had plenty of good shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's how things will be.<br><br>No one of the two councils will win the battle.<br>We'll have a chiyo "let's all get along" council with members from each previous council, logically meiko and risa, possible one boy too.<br>Most likely both tapes/photos will be revealed so the new arc will have Kate, Mari and Kiyoshi in prison. Possible Hana too if 69 piss gets revealed as well. <br>This will be the time for chiyo to show her psycho side too, because let's not kid ourselves, no one in that family is sane.<br>Also, the meiko/risa/andre thing will be dealt with too, since meiko and risa will be in the council.<br><br>Boy council will be the final one, when the realise the wet-t-shirt contest isn't what they thing it is so they'll have to become council to institutionalise it.<br> This is totally how it'll go. I'm certain. PS is a very predictable manga after all, we were all sure chiyo would see hana wearing those panties in the battle and that totally worked out </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There have been shippers from the start. Second arc isnt bad.</br>  <br>Is it ok to prefer the second arc for a)best girl risa and b) not really liking the "guys abused by girls" pseudojoke ?</br>  <br><br>Ouroboros wasn't that funny in my opinion.</br></br>  Wow, these threads really went to shit with the release of the anime.  <br> not liking early PBR antics <br>It wasn't that funny.</br></br>  <br><br>Please note that I never said the second half is bad, just that the first half is better. Andrenomics is by far the funniest shit that's happened in the manga so far.<br><br>Although I might be a bit biased since Meiko is my favorite and the second half of the story has completely ruined her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why hanafags would like 2nd arc unless they're stupid.<br>hana got literally declared as "at least she's not shit" by the mc</br></br>  <br>No he didnt, thats your retarded way of interpreting it. MC doesnt even realize shingo and gakuto pissed all over each other and werent bitches about it.</br>  <br>I agree. When reading the second part it was still funny but it's felt like the entire second part is the set up for the next real part of the story but it just hasn't came. I thought they'd go real prison or something and go back to their roots.</br>  <br>How is it a retarded way of interpreting it?<br>He said getting peed on sucks, but at least it's not shit.<br>Getting to pee on him was what hana was always trying to do.<br>And how are gakuto and shingo relevant in this? Just because they were fine with it, it doesn't mean he has to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he calls his friends "pure" without even knowing the shit theyve done just like he holds the ideal of chiyo without even actually knowing her. This is a comedy afterall and all the events have been intertwined in some way.</br>  <br>Calling them pure is false, sure, but he wasn't being a bitched simply because he didn't like getting peed on.<br>Was hana a bitch for not liking to get peed on? or seen peeing?</br></br>  <br> Hana scares me <br> <br>I don't see why.</br></br></br>    what ever happened to Mari and her crow powers?  <br>Yes he was being a bitch. So much so that he tried to change the winning prize of their little bra color game into the winner pissing on the loser because he wanted to lower them to his level of supposed corruption so he doesnt have to feel as bad. Thats selfish as fuck.</br>  <br>So he wanted to pee on others to feel better about himself getting peed on.<br>Like Hana.<br>I see.<br>Also, you're obviously trolling, he was just in a state of shock and mumbling,his mind was full of urine so he was talking about it, you have no evidence he'd actually go through with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hana only wanted to pee on him to get back at HIM. Kiyoshi's was far more sinister as he was involving innocent people.</br>  <br>Hana peed on the perpetrator, not other people. And you can't even compare it because it all started with more than just pee, hes seen every inch of her multiple times to the point he names parts of her and had his dick right on her. He didnt mumble the winning offer to the boys you're just in denial.</br>  <br> just in denial. </br>  <br> you have no evidence he'd actually go through with it. <br> Didnt read the chapter </br></br>  <br><br>Didn't you guys get the memo?<br>"Timmy did it first" stops being an argument after you leave kindergarten.</br></br></br>  <br> reactionimage.jpg <br><br>As expected, and you called me the troll.</br></br></br>  <br>Konata guy is not <br>me</br></br>  <br> hana shippers <br>Anon, just because she has the best scenes in the manga and the dynamic between her and the MC is the best doesn't make people who point that out Hanashippers.</br></br>  So is it confirmed 12 episodes?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>This. They act exactly like two hormone-driven teenagers would around each other. You can hate it for shipping reasons (which is pretty dumb), but their relationship is pretty good for what its' supposed to be.</br></br>  <br>nah, sorry, I can never see "tsundere being pushy and confused to her romantic interest" as good dynamic.</br>  <br><br>So basically they're ending with their pardon/release. And then we wait for the bluerays.</br></br>  <br> sfx: anorexic body! <br>what?</br></br>  <br> he doesn't know the sound of anorexia </br>  <br>Gakuto<br><br>That nigga suffered the most for his bros<br>He shitted himself for a his friend to get his figure that he broke later on amd to get a sumo date for his bro<br>He planned most of the shit <br><br>and all he get is nothing<br><br>They dont deserve the man called Gakuto</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except she's nothing like the shitty archetypal tsunderes in your seasonal harem shows.<br><br>That doesn't mean you have to find her likable, but she is certainly more interesting than any other main girls. She also has a relationship with the MC that is a step beyond nonexistent/"we both like sumo!", unlike the other girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Umm...duh yeah she is childish didn't you get the memo?</br>  <br><br>He is the friend that Kiyoshi needs, but doesn't deserve.</br></br>  <br>that was in response to people saying it's ok for her to pee on him because kiyoshi did it first.<br>of course she's childish and it's understandable she thinks that way, given her character, it doesn't make her right though.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she's the typical tsundere.<br>At first she doesn't accept mc and gets offended by him somehow gets violent at him, then gradually develops feelings which she can't come to terms with and channels her frustration about her confusion on him.<br>She's the typical tsundere, she's just written in a better manga than tthe average ln-based harem, so she's more fleshed out and has a quirky fetish on top of it, but she falls clearly within the classical tsundere behavior.</br></br></br>  when does Gakuto shit his pants again? I want to relive this insane cringe in motion.  Mari is best girl.<br><br>Shingo a shit. But pretty damn handsome, after Kiyoshi.<br><br>Kiyoshi has best character development, as expected since he's the MC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>1.Gakuto-He wins the bro award for all his suffering<br>2.Kiyoshi-He is selfish but he cares for his bros<br>3.Jo-He stands up when shit rises<br><br><br>Not a bro tier<br>1.Shingo- his a piece of shit but can be a helpful<br>Andrei- he needs to die for being himself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mari is best girl <br> muh daddy issues <br> muh boys are garbage <br> daddy watches porn, the boys must suffer more <br> hurr you broke the rules, you get punished, oh your sentence is ending, I'll just break the rules to expel you <br>She's insanely bad.She's like a fully checked bingo card of cuntery.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are either being willfully ignorant, or haven't watched/read many stuff.<br><br>Your description applies to very few cases, as most tsundere characters amount to being twin-tail sporting, thigh-high wearing girls that spout some variation of "It's not that I like you or anything", while craving MC dick because of course they do.<br><br>Tsundere is a lazy archetype that companies use to appeal to the lowest common denominator otaku.<br><br>While Hana is fetish-bait (like every other girl in the series), she doesn't fall into any particular archetype, except maybe a bitchy 3DPD teenager.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Andre may be often cause of trouble for the group,but his friendship with Jo is top tier.</br>  <br>I dont get the hate for andre. Hes just a brainwashed joke right now kind of like meiko but he has some great moments.</br>  <br>someone didn't read the second half of the manga<br><br> hating on Andrei </br></br></br>  <br>She has tsundere and even yandere shit about her. She gets insane jealous when kiyoshi is involved.</br>  <br>So, she's not a tsundere because she doesn't have the hairstyle and clothing choices of most tsunderes? Really?<br>As for the phrase, she might have not actually said it, but her whole "I have pictures of you with hearts edited on your face in my cell phone but I won't confess to you when you ask if our deal was more about just revenge" is "it's not that I like you or anything" just more fleshed out.<br>I already said she's more fleshed out, because the mangaka is better than the average ln writer. But she's still a tsundere, just a better executed one.<br>But the problem with tsundere isn't as you claim the poor and repeated execution, it's the concept itself.<br>"I like you but won't understand/admit it and just lash out at you" is a shitty character idea, regardless of how well it's executed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When Andre isn't possessed he's pretty based. He's been a bro to Joe and the Andrenomics stuff was quite funny, his character got a lot of laughs earlier on in the series too however he has died down a bit imo.</br>  Just finished the first episode. Almost 6 chapters in one episode is way too fast.  How do I get Mari to sit on my face  <br>she wasn't less of a cunt in the second half, she just didn't have the authority to act as she wanted. when he finds kiyoshi beaten by risa her first phrase is "what did you do wrong?" regardless of the fact that she knows the asc is shitty and that he's helping her.<br>Don't let your boner over her 69 with kate confuse you.</br></br>  <br>I think it was /a/ translations that had that say "What happened to you, did you molest someone?" which is even worse.</br>  <br>Even worse, ya.</br>  <br>It doesn't match the art style of the manga.</br>  <br> /a/ hates femdom <br> shitty fetish <br><br>I've never seen this many lies in a single post since that time moot said he cared about board culture.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not thinking Kate was the best and most fun thing to happen in the series. Best girl, and Pres Mari tied with Hana comes in second, but only when the prez is is scornful is she on Hana's tier.</br></br>  <br><br>What is the point of applying a concept such as tsundere to a character you yourself admit is better fleshed out than that?<br><br>Also, I don't see why she would need to confess anything, as she literally kissed the guy twice, and got physical with him.<br><br>If you wan't to label any female character that has mixed feelings about a guy as "tsundere", be my guest. I just don't see the point.<br><br>Also, an idea that can be executed in a way that creates a likable, or at least an interesting characters, is by definition not a shitty idea. Just one that is often executed poorly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I like her, but I'm in a phase where I've grown to like "popular bitch" characters in general. Her design doesn't hurt either.</br></br>  <br>I liked her more when she was bullying mari not the other way around.</br>  <br>And that's where this whole thing peaks. Its not fun when the girl who's mean because she has to be, takes control from the mean girl who's genuinely mean because its part of her character.<br>So Kate's always going to be more fun, at least in the manga her parts were.<br> Snakes, videos, roasted sweet potatoes. <br>The good stuff, all under Kate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>read the post again.<br>it's not "any character with mixed feelings"<br>it's "girl has feelings for a guy, won't admit/understand it , is frustrated about that and lashes out on guy"<br>That's the fucking definition. if she does that she's a tsundere. She can be more fleshed out, if the reasons for her confusion are more developed, but that doesn't make her not fall under the term.<br>And we disagree if a tsundere can be likeable. The only second I found hana likeable was when she broke down and cried when kiyoshi was crying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you wan't to be pedantic about it, the literal definition of tsundere, as a a compound of tsun tsun and dere dere, is a character that is initially harsh towards someone, but eventually grows to be warm and kind.<br><br>Everything beyond that is your personal definition, and I find that most people won't agree with you. I don't care either way, I don't feel the need to classify fictional characters into generic archetypes in order to enjoy myself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kate was the best and most fun thing to happen in the series <br>My negro</br></br>  <br>The question is when did she start developing feelings for him? Was it always or around the time they kissed?</br>  <br><br>If by feelings you mean teenage sexual lust, probably at the time he had seen her genitals. It doesn't take much for two young, attractive people to fall for each other.</br></br>  <br>No, they were saying it was wrong for Kiyoshi to want to drag others to his level to feel better about what happened.</br>  <br>kiyoshi never actually did that though</br>  <br>We all know who's best boy.</br>  <br>That's called naive</br>  <br>This is the only... Right answer!<br>What can I say, he's got a nice butt. Therefore, he's a good man.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>I wonder how they will voice him.</br>  <br>It's the same voice as the narrator. It's not how I pictured him at all, I wanted Rikiya Koyama, but I guess this is fine.</br>  <br>Well said</br>  <br><br>In fairness she doesn't have too much competition. Every time she's on-screen with Kiyoshi good entertaining shit goes down. <br><br>Only real runner up is Mari who has had close levels of entertaining shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean best MAN?</br></br>  <br>He tried.</br>  <br>Are you just ignoring all the other girls? They all had things happen to them and a few chapters dedicated to each one. Some girls like Chiyo get more arcs.</br>  anyone got a webm of the crew running past kiyoshi to the baths? the jerkiness of the animation had me in stitches  Anyone else waiting for non-censored versions? I wont touch the censored release.  MC is the funniest<br>Glasses is most bro tier though. I'd say...<br>MC &gt; Glasses &gt; Jo &gt; Andre = Shingo</br></br>  <br>he's a big guy</br>  <br>I still fully doubt he'd go through with it. He was in shell-shock about pee. We'll never know for sure though.</br>  <br> we want the Ninja Slayer audience </br>  <br><br> Are you just ignoring all the other girls? <br><br>Obviously not if I had just said she doesn't have "too much" competition, in case you didn't know that means she has somewhat competition but not alot of it. I acknowledged them but my post wasn't about them. <br><br>Yea they had shit but most of Hana's just boils down to her and Kiyoshi, hasn't gotten that big of a backstory reveal or some giant exposition, just mundane relationships with characters in which entertaining things happen more often(to me atleast). Not to mention her facial reactions are fucking A. <br><br>All of it is in my opinion and i'm just saying, her only real runner up is Mari, Meiko is ok along Risa and Mitsuko, Chiyo is the only real dull one in what seems to be a bright cast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cuts off before andre <br><br>rude</br></br></br>  <br>Andre a shit</br>  <br/>  <br>do you have the front shot too?</br>  <br>How long for AT-X version? I won't watch this till its uncensored.</br>  Did it air uncensored? I can't seem to find AT-X raws  <br>F**K ME PLEASU</br>  <br>I'm very upset about the absurd amounts of censorship</br>  <br>I would lick any of the girls feet after they beat me, I dont even particularly like feet<br> mfw </br></br>  <br>maybe I'll read it too...</br>  <br>Wait, you think that Kiyoshi has feelings for Hana? It's evident that Hana has feelings for him, but it isn't clear that he has any feelings for her.</br>  <br>I hope he does. Not a big fan of Chiyo and Hana is awesome.</br>  <br>There isn't anything to like about Chiyo. Her whole character is based on sumo.<br><br>The only possible way for her to become somewhat likable is for her to figure out the relationship between Kiyoshi and Hana.</br></br></br>  <br>After all the hand holding, kissing and pissing, Kiyoshi thinks he might like her, but he's still not sure and after he got pissed on himself, he thinks he's not worthy of Chiyo</br>  <br>The way I see it, there will be a 3rd arc with the boys as the new ASC where their perversions nearly ruin the school. That way the author can fully show the influence of power before the series ends with the assMAN closing down the prison and ending the "Prison School"</br>  <br>He somewhat reconciled from the feelings of being pissed on when he talks to Gakuto about the shitting though.</br>  <br>she would have been better if she stayed a slut</br>  <br>Probably. We don't really have a pure slut character in this series.</br>  <br>usually I like slut purification, but in her case I wanted the opposite</br>  <br>So, Kiyoshi knows he likes Chiyo and possibly likes Hana?<br>That'll be fun if it's ever Hana v. Chiyo</br></br>  <br>His attraction to her can be seen through his actions with her. The fantasies he has of some sort of future occurrences with her means the man has a ton of thinking to do.</br>  I watched the first episode and I cringed all the way through it <br>but I kinda liked it<br>will it be like this for all the time? <br>"WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING THIS WHAT IS THIS WHAT THE FUCK WHY" moments?</br></br></br>  There is no reason for Kiyoshi to like Chiyo more than Hana. He has had zero growth with Chiyo beyond helping her not be a slut. He has way more intimacy with Hana.  Can anyone clarify why Chiyo chan is now a slut?  <br>That entire slut thing was awful and ruined her even further.</br>  <br>It was love at first sight. Remember, the first girl that the MC falls in love with always wins.<br><br>It'll be a ride, that's for sure.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't. She thought that Mari was a slut so she wanted to also be a slut or something.<br>She's fine now (well, still retarded but not a slut)<br><br><br> implying any development could save her </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  Remember, the first girl that the MC falls in love with always wins. <br><br>I'm just waiting for her to be the long lost childhood friend.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope its actually Kate.</br>  <br>I'm actually impressed, I didn't think anything could make me dislike Chiyo more.<br><br>This would be fucking awful. Well, we're fucked.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Chiyo isn't a crazy bitch <br> hana is </br></br></br>  <br> He's voiced by Kamiya Hiroshi <br><br>How is it possible for him to get even hotter?</br></br></br>  <br> not enjoying the crazy <br> the year of our lord 2015 </br></br>  <br>Whos to say she isnt? That entire family is fucking wacko with their weird absolutes for judging people.</br>  <br>The intimate scenes between Hana and Kiyoshi will most likely be butchered in the anime.<br><br>They were so good in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, she's half retarded half innocent. She's even turned into a slut because she felt like it.<br><br>It wouldn't surprise me if she went crazy after finding that her lover was cheating on her.</br></br></br>  <br> Her lover <br><br>They arent even a thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, he's touched her somewhat sexually plus they've been on a date. <br>There is definitely something.</br></br>  <br><br> her lover was cheating on her. <br><br>She'd just be heartbroken that someone else made the move first, or atleast 4 times before she did.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Chiyo isn't a crazy bitch <br><br>She sure isn't crazy, but she isn't all that sane either. Hell, we had a whole mini arc about her slutting up because she couldn't muster losing Kiyoshi over herself not being a slut</br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was more because she was upset about her sister and decided to try it based on the tree climbing experience in her youth.</br>  <br>Not in Naruto...</br>  <br> I thought that copy pasta about girls beating the shit out of you while spitting in your mouth and calling you worthless was a joke. <br><br>When did 4chan become so judging about other people's fetishes? The normalfag-ism here is insane - there's the overt bait, but then there's this shit.<br><br>Very soon anal will become too taboo for this board.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, at the end of the day, chiyo is the one who hasn't kicked him in the face. hana might be more interesting from an audience perspective, but I can understand kiyoshi's pov</br>  watching this purely for dominant hot chicks tbh<br><br>though i gather there might be an ok story arc and some good bro stuff</br></br>  <br>Sorta like that.<br>She went "Oh, Kiyoshi likes my sister. My sister kinda acts like a slut, so maybe I should mirror her without thinking and become a slut too so I don't lose Kiyoshi"<br><br>She may not be crazy yet, but she sure isn't the sharpest tool in the shed</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>if you go over to pol they can get pretty puritanical about sex in general</br></br>  <br>I hope not, this is the last board (mostly) free from normalfagging bullshit</br>  <br>you should read the manga</br>  <br><br>what about us normalfags who have a few kinks?</br></br>  Am I the only one expecting that they would do a highly detailed still frame during the joke?  <br>Kiyoshi was a minor factor. She was driving her self insane over wondering whether her sister was a slut.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Kiyoshi's pov is all sorts of screwed up.<br>He loves Chiyo for being a pure angel, a beacon of purity.<br>But he also (not decidedly) likes Hana for having his first female experiences with her (pissing aside), and taking his daydreaming into consideration, Hana is a strong suitor for his love as well</br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually hoping right now that Kiyoshi actually picks Hana, or Mari in the worst case scenario.<br><br>Chiyo-chan sounds like an easy NTR manipulable character after you stated that.</br></br></br>  <br> he loves chiyo for being a pure angel <br>can't really blame him with how the other females in this school treats him. he needs a beacon of hope to keep his sanity<br><br>with hana it's more physical and more "lost my "virginity" to her" not actual virginity, you get my point</br></br></br></br>  Even fucking Mari has had more flag raising experiences with Kiyoshi than Chiyo. It's a completely one sided crush.  <br>Yeah, but usually what the mc wants matters more for the narrative than what the potential interests want.<br><br>When both councils fails in this battle and we get a new one next arc, which could be chiyo led in a "let's all get along together" -until she gets psycho- she'll get her flags.</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with having normal tastes. There's no requirement to be a sexual deviant to browse /a/. Being a "normalfag" is imposing your vanilla tastes on others.<br><br> You like little girls over women? Pedo! <br> You don't like big tits? Whats wrong with you, creep! <br>Very soon it becomes <br> how can anyone like drawn girls over real girls? Have you ever even had a girlfriend? <br><br>Femdom is a great fetish, and we femdom connoisseurs suffer greatly at the lack of our available options (or worse, doujins tagged as femdom, but only have 2 pages of the woman bullying the guy, and the rest is shes overpowered and becomes a slave to cock).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do they fall for MCs dick?  <br>10/10 post<br>The same shit is happening on /v/ right now<br> how can you like a video game girl? <br> have you ever had a real gf??? <br>the shit is real</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer it when HanaKana plays perverts and weirdos.</br>  <br>Kiyoshi-Mari is never, ever going to happen. They behave like siblings when near each other, with Mari being the older sibling who bullies him around and Kiyoshi being the submissive younger sibling. Well, not exactly siblings, but it's a respect based relationship.<br><br>Possible outcomes of the Kiyoshibowl are:<br>Chiyo wins - The most predictable and expected one.<br>Hana wins - Hanafags will blow up /a/ with non-stop shitposting, but the sorta least likely one to happen  (even if I myself think Hana is the better girl)  <br> Kiyoshi takes both home - Hiramoto drops his mangaka career and tries to topple the doujin empire built by ShindoL, Raita and the likes, ushering a new golden age of highly detailed, plot driven doujinshi </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari is a better character than that to suddenly and out of nowhere start to have interest in someone especially someone that is a man and has nothing of interest towards her more than acquaintances for a common goal, and who is still trying to chase an ideal who happens to be her sister. I see better things in store for her.</br>  <br> No___. <br>And that's the good thing about this series.</br></br>  <br><br>well when you put it like that<br><br>pedos are scum<br>big tits is a preference meh<br>liking drawn girls over real is weird as fuck and just fox and the grapes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Marimo best Teekyu</br>  <br>That's not what happened. You need to reread that arc. The author made it look like Chiyo was jealous, then revealed it was actually all about Mari all along, not Kiyoshi.</br>  <br>The ending to that arc pissed me off. After all of that shit it was more of an issue she took with her sisters honor than anything and to rub it in even more she tells kiyoshi "thatll never happen again" with kiyoshis reaction to that making it look as if foreshadowing their relationship as a whole. Thats when i stopped caring about chiyo.</br>  Didn't read manga, sorry about that. <br><br>But,<br><br>Maan! That President aka Crow-Girl. What a fucking beauty. I would literally do anything she says, take any beating from her just to see her amused.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had the opposite reaction. I loved the end of that arc. It sealed Hana as the sole runner for the Kiyoshi-bowl.</br>  It's gotta be Jo.

Chris's symphogear headpiece reminds me of that one Kancolle enemy. Does it look like that to anyone else?  <br>Nah, that would just make Hibiki fight even harder so that she could protect her wife. Miku is already a huge motivation for Hibiki to fight as it is, half of her songs reference "the future" which can also be read as "Miku." <br><br>Also I think that given what happened to Chris and Tsubasa, Hibiki not transforming was actually the right choice. She probably would've taken a lot more of a beating.</br></br></br>  did nana sing enka in this season yet?  <br>They're all shit</br>  <br>I wanna stick it in.</br>  Hibiki needs to get some common sense. Her strategy of talking things out rather than fighting is okay and all if they were already well acquainted, but nobody is going to spill their guts to a complete stranger.<br><br>She needs to earn the 2hus respect before that.</br></br>  Reminder Hibiki is the ugliest symphogear.    <br>The very best.</br>  <br><br>Then put a bag over it<br><br>That ass was made for riding</br></br></br></br>  <br>Say that to my face fucker.</br>  <br><br>I like Hibiki's body when she's kicking ass<br><br>For some reason she always looks sickly thin when she's in uniform</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not her fault. The others are just cuter by miles. It's the reverse of the one eye'd man being the king of the blind. In this case, she's the blind man in the land of the one eye'd men.</br>  <br>Why bother with trying to look good when you can just punch shit all day?

Aside from the small group of circlejerking fags, no one gave a shit about that show.</br></br>  <br>It was a well-executed, perfectly-weighted blend of iyashikei and comedy with a delightfully charming, natural-feeling depiction of friendship, anon. I attribute its mediocre popularity largely to its unorthodox character designs.</br>  <br>Are we remembering the same show?</br>  <br>Did you ever hang out with any girls in high school, anon?

Yuyushiki is extremely unique in that it gets the dynamic of everyday close female friendship more right than anything else I've seen, and I did hang out with a group of girls in high school. Close high school female friends really do act that random, silly and, yes, gay. It gets the dynamic right and it does so in a really charming way IMO. The production is severely underrated, too, as it's animated well and the soundtrack is memorable and perfectly appropriate, as are the voice actresses, especially Yukari's impossibly adorable voice and laughs.</br>  <br> not liking yuyushiki </br>  <br> But other characters in the show find them to be weird, so their friendship can't possibly be natural-feeling. <br>What?

I'm going to marry Haruharu!    I want to undress Towa.  Haruka is a unique and interesting character in her own right who even now continues to fail and work hard to overcome that and achieve her dream.  I really can't bring myself to like Minami no matter how much I try. She's quite honestly, boring as fuck and it's easy to tell that even the staff itself does not care about doing anything with her.<br><br>Maybe they will do something with her in the future, but by them, I'd be way too far for me to start caring.<br><br>One is supposed to want to see more development or an end of a character arc during those stages, not to want for anything to be done with the character itself.</br></br></br></br>  If anyone says anything bad about Mana in this thread I'm going to cry.  <br>I'm so glad Minami got the short end of the stick instead of Kirara.</br>  <br>Funny faces don't make you unique or interesting unless you're Erika.</br>  I want to like Gopri, but I know Kirara's not gonna have much screeentime or relevancy to the overall plot other than being the yellow cure.  <br>Mana a shit. A SHIT.</br>  1-hour drawing incoming.<br><br>Last thread was kinda too heated, so I waited until this new thread. So, today has a pair theme with the following pairs being the attention: Mushiban &amp; Sirloin  (what the hell is this kind of name?) , Momozono Love &amp; Aono Miki, Kenzaki Makoto &amp; Davi, Tsumugi &amp; Zeke, Pafu &amp; Aroma.<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-11?<wbr>lang=en<br>http://togetter.com/li/846033?lang=<wbr>en</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erika wasn't very interesting asides being comedy relief.</br>  <br>We are literally getting a Kirara + Towa arc just now. I'm not sure what more else you fucks could want. Be grateful because had this been another series none of the girls but Haruka would have interacted with Towa in any meaningful way.<br><br>At this point I'm still amazed people bitch and complain about muh screentime and muh relevancy for non-pinks after 3 fucking years of Precure being PINK, PINK, PINK.<br><br>Maybe things will change next year now that that chucklefuck of Shibata will probably finally be gone but just in-case mentally condition yourself to pre-emptively like next year Pink the most. You'll get all your screentime and relevancy that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but it means that it will have the classic archetypes that little girls like, there are literally no cure that isn't an achetype, the important is the execution.<br><br><br>That is your opinion.<br>Personally I never liked the genky archetype and I love the silent introvert girl archetype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arc </br>  <br>Yes, arc. If you had bothered to read the spoilers you'd see it's like 3 episodes of nothing but Kirara + Towa.</br>   the redemption of kid with huge chin <br>how</br>  <br>Kirara and Towa are roommates. With Towa being the second most important Gopri Cure after Haruka that means Kirara is sure to gain more relevance than she currently has.</br>  <br>I love how she chases after her childish dream wholeheartedly, and puts in the effort necessary. Unlike what people guessed at the beginning, she doesn't keep jumping from thing to thing, and is focusing on mainly violin and ballet, not tennis or tea pouring or whatever. I like how much she values her bond with Kanata, and how last episode when she wanted to save Towa, it wasn't because of some sense of justice or wanting to fight against Dyspear, it was simply because she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata. I like her antics and clumsiness, and how she doesn't immediately win everyone over. Does she share traits with past pink cures? Of course, that's why she's the leader, but it's her specific personality and combination that makes her Haruno Haruka.</br>  <br> she wanted to keep her promise with Kanata.  <br>I liked this part too.</br></br>  <br><br>Even the Crimson Chin admitted his wrongdoings.</br></br>  Favorite silly Precure fanart? I really like this one, the way the skin is drawn looks very soft and smooth. Like a marshmallow.  <br>What? Smile gave good screentime to Miyuki, Yayoi and Akane; only Nao and Reika got shafted. Only DD and HaCha's second half were PINK PINK PINK.</br>    Fresh: KANPEKI and Animal Girl get shafted<br>Hearcatch: Itsuki gets shafted after Moonlight joins<br>Suite: Kanade gets shafted<br>Smile: Nao and Reika get shafted<br>DD: There are characters not named Mana?<br>HaCha: Everyone but Hime gets shafted in the first half, everyone but Gumi gets shafted in the second half</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like this one.</br>  <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>This.<br>What makes Haruno good isn't her super original archetype, but the way she has been handled.</br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>This is completely unrealistic</br>    <br>Oh wait, I missed the word "silly". If so, this one.</br>  I know an easy way for a young girl like Towa to earn some money...guehuehue.    <br>Which shafted Cure hurts you the most?</br>  <br>I was about to get mad thinking you thought her suffering was silly, but then I saw you posted , which is cute.<br><br> Peace signs <br>Can't stop associating it with hentai, though the art is high quality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>White.</br>    Some nice one-draws today.      <br>Nao and Reika.<br><br>I'm still mad about no NaoRei episode. God, I fucking hate Yonemura so much.</br></br></br>  <br>Rikka and Minami.</br>  <br>Hime.</br>  <br> Hime <br> shafted </br></br>    <br>I want to impregnate Reika.</br>  <br>We all want.</br>  Reika is top gang bang material.    I want to save Reika from neethood.  Daily Minamin!!  If you had the skills to draw any precure art you wanted what would you draw?  <br>porn</br>  <br>Yayoi doing yayoi things.</br>  <br>Iona as the aunt to me and Maria's kids. That or me married to an adult Rikka/Towa/Iona.</br>  <br><br>Tons of futa porn.  Including futa-on-male. </br></br>  <br> vanilla  porn</br>  <br>A good wallpaper of Precure Rainbow Rose Explotion, since it is imposible to find one.</br>  <br>Cute girls doing cute things, like this. I love this artist and his Cure cats so much.</br>          <br> This late already <br>Fuck</br></br>    <br>On-time Bukki is best Bukki!</br>  I haven't watched this since episode 12. Did they handle the bad guy switching sides thing better than in Fresh?    <br> everyone makes a big fucking deal about Kayano <br> after she starts going to school nobody really gives a shit </br></br>  <br>What makes this way more bearable than HaCha's/Ace's make up?</br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>I wouldn't say better than Fresh. But not a terrible blunder either. Interestingly enough she seems to be the Yellow's companion rather than the Pink's.</br>  <br>She's a toppu moderu.</br>      <br>Ace had nice looking make up though.</br>  <br>I'd shaft Nao and Reika if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Kirara x Minamin confirmed.</br>  <br><br>She learned from the best.</br></br>  <br>But the spoilers say it's actually Kirara x Towa. I'm confused.</br>  <br>Kirara aint no one-woman gal.</br>   lez-baba   <br>Thank you for posting my favorite GoPri daily.</br>  What would you teach Towa in modern world?   no elf jokes pls   <br>sex</br>  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside.</br>  <br><br>Do you think that they don't know how to make love in Hope kingdom?</br></br>  <br>camwhoring</br>  Wow was there ever a lot of bile during the livewatch.  <br>I mean. Maybe.<br><br>Towa and Kanata are clearly from different parents. Maybe they were adopted from a neighboring kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Good thing I missed it then.</br>  <br>I guess it's the one time of week there's a real risk of it looking like /a/ in here.</br>  <br>Don't kid yourself. This shithole isn't any better than /a/.</br>  <br>I strongly disagree.</br>  <br>you were probably one of those douchebags stinking up the thread last night, weren't you</br>    <br>Why are suffering Precure so arousing?</br>  <br>Because you are bad person</br>    <br>It's okay, anon. I'm a bad person too. Let's just stay inside and make sure society doesn't have to deal with us too much before we die, okay?</br>    <br>gross</br>    <br><br><br>Shut up, nerd.</br></br></br>  <br>Lots of All Star stuff, just things between the Cures of various series.</br>  <br>Good thing I was there to fight the shitposters.</br>    <br>I like how most of those fairy dolls are about the actual size they would be save for Sharuru who voices Haru Haru.<br><br>How much for a sloppy one with that make-up on?</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to fuck that cardboard cutout of Cure Honey.</br>  <br>I really miss when Hime was the star of HaCha</br>  <br>Hime did everything wrong and was undeserving as a main character. Why would you open the box of all evil?</br>  <br>We all do, anon. I think maybe she charged my happiness too much and broke it so now it's leaking all the time and making me sad.</br>  <br><br>I really want to fuck that Towa kig.</br></br>    <br>Hah. I totally see it. I love Erikas hair.</br>  <br> Wow was there ever a lot of bile during the livewatch. <br><br>Weren't they just waiting for DBS?</br></br></br>  <br>Cure Seaweed.<br>Or maybe Aquamarine</br></br>  please do not rape the haruharu  <br><br>That's probably for the best. The pressure and attention was one of the reasons she got her anxiety disorder in the first place.</br></br>  Holy shit I fucking love Doremi, thank you precure thread.   Open new ep <br> See this <br> What do? </br></br>    <br/>  <br>the thumb goes in the hole<br>it's a metaphor for  sex </br></br>  http://www.amiami.com/top/detail/de<wbr>tail?gcode=FIG-COL-9288&amp;</wbr>  <br> sex <br>That thing with the tambourine?</br></br>  Which cure would be least shocked if you came up behind her loud enough for her to hear and suddenly applied a well-lubricated shocker?    <br>You mean like a defibrillator? I'd say Peace would be the least shocked, since she is the one used to it the most.</br>  <br><br>I love Mana :((</br></br>  <br>No, that's not what I meant at all, but I still think you might be correct.</br>    <br>Thank you Haruyama</br>  <br>I called that gap being too large, sasuga haruyama.</br>  Precure one-hour draw:<br><br>http://sakuramochi.mydns.jp/precure<wbr>/1draw-collections/date/2015-07-12<br><br>The theme is Haruno Haruka. Again, meh.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> Putting Towa in Kirara's room <br>Big Mistake<br>In a matter of time, she will be ....</br></br></br>  So here are the unconfirmed toy spoilers. There's no image or anything, but the fact that multiple very similar information popped up around different websites gives them some degree of credibility, kind of.<br><br> September 12: Music Princess Palace <br> November 7: Royal Dress-up Key(s), Music Princess Palace + Royal Dress-up Key set <br> The palace looks like the picture of the Hope Kingdom used in the anime and it's a music box. <br> There are 4 slots for the keys. <br> If you rotate a certain part of the palace, the door opens. <br> If you spin the music box mechanism a rainbow colored light illuminates the door and the melody starts. <br> If you insert the 4 keys and spin the music box mechanism the melody changes and the voice track with the finishing move starts playing (Resonate! Power of all*! Precure Eclair Espoir!). <br> If you put the individual dress-up keys (sold separately) in the center, the respective finishing move voice plays. <br> 8 game modes to play with the music, the keys and the other toys (perfumes, crystal rods, violin). <br><br>*I'm aware this sounds rather horrible in English, but that's literally what it says, it's not "the power of us 4", or "the power of everyone", it's literally "the power of everything/all"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haruharu a cutest pink!<br><br>I like this kind of thing, art of civ form and cure forms together.</br></br></br>  <br>Improved? Bettered? Enriched?</br>  <br>Is it wrong to hope for an idol song finisher?</br>  <br>Haruharu a leggiest Precure!</br>  <br>If we get more spoilers it will probably become apparent whether the "melody" is an actual song or not. I'd certainly like hearing Miyukichi singing voice.</br>  How do you have a breakfast as a princess?<br>- Yui's style<br>Ham and Egg, Potato Salad &amp; Bread<br>- Haruka's style<br>Katsu and Rice, Miso Soup &amp; Salad</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is she eating a Japanese meal with a knife and fork?</br>  <br>Princesses don't eat with sticks.</br>  <br> Resonate! Power of all* <br><br>You're right that does sound weird. I wonder what sort of fun Commie will have with it.</br></br></br>  <br> -Southern European style: a couple of biscuits/bread with jam and/or fruit with either coffee/coffee with milk/milk or just water. <br>Otherwise I'd rather starve.</br></br>    <br>Pancakes with homemade syrup and at least one of my friends (must be wearing cute outfit) accompanying me out on the veranda. No boys allowed.</br>  <br>A bowl of cereal/apple cinnamon flavored oatmeal. Alternatively orange juice, eggs, bacon, grits, and biscuits.</br>      <br>SUTEKI!</br>  <br><br>So, the power up toy is gonna be a doll house?</br></br>  why was this not a movie  What is she implying?  <br><br>Just a wild guess, but I'd say she's talking about Kirara's ability to take three at once. She's talking about donuts, of course.</br></br>  <br>Did you watch the Motto movie yet? It's pretty good.</br>  <br>It was okay</br>  <br>It's probably too small to even fit nendoroids in it.</br>  <br>That's a fun Hana episode though. The one with her and the dog right? I remember thinking it was super super cute when she was riding him and then when he saved her. There's lots of fun Hana stuff in Dokkan too.</br>  <br>Not to mention the Hana and Pop episode in Na-i-sho.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9E2<wbr>IfmU-9-Q</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>When are we going to do something like this? Except maybe with Gopri.</br></br>  How does one manage to be more of a alien than Mako3.14?  <br>She's probably never seen a truck before.</br>  <br> BRAAAAAAACKUUUUUUUUUUUUUU <br>Gets me everything</br></br>  <br>BRAKU will never not make me laugh<br><br>I must see this then.<br>Because I think most thought that MakoP had full blown Assburgers even when it came to stuff from the Trump Kingdom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least she can read and learn. Wait, how did she get that book if she had no money?</br>  <br>The officer probably gave it to her so she doesn't get run down by a Japanese Truck</br>  <br><br>I'd be down to produce/contribute it, but I doubt anyone else is willing to submit recordings.</br></br>  <br> a Japanese Truck <br>She really didn't realize just how dangerous of a situation she was in. Those things are much more fearsome than the villains.</br></br>  <br>Villains can be fought at least.<br>Japanese Truck will just appear if you happen to be around a road and will wreck your shit.</br></br>  I'm not sure why I like the Doki episode title cards so much, but I do. Cute little ditty, the character montage, I know it's nothing special but I find myself looking forward to it.  Did you hear that, /pc/? Rikka's smart, so it must be true.  <br>She's right, Mana is an object that everyone owns.</br>  <br>Rikka is an object I want to own.</br>  What good is being smart if you're not going to actually use your brains?<br><br><br>A few days ago I'd be with you but I'm teetering right now. Regina is such an awful little brat but I feel myself strangely drawn to her all the same.</br></br></br>  <br> A few days ago I'd be with you but I'm teetering right now. Regina is such an awful little brat but I feel myself strangely drawn to her all the same. <br><br>Mana is that you?</br></br></br>  <br> Regina is such an awful little brat but I feel myself strangely drawn to her all the same. <br>Anon, I think it simply because you are a lolicon.</br></br>  <br>Nah, I just like broken things.</br>  <br>Why not have both?</br>  They went through a lot of trouble to show that this whole back-and-forth wasn't supposed to be a deep and nefarious plot, it's an awfully big commitment that kind of makes me wonder how long they'll do this for.  And I can see why the Ace thing probably stings a lot more because of it...   Oh great, not this shit again. And just when we finally got another school episode.  <br>whoops, image</br>  <br>Treasure that episode. It's the last one Marina ever gets</br>  TUXEDO KAMEN!<br><br>Er, I mean... ONII-SAN!<br><br>I know it's different, but it's still more than a little convenient.</br></br></br></br>  Will he die next? <br>From what we saw this episode he seems stronger and more evil than Dyspear.</br>  <br>They have some fun with this in about four episodes.</br>  <br>I thought he was going to be the final villain, as did some others here, but I'm pretty sure now that he isn't, he "revealed his true self" too early. Still not sure whether he or Shut will die first either.</br>  <br> not voiced by Erika <br> not even cheeky </br></br>  <br>What? No! It can't be! And it was just getting good with cows and male friendship!</br>  <br>We need to execute all soccer fucking shits in Doremi<br>Nothing good comes of them<br>I suggest starting with Kotake</br></br></br>  <br>Why Dyspear get out?</br>  <br> &gt;Ugly </br>  <br>There is an episode of Dokkan which seems like it was originally going to be a movie but they decided against it for some reason. <br><br>The staff was like three times as big.</br></br></br>  <br>Her story didn't get resolved properly just 2 second still with her family.</br>  A princess and a tomboy?! That's preposterous.<br><br><br>How stronger? If you're talking about beating them off individually, Twilight did that pretty handily too, even if they asspulled the ending of that fight. It's a bit of a shame they couldn't have just left that one, I think it would've been a better build-up.</br></br></br>  <br>That was her motivation, her development was independent of it.</br>  I have literally no idea who this guy is<br>I wanted Fumihiko Tachiki, he did good replacing Matsuo as the dad in Super Gals</br>  What if he's Dune 2.0?  <br>Toe would die.</br>  <br>Did you watch Na-i-sho yet?</br>    <br>Series chronology is for gays<br>Production order is the best order</br></br>    <br>True but her goal was to save her kingdom and family. I atleast wanted a good reunion with Hime and her parents. Maybe they mention how much she has grown as a person.</br>  <br>Actually production order is for people with autism. But whatever. Enjoy it however you want.</br>  <br>What is Sango doing in Doremi?</br>  <br>I bet you watch Haruhi in chronological order too.</br>  <br> No one will ever say this to you </br>    <br>I watched that as it was airing so I didn't. Sorry.</br>  <br> muh ultimate dis pear <br>I will enjoy it properly</br></br>   that Minamean   <br>Well you're not enjoying the story properly. You're just going along with your weird autism to watch them in the order they were made, instead of the order in which the story progresses. Like that's gonna enhance the experience for you or something. <br><br>But like, it's not REALLY important. You'll just be happy instead of sad when you finish it.</br></br></br>  When did you realize that Reika is actually a qt and barely a bitch at all?  It's actually more laziness then straight up autism. You can't be bothered to figure out when to watch Naisho in the middle of Motto, so you just save it for last. I bet you don't watch the movies until the end too.  <br> Kirara and Hime have the same exact face on both shots <br>Soul sisters.</br></br>  <br>During the first season in the episode about her dad.</br>  I'm not sure this is worth arguing about.    <br>Subs when?</br>  <br><br>Okay nerds, I will be the lazy autist and you can have fun watching Gundam and Votoms in the order that the events happen because that's how it was meant to viewed. You win<br><br><br>She was always cute</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br>If this is a burn I don't get it. <br><br>Would watching Gundam in order of events somehow ruin the experience?</br></br></br>   Poor little Red Princess   <br>Absolutely hidoi. As expected of the worst ojamajo.</br>  <br>General powerup is kind of deathflag. I don't like it because then the villain band will consist just a Shut which sucks.<br><br> stronger and more evil than Dyspear. <br>Dyspear can create powerfull artifacts and negated trio finisher without sweating.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, in terms of suffering she at least beats out Hana. I was fully expecting that  elephant to die. </br>  <br>We're done arguing so I'd rather not explain, but if you must know, it would entail watching a 39 ep TV series or 3 movies, then a 13 ep OVA made 15 years after the TV series, then watching a four episode OVA made a decade after the TV series, then a 13 episode series made after the 4 ep OVA, then a 50 episode TV series made eight or nine years after the TV series, then a 40 some episode series that immediately came out after the last TV series, then a movie that comes immediately after that, and then you go and watch a seven episode OVA that was made fifteen years after this last movie, after this you go watch another movie made after the last movie and then you go read a manga about pirates before watching another 40 some ep TV series made after that last movie<br><br>Gundam is an extreme, but the point is if something is good enough for little girls it's a good enough way to watch for me</br></br></br>    <br>I dunno I think it being so extreme kinda hurts your point. <br>Doremi is just "watch these episodes in the middle of season three and then continue as normal". <br><br>And ideally those Naisho episodes would have been in Motto to begin with. They're just stories they thought of later and don't really build on anything plot related. Like I said, it really doesn't matter beyond how you wanna feel when you finish it. Saying one is better than the other isn't worth arguing about.</br></br></br></br>     2015 <br> Still arguing about when to watch Naisho <br><br>Bitch please I watched that shit in the middle of season 1 because it was all we had.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Aroma a cute.<br><br>A CUTE.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I had to watch something out of order because nothing else was subbed <br><br>That's your own fault and not relevant. <br>Also the argument was over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naisho was subbed way before my time. Goodness how the years fly by, huh?</br>  <br>aroma a fat</br>  <br>The real question is when we're gonna get those awful Doremi 16 novels translated fully.</br>  <br>Nah, the real question is when am I gonna get off my lazy ass to finish the v2s. The novels would be up to Lad or Mace I guess. I'll bug them later and see if they are interested.</br>  <br>It has some high tier drawings.</br>  What's an accent consultant?  <br>They  can't use magic and everyone except Doremi and Onpu all have boyfriends is all I know about it. Maybe the drama is good. </br>  <br>Awful in what way? Is this a Gogo situation again where one person says it's bad until everyone can read it?</br>  <br>What about the audio dramas</br>  <br>A long story. The gist of it is I had a guy helping me re-write some of Aiko's lines because I wanted to put her accent back in. It was present in Neclos's releases, but once Lad took over, pretty much vanished. Then the guy lost interest and the idea kinda got pushed aside.<br><br>Come v2 though, I've been tweaking Aiko's lines a bit more.<br><br><br>No plans, currently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily Minamin!!  <br>That's a shame.</br>  <br>I can talk to Lad and Mace and see if they are interested sometime.</br>  Did they change the music composer mid season?<br>The new tracks sound very different from what we had these last three seasons.</br>  <br>Hey I don't know if these things are actually good so don't stress about it too much.</br>  <br>What the fuck is that microphone and karaoke machine guy lol<br><br>Yeah I'm not too worried about the supplementary stuff like the drama CDs. Our main goal has always been to get the anime subbed and we did that. Since I'm a hopeless loser and can't escape from this amazing show, now it's all over again with the v2s.</br></br></br>  Too lewd for Kiriya.  Actually while I'm here, has anyone been watching and enjoying the v2s? Does anyone really give two shits? I don't have a good gauge for what the overall response to them has been, I've just been releasing episodes then moving on to the next. Anything good, bad, indifferent to say?  <br>I would drink beer with her.</br>  <br>I wish I saw them<br>I bet they have even more banter TL notes and denotations of what episode something happened when characters talk about it</br></br>  <br>I appreciate the effort, but I'm not personally watching them. <br><br>Hey if you have a good RAW for the first movie I wouldn't mind it though.</br></br></br>  <br>No, heh, I've been removing a lot of really unnecessary notes and other stupid shit. I don't like TL notes, so I've avoided them when possible, and if something has to be explained, I try to have one or two words in parenthesis in the line, or on top.<br><br>I honestly forgot that stupid shit like in that screenshot slipped through. I apologize for that.<br><br><br>That's fair. It's a hard pill to swallow, rewatching a 200+ episode series, but there was a LOT of early stuff I was not satisfied with, especially since how the very early S1 episodes conflict with later episodes due to improved translations and whatnot, so part of the goal was to go back and fix that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10 Of course I appreciate it!</br>  <br>I've started watching Doremi because of those v2s and will watch through it with those.<br><br>Thanks Doremi.</br></br></br>  <br>I I haven't watched them beyond just checking out the technical quality. Already watched everything up to the middle of Naisho (Naisho is really good). I do badger newcomers to get it over the old releases though. I have S1 downloaded and seeded to 40+ though. I'll check out the first episode tomorrow, because it's a really nice episode.</br>  <br>I don't even remember any translation errors from the first season.<br><br>Only animation errors.</br></br></br>  <br>But I like them<br>I don't wanna watch Precure if you guys don't do that, I need my guidance and wisdom and bantz from the top of the screen</br></br>  <br>I sort of like them. Gives the feeling that the guys working on it were young and unreserved.</br>  <br>What about TV-Nihon?</br>  <br>Awesome, thanks for your support.<br><br><br>Also awesome. Glad to see new people getting into it.<br><br><br>Oh, well, we haven't done Naisho v2s yet, just S1 and the first tiny bit of Sharp. Let me know how S1 looks to you.<br><br><br>There were a handful, such as the Witch World being called the Magic Kingdom, Witch Frogs being called Magic Frogs during the -entire- series, the Magical Stage spells being untranslated (The final word is an actual word, as opposed to magical gibberish), and lines that while they may not have been -wrong- they were just lacking a bit of polish or detail.<br><br><br>lol<br><br><br>The guy who added that line is like 45+. Still though, most of us were pretty young when we were doing this show. I worked on it through half of high school and all of college, pretty much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aishiteru.  <br> &gt;Naisho V2 will get released after Dokkan V2 as a big fuck you to antiproduction order fags  <br><br>Calling it. <br><br> This is a joke by the way. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh. You're actually partly right. Naisho v2 will be last yes, but that's primarily due to technical reasons. I need to source out better raws and we're missing like half of the original scripts, so those either have to be dug up from the netherrealm of Mace's/Lad's computer or remade from scratch. Most of them were remade a few years ago, but we're still missing some.</br>  <br> There were a handful, such as the Witch World being called the Magic Kingdom, Witch Frogs being called Magic Frogs during the -entire- series, the Magical Stage spells being untranslated (The final word is an actual word, as opposed to magical gibberish), and lines that while they may not have been -wrong- they were just lacking a bit of polish or detail. <br><br>So nothing actually offensively bad</br></br></br>  Erika no Tsubomi  <br>Why not just set up a donate thing for people to just buy you the DVDs? <br><br>And unlike with TV-N we know you'll actually release something once you get the money.</br></br></br>  <br> I want to use magic to help them, but that's now allowed. <br><br>Aside from a now/not typo (in regards to mind control magic) in Sharp 4, no, nothing super bad. The only other really bad mistranslation I can think of was in Onpu's debut episode, where her skipping over exams was kinda glossed over and not really articulated properly. Ironically, the 4kids dub of all things alerted me to the kinda ech lines.<br><br><br>Nah, our new raw guy for the v2 project, Puto, is a fucking sorcerer and has the entire series on DVD. Pretty sure he has Naisho too, but if not, I know he can get it, so we're covered. He's just been very busy the last few months due to his new job and other anime projects, so he can only get out about 2 newly encoded Ojamajo episodes per week. The man's help has been most welcome, though.<br><br>Damn captcha expiring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I guess I'm just used to truly, awful subs, for old Toku shows. So nothing in Doremi V1 really stood out as being poorly subbed. <br>...I don't even remember Onpus voice in the 4kidz version. Only Aikos screeching. And Doremi making fart noises.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, you'd only really notice some of the less-good lines in the v1s if you knew what you were looking for or if you had an average grasp of Japanese. Really it's just cases of "Oh, the subtitle is kind of a paraphrased, less-detailed version of the dialog" or it's reworded slightly differently. It's definitely not Toku quality haha.<br><br>I don't remember Onpu's voice either and I'm glad that I don't. Aiko's screeching straight up gave me a fucking headache. I honestly don't think I got through a single full episode.</br></br></br>    <br>I am erect.</br>  <br>I had the hardest fucking time finding Motto RAWs, I ended up downloading this 24 part Rapidshare thing over like a three day period. I still haven't found a creditless version of the second OP for Motto.</br>  <br><br>I wish I could remember where we got our original Motto raws. I know that I got a set of raws from Tokyo Toshokan, and they were originally going to be used in the v2 project before Puto showed up.</br></br>  I nearly forgot it's Sunday.<br>Will we ever see my Angel again?</br>  <br>Perfect threesome</br>  I swear this thing looks less and less like a bow and more like something else entirely every time I see it.  <br>No. She's a fuckng shit.</br>  <br>Considering tennis guy will be back, Ranko will probably be back too.</br>  <br>I want to drink her first period.</br>  <br>The heart shape at the other end is my favorite feature.</br>  <br>It actually looks like Salami there.<br><br>Where did we here that?<br>Nip TV Guide or whatever that told us there would be swimsuits and Pafu and Aroma's Human Forms?<br><br>Okay but I call  Her First Kiss </br></br></br></br></br></br>      People complain that Kirito is an OP Gary Stu that never loses. Some even call him edgy because of all the black. Understandable. But why the fuck does no one complain about Alucard being overpowered and edgy? The common defense is "that's the point". But since when is it ever okay, even when it's "The Point", to have a smug edgelord never have his shit get rocked?<br><br>Please, /a/nons, enlighten me.</br></br>  <br> But since when is it ever okay, even when it's "The Point", to have a smug edgelord never have his shit get rocked? <br><br>Well, one is a teenager that plays videogames and the other guy is motherfucking Dracula.</br></br></br>  Because every single female character in SAO wants Kirito's dick for no reason.  Madoka thread?<br><br>Madoka thread.</br></br>       you will never break Homura's spinal cord while slightly exposing your butt <br>Why live?</br>  <br>Neck up.</br>  <br>The hell happened to Madoka's neck?<br><br>Did she sell it?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>MadoHomu confirmed for broken as hell.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh my.</br>  Threadly reminder that Homura did nothing wrong.<br> Except violating your waifu. </br>  <br>Wide face headtilt, I suppose.</br>  <br> But Madoka isn't my waifu. </br>  <br>That's 2lewd4me<br> saved </br></br>  <br>Hey Apple. What are you watching this season?</br>  <br> too lewd <br> !GMeguca <br>Wow.<br><br><br> Honestly, when I return, this site keeps me bringing back. I haven't even been playing games. I feel more sleepy than anything else. </br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>But which Homu is Best Homu?<br><br>How are we to choose?</br></br></br>  <br>Blanket Homu is most moe Homu</br>    <br>Nice screenshot nerd</br>  <br>Nerd homu is best. Would watch anime with.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure I said that in the thread the video was posted in.<br><br><br>Yes.  I also want to see nerd Homu compete with Kyouko in DDR just to see how clumsy she is. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Akuma best Homu</br>  Homu  I guess it's a Homu thread.  Damn, this is a lot of cancer   start madoka thread <br> it becomes a cancerous circlejerk by the first post <br>Containment thread lel</br></br>  <br>We've had a lot of Homu threads lately.<br><br> I like it. Homu a best. </br></br></br>  Madoka's butt  Salvation for everyone!  <br>Madoka has a nice  dress.  I wonder what  it's made of. </br>  <br>Magical girl things.<br><br>Like hopes, and dreams.</br></br></br>  <br>Magical girl's hopes and dreams</br>  Mami and little adopted imoutos.  <br><br>Welp.</br></br>      <br>Anon, Mami's doomed to be forever romantically alone and lost her family, at least let her have a little sister she can have teaparties with and make dinner and help with homework.</br>  Mami senpai is an angel not a pedo.  <br>In all seriousness, I don't know what the hell they plan on doing with Nagisa in the future. I'm getting the suspicion that they're gonna kill her off somehow.<br><br>I don't want the cheese loli to die, though. She's too cute for that.</br></br></br>  Time for best couple in anime.  <br> You will never have to deal with a demanding cheese loli while dating Mami-sempai <br> "Anon, could you go to the store and buy us some marscapone? Nagisa ate all our cheese again and she'll be really sad if she doesn't have it to eat tonight." </br></br>  Who has the best hips  I want a life-size Mami figure that has a thigh gap I can fuck  <br>Do you think Nagisa would like Casu Marzu?<br><br>I don't think she'd like Casu Marzu.</br></br></br>  <br> Not a real Mami to have procreative sex with while holding hands </br>  <br>She has an  Abondance  of different cheese to choose.</br>   you will never go to MM Land with these cuties   <br>What a  cheesy  joke.</br>  <br>The suffering is Real.</br>  <br>Madoka never liked Homura and would never ever be with her.</br>    <br>What do you think Kyubey tastes like?<br><br>I bet he'd be completely flavorless, and kinda stringy.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, he's spongy.</br>  <br>If they do decide on killing Nagisa off then im under the suspicion that they would kill off Mami again too.</br>  <br>Why does kyoko appear to have more cans than sayaka here?</br>  <br>Kyouko will out grow everyone. Just you watch.</br>  <br>With the help of your semen.</br>  <br>NO!</br>  <br>But apple, Liches don't grow.</br>  <br>I don't think Kyouko had her apples since her starting days as a magical girl.</br>  <br>I'm not sure I follow you. She's clearly seen eating apples during the series.<br><br>Unless you were using apples as a euphemism for something, in which case please clarify, for I am not the brightest of people.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's embarrassing.</br>  <br>Is it a euphemism for dicking? because if it is then I don't think she's had one of those period, nor can I foresee it happening ever, unless Sayaka-chan has been Sayaka-san this entire time, in which case I will be a bit creeped out.<br><br>Is it a euphemism for dicking?</br></br></br>  <br> Her b-breasts you baka. When she started off as a magical girl she didn't have them.  This means that magical girls can grow.</br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>Well, that should have been kind of obvious, huh...<br><br>as an aside, I was not aware that Kyouko's father was Brock.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait a goddamn minute here<br><br>It's been proven that Magical Girls can alter their physical bodies via magic, right? Like how they heal and stuff?<br><br>Who's to say Kyouko didn't just help herself along with some subtle sorcery?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't make me post like that again.<br><br>Brocks hair is black.<br><br><br>That's healing. Also  Mami is the same thing. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mami's Mamis were a lie the entire time </br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Mami's are real like the others.</br>  So yeah, Kyouko is the best.  <br>Her drills were fake, why should we believe the Mamis are too?<br><br>Do you think she'll eventually teach Nagisa how to do that? That'd be TERRIBLE and/or great, depending on your personal tastes.</br></br></br>  <br>She had her drills during the accident. Mami's mammies are real.  Why am I debating this? </br>  <br>Apple-chi is making himself doki doki~</br>  <br>Shut up !HOMU!</br>  <br>nyaa~</br>    Reminder that Kyouko didn't accomplish much of anything in Rebellion.      <br>Wow, that is one tiny Kyubey.<br><br>What is this, a contract for ants?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit that's funny.</br>  Truly a girl of immense beauty.  This was supposed to be a thread for the CHARACTER Madoka, not the show itself you shitposting waifufags who can't go a second without posting your waifu.  <br>Standard homu is still top tier homuhomu<br><br>Mfw i wake up to another homu thread.</br></br></br>  <br>OP here, It's a thread for the show. I just used Madoka because, well, It's Puella Magi MADOKA Magica.<br><br>Plus I haven't seen much actual talk of Madoka herself, so I thought that'd be nice.<br><br>On the subject of Madoka, why do you think Tatsuya remembered her? Is he just fucking amazing like that?<br><br>Is he gonna be the one to defeat Akuma Homura and restore Madokami to power?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuya remembers her, I think. I don't think he can defeat Homura what with there only being magical girls as well as Kyubey can't do shit for now. He also can't contract boys. Now, so anon can stop crying.</br>  <br>Oh wait, I misread that. Anyway Tatsuya's young mind might be why he remembers her.</br>  <br>Does anyone else have a feeling that in S2 if it ever gets made. Hitummy somehow becomes the new enemy, causing homu and girls to team up to take down their mutual fiend. Because god hitumtum would be way worse than god homu. I have faith thr green will not disappoint</br>  <br> Implying Tatsuya Motherfucking Kaname needs a contract to be enough of a badass to slay a demon and resurrect a goddess <br><br>But I do wonder if Tatsuya remembers the old timelines even still, what with Homura's new world and everything.<br><br> As a side note, I kinda wanna see Hitomi become a Magical Girl just for kicks. She can have gauntlets for a weapon and everything. I mean shit, we got Nagisa, why not? </br></br></br></br></br>  This thread is going to hit image cap, Our Goddess demands it!  <br>Wait, shit, what's the image cap on /a/? I lack familiarity in this subject.</br>  <br>I doubt it, unless Hitomi gets desperate for Kyousuke that she is willing to make any contract.<br><br><br>You know, maybe that's how Madoka will remember. Maybe Tatsuya will do something that makes Madoka remember about who she is because Tatsuya remembered her after she became LoC so who's to say he doesn't remember the world before Homu's rewrite?<br><br> spoiler <br>Same.<br><br><br>250</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is exactly it. Kyo being kyo starts getting closer to sayaka and other girls turns out he is the guy in the school every girl wants or something. Although he is oblivious to this, and innocently plays along when other girls make moves. This leads hitumtum in to a fit of helpless teenage rage. Frustrated that she is powerless to change anything and keep the one thing she loves. In comes qb who offeres her a unique contract with op powers. In exchange she must destroy homu. Hitumtum now high on her new op powers and low on sanity becomes the next threat. Forcing the other girls and homu to put aside their differences to stop the green fiend. Before she takes over everything.</br>  <br> It ends with Hitomi winning, allowing Kyubey to bring back the witch system, and turning the tables on Homura, stripping her of her cherished love for Madoka, and resetting the universe back at the start of the month for the six trillionth time. <br> And during all of this, everyone forgot all about Kyouske and he winds up hanging out with Nakazawa for a while, doing cool things that do not impact the plot in any significant way. </br></br>  <br>kyosuke and nakazawa spin off when?</br>  <br> implying Kyousuke would hit on anything other than his violin. <br><br>shit fanfiction is shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The true Homura</br>  Does anyone know any good  Non-H  Madoka doujins?  <br>All that's been proven is that they can heal injuries and defects</br>  <br> Kyosuke is your standard, oblivious visual novel protagonist-esque guy who frequently makes unassumingly small mistakes or poor decisions which snowball into zany shenanigans <br> Nakazawa is an otherwise normal guy who coincidentally happens to have just the right kind of situational skill/training/knowledge required to resolve short term problems, but always somehow winds up getting him into a slightly worse situation than he was previously in, until no amount of snowboarding practice or having a rich uncle who owns a biplane can save him now <br> Together, they fight crime <br><br>I actually kind of want this now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>post the image, you can't leave me hanging anon kun!</br>  <br>You brought this upon yourself</br>  <br> They keep narrowly and unknowingly avoiding running into anything magical <br> We see the cast doing magical girl stuff in the background, always just beyond their sight </br></br>  <br>This is precisely why the search filter on sadpanda exists.</br>  <br>worst mistake of the day. Never will ask for lewd magicas again... Seriously Why can't i ever find magica doujin that doesn't involve fucking futa or that shit. Im done, im so fucking done. Thank you for showing me the error in my ways.</br>  <br>Ought to keep your mouth shut then.</br>  <br>will do. brb going to kill my self</br>  <br> Homura keeps secretly securing their prolonged existence without them knowing because she figures that letting these dipshits die like bitches would make Madoka sad <br> Hitomi keeps calling Kyosuke in the middle of a panicked chase scene or something and get's blown off. Every time. </br></br>  Would you want to see The Different Story get an OVA?  <br>More Madoka is always good, so yes.</br>  <br>Why not?<br><br>Hell, give Oriko one too, why dontcha.</br></br></br>  <br>Other than the gag manga, there's only two spinoffs I don't think should get the OVA treatment. <br><br>But if they did adapt these two /a/ and /u/ would be very pleased.</br></br></br>  <br> Casu Marzu <br> basically rotten cheese full of living maggots </br></br>  Reminder  <br>I have limburger cheese that's 6 months past it's expiration date.<br><br>That's rotting cheese that's rotted 6 months longer than people who enjoy eating rotten cheese care to eat. I'm afraid to open it.</br></br></br>  <br>I do not understand how or why people could even consider shit like that food, let alone delicacies.</br>  <br> He also can't contract boys <br> can't <br><br>Nobody said that, though. They probably just know that it wouldn't be as efficient.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2deep4u</br>    <br>Kyubey simply chooses not to contract with boys because a.) girls are more hysterical than boys and b.) otaku feel no compassion for shotas.</br>  Are you ready?  <br>I wish we had gotten a Different Story movie over The Rebellion Story. <br>But yes, this scene animated would be great.</br></br>  <br>If it aint one of the Homu, it's gonna be Nakazawa. I know this.</br>  shit animer  <br> Homulilly kills Moemura and Madokami <br>It's like I'm really watching Rebellion!</br></br>    <br>Good night, sweet witch</br>  <br>Nakazawa is a she? You pervert.</br>  <br> Nakazawa brings down Homulily </br>  <br> Everyone knows Madoka Magica for the suffering <br> The spinoffs still try to go for the bait and switch with happy covers </br></br>  <br>I told ya it was gonna be Nakazawa.<br><br><br> Mami and Nagisa teamwork <br>Heartwarming.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oi, what's this game called?</br>  <br>Brantsteele Hunger Games Simulator<br><br><br>The Zombies are finally showing up.<br><br><br> I also accidentally made Hitummy a boy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>This keeps getting better.</br></br>  <br>Shit, Nagisa is getting pretty badass.</br>  <br>Mumi no ;_;</br>  <br> Mami got eaten <br><br>Christ, this really is turning out like the actual show.</br></br></br>  <br>Mumi-san!<br>Got eaten again.</br></br>  <br> Mami gets eaten again <br><br>I don't believe in coincidences.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hothead sure loves pushing people off of cliffs.</br></br>  <br><br>The irony is that the avatar I used has Mami eating a cake and The Cake then lured things to eat Mami.

This presumably takes place after the post-credits sequence of episode 12 of the anime. <br><br>Now I initially thought that the manga artist had screwed themselves over a bit come Rebellion, but:<br><br> "During her witch transformation, when Kyubey asks Homura 'isn't this the happiness you wished for?', it connects to the final scene of the third volume of the original manga. Homura sheds her braids and glasses and runs happily after Madoka, but the dress-wearing Homura enters, pistol in hand, and shoots the old Homura in the head." <br><br>Absolutely fucking brutal imagery. I'm not quite sure what to make of the old manga ending now in terms of metaphor vs reality, but holy hell that Rebellion scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Candeloro died of thirst.<br><br>Kazuko, QB, Kyouko, and Ophelia are the final four.</br></br></br></br>    <br> Kazuko <br> Kyubey <br> Kyouko <br> Ophelia <br> Nakazawa <br><br> Final Four <br><br>Erm...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally shortened the length of the universe by a few billion years<br><br>did everything wrong</br></br></br>  <br>And Nakazawa is still alive, derp<br><br>Smugbey lures Ophelia to level ground.

Is such a thing even feasible?<br><br>This is a quandary that is beyond us...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Nerd Homu takes second place.</br>  mfw homu thread to find new homu pics for my homu folder.  <br>moemura is defiantly a top tier homu. her innocence and frail nature makes her perfect.</br>  <br>im also certain nerd homu is has most lewd potential. even more so than akuma</br>  <br>I think all Homus are lewd. it's just in their nature.</br>  <br>Well duh, she's a canon slut.</br>      <br>cutest witch</br>  <br>Not to mention they're targeting lolicons with those outfits. Suzune looks like fucking Black Rock Shooter while Kazumi looks like a stripper.</br>  <br>This doujin and it's sequels/prequels are amazing.</br>  fluff  What the hell are doing?<br><br>Do little girls really do those kind of things?<br><br>wtf man</br></br></br></br>  <br>wow anon spoiler that lewd image!

My goodness, you've grown!.  go away /tv/<br><br> before you get bullied </br></br>  So I was watching Kill La Kill and suddenly...<br>Isn't that Shinichi and Satomi from Parasyte on the left, or am I going crazy</br>  <br>Why? <br><br>Can someone explain? I'm confused</br></br></br>  <br>It was the same universe all along, Kill La Kill was a prequel.</br>  <br>It's called a reference. These happen in anime sometimes.</br>  <br><br>I don't see any problem. Kill la Kill is full of references characters here and there.</br></br>  Mfw  Any other anon also feel old when seiyuus you like are becoming younger than you?  Aoi was born into voice acting. Molded by it. She didn't see a world beyond anime until she was already a woman, and by that time it was blinding.  <br> Aoi old blogs from when she was a little girl are still alive and intact </br>  <br>Her fingernail is beautiful.</br>  <br>Whats the evidence of them being Burikko?</br>  <br> Aoi was a little girl when Wii was out <br>I feel old</br></br>  Hey /a/ <br>Why are harem anime so boring?<br>Why are there so many?</br></br>  <br>neck beard shut in faggot detected</br>  <br>So there's a genre out their you're not into.<br>Sounds to me like that's normal.<br>Kind of like some people don't like:<br> mecha <br> shoujou-ai <br> shounen-ai <br> etc <br><br>I like harem anime for the most part. Charlotte's most likely going to be a harem anime, and I'm liking it so far. Rokka No Yuusha is probably going to be a harem anime and I'm enjoying it.<br><br>Regarding past shows in the harem genre I think are great.<br>Oda Nobuna No Yabou<br>Maoyuu Maou Yuusha<br>Utawarerumono<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127994039#p127995593">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think Harem anime are cancer because one girl eventually winning means suffering for everyone else. And Harem ends are degrading in my opinion.    <br>I wish the omnibus route became more widely used, honestly.<br><br>It did wonders for Amagami.<br><br>If given the right number of episodes, or if something isn't jampacked with girls, it would be perfect for a show.</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
