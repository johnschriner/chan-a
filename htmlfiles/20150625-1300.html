[ Will Salad awaken the rinnegan due to the mixing of her Uchiha and Uzumaki blood?  fuck off.   Do we really need a new thread? Just wait until the chapter comes out or else we'll look like a general.       Sakura is the mum, but that doesn't need to be biological. No one denies that for all intent and purposes Sakura raised Salad as her own and influenced her the most. But that is not proof for blood relation.   Honestly, man? If the very last page is Sarada punching the ground and cracking it, chances are this may be the first time Sarada has ever displayed super strength.  In other words, unless observation was enough or it's going to be revealed that Sakura helps train Sarada, Kishi might be doing that to say she actually has Sakura's genes.          Not this shit again. Senju/Uchiha blood alone isn't enough for Rinnegan you retarded nigger    but it is     Kishi might be doing that to say she actually has Sakura's genes.   Does it mean that Sakura is a secret Senju?      No, you need actual Asura and Indra blood, to recreate Hagoromo's power. That's why Madara could get it but Obito not.      Hanabi and Konohamaru marriying.   No, never, ever. Out with your shit taste.    Sarada losing her Uchiha name   That's not how clan systems work.  Hinata "lost" hers because she's not the Hyuga heir, though. But if Naruto wasn't the Hokage or wasn't famous. He would had adopted the Hyuga name, as Neji stated in the SD spin-off.               yeah, are we supposed to believe that pink shit is tsunade's secret biological daughter?     More like Sarada got that super chakra control that Sakura have.     Bort can pull off some fucking Rasengan Chidori Zeus lightning bolt shit by the time he's 12    Salad gets 1 tomoe and punches things really hard  And they're supposed to be rivals how?       No.  You need to have them have Indra and Ashura's chakra with Hagoromo, which means you nees to have them be the literal reincarnations of them.  And the current incarnations, Naruto and Sasuke are alive.       "EVIL is dead. She's not here anymore! But through my spoilers, and in my heart, she lives on in me! Trolling the Sakura cucks to pierce the heavens! Even if their salty tears become my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I'm Rai I'm not my sister Evil! I am myself! Rai the Leaker! Certain Kill!...Giga...CUCK... BREAKER!!!!"    Anyone who ACTUALLY thinks sakura won't turn out the biological mom is a moron   I dunno. Anybody who thinks Kishi will be perfectly predictable in his writing either is the biggest moron I think.  I hope for landwhale tears, but I can deal with any outcome. Remember that for SS a winning scenario is just that pink and sauce have an incredibly distant relationship for dubious reasons of mission obligations.        Come the fuck on    All the talk about cucking by /a/ is just for getting on /ss/ fangirl's nerves, the reality is probably much simpler. Especially since none of us could truly imagine Sasuke getting an erection for anything or anyone.   Most likely. Let's just say for the sake of argument this isn't all a ruse, that Sarada is biologically Karin's either by way of experiment or birth, does anyone seriously believe that Kishi would NOT end this all in a way where Sasuke is forgiven for whatever wrongs he may have done and Sakura looks like the most perfect mother Sarada could have had?  He's already trying to play off Sasuke's complete absence as not that big a deal considering the nature of his "top sikrit mission" even though it makes no sense that he couldn't have at least tried to contact Sarada or Sakura once in awhile when he sent reports to Naruto. And he's already gone through a painstaking effort to make Sakura looks a gentle yet fierce mother hen.  Even if Sasuke did actually do it with Karin in the end, Kishi will find some way to make it look like Sasuke din do nuffin'         Reminder that not all Sakurafags are crazy and that she's great in The Last and Gaiden even if you didn't like her in the main series.   Is Rai trolling?    That wasn't what he was referring to. He was talking about the onion's backstab.    No, the "not Sakura side" means that the Shins Jr betray Shin Sr, but not to go to Sakura's side    If Sarada's super punch were evidence of her lineage then Sarada wouldn't have had doubts in the first place.     Face it, Kishi has delayed any talk of Salad's genes and instead tried to show that her legal parents care about her, and that she resemble them in ways that matters. This is expected as we already know they are going to be still together in the movie. But Kishi is not settling the genetic thing this week, he just showed the family element.      Not bad chapter.    No way this is ending in 1 more chapter.    Sarada's fighting style...same as her mama!    Shin father betrayed by Shin jr....    I never said Sakura's side...    Of course their own side.   No Rinnegan this week.    Sasuke cares about his wife.   Sarada smiles looking the two of them.                   You could have prevented this   Please refrain from ever posting like that again. Thank you.    Not crazy, maybe, but all of them have shit taste for liking such a terrible cunt.    No.    You're wrong. All adopted children are treated like shit by their parents. No parent will love their adopted child as much as their blood child. Don't disagree with me you're wrong. Adopted children are better off aborted.     She was bretty gud in The Last, but pretty shit in Gaiden except in the flashbacks I guess.  At any point in the story has the justification for her feelings for sauce ever been given? There's never been anything I've seen to indicate anything but a dumb preteen crush held onto with retard level tenacity.         does anyone seriously believe that Kishi would NOT end this all in a way where Sasuke is forgiven for whatever wrongs he may have done and Sakura looks like the most perfect mother Sarada could have had?  Basically yeah, either way SS stays canon. It's just that SS fangirls have this romantic fantasy that doesn't match the actual manga, so even though SS is canon they still complain that they didn't get the exact thing they wanted.     fuck on, boku wa onahole    At the very least I'm willing to accept that a minority of sakurafags are sane. Other than that, sakurafags are fucked in the head. If you say something nice about another female char, expect the usual "BUT SAKURA IS BETTERER!!1!". They literally think the series revolves around her vagina.  Actually, scratch the "another female char" part, its Hinata. Sakurafags have a extreme inferiority complex regarding Hinata, they hate her guts.     Does Naruto died   From which filler you got this?     Where does it say that?      And your complete post is just plain fucking wrong, Bloodfag.    Sakura's fighting style is the least objectionable part of her character.  Unfortunately, Taijutsu users fucking suck in Naruto.     With some notable exception.    Sarada's fighting style is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura's    Boruto's fighting style is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke's   Kishi really loves that edgelord.       coming right up    Well he is autistic.    No.  He got downgraded to Damsel in Distress.        Well you are a nigger     didn't kill   will never walk again (would've died had jesus not taken the wheel)   implying all taijutsu users aren't absolutely shit tier.       Hes eating chips with Chouchou    Taijutsu with Sharingan might be decent.    And Sasuke is the one to rescue him.  Guess without editors Kishi would have killed Naruto and made Sasuke the MC.      He literally saved the world just by being good enough to fight Uchiha Madara for 10 minutes.  And I'm not talking about edo tensei Uchiha Madara.        Basically yeah, either way SS stays canon.   Exactly. But I think some people were blinded by their hatred of SS and/or its fandom that they didn't stop to think that no matter what Sasuke did, SS would remain canon and we'd be expected to believe Sasuke cares about Sakura even with very little evidence. It's just the awkwardness of Kishi's writing this whole episode and this pairing is hilarious in that he expects us to believe Sasuke really does love Sakura even though he's never there for her and may have had a kid with someone else, and this is after he tried to kill her multiple times.  Would anybody be surprised if Sasuke admitted to actually having sex with Karin and dumping her kid on Sakura for some ten or more years while he ran around waiting for the plot to fall into his lap and then just said "Sorry"? That's just as believable to me as Kishi writing that Sarada having Karin DNA is all a misunderstanding.          Anticipated such a family would eventually appear  How does that make any sense? They knew an incarnation of Indra or Asura would eat part of the other one? Even then, "family" makes absolutely no sense in that context.    I wish naruto had an eye technique   So why did Madara hide underground until he was an old man on his death bed to do all the shit that he did?    Its just dumbasses not seeing the big picture. Sarada has perfect chaka control, she'll be able steal/copy more shit and make her own   If Sarada got a mangekyo sharingan, what should it look like and what special ability should it grant?      literally a general  MODS        Stupid Boruto! I'm going to become the Hokage!   Then I'm going to fuck the Hokage.   w-wait what       Dude, Guy is easily in the top 5 full power Madara&gt;Kaguya&gt;Jesus&gt;Sauce&gt;8-gates Guy&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Obito&gt;Hashirama&gt;doesn't matter anymore     Sakura had perfect chakra control and she was the biggest jobber in the series.     Ah, forgot about that.  But since all he needed was Hashirama's DNA, that is, his genes, shouldn't that mean that if you have the DNA of both transmigrants, you could get a Rinnegan?      They called her fucking salad    she'll be able steal/copy more shit and make her own  Not with 1 tomoe she won't.      Exactly. But I think some people were blinded by their hatred of SS and/or its fandom that they didn't stop to think that no matter what Sasuke did, SS would remain canon and we'd be expected to believe Sasuke cares about Sakura even with very little evidence  I don't think any of us is blinded. It is the SS fangirls who are acting like lunatics because their fantasy of a perfect nuclear family was dashed. And most of us enjoy laughing at them as they tried to deny reality. The fact that they could be so crazy despite Kishi keeping their pairing intact is just hilarious to watch.     Niggastream.   Look at the second panel. He only got the Rinnegan and thus the ability to not get his shit pushed in by Hashirama if he tried anything when he was old.      niggerstream translation, was just the first I could come up with  He unlocked the Rinnegan when he was very old. And he never recovered from his last fight with Hashirama, dude fucked him up good       It's probably the same principle by which Boruto gets the whiskers.  It's chakra gene magic.        Kishi trying to be like Toriyama naming his characters after foods     Nope, nothing. A classic example of bad writing - the love at first sight trope.    more Goddamn mooninites   Where the fuck is Piccolo when you need him to nuke the moon?      Hah, if anything, its usually the opposite. My barren aunt didn't travel all the way to China for a baby she was only going to half love. If anything, my cousins were spoiled by them since they had to go through so much trouble to get them.      she was the biggest jobber in the series.   She tied against Ino and won against Sasori.  Kiba, Lee and Hinata are way worse jobbers.        You only need strong emotions, not just hatred to unlock the tomoes     Main character is literally named after a fish cake ramen topping   only just now noticing Kishimoto aping Toriyama  Come on, anon.       Guy is easily top 5!   (provided he kills himself)  Nah, taijutsu users are so bottom of the barrel that they have to suicide to be of any use. also  madara above kaguya  Nope.         Nobody likes adopted children in Japan.  If you're parents can't take care of you, you'll spend your whole life in an orphanage.        But since all he needed was Hashirama's DNA  He didn't need his genes, he needed his tissue/his cells     Not proportionate to their panel time they're not.   No, a Narutard thread will not be the most active thread on this board.    Why do people keep freaking out about this quote?        &gt;madara above kaguya   Nope.  He was tho. While she had more raw power she didn't know how to fight for shit. He basically asshandled the entire alliance and the god duo for a good 150 chapters while she only lasted about 30       why don't people pay attention to the anime I like waaaah  Naruto threads have been the most popular threads for months now. Get over it.     sex partners    Sakura barely has enough fights to consider her a jobber, and she was on the winning side of her biggest one.    Your daddy left you so you grew up to be a beta male mommied boy.    It's funny     35 posters   active  Anon pls       won against Sasori   "she" won in the same regard that a condom has sex      Sasuke smiles at Sarada  Oh god next week is gonna be a shit strom isnt it. Its too fucking comfy.     Jesus and Sauce are completely equal.   What the fuck would Gai do against full power Obito ?        Nah, taijutsu users are so bottom of the barrel that they have to suicide to be of any use.  Keep baiting fgt. Just get over the fact that Guy pushed your husbandos shit in for good     This makes more sense. Salad's skills seem more applicable in the bedroom than the battlefield.   Why I can't drop this shit? This is like a horrible guilty pleasure for me.  Someone help me kill myself. I should have dropped this turd after the Rescue Sasuke Arc.      It's not that she didn't know, how to fight it's more over that naruto and sasuke were given the macguffin needed to seal her. so without that macguffin kaguya insta wins.       replying to obvious b8       Because you like it you fucking faggot.     Tied against Ino  wow it's fucking nothing  won against Sasori  No, that was Chiyo.         It's like eating a big mac, anon. You know it's bad for you. You know it's not quality by any stretch of the imagination. But damn it you love feeling that ball of grease roll around your tongue.    Try to occupy your head with other things, I guess. Sooner of later you'll forget about it. Also, thank God you can use the old numbers captcha now, fuck picking salad    Seems that way. Maybe Kishi felt he needed 2 weeks of SS pandering before delivering the final blow.    This is what delusional Narutards actually believe.     macguffin  tvtropes pls go Also, they already got Hagoromo's powers against Madara who still managed to fuck their shit sideways      I like Hinata anon.    It was 2 against 1. By that logic, Hinata was on the winning side of her fight with Pain.     Guy pushed your husbandos shit in for good   he broke a few of madara's ribs then proceeded to roll over and die.  MIGHTY MIGHT GUY AMIRITE.      Oops wrong pic. Lol my bad anons.     Try to occupy your head with other things, I guess. Sooner of later you'll forget about it.   Nope doesn't work. I was able to drop shit like Bleach, Supernatural, and Korra but not this. Nothing works.        full power Madara was way above Obito. Guy kicked him around like a punching ball. Obito was only immune to ninjutsu, taijutsu worked just fine    But both Sasuke and Naruto were alive when Pain was alive.    Im thinking this apart of the graduation test,its all a genjustu. But i might just be crazy     Oh god next week is gonna be a shit strom isnt it.    what makes you say that?  honestly, I'm a little upset that Sarada is probably not going to hold a grudge against Sasuke.  He keeps getting away with everything.            muh Sakura didn't do anything in the Sasori fight meme     Hinata...   Don't worry, they'll get deleted after Gaiden is over, just like how the ongoing threads were deleted after the main series was over.     There is no final blow. Its over  Then you're in the minority of sakurafags       Can someone post worksafe pictures of Hinata with big boobs?  I say worksafe because the clothing covering the nipples makes it hotter     They still get deleted now. The only reason why Coolest Janitor doesn't seem to delete as many now is because more people want Naruto threads up at the moment and he just gives up for a while.     It's either Naruto, JoJo or Yahari. Pick your poison anon     What the hell is going on in this picture? Twincestuous threesome?     Okay.   Soon.       After the Gaiden there's the movie in August. But after that it's pretty much over as far as we know.   Unless that "secret" announcement 33 days from now says otherwise.       honestly, I'm a little upset that Sarada is probably not going to hold a grudge against Sasuke.  She would likely understand that Sasuke IS a shitty father, but not intentionally so. And that he would want to be a better dad if only he knows how. So she can't get too mad at him for being incompetent.     How big do you want them?    /a/ has me paranoid. I think they just wont have that as close a relationship that Sarada wanted,she wont hate him though    Paz...    The Hinata/Sakura friendship is cute.     still thinking it's just a rogue janitor  I can't help but laugh at your idiocy.     huge    And then she sees him getting all buddy buddy with Burrito and gets her 2nd tomoe.    Guy didn't die though Face it, Madara is dead and didn't get what he wanted, Guy is still alive, and though he can't use his legs, he doesn't care because he can use his hands, so he's as happy as a clam.      biggest jobber in the series.  You have to be strong to job.  Sakura isn't a jobber she's a loser.        &gt;he broke a few of madara's ribs then proceeded to roll over and die.  more than anyone else managed to do. He was going against what was basically a god and wasn't even considered kage-level before that      We got Sasuke saying in Part 1 that he would rather die trying to protect her than see her die and numerous other small hints.  So somehow he cares and then he doesn't fucking come home. The way Kishi writes it makes 0 sense.   kill her  To be fair most of the time he attacked her it was after she tried to do the same.   I would be pretty surprised if Sasuke just randomly "cheated" on her. Why? Whats the point for him? Since when does Sasuke care about Karin? If Karin is the mother then there must some kind of other explanation but its definitely possible.               Sakura   a jobber  That word doesn't mean what you think it means.      You asked for it.    cowtits. huge, disgusting cowtits    agoromo's powers against Madara who still managed to fuck their shit sideways Madara was getting fucked up by naruto and sauce before kaguya took his body. he legit ran away in fear to steal obitos rhinnigan because of how bad naruto and sasuke was fucking him up.      Sasori himself considers Sakura to have been part of the fight.       No one gets fucking banned for making these threads. No one but you and the janitor cares about the shitty standards of this dead board, retard-kun.  This board die the moment we let tumblr approved shows like Free and reddit meme shows like KLK and SnK on here. Naruto is just back on here again to shit on the corpse.       Previous thread  Summaries still happening  Reminder that Yoshino is a slut      I am a wizard   Happy 30 years of virgiñity /a/non.   I wonder if it's not too late for summary anon.   Reminder that Shiori a lewd. Lewd!    Stop this sexualization of DALs    I should be OK for 3-4 hours more (maybe 3). Let's see if I could finish it.    Okay, thanks for all the work!    I see, then it sould be fine.     ñ  Cita una viva     Good to hear that, I really appreciate this summary.    If you want to write "Date a Live" in spanish, it would be: "Cita en Vivo"    Ratatoskr is filled with assholes  Let's just kill both DEM and Ratatoskr members together.    with Dainslaif    Wrong this anon is correct     If it's Shiori it's fine. She's used goods whose already done it with 8 other girls after all.    Kill the shidou!   Not possible, it was designed to kill Shidou and only Shidou.    Vivo seria lo correcto si fuera Date Alive. En este caso sin embargo, Date A Live, se traduciría "literalmente" como "Cita Una Viva"    I wonder... I'm from Spain after all, so I guess I should have more experience... that is what you get when translating it on google translate but you shouldn't trust that translator too much.    Seriously, whoever didn't see this coming must be stupid. They were too shady to be good guys.

Es una traducción literal, es correcta, literalmente pero no "traducido"     using google translate to translate spanish  That's even worse than using it to translate English.      el quiere una traducción libre  Porque no vas y le chupa la picha a los de commie?  En todo caso, fui yo el que "tradujo" la vara en el primer post.       It's a satellite who fires a laser beam. Even if it's designed to kill Shidou, it's not like the laser beam only reacts to Shidou's body alone. I'd say we try firing Dainslaif, kill those retards and hope they die. If not, we'll let Kurumi eat them    What if it has only a shoot? and Kotori said it was designed to kill only Shidou so maybe it only reacts to him.   How come she's so best?    It's even worse than that.  Trying to use Google Translate to translate MADE UP English to Spanish.      All big organizations are evil   If they could do that I don't think the Fraxinas would need Kotori's power to use its strongest weapon.    - That's why Woodman decided to give the access to &lt;Dainslaif&gt; only to Kotori, even if that means he is pushing her to shoot her own brother. Woodman tell everyone to calm down in a calm voice. Even though the situation might be the worst, it doesn't mean they're out of choices already.  - Douglas and Almsted make a dubious face. Clayton make an angry face and raise up his voice at Woodman asking him what would he do to improve the situation. Woodman then tell him he don't know either, but as long as Itsuka Commander don't give up, he also don't plan to.  - Woodman look at the three with sharp eyes. The three then make a dissatisfied face. It's no doubt that they thought he is being unreasonable. But for Woodman, he think there is still a chance for Shidou to recover.  - The problem is that Woodman don't think the three in front of him are worthy enough to know the reason behind the 'chance'. What Woodman could do right now is to buy Kotori some time.  - Woodman then say to them he understand he is making an unreasonable request, so in exchange he offer to give them 1% of Asgard Electronics' stock he own every single minute spent.         hecho arriba     my Kin!    - None of the three answered right away. Asgard Electronics is the only other company than DEM who can make Realizer. It is also the back behind &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s technology and also Woodman's lifeline.  - To them, the deal sounds too good to be true. Woodman laugh inside his head, that the longer they hesitate, the more time he could made for Kotori. However, the alarm indicating the Spirit Power raising interrupted their thought.  - Clayton choked and yell that there is no way to open the Path and there is no way to stop the berserk of Shidou. He then take out a small terminal from his pocket. - Woodman saw that and choked. It is the same terminal that Woodman and Kotori have, the key to &lt;Dainslaif&gt;. Clayton asked where he got that. Clayton answered him with an old proverb "be prepared and have no regrets" saying there is always a way out somewhere. Woodman called him to stop, but Clayton didn't listened. He then pushed the button without a second thought.   ◇         Nah, following JRPGs logic Ratatoskr would be the good guys if DEM was an empire and they the rebels.     1%  Seriously?     Vale, vale, tranquilo. Solo doy mi punto de vista. Comparto tu opinión con lo de: "Date a Live" y Date Alive". Pero no te enojes    this asshole    That's nearly 2 hours he could buy for her.    and here we go.     Woah. Kaguya bros are active tonight. I like. Kaguya is my favorite twin and is in my top 5.     No anon, no.  Ahora vas a tener que tomar responsabilidad por enojarme.     1% each minute.   Tactical death lazer inbound   Waiting for Phantom    Phantom soon?    I love you Anons   I want Yoshino to sit on my lap while I feed her cupcakes and we watch TV.   If by 2hrs you mean just a few of minutes then yeah you are right.    Damn.    Reine when?     mfw Kotori trusted in this organization     trust no one     Will Shidou ever find out Ratatoskr tried to kill him?     Not even yourself!    Dat trust in Kotori. Woodman has my vote for next selections of executives.     These guys are not better than DEM.     maybe, then he will like fuck you guys I do this on my own now     Not even my mama?     Reine for President    Stop touching my waifu    I'm still waiting for the scene where he finds out about Mana's condition.   Thank goodness. About time shidou died   death is the only way out     implying you can kill him     ...not even your mama!    Mana's reaction will be even worse, first DEM lied to her and now Ratatoskr is trying to kill Shidou.    Mana is best imouto     How much is left?     MANA ISN'T AN IMOUTO. KOTORI IS   Pic related   Go to bed Kotori.    The whole book? About 10%.    Mana is his real little sister    Kotori pls.   Mana needs more screen time!      This went quite as expected. Guess that the plot is really going to go forward rather sooner than later.       This works better for Kurumi and her clones, especially rooftop.  ;_;      He then take out a small terminal from his pocket.   - Woodman saw that and choked   Didn't see that coming at all. Well, let's see what could possibly go wrong with this.       Yeah but it's almost over if what this guy said is true     Star fest Kurumi was best Kurumi    - Kotori wiped the tear with the back of her hands while sniffing her nose and say in a little desperate voice that they should laugh at her. She acted all high-and-mighty and this is how she looked now. - Origami then shook her head and say to her that she is glad Kotori is Shidou's sister and encourage her since there should be still some way.  - All other Spirits also do the same with everyone telling her they will help. However, the next moment, an alarm rang from the terminal she dropped on the ground earlier interrupting everyone's voice.   '— &lt;Dainslaif&gt; activation code detected. Commercing attack to the target.'  - Kotori choked at the voice and pick up the terminal. Origami looked into the terminal with a shock on her face. She asked Kotori what happened and was it activate because of the impact from her dropping it earlier.  - Kotori tell her the terminal isn't made so you could easily mis-manipulate it. Kotori don't know why &lt;Dainslaif&gt; was activated out of sudden and tried to cancel. However, it's already too late.  - The next moment after a light flashed in the sky like a shooting star, Kotori and others' views are covered with light. "Shidou!!" Kotori shouted all she could and extend her hand toward Shidou.  - However Shidou's fate can't be changed by just those action. Shidou disappeared with the light. The attack hollowed out the ground. The impact blown Kotori and others who were standing nearby — or so she thought that would happen.  - But it didn't. "Eh…?" Kotori who stiffen her body blinked her eyes few times before she raise her face up. Other spirits also do the same. A wall made of Spirit Power is created above them, or more accurately, above Shidou, protecting him from &lt;Dainslaif&gt;'s attack. - Kotori widen her eyes. She thought for a second that Shidou used his Spirit Power to block that attack, however, that is different.  [—Phew, that was dangerous.]                 That's almost nothing, I don't want it to end.   I want to marry Kotori.    Didn't see that coming at all. Well, let's see what could possibly go wrong with this.   implying this wasn't going to happen from the start     Yuugou shoukan!   Oh god here we go   Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice  Reminder that Mio is Shidou's and Mana's childhood friend who was captured by DEM along with Mana  Picture related, Mio and Tohka being sluts       Phantom time!    incoming Phantom=Reine    I never trusted ratatoskr since the beginning considering the bad support they gave to Shidou.    slut and a retard    WHERE'S REINE?    It's happening!    I know, just making a joke. Even in Volume 2-ish, it was stated that some of the higher ups were shady characters.    Other then you know not just doing this for laughs but to prevent a worse disaster from happening. It's not like they know there is going to be some last minute plot device that keeps Shidou from going boom.    but Mio has long hair and Rinne is Phantom     It's time...    Miku is worst girl  Mio's profile page   How can she be best imouto? What kind of an imouto doesn't know what her onii-chan is involved in? Only Kotori does and is there for him.    but they are doing this for personal gain, ready to dispose of Shidou and the spirits if necessary.   Kaguya a cutie   Phantom is true end   REINE= Phantom   STATS=Happening    Not that guy but she trusts in Shidou willing to leave her previous organization to fight for him, she also agrees with his way of thinking.    Disgusting.  Post better quality pictures.    Reminder RU is canon   Just let him be autistic.  Yuzuru is best twin       Or maybe not.      Shes cute no matter what     Rio   Mio   Seriously Tachibana?       How can Phantom stop a Shidou going berserk? This will be good to read.        Or maybe not.  going with not      Phantom doesn't  Tohka talks to him and then hugs him and then kisses him at midnight and the magic is dispelled  REMEMBER HOW HER FORESHADOWED IT?        How strong can Phantom be if she able to stop such attack.    retard gets best moment    That sounds lame    Never said they were perfect but they aren't doing strike that will wipe out the city and Shidou is a real threat to people right now. At this point Shidou going boom does more damage then the event 30 years ago.   DEM does worse stuff for revenge on getting a papercut      Godly    Seriously? That sounds boring as fuck and here I was expecting something interesting to happen.    Author likes retard    That's because they planned to kill Shidou since the beginning, just read the summary again and you can see their true intentions.    I'm pretty sure phantom just went to prevent his death.    Phantom is the first spirit    Phantom saved Shidou but he's still out of control. Someone must stop him.    Hopefully not    That's it? I know Tohka is the main girl and all but giving him the best scene when she wasn't even relevant in the entire volume is too much.     &gt;Reminder that Mana is a placeholder and a plotdevice.   DaL really feels like it is begin don on the fly sometimes.      You mean these sluts? They are just Tachibana's failed attempts to give Origami friends.    Hopefully they stay gone forever. and the AST too.    It looks different in Japanese     AST  Who?     Author sure likes the retard    I have they only planned to kill him if he became too dangerous and I believe exploding killing himself and 10's of millions of people counts as being too dangerous    The AST is dead, now we need to get rid of DEM and the wizards.     Yoshino is a slut   Truly.      Kotori is closer, knows intimate things Mana doesn't, and is there for him in greater capacity. Also, her love is constantly maximum, and romantic at that.    Not really, they didn't even bother to find a way to keep Shidou alive and chose to kill him if something goes wrong. Elliott is the only one who acutally cares about the spirits.    Kotori: Her love is maximum    Kotori a brocon hoe     greater capacity  If by greater capacity you mean making his dates worse by giving bad advice then yeah you are right.     Mana must has been really close to Shidou if he was depressed even after the Itsuka family adopted him.    I wonder if Phantom knows about Mio and that she is very close.     not the full version     What about those girls from DAS?    Date A Strike is irrelevant in the new timeline.    Mikie a cute, Fujimura a slut.    Who?    Ok, so what do you call the whole dating to fix the problem not trying to find a way to keep him alive? Their opinion is it failed which Kotori also believed until being talked down since by tnhe looks of it Shidou is starting to go critical. Please enlightened me what other options they have to stop him from exploding and doing more damage then the event 30 years ago?    Tohka is one of his favorites after all    shame the other favorite   Kurumi  didn't get a date in this volume       I want to hug this Clock.   me too    Are you even following this conversation? What I'm saying is that chose this solution just because it coincided with their objective but they knew a disaster was bound to happen but they didn't care and decided to kill him. The point is that they didn't give a shit about Shidou's life when they went for this alternative rather than just think something else, it's not like spirits were killing people and they have been happening for 30 years.    Because she is unsealed but Origami got her date, she also another favorite.   Miku is worst girl     Damn this dude sucks!  best girl is Miku       Is Phantom evil or just a very kind spirit?   What? Kotori knows what she is doing when she is serious. The girls and Woodman knows she is excellent at what she does. Gag galgame scene are her playing around or taking chance to make things interesting. She doesn't willingly try to put him in danger she believes he would die from that would prove too much for regeneration.    Seems normal for any siblings that care/like each other.       I will forgive this as long as her arc is fucking amazing  also did Star fest even happen now that time changed?      Anti-hero  Think Godzilla.      Not evil    Yes, Origami is totally unrelated to Rooftop Kurumi    That sounds good and all but it doesn't actually work when Shidou is dating spirits.    - There is another Spirit appeared above Shidou. Actually, Kotori don't really know if that is really a Spirit. The being appeared over there has a silhouette of a human but is covered by a noise.   "You are —!"  - Kotori said with her fingers shaking. Other Spirits also have the similar reaction to Kotori, especially Miku and Origami who have met 'that' first-handed. Miku is badly shaken up. Origami stares at the noise with a cautious looks on her face. - She is the Spirit that created Spirits. The one who gave Kotori, Miku and Kotori the Sephira — &lt;Phantom&gt;. Kotori called the name, &lt;Phantom&gt; then open her mouth,  […It seems humans also do things recklessly too.] "I don't want to hear that from you!"  - &lt;Phantom&gt; jokingly said that and turned herself around. The barrier that covered above Shidou like an umbrella then disappeared. Kotori frown at &lt;Phantom&gt;'s words. - Kotori thought that she is an indirect cause that caused Shidou to become like this. Because she turned Kotori into a Spirit five years ago and make Shidou seal her, that caused him to take the risk of getting berserk.  - Thinking to that, a question then popped up in Kotori's mind. Why is &lt;Phantom&gt; appearing right now — and why did she saved Shidou from &lt;Dainslaif&gt;?  "&lt;Phantom&gt;, what are you?"  - Kotori asked, but &lt;Phantom&gt; did not answer. &lt;Phantom&gt; then looked at Shidou.  […I see, his condition is pretty dangerous. I could understand your painful determination. — But I still need him to be alive.] "W-what are you saying…"                       - Kotori raise up her voice with confusion. &lt;Phantom&gt; then came down in front of Shidou as if she don't care about the Spirit Power that whirled around him.  […Good boy.]  - &lt;Phantom&gt; said with a gentle voice and touch Shidou's forehead. The next moment, Shidou screamed and wrenched his body. He hollowed the scenery around him and continue moving in straight line to somewhere.  "S-Shido!?" "Darling!" "What did you do to Shidou!" "Agreement. The situation is becoming worse."  - &lt;Phantom&gt; breath out a sigh a little.  [—What kind of greeting is that. Even though I just gave you a chance.] "What…!?" "! Kotori! Look!"  - Kotori frown, but Tohka raised up her voice. Kotori then noticed that the Spirit Power that surrounded Shidou has become weaker.   "This is…" […From now on is your domain. I wish you a good luck. — See you later, *all my cute kids.*] "…!? What—"  - Kotori raise up her voice at &lt;Phantom&gt;'s words however &lt;Phantom&gt; did not replied. She turned over and disappeared in the air. Kotori called her a stop and tried running to her, but Yoshino tell her it is more important to save Shidou right now.  - Kotori stopped and nodded to Yoshino. Kotori then explained that Shidou's Spirit Power has now weakened a little even though she don't know what &lt;Phantom&gt; did.                            Reine best girl     […I see, his condition is pretty dangerous. I could understand your painful determination. — But I still need him to be alive.]  She "needs" him?     Is this the first time the other girls meet Phantom?    - Tohka widen her eyes at Kotori's words. Kotori nodded and tell her that though now they're one step back from the worst, it doesn't change the fact that this is desperate situation. Even though they have make their way through that Spirit Power to kiss Shidou, it's difficult for them right now to do it. - Heard that, Kaguya laughed "Kaka!" and tell her it's easy. Yuzuru agreed with her. Then then took their each other's hands and make a pose. Kotori tell them it's not easy, but both of them looked at each other and loosen their lips then trying to concentrate.  - Kaguya and Yuzuru then manifested their Limited Astral Dress. Kotori choked. Kaguya and Yuzuru are using the very last bit of Spirit Power that were left in their body for their Limited Astral Dress. - Kotori called them asking what they are planning to do but she her words mis-sentence. Even though it's dangerous to use Limited Astral Dress right now, or in worst case they might even die, there's no other way to get to him.  - Kotori then tell them with a dangerous face that judging from Natsumi's case from earlier, the longest they could be in that form is about 5 minutes. - Heard that, Yamai cheerfully laugh to Kotori saying that is enough for them. They then nodded to each other and run to the direction where Shidou is heading.  ◇           Also  "Still"  Phantom is just using shidou for her own purposes        FUSION. SCUM.    Jesus christ. Will we ever get clarity on phantom.     — See you later, *all my cute kids.*]  best mom      Phantom confirmed for mother      Tsunako    Stop Sexualization  Don't think thats possible       I don't know what to think about this?     love the twins  Kaguya's chuui       NEED HIM FOR WHAT?  DOES HE MATTER AFTER THAT? WHAT IS THE POINT OF ALL THIS DAMN IT      I know it's obvious they would save him but to do it with that amount of power is ridiculous.     Dat 'ka ka' laugh  Chuuni moe.     why do they have QUALITY like this?     Even more question, what could be Phantom's power?     it's so great     Phantom for keikaku doori  for some reason I'm feeling Kotori and the spirits might quit Ratatoskr after this, anyone else feeling that?        […From now on is your domain. I wish you a good luck. — See you later, *all my cute kids.*]   Phantom confirmed for first spirit?      same    Are you fucking retarded or just slowpoke?     Nah, how will be Kotori able to support Shidou without her position as commander?     I feel like Woodman will give some encouragement to Kotori and everyone else will just play it off like nothing happened, but will keep suspicions.    ehh they might just get rid of the guy who fired the thing    not like it really helped    We had two possible candidates for the first spirit. Shidou and Phantom but seeing how she called the spirit "her kids" makes me think she is the first spirit.    I'm new to this Show, does the main character do any fighting, or is he just spergs with the girls and get beat up? If he is just a push-over I dont think I will enjoy it very much...   I dont expect him to be as good as the MC from DxD but maybe I will be surprised?       Reminder that Yoshino is a slut   slut   for one guy   How?        True but The Fraxinas is still good for teleportation.    Yeah, nah. 8n the end, Shidou is usually the one that clears the date by being himself. But he wouldn't have gotten as far without technical help from Kotori and her crews. Kotori's iconic quote is the signal for a successful and inevitable date, bumps and shit hitting the fans is expected for this series.    MC is a chuuni edgelord, drop while you can    No, now go away.    he does do a lot of fighting actually, he's pretty strong, you should watch and see    I want to impregante Yoshino cumming buckets of semen inside her tight pussy, then lick her little clit and use some cream to put my dick on her ass and fill her inners with more semen.   Obviously every day.      If what you want is another wish fulfillment harem then read something else.    Faggot go back to your hole    Yeah he does. He gets strong     So you want it to be a generic haremshit?    <br/>  How can Kotori be this cute?   DAL is not really a battle harem and I don't think you will be able to self insert into the MC.     Nice one guys! Hopefully he falls for it!     a slut is a slut    It doesn't have a fanfic tier writing if that what you asking.     He never does really. Being stronger than some cannon fodder wizards is nothing significant.   A non-sealed spirit would kill him with 0 problems.       Haha yes it does     Flatori   Cute   Kill yourself.       That scene had me laughing so fucking hard and I usually hate that kind of antic.   Now you're trying to spread lies, but it makes me wonder what if Kurumi, Kaguya and Shido met in their chuuni phase.       At first, he starts off very weak and doesn't do any fighting. But right when he needed to fight the most, he does it. From that point on he started fightning.    The series goes full dragon ball Z   Kaguya is love   Anon, don't lie to yourself.     not wanting a pushover   coming to DAL  I don't know what to say to you. Go ahead and watch it I guess.      Yeah it's pretty good, he starts out a nobody, but at the current volume he's ridiculously strong    I want NBR Imoutos to leave.    Not really, It doesn't have an overpowered MC who gets all the bitches by doing nothing or a dark and edgy handosme boy who attracts all the bitches.    Cute and HOT.    Baiting by flaming dfc  Here's your reply.            Now you're trying to spread lies, but it makes me wonder what if Kurumi, Kaguya and Shido met in their chuuni phase.   that would be great       He becomes the next Hokage!    xyz plebs   &gt;tfw Tohka in charge in using retard's deck        hollowed  Is this supposed to be "flattened", or is he screaming? It'd be "hollering", in that case.   I wish you a good luck  all good luck   did not replied  reply   but Yoshino tell her   told  Mostly tense confusion.                He aims to become the pirate king of the ninjas.    Looks like Yuzuru's got a great Kaguya impression.    retard    Mana pls go.    He's basically Aizen meets Light     Why does she need him?     Shidou isn't a particularly great guy, yet theses girls instantly fall in love with him in usually a few hours.    In*    It's TWGOK meets Fate Stay/Night.    for her plan obviously which is much greater than Kurumi's.  I reckon Kurumi is also being used by her in a way      This. But Shido haven't jackhammered anyone yet.    Becaus he gains the girls love/trust through effort and no some bullshit like defeating the villain of the week.    Play the game     cause she dose look up to her after all  Kaguya a cutie       Come to think of it, Kurumi and Kaguya are a different kind of chuuni than Shido. Shido's all about the GREAT POWER and DOWN MY SWORD HAND! Kurumi and Kaguya roleplay dark maidens of the night, so they'd get along better than the boor.  Until Kurumi stopped playing around and started actually eating people at least.   Hallelujah. One mana transfer dragon is enough, and the less said about dolphins the better.          Liking DxD   Jesus christ these -18 kiddos are fucking retarded, they shit on every single harem series with better setup than their shitty LN. How can be them so assblasted and retarded at the same time?     Miku is worst girl   DxD is great, fuck off   Hope Shidou gets some character development. I only want him to be a bit more decisive. Please Tachibana!   Because it has hot girls, the writting goes full retard but they claim since it doesn' take itself seriously it's okay, also waifu wars. You can't even discuss the series at this point.     Until Kurumi stopped playing around and started actually eating people at least.   im pretty sure she only kills assholes  past Kurumi was more chuui        Flattened. Thanks for fixing!    XYZ REVOLUTION!    Wish fulfillment, I like it but it goes full retard sometimes.     DxDretard detected   Go back to your containtment board /v/irgin.      Game =/= canon  But I really liked the pregnant Origami end.      it will never happen    Not really, she has a death count of 10000+ people.    We all know Shun is here for the Ruris  or rather Yuzuru for she is a Ruri or rather a Rin who has a pendulum for a weapon. Funny how Yuzuru hits all of the Ruris except Serena(Yuzu in her name and has a Pendulum, Rin's voice, is blonde like Ruri, can wield a bow) .   Phantom is confirmed for Spirit No. 000, who is said to be the origin of the tree.       My pleasure. Mind if I do the rest?     Wish fulfillment   You have LN's like Shinmai Maou, Hagure Yusha, WB, and others to complete that. Is not necesary to stay with a novel full of boob teasing and retardation anon.      Rinne Utopia is canon though.    but was it just 10000+ assholes    So DxD threads and the fanbase are shit, also the LN/show is bad at this point.    and Mahouka and SAO.    Yes, anon. I know.   Everyone forgot her and she never appeared beyond the games so she's not relevant.       I don't mind, but I think you better fix when it's going to be put in Pastebin. I don't keep track of posts here when writing summaries so I might missed it.     im pretty sure she only kills assholes  Them she killed for pleasure. There's a reason that Mana wants her dead, and it's that she used to be FAR less discriminating in who she ate.     No it wasn't.  Kurumi kills anyone she wants. Kurumi doesn't care about humans, only meeting her goals and she'll do what she wishes to get there. Anything.      And Campione.     10000+ assholes  Are you retarded? Remember in volume 3 how she was willing to destroy the whole school with a spacequake?     It's CHUUNI, WITH A FUCKING N  IF I READ CHUUI ONE MORE FUCKING TIME      Read the fucking novels faggot.    I don't think shes as bad as you say she is, sure shes crazy but there are still good parts to her, it never said she killed Innocent people    What?    Chewni.   I did.       I will then. We stopped pasting about three threads back, and I've got two of them bookmarked.    I guess Shidou's school is filled with assholes then.    that was a bluff of desperation    Did you miss the line where it's stated Shidou found Phantom's fake form somewhat familiar? There is also some important info in RU like the whole thing with the spirit becoming a time bomb and Rinne being part of bigger spirits.    She's gotten a LOT better since Kotori scared her straight. Original Kurumi would cheerfully depopulate a city or two for the City of Devouring Time. And she WAS going to kill Shido because he was right there, even if she's only been joking about it since then.   Kurumi actually fired the quake. It failed because Kotori countered it.        Kurumi   desperation  Desperation for what? Nobody was attacking her and she actually used a spacequake that Kotori managed to stop in time.      It never said she only killed bad people either. Even if there's good there is also bad, hence why she remains out there unsealed.    Except she casted a spacequake upon the school but Kotori stopped it.     Rin's voice  Shit, I just realised.     rooftop Kurumi was afraid it said that in the novel    Are you retarded? That wasn't rooftop Kurumi, remember the clones can't do that shit.    we won't know for sure till we explore her past in her sealing arc    no before real Kurumi showed up     forgetting why it's rooftop in the first place  anon please     What are you even saying? We are talking about the fact Kurumi used a spacequake to destroy the school and clones are unable to do that.    Her first snaks in volume 3 were just a group of guys hitting on her. While they were not paragons of the community they were hardly scum of the earth. And what about that building she was stealing the life force of everyone inside. And she wasn't bluffing Kotori has to act to block the quake.    she was afraid of losing to Tohka so she started the quake    What?     she was afraid of losing to Tohka so she started the quake  What the fuck? It's this bait or someting? Kurumi defear both Tohka and Origami and almost killed Mana.     he's right    rooftop was there to prevent real Kurumi from falling for shido    You don't need to samefag     See you later, *all my cute kids.*  BEST MOM E S T  M O M              Despite the struggles of Tohka and Origami, they were unable to escape their bonds.    Kurumi snickered as she walked in front of Shidou, stopping her footsteps.    At this point, Kurumi's eyebrow twitched as though she had just remembered something.    "Fufu——That's right."    Saying that, she put the gun in her right hand to her left hand; following that she raised it up high.    Soon after, just like before, another spacequake alarm started to sound out.    "Wha......, Kurumi, what are you planning to——"    "Ufufu, fufu. The same thing as before of course. Everyone hasn't woken up yet——Ufufu, they'll definitely die for sure."    "St, stop it......! If you are going to do such a thing, I will bite off my tongue——"    The instant he said that, the Kurumis that were holding Shidou down, inserted their slender fingers into Shidou's mouth from both sides, pressing down on his lower jaw and tongue.                        Looks up Rinne Utopia again   "Been awhile since I read the summaries"   Sees DAL Wiki   Rinne Utopia Article   Date A Live: Rinne Utopia (凜祢ユートピア Dēto A Raibu Rinne Yūtopia?) is a game produced by Compile Heart and Sting Entertainment.     Sting Entertainment   No wonder it was depressing. Fuck it all makes sense now.            Do you want to know something else anon? If you put Yuzuru's name together with Rin's, you get YuzuruRin where there is a hidden Ruri bonus .   Miku is worst girl    inserted their slender fingers into Shidou's mouth from both sides, pressing down on his lower jaw and tongue  You know, that's an actual sexual fetish in Japan.  Also wow, old Kurumi was a bitch. No headpats for her (but it's good to see Shido still doesn't trust the psycho).   Sting's lost its touch, Gungnir wasn't depressing at all.           we'll never be given her true identity     - An exchange of &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt; and &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; are sparking in the sky. Ellen blocked Mana's attack and kicked her belly. Mana manipulated her Territory and escaped behind. However, Mana's reaction was a little bit slower. She couldn't fully cancel Ellen's attack. Mana coughed at the pain on her stomach.  "Even though you declared me with big words, that was quite a timid attack. You think you could kill me with something like that?" "Hmp… kill, kill you said. You don't know other way to win, do you? Even though your Magic Power is the strongest, seems like your intelligent is still not enough." "What a cheap provoke. Do you think I would get taken in it?"  - Ellen said with a cool face. When Wizards are using Realizer, a slight disturbance can caused the sensitivity of Territory to drop. Ellen couldn't be provoked so easily.   "Ha… I didn't expected you to do so. Just an impression. I thought you were somewhat dull ever since I was at DEM." "Don't joke around. There's no way I'd have any faults." "No, I saw you tripped several times where there's nothing around. Also I saw you take two breaks when you carry the documents from second floor up to the fourth floor." "What!? How did you —" "Well since we're at it I'm going to say it. Wizards in the second group are not calling you 'Shikkou-buchou*' but rather 'Moyashikko-buchou*'" "……"  [*Note: Shikkou-buchou is a Department Manager, Moyashikko is used to call a weak kid who can easily get tired, etc., so Mana is adding 'Moya' in front of Shikkou to make fun of her.]                   That's why he is not trying to save her until the right time is here.    Retard    - Blood vein popped up on Ellen's forehead. Ellen quickly close to Mana and swing down her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt;. Mana evaded the attack and laugh at her.  "Whoa~? Didn't you said you can't be provoked?" "Shut up! What is that unpleasant nickname…!"  - Ellen shout in irritated voice. No doubt her subordinate will all get a harsh 'special training' when she is back to the office in England.  - The truth is Mana just thought up that nickname on her own just now. If Ellen use her head a little, she would have realized since the second group is full of Wizards from England, there is no way they would understand a Japanese wordplay. Looks like that is not something Ellen want someone to talk about.  "— Yes. …What? The 'Material A' is?"  - That moment, Ellen shook her brows and answer to the communicator. Ellen knitted her brows and clicked her tongue. She lowered her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt;,  "How lucky are you. — But remember, you won't have the next chance."  - Said that, Ellen then manipulated her Territory and flown away to somewhere. Mana decided not to follow her. After all, Mana's objective is to buy some time. There's also no guarantee anywhere that she will win if she followed her.  - More importantly, Mana right now has another reason. The name Shidou said on the ground earlier still keep swirling in her mind.   "…Who is Mio-san —"  - Mana mumbled under the darkness of the night.  ◇   About 7-8% left but I'm super sleepy. So let's finish it tonight. Sorry guys ;_;                            Retard.    Mana Best smug girl    Fuck this bitch.    No problem, goodnight, thanks again    Sure, no problem.    More threads for DAL!  Thanks anon      I can wait, We are lucky to have someone willing enough to do these summaries.    Respects to you and thanks.    Thanks and good job so far.    yay more retard bullying    Ellen is an old hag.    Thanks, sleep well!    Good night.    night don't let the retards bite   Why is everyone going skeleton for summaries when they have been around since yesterday now? http://www.emptyblue.it/post/2015/0<wbr>6/23/Date-A-Live-Light-Novel-Volume<wbr>-12-Review-Summary.aspx</wbr></wbr>    Motherfucker!

That's really bare bones, not even the cliff notes version. This is much better for talk and speculah.    That's a summary by an origamifaggot anon who liked the twins date the best  It's fucking shit      That summary is too short    More info!    Are you blind anon? That looks more like spoilers than a summary.     I liked the twins best, completely nailed the appeal of having twin girlfriends in the first place.     It lacks detail. How can you discuss something if you have little to no information?    Kaguya was cute     Origami is still my favorite character  He thought the revenge blinded Origami was good. What the fuck?     Mana is pretty good at pissing people off.    Cause she's shit    Retard.    Best imouto    Kotori pls.        Ah right my bad, after reading through the thread I can now see the vast difference. I was just confused seeing so many posts on the front page for this series calling for summaries.        I want Kotori to go to bed already.    Mana is smart, trying to catch Ellen off-guard.    We always have detailed summaries for this novel and they used to be even more detailed.    No harm done   So I have all of what TL Anon has done today for Chapter 5 here: http://pastebin.com/ZYg63XLw will add the rest to it when he posts it later on tomorrow.  Does anyone group together what he did for the previous 4 chapters or do I have to go archive diving?     No problem but try reading the thread next time.    http://pastebin.com/dcRjk8Qz here.  I might go through and edit them for Englishness, but I have work.      Nope, nothing. We were waiting for the entire summary to be done first but the transaltor already said he is going to translate volume 12 so you can do a pastebin if you want.    I have everything but I'm not going to share that here.     Slow ass lazy shitcucks     Really? I thought it was the worst.   Continuing the Symphogear hype. Only 9 more days until episode 1.  New PV came out today:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CL<wbr>cpO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]   The new concert scene looks great already.        Song translation  Exterminate will be on Nana's radio show this sunday.    I want to fuck Kirika.  Tsubasa's charm point    The new concert scene looks great already.  RIP budget.    I want to see Tsubasa taking care of Maria's hairstyle for her while she's restrained in a straightjacket.  Finally got to watch this damn PV after a long day and holy shit, why can't I hold all this HYPE?!  Slowly getting there.   I want to fuck, mind break, and marry Shirabe.      Are you gonna change anything else?    I'd say mix up the X returns squares. They are all right next to each other.     Yeah, still working, give me a moment.      Miku useless    DMJii a cute.  <br/>    Maria Useful   Chris Learns manners   These are never getting filled in.       Now why did you add yoyos? We know that one already. Should've kept chris table manners.     They should make flips during concerts in real life.   I want to marry Kirika!    Also I'm aware that my capitalization is all over the place.   Chris table manners are there, I removed something else. And I wanted Shirabe in there. We still don't know for sure if that's a yoyo, do we?       Nana is already flying around in her concerts. Not long until she does more crazy stunts.    It's a sawblade yoyo.     Chris a free space    Guys send help I can't stop rewatching the Radiant Force part of the PV.   I'm still saying that Kirika's witch themed outfit looks weird as fuck when it's white instead of black.   Anyone have the webm of how songs work being explained to miku?   When you join team good guys your uniform is required to match     I see. Since I removed other obvious things, any more ideas? Something with Anime janai?     Then do something like Shirabe "cooking" instant ramen    Anime-janai's friend getting a geah.    Anon I can't, I'm doing it too.    That's really not going to happen.    I think it looks great.    Change the Miku useless. That is rather pointless.    DMJii duet. Phonic gain. Mikugeah returns.  I'd say take out Apple lyrics, then I realized you were going for unlikely shit, so do what you prefer.  Is the Evil Mastermind square only supposed to be filled if Genjuro is the evil mastermind? Because that swings things from practically confirmed to extremely improbable.         How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real?   They could find her more stuff to throw.   How gay is miku?  How deep can she take bikkis fist?    KIZUNA  KOKORO  HITOTSU NI KAWARE      She can take  all of it    How many people believe in Aoi Yuki again?   Gay enough to turn a shit-tier relic into a killing machine through AI YO.  Elbow deep.     Now the fun about this is to have some completely improbable and some obvious things in them, right?   Can't really remember what that was about.       Lewd     HAZU YO KONO KISEKI NI KUSOU WA NAI E      Is it known who's going to be subbing this? If it's only Commie again I might as well just kill myself   Should be 'Mikugear returns'.    I'd fist Miku's ass with my penis if you catch my drift.    I think the fun about it should be that the event in every single box is HYPE AS FUCK.  Like, the thread fucking explodes with the force of a hundred climaxes every time we get to tick something off.       kusou  It's うそ, anon. くそ means shit.    Best song, and best gear. Why is miku so perfect.   Zoid plans to sub it, he found a timer and an encoder to help.   Commie on the other hand has pretty directly said they don't intend to sub GX.      Fine. But I'm done for now.   It's pretty hard to find enough such things to fill the whole board.       That's what I get for trying to speak gook.  Shou ga nai wa can't be helped.      Why do fansub groups refuse to sub Symphogear anyway? It isn't like a small show no one cares about.    Now  please be consistent in writing words in caps     Doing songs is awkward.    Compared to other shows it is, and it's apparently more difficult to sub due to using technical terms and unconventional Japanese or something.    No simulcast. Too many songs.    Because there's no simulcast script to take, edit and call an original translation. You actually need to know Japanese to sub it. There are only a few fansubbers I'm aware of who are actually good enough to do that.  Start learning moon on your own.      That and karaoke, lyrics everywhere.    Why does a succesful show like this not get a simulcast? Almost every show does nowadays.    Simulcasts killed fansubbing as we knew it    Licensing issues probably.    Do you have any idea how much money it would cost to license all the songs?   I'm so hype I'm even watching this trailer frame by frame.  dat border between red sunset and starry sky     Mexican subs will deliver for sure.     Shit. Will Zoid save us? Commie? FFF?       zoom in on head until it's roughly the same size as mine   scroll down to see how big her ass now is  Magnificent.      No, that was Daiz.    I think my eyes are bleeding    And now I realize they're under a roof that looks like a night sky that's gonna open up just like in the Zwei Wing concert. Hype.    Don't worry /a/, I'll make subs for you. I don't understand Japanese but I'll be sure to put "I want to fuck you Miku" when Hibiki is talking to her, maybe that isn't what she is saying at that moment, but that's what she thinks so it's all right.   Commie like every time. That's until the last episode airs and no subs come out for a whole month.  Bless those fuckers.       new gears  When?     Supposedly Zoid is doing it.   I know enough moon to watch it. I need to pause and rewind raw anime a lot, but I can get through it. I'll feel sorry for people if it doesn't get subbed, though.        99%     No animejyanai in the bingo    8 days 20 hours 31 minutes   So what, 20 days for subs?     I just noticed the London Bridge in the background. Unless they're performing on a barge, I'm guessing that's just a scaled-down replica?    They're in London. Satelight probably doesn't care there's no building in London that could possibly look at the bridge from this angle.     Commie of course. Besides the shenanigans with the last episode their releases were pretty solid. Though you know whenever an insert song gets used the episode will be delayed a day or two.     Commie said they weren't gonna do it. Vale, the Symphogear translator has a job at Sunrise now.      It's a flying arena Maria brought over herself. She set it to hover over the river during the concert.       There goes the typesetting I guess.     It's like when porn artists get jobs doing legit manga and stop doing porn, only worse because at least you have their non-H art to look at now.    Not to shit on people who do this stuff in their free time but we went full weeks without subs well before the last episode.    Since the songs take so long, it might be a good idea if Zoid does two releases; one without the songs, and then a second one after the songs are translated and typeset.    You should tell him that, not us.   I don't know why I have this saved.   I'm not good at that sort of thing.    Maria is shown in a prison getup   In episode 1 she's doing a concert  Wait what? Do they let her out just to sing or something and then immediately lock her up afterwards?       That's how it should be.    didn't mean to post that, sorry    Why do you think they're gonna lock her up again. The prison scene was probably a flashback to the moment when they got her out of it.    I don't see a problem in that.    Time skips. The shuttle incident takes place not too long after G, then something like six months are going to pass before magical girls start showing up. Tsubasa will graduate in that time too.    @zoid9000  Supposedly he lurks here, I doubt he'd mind discussing his plans. Dude seems happy to talk about symphogear at any opportunity.         Further, the live scene in GX will be very different from the one in G, both in terms of music and it’s visual presentation.   It already looks different compared to the other two. There's something melancholic in the lyrics and the atmosphere too.      I can't wait anymore   Fine will come back for real this time right?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nuH<wbr>fVn_cfHU</wbr>  [ ]   Do we have enough people here who are decent enough at the language in order to translate/summarize the important things in an episode? I feel like I can watch symphogear raws and understand most of it, maybe not the language but it's generally quite easy to understand what is going on (most of the time, action).    The shuttle incident takes place not too long after G  Huh, how do you know that?     Summarize sure, accurately translate only with a raw where I can skip around in. I wouldn't worry too much though, we survived commies erratic shedule just fine so we'll get through this too.    There's usually a few people who fill us plebs in on the confusing parts.    Dear Lord I wish she doesn't, I don't want her to kill herself.    777% We believe in Nana, but we believe in Aoi too. Miracles of the universe.      Ok, just checking.   Isn't the series supposed to start with the concert? Unless its a flashback like the other anon said, I don't see how that makes sense.        bingo  Its starting. The ride is starting.      That's what the story section on the website says, just shortly after the Frontier incident. It doesn't give a more specific timeframe. It does say that magical girls are about 100 days after that though, so not quite six months, sorry.    Flashbacks to explain what happened after G.    Chrisfag weeblord who translated some of the fan comics posted in the threads reporting in.  If subs get delayed I'll summarize episodes in the threads. As long as it's not 20 minutes of techno-babble I think I'll be ok.      Aoi is getting better and better at singing  Finally, there is a candidate to surpass Nana when she retires.  Nice to see you again, Weeblord!      My guess is that the episode will actually start with the shuttle falling and the gears trying to save it, then the time skip will happen and we'll see the pajama party and concert, both of which will be interrupted by the new enemies appearing.   Maria in jail probably is a flashback though. In an interview they said that Maria still being an idol and everything will be addressed in the first two episodes.      Aoi is my angel.   Is it just me or Tsubasa looks more manlier as the time passes?   To me it seems more like it starts with Hibiki and co having a pajama party and watching the concert on TV and then suddenly getting called on site without their gears and then getting permission to use them again afterwards to rescue civilians?   The backgrounds are sure getting better every season.   Shit I just noticed how lewd the crotch region of Maria's idol outfit is.    Same as Tsubasa's Symphogeah, pretty much.    Thank the frenchbro background artist at Satelight.     The frenchies that do background art for Satelight tweeted some months that they were working on Symphogear S3.     Maria is prepared to let Tsubasa stick her sword inside her.      Fushichou no Flamme was about phoenixes and fire   a hot, fast and action-y song   this time they're in goldfish outfits on the river Thames with water sprinklers in the concert  I'm betting it will be a calm ballad or something.       I wish I can work at Satelight too.    That scrolling block of text about authorization is in reference to the shuttle incident. It's giving the 2nd Division permission to act outside of Japan for six hours to save the shuttle.     calm ballad, then shit goes down on the other side of the world were Chris and Bikki are  That works too.      What do the moonrunes say?   Varying degrees of anger.     tfw no Tsubasa at the pajama party     I actually like Bikki's S1 pajamas more because of the sweatpants (those are sweatpants right?). But Symphobird shirt+sweatpants would be perfect.   Looks like Nana is shooting the PV for Exterminate now. http://www.mizukinana.jp/blog/2015/<wbr>06/post-2959.html</wbr>     blog not updated for 2 days  Looks like she's busy as fuck.     She's getting more angry and it uses gyaru meme-speak to describe how fucking angry she is.    You ever watch the Rock? With Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery? She's like Sean Connery's character, but with more singing and less prison rape.    According to the International Union Charter, The international Union of Security held an emergency conference about the measures and correspondences towards the severe machinery trouble of the Space Shuttle of the International Union of Security; Ned Buntline93R which is intended to the investigation and search for the ■■■ suspended antiquity on the point of Lagrange along the orbit of the earth satellite, and 573 latinga, among 15 members of the assembles commissioners.  Main point for the conference is about the activity of the Government of Japan which is the second sector of special hazards correspondence possesses outside of the territory of the country of Japan, and the special correspondence activity to execute measures in order to approve the limitless transit and transfer among the borders of each country in the Peace of Westphalia.  After the conference among the 15 executive commissioners, the result was 13 approvals and 2 disapprovals.  The number of the approving votes exceeded the ones of disapproving and gained the approvals from over 9 countries that are set numbers, however one country of the executive commissioner invoked the rights to refuse and provided the large country agreement rules, it is defined that the special correspondence activity was unapproved.  However the activity authority was certified upon the condition to disclose all the records of the activities outside the territory of Japan as resources and to limit the activity for the maximum of six hours including preparation and clean ups.   Therefore, it is confirmed to commission the measures and correspondence in terms of severe machinery troubles of the Space Shuttle of the International Union of Security; Ned Buntline93R under the supervision of the board of directors.  (Ned Buntline is the name of the shuttle. https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Ned<wbr>_Buntline)</wbr>                Based anon.    Training Montage should say free space    You wouldn't expect that to make sense, but it does.     Tsubasa clearly visible lower right corner of pyjama party   Get your prescription checked, Nana.     No, I mean the GX one.    They were looking for relics in space, and they probably found Elfnein and her box out there, which is why she's designated as "Scrap Material #11".    That anon's talking about the GX pajama party in the PV, Tsubasa is presumably at England at that time.    fire   I feel like I kind of know why they want to fuck up shit.    I want to  hold hands  with Elfnein and tell her everything will be okay.    You can't solve all your problems by holding their hands Hibiki.    I thought that was witch loli, not Eru erufu nein.    Kind of looks like they're going specifically after the geahs though.   Maybe red and blue dolls will show up after Shirabe and Kirika join the fight.        eru erufu   fuck I miss it        Carol seems too adorable to get dusted like Fine or arrested like Ver.  How long does she have until she gets fisted into  Hibimiku's adopted daughteru ?   Elfnein twin optional.            By that logic and given her appearance to Carol she's probably a shapeshifter or something.    Might pave the way for Symphogear ViVid and no one wants that.      Wyatt Earp  Wasn't that name in an anime in the past year or so?     I just realized the song Hibiki sings when fighting Chris in S1 is a altered version of Kanade's song  https://soundcloud.com/terryshadow-<wbr>terry-kun/senhime-zesshou-symphogea<wbr>r-1</wbr></wbr>     How much more enjoyable would Vivid have been if they sang in ever fight?    Impressive slowpoke.       It's a cover of Kanade's song. The lyrics are different and the tune has slight differences. There is even a fanmade duet with both of them.      Ties in nicely to the whole idea of Hibiki carrying on Kanade's will.    You're a fucking imbecile.  Did you even downloa the OST? If not, why not? The songs not good enough for you!? They have the same name except one has "Kanade" in place of "Hibiki"       Watashi to iu oto Hibiki sono saki ni   Kimi to iu oto Kanade tsukiru made  Not just the name, but yeah you'd have to be pretty dense to not catch it.       he doesn't want MILF Bikki+Miku     Calm down friend, some people are a little slow to pick up on things like that.     tfw you will never go on a deito with Hibiki     What language is that store name in?     nor Aoi for that matter       I marathoned this last week, I was listening to the OST today when I realized.       Minase Inori and Kuno Misaki   "Hibiki-mama"  Yes please.  "Miku-mama"  Doesn't seem to sound right in my head.   Good work, anon! Now you're just in time to  wait for subs  with us.           Now I don't mean to start anything, but Hibiki is cuter than Aoi due to being fully 2D instead of just 2.5D like Aoi.    That's because Miku is just Mama.    I'm ready for the wait anon I'll do it for the  JUSTICE       Hibiki is cuter than Aoi  Thems fighting words, anon.   They're both equally as cute.        I can't wait to hear how Inori sounds as hat loli.  Of course 2D is superior, even Aoi herself recognizes that. I still like her better, though.       Like I said, Bikki has the edge due to being 2D.    Carol might be too old to be throwing "mamas" around.    Who needs to act their age when you can be gap moe instead.    Unless she's literally throwing them with magic powers I guess.    She'll probably use the serious voice she used for Hestia last Friday. I'm more interested in how Misaki Kuno will sound as Alien 9.   Chris this isn't Nanoha you can't just shoot up buildings.   It's okay, that area's been abandoned for some time.    Those buildings had it coming.    "After watching the new PV and being filled with all kinds of emotions, Maria-san starts crying."    Much same    UN's space shuttle accident happened 3 months later after G's finale, Bikki and co. couldn't do anything at that time because Symphogears are considered as Japanese weapons, then 3 months later after space shuttle accident, 2nd division found Elfnein in Japan. Not sure if Bikki and co. resolved space shuttle accident during that 3 months, it's possible that space shuttle might spend 3 months to fall down to the earth.     Oh god, what shuttle accident? What the hell did I miss, and where can I learn of this?     Get ready for the new variation of her attack. Moelight breaker.    The “Frontier Incident,” which sought to weed out a large part of humanity and assure the continuance of the human race, was brought to an end by the efforts of a group of girls whose blood and songs were exchanged across the battlefield. However, the curtain now opens on a new story which begins shortly after that.  An object fell to Earth at supersonic speed after being ripped from sub-space. It was a U.N. space shuttle attempting to return to Earth after performing its duties at a Lagrange Point in outer space.  Due to system trouble it fell into disarray and was doomed to either break apart on re-entry or worse, crash directly into the surface. The leaders of the world’s nations held their breath during this desperate situation.  However, going back before that, the Symphogear users who saved the world from unparalleled danger were officially deemed part of the military weapons held by the Japanese government. They were forced into permanent standby, not allowed to leave even if a humanitarian crisis called for it, much less granted requests to visit overseas.  From that time, just over 100 days have past.  Ever since the end of the Frontier Incident, there have been no further sightings of the Singular Disaster known as the “Noise.” It was about the time when people had begun to assume that threat of the Noise had ended, and that they had been completely eliminated when…  Staring at their monitor screens at headquarters, Sakuya Fujitaka and Aoi Tomosato confirmed a wave form response that was different, albeit very similar to the Noise.  The location was near the pier at Yokohama’s Osanbashi Bridge.  There, the black-hooded figure of Elfnein (aka “Scrap Material #11”) was seen carrying a small box and appeared to be fleeing from someone or something.  There is a song to destroy the world.  As of yet, no one has taken notice of the danger that will visit them soon. There is only a red dust dancing in the evening summer sky above.                        From the official website by the way. Was right up against the character limit.    I want to lick Shirabe's back.   Dienheim reminds me of a certain trashy Riddle.   She was such a cocktease.    I want to lick Bikki's butthole.    Why would you want to do that    You had to beat miku in javelin throwing first.    That's easy enough, I just need to throw with my left hand :^).    Don't shitpost.   ITT: Gay couple      not these two       Video editing confirms.     that princess carry     100% confirmed     My heart's not over the Cyan and Retoree plotblock, but I absolutely love the last episode for that, at least.     Basically Makoto x anyone   What should Shuzo do?   Meant to reply      Good question. That is one pushy fuccboi, but I just don't think that that can stand up to the power of a man with a full-time job. It's best if Rom handles the pushing.     What if Shuzo pushed himself onto Rom?      Rom would just push back even harder.  Shuuzo should stick to pulling.      Pulling what exactly?    Just like in that image, pulling Rom Closer to him. He's been stalking patiently, waiting for the opportunity to strike and when he spotted Aion, he fucking leapt on it.   I have already been missing this.      No homo though  Are grils fine too?   If they're gay, they're okay   Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain    Hikaru    Love.    More like princess tomboy     Horns.     I liked how Bell's hair literally glowed in the dungeon.

Do i have to be able to draw or can I just come talk?    So basically just keep drawing and eventually an instinct will develop. Just like almost every other thing in art.     Yep.

As a Echidna? http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Echidna</wbr>    Also, despite what I said here  In which I already had her on my list, I have moved all my efforts to the WWD. So any requests for monster girls here will not be me. However, I fully endorse it and eagerly await what gets produced.   Huh, Been a while since I haven't thought of this series. Yeah, let's do this I guess, hooray for sexual confusion and denseness. Setting up stream. https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>      The circle is more of a group of friends, rather than people who try to milk drawings off each other.

You can just come talk in the stream and make friends with people, it's quite fun.       2.5 days      I think you're probably doing whatever you're trying to do wrong.  Probably. He asked for color. I think I fucked up quoting, too. <br/>     oic. Yeah, you quoted right now. Nice coloring.    My bad. I think I copypasted the wrong link there.  Thanks though!      The sinister, conspiracytard term for when 2 or more drawfags are friends.  whats wrong with drawfags being friends?     Interesting. I'm surprised you went with a member of the Lamia family. Was thinking you would go for golem, dyrad, or another plant mamono.  Either way.  added to the list.       People get frustrated when their requests aren't filled, so when they see drawfags becoming friends and sometimes drawing for each other, they get frustrated and paranoid that the "circle" hates them, or that the circle is too busy drawing for each other to draw for anyone else, and think that's why they're not getting anything.    Can;t go wrong with lamias, though.    Why would a drawfag draw for another drawfag when a drawfag could just draw their own shit. I don't really get it.   As someone whos learning to draw, I'd rather try to draw my request myself than request it, im sure some other drawfags feel similar.       Seeing your waifu/OC/favorite character in someone else's art style is fun, especially if you especially admire that style. It's also a social thing, like buying lunch for the other drawfag.  Also, even really excellent drawfags tend to massively underrate their own work and overrate the work of others in comparison to their own (I can't draw eyes that well, therefore this other guy is better than me), so art trades often feel like a good deal even between equally skilled drawfags.      because I can't draw for shit and I like seeing people who can draw actually draw her. but not having a waifu means I never get to see her drawn. life is suffering.      Thank you very much for coloring the drawing anon it looks even better. Have a good one.     I like seeing people draw the waifu I don't have     Color: http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48121  I'm no good with color, and I don't like leotards, specifically this one, it kind of looks like a onsie.  I tried. Hope you like it.    </wbr>    Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray). It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling. Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.     I pretend to have a waifu so people draw something for me.  I just miss having fun drawing stupid shit with friends, now all the people I used to do it with are either "artists" or don't give shits anymore.     Cute. Why didn't you post the color? Looks good.    That line going down her face and neck on the color version is triggering my autism     The irc is dead all the time  What are you even saying?      requesting Tamamo from FateExtra in this also more underboob art    im was bored, so here's a quick doodle. dont count it as a delivery though   Requesting color ref: http://imgur.com/a/gKT2l#0     I just spent the last hour skimming though the MG encyclopedia before I finally cut myself off, and holy crap that is a deep rabbit hole.     It's incredibly cute! Extra points for the dog!  Thanks so much!       Thanks draw friend! The very fact that your tried makes me happy. Theres no way I cant appreciate it!  The Gekota is a nice touch. Ashamed that it never even crossed my mind.   Thanks again!        I want lewd with Misaki Shokuhou from Railgun and Miku Izayoi from Date a Live Both have mind-controlling abilities.    Some are pretty damn lewd.   Girtablilu is the lewdest imo.

Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]    im not kogasafag    They probably wouldn't anyway. The wrt one would do is tease you into making you think they're gonna eat you, and then empty yu out.      Manticore will never tear Tanpopofag to shreds and feast on his flesh  Why live?     OR here, it's ok if you were a little late, but the coloring actually is nice, thank you and have a good night!  I think I'll probably add Eyeshield 21 to my watchlist.     No problem, I hope you have a good night as well!   You should read it instead, everyone's way more beautiful in the manga       Most of them are 2lewd4me   Posting the  delivery.

Even if some descriptions are cute, I'm extremely tame when it comes to monsterizing my waifu. "Add-ons" like ears, tails, or wings are about as far as I'd go. No swapping limbs for non-human versions.    Bruh I have no idea if this is what you wanted. Hope you like it, and that it's what you wanted.      doesn't want a cyborg waifu  literally shit taste.     This is why I'm hesitant to draw unsolicited. A waifu is very special to the requester. I would hate to violate her in the mind of the requester. However like you mentioned. There are plenty that look very human.    Not sure about that neck twist though.    stream link?    Kind of shaft-ish huh, I hear ya, I'll take more care next time.  https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>      I'd say as long as you keep it simple (tail, ears, maybe whiskers) most requesters will be fine with it.    Prim and proper in public, but a sub-human beast in bed who screams hard and bites her lover's shoulders whenever she is fucking him. And she loves raw anal.  Draw both sides of Ikaruga, perhaps the former mainly in a sexual act, suggestive, or completely SFW.    I don't even know why I'm doing this.

Requesting Baron Ashura from Mazinger Z meeting Black Claw from Cutie Honey for the first time, both of them examining each other's strange appearance. http://imgur.com/a/Rb23o    Whoa now, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

It wouldn't really be fitting for my waifu, but I could appreciate up to about an Aigis level.    asuka high fiving hitler      Jesus christ, I boned up the bottom half so hard I needed to crop it out.

HG on one side introducing himself with a "Hoooo!" at the end, implied hip thrusts and sparkles and bubbles in the background, while on the other side NS introducing himself with the usual explosion in the background.  References just for the hell of it:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=HoOqhxJnMIU#<wbr>t=76</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=eI5UGAyYvss#<wbr>t=230</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  Shit quality for NS but that's all I could find on the tube.            [YouTube] Not Found    [YouTube] Not Found  Get your shit together, man.      I have a coloring question. What's the idea behind choosing the "dark" hair color? Adding black to the base color, or using color picker just doesn't cut it sometimes.  Is it something I just play around with?     Consider me officially jelly of Kirikafag    She's Chifusa     Okay, so monster girl delivery, Snake monster thing counts right? Also, more mature delivery, also also, bakemonogatari delivery.

Sure, but you could also learn a bit about color theory and how to pick colors. Or just copy the colors of your favorite illustrators and develop an intuition. Both are valid.      Requesting Ufo style Rin as a milf.     when you say color theory, you're talking about monochrome, complimentary, analogus, etc. as well as value, saturation, and tints?    If you really want to understand, I'd suggest reading through this at some point http://www.huevaluechroma.com/index<wbr>.php probably skimming past anything regarding paint mixing unless you plan on doing that.  Though if that's too much of a hassle, read this instead http://www.floobynooby.com/ICG/artv<wbr>alues.html no excuse there; read it through and through.  To give you the abridged version, adding black rarely cuts it. Making consistent shifts in tone in a certain lighting condition involves a change in the hue, value, and chroma/saturation, otherwise colors will look out of place and inconsistent. Adding black essentially just changes the value which, tends to kill the hue and saturation, leaving very washed out colors. Basic rule of thumb is that lighter tones will tend to yellow, whiter, and more saturated colors while darker colors will tend to blue, blacker, and more desaturated colors.  The trick to picking the right color is picking consistent colors that don't break how the saturation or hue is read in the picture while still establishing a coherent contrast between dark and light.  If you have sai, you can enable the HSV slider option on Windows tab which will tell you exactly each value for hue, value, and saturation.      </wbr>  </wbr>     S-shit, would just copy/paste my shit from the last thread. Thanks. Surprising though, the HG video was there for ages though for some reason most seem to have just been removed. Great fucking timing for this request I guess. In any case, managed to track one down here:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DiK<wbr>uOSasa7Q&amp;feature=player_detailpage#<wbr>t=77</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  As for NS there really isn't much on the tube so I guess I'll have to pass on this thread and make a webm or something by the next one. Hell, might make webms of both and be done with it. Either way, thanks again for pointing it out.

If you want to include mini Fredericka, go ahead!   ADIOS          What system do you drawfags use for animu esc facial and head measurements? I've been trying the five eye line but it gives to realistic results.   It's something you have to discover yourself, the joy of drawing shit then looking up and it's hours since you started. That happened to me just now too, started drawing a tan succubus flying about in her pajamas and where did the time go?    damn looking good colorfag  mfw Kirikafag is getting lots of deliveries and lots of love   im so god damn happy for him      is this how you drawfags look like when you draw lewd animu pictures?   Less blushing more neutral expression, since I drew it I know all the flaws too well for that kind of expression.    More like this.      you will never watch a drewfag raw ledw pictures while his facial expression slowly changes and he gets wet down there       and he gets wet down there     What do you think we drawfags are, some kind of beast? That we'd fall prey to our basest desires, that we'd stifle moans as we trace over our third primary layer to get the curvature of the breasts just right, erection straining against our pants as we paint shading onto the juicy inner thigh?    so what you're saying is you want to fuck me, and you want it now?and afterwards you want to draw it all?   Requesting Chiri in proper M1930 IJA uniform.   Requesting Yayoi  sexually  struggling to draw.    But that's wrong, anon. You don't sexualize the Precures.     Yayoi should eventually end up stroking herself with the pencil and getting off with it.    It's written right here, nigga.    I can't draw for shit. I did colour it, but it ended up looking terrible.    Requesting Ryona getting her body smashed into a wall please, as in being pushed into it with a great amount of force. something like this:  http://uploads.dragonballencycloped<wbr>ia.com/0/00/Goku_Smashed_Into_Wall.<wbr>jpg</wbr></wbr>     Who's that artist second from the right on the top row?    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=9762416</wbr>   bump  Requesting Haru dressed like Kanata   IT's fine looks pretty good as-is thanks asoc   My birthday is soon so I'm requesting Eila wearing a party hat   Damn this is really good, thanks drawfriend, the expression is cute and the tail looks really fluffy and huggable~ I wish there were more monstergirl  and lewd monstergirl  art of Natsuru, thanks again!    2 days    Do you have somewhere you post your stuff?    OR here.  That's a big sword.     Bump   Stop that fucking shit right now.    i assume you would want her dressed as alice like in the reference you provided    Does anyone here even want a pregnant waifu?    In a tasteful fashion, maybe    I'd actually like one.    Usually this.    I would, but I already have a lovely picture of her with a baby bump from pixiv so there's no need to request it.     2015   being autistic enough to treat your wifu like 3dpd gf replacement       2015   still having a 3dpd girlfriend      I don't, but I also don't think that wifu should be treated like one, it's just wrong and will lead you to nowhere.    I'd want to make her pregant, take responsibility, and raise our child together, if that's what you mean.   Requesting an anime version of "where do you think we are"   I don't know, I figure people can do whatever they want with their concept of waifu as long as it makes them happy.  I'm not delusional, I know she's an anime character, but more than that a psychological construct that fulfills certain emotional needs more efficiently than a 3D with her own emotional demands would. So in that sense, she is a replacement.  With the downside of not being very interactive, but what in life is perfect?  If I could have a wifubot made that spoke and acted and felt like a real being, I'd never look at 3D again. I'm selfish, I don't want the give-and-take of a relationship with another sapient being. Because in the end, what does that benefit you? Won't both I and my potential 3D wife be happier, more productive people if we have wifu/husbandobots and don't have to deal with each other's sometimes literal shit?  Is our love less real because its directed at objects that don't have the capacity to reject it? I say no.  Next 50 years are going to be fun, I'm glad I'm alive.             Pick a slut and draw her getting turned into a  sinless, pious nun    12 best girl     12   not 25      By tasteful, do you mean  your submissive, pregnant waifu in a collar and leash thanking you for getting her knocked up ? Or  your dominant, pregnant waifu grabbing you by your belt and peeking down to check if your junk is ready for another beating a few months from now ?      2 more days.   Can I pick  both ?   Requesting kagami greedily wringing her hands like the filthy jew she is    Mop   Best anything      Something around these lines   Every time I do a scan preview with my printer it crashes Windows Explorer.  Anyone else have this issue?     I haven't had a problem with Windows explorer since 2005.  Since that was when I last used it.       using microdick wangblows     IE is one thing, but you have to be a masochist retard to use Linux.    GNU+Linux*  OSX is the true master race.       I'm computer illiterate, so there can't possibly be anyone who finds using Linux easy     some versions of linux aren't actually that bad. things like ubuntu are pretty intuitive even for non techsavy people.  personally I think anyone who uses linux as a main OS is retarded anyways because its just more of a hassle than its worth for everyday use, but its not like all distros are gentoo      masochist retard to be using Linux  you know, he could just be using OSX      OSX is a certified unix distro though    I'd like to see these two done http://i.imgur.com/okXtfqC.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Zdixm0Y.jpg sorry if they're rough and all, even clean lines would be nice.      yeah but fuck Apple    Earn 500k+ per year like sakimichan.   requesting taba girl (does she even have a name?) in a summer dress and big straw hat http://imgur.com/c6rAMRH     Hopefully you see this when you wake up, Thanks for drawing Nero, Boa!    Unrelated but does anyone know when thumbnails got fucking axed on archive.moe? I remember people complaining when some were lost late in last year but now I can't see any past like a month ago, or any posts complaining about it in the archive, is it just temporary or does no one care anymore?  requesting waifus being forcefed foods they hate.   2 cute CD.    There was a problem with the long-term storage or something. According to  twitter  it should be back up relatively soon.      Mostly a neutral expression. But if it's especially weird it can be like this    One of you guys drew that? That's fuckin' incredible.    For FREE!    not really.    being away on a weekend  Feels horrible. After being on a long drawing streak, skipping a few weekends after the last one feels shitty.   Requesting Yukari smoking a cigarette   2 minute sketch     For those that aren't in the circle what does this even mean.    Draw a talking burrito, that whenever it talks spits out a nice amount of bean. Can be chasing moe girls around too. Thanks.    implying you have to be in the circle to understand  Boa's feeling a  constriction  in his chest.     is he dying?    He can't die. He has to draw my waifu    I was thinking it was either vulturing and he drew that cause he was like "I just can't win." or that he thought the reply was cute and was showing gratitude.  On reverse image search it shows no results. So I'm guessing this was an art trade?        seiba is Boa's waifu      I requested Nero in the weekend waifu drawthread, Boa drew me a Nero. I wanted to thank him by drawing Seiba. Was it a trade? Kind of. Was Boa guaranteed a thank-you-drawing? No.    seiba = saber  And the last horse crosses the finish line.      Someone said horse?    Go to bed Ycake.    It´s average at best, last thread's OP was way better for example.    Ill take this one, if no one minds.    Don't rank the free art.   Requesting Mami going window shopping with Nagisa   I'd take that she'll raw.   Requesting Teto with her top opened in a cumshot picture on her face + chest or into her womb, smiling and double peace no ahegao.   *shell   Requesting lewds of these two please   This has nothing to do with them being free deliveries or not here.   I want a picture of Cobra (from Space Adventure Cobra) and Dandy (from Space Dandy) hanging out together.   Sweet refs, brah.    I'm in a circle?    holy shit seconded    Already posted.<br/>    More of an ouroboros.     navel licking  No, fuck off.     Haven't seen the anime, so excuse me for not knowing how the design on the collar works. I'm too lazy to check for a reference. Hope it's alright!    Don't play coy. I know you drew for one of the early mass deliveries. I don't think you drew for the big one tho.    My oh My, that sure is wonderful. How do you draw that quickly and with that level of skill?    I don't care for navel play but i would like them to have more ab definition    How exactly do you dock and lick the navel at the same time? Is it like a 69?    Sai does most of it for me.    Oh hey you use sai too?  How do you deal with the lack of vertical and horizontal guides?  Do you just say fuck it?      I wouldn't mind that as well.  Basically.      Yea, I just kind of go for it. Objects end up getting oddly displaced in space but that's what the transform tool is for right &gt;&lt;?     Vertical and horizontal guides   Are you an artist or a draftsman?  If you desperately need guidelines, use the selection box tool.  Not him tho   Really striking, by the way.             I really need to learn how to use sai better.    I just don't like it when I try to draw strict vertical and horizontal lines and it ends up being wonky and stuff looks like it's leaning over or crooked.   Artist. So use the selection box and fill it and use it as guide?       Oh, I tend to not have that problem since a lot of my digital stuff is heavily gesture. I just kind of flick my hand around. When I do need straight lines though usually ill rotate the canvas since its easier to make diagonal motion on the tablet as opposed to a straight line.    I hope you stick around for the weekend. The way you render hair and eyes makes my heart go doki doki.    I hope he doesn't. The weekend doesn't deserve this    Which one?    love the hair but the eyes feel a bit off to me.     criticizing free art     Stop.     thinking critiques are a bad thing  just leave. I know this isn't /ic/, but as a drawfag here I wish people would critique my art more often.      So what about these who are still rocking  XP    Requesting these sluts getting pounded.   This is probably the only reason I will try posting here.  If you want to have no meaningful critique might as well head on over to DA.     It's probably because I didn't add enough hard black and used too thick of a density on the little chicken scratches. I'm actually going over it now that you mentioned it lol.    I apologize, I did not realize that the drawfags were open to critiques on their work after all the effort they put into them. I hope you do not misunderstand.      As a drawfag "The eyes feel a bit off" would annoy me, because if I could see what the hell you're talking about, I wouldn't have drawn it that way. Criticism should be specific.   Even a lot of professional art will "feel off" to certain people. Look in any thread about a certain artist and you'll see tons of people talking about how they hate his eyes or hips or whatever. If you can't suggest a way to improve it, and we can't see anything wrong with it, we have to assume you just don't like the style.  Sometimes someone will say "this part looks bad" and you immediately notice something wrong and can fix it. But not often, unless you're a beginner drawfag.          Fuck off lolyfag.    Well now I seem like a crazy person since I can't find the images in the booru but didn't you partake in a Hestia crossover mass delivery recently? I also remember you were a part of the original Oora mass delivery.    It's perfect you amazing son of a bitch    Who the fuck is that    well that's not it exactly, the eyes themselves don't look bad, they just seem a bit awkward on the face. I mean sorry about not being able to give a better critique but I'm not sure if its because its going toward the uncanny valley or if they just seem placed a little off, its just not sitting right with me.  sorry, its one of those things I'd love to perfectly outline for him, but I can't really place my finger on it. and since it seems he's better than me it's probably easier for him to pin it down than me.       I would agree with that.  A lot actually. Even if you do know something looks off you often can't fix it if it's too vague. Like the face looking wrong. You can tell it's off but not why. Like maybe the eyes are too far apart, or the nose is too big or the mouth is too low. And then vague comments like "the face looks wrong" are no help.   But I was specifically talking to the guy who was hating on critique itself, not that particular critique.       Counter requesting them hammering nails into roof shingles. or pounding pizza dough, or one of them playing the carnival game where they try to ring the bell by by hitting the lever with a mallet.    The only Hestia I've drawn was this one and it had nothing to do with /a/. I don't recall drawing Oora as part of a mass delivery either.   Requesting Kyoko   I would say it has to do with the pupils being rings with a dot in them. It's an interesting style but it throws me off.    Well, I guess I'm crazy. Sorry about that.    Maybe you're thinking of that one time where the other drawfags were watching his stream and delivered along with him. He wasn't an active part of that mass delivery tho.    Its not Friday yet.  This is probably it.      Boa can you draw     what happens friday?     Boa drew Hestia  The end times are upon us!     Is fridays for requests? Do people just post whatever other days?    I tweaked them a bit, gave harder dark colors and it looks nicer. The rings i tried removing and it does look more natural but I'm just a sucker for the little white circles. Adds, I don't know, a surreal intensity? Just a personal quirk though.    weekeend waifu draw threads where people can request their waifu     Summer is real  Friday-Sunday is the Weekend Waifu Festival, where everyone gets 2-minute sketches of their favorite cartoon characters.       Playing whack-a-mole with little Kurosakis instead of moles.    I actually like the little white circles as well. If I absolutely had to give some reason why they look off I suppose it'd be more that her left eye seems flatter than her other eye. the the fold above the eye is angled a bit strange.      Like I said, I find them odd, it's not a definite thing one way or the other. If you like them no reason not to keep them.    Happy birthday! Sorry it's just a sketch    So what is the rest of the week?  I have not been in drawfag threads much but it looks like just people giving and sometimes taking requests.     Nice, that would be fun to see too.    Okay serious answer:  This is the main drawthread, which continues for 7 days a week, and where you can request anything anime-related to be drawn.  Starting Friday morning and continuing until the last Sunday thread dies is the Weekend Waifu drawthread, which is separate from this one and is specifically about getting your (one and only one) waifu or husbando drawn how you want.  Recently the WWD has been significantly more popular among artists than the main threads, so it's looked forward to quite a bit.  You can request a waifu in either thread, but requesting him/her in both is heavily frowned upon.            You can request a waifu in either thread, but requesting him/her in both is heavily frowned upon.  I'm glad people were quick to tell me that the first time I came to these threads without getting told off. Some people aren't so lucky.      is it really that hard just to lurk more? I mean its not like this is rocket science or anything, its literally called the weekend waifu drawthread, whats hard about that to figure out?     It's not that easy to figure out some rules. E.g. when I started out there was someone else requesting my waifu and I requested her in a subsequent thread in which he didn't post, only for people to attack me because it wasn't obvious that the same character cannot be requested after getting a delivery.    It's okay, I know there's some confusion around and I'm almost sure there's a guy out there that has partially assimilated my style   Maybe  I have a lot on my plate at the moment         It's not hard, it's just that the first time I came, I watched a little on the first day, and saw what it was about. Then on the second day I decided to request and wait. Then I got my waifu drawn. And then, naively, I thought, "Hey, why don't I go over to the general drawthreads too? It'l be double the waifu power." Not knowing that that wasn't something that most people do. I knew enough that once you get one drawing from that particular thread, you were done for the weekend. I didn't know that rule applied across both threads. So when I requested, and a guy said, "No double dipping, asshole," I just apologized and fucked off.       Lots of things I've learned about 'board culture' come from watching other people get shit on for not following an unspoken rule.  The rest is just obviously understanding what the people are like. In this case, for example; even without a clear idea of it, I was already pretty sure that asking to have the same thing drawn in both threads would be a bad idea. Not even my pessimism over the attitude of people here; it just seemed like you would look too greedy if you did such a thing.     I can't wait for more 2 minute sketches! Maybe I should become a drawfag and join the circle. Then I'll get quality     I'm almost sure there's a guy out there that has partially assimilated my style   Requesting you draw a Bizarro version of yourself.      Fuck off mishafag.    If you don't like what you're getting then leave. At the very least stop your passive-aggressive whining.    Nah, he's alright     Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's what it is. Nicofag here, I remember boa did pic related for me and seven other artists drew the same thing, it was pretty great. (On my end, at least)      Yeah that was me. In hindsight, it might've been a little rude. Your style is cute, tho.      Requesting Ai Haibara in Crystal Maiden's outfit http://i.imgur.com/O3wTo63.png make her look bored or annoyed.   Nah it wasn't rude—in fact I appreciate it—it was just pretty weird seeing that on the booru because I could've seen myself drawing that some time ago.    Even if you did use the em dash improperly here, I will always love you, Boa.     flat Hestia  For what purpose, you evil, evil man?     I dislike Danmachi with every fiber of my soul    it's not that bad it's just painfully medicore    Is it because it's SAO 2.0?     Boa has good taste  As expected of Oneclean Man.      redraws a busty girl as dfc  why is boa so perfect?     It is mediocre, but aside from the hobbit every single girl is good.    What is UFO style?    Rin as a milf alien?     It's not great but there is no other fantasy airing right now.  Fantasy is hard to come by.      Large upper head narrowing as it goes down please.    anal probes.    Ufotable. So basically how she looks here, as opposed to how she looked in the DEEN version, or the original novel.   You guys.      http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50700529</wbr>   The whole thing just struck me as mind-numbingly superficial and dumb.    Yo, yo mah nig.   ITT: plump animu posterieurs.   Oh wow some guy drew two big circles. I'm not impressed     not liking big circles  how will you find a wife in america?      I'd make her butt sore on new year's.     top cuck     not impressed   Mombutts are so best always.      &gt;inb4 not animu     Large asses are unnatural and disgusting, reminds of female niggers.   Bugger off Ireland.     loli butt    Pull over    I am sorry I can't see it. Can somebody circle it?    This. They're gross.     Fuck off, /pol/lock      large asses are disgusting    My brother         he doesn't like large but firm black asses  low test tbh       Perfectly balanced.    Don't have a screenshot at hand but Meme from Denpa Onna's ass was, as my african american brethren would say, OFF DA HOOK.     Fuck off back to tumblr, shitskin. Or better yet shouldn't you be in a church?      waaah, go back to a site that has nothing to do with anything   Get bent, retard.         And then there's these assholes.      Same. Fuck this trend. What's worse is when fanart of characters with balanced proportions constantly exaggerates their ass size.   There were some fine booties in lycra shorts in yowapedal.  Here come the flat asses.  "Large asses were a mistake." -God   Why is gigantic anime ass so delicious           Go shove a potato up your ass, Liarland.          Not liking big asses  Go back to your lolishit and/or plebeian boob preferences        Butts are usually very circular so it should be good for you.             The butts in Glass Mask 2005 are very noticeable However I will not post butt of musume        I never did finish watching this.       moving around to make the ass more fuckable    Oh jhesis.      The manga was terrible    I know this shit is not from a hentai. What is the context?    I'm uh I'm gonna need a source on this     Kanokon      God Her butt is so perfect. I wish her sisters was as good.      God   Her butt is so perfect. I wish her sisters was as good.  Ryuko's is nice but her boobs are better than Satsuki's.     Asses are nature's miracles   You're right. Cheers for appreciating all of the femininely bounties.     You took the words right out of my mouth.    A delicate balance is nirvana, though if I had to choose, I'd prefer a flatter chest with a more plush butt.     A delicate balance is nirvana, though if I had to choose, I'd prefer a flatter chest with a more plush butt.  I'd go the exact opposite with that.     It's good we can agree to disagree in the most appropriate of manners.    Each to their own.     It's good we can agree to disagree in the most appropriate of manners.  Can't agree on everything now can we? Oh, well at least we can post pictures of butts.   Nice butt.       For some reason I imagine satsuki really liking anal. I am not sure why, but I always imagine her talking about having enough resolve to pleasure her lover with all of her body or something like that.    Couldn't agree more. I'm just refreshed by the civility of it all.    This is a cute boy     For some reason I imagine satsuki really liking anal.  So I'm not the only one.   I am not sure why, but I always imagine her talking about having enough resolve to pleasure her lover with all of her body or something like that.  Sounds like her talking to herself during puberty.   Couldn't agree more. I'm just refreshed by the civility of it all.  So do big butts bring civilized conversations?          bonus feet if ur into taht kinda shit     Please don't meme shame her.  Also, lolis with plump yet stiff round asses are also exquisite miracle.       So do big butts bring civilized conversations?  Perhaps so.      This is a cute boy      Perhaps so.  Let's keep going on with this. We may be on to something.     This could very well be the start of a profound new philosophy.    Satsuki would be incredibly competitive during sex. If you brought up liking liking anal she would let you fuck her ass every single day until you got sick of it. If you brought up enjoying femdom, she would tie you up and take care of all your "needs" until the chair you were tied to was stained with semen and vaginal fluids. I can almost imagine if you brought up wanting an FFM threesome, she would bring you a harem and not feel slightly jealous because she knows no one would choose anyone over her.    It is one that I can, for a lack of better words, get behind.     tfw no alpha female      Satsuki would be incredibly competitive during sex.  Meaning?   If you brought up liking liking anal she would let you fuck her ass every single day until you got sick of it. If you brought up enjoying femdom, she would tie you up and take care of all your "needs" until the chair you were tied to was stained with semen and vaginal fluids. I can almost imagine if you brought up wanting an FFM threesome, she would bring you a harem and not feel slightly jealous because she knows no one would choose anyone over her.  I like. I have a feeling that she would be still dominate or establish dominance.        What kind of father lets his daughter dress like that        You're the whitest man on this board right now. How does it feel?   裏私利物か?      My kind of thread  These threads are so pointless on a sfw board. What's the point of butt without butthole. It's like cake without icing. http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2739661</wbr>       You're the whitest man on this board right now.  I wish this meme would die     She would be in control, but not necessarily control you if the distinction between the two is clear enough. She would know how to get you like what she likes without forcing it upon you. The only person she might get jealous of is Ryuuko if you were caught ogling her.    An absentee one.    I don't like excessive icing on my cake. Plus, straight up ass cheeks are quite fun in their own way. Read between the cracks, Anon.  Also, if anyone has any Togame from Katanagatari I'd be quite grateful.        why have i not seen this image before?    A very bad one.    ?     She would be in control, but not necessarily control you if the distinction between the two is clear enough. She would know how to get you like what she likes without forcing it upon you. The only person she might get jealous of is Ryuuko if you were caught ogling her.  I get it now. Me I'm for her sister more. I don't think Ryuko would have any preferences and would just want to have fun in the bed.     I pretty much need nothing but this in my life, Anon.    Maybe she would be a little clingy but I'm probably thinking about Nonon.    this whole thread   I wish I had a friend to share a plump anime butt with. Taking turns fucking the tight hole, creaming it and getting it nice and lubed for the other. So lewd and sloppy.   I agree. I would prefer Ryuuko as well, but there is little point in not appreciating her sister too.   Ryuuko would be the kind of girl to hear a rumor, whether online or just on the street, of some moderately well known kink, such as nekomimi or paizuri, and enthusiastically bring it up to you. Then when she finally convinces you to do so, not that it would be too hard, she walks out of the room, When you ask where she is going she says "I am going to change. What? Didn't you say you wanted to try it?". She then recklessly engages in said kink for the rest of the night giving little credence to what might be scheduled the next day, whether it be work or school.      you have us. But i'd rather loli ass.     I wish I had a friend to share a plump anime butt with. Taking turns fucking the tight hole, creaming it and getting it nice and lubed for the other. So lewd and sloppy.  Thanks for typing the lewdest thing I've seen today.     This boy's assn is indeed cute.

Ypu guys are the only ones that understand my pervertrd butt lust.    Lewd is fun!      I come bearing ass    Lewd is fun!  But there can be too much lewd.      how much is too much        Nobuemon's ass   Width &gt; Depth Who's with me?    Good gracious ass bodacious     MFW   how much is too much  When it becomes a problem.          How lewd is too lewd?    She would wear any of us down. All she'd have to do is start clinging to your arm, put her hand on your thigh, nibble your ear, and trace her hand up and down your body slowly and gently. She'd grab your hand and have you do the same with her body. She'd take a pause from nibbling on your ear to whisper "So I heard there is this moe catgirl stuff. What sound do they make? Nyaaaaaaa~? Is that the right sound Anon-kun?" She would put her hand down your pants and begin to feel you up and then leave hot heavy breaths in your ear with the words "I always wanted to be one of those catgirls Anon-kun and I think I have the 'being in heat' part of it down. So don't you want to try it?"    I think that just means you like hips better than asses.     Woah, ass ahoy.     When it tears a hole in reality.        Would you lick your waifu's asshole, or any other 2D asshole if she had hemorrhoids?    homu homu       She would wear any of us down.

She would put her hand down your pants and begin to feel you up and then leave hot heavy breaths in your ear with the words "I always wanted to be one of those catgirls Anon-kun and I think I have the 'being in heat' part of it down. So don't you want to try it?"   MFW  I don't think I would resit long. I'd give a minute and a half.         homu homu  Or until the Mods think it's enough. Whatever comes first.        what if...we make a chart for the behind too?   kiss my ass  More straightforward title since my balls.      This angle is amazeballs   Jelly.         By that logic, all non-black women with big asses are black. One-drop rule.     They really should call spats butt enhancers.      amazeballs   lord  deliver  me  from  this  nightmare                 This is the best thread on /a/ You're all gentlemen and gentleladies And gentlewtfeverelse         I can still not believe they translated it as that. To this day it is one of the dumbest things I have seen in subtitles.             What about mom butt?                 I was going to call the OP a faggot, but then I saw your post. Faggot.    This was about farming    That's actually Haru from nisekoi.               Alright, I'm about to finish here. Could you post a few loli asses to see who will be the winner?                       No dancing loli butts?    Xebec   context      Those butts look saggy flaps of skin because of that crease in the bloomers.    While not the best, this was just enough for me to finish, thank you anon.   Yamada is back!!  https://<span>youtu.be/mp-uVtk7AQ4  [ ]      wagnaria   yamada  Kill yourself     A lot of Poplar in the preview. I like it.  What the fuck happened to the visual style. Looks generic as fuck   Do you have the jojo part 7 version of the is gif? where johnny and gyro are doing it.    I'm going to overload from the Asumi Kana in both Working and NNB.   Yamada~ Yamada~  I want to bully Yamada!   Please no bully. Yamada is for loving.        loving  Not until you stop breaking them plates.    wanwan or panpan?   Count it as a feature   How good will be the new OP? Hope it's as catchy as the previous ones.   Yamada is easily the worst part of Wagnaria.   I'm not even a Yamadafag but clearly Inami is the worst part of both the show and restaurant.    Inami's the only excessively violent female character I don't find annoying.   I can't wait for more interactions with the Katanashi family.     im too excited for this.      im willing to bet a million wagnaria dollars that the owner still hasnt found his wife    I'm willing to bet 10 million rupees the owner drowned his wife in the sea and has been out enjoying his retirement ever since.    I feel you, anon. New/a/ uses localized names and there's nothing we can do about it.          I hate Yamada            wagnaria   localized pv  Fuck off cancer     why does she keep her eyes closed all the time?   Got a job at actual restaurant. There're no cute girls and my feet hurt from 12 hrs shifts.  Why did this show lie to me?      12 hrs shifts   oh yes. real life hurts aint it?        12 hr shifts     Honestly this is my favorite part of the show.    This. Her violence is more of a reflex and she's clearly trying her best to change that part of herself.   am hype  more nazuna pls    Well /a/?

As always, me under the bed.    vampire   Milf  slut   How would you even have that?    Lolis giving birth to even smaller lolis.    Loli to loli, ashes to ashes.    Adorable.    infinite universe    Genki lolis are the best.   succubus   We'll call it the loliverse.     What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?  The smug character archetype.     Alcoholic.   Loli baa-sans  The wise old master.  mountain climbing archetype  this   That would be insanely cute. And they would grow up to become lolis forever.  This is brilliant.      'Mature' loli who has an affair with a married man archetype.   That's no loli.    It's a space station.    Me with no pan    Me showing my drawings.    This   School girl that is secretly a prostitute archetype.  Possessed yandere robot brown elf childhood friend.   me on the right    Hi.      Draw a loli   Call it a mother   Still qualifies as a milf in my book.        Checked.    The loli    I'm the Paladin on the right, Bard pls    It's just a hug, don't worry.    You mean like some sort of double loli?   Tsundere lesbian loli.   But I don't want your damn cracker; and where are your panties? Have you no shame?     Have you no shame?  She's a bard.    Sorceress &lt;3   I don't see how that would work.    As cute bard loli myself, I make sure to never wear any panties around my cute loli friends.    What  said.   Oppai   Thats lewd, anon    me on the left taking a selfie tbh    Swap swordmage and cleric. A cleric would not be caught with such an exposed cunny.    edge and gore   Cunny !   You will never impregnate your trash can and have it birth your loli daughter who you then proceed to fuck    http://exhentai.org/s/9cd7c92cee/82<wbr>6867-16</wbr>      Can we rub cunnies together anon-chan?    Only if otou-san's dick is between them. It's not yuri if the cunnies dont touch     Threadly reminder that "cunnyposting" has no positive impact on the thread.       What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?   Everything. Loli tsunderes, loli moms, loli nerds, loli kings/queens, loli aliens, undead lolis...      p-papa iku ikuuu    Dicks are gross, I just want a cuddle party.    What's the sense of having a priest and a medic in the same roster? Usually priests are medics.   Gave this a read. The scar marks where off-putting at first.   I liked the other girl more.    Medic is a better healer, Priest has buffs and heals.    Me on the left taking a selfie with the second cutest loli in our group.    rip my dick     at first.   I couldn't get over them I tried but nah.  Shit was disgusting        Has this guy ever actually done any loli yuri, or is it just lolis looking at each other suggestively? I'd even take f/f/m    While Rina is cute, I still prefer Yukino   who is this penis piglet?    swordmage  It's called a spellsword      f/f/m  Hes done FFM before.  no yuri, that i know of.       Not in  4e  it isn't.    This one.    Fake lolis are shit    Fake lolicons are shit.    You mean fake fat breasted, grown woman.    Femdom loli x trap  So I can self insert as cute pretty boy being dominated by a sexually aggressive loli    Why is loli being punished?  translate it, weebs      getting mentally destroyed by loli  Ah, heavenly feels.     What is she trying to indicate with her finger?   How does /a/ feel about monstergirl lolis?   I'd rub them all the same    Not as good as human lolis, but still much better than old hags.    I'd pet and cuddle the fuck out of them.    That she was drawn by a shitty artist who didn't know what to do with the hands he sucks at drawing.    I like when monstergirls have weird vaginas that dont look human. When you slap a human vagina on a snake monstergirl or a frog girl or whatever it just looks boring, they need interesting vaginas in order for them to be sexy.    Something like Harpy lolis having cloaca instead of the usual human parts?    What are your thoughts on dwarf lolis? Beards or no beards?    Refer to Outbreak Company.    yeah, its interesting.   The weirder the vagina, the more of an adventure it would seem to fuck such a thing. Which is why i think is why monstergirls are so popular, its the adventure humoring the idea of what it would be like fucking some alien creature. But thats just my opinion.    i dont like lolis with beards.         Which one, Rin or Ophis?  Either way you're wrong.      But how would you know she's a dwarf if she doesn't have a beard?      Where does it end? You got to think about it.    Fuck no I ain't! F.forgive me my beautiful loli daughter.     When the loli starts getting sickly/looking ugly.   Edgy teens like accelerator     Loli². A double layered loli. This is insane, the loli density is too high, it'd theoretically create a black hololi.        You made the right choice    Mr bones.jpg    Don't ever leave my side, I don't know what I would do without you.  It looks like it is me that needs you now.      ohh~ papa~    Never thought of that  yfw the beard grows before scalp hair on a newborn      I want to spoil you so bad. Give you all sorts of exotic cars and exotic candies and stuff.   I fucking hate lolis...   Yeah well loli loves you.    Leopard was the best loli of the year.    But anon.  All lolis are the best of the year. Always     Artist? I recognize the style, but I can't recall the person.    you should check the recent drawthreads. someone drew a few lewds of that character.     Just this once  http://exhentai.org/g/605116/7477a2<wbr>5a63/</wbr>  Never say I didn't love you, my fellow lolicon.      Much obliged, comrade.    No they don't they are incapable of love as they are only color lights on a screen, and have no sentience what so ever. Even if that character on the screen had some sort of emotion simulating AI it's still just a simulation. They are not inoccent, they are not evil, they are not young nor old, they dont exist... Waifu/husbando fags suck it!   Bump?   Or just marks of graphite, charcoal, pastel, paint ect...     ai  Oh it's only pretending to feel then? Yea nah, she's not a real woman, that's why she loves me.       Not sentiant    love       sentient girl   love for anything that isn't money or luxury  Lolis may not be real  yet  but they sure as hell can love.       Waifu/husbando fags suck it!  /cgl/ pls go and stay go    In a world without norms or STDs, would fucking a Loli be possible?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127102448   fuck off.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127102448  No, fuck you.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127102448   Are we getting raided?     No I'm being serious here.    /a/ isnt the place to ask those kinds of questions.    Then you're a shitty crossboarder and should die.

Loli adventurers sound fun as fuck.    I too want aussie translation. Such a cruel teaser.    Oh shit dude    Squeeze the vulva !

Awesome.      sheeple     Bitch pls    i suddenly have an intense craving for applejuice   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105471  http://exhentai.org/g/826203/68cef6<wbr>24d5/</wbr>   g'night /l/  Red Wizard of Thay.    providing sauce for dead people      giving sauce to normies     Curious, do you guys know these off by heart or do you have some magic reverse search that works for partial images? Thanks, by the way.  I-I'm not dead!  Forgive me for not having the entirety of sad panda downloaded and playing on my wall of computers.          ban evading     Oh my that's spooky.   Thinking of the future generations of anons looking at cropped images in the archive. This abides by my principles.   Google works differently for everybody. When in doubt, check sadpanda's frontpage.           Genki tomboy.    ban evading   doesn't know how to search for sauce   is probably a literal cocksucking spermlord          I expected him to ask about the panda, at least he didn't.    Your mistakes are your own to make, tripfag.    They didn't even give me a warning. I'm sorry, I never realised I was supposed to start a thread on /r/, post the same images, and hope the people here, who clearly know what it is, just happen to see the other thread, which is, again, on a different board. I'm working on a partial image recognition suite, I hope it to be done soon. For now, I suffer the shame.        &gt;doesn't know how to search for sauce  No, and I'd love to know how I could. Reverse search turned up nothing, unless there's a better service I don't know of, and they didn't hint at, wait, shit. Look up duplicate posts on the archive, right? Fuck me I'm dumb.         Thinking of the future generations of anons looking at cropped images in the archive. This abides by my principles.  Giving sauce to any random normstain who is just stopping by for a guiltfap isnt propper form. You realize these types of newfolks are likely hypocrites who haet lolicons/these thread, right?    Shh...   loli is sleeping      Dont worry about it.  Everyone's asked for sauce at some point.     I can handle the blame, it's part of being a tripfaggot.   Best advice is to lurk more. You can't look up something on the archive when it is the first time being posted.   And when do you suggest it is proper form? This event will repeat it's cycle until who knows when. The archive exists for a reason.  It depends on him on how he would react to the source, but it's not fair to assume all newfolks are generally the same hypocrites and shitposters we know in these threads. It's not about defending the anon, but we're all newfags once.            You should put her to bed. Lolis need to sleep comfortably.     That's a creature.    Wet    They are very sensitive to sound. Make sure to stay very very quiet.        Here's an interesting idea, we should make a natural park for creatures. That way they can roam free without any fear in a natural environment.  And tourist could come and watch those beautiful creatures from afar/      They have those. They are called "play grounds"    You guys sure are assuming a lot about me.    Murderous psychopath lolis are the best.    Hm. A creature park sounds like a great idea.  ...until they escape their environment and go on a deadly rampage.      Then obviously we build walls to make sure they don't escape.  We wouldn't want them to damage the ecosystem.      Just throw a couple of onii-chans in there, they won't even think about leaving    Wouldn't that risk creating overpopulation issues down the line?   The NEET genius   Nice tumblr gif.      No. Why would that even happen      go to sleep, loli    im the druid with the cat pillow    you're a fluid-druid    Why is this 9 year old so sexy?    Why are oppai lolis so much better than regular lolis?    All 9 year olds are sexy.     no yuri, that i know of.  What a waste.    Best loli h-manga.   I wouldn't know I haven't read it because I can't find it.    Not really.    http://exhentai.org/g/719766/f155fe<wbr>d306/</wbr>    The vaginas are pretty nice.    So puffy    Yuri is boring though, extended foreplay with no main event.     Rubbing puffy vaginas together   Boring      There's no risks, consequenses and very little going on on a social and interpersonal level when both partners are innocent, unaware, incapable of reproduction and engaging in legal activities.    woah, really?    The perfect kind of loli hentia.    Mein bruder.    But that's completely dull, sex and by extension porn is meant to be exciting, excitement cannot exist without risk or the exertion of power.   Good morning /l/!!  Me on the left.    Not being turned on by cuteness.    Yandere and/or reverse trap.     In that respect Yuri feels very false or hollow in it's cuteness. The individual components are cute but the totality simply falls flat. I can't quite describe why but I suspect it might have something to do with the lack of power imbalances in the relationship.     I-i'm that other loli.    Yuri isnt erotic because there is no "man" Loli isnt just about being cute, its about being corruptible, and the contrast of utmost cuteness versus the grotesque, old fat men arent too erotic on their own, but when mixed with loli its a combination of beauty and primal "realness" of the male form, which makes the loli more attractive. The japanese have realized this dynamic of fitting extremes together since ancient times. Putting loli with loli is like making a peanutbutter sandwich with no bread.     Quite eloquently put. Indeed corruption, power and contrast do sit at the heart of all that is titillating.      smelly adult dicks  probably the best thing ever.     I loved that manga   Why is /a/ filled with slutty little girls who want the D?   Why is grass green and why does the sun shine? It is simply the natural order of things.     lolis are sexually frustrated.     tfw no otou-san     But dicks are gross, why not just  hold hands  with other cute lolis?     dicks are gross  thats why theyre great!     This one gets it.   lolis are stylish !    oh wow this looks like something I've never read before   that pic from before   the title   females only  I don't even know why I thought it would have dickings of the loli.        The more I like a character, the more I enjoy seeing them raped and degraded, so I'm okay with this.   Especially if they're also molesters. Preferably bisexual.      What is it about those blue shirts and yellow hats? Whats the appeal?   They're cute. I prefer the hats, though.     Proof of freshness.     Loli molesting other lolis.   Stop, my dick can only get this erect.      The randoseru does it for me. Like an ice cream with cherry on top.     Like an ice cream with cherry on top.   cherry  Oh my god. It all makes sense now.      the rape victim.    Or the rapist.    It's a kindergarten uniform, obviously. Best clothing on Earth for young lolis.      What a lewd loli   Don't open it.   Someone stole your loli and replaced it with an evil twin   What do, /a/?     Fendom, what else?    gross    What does she even use that money for?    You don't deserve loli.    phone games.   What would a bunny cunny taste like, /l/?   Blood and piss    fabric and musk   Plain loli is for the peasants Oppai loli is for the burghers Megathighs loli is for the nobility!     that loli had too many burgers    loli piss is the best and is super erotic.   Remember to always cuddle with your loli before bed.    ohyeah     She looks like she's having the cuddle of her life there.    his dick is cuddling her womb    H-h-h-his PENIS Is cuddling her what!?     Why is /l/ always so lewd?     its the summer heat.    I dunno! i'm just parroting things my oniichan says.    Lolis are lewd creatures, therefore /l/ is a lewd board. Have you ever seen how they interact with their oniichans and papas?     Is that why mods hate us?    Probably, yeah. I get real sad when a thread gets deleted or autosaged because I imagine the thread as lolis and the mods as oniichans and papas so when the thread dies I see it as oniichan/papa telling the loli to fuck off after she asks him to play with her. Yes, I'm crazy I know.     loli juice   How much?    What does Lowage Strawberry taste like?    Chicken.    Fresh love, and cuteness.    And what about understanding?    cunny juice    Quiet.    Strawberry, I would assume.   Vanilla.   Always, Understanding is the spice that brightens up the juice.    never.    Always Be Cunny      go away    Best marshmallow character song    No, you go away.   383 days to go   watching SZS                 What do you think of her?   eh, but if you look at Type-moon's visual novels historically they follow a pretty slow release schedule. It was 4 years between Tsukihime and f/sn. I'd start getting worried if we didn't get anything before the end of 2016. Besides, isn't the Tsukihime remake STILL in the works? They have been working on the TV anime in some capacity I assume, then there's the movie... All in all they must be pretty busy having to spread Nasu and Takeuchi over so many projects.    HA does make her okay, but she's a little above Hassan-tier in FSN.    To be fair, Kagetsu Tohya came out between Tsuki and FSN.   Best grills.    Not liking tall, megane, sweater-puppy onee-sans  I like all that, but Rider has a very boring design.  What is HA?  what is the original vn      Donquixote Doflamingos funeral thread  In memorium of the worst One Piece villain who ever existed  In Memorium to a selfish narcissitic sob story cunt  I'm glad he got rightfully finished off by Luffy finally.          Yugioh   I honestly thought that was a joke until the card was thrown         this one technically doesn't count as its distorted by glass    and the last of these 4 quality images from One scene   Doflamingo having a son would be cool though.   post 'em      The Kongō episode would have been great if it had been one episode later and they dropped all the "my best friend's sister just died we have to feel things and cry" horse shit.      that quality  please kill yourself    Age Regression episode is Best Dog Days episode  so far. season 4 when?    Dat proto-Shinji angst being overcome to achieve TTGL-level heavens piercing   Is there any shonen out there that isn't complete shit?   OPM is seinenshit.     2015   WSJ hasn't done a big crossover event.  In one side, that is good. but on the other side it is like they hated money      It isn't a shounen, it's considered a seinen  Also, one of the best manga i've read.     shounen are supposed to start off good then become a shit    What are you, 12?    Who said Nichijou isn't funny? I'm losing my shit here!   people that buy BD  You're a pleb with no taste.</blockquote>]
