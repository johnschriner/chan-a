[ Okay, I'm sold.  <br>Anime Is not terrible but just plain bad.</br>  <br><br>Bad as in naughty, sure. I love it ;^)</br></br>  A loli shinigami will never sit on your lap because of how your killstreak reached the THOUSANDS  Reminder that "pandering" isn't a meme. Sometimes it makes perfect sense.  I've only seen a few minutes of goth loli and I'm already in love.  Goth loli confirmed for girl of the season  Anime Rory a shit  <br>Fuck off manga nerd</br>  <br>right. The show itself is kind of meh, but she has smugfu levels of show carrying potential. Her animated scene are nicely done as well. Very satisfying choreography.</br>  <br>Make me animeonlyshit</br>  <br>Have you ever been in a fight? Because i have.<br>Im pretty sure i could hit you so hard your mother would start bleeding.</br></br>  <br>The only good thing about the anime is Itami's VA, he does a superb job.<br><br>Everything else is off.</br></br></br>  So far the anime has been better than the manga. <br><br>I'm completely serious; the manga is objectively terrible pacing.</br></br>  Join today!  Manga &gt; anime.<br><br>It doesn't even matter what the anime may have done better. Fucking up Rory and Kuribayashi's designs is just too much.</br></br>  <br><br>No Fair!</br></br>  <br> better than the manga <br>So you don't mind butchering of characterisation due to censorship/cut scenes?<br><br> objectively terrible pacing <br>How? The manga did things like explain how the elf was in the well when they found her which the anime hasn't done yet. Also Spending 15 min on how otaku Itami is in the first ep was terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  gothic loli (rori?) saved the show  <br> butchering of characterisation due to censorship <br><br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>    <br>Her voice was the best part of the episode.</br>  <br><br>Same here OP. I watched these three today, and said fuck it and read all the manga.<br><br>While it still has a bit of a harem going on I really do enjoy  the fact the Military is still a strong giant force to not even be touched in their world. Like the premise of something existing that could actually take down the stationed Japan Military just doesn't exist. I wonder how the manga will end, setting up all these different things. I think the most recent chapters where they take down the Fire Dragon was pretty nice, especially with them flying in on the fighters and just demolishing everything. Generally if a character meets a hurdle in the manga and the military can't do anything it's for diplomatic and real reasons instead of some stupid anime tier reasoning. <br><br>But now that I read it all I'm kind of sad. Is there any manga/anime similar to this? Basically two worlds meeting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The they cut out things like how Rory and her goddess don't believe murder or even rape to be a sin just "human nature".</br>  <br><br> vlcsnap </br></br>  Help me, anons, I have become the lowest common denominator. I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime.<br><br><br>Well, there's Outbreak Company. The anime is really good but it's way more focused in politics and pacific relationship than the use of military.<br>There's really one episode where they BTFO a dragon and everyone gets impressed but it doesn't really affect the anime in any way.</br></br></br></br>  What will you do when the far left confirmed as the mastermind for the elaborate ruse and actually the glasses girl didn't have anything to do with it?  <br>The middle one was always reminding me of someone and I finally found about it.</br>  <br>Continue fapping to meganeko</br>  <br>Does it matter? They'll all die anyway.</br>  <br> Tfw the fest one will join them </br>  <br>I did not see this chapter. Was it actively translated in thread?</br>  <br>there is a mega link.<br>check the archive.</br></br>  <br>Left girl is my waifu. Please refrain yourself from masturbating to her any further.</br>  <br>Left is a total babe. I can only hope she is the mastermind</br>  <br>Do you think the middle one will be as lewd as Nagisa?</br>  Keep it in one thread<br><br/></br>  <br>His thread actually has a topic while you are redirecting him to a general.</br>  <br>this will be the next general</br>  <br>The other two will die and the left-chan will join them.</br>  <br>Is the middle one a slut?<br>She'd let you fuck her if youbwere to bring her a bar of chocoloate?</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna fap to her twice as much</br>  <br>The more I think about it the more it makes sense.</br>  <br>Anon, don't bully others.</br>  <br>Sasuga OP. Nobody will find the thread because you put the tag as your name.</br>  Just finished reading the second volume. While the anime has clear differences (much more lighthearted, more focus on the cuter parts) I do think they've done a good job so far. Having Miki present from the start was a positive change I think (even though the mall rescue is a good scene). Is the dog anime only?  <br>No, it had 5 panels in the manga.</br>  <br>yuki fighting windmills when?</br>      Dem rii-riis.  <br>So pretty much nothing. My only real complaint is that whoever typeset the first 2 volumes of the manga did a horrible job.</br>  Does this manga come out monthly? All the manga I like is always monthly dammit.  <br>I think that was intentional.</br>  <br> heavy breathing <br><br><br>I like to think they wanted to show Yuki's not listening.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I actually would have preferred a don quixote style insanity to this school bullshit. I understand it's necessary because of them pretending that everything is normal and the dissonance of everyday life and zombie survival, and that it adds to the sane girls' despair in knowing that they will never be able to go back to the way things used to be. All the same though I'm tired of "School field trips!, Club activites!, School festival!" garbage. Maybe I'm just burned out on school anime and need to take another few months break I don't know.</br>  <br>Are you pretending to be retarded? I hope you are.</br>  <br>No, I thought it was just bad typesetting. What  and  said makes sense though</br>  <br>Why rasterize the text when you can just obscure it by making the other bubble a layer? It's easier than erasing the bits afterwards.</br>  Anyone happens to have links to the thread where the kind anon posted shitty scans and translations of chapters 36-37?  <br>Don't have the thread but this was in my browsing history.<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!Y8VXSbpS!t6Sm<wbr>aC0ERNrvxmad7Ieg_g</wbr></br></br>  <br>An anon actually did that? I understood that chap 37 was the most recent one in Nippon but I didn't think that someone would translate it for us.</br>  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#F!Y8VXSbpS!t6S<wbr>maC0ERNrvxmad7Ieg_g</wbr> <br>Oh shit anon, thanks a lot.</br></br>  <br><br>Are those chapters the end chapters of volume 5, or the start of volume 6?</br></br>  <br>She is so sexy here</br>  <br>Do not sexualize the Gurashis.<br> Who am I kidding, sexualize them all you want, they're hot.  </br></br>  <br>I think that it's the end of vol 5 but I can't really be sure.</br>  <br>Not even the manga artist spares them.</br>  <br>The only problem is the crown on her shirt is horizontal when her shirt is clearly angled there.</br>  <br> a bunch of teenage boys during a zombie apocalypse <br> they believe they are a sentai team destroying tons of mooks </br></br>  <br>That's the best part, these moments are rare and feel natural.</br>  <br>Not even slightly.</br>  <br>Thanks. Annoying that it doesn't say for sure though, throws off the way I list files on my read list</br>  <br>I'm sure you'll be able to handle it. You're a big boy, anon-kun.</br>  <br>Are those pantyhose? On my Shovel?</br>  <br>It hurts my autism severely though</br>  <br>Isn't it more of OCD, or those things go together in cases of /a/utism?</br>  <br>I can't stop masturbating with the left one, what do I do?</br>  The background music in episode 2 sounds like something you'd hear in a VN.<br><br>I like it.</br></br>  <br>When I say autism I don't mean actual autism, I mean meme autism. Probably some sort of mild aspergers or some shit</br>  <br>Aspergers is a form of autism anon.</br>  Do we know how much time has passed since the outbreak?  <br>36 is volume 6, 37 is volume 7. At least that's what I assume, since so far each volume has been 6 chapters.</br>  <br>Text and bubbles are all one layer, because sometimes bubbles and typsetting are done by two different people.</br>  <br>Oh I'm retarded, thought chapter 35 was volume 5. I'll run with that though, sounds logical</br>  So is Yuki more or less aware now?<br>Just pretending to be retarded? <br>Like she snapped and killed the one zombie while cleaning, and since then she's been "more responsible", as the others have said. Plus they're openly talking about everyone being dead, finding survivors, etc.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I didn't think it was possible to improve perfection either until I saw this page.</br>  <br>Yes, Yuki "snapped" out of her delusions sometime around then but she's still pretending to be crazy to cheer everyone up. It's still not enough for Rii who's steadily going crazier</br>  Threadly reminder of best operator and her theme:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7Xm<wbr>DYJBZZdc</wbr>  [ ]</br>    <br>Nuclear is a decent song, but Not your kind of people was much better I thought. Plus, neither are as good as way to fall</br>  <br>Yuki's normal, it's just that nobody wants to formally bring it up for fear of upsetting things.</br>  <br>She's more aware. <br>She even forgot to 'ask Megu-nee' about switching cars, which means that she hasn't been seeing her. When she said that Megu said it was okay that they took the RV, she was just trying to keep up the act. <br>Hard to tell if she's still seeing shit, though. <br>But she is pretending about the little girl for Rii-san's sake, because even Pink can see how close she is to legitimately snapping.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I was only pretending to be retarded </br>  <br>It was less "keeping up the act" and more letting everyone pretend that Rii was only asking about Megu-nee for her sake rather than because she's losing it.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I forgot it was Rii who asked that. <br>Yeah, she's more fucked than I realized.</br></br>    <br>I'm sorry Nuclear is annoying you, anon. I'd change the song to something else, but I'm too lazy to think of a suitable replacement.

She doesn't ask Yuki, she just comes out with "We never asked Megu-nee" to the whole group and Kurumi has to cover for her.</br>   having waifu wars <br> instead of praying for them to stay alive </br>  <br>I want to fuck those straps.</br>  <br>But there is no waifu wars being had here</br>  <br>My point still holds, it's not that she believes in Megu-nee, she just needs Yuki to still be delusional so she can keep playing the big sister for her.</br>  Why are they so popular?  <br>Maybe they taste good?</br>  <br>Well they are literally "yummy sticks".</br>  <br>That's not a point, that's an unsupported belief. It's the same as when she wondered when they could go back to the school, then pretended she was just joking, She doesn't "believe" in her, but she unthinkingly brought her up as if she were real because she's losing it and can't move on from their school life.</br>  <br>Those fucking faces.<br><br>Also its food, and they were running low on supplies.

It's over, I lost all hope of Shovel surviving.  <br>Kurumi should be Kakyoin.</br>  <br>It's the dissonance between what's actually being shown and what one is hearing that provides the most discomfort. Look at Alien Nine's OP.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WKP<wbr>cHCAkOpQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>This entire series was pretty jarring.<br><br>Even during the SoL summer segment, they had some creepy music going on a seemingly happy scene.</br></br></br>  <br>But he comes back.  Then dies first again. </br>  <br> you're not wrong, but fuck you for reminding me </br>  <br>Damn, that author sure like China-Dresses.</br>  <br> Alien Nine <br>I'm trying to feel optimistic about the Gurashis here, anon. I didn't need to remember this, not now.</br></br>    <br>From the thumbnail it kinda looks like she has short hair and a fluffy tail</br>  Why doesn't shovel just amputate her arm off?  <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Anywhere from 3 months to a year.<br>Time doesn't really matter when there's no society to go with it.</br></br>  <br>It matters when you're rationing supplies.</br>  Why is the art so good.  As much as I like putting on the /u/ goggles for scenes like these, I know it's just the author setting up one of them for ultimate despair when they die/turn  <br>I'm digging her.</br>  I want to hold Miki's hands and tell her everything will be diejoubu    <br>Yuuri is such a cutie in the manga. I still haven't warmed up to her anime design yet.</br>  <br>Why always /u/?<br><br>If anything, they look like two good battle-buddies who have gone to hell and back together. <br><br>It's absolutely romantic, but not in a way /u/ wants it.<br><br>It is actually pretty manly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Stephen King The Stand <br> No Steppen King The Standard <br><br>why.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because /u/ is cute<br><br>But it doesn't matter because  the uni girls will kill kurumi  when  they realize she's a carrier </br></br></br>  <br>This. Gakkou Gurashi pulls off the female version of bros and bromance pretty well.</br>  <br>It actually does considering Randall Corp had planned this thing to only go on for a certain amount of time. If its only been a few weeks than thats fine but if its been months then thats a sign that shit is more grave than we thought.<br><br>Right now shit is fucked and theres a limited amount of the anti-zombie medicine and it won't be long until Kurumi needs more. Do we have any idea if the group took any with them?</br></br></br>  <br> they realize she's a carrier <br>The real question is who is going to let it slip?<br>Yuki seems too obvious, and since Rii is getting crazier by the issue, I'm guessing it'll be her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>12 hours later, it's that time again.<br><br>Do your worst /a/</br></br></br></br>  Is she ready to inherit the shovel?  <br> Miki, remember the basics of CQS </br>  So Yuki's character arc basically lasted from the first chapter up until graduation?<br>It was all worth it in the end I guess<br><br>If we're currently in Rii's arc, we still have at least two more to go</br></br></br>  It is not a teddy bear<br><br>I is a real loli.<br><br>Also, why is yuki such a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>Then why didn't she have any food on her plate in the van?</br>   blatant, in-your-face hints that Ruu is an inanimate object <br> people are still in denial <br><br>how the fuck do you manage to be so delusional?<br>just why on earth would she of all people survive all alone in a zombie-ridden school while completely preserving her sanity? How did Yuki not hear her while the almost completely mentally broken Rii somehow did?<br><br>wake the fuck up</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuki's character development is still going on, she went from Rii supporting her in her delusions to now acting delusional in purpose to keep Rii somewhat sane, doing the same as she did for her before, acting as her emotional support.<br><br>It's really cute, these two are my favorite characters and their interactions are pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Rii's face so funny?<br><br><br>Probably BECAUSE the hints are so blatant and in-your-face. Still think she's a bear, though. If she was real it'd be quite the asspull.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people think the author is pulling a fast one on us. I mean, I get what they mean but I still can't see it.</br>  <br>she will obviously never lose her role as their emotional support<br><br>but she isn't crazy anymore, that's the point</br></br></br>  <br>The point was that that Yuki is doing for Rii what Rii did before for her.<br><br>That's development right there.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she could do something to be Rii-san's protectorate again.<br>It's heartbreaking seeing her be in such a state.</br></br>  <br>They're all half-zombies as well, that's why they're outcast from the infected-paranoid crossbow faction. They'll either help Kurumi or try to make her abandon her friends.</br>  So who is best girl?<br><br>I think it's really hard to tell</br></br>  <br>There are three choices because you can't include dead people or bears or worst girls like Rii-san.</br>  <br>Fuck you<br><br><br>Everyone</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all basically equal, but<br>Yuki &gt; Shovel &gt; Miki &gt; Rii<br><br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you clones?</br></br>  <br> Miki above anyone <br>She's boring as fuck and literally doesn't do shit.</br></br>  <br><br> liking the girl that is most likely going to get the group killed with her bullshit <br> B-B-B-BUT SHE HAS TITS ;____; <br><br>also reminder Rii is legitimately more insane than Yuki now</br></br></br></br></br>   All this Rii hate <br><br>Fuck you guys, we were having a nice thread.</br></br>  <br>Yuki.</br>  <br> liking the girl that is most likely going to get the group killed with her bullshit <br>I don't deny that she'll probably do that, but she has been an important asset to the group up until Kurumi was  bitten. </br></br>  <br>She's nowhere near as insane as Yuki was before.<br><br> Hating someone because she's breaking down <br><br>Fuck you, I've liked Rii since chapter 1.<br>I bet you're a shovelfag like everyone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>That's an interesting theory. But the girls found the refuge (and the vaccine) by accident. Seeing the uni boy and girls actively above ground probably means they haven't found the bunker yet. And seeing how the boy reacted regarding infection, I find it hard to believe the group provided the vaccines instead of killing the infected.</br>  <br>Yuki was crazy, but she wasn't dangerous. Rii is literally endangering the group with her bullshit, as seen with crossbow-kun</br>  Reminder that Rii will kill the group  <br>And by venturing alone into an infested building. Despite Yuki's delusions, she was well aware of danger. Like Megu-nee telling her to not go home on the first chapter.</br>  <br>Wait, she was keeping a kitchen knife hidden inside a desk?</br>  <br>Definitely worst girl.</br>  You know what both the anime and manga needs? A male character for the group.<br><br>And they all love him. Also he's super perfect.</br></br>  <br>It was originally wrapped up inside</br>  <br>The anime does have a male in the group.

Yuki had Megu-nee, her rational subconscious, always tell her that things could be dangerous, thus keeping her safe. Fucking Rii doesn't have anyone in her head to keep her from harm's way. Because she nearly got herself killed, she's a liability to the group at this point and will only make things worse because she can no longer tell what things are safe whenever Ruu is involved.<br><br>Also, Crossbowfaggot would probably have not shot at them if Rii let go of Ruu.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean she went outside of the barricades to save Miki. The only part where she did anything really dangerous was at the mall, but at least she saved Miki. I'll agree that she shouldn't have, though.<br><br><br>It's true, you know. She tried risking everyone to save her sister, and when it was clear the elementary school was lost she still tried to get them to keep looking and even tried to delay them when they started to leave. Then she ignored all logic and disregarded survival and went in by herself. And at the university, she'd rather risk getting shot than letting go of the bear. It's clear she values the bear above her own life, and that's a very dangerous thing. If she risks herself to save the bear, people will risk themselves to save her. Yuki didn't have anything like that.<br><br>Haven't you noticed people started shitting on Rii twice as hard ever since you started trying and failing to defend her?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are already a zombie.<br>But it doesn't have to be so.<br>You can make the most out of your life if you try.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HFp<wbr>zp10Qr4o</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> the omega strain is... well... god save us for what is yet to come. <br>I thought the omega strain was the zombie strain.</br></br>  <br>I actually agree, Yuki is the best after all</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5yw<wbr>r1k1acis</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Omega strain: <br> ...at the domain level... <br> ...do not apply. <br> ...cardiac arrest... <br> ...omega mark... do... use... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GG is actually a war-story, focussing on the survival aspect.<br>Only the yuri-shitters want to ruin that with their depraved degeneracy.</br></br>  <br>Yuki never endangered everyone trying to protect Megu-nee.<br>QED</br></br>  <br>Sometimes I forget how awesome Cathat actually is.</br>  <br>Omega strain is definitely zombies.</br>  <br>The male-lead is super handsome too.</br>  <br> She followed Mii-kun because Mii-kun was going beyond the barrier by herself. Yuki had Megu-nee, her rational subconscious, always tell her that things could be dangerous, thus keeping her safe. <br><br>Mii-kun still had to save her, don't you remember? It wasn't Megu-nee, but Mii-kun the one that had to keep her safe at that time, using her coins, same when she shouts and Kurumi has to keep away the zombies. Megu-nee only seems to kick in when she's alone.<br><br>Taking that into account, she was still putting people into danger, something people who bash Rii for being "more dangerous" conveniently forget.<br><br> Also, Crossbowfaggot would probably have not shot at them if Rii let go of Ruu. <br>But that's exactly what I said though. He wouldn't have shot but he would've still aimed at them, keep in mind that he still ambushed them before noticing the teddy bear. And as I said too, he only shot Rii, not the everyone, so she didn't endanger the whole party, and he still did make a great fucking deal out of someone holding a Teddy bear.<br><br>I'm not saying Rii is not potentially dangerous, but saying she's shit and going to kill them all is a huge exaggeration, specially considering Yuki was delusional before too and people were not calling her shit because of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was also ecchi shit.</br>  <br>hotd was a pile of dog shit</br>  <br> Haven't you noticed people started shitting on Rii twice as hard ever since you started trying and failing to defend her? <br>Yeah, because the insults thrown at her above before I even started this discussion were totally warranted right? Not to mention I'm not the only Rii fan.<br><br> Yuki didn't have anything like that. <br>I'll just refute this point because there is no sense in refuting things that actually happened (RIi getting shot, Rii risking her life in the elementary school). <br><br>Yuki did put people into danger with her delusions. She put MIi-kun into danger going outside the barricades and she put everyone into danger shouting in the middle of zombies. If it wasn't for Megu-nee saving her at times (the library) or the others protecting her and following her in her antics so she didn't get hurt, she would've very much been dead after a while.<br><br>Just because the plot protected Yuki it doesn't mean she wasn't dangerous, for fuck's sake, I don't know why is it this hard to drill it into your brain.<br><br>I'm also not denying that Rii-san is a potential danger to the party, I'm just saying that people shitting on her is entirely unjustified, or at least exaggerated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When Mii-kun snaps, everyone dies.</br>  We all know homu is great, but which homu is the greatest homu?  <br>Bunny homu is best homu</br>  <br>A dead homu.</br>  <br>shit man thats edgy</br>  <br>You mean a bunny homu</br>  <br><br>It's more edgy to like this selfish bitch</br></br>  Homura is shit  <br><br>You a shit taste</br></br>  <br>Then tell me what is so good about this harlot</br>  <br>She can golf with me and go to the shooting range to practice shooting.

Like how the hell did he bulk up so suddenly after death?</br>  <br>I always thought the corpse was little more than a catalyst for the Raise Medium Undead spell, not that corpse itself became a death knight.</br>  <br>So we're getting Death Knight and basic new world infodump next.</br>  <br>Which of his 700+ spells is this?</br>  <br><br><br>Farmer lv 1<br>Sergeant lv 1<br>Commander lv 2<br>General lv 2<br><br>I dunno.. it seems agriculture might not be her true calling.. Just a thought</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The LN says the Death Knight is around 230cm tall, which is tall but not fucking gigantic like the one in the anime looks.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's big. 230cm tall in the translation. And it generated a foll set of equipment it might as well bulk up the base body.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense.</br>  <br>It's not a spell. It's a class special ability.</br>  <br>Well, they got the "It no longer looked human" "It was more like a beast" part right.</br>  <br>X cum y. Basic latin.</br>  <br>From Wiki:<br>  If Death Knight is summoned normally, it will cease to exist after a short time  <br> but if it is summoned in combination with a corpse, the Death Knight seems to become a permanent existence.  <br><br>You're probably right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do we know how many of his spells the author has described yet?</br>  <br>He used a good chunk of them in vol 3.<br>Shark Cyclone a best.</br></br>  <br>And the biggest bonus is that Ainz has that 4/12/20 for his high/mid/low undead summons per day. <br><br>Said limits don't apply if he uses corpses and just mana. Though it's not said anywhere how much his massive mana pool supports per day. 50 low-tiers? 200? 500?<br><br>Thus he needs his corpse supplies and experiments on how strong "base" he can use for low/mid/high tier summons. <br><br>If Sunlight Scriptures fairly experienced mooks allowed the undead to reach ~40 iirc before experiencing, I really doubt human bases in general go higher than low or early mod tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>700 spells from 16 different systems, so I doubt we have seen each of those. He seems to favor certain systems though as he was support in-game.</br>  <br>Was Iguvua one of those tests?</br>  <br>before expiring* thanks brain.</br>  Post the best and your favorite Ainz magic/spell. Use spoiler tags if it's not in the 4 volumes translated so far.<br><br>Personally, I'll go with:<br><br>Best:  [La Shub Niggurath]  I hope he uses it more than once in upcoming volumes even though it's so heinous a spell.<br><br>Favorite: [Falldown].  Shalltear  never saw it coming.<br><br>I like [Grasp Heart] as well. Ainz knows what's up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely, though if I remember right his char sheet, he had a monster base, no? And 41 probably refers to him being 41. test sample.</br>  So do they revive a human later on in the story to serve the tomb? Or are they all so below their level that it wasn't worth it?  <br>He at least used Wail of the Banshee but I was hoping he'd use something more classic like Finger of Death/Power Word: Kill in the early volumes.</br>  <br>Hmm, let's see.<br><br>Best: Are skills included? Because I'd go with  The goal of all life is death <br><br>Favorite: Sharks Cyclone. Sharknado. Hell yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will they make Narberal cute?</br>  <br><br> Forgetting Perfect Warrior <br>Momon would like a word with you.</br></br></br>  <br>The human would have to quite impressive to get his/hers seat in Nazarick.<br><br>Only 2 (up until 9th vol) are there, one has the seat as per Ainz wishes and the one might have to run away from Empire.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, he can't use magic in that so no.</br>  I hear this shit is based on D&amp;D's system.<br> Are there any muscle wizards? </br>  <br>Doesn't look like they'll be censoring much, if at all.</br>  DO NOT OPEN<br><br>IT MAY CAUSE HEART ATTACK</br></br>  <br>Could be the perspective, but yeah, the DK looks taller than the houses in the background in one of the shots. That's beyond 230cm.<br><br>That being said, every character looks taller in the anime than they really are. Ainz is 177, yet looks massive. Sebas too, at 181,</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people pretend to like Narberal?</br>  <br>New world denizens have "Martial Arts" which matches weeaboo fightan magic in D&amp;D.</br>  <br>Muscle wizards don't really exist in D&amp;D anon, unless you count monks.<br><br>And it's not EXACTLY based on D&amp;D, but there are certain similarities you'll notice. It helps that the "spooky-skeleton-summoning necromancer" archetype was basically invented by D&amp;D.</br></br></br>  <br>Do we have their character cards?</br>  <br>None so far, the strongest attacker NPC "humanoid" for Nazarick is Inner/Outer Ki master and such among being dragonic and monk/martial king. Probably the closest match.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's good. This story needs some real gore in certain parts to get across the mood.<br>I was watching GATE the other day and I found the lack of violence when they invaded Tokyo to be a bit off-putting.<br><br><br> smugpapa.jpg </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Afaik nope.</br>  <br>To be honest, I find it a bit silly in the books when the author basically describes how they're "activating abilities", like it's a fucking MMO. I mean okay if it's a specific magical spell, but a warrior who has learned a certain technique wouldn't refer to it as a "special skill" to be "activated". Perhaps it's just the translation?</br>    <br>They call the melee skills out loud for activation in raws/audio drama too. Not all though like Brain's Field and few others.</br>  <br>Their Martial Arts are fueled by concentration/focus rather than mana. I just assume it's a kiai thing to bolster concentration.</br>  <br>Yes they do. It's a broken build with cancer mage and festering anger.</br>  <br>Do we have the character cards Cocytus and Sebas at least?</br>  What would mean "Create Greater Item" in proper english?  <br>"Create [Greater Item]"</br>  Thanks to that one anon who linked the mega earlier for me. <br><br>I've been reading the LNs and I'm totally hooked, though I'm a bit peeved at how nonchalantly Ainz apparently tortured those knights to death for information. I get it, they weren't good people, and sure, he's a lich now, with limited empathy for his fellow humans, but still it was just bit too quick a transition in my opinion. And while he seems to be aware of the mental changes, he doesn't even mention how it might have been disturbing his previous self. All he thinks is that "damn, shouldn't have killed them so fast :(( might have gotten more info!"<br><br>Perhaps it's more fleshed out later on, but at the moment it feels like a bit too radical a change without being addressed at all. Would have appreciated a torture scene where Ainz rationalizes why it's necessary, to illustrate how he's changing.<br><br><br>That's kind of fine honestly. Standard fare for anime characters to yell the name of their skills outloud, but it was more that in written format, it looked weird how they apparently also call it a "special skill" to be "activated". If I learn a judo throw, I wouldn't ever say that I'm "activating" it, I'm rather performing it. Again, perhaps a translation issue.<br><br><br>Well sure, like I stated above, I don't mind them yelling it out. It's more how it's worded in the LNs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about "Create: Great Item"? I feel uneasy with "greater item", is it just me?</br>  Why she are so perfect?  <br>Greater sounds better.</br>  <br>Well they're item tiers so it feels okay to me. Greater being high probably and so on.</br>  <br>No idea man.</br>  <br>it's greater because there's usually a baseline that things are described as greater or lesser than the baseline.</br>  <br>I'm only familiar with 3.5e, is this something new in 4e? <br><br>To be honest, D&amp;D has too many supplements to have a complete overview over every last prestige class combo, but at least with the base classes, it's not very easy to make.<br>(Of course, as a high level wizard you might as well just polymorph into a dragon and "muscle" your way through that way.)<br><br><br>It's a pretty common jargon in RPGs. <br> Minor <br> Lesser <br> Greater <br> Major <br> etc. <br>Take 3.5e's "create greater undead" for example:<br>http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Cr<wbr>eate_Greater_Undead</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it is in fact a special skill to be activated. It's like magic but for fighters.</br>  <br>No, cancer mage abuse is 3.0 because Book of Vile Darkness is a 3.0 book.</br>  <br><br><br>This bitch is going to be calling forth mongol hordes by the end of the series isn't she?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh well, it's just that I can't come up with a good translation in my native language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine picking up a Greater Ring of Cunning.<br>Now imagine picking up a Great Ring of Cunning.</br></br>  <br>What's untranslatable? Your language doesn't use comparatives?</br>  <br>I love the faces in the anime. It really conveys how deranged some of the characters are. They're almost Hellsing-tier in how exaggerated they are.<br><br><br>Yeah, I guess it's like chi in kung-fu or something. Given the medieval european aesthetic, I think I would have preferred physical skills to be simply stuff you do with your swords though. <br><br><br> Book of Vile Darkness <br>Ah, that would explain it. Still not a base class, and you'd need to get pretty creative with the rules to make it work: There's no baseline "muscle wizard" class in D&amp;D.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  She gets the title of Warlord Enri the Bloody in Volume 9 apparently. The goblins keep calling her "warlord", and the Nazarick member assigned to defend Carne credits Enri with her kills.  </br>  <br>What is your native language? <br><br>Probably not a good idea to translate it anyway, D&amp;D was originally written in english after all. Everything sound really dumb in Norwegian for example.</br></br></br>  <br>See Tome of Battle for where martial arts draws from<br>http://tcdftp.drshnaps.com/Kojiro/T<wbr>ome%20of%20Battle-OEF.pdf</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yep, it's now clear.<br><br><br>Well, "greater" would literally translate into "superior", and saying "superior item" sound awkward.<br><br><br>French, and D&amp;D is properly translated in it but I just can't find a nice match.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as you remain logically consistent and any references to lesser would be the equivalent of inferior than that could work?</br>  <br>I'm aware that there is precedent for this kind of thing in D&amp;D, but I still think (relatively) low-level warriors who as far as we know don't have any kind of special training aside from just experience as soldiers, use "physical magic" like this. <br><br>Though it's more about how it's presented. If you've learned how to charge someone, you don't "activate your charge ability", you just charge them. It just sounds a bit silly, like if I were to "activate my [open door] ability" every time I'm opening a door.</br></br></br>  My sides are forever lost.<br><br>How can papa bones be so based, holy shit?</br></br>  <br> D&amp;D is properly translated in it <br>Then what is for example the spell "create greater undead" called in french? You could probably look that up.<br><br> saying "superior item" sound awkward <br>I don't think so. It simply means that it's an item of superior quality. (Superior to a common, or baseline item.)</br></br></br></br></br>  Is there any info on how big the world is? Like how many continents and general geography?<br>Or are we riding the back of four elephants here?</br>  <br>The part where he was so disappointed about Hamsuke only for his companions to be the complete opposite always makes me laugh no matter how many times I reread it. It's like he can't comprehend how anyone can be so impressed.</br>  <br>There was a map in volume 9. Let me see if I can find it.</br>  <br>His internal thoughts are fucking hilarious.<br><br>Bit annoyed at the formatting for dialogue though. The first fucking rule is to have a new line per speaker, yet here it's all just cluttered together in the same paragraph. Makes it hard to read.<br><br> "yeah, this is fucking retarded" "oh i totally agree man" "...how can we even read this properly" "who is even speaking now?" "i can't follow this at all..." "is this the same sentence??" <br><br>It doesn't help that the author is fond of ellipses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this pleases me<br><br>Also, if you're interested in an Overlord themed Pathfinder game, add me on skype. We currently have a DM and 3 players. dien.zora</br></br></br>   Papa Bones emerging from the portal <br><br>spooked</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate it sometimes when they just refuse to write proper speaker attribution in the narrative and just shit out lines of dialogue.</br>  <br>Based on the setting, or the actual characters as well? Or just similar in theme perhaps?</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>It's surreal when a character has a randomly generated name you've been using for years but I don't think I'm ever going to live this down the next time I login if this shows up in the anime.</br>  <br>Yeah, but it would have worked out alright if they AT LEAST would make line breaks for each new speaker.<br><br>I suspect it's just the translation though. Perhaps moon runes have different rules.</br></br></br>  <br>Kajit is pretty common though.</br>  <br>That could work, yes, but in the case of the anime, hearing "Create Greater Item" and reading something like "Create: High Quality Item" would somehow break the 3-words flow.<br><br><br>It's translated into "Create Dominant/Dominating Undead".<br>Using "dominant" here make sense but a "dominant item" that's a no-no.<br>At least in French it does sound awkward. We don't use this word like that, the only exception I know is WoW translating "Greater Bounty Spoils" into "Superior Spoil".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently(My first few weeeks were nonstop morrowmind jokes while i wondered wtf was going on) but I did that without realizing they exist so every time I see them talking to Khajit in the book my brain gets paranoid on if everything is going meta.</br>  <br>so when it comes to making an heir he'll cast Create Greater Penis?</br>  Ainz-samaaa  <br> lamprey <br><br>NOPE NOPE NOPE</br></br></br>  <br> Using "dominant" here make sense <br>Eh, I dunno about that. Perhaps it works in french, but in english "dominate" really isn't a good word. The undead isn't "dominating" anything, and being "dominating" is hardly a good way to describe quality, unless it's fucking unreal tournament player.<br><br>Anyway, I suggest you stop translating english into frog, nothing good can come of it. :^)  Seriously though, anything is better in the original language it was created for, from poems and tabletop games to anime and movies. I play VtM with some friends and we speak english and use english terms in-game instead of norwegian. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he'd probably need to cast Create Greater Semen, too.</br>   clementine's face <br><br>I fucking hope they animate that tongue.</br></br>  <br>f-for you</br>  Just finished reading vol 6. Why is she and the unnamed rogue the best characters?  <br> Just finished reading vol 6. <br>oy, volume 6 isn't TLd yet and we would appreciate it if you kept that shit in spoilers.</br></br>   Read volume 4 <br> All that backstory for the lizardmen  <br> Prepared for maximum despair to the nth degree <br> In the end it all works out for everyone and even individually you get a happy ending for almost everyone <br><br>Can't say I don't feel cheated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She really is a cute  chuuni .</br>  <br>Let's discuss what Albedo's "true shape" is.<br>Apparently a lot of people assume it's a gorilla, simply because of Shalltear's insult, but I don't think that necessarily follows. Just because Albedo used an accurate insult (a lamprey) doesn't mean that Shalltear would do the same. Consider that Albedo is a grown woman while Shalltear is just a little loli. From Shalltear's perspective, all adults are kinda like overgrown apes, right?<br><br>Given that Albedo is most certainly a "semen demon"/succubus/imp, I'd actually argue that she doesn't possess a different form at all. She clearly has horns and wings, which can't be disguised. (The excuse used by Ainz to not bring her along to the city.) Her "battle form" is clearly just having armor on, which would be cumbersome if her "final form" was radically different in shape or size.<br><br>Finally, yes Demiurge has shown his ability to turn into a weird frog-bat hybrid, and he's also of the imp race, but that might be just a regular shapeshift ability, not something specific to his race. I very much doubt Albedo will turn into an ugly frog-bat at any rate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope Clementine gets reanimated as a Wight in service of Ainz Ooul Gown. I mean, they have her corpse.</br>  <br>You have to consider it from the viewpoint of how author uses focus/concentration.<br><br>Sure you can swing your sword and do charges and what not, slashes and all that but the 'martiall magic' they use allosws them to boost these actions with focus/concentration.<br><br>Same how Fortress, X-fold Slash of Light, God Slash, Vertical Slash are basic moves in sense but expending their focus/concentration (instead of mana like in the game) allows them to break their limits set to them by tgeir bodies/gear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is her at maximum power</br>  <br>Not that happy.<br>Dozens of lizardmen were killed.<br>Only named lizardmen who survived were Zaryuusu and his albino bitch.</br></br></br>   “Narberal Gamma! Display the power of Nazarick!” <br><br>Holy shit, I have never felt this good while reading something. My imagination hasn't been this active since I was a kid.<br><br>This line sent a fucking chill down my spine.<br><br>I'm fucking glad I picked this up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not a very good succubus if you turn ugly as fuck</br>  <br>She's also going to become potionmaker's grandson's lover after the battle.</br>  <br>Sure, but that's intangible. EVERY action requires a certain amount of concentration, so there's no real qualitative difference to the naked eye. I just don't see how these characters know so much about exactly where the line is drawn between regular moves and "special skills".</br>  those Hellsing faces are really lovely  <br> no boobs <br>FAKE AND GAY</br></br>  <br>I honestly doubt Albedo is a succubutt<br><br>I mean she looks like one and is a slut but that's just from gap moe, her true form is likely a big buff demon considering she's a tank and the guild liked minmaxing the hell out of their npcs</br></br></br>  <br> She will never love you, want to serve you, and be yours for anything you could possibly ask </br>  A little sooner than usual but,<br>Obligatory kinniku pic</br>  So, to level up, is it necessary to kill an enemy or is training the skill enough?  <br>Well exactly, which is why I think she doesn't actually transform. Not all heteromorphic races need to be shapeshifters after all.<br><br>I guess Shalltear's "true vampire" race is what makes her all lamprey-like, while "regular" vampires are non-lampreys.</br></br></br>  <br>Zaryuusu intended from day one to thin out the lizardmen numbers and even the most bleeding heart of them all Lulu was on board with that plan.<br><br>So I can honestly not think of any negative thing done to the lizardmen from their point of view outside of the chiefs dying.<br><br>They united and bonded in a way never before, they are now able to grow as a people incorporating all their various "advancements" and now have the support of the single greatest super power on the planet, they've thinned their numbers, and they are totally down with subjugation as far as I can tell since they like the idea of the strong taking over.<br><br>Yeah a bunch of warriors died but it was a relatively minor thing and even in the final battle with Cocytus the only lizardmen who died were the chiefs and the old guard who wanted a last hurrah anyway.<br><br>Fuck even Ainz said he'd revive the only other two lizardmen of importance if he felt like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the first one to actually say it's hard to follow. The " space " has been enough for myself at least. The original japanese has every single line as paragraph and 1.5cm space between every line. Even if it's just 2-5 words. <br><br>Nobody writes English like that. Though I agree there should be line break between dialogue but it's not hard in the end. Individual differences may vary.<br><br>Are you a speedreader by chance? I used to so that and it would cause me to clear 100-200 pages in hour without problems but as such small details never stuck to memory completely.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Dominant" at least in this context and in french it fits well, the meaning of it wouldn't be "dominating" but "powerful".<br><br> anything is better in the original language it was created for <br>Yeah but I believe that in france, most of our D&amp;D players play in french.<br>Also I don't really like letting some untranslated words here and there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad it's not worthy of the phrase display the power of Nazarick.<br><br>She put on her maid gear and one shot the dragons with relatively boring magic after teleporting around for a little bit.<br><br>I was expecting her to turn into a fucking monster and then nuke them the first time I read it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> her true form is likely a big buff demon considering she's a tank <br>Nigga, do you even inverse ninja theory/plate bikini? Less is more in animu and vidya gaems.</br></br>  <br>Mm, I just imagine the tangibility from how their actions break laws/limits set to them.</br>  <br>No homo, but both Demiurge and Mare are sexy as fuck.</br>  <br>It's never mentioned. It's assumed it's XP based, so however they got xp.</br>  <br>Both are apparently needed in the New world.</br>   Gorilla is constantly being too lewd and yells at everyone <br> Demi fucking lies to Ainz all the time and is a sneaky little shit <br> Chair is a dumb fuck up who has to be killed on her FIRST mission <br> Bug cannot think for himself <br><br>MEANWHILE<br><br> Mare and Aura always get shit done regardless of how hard or how much grunt work they have to do <br> Victim takes one for the team <br> Gargantua threw that rock pretty good that one time <br><br>You people forget who the competent guardians are</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she has atleast 20 levels in racial levels other than imp, thats 10 more than someone like Shalltear with full Lamprey bloodlust mode. Like most Heteromorphic races she most definately has a demon form that is most likely large and ugly (considering Tabula-sans tastes). For now we can only take Shalltears word from it if it really is Gorilla.</br>  <br>She has only 1 level in racials so sadly no transformations for her other than changing her face and humanoid shape.</br>  <br>Dont forget our hero and savior Sebas-san.</br>  Is volume 4 all about those lizardmen? Somehow i don't give a fuck about them and just wanted to read more about main characters. It feels like some kind of side story.  <br>Well, finally. Someone else could see that even though Nazarick made the first move, things ended up way better than the Lizardmen could hope for. Plus Ainz gets his Lizard army, Cocytus gets to learn to think for himself and the Lizardmen are safer than most people in the New World. It was a win-win situation for almost all involved.</br>  <br> Though there was the occasional woman who would brazenly send him a sultry gaze to his face, Sebas paid them no mind.  <br> With an upright back and steady eyes directed straight ahead, his feet did not falter for even a moment. <br><br>Ball'n Sebas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry but thats what LNs are going to.<br>They focus on some 3rd party before they get curb-stomped by Ainz&amp;company.</br></br>  <br>None can stop the dragon swag.</br>  <br>You mean later novels are like that too?</br>  <br> You're the first one to actually say it's hard to follow. <br>I don't doubt it, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been annoying for people.<br><br> I agree there should be line break between dialogue <br>Yes, that is the standard way of doing things. I have no idea why the translators didn't just make a single line break, even for themselves.<br><br> it's not hard in the end <br>It works, but there's exactly ZERO reasons not to have line breaks and it's just annoying when you're trying to following a conversation and suddenly you're unsure who's saying what. This is even worse since, like anon said above, the author very seldom notes speaker attribution. Especially in situations with more than 2 characters present, it makes things confusing.<br><br> Are you a speedreader by chance? <br>Not sure what you mean. Do I read fast? I dunno, it's all relative. The bad formatting certainly slows things down though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's where Victim and Gargantua first show up, Cocytus also does things.<br><br> Shalltear is used as a chair.<br> Just like the boss of an evil organization stroking a cat on his lap, Ainz patted the head of Shalltear who was acting as a chair as he said “It’s not me”. <br/></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Dunno.<br>First chapter of volume 5 is completely focused on some faggot from Kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Her expression does things to my penis who be this semen demon?</br>  <br>None focus almost exclusively on the Lizardmen like volume 4 does. Mostly, it's introduction to this character. We get to see what makes them tick. Their motivation. Then we get to see how and they die.</br>  <br> who be this semen demon <br>Just some random hug pillow.</br></br>  <br>The point is that they have no way of knowing exactly what those limits are. I don't have a problem with them going "oooh momon-san is INHUMANLY strong!", because it's just an expression, but realistically, there's no way for these mooks to know where the line is drawn exactly, hence they can't differentiate between "limit-break" moves and regular moves. It would be more of a sliding scale.</br>   At the same time, he said quietly to Clementine: “I forgot to tell you… I am very stubborn.” <br><br>This fucking guy.</br></br>  <br>Meant for <br><br>Volumes 5 and 6 or so involve Sebas and a certain character. There's also Kingdom, Momon, Ainz, Demiurge, Pleiades and Adventurer action.<br><br>Volume 7 deals with the Empire and Nazarick is invaded.<br><br>Volume 8 focuses on Carne Village and Nfirea and stuff.<br><br>Volume 9 picks up from where volume 7 ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mm so far the author has never used to spoken sentences to be from the same speaker in chain, iirc at least.<br><br>So it's always either one guys spoken lines being paused by narration, internal thought or actual speaker change with "ainz" "demi" or "ainz" narration "ainz".<br><br>And no, raws rarely give you idea who is speaking with: And do Ainz shouted: "Boo!". You just have to read it from context.<br><br>And only few characters have speech quirks in the original language as laid out by dialect or by the use of sentence finishers like ~ssu, arinsu and so on. <br><br>Only Shalltear and Hamsuke and Uncle Cocytus come to mind. And these are even harder to emulate in proper English.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Clementine, she's a hug addict</br>  <br> constantly being too lewd <br>No such thing, anon</br></br>  <br>oh boy, you'll be hyped with all the other swag shit papa bones will do.</br>  <br>How big a hug addict are we talking about?</br>  <br> most Heteromorphic races has a demon form that is most likely large and ugly <br>What do you base this on?</br></br>  <br><br> Spine-crackingly addicted. </br></br>  <br>She would die for some tight hug.</br>  <br>  Papa Bones accepts one of his children's girlfriend. <br>  Criminal organization kidnaps girlfriend. <br>  The might of Nazarick is unleashed. </br></br></br>  <br> author very seldom notes speaker attribution <br>This is really just a problem with translating from Japanese to English.<br><br>For example, Cocyutus in japanese speaks completely in Katakana, Shaltear speaks with a weird dialect I believe was used by courtesans, and so on.<br><br>Translating the character's dialogue into English usually means having to ignore characteristics like dialect, the choice of first person pronoun, and so forth.<br><br>tl;dr in Japanese it's easy to understand who's saying what, blame translations</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the author has never used to spoken sentences to be from the same speaker in chain <br>It's still fucking messy. Do you enjoy a billion quotation marks in a single paragraph? Two quotation marks with nothing but a space in between is awful form.<br><br>I don't even mind speaker attribution that much, but line breaks? Come on, that's pretty fucking basic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> dialect I believe was used by courtesans <br>You mean best girls.</br></br>  <br>so far the discussion has been :<br><br> Players are the Supreme Beings <br> We design our Nazarick <br> Dm plops us in a world we can't meta game <br> ???? <br> Conquest <br><br>Sorry I took forever to respond., I had to leave and do things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hate rreading on my computer <br> want to print the LNs  <br> broke as fuck </br></br>  <br>Yet something that would make such things more easily digestible is  FUCKING LINE BREAKS FOR DIALOGUE, GOD DAMN </br>  How many LNs are translated so far and where can I find them?  <br>Wasn't Overlord translated from Jap to Chinese to English?</br>  <br>Up to book 5<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br>   That feel when no Papa Bones and Uncle Cocytus to take care of you    book 5 only has 54 pages <br>w-what</br>  <br>v1 m8 not yet fully translated.</br>  <br>Thanks, man.</br>   But when do they blow up the moon?

Was it too slow-paced? Did you dislike the characters?<br><br> why didn't you like it? <br> because I didn't enjoy it :B </br></br></br></br>  pls post flying skeleton  <br>It sure is slow paced, but I don't necessarily mind that, I read other detail heavy stuff.<br><br>Maybe my expectations for it was a bit betrayed?<br>Thought I am gonna read something over some evil Overlord taking over the world, crushing heros and stuff.<br>But is actually some fag acting superior, pretending to not give a shit about humans but still saves some and so on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thought I am gonna read something over some evil Overlord taking over the world, crushing heros and stuff. <br>That's your problem, I guess. Ainz isn't some villain going around killing humans indiscriminately. He has a purpose and he's very methodological about it and only really kills people if they get in his way. In that sense, he isn't a purely "evil" character who kills for the lulz.<br><br> But is actually some fag acting superior, pretending to not give a shit about humans but still saves some and so on. <br>But he really doesn't give much of a shit about humans. He only helps them when he can benefit from it in some way. What, you wanted him to kill all humans without reason? Him saving some doesn't mean he's still human mentally. He's not a hero but he's also not an uncontrollable pychopath either,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thought I am gonna read something over some evil Overlord taking over the world, crushing heros and stuff. <br>But he is taking over the world,  one village at a time.  And crushing heroes  RIP Gazef. </br></br>   Ainz extorting poor dumb dryads   <br>For vol 2 that sky was the translator, yes. I think 3 and 4 are back to jp raw</br>  <br>No Johnny Depp pirate just makes vast motions while slurring a lot.<br><br>PA acts like a caricature of a thespian and shit.

Real comfy.</br>  <br>Or, you can use a tablet or phone.</br>  <br>black/white shade display that mimics actual paper, just make sure you get one with backlight. I can't say I have regretted my own purchase of kindle paperwhite (2nd gen). Have read about 50+ books on it in the past year.<br><br>Much better than handling massive ½k-1k page book while laying down or sprawled on couch. Though I still buy printed books too but those are usually rare and for collector purposes.</br></br></br>  <br>Took this awhile back.<br>I basically carry this around everywhere I go now.</br></br>  <br>Stupid laws here make it so that every page of a book must have a fucking stamp for it for copyright reasons(basically to steal money from us) so unless you are friends with someone (and have them illegally print it without even receipt) you will end paying 25 cents for page .</br>   listening to CD drama <br> chapter 8 ends with cliffhanger <br> mfw </br></br>  <br>what  model <br>what  manga </br></br>  <br>It has been a slow wait of, mm 4-6 months already?</br>  <br> Kobo Aura H2o <br> Aria </br></br>  So unless madhouse is fooling around, the secret of Papa Bones is out of the bag, he has no legs.<br><br>Same reason Zaryusu felt uncomfortable looking at him from his position of worship (v4epilogue), his mind was rejecting this fact.</br></br>  <br>So here's just half of a Skelton floating around? My world will never be the same.</br>  <br>He is doing the yoga pose to control his boner.</br>  <br>Lord Ainz upskirt shots?! H-how lewd!</br>  <br>I thought the Theocracy took it?</br>  <br>Wish they kept the bulkier look Albedo had in the LN and mango.</br>  <br>They did. That is why Ainz is scared as hell his plan to pass off as an hero is going to fail.</br>  <br>Same. At least give her the shield back.</br>  <br>Well he has legs but they're not visible, since he moves his legs in Momon's armor. And he got down on one knee for Shalltear during her resurrection. And he was wearing the Widow pants and gold-hemmed boots under the Momon guise at 2nd vol start.<br><br>Thus everyone that sees his "non-existent legs" like in that robe set, feel disturbed and their minds try to reject the fact what they're trying to comprehend the invisible legs.</br></br></br>  <br>"Once again the doors made a sound as they were opened, bringing along the crisp sound made by shoes and the repeated sound of a staff striking the floor. From behind those sounds there was also the sound made by someone walking in high-heels. "<br><br>He makes foot noises</br></br></br>  When's this guy going to stop acting like a faggot and act like the Skull King he looks like?<br><br>Appoint a headwife, and mistress.<br>Bear a heir to the throne<br>Raise your flags<br>Rally your forces<br>Lay waste to the surrounding area in an orgy of blood and conquest.<br>Wait inside your tower for the yuusha to come.<br><br>Holy fuck,it's this limp dick has no ambitions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>Reality bending legs. Or maybe sanity eroding?</br></br></br>  <br>wat, that was albedo right.</br>  <br>Or would it be a feature of his Divine class robe set? ie it hides his waist and legs from view. All kinds of cosmetic things and effects were possible with enough high-grade data crystals.</br>  <br>Did they mention the legs being invisible? I thought they felt disturbed simply because he was sitting on some slut</br>  <br>No, he mention shoes and staff sounds, followed by high-heels sounds. No need to say it twice if it was the case</br>  <br>What is Mare going to do with that toothbrush?</br>  <br>But he does have legs though, we see them when he wears the armor.</br>  <br>His main objectives are finding his friends, protecting Nazarick, and protecting his "children", not world domination. If they weren't his responsibility he'd be out adventuring probably.</br>  <br>Because running a country is tedious as fuck and he's not into "hurrdurr we evil now" nonsense like how you want him to be.</br>  <br>those are basically computers aswell</br>  <br><br> Skull king <br> Employs demons <br> Name of the anime is overlord <br><br>So this anime isn't about a dud finding out he's lvl 100 in a game-that's-real and decides to lay waste in an orgy of blood and conquest?<br><br>THEN WHAT IS THE POINT. FUcking red herrings, making me waste time when I could be rewatching something beter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He gets nothing from ruling a country so he's not going to bother doing it, unless he gets something out of it he's not gonna do it, that's just how he works, that and he's paranoid as fuck.</br>  <br>I understood the meaning but I'm still an idiot so I couldn't help but laugh when I read that.<br><br>Funny, cause we all know Mare is the real cum ranger.</br></br></br>  <br>witness our bloody warlord</br>  <br>He does do evil skellington things, he's just not being stupid about it because he thinks there could be other lvl100 players and transplanted raid bosses that would slap his RP build silly.</br>  <br>She needs some warpaint on that face.</br>  <br> making foot noises without legs <br>Spooky</br></br>  <br>See <br>and<br><br><br>You might as well drop it. I don't think it'll be what you expected.</br></br></br></br></br>  So in the raws, is there any mention of lizardmen after their battle?  <br>Few mentions and so on but not a full-fledged chapter (this is 5-8 mind you).</br>  <br>A head is more than enough</br>    chapter 8 when  <br> She </br>  <br>are the 5000 goblins permanent?</br>  <br>Hopefully not, otherwise food logistics are going to be tough.</br>  <br>Probably.

His skirt fluttering in the wind. A little bit could be seen. No, Momonga totally did not want to see, he was just curious about what was worn underneath. <br><br>It's the small details like these and the Shalltear carpet inspection thought that makes re-reading the volumes so amusing.</br></br>  <br> When did he lie about it? He made a joke thinking Ainz would get it, which both of them thought he did and that was it.</br>  <br> blaming a Succubus for being Lewd <br>that's like complaining that the sky is blue or that water is wet.</br></br>  <br>Blue is a shit-tier color though. And water would be way more enjoyable if i didn't have to dry stuff off all the time.</br>   Ganging up on one skelly. <br>What kind of monsters do this?</br>  <br>Wait, did they just reuse the random scrubs from the opening scene of Episode 1?</br>  <br>Ainz really looked like a normal skelly before and then turned into what we know and love today.</br>  <br>Humans, they need to be put on a leash.</br>  <br> Why are they using the same guys who attacked Nazarick during the anime-original scene at the beginning of Ep 1?<br> Were those niggers really that salty about not killing Ainz that one time?</br></br>  <br>Clearly they were still mad at Touch Me all that time later</br>  <br><br>It might be the same guys.<br>In the time Ainz joined and be came leader of a guild they never bothered to upgrade their equipment.</br></br></br>  <br> Well, they were stupid enough to attack the most difficult dungeon in the game with just FIVE faggots, so it wouldn't be weird for them to do that too.</br>  <br>he Started as a Skeleton mage and ranked up a couple of times until he became the Overlord he is today</br>  Where would you choose to live in the New World, if you had a choice?<br>The Kingdom, the Empire or the Slane Theocracy.</br>  <br> Theocracy since they are actually competent and have all the cool shit.</br>  <br>LN bounces a lot around time. It's possible they were trying to do the same thing here, but just didn't indicate it at all, so the viewer gets the impression that the opening scene happens before the rest of the show.</br>  <br>Don't you have to a member of their cult that worships the Six Gods or something.

But they're more like guild bases that can be invaded. Although I suppose the two are interchangeable.</br>  <br>Yea, apparent your guild base is more or less can be up graded and outfitted to be dungeon when other guilds try to raid.</br>  <br>we'll never get a game like this. I would kill the directors of K-On for a game like this.</br>  <br> Guilds could buy a HQ and customize it.<br> Other guilds or groups of players could attack it and steal your shit, so customizing it to protect it from that was a good idea.<br> And then Ainz Oaal Gown took it to another level by using all their game and IRL money to make a legit dungeon, and one who was never cleared till the end.</br></br></br>  Food for thought  <br>The sparkles are a nice touch.</br>    <br>Where's Aura on there<br><br>She's the only one who isn't fucking retarded</br></br></br>  <br> Aura <br>Sorry, only woman can be best girls</br></br>  <br>In this case the guild HQ was originally a normal dungeon, but then the AOG took it over and expanded it.<br><br>You get a total of 700 experience levels with which to make NPC guardians (for example, 7 100-level NPCs), but if your guild item gets destroyed (the staff in this case) the guild is destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br> Blue is a shit-tier color though. <br>Butthurt redfag detected.</br></br>  <br>Gotta be clear the 700 levels were for the base aka last floor guardians are all independent of it.</br>  Shalltear is mine.  <br>So the maids are all level 100 as well, then?</br>  <br>nah, they're like 30-60ish. <br><br>Sebas is 100 though.</br></br></br>  <br>*brushiebrushiebrushie*</br>  <br>Nah but there are like 20 of them<br><br>Sebas and albedo for 200 of the levels<br>6 maids ranged 40-60 then a ton of low level guys like penguin and mushroom barkeep</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Pandora's Actor? Does he count?</br>  <br>  tfw Ainz Ooal Gown was his way of getting revenge on the assholes that harassed him when he started playing for being a skeleton. </br>   Read the novel <br> The translation is absolute, utter trash, quite possibly run through google translate <br><br>Jesus tapdancing Christ who is this Skythewood and why is their awful fucking translation the one spread far and wide? You can't even get past the first sentence of the description without running into a goddamn error.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was touch me who started the guild.</br>  <br>Dead eyes.</br>  <br>the two started it together</br>  <br>Feel free to improve it.</br>  <br>there were 9 originals that started the guild.</br>  <br>The Nine started it.</br>  <br>Out of all the treasures and weapons of Nazarick, you choose a chair to take?</br>  <br> Thinking Sky was the original or even the sole translator for it. </br>  <br>Maybe because he's the only one actually translating it?<br><br>Personally, I'm capable of forgiving editing errors. This novel seems really poorly written to begin with. I hope you aren't mistaking problems with the original writing with problems caused by translation? Because the translation isn't bad by any stretch for a rushed early draft.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah when they replace him with her sometimes I really just want to kill myself because my autistic head cannot wrap around what is clearly trying to be said.<br><br>Guess you should learn moonspeak</br></br></br>  <br>You know how some people translate stuff to learn japanese<br><br>Sky is some Chinese guy translating to get better at english. Quality jumps in volume 2 though</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The way that Ainz tells it, it looks like Ainz and Touch Me were together for a while (maybe a day, maybe a week), before starting gathering other players. <br><br>And once they weren't just a few 'friends' playing together, they created a guild.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how powerful are the lizardmen compared to the human characters shown so far?<br><br>Because I actually found the stat cards for them and I'm trying to figure out how strong people like Brain are in comparison.</br></br>  <br> Is it Tuesday yet? <br><br>The weight, is killing me softly.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why it wasn't Original Two, Three? Instead of Nine.</br>  <br>No. But Saturday is tomorrow.</br>  <br>Gazef and brain are stronger I think</br>  <br>no other furniture has a built in ona hole.</br>  <br>Because they were nine guys who created the guild. Once they were in a guild, they starting accepting more members, thanks to them appearing in a different leaderboard (guilds), and not some random players. <br><br>They could have met Tabula, Ulbert and the others started to stick with them. <br><br>My guess is that Touch Me liked to help people and Ainz was the first or one of the first to stick together with him after he saved him (Ainz only refers to Touch Me when talking about how he was saved from human players). As they traveled through the game, more non-human players stick to them, and once they were a big enough group that they thought that having a 'formal' guild would be the best for the team,</br></br></br></br></br>  full op when?  <br>Average Lizardmen warrior is stronger (they can beat strong low-tier skellies), but their heroes are weaker than human heroes. <br><br>Gazef is lvl ~30, while the strongest lizardman is lvl 20. Also, Gazef is not the only Adamantium level fighter of the human world.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's see.<br><br>It is said that Gazef could beat Clementine with his full armor on, who was said to be superior to Narberal in fighting. However, Clementine with her actual gear (before it was taken back by Black Scripture) is superior to Gazef and thus I believe Gazef = Narberal approximately. This places Gazef at around the 50-ish level.<br><br>Brain is weaker than Gazef, but ambigiously so. He is obviously a decent match for him but would lose in any situation, even without armor on. Because he could defeat Shalltear's vampire brides and because Shalltear was more impressed with the leader of the Black Scripture, who could defeat Solution Epsilon (level 50), than Brain, he is probably between level 30 and 40, if not lower.<br><br>The lizards, by comparison, are level 20 maximum. In other words, I have reason to believe that Brain could probably take on the elite team by himself if he tried.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Actually, I thought there was a quote comparing Clementine to the battle maids, but I can't seem to find it...but there is no way Gazef or Brain are inferior to Hamsuke, who is level 30. Gazef should at least be a match for the battle maids.</br>  <br> mistakes Mare for Aura <br>Leave it to narbfags to be this fucking retarded.</br></br>  Was expecting a more fantastic kind of mask, but I guess a CGI Death Knight is okay  <br>I desperete wanna know wat kind of underwer he wears under that sirt.<br><br>Also, wat kind of underwear her ister and albedo wear.</br></br></br>  <br> Touch Me </br>  <br>Yeah, more and more I'm reminded that despite it's problems, the manga has better designs overall.</br>  <br> implying he's wearing underwear. </br>  <br> Implying I was trying to put reverse-traps in my post <br>Dream on anon.</br></br>  <br>so touch me was already world champion when he saved momonga?</br>  <br> Gargantua threw that rock pretty good that one time <br>Not going to lie, it was a good rock throw.</br></br>  <br>Why do people cream themselves over Touch Me? He seems like a bro, sure, but not very interesting as a character.<br> lol moralfag <br>Well, he might be interesting if he somehow came to confront Ainz and what he was doing. But retrospectively, he just seems like a bog-standard paladin.</br></br></br>  <br>are we sure that was him? I don't remember them calling him by name.</br>  <br>Nope, he earned it later on considering they formed a guild before leveling up.</br>  <br><br>Best family one could ask for.</br></br>  <br>they show him with the white armor when saving momonga</br>  <br>The biggest question remains though: What exactly do narbfags see in her? I mean, she's pretty lackluster in nearly all departments.<br><br>I remember reading about how you guys said she "would be everyone's waifu after a few episodes", dropping smugloli and tittymonster but now that I've read the LNs, I can't see it honestly. She's pretty retarded most of the time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>see<br>possible I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, but thinking on it, we never actually find out what the world champion armor looks like. The stuff we see Touch Me always wearing could really just be his normal armor.</br>  <br>She outclasses all of the girls in sheer amount of screentime which I assume is a big factor.</br>  <br><br>vol 3, chap 5<br> The World Champion was a special class granted only to the victor of the official martial tournament. As for the prize, the champion was given one piece of special equipment from the administrator. <br><br> Touch Me had chosen that white armor as his prize. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I remember...you guys said she "would be everyone's waifu" <br>If by "you guys," you meant me, then yes.<br> She's pretty retarded most of the time <br>Her smugness, her cold nature towards humans and just how quickly that turns into being overwhelmed when confronted by her superiors are the best parts of her.<br><br>Oh, and she's easy to bully.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You never see bog standard paladins anymore. It's always Edgy McEdgerson, Supertwink, or douchebag#5.</br>  <br>I'm 99.99% sure it's him.<br><br> Vol 3 epilogue Ainz says it's a rare chance for all the guardians to gather and he's the only nigga that's 30 meters tall. </br></br></br>  <br>Thanks to you I can't imagine Gargantua as anything but a giant Killer Croc from Batman until i actually read about it in a novel or see a picture.</br>  <br>Quality over quantity for me. And it's unlikely to keep up for the entirety of the story.<br><br><br>Alright, guess you have a thing for retards. Nothing wrong with that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He tells Albedo to get Gargantua going right before they leave and it's never brought up again so it has to be him.</br>  <br><br>hmm, fair enough.</br></br>  <br>There's a reason for that. It's played out with Kenshiro and Kamen Rider, where it's just them vs. the big evil guys. In stories where the MC is more ambiguous, it tends to go awry. Just look at how annoying Suzaku was in Geass.</br>  Maids  <br>Whose maids are these? They're cute.</br>  <br>I also like that his description is literally just a Dragon Quest golem to the point where the lizardmen observing could almost call him cute if he didn't throw a giant fucking boulder over their last line of defense.<br><br>Really the entire proper Ainz entrance in volume 4 is hands down my favorite thing in the entire series.<br><br> Lizardmen celebrating their hard earned victory over a very real threat to them  <br> Watch as hundreds of skeletons armed with magic gear that probably surpasses their FOUR sacred treasures line up <br> Ainz freezes the entire fucking lake so he doesn't have to walk in muddy marshland <br> Gargantua appears out of nowhere and throws a boulder big enough to crush all of them right then and there <br> Just to be used as a fucking platform to sit comfy  <br> The seemingly godlike skeletons that could have probably used 1/100 of their total skelly forces to crush all of them turn into fuck stairs <br> Ainz and guardians acting like the most OG fucking endgame baddies ever <br> That ultimatum <br> That Cocytus true warrior battle <br><br>God I love volume 4 so much</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence his need to tuck the skirt lower all the time. I bet he is hung like a horse for real.</br>  <br>I'm not sure I can really see Suzaku as a Paladin and it's not like my previous examples aren't overplayed as fuck too.</br>  <br>City of Heroes/Villains had something like it.</br>  <br> I bet he is hung like a horse for real. <br> tfw every time I think of him I remember my favorite shota artist.  <br><br><br>not nearly as in depth though. I miss that game.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm glad Cocytu and Demiruge are rather level headed.<br>Shaltear and Albedo seem to have a tendency of going 0 to 100 really fucking quick.</br></br>  <br>They're the non-Pleiades maids of Nazarick, homunculus maids and their leader is the Head Maid Pestonya, High Priest with the stitched towgether/split dog head.<br><br>Sebas is the head butler and his servants are most likely homunculus too and they wear the silly masks and don't seem to speak ever. Apart from Mr. Toilet Cleaner who is joke assistant to Sebas.</br></br></br>  <br>Homunculus maids of Nazarick</br>  <br>I think that part was a lot of people's favorite scenes in volume 4. we're all probably going to shit ourselves in glee if and when volume 9's ever translated.</br>  <br>You get really touching moments with Albedo but she's used way too much as comic relief or to just be there to yell at everyone that she loses her appeal when all the guardians get together.<br><br>Demiurge is usually calm and collected so when he legit got fucking pissed at Ainz going to fight chair alone it shows how much he really cares as opposed to Albedo who usually just screams.</br></br></br>  <br>So there's the Pleiades Six Stars and the Pleiades Seven Sisters with different leaders, right?</br>  <br>To be fair, a lot of people would drop their spaghetti too if they were suddenly forced to accompany their god 24/7, address him like a commoner, and watch people not show the proper respect you'd expect for a guy who can presumably conquer the world single handedly.</br>  <br> he wouldn't want a spaghetti dropping shapeshifting qt3.14 who is easily bullied as a bride <br>I don't know where to start anon</br></br>  <br>The only difference is that seven stars/sisters includes Lastborn but we don't see what the fuck she does so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Worse, Ainz picked her because he mistakenly thought only Albedo detested humans. It seems like 90% of Nazarick NPCs hate them.</br>  <br>that sounds fun and all <br>i have never played an rpg like that with a dm and all though i have been meaning to try it</br></br>  <br>No, Pleiades Six Star and Seven Star are merely formations. Seventh member is under lockdown and can't be moved by anyone else than Ainz.<br><br>And said Lastborn is the actual captain of the squad, Yuri-nee being vice-captain in her absence and they're lead by Sebas as commander? iirc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Got it. Thanks, kind anons.</br></br>  <br>Sure, but if your fucking god tells you to do something, that should override any other thing you assumed beforehand. If he tells you to throw shit at him and call him names, then you don't question it, you just DO IT.<br><br><br>Not into bullying<br> Rather into being bullied :3c </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She does bullying too, anon. She's very well-rounded.</br>  <br>So who doesn't hate humans in Nazarick? I know Sebas doesn't, but who else?</br>  <br>yuri alpha</br>  <br>Yeah, but she's weak as fuck, is kinda stupid and doesn't laugh maniacally like a super villain. She's also not yandere.<br><br>Albedo is clearly the superior bullyfu.</br></br></br>  <br> level 2 commander and general already unlocks the full potential of a shit tier item, which goes from 19 goblins to 5000 goblins <br><br>So what happens when a level 15 commander/general uses a level 100 summon item? Does he get 10 world eaters or something?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure Albedo would be better bullied.</br>  <br>Hate? Well, let's see:<br>Sebas (obv.)<br>Pandora's Actor is nearly neutral so he doesn't care<br>Same goes for Aura and Mare<br>Yuri Alpha is fine with them, I will assume Lastborn is as well (she's human)<br>Entoma eats them, but she doesn't care otherwise<br>Shizu also doesn't care<br>Cocytus doesn't care but respects warrior humans (e.g. Gazef, Brain)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Solution doesn't hate humans.

There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn’t he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.<br><br>I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a like girl as you once again type your little Banana thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don’t even fill in the captcha. Maybe you’re such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The “epic” Banana guy, isn’t it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your Doritos on the floor, but it’s ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that’s right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she’s probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about a fucking banana. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic Bananafag NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can’t even try to talk with you because all you say is “I REALLY REALLY LIKE THIS PICTURE.” You’ve become a parody of your own self. And that’s all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he’s done a million times now. And that’s all you’ll ever be.</br></br>  I know that peel...  <br>John, haha.

I have been waiting for that Benkei route for years.</br>  So I read every route in the game and what was this all about? It was brought up in the prologue and Miyako route, but is there some bad end where something like this happens?  <br>Wasn't it about Miyako an-heroing after Yamato "left her" but it was averted because Chris slapped her and told her to get her shit straight.</br>  <br>cough did anyone say lupus?</br>  <br>Will we ever have Mayucchi's voice actress back?<br>Yūko Gotō come back! Matsukaze just isn't the same without you.</br></br>  <br> Majikoi A-1 - continuing from Wairu's TL, 48/83 scripts (57.83%) translated, 43/83 scripts (51.8%) edited <br><br>Just give it some time. It wil happen</br></br></br>  <br>IT'S NOT LU-fuck it</br>  When will we have the meido route? I need more Azumi and Lee  <br>Wairu? Didn't they die?</br>  <br>They died.<br><br>This is another group, that continues from what Wairu already had translated</br></br></br>  <br>Oh that's cool.</br>  What the hell, did the minatosoft site revert the update? What happened to the yoshitsune background and takae pic?  <br>Did they get permission from Wairu?</br>  MAJIKOI S 100% TRANSLATED <br>http://forums.fuwanovel.net/topic/9<wbr>203-majikoi-s-translation-project/</wbr></br>  <br>Am i the only one who thought that her route was pretty lackluster compared to the other heroine routes? I felt the sex scenes were just a reward for the player and didn't fit well into the story. <br><br>That being said, her character is still pretty awesome.</br></br></br>  <br>HOLY FUCK IT'S REAL</br>  Damn, this shit was boring. I can't believe how many reviews I found of this VN that were 9/10 or higher.  <br>https://majitranslations.wordpress.<wbr>com/2015/07/17/maji-de-watashi-ni-k<wbr>oi-shinasai-s-english-patch-release<wbr>d/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  I haven't touched Majikoi for a couple of years. Did Miyako's route ever get translated?  <br>I fucking finished the first game today, damn i love my life</br>  <br>thats why they are in the afterstory you retarded nigger.</br>  <br>I'm not falling for that, bro.</br>  <br>its real im playing right now</br>  <br>It's legit anon.</br>  <br>The TL was completed about a week ago. The editing was finished yesterday. We released it as soon as we felt comfortable doing so, and as soon as things were ready.</br>  <br><br> It will be weird to play Miyako's after route before her main route. </br></br>  <br>Why don't you just play her main route first?</br>  I didn't need sleep anyway.  <br><br>Well, shit. Looks like I won't be resuming Fate Hollow for a while.</br></br>  <br>Last I knew it was stuck at 89%. Did someone finish the translation?</br>  Can I skip the Miyako route? This shit is terrible.  <br>Yes, we did, http://forums.fuwanovel.net/topic/6<wbr>556-majikoi-translation-project/?p=<wbr>165700<br><br>quite a while ago, in fact</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  Thank you based Majikoi S TLs.<br><br><br>Fuwanovel picked it up.

Goddamit, it's time  <br>we do not have a pre-patched game torrent, but here's the S torrent on sukebei http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;t<wbr>id=99579<br>then just use the installer and all that shite</br></wbr></br>  <br>Check the comments on the release blog post. There is a link there.</br>  <br>Absolutely based. Thanks a lot.</br>  <br><br>Awesome, now to play Kokoro route because I found her adorable in Yukie's route.</br></br>  <br>Don't pee yourself with enjoyment.</br>  Hark! the urine flows!  I want more margit+chris. Does this have it  <br>Im crying. I found out Majikoi was fully translated 4 days ago and have stayed up all night replaying every route and am finally about to start Agave route. Now this is happens and I just dont know how to feel. There will be no sleep tonight.<br><br>Also how is Yuko Goto? She voiced Mikuru again in Nagato-chan but you could tell a lot of lines were cut out. Is she getting any better?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, no.</br>  <br><br>Well shit. I had given up hope. It's been a while since I had last checked a Majikoi thread.<br><br> Thanks. </br></br></br></br>  <br>ow well, guess Ill save myself a lot of time</br>  <br>I heard she's recovered, but it's Lupus so you never really fully recover. I have a cousin with it and you'd be amazed though how well you can live with it being treated.</br>  Yuu Asakawa is love.  <br>You're in luck m8. It's all done</br>  Anyone remember getting an error like this with the original Tsubame route patch? I'm replaying her route with the new complete patch and I'm getting this error every time on this part.  <br>I got the same thing with the Chris After route.</br>  Tsuyokiss TL when?  <br><br>it appears to be somethin' in update2.pac, will look into it immediately</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  Can confirm it is somethin' with update2, we'll start tryin' to figure out exactly what in there decided to fuck with us and fix it asap  <br>Roger, will go get food in the mean time.

Thanks a bunch.</br>  So the game keeps asking for a product ID, but, me being the scum shit I am, have torrented the game.  Her in a ponytail, made me diamonds  <br>Bless you</br>  <br>did you find use a crack? if not I'll upload one</br>  what anime adaption is it, and which studio?<br>For me, Toriko gets an anime by Gainax.</br>  Guts - Madhouse<br>Bleach - don't care</br>  <br>Shaman King blows Hiatus X Hiatus out of the fucking water retard.</br>  <br>Why should Bleach get a remake? The anime already did everything worthwhile, and it had a fantastic OST. Apart from that, they didn't fuck up the pacing by doing filler arcs instead of padding through canon arcs like other long running anime do.</br>  <br> Opinions. <br>Shit opinions*<br>You're this guy?  <br>Well that explains it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, that's why it never got a proper ending right?</br>  I'm an older brother, I know people hate me for what I do, but it's all for others benefits.  <br>yfw kaiki is the only true sentimental idealist in the show.</br>  Did you remember to suck your dialy cock OP?  Nihilistic wicked sense of humor and all that stuff.  Snail - an adorable undead loli with an insatiable craving for cocks. I'll take whatever I can get - cut, uncut, shitskins, you name it.
