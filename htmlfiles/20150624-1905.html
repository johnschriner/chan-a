[  Dragonball creator Akira Toriyama stated that Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is weaker than a Super Saiyan God. It seems that a Super saiyan God Super Saiyan is just a super saiyan that absorbed some of the god power, sort of like what Goku did in Battle of gods when he couldn't handle the transformation.   WTF http://kotaku.com/its-official-goku<wbr>-has-blue-hair-in-dragon-ball-z-169<wbr>6943056</wbr></wbr>     Why is Toriyama so stupid? Why are Toriyama's fans so stupid?   The only thing keeping this shit alive is the nostalgia.    Interesting. I like the idea but if SSJGSSJ isn't a SSJG power up why is SSJG part of the title?  Toriyama is just a goofball with a fondness for puns and poop jokes. Expecting DB to make any sort of sense ever is a mistake.    I can't wait for english dub plebs to disown Super because it's not the bowdlerized HARDCORE DRAGON BAWL ZEE from muh childhood      Does Toriyama even know what he's doing anymore, I think he's senile.    ...kikoho    No idea, I guess it's because it's absorbed the god power.   Who gives a shit?   kotaku     I cant wait for SUPER SAIYAN GOD 3 SUPER SAIYAN 3    because his fans are suppose to be 10 year olds who scream a lot and you know....can not understand complex stuff.    Like... Super Saiyan God sounds like a "thing", like there are things out there that are them that aren't Goku... but SS God SS is a mode you can power up to, which is reminiscent of those beings. Just judging from how the sentence is phrased...  Ok, so in DBS there will be a new transformation called Super Saiyan Super Saiyan God that is actually a Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan God and not just a Super Saiyan using the borrowed power of a Super Saiyan God, because every new arc needs that shit.   And video games.  Actually, if you think about it, every industry seems to be on nostalgia mode nowadays.  Anime  More DBZ, Sailor Moon Crystal, Parasyte, Digimon Tri, etc  Video Games  Doom 4, Carmageddon, Final Fantasy 7, etc  Movies  Jurasic World, Ghostbusters, a shit ton of remakes (Poltergeist, for example)             only watch dragon ball because stupid   can't understand the complex waifu drama of other anime     Makes sense, I mean, he need the seven chaos- I mean seven other saiyans to lend him aid to transform the first time, If he wants the red state again he'll have to do that again, This is just what's left over from that. Toya should of named it Super Sayian Pseudo God but I guess that doesn't sound cool enough.  Is all this confusing bullshit necessary.  What was even the point of SS3 now that I think about it.      Seven chaos- I mean seven other saiyans  Kek      Final Fantasy 7  The only thing I think about this is that square is really desperate for FF bux since 15 is never going to happen.      the point of SSJ3  It was the next step up from SSJ2 and he fought Majin Boo in that form. So yes, 20 years later and there's some new stuff happening, doesn't discredit SSJ3 being the be-all end-all back in 1995.    Why is this shit even happening. Why can't you just let the dead sleep? It all should have ended with Buu Saga and fine, let GT exist too.  Other then the naming this actually makes some sense, but god damn the naming scheme is terrible.  So basically the original transformation to SSG is more or less equal to Bills, but because he ascended to God hood, Goku dramatically increased the power of his base stats to the point where he could still fight on Bills level. Blue Berry Goku is a attempt to gain back some of that god power since Goku would need to do the ritual again to achieve SSG.   Calling God form SSG is biting them on the ass hard, its just going to cause confusion.      Goku just needs to lose his God powers in some weird ass way and all gods of destruction die, so that Akira can end dragonball super early and GT can remain   This     Bills  stahp   Because money. And more DB is always welcome, especially if Toriyama is behind it and not whatever derpers at Toei wrote GT.        Yeah, and Toriyama also said that Goku realized that SS2 and 3 is just an inefficient way to draw his power, and he's not transforming in those forms ever again.     Beerus is a terrible name and you should feel bad about it.    The only way that DBS won't be a retarded &gt;defend the earth from x y and z again Is if the Z fighters leave and go to other universes with stronger enemies    Tell that to the guys who named him. Bills is a pisspoor pseudo-romanization that doesn't retain the pun.    clickbait  not today shill    Welp     kotaku   I ain't clicking that shit, learn to pastebin nigga.      Not the same anon but...  I've been offline for weeks, don't tell me that Square-Enix finally pressed the FFVII remake button?      Nothing   bait  About it      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kzn<wbr>ek1uNVsg</wbr>  [ ]    SSJG looks better than SSJGSSJ I'm glad it's more powerful    so basically, SSGSS was taping in to the god power, where as SSG is stronger with the full power of SSG. So what if he went super sayain with the god powers on?     I guess the blue hair is how it would look, Goku isn't able to fully tap into his God powers so the SSGSS allows him to tap into some of it. So its currently not as strong as SSG form but has the potential to get stronger.    This was an obvious thing to me since i knew about the transformation.   SSG is a transformation on it´s own. So it can´t turn into SS while on it, kind of like "Mystic Gohan".     Bills confirmed for stronger than Golden Frieza   Wow, what the fuck.  I can imagine that E3 and internet reactions.       Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan   fuck this shit, im just calling him blue hair goku     "The form exceedingly surpasses its predecessor, Super Saiyan God, and all of the other Saiyan forms." From the Wikia    Goku was able to keep fighting beerus in his normal state while only losing a small amount of his total God power.   Somehow SSGSS is still weaker than SSG, despite the fact that his base form is now close in power to his God Form.    SASUGATORIII      So basically he's admitting the transformation is fucking pointless, just an excuse to hype up F.   B R A V O R T O R I A O V R O I         https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WY1<wbr>p8ZgvqYM</wbr>  [ ]   Alzheimer's is a serious illness   How about Super Cyan Goku?    It's funny because Square Enix isn't even doing that badly.    genius    Way to make the term sounds confusing.    is this guy human?     Man, this was a pretty great E3. Yeah, some conferences were bad, but it was overall much, much better than any E3 since 2010.    By the end of the new TV show only the biggest nerds on the internet will understand how SSJ transformations work. I swear he's trying to make them as complex and arbitrary as possible.    kotaku  reported     Super Saiyan God is indeed the temporary powerup Goku went into during Battle of the Gods. But you have to be pure hearted, meaning no saiyans were able to achieve this form for like a trillion years. Also it doesn't last very long so after it ran out I think those saiyans bit it.    Fair enough. He doesn't use Kaioken anymore anyway. There's not really a point in using techniques that you've got better versions of.    It's not really that complex.   Super saiyan: Pure Hearted Saiyan Powerup   Super Saiyan God: 6 Pure Hearted Saiyans Powerup   SSGSSJ: Pure hearted Saiyan powering up in a way to imitate SSG without the 5 other Saiyans.         It doesn't matter if they're inefficient since they're massive power multipliers. Just like the Kaioken, if your enemy is much stronger than you, efficiency stops being a priority.       So basically he's admitting the transformation is fucking pointless   Why is this so surprising to people when the main complaint from both Beerus AND Whis is that Goku and Vegeta could have easily handled Golden Fridge, if they worked together?  In general, since Battle of Gods, I don't recall Beerus even stating anything about neither Vegeta nor Goku being a decent opponent and he was shown to give zero fucks about even the fact that Whis was wasting time training them, let alone Freeza showing up.  The only thing I have an issue with is the naming scheme. SSJGSSJ sounds fucking retarded, here's hoping Chichi, Bulma, Videl or a secondary female character chimes in later and has Goku or Vegeta change it.  The whole SSJG ritual is going to be a thing, since the central theme in RoF is that despite Goku's and Vegeta's impressive power, they're both fuck ups (Goku letting his guard down and Vegeta hesitating), which basically confirms that Vegeta was never arsed to do said ritual and just used Goku's SSJGSSJ power as a baseline and trained towards that, probably using the "Muh Bulma" incident as a mental reference to catch up.  While the return of the Cherry-flavor Saiyan God seems corny, especially when an official SSJGSSJ Gogeta seemed like a natural compromise, having everything harken back to the Super Saiyan God ritual works as a roundabout way for Toriyama to give Gohan, Gotenks and Vegeta new power ups for DBS, with the finale being SSJG Gogeta.                Let's see if I get this right: when Goku went SSJ in BoG against Beerus, he was still weaker than SSJ God? Does that mean that Super Cyan Goku is probably as strong as when he went SSJ against Beerus, just with the added blue hair because "muh new colored transformation"?     Pure hearted    No one bought that shit for the base Super Saiyan, no one's buying that shit this time.     I'm questioning if this will even be better than GT.    While the return of the Cherry-flavor Saiyan God seems corny, especially when an official SSJGSSJ Gogeta seemed like a natural compromise, having everything harken back to the Super Saiyan God ritual works as a roundabout way for Toriyama to give Gohan, Gotenks and Vegeta new power ups for DBS, with the finale being SSJG Gogeta.   Well, the only way Gotenks, and Gogeta would work is if Bulma gets knocked up with Bra during/before the RoF bits of Dragon Ball Super.  Seems like the most obvious conclusion, but it also helps that Toriyama could just bring Tarble back for the extra Saiyan, if he doesn't go that route.       Let me guess, only SSJGSSJ3 will be equal do the original SSJ God. And even then Goku will still be weaker than Beer and Whisky so they can keep milking the series with Dragon Ball Super Ultra.    When Goku went against Beerus, and lost his god form, Beerus commented he kept most of his power. Meaning goku's BASE form is strong enough to fight with Beerus for a bit.   Meaning that if the Super Cyan is not way stronger than beerus it is the weakest transformation the series has seen. Sounds like the Super Cyan is basically Base Goku x 1.01        I'm questioning if this will even be better than GT.   By the virtue of NOT having the space-travel horseshit it's better than GT already. The only way they can fuck it up is by skimping out on showing the other universes.      Super Cyan has to at least double his power, otherwise it's just for show.      &gt;Seems like the most obvious conclusion, but it also helps that Toriyama could just bring Tarble back for the extra Saiyan, if he doesn't go that route.   Well, seeing as multi-universe shenanigans is going to be the main thing about DBS, I'd like to believe Toriyama is going to use this as a means to have a universe where Raditz, Bardock, Gine, Nappa or even King Vegeta don't get killed, just to have different characters join in on the Super Saiyan God ritual.  Hell, he could take it even further and have Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Goten, Trunks, Tarble, etc. from different universes help out when they need to do the ritual, but the only thing with that is it'll make the series an even better Saiyan wankfest than it already has become.         I see it less like him keeping the power and his body retaining and getting used to moving like a super saiyan God. He's keeping pace with Beerus and able to land some blows but doesn't have the raw unadulterated strength he did as a god.   Every Vegito from every multiverse combined power to make SSG Vegito when?   Sure, why the fuck not? I don't think anyone even cares at this point with all this lay bullshit.    Probably to make certain or easier to digest in power level class that SSJ 4 is the strongest form until now .

Yeah, but there was barely even a kiss shown in KnK, so I feel like that's understandable.    Were the lines from Genshiken actually like that? I don't remember it being so blunt.    I can't even figure out what anime it is because all the images were deleted.

Its 2spooky4me    illustrations showing dark and horrifying setting   actual series is just as metal   wonder if Madhouse will put this series off.      Hopefully some tidbits make their way to West from the next weekend's pre-screening event. Though I doubt we will get another PV since it airs on 7th for real, iirc.   Where were you when Demiurge discovered that Albedo had steel abs?  Well, it'll be a fresh breath of air after all the cutesy trash they air now a days.   I'd rather see her tail or Papa Bones' legs.   I read the web novel and dropped it a few chapters in. It's another self insert RPG manga where the MC gets literally everything handed to him because he's the MC. Pretty fucking bad.  Manga chapter 7 when?   But this series still has lots of pandering and wish fullfilment. Its just presented in a different, more digestible wraping. Doesnt mean it doenst have pandering and wish fullfilment like every other LN under the moon.      Overrated anime of the season alongside Gangsta.  I'll be watching Skeletor's battles but besides that I don't give a shit.     Anime character design problems:  Ainz's spaulders. Albedo doesn't have enough frills. Shalltear's lopsided dress. Aura's lack of whip. Mare's lack of silver necklace. Demiurge's boney face. Cocytus's icebergs. Sebastian's chest and hands.            Gangsta is overrated?  Always seemed like a pretty niche thing only 5 people on /a/ were interested in, me included. Same deal here, only theres a bigger handful of people.      If anything, God Eater will be overrated since the normies are all fangasming over 'MUH UFOTABLE'    Gangsta is pretty hyped outside of /a/. Expect it to be popular.  Also, why is are Overlord sprites never updated on time? Literally takes 2-3 days after reaching 200 new followers or 50 retweets.      Weird, I would expect it to not be popular with all the prostitution and drugs themes in it, but I guess those things atract quite the audience.  People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon. Wonder how censored it will be. And I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.        normies  Normalfags, they are called normalfags Jesus Christ.     If anything, I know /a/ will hate it because of the fujoshit boogieman and the fact that the main girl is a literal prostitute.     People must be expecting it to be like Cowboy Beboop or Black Lagoon.  People is stupid, no big surprise here.   I wonder how many "this is outrageous" and "think of the children" scandals it will bring.  Why would you care what this "people" think.        fujoshit boogieman? You talking about the supersoldier lesbian couple? Cause if anything that will cause a bigger /v/tard-tier uproar, along with katana brainwashed twin sister.  If anything the main girl being a literal prostitute would be refreshing for /a/, but it could go either way since she has a "oh what a useless female" moments in the begining. I rather quite like her character and seeig her develop.   Inevitably whatever this "people" do will get reported here so I do care. I further care because like it or not we are part of this "people".          From what I've seen, the two new shows being hyped are Gangsta and God Eater.  Gangsta is drawing attention precisely because of violence and drugs. God Eater because of Ufotable.  Going by Twitter, they're leading in follows with Gangsta at 13.5K and God Eater at 24.6K.         God Eater is the usual post apocalyptic teens with weapons anime. ANY show with those things are bound to be popular. Post apocalyptic anything is popular even harems.   I'm sure they're expecting it to be Black Lagoon. You also underestimate how edgy normals can be about their anime. I always thought /a/ would be the cesspool of internet anime. Oh no, there's much worse going on out there.       I predict Gangsta will get a psycho-pass-like following, at least at the begining. If they manage to not fuck up the anime it could even become the new Black Lagoon for some people. Though tbh Im still scratching my head at how they are gonna pace things since it doesnt feel like the first arc is even done yet in the manga. Probly anime original ending since theres not enough material for a season 2 or a story arc for a season 1.      WHEN I SAY GANGSTA YOU SAY NIGGA  GANGSTA       Stop.     MC didnt choose to play a lesbian succubus   so much wasted potential      And it's bit sad only some of those can be attributed to the need to simplify so-bin's art so it's actually doable for animators/budget.    /a/ is one of the few places on the english-speaking internet anyone can enter and have a proper discussion about anime without any stupid filters or rules, provided you go to the right thread at the right time. Like most things on 4chan it is a pile of shit-stained straw with the ocasional diamond in it that makes it worth it. Yes, there are much, much worse places out there. Good god there are. May you never have to step foot in them.     More like MC didn't choose the roleplay lesbian succubus dorm master and all the servants were girls of varying ages.  Would have been best world conquest ever.      I honestly wish there was a series about some otaku that got sucked into an rpg world and it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  The whole LN concept where this "normal" guy uses his "gaming smarts" to just completely bowl over some game world is just retarded. What's the point? What's the great story here? Them crushing the competition like it's nothing and sucking the tension out of every scene? What vacuous waste of animation money he's gonna impregnate? To see the same tropes get subverted in the same way ad nauseum?  Come on.         If those were underdesigned so that they can be animated properly then I expect decent animation. So far the trailer does not impress on that regard.     I have an argument against that.  When I was watching Log Horizon back then S1 had this animation friendly style. Everything was seamless even when the scenes got QUALITY. Then S2 boasted about how they were going to be true to the light novel art. It didn't translate very well to the silver screen.  It's not a bit sad when you think about it.           Not that anon but I think the fujoshit boogieman he was referring to was this kind of thought process  oh there are two male characters   must BE FUCKING FUJOSHIT TIME TO SPAM THREADS ABOUT IT GUCBSNCJDBF  That kind of nonsense although it will definitely be a free pass for fujoshit works          May you never have to step foot in them.  I regret to admit I participated in some of them in the past. But I've learned my lesson. Even after becoming somewhat of a normalfag this is the only place I'll discuss anime.    it turned out he was as much of a worthless piece of shit as he was in real life.  I know of two series like that, people who are very proud of their depravity. One is Highschool DxD and the other is a manga I forgot the title, but is about this neet named Niito who became a monster hunter when his mom died and he couldn't mooch off of her anymore.            using DEEN for a fair comparison     Theres probably plenty of LNs in which the MC stays worthless but those dont sell to the auduence that is looking for LNs for escapism. They probably gte filed under NTR-like fetishims. Youre looking at an industry that has grown fat from pandering and pandering sells and what sells gets animated so pandering gets animated. Theres probably some really fucking good material out there but you would have to find it first.   We are all a sum of our experiences so theres nothing to regret dude. All that matters is what you take home with you.         What are we going to do after next week? Is there any hope for more UFO Girl and Friends?   cri   I have hope for  s2   Did you see Reina today!!? did you see how  HETERO she is?   Why do we need constant back to back general threads?  Relevant: http://www.animemaru.com/hibike-eup<wbr>honium-episode-12-preview-shows-kum<wbr>iko-and-reina-scissoring/</wbr></wbr>     back to back threads = general threads  Why?     That's how popular anime works.   next episode is finale?  You may only chose one.   No, a dozen threads sprinkled across /a/ with the same dozen people flinging shit in all of them is much more fun.    Reina    Why I can't choose Natsuki.    No contest.    if they fill up then we need them. it doesnt seem complicated to me. if we didnt need them then they would 404 themselves. dont overthink it bro.    Kyoani will do it for /u/ Just wait and see    Buchou a best.     but muh 3rd years     Haruka.   Reina deserves Taki. She does.  they're back!  Where were you when both Shoe and Reina got NTR'd by UFO-kun?    Kumiko mentions she was with Taki   Reina mind goes blank for a second   Kumiko starts her end of the episode narration   Reina speaks over Kumiko's narration because she demands to know what happened  She is too cute        I choose Asuka if only for how comfortable her thighs look in this picture.    even when Kumiko mentioned she loved Eupho Reina didn't give a shit and keeps sayng her name hoping to get her attention back so she can tell her in detail what the fuck happened with Taki. Too fucking cute.     I still think Kumiko did it on purpose.  Too bad this isn't one of those shows where the characters chat over next episode previews.     Of course there will be more UFO related stuff from KyoAni. Who knows if it's a second season or a movie though.    last  reminder that Aoi was right   What was going trough reina's mind at that moment?   I'm just waiting for a PV of this during next week's episode.  Reminder that loser onee-chan was right and Kumiko was a bitch for no reason.    alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki   alone with Taki          All things that have a beginning must come to an end. That is precisely what allows us to appreciate them.    fuck this japanese ho   muh college   muh jerb   muh salary   no fun allowed   we dont even know what she wants to learn in college or what her dream even is.          4x3 is complete, now we just need the percussion section to ruin the perfection.  What section would you join? Who trombone here?      Onee-chan gives up her passion for music to become Generic Nippon Office Drone #246520356 and pressures her cute little sister to do the same   Being right about anything      Probably all of the things she'd do if she was alone with Taki-sensei   meep meep   Kaori    Oboe or trumpet. But mostly oboe.    If I'm already in the  flute  section, can I change?     big violin  chart ruined.      to become Generic Nippon Office Drone #246520356  To become a university student.     all they did was talk all night r-right?     big violin  every time     Like holding hands?    Move on and watch some other anime anon. It really isn't hard, plus Hibiki is good but it really isn't anything special.    Trombone section looks like a fun section.    i already played horn so might as well get with dem horns and start my harem    Yes Reina, yes.    And gentle walks home    doujins when    no fun allowed   I want to make Reina jealous.    Kaori.       harem of worst girls     Horn. Not for the girls (okay, maybe except grumpy-chan), but because I fucking love the instrument.    Well on one hand my specialty is the trumpet and I was good at it, and I'd have a chance to mingle with Kaori.  On the other hand that means playing with Ribbons and even the thought of playing with that bitch makes me throw up in my mouth a little.     would you NTR Reina?   never forget    man, that filtered photoshopped pic. kyoani is not even trying anymore.     Volleyball club     I can't believe she dropped the bottle and had this look   Just how deeply in love is this fucking girl? She'll never rest until she gets that dick.      I already played woodwinds so maybe I'll shoot for brass. Which is the hardest brass instrument here?    i hated that the subs didnt have reinas lines in this scene    Yeah, no. Fuck off to A-1 or WIT.  KyoAni will make Violet Evergarden.      How wet did she just get?    Percussion to relieve stress!    Yes. It'll be brilliant. Like tea first thing in the morning.    Tuba can be pretty tough if you have a weak constitution and don't breath well. French Horns are probably the toughest to play well.   I thought it was just coincidence I thought I was just being a faggot But now I know I'm fucking watching Japanese Whiplash      I'll join the based section    Bleeding hymen    I was just watching Whiplash today. Reminded me how the guy was drumming so hard his palms were bleeding, but of course not as extreme    Piccolo to comfort the cute, tall girl (Yoriko)     The instrument shading in this show is so underappreciated     I want to play the seal      Please go fuck yourself back to you're filthy jojo general thanks.    I'm surprised the biggest girl plays the smallest instrument. I wonder if she's height conscience. I want to  bully     Make it 3x4 with one centred in the bottom maybe.   Reminder that now both Reina AND Kaori have apologized and Ribbons still hasn't.    big violin  wat    That dorky smile.  Who /crack pairing/ here   how does one play a seal?

What category does the seal instrument lie under? Brass? Percussion? Woodwind?    is she in love with taki too now?    That's the baritone sax power-stance, it channels soul through the body and into the sax.     Yes Reina   I went to school late at night   Just to fuck our music teacher       I've seen people with triangle parts screw up during actual concerts.  Shit is just as embarrassing as it sounds.      contrabased    welcome to our threads, always glad to have new faces here, sorry you missed the last 3 months.    Did you hear that, Kumiko says she wants to get better   I hope this show gets better   DOHOHOHOHOHO      Where to start a harem?    op é faggot, definitely. Look at those extremely cute girls  plus waifu     kumiko lips     /a has trouble with shows that aren't Kyoani or Shaft. It's like it doesn't know what to do as a collective. It's funny because in Japan it's reasonably popular but not anything approaching a mega hit this season but with weaboos it's like the be all end all. I'd swear the west is more obsessed with Kyoani than Japan is.     Look at those badass motherfuckers in tenor sax.    how did Natsuki become undisputed best girl so quickly?     Says the one on a Hibiki general.   I was just answering the Op's question and telling him to move on, that's all. It's not like Hibiki is amazing or anything, no need to get butthurt.      The  light music club    Suddenly Taki is so friendly with Kumiko and order her to practice that part again. I wonder what happen on that dark classroom   What does it take to un-grump her?   something definitely went wrong here  Kyoani does it again.   Why is Mamiko so unperflat?     butthurt   Please, again, stick to your jojo general, cancer. It's not airing day anymore, or do we go there fuck up things? Yeah, no. So fuck off.

Yes    they gave her screentime    she won't want it unless you're taki   Why is she crying?   Taki sensei is going to be a lucky man     she wants to get better     She isn't special enough.    Remember how we used to talk "I wish I could see more of her" in the first episodes?  They literally just gave her a more screentime.      I've heard that clarinet is pretty easy.     Implying Taki will hit that   Ever      Then why is Squidward so shit?    umaku naritai    Kumiko gave Mamiko all of her kumikos. This way Kumiko is perflat.      Maybe it's because he's a squid.    Start with the double reeds.    Because he's playing underwater    Hayamin for the ear-sex. Asuka for marriage and impregnation. Kaori for casual sex.    because her show ends next week    Kumiko spent like 70% of this episode coated in moisture, either sweat or tears or both.

It's wicked easy. Like all wind instruments it requires a bit of stamina and learning circular breathing can be tricky, but on both counts it's not nearly as demanding as just about anything else in a concert band.    Kumiko has breast envy. Which also means she spends a good amount of time describing each of the girls chests.    I would go with the soprano clarinets first then maybe move up to the double reeds.        Imitation butter. Japan's a bizarre place.    kumiko_blowing_her_true_love.jpg   Saekano volume 8 is out.

It just that, narratively Kazusa end is more prominent in presence.   Utah's is the most genuine. All other girls are manipulative and fake.   the person in the middle here is setsuna     Both heroines won.  Yeah, no.     Tennis and fucking PING PONG have gotten an anime   Still no F1 anime aside from that one "F" from the 80's but that barely counts and Capeta only gets to like F3 at the very end  What the fuck is wrong with these damn nips      "F" from the 80's but that barely counts   Why? It's an anime and it's about F1 racing. That should count plenty.      No Japanese drivers.    It barely gets into it on a technical level and F1 cars have changed vastly in the past 30 years.    no F1 anime, except that F1 anime that does not count  Yeah, sure.    That might be why  impying the japs are good drivers    See  It's not like baseball or tennis where shit hasn't changed in 100+ years        Why must japan make videos that YOU a gaijin PIRATE wants? Sure, you like NASCAR and F1 racing. But NASCAR and F1 is not a big thing in Japan. If anything, auto racing fandom is most prevalent in the american South where the confederate flag reigns supreme with the auto racing fans.   Little girl Takuma Sato crashing everyone    Isn't F1 more of a European thing? Anyway, to answer OP's question: Japan is too busy drift racing on the streets to bother with F1.      Sato   Not Kobayashi      What is F1?   F1 would be pretty damn boring as an anime.  Redline is way more fun.    Sports manga is stupid and predictable.  Initial F when   watching rich teenagers "racing" in go-carts   shiggy diggy    A bunch of rich white people and one rich black guy race fast cars in circles to appease the Jews   People said the same thing about Ping Pong the Animation, but that turned out good.        manga is stupid and predictable  Fixed      This so hard. How can anyone find this trash interesting?      Did someone say F3 anime?   I suppose that means Araki is no longer watching racing since May 1994.     If he retires   retires  Well, technically...      You just have to be involved with racing to really love it.  not being part of a racing team      its hard to give power levels and super powers to car drivers.   If they turn Romain Grosjean and Pastor Maldonado into cute girls, I'm all for it.   Sure you could, but not in sanctioned races with more or less identical competing cars.     Who needs F1 when you have Cyber Formula?     but cyber fórmula is shit    Formula racing went the way of giant robots, sci-fi and tentacle porn: they're all outdated themes for anime.   f-zero anime soon?   They have Sato. But he's an indycar driver.   Anime about moe Senna and Prost when?

If it is made, you will probably complain that it is CG.  The stuff you mentioned came from manga. So you should hope a good and popular F1 manga is made instead.     At least the show wasn't full of bullshit like "OH MAN DAGUMI DID IT AGAIN HE BEAT A 500HP SKYLINE IN HIS SHITBOX COROLLA". Wangan Midnight is at least realistic   <br/>   F's sequel ended in 2006, so you can count it as somewhat recent, I guess. OP would need to know moon to read that though.   Psuedo-events sure are exciting.   but I absolutely adored IGPX, and I stand by the fact it's probably one of the best uses of CG in well over a decade    You seem upset anon   This thread made me check if there was a recent translated release for Capeta.   Thankfully, there was indeed one.      the filename  real edgy anon you should feel pretty cool right now      Races are not sports  Better tell all those track and field guys what they're doing isn't a sport then    SPEED RACER ADAPTATION BY TRIGGER WHEN?!?!?   F1  Yeah, no one cares because they would just copypasta 3d cars drifting on race tracks.     There is always F91.   Why bother? They'd put just as much animation into it as the original.   I fucken knew I was not the only one wanting an F1 anime.  Who in the right mind would make an F1 anime at this age?  F1 has been and still is losing viewers. Fuel/tyre management is not fun for either the drivers or the fans. At least in the Schumacher era teams were giving it all.    taking shots at LEGENDS on a chinese image board. enjoy dying a nobody   We haven't gotten an Ace Combat anime either even though AC5 and ACZ are animebait stories.

Fuck that, I want a rally anime.  Arrow emblem grand prix no taka, what a fucking great anime   There was one in the 80's, I forget the name though.   That's because Tennis and Ping Pong are popular sports that are even played in the Olympics while car racing is a niche that only rednecks like.   A favor del viento voy a correr, Porque el viento es fiel amigo en mi vida. Es mejor, es mejor Ir con el.       It's only a matter of time before we get a Card Games in F1 Racers anime.    rally/drifting is boring IRL, and translate terribly into animation.  me? I'd love some sort of futuristic Jet engine Craft a la Jet Moto       You've never watched Initial D, have you?    The guys I met in Japan who were into F1, were older who had no interest in anime aside from Ghibli. The young people like volley, basketball, baseball, and football.   Ping pong is popular?       car racing is a niche that only rednecks like   F1 had 425 million viewers last year      Because F1 is retarded. And we already had a good racing anime.    why do you want anime of a boring/dead motorsport?     425million people accidentally changed to the wrong channel while flipping to some Footy      there are 425 million rednecks in this world       its hard to give power levels and super powers to car drivers   Seriously?         mfw I'm a volunteer for a NASCAR team   I'd say it feels good but the fact is I'm just some would-be NEET who's calling and emailing people from my house asking them to spend their money on a back-of-the-pack Truck Series team just so we can have fresh tires and a fresh engine.         rednecks   f1   As much as I'll shit on F1 fans, more than 2 turns is too complicated for rednecks to understand        There will never be a Sprint Car anime  Why even live?

I hope you get to live out your dream of going fast and turning left.    I know I'm an outright heretic for not liking the personification of battleships and tanks, but god damn would I be down for car-girls.    Jet Set Radio anime when   I wonder what will become of this series. I'd love to see Rolling Girls: speed bike edition  Racing is stupid. Combat sports are the only real sports. K1 used to be huge in Japan. Half of Japan watched the 2002 Grand Prix Finals. Nips shown to have great taste yet again.    F1  No, fuck that, I want a hypercar anime sponsored with yours truly, Koenigsegg.     I'm pretty sure that's gonna get an anime adaptation.     Dat glorious V6 McLaren-Honda   McLaren-Honda now  It's sad but at least it's Honda's first year as an engine supplier since 2008.       425 million viewers worldwide   not niche  The 2011 Women's FIFA World cup in Germany pulled 400MM viewers world wide, so if your faggot sport is barely edging out divegrass: butches and waifus, then its niche.      If it didn't have those massive wings for downforce would it actually go airborne at speed?    I'm pretty sure it's already confirmed.   Just make the cars girls.    Nope. Non-winged sprints are common and I believe "takeoff" speed is around 195 MPH which sprints aren't hitting     Well, you can improve it.  Add cute girls.   Add yuri subtext.   The cars are modeled in CG and are really acurate to appease the F1 fags.   They race in psychedelic rainbows streets in space with heavy light filters   ????   Profit.          Who needs F1 when there's  F0 ?   It's more to help with the hectic skidz in the turns because these things get sideways, but the wingless ones get even more sideways. They still manage to pop wheelies occasionally even with the wings. Example of how you can see the difference in angle during the turns: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lFK<wbr>--PFz9DY</wbr>  [ ]      You don't even need rainbow streets, just make interesting rivalries with female drivers (because who are we kidding, they wouldn't make something more serious or realistic), and bam, something worth watching.    YES THIS. Especially when most of these cars go faster than NASCAR.    Why would going into technical details be interesting? That's not what makes all the tennis anime and Ping Pong good.    pre-emptively claiming curly-chan    Yeah even tanks have gotten an anime. F1 must be uncool or something.    Wangan Midnight did it and it made it more interesting to car enthusiasts    mah nigga IGPX is my shit    I thought a mango I read way back in the day was F1 related, but after a bit of googling turns out it's F3000 (and a moto gp one shot)   Mach 5 showing up in Yatterman Night was great.    I really wish the guys who worked on it worked on the remakes more. Fuck Crowds.            Go on.   Watch Cyber Formula OVAs. Not F1, but still a fun racing series.  Double One &gt; Zero = Sin &gt;&gt;&gt; Saga &gt; TV Series  Luckily you can ignore most of the TV series and just skip straight to the OVAs.      Car racing is for rednecks.   Not enough eurobeat to go around. if you want car anime/manga you got initial d and wangan midnight and nit much else       You don't need to repeat the same thing over and over again.       Mclaren races this year    dont forget there was a mahjong anime also  Hey kid, why haven't you joined Marussia yet?  Also, has McLaren finished a single race this season yet     F1  Fuck that, I want an anime about the only race still worth watching.    /dbt/ please go   Well this looks like a good thread to ask. I'm trying to remember this old anime I watched when I was a kid(though it could be a western cartoon) it was about a guy who was a racer but during a race he slipped on an oil patch and crashed. After that he was trying to become a driver again and it took place in Spain.    I was going to say Initial D until the whole Spain thing, but consider me interested too.    I like you.  Their supercar models look like total ass but if they keep trying in the F1 races then that's beside the point isn't it?        Their supercar models look like total ass  I dunno, going by looks alone, I think that looks very supercar-ish, and that's what matters, not conventional good looks.    subaru anime about magic girls fuck you, Japan....     Subaru a shit with good PR department, they were nowhere near as good at rally as Lancia. Even Citroen and Peugeot won more WRSc than Subaru.   I just want a hypercar anime. Is this too much to ask?  Cute girls fawning over 3 million dollar racing machines is plenty of content for 12 episodes.     So a Countach anime.    Aventador&gt;Countach Just sayan.

He just screams 'generic hotblooded shonen protag', complete with spiky hair and shitty eyebrows.    The character models look like something out of a badly made video g--  Oh.      How about no   some faggots probably never saw GOD EATER 2 RAGE BURST https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=16T<wbr>VwHBGvYg</wbr>  [ ]    Generic hotblooded protag is better than generic bland Mr. Nice Guy protag.     he's not even a fucking nice guy. People who talk about the spin-offs have probably never eve fucking looked at them.  Yuu's a fucking beta bitchboy that vents out against other people. It's the most aggrevating shit ever. If he's not doing that he's Mr. Invisible that just exists to react to the plot and nothing else       This looks like it's gonna have all the same problems as UBW    So... the change was good?      I'd rather laugh at an edgy tryhard MC than have to endure 12-13 episodes of WOE IS ME AND MY NAKAMA, so yes the change is good.      I don't know. PV wise, it wasn't even as promising as UBW's.      Is this a new meme? Is UFOTABLE hate going to be the next hipster meme due to how popular fate was?  People were praising the unique art style last time the PVs were posted.       Need fucking underboob.   What does ufotable hate have anything to do with this? If anything, the trailer looking that ugly stings worse because we expected better from based ufotable.      based ufotable   they can't handle tv productions worth a shit. 2nd cour of UBW was a trainwreck to the point where they had to get an outsider (Nozomu ABE) to animate literally everything that wasn't a still as well as using digital effects to cover up animation shortcuts more so than their standard.  If anythings to be said about God Eater, its how the fuck ufotable will handle this right after UBW considering it isn't a nasu works where you can just blow digital effects all over the screen to impress normies.          Ufotable is so epic     I don't particularly care how the studio makes something look good as long as it does, as long as I'm not looking at slideshows of action scenes and it doesn't have CG in really odd places.  UBW looked good. Right now God Eater doesn't.       impress normies  On the contrary, it doesn't take a lot to impress them.     normalfags are the most easy to impress, what the hell are you going on about?    Are you daft? Abe was working with them since UBW's first half, and studios inviting freelancers on board is nothing new. Also, Abe wasn't the only heavy-hitter on the project, Ufotable's own Masayuki Kunihiro and Mitsuru Obunai contributed a fair amount of well-animated scenes too. For the latest episode they did Shirou vs Gill inside UBW while Abe animated excalibur. You are right about UBW's second half dropping in quality, though they managed to keep things together in the end. God Eater on the other hand is dead on arrival, perhaps Bandai Namco shouldn't have booked it for summer.   Girls' Work   God eater has an amazing director helming it at least but that seems to of done nothing for it in it's favor     bamco has had a recent history of rushing projects out to meet their stupid anniversary dates. They have no idea what the hell they're doing anymore. And it was stupid of them to try to get ufotable to rush out the first episode in time for GEFes while UBW hasn't even finished airing yet.      ufotable isn't A-1. You can't throw multiple large projects at them at once and expect them to have the internal manpower to actually do it all.    Unlimited Budget Works has been used up I guess. I don't like the art style so I'm not going to watch this anyway.    Is this post supposed to be a joke?     god eater is not a type moon work  different artstyle     Yes, I hope this won't affect Heaven's Feel.   why is everyone so worked up over an adaptation of a PSP game?

Komachi is scary, too scary. Yui and Yukino look more concerned than taken aback.       Yeah, that fish is big   - If there would be no refuge, it wouldn't find its own place... Always hiding, going with the flow, sticking with something... And hitting an invisible wall   - Which fish?   - It's about myself   I like this bit a lot. Seems like Yukino is finally coming to terms with what she wants to do; she was a lost fish but now that she has Hachiman and Yui, it seems like she finally found a home of some sort and will stop going with the flow   Makes me think Yukino is going away for a period of time; if so, then it means that she is not going to follow anybody's footsteps.             MAX 300 coffee  I would drink the shit out of that DDR used to be my fucking game.

Dont touch our goddess or she will NTR you     get home and cook dinner for her.   anon what is wrong with you, is it happy marrying a  vase ?       Hiratsuka and Sensei   You need to sleep, m8.     Alpha &amp; Beta    Made for titty-fucking     Iroha is the second biggest 8+Y shipper after Komachi though, no way she'd ruin all her hard work baiting one of them into finally taking the 8bowl.   Who would be a great trophy wife?   I wish she had heels on during the series instead of boots. Heels look a lot better on her anyways.     two right feet  Jesus Christ.     Give us your definition of "trophy wife" first.    Haruno. She certainly wouldn't be a good wife in any other respect.     yumiko has 2 left feet  Why, just why.    Irohasu!  8man should 8 both the girls against their will and see which one he likes better.   that's why Hayama won't fuck her    I'm gonna miss you captain. IROHA OR DEATH    What sort of position is 8?     I never noticed that, wow. Artist fuck up I guess      You have eccentric taste.      can't fucking unsee  Th-thanks anons.          I want the Irohafags to leave, you got your romantic moment translated already so please leave us alone to discuss the drama.   They wear a strap-on and fuck him in the ass.    In Japan? Yumiko. She's blonde. And very, very cute.    Sticking his 8 in them, typically via behing or missionary.    Eccentric how?    I fucking love cooking, Alton Brown is one of my idols. Yui's meme-flaw is a flat out win for me, since I don't mind the extra work and I'd get to play teacher in her efforts to not be a failure in the kitchen.    I'm trying to imagine a blonde Japanese woman being sexier than simple black hair. I just can't see it.  The only reason Yumiko looks cute with blonde hair is because she looks white.     At this point I'm okay with anyone but the spoiled rich brat bitch winning.   And the kind of girl who will be nothing outside of highschool. Her days are numbered, soon she'll just be some random pretty girl.     what the hell does a vase have to do with marrying Yui?     You underestimate how far in life being pretty will get you   間接キス!     I can't help it, she's on my mind.    Go watch Japanes Propaganda : The anime You'd like it.  Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken       At least you've clearly got your priorities straight.     I don't know actually; it's more of a vague feeling.  Yui &gt; Orimoto &gt; Miura &gt; * &gt; Yukino = Iroha = Haruno here.      Yui wont suffer r-right?   Nice quads, male sibling.   1/8  EITHER GIRL EXCEPT IROHA OR DEATH  Who do you think schlicks to 8man? Yui and sensei only?   Not remotely, memeposter sir.    I just fantasized about sitting in a room reading a book while Yukino does the same thing.   This makes no sense. There's literally no interaction, why is it so appealing?      2/8    saki    If you switched orimoto and iroha id be a pretty big fan of your taste, other than yumiko not being best    IROHA    3/8     quiet   peaceful   no awkward silence (at least if you're 8man)   reading is awesome   she probably smells nice        Where are the fake spoilers?   remember cake belongs in the top of the food group.    4/8    That's my nigga       don't need this heartboner right now man.      SAY YES      tfw when you'll never get to teach Yui MD and TD     At least we have a genuine understanding.         Heh, I didn't realise it. Great.  Thanks for telling me. Have a Saki.      There are couples who read books together you know. Whatever works best.    good    5/8    AH FUCK HIS PHONE WILL BE CONFISCATED  CONTRABAND  WEEKEND PASSES REVOKED         meme-flaw     6/8     Self-insert doujin  That's why Yuifag not GENUINE     7/8     Anon's right though.   KONICHIWA I'M BUSTY OPPAI-CHAN ALL FRIENDLY AND SWEET, B-BUT I CAN'T COOK!  It's a common form in Bengali cartoons.        Wait, how is Valentine's Day not over? Isn't every volume supposed to be a month apart?  The thought of Iroha somehow getting 8man alone and giving him some kind of Valentine gift is pretty exciting.      8/8    You've read my mind.     8man carrying iroha's bags even in yui's doujins   it's over my negroes      That's just an assumption, we don't know when the volume ended. V-day is probably over, though.     Goddamn meme trash. Typical of Vietnamese mobile paintings.    as expected of non-yuifags not understanding genuine.    Here, fixed for you  Iroha= Haruno &gt;Orimoto&gt;Yui&gt;Miura&gt;Yukino      More translated fanart here!    http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B       WHO IN THE FUCK KEEPS THEIR HAIR IN A BUN WHILE WASHING IT    Retarded people, that's who.     (  Gahamama - that's what 8man call yui's mom in Vol11      meme as an adjective  I wonder, when did you fucks get this fucking stupid?   Why the does it always seem like only Yui shit gets TL'd?         Jesus, I don't know where to begin with you.     switch Miura and Yui and I'll take it     only Yui shit gets TL'd  Yui shit as in only her bad doujins or as in only Yui's doujins?      because she's the best girl    What's going to happen in the next episode?   I feel so sorry for Sakifriends. It's never going to happen, even though it wouldn't be bad if it did     ALL GLORY TO YUMIKO    Highschool teen DRAMA R A M A         Truck     this desperate to pretend Iroha's ship isn't sunk     You got that backwards.    An interesting stance    We will never falter, never give up. If the boat has to sink, I'll be guiding it to the depths of sea myself.     openly flirting with 8man over an indirect kiss   sinking  You what.      Why is Yui such a slut? Look at that cock hungry expression.    I reiterate my previous statement.    Except it's mostly Iroha that gets the translations and typesets done. You really need to lurk more.      yukino over yumiko  get a load of this faglord     I meant things containing Yui tend to get TL'd more then other girls' stuff.   Yeah, her too. They both have 42 images on       Hold up for a second, guys. At what point does Iroha pull out the spoon? Pic related implies that it's in his mouth for the entire conversation (as Iroha touching her lips is before his 2nd answer).   mfw saika comeback from thailand   1/12    implying Yui didn't just sink herself at the end of the volume     They're about even, really.  And Yukino's practically out of the running, since she doesn't seem to have nearly as much fan comic stuff on pixiv.      2/12    But some of those Yui ones are old, like S1 old. Iroha has been getting most of the shit done recently.     every thread  Are people ban-evading, or not getting banned at all?    3/12    Not entirely sure she did but she did try to make Yukino and hachiman speak their minds (I think that was her intent when she was all "If I win I want things to stay the same"  I think she knew what would happen if she said that but she did it to help the other two open up.      The latter.    4/12    mods are surprisingly lenient, i only got warned for saying "JUST CUCK MY SHIT UP" in an annoying manner and haven't shitposted outside of a yahari thread since    5/12   Is Yukino going to win yes or no ?   this is very important.     No mention of that in the translations that we got. But it does seem like he still had the spoon in his mouth just before dropping the flirt bomb on her.     SLUT    Body, face, and personality of a Goddess.    6/12    Yahari threads are most cancerous. What're you expect?    She better, or I'm gonna have to burn a couch.    Probably not. We're going straight into the loner / friendship ending.    She isn't even in love with Hikki. If she was she would have let him kiss her.    No, Watari thinks Japan is ready for a story where second girl wins.   Better polish your couch-burning shoes then.         Wrong pic.    Very likely but anything could happen.    8/12     flat   blind   kuudere   goddess   You need to seek mental help, now.         9/12    i want to see our goddess in Bikini    Closer, but you were still a little off the mark.    All this Yumiko love  You guys are great     kuudere being bad  when has /a/ had better taste?      Watari thinks Japan is ready for a story where second girl wins.  Truly a man ahead of our times     10/12    Since Yuckynon debut      In other words, a hack.        11/12    No matter what Iroha does I feel nothing. Its just too easy to see through how much shes just putting on an act. Any picture I can't just think "hey she's cute" I gotta think, "look at the little she devil planning her shit. Who you putting that cute face on to trick?" 8man may fall for her routine but I won't. I'm not buying that shit.     being this much of an irohafag      first girl doesn't have a romantic development   she wins anyway   author is not a hack   Please, anon.           not writing another cookie cutter LN romance   hack  pick one      We dont know for sure yet. We do know that hayama might like her considering he gave her a trophy during one of his soccer matches in the latest volume.   Will they ever call Hikio by his real name?  Is it true that Iroha raped 8man in vol 11?    "What have I done to deserve this treatment?"     Yes, he was forced to taste Iroha's iroha.  And he liked it      Still doesn't change the fact that Watari or whatever this hack's name is, is in fact, still a hack.    Forced drama   Genuine   Standard romance   Bad fan base  seems pretty standard+            Hold off below for tomorrow   You're asking the impossible, Gahama-san.     Yui is the same as Hayama and friends. She likes being with Yukino and 8man, and fears losing this.    I would pay 15 percent of my paycheck for the rest of my life if they made an anime re-make of Good Eats, that show is so comfy.      not pinching her fat  0/10 shit tier doujinshi     Now that's alpha.    that's some chink joke. Basically it mean you marry some girl just to show off (and having sex while at it).    Here's another, suffer more!    Too bad, you're getting a remake of Good Burger. How does this make you feel?    that would probably elicit a squack from her and would ruin the mood    Seems like something 8man would do.     quick someone draw a pick of Iroha pinning 8man to the floor with his shirt open, chocolate smothered on his chest and her shoving a spoon into his mouth while she licks her chocolate covered fingers saying "Take it all you whore"      Stuff like that is literally what couples who have been together for more than 2 years do.   you run out of shit to say to each other and just enjoy each other's company most of the time, going out on dates when you can but for the most part it's just getting off work and chilling out together on your laptops       Soon (I hope).    implying it wouldn't get her fired up    Ep 13 anime tomorow?   Yes, shitfest incoming and maybe just one more week of BTB threads. Then it's all over.     and  fuck      all over  Nope, LN threads     LN threads don't usually invoke the cancer that this does. And depending on how fast Spyro translates it, threads will be very slow.     Okay so he'd still be a hack, but at least he'd earth some points for originality   So Hayama will win right? him and 8 will run away together and have hatesex   If he wants points for originality, it's best to have the dark horse win. In this case, Iroha.   Are you ready for the movie announcement after ep 13?    as long as it's at least two seasons, I'd be disappointed but optimistic     227 / 82 / 58   I smell a serious case of samefagging.    :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :(    Get shot, fujoshit    holy shit how are they so gay    I'd settle for a cameo character in Shokugeki   Still pretty happy. Especially if they got kenan and kel to come back for it      Why didn't they look away? Why were their eyes quivering? Why did he focus on her lips? Why did she lean in? Why is did she touch his knee when he is injured?       She's still too distant from the main narrative, it would be too much of an ass pull   Yui is the only girl that deserves to win   The main narrative doesn't have romance in it, it's just the trio trying to figure themselves out and causing drama and suffering in the process. Iroha's side narrative has been nothing but romance, for the better or for the worse.      originality     No, its still probably Yukino's victory in the end. Yui and genuine 3some ending are also possible.   Any other ending wont be possible given the story given how the volume ends      Blushkinon is cute.    she's too dumb for her own good, she doesn't deserve the 8    Meant to say    Any other ending wont be possible in the story given how Vol 11 ends       Shes obviously not that dumb if she got into the school theyre at. Where do people get the idea that shes stupid?    this thread    She's not dumb. She's bad with words.     post imgur folder typeset anon.     By the fact that she constantly demonstrates by being stupid in the LN. I'm not gonna go out and list them all because it would literally be copy-pasting half of the entirety of yui interactions that exist    list the instances where she did something smart or above average intelligence.    she plays up being simple. doesn't mean she's actually retarded. she's not in 8man's or Yukino's league intellectually but that's not to say she lacks potential. She wasted her youth being friends with shallow idiots unlike 8man or Yukino, so she was out having fun instead of being a loner and living vicariously through literature. Makes a big difference.    She outright says she's not very smart in the latest episode preview.    Did Yukinon fall in love with Hikki while I wasn't paying attention?    Romance has always been a thing between the main three, it just got pushed back in the priority list when Watari shifted gears from spice of life to PLOT.  You're also forgetting that the "romance" with Iroha is all one sided right now. 8man doesn't care about her nearly as much as he cares for Yukino and Yui.     Heyyahari bros, I just wanted to get you guys in with the stuff I've been doing for the series that makes things a lot easier and clearer to understand. I suggest going watching the first S1 and take extra attention to the dialogues while you are watching till the end of the first season. Then go and watch S2, but instead go and watch they last episode in reverse to the season opener and watch the rest of s2 backwards. Doing the will make you understand exactly what's going on a whole level.   I did like the way I did it in my discretion but it makes a *million times more sense, if you're a huge fan of the show and LN's.     Have you even seen the latest spoilers? 8man openly flirted back at Iroha.     sup' brother  have some housewife saki        watch s2 backwards  what?     http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B  Here you go.      Nope it's just the usual Oregairu overhype.  Wowit'snothing.jpg        saki section   good lord, thanks        Yeh watch backwards, instead of 1-12 in or you start with S2e12 and go backwards to you hit ep1 of S2. Pretty is to follow it just every in the show make show much sense     Yes I have and that's s very liberal interpretation of what happened. It also doesn't remotely compare to him baring his soul to the other girls in the last chapter.    She fell for him sometime after they made up.   8man should have pinned down Yukino against her will and do genuine things to her.    can you convince everyone first by explaining your findings by watching it backwards      against her will      liberal   Do you like me putting my saliva in your mouth? Do you think it's sweet?   Yes.   Okay, anon.   baring his soul   implying Iroha isn't searching for genuine with her senpai and made him take responsibility for it.   Open end with VN is my guess anyway.            So who was Rin's servant in the holy grail war  while EMIYA was still a kid and wasn't a counter  guardian at that point in time?

So far, this show is just a band of unlikable characters and tropes. I'm 11 episodes in. Does it git gud or should I drop it?  Just watch season 2. It gets good about 9 episodes in.   What seems to be your problem with Haruhi? Do you think it's generic because it's been ripped off non-stop for nearly a decade?  So skip four episodes, watch nine more episodes, and then it'll be good for five episodes?   Why do people like this show?     You'll eventually praise our goddess with us.    By what? I don't have the same drip feed on anime as you, anon-kun.   It's boring, the main character is a spineless douchebag, the alien girl is a ripoff of Rei, the main bitch is intolerable with no redeeming quality, the time travel bitch is basically raped by the main bitch every other episode, and even when something happens, nothing happens.     It's a meme, like Eva, Utena and LOGH  Eyes are really far apart.   Season one was very polemic because of its intentional anachronistic broadcast order. And the show was very entertaining, albeit somewhat basic. I can see people hating on it now because of season 2(it wasn't as good as season 1 and it had Endless Eight, but it had a few really good episodes) and because it can be considered a gateway SoL. And because when Haruhi aired people still "tYped laik Diz xD."   But the movie is undeniably good. I only hope that Snowy Mountain Syndrome could a movie adaptation.        Watch the series for the movie. Then come back and praise it.    I started watching the Yuki spin-off, and for some reason i actually enjoyed it. Haruhi was easily the best girl and I thoroughly enjoy the development Asakura and Tsuruya get in comparison to the original series, the animation and art style is quite decent and i enjoy the gags that are present. I can only hope that this leads into S3. I shed a tear when Yuki picked up Hyperion from the shelf last ep.   I've heard it all. Kyon is a spineless douche bag now. Not him btw.    git guud   While you're at it, please drop /a/ as well.     He bends to this chick's every whim. I get that it's part of the plot but it just feels like the writers wanted to make an entry level cuck anime.   just watch k-on     &gt;entry level cuck anime      But then that would mean he's just spineless? Where's the douche bag part?     He bends to this chick's every whim.  Does he? Does he really?     Fuck off back to /v/ you dumb faggot. And no, it doesn't get better since season 1 is the best thing about the show.     You're right, douchebag was unfitting and unnecessary.    Is /a/ ready for the upcoming season of Utawarerumono?   In-game, the mechs are still pretty much a surprise, but there's a lot more foreshadowing that there's something going on beneath the surface. Things like Hakuoro knowing about calcium and phosphorus, or the bits and pieces of background mythology, are all pretty suggestive. I mean, in the end the mechs still pretty much come out of left field, but the game is so much longer that it doesn't feel rushed, which is really made the anime seem weird.    Normally I'd tell you to read the VN but the show is equally good.    I'll try the VN later I'm still currently playing Sengoku Rance atm, and yes I'm ridiculously late for the party and it's surprisingly addictive. Probably watch the anime in between    Is this the anime with  Ice Man ? Wtf was up with that shit again?     Claims to be a sequel   Doesn't have the same MC   I don't like the sound of that.
