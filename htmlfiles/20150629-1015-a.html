It was just weird.</br></br>  I share this image with as many people as I can. I even posted it on Facebook.  <br>There wasn't very much of Narutaru that wasn't unpleasant. <br><br>Anything that wasn't stomach-turning was just a bummer. I read the whole thing cause I like being sad, but I don't exactly look back on it as a good use of my time.</br></br></br>  I enjoyed Highschool of the Dead. The storyline was powerful, especially the ending.<br><br> I'm being serious </br></br>  <br>So is ARM really somehow a completely mundane sports manga, or am I going to get sucker-punched if I go into it expecting that?

Narutaru got so over-the-top that emotional investment was almost impossible.</br></br>  <br>It's written by westerners, too. And you can get it in either:<br><br>right-to-left, or<br>left-to-right<br><br>versions</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kimi machi Asuka break-up scene.jpg    <br>It's literally in OP's image.</br>  <br>I don't see the problem in raising your own waifu</br>  <br> Space Jam <br><br>I'm mad.</br></br></br>  <br>this is how to make /a/ mad , not how to make /g/ mad<br> install gentoo </br></br>  What hurts isn't the NTR. What hurts is that she really started falling in love with MC and ruined it for herself.  <br>Found the manlet.<br><br>Hello, little guy.</br></br></br>  At least it makes me sad  ;_;   Can't believe this isnt posted yet.  <br>You can post every page of this manga and each panel would be rage inducing <br><br>Sister a slut.</br></br></br>  <br>I love how the guy just walks away from the whole thing. What an awful sister.</br>  <br>The devastation was biblical</br>  <br>I actually enjoyed that manga</br>  <br>I could never get into the suffering drama in this. It was hard for me to really get attached to the characters when everything they did was aimed directly at my dick.</br>  <br><br> hurr durr Lolicon did the right decision after statutory rape of the girl </br></br>  <br>Just before she got found she mentioned that she only wanted the MC to father whatever is born from her doing it raw with the punk. Also, she was obviously enjoying the sex better with the punk like the slut she was I don't know why people would wanna be cucked by her but that part of the manga triggered me a bit</br>  <br>She's nine, come on. The dad and the friend are the awful ones.</br>  <br>Okay going to read it.</br>  GUYS<br><br> RINKAS EXCLAMATION BELATE <br><br> WAS RAINED </br></br></br></br>  <br> 127292401 <br>Naruto &lt;3</br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah nah, she knew what she was doing.</br></br></br>  <br> victim blaming </br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Hmm hm...</br>  <br> he doesn't know what statutory rape means <br> "she was asking for it" <br><br>Read the fucking law.</br></br></br></br>  <br> an older teenager actually acts upon his lust on a younger child <br> blame the younger child </br></br>  <br>Okie dokie buddy.</br>    <br> bottom left <br>   Kyon... kun? </br></br>  <br>Mmm-hmm.<br><br> In some common law jurisdictions, statutory rape is sexual activity in which at least one person is below the age required to legally consent to the behavior.[1] Although it usually refers to adults engaging in sex with minors under the age of consent,[1] it is a generic term, and very few jurisdictions use the actual term statutory rape in the language of statutes.[2] </br></br></br>  <br>She still wants his dick after timeskip</br>  <br>Can't you just admit that loli was a slut through and through.</br>  <br>You do realize that regardless of the consent of the minor, if he or she is under the age of consent, that's still rape, right?<br><br><br> S-She was asking for it! The little naked girl is asking for it. <br><br>Found the pedo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> blaming the rape victim </br>  <br> Space Jam <br>All is forgiven</br></br>  <br> the guy himself was blaming himself for raping a little girl <br> n-no, s-she's the slut <br><br>Did you even read it?</br></br></br></br>  Obviously  <br> the guy himself was blaming himself for raping a little girl <br> n-no, s-she's the slut <br>That just further proves she's a slut and rapist.</br></br></br>  <br>She was best girl the entire time.</br>  <br> AMG shit storm spilled over to /tg/ <br> <br>It was beautiful. Such an uproar when something finally fucking happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that there was much of a choice; Aiko was just a psycho and practically no other girl mattered.</br>  <br>the sister fucked up the most.</br>  <br> that's not punpun's mother </br>  <br>that stupid law only applies to the united states and a few other unimportant and illogical countries.</br>  <br>All we need is this.</br>  <br>I hate when characters cut their hair.</br>  <br>you should add like one of the last panels from ressentiment. great manga btw</br>  <br> That just further proves she's a slut and rapist. <br>see <br><br>The minor isn't the rapist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that stupid law only applies to the united states <br> The Japanese Penal Code sets a minimal age of consent of 13.[37] However, all prefectures and districts have (largely similar) "obscenity ordinances" (淫行条例) that forbid "fornication" (淫行) with anyone under 18 years of age, but exempt sex in the context of a sincere romantic relationship (typically determined by parental approval).[38] <br><br>Eve in Japan, he's a rapist, though. Please keep on victim blaming, you piece of shit pedophile.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm just waiting for this to turn into a "why men can't accuse women of rape"</br>  Seriously, guys, this "the elementary schooler raped the college student" shit is beyond obvious bait. Stop replying.<br><br><br> Aiko was just a psycho <br>Aiko wasn't really a psycho. She was just scared and not really a functional person. Punpun was far more psycho.</br></br></br></br>  <br> those hands <br><br>It's like a fucking Facehugger.</br></br></br>  <br>i can see this panel being rage inducing if you had a younger sister<br><br>or if you are a virgin</br></br></br>    <br>By being raped?</br>  <br>I hate the Aji Tae one the most.<br>Thank you.</br></br>  <br>By forcing herself on others.</br>  Why did people rage at Kagami no Kuni? Because the author ragequit, or because it was a good manga, or both?  <br> I swear, officer! The nine year old forced herself on me! </br>  All those years of following this manga for nothing.  <br>because it wasn't interesting. mx0 and double arts were less interesting than naruto so Editor in chief had to drop them</br>  <br>does this only occur in the manga? I only watched the anime. do you remember the chapter?</br>  <br>Because the author managed to drive his manga and its sales straight into the ground in just two volumes, and then gave a shitty rushed ending and an "epilogue" chapter that literally resolved nothing, and it was the fucking Mx0 guy, which just made it worse.</br>  <br>Fuck, I wish I never get to know this series.</br>  <br> AVG <br><br>I'm pissed!</br></br></br>  <br>Truly a waste. At least early on she commented on how it was destined that they will fuck.</br>  <br>Best girl won</br>  <br><br>I'm 6'3" and it's my fetish too.<br>I almost wish I was a manlet so it could even be possible at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Kuronekofags</br>  <br> I'm 6'3" and it's my fetish too. <br>To get rejected by a 7" Amazon?</br></br>    <br>Fuck this is one of the few cases where I couldn't handle the edge. Get raped to death, injected with steroids or something so you don't die, then continue getting raped. Then the guy with cancer gets beaten to death at the end or something.</br>  <br>fuck that ending<br>fuck worst girl winning</br></br>  <br>It was sadder in the LN</br>  <br>The rage i felt this day could not be reproduce again.</br>     Best girl   <br><br> she's ok </br></br>  can we pass a law banning beta-ass MCs for their part in corrupting public morals?  <br>It's in every country you animal.</br>  Yup, still mad.  Sssseeeeeoooo  <br>Manga Only and around around Volume 11.<br><br>I don't think the anime could handle the second half of NaruTaru.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair it was a foregone conclusion from the outset<br><br>This is the problem of making a prequel</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Either way, you don't want to be chained to a sinking ship.

One Piece is the shittiest anime ever.  You're all weeb faggots  <br>i still dont get why i should be angry about the asshole of an mc not getting the girl.<br><br>Im actually happy for her, she was nice, her new boyfriend is nice and mc-kun didnt deserve anything good.<br><br>he deserved prison by the end of the manga actually.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>MC is such a fucking hero, he'll hop to a new timeline and fuck all the bitches again.</br>  How did Narutaru make you feel, /a/?  <br>Do you even need to ask?</br>  <br> 90% of series that end with killing everyone are garbage. </br>  <br> gay sex with HATS ON  <br><br>every time</br></br></br>  What's going on in this thread?  <br>I don't know...</br>  <br>jesus christ was that anime that explicit?</br>  <br>Fuck you man</br>    <br>Too far.</br>  <br>Wow... what a low blow.</br>  also:<br><br><br><br>fuck this bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>You did good, you made quite some people mad.</br>  <br>I still have bad memories about it, it wasn't an enjoyable read either - literally 0 catharsis, just very bitter.</br>  <br>I'm guessing you're talking about this</br>  <br>This is the one where the edgy MC goes back in time and rapes his childhood friend right?<br><br>I forgot the name of it though.</br></br></br>  <br> so many people taking P&amp;S that seriously <br>I'm sorry what</br></br>    <br>Neko was a shit character only for pathetic shits to feel sorry for and waifu. Someday you'll understand that.</br>  <br>1) why the fuck didn't you spoiler that shit?<br>2) Dunno, chinese cartoons are serious buisness for some people.</br></br>  <br>Then it all went downhill.</br>  <br>Truly the King of Gets</br>  <br><br>Just finished reading it. It was enjoyable, but the epilogue seemed pointless. I expected more to happen within it.<br><br>Overall, the characters were trainwrecks on all fronts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hetakoi (top row center, kissing) didn't actually follow through with the attempted NTR<br><br>MC's climactic confession scene to blondie there played exactly to my fetish of nude body heat sharing, and the ending is them fucking like rabbits, so all in all a good end</br></br></br>  <br>But that's when the series actually got good.</br>  I'm surprised no one's posted the hentai manga were the girl says "You know it really hurts having your Hymen broken"  <br>Fuck, no. No no no. Don't mention that shit</br>  <br>Has it really already been three months?</br>  <br>but of all laotian pictographs to take seriously, P&amp;S?</br>  The MGX ending  <br> Archive link please? </br>  <br>I haven't even read it and i'm afraid of it</br>  <br>Thank for the reminder.<br>I still have it on my HDD.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I just posted it earlier in the anime thread.</br>  <br>It has a "happy" ending, but reading the whole thing was just a depressing experience</br>  <br> Happy <br> Gangbanged by hundreds of men and pregnant from them </br></br>  <br>Watching the premier for this was fucking amazing<br><br>So many mad Kuronekofags</br></br></br>   Kansai cheated on Molester.   <br>I said ending, and i said "happy".</br>    <br>Does the MC go full beta and forgives her and keeps the kid?</br>  Where's that proud wolf getting his GF raped    Maybe not all of /a/, but the Shimizu and Masumi part of Punpun was always the most frustrating. I fucking hate this retard so much.  Zoom in.<br>I dare you.</br>  <br>Please don't remind me.</br>  <br>Man what a thread, does anyone have the post number of the thread when  Aiko actually died ?</br>    <br>I was sad at first, but then worst girl won my heart and became best girl.</br>  <br>What was this called again? I tried googling time travel neet loser manga and got Mujaki no Rakuen.</br>  The fucking asspain when it happened  <br>because you should know their names already</br>  i got a good one  <br>Was amused.</br>  <br>I"m just glad peeping girl came back in the end, even if it was rushed as fuck.</br>  <br> Takigawa and NTRfro break up <br> Kurosawa acquires hot tsundere girlfriend <br>B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> End up with tsundere bitch <br>Yeah, it was rage-inducing all right</br></br>  <br>Who's the retard? Shimizu or the other one?</br>  <br>All this time<br>ALL THIS FUCKING TIME <br>And it still hurts</br></br></br>  <br>Shimizu</br>  <br>Isn't that the lame story about that guy having a crush on that whore who kills herself? You'd have to be sorry to feel sad from that.</br>  <br>There is no happiness in quzilax's heart. At all. Hell, even ShindoL shows mercy sometimes, and does a heartwarming story, like Derenashi, This Ojou-sama or FLower on the battlefield.<br>But quzilax... no happiness, all suffering.<br>Fuck quzilax.</br></br></br>  <br>The tsundere was miles better than that slut</br>  <br>I wish i was around when Gyro died</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127297909 <br><br>*slow clap*</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127297909 <br>Boku no im in love with the coco</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127297909 <br>You could try harder than that.

Spoil it for me?</br>  <br>I remember that<br><br>fuck you<br><br>so much</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>The composition of that scene is so great though, isn't it?  Sea foam might be a reference to the original ending of the Little Mermaid, but the rocking of the waves also suggests that the motion of her hand is actually passive from his activity, like flotsom bobbing in the waves -- she has already passed on at this point. </br></br>  Nothing makes me rage like NTR in non-h works.<br><br>My blood fucking BOILS.</br></br>  <br>Belldandy lied through deception. She even liked the pampering she recieved and wanted it to stay that way. Even goddesses can be like this.</br>  <br>He did some vanilla stories. Lurk moar on panda site.</br>  <br>wait a second, I only watched the full metal panic anime how is the manga rage inducing? seriously here, they didn't fuck this up did they?</br>  <br>This guy. This fucking guy here. Underrated post.</br>  <br>This bothers me a fuck ton.</br>  OP missed the worst dead in Eden  <br>And just think, the only reason she kissed him to make a new contract is because she knew her ruse was up.</br>  The last few pages of this.

Holy shit I was mad. </br>  <br> Hell of a place to start. Kana was my first VN, and go figure, with my luck, there are literally no happy endings. I got fucked.  But so did Kana, so she probably died content. Can't say the same for Taka though. </br>  <br>It was a good ending or bittersweet.</br>  <br> I seethe with anger whenever I think about that twist, I can understand at the time they couldn't do such a thing in VNs but still. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127298839 <br>Back to your containment board toe-fag</br>  <br>Best girl win.<br><br>No reason to be mad.</br></br></br>  <br> I was completely unprepared for the pain this game inflicted on my. I 100% it in the hopes that there was a secret ending that expanded on the first, where Kana lives and stays with Taka. Everything about this fucking VN is suffering, I tell you </br>  <br> /a/ <br> Not a containment board </br></br>  <br> no happiness, all suffering <br>Whenever I read Quzilax Im reminded of how this stuff could actually happen in real life.<br>Quzilax is the hero we deserve.</br></br></br>  AAAAJIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr><br>TAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr><br>Every thread, all day long.<br>When SaO meant something else.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br>I don't read doujin's for realism, i read them for jerking off, or for a cute story every now and then. SO for me, Quzilax is anathema, because I can't fap to rape, unhappiness, or NTR.</br>  <br>The mc was a chicken shit. He should have gotten ntr for his retarded decisions.</br>  <br>Explain me this anon? I only remember reading this ages ago.</br>  Man fuck this thread I can't take it anymore. I feel like barfing.  <br> this manga </br>  <br>What happened in the Ah My Goddess! panel?</br>   thread is about making people mad <br> still bite the bait <br><br>Please.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127297909   <br>Presumably that's where she explains that she's been cockblocking him all these years.</br>  <br>Being with Belldandy required MC's libido taken away and Belldandy never told him.</br>  <br> I can't fap to rape, unhappiness, or NTR. <br>fucking casual</br></br>  <br><br>Is that really such a bad thing? From what I remember reading years ago, it's always been a relatively pure manga. I thought it was going to be like Belldandy never had true feelings for the MC because she was forced into the relationship or something.</br></br>  <br>Getting magically neutered without consent is pretty scummy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127297909 <br> weak bait <br> people are getting mad at you for posting such weak bait <br>11/10 teach me master</br></br></br>  <br>I never understood why people were angry at it myself as well.</br>  <br>Best post in the thread.</br>  <br>Yeah, but he gets a Goddess in return. It's really not that bad.</br>  <br>I'm so mad.</br>  <br>How am I suppose to trust a bitch that magicially neuters me without even telling me. Who knows what else she is lying about.</br>  <br>More from the same author</br>  <br> that shit was three months ago <br>what the fuck, wheres all my time</br></br>  <br>Who won? Onee-san or that retarded loli?</br>  <br> cheated on him <br> blamed him for her manga getting turned down <br>Her worse action was getting involved with Punpun in the first place.That says more about her character than the following actions. <br><br>the relationship was just two broken and damaged goods getting together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wahhh </br>  <br><br>Umareru Kachi no Nakatta Jibun ga Anna no Tame ni Dekiru Ikutsuka no Koto</br></br>  <br>But it isn't.

Good manga to try to deconstruct and analyze</br></br></br></br>  Some anons seemed pretty mad after this was posted. Questioning whether or not I should read it and find out why.  <br>Say shit like </br>  That doujin that began with the main female character throwing pencils at the MC and ended up with the MC being a slave basket case.  <br> boko no pico <br> gay sex with HATS ON <br> how do i take a screen shot <br> reddit <br>TOP <br>FUCKING <br>KEK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's absolutely nothing to get pissed about it.<br><br>I can only imagine people getting pissed is that the Onee-chan dies pretty early into the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Only an idiot wouldn't have seen that coming.<br><br>It was the usual rage-reply bandwagon.</br></br></br>  <br>Nisekoi always seemed like garbage.

No one was really surprised. It was like Fuuka - everyone was having fun screaming about it, even if they didn't read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What angers me is that the edgy faggot who began instigating the hatred against the kids with hte monsters got to die peacefully by fasting while the world went to hell around him</br>  <br>If I remember right, this manga was brought to the US, but censored and some lazy mangareader sites had this version scanned instead of the japanese one fan scanlated.</br>  <br> God put a literal cockblock on K1 so that he'd be physically unable to want to fuck Belldandy, keeping their relationship platonic. <br><br> Belldandy knew and did nothing about it.

I was sort of prepared for loli, but Helena was out of nowhere right after the arc where she was overtly in danger ended. I flipped a shit.</br>  <br>Fuck you!</br>  <br>Only about 3/4 of it was published in the USA, in heavily censored form; apart from a service patch of Aki Honda's death, I don't think there was ever any scanlation of the early parts -- I just helped with getting the last and previously untranslated volumes scanlated.</br>  Maybe it's been already posted but Sasha no Bradley, quite enraged me.  <br> posts from 2010 <br><br>This place was around back then?</br></br></br>  The chat literally exploded.  <br>Eh, 6/10.</br>  <br> filename <br> those results <br><br>lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ <br><br>You mean f/a/te since a good third of this board is fateshit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You could also get pissed about wasting your time with this manga.</br></br>  I don't think SAO is as bad as everyone says it is<br>  i'm not joking  </br>  <br>It wasn't horrible, but the only good part was the animation. The MC was a Gary Stu, MUH POWER OF LOVE bullshit, and the second half was boring</br>  <br>What are up with the chapters in this? I'm reading chapters 5.1, 5.2, etc and they're not related at all.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the main story ends with 5. Not sure, though, don't quote me on that</br>  <br>would of been 10/10 if the mc wasnt kirito, it was actually about using actually tactics and teamwork against the raid bosses , and whole season was in the 100 floor dungeon</br>  <br>At least this had an okay ending, even if the story went full retard to get there.</br>  <br>fuck you nigger i forgot about gaia for years</br>    <br>Is this shirobako?? I am 70% complete but I've never seen such gore there. WTF!</br>  <br>I mean is bokurano ...sorry</br>  Why is Ayase rage inducing?  <br>BUT IS THIS BOKURANO????</br>  <br><br>This is Naruto, fuckwads.</br></br>  <br>I see. On mangahere it goes up to chapter 6 but everything after 5 are random shorts. Regardless they helped lighten the mood after finishing that trainwreck so I kept reading.</br>  <br>I'm pretty curious as to what happens. Does imouto continue being a slut, or does Onii-chan start showing her the proper love needed?<br>Does Kanda ever come back into their lives?<br>Does Onii-chan ever patch things up with his dad, and apologize for being a twat?<br>Questions, questions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, well by random I meant completely unrelated to the story at all. As in may have not even been by the same auhtor. In a few of the shorts I saw a resemblance with the characters but the stories and names were different.</br>  <br>No, i know what you mean. the 5.1,2 and so on are just omake. I was talking about the actual story</br>  <br>In my opinion things will get better. They're all still fairly young so they have time to emotionally mature and make amends. <br><br>I do have a feeling that the sister will become one of those easy girls who has sex with everyone in an attempt to get the love she craves.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't think there was ever any scanlation of the early parts <br> The first couple volumes were from the Dark Horse manga (since it was published western style they stick out) but there were a few that had the uncensored scenes included so someone must've added the translation over raws or something. I might be wrong but the series was one of the first things I downloaded off 4chan when /rs/ and megaupload were a thing.</br></br>  <br>I hope not. I hope that, in maturing and reflecting on what happened, onii-chan shapes up and gives his sister the love she needs so she doesn't go down that path.<br> As an onii-chan, this manga stirred up fears i was never aware of </br></br>  <br>You know, that would make Shirobako 10 times more interesting.</br>  <br>Why don't you fuck off you disgusting Crossboarder who only coming here for tg shit. Holy shit Fucking kill yourself. Read more manga</br>  <br> triggered </br>  <br>That smile, ahaha</br>  <br>No! Actually mangafags are the most cancerous here! :^)</br>  <br>Imagine reading this as a parent, too. That oughta be more reason to not abandon your kids.</br>  <br>God damn that made me so pissed. fucking whatshisface too who guilt-tripped her.</br>  <br>The horrible writing and characterization of Shirobako is already 10 times more atrocious than the gore in Narutaru.</br>  <br>As a brother, i already feel terrible for reading that. Tomorrow I'm going to have to drive up to see my sisters, and tell them I love them.<br>I can't imagine how it would feel to be a parent reading this, haven't had the pleasure yet. But just the thought of this manga is terrifying</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  Everything else aside, which series had the better final fight? Zero's batcave brawl or UBW's temple showdown?<br><br><br> Shirou vs Gilgamesh <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F_5<wbr>Q0QDaH5w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NSg<wbr>XOZKSt20</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna say Zero, because even with all the magic time-stop and sword out of nowhere, it still felt a bit more grounded and intense. <br><br>Also, I didn't know the ending to Zero prior to watching it, so I guess it had more impact.</br></br></br>  I don't find the sword spam entertaining.  <br>In which fight? Both had it.</br>  <br>I'm sure you thought that was clever.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh. The only reason why /a/ doesn't like it was because they think too logically about the power levels.</br>  <br>No, I just through you were being unclear.</br>  <br>Do you think the degree of "sword spam" is equal in both scenes?</br>  <br>I'm going with Archer vs Shirou. I don't mind the changes from the VN.</br>  <br> magic time-stop <br>Are you stupid?</br></br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh was pretty much perfect.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh.<br><br>Swordspam fight is better than bulletspam fight.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, I didn't know the ending to Zero prior to watching it, so I guess it had more impact. <br>Secondary so fucking detected</br></br>  <br><br><br>lel, shiroufags are shit</br></br></br>  <br>Not in the anime</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh, how is this even a question? Better choreography, better animation, better action, not reusing a song we've heard in pretty much every battle in the series, and a much more satisfying resolution.</br>  <br><br/></br>  vs Gilgamesh &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shitty batcave fight &gt; vs Archer  <br>Zero. It was uninterrupted by dialogue, the combatants were evenly matched, tacticool, and as another anon said, it felt "grounded." When the fight consists of a swordspammer that quickly gets destroyed at close combat and a ninja ginger with no sense of weight in his movements, it gets boring fast.</br>  <br>the fight with EMIYA</br>  <br> It was uninterrupted by dialogue <br>I understand that you like ine more than the other, but that is a straight up lie. In Zero fight they were more inturrupted by dialogue and infodump, they even cut the fight like 5 times to focus on Saber and Berserker.<br>Also, both fights were about the same in tactical terms, the difference is that in UBW they mostly showed it.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean they didn't chat like faggots.</br>  <br>Zero's LN climax.</br>  <br>Kirei vs. Kerry. Gilgamesh spending most of the fight standing in place and exchanging swordspam like some fucking medieval Gundam SEED Destiny was fucking boring. It was only the final leg of the fight that was really entertaining.</br>  <br> I mean they didn't chat like faggots <br>Because IIRC in Fate/stay night Kirei told Shirou that they never spoke and tried to kill each other the very first time they met</br></br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry didn't even have Emiya playing <br><br>It's shit</br></br></br>  <br> Implying Shirou vs Gil was the final fight <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bi8<wbr>tcTFdYOM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>All of UBW's fights got butchered in the second season, Zero wins easily.</br>  Of all places, why did Kerry go straight to the batcave?  <br> Kirei vs Kerry <br> anime fight <br> fast as fuck <br> Emiya ost <br> slow as fuck <br>Are you retarded? Anime fight and Drama CD fight are different</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Batcave was way more entertaining.<br>None of it beats Prisma though.</br>  <br>It was better in the anime actually.</br>  <br> because even with all the magic time-stop and sword out of nowhere <br><br>did you even watch the first half of the show?</br></br></br>  <br>Zero. UBW was underwhelming. Also development until the scenes was better handled for Zero.</br>  <br> They actually came up with a great version of Emiya <br> for the audio drama <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8kq<wbr>ls64aYUs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I want a series of Rin beating people up with reinforcement and martial arts</br>  <br>F/Z anime was inspired by "The Dark Knight".<br><br>Looks like 2anime4me.</br></br></br>  <br>It's amazing that a magical girl spinoff has better fight scenes than the anime adaptions of the main series.</br>  <br>Just make a fast-paced Emiya remix then. Better than hearing the same theme that they used in all the fights.</br>  Fate/zero characters had weight to them and made us give a shit. F/SN stuff just can't match to it.  <br>This fight is way overrated. It really wasn't that great.</br>  <br>This fight is so overrated.

It's basic magic. I even have a reality marble.</br>  <br>They're not real people anon</br>  <br> Using strategy and several skills learned over a life time <br> Kiritsugu survives his heart being blown up thanks to a magic item he never knew how to properly use the whole series saving his life and only then realizes how to use avalon allowing him to win <br> Kirei was only as strong as he was thanks to someone killing his dad allowing him to get his fathers command seals <br>They all had some kind of power up compared to normal in that fight. Even Gil had a body that let him act without a master.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nanya &gt; Ryougi <br>disdain_for_plebs.jpg</br></br>  <br>The Gil vs Berserker dogfight wasn't even a real fight. They just cut to a few seconds of CGI models zipping through the air once or twice an episode. There's non continuity, it's a cool concept that was squandered as time filler while Saber hogged the attention again.</br>  <br>Command seals are neato and everything, but it's pretty sad that Kiritsugu was making full use of an EX-rank noble phantasm and still could only fight Kirei to a draw.</br>  <br> implying there's anything wrong with focusing on Seiba </br>  Did I miss some kind of scene that setup the batcave?<br><br>All I remember was them getting prepped to finish this bullshit then they just magically showed up at the batcave, which was under where the grail was, I guess.</br></br>  Fuck Shirou and Kerry, Kirei should have been the protagonist  <br>Well he can't actually use its noble phantasm ability of teleporting to fairyland, which is the EX part. Healing is nice but it's not something that crazy.</br>  <br> full use <br>He wasn't completely invulnerable</br></br>  <br>No they just appeared there, it was weird.</br>  <br>Aoki is a faggot, that's why.</br>  <br>That's about it. It was an abrupt and senseless transition into the basement of whatever building they were supposed to be in.</br>  <br>When Gil used Ea and it was countered with Avalon, was fairyland destroyed?</br>  <br>What do you think?</br>  <br>What</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Alright then.</br>  Man, the OST really was the best part of zero.<br><br>EMIYA is a great track and all, but the UBW soundtrack in general doesn't hold a candle to the stuff Kajiura put out for zero. It's really a shame they didn't have her handle UBWs ost as well, because it was underwhelming.</br></br>  <br>Yes, that's why Shirou has Avalon now, the fairies got pissed at Saber for getting fairyland destroyed and gave it to Shirou instead.<br><br>That's why he kills Gil, for revenge for the fairies.<br><br>You have to really read behind the lines to see this though, it's all very subtle japanese symbolism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zero was less visually impressive, but had more meaning and better choreography.<br><br>UBW was a blast to watch, but came off as generic shounen fighting with pewpewpew and Shirou turning servant level.</br></br></br>  <br>The OST in the last three episodes was great.</br>  <br>Kerry is a fairy?</br>  <br>Zero and UBW had a different approach with their fighting scene since the beginning. It's just a matter of taste, "grounded" or over-the-top. Both are great though.<br><br><br> Archer vs Shirou <br>Did they even fight? I can only remember they were chit chatting so much it feels like i'm reading the VN all over again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, all the signs were there.</br>  <br>Fairytsugu</br>  <br>They did fight, but it was very briefly. The overall symbolism behind the entire thing was great, but aside from Shirou's charge up the hill it was plagued with poor animation quality and terrible choreography.</br>  <br>Hey</br>  <br> Did they even fight? <br>Yes, with terrible animation.</br></br>  <br>Alright, now post the ufotable one</br>  <br>in the original sources ubw is better. but that doesnt matter to people here</br>  <br>No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good".<br>Shirou vs. Gil wins easily.</br></br>  <br>I legitimately don't understand why people keep posting this like it's the worst thing ever. It certainly doesn't look great but it's not terrible. It's more bad choreography choices than bad animation.</br>  <br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh is massively superior.</br>  <br><br>I feel like shirou fags are the same people who like bleach and think ichigo is a good character. Shirou is certainly one step ahead of bleach tier retardation but hes still well within the shallow end of the pool - like the entirety of the franchise that isn't zero.</br></br>  <br>Calm your tits, it will be fixed in the BDs</br>  <br> Shirou is obviously coming at me at full speed <br> Better stick out my arm so he can cut it off <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br>For something from Ufotable, that is by far the worst action sequence in any TM work they've made, and it's especially damning after coming from episode 20.</br>  <br>He was in the middle of pulling out Ea, Shirou was just too fast.</br>  <br>I feel like Kerry fags are the same people who like Naruto and think Sasuke is a good character. Kerry is certainly one step ahead of Naruto tier edgyness but he's still well within the emo end of personalities - like the entirety of Zero's cast.</br>  <br> Gil is as fast as Archer at full power <br> Archer can dodge Shirou at 1/10th power <br> Gil can't move his arm fast enough <br>People will defend this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil vs Shirou also has a meaning since it is both; a way to show that Shirou resolution isn't just talking, and it also deals with the whole "fake ideals" thing that was introduced since the beginning.</br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rQF<wbr>fMyxa04A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Its sad that you make such a comparison without realizing how dumb it is. Zero is the only part of this franchize with any depth. Look at the banquet of kings, bluebeard and fagboy talking about god, or any of the other fantastic dialogues (comparatively - lets keep it real here this is all shit overall). UBW and the rest of this franchise has nothing. Nothing at all.</br></br>  <br> No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good". <br>But going by that, anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good'.<br><br><br>Yeah, it's not bad. But honestly, it's really fucking bad compared to good fights like Saber vs Kojirou. People just focus on it because it's the climax of the route, yet had QUALITY.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is a reason why he is known as the king of jobbers.</br>  <br>I meant meaning more in the sense of the individual moves that they took.<br><br>For example, while Zero was plagued with narration and exposition, every hit and attack had something that the user wanted to achieve whether it be to set up the opponent for another attack, to disable their circuits, or to feint.<br><br>In UBW, it felt more like a generic shounen clash of swords, especially when Shirou was up close with Gilgamesh and both just stood in one spot swinging (lol). In general it looked fantastic, but I can't really give it an edge over Zero, which was more reserved but had more impact.</br></br></br></br></br>  UBW by a fucking landslide. Zero's final fight is extremely poor and it hides behind its "realism" to mask that it was clearly a halfassed rush-job. I was so excited to see Zero's climax animated and they fucking blew it. For me it is pretty comparable to some of DEEN's blunders. At least people recognized that DEEN was shit and we got to see some of their abortions fixed, Zero will never get that opportunity because people lapped up with fight like it was a greatest scene in the history of anime. Shirou vs Gilgamesh was a little too heavily on the acrobatics but at least it was a spectacle, it was a celebration of an iconic scene, not a desperate death wheeze of a show about to fall apart. <br><br>Aoki is westaboo who takes inspiration from Nolanverse Batman and Man of Steel of all things for his works. Zero was made by a taticool action movie normalfag for taticool action movie normalfags.<br><br>Miura may make questionable changes, but at least he is fan of the series. You can see the love he has for the characters in the episodes he directs. UBW was made by a fan for fans. Sadly up until the last few episodes people crucified him for the changes without recognizing all the good he did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou got stronger since then</br>  <br>Literally the day after?</br>   tfw it'll be years before we see Shirou vs Kotomine <br> FSN will have garnered more shitposting than SAO by that point </br>  <br>Does he get stronger from blood loss?</br>  <br> anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good'. <br>I read it and I liked the adaptation. They didn't have the Rho Aias blocking Ea bullshit, made UBW swordspam look like it should and they actually had Shirou use it unlike DEEN, they showed Gil's hesitation to use Ea in a clear but subtle enough way, nailed the dialogues and facial expressions, used Emiya (as Zero should have done) and, of course, animation was good.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't bother explaining it. People who don't like zero in favor of some other part of the series are the same types who prefer the star wars prequels over the original. They need to see yoda jump around with his dildo saber or its not coooool enough. The concept of some deeper meaning or actions having weight to them is lost to them.</br></br>  <br>Not even a full day, it's just been a few hours.</br>  <br>Probably Kirei one hand blocking Kiritsugu</br>  <br>I have no problem with people that like Zero more than UBW, but saying that Zero has more deep than UBW isn't true.<br>Shirou by himself has more depth than any character in Zero, with the exception of maybe Kotomine, that was originally from the VN anyway.</br></br>  <br>are you serious?</br>  <br>Ichigo sucks.<br><br>I tolerate Shirou because he has cool powers, and at least grows up to not be annoying, well a different kind of annoying anyway.<br><br>Shirou is alright in UBW, and Prisma, terrible in Fate, and may as well be a different character in HF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ufo sadly didn't do a good job at the beginning and the ending of Zero, while for UBW they nailed both of them. <br>UBW's climax wins by a big margin, having somewhat better animation, definitely better sound design and music, and as an adaptation of the original work.</br></br>  <br> Zero is the only part of this franchize with any depth <br>You can't be serious.<br>You may not have liked FSN but you can't deny it at least attempts to make some points.<br>Don't use "depth" to mean "things I liked". You're killing language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer the batcave. The UBW fight distracts me with no-aim-Gil and flying, no-need-for-swordspam Shirou.</br>  <br><br>He was getting combat experience from Archer, remember?<br><br>He couldn't fully utilize it against Archer because he was injured so much, but against Gil he was at full strength</br></br></br></br>  Man, I love shitposting in Fate threads.  <br> Look at the banquet of kings, bluebeard and fagboy talking about god, or any of the other fantastic dialogues (comparatively - lets keep it real here this is all shit overall). UBW and the rest of this franchise has nothing. <br>The banquet of kings is pretty much just Rider throwing a tantrum because he doesn't like Saber's wish, and the vast majority of what they discuss is extremely disconnected from how Rider wishes to save Saber, not to mention Gilgamesh just sits there and adds nothing to the conversation unlike how in Answer, Archer and Shirou's situation and words mirror Saber's own situation. Caster and Ryunosuke's discussions about god have less depth to them then the arguments about abortion you could claim HF makes.</br></br>  Most of the fights in UBW were trash. They tried to go for intense, over-the-top battles, but they ruined it with all that dialogue and monologue. Why the fuck do they do always do this? Unless the fight is at least a little grounded or strategic pausing the action for muh character development or to explain stuff will just make it shit.  <br>I hate it</br>  I think the main reason people are liking Kotomine vs Kirei besides it being built up over the course of the whole show is because it's also one of the only two good fight scenes in Zero.<br><br>Comparatively UBW had a bunch of good fight scenes so it harder to care as much about an individual one when there were so many more good fight scenes.</br></br>  <br>Maybe I'm bypassed by having read the LN and VN, but it looked just the opposite to me. I feel like Zero didn't transfer the original meaning while UBW did it.</br>   there are people who unironically think UBW had better fights than this. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6dC<wbr>FpPyrSIQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>IMO it completely missed the point of the VN and why UBW was better than GoB. ufotable usually does good with "show, don't tell", but here they had Gil explain literally every detail and Gil admitting after that UBW was instant-win... despite not showing it.<br><br>Shirou gets up in Gil's face thanks to UBW blocking some of GoB - okay, that's good.<br>Then he sits there and goes on a rant about why he's going to beat Gil and counter him. Then he disarms Gil through brute force... and they both stare at the sword in the sky without either making a move. Then Gil fires GoB at Shirou and Shirou forgets he has UBW to block it.<br>Then Shirou spends the rest of the fight running around with raw anus and deflecting more swords with his own two hands, pretty much forgetting that UBW exists before flying on Raw Anus to slice Gil's arm off. <br>It really gave the impression that Shirou won through raw skill and power and not really UBW.<br><br>In the VN, it was completely different. Shirou baits Gil into a melee fight and keeps him there. This is because in UBW, Shirou always pulls out swords *slightly* faster than Gil can while on the offense. This means he will always get the first hit in - this is important because each hit SHATTERS both of their NPs, meaning that Gil will never have time to properly defend himself since Shirou resets the situation with each swing. This forces Gil back in neverending defensive loop until he tries something new such as pulling out Ea and paying the price for it. <br><br>In the VN, it's less a case of Shirou winning through superhuman abilities and raw skill but more of smartly exploiting the one advantage UBW has over GoB. Shirou even says himself that if he lets Gil get even a moment's breath, Gil would destroy him in a duel like he did Saber. <br><br>So yeah, as a fan of the VN I can't accept ufotable's adaption if we're going solely by how faithful they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that <br> a fight </br></br>  <br>Man Rider sucks.<br><br>Even Shirou can dodge swords better then that.</br></br></br>  <br>Kerry vs. Kirei feels slow as fuck for a battle that is actually happening at a really fast pace.</br>  <br><br>Shirou had plot armor.<br>A ridiculous amount of it, while Rider didn't.</br></br></br>  <br> and they both stare at the sword in the sky without either making a move <br>God damn you autist it's just for dramatic effect it's like you've never watched any fight scene in any medium that has ever existed</br></br>  <br>And you read the bootleg translation of the novel.</br>  <br>Time alter</br>  <br> no-aim-Gil <br>In all seriousness, when has Gil ever really shown any competency in aim? He just spams shit and hopes it hits. Just look at his fight against Rider or Berserker in Zero. He just fires a bunch of shots in that general direction and hopes it kills someone.</br></br>  <br>The very fact that Shirou can disarm Gil is already far-fetched, considering both are just users.<br>The fact that not only does Shirou stop attacking at that point and he doesn't use UBW to counter sword spam is even sillier.<br><br>Like I said, it looks cool, but if you stop and examine the mechanics, it's just as you said - for dramatic effect. In the VN, every action had clear meaning on Shirou's part from the very first sword spam to the barrage of reckless swings he does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its probably better to spray numerous projectiles in a general direction than to pin point a specific area and shoot.</br>  <br>Shirou can replicate the skill of the original owner, Gil can't.</br>  <br>To be fair, thanks to the sheer number of NPs he doesn't need to aim.<br><br>What should be more of a problem with people is why Shirou has a clear shot at Gil in UBW, yet fires his swords around Gil's feet.</br></br></br>  <br>As far as action goes, that fight is pretty shitty.</br>  <br>Of all the shit Nasu comes up with, that one is the most bullshit.</br>  <br>But when he copies GIl's swords the original owner is Gil.</br>  <br>He uses the dust thrown up by the attack to get an opening and also block vision of Gil's GoB</br>  <br>Shirou isn't replicating the skill of the owner because he would've continued swinging and killed Gil after disarming him.</br>  <br>The monologues, slow motion and cuts to other stuff happen even when Time-Alter is not in use. <br>It would have been miles better if they went with a fast paced approach and made Time-Alter actually slow down the rhythm of the action.</br></br>  <br> He uses the dust thrown up by the attack to get an opening <br>Why? He had a clear shot right at Gil. Why not just shoot them at his head and be done with it instead of drawing out the fight?</br></br>  <br> it looks cool, but if you stop and examine the mechanics, it's just as you said - for dramatic effect. In the VN, every action had clear meaning <br>Because the VN isn't fucking animated.<br>You can't use the same standards for what a fight is supposed to show in a totally different medium.<br>Yes, sometimes things are going to happen for dramatic effect or just to look cool. If you can't deal with that you're going to hate the majority of all animated fight scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He almost cut Gil in half in the anime, and in the VN he was about to kill Gil before the grail interrupted and saved Gil from Shirou.</br>  <br>A lot of people complain that Shirou uses the swords he picks up too much in the anime, but it makes sense seeing as he runs out of mana right as he lands a fatal blow on Gilgamesh. Had he spammed more he might not have been able to hold the reality marble. He does counterspam enough but prefers to conserve mana throughout the fight.</br>  Why didn't Shirou just outspam Gil? Why did he have to get close in the first place?  <br>I'm assuming because he thought Gil would shoot down any blades that were coming towards him and if he missed and was able to press a tactical advantage it would be better.<br><br>He would have decapitated Gil right there if Gil was blindly swordspamming the smoke and was not armed and prepared for a close quarter fight</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh look people who still don't understand Shirou's character. At this point I'm considering if FSN is an "2deep4u" VN. If you can't understand FSN, just don't bother with actual literature. Ulysses will fry your small brains.<br><br>Then you have an idiot like who has to resort to buzzword because he just can't understand.<br><br>How the fuck do people not understand that Shirou doesn't have survivor's guilt or that the only reason he saves people is that he associates being happy with saving them. Of course it's a distorted way of thinking but that came from an empty being who lost his self in the fire and saw his soon to be foster father's happy face while saving him. This all you need to know to understand why Shirou wants to be seigi no mikata. He's essentially a good Kirei, where the latter associates being happy with making people suffer. Both have one way to be happy and thus try to maximize that cause for maximum effect.<br><br>There's also the figurative "Shirou is a sword" and his mantra which helps you visualize things more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't use the same standards <br>Anon, the original discussion is that the anime is different from the VN. Another anon said it was faithful and I'm saying it was completely changed. This isn't a bad thing, no one ever said it was, but you're blind if you can't see how the fight was fundamentally altered.<br><br><br> He almost cut Gil in half in the anime, <br>Like I said, if he really was channeling the owner's abilities, he would've continued swinging after disarming Gil. But they both kind of stopped and looked up to the sky. Either Shirou turns off his channeling of skill right then for no reason, or he never was channeling the owner's skill in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> can't recognize bait <br>This whole post is laughably pathetic.</br></br>  <br> Had he spammed more he might not have been able to hold the reality marble <br>That's not how UBW works. Projections are free once it's activated, and his prana is invested in keeping the RM up.<br>As long as UBW holds, Shirou can use all the projections he wants without paying for them.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the cost of swords in UBW goes down to nil, or pretty close to it. This is balanced by the fact that UBW is constantly draining prana every second.<br><br>Realistically speaking, there's no need for mana conservation in UBW since the swords are *already* there.</br></br></br>  <br>No it's not bait. Stop trying to save their face. Retards exist.</br>  <br> the original discussion is that the anime is different from the VN <br>Uh, what happened to <br> anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good' <br>I thought that was the basis of the discussion here, whether it was good.  acknowledged that the anime version was different in several ways, but said that they were changes for the better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It still costs mana to make swords fly around midair, does it not?</br>  <br>They didn't stop and look up dude. The scene was slowed down for dramatic effect.</br>  <br> Being a secondary <br>UBW gives free projections, no prana required. The only prana being consumed is for maintaining UBW. Technically, Shirou should've been going all out in spamming since he was on a time limit with unlimited projections.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that sword in the sky was Vajra or a similar weapon, activating it's ability forcing Shirou back.<br><br>What people don't get is that Shirou will block swordspam with melee if the swords are near him, it saves him the mana of levitating them into the GoB spam.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>One of those posts were mine and I was completely baiting.<br>I really don't care who you self-insert into, m8.</br></br>  <br> anyone who has read the VN can't call what ufo did with UBW's last fight 'good' <br><br>Go further back to <br> No one who has read the LN can call what Ufo did with Zero's last fight "good". <br>If we're talking about a topic of faithfulness of an adaption, neither were particularly true to their source, although UBW is even less so since the entire fight was changed.<br><br> but said that they were changes for the better. <br>I'll disagree for reasons stated in my big blog post . We can stop here if you disagree on a fundamental level, since it's opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its quite clear that he uses mana to shoot the swords at GoB.<br><br>Even if it's free to materialize the swords, it still takes mana to throw them.</br></br>  <br>I think you're mixing up replies, bro.<br>I'm the one who wrote this , and I've never replied to you until now. <br>Be aware that you're putting my words in another guy's mouth.<br>That's all, have a nice discussion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing ever even hints at that in any source material or CM, so no.<br><br><br> I'm pretty sure that sword in the sky was Vajra or a similar weapon, activating it's ability forcing Shirou back. <br>Yeah, that's about as much as I can rationalize it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that for the projections that are already UBW? The ones that he's copying from Gil should still cost mana.</br>  Guys they simply wanted a mix off sword spam counter spam, and Shirou slashing the swords away.<br><br>They did a nice even split and it looked nice.<br><br>That's all. Don't try and over think it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The way UBW works is that as soon as he 'downloads' something, it automatically appears in UBW. <br><br>The anime failed to explain it, but the big plot point is that UBW is his inner world. It's essentially his armoury that already has every weapon he's seen. Think of it as a spreadsheet that updates itself automatically as he adds new swords to it - no projections necessary.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Zeros easy, Fate stay night was felt like a bad fan fiction and shirou is a shit tier character.</br></br>  <br>Whether it's good shouldn't be solely tied to how faithful it is, I don't see how that became what this conversation had to be about.<br>Obsessing just over that seems like pedantry to me.</br></br>  <br>Not sure about that. <br>Once Shirou sees a sword it automatically gets stored in UBW, and since he already is inside UBW, it should just simply appear there on the ground.<br>It's not like Shirou is pulling anything outside the RM like when he does regular projections.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't something to take pride in</br>  <br><br><br>There is absolutely no indication that it costs Shirou anything to manipulate the swords inside Unlimited Blade Works<br>They literally fly into his hands of their own accord when he faces Gilgamesh.<br>Unlimited Blade Works is Shirou's own internal world that absolutely embodies his concept of "sword", it does not in any way have to abide by the normal rules of the world; it is a Reality Marble.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone unironically think UBW had better fights than Zero?<br>Seriously, Zero just does everything better than UBW except Shirou is easily better than Kerry.<br>No, the Visual Novel isn't better either.</br></br>  <br> No, the Visual Novel isn't better either. </br>  <br>u got me asshole</br>  <br>Fights between superhumans shouldn't feel grounded</br>  <br>The anime didn't really need to mention anything beyond the fact that his magic isn't creating weapons, but creating a world that houses infinite weapons. The second he creates that world, he has the infinite weapons at his disposal. For the actual confirmation on the mana cost for UBW, Archer's servant bio states that he can use his RM "without penalty." The main thing about Archer's attacks that cost mana are his use of broken phantams and projections outside of UBW, shields in particular being extra costly.</br>  <br>The first and second Archer vs Lancer fights were better than anything in Zero</br>  <br>Zero didn't have anything that special in terms of fights man.<br>Really, what are people referring to when they talk about the great fights? You've got batcave, the clusterfuck fight at the beginning, stupid jet shenanigans, Saber killing squids for three hours, the total non-fight that was Saber vs. Lancelot?</br></br>  Why doesn't Shirou just shoot every single sword he has stored in UBW at the same time at Gil?  <br> unironically </br>  <br>The Lancer fights, the Berserker fights and the final fight surpass everything Zero has to offer, at the very least on a technical quality perspective.</br>  <br> Oh crap, I was proven wrong better come up with something to save face on an anonymous board where no one knows me! <br> I was only pretended to act retarded, jokes on you! </br></br>   Same franchise <br> Same universe <br> Both are good <br> A lot of recurring characters <br><br>Why the fuck does it matter which one is 'better'?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kerry vs Kayneth was pretty good imo even if it was mostly just flashy effects and CGI.</br>  <br>I unironically like the VN and UBW adaptation more than Zero. <br>If you were more open-minded you will see that UBW had its fair amount of things that are better than Zero, like having a proper closure for example.<br>The fights are not even a joke, Zero has like two fights that can compare to to any UBW random fight.</br></br></br>  <br>While I'd say all of F/Z's fights were good, the only ones I'd put on the level of "this is amazing" were the two Berserker vs Gil scenes, Rider vs Gil, and Kiritsugu vs Kirei. They were the only ones I ever rewatched. Pretty much every fight in UBW were on the same level as these ones if not better like both Berserker fights, both Lancer vs Archer fights, the first Assassin vs Saber fight, Saber/Shirou/Rin vs Kuzuki/Caster, Archer vs Shirou, and Shirou vs Gil. UBW really blows F/Z out of the water in action scenes.</br>  <br>I was going to call you out but<br> at the very least on a technical quality perspective. <br>That's actually correct. Its smoother and has a more budget, but lacks in choreography and OST.<br>The fights were more inventive in Zero as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's essentially two warring fanbases within the same franchise here. One side hates the "secondaries" that started with the prequel and praise the "mature" characters for generally shallow reasons, and the other side hates the "traditionalist" if you will VNfags who try to tell people to read something they don't want to read. <br>Yes, it's all very silly and petty.</br></br>  <br>UBW's actual fighting &gt; Zero's slow-paced, dialogue-plagued, poorly adapted "fights".<br>Not to mention muh guns, muh magic motorcycle and muh ancient spaceships vs JETS.</br></br>  <br>/a/utism</br>  <br>UBW's climax is obviously better from a visual and animation standpoint, but I like the music at the start of F/Z's fight. Honestly I prefer F/Z's soundtrack a lot more than UBW's, it's much more memorable. I also prefer the former in terms of story.</br>  <br> Whether it's good shouldn't be solely tied to how faithful it is <br>Anon, just read the original posts for why we're even having this discussion. You're not contributing anything.</br></br>  <br> Berserker fights in UTW <br> Archer vs Shirou <br><br>Those were the worst. Even rider vs shirou in the 10 seconds were better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did OP upload the translated ones?</br>  <br>This.<br>I like UBW slightly more than Zero, but both are about the same level. If people stoped with the "Zero has more mature characters and meaningful themes because I say " and "the VN just because I say" everything will be better.</br></br>  <br>I'm just saying that the other anon misunderstood how UBW worked, claiming 'new' projections and firing them requires mana.<br><br>That is wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't lack in OST. <br>Zero's music was pre-arranged and repeated in several fighs, while UBW's OST was tailor made for each scene. <br>You may like Zero's chantingfest over UBW's more Hollywood-esque apporach on a personal level, but on a technical level, UBW's OST was better.</br></br></br>  <br>your*</br>  <br>It isn't so much a matter of which one is better, the difference is that pretty much everyone loves Fate/Zero while there's a decent amount of people that think FSN is irredeemable shit. If you look at most internet forums, the general consensus, even on places like reddit, is that the FSN VN as a whole is better than Zero but Zero is better than any single route. The same can be said of the anime adaptations since Zero just works better as an anime, but even then most people aren't rating the two as being all that much different in quality. Most people are just upset with how the second half of the show was generally handled.<br><br>If everything goes well, HF will probably end up being much better than UBW adaptation wise since it'll benefit from the movie format. HF will hopefully only have one slow movie for days 11-14.</br></br></br>  <br>It probably requires concentration to control the swords like that, and doing them all at once would be a huge strain if not impossible?</br>  <br> Does anyone unironically think UBW had better fights than Zero? <br>Yes. Excluding Berserker's antics most of Zero's fights were extremely boring. And more than that, the Servants felt like people with glowing weapons rather than beings above and beyond regular humans.</br></br>  <br> Berserker fights <br> bad <br>How?<br>It even had the best choroegraphy out of all of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And more than that, the Servants felt like people with glowing weapons rather than beings above and beyond regular humans. <br>Ironically, Zero conveyed that better than UBW, since half of UBW's servants were defeated by humans.</br></br>  <br> technical level <br><br>Is this a new meme word for objectively? OST can't be technically better, it's just a preference.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how you could not like the Berserker fights. Everything about Gil vs Berserker was perfect and Saber/Archer's battle against him was really great. I'm looking forward to how HF handles his two battles as well. Really hoping we actually get to hear Berserker say "Run" like in the VN.</br>  <br>HF true.<br>A case could be made for SLH though</br></br>  <br>Not him and I couldn't care less about anime OSTs, but he probably means that UBW's soundtrack has better production quality i.e. it is better technically.</br>  <br>Rider &amp; Gil against a perfect counter isn't half.</br>  <br>Reminder that DEEN OST was better.</br>  <br>Yes, music can be technical depending on how difficult it is to compose it or on how advanced is the equipment you have.</br>  <br>I read the VN but I also enjoyed Zero, although I think Zero is worse than the UBW anime and VN since it's not as good of a story in the first place, but the only thing I really hate is Zerobabbies. Also secondaries are annoying but only because they post stupid shit, not because they haven't read the VN.</br>  <br>Rider, Gil, and Saber.<br>Lancer was technically killed by a human.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Thx, m8.</br>  How people can prefer a spam fight between a studdent (with some plot armor) and a dumb when you have a cool fight between 2 natural ennemis who wants to confront them since the beginning ?  Prisma &gt; Carnival Phantasm &gt; Zero &gt; Tsukihime &gt; Kagetsu Tohya &gt; HF &gt; only Ilya's scenes in HA &gt; UBW adaptation &gt; Fate &gt; UBW  <br>Neither Saber nor Lancer were taken out fighting against a regular human.</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot Saber lost to Kuzuki.</br>  <br> Kirei vs Kerry anticlimatic QUALITY battle in the batcave <br> good </br></br>  <br>Dude no</br>  <br> KT <br> Better than anything <br><br>I can't count how many times I've fallen asleep while reading it</br></br></br></br>  <br>She "lost" to him in the sense that she got thrown across the room once, but she just got back up.<br>After that she would never lose to him again since she's seen his technique, which is why they had to run the fuck away.</br></br>  <br>What? KT is fucking hilarious; I loved it. I don't agree with the guy's rating, but how could you not find it loads of fun. Hell, Shiki actually has a personality in it.</br>  <br>Animation, OST and meaning behind the fight.<br><br> 2 natural enemies <br>They are not, they just thought they were.<br>Kirei realise it, and looses interest in Kerry by the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone use such a retarded fighting style? How do can such a retarded fighting style even exist?</br>  <br>Why did Kuzuki toss her across the room and not just snap her neck?</br>  <br>Because Kuzuki was supposed to just be a one-time assassin. Read F/HA. That being said, he could wreck most people despite being a one-trick pony.</br>  <br>Read the VN.<br><br><br>Kind of hard to snap a Servant's neck just like that. And she was getting kind of frisky with her sword.</br></br></br></br>  <br> snap her neck <br>That actually wouldn't kill a proper servant (it would kill Saber though since she has special circumstances). Caster likely told Kuzuki where servants can be killed (their spiritual core) and was probably trying to aim for that.</br></br>  <br> animation <br>Watch shiro flying during 10 minutes is not very entertaining .<br> OST  <br>that's your opinion<br> meaning behind the fight <br>i could miss somethig but shiro want to defeat gil just beacause gil want to kill humans ( or 99%)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this entire post </br>  <br>Did you actualy miss the whole "Fake vs. Original" thing?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>who are you quoting?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You.</br>  <br>He jumps two times, and the second looked great.<br> that's your opinion <br>Hearing full Emiya is far better than hearing Battle is to the Strong another time.<br> i could miss somethig but shiro want to defeat gil just beacause gil want to kill humans ( or 99%) <br>I'm talking about how the fight relates with the fake ideals Shirou have because their are not his but of Kerry. Also, it gives Shirou the chance to put his words in actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the second jump was actually retarded. Gil shot hundreds of swords and none of them hit Shirou. Seriously?</br>  I'm not underage so Zero. Kirei also happens to be the only great fate character so that plays a part too.  <br> I'm not underage so Zero. </br>  <br> Gil shot hundreds of swords and none of them hit Shirou. <br>Thats serious Gil for you. <br>See Rider vs Gil, he also shot hundreds of swords and like 4 actually connected with Rider.<br>If Shirou hadn't use Rho Aias, the result would have been the same.</br></br></br></br>   we will never get a series about Kiritsugu summoning Archer   <br>Yeah I'm not some 14 year old who still has delusions of being a hero. F/SN isn't bad but it's not great either, unless you're self inserting as Shirou.</br>  <br><br>How do these ESL retards sneak in here?</br></br>  <br> that's your opinion <br>No, it's my opinion.</br></br>  <br>Joke's on you, Kerry is a bigger manchild than Shirou.</br>  <br> UBW gives free projections, no prana required <br>If he will learn to utilize UBW on his own it should be fucking retarded against mages of his time.<br>Who of human opponents can even stand against a homing noble phantasm rain like this?</br></br></br>  <br> homing <br>based on what?<br>There's literaly 1 sword-arrow that we know is homing</br></br></br>  <br>Right but unlike Shirou he suffers for it. His ideals are clearly incorrect in-universe. Shirou is fucking high school girls and beating the king of heroes while acting like a child.</br>  Kuzuki vs. Kirei  <br>But Kerry is the immature kid with delusions of heroism.<br><br><br> His ideals are clearly incorrect in-universe <br>They are the same as Shirou's.<br>What do you think was the entire point or Archer?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm saying that in Zero the protagonist is a delusional moron and as a result everything fucks up. There's a clear message of "this guy is insane dont do that shit." In UBW the message is "this guy is insane but he's cool as fuck." It's a matter of how the insanity is presented.</br>  <br> Prisma &gt; <br> Tsukihime &gt; <br>I laugh at your shit taste, and possible brain damage.</br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>He literally was faced with his ideal being a fake. How the fuck is that not "suffering for it"? <br><br>That's like being told your entire life is fake. Do you think he just reacts to it with a casual "K."<br><br> There's a clear message of "this guy is insane dont do that shit." In UBW the message is "this guy is insane but he's cool as fuck." <br><br>Did we watch the same show? I doubt it. <br>The whole "Don't fucking do that shit or your whole life will be shit" was shoved into our faces.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm saying that in Zero the protagonist is a delusional moron and as a result everything fucks up. <br>You may see a difference in Shirou's and Kerrytugu's approach</br></br>  <br>The thing is kerry doesn't give a fuck about muh morals.

Who else will be joining me?<br><br>What is your favourite episode /a/?</br></br></br></br>  Have fun, I gotta go outside now.  <br>Nanako 13</br>  <br>I came here to post this</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br>Episode 8 was gr8<br><br>r8 nanako over 8</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>mfw when Nanako passes Pioneer 10 in space and the music starts playing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never forget.</br>  <br>Speaking of which, there's a thing that I've been asking myself ever since watching this episode.<br><br>Aparte is only 3 light months away from earth, right? Isn't that close enough to cause at least some trouble for our solar system and earth once it becomes a complete star?</br></br></br>  <br>Not an astrophysicist here, but I doubt any heat created by the new star would have negative effects.</br>    <br>What about no more night time or extra solar wind?</br>  <br>Again, not an astrophysicist<br><br>I'm not even sure light from that far away could make much of a difference to us</br></br></br>  <br>It's fairly further away from us than our sun, so it's affects wouldn't be as great. It would appear in the sky as a much smaller version of our sun.<br>Also as a young star, it won't be as bright or as big.<br>But who knows, maybe the oceans would boil without night time.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not an astrophysicist either but I believe that the gravity of Aparte may be a problem for earth. <br>There's been a a theory for decades now about a brown dwarf called Nemesis circling sun at a distance of 1.5 light years. It is supposed to cause mass extinction on earth every ~30 million years by directing asteroids into the center of the solar system with its gravity.<br><br>I don't know whether Aparte's mass and distance of 3 light months is enough to have similar effects.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The gravity would be the exact same, since it's the same mass. The only thing that changed is that Apate is now also making light. if their solar system works exactly like ours but with a dwarf planet, then Apate turning into a star won't change that.</br>  <br>I don't think it gains mass by becoming a star<br><br>And that thing about Nemesis sounds like something a foil-hat conspiracy theorist pulled out of his bum</br></br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it you're right, it's 20,000 times further, only 30 times larger than Jupiter (isn't that the minimum for a star?)  and just light up so it's radiation won't go past the value for moon brightness much less the value for a RGE.</br>  <br>It doesn't need to be much larger than Jupiter, it just needs enough mass to start the core collapse necessary to cause fusion.</br>  <br>I'm down for a marathon. Is someone going to stream it?</br>  <br> RGE <br>*runaway greenhouse effect</br></br>  <br>Rewatching, I feel so bad for Subaru now how no one wants to watch the meteor shower with her.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Yo<br><br>I tried this out in universe sandbox, with the hella rough estimates for distance and mass<br><br>If its accurate in comparison to the anime, then Apate would be about as bright as a brown dwarf. Hardly noticable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> 30 jupiters <br><br>SHIIIIIIIET that's massive</br></br></br>  <br> m=30 jupiters <br> gas giant <br> assuming sol metallicity </br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigga I dont know this science shit<br><br> What would you have me enter? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing, we could assume assumptions but that will only tell us it won't be as bright as the sun.</br>  <br>Make an earth and then just add a whole gas giant's atmosphere worth of hydrogen and helium</br>  It was a fun show, gainax put effort into this ;_;  Reminder  <br>What if they were sick since birth?</br>  Hoping the show will sell at least 2k copies    <br> anon in a not-so-distant-future pleiades thread </br>  <br>In a not so distant thread, Gainax will be no more. And when the light of Betelgeuse reaches the Earth, even Subaru will be no more. Pleiades will outlive them all, hopefully.</br>  <br>I can always make a wish upon Altair Vega in nine days.</br>  So, concerning Apathe:<br>http://www.space.com/28284-planet-x<wbr>-worlds-beyond-pluto.html</wbr></br>  <br> And that thing about Nemesis sounds like something a foil-hat conspiracy theorist pulled out of his bum <br>Most stars are believed to be binary and they have ways to measure the effects a brown dwarf would potentially have. I believed the theory developed for that very reason, to explain certain anomalies.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she comes across as a loner. :\</br>  <br>Saturn/Itsuki one, even though Itsuki is not even my favourite</br>  <br>4</br>  <br><br>Universe Sandbox guy here<br><br>Apate's distance in the anime was 3 lightmonths, which was MUCH farther away than any other solar objects. In the simulation, with a mass of 30 times the size of Jupiter, it had no effect on the orbits of any of the dwarf planets.<br><br>I will admit that we don't know the actual mass of Apate, so this whole thing is still up for debate</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I also don't know if its orbit was eccentric to a drastic degree</br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown<wbr>_dwarf<br><br>Try the simulation with 80 jupiter masses</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Starting</br>  <br>orbits before Apate was added</br>  <br>After one century of Apate</br>    Fuck what the fuck?

As in not being able to draw anything else other than CC?  I don't know, but I am thankful to have a constant stream of good quality art of my waifu  Well, there's always Mogudan...  Creayus is a hero who keeps C.C. alive in our hearts.  I dunno, but C.C. is the most dedicated and loyal waifu. Lulu earned that shit.  NEVER GONNA STOP    <br>That hand's not nearly noodly enough.</br>   I want to see what Creayus looks like in real life. I have a feeling she is attractive enough   This picture makes my heart doki more than her usual offerings for some reason    Wow he's still making art of her to this day? I would really like to see some more C.C., <br><br>Her and Lelouch really made the series, the Akihito bullshit is stupid as fuck and it better end up explaining where C.C. and Lelouch ended up going in the end to make happy little babies.</br></br>  <br>too bad a died a virgin eh</br>  <br>Hands, feet and pussy is excellent. Not a fatty.</br>    <br> died <br>Your bait is overdone anon.</br></br>    <br>not bait if it's the truth.<br>Meanwhile C.C is free to fuck whoever she wants. Suzaku might even be lucky whenever she gets horny only if he wears Zero outfit</br></br>  Lelouch and C.C. are the truest OTP.  <br> Suzaku might even be lucky whenever she gets horny only if he wears Zero outfit <br>She's a wanted fugitive though. She is 100% complicit in Lelouche's "crimes".</br></br>  <br> implying they won't do it secretly </br>  <br>Her face looked pretty good in that one cosplay pic she posted.</br>  <br> you will never live an immortal life with an immortal waifu who constantly teases you while desperately loving you to death at the same time </br>  nah, we've got ark for that with all his morrigan art<br><br>[no pic, google it. last time i posted any on this christian image board, though, it was a ban]</br></br>  <br> giving your waifu a larger chest than the one she has <br>We need feminism because of this.</br></br>  <br>Orange is also 100% complicit in Lelouche's crimes and he owns an orange farm with pink knight.</br>  <br>I dunno, but C.C. as my waifu makes me feel like i can take over the world. Guess this is how lulu felt.</br>  <br>That guy is still going? Damn, what a fucking champ. Truly dedicated to his waifu.</br>  <br> his <br>Her.</br></br>  <br>sugoi<br>I haven't fapped to rin in awhile<br><br> I think its time to bust a nut to this picture. </br></br></br></br>  <br> rin <br>sorry I ment rei</br></br>  <br>Does he even do shit anymore?<br><br>God tier artist but I feel like he hasn't done a doujin in years</br></br></br>  old game<br><br>Mai wear</br></br>  <br>CC is one of those anime heroines that just oozes sexual dominance. And there's nothing you can do that will ever surprise her.</br>  <br>I'd imagine that if you live as long as CC does, you get to see pretty much everything.</br>  <br> And there's nothing you can do that will ever surprise her. <br>That immortality isn't just for show, she probably invented most of the positions we use today</br></br>  <br>You just wonder what kind of kinky shit she did with Marianne and Charles.</br>  <br>Nah. Charles was VV's waifu</br>  <br>Her thumb...</br>  <br>vv loved chuck, but not the other way around</br>  <br>Why do Charles and his sons hate their Nii-sans?</br>  <br>...Is behind the rest of her hand. No problem there.</br>  What would sex with C.C. be like? Is sex even fun to her?  <br>Humping a pizza, all slippery like.</br>  <br>Does it still count if it is OC?<br><br><br>I love that dude's art.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Slippery sex is the best, no?</br>  <br>Ohh, I like this one.</br>  <br>Season 3 when?<br>Didn't anybody notice CC praying and giving Lelouch her immortality?</br></br>  <br>10th anniversary of Geass is next year and there are rumors about the announced movie in 2012 being a retelling of R2, but who knows.</br>    I want to marry the Creayus.  <br> wanting to chuck CC </br>  <br> implying Creayus isn't CC all the long just taking selfies </br>  <br> 10th anniversary of Geass is next year and there are rumors about the announced movie in 2012 being a retelling of R2, but who knows. <br><br>I think people shouldn't expect that since there is literally no information about that subject.</br></br></br>  <br>Anniversary of the series or anniversary of Lulu's death? I remember they did some memorial thing a year after Lelouch's death or so</br>  <br>If Lelouch is immortal he didn't get the code from her though.</br>  <br>The Geass series obviously</br>    In the six hour since I'e checked this thread, she's already posted three new images. What a lady.  <br>It wouldn't be surprising if it's just something like Suzaku's counterattack. An animation project of Oz or something would be cool</br>    Kallen &gt; C.C  <br>stop starting waifu war shit both are great</br>    <br><br>She's still an active character in the OVAs</br></br>          <br> the Akihito bullshit is stupid as fuck and it better end up explaining where C.C. and Lelouch ended up going in the end to make happy little babies. <br> Akito takes place before the events of R2 <br><br>Seriously Anon, even if you don't like it, it's easy to just read the fucking wiki.</br></br></br></br>         This thread <br>Man, I love creayus.</br>    She speaks pretty good English too.  <br>No, anon. That's Japanese.</br>  Creayus is CC after all.  i love this thread.      <br>We know you're here creayus, stop hiding already.</br>      <br><br>Wait, creayus is female?</br></br>  <br>Creayus is  C.C. </br>  <br><br>Why didn't they have her wear this outfit more in the show?</br></br>  <br>Now I want to see CC in a plug-suit...</br>  Speaking of dedication...  <br>Yeah, you can tell if you use translate on her twitter. She did a cosplay of pic related but it seems like she's deleted the image.</br>    <br>I... That is.... Well, um....<br><br>Fapping now.</br></br></br>      <br> Implying he didn't die <br>He clearly died, just like Charles died before the Code took effect and revived him.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone happen to have that one saved? It's gonna really bug me knowing it's the one image missing from my folder.</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gNh<wbr>yzoq4mxo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Lelouch lives.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First of all, that's fake.<br><br>Second of all did you even read what I said? I said Lelouch died like Charles did, before being revived by the code.</br></br></br>  <br> First of all, that's fake. <br>No.</br></br>   having a waifu who has canonically taken innumerable dicks, none of which were yours <br><br>How do you CCfags justify it?</br></br>    <br>It was confirmed to be fake.<br><br>First of all the art is shit and looks nothing like sunrise animation if you even bother to look at it.<br>Second of all it never aired in Japan.<br>Third it was confirmed to not be in any DVD/Blu-ray releases, which is where people said it was from or some shit after it was shown to have not aired in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  Only good thing about Akito  <br>Are you really falling for it?</br>  <br> Having a waifu who knows countless ways to pleasure you <br><br>I don't see the problem, really.</br></br></br>  New episode when? Was it not supposed to be released a couple of days ago?  <br> I was only pretending to be retarded </br>  <br> becoming you're waifu <br>Now that's doing it right.</br></br>  MORE PORN  <br>I fucking love the Alexander.</br>  <br>It's not bait.</br>    Creayus is amazing, but when you think about it, if anybody deserves eternal devotion and art, it's CC      <br> symmetry <br> black-white contrast <br>Simply the best.</br></br></br>    <br>Goddamnit <br> It looks like she's spreading shit out of her ass </br></br>    CC and Lulu is probably the best OTP of any series  (besides ichiruki )  <br>How can you say you love if you won't even eat her shit?</br>      <br>CC still enjoys the earthly pleasures so sex would probably still feel good. The fact that she can still regenerate means that she'll never get fucked to the point of boredom.</br>  <br>Does she regenerate her hymen everytime?</br>    <br>I don't know. It actually feels like if she didn't, I'd be feeling weird about it, like "What's wrong with this eternally hot 500 year old woman? Why the fuck is she a virgin? Something wrong with her?" kinda thing.</br>  <br>The dance seen with the shaking boobs was good too.</br>  <br>She probably no longer has a hymen. She had years of using the Love Me Geass until she got killed. I don't think she reverted back to her virgin self.</br>  <br><br>My first thought as well.</br></br>        <br>Actually I think the guy who posted the youtube video is just a summerfag.</br>  <br><br>I'm sure that's great and all if you ignore that her Geass destroyed her ability to love</br></br>  <br>I've always dreamed of what being Rei in Mogudans doujins would feel like.</br>  <br> her Geass destroyed her ability to love <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>Sorta.</br>  <br>Her Geass was all about getting loved by all. After so much love shown to her, she grew numb to that emotion.</br>    <br><br>until she met Lulu</br></br>  All this talk makes me really hope they got something planned after Akito    <br>Love isn't sex. Sex is a physical function of the body. You can enjoy sex even without love.</br>  <br><br> Literally an Asuka clone, not even a clone, IS ASUKA </br></br>    Lovely.  <br>Pretty much this. But I wouldn't want to meet with her batshit insane ex whom she only let to fuck her to manipulate him.</br>    <br>Pretty awesome this</br>     mfw there is no kallen only artists like creayus with CC       <br>He does covers for magazines.

If I want to start drawing her I'll probably should just use a pencil and paper at first anyway.</br>  <br> thinking drawing animu will be that easy <br>Aww, to be that young and cute!</br></br>  <br>She had a picture where you could see her face (cosplay of ) before she deleted it. She looked pretty cute, definitely not fat.</br>  <br>Goddamn, I thought that the artist being pretty was impossible. Anyone save the pic?</br>  Alright time to build my CC folder  <br>I actually used to when I was still in school but that was long ago but I always had a bit of a knack for drawing.</br>  <br>No pic, but it only showed some of her face and I'm sure it was photoshopped to hell. Not a good indicator of what she really looks like.</br>  <br>I asked the same thing earlier, I can't be the only person who insta-saves everything from her twitter. In case it helkps anyone narrow it down, she posted it between January 28 and February 16.</br>  <br>Don't forget the gangbang doujins!</br>  Why haven't you guys started drawing for you're waifu?

Seriously why was it so fucking good? I mean the fact it had lots of sol shenanigans was so good. Also it felt fresh that Main Villain wasn't a guy that wanted to take over the world but one that just wanted a peaceful life. Kira was a goddamn amazing Villain. I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain when you have a character like Kira who was clever, cunning, and intelligent as fuck. He felt more complex than Dio could ever be. The Stands were far more creative and dangerous than Part 3 too. Part 4 was so much better than Part 3.<br><br>I really want David Productions to animate the Italian Restaurant arc so bad now.

I usually say that's the point where shit gets really "bizarre". Instead of just a straight up shonen gauntlet<br>You should give the Rohan related spinoffs a read as well when you're finished.</br>  I loved the fact that Part 4 had a alien.  <br>I'll finish part 4 first then come back if this thread is still active.</br>  <br>I just finished reading Part 4 yesterday and the more I think about it, the more I dislike it. A lot of things were introduced but were never fleshed out. Josuke was introduced as having enough potential to make Jotaro back off, but he really only shows up half the time. Many characters are introduced and just hang around not doing anything. The crew aren't concerned about Kira or the Arrow as much as they should, so this part didn't have a strong main plot.  I actually just want more Part 1 and 2. <br><br>That said, what I liked was that when Josuke had his cool moments, he had them with style.</br></br></br>  Woah. It's almost as if there's a reason people tell animeonlys that Part 4 is excellent and to read the manga.  <br>Yeah it was alright, a shame  Reimi was a mega slut though. </br>  <br>he wasn't an alien, just a mentally challenged kid with great fashion sense</br>  <br>I think it's because there's nothing to "heal" there. Crazy Diamond can heal someone of their injuries, but something like Dio's cells going haywire would be a whole different level. It says CD can't heal diseases, so it might fall under that, too.</br>  Part 4 is really good, it's my second favorite part after 7. It's the first part where it feels like Araki knew what he wanted to do with the series, and it gains a feel totally unique. Josuke's great too.    Araki never managed to work in Josuke going back in time and saving himself.<br><br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>if he was an alien then his ability wouldn't have a stand name</br>  <br>My negro of comparable tastes. I think mid and late Part 4 was Araki's best art style as well.</br>  <br><br><br>it was intentionally ambiguous</br></br></br>  Who the fuck is Josefumi really with those shit ass eyes?  <br>I know it was meant to be ambiguous, but he's clearly a stand user<br><br>if he's an alien then he's related to the arrow meteor</br></br></br>  IF IT DOESN'T HAVE MICKEY, THAT SHIT AIN'T DISNEY!  <br>Just another mystery to add to the pile that have been introduced and still not solved for this part.</br>  <br>damn, that looks pretty damn good</br>  <br>Someone needs to compile a list of mysteries Araki has introduced but hasn't solved and ones we actually know by now.</br>  <br>He's the other half. It's said outright, isn't it?</br>  <br>I liked how you had this gang set up the whole way through. Instead of the plot starting up and the story saying "here are your allies, go fuck shit up," most of the enemies in Part IV ended up joining the gang. You had this buildup where the core Josuke-Jotaro-Koichi grew into a big movement of a bunch of stand users who were all tangled up in Kira's web.<br><br> Yukako best girl </br></br></br>  <br>If he's the other half, why aren't Jo2uke's eyes bright/dark instead of dark/darker?</br>  <br>I just adore late part 7. People cry sameface a lot, and maybe they're right, but it doesn't diminish the gorgeous art.</br>  <br><br>Koichi is the best girl</br></br>  <br>The color went to the other half of the fusion, that being the corpse that was identified as Kira.</br>  <br>Anyone have a screenshot of Kira's eyes?<br><br>I think i remember them being white, but I assumed that was because he was dead.<br><br>Whatever, I'll just take your word for it, makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I liked more Golden Wind &amp; Stone Ocean though</br>  <br>Just finished the manga, and they're right, especially in covers, Johnny and Gyro had the exact same fucking face<br><br>it was hilarious when Steel compared Lucy and the first lady as if you couldn't do that with every fucking character that part, clearly hot pants was behind this</br></br></br>  <br> liking part 5 <br>holy shit how is this even possible<br>it had the most hardcore and menacing stands, but that and bruno were the only good parts</br></br></br>  <br><br> not liking Mista </br></br>  <br>oh yeah I forgot about him, he was cool too, couldn't save the part tho</br>  How would you react if David responded to the "WHERE'S PART 4 TEASER" bitching and moaning by filling the blu-ray release of the Egypt arc with awkwardly spliced in scenes of Dio describing the Bow and Arrow in great detail, shots of Dio's baby sons, an unassuming white haired black man standing in the corner of every scene, and an entire extra episode devoted to babby shit-hair in the snowstorm?  <br> an entire extra episode devoted to babby shit-hair in the snowstorm? <br>wait, what is that?</br></br>  <br>Did you read Part 4?</br>  <br>oh you mean josuke, carry on<br>I didn't understand because his hair is perfect</br></br>  <br>so what happened to the invinsible baby</br>  <br> an unassuming white haired black man standing in the corner of every scene <br> It's official now that Gay Priest will never have a cameo in the SDC adaption <br> No Gay Priest animu until at least 2020. </br></br></br>  <br>Joseph adopted it</br>  <br>that baby grew up to be giorno, giving him yet more bullshit powers that don't get used, and making him even more of a mary sue<br><br>just making shit up, honestly invisibility is kind of a terrible power, so we'll never know</br></br></br>    Just finished Part VI and damn, I love Foo Fighters.  <br>He can fucking transform into shoes, though. How is that ambiguous?</br>  <br> reading it for jotaro <br>Hes one of the worst jojos though</br></br>  Am I the only one who got discouraged every time he checked the list of chapters and their names?<br> [STAND] PART 16 <br>It would instantly make me stop reading for a while, except for DIO and pretty much every fight in Part 4.<br><br>I'm struggling to finish Bohemian Rhapsody now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aliens could have transformation powers, too</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying; he's an alien. There's no doubt about that.</br>  <br>this late part 7 is best, part 8 has darker outlines and the art generally seems rougher</br>  <br>Well, there's also a stand that made Kenshiro come alive and terrorize Tokyo. It could be either, honestly.</br>  Can someone fucking explain Underworld to me?  There was a screenshot of some jap's twitter with anime-styled part four art, anyone have it? I'm assuming it's not legit.  <br>It's because part 8 has Ultra Jump scans while every other part has tank scans, and the scan quality itself varies wildly from chapter to chapter too.</br>  <br><br>It brings back the memories of the land it activates on irrc. The whole plane scene was making it reality and crashing Jolyne and everyone else in it. Or my loose interpretation of it.</br></br>  <br><br>So you could say that Versace was crashing the plane with no survivors?</br></br>  <br><br>That and using a football team to further the insanity of his stand.</br></br>  <br>It's a ruse by Doc.</br>  <br>I get what you mean but what's tank scans? like scanning the volume instead of the weekly release? or some online source?<br><br><br>well kind of like how certain things that you have bring about memories of certain things, underworld can pretty much use anything and bring back memories in evokes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Could Underworld re-enact 9/11?</br></br>  <br><br>Speaking of, how did Hermes use Kiss to hide both her and Jolyne in the bodies of the passengers who survived? I thought her stand only seperated shit with stickers, and when taken off it smashed shit together, hurting the person.</br></br>  <br>you have to wait for part 7 something like part 1 and 2 again<br><br>but it's worf the wait.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and some idiots took it for truth and spread it all over the place  I saw three posts about it on reddit, all 3 i'm going to assume got the info from tumblr or facebook </br>  <br><br>She doubled the passenger and she and Joleyne hid in the hollow between the two doubles and Joleyne stitched the doubles together with string<br><br>I think</br></br></br></br>  <br> like scanning the volume instead of the weekly release? <br>Well, monthly in this case, but yeah. By tank I meant tankobon.</br></br>  <br>something about that seems really iffy to me<br><br>then again I hated all of DIO's shitty sons and that stupid arc so who knows</br></br></br>  What the fuck was so dangerous about the snails that Weather Report made?  <br>if you touched one you became one</br>  <br>i see, my apologies i have never heard the term tankobon.<br><br><br>yes, and if it's anything like bohemian rhapsody then the whole world will see it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or just by looking at the sky/anywhere.<br><br>Pucci took out his sight during the battle to combat this.</br></br></br>  <br><br>that would be pretty cool actually</br></br>  Why didn't Underworld just bring King Crimson back? Or even Dio?  <br>it brought back a football player but all he did was make a catch, doubt it can bring people back fully just projections. plus i don't think he even knows about them<br><br><br>you can only defend against it if you're blind, which makes it almost impossible to fight against weather.<br><br>if you're fighting him and touch a snail you become a snail, if you touch a rainbow you explode into snails, and if you get caught in a reflection of extra bright light snails start growing on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, but what's wrong with being a snail?</br></br>  <br>well for starters there were tons of bugs eating people because of the ability, i doubt anyone wants to be eaten alive by insects.</br>  <br><br>I'd just use my stand to kill the bugs.</br></br>  <br> The rainbows even hypnotized the bugs <br>Whoa.</br></br>  <br>duh</br>  <br>you can't even figure out how an ability works by reading it in the manga, if you had a stand i'm sure you wouldn't get very far with it unless you were spoonfed. like the guy who had sky high</br>  <br><br>What if my Stand's ability was to kill all insects within a 10m radius of myself and it was an automatic Stand?</br></br>  <br>then your stand could get you a job, nice</br>  <br>kind of ironic that you said that, since sky high is kind of similar to that stand you just made up.</br>  <br><br>Do you think you could use Sky High's rods as dildos?<br><br>I mean, assuming they didn't suck your energy out.</br></br></br></br>  Which Stand would be most dangerous to have sex with?<br><br>What Stand would YOU want to fuck?</br></br>  <br>Purple Haze or the Hand<br>Spice Girl</br></br>  What would Jotaro think of Jonathan?  <br>tags<br>hermit purple:all the way through</br></br>  If C-Moon touched your dick, would it turn into a vagina?  Gay Priest is coming.  <br>Away you homosexual deviant!</br>  <br><br>Gay Priest is here.</br></br>  <br>But anon, Steel Beams are Unmeltable.</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Killer Queen did 9/11.</br></br>  <br>He couldn't see stands</br>  <br>Or he was just rusing.</br>  <br>he's clearly lying/delusional about being an alien, why can't he be that about seeing stands?</br>  <br> koichi <br> not tonio <br>shit taste 0/10</br></br></br>  <br>one of his many stand abilities is that he cannot see his or other stands, of course</br>  Flicking through Egypt BDv3 and there are hardly any fixes on the D'arby gambler episode, and they were quality as fuck.  <br> clearly <br>It's purposely left ambiguous.</br></br>   #ジョジョ4部脳内アニメスクショ大会 <br><br>There's some pretty good mock ups under this tag.</br></br>  I get so disgusted whenever some pleb says part 7 was better than part 4.<br><br>Like, really? It was basically a copy of part 2, if you boil everything down. Are people just really gay for cowboys or something? The added Dio fanservice at the end was honestly just insulting, if you're going to bring him back, at least make it a neat fight instead of "lol check out your head in this bag bro".<br><br>It's a decent part. Top 3. Is it just having an ending that doesn't suck or consist of a total deus ex machina for the first time since part 2? Because the journey is more important than the destination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the anime didn't use shitty photoshop texture filters</br>  <br>Pic related.<br><br>Your autism is showing.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone who finished part 7 this morning, part 4 and 7 were both really good but I liked 7 a lot because of<br><br> "rustic"/"cheap" stands instead of the constant sci-fi shit we had in part 6-5, obviously excluding mandom and D4C <br> za warudo tweest <br> a protagonist that doesn't mind killing people <br> great art (shame about sameface) <br> interesting characters <br> spin being a great counterpart to hamon <br> realism (somewhat) <br> actual character development <br><br>Part 4 is still probably my second favorite though, it has a few of the above plus a really good villain</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  is there an album or rar of all the inbetween chapter sketches?  I've finished reading part 7 yesterday.<br><br>What I can say is the Diego Brando is the best Dio.<br>I wish he had succeeded.</br></br></br>  <br> Josefumi Kujo goes into a seperate universe in part 8 <br> He was the Josuke that helped Josuke </br></br>  <br> no DIO for next parts <br><br>I'm still mad about that</br></br></br>  <br>That's stupid. You're stupid.</br>  <br>Josefumi is dead, anon.</br>  Why is Part 8 so terrible?  <br>You can find them all hosted here:<br> http://arakidoodles.com/all.html <br><br>Here's a zip with all of them too:<br> https://mega.co.nz/#!AQ5ACYTR!DZZ0<wbr>X3afF_D0JXcLtt3AKir6jeA9hs1SOxMLvZO<wbr>PObQ</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thankm8</br>  Why only 7 for part 2?  <br>Because that's how many Araki drew.</br>  <br>Is that the only reason?</br>  <br>araki ran out of toilet papper</br>  <br> Kira who was clever, cunning, and intelligent as fuck <br>Too bad he caused his own defeat multiple times.

Then they all play baseball.<br>Or it's a bunch of Alternate Reality versions...still playing baseball.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why he needs his own TP specialist.</br>  <br>Is anime at end of part3?<br>How do they slice it up?<br>Dio's kill</br></br></br>  <br> The manga has been out since the eighties <br> There are people who still haven't just went on Batoto and read it <br><br>I don't understand, Then again the lamest excuse i heard was "Lol its not moving so i can't get into it XDDDD".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not against reading, I love manga.<br>Why did it take them so long to animate though?</br></br>  <br><br>they did do the OVA back in the 90s or something. Then there was (or maybe before, idk) that terrible Phantom Blood movie thing which both araki and everybody else hated, so maybe people backed off from Jojo to be safe? I'm making shit up lol</br></br>  How did Kira even know what Bites the Dust could do if he can't remember anything about the loop? How did he even discover it? Did the arrow give him an instruction booklet or something?  The sol parts of Part 4 killed it for me. I mean if I want to read slice of life I read something like Bonnouji and if I want some le delinquent action I read something like Crows. <br>The balance between sol and stand action was so fucking ruined in DwK. Those who unironically liked it, I am sorry for your shit taste.</br>  <br>You mean Josuke.</br>  <br> reading it for autism: the jojo </br>  <br>Because Araki is awesome and refused many adaptations since they were doing a shitty job. You wanted JoJo adapted by Toei or Pierrot?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>The fact that he could see stands proves it wasn't a stand ability. He really was an alien.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's this guy? why he has a better hairstyle than Josuke?</br>  <br>nope i wasn't for it lol</br>  <br> he could see stands <br>Are you mentally challenged?</br></br>  anyone have the drawing of polnareff posing like this?  <br>oh that's his twin, Josoke</br>  <br>Part 4:<br> Guy who saved Josuke as a kid <br> ayylmao's identity <br><br>Part 5:<br> The gangster who Giorno didn't rat out (possibly Diavolo) <br> Fugo leaving <br> How KC officially works <br><br>Part 6:<br> Whether or not Pucci and DIO had sex  <br><br>Part 7:<br> Why Johnny kept Tusk after losing all corpse parts <br><br>Part 8:<br> pic related <br> gangster baby <br> Josuke's identity <br><br>Am I missing any?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> &gt;How KC officially works <br>KC works because it works</br></br>  <br> part 5 <br> Giorno's reflecting ability showed at the beginning <br>I don't consider fugo leaving a mistery since he simply didn't want to challenge Diavolo and chickened out.</br></br></br>  <br> Part 5 <br><br>mind refreshing me on the part on the gangter who Giorno didn't rat out?</br></br></br>  I still don't understand what the fuck happened to Bucciarati after he got Kakyoin'd by King Crimson.<br>What the fuck happened? Was he dead? He wasn't? His body was dead but his spirit wasn't? How the hell did he do that?</br>  <br>Ohh, that makes sense, since Josuke has his pupils too right?</br>  <br>Watch that be Josefumi</br>  <br>crack cocaine<br><br>Giorno resurrected him somehow, or at least healed his body and then Bucciarati's will was so strong that he was able to return to it or something idk but he became a zombie and KC eventually destroyd his body beyond repair so he died again&gt;?</br></br></br>  <br>Won't be that long.</br>  <br>fuck you lol</br>  <br>yeah i love that bitch too</br>  <br>Short attention span. You probably have dyslexia too.</br>  <br> browsing reddit unironically and pretending we'll let that shit pass if you put it in a spoiler <br>Even /a/ is dead</br></br>  <br>I heard they can have sex with anything they touch.</br>  Highway star needs an OVA budget  <br>yeah well i heard you fucked a frog</br>  <br> yfw it's all in CG </br>  <br> doesn't consist of a total deus ex machina <br> part 2 <br>did you forget the volcano that conveniently shot Kars into space?</br></br></br>  <br>So go back to .</br>  <br> part 2 <br> not deus ex machina: the series </br></br>  <br>Do we get first dibs if the stands become a reality? I'll take Stone Free.</br>  <br>I wouldn't even fucking care if it was CG by the dudes who did the 20 second opening they could make a 12 minute episode and I would nut all over the place. In fact not even the whole arc but just the scene with the baby and the motorcycle if that was done in CG from the guys who make the opening that should would be fucking amazing.</br>  <br> censored beetle lick <br>Even the gooks believe in sasuga david</br></br>  <br>then go back to reddit.</br>  <br> Jo-Jo <br>Man I've heard a lot of shit but this is brand new to me</br></br>  <br> part 5 is adapted <br> yfw Risotto vs Doppio </br></br>  <br>He made it</br>  <br><br>I meant *couldn't. fucking chill</br></br>  <br>I couldn't find the chapter when I tried looking for it but during Giorno's backstory it revealed that as a kid he saved a gangster who was being tracked down, so to repay him he started telling the people around him to respect him. There's a theory it's Diavolo.</br>  <br> Unbreakable <br>Isn't the right name for it 'Diamond is not Crash' ?</br></br>  <br> you now realize that with the cheap production of CG, they could make early adaptations of later parts right the fuck now </br>  <br>That was the duwang title. The series was always called Diamond wa kurenai or some shit like that in Japan.</br>  <br>Except you haven't meant it.</br>  <br>I fucking did. My argument only works with that correction dumbass.<br><br>What the fuck is wrong with this thread's quality?</br></br></br>  <br>Summer</br>  When I look at Abbacchio all I see is Sephiroth  <br>ESTUANS INTERIUS <br>IRA VEHEMENTI <br>ESTUANS INTERIUS <br>IRA VEHEMENTI <br> SEPHIROTH  <br> SEPHIROTH </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ohh now I remember, thanks!<br>pretty interesting theory. unfortunately there's not really any evidence pointing one way or another that I can think of, so in the end it's whether you want to believe it or not versus how ridiculous it sounds. I wonder what Araki would think of it</br></br>  What if D4C finds an alternate universe in which it's Za Warudo Dio Only Knows?  <br>You mean exactly what happened?</br>  <br> I see what you did there.</br>  <br>I dont get it</br>  Part 7 is terrible at least because this is a part in which at least 3 Dios died  <br>Dio = God in Italian</br>  Remember guys only one who is capable of tanking Tusk Act 4 is Diavolo as he is not part of his predictions thus cannot be affected by anything happening in the skipped time. Act 4 is bound to dimensions so it cannot chase Diavolo in the skipped time.  <br>Oh, I just didn't get the reference</br>  <br>TWGOK</br>  Semen. Semen. Semen, is she.<br>Semen. Semen. Semen, to me.</br>  <br>Was I seriously the only one who understood corpse parts only let you get an stand no matter what, but if you *earn* the stand then you get to keep it?</br>  <br>It makes sense I guess but it's ambiguous to me how Johnny earned his stand over Gyro. Did it have to do with Johnny being handicapped at all?</br>  <br> SO <br> everything in the solitary confinement ward <br>   c-moons ability is to censor upon contact </br></br></br>  Part 4 is just so comfy and fun. What compelled Araki go in that direction?  <br>He just wanted quiet life.</br>  <br><br>I figured he just had characters that went through a long journey going to Egypt, he wanted to do a story arc where things aren't as intense.<br><br>Half the time, reading part 4 felt like an SoL.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing about that always gets to me.<br>When the fuck was a US fighter pilot shot down by a Russian MIG over Florida?<br>Some kind of sekret Cuban skirmish, or something? Fuck if I know.</br></br></br>  <br>It only has an active range over Florida.<br><br> Besides, Diavolo would just die again. </br></br></br>  <br>Have you read Uzumaki, anon?</br>   5 JoJo threads in the catalog <br>Did DiU get confirmed or something?</br>  <br>New Chapter got translated.</br>  <br>Because they're all about something different in jojo</br>  <br>Koichi really visits reddit?<br>NO DIGNITY!!</br></br>  <br>The sad thing is that they really think all the "le go back to reddit" shit is just a dank meme or something, they seriously can't imagine anyone not browsing a piece of shit site that solely covers heavily filtered content.</br>  Okay I just finished part 4 and what the fuck was up with present day Josuke saving himself and his mother in the past during the snowstorm.<br><br>I figured some shit was going to happen during his fight with Kira where either he literally 'fixed' the universe to go back or Bites the Dust would cause time travel shenanigans but it just never got adressed.<br><br>What gives?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally only getting your information about reddit from 4chan. </br>  <br> literally understanding less about the site you spend most of your day on than someone who never goes there <br>As expected from Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Oh boohoo they got rid of hate subreddits boohoo. Who the fuck cares? I go to reddit for discussions about certain interests, news, and for porn</br>  <br>Probably Araki originally had a plan that Kira went back in time to kill Josuke or set up killing him and Josuke got caught in it as well and saved himself. Then Araki went fuck it and ran Kira over with a ruck.</br>  <br>Sounds like some other time travel movie I've heard before.</br>  <br>If they ever make a part 4 anime this is the one thing I'd be okay with them changing.<br><br>Even something like  suggested would be better than what we got.</br></br></br>  <br>This is exactly what I was talking about. So utterly clueless that he can't imagine anyone not using Reddit.<br><br>It's a piece of shit site. I don't give a fuck about some "hate subreddit" bullshit, what matters is that all the content is heavily policed and filtered so only the most popular opinions are ever seen.<br><br>The fact that you actively want other people to police your thoughts under the guise of convenience means you are totally ill-suited to browse a site built designed around freedoms. You cannot even comprehend the concept of the word "freedom". There is no reason for you to be here aside from jerking off over how much of an epic troll you are for pretending to be retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  How many viagra pills Joseph had to take in order to impregnate Josuke's mom?  <br>Why can't you guys accept that it's just random high schooler with a huge pompadour that just wanted to help someone? Instead, you just insert these time travel plots.</br>  <br> I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain <br>because hes a likable jerk<br><br> Seriously why was it so fucking good <br>the SoL format make the fights seems less fillers<br>Kira is the best vilain beside part 7 vilain<br>josuke was a total bro and the whole cast was hilarious<br>jotaro works better as a mentor<br>it has the best art by far in the whole serie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the funniest thing i've read today. I can't take you seriously when you're basing this all from the shit you've read on 4chan and have never used it yourself. You can actually go to /new/ and see the newest posts that have been made regardless of the amount of votes.</br>  <br>thats great whoever made this</br>  <br>why is jojo so quotable</br>  <br>Because he's literally drawn the same as Josuke, is extremely mysterious, and the way he was inserted into the story heavily indicates later importance - it being never adressed again is just a shit payoff for what looked to be foreshadowing for something big.</br>  <br>Wow, one board has enough mods to offer such a basic feature.<br><br>Of course, you aren't actually seeing the newest posts. Anything that is particularly hated by the constant moderation team will be deleted before it even gets added to the "newest" pile.</br></br></br>  <br>After reading about the alien, do you expect any more?</br>  <br>It's pretty clearly just a storyline that Araki decided not to bother with.</br>  <br>I completely agree, but it was still a shit payoff.</br>  <br>I'm totally sick of pre-destination timetravel shit. It's better without it.</br>  <br>I just saw flashbacks as a nice explanation as to why Josuke gets pissed when you insult his hair. Nothing more than that.</br>  <br> the constant moderation team will be deleted <br>Are you literally this retarded? You don't know shit about reddit. I would suggest actually try it for about a week or two but i'm guessing you'll go on it and not even attempt to search and explore other subreddits and call it shit.</br></br>    <br>I hate to break it to you but while yes pages will get deleted by moderators. When sorting by new you just see the most recent things. This is not the default though and most posts are ignored or downvoted because people disagree so most people will never see them. Filters can also prevent shit I'm sure but that is probably about the same as a word filter.<br><br>This is why reddit is fucking shit. Took 15 minutes of using the site to figure this out. At least say why it is shit for the right reasons.</br></br></br>   Japan loves the Assassination Squad a lot to the point where even Pesci gets love. <br> Nobody in the West gives a damn except for the fights they were in. </br>    <br><br>10/10</br></br>    <br>New isn't on by default because that's not the general point of reddit. It's supposed to bring you "the best content" by using some kind of algorithm by amount of votes plus how recent the post is or something.</br>  <br>Precisely why reddit is trash. Just because "new" exists doesn't mean it is widely used.</br>  Why did part 7 have Dio win only to lose anyways because of a dirty trick? Just to prove that time-stop really is the strongest stand power after Jotaro proved himself king of jobbers in part 6?  <br>If new wasn't used that much than nobody would vote on posts and those posts wouldn't get to the front page.</br>  <br>You forget that comments work the same way which is another large issue. Unpopular comments are downvoted immediately. This means they have less visibility to most users.</br>    <br>True but you actually can filter comments by oldest, newes, or even controversial (comments that have a near equal amount of downvotes and upvotes.<br><br>I don't think they'll let you sort by comments or posts with the most downvotes because that might encourage people to downvote those posts even more than they already are. In a way you could say that downvoted comments or posts having less visibility is good because if they were more visible then people would just downvote them even more</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't Josuke.

Whitesnake is a dick.</br>  Is there any Jojo character sexier than Mountain Tim?  Does /a/ like NTR?  I like everything as long as the art is good.  I love it for a variety of reasons... in theory.<br><br>In practice almost no one has the balls to make a proper NTR that actually builds emotional investment in the reader by starting as vanilla.<br><br>But man, considering how popular it seems to be, it's really weird that more haremshit eromanga don't have at least one heroine NTRed away from the protagonist.</br></br></br></br>  I like anything as long as the boys are good.  I like everything as long as the cocks are detailed and there's plenty of cross-section images and hefty amounts of semen.  I wouldn't mind if it weren't for the disgusting fat hairy old men.  Most NTR dumbs down the characters too much for me to rage. But yes, I do enjoy some NTR once in a while.  Absolutely patrician taste.  I don't care much about NTR, if it's hot I'll fap to it and that's it.<br><br>I like humiliation, and since most NTR are tied to the girl being degraded it's boner fuel, but I don't care about cheating or all that stuff,  I always selfinsert as the girl .</br></br>  Generally yes.  <br> In practice almost no one has the balls to make a proper NTR that actually builds emotional investment in the reader by starting as vanilla. <br>Look at this anon talking out of his ass.<br><br>You should read more of Seme Danjous stuff.</br></br></br></br>  Depends on the scenario. Most are just pure shit.  <br>I wish I could read moonrune anon. But then again most of seme's works arent scanned  at least on panda </br>  I like cheating when it's about women becoming slaves to the D, but NTR is designed around humiliating the male, and that's just a complete turn off.<br><br>It doesn't help that NTR is bottom of the barrel in terms of writing. It's hilariously bad even by hentai standards.</br></br>  NTR and cheating are the only things I fap to, so I suppose so.<br><br>I just get off much easier when I see women, especially milfs with children, being sluts and cheating, fucking other guys while wearing wedding bands and things. Even better if the husband ISN'T on a perpetual business trip and she still acts all lovey dovey with him. NTR impregnation and the woman passing it off as her husband's child is the most satisfying ending to an NTR story for me, especially if it also includes pregnant sex. <br><br>That being said, pregnant sex where it is the husband's child but a stranger is fucking her while she's carrying is THE ultimate turn on for me. Sure, the husband technically wins since it is in fact his child, but part of me thinks "When that child is born, their mother will have had sex with a man that isn't their father while heavily pregnant behind their father's back, what a slut" and other things like that, which further fuels my boner.<br><br>What's also good is when a milf goes into love hotels with another guy, but that doesn't really happen as often as I'd like. It happened in that one film, Colorful, which got me hard as fuck.<br><br>A few of my favourites are (I don't know if panda links are allowed outside panda threads)<br>http://exhentai.org/g/753523/5c197a<wbr>b7a8/ (just the first parts)<br>http://exhentai.org/g/785414/5318e1<wbr>4775/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824191/bb6874<wbr>cf72/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/717541/d6452b<wbr>4182/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/431968/0a4595<wbr>4112/ (the entire series is nice)<br>There are too many to links to post for this but the Ane/Kaya-nee series from Kon-Kit<br>A lot of Aoi Hitori's works<br>http://exhentai.org/g/623373/20e153<wbr>c8e5/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/800587/466688<wbr>daa7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/777058/5fd155<wbr>af84/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/798801/b2b450<wbr>2225/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/822389/56308c<wbr>70fb/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/824799/fece8e<wbr>37ae/<br>Most Takasugi Kou works (helps that I have somehwat of an oedipus complex)<br>Netoraserare is quite good in my opinion too</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Character limit reached, but my obsession with cheating and NTR has gotten to the point that I can't help but see it in nearly every anime I watch these days. Whenever there's a mother that's going out, or the MC leaves the house and his mother's alone I can't help but think "It'd be so hot if she calls over her fuckbuddy and has messy, sloppy sex while he's out", and I always automatically assume, and hope for, a twist where the MC finds out his wife/his mother/girlfriend is cheating. NTR and cheating has taken hold of my life and I can't stop fapping.</br>  Hana hook has some good stuffs.

Anyway, it was about some guy whose wife had a slut sister who wanted to fuck him, so she blackmailed the wife into getting fucked by some boyfriend while she tricked the husband into fucking her by posing as the wife. And then of course the wife ends up mindbroken and the bitch sister ends up pregnant, and the husband comes home every day to see his wife get fucked by the boyfriend in their apartment.</br>  <br> furry tier <br>Its way lower than furry to me.

There was this NTR anime where this kid was bullied at school by some douchebag, the mother fucked the guy in return he would stop bullying her son.<br><br>In the end she succumbed to his dick and became his cumbucket, she left her son alone at home and became a public toilet and was never seen again aside on the internet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's stupid. <br>People who are into that sort of thing use the difference in skin colour as an easy way to represent 'othering'<br>white is 'us', black is 'other.<br>The girl is white, so she's 'mine'<br>The man is black, so he's 'other'<br>The 'other' is taking whats mine for himself and I'm powerless to stop it. What's more, the 'other' is a pornstar, well-built and attractive with a big dick, and "I'm" just an average guy, the difference in desirability and masculinity is clear and divided along that coloured line of self vs other.<br><br>What they really want is for things to be taken from them by someone else, and for that loss to be a narrative of 'losing out' to a stronger or more desirable male. Porn provides plenty of men bigger and stronger and more attractive that your average cuck, but if they're not different enough, they don't get the feeling that it's "other". Colour is an easy way of making someone seem different and alien from you.<br><br>Actual cuckolding porn is rare, so most just project their fantasy narrative onto anything remotely compatible. Interracial is ripe for it because people insecure about their masculinity, like masochist male-subs tend to be, are also insecure about their race and goddamn everything else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/818738/957037<wbr>77cc/</wbr>  <br> that's disgusting too <br>Your racism is showing.</br></br>  <br> A slut getting NTR'd doesn't have the same impact. <br>Seems like someone didn't read Chains of Lust or Kuros Aphrodisiac/Counterattack</br></br>  <br> Interracial is ripe for it because people insecure about their masculinity <br>Could be, but Ive also read about theories on how it could be an STD, as that kind of behavior would have been selected out due to evolution.</br></br>    <br>Dont be an idiot, faggot cuck.

Netorare and Netori <br><br>Netorare: A sexual fetish designed to cause sexual jealousy by way of having the heroine indulge in sexual activity with someone other as the protagonist (Usually the player character)<br><br>For a game/manga/anime to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:<br>1. The heroine either must be romantically involved with the protagonist, a potential romance for him or of someone that the protagonist shares such a close relationship (sister, mother, childhood friend etc.) that jealousy is a factor.<br><br>2. Related sexual events are explicitly shown to the player or later described in detail.<br><br>There 3 types of Netorare:<br><br>Type A: The heroine is willingly cheating on the protagonist with another guy and enjoys every second of it. No rape, blackmail, drugs etc. involved, it's consensual sex from the very beginning.<br><br>Type B: Initially, the heroine is raped, blackmailed, drugged or otherwise tricked to have sex with someone other than the protagonist. However, she eventually starts enjoying it and the sex becomes fully consensual in the end.<br><br>Type C: The heroine is raped in front of the protagonist and he can only helplessly watch it. It's non-consensual from start to finish.<br><br>Netori: Netori are games/manga/anime where the protagonist steals the lover or wife/husband of someone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /v/ <br>Get out.<br><br>And I meant *hentai tags, imbecile.</br></br></br></br>  <br> bitches who give in to NTR are categorically terrible <br>but you are wrong anon</br></br>  <br>Incorrect.

It's not like I'm really interested anyways, I already got my fill with that one where the sister fucks her brother while he's on the phone with his gf.

It wasn’t until recently that they realized that they had feelings for each other that were much more than friends. While working in a PC Software company as a salesman, Kensuke is told to work at another branch due to a shortage of manpower. The big catch here is that he won’t be able to live at his apartment anymore so that he can easily commute to his new job.<br><br>That being said, he won’t be able to see Ayumu for a very long time, but she’s been sweet enough to watch over his apartment while he’s gone. Well, you know what they say about long distance relationships; after a good amount of time has passed, Kensuke is in a mixture of loneliness and paranoia. He’s missing Ayumu, but also doubting why a woman like her would stick around for a guy like him. To add more confusion to the fire he’s come across four women around his new work that give him more temptation that he can bare.<br><br>Will our hero hold out for love, or will he give into the pressures?<br><br><br>OK Type A Netorare, Protagonist has to move to another city because of work reasons. So he and his girlfriend begins a long distance relationship, where BOTH sides can cheat each other with different people (Males on her side, females on his side). <br><br>You begin following the MC (Male) shoes, as he moves to another city, then it changes the perspective to his girlfriend. You need to do decisions on both sides to progress. <br><br>A happy ending is achieved when both don't cheat with anyone, make frequent contact with each other by phone calls and always go see each other on holidays</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your entire world must be fucking screwed if you interpret that as "falling in love". Holy shit anon, you are actually trying to fun of me right now aren't you:?</br>  I love it when the girl who obviously loves the guy starts getting gangbanged for the sake of the above mentioned guy with a sloppy but happy smile on her face. <br><br>Even if the blackmail plot is utter retarded there's still something primal and exciting about a girl getting corrupted like that, howling as big, fat and juicy cocks pummel her uterus.</br></br>  <br> No one would get baited by Tanaka Aji or Carn anymore <br><br>I'm sure there are those that still gets baited by Carn. Just look at the "ITT Post happy families" threads and they put Otomedori ending in there and people asking for sauce</br></br></br>  I like NTR, but not to masturbate, and never when it involves faceless fat men or macho black guys.<br><br>But when a girl gets stolen away from one guy to another guy with proper emotional build up and none of that "His dick is hitting my womb! Takumi-kun could never reach that far in!" I think it really makes for great stories.<br><br>That being said. NTR will never be taken seriously because the people who like it are scum among scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Ops, i think this is not translated, NVM then. I dunno, go look around.</br></br></br>  <br> But when a girl gets stolen away from one guy to another guy with proper emotional build up and none of that "His dick is hitting my womb! Takumi-kun could never reach that far in!" I think it really makes for great stories. <br>Got any examples for such stories?</br></br>  <br>No, I just read it last night.<br><br>They surrendered way more than their bodies, and the guys as well didn't cared about their old video recording practices anymore. Just feeling good with each other.</br></br></br>  <br>Interpreting that as falling in love is stupid. They just went with the flow and wanted a good dicking, nothing more. They broke off all contact with them.</br>  <br>The only people who hate NTR are beta virgins. See ITT betas calling it shit taste.<br>Everyone else loves it for schadenfreude or voyeurism.</br></br>  <br>They didn't broke contact at all.<br>Orgy was 6 months later and pregnancy 1 year later. <br>They meet once per week at least, are we reading the same thing?</br></br></br>  You do know that reaching too deep with a dick inside a real woman hurts like hell right? You know women don't cum immediately when you stick it in them? You know there's no stupid ahegao, right? You know no actual woman screams "YOU'RE HITTING MY WOMB!

Whenever there's a girl that could be romantically or sexually interested in the MC, I can't help but think "It'd be so hot if she seduces him, or he seduces her and they have messy, sloppy, loving sex.", and I always automatically assume, and hope for, a twist where the MC finds out about his female friends feelings and goes beyond hand holding and kissing.

No idea why I read the whole thing.  <br>Yeah. Damn.</br>  <br>Wasn't the prequel of it the delinquent falling in love with his older sister and fucking her but eventually ended up leaving and marrying to some doctor/rich guy to support him?</br>  I remember reading a h-manga about some guy who hooks up with an esper girl in his school, but she gets brainwashed by two guys with superpowered glasses or something, and then they fuck her until MC shows up to snap her out of it. I wish I could remember the title, because I recall the art was actually good even if it looked obviously traced.  <br>Yeah, except she married because she got pregnant and not to support him. She was a slut who slept around a lot, and then she got married with the first guy to get her pregnant.</br>  <br>I don't think she marry to support him, (I mean she might have) but I think the main reason was that she got pregnant. I think though the worst part, of that chapter is the fact that the sister would have stayed had he asked her to stay, but he didn't say anything.</br>  <br>There was another story which was similar, also from Yuzuki N, I think the MC in that one was in the Karate Club.</br>  For a change, i'm gonna talk about a NTR (Netori) Game.<br><br>Immoral Sisters IV (愛姉妹IV )<br><br>You play as a 28 year unemployed guy.

At least then they'd have a competent editor.</br></br></br>  <br>Zoid is actually competent with Japanese. He has also said that he'll use honorifics, leave cultural references in tact unless there's an actual translation for them as opposed to the "funny" localizations Commie comes up with, and he won't insert meme jokes.<br><br>The guy is a real Symphogear fan. I've seen his translations of the keywords and stuff and I've read the moon myself. He's good.<br><br>The only mouth breathers who think Commie is good are the idiots who think that "If you're not localizing the shit out of everything you're not actually translating!" whereas Zoid is translating with his actual audience in mind, knowing that the people who watch Symphogear are weebs who've read up on the lore and don't need everything watered down and filtered for them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He has also said that he'll use honorifics, leave cultural references in tact <br><br>Oh boy, will he also use TL notes? <br>I'm glad he'll do this, but it's hilarious how you can actually praise such stupidity.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wanting memesubs and the shitty following that comes with it in these threads </br>  <br> implying Commie didn't seriously mess up a lot of the translations and enjoyed holding back subs just to make us wait. <br><br>I have more trust in Zoid for giving an honest effort when it comes to translation. The typesetting though is a different story going from the PV...</br></br></br>  <br>Competent in Japanese doesn't mean competent in English.<br><br>And I know Zoid, I've been following him since he started translating the manga. Though I don't quite agree with him on most point and think that he definitely needs a good editor (like most TLs) I think he's okay for this.<br><br><br>Because S1 threads were fucking a load of shitposting and a shipping bonanza like these threads are nowadays right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but it's hilarious how you can actually praise such stupidity. <br> TL notes <br> bad <br>Open a fucking book you moron. <br>http://www.shakespearedefined.com/<br><br>If you think "real" translators localize shit the same way Commie does, you're out of your fucking mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy already said he'd fix the spacing to the bottom and not use bright colors next time.</br>  There's a good chance Funi will pick up S3 either way.  <br>They said they wouldn't, but added that if they have the time they might make separate sub tracks for that kind of thing, among other ideas.</br>  <br>And I will kill myself if that happens</br>  <br> He has also said that he'll use honorifics, leave cultural references in tact <br> This is a bad thing? <br>How would you prefer they do it? Commie-style memesubs?</br></br></br>  <br>Funisubs would be worse than Commie.</br>  <br> already contemplating 2 sub tracks <br>They will barely be able to sub the episode, let alone do anything extra.</br></br>  <br>This is why fansubs exist.</br>  <br>Oh god no. If they do I hope they delay it a week like with NicoNico for S1 so it gives us chance for anything that isn't FUNi to get released first.</br>  Get hype.  <br>Knowing how much zoid loves to reference the keywords, if he feels like its important enough he'll probably try to fit TL notes in one way or another.

It's just a group of some volunteers from /m/ so it's not like anyone is expecting exceptional fansub quality anyway.</br>  <br>They straight up say superb song in English in the show</br>  <br>Check your ears, she said "SUPAKU SONGU", in other words, "Spark Song".</br>  <br>Absolutely.<br><br>Underwater, GotWoot and FFF failed spectacularly during the first season.<br><br><br>He was, prior to a year ago, the most prolific translator on the scene.

I hate it when karaoke's on the screen during the actual show.  <br>It's in the dictionary.</br>  <br>This is anecdotal, but I have friends who work solo and try to maintain a low profile who do some translation work. They're people who are fluent in both languages and can actually write translations without stupid memes.

Literal, awkward translations are bad, and meme translations are awful. Watch:<br><br>燃え尽きそうな空に歌は響き、 明日を輝かす種火となる。<br>"There is a song that stirs in the sky that's burnt out. It will be an ember that brightens tomorrow." <br>That's literal, but reads stiff. That's bad.<br><br>"A resounding ballad shakes the charred sky above. From within, a spark is born that shall shine onto the future."<br>Sounds prettier, but it's too far off the original and uses needless word substitution and lets the translators voice bleed in too much. This is the kind of shit commie does that people don't like, and the more you do it the more it can lead to inconsistencies later on because they decide to reword things that actually have plot relevance later on. They also butcher jokes. Essentially, it's some amateur translator trying to assert their creative writing skills when people just want a fucking translation.<br><br>"Amidst the scorched skies a song cries out. It becomes the ember that illuminates tomorrow."<br>This uses the original verbiage, keeps things in the right order, doesn't add any new or unnecessary ideas, and is still written in roughly equally "poetic" prose. This is the medium people should aim for. It keeps everything in tact and won't present any problems down the line if any of these ideas should return later on to play an important role.<br><br><br>The problem is most people are either good at one language or the other, not both. It's not easy to really understand both and be able to fluidly change ideas between them. When people aren't comfortable with one language, they either keep things way too stiff and end up just plopping words in after looking them up with no regard for the words appropriate usage, or you have assholes like Commie who are far too concerned with showing off their writing "flair".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll miss you anons, I haven't watched a new anime in an entire year.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>oh, thanks for that. despite replying to that person, I didn't use the lyrics they posted as I was doing it by ear.

The liberal version, while liberal, is still relatively on-base and isn't a blatant mistranslation or sentence replacement (which Commie has done plenty of times in the past).</br></br></br>  Fucking shit, hype as fuck!  <br>Perry Bible pls</br>  <br>It's okay I guess.</br>  <br>This song is so gay</br>  <br> The liberal version, while liberal, is still relatively on-base and isn't a blatant mistranslation or sentence replacement (which Commie has done plenty of times in the past). <br>Yeah, even when I'm trying to make a point I just don't have it in me to rewrite shit the way they do.

This song is a song that will pierce the heavens! </br>  <br>Anything else you might wanna change?</br>    Zoid put a translation of the song up on his blog if you want to compare and contrast.  <br>That sounds about right for them.

Who cares about the show? Commie are just as funny as your anniemays!<br><br>I honestly forgot about this shit.<br>I probably thought it was funny when I first watched, but with hindsight it's just more stupid shit from a stupid group.<br>Then I start to remember their truly epic for the win GuP subs.<br><br>Commie were never good. Why are they so popular?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the more you fucks meme about them the more people get interested and look for them.</br>  <br>Because they still give me fansubs in a time where we have to suffer from shity streamrips that make my eyes bleed.</br>  <br>They're good typesetters and encoders.<br><br> I wouldn't have watched Oregairu S2 without Commie </br></br></br>  <br> Then I start to remember their truly epic for the win GuP subs. <br>But Panzer vor were great subs.<br><br><br> encoders. <br>They encode every TV release with the exact same settings on a server.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should I feel bad for really liking that stuff. </br>  <br>200 mb for a yahari ep and it looked better than CR's rip.</br>  <br>Yes. You're literally enjoying shitty memes instead of anime.</br>  <br>She said she wanted a pet carrot when she meant to say a pet bunny.</br>  <br>But that's not even a meme, just a joke and why do you think I'm not still enjoying the anime alongside it.</br>  <br>It's the equivalent of enjoying stupid translators notes like "omg this part is so funny!" when reading manga.</br>  Soon.  <br> Why are they so popular? <br>Because they keep releasing a bunch of subs. It's not exactly a highly competitive market out there.</br></br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Nanjo Yoshino while she cosplays as Shirabe</br></br>  <br><br>Adding to that, sometimes they're the only option.

Though you would think the more competent people in the group would get tired of the bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria pls</br>  <br> GuP  <br>I have to admit that I actually liked the aryan track. Might have to do with the fact that I was a bit bored with the show otherwise and the panzer vor shenanigans got a few chuckles out of me.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>New who is infested with Tumblr bullshit.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127311080 <br>Don't you have Euphonium threads to shitpost in?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127311380 <br>I don't even watch Euphonium nigga.<br><br>I just know you faggots shitpost in them.

I always like chorus songs more than solo songs.</br>  <br>Not him, but there are people who like the show for other reasons, and who still like yuri but aren't militant /u/fags.</br>  <br>Tsubasa almost died too.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127311552 <br>Dude, it's not explicitly yuri but the show constantly pushes it so it's not like it's coming from no where.<br><br>The lyrics to all the songs are gay as fuck in context.

And probably not until the end either<br> Will there be new Symphogeahs? <br>No</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For me it's:<br>Chris&gt;Delicious hand drawn action&gt; 熱血&gt; /m/ references and shout outs&gt; music&gt; Zenbu&gt; Genjiro punching things&gt; Sugita being Sugita&gt; Romance regardless of the genders involved, but in this particular instance it's Miku and Hibiki and I hope they just fucking kiss</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127311822   <br>Friday<br>Probably no<br>Definitely no</br></br></br>  <br>No, it is common knowledge that:<br>Kirika &gt; Maria &gt; Shirabe</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127311822 <br> It's just a song, written by people that are not the Geahs. <br><br> He doesn't know </br></br></br>  <br>Kirika &gt; Shirabe &gt; Maria</br>  <br> Will there be new Symphogeahs? <br>No new users, at least.  I'm hoping for Mjölnir Mikugeah </br></br>  <br>Maria &gt; Kirika &gt; Shirabe</br>  Hibiki &gt; Chris &gt; Kirika = Shirabe &gt; Fine &gt; Serena &gt; Kanade = Tsubasa = Maria  About to watch season 1 and 2 to keep up with the upcoming season.<br><br>What am I in for?</br></br>  <br> loli voiced by Nanjolno <br>No shit?</br></br>  <br> Why are they so popular? <br><br>Because they deliver subs unlike everyone else. Subbing scene is dead.<br><br>Their only "competition" is HorribleSubs and I will never, ever choose a sub that insists on "translating" honorifics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsubasa this low <br>Nana would be disappointed in you.</br></br>  <br>Fun!</br>  <br>Singing and punching with a side of jam.</br>  <br>A trainwreck that just gets dumber, more stylish and over-the-top as it goes on. The story is hogwash, but everything else is amazing. Leave your brain at the door and enjoy the ride.</br>  <br>Why don't you just fucking watch it?</br>  <br>Are we going to put retarded captions on everything like we did with G?</br>  <br> bitchnigga who can't handle Tsubasa's alpha </br>  <br>Hotblooded action and songs.</br>  <br>That's a given.</br>  <br>You say that as if we have a choice.</br>  <br> trainwreck <br>Nope.

Expect creepy roach eyes too.</br>  About to watch Equlibrium to keep up with Chris new moves in the upcoming season.<br><br>What am I in for?</br></br>  <br> Trainwreck <br>Memewatchers get out</br></br>  <br>Great low budget action movie.</br>  <br>There isn't anything trainwreck like about S1s plot. It's a generic jrpg plot to the letter.</br>  <br>Cool action scenes surrounded by dumb everything else. It's a fun watch.</br>  <br> Sean Bean dies at the beginning. </br>  Is Kanade alive yet.  <br>If this is an example of "cool" then no thanks, I'll pass.</br>  <br><br>Why do japs love equlibrium so much?</br></br>  <br>Great, we're going to get the teenage shounenshit crowd?</br>  <br>No.<br>She will never be.</br></br>  <br>They fixed that scene in the blurays I take it?</br>  <br>That is the blu ray.<br>The TV version had loads of still frames.</br></br>   Tfw the rocket Hibiki rides during the trailer explodes too     <br> trigger discipline <br>god yes give me more</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry, meant to post this for you.</br></br>  <br>Oh he definitely posts here.</br>  <br>-san etc fucking sucks<br>Stuff like senpai is better than the localization though.</br></br>  <br>Nana planned it.</br>  Who's you're favorite of the new girls /a/?  <br>Blue has the most delicious looking dolljoints.</br>  <br> Kanade </br>  <br> not wating glorious Hibiki-kun  <br><br>Get out gaylord</br></br></br>  <br>I just want her back.</br>  <br>I don't even remember their names other than Elfnein.</br>  <br>Eru erufu</br>  <br>The old ones</br>  <br>Prepare for Gun-Fu</br>  <br>I'm ambivalent about the designs so far and we don't really know much about them as characters, but from what we've seen I think Green is going to be a lot of fun to see in action.</br>  <br><br> Misaki Kuno </br></br>  <br>The Live was great.<br> 響君！ <br> 師匠！ <br> 響君！ <br> 師匠！ <br> ひびぃぃぃきぃぃぃくうううん！ <br> しいいいいいしょうううううう！ <br> 帰るぞ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the symphogear cast ever saw this gif</br>  <br>Carol 's hat </br>  <br> People, cats and dogs in the street, I will dissect all of them. </br>  <br>Carol</br>  <br>Has science gone too far?</br>  <br>I can hear Aoi's voice in my head.<br>Her live songs never fail to put a smile on my face whenever they pop-up in the playlist.</br></br>  <br>Honestly I have trouble listening to the album versions now. She was so fucking animated during the last Live that the normal songs don't compare anymore.</br>  <br>A B-Tier Action movie with retarded stuff popping out everywhere and super cliché moments.<br>I suggest you to turn off your brain before enjoying the crazy ride.</br></br>  Is Genjuro the only one that gives Hibiki an honorific? I know Chris calls her idiot.  <br>I get the same feeling when I listen to the TV versions of the battle songs compared to the disk versions.<br>They just sound so much more powerful.</br></br>  I'm ready.  <br>I never go to /u/ but I imagine they are having field day with this show.</br>    <br>S1 is different from S2. Ver's impossibly overpowered LiNKER was not a factor back then, meaning it does not, in any way, influence the previous Zesshou uses.</br>  <br>I like how chuuni Aoi looks during her performance. She's amazing.<br><br>Screaming and jumping up and down never gets old.  I'm listening to it right now. </br></br></br>  <br>Of course she's using the flattest technology.</br>  <br>I can't believe this actually happened today with such perfect timing to Exterminate.</br>  <br>For now nobody, like during G where I didn't really like any of the new characters.<br>They'll grow on me after a couple of episodes once I know them better.</br></br>  <br>Her over drills are shit</br>  <br>No more so than most yuribait shows, really.</br>  So who's Fine this season then?  <br>You are shit.</br>  <br>Does someone have this gif with the wwwwww?</br>  <br>Fine is old and busted.<br><br> Maria. </br></br></br>  <br>You'll regret those words when she's stabbing your waifu to death.</br>  <br>No one maybe?</br>  <br>I actually liked the plot of season 1.<br>The character development is handled well.<br>On a rewatch, I realized the foreshadowed basically everything.</br></br></br>  <br> Fine is old and busted. <br>Just like Maria and Tsubasa.</br></br>  <br>Fine is a ghost now, she's probably playing cards with Kanade at the moment.</br>  <br>That's why I said Maria you dingus.</br>  Why can't I stop listening to Exterminate. Nana please release my soul already.  <br>The only thing busted is the lolis brains I hope they both get EXTERMINATED.</br>  <br> stabbing your waifu to death <br>Someone already did guess what? they were just scratches</br></br>  <br>I want Fine back! ;_;<br>Especially now after she turned out to be a good girl after all.</br></br>  Is Maria going to get paired up with Eruerufunein?  <br>Fine has a certain asspull potential though, that would make Maria kinda useful and we can't have that. <br><br><br>Here you go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirika's scythe cut her soul. She is gone forever.</br>  Naruto Gaiden and Boruto: Naruto the Movie, discussion<br><br>So the Otsutsuki duo can fuse<br><br>Will Naruto and Sasuke be able to fuse into the next Hagoromo?<br><br>Is Boruto the movie the last form of naruto media for a while?<br><br>Will there be Himawari: Naruto the movie?<br><br>Are we DBZ now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Sakura will be confirmed for forever alone SasukexSakura fags will be btfo<br>RIP<br>I<br>P</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kishi must have written the movie before he wrote the Gaiden's plot, so if he decides to make Salad belong to Karin, will it have been something he always planned or will it just be "Darth Vader built C-3PO"</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck knows.<br><br>It's clear that cuck resolution is out of the question given how the thought of it made Naruto and Suigetsu more disgusted with Sasuke than anything he did during his edgy phase.<br><br>Sarada being a clone made by Karin seems also unlikely since they are killing all the Shin Jrs as if they weren't real human beans.<br><br>There are way too many plot holes for it to be a misunderstanding.<br><br>And Karin is still being treated as a plot point rather than as a character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>actually, Sasuke's SD manga is called "Uchiha Sasuke Sharingan Tales"</br>  Huh. That was easy. Perhaps I should do that more often. <br>It's slightly more efficient than dueling everybody.</br>  <br>Weren't Crystal Beasts the cancer deck of their time? Like Blackwings with 5ds, but even worse.</br>  <br> mfw burn deck </br>  <br>Okay, mean.</br>  Why is Crow angry?<br>I just started it and now I am already confused.</br>  <br>It's not Gladiator Beasts, anon.</br>  Best girl is best  <br>Is Kuma trying to eat that DD</br>  <br>It's because of the shitty CG models.</br>  Which boat is the cutest?  <br>Not a boat though</br>  <br>What's with Atago's face?</br>   episode 9 <br>Is this a fucking joke?</br>  <br>you are a fucking joke<br>time to jump off a tall building</br></br>  <br>If you can't understand that they're setting you up for what's actually going on and have to take things at face value like that, I don't think this anime is for you.</br>  <br>ayy lamaes are a red herring.<br>I don't remember the dolphin thing.<br>That's related to the concept of the global subconscious, which is important when it comes to what Lain is.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand what a thematic is. When your vehicle for carrying one is so fucking broken it's just laughable though.</br>  <br> there are people who force themselves to watch anime that they don't understand </br></blockquote>]
