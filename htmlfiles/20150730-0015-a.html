Sorry.<br>I'll make sure to announce my claim next time I pick something.</br></br>  <br><br>tried practicing creases on clothing</br></br>  <br>most requests are either lewd or not very intereting in my opinion, not complaining tho, just chillin' and doing boring studies.</br>  I've been wondering if I could get something lewd (somewhat softcore) of Utsutsu for a while now.<br><br>I think it'd be extremely cute to see her  exploring her body for the first time  or something similar, potentially with  a bit of visible juices .<br>It'd fit her character quite well, at least how I'm seeing it in my mind.<br><br>I have a few ideas that are more in-depth, but unless an artists asks for them it's open to their choices.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm working on  but it probably wont be done today.</br>  <br> No healthy requests. </br>  <br>Do you only draw fat stuff?</br>  Requesting tacticool operator Sento please.    <br>Lemmy see some ID.</br>  <br>No one e else but you wants to do lewd</br>  <br>don't blame him anon, he's just desperate for the attention that drawing lewds gets him since his skills aren't good enough to get the same response. <br>if anything we need to blame the parents.</br></br>  <br>I just haven't seen anything I want to do.</br>  <br>I've been working on a longer project for a while so I haven't been delivering here.</br>  <br>Not really many good healthy girls to make healthy requests of. Unfortunately.</br>  <br><br>I don't think being so abrasive is going to help get your request done.<br>I think 2hu is alright, but still.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I do lewd because I enjoy it.</br></br>  I've never seen her requested here, but would anyone be willing to draw her (from Love Tyrant)? I can make like a reference or whatever  <br>yes they have dude, it sucks but they have it</br>  <br>No they don't it's strictly an OC one</br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu from sougou tovarisch in cute frilly swimsuits kissing underwater like the scene from Sakura Trick  <br>then do it on the correct boards.<br><br><br>but wait, that'd mean you don't have so many desperate losers sucking dick at the smallest sign that someone will do their requests on the wrong board.</br></br></br></br>  <br> they have it <br>Wait, you can request shit there?<br>Because last time I personally went over and asked if they did, they said no.</br></br></br>  <br>Are we going to have this pointless shitpost fest againg? Are you THAT bored?</br>    <br>then he can go to /v/ is more related than here</br>  <br>I like to draw soft things.</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>until you get the hint it doesn't belong here.<br>we've had this discussion and we'll keep having this discussion until the mods do something about it one way or another.</br></br>  i miss thegoldensmurf  <br>/h/ doesnt allow loli</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128738366 <br>then I'll continue this forever.<br><br>and technically speaking neither does /i/ or /a/.<br>/a/ allows for sfw lolis, not lewd lolis. the only board that allows loli porn is /b/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then draw some softness wearing this please. Meaty women really make naked aprons work.</br>  <br>god no, this is miles better than goldensmurf related retarded drama</br>  <br>Requesting with Unryuu</br>  <br>She isn't meaty.

I have no real quarrel but I just wish he was less fickle with drawing.  I miss BB and others who used to come here to draw, thanks a lot shitposters. </br>  <br>How is he supposed to trace and have proportion issues at the same time?</br>  Something cute involving these two like a sleep over with one of these projection night lights would be great please and thank you.  <br>you'd be surprised what an idiot can do.</br>    <br>Is there a difference between taticool, tacticute, and operator anime girls?</br>  <br>Well tacticool and tacticute should be obvious. <br>I think operator covers both but leans towards tacticool.</br></br>  <br>If you reference different fanworks for different body parts then splice them together without understanding anatomy it's pretty easy.</br>  requesting Tamamo from FateExtra in this<br>also more underboob art</br>  Requesting a kiss between these two, leading to a comedic acid burning of the boy's mouth. Can give more refs upon request.     there are literally THREE Tamamo requests in this thread already   <br>Cute! Is that a bat?</br>  <br>Oh. I guess I won't request anything else.

I don't request lewds here.</br>  <br>Utsutsu anon here... at least mine's softcore, I guess...<br>I actually try to avoid posting lewd requests too, this is the only one I've wanted... I think it's bad for the board if it gets clogged up like this.<br><br>On top of that, I'm considering commissioning anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with character/clothing swap those are my favorite</br>  <br>I don't quote vultures or replies to requests for requests.<br><br>kissu is fine, I just quoted everyone with a brief description.</br></br></br>  Requesting Hori and Miyamura having cute, yet awkward first-time sex or more of Miyamura 'abusing' or treating Hori roughly because she likes it. Total Maledom, or having Hori being his pet bitch in pet-play  <br>Thanks. Thought I got a drawing.</br>  <br>Mine was neither Why do you assume the worst about people?</br>  <br>doing yours<br><br>And contemplating wearing my name again, though no reason why I do or don't really. Just better for people to identify who's communicating with them before anything has a chance to betray identities.. I guess. I hope you like chromatic aberration..</br></br></br>  <br>fyi this is over 50% lewd by a decent margin, if you do not see the issue then you're an idiot.<br>there are boards with threads dedicated to these precise requests, go there.<br>if you want to draw them, go to those threads.<br>if you want to request them, request them there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>there'd be the issue of /h/ being more populated than /a/, and the general behavioral attitudes that accompany a board with less restriction. Nah, really that's a very conjecture idea and no one still gives a shit.</br>  <br>Well if you avoid doing lewd request usually why post it when it's fucking saturated with them?</br>  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br>the 2 I missed were both lewd, which is not helping your case.<br><br>because you don't go there.<br>go there instead of here to request your stupid shit and this wouldn't be an issue.<br>you're confusing YOU with no one.<br>YOU are an idiot with a behavior problem in general that doesn't belong on /a/ and have been called out on it before.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you for drawing my waifu a few months back</br>  <br>Thanks for the reply and potential work, Anon, I'm fine with chromatic aberration, so long as it's not excessive...<br><br>As for using a name, I'd recommend avoiding it unless you're replying to a request, posting a piece, or etc<br>I'm sure you know but wearing it all the time would just cause more problems for yourself... if it's relating to your works or an identity (OP / OR) it's helpful though.<br><br>I do enjoy having a name to an artist too, as I name works with [SFW/NSFW][character][series][artis<wbr>t] personally and it makes finding them easier.<br><br><br><br>Because I didn't check the requests prior to posting. I realised after posting that it was saturated as such.<br>I actually deleted my request at that point, but later remade it as a "why should I" moment.<br><br>I was then considering deleting it again, I'm sorry if I caused any problems...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eve and Yami with large breasts, sex or paizuri!</br>  <br>I've only ever made a single request in these threads, it was a WWD over a month ago and it was anonymous. But everything else I have no qualms.</br>  <br>minor fixes</br>  <br>Except plenty of people give a shit, this is a divided issue. What's wrong with the /h/ drawthread being more populated than the /a/ one? It's about quality of posts, not quantity.</br>  I would fulfill a request if you people could request anything other than lewd stuff. It's not that I mind drawing ecchi things, but when that's 95% of the requests a guy gets sick of it, you know?  While learning, should I draw full humans or just draw parts of the anatomy that I have difficulty implementing?<br><br>Also is there a guide or any tips for hair? I can't build on a hairline, every time I draw the head looks too big because of the hair.</br></br>  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance.<br>Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan</br>  <br>if you want to draw lewds, go to /h/ or /e/ to draw them not here. by drawing lewds here you are supporting people requesting lewds on /a/ which in turn cause people to request more lewds and clog the threads in requests the majority of drawfags do not want to do.<br>you have no reason to do them here when /h/ and /e/ are open and have plenty of requests.<br>your laziness to not change boards which takes less than a minute is not an excuse.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not problems, it's just a lewd request on top of other lewd requests is not going to stand out. There are drawfags lurking here waiting for something interesting, non-lewd to draw and if you request more lewd stuff you're not going to interest them. If they wanted to do lewd stuff they would be doing it by now.</br>  <br>For the former question, I think both have a place.<br>Probably best to go with singular pieces and then move onto full body pieces with a focus on poses using said pieces.<br><br>I'm not an artist though, I just have a few of them as friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to define a proper head prior to trying to add hair. If your head is the correct shape, draw the hair falling or hanging off it as hair would naturally. While referencing reality won't teach you how to draw anime, it'll teach you how to keep sense in mind when doing things (He said hypocritically)<br><br>Also, I would recommend doing tonnes of full bodies, torsos, limbs, hands, and face studies. Not a few of any, many of every. Doing all the parts individually may be the better option first, but you don't want to not learn how to properly stitch them together and how the musculature between them works, it's just as important as the main bodies of anatomy itself.</br></br></br>   General during weekdays.   Requesting Chitose coughing up blood with one hand holding her stomach while the other is holding a katana.<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/U1Zbh#0</br></br>  <br>I agree, for sure... as I said, I think it's bad for the board too, I'm not disputing that.<br>Between browsing /a/ generally, I tend to spend more time in the /v/ drawthreads though... and my requests there aren't lewd, especially since it's saturated too.</br></br>  <br>if only the requests were as interesting as blazing saddles I'd ditch the wwd for good.<br> you also left WWD in the name. </br></br>  <br> implying that's not the WWD on sunday. </br>  Tamamo celebrating No Bra Day by wearing her left outfit without her bra on; make it more teasing the viewer.  <br>Hot damn, this makes four.</br>  Requesting Kurumi Tokisaki playing with kittens at an animal shelter.<br>Like maybe her using some cat toys to play with them, or her taking a nap with all of the kittens lying on her as well.</br>  <br>requesting tamamo pleasing 4 dicks</br>  Requesting a straight girl being surrounded by horny lesbians, with nowhere to run  Also since I've been doing separate requests with different types of bikinis, how about I put all the references in just one pic, and let the drawdude decide the style and the girl.  Requesting busty waifus trying to touch their elbows together behind their back.<br><br> Tree captcha, why? </br></br>  <br> leaving out the best bikini type </br>  I've spent months on these threads<br>and have finally realized that /m/ has the same thing too holy shit</br>  Collecting some data. Please post your preferred body type.<br><br>Pic related...</br></br>   There was a time where bikinis were the hottest thing ever, even more erotic than just being nude because it left things to the imagination, and now bikinis are bland, just like everything else <br><br>How did it come to this?</br></br>    <br>Small and eager.</br>  <br>Fapped too much, take a tolerance break man.</br>  <br>Easily. As we become more inundated with more and more erotic things. They start to lose their touch reducing the amount of arousal we get. <br><br>It's a slow decline but let's not be faggots about this. Let's run down this fucking hill at full tilt and see where this ends up.</br></br></br>    <br>It cycles. I've had times when I wouldn't even admit on /a/ the kind of fetishes it took to get me off, but then I moved right onto binges of pure cute vanilla for months, then back on a downward slope again.<br><br>There is no bottom, just a flat circle.</br></br></br>    <br>Hungry skeletons.</br>  <br>this nigga knows, requesting more Nyaruko</br>        <br>My waifu's.

I'll start on other random requests in the meantime.</br></br>  <br>Pussy, ass, mouth, hand<br>Perfect</br></br>  <br>Which Ryuko? KLK Ryuko? Tenchi Ryuko? Different Ryuko?</br>  <br>Already fucked up, neat</br>  <br>riding a unicycle</br>  <br>Draw her cutting a piece of paper with her giant scissors</br>  <br> cowboy boots  <br>Noice.</br></br>  <br>Well then, requesting anything lewd with shaga, and if you want to include Ume finally raping her, then please go ahead!</br>  Fucked hard yet passionately  Someone draw Leon, the protag of GARO anime, killing a non-human girl, demon would be best.  <br>Didn't that already happen in the first episode?</br>  Did the artist drop this pic of the two girls in Owari no Seraph wearing skimpy versions of their uniforms?<br>Also could use some smut of them if anyone is willing to draw that.</br>  <br>No  she dies though, and still no porm of Eiha and Val </br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  Requesting colour<br>https://data.archive.moe/board/a/im<wbr>age/1426/71/1426718918898.jpg<br>https://data.archive.moe/board/a/im<wbr>age/1426/87/1426872666761.jpg<br>And wearing anything really small and tight on her chest</br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  Requesting Musubi wearing a Zipper Bikini, struggling to keep it on or to zip it.

Ainz Ooal Gown is wearing shades. Passengers are optional.  <br>Capturing their likeliness is difficult with how minimalist shaft has done their features. Not much room for error if you're striving towards looking like official art. Atleast, that's my opinion.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Sorry, I've lost interest. I'm not dissatisfied with my 60-80minute mockup but I don't really want to keep going with this. Fixes, ink, color, eh. These aren't subjects I think I need work on, only practice.

Requesting Sakurako and Himawari from Yuru Yuri in another of their little fights, with both in swimsuits (artists choice from ref sheet), with Sakurako leaning forward a bit and wearing a smug-ass grin, having just shoved Himawari down front-first into an oversized wet dessert cream pie, with Himawari looking surprised/humiliated/shocked and soaked swimsuit and all in the pie cream.    <br>sounds like good practice. gimme a waifu</br>      Requesting Tomoko dressed as Tharja from Fire Emblem.  <br>Not my waifu, but my boner misses her.</br>    Requesting Tomoko wearing a sweater with armpit holes.    <br>I'm more of a Takasugi Kou man. But without the NTR and other shit.</br>  <br>While she isn't my waifu, gotta go with Yuki-nee on this one.</br>  <br>Girls in suit and ties are fucking love.</br>    <br>i highly doubt this girl is your waifu, but i dont care anymore.<br><br>anyways here you go. this took longer than i would have liked. it would have been easier to just have left her naked. but why would she be naked? a quick doodle of a girl touching elbows behind her back. no underlying meaning here what so ever. no sir.<br><br>i really didnt expect so many people to reply to my post. i cant do anymore tonight, so everyone else will have to wait for some other time. sorry</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so everyone else will have to wait for some other time. sorry <br>Damn, nice work anyway.</br></br>  <br>Something like this.</br>  <br> Busty  <br>Good work though.</br></br>  live.

As long as it's /a/ related, go for it.</br>  I don't even know where the OR is anymore, but finally got around to finishing this. Sorry that it took so long  <br>Who is this? Looks good.</br>  <br>The face is nicely done, but her skinny shoulders and long wrist and hand make it look kinda weird.</br>  <br>Mimi from Daughters of Mnemosyne, thanks.</br>  <br>You know, like, rori tier lewds.</br>  <br>Well damn, I'm not going to change that now though, unless someone knows how to edit whole groups in sai.<br>Thanks for pointing it out though.</br></br>  <br>I know how you feel, you work on something for hours and when you're done you discover you screwed up somewhere but fixing it it just too much hassle.</br>  Requesting this little right fagott maniacally smug while posing as Fiamma of the Right. I leave the rest of drawing to the drawfag's imaginations.<br><br> Left fagott is fine too </br></br>  <br>Obviously this one.</br>  <br>Petite.</br>  Requesting Eto wrapping herself on these bandages preparing for her next work/mission.<br><br>If you wonder how she's looks like:http://i.imgur.com/1XNxoCH.png<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Sexy.<br>I'd do sinful things to a body like hers.</br></br>  <br>Muscular</br>  <br>Okay.

If the dice indicates "1", Fujitora wins.<br>Depending on the result of gambling, Fujitora decided not to arrest Luffy and Law tonight. Maynard is embarassed with it and still tries to persuade Fujitora. It seems marine managed to find the place where Luffy is hiding.<br><br>Fujitora says that Maynard is not manly since he continues complaining after the gamble ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  First for Robin  second for Robin  <br>How can one man be so<br>B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>nooooice</br></br>  I bet fujitora used his gravity powers to rig the dice  <br>Most likely, just like he probably did with the roulette. Zatoichi also cheated when gambling so it fits.</br>  who is maynard?  <br>Vice-Admiral, was inside the arena during the tournament, got his ass kicked by Barto.</br>  <br>He is the secret admiral who also goes by the name Spee D. Reader</br>  <br>Sounds like Fujitora is mad that he is the lone traitor faggot Marine who acts like such a faggot while Maynard actually wants to do his job to arrest pirates based on common sense and not something as stupid as basing decisions on a coin or dice.<br><br>I can see Fujitora getting ditched by the marines under him eventually since it is Fujitora that is banned from all bases and not people like Maynard.<br><br>Maynard has a snail phone as well since he is a Vice Admiral so high chances Maynard can not tolerate Fujitora's actions anymore and tells Akainu that Fujitora has no intention to do his job correctly and to send another Admiral to Dressrosa.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saka-san pls</br>  What's up, /a/, vizanon here. Been a while since I've been able to visit a thread thanks to uni and travel.<br><br>Imgur here, as always, and up to date: http://vizanon.imgur.com/<br><br>Dumping the previous chapter now, since it doesn't look like any new spoiler info is coming in the immediate future.</br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw akainu himself appears right after the strawhats fuck off </br>  <br>Are you ready for all this exposition?</br>  <br>A quick recap first.</br>  <br>Doesn't apply to me since I read raws but bless you nonetheless</br>  <br>Robin is so beautiful. I wish she would kiss me.</br>  <br>beat up Bartolomeo's second in command, Gambia<br><br>got his ass whooped for it</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>I want to see more of Dragon's ship. It looks so cool.</br>  <br>anon pls</br>  <br><br><br>POST MORE ROBIN</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Fujitora.<br><br>How is it not common sense to arrest pirates at night when they can not fight back and are at their weakest?<br><br>That way, the marines have less risk of injuring themselves and higher rate of success.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta love how nonchalant Dragon is about Luffy being his son. He's definitely part of the family.</br>  Another fucking filler chapter? This piece of shit really wants to delay anything interesting until chapter 800. I would have prefered a longer Doffy fight over this unnecessary garbage.  <br><br><br>You do know Maynard is going to be the one to kill Blackbeard, right?</br></br></br>  <br>with pleasure</br>    <br>I'm not big on the anime, but I'm actually pretty keen to see this hug animated.</br>    <br>The best detail here is Franky's tears making his face spark. He's a true cartoon robot now.<br><br>And that's the end of it. Hoping for 19 pages this week.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck.</br></br>  <br>Well, seeing how the bet was if Fujitora "wins" they wont go after the stawhats, it's likely that Fuji doesnt want to arrest the strawhats in the first place. Not everyone is a corrupt justicefag like Akainu.</br>  <br>Oda just need to keep inventing reasons for the Marines to act so beta and not do anything about the pirates.<br><br>Every chapter makes Fujitorafags who claim Fujitora is still a Marine lose their remaining arguments as well.<br><br>He is purposely not doing his job and has no intention of capturing Law and Luffy.<br><br>He also admitted to Fujitora on phone that he actually delays information to Akainu and will even edit out the content to suit his personal purposes.<br><br>I don't see Fujitora having a career as a Marine much longer.<br><br>And I doubt he is gonna be allowed to leave peacefully and will be killed by the Marines to get back the Devil Fruit they gave him.<br><br>And the offficial Marine executioner in One Piece has always been Kizaru and since Z did not die in the manga, high chances Fujitora is gonna fulfill Z's role to show how cold blooded Kizaru out of all the Marines since Kizaru did not cry at all while killing Z.<br><br>And I doubt Akainu is that much of an idiot to still trust Fujitora after Fujitora admitted all of that and does not respect the chain of command.<br><br>Akainu probably ordered backup to be sent to Dressrosa just in case Fujitora really does not plan to follow orders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post yfw<br> Sabo is escaping <br> he sees the marines, thinks they'll be going after Luffy <br> attacks the Marines, everyone gets sucked in <br> all-out war <br> Luffy wakes up, goes to save Sabo <br> Marines have to release Doflamingo to help them <br> Doffy uses birdcage <br> Dressrosa nearly restarted <br>You can't get off Oda's wild Dressrosa ride.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do people care for fanmade images that doesn't even resemble the original art style?<br>You can literally make every single character in the history of manga look good by changing proportions, body and the face.</br></br></br>  <br> He is purposely not doing his job and has no intention of capturing Law and Luffy. <br>That's like saying the marines stationed at that island where Luffy met Zoro and dropped Coby off at aren't marines for not immediately capturing Luffy.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off pirate scum lover.<br><br>A lot of innocent countries got destroyed thanks to Luffy's actions at Impel Down and part of the reason why Sengoku resigned.<br><br>Hannyabal was entirely right about Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Muh dick.</br></br>  <br><br>Same with Akainu not capturing Luffy the first time they met or later on at Water 7 after the Enies Lobby incident had resolved itself.</br></br>  <br>They aren't marines and likely got magma fisted like they deserved for trying to desert from the war since they were such Luffyfags.</br>  <br><br>You were saying, magma brat?</br></br>  <br>Fuck, not Akainu. Made a mistake there. Aokiji.</br>  <br><br> Akainu <br><br>You mean Kuzan.<br><br>Akainu would've killed them all right there and then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Saka</br>  Not sure why people are surprised by fujitora's actions. It's obvious that his perception of justice is different from the traditional marines. Hell, he probably didn't want to be a marine in the first place. He's aware that the strawhats have literally saved 2 countries, while the marines basically enabled those tragedies to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if he just cleaned up after the strawhats as they steamroll the rest of the new world, like taking in kaido after the battle.  <br>here is your reply</br>  <br>Anyone who blindly follows the system is the true betas. Fujitora is alpha as fuck.</br>  <br>Fujitora would spare Jaguar.<br><br>Aokiji would not.<br><br>And Aokiji did not know that Luffy was Dragon's Son yet.<br><br>Akainu after finding out Luffy was Dragon's son prioritized Luffy 2nd to Ace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   yfw doffy is called "Heavenly Demon", because he who was ones a Tenryuubito - and therefore living in heaven - came down to the world and turned against heaven becoming the gods natural enemy - a demon <br>Now why the fuck is Kuma called Tyrant?</br>  <br>People like you are why mexican drug cartel leaders easily so escape from prison.<br><br>We need to bring back the guillotine.</br></br></br>  <br>this is nice</br>  <br>Because, he crusades in the name of Jesus and conquers places for Jesus</br>  <br>Sorry but Fujitora is beta as fuck.<br><br>Bird Cage wouldn't have destroyed all those buildings if Fujitora wanted to stop it.<br><br>Fujitora ain't gonna be paying for Dressrosa's reconstruction efforts when he could have prevented such a thing from being needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whaaaat? Are you saying that an Admiral would ignore a mere pirate, even if they don't have an infamous man as a parent? Preposterous.<br><br>A pirate is a pirate. Luffy being Dragon's son makes him more important as a target, but it doesn't change his status as a pirate and how the marines should treat him.</br></br></br>  <br>He had a reputation for being particularly violent, I'm assuming it has something to do with his revolutionary days/government propaganda</br>  <br> comparing mexican drug carel leaders to someone who freed two countries from corruption.  <br>Okay</br></br>  <br>Kizaru ignored everyone else besides the Strawhats on Shabody because the Strawhats was his current job.<br><br>Kizaru could have seastone cuffed everybody but Luffy was his current target.<br><br>Same goes for Aokiji. Luffy was not his target at the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, let's just conveniently forget the fact that he orchestrated the largest prison break ever AND practically declared war on the 41 countries.</br>  Fujitora is best marine  <br><br>41 countries that blindly follow a corrupt system including abusive nobles and slavery.</br></br>  <br>But King Riku is the most retarded person alive in One Piece.<br><br>He would be happy if his country gets destroyed again since he intends to be extremely pacifistic once again and even his citizens says its okay for Dressrosa to get conquered again since they love their extreme pacifism.<br><br>People like King Riku deserve the Darwin Award.<br><br>Luffy didn't save Dressrosa since Dressorsa did not learn their lesson at all and want to repeat their tragic mistake once again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy still freed them from corruption though - the word 'save' wasn't used.</br></br>  <br>I just realized that we only have to wait till the anime to know if the crows really are  Moria </br>  <br>Not my fault you weren't born a noble.</br>  <br><br>Dressrosa was peaceful and prosperous for 800 years. That would have continued if it wasn't for doffy</br></br>  <br>But King Riku has the most twisted and corrupted idea of peace ever.<br><br>King Riku is even worse than being a hippy.</br></br></br>  <br> trusting the anime <br>kek</br></br>  <br>ignored? He was about to kill them all but then Sentomaru told him to go after the SHs, Law and Kid.</br>  <br><br> supporting corruption and slavery </br></br>  Threadly reminder  <br> Dressrosa was peaceful and prosperous for 800 years <br><br>No it wouldn't, idiot.<br><br>For 800 years, Gold Roger was not born yet.<br><br>After Gold Roger was born, Dressrosa would not have such luck anymore since the Age of Pirates was born.<br><br>Dressrosa would have eventually got Kaidou or Big Mom's attention even if Dofla never came to Dressrosa.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See you in ten years when Fuji's actions in Dressrosa initiates the downfall of the Shichibukai system, which in turn the downfall of a corrupt government system AND the exposure of it on a worldwide scale. Nigga just started rolling the snowball that'll eventually free the OP world from the CDs and WG. He'll shit on Akainu so fucking hard on a political level. And he's not even scared of Akainu's bitching. You know he could gravity slap Magmashit's bitch ass to the ground if he wanted to.</br>  <br>That's not Tashigi</br>  <br>superior ship is here now</br>  <br><br> not the best ship yet <br><br>Seriously though, what do you think the egg is?<br><br>Sea kings?

It wasn't too bad. I wish Gon Synchro Summoned something on his first turn instead of the Magnet play. Crow wasn't too bad I guess. Gon played Pendulums and Synchro but it was underwhelming. Not too bad a duel. Doesn't restore my hype though.  I finally realized that Yusei's deck eats through your hand like a motherfucker. No wonder he had to rely on angle baton and graveyard effects alot. Yuma's gagagas need another xyz monster. cowboy and samurai are good at what they do but they need a number  <br>Well Yusei's deck is also largely shit and useless.</br>  <br>I hadn't even thought of that, yes, keikaku right.</br>  <br><br>Dont bump this thread, we still have to go through the old one, let this one die.

Also go to hell faggot, anybody on 4chan who only uses ONE board is the worst cancer on 4chan and needs to leave.

All that stuff you mentioned can happen outside of more filler duels. The staff mentioned that the tournament is getting interrupted by Academia and Dennis reveals himself. Just a matter of when. Which is good because honestly it feels pointless. Academia invasion is a better way of making allies and shows proper Lancer capabilities in battle.</br></br>  <br> Make a post about how you aren't going to respond to something <br>But that doesnt make sense.

Just once I'd like to see a tournament fully play out.

Everything else though is anti hype. MESHI duel was stupid, summon chants are ok I guess. The Gon duel wasn't hype.</br></br>  <br><br>1. Nobody brought up a 5 GET.<br>2. This may be an ARC-V thread, but it's also a general Yu-Gi-Oh! thread when ARC-V isn't airing in real time.<br><br>Just chill. There are no 5 GETs here. Learn to egao!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> wow receiving that blast from Against the Wind was pretty cool. I bet this card was created for the sole purpose of riding duels <br> remember Crow never used against the wind in 5D's <br> remember you couldn't use regular spells in riding duels in 5D's <br><br>Damn that was really a wasted opportunity. Against the Wind is a pretty hype card.

When exactly do you think Arc-V's quality began it's nosedive?<br><br>I think it was when Sawatari got OTK'd off screen the moment they got to the Syncro dimension.</br></br>  So anybody enjoying this arc still? I don't think it's as bad as you guys are saying.  <br>Thanks for the work, hope Mon feels better.</br>  <br>I'm sick of the writers wanking off Shun</br>  <br><br>I love it<br>Only thing I'm salty about it Action Cards in Riding Duels instead of real Riding duels</br></br></br>  <br>It's not that people dislike Shun.<br>It's that nobody else is allowed to be competent or get the spotlight. <br><br>It's more a problem of the Synchro Arc just being poorly written.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are getting tired of the writer's Shunfaggotry. Brave Claw Revolution can only happen so many times before people get tired of it.</br>  <br> but if you dont like the rules we've all agreed on then you can fuck off <br>Um, I'm pretty sure we didn't agree on those rules.</br></br>  <br>I hate how Standard will eventually incorporate Action cards into all dimensions.</br>  <br>He could at least use Blaze Falcon or Revolution falcon. Rise Falcon has already gotten old.</br>  <br>Don't you like Mario Kart anon?</br>  <br> This may be an ARC-V thread, but it's also a general Yu-Gi-Oh! thread <br>I remember a few months ago people were saying the exact opposite and that only things related to Arc-V should be posted in these thread.</br></br>  <br>What everyone else said, he's being pushed too hard, he's like Cena. <br><br>Now if he was the main character, which would be cool, I'd love him.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm261<wbr>17250</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait til page 8 is pretty accepted on all the general type threads on /a/, there's barely ever any disagreement.

Or limits at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The staff mentioned that the tournament is getting interrupted by Academia and Dennis reveals himself. <br>Sauce?</br></br>  <br>Blaze Falcon is pretty weak, Revolution Falcon wouldn't have OTK the police unless Shun pulls out a new Raidraptor card that doubles the attack.</br>  <br> I just wish we could get better reasons for why characters wouldn't go for action cards in crucial situations except LOLFORGOT <br>Logically characters should spend every minute running for Action Cards, but that wouldn't leave them any time to monologue<br><br><br>The writers would have been able to script the duel differently to lead to a different outcome</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's called Wheelie Breaker you faggot</br>  <br>Especially since it was harshly nerfed for the actual game so it's kinda bad promotion.</br>  <br> http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26<wbr>117250</wbr> <br>Nice edit, but shitty song.</br></br>  <br> They weren't being serious Anon, it was mostly pasta <br>Eh, they were being really autistic about it and there would be arguments on multiple threads about it.</br></br>  <br>One thing I liked about the second Yuya vs Reiji is that even with the action field they were no action cards, it made the duel feel a lot more tense knowing Yuya couldn't find get out of jail free cards.

That way it's way more realistic how you can have incredibly specific action cards and you can't just go for them in the last second but need to properly prepare them which gives the opponent a chance to react to them and change their strategy to accomodate action cards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pic related</br>  What if the real reason why Reiji doesn't wear socks because it hinders his chunni powers?  <br>Sorry that I triggered you, faggot.</br>  <br>That's cool, I hope we get actual kaiju references, it'd be a neat archetype petdeck.</br>  <br><br>Also<br> little brother NTRing you with your rival <br><br>is also part of his keikaku</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Socks aren't a part of keikaku.

No update for 2 weeks ;_;  <br>Yeah I feel action cards themselves are fine but alot of recent duels arn't as interesting to write using them. Incorporate more traps as well into duels tired of these strategies of just laying your monsters out and then grabbing an action card to make up for bad strategy.</br>  <br>read</br>  <br><br>If you summon it from your hand to their side of the field, then you'd have to have a second one in your hand to summon another one to your side, unless other Kaiju are summoned to your opponent's side as well.<br><br>Sounds like a shit card beyond the token effect, and tokens generally don't last anyways. Well so much for that archetype already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Check the thread.</br>  <br>His computer died or something. I'm willing to wait.</br>  <br>So it's based on getting rid of your opponent's boss by single-tribute Lava Goleming it so that your opponent has a Kaiju and then you can have a Kaiju.<br><br>Basically, you replace your opponent's monster with a Kaiju to have a KAIJU VS KAIJU BATTLE.<br><br>This is so retarded it sounds fun as fuck. And the "You can only control 1 Kaiju monster" seems like an indication they learnt from the Rulers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;you need to discard action cards to build up your action counters <br>That doesnt leave any time to stand around and ZETSUBO</br></br>  <br>You can grab 1 Spell and 1 Trap Action Card per duel. Action Cards are also tailored made for the field spell and not the two individuals decks, which increases the possibility of "I'm playing in a sea field, but I use fire monsters, this 'Increase all water monsters atk by 200' action card does me no good.</br>  <br><br><br>OK glad Mono isn't kill</br></br></br>  <br><br> Incorporate more traps as well into duels tired of these strategies of just laying your monsters out and then grabbing an action card to make up for bad strategy. <br><br>I'm actually okay with that. Yuya has shown against Enjoy that in regular duels he'd put Hippo in defense position to stall, but in Action duels he plays him in attack position to ride him so he can grab an action card to protect him which is more entertaining than to just it there and stall on facedown monsters. <br><br>It just gets annoying when they are able to spam Action Cards with no restriction whatsoever.<br><br>Then again the whole "riding your monster thing" is also non existant in Action Riding duels so that point is moot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently all the kaiju can be summoned on your opponent's field so.</br>  <br> Summon a low-ATK monster or token <br> Special summon that to your opponents side <br> Creature Swap <br><br><br><br>see<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, then that makes it a lot more convenient and better. Interesting archetype though I must say, I may have to try it out at some point.</br>  <br>Yeah it's just most of the best moment's of Yugioh are "TRAP HATSUDO" I think yuya does the "bet it all on action cards" best but when someone like crow does it it doesn't make sense.</br>  <br><br>It's not tokens it's counters. We don't know how easy it is to build them up. Might have some Yosen training ground type of card that just let's you easily built up your counters on summoning monsters</br></br>   you will never have a SoL episode where <br> Sora and Serena bully Sawatari to buy them snacks because he's rich <br> Dennis takes Gon to a circus <br> Yuzu takes Yuya to an orchestra <br> Shun, Ruri, and Yuto go bird watching <br> Reiji and Ninjabro teach Reira how to ride a bike with Yugo and Rin </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dennis seemed pretty concerned about Gon, wish we had more interactions between them they make a great pair. Their hero/villain duel was enjoyable.</br>  <br>You're right I misread it, my bad. It does sound like Yosenju mixed a bit with Dragon Rulers but dialed back heavily.<br><br>Sounds cool.</br></br></br>  <br>I always figured Sawatari would be the one to face Dennis in Academia, but I think it's gonna be Gon at this rate. <br><br>I imagine Shun will lose to him off-screen and Gon will step in before he's carded.</br></br></br>  <br> Token <br><br>Anon...<br><br>Oh and the first 2 sentences are probably general to all the arquetype<br><br><br>Creature swap plays are always fun.

The Manzais are pretty much all we get most of the most of the time.</br>  <br>And so far it's just been Serena being cute and Sawatari being a good boy and wanting to be friends with Yuya.<br><br>I feel bad for Sawatari, he's trying so hard to be Yuya and his friend and Yuya doesn't care, and he just keeps jobbing terribly.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Shun <br> &gt;Losing offscreen <br><br>Not like he didn't do that already</br></br></br></br>    <br>From /dng/, it seems like the field spell (Kaiju Watchout Tower or Tokyo something or whatever):<br><br> When cards are sent from the field to the grave, place one Kaiju Counter here for each card sent, up to a max of 5. <br> Once per turn, if this card has 3 or more Kaiju counters: You can add a Kaiju card from your deck to your hand. <br><br>Interesting thing to note is that, although the search effect is OPT (dunno if hard or soft) and requires 3-5 counters, IT DOESN'T SPEND THEM.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I can destroy Tokyo Tower in my children's card games <br><br>Yes, yeeeees</br></br></br>  <br>Despite his overtures to the contrary, both Sawatari and Dennis are vastly more dedicated to the Entertainment Dueling style than Yuya.</br>  <br> You can only control 1 “Kaiju” monster. </br>  <br><br>Sawatari only got into entertainment dueling because he secretly wants to be like Yuya in the first place</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, and I forgot:<br><br> If this card would be destroyed, you can remove one Kaiju counter from it instead. <br><br>So yeah, ironically it's the Kaiju (counters) that are protecting the tower.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will you marry a Ruri or a cardfu? Either way you have to procreate so you form a family or you get nothing.  <br>Konami doesn't understand Kaiju at all. What's next a pagoda is protected by Kaiju too?

That's about all.</br>  <br>If I pick Madolche Tiaramisu can I just rape the others?</br>  <br>Sawatari was more entertaining than Yuya was during that duel, he sold it well.</br>  <br>Only if she is into harem.</br>  <br>He tries so hard but his effort is always in vain</br>  <br>Gonna ask this, why people really love Serena too much? Is because of her personality, or her innocent POV at her age?</br>  <br>Nope, it's a Normal Trap card and nowhere does it say it needs nor has to stay on the field.<br><br>Nad it's not really that good honestly, as three battle phases is a bit much. And since it can only be activated in MP, this means even if you activate it in the opponent's turn he can decide to skip their BP.<br><br>Outside of Exodia Stall Trap, the only meta deck I can think of would be Nekroz, since they can stall time by ending BPs and can make use of clearing their own field.<br><br><br>At least it's send to grave instead of destroy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never understood people love for shortstacks fatties like her.<br><br>on that note I'd make love to Eria the water charmer</br></br></br>  <br>She's Yuzu, but even more crude and strong.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Goodbye Towers Turbo. Make place for GOZIRAA</br>  <br>That actually makes the card more interesting, if you can manage to last three turns, you can take a very big advantage, even so if they decide to skip the BP, that's giving you the advantage too. <br><br>It's actually a pretty decent card, it's certainly not Meta, lets be real here, but it's definitely a decent and interesting card by far.</br></br></br>  <br>no, real duelists just win all the by using the most broken combination of cards they can find.</br>  <br>Looks, personality, deck, naivety, everything.

Sawatari sees that there is a time and place for entertainment, and Dennis either uses it as his facade or tries to make a show of things due to his personality. Yuya wants dueling to only be for entertainment both for his audience and himself. <br><br>Jack was right, if Yuya isn't feeling it, if he's worked up or under pressure, he's not doing the entertainment thing for anyone but himself. If he wanted to entertain the crowd he would have attempted to survive the turn instead of throwing himself all out to win.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And if people fap with Monster Musume, why people can't fap with Queen Dragon Djinn?

But as far as I can remember there wasn't any time in Yugioh ever there's scene like pic related.<br><br>Is this what makes Yugioh and other chinese cartoon different?</br></br>  I wonder if anyone has ever topdecked a card they needed right exactly when they needed it and won.  <br> useless cards <br><br>Nothing in this world is useless.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to Sam and Neo New Sawatari</br>  <br><br>Serena and Yuzu have the same VA, so it's reasonable to assume the English dub will follow suit, especially since the English dubs have smaller casts.</br></br>  <br>What the hell did he do?<br><br>This looks like a play Judai would make<br><br> Is this actually a fucking manga based on Uno </br></br></br></br></br>  So, what will Reiji do when his bro doesn't want to fight?  <br> Why would a Pendulum card make a monster a tuner level 1 <br>Makes it easier to Trish</br></br>  <br>He will.</br>  <br>Replace him with Tsukikage, duh<br><br>Shun was right when he said taking Reira along was a bad idea<br><br>But in reality<br><br> It's all according to keikaku </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone pulled a Trish out on me and I was scared out of my fucking mind<br><br>No one told me that shit was unbanned</br></br></br>  Tuning Magician is definitely turning into a pendulum card to save Yuya's ass at the last moment<br>It'll probably have some level adjustment effect so he can tune Clear Wing with Odd Eyes</br>  <br> No one told me that shit was unbanned <br>It is quite frightening. I think I just did that some guy, I summoned it on his turn with Formula after he summoned an Aromage off of lonefire, and he seemed quite shocked and appalled</br></br>  <br>ENJOY</br>  God I just got this card from some black hair guy. Its pretty weak I bet he's a traitor who looks down on us common. The card is called effect veiler and it has weak attack and defense.  tell me /a/ will he ever set it?  <br>Sam pls, stop pretending we all know you cannot even read</br>  <br>Does he have yellow highlights?</br>  <br><br>Now we just need Brionac back.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and he has a criminal marking</br>  <br> Uno <br><br>Wasnt magic?</br></br></br>  <br> Brio <br> With Prince Atleantean Fucboi coming <br>Please no</br></br></br>  Why is Shingo perfect?  <br> Handsome <br> Literally undefeated <br> Lets a baka like Yuya come along on his adventures </br></br></br>  <br>Poor man's Manjoume</br>  <br>I love them both a lot, but Shingo's grown on me even more than Manjoume. I think it's because the show shits on him so much.</br>  <br><br>Well if the 3rd OP is anything to go by, Yuya and Yugo will be dueling at some point.<br><br>OP 2 was misleading and implied Yuto was going to be physically present to double team Reiji with Yuya, so OP 3 could be misleading by omitting Yuri joining the Yugo/Yuya duel and nomming Yugo.</br></br></br></br>  Yugi is a traitor because he gives out trash cards too.  <br>I'm glad they stopped flashbacking to this scene</br>  <br><br> With your power..give everyone...smiles <br><br>Yet he gave him an edgy as fuck dragon with names like Lightning disobey and Treason discharge for it's abilities. I wonder what happened to Yuto's deck. If it's anything like Speedroids I feel like it could be a fun one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuya's pendulum not glowing <br> DRXD glowing <br>What the fuck how did I not notice this earlier? Is this related to how CWSD can dimension hop?</br></br></br>  <br>According to some magazine's interview DRXD was communicating with Yuto when it glowed, which made Yuto pass Yuya DRXD.</br>  <br>Quiet you.</br>  <br> Reiji letting himself die to leave it to someone else <br> not using Yuya's LP as a shield for himself <br>Reiji trusts no one</br></br></br>  <br> Reiji trusts no one <br>Even Nakajima?</br></br>    <br>I refuse to use any subs but Mono's.<br>Guess I'll wait another week.</br></br>   The Man loses <br> Crow pretending to be Yusei <br><br>Absolutely disgusting<br><br>So is Reiji actually the plant from Fusion and Bennis is just a giant red herring?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping that Nakajima and Himika coerce Shuzo and Yoko into an elite adult dueling squadron with Shuzo as the ace, once they find out that he performed Pendulum Summoning.<br><br>Shuzo would use Xyz and Yoko would use Synchro, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br><br>goddamn nakajima stylin</br></br>  <br> Yoko would use Synchro, by the way. <br>I bet after Jack and Crow she would be the best Riding Duelist in the show.</br></br>  <br> mfw I realized she was the leader of the Maiami City Queens and she will never duel the Duel King, Jack Atlas </br>  <br> mfw realizing JACK wants to be KING throughout 5D's </br>  Quick /arc-v/, figure out a way to bully Yuya and Yuzu as much as possible in the next six episodes     Crow <br>Distracted for almost the entire match.<br> Gongenzaka <br>Focused from the beginning, keeping true to his duelling style<br><br> Crow wins <br>Explain this bullshit to me?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya and Yugo duel, Yugo goes berserk, which accidentally causes Yuya to go berserk.

I don't give a shit about what anyone else says. Fuck Fusion scum. Almost none of them are likeable bar Sora solely for being an insane asshole.  <br>I wonder if he's going to get pendulum cards soon. The level 3 and 6 RR right now make no sense by themselves.</br>  <br>Shit taste detected</br>  <br>Nope he used up his whole hand<br>First turn played 2 magnets, went down to 4 in his hand<br>Second turn played his pendulums and 3 synchro materials, down to 0</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't there a scene where Shun rejected some pendulum cards that Reiji made for him?</br>   MFW I can WAGA TAMASHI fucking Godzilla <br><br>I LOVE THIS GAME</br></br>  <br>Not cards anon, A card. It was one of Reiji's finest pranks but Shun wasn't having it</br>  <br>It was only 1 (one) pendulum card, as one of Reiji's "jokes". He has changed his mind about them since then though.</br>  <br> Some <br>It was a single pendulum card, so it was useless.</br></br>          I just want to watch Reiji duel again<br><br>what the fuck man</br></br>    <br>I don't know anymore...</br>          <br> tfw you wanna draw funny yugioh comics but never have any ideas </br>    <br>What.</br>  <br>Artists are weird man.</br>  <br>NO SELENA! YOU CANNOT SWAP CLOTHES WITH GUYS. IT DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Serena's serenas are too great for me</br>  <br>He didn't lose on purpose technically but he did help Crow out from being distracted rather than just attacking.</br>  <br>If it had been one of the other Lancers in lieu of Gon, would they have waited to attack or not? I'm thinking:<br>Sawatari → Waits, he likes to put on a good show and needs an enthusiastic duel partner<br>Dennis → Waits, Same reason as Sawatari<br>Tsukikage → Attacks, Would use whatever means is the most efficient to accomplish the mission → Attacks, Same reason as Tsukikage<br>Reiji → Attacks, Same reason as Tsukikage<br>Reira → Wildcard, Would depend on his comfort level + instructions given by Reiji<br>Yuya → Wildcard, Would depend on his EGAO level</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  KAIJU!!!! Even though they better have some nice support. They all are different type and attributes. Will be fun nonetheless  <br>I'd laugh if it turns out the Synchro had another effect that makes him win because honestly it's underpowered now. Just like Sora and his Mad Chimera again.</br>  <br>Reiji's scarf makes my dick diamonds.</br>  <br>That's just Prepared Explosives, been in the OCG for a while.<br><br>Actually, if you activate in the enemy turn ASAP and no BP is skipped, it would be the enemie's on his next turn. But since you gotta activate it in the MP, your opponent cand decide wether to enter the first BP of theirs after activation or not.</br></br></br>  <br>She's ARC-V's Lightning.<br> rude and demanding <br> abusive (carded that one LDS fag.) <br> only popular for her looks </br></br></br></br>  <br>You just don't understand the Spartan Snack Princess.</br>  <br>Serena is a strong independent version of Yuzu, sadly all Ruris will amount to damsels in distress.</br>  Holy crap, I need those Yuyas.<br>https://twitter.com/yugioh_anime/st<wbr>atus/626287342743990272</wbr></br>  why dont people just play evilswarm decks?  Yusei soon  <br>don't get your hopes up anon<br><br>only edgelords play Iswarm</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's a meme deck.</br>  <br>how so?<br>also Selena is the best girl.</br></br>  <br>Evilswarm Trish is my favorite incarnation of it so far.</br>  <br>It's just considered one of those petdecks that people hate or try to push too hard. U.A., Evilswarm, Lightsworn, HERO, etc. <br><br>It's just decks that people don't really like or generally have a bad community associated with them.</br></br></br>  <br>i can understand the bad community associated with them because only people ive seen playing a Iswarm deck are the 'neck-beard no fun for you shit talker"</br>  <br>HERO decks as well?<br>I never heard of them having a bad community.<br>on that note, I'm currently building a pure masked hero deck. any recommendations for it?</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly they do.<br><br>Yep HERO decks too, they get a lot of shit too because of the amount of cards they've gotten over the years and continue to. <br><br>A masked hero deck though, I mean you can build it in quite a few ways honestly, mostly people have 3 Shadow Mist, 2/3 Bubbleman, Summoner Monks, Goblindbergh (both at 2), Alius/Blazeman/Wildheart (whichever you feel like running or need, Blazeman typically). <br><br>Then you got shit like Reinforcement of the Army, A Hero Lives, Mystical Space Typhoon, Mask Change, Mask Charge (only at 1), Upstart Goblin, Forbidden Lance, Raigeki, Book of Moon, Fiendish Chain/Breakthrough Skill, Call of the Haunted, Oasis of Dragon Souls (1/2, preferred 1), and then a lot of the limited traps, Bottomless, Solemn, Ring of Destruction, etc. <br><br>Extra deck is usually shit like 3 Dark Law, 1 Anki, 1 Acid, Koga or Absolute Zero (depending on Alius or Blazeman or whatever), then Xyz shit like Abyss Dweller, Castel, Exciton, Excalibur, 101, Ragna Zero, Blade Armor Ninja, Photo Papillo (it can be swapped out for whatever), etc. <br><br>I mean it really depends on what you wanna run, because depending if you run more Summoner Monk and no Goblindbergh, you want more E-Emergency than you do Reinforcement, but more Reinforcement if you put Goblindbergh in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's nice to know that there are quite a few options to build this deck.<br>the image is what I've made and am currently using. if the deck looks like shit, it's because I've based it on cards that I currently own.</br></br>  <br>except those three XYZ's<br>those I've added a few minutes ago</br></br>  <br>Yusei is the only one without a partner  thats not Yusei-Go </br>  <br>I'd definitely remove Clayman and Airman and add in Bubbleman and some Goblindberghs and more Reinforcement. They really help out a lot, especially Goblin in getting to straight summon Shadow Mist from the deck, which gets his effect to get you Mask Change to get Dark Law out. Otherwise just tinker with it, I know there are a few builds here and there with stuff. I've seen some with Destiny Heroes that work well, others with random ass shit that sort of work, etc. <br><br>I'm sure you can find plenty around by goggling like Masked Heros july 15 decks or something.</br></br></br>   mfw Gongenzaka having to job for fucking Crow because muh kids <br> mfw when the lancers are looking like absolute shit right now and reiji is probably embrassed as fuck in front of those oldfag cunts <br> mfw Yuya will never be able to beat Jack's pompous face in because muh nostalgia or possibly a Yuri invasion <br> mfw I have no face. <br>arc-v pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it's Junk Warrior or Sonic Chick (which would've worked like Winged Kuriboh but that was passed on to Ruka.)</br>  <br>Nigga, Gon jobbed in a tag duel to make Yuzu look better by OTKing 2 people in one turn. That's like his thing.</br>  <br>Yes but Gongenzaka is a Lancer and with Yuya we have two losses on Reiji's shoulders. These fags are supposed to stop the second coming of Fusion Hitler and Synchro is probably face palming so hard. Please god let Sawatari win.</br>  <br>Its all part of the plan</br>  <br> Please god let Sawatari win. <br>That's even lower than Gon, especially if he's against Yuzu like one rumor says.</br></br>  <br>Id be happy with Sawatari winning but by Z-one Selena/Serena better fucking win her duel.</br>  <br>Can you even call that a job when he came up with a way for Yuzu to win and she's fucked without him. He doesn't care about giving others the spotlight so long as it ends the way he wants it to end.</br>  <br>Let them facepalm. It'd be nice to see their reaction when OERD tears up the stadium literally.</br>  <br>Blame BUY BLACKWINGS. It was Crow's first duel, no matter what he wasn't going to lose.</br>  what yu-gi-oh card would be this mans favorite?  <br>Selena is only winning if she gets fodder, Sawatari, or Tokumatsu. Basically everyone else wins if only by virtue of having their cards actually printed.</br>  <br>The Lancers are going to lose, at first. All the ones showing up in the first half of the first round will lose. Then the comeback begins on the second half when they win every duel afterwards.</br>  <br>She's dueling Dennis. She's dead jim</br>  <br> Lancers vs Lancers <br> First round <br>Is this part of Reiji's keikaku too?</br></br></br>  <br>Of course</br>  <br>Would't Dennis just hold back like last time?</br>  <br>of course, everything is</br>  <br>At least Gon had a better performance and cornered Crow only losing due to the standard weapon the Action Card after helping Crow out with his issues.<br>Speaking of Action Cards why can't Reiji program them so only Lancer duel disks accept them. Then they would be an actual advantage.</br></br>  <br>He's already lost two times this arc and needs to repay those loses.</br>  So what happened to gongenzaka?  <br>Same reason why penalty only affects the Lancers.</br>    <br> yfw every single Lancer loses and the final match is Crow vs Jack </br>  real men die first ;_;  <br>Whatever it is, I doubt it affects him much. Hard labor is nothing to him.</br>  <br><br><br> losers are sacrificed to the old man sex cult </br></br></br>  <br> Shun <br> lose <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>no way will they pull that shit.<br>but in case they do</br></br>  Melissa Claire!<br>The best announcer!<br>I want her to hug me!</br></br>  Does anyone know when we're supposed to get the next batch of episode summaries?  <br>I'm actually more interested in what happens to the losers than the actual tournament.</br>  <br>Next week Thursday or Friday <br><br>Probably Friday since it's the 7th of the month</br></br></br>  <br>Some time next week. Probably next week Thursday</br>  Almost half of the ride is over, I'll miss /a/rc-v once it's over ;_;  <br>M-Maybe if it's popular enough we'll get ARC-V 2.</br>  <br><br>Yeah im enjoying this shit too.</br></br>  What the fuck? Yugioh doesn't count as anime.  <br><br> lolis <br>CHECK<br><br> waifus <br>CHECK<br><br> EDGE <br>CHECK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What are the chances of him ever being redeemed?  <br>Yeah... who is he meant to lose against?<br> It's gonna be Yuya and Jack in the finale, that's for sure, so... Yuya vs Shun? Mid-battle motorcycle conversations regarding what happened to Yuto and Heartland and resulting in new comrades being aquired?<br>My body is so ready.</br></br></br>  <br>Redeem who? A blurry picture of Heartland doesn't give much of a hint to who you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>Shouldn't it be the week after the next? We usually get the summary batches after the last episode in the previous batch has aired.</br></br></br>  Fuck Speedroids. None of them are good because there are no good WIND Synchros bar CWSD.  <br>with even more Ruris?</br>  <br>You know who also suck? Majispecters.<br>I remember some anon whining about how overpowered they were, but in retrospect I think he was just kidding.</br></br>  <br>Speedroids only have 1 Tuner. ONE TUNER! Why couldn't they insert that triangle thing along with Red Eyed Dice? Konami hates Synchros so badly, I cannot stand it. Also they can't make good archetypes: either it's busted or underpowered (meaning balanced but that doesn't fly.)</br>    <br> 1 Tuner <br>Wait for Three-Eyed Dice, you know it's gonna happen. I'm avoiding them till they finally confirm it.</br></br>  <br>Are you jostling my nipples?<br>Yuto's archetype hasn't got shit yet either. This stuff is coming out in increments. Give it some time for more cards to come out before you brand the whole bunch worthless. <br>Or just use different ones if it bothers you so much.</br></br></br>  <br>They're giving Synchros a rest because they jerked them the fuck off before. You'll see, they'll phase out of XYZ in due course too, once how much they've damaged the game becomes apparent.</br>  <br>Honestly they should just go full blown Yusei with Yugo's monsters and make a bunch of WIND Machines Synchros that affect Speedroid monsters as well. Maken Dharma and Chanbraider are okay but they are only two of them. CWSD is irrelevant and only related by Yugo's attribute. But here's the thing: Yugo is eventually gonna get absorbed by Yuya so he can obtain Clear Wing and Yuya doesn't mess with Speedroids. I mean fuck even Yuto only had a few episodes while alive to show off Phantom Knights.</br>  <br>Don't get greedy, we all have little archetypes we wish were better.</br>  <br> Phantom Knights <br> Come out in increments <br><br>Do you live in an alternate dimension Anon?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet Konami of Heartland has already released them.</br>  Hey guys The Third Aerial Girls Squad RAW is out<br><br>http://www.bilibili.com/video/av264<wbr>4937/</wbr></br></br>  <br>but the ending with horses was stupid, what was the director thinking?</br>  <br>It's Catherine, one of the pilot girls  the one that dies at the end . Question is rather WHY are they so hellbent in rescuing her at the cost of so many planes, pilots, and soldiers?</br>  <br>WIth enough pilot skill, the plane comes second. <br>Of course, with 70s-80s planes vs 5th-gen fighters, "enough pilot skill" becomes a willing suspension of disbelief</br> </br>  <br>PANACHE!</br>  <br>how is this obvious affect of generic moe crap like Strike Witches so much better than the actual thing?</br>  New chapters were released, I don't understand why anyone would waste their time with the anime.   people thought the university girls were evil <br><br>It's called School Life for a reason.

Bummer.  <br><br>The other girls said that she's their repairman. It's a pair of pliers and a wrench or something like that. <br><br> Could make a decent improvised weapon. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Drunk rape when</br>  <br>But there are girls too, more like those who want to fight can stay and those who are weaklings have to leave</br>  <br> So, from 1 to 10. how raped the girls will leave this place? <br>I am expecting the entire university to explode. The girls would be forced to retreat back to the bunker they went to last time. I expected the bunker was designed to give the girls an out, as otherwise they would have nowhere to go. Maybe one uni girl would survive and go with them, but I don't expect that.</br></br>  <br>We got to know the uni girls more and vidya references. We have enough HAPPENING in the anime so I appreciate that the manga is taking things easy this month.</br>  <br>  https://mega.co.nz/#!C9Q0iaiK!tn5HT<wbr>ILdpjDNGMejWLcasdbj5Lh0Udc3cFIsdSla<wbr>3rM</wbr></wbr> <br>thanks</br></br>  <br> So actually nothing happened <br>Hika's ass.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, have some animated Kurumi.</br>  <br>full body version when?</br>  <br><br>just check danbooru</br></br>  <br>Anon, you monster, now i have to fap and wait for a full body version that nobody knows when will come , fuck you</br>  <br>Well it's not about HAPPENING in the sense of shit hitting the fan, it's just about something happening with the characters besides fluffy sol stuff. Most of the stuff in the chapter can be easily inferred with the help of some indirect/efficient storytelling, the only thing we got from the chapter is that the uni girls seem to basically be good people and aren't planning shit.</br>  I don't want the uni girls to die.   you'll never get drunk with the uni sluts <br>What purpose is there in not being a zombie?</br>  <br>ENOUGH, Rii. This farce needs to END.</br>  <br> the only thing we got from the chapter is that the uni girls seem to basically be good people and aren't planning shit. <br><br>They're definitely hiding something at the least.</br></br></br>  <br>Glasses is so fucking scared of losing her comfy life she's gonna be planning something soon.</br>  <br> So actually nothing happened. Bummer. <br>The show is not an action series. The girls are trying to live as normal a life as they can despite the craziness outside. If anything the theme is they are all denying reality, because the alternative is going crazy for real and kill themselves. Like that one girl who walked outside because she couldn't handle it anymore.<br><br>The girls are trying to stay as happy as they can, because despair would kill them faster than zombies could.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop being such a massive tool, shovel.</br>  <br>I feel like they're being TOO obvious with Ruu being a bear. It makes me think that we're all just being rused.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone wants that but we're going to see at least one death.</br>  <br>Maybe but the last page implies they aren't being two-faced. If anything it might be a DARK PAST secret or some other shit, but nothing more than that.</br>  <br><br>Why did your posts remind me of Captain America?</br></br>  <br><br>What, you mean you guys don't already have the 3 and a half minute long, 1920x1200 resolution, 60 fps video?</br></br>  <br>They're going to do something in the next chapter, as indicated when glasses said "she'll start doing her best tomorrow."<br><br>Also, what does Hikari do? I'm assuming she's the one that guards their shit?</br></br></br>  <br> I feel like they're being TOO obvious with Ruu being a bear. It makes me think that we're all just being rused. <br>It isn't meant to be a secret. It is meant to raise the tension of WHEN the others would have to break in the bad news, or if Big Sister would deteriorate further.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it only 2 minutes and 25 seconds?</br>  <br>I feel the same about megu-nee in the anime.</br>   Kurumi is the primary hitter (can we call her Kuu already?) <br> Mii can hold her own in combat <br> Yuki can fight too if needed (can't we call her Yuu?) <br> Aki is probably the most /fit/ out of all uni girls <br> Hika can probly use engineering tools in zombie fight <br><br>What can glasses and Rii do?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mine's 3:38 long. Though I just realized there's another version on his website, but I don't think it can be shorter in length, because it's about the same filesize.</br>  <br>It's a five second looped webm. It's not even at 1920x1200 resolution. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51591398</wbr></br>  <br>The tension isn't coming from us not knowing she's a bear and then suddenly revealing it, it's supposed to come from us noticing and always keeping in the back of our minds Rii's mental state and how everyone around her treats her.<br><br>It's damn good storytelling in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> glasses <br>Maybe the uni girls all have weapons designed by Hika.<br> Rii <br>Go crazy</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, scratch that. It is 2 minutes and 25 seconds like you said. http://www.kaitsushin.com/blog/</br>  <br> implying the car wasn't used by them to lure them in <br>they're evil alright</br></br>  <br><br>Those are samples. The full versions are in the mega link below the videos.</br></br>  <br> uni girls have weapons <br><br>Make sense, considering how the boys are STILL kept out of the Uni for so long despite having means to retake all the comfort, running water, and working generator/solar cell<br><br>Previuosly the gurashis were holding fort against zombies, this time they're holding against armed mobs?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well shit, didn't even think to check below the videos.</br>  I don't understand this picture.<br><br>Also, I wonder how the uni sluts survived at at all. Hika was responsible somehow, but they don't even have a decent shovel to whack zombies with.</br></br>  <br> having a WiiU </br>  <br>I don't think the boys know the girls have all that. I don't care how many weapons they have, If the boys really wanted to take over the girls they definitely could. They have a big manpower advantage.</br>  <br>Since I'm feeling nice, the password is inaka. I can't download the updated kurumiHD2 video for whatever reason, though.</br>  <br>I thought Splatoon needed an online connection to function in multiplayer.<br><br>Does this mean Nintendo servers didn't get affected by the zombies?</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies go home and play video games every now and then.</br>  <br>So many different rooms with TVs.<br><br>How luxurious.</br></br></br>  <br>Say what you want, but the Wii U has games.<br><br>All this Shovel and Megu-nee fanart makes me hopeful for good Mii-kun fanart next week.</br></br></br>  <br> Tofu Mii-kun. <br> Zombie = Bio = Tofu <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese NEETs survived a zombie outbreak by being NEETs.</br>  <br>So shy girl is an engineering major.</br>  <br>Realistically, if you've barricaded yourself in your room with enough supplies not to leave for months on end, you're in a pretty good position when it happens.</br>  <br> yfw Yuki(stupid) or Rii(broken) accidently revealed to the outside that they have power and running water inside the Uni (maybe by setting up light show on the rooftop at night for "festival"/Ruu asked) <br> yfw it all TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DIWN </br></br>  Is it Miki or Mii-kun?  <br>Realistically, your home is not zombie-proof, with or without barricades.<br><br><br>This picture exists, yet there's still no Shovel Chiyo.</br></br></br></br>  Yuki has the best fanart.

Because of the hose. I see, very smart (lol).</br>  Well, an underground bunker for a university must have way more food and supplies and space compared to a local highschool so I don't think anyone is gonna run out of food anytime soon.  Gakkou Gurashi guest appearance on Wooser when?  <br>What's Wooser even about?</br>  <br> Realistically, your home is not zombie-proof, with or without barricades. <br>Funny enough I know many homes in Asia probably ARE zombie proof, just because there is so much concrete, earthquake resistant reinforcement, and metal barriers to prevent burglary. The main issue is there is not enough room to store food supplies, the population density means even more zombies per square inch, and you are probably a long way away from farmland.</br></br>  Have you already prayed to megu-nee today, /a/non?  <br>What a waste of a nice body, she died without knowing the all mighty D.</br>  <br>Now you don't know that at all.</br>  The next incident isn't coming from the zombies, but from the other group who will try to get in the university. I'm telling you.  <br>No but it would be extremely painful</br>  <br><br>She died pure. PURE!</br></br>  <br>Yuki gave it to her</br>  <br>She was gangraped by vorefags.

I wish I could give all these girls a hug  <br>They all hate on Miki.

Megu-nee is cute, too!</br></br></br>  <br>What the actual fuck is this?</br>  <br>What is that expression supposed to be?</br>  <br>Something I really, really hope the anime will do properly.

Anyone else feel the same?</br>  <br>Aki is the best uni slut.</br>  <br>I think this arc is going to be about bridging the gap between the uni girls and the other group, which will probably cover developing Kurumi and Hika's conditions, and then they'll have enough people to get to Randall.</br>  <br>There's only one thing to be done  NORMIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GET OUT OF MY ROOM FUCKING NORMIES. </br>  <br>I think it's more likely that one of the Uni girls will die because of Ruu and that will snap Rii out of it.</br>    <br>Hello /r9k/, my old friend.<br><br> Just kidding, I don't have any friends. <br><br>Gekko Gouda Cheese episode 4 soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Megu-nee, wake UP  Glasses is the best thing to happen to this show  <br>I can't wait for the Randall arc. It's going to be the best.</br>  <br>As someone who's apart of the water and celery master race I tell those fat whores with disgusting eating and drinking habits to leave.</br>    <br>I don't know, the best thing about this manga is them struggling to lead as normal lives as they can given their current situation. If it turns into a story arc about figuring out the truth of the incident or finding a way to save Kurumi I think it'll lost a large part of its charm.</br>  <br>Those girls are thin as shit, nigga.</br>  <br>Sure they are fatty.</br>  <br>The third of October can't come soon enough.</br>  <br>It's not even eight of clock anon. She doesn't have to go to school yet.</br>  <br>It might or might not lose its charm. Either way, the Randall plot has been heavily foreshadowed. Eventually, they're going to go there to investigate the incident, whether we like it or not.</br>  <br>There's a reasonable chance they aren't really normalfags. Hika seems like an engineering student and / or tech otaku. Aki might have been a normie, but she probably has been converted already.</br>  I want to get beaten down to a pulp by yuki  <br>I want to be Yuki. If I put on a pink wig and a cat hat, can I beat you down?</br>  <br>She's not Koume. She can wake up whenever she wants.</br>  <br>A cute hat and wig won't hide the fact that you're old, fat and disgusting!</br>  <br>No homo</br>  <br><br>But we're all cute girls here.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi and Miki's smiles will make up for anything.</br>  <br>I'm kind of unsure that Ruu is a bear, she might be something else.<br>Re-reading the part where crossbow-kun tries to shoot Ruu seemed kind of weird if Ruu was just a teddy bear.</br></br>  <br>He didn't try to shoot Ruu, he shot Yuuri because he told them to drop everything and she didn't.<br><br> I bet he gets a scratch and comes begging to the other group when he gets kicked out. </br></br></br>  <br>You're right, she's one of the lizard men that unleashed the plague in the first place and is mind controlling Rii.<br><br> She's the fucking bear, mate. </br></br></br>  <br>How long do we have to wait until we see yuki completely lose it? Or has she passed that stage permanently already? With the manga looking like it's still has a lot more to show I want to see more despaired breakdowns</br>  <br>Crossbow-kun wasn't trying to shoot the Ruu, what the fuck is wrong with you. He freaked out because Rii wouldn't drop it, he was aiming for her.</br>  <br>It works well enough for Yuki. She has hair sticking out of her ears, obvious old man in disguise.</br>  <br><br>Thats what I thought at first, but when Kurumi blocks his bolt and is approaching towards him, he was really hesitant to shoot her.<br>Unless he only had one bolt, but I thought I recalled him loading another.</br></br></br>  <br>He just saw what Kurumi did, of course he was hesitant to shoot again.</br>  <br>Of course he's hesitant, a potential zombie just made an impossible block and is now advancing towards him while rolling to intimidate.</br>  <br><br>That fucking matrix bullshit is the only part of the manga I disliked. She fucking threw a shovel at an arrow in midflight and blocked it, what the fuck.</br></br>  <br>She's gone full Alice.</br>  <br>indeed mistranslation.</br>  I want to fuck Aki.  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>and also mind the text on the top left hand corner of the page.. (sorry that the image is rotated</br>  <br>"Is that, the legendary big five of Megurigaoka?"<br><br>Battle shounen arc incoming.</br></br></br>  <br> Is that the armed fighting faction? <br><br>something like that</br></br></br>  <br>No, shovel failed to block the arrow. The arrow simply missed. The shovel thrown out hurt Ri-san's leg.</br>  <br>Your blind anon. The arrow stopped in front of Rii, so it was stopped by Kurumi.</br>  <br>Where do you find the passwords for the rest of the stuff in the page?</br>  <br><br>yeah she threw the shovel<br>she is defenseless now</br></br></br>  <br>and,</br>  <br>It goes skidding off in the complete opposite direction she threw it, while the bolt stops. She blocked it.<br><br><br>She picked it up again.</br></br></br></br>  Is tolerance for the mentally ill a major sub-theme for this manga?<br><br>It showed Yuki was acting loony within limits of reason, and now Rii-san-chan has been traumatized and everyone's trying to help her along.</br></br>  <br>Look anon I know you don't have any so you wouldn't get it but that's what friends do for each other.</br>  <br>I mean there won't be anything on the level of classroom scene. She might despair for other reasons like people dying and such but the breaking down due to delusions is already a checked box</br>  <br>The passwords I've found are inaka, mikkago, nyaa, paradise, and kaitsushin. The first two are for the newer stuff and the latter three are for the older stuff. Just keep on trying until one of them works.</br>  <br><br>Lol what, he obviously shot "Ruu" (i.e. the bear). He was just trying to disarm Rii so he shot the place where she could potentially be hiding something, the fucking scene implies this by having him shot "Ruu" and having Rii step in to "block" the shot.<br><br>You two should reread that part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br> Look anon I know you don't have any so you wouldn't get it but that's what friends do for each other. <br>Yeah but now there's these new chicks and there's a good chance that they might shove Rii's face rudely into reality if they're not as kind, observant and tolerant as Miki was</br></br>  <br>Lol what? I think you need to reread it. He shot at Rii because paranoia gripped him when she wouldn't drop the bear.</br>  <br><br>see distance between the arrows' shadow and shovel's shadow. Plus the arrow is going down head-first so it have not been rebounce before it fall.</br></br>  <br>He literally explains that he shot because you can't trust anyone not to be infected / a zombie.</br>  She's dead already, isn't she?<br><br>It makes no sense they'd find her out there just like that.<br><br>And it seemed like only Yukki saw her.</br></br></br></br>  So the gist of the whole university matter is this:<br> big five started taking extreme measures to stop people from getting infected <br> the three girls at the university got bitten, used the serum and got superpowers like Kurumi, which is why they're able to hold their ground against them <br>So, battle shonen arc incoming?</br></br></br>  <br>True enough. But they don't know the bear is Rii's pretend sister yet, just that the girls call it "Ruu".</br>  <br><br>Look at where the emphasis is placed. This repeats in the first page of the next chapter and that also has a panel with Rii "covering" for Ruu.<br><br>He shot to disarm her and his bullshit explanation was just about trusting/mistrusting people, not about whether shooting the infected is mandatory.<br><br>Also the translation of that dialogue is fucked because the retard who translated the chapter was in full delusion about Ruu being real and interpreted the dialogue according to his headcanon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>See the fact that the shovel fucking spins out in the opposite direction it was thrown. The bolt collided with the shovel, rebounded, and fell. How do you think a shot that a page ago was aimed directly at her heart is suddenly falling to the ground some distance away, a sudden downdraft?</br>  <br> &gt;the three girls at the university got bitten, used the serum and got superpowers like Kurumi, which is why they're able to hold their ground against them <br>There is nothing to suggest any of this. All that's been said is that they had a disagreement and left.</br></br>  <br>The shovel touched the arrow, and the impact makes the shovel change direction and fly towards Rii, while the arrow falls to the ground. The panel shows you the moment right after the shovel and the arrow impacted each other.</br>  <br><br><br>Why no decent scans yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as the helmet bros and guy with crossbow were pretty paranoid about people getting infected, it's a pretty reasonable assumption that something more than a simple disagreement happened here.</br>  <br>Of course she's covering her, they're both standing next to each other and being shot at. I doubt she had the time to think about where exactly it's being aimed.</br>    <br>Maybe they just have the same policy as Yuki.</br>  <br> How the hell did you do this? </br>  <br>A disagreement about what to do with people who were very slightly wounded. The last page of this chapter shows Hika (I think) with a bandaid. I doubt it'll go battle shounen, but it seems likely that one of more of them have had some contact with the virus.</br>  <br>I agree. One of them might have been bitten, but there's nothing to suggest that yet. It just as well could have been that one of their friends was killed or expelled for suspected infection and they broke off because of that.<br><br> In fact, if one of them had been bitten and the other group new about it, there's no way the Uni girls would still be aloud to live in the campus with how paranoid the other group is.</br></br></br>  <br>If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel, then Rii damn sure had the time to see where the arrow was going. This doesn't even require thinking, it's instinctive. Try throwing something against a wall and have it bounce back, the position it's going towards is impossible to miss especially if it's below your eyeline.<br><br>The first anon thought it was weird Crossbow dude would shoot "Ruu" if it was just a bear, which also shows he interpreted the scene as him shooting there (the correct way to interpret it, that's what the panneling and composition is asking you to do). The explanation is very simple (he shot to disarm).</br></br></br>  <br>I want to cum inside this little delusional semen demon.</br>  <br> The last page of this chapter shows Hika (I think) with a bandaid <br>I think it's Aki.</br></br>  <br> If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel, then Rii damn sure had the time to see where the arrow was going <br>I don't think Rii had time to calculate anything. She just covered her "sister" by instinct.</br></br>  <br>Shovel is hopped up on zombie juice and going Alice on us.</br>  <br>"He's aiming for me, not the bear right next to me" is not instinctive. "I'm being shot at, I need to protect my little sister" is. What Kurumi did is pretty clearly impossible for a normal human, so bringing that up isn't really relevant. The entire conversation with Kurumi being angry and him saying that anyone could be infected makes no sense if everyone is aware that he wasn't aiming to kill or wound, and neither does the previous chapter's cliffhanger.</br>  <br> If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel <br>And why do you think that is?</br></br>  All hail Megu-nee.  <br>Why weren't my teachers this cute and sweet when I was in high school?</br>  <br> everyone is aware that he wasn't aiming to kill or wound <br>I never said everyone was aware of this, much less consider the situation rationally (not even the dude was calm there). They perceive hostility from him and he won't back up, but he didn't shoot to kill. The fact he didn't shoot to kill is not even the point of the scene, just something that we readers infer from knowing (assuming) Ruu is not real (otherwise he'd have shot to kill of course).</br></br>  <br> Having a Mega Drive <br>I found my waifu now</br></br>  <br>would you kiss an infected ?</br>  <br>A lot of your teachers probably had been like that in the past.

Like how Schwarzer Regen and Rafael Revive look like flying tanks while experimental units like Blue Tears look more futuristic. White Knight looking super futuristic and advanced is kind of silly though when its the first IS ever made.</br></br></br>  <br>Houki's are nicer.</br>  <br> White Knight looking super futuristic and advanced is kind of silly though when its the first IS ever made. <br>That's because its made by Tabane, and Tabane tech is like two decades ahead of the rest of the world. She just handed out cores and laughed as everyone else desperately tried to figure out how to work them. Most IS are just conventional weapons frankensteined onto Tabane's super tech while Tabane keeps all the best toys for herself.</br></br>  <br>There's such a thing as too big and this is it.</br>  I'm disappointed we didn't get a follow-up to this for S2. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9jH<wbr>V-8TmG_k</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> THIS EZ TATENASHI IMOUTO <br> HER NAME IS KANZASHI <br> IF YOU ASK MY OPINION <br> SHE IS REALLY SHITTY </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pls no bully the hairclip</br>  <br>Why is she so shitty?</br>  <br>Is she wearing a fucking ribbon as an earring?</br>  <br>It's the back of her headband.<br><br>Actually that picture is perfect.

She just has an inclination towards the shonen genre because that's where those "Hero" kind of storytelling is more prominent.</br>  Why do people hate Kanzashi so much? She's qt as fuck.  Hmm... I think Homura is trying to tell us something...  <br>Will he follow the footsteps of the one doing the Kampfer (Shizuku wins the Natsurium despite losing to Akane in the LN) wherein Chifuyu will definitely win in the end of his run even though it was another girl?</br>  <br>She's definitely better than some of others</br>  <br>Jesus fucking titty christ Homerun Houki needs to get some breast reduction surgery stat if she doesn't want to have back pains for the rest of her life.</br>  <br>But she thinks Ichika likes breasts.</br>  <br> Gook </br>  <br> But she thinks Ichika likes breasts. <br>Well he does.<br>As long as they're attached to Chifuyu-nee.</br></br></br>  <br> they're as big as her head <br>Dear god.</br></br>  <br><br>So...is Tabane the user of the White Knight? And by default is the White Knight the most powerful IS?</br></br>  <br> So...is Tabane the user of the White Knight? <br>Are you denser than Ichika.<br>Does this look like Tabane to you.</br></br></br>  <br>Tabane's IS is Devil Gundam, capable of terraforming an entire planet.</br>  You know, I just had a thought.<br><br>Even for a shitty light novel series, it's too big of a coincidence that Chifuyu is the most talented IS pilot in the world and her little brother just happens to be the only male in the world that can pilot the IS.<br><br>So what if they were engineered that way? What if they're actually test-tube babies designed to pilot IS from the start. What if the big twist is that their parents were the ones who started the IS project in the first place, the world's most powerful superweapon disguised as space research. And let's not stop at Chifuyu and Ichika, what if Tabane and Houki were also genetically engineered children designed to further the goals of Mr. and Mrs. Orimura and their associates? Tabane is a child genius who singlehandedly completed the IS project before she even hit 15. What if she was literally bred and raised to be a super genius by a shadowy evil organization to finish their superweapon project for them?<br><br>And what if Mr. and Mrs. Orimura disappeared because Tabane realized what they were up to and didn't want them using her, Chifuyu, and their siblings for nefarious purposes? So she rebelled and hijacked their project from right underneath their noses. Faced with their creation rebelling, the Orimuras retreated with their final child, Madoka, while Tabane and Chifuyu purposefully exposed the IS for the world to see with the White Knight incident and distributed IS cores around the world so that they wouldn't be in the hands of a single dubious shadowy organization, but in the hands of many nations all set in a cold war against each other, neutralizing the threat of IS being used for warfare. But somewhere along the line Tabane and Chifuyu had a falling out and went their separate ways because even though Tabane cared deeply for her close friends and did all of this to protect them, she was too twisted by her upbringing and drove Chifuyu away with her extreme methods.<br><br>I'm just saying, this could be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly thought I was looking at a Xenogears fanart from the thumbnail of OP</br>  <br>Well, it is the same artist and all.</br>  <br> like Scryed or Sacred Seven but with the plot of Showa Kamen Rider. <br>I'm erect.</br></br>  anyone happen to know the nationalities of the two new girls that were introduced  <br>Daryl is an American 3rd year. As for Forte, not sure. By her name definitely European.</br>    <br>I'm glad there's finally an American girl in the harem.</br>  <br>Cecilia a shitty generic character, popular only because bongs are deluded fags.</br>  <br>I think those two are lesbians though. In the group shot in Vol 10, they were holding hands.</br>  <br>I don't think they are. Look at this portrait of the cast, Daryl and Forte are holding hands and looking at each other pretty lovingly. I think they're yuri.</br>  <br><br><br>Tina would make a better addition to the cast anyways.</br></br></br>  <br> Daryl and Forte are holding hands and looking at each other pretty lovingly. <br><br>wow, I never actually noticed that. I wouldn't mind some yuri lovin'</br></br></br>  <br>Truth.</br>  <br>I can't recall much of Tina's character. All I remember was that she was Rin's roommate and that she was weight conscious but loved french fries.</br>  <br>woops meant to reply to </br>  So, Twintails girl in white bikini. What's her name again?  <br>That's too well thought out and clever for Yumizuru to think up.</br>  So volume 4 of the manga and volume 10 of the LN just got released recently?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>If you want to see volume 10 scans <br/></br>  <br>I can't really conceive of Tabane doing anything for any reason besides her own amusement or curiosity. I mean, she custom built a top of the line IS for the world's second deadliest woman/super-terrorist essentially for a giggle. Tabane is a mad supervillain.</br>  Is the manga by Homura Yuuki still going strong?  <br>Is the manga developing an overarching plot or what?</br>  <br>I think it's all to train Ichika and Houki for something. The drones, the aid to phantom task, the incidents . It seems like Tabane is testing them and showing off to the world.</br>  <br>The books were making a half-assed attempt at introducing an overarching plot occasionally, so naturally the manga is cleaning that up and spacing out the elements of it better (e.g. Chifuyu comments on the Golem's origins after it's attack).<br><br>Other plot stuff I noticed in general includes Chifuyu securing the Golem II IS cores herself for some purpose and reporting them destroyed, as well as Houki's mysterious jump in IS compatability.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuckin hell. <br><br>Infinite Stratos can be saved if Ichika was a better protaganist. Instead they think adding in more girls is the way to go. <br><br>Please make him less dense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's actually pretty decent in the YH reboot.</br>  <br>You're essentially correct. She arranged for hundreds of nuclear strikes on her own country and deliberately set a superweapon on a rampage (with the pilot still inside), she needs people to know she's better than them.<br><br><br>This was mine, meant to reply to</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it's to drive Ichika and Houki together. All of it. Tabane doesn't care about the others, she basically told Cecilia to fuck off to her face. Plus, if Houki and Ichika marry, Chifuyu becomes the new sister in law.</br>  <br><br> He's actually pretty decent in the YH reboot. <br>You're goddamn right.<br><br>Though of course he was actually pretty decent at first in the novels as well.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The nuclear incident also cleared the board of nukes, perhaps the only weapon to beat an IS. She now has a monopoly on WMD.</br>  <br>I don't think she launched the world's entire arsenal, just a lot of it.<br> She now has a monopoly on WMD. <br>Yeah, I'd noticed that. It's why I can't regard Phantom Task as a real threat, they're so smalltime. They seem to e trying to take over the world, but Tabane did it ages ago.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was implied that Tabane did it for the sake of the Orimuras (who are basically the only people outside of her family she gives a shit about) and Houki (because Ichika being able to pilot an IS puts him at the academy with Houki, making up for their separation due to the invention of IS all the years prior)<br><br>More or less that Tabane could fix the 'female only" part of IS if she gave a shit, but she didn't beyond designing a singular specific exemption for Ichika.</br></br></br>  Is this the face of a true hero?  <br>Pic related is the face of a true hero</br>  <br>face of a serious hero for a hobby<br><br>face of a serious hero</br></br></br>  <br>Licenseless Rider is confirmed GOAT.</br>  <br>Nah, that's just some ordinary hobbyist.<br><br><br>This nigga, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Even though saitama does it for a hobby doesn't mean he isn't a true hero.

Thats a really retarded cliche that only kids find truthful. Hero is first and foremost someone who puts needs of others before his own, and yes, sometimes it means sacrificing his life. But simply throwing your life away without achieving anything is plain psychotic.</br>  <br>thats the point, he knows how weak he is, but he doesnt want people to lose hope, he wants them to know someone is willing to die for them by charging towards a foe that in comparison is practically untouchable, to go against all odds, he's a light of hope.</br>  No, this is the face of a true hero. Nevar 4get.  <br>Squealer did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Didn't he distract the sea king from genos, therefore saving his life? You know, just like Genos sacrificed himself to save that kid in the previous?</br>  alright where the FUCK do you get new murata chapters? they got taken off of batoto because of licensed anime bullshit.
