[                 She returns to full creep mode this time.          tomoko reached a new depth of autism previously unknown to man   This whole chapter <br><br>Thanks for the dump</br></br>  I thought the author got their hand crushed or something. All better now, I assume?  I seriously can't stand this bitch.<br>What is wrong with her.<br>she is so pitiful it is cringeworthy but she takes it as a point of pride.<br><br>I only popped in this thread after a not being in these since the penis incident, people still big on buying it? Its just painful to read.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had that happen to me a couple of months ago. I thought I would be able to have a nice night alone, but the guy I was staying with stayed in for like 3 hours in the hotel room with me.</br></br>  WHAT THA FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! IS ANON TROLLING ME WITH A FAKE CHAPTER?! TOMOKO CAN'T BE THIS AUTISTIC  Poor Sheep-chan  <br>Confirmed slut</br>  <br>the fuck. haven't read this in awhile but when did she lost her virgin pussy?</br>  <br><br>She's lying, obviously.</br></br>  <br>You serious? who would touch her? She's terrifying.</br>  <br> tfw I've been Tomoko in that page before <br>The pain of reading it is almost unbearable</br></br>  Holy shit this chapter.  Jesus fuck, why do people like her again?  <br>self-inserting is a powerful thing</br>  <br>she makes me feel better about myself<br><br> even though she's fictional </br></br></br>  I wanna stroke Tomoko's unkempt pubes  <br>How many irredeemable selfish, self-centered assholery has tomoko done? Has someone made a list?<br><br>The one the sticks out is when she was being a lazy bitch and didn't mail her brother's school application in. That's some life changing shit there</br></br></br>  <br>Because despite her total ineptitude at anything involving communication with other people I still have slight hope for her.</br>  Did the author got a relapse? I thought this trip was going to end with something good happening.  <br>WHY<br>DOES<br>TOMOKO<br>NEVER<br>LEARN?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people just want to watch the world burn.</br>  <br><br><br>I dunno, I think she was funny and so boss this chapter. It's so rare for a chapter to have Tomoko be so confident and having the upper hand.<br><br>When you watch moeshit, do it with pride. Fuck what anyone else thinks.</br></br></br></br></br>  This entire school trip story has been hilarious thing one after another. Kind of surprised at how many chapters it lasted too.  <br>Another one falls victim to Tomoko.</br>  Every time they release such a messy chapter I can't help but think that 4chan sending them all those penises has something to do. Like that must be quite a traumatizing experience that changes your life forever.  <br> why do people like her again <br>But nobody likes her, that's the whole point. You're supposed to feel kinda sorry for her, but she's actually a terrible person.</br></br>  THIS IS NOT THE ENDING I WANTED NOR EXPECTED  <br>shes lying her ass off like she always does in hopes it makes her sound cool, or because she wants to talk down to the other girl. Ether or, maybe both.</br>  <br>Actually, I think everything become better after the penis spam, maybe we need to send her some more again?</br>  <br>New mokoface :3</br>  <br>die</br>  i waited a month for this  <br>What kind of feelings is this image trying to convey?</br>    <br>She's a complex one. <br> <br>She lacks any sort of social skills or understanding (probably aspie) yet desparately wants to be liked. Despite wanting to be popular, in her mind she talks down and insults those who are popular, probably out of her deep-seeded frustration for not being able to be one of them. It looks so easy for them, yet she has the hardest time just talking. <br> <br>I root for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's not really "terrible". The worst she does is tease the other girl about being a virgin. She acts superior because she spends her whole life feeling inferior. The truth is we've all done this sort of thing. Just like her appearance is plain, Tomoko is actually normal in this sense, its just that she fails to self censor sometimes.</br></br>  <br><br>Personally I prefer Tomoko at her lowest, so a lot of the field trip has been kinda dull for me.<br>This chapter was a fantastic return to form, though. Probably even worth the wait.</br></br></br>  <br> shower <br> panties <br> yuri anime <br> sleeping girl molested <br>The doujin are writting themselves</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People wont take advantage of it.<br><br>Very few pictures even draw her with pubes even though she's confirmed to have them</br></br></br>  <br>/a/nons spend so long putting women on pedestals of unattainable purity, the thought of a loser who spends all day masturbating is a pleasant refresher of "hey this person could actually like me for who i am"</br>  <br>Well, then we have to draw it by ourselves. /a/'s talent is limitless to my balls</br>  <br>I love Tomoko.</br>  well that was painful to read  <br> slut </br>  I just wanna platonic snuggle her scrawny body while we watch anime or play vidya.<br><br>No sex, just some friendly skinship to stave off the pain of being alone</br></br>  man i was expecting some titanic-tier fuckup, not some background character  Emoji girl lewds when  <br>She is creep as fuck</br>  <br>eh, I think we actually get a decent amount of pictures of her, and her pubes. A lot of people figure her for a fuzzy pants girl and go for that. We certainly get a lot more picture of her with pubes than we do with most characters.</br>      <br>Fucking Japan, not even in hotels bathrooms have locks?</br>  I had to get up and pace around the room 3 times during this.<br><br>Fucking Watamote.</br></br>  Tomoko did nothing wrong<br>I hope she takes better care of her pubes from now on.</br>  <br>I wonder how out of control they were.</br>  <br>That's what she was doing in that chapter? I though she was trying to modify her clothes for some reason</br>  <br>It was heavily implied, are you one of those "Gently walked her home" people?</br>  <br>There was a mistranslation on the first page where she should be thinking about pubes, so it's understandable to miss</br>      I had a dream about Tomoko last night    <br><br/></br>  Can´t wait until we reach adult Tomoko everyday, we will taste true despair  <br>She'll be fucking her brother by then, so she'll be alright.</br>  <br>She wishes.<br><br>We better get a good Tomoki dose after the school trip.</br></br></br>  <br> long day </br>  <br> Don't tell Zed <br><br>What does it mean?</br></br></br>  <br>because gary stu SAO is popular and we need something to counter the injustice</br>  <br>She's funny.</br>  <br>Have you never watched Gentlemen in Dark Suits?</br>  <br>That she's a failed slut</br>  <br>I was under the impression that the school trip was the first time she had even considered shaving them and that they were completely unkempt. She's such a filthy girl.</br>  <br>Not him, but are you referring to Personnel in Coal-Coloured Attire?</br>  <br>Oh jesus christ, it's gonna be PunPun all over again</br>  damn where's 70-79  <br>If you arnt planing to be naked why shave your pubes or keep them neat?</br>  I want to murder Tomoko.  <br>Why?</br>  <br>To free her from the misery of her horrible and suffering filled life.</br>  <br>There is a much simpler method.</br>  <br>I'm not following you here</br>  <br>So you also think to murder all the /a/nons only to deliver us from our suffering?</br>  damn...  Wait, this isn't that girl she sat next to in class and got somewhat friendly with is it?  <br>/a/nons lifes arent serialized so i don't care about misery of anyone here. <br>Hell, you niggas aren't even cute.</br></br>  <br>No, that's Nemo.</br>  <br>I'm cute. pic related, it's me</br>    <br>Christ, Tomoko. She was making such progress throughout this whole trip and then she decides to go full retard on poor little Sheep-chan.</br>  So the smile-girl's name is "Ucchi", or it's just her nickname?<br><br>...that's right, Tomoko is lonely, barely has friends, but she did make some incidents before, such as fail at self-introduction, accidently injured herself during the school festival, kill a cockroach in front of everyone, searching erotic picture at class and caught, being dissed by the homeroom teacher out of publicly,<br>So Tomoko's classmates may at least has some impression of her. It's a bit weird that Tomoko's field trip teammates act like they just know this person first time...</br></br></br>  Did world-three drop this? Their mega only goes up to 69.  <br>Sounds like a nickname. The -cchi part gives it away.<br> Mokocchi <br><br>Based Spaghetti-tan</br></br></br></br>  <br> you niggas aren't even cute. <br>Hidoi</br></br>  <br> Spaghetti-tan <br>I hate that nickname</br></br>  People who hate Tomoko are literally hating themselves tbh  <br>Isn't world-three dead?</br>  <br> If I hadn't lost in Rock, Paper, Scissors, I wouldn't be stuck rooming with someone like her <br><br>Wait a minute, who did she lose this game against? Delinquent-chan and the other girl? They all hate Tomoko?</br></br></br>  <br> DAYUM <br>Thought the same thing.</br></br>  <br><br>Dead.<br><br>Based Gospel.<br><br> http://gospel.みんな/ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes<br>for a long time</br></br>  The art isnt getting any better  <br>Who reads a comedy manga for the artwork?</br>  <br>Just in case a rapist like Tomoko decides to walk in on you in the shower.</br>  <br>good I couldn't sleep too</br>  <br>She's trying damn it!</br>  <br>Delinquent-chan is just tsundere for Tomoko.</br>  <br>I knew that Tomoko had an awkward relationship with the others but I didn't think that they all hated her.</br>  I really wish the author could start developing more her character. The manga is not as pupolar as it uses to be and it's only a matter of time before it gets canned and i dont want it to finish the same qay it started  <br>Girls don't have autism</br>  <br>They had drafts done up to the end of this arc that they had a guest artist come and help finish. They're kind of sketchy about how serious her injury actually is, and it's not unheard of for people to lose their book to another artist in a situation like this, which she's been joking about on twitter. But it would actually be really sad if this one thing that's been her most successful work is stolen and given to a different artist by her publisher.</br>  <br>Wasn't it the writer that got his hand crushed, not the artist?</br>  <br> she is so pitiful it is cringeworthy but she takes it as a point of pride. <br>As she should. Her uniqueness leaves disbelievers speechless</br></br>  <br>Look, as much as that is true, considering what we have see so far of Tomoko, that has less chance of happening than /a/non not becoming a wizard. The closest she's going to get to sex is with another girl.</br>  <br/>  <br>I don't actually like Tomoko, in fact I resent what she stands for as a human being.<br>I just enjoy her suffering.</br></br>  <br> じー <br>I lost my shit there, Tomoko confirmed for lesbian rapist.</br></br>  <br><br>she perfectly embodies the life of /v/</br></br>  <br>because she's me</br>  <br> emoji <br><br>wat?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish people like you would die right now</br>  <br>more like lucky Sheep-chan.</br>  <br>Calm down Tomoko he doesn't really mean it</br>  <br>her face is literally a smiley</br>  Stay classy, Tomoko.  <br><br>Everyone's felt anxious or pitiful in a similar manner at one point or another. She invokes empathy even if you don't feel sympathetic towards her.</br></br>  What chapter does the anime end at?  <br>28</br>  People are starting to think poorly of her.  <br>So there is enough material for a second season? That's good news, it must air soon right?</br>  <br>Sold like shit.</br>    How I'd like to see Watamote end:<br><br> Tomoko is feeling depressed over how the trip ended <br> gets into drugs to numb the pain <br> alienates her friends and family in drunken stupor <br> gets booted out of her home <br> falls into prostitution to support her drug habit <br> gets beaten by her pimp if she doesn't pull enough customers <br> forced to have many abortions <br> gets into harder drugs like Heroin and Krocodil  <br> her youth passes her by <br> she lays down in a gutter somewhere <br> crippled by the pussy pounding over the years <br> flesh on her arms and legs is rotting away <br> wonders where she went wrong in life <br> remembers her friends and family and closes her eyes <br> dies </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That so?<br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> ShindoL </br>  <br>ShindoL, no one wants your take on Watamote.</br>  <br>She decided to shave them after seeing the other girls at the hot springs, I'm guessing she saw enough of them to feel self conscious and unkempt and wanted to emulate them.</br>  I want to see Yuu and delinquent-chan meeting each other. I really want her to become part of the circle.  <br> gets into harder drugs like Heroin and Krocodil  <br>you stupid mate nobody uses desomorphine outside of a few stupid cunts cooking it up in russia.</br></br>  <br>That award is for another, sorry.</br>  <br> Krocodil <br>Fucking Russians, even the drugs they take are more batshit insane than everyone else.</br></br>  <br> delinquent go full lesbo for Yuu <br> take her away from Tomoko <br>Get the fuck off with your NTR.</br></br></br>  <br> become acquaintances <br> obviously hardcore yuri subtext that only your special eyes can see <br><br>This is you. Reflect and grow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but that's the point. it will finish the same way. tomoko will remain to be the hopeless sack of shit she is because she doesn't learn</br>  <br>Hiroyuki Imaishi now running the scores at Trigger, who just finished the highly crowdfunded Little Witch Academia and following the success of Kill la Kill, anything is open game.<br><br>I'm pretty sure if he managed to obtain the rights, he could get PSG season 2 on the rails in no time. Imagine how many would throw money at him via kickstarter for another season or an OVA/Movie.<br><br>Fuck, I'd throw more than I'd like to admit for a Kill la Kill slice of life OVA at the beach.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delinquent-chan have an obvious sexual tension with Tomoko, she like the V , now imagine she meeting Yuu, she, no, anyone would go nuts over her.</br>  <br>We can dream, brother.<br>We can dream.</br></br>  I thought the japanese didn't shave?  <br><br>Is there any reason to NOT at least give fans the option of crowdfunding a project? If the fans pay for it, what do production companies have to lose? Why isn't everything done like this?</br></br>  <br>Stop reading ShindoL</br>  <br>Hasn't it become more popular there now that the women realise all men love little girls?</br>   nichijou crossover     <br>She is doing awful things pretty often, but there is just something so romantic and honest about her, you know? She's the first one to notice the frailness and shortcomings in both herself and other people, and other times she's laughing at the face of the world for being able to see something they don't. She's a true punk.</br>  The field trip is over...so finally, we gonna see Imae senpai again?  <br>I would assume so. Japanese aren't exactly known for being all that hairy in the first place though.</br>  <br>Well you very rarely see shaved actresses in porn because of their censorship laws, pubic hair is half of a natural censor by itself.</br>  This bitch can't get her mind of Tomoko, she's in love now.  <br>That's of a rape victim if I ever saw it.</br>  <br> Tadakuni and Tomoko bonding over being unpopular </br>  <br>They trim.</br>  Penis! Ah man penis! This chapter made me feel even more uncomfortable than the one where she lied about that guy being her boyfriend. It's definitely the most cringeworthy chapter in a long time.  <br>But Tadakuni was far from unpopular. He actually had friends who regularly hang out with him and is generally fitting in with his classmates.</br>  <br> That's of a rape victim <br>the face of*</br></br>  <br><br>you have a hard time dealing with her and that is just tiring.</br></br>  <br>anon...</br>  <br>Sheep is having trouble comprehending Tomoko's actions because she doesn't realize that Tomoko is retarded.</br>  <br><br>I love that the successor is also a battle network reference.</br></br>  <br>She's right to be afraid considering Tomoko really does molest girls in their sleep.</br>  <br>God I wish I could draw like that</br>  I'm trying to work out if Watamote has always been shit or if it just the new chapters  <br><br>That's pretty normal, though.</br></br>  <br>Do it then</br>  <br>if you ever can then don't change her into a generic bitch three pages later</br>  <br>I wouldn't even know where to begin.</br>  <br>Just do it, why are you such a coward?</br>  <br/>  <br>Totally normal. Tomoko is a normal girl.</br>  Why is Tomoko such a  faggot?   <br>otaku culture taught her to sexualize schoolgirls</br>  <br>A bit late, but maybe she was referencing that time when she was playing a vn or something and accidentally slammed her womb into something, which to her, simulated the pain of losing her virginity.</br>  <br><br>Well I know how hard it is for me to deal with the fact that I'll never be a yuri schoolgirl and snuggle my schoogirl friends.<br><br>I can imagine how insane it'd drive me to be so close yet so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get this part, since when Tomoko can talk so much without stuttering with a stranger?</br>  <br>Read </br>  How did Tomoko end up being a retarded douchebag anyways?<br>Like, there's that spin off about her younger years but she's already a lost case there.<br>We never get to see how she became like that.</br></br>  <br> She's not really "terrible". <br><br>Did you forget the part where she tries to ram and wound her little cousin with a bike, nevermind that said cousin just spent time teaching her how to ride a bike?<br>Did you forget the part where her bother couldn't get into his preferred school because Tomoko didn't send his application (something she was told to do because Tomoki couldn't be here at the time)?<br>Did you forget how much she internally insults everyone around her? It's like she hates humanity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Official  Heroin  addict here.<br>I've tried desomorphine once. It's terrible, you can't compare it to other  opiates . <br><br>But I get  morphine  now from the  substitution program</br></br></br></br>  <br> heroin <br>Trully the most pleb drug right after weed.</br></br>  <br><br> pleb <br>You don't know shit mate.

She's made great strides in her ability to speak to others. The only problem now is what she's actually saying to them.</br>  <br>why didn't you just leave the room?</br>  <br> Did you forget how much she internally insults everyone around her? It's like she hates humanity. <br><br>I though everyone does it.</br></br></br>    Tomoko being a lying piece of shitstain again <br><br>No<br><br>Fuck this, dropped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was exposed to anime at a young age.</br>  <br>Who exposed her?</br>  <br>TV</br>  <br><br>I watched anime young and I didn't turn like her.<br>Then again I mostly watched sports anime as a kid, I didn't learn about hentai until I saw some captures of PC-98 event pics on the net.</br></br></br>  <br> I didn't learn about hentai until I saw some captures of PC-98 event pics on the net. <br>I found one on random retrogame CD I bought<br><br>It changed me forever</br></br></br></br>  I'm glad it didn't end horribly.<br><br>I guess we'll never see delinquent and whatserface again, though.</br></br>  <br>did you suck his dick you faggot</br>  Yazawa Nico is the N°1 Idol in the entire universe.

Like someone roughly threw her on the bed and she hit it against the wall/headboard. Looks like rape to me.</br>  <br><br>Go back to Dragon Ball threads. Even Nico's feces is too royal for you.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you</br>  <br>Maybe she's just resting up in her hotel room after a rough plane ride</br>  <br>Good hypothesis, but I must bring to your attention the right side of the image? See that? Shoes. A Japanese person, especially an image-conscious teenage girl, wouldn't be caught dead wearing shoes in bed, much less indoors. Look at her knees, locked together as if in pain, and her face. It's not a face of weariness or exhaustion, but of pain. No sir, she's not resting up, she's definitely about to get raped.</br>  <br> No sir, she's not resting up, she's definitely about to get raped. <br>Please, no</br></br>  <br>If you ask me she was begging for it wearing that outfit.

Can I be crowned #1 Nicoposter?</br>  <br>But Nico has the body of a loli m8</br>  Get your little Nico outta here, anon.<br><br>Gotta love veebu's art.</br></br>  <br>Nico is not even really underheight, she's 154cm, which is a first year high school girl's average height. Given, she's a 3rd year, and the average at that age is 157cm, but it's really a little difference.<br>For example, Im@s's Yayoi is 145cm, and Hibiki is 150cm. Haruka/Yukiho is the same height as Nico.</br></br>  <br>And how is that a bad thing? She also has an amazing ass.<br>And more to the point, you mentioned the age as if it had anything to do with being a loli.</br></br>  <br>Hey, that's cute.</br>  <br>Holy shit iM@S girls are tiny</br>  Which songs are each muses' (and A-rises' if you like) fighting game themes?  <br>Veebu's the greatest Love Live fan artist ever. Go look for her on twitter and tumblr.</br>  <br>Would be quite strange to see Nico next to Im@s girls.</br>  <br>There's a few images that exist.</br>  <br>Yeah, but what I meant is her standing next to Yayoi/Iori/Hibiki. Would be pretty funny seeing Nico as by far the tallest girl of a group.</br>  <br>The best I could find. Though I only looked on danbooru. Oh well.</br>  <br><br>Why not both?</br></br>  <br>But lolis don't have thin waists and breeding hips.<br/></br>  <br>Nopan?</br>  <br> Rinfags <br> Nya </br></br>  <br>Hopefully.</br>   You will never become romantically involved with Nico and perform sexual acts in public with the knowledge that if you were found out her idol career would be over forever <br>Why even live?</br>  <br>But Nico would never do that.

Umi is always shown hanging around Eli instead of Nozomi and Nico has this sort of derpy look to her instead of the whole jealous troll thing going on. Nozomi just seems like this clumsy oaf rather than spiritual leader of the group. In any case if I had to pick a voice that just does not seem to match a character most it would be hers. Too high pitched somehow. Some people also insist that they changed up how Hanayo was supposed to sound at some point but can't confirm that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>People need to stand up to Umi's tyranny more. I'm sure if they all banded together they could maybe overcome her....maybe. I mean none of the others are exercise freaks with martial arts training capable of throwing pillows at supersonic speed is the problem.</br></br>  <br>good taste</br>  Honk  Does anyone still have the link to that googledocs dump or whatever it was with all of the school idol diary translations and what not? The one that had the Maki and Umi ones translated I mean  <br>When I decided to play SIF I immediately noticed the artstyle difference on the album covers for the first songs. Seeing it in video really shows how derpy they all looked though, especially Nico, Hanayo and Rin. And yes, Nozomi seems like she was planned to be the goofy airhead of the group.<br> I still think Nozomi sounds fine in SIF though, I don't have her as main because some of her lines sound like she's high but overall she's okay. .</br></br>  <br>Hey look it's the  slut <br><br><br>This one?<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1ZsOTX29rG7uQShRh4ConecpxZAftbc2YXL<wbr>DAxwN-r1Y/edit</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> https://docs.google.com/document/d<wbr>/1ZsOTX29rG7uQShRh4ConecpxZAftbc2YX<wbr>LDAxwN-r1Y/edit</wbr></wbr> <br><br>Thanks going to bookmark it this time</br></br></br>  <br>They're too afraid to try</br>  <br>You never know.

But overall they are all cute.</br>  Honk  <br>It's technically correct.</br>  <br>Эри</br>  <br>Nope, it's correct just for FFFs who don't even know how to info.</br>  <br>It's not wrong, but it's not right.</br>  <br>shut up shirou</br>  <br>It's Eli on SIF cards, it's Eli when it comes to School idol diary (which has been provided in this thread), it's Eli in the lives presentation, it's Eli even on the gadgets.</br>  <br>And the same goes for people who write Niko instead of Nico.</br>  <br> Nope <br><br>There is no nope. Eri is not wrong since it's the correct romanization for 里. It's retarded to throw shit around, neither of them are wrong since Eli makes more sense for "our" language.<br><br>Also, technically there is no romanized li so this is just an idiotic conversation. Japan doesn't have to worry about this either way so it makes no sense to get upset just because someone is using Eri.</br></br></br></br></br>  Honk...Eli<br>Eli honking Honk<br>HonoEli</br></br>  <br>When the creators have romanized it as li, then it's li. This shouldn't require any further discussion.</br>  <br>No you're right, the romanized version is li because it makes more sense for our language. There still isn't anything wrong with saying Eri though. I use Eli as well but I don't get upset when people use Eri.</br>  <br> technically there is no romanized li <br>Waterfall (Takano Saku) is japanese and writes "Eli" on doujin covers.<br>Then, since it's no problem, ルイズ・フランソワーズ・ル・ブラン・ド・ラ・ヴァリエール is Ruizu furansowasu ru buran do ra vaieru is the correct name because it's the "correct romanization"?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, and since we have to follows kanji this much, I guess you could even call her Esato. And Honoka could be Hoosamuhate with no problems.</br>  <br>The kanji can be read like that yes. But we all know that is not the correct way to read their names.</br>  <br><br><br>You're right, it would be stupid to go with that but this is different since we're talking about a name. One that has the special l/r relation for romaji. Again, there is nothing wrong with saying Eri. You should be going with Eli since it's obviously the one that makes sense and like<br>said the one that the creator wants. There is still nothing wrong with Eri though.<br><br>And the Kanji example is retarded since the reading for her name is always the same. It's supposed to be a romanized ri. What you said is simply not the correct way of reading the Kanji.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I get that there's nothing wrong with Eri, but some people don't even know that the creator wants it to be Eli.</br>  <br>Well those people are idiotic and shouldn't be talked to either way. All I'm saying is that there is no reason to be upset if someone uses Eri. It's kind of hipster considering the god damn system of the language that we use but whatever.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really care when people say Eri, it's just kind of obnoxious when people (like MAL) commit to it and say it's right over anything else.<br>Then again it's fucking MAL and this argument has gone on 15 posts longer than it should have.</br></br>  <br>m8 it's pretty deep if you can't see the nigger's body in the water.</br>  All that matters is  the "Singer" really voiced by Minami Takayama?   <br>No.</br>  <br>Is this a joke or did you actually spot a different name in the credits?</br>  <br>Who is this singer you speak of?</br>  <br> Now now, that'd be telling you a crucial part of the movie. Do you dare? </br>  <br>Why do you speak of the movie when most of us haven't seen it yet?</br>  <br>I haven't seen it either. The two months are killing me too.</br>  <br>It's future Honker</br>  How the fuck is this thread still up  Niko  <br>Because it doesn't want that shitty fan-made tombstone for it.</br>  <br>Ni</br>  honk  Episode 1 in 11 hours. What is the outlook for the anime adaptation? Any hope?  Well the art won't be as good but that's a given, this style is extremely hard to animate.  <br>I expect nothing and am prepared to be disappointed</br>  <br>I don't know anything about the manga, I don't really read manga. I'll be watching it because of the director.</br>  <br>I'm on the same page. I feel the anime will be a let down for how good the manga is</br>  <br>I'm expecting Action Anime</br>  <br>I love the art. Don't think it will be captured</br>  <br>When I saw that thumbnail, I though about that ninja from OPM who broke out of prison to fight Saitama.</br>  <br>Speed of sound Sonic?</br>  <br><br>Is this being streamed? Because I'll stay up and watch the first one, even if it is likely to screen at 3AM local time.</br></br>  Us manga readers will hate on it but still watch it just to see things get animated.  <br><br>Exactly. I love the manga and know the Anime's going to be shit by comparison (We're never going to see the fucking nipple) but I'll watch it anyway.</br></br>  <br>Cause animated hana pee is worth watching</br>  Let's bet on how much Funimation is going to butcher this.  I could never get very far in the manga. Hoping the anime will suit me better  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Everything Hana is worth watching.</br>  <br>Do the colors look particularly bright in the PVs?<br>It doesn't seem like there's really anything to censor judging from the first few chapters. Not to mention it doesn't get REALLY lewd until after they break out, and i'm certain the anime won't reach that point.</br></br>  Hana being voiced by HanaKana won't be appropriate.  As long as there's nudity, which there likely will not be.  <br> Speed of sound Sonic <br> www </br></br>  <br>What style of censorship do you think they will use?<br><br>Steam? Smoke? Bright lines? A world without nipples? erase the "bit"? black boxes? censor tiles? drawing a funny clown or a cute animal over the piece?</br></br></br>  <br>I think they couldve animated the style, as long as they utilized the budget and maybe made it an OVA. But quantity over quality right anon?</br>  <br><br>If the right guy was directing this, Meiko would be having nipslips every second.</br></br>  Have you noticed it yet? Hana is really great.  Ready for the tears.<br><br> I'm probably gonna enjoy watching the anime </br></br>  <br><br>That Mari is best girl.</br></br>  Will Korean chapter 183 come out today?<br><br>Vice Prez is back, can't wait to see how she's going to rek Risa by taking Andre away from her.</br></br>  <br>yes, usually around 9-11am EST</br>  <br>Vice prez is back<br>Fuck, I knew it was unavoidable but it's going to hurt seeing Risa heart broken. The only thing she has is Andres and now he is going to be taken away from him.<br>It'd be awesome if he remained loyal to Risa, but I highly doubt it.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course not.<br><br>Andrenomics will finally pay off after a long crisis.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is that Wall Street?</br></br>  <br>HanaKana "stained" by voicing a pissant.<br>I for one look forward to it.</br></br>  <br>That animation looks really bad to be honest.</br>  Spoilers out:<br><br>・グラントリノ事務所――職場体験3日目 PM5:00。 <br><br>・ボロボロでひっくり返っているイズク

Now I barely have anything to look forward to, beside stuff like Horimiya which is starting to stagnate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome. Thanks. Definitely going to check it out.</br>    <br>Then pick up some new manga? It's not exactly rocket science.</br>    <br>Sorry I just felt like ranting. <br><br>I have picked up a lot of new manga. I suppose I have an itch for shit like pic in previous post or this pic. <br><br>Either way, sorry just me bitching.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not like mangaka just release one series and then disappear off the face of the planet, Inio is doing Dead Dead Demon's Dededededestruction now and it's a better manga than Punpun was.</br>  <br>It's alive? You shitting me, FOR REAL? HOLY SHIT!!! Nah but seriously how, when, by whom, MU doesn't list any new chapters out.</br>    <br>It's the mood of the manga. Both Punpun and IB has the same kind of depressing mood and they pull it off well albeit in different ways.<br><br>Thanks though. I admit to not having read the rest of Inio's work, which is weird now that I think about it. I really loved punpun.</br></br></br>  What's that manga about a girl that's trapped in a dream? And she walks through doors I think, and gets to different places but can't seem to get out?<br>I remember seeing it in one of these threads.</br>  <br>Don't worry he lived.</br>  <br>Agreed, I'm tired of people who complain that it's not just Punpun 2</br>  <br>Just play the game.</br>  <br>it's on batoto by the same crazy delinquents and shit scans or whatever the old group was.</br>    <br>Wasn't that a videogame?</br>  <br><br>I'm not sure? I remember it was a manga.</br></br>  <br>Oh wow. Thanks.<br>Is the game better?</br></br>  <br>Awesome, hope they keep at it for at least 100 more chapters. RokuBlues might not be the best delinquent manga but shit its still really good.</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>    <br><br><br><br>Just read it and fuck its painful how quick that chapter was and I had forgotten it was so good, even if the scan quality is meh. Also, shit son whoever that Onizuka guy is I know he's pretty important just because he's in a bunch of colored promotional art work, can't fucking wait now, This made my day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The scanlator says he likes the arc so hopefully we'll at least get this 1 arcs worth of chapters<br><br><br>Thank you, this is some good shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, you'd think it's a popular enough series to find plenty of results in google, but there's none. <br><br>It's Yozakura Quartet.<br><br>Also I'm still upset they didn't bother animating this flashback.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try Mahou Tsukai no Yome, or Magi no Okurimono (same author as CF).<br><br>Or try Kanojo wa Rokurubi.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks based anon. I'll give all of them a look.</br>    <br>21 volumes? Long?<br><br>Where do you think you are?</br></br></br>  <br>oh god</br>  New scans   never ever        <br>I am a patient boy. I wait, I wait, I wait  ;_; </br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Nvm, its Instant Bullet right?</br>  <br>We must be strong, anon.</br>  <br>It's by the artist of Alien 9. I heard it didn't do the game justice.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>      <br><br>21 volumes is way more than I'd be willing to read for something I didn't like.</br></br>  <br>Why would you be reading it at all if you don't like it?</br>  <br>If I'd gotten into it and then gotten tired of it before it ended.</br>  <br> Okitenemuru <br><br>Oh I remember when that came out</br></br></br>  <br>I've run into this issue. I really liked Punpun and mostly enjoyed all chapters about him. But a good half of the manga wasn't about punpun and was instead about other characters I didn't care for.<br><br>I only cared about Punpun, yet I had to trudge through all these boring side characters.<br><br>Manga with a large volume count usually are subject to this kind of treatment, so they are undesirable or not worth it to read when all you want is to focus on the main characters. Its either that or just shitty fillers that mean nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>    I tried on panda thread, but no luck.<br>Can anyone tell me the name of this manga.<br><br>It's not really a hentai. It's about a high school girl in a post-war setting. She then met 2 guys who let her stayed in their place.<br>One of the guys make a living by using his saliva to make sake and he often eat pickled rock or something.<br>Oh, and the girl fucked those guy sometimes.</br></br></br></br></br>        <br>Anjuu no Chi?</br>  <br>It comes out too slowly</br>    I'm halfway through Kokou no Hito.

I remembered threads for the chapter where he makes his sister wet herself and it dropped off the face of /a/ for well over a year</br>         bunch of shotas sucking each other's dicks <br>Its called Boku no Pico.</br>  <br>The Wheel of time. The One power and shit would look great animated + awesome sword fights, harem, and giant battles.</br>    Different studio for each tale  <br>I was watching the live-action adaptation and it was so terrible that I couldn't make it past the first ten or so minutes.</br>  <br><br>I think you've been reading too many trap doujins if that is what you interpreted from Ender's Game <br><br><br>oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be terrible. Incestfags would scream there's not enough Ender x Valentine content.<br>All the political net writing would be full of emoji. Yaoi fags would not even pick it up until shower scene. And you can bet your ass some retard would cram in 'floating with toast in the mouth in zero G' scene.</br></br>  <br> oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato <br><br>They should do End of Hyperion, I think a diffferent studio for each tale would highlight the differences between storytellers<br><br>It would also not spoil a twist</br></br></br></br></br>  Farseer trilogy  <br>Movie wasn't THAT bad if you read the book before.<br>Shit went sanic fast though and they went full retard with the Formic fleet.</br></br>  <br>Branden Sanderson's Stormlight series would be neato.</br>    <br> Branden  <br><br> wtf. <br><br>Stormlight would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD. I read those when i was in like 5th grade yo. That takes me fucking back. I still have the little shitty amulet you get with the box set.</br>  This would make one epic space opera.    Just make the martians look more like dark elves and you have an awesome sci-fi series.  Just read this series, Time slowing, western style gunslingers in a fantasy setting would be pretty fucking cool. Plus weird giant metal abominations that widows with swords have to kill.   All of these scifi genreplebs <br>disgusting<br><br>I cast my vote for a series of collected short stories by Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Concur on this.

One fucking painting or drawing. Not that hard, you incompetent shitheels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>Books 2, 3, and 4 should each get a 2 cour adaptation.<br>Then, after, they can make the first book into 2 or 3 prequel movies.</br></br></br>  The Witcher series seems tailor-made to be an anime.  I actually am surprised Ender's Game never got animooted in the 80s or whenever the nips were nutty for western SF.    <br>Right? When the stuff that's inside them is so great, the cover really just makes you wonder, what in the fuck?</br>  <br><br>next book when<br/></br></br>  <br> scifi genreplebs <br> Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe </br></br>  I just want my 2D Luna Lovegood  <br>Dont judge a book by its cover<br>˙͜&gt;˙</br></br>  <br>Exactly, thank you. I've never been able to understand this shit.<br><br>It seems that every publisher under the sun took that saying as a license to churn out shitty covers.</br></br></br>  <br>Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>I laughed harder than I should have at this</br>  Pic related would be amazing, but I don't think enough nips read Narnia as kids to get hooked in.  <br>No they should do 1 and 2 side by side jumping back and forth between Ender and Bean..</br>  <br>That's why when i Said Wheel of Time i didn't post a cover. They are the furthest from what the book is actually like that you could possibly get.</br>  <br>Are you too stupid to process Conrad's style?</br>    <br>In a series full of absolutely shit characters, Luna stands out as a bastion of purity and moe.</br>  <br>Don't ever push Brandon Sanderson. That fuck writes like a god damned machine.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Here, have some Perrin Fan art.</br>  Anyone read this shit as a kid? Literally perfect for an anime adaption.  <br>Jesus Christ Superstar: The Anime</br>      <br>If he takes long enough, he can let some up-and-comer turn stormlight book 10 into 3 more novels!<br><br> He actually has a progress bar on his website. 8% through the first draft ;_; </br></br></br>  This would be perfect as an anime.  <br/>  Last to First Men and Starmaker.  I would love to see a proper adaption of Moby-Dick, but it honestly wouldn't translate well. Moby-Dick uses the written medium to its fullest potential. <br><br>Anything by Nathaniel Hawthorne or Mark Twain would be cool too. A lot of Le Guin's novels might work well as anime: The Lathe of Heaven, The Left Hand of Darkness, etc. <br><br>Also, Little, Big.<br><br><br>I read that book about a month ago and it was fucking terrible. I literally could not get myself to finish reading the last 40 or so pages, so I ended up dropping it, which is something I never do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you imagine the huge uproar this would cause if this show was aired in the United States?<br><br>I know this is completely unrelated to the thread, but man, fuck the west.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind the other stuff he's writing too, I mean. He's already got an extensive universe going on with Mistborn and Elantris, AND warbreaker.</br>  <br>Why do people think Ender's Shadow is the second book?<br>It's the fifth.<br>All the shadow books (anything that's not the first 4) can be ignored.<br>The first book can be ignored too actually - It's really just an extraneous backstory.<br> mfw most people didn't even read the best part of the series </br></br></br></br></br>  I'd like to see an old-school sword and sorcery series get an anime, maybe Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.  Anything that's not the traumatizing English animation.  <br><br> Read series back in late-elementary/early-middle school <br> Even made an entire board-game about it as a school project <br> Found out there was an anime a couple years ago. <br> mfw <br>Now I really want to see the sequel series adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This book is garbage.</br>  <br>Wait. <br><br> anime <br><br>IT HAS AN ANIME?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> delicious brown elf version of Dark They Were and Golden Eyed </br>  <br>stop demeaning people's religious texts, anon</br>  <br>No, it's literal garbage. It has no idea what it wants to be.<br><br>Fuck, the Shaver Mysteries are better than Battlefield Earth. And least that sticks with a tone.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if they looked like this</br>  I'm surprised no one has suggested this yet.  <br>it was a (admittedly bad) Scientology joke, calm down</br>  Or a series set in the Sprawl. Molly Millions would be my waifu.  Shitty Cover Incoming. <br><br>Rangers apprentice would make a great coming of age/adventure story.</br></br>  <br>Defending bad science fiction is never acceptable.<br><br>Pic related needs a good adaptation. Fuck Will Smith.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that stopped being funny in 2007.</br>  Donkey Hoetay  This would be amazing too, though the scope might be too much for a single series.  <br>Can't say Asimov without throwing Foundation in that too.

Book? idk, but the MC got hooked on a drug. When i was younger i was like, Oh... Shit.... Because ive seen people get hooked on Real life stuff and it hit home. Made me sad yo. <br><br>But the Author being able to actually talk about Archery and the way Knights fought and stuff was cool.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I assume the books are much, much better than the existing screen adaptation?</br></br>  <br>Thats generally how it goes for everything.</br>  <br>The damn documental hyped me so fucking hard, too bad the OST wouldn't be by Pink Floyd</br>  <br>Oi fag, you picking a fight</br>  Anyone?  <br>So it's serious now?</br>  I would murder for this and the single player campaign up to broodwar  <br>Nah Man. Those, Especially the Icewind Dale would make fucking great shows.</br>  Episodic Witcher anime<br><br>PLS<br><br>Geralt is already anime as fuck</br></br></br></br>  I used to love these books.  Lol, The Xanth series would be pretty great. <br><br>It would do SO well in an anime, Right amounts of Comedy, Action, and fanservice. I mean, a good bit of it is semi erotic in a way.</br></br>    <br>2001: A Space Odyssey would be a great series</br>  <br>A-as long as there a tsundere character for Ce'Nedra.</br>  <br>It was okay, but in retrospect so was the original source material.

Would be great for an anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The MC would be good for an Anime style show too. <br>If I remember correctly, the MC even grows his hair out in one of the books to make himself look more edgy, and then one of the other characters tells him to cut it because it makes him look retarded.<br><br>Would watch/10</br></br></br></br>  <br> Anything that's not the traumatizing English animation. <br>I sat down to watch this at the age of about 11, thinking it would be a cute cartoon about rabbits. It was not.</br></br>  <br>You mean re-adapt The Sentinel?</br>  I dont' know if you've read these stories but they're awesome and some of the best sci-fi ever made and apparently pretty popular in Japan, they're not even that hard to adapt except maybe the second and final novels, but I think they could work fi they made a 26 episode series focusing only some episodes on each, that or four ovas.  <br>Yeah, He makes sure his cloak is flowing in the wind behind him because his ego is huge.</br>  War and peace<br>Master and Margarita<br>Hero of our time<br><br>would make good anime</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wordsworth Classics cover <br>Go to bed, /lit/.</br></br>  The entire Warhammer 40k series   cute girl MC <br> talking cat thing <br> magical adventures <br>it's practically anime already.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING THIS</br>  <br>Wait, even the book is adapted from something else?</br>   ctrl + f Banks <br> 0 results <br>The shitfest after the end of Use of Weapons would be monumental</br></br>  <br>But Hyperion already has an anime adaptation.</br>  <br>FUCKING THIS</br>  <br><br>Make all the rabbits anthropomorphic and you got yourself a deal!<br>Fiver would look like this, but with more buckles and chains.</br></br></br>  <br>Was gonna post this if I didn't see it elswhere in this thread.</br>   Story about a magical shota in medieval Europe <br>It would make millions.</br>  <br>It started as a short story titled The Sentinel, both the book and movie 2001 were worked on at the same time. That's the reason for some of the differences between the book and the movie, Kubrick made some changes that didn't go back the other way.</br>  <br>Isn't the story still pretty "respecful" regarding them used figures ? If anything something that is into religions should like it more than others with all the references.</br>  <br>2001 had 2 sequential books, which also could be adapted, though. It never hurts to re-adapt a series that has aged and is less popular.</br>  <br> gothbunnyboy.jpg <br> buckles and chains <br><br>/lgbt/ and /y/ and /cm/ are calling you. Go back to middle school.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a damn tiny castle.</br>  <br>They did an adaptation of 2010, but it was nowhere near as Kubrick-y as 2001.</br>  <br>2010 got a movie, I don't think 3001 has yet.<br>If we're adapting classic sci-fi, why not Rendezvous with Rama? Get the people responsible for Planetes involved and you're golden.</br></br>  <br> If we're adapting classic sci-fi, why not Rendezvous with Rama? Get the people responsible for Planetes involved and you're golden. <br>This! Although, even though I would love to see this happen, I don't know if it would sell very well as an anime adaptation. It might be a bit too slow-paced for most modern audiences.</br></br>  Third book would probably work the best as an anime.  I can't be the only one who would want to see an Anime version of the Smurfs. Lots of volumes have great stories like the black smurfs and the smurf king.  <br>Also, Smurfette.</br>  <br>Hester and Grike's back story episodes<br><br>The amount of shit that would be lost when grike doesn't die from being run over by a town.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Proper sci-fi will never sell in Japan unless you add mechas or some rpg elements. Just look at the amount of fantasy anime we have this season, it's heartbreaking.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I want shaft animating. I imagine the flash backs to Ptolemy done in shadow puppet style and the demons being more trippy and Inu curryesqe the more powerful they are.</br>  <br>Would you be fine with it if they transformed every races into cute girls ?</br>  <br> War and Peace <br>This is so easy to imagine in anime form while actually reading it. The characters just fit so snugly into the style given how they are described and react to things.</br></br>    i'd like to see japan make these into a series, and i hope they wouldnt localize it too much, since japanese horror sucks   infinite jest   <br>+<br><br><br>Slight time travel codex error detected, reformatting underway.</br></br></br></br>  Its not the best fantasy. But Japan would have a field day with the antimagic poop knights, divine loli school, marketable fire dog.<br><br>At least it's better than sword of truth tho</br></br>  <br>I've already given up about Japan (properly) adapting good horror/scary stories into Anime.</br>  So for those don't know the shahnameh is the ancient Persian book of kings. <br><br>Shahnameh stories concerning Rostam the greatest Persoan hero done in hour long episodes maybe once a month with an art style similar to mononoke but with a pre Islam Persian flair would be a delicious feast for eyes and action.</br></br>  This would actually work pretty well, I think.  <br>BATTLE NUNS NEEDS TO BE A SHOW. <br><br>Fucking Sisters of battle would make one hell of an anime.</br></br></br>   :^)     <br>No it wouldn't</br>  <br>I think /a/ did pretty well not throwing this out sooner. Good job.</br>  <br>This actually sold alright.</br>  <br>I was forced to watch the second or third movie. It really was as bad as they say.</br>  I don't read but I'd like to see an adaption of a Lovecraft book.  <br>watch out for the crawling chaos</br>  I just want some stuff about Rome and Gates of Rome feels pretty anime some times. It reminds me of Hunter x Hunter sometimes except it stars Caesar and Brutus as kids.<br>I, Claudius would be nice too, but I don't think that would work well as an anime.</br>   Replace the apes with lolis.    yuri <br> romance <br> friends become lovers </br></br>  <br><br>Nice blog man haha!</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/7r76H62tzrg  [ ]  <br>Can I subscribe to your tumblr, /u/-san?</br>  FUNI a shit<br><br>Continued from </br></br>  <br><br>Oh alright, thanks niggas, if it means we're getting a better quality release, I can wait 2 days.</br></br>  <br>I honestly was hoping for some more monstergirls.

I hope you don't mind it.</br>  <br>When I read the parts with him all I could imagine was the liches from HoMM3.<br><br>Those undead armies were OP as fuck.</br></br></br>  A question for anyone who has reads the LNs of other anime series they've watched. What is the pacing like in other series. Example, the first episode of the Overlord seems to over the first two chapters of the LN. Is two chapters per episode a normal pacing?  <br>the ride never ends the anime</br>  <br>Vampire loli of the year.</br>  <br>No it's decidedly slow pacing, but I feel the first ep set us up well, things will likely pick up from here on.</br>  <br>More or less, the pacing is "well done" when you get at least 3 eps per volume. If it's 1-2, you know they had to either cut out huge amounts of filler or actual good content.<br><br>1st ep of Overlord took it slow and kept it faithful, the only thing amiss was the dorky heroes intro (might have spent that time to the Aura &amp; Shalltear moaning) and that they cut out Ainz's paranoia of his safety and his tests of low tier spells prior to Arena the Solomon's Gate and the Lemegeton's Demon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I ask because given that each volme is 4-5 chapters long, even at 2 chapter per episode it seems like they'll end somewhere between the fifth and sixth volumes in just a single 13 episode season.</br></br>  <br>and his tests of low tier spells prior to Primal Fire Elemental and before the Arena, his tests in the Solomon's Gate.<br><br>Depending on 2nd episode, we can either judge if they're aiming at 4+4+4+1 for 3 volumes or 3+3+3+3+1 for 4 volumes.<br><br>If I'd go with 444 they'd probably end the next eps at start of Carne onslaught, end with Portal. Next one ending with Gazef's arrival and 4th on the epilogue/throne room.<br><br>3333 would have to condense the shit between carne start and nigan quite a bit to fit in there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rororo ;__;  <br>The first volume will most likely get 4 episodes, and the rest too if the pace stays the same.</br>  <br>I'd roll with 4441 just because the ending and epilogue of 3rd volume is so much better ending point for a single season than the quite sore thumb 4th volume's end that doesn't rrreally bridge into the "Grand Plan Nazarick" nor future events.</br>  I want off of Papa Bones' Wild Ride!  Suggestions on whether I should trim the beginning or end?  <br>I want on Papa Bones' Wild Ride!</br>  <br>Trim both for a single animated loop.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks for answering, this is the first series I've read the LN for, so I didn't know much about how the pacing was going to work.</br></br></br>  <br>Same way it's easier for me to do bdrips in the long run if the someone gives in effort to the original tv work to be better than cr/funi/hadena tier shit. Hopefully the bdmv's get uploaded that is.</br>  <br>Expired goods shouldn't be looking down on anyone, don't you have a dakimakura you should be molesting Albedo?</br>  I don't like any of these characters except for Ainz. Albedo is only good when she's in Deredere mode, otherwise she's an insufferable cunt who interrupts with 'muh respekt' whenever she likes. Shalltear is shalltear, about the only character I like is sebas and that blonde slime cutie. Nerbler is just albedo without the dere.  <br>The undead are even more broken in 6.<br>They're racial ability is that they can revive the dead, so you can go into battle against huge numbers of opponents and come out of the battle without losing a single unit.</br></br>  <br>Too bad for you. I like them all for their + and - because they were created like that, even more so after Ainz confirmed they can change.</br>  <br>Testing this again.</br>  <br>Huh. I was wrong. Maybe a few fractions of a second at the end so you can look at her tits more before it goes back to her face?</br>  Has anyone else started working on converting OL into a ttrpg  <br>How about now?</br>  <br>Oh crap, now its too long. The hell happened there.</br>  <br>No, but it sounds like fun.<br> But I have nobody with which to play it, anyway. ;_; </br></br>  <br>That's what I was thinking, but just a bit shorter, yeah.</br>  <br>ts going to take me a while to create a mapped replica, because I'm relying on images from the anime and manga, as well as the written descriptions from the LN. So I'll need to wait a few more episode before I can work on the maps for any thing aside from floor ten. Tonight I'll probably start kick around ideas on how I should stat Nazarick crew.</br>  Fingers crossed.  <br>How would the setting work? Would players start as a minion in Nazerick, or a lizardman subject, or invaders of the tomb or something along those lines?</br>  <br>Looking good.</br>  Props to the anime for having OP lyrics that matches the content of the show and not some vague bullshit like it always does.  Am I the only one shocked by the mostly positive reception of this? I thought for sure most people would write it off as another SAO clone without even watching.  <br>Because most people read its LN.</br>  <br>Skeletor is the goddmned MC, of course people are gonna give it a watch.</br>  <br>I thought it would be some generic shit too but I'm glad I watched the first episode. Now after I consumed to much I have to wait for the rest of the volumes to be released.</br>  <br>I'd classify it as "under-the-radar" good. I don't think many people are watching it, but those that are like it.</br>  <br>The MC is skeletor and everyone is clichee evil characters. Way harder to make SAO comparisons.<br><br>also the premise is more interesting than SAO´s.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the blatant animeonlyfags who say they liked the first episode and are interested in finding out where the series goes.</br>  Best girl.  <br>When you have a spooky skeleton as an MC its way easier to retain an audience.</br>  So Pandora's Actor was shown in the OP.<br><br>He's hidden behind the credits at the very end.</br></br>  <br>Good find.</br>  <br>Is the LN that good? I haven't bothered to read it (busy working on Qualidea at the moment), but I figured it'd be another half-decent SAO clone</br>  So funi is the only shit we are going by? Nothing else?  <br>Pity he won't show up in the show itself.</br>  <br>I'd say it's better than your average shit LN.</br>  <br> SAO clone <br>It's pretty pathetic that everything is being compared to SAO, like it's some industry standard or something.</br></br>  <br>It's not a masterpiece but it's well written for a LN (even if the translation isn't really the best thing since sliced bread). The characters are interesting, the story is entertaining and there's enough mystery about what the hell is going to happen next in Papa Bone's story for you want to read more.</br>  <br>It is written like an actual novel, instead of that one-to-two-sentences-per-paragraph you tend to see in most LNs. The author takes effort to actually describe things and builds suspense quite well. He foreshadows well, too.</br>  <br>They could probably fit him in as an extra non-canon scene. Something like Ainz going around and inspecting every room just to check how things are and running into PA, shenanigans ensue.</br>  <br>I just started piecing together ideas a few hours ago, so much of this is rough notes. I'm looking at starting the setting shortly before Nazarick suddenly pops up in the new world. So initially Nazarick doesn't exist. When Nazarik does pop into existence, the players may start as explorers discovering a new location. Then I'm hoping to transition them to a more diplomatic role, however given the fickleness of some players it may turn out differently.</br>  <br>Wait, why? Pandora's Actor has a major scene in Volume 3.</br>  <br>Then he should have been featured more prominently in the OP or ending. It'll probably be a pretty short scene. It's just talking after all.</br>  <br>I was thinking that the reason he wasn't featured is because he is a mysterious character up until he gets revealed in the third volume.</br>  Pic related show "種族：異系種" translatable by something like "Race: Exogamous/Outbreeder" but later on Ainz says that only heteromorphic people (異形種) can join his guild.<br>How should I translate it? Does the show goofed up?</br>  <br>I'm so sleepy that I forgot to put the picture.</br>  <br>leaving it at heteromorphic should be fine</br>   The Supreme Overlord of Nazarick Ainz Ooal Gown will never use you as a chair <br>Why even live? ;_;</br>  <br><br> SAO clone <br>Every threads. i wonder if it will be the same if Overlord came out before SAO</br></br></br>  <br>Many people haven't watched it because its not on CR<br> lel </br></br>  Could Shiroe beat the Great Tomb of Nazarick if he had the entire town of Akibahara at his disposal?  <br>I doubt it.<br>Also, SAO is the Nurutu of the LN, that's why people like to compare shows.</br></br>  <br> Considering every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian, yes.<br> What I would like to know if who would win if Ainz and Shiroe clashed. Each one can bring 3 people with them.</br></br>  Why Albedo is such a slut  <br> succubus <br>Damn, why can't I figure this out?</br></br>  <br>Without some type of resurrection magic most people couldn't hope to compete against Ainz.</br>  <br>Yes, SAO would of been popular either way, and i heard people calling Hack a SAO clone.</br>  <br> Each one can bring 3 people with them. <br>That puts it in Ainz-favor. In a party v party, I think Shiroe would have the advantage.</br></br>  <br> every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian <br><br>lol</br></br></br>  <br> Considering every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian, yes. <br>The hell? Where did you get that from?</br></br>  <br>What if they equip null death?</br>  <br> and i heard people calling Hack a SAO clone. <br>How is even possible?</br></br>  <br>Well Ainz most powerful skill bypasses immunities and resistances and kills even invalid targets such as air. But I suppose all you really need to do I know before hand what it does and teleport the hell away.</br>  <br> Considering every Adventurer is possibly as strong or stronger than a floor guardian, yes. <br><br>That's not true. They go over the exact numbers in the LN..there are about 120 Platinum heroes in the entire empire, and they aren't even on the level of the maids, or barely can match them. The only humans who could probably win in a straight fight would be a yggdrasil player or someone like gaelz with a shit ton of legendary equips</br></br></br>  <br>Shiroe and Akibahara adventurers can revive their fallen, Ainz needs to use the guild hall to revive his fallen.<br><br><br>Money's on Shiroe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, the guardians have zero experience in group fights, Ainz group can easily DTS'd Shiroe group and Ainz group has better equipment but their coordination is another matter</br>  <br><br> A high level adventurer can spells and skills that would be pretty OP for Overlord's standards. Not to mention that they can easily come back to life and there are niggers with that Overskill thing.<br><br><br> I am talking about Log Horizon's Adventurers, the players, not Overlord's shitty adventurers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How is even possible? <br>Oh anon, your heart is too pure, never meet other people.</br></br>  I'm pretty sure your standard max level Log Horizon player is heavily outclassed by a high level Nazarick NPC.  <br> Albedo uses her World Class item to raze the Cathedral to the ground. <br><br>Yeah, okay.</br></br></br>  <br>lol, there's no instant-death resist in Log Horizon so Ainz can just Wail of the Banshee or instant death aura and kill all the adventurers. <br>failing that he can rip reality or drop a blackhole on the adventurers.</br></br>  Is the skull guy voiced by shiro from log horizon?<br><br>Are they serious?</br></br>  <br>They are, but only by floor guardians, since their strength is equal to about a raid boss in strength. However, some LH players have retarded Overskills that break conventional game logic like World-Class items. Again, it depends on the size of each members party, with the more players Shiroe has, the better their chance at winning.<br><br><br>They have revival spells anon. Not to mention that Ainz overkill spell also allows them 12 second to self-rez themselves. Adventurers also have access to items and inventory as opposed to the NPC guardians who only have whatever items they're equipped with.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Albedo uses her World Class item to raze the Cathedral to the ground <br> mfw <br><br>Shame we won't get to see it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Ainz can cast Time Stop, use the death skill, then cast wail of the banshee. Now that's a cheesy way to win that's kinda hard to bypass.</br>  <br>No, the voice actor of Ains is the same as Isaac from Log Horizon.</br>  <br>The guardians have an inventory as well, otherwise Shalltear would have never been able to equip her armor and spear after being mind controlled.</br>  Fuck, now I want a crossover of Log Horizon and Overlord, the way their groups operate is so different that would create an interesting dynamic.  <br>As in dot hack?</br>  <br>Considering Nazarick's general stance of all humans are worthless and deserve to die, I'm not sure they'd get along all that well. Maybe Ainz, Sebas, Cocytus, and Hamsuke would be fine though.</br>  Would the people of Log Horizon care if Demiurge took all of the low-levels hostage using Domination Mantra?  <br>Ok lets put this more into logical assumption:<br><br> Every Akibahara players have the equal/similar in term of power and abilities to every players(human/humanoid races) in YGGDRASIL <br> Players(human) in YGGDRASIL can be revive with the same system as LH  <br> It takes a raid of hundred players to raid Nazarick <br> Each floor guardians are consider as floor bosses <br> It was consider hard but players manager to defeated most of the guardians  <br> In the end, nobody pass floor 8 with Victim as boss because of the OP debuff <br> So if Shiroe, along with his raid team, can find a way to pass floor 8 then you can talk about beating Nazarick </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shizu and Yuri Alpha should be included on that list, along with Pandora's Actor</br>  <br>Obviously. <br><br>The episodes covering the exploitation of low-levels for those potions and their rescue shows this. <br><br>Plus the whole be nice vibe that LH has.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> NPC guardians who only have whatever items they're equipped with <br>Ah, no. Ainz can gives items to NPC as well as the world class items. Pretty clear example that Ainz gave Mare the Rings of Nazarick</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>If we're talking about battle strength, there is no reason to assume that the two would be equal. Considering that there are no real serious feats of destruction in LH worth mentioning, I doubt they can stand up to level 100s in overlord.</br>  <br>Then do they have anything to counter Demiurge's skill? Otherwise, they can't really make a move, right?<br><br>Moreover, does LH have anything to handle the passive auras that Ainz and the guardians emit?</br></br></br>  <br>Also Ainz can autoforce Shiroe and friends back to the church with his instakill spell because they don't have any quick revival items in LH. Essentially, they would have to raid twice within 100 hours - and succeed - to even have a chance.</br>   arguing about cross-universe powerlevels <br>Jesus fucking Christ.</br>  <br>Go ahead and assume Shirou will pull something out of his ass with his devil intellect.</br>  <br>Demiurge's skill only works on people under level 60 or something along those lines. Shiroe and co. may not be ranked by that scale, but I doubt they don't quality as powerful enough.<br><br>Passive auras aren't really a quantifiable thing, so there is no need to discuss them honestly. Unless you mean Cocytus' ice, which would matter in a fight</br></br></br>  <br> they don't have any quick revival items in LH <br> What about that portable cathedral thing that the Odissey faggots had with them?</br></br>  I hope more players show up, this will get boring quickly with just NPCs, and I enjoy mmo anime.  "I have no friends or family so I guess I should just stay here"<br>GEE, HOW FUCKING CONVENIENT</br>  <br> nofunallowed.jpg </br>  <br>Well you're right. I should fix that most majority of players in LH that max level with best equipment and best skills(teaching) can be consider in similar power level with lvl 100 in Overlord. But that is a vast amount of players in LH can get into that high standard, probably around 8-10% of the population in Akibahara. So conquer Nazarick might be harder than it should be.</br>  <br>He's your typical lonely Japanese office worker.</br>  <br> mmo anime <br>it's not</br></br>  <br>With how the players and their entire guilds just randomly teleport in at various time periods there could literally be a guild that just pops up over night, so you might get your wish.</br>  <br>Even 100+ years into the future of Japan, they manage to survive the geriatric armaggedon of 2050 and they still manage to live bleak and depressing salaryman lives.</br>  <br>What is it then? No other players? A RPG anime?</br>  <br>She would be a great buff and summon support mage if Ainz trained her up along with her husband to protect her on the battlefield.</br>  <br>No, not really. Ainz froze a lake over completely with just one of his spells and it was implied that her froze even more than just the lake. Cocytus, who is weaker than Shalltear, Sebas or Rubedo, is implied to be able to kill Zy'tl Q'ae in one hit with one of his attacks (Zy'tl Q'ae being 100 meters in height with 300 meter tentacles).</br>  <br>It's a dead mmo anime. First of it's kind.</br>  <br>Fantasy world anime from the viewpoint of the antagonist.</br>  <br>Waste of time. Look at her stats its not even close to Iguvua. Thats why Ainz wanted to kill them and have some experiments with them to quickly raise their stats like he did with Iguvua</br>  <br>I fail to see how Hack can be a SAO clone, when the Hack existed ten years before SAO. What does SAO so how defy the laws of time?</br>  <br>DnD fantasy, including the character sheets</br>  <br>waifu harem</br>  <br>First volume of SAO came out in 2001, a year before .hack//sign. I still doubt its a clone though.</br>   tfw Papa Bones doesn't want to sit on your skeleton throne.   <br>Anon its never a waste of time to raise a good support mage. Her stats are also pretty damn good for her level. At a high level she would be comparable to mare.</br>  <br>I dunno man. Demiurge seemed pretty amused by the alternative.</br>  <br><br>Speaking oh Maou MCs.<br>Is Maou no Hajimekata's LN going to get picked up again?<br>Also if in the interim anyone can recommend some really good undead/maou LNs I'd be grateful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering she is a vampire loli, that picture is more like<br> tfw when your lord stops using you as a chair </br></br>  <br>I would, but all of the ones I know are just revenge/slow power buildup/cheap harem ones.</br>  <br>Would you mind giving me the names of the revenge ones?</br>  <br>You''re right I didn't check for a date on the WN.</br>  <br> Is that a woman or a dude with boobs in his armor?</br>  <br> Finally caught up to V4 <br>   Hot and steamy lizard sex <br>   Lizardwoman giving her body so easily <br>   That absolute loyalty from the Lizardmen <br>   Cocytus being a bro and recognizing warrior spirit <br><br>Good volume, too bad we won't see it in the anime. V5 when?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A woman.</br>  <br>Sutarareta Yuusha<br>Arifureta<br>Shinka no mi<br>Master of Monster (sort of)<br><br>I got those from a list I found, along with another one called Sendai Yuusha wa Inkyou Shitai. That one was way more bearable than the four revenge ones I just listed, but I still got bored with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what's Ainz end plan? Does he want to murder everyone or just enslave them?  <br> He wants Ainz Oaal Gown (the group, not himself) to raise to the level of legends and become like that hottest shit ever.<br> Of course, his servants think he is talking about world domination so he might just go with the flow and do that.</br></br>  <br>Tomorrow</br>  <br>His end goal is  to not die </br>  <br>Tomorrow</br>  <br>*the hottest shit ever</br>  who else watched it with closed eyes?  <br><br>There's a time when FUNi wasn't shit, but they licensed and pre-dubbed an animu that featured a shounen lead who's 50% pussy-ass and oh yeah "FUCK AMERICA."<br><br>So yeah. FUNi's now shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks man</br>  <br>He also wants to spread the name of his guild in the hopes of finding some of his old guildmates.</br>  <br>All that sameskull.</br>  <br>We're going to get the 4th volume though. The OP has Cocytus fighting the lizardmen. If it's in the OP, SHITS HAPPENING.<br><br><br>The MMO world is real, there is no escape. Its just about a skeleton conquering the world.<br><br><br>Ainz has an army of monsters and the LH characters aren't even all 100. Not to mention, they clearly lack the sheer power Ainz seems to have including his game breaking items.<br><br><br>I hope you're not kidding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sebas and Demiurge in the kingdom also show up in the OP, but it's impossible for them to animate 6 fucking volumes in just 13 episodes.</br>  <br>Unless you expect the anime to be worse than the manga, we can only animate 3 volumes.</br>  <br> That's actually a horrible soulsucking monster. </br>  <br>Not really, I just didn't know who the pacing worked in terms of Anime episodes to LN volumes. That's why I had asked earlier.</br>  <br>Stunlocking is the clear solution.</br>   all that display of power when Ainz shows up in front of the lizardmen <br> I laughed. Niggah is chunni as fuck.</br>   You are the only man who I like <br> My life and destiny are yours <br> Don't you give me your love and passion? <br> I don't know how I should let go <br><br>Why is Albedo such a great waifu?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well know when E-Rantel starts if we get 3 or more volumes.</br>  <br>You have to show proper status and not hide your cards for shit like that. If you want to make an impression that is.</br>  <br>The songs picked for the show are surprisingly fitting.<br><br>Full lyrics when?</br></br></br>  <br> chunni <br>I don't think you know what that mean</br></br>  <br> The weird thing is that his concept of "rule trough loyalty, not fear" is "summon an army of skeletons with high-tier magic equipment, summon a golem and make him throw a boulder so these skeletons can act as stairs only for you to kill them all afterwards with a single clap. Oh, and don't forget to summon TWENTY high-level monsters to act as messengers."</br>  <br>Why bother with subtlety when you can indulge in glorious, tasteless excess?</br>  <br>They clearly ran out of ideas for the OP on what to show. All that wrong gear for the post 2nd volume sneakpeeks. <br><br>13 Heroes that are never shown too are there. Climb is not and he is alternating pov with Sebas for 5-6. Yet Sebas is shown with scene that would also warrant Climb. <br><br>Demiurge is missing his minion army and so on. Cocytus and Papa Bones are shown with wrong gear completely for their 3/4 volume scenes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not fit to be an overlord if you don't understand the difference between conquer and govern</br>  <br><br> My point is that that whole display of power wouldn't help his "obtain warriors who acr based on loyalty, no fear" goal, since nigger got them scared as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Haha please, what he summoned was 20 low-tier Wraiths and that'a enough for humans and lizards to wet themselves.<br><br>His daily limits for mid-tier and high-tier are 12 and 4 respectively.</br></br></br>  <br>That's was only a rule applied to Cocytus, Papa Bones don't give a fuck.</br>  <br><br><br>This, he meant that Cocytus is forbidden to rule them through fear. Which just meant "don't go into the village and slaughter everyone until they pledge loyalty"</br></br></br>  <br>You realize you somehow managed to completely misinterpret that right?<br><br>Before worrying about how to rule a group, first you have to conquer them, and conquer them with enough force that it's obvious to them that they CAN'T win even if they tried to rebel afterwards. What Ainz means after that is once rule has been established, actually try to earn their loyalty.</br></br></br>  <br>First you need to make them submit, then rule them with fair and prosperous governance.<br><br>Submit through superior strength and dominance instead of sweet words and gifts. That might have succeeded if the lizardbros hadn't won the first engagement so "easily".<br><br>Before Papa Bones showed them the "full" might like that, they still had the mindset of being able to win or gain favorable position for future.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is it that even though Cocytus is so damedame, he still remains so based?  <br>He's such a shitty dad. His kid spends hard work and effort masterfully crafting this throne for him, all out of joint work, and he doesn't even bother sitting.</br>  <br>Is that genderbent, loli Jack of Blades?</br>  <br>Why would a skeleton sit on fellow skeleton?</br>  <br>Why wouldn't he? They could join forces.</br>  <br> Ainz starts moving around on a mobile skeleton throne. <br>I want to see this now.</br></br>  <br> This.<br> I don't give a fuck about the torture and mass murder, but not apreciating Demiurge's effort was a shit thing to do.</br></br>  <br>Little tyke was so fucking proud of himself too.</br>  <br> praising the shit out of Aura's mud hut <br> can't bother sitting in a pimped out skeleton throne <br><br>Papa Bones a shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not  now : http://pastebin.com/maxBUHPZ<br> This is the result of me raping my ears for literally 2 hours. </br></br>  <br>And when was the last time Ainz notices sebas, huh? Dudes out there building an intelligence network which is the most important thing Ainz needs right now.</br>  <br>Maybe he noticed it's not comfortable enough compared to the lean back of Shalltear.<br><br>Next time he'll improve the throne to have proper cushion and tanned leather, maybe with two-legged sheep as ingredient.</br></br></br>  <br>I-I'm not sure what to say. The autotune must have been quite something after the first hour.<br><br>Your efforts are greatly appreciated from me.</br></br></br>  <br>Second vampire loli.<br>Anyway, is someone subbing this? I want to kill FUNi asap.</br></br>  Ainz pretending he actually knows what the fuck the guardians are talking about is hilarious.  <br>Whoever thought using that kind of autotune for the ED must have been deaf.</br>  I'm going into hibernation until Tuesday comes around.  Does anyone still have a link to the sub rip?  <br> no waiting until next Thursday for objectively better subs <br><br>You're weak.</br></br></br>  <br>Never mind, I Found it.<br><br>http://pastebin.com/8ieq4QdX</br></br></br>   [Underwater] Gangsta - 02 (720p) [BDBE7152].mkv   <br>Any proof of this?

Will he stay relevant?  Why is this reminding me of Guns Dogs Carnage so much?   In which episode will Delico first appear?  <br>Nina is so damn cute.</br>  So why did everyone drop it?

I just finished re-watching this anime, and it could've been one of my favorite, if only they ended it the way the author wanted it to end. <br><br>Fuck it, I'm so pissed</br></br>  <br>True but she definitely develops towards being more dere and confident. Maybe you could see these comics as the end of that process. I just really enjoy them even if they're exaggerating her dere side, we did not get enough of that in the LNs.</br>  <br> Oreimo <br> not just fapping to Takuji and Hyocoroad works <br>Your loss.</br></br></br>  <br> we did not get enough of that in the LNs <br>And the occasional dere moments that were in the LN were mostly omitted from the anime. <br>Fucking nekofag scum. I'm still bitter that we'll never get a decent adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>A shame the manga is shit too. At least the 2 special episodes made it a little bit better.</br>  Is the ending any good in the visual novel (with Kirino)  Thoughts on Dandelion so far? It has fairly unique concept but its execution is absurd as fuck. The characters are pretty decent and cute especially Kanade and Hikari. Above average show.  <br>At first I wasn't particularly interested in the plot but she sold the show by herself. AND she's the main character. You'd be mad not to like her.</br>  My dick is not prepared for this  <br>It's one episode in, if you hate it already, you are just the typical HURR DURR MOESHIT shitposter who was never going to like it in the first place because of your autism. <br><br>The show could still be complete shit, but there is no real way to know 1 episode deep. I didn't even declare DanMachi shit until 3 episodes in, and that was the most generic trash created in recent memory, you need to settle down.</br></br></br>  Satou a shit.<br><br>Kanade should just materialize a concrete above her head.</br></br>  <br>But Onii-sama would rescue her and score more points</br></blockquote>]
