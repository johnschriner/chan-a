I'd rather study him as a medical oddity. Guy's a fucking miracle of nature.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't you read? He's not going to answer your question.<br><br>He ignored you.</br></br></br>  Anybody know if the new demo for eyes of heaven is up  <br>up tomorrow i think</br>  <br>Between 10 &amp; 12 JST. So maybe in about an hour. PSN updates usually take 2 hours with content gradually going up</br>  <br>It's not even a sexual thing, I'm just imagining the gap being JUST big enough for the fry to slide gently inside and for some reason, this is really satisfying.</br>  <br>ah thanks was wondering since its 10am here and about 8am there and its still not up</br>   seriously considering a Joestar birthmark tattoo like this <br>How much of a faggot does this make me?</br>  <br>considering it's just a star, it's not that bad. nothing compared to getting a tattoo of your waifu or some shit.<br><br>it's fine.</br></br></br>  <br>only works if you're buff.</br>  <br>It's just a star in a not-so-visible spot. Perfectly fine. Nobody's gonna pick you out as a weeb for that.<br><br> The best part is if for some reason you stop liking JoJo, out of sight, out of mind. </br></br></br>  <br>its pretty Power Level if you think about it<br>however anyone who doesnt get that is from JoJo would think youre someone who gets a star tattoo for no fucking reason</br></br>  <br>I've never ever considered a tattoo in my entire life but I totally want one.<br><br>Would never ACTUALLY get one, but it's the only one I've ever actually wanted.</br></br></br>  DID HE DELIVER?  <br><br>A friend of mine from high school has a tattoo of the Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts. A star tattoo would be fine in a relative sense.</br></br>  <br>youd look like a fucken douche</br>  <br>yeah <br>all in all<br>its just a star</br></br></br>  <br> A friend of mine from high school has a tattoo of the Keyblade from Kingdom Hearts. <br>Wow.<br>That's terrible.<br>KH is my guilty pleasure but that sounds so fucking bad.</br></br></br></br>  You now remember Avdol.  <br>I tried to but instead I remembered your mom's hot wet pussy.<br><br>Mmmmmh...</br></br></br>  <br>gross</br>  You now remember Kekyoin.  What do you think Polnareff think about JoJo?    http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/fea<wbr>ture/2015-07-16/interview-jojo-biza<wbr>rre-adventure-director-naokatsu-tsu<wbr>da/.90413<br><br> But the JoJo's graphic novels, over the years, have become something of an internet meme, or at least they are the source of a lot of internet memes. One thing we can do today that wouldn't have been possible 20 years ago is pick up on already established memes and see how we can pull those into the anime. <br><br>DP confirms JoJo is a meme.</br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>Gay Priest when?</br>  <br>Love playing as Fugo, but I can't activate Purple Haze Feedback for the life of me. I always perform the command right when I'm in despair mode or whatever that's called and it doesn't active? Can anyone help?</br>  <br>Meme manga for meme spouters</br>  <br>Gyro hearts<br>Gyro steel ball<br>Johnny fingers <br>Gyro bear dots<br>Johnny horse in his hat<br>Johnny Scar<br>I could never find the other</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tattoos <br> being a degenerate <br>Pick two</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have 2 meters by the time you try it?</br>  <br>DP sure have their priorities straight. Also, I'm kind of curious to see what songs were on that list for the EDs.</br>  <br>Oh fuck. That makes sense too since Buccellati's revival move needs a meter. Thanks anon.</br>  I'm evil?  Could Homura realistically defeat DIO?  <br> Vampires <br> Drinking...wine <br><br>Dio, you is a shit Dracula fo' sho'</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just remember, all GHAs need 2 meters. A more powerful super requires you spend more. You get what you pay for in fitegaymes</br>  <br>CONFIRMED HE LIED</br>  <br>Yeah I'm retarded. For some reason I thought of PHF as a free ticket to turn the match around at the last bit of health, but of course it's an actual move that uses up the HH gauge.</br>  <br><br>Bigger version for all your wallpapery needs</br></br>  <br><br>Shit, wrong one. My bad</br></br>  <br> What was the process for choosing the ending theme songs like "Roundabout" and "Walk Like an Egyptian?" Is this a tradition that you want to continue in future parts? <br><br> Well, those came from the author of the original graphic novel, Hirohiko Araki. They're all songs that he was listening to back when he was drawing the individual parts. Mr. Araki only listens to Western music because he doesn't understand English, so none of the lyrics come across to him as language, but as pure sound. So we got a list of these songs that he was listening to back when he was writing each part, and we chose songs for the closing animation based on which ones Warner was able to secure the rights for. It was up to Warner to actually do the negotiating. So if there is an anime production of the next part, we'll probably go by the same process. <br><br>SONGS MUST BE OWNED BY WARNER CONFIRMED<br><br>EAT SHIT QUEEN FAGS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering I already have a tattoo of Gatt's brand, it's too late for me.<br> A star at the nape of my neck would've been pretty offputting anyway, regardless of the fact I'm in really good shape. Taking off your shirt would just become really embarrassing and make me feel like a flaming fuccboi. </br></br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br><br>Haha yes. Do you have a pick for an ED DiU? (Pick one owned by WB)</br></br></br></br>      <br>when people see your star tattoo they will   get a feeling so complicated  </br>  <br>Pet Shop Boys - West End Girls<br><br>You?</br></br></br>  I want to hold hands with DIO.  <br>Warner doesn't own Yes, dumbass.<br>He's just saying that they're the ones who take care of negotiating the rights for shit they don't own.</br></br>  <br>Don't we all, anon.</br>  Why is ASB so great and EoH looks like shit?  <br>Because you have shit taste in video games</br>  <br>I honestly can't think of any because I haven't listened to much music. I'll listen to your recommendation though<br><br><br>I didn't know Barbie had a vampire edition</br></br></br></br>  <br>Queen would still cost them a fortune and they're more likely to license Warner property.</br>  <br>The characters have really weird filters in EoH.</br>  <br>I know, but it's not restricted to Warner-only songs.<br><br>Just sayin'.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to be his wife.</br>  <br>I wan't to play a fighting game with my JoJos, I don't want to run around opening chests and throwing garbage cans.</br>  <br>He wasn't a vampire at that point</br>  Would DIO have been pissed if someone hurt Pucci?  <br>Play the Capcum game</br>  Is part 4 announced yet?  <br> I know. <br><br><br> Not wanting to look like a sexy slutty fuccboi <br><br>You're not deserving of the Joestar birthmark anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is only one true ED for DiU.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=L_j<wbr>WHffIx5E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Must feel weird to be asked by Warner on the behalf of a Japanese animation studio if they can use one of your songs in their Japanese cartoons.</br>  <br>The director and staff are already acting like it is. There was also an animation guy who tweeted out (and later deleted) something like "buy the BDs if you want part 5" which inadvertently confirmed part 4, unless they really are planning on skipping to part 5.</br>  <br> Not wanting to look like a sexy slutty fuccboi <br>I know, I'm a terrible JoJo fan.  At the very least i'm full on bisexual for Dio. </br></br>  <br> skipping one of the best parts for one of the worst </br>  <br>Don't do this anon. <br><br>I'm a part 5 fag and I could start a flamewar but I don't want to ruin this thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Giorno's trash, get over it already.</br>  <br>Really? I haven't been reading about it, do you have a link or something?</br>  <br> I'm a part 5 fag </br>  <br>d</br>  <br>Did you read the English versions or one of a different kind?</br>  <br>Shit, I'm warning you!!</br>  Why can't Tusk move in stopped time in ASB?  <br><br>Ladies, stop it, you're BOTH  overrated as shit. </br></br>  part 6 fag here <br>are parts 7&amp;8 translated?</br>  <br>Damn I don't remember this, are these the new translations?</br>  <br>Because DIO's time stops are strong and girthy. Big boy time stops. Diego's are bitchmade, lacking in protein and testosterone.</br>  Isn't generals agains the rules?  <br>Probably, Pucci was the only member of his book club.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4ui<wbr>tWji0j9E</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_tv<wbr>NN1km3Eg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VRU<wbr>njCzgr9U</wbr>  [ ]<br>mixtape so hot it BURNS</br></br></br>  <br>English, but I understand Giorno's real personality even with the shitty translation. He's basically Jonathan but much classier and with a smoother vocabulary.<br><br><br>It's chapter 2 so it's probably the new translation.</br></br></br></br>  <br>moots gone.</br>  <br> Never shows any emotion other than concern for his allies and fear of enemy stands <br> gets killed off <br> gets revived <br> shows more personality than any other crusader by a landslide for one fight <br> back to boring right after <br>What was the fucking point?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes everything is on batoto mein freund</br>  This, Eckhardt, is my Stand.  <br>That's Japan for you. They didn't even like Part 6.</br>  <br>because everyone realized thet didn't like avdol so he stopped being "important"</br>  <br>Isn't Batoto some chapters behind on part 8?</br>  <br>YES, I AM!!<br><br>Also this which gets more amusing each time I watch it because I SWEAR the manga version wasn't this dripping in innuendo:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J_-<wbr>iyhQLiKM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>   EoH demo in literally minutes <br> New chapter on Monday <br>This is the final time of the year /jojo/ will be this active again.

Regardless, Batoto is the way to go, unless you want colored Jojo.</br>  <br>it's all caught up<br>you're good</br></br>  7&gt;5&gt;4&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1&gt;6  <br>What time is it coming????

I just had to screencap it when I saw it, it was too funny<br><br><br> implying jonathan wouldn't visit Dio in hell from time to time if possible <br><br><br>you don't 『stand』a chance against me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop.</br>  <br><br>Clearly he would have the World do it for him.</br></br>  <br> Implying people in Hell get conjugal visits <br><br>I don't know what weird-ass religion you follow bruh but I've never heard that</br></br></br>  You guys wanna flockmod again?  <br>hilarious that this shit video is in 60fps</br>  <br>it's called Arakism, you can change the rules whenever you feel like it.</br>  <br>o i am laffin</br>  <br>we need a gif of Dio lips</br>  <br>that's not uncle Sam language</br>  <br>I want colored, currently in the middle of SBR<br>Where do I go? Colored Adventure just has first few and last few of each part + full 6</br></br>  I want to get the EoH demo but the only even close to fitan game i play is  melee  and i can't speak moon<br>Is it even worth downloading at that point?</br>  <br>I honestly don't know other than Colored Adventure, check the pastebin</br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>The demo's free, you can't really go wrong with free.</br>  <br>I made one of the kiss.</br>  <br>Yeah but I meant asking if it was worth getting as in would I be able to figure anything out from context clues and how to play</br>  <br>There isnt one. Araki is a jerk. Like "he later died of a cold"<br><br>Or like how there is no requiem stand at the black sabbath fight.<br><br>Or purposely on jojonium corner it shows the ear with 3 moles, but the dio drawing has no moles... The manga does the same. Show dio's past and his 3 moles, next panel no moles...<br><br>I feel it's on purpose. He remembered danny saving johnathan's life, and made johnny save danny's life in sbr.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really like the way the Joestar Estate was modeled, you can actually spot the specific areas where some of the scene took place. Here's where Jonathan confronted Dio about Dario's letter.<br><br>Sorry for the ant-size and fire. The mansion suddenly started burning.</br></br>  <br>Really needs to be faster.<br>Try 0.5 milliseconds</br></br>  <br>Top of the stairs where George and his attendants walked in on the young JoJo and Dio fight.</br>  <br> "he later died of a cold" <br><br>THERE WERE VERY FEW THINGS IN JOJO THAT HONESTLY PISSED ME OFF BUT THIS, THIS WAS ONE.<br><br>WHY ARAKI. WHY.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>how are you uploading pics so quickly?</br></br>  I played Kars in the demo he's pretty cool, you can hold L1 and press circle to use the mask and fly <br><br>I still don't know the buttons someone pls help</br></br>  <br><br>Gyro's lips</br></br>    <br>Mother fucker</br>  Is Jojolion the most Alpha Jojo so far? Because I think he is.<br><br>Josph is a close second.</br></br>  <br>i love you Doc, I should look up how to make gifs so i don't have to be a bitch and ask</br>  <br>yeah same here how the fuck do u dodge now</br>  <br>The Creative Director said in a recent interview that the songs they pick for the OP and ED are based off a list of the music Araki was listening to when he originally drew the part and then they see if Warner can get the rights.</br>  <br>On how to make it from scratch? That I can't teach, but if you want to make quick gifs from youtube videos, you can use instagiffer.</br>  Timestop is possible in the demo. I'll tell you guys if it's the same effect as the anime.<br><br>Hell I'll just upload it on YouTube.</br></br>  <br>DS4 share button</br>  <br>i assume to make it from scratch you download the source video and use photoshop or after effects or some program but i don;t have experience doing that, only way to do it is to do it</br>  <br>If you stand still and press circle you dodge, idk man it's confusing as fuck</br>  <br>Stream it.</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>my new favorite toy, I'll put him right next to kekyoin<br><br><br>watch out</br></br></br></br>  <br>do they automatically go to a cloud or something?</br>  Anyone who can speak moon know what Jotaro is saying about Jonathan here?<br><br>Okay, I'll try.<br><br>Nah, I'm uploading them on Twitter and posting them here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you can barely do anything while time is stopped u get like 2 secs<br><br>ah thanks man was wonderin shit that takes a lot of stamina</br></br></br>  <br>So these...are combos....woah...</br>  <br>Good. The threads are absolute cancer right now and could really use a break.</br>  if ya beat kakyoin by beating him into the water drum it shows a quick image of it manga form  <br> twitter <br>ok thanks man</br></br>  <br>link to your twitter?</br>  I still don't get Josuke's powers<br><br>Can he freeze people to death by taking away all heat from the air?</br></br>  <br>technically he can but we don't know the extent of his powers, the amount he takes away could only be as big as the bubble probably.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/AnddoTX<br><br>Timestop video: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vqR<wbr>RJrazaq0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Twitch stream: twitch&gt;dot&lt;tv/serviceghost<br><br>I'll start playing at 3 viewers!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Meppz are you here?  <br>He could probably freeze them to death by taking away heat from THEM. <br><br>I think the bubbles take a property away from something, and then bestow that property on the next thing they touch (generally "popping" the bubble as it were).</br></br></br>  <br>Meppz is dead</br>  <br> Anime timestop  <br>It's shit</br></br>  <br>Can you stop it for any longer?<br>I want to see it in it's full duration. I'm glad they kept the effect.</br></br>  <br> ????? ???????? <br>??? ????</br></br>  <br>Doc you do know how to contact Meppz?</br>  <br> PM him on reddit but he might take a while to get to it. Note, he's a mod for /r/stardust </br>  <br>Call him Gappy it's less confusing that way, and we don't know the extent of his powers so far the most wtf thing we've seen him do is taking friction away but I doubt he's going to get any instant kill capabilities.</br>  <br>People tend to forget that the arrow needs to actually choose you to get a requiem, like how do you get a stand</br>  <br>the kekyion didn't make a shit on my computer but that spoiler shit yes, but I am actually not mad<br>still fuck you you dirty son of a whore</br></br>  <br>Is he the one that's going to stream the HftF tourney? I should probably start practicing for that.</br>  <br>Fucking this.<br>What went so wrong?</br></br>  <br>i thought it was the other night?<br>shit when is it?</br></br>  <br>Technically he could but there are much more effective ways he could kill if he ever wanted to.

You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br></br>  <br><br>How do you go from a sentence full of words you don't know to understanding most of the words without flashcards?</br></br>  zoi  Am I losing anything by not having sentence audio on my cards? I have point audio, but sentence audio feels like it takes too long.  <br>I took the sentence audio out. It's distracting and I almost never listen to it anyways.</br>  <br>I just do? I think maybe you underestimate the power of your own memory. Anki is hardly required to learn. That said I rarely run into a sentence with more than 2 words I don't know. For example, if I read a chapter of manga, it's not uncommon that I don't even have to look a word at all in that chapter. Keep in mind, I dropped anki after knowing around 4000 words. I don't know if it would be really hard to do it without anki from the get go.</br>  <br>Not needed, sentence isn't needed either. The sentences are shit anyway.</br>   set reviews to 9999 <br> have 700 to do </br>  <br>By reading more. Getting from knowing 15% of words to 90% of words is the easiest part to do without flashcards. It's the range from 90-99 or so that's really hard without flashcards.</br>  so in the last thread i asked for advice some guy apparently gave bad advice so whats a good place to start at? currently im listening to japanesepod101 anyone use it before or comment on if its a good way to learn?  <br>Japanesepod is great. You might also be interested in rosetta stone and pimsleur</br>    <br>Yep. Hardest part is the shit that is just really uncommon that I don't see again for like 6 months or more. But, I'm happy if I can at least recognize that I had seen it before.</br>  <br>ねええぞいちゃん<br>俺のちん◯を触ってくれｗ(*´∀｀*)</br></br>  <br>Shitposting is shitposting even if it's in Japanese, go back to /b/</br>  <br>エッチ！</br>  <br>無礼</br>  <br>i dont know if youre serious i heard rosetta stone was terrible</br>  Hey guys i read the guide and i think i'm doing pretty good. Today I learned Hiragana, Katakana, and about 20 kanjis. I think i have a pretty good start. What do you recommend I do tommorow?   learn hangul <br> learn the word for Korea in Korean <br> literally hangook <br> gook <br><br>Now I see.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recommend you read the guide again.</br>  <br>Totally serious, rosetta stone is legit, people shitting on it are baiting, and the guide was written to intimidate new people to keep the thread as a secrit club.</br>  I've been reading about tulpas again and they amaze me. I haven't heard about them in years but you can control your brain to do anything. They cuck themselves into schizophrenia but Iam only going to be happy and positive.<br><br>It so beautiful that one day I will know Japanese. Something that I never thought could be possible is going to happen one day :)</br></br>  For those you who want to have kids will you encourage them to learn other languages? I wish my parents did. They knew how much I was obsessed with anime from a young age and yet they did nothing. If I ever have kids I'll support their interest and direct them the right way.  <br><br><br><br>See <br><br>You literally just learn the kana and then do a vocab deck in Anki (the one in the Anki startup bin is recommended for starters) while you go through one of those grammar guides (and RTK if you want) and then read. If you still have an issue with grammar after that, there's other resources like the DoJG (and the deck) and other grammar textbooks.<br><br>The guide is just really fucking bloated for something aimed towards beginners. Should be trimmed down a bunch to make it less wordy, and split the resources/FAQ into their own docs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>makes sense considering a lot of these threads seems like a giant circlejerk</br>  <br>;)<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qmn<wbr>lSDk7KzY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Where can I subscribe?</br>  <br>ok cool thanks man ill definitely check that out</br>  <br><br><br>I read the guide pretty well Haha. It took me about 2 hours but i finally got both hiragana and katakana. it took 10 minutes for the 20 kanjis to learn. It's easy haha. I'll be done in a few months at this rate :)</br></br></br>  <br>This bitch is so retarded</br>  <br>Haha, maybe you should read it again, haha. Haha, a few months you say? Haha, we'll see about that, haha. :^)</br>  <br>I bet you don't know why Americans started calling them gooks.<br>You uneducated negro.</br></br>  <br>What's this supposed to mean? I only watched 3 mins but I'm just saying if my kid was into Japanese stuff I'd encourage him to learn more about it if they wanted to is all.</br>  <br> The guide is just really fucking bloated for something aimed towards beginners. Should be trimmed down a bunch to make it less wordy, and split the resources/FAQ into their own docs. <br>It's fine, I got started using that guide and it helped me a lot, gives a good overview of all non-retarded options without railroading people into a single method they might not like. <br>I doubt people that don't have attention span enough to read that guide can somehow learn a language, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't like the idea of giving new people options.</br>  <br>I'm never going to watch 11 minutes of that but I assume trying to raise a child with 2 languages could be hard and confusing for him so it's understandable to only start with the language of the country he's going to live in <br>Then when he goes to middle school he could be helped by the native parent at learning English, surely that is what she is going to do</br></br>  <br>Kids absorb languages like fucking sponges. They have absolutely no problem being raised in two languages. That's what makes her opinion so ridiculous. Knowing English in Japan is such a huge advantage that not teaching her kids English just by fucking using the language normally is just plain retarded.</br>  <br><br>Being American, and being around friends who have grown up speaking both English and their native language, I can assure you that it's not only possible to do it but extremely easy. <br><br>My friends speak their native language less fluently than they speak English, despite speaking nothing but their native language at home and on family outings.<br><br><br><br>This.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people raise their kids to be bilingual, it's just going to take a few months longer before they start to talk, starting learning English in school is going to be a lot harder and confusing.</br>  <br>I listened to it.<br>It boils down to.<br><br>I don't want to teach my children English.<br>I have that decision as a mom<br>Respect my decision<br>Don't say mean things about my poor decision in life<br>Saying English is the most useful language is offensive to other language learning<br><br><br>Its a video based on feels and woman liberal logic. I recommend leaving it on to listen once because I couldn't wait that ugly beaver bitch</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At the start he's going to speak a bastard mix of Japanese and English like my grandpa was doing with my native and French after he went to fight for the FFL</br>  <br> trying to raise a child with 2 languages could be hard and confusing for him <br>Not really, I grew up learning 2 languages and it was pretty effortless.</br></br>  <br>People can tell the difference when the people around them aren't saying certain words. We can adapt to nearly any social situation as humans</br>    <br>All babies say stupid shit at the start so it doesn't matter in the slightest.</br>  Is anyone using Memorise? Don't have anki on my phone.  <br>Memorise...</br>  <br><br>But only one of those can be construed as "liberal", and even then you need to use the really stupid American definition for it work?</br></br>  <br>Memorise?</br>  <br><br>*Memrise</br></br>  So should I work on a RTK kanji deck or KD for Kanji? Or both at the same time? is that a good idea anyways?<br><br>What do you guys recommend for starters? Im doing nothing this whole summer so I have fuck loads of time. I have Kana down btw. I plan on working on the 2k/6k core vocab deck and Tae Kim/Genki for grammar.</br></br>  <br> Memerise </br>  <br> Or both at the same time? <br>That's a really bad idea, chose one. Compare the first few cards in a deck and choose the one you like most.</br></br>  <br>Yes and no<br>From personal experience it depends on the kid and both parents. if you teach them language A only but the school teaches them language B then it becomes a problem.</br></br>  <br>I just basterdize the word liberal to mean doing retarded things that should be accepted by others and not vilified.<br><br>Slut <br>Fat acceptance<br>Bug chasing<br>Drug abuse for recreation<br>Not working<br><br>All behavior that should be called out that fits in the left wing liberal garbage mindset.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Drug abuse for recreation <br>I understand everything else, but what's wrong with that?</br></br>  <br>Mods can't read japanese though.</br>  I've been trying to get to the CoR for the past few days but my connection keeps timing out. Is anyone else having this issue or am I just an idiot?   At what level should I open up a manga? <br><br>I'm going to do what most people do and start with Yotsuba.

Somehow if you were working instead, it wouldn't be a problem.

The only thing I learned from genki at the time was basic は usage, all of the vocab came just from watching anime.

Are you under the impression that Genki teaches you 200 unique words by lesson 2?

Let alone the first 2 fucking lessons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm... Well there wasn't a single necko, kawai, or even a des to be seen on that page, so I'm pretty sure that most weeaboo wouldn't even know a single word on that page.</br>  Can I get banned from posting in Japanese on other boards?  <br>You reverse engineer the engine or the file format used to store the script.</br>  <br>If it's offtopic or shitposting, then probably.</br>  <br>japanesepod is really good, though. check out the intermediate/advanced lessons. you can't lump it in with the bullshit.<br><br><br>Listen to the facts and the anecdotes, do your own research, and make your own decisions.

Since I moved to a new house I started getting banned all the time (for 1-3 days). So now I'm very careful. Before I moved, I got banned maybe 3 times since 2006. <br><br>Also, that last 電波教師 episode was pretty funny eh? (Now they can't claim it's not anime related)</br></br></br>  <br>I'm proud of you, anon-kun.</br>  <br><br> i could read it <br> it has furigana <br> good thing I'm so smart <br><br>Good thing grammar is included with that furigana, huh?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that's not racist </br>  <br>It seemed pretty shit when I tried it. It's been 4+ years though, so it very well could have improved.</br>  How do you get over a line of text you don't understand? Some lines i don't get and spend a long time trying to figure out. I know i should just forget about it and move on, but i guess ocd kicks in, and i really want to know what the line means, or what i got wrong, and spend more time then i should trying to understand it  <br>You move to the next line.<br><br>Alternatively, see a doctor</br></br></br>  <br>You have to be retarded to not get what's happening here even without much grammar knowledge.</br>  <br>Doesn't happen very often. It happens so fewly often that, I just ignore it and it usually has no effect on my understanding of anything, because it's usually just a stupid piece of dialogue with no story value at all! Guess what, you'll spend an hour figuring it out, and you'll realize that they were saying "lol fuck you bro" and you'll realize, it doesn't even matter.</br>  <br>my grammar is terrible, so there's a bunch of things i don't understand, and i learn a bunch of new ones every day, but sometimes theres that one thing i can't understand and it drives me crazy</br>  How do I get good at understanding what japanese people are saying? I've been studying for 2 years and can now read easy stuff like Yotsuba and know a lot of vocabulary, but when I listen to videos of japanese people discussing I get lost in the sentences and have trouble understanding what they're saying. I'm going to Japan in a month, how should I practice that?  <br>Read VNs, they have audio, and you can replay it if you don't get it the first time</br>   tfw you've studied for 2 years but you're still not even N3 <br>Is there something wrong with me?</br>  <br>Talk to people, get some friend online from japanguide or some similar site.<br>Most people there are really nice.</br></br>  <br>I usually just skip lines I don't understand. If I think it is important or I see the same words keep coming up, I'll try to figure it out. Google for words or grammar, use Google translate, check DOJG, etc. If none of that works I come to the DJT and they give me an answer within a few minutes. Some people try to shit on DJT and say they have never gotten helped, but that is only because they ask retarded questions. Every question I've asked has gotten answered.</br>  <br>There's at least something wrong with your studying method, reaching N2 in a year should be fully possible. <br>Sounds like you've been "studying" on and off and not really putting a lot of effort in.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean "you". I was N1 in a little over 2 years without being a NEET</br>  <br>Are you serious, or are you just a self-assessed "N1?"<br>Assuming it's the first, what were your study habits?</br></br>  <br> N1 in a little over 2 years without being a NEET <br>Right, prove it.</br></br>   tfw i want to try this "Shadowing" method but i don't have anywhere i can do it where no one will see me   <br>I never took the N1, but I took the JCAT and got placed a 10-20 points below N1 a bit after the 2 year mark. So a little bit of exaggeration but not too much.<br><br> Assuming it's the first, what were your study habits? <br>Eroge everyday. Also I just had school, not a job, which means plenty of free time still.</br></br></br></br>  <br> frogposting <br>Yes, there is something wrong with you. Fucking quit that.</br></br>  <br> inb4 he asks for a notarized timestamped copy of your jcat results <br>this "prove it" thing is the latest shitposting meme.</br></br>  Is there any way of marking new cards in Anki as mastered?  <br><br>http://vocaroo.com/?upload</br></br>  <br>Yeah, just keep getting them easy.</br>  <br>He made a dubious claim, it's only natural to ask for proof since he's gloating about it </br>  <br>he's probably just a false beginner</br>  <br>That sounds like a pain in the ass...<br>I'm doing Kanji Damage, but I already know 4~500 of the first cards, is there really no other way?<br>I guess I could delete or suspend them</br></br></br>  <br>a wut?</br>  <br><br> Is she actually an alien? </br></br>  <br>You seem them 4 days from now, then 8-10 days later and finally they're mature.</br>  <br>someone who already knew much of the material before they "started"</br>  <br>No. She's a squid, she's a kid.</br>  <br>Ah yeah, there are a lot of those. I'd bet my ass the AJATT faggot was one.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks</br>  Man, it would be cool if there was a version of core 6k with all useless normalfag/business words and obvious katakana loanwords replaced with common terms from manga and VN to get people started faster  Hi guys. Question, how would you translate "さっきから寸止めばっかされててもう...もう!!", especially the もう part if nothing else? 寸止め in this case is about reaching an objective. Can give more context if needed  <br>I like katakana loanwords, they're a free easy new word when I get them, and I still learn something because you have to read it once to confirm that the english word can actually be used in a japanese conversation in the same context. But yeah, theres a lot of useless shit like business words that I end up never learning because they're useless and hard</br>  <br>Someone posted a Core 6k spreadsheet that was reordered according to an LN corpus, all the compound words are at the back though.</br>  <br><br>You'll see them. Japanese's got political, business and economic terms way more ingrained in common language than you're giving it credit for.</br></br>  Noone has ever said to themselves when they see an English word "I am never going to use that word therefor I will not even try to learn it"  <br>Yes they have, and yes they do. That's what native speakers do all the time when they come across new words. They judge that if they haven't seen the word in 18+ years, it probably isn't important.<br><br>Of course, this is assuming they aren't trying to learn about some specific subject to which the word is relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>I learned the word "extemporaneous" last week, but I forgot it within a day. It wasn't until it was used two or three more times that I actually managed to retain it.</br>  <br>Natives aren't actively learning vocabulary but you are and will do so for a long while yet. Don't be nitpicky, you're just starting out. You'll see fucking everything in the Core6k, they're all pretty common words in almost all types of text and genres.</br>  <br> extemporaneous <br>That's a much common word in my native language. Funny.</br></br>  <br> Don't be nitpicky, you're just starting out <br>Who do you think you're talking to?<br><br>Anyway I never did Core decks but I do recall people posting some tax related word from it that Ive literally never fucking seen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vocabulary count?</br>  <br>Aulophobia</br>  <br> Vocabulary count? <br>Anyone who can actually answer this must have wasted a pathetic amount of time in anki</br></br>  I checked the guide at the top. <br><br>Will I be missing out on anything important if I learn stroke order and pronunciation from Tae Kim, and then do reps with Realkana to cement it?</br></br>  <br> 400 hours in anki in 2 years <br>I-is that a pathetic amount?</br></br>  <br>I won't expect to see 初詣で in 80% of VNs, but you're right that it wouldn't be weird at all for an author to use it.<br><br>A whole entire 4583 words in core6k are Extremely common in LNs, though. And that's not even counting compound words, only unified morphemes. I cannot find any particularly outstanding words from that 4583.<br><br>No, that's fine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's less than an a hour a day...</br>  <br>On Anki, you retard. And if you aren't using Anki, why are you butting in?</br>  <br>It would be nice if we could find some vocabulary estimator online.</br>  is it possible to analyse hanahira to see the word frequency, etc? How do i do it?  <br>If you read as much as you're supposed to and have good %ages in anki, 30 minutes a day is more than enough Anki. What matters is the number of mature cards you make every week, not how much time you spend.</br>  <br>1) Find a copy of its script<br>2) Make sure the script doesn't have furigana in it, that will make words with furigana show up more<br>3) Put the script as plaintext somewhere on your hard drive and plug it into that japanese text analyzer tool<br>4) Make sure to use the latest version with MeCab selected<br>5) Profit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Otorhinolaryngologist.</br>  <br>I don't know about every week, but I seem to mature about 15-20 cards every day now.</br>  <br>How do i find a copy of the script? I looked on google and can't find anything</br>  <br>The closer you are to having started out, the more reasonable it is to know your word count. If you're still doing 40 minutes a day then it's pretty sad yeah.<br><br><br> On Anki, you retard.  <br>Fuck off, either is fine.<br><br> And if you aren't using Anki, why are you butting in? <br>Where did you get that idea?

Study with anki or just read and remember words as you see them?  <br>Huh?</br>  <br>Read, sing songs and watch anime.</br>  <br>Both. At the same time.</br>  <br>They aren't mutually exclusive.</br>  <br>A mix of both. Get through kanji and common words using anki so you don't have to look shit up constantly, pick up the rest by reading.</br>  <br><br><br>Lets pretend you're not a NEET and/or are not devoted to spending 8+ hours a day on learning moon.<br><br>Which would you prefer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both.</br>  <br>anki while you learn vocab. Then keep doing anki until you can't take it anymore<br>then switch to reading (and still always remember that reading alone isn't enough, your reading needs to be studying.

The Guide is supposed to be a piece of propaganda, essentially. There isn't really anything wrong with trying to talk people into a specific narrow path of progression as a beginner. In fact for beginners I think this is the best thing someone can do for them. They are going to progress with almost anything they do and the real key to going from beginner to intermediate is more about establishing a routine and studying every day with progressive overload. There are dozens of ways this can be done but without a simple <br> do this <br> now do this <br> then do this  <br>Approach, most people would become lost in the stream of information. I've been thinking about it for a little while on and off and I think what would be really useful is if we/someone could come up with a shortlist of different narrow paths aimed at high early progression and routine, for different goals, and have those as options, it would be great. Almost like picking a guide for level progression for a character in an RPG game. Pick something and stick with it and the results will be magnified. <br><br>A highly simplified and stylised example of representing this sort of thing might be like pic related. Kind of like a skill tree.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lets see if i can understand this...<br><br>Literal: I am master japanese<br> <br>Prettied up version: I am a japanese master<br><br> inb4 i fucked up </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw when I read things like this as "このSomethingこそわたくしめのFuckれな人生におけるIsh<wbr>ouldKnowThisのGodDamnItきでございましょう"</wbr> <br><br>I have a long way to go...</br></br></br>  <br>The only focuses should be<br>- Listening<br>- Reading<br>- Studying (e.g. Anki, RTK, etc)<br>Nothing else provides stable, comprehensible input, which is the only way people actually acquire language, and it's the fundamental foundation aroundwhich working language learning methods revolve.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You aren't going to learn writing without specifically trying to and you know it.</br>  <br>Lol, you suck socks.</br>  <br> I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't even 200 unique words in it. <br>From memory there are near a thousand unique words in the first volume.

Some colleges like to round up false beginners to make themselves look better. Sometimes public school districts will mess up and send people from School A, where &lt;subject&gt; was taught, to School B, where &lt;subject&gt; is taught at a later year. This happened where I live for Algebra 1, for example: It was taught both in 8th grade and in 9th grade. There was no way to be a 9th grader in Alg2, and even if there were, they were actually pretty incompetent at organizing this kind of thing and would probably only manage one class of 9th grade Alg2 each year.</br>  <br> Learning methods that do not include or at least minorly focus on comprehensible input are not proved to work for the general people, and in cases that seem to show them working, they are not logically valid <br>1.

That shit is rife in academia: in order to find what someone actually beliefs and their personally held stance you have to find them in an unofficial capacity because their official output is essentially obfuscated by a paper trail of references which could fill a library in and of itself if one were to follow the trail to try and find where these held beliefs seemed to actually stem from. <br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 1.

A friend had told mei should go straight to kanji but that seems a hit sketch. Is it better to just continue doing and then slowly work and integrate kanji into my routine ? last question whats theconsensus in Nama sensei's vids?  <br>Does anyone have that kanji deck with ６０００ odd kanji posted the other day?</br>  <br> Should i jump straight to the Kanji or should i just continue to increase my vocab, listening, and read more?

A lot of the radicals which have been simplified look narrower than the rest and it appears jarring. I understand why they simplified the script but they didn't really have to take it so far. I think the Japanese have it better with their current modern script as a healthy medium between simplified Chinese and the full traditional as taught in Taiwan. <br>讠 and 言<br>见 and 見<br>门 and 門<br>长 and 長<br>页 and 頁<br>龙 and 龍<br>Dont' mind 马 and 馬 so much, but the rest is vomit inducing.

These Western nations are also incredibly familiar with the process of learning other languages, given the range of languages common to the different neighboring kingdoms and Empires at the time. Japan was linguistically isolated aside from early exposure from China. We've all seen how woefully they managed to emulate Chinese sounds with their attempts at 音読み.

From this result, one could tell the effort and seriousness she put into it despite her being bad at cooking. <br><br>Irohabro confirmed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br><br>I don't think it means as much as you think it does. 8man has always admired her beauty which makes sense considering he shares the common opinion that she's the most beautiful girl in the school.<br><br>It wouldn't be accurate description of her unless he wrote sonnets about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cover of the next volume has all the girls surrounding 8man to tease all the ships as well</br>  <br> Sasuga Watari, no winner revealed until the last chapter of the last volume. <br> implying there will be a winner. </br></br>  <br> implying Watari isn't the true winner </br>  <br>Watari did win the 8bowl already, in a way.</br>  <br>I thought Watari was the 8man<br>that's just another 8man, so technically 8man wins himself in the end</br></br>  <br> Not posting best one </br>  <br>Seriously though, what kind of author brags about fucking his lead character's VA on twitter?</br>  <br>The same author that brags about fucking his sly kouhai on twitter.</br>  <br>Why would you not brag about your fuck boy?</br>  I wanna impregnate this fucking whore.  <br>That's a distant third for me, after them cuddling and this one of them playing the pocky game.</br>  <br><br><br> Eyes closed <br>Why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watari is literally 8man, he is with his Totsuka right now.</br>  <br>I've got some bad news for you.</br>  <br> mfw Watar's Kouhai is a boy </br>    <br><br>Iroha's high school rom com is as wrong as expected.</br></br>  <br>For all we know they both have harems and could effectively ntr over a dozen people at once by fucking eachother.</br>   <br> <br><br>Iroha won.</br></br></br>  <br>Shame 4chan is the only place she'll ever taste victory.</br>  <br> Indirect <br> Forced <br> Won </br></br></br>  <br>WITNESS</br>  <br>No need to get butthurt over funposting, you even tried there too.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>But taking jabs at Irohafags is the funnest of funposting because they get triggered so easily.</br>  <br>His mouth is now Iroha's used goods, though.</br>  <br> implying Yui and Yukino didn't baker their episode 1 cookies with their own menstrual blood <br> implying Komachi hasn't been slipping her saliva into 8man's food for years </br></br>  <br> I love Oregairu, 8man is so cool. He's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. 8man is a true hero, who sees through society's lies. I love watching Oregairu because I find 8man relatable. I also hate nice girls, and I hate all these superficial teenagers who surround me. Who /8maninhighschool/ here?</br>  <br> Chrismas caking <br><br>Do not invent verbs.</br></br></br>  <br> [citation needed] <br><br> :^) </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Yukino did that with her cookies from the first episode, she wasn't that into him yet.<br><br>Her paella and the cookies from the start of volume 11 are a different story though.</br></br></br>  Vol 12<br><br> all fix their issues <br> WW introduces cookieman <br> Yui having grown up lives happily ever after with the cookieman <br> Yukino growing a spine goes abroad to further soul search <br> meets Hayama, gets over their past <br> Zaimokuza becomes an editor, Iroha finds genuine in him <br> 8man becomes exactly like sensei, the scene where he says he's gonna be head over heels for her if she were 10 years younger was an implication that they had a lot of things in common <br> 8man sees a girl with rotten eyes and an ice king <br> puts them together under a volunteer club </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8/8 would rage.</br>  Reminder that Yui nor Yukino have done full confession to 8man yet<br><br>Yui's cookies in Vol 11 she kept pressing on as "Thank you" but Hachiman knows better. The actual promise date will be a confession<br><br><br>Yukino has yet to have her turn in the 8bowl</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More<br><br/></br></br>  <br>I love Oregairu, Hayama is a fucking cunt. He's the hero none of us deserve, but the one we need right now. Hayama is a true cunt, who does what is expected of him. I love watching Oregairu because I find Hayama hateable. I also want to kill this fucking cunt, and I hate all these non-genuine teenagers who lie to protect each other's feelings. Who /cuntkillers/ here?</br>  What was 8man's career path again? Sensei mentioned he'd make a good teacher (or counselor) and Haruno mentioned social studies. Judging by his reaction to both suggestions I assume he considered both as a viable option. And judging by his ability alone he's rather good on Japanese, Psychology, and Politics.  <br>He's going to be a house husband, have you even been paying attention at all</br>  <br>No, he'll be a publishing editor.<br><br> Which will just make Iroha more depressed that he rejected her. </br></br></br>  <br> implying she would give up </br>  <br> Implying she wouldn't NTR whoever won the 8bowl </br>  <br>She's smart enough to know when she's been beaten.</br>  <br>Yui is not his type. One "onii-chan~" whisper onto 8man's ears and Iroha wins.</br>  <br><br> The instant I answered, my head was lightly chopped. Hiratsuka-sensei placed her hand on her waist in resignation and gave me a scrutinizing stare. It lacked her usual overbearing attitude, but made her look more like an onee-san, making me feel a little uneasy. Then, she sighed. “Look at reality.” <br> I-It’s not like I’m running away from reality, it’s just that I’m facing my dreams… But saying this would’ve been too much for Hiratsuka-sensei’s earnest gaze. <br> I scratched my cheeks, looked away, and answered, “I still haven’t decided yet. Besides, it’s not like I have a specific career in mind and I don’t really want to take up a research position either, so I believe choosing the liberal arts isn’t a problem.” <br>-<br> “…But wouldn’t it be bad if your first choice was a mistake?” <br> “Indeed. That’s why what teachers can do is increase those options…” said Hiratsuka-sensei. “And also, decrease them.” <br> “Is it really okay for you to decrease them?” I asked. <br> Hiratsuka-sensei made a complicated expression. <br> “Of course, the one making the final call is the student. At best, we can only offer advice. So for the time being… you need to hurry up and give up on your dream of being a full-time house-husband.” <br> Ahh, she just threw that option out the window… My options… <br><br> have you even been paying attention at all <br>Have you?<br>I'm betting on going for sociology and politics and changing his mind to sciences for psychology.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Every time I see this image I picture mindless zombies and skulls with crossbones. Human hearts entangled with barbed wire being pulled any which way. A mental haze so thick that the only feeling left is a sort of overpowering grey-colored comfort leaving no room for any free thoughts or imagination.<br><br>Something about a salaryman coming home from a daily grind to a loving wife is just extremely unsettling.</br></br></br>  <br> 8man asked her on a date with "someday" pretext <br> Yui rejected it by saying it has been paid in full price <br> 8man keep pressing on and Yui keep rejecting it <br> Finally, 8man snapped and having long monologue about he himself is still avoiding the issue and how his act might be wrong. <br> Students gathered around to watch them argue while whispering "that guy is so gross", and "poor that girl has to deal with him". <br> 8man heard those whispers and his past trauma began to surface. Yui became aware of her surrounding and tried to break off. <br> Just when she turned around, 8man with a clear voice and jumbled words, confessed to her and asked her to going out with him. <br> Yui surprised and confused as to how to answer. Then she began yelling, "Hikki, you're seriously gross!" And quickly walked away from there. <br> 8man also walked away from the scene felt dejected while could still hearing cold whispers from the people around. When he was about to broke. <br> He met a brand-new Yukino. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice fanfiction</br>  いろはす～  <br><br>Reminder that 8man was once the glorious DT<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=maa<wbr>CoxS8D28</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>We all do.</br>  <br>If he doesn't love her and she finds that out it would be interesting  and painful  to see this.</br>  <br>8man loves Yui too much to reject her. <br><br>He will have to reject Yukino's feelings as not being genuine largely because her feelings are tied up with her dependency issues</br></br></br>    <br>And what, you're 8man?<br>What a fucking joke</br></br>  <br>All this misuse of genuine is actually starting to trigger me I think.<br><br>Yukino's feelings are just as "genuine" as Yui's, the deciding point is which of the two,  hopefully Yui,  8man himself feels more strongly for</br></br></br>  <br> 8man loves Yui too much to reject her.  <br>Sure thing.<br><br> He will have to reject Yukino's feelings as not being genuine largely because her feelings are tied up with her dependency issues <br>Yukino's issues and romance are two different things.<br>Romance comes secondary to Yukino because it's not part of her problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megurin~!</br>  <br>No. I will remind you.</br>  If 8man didn't want to engage in romance then why did he wreck the girls' panties with genuine twice?   people translating the ending before translating the rest of the rest of the LN <br>Seems legit.</br>  <br>Want a hint anon?<br> Yuifags and Irohafags </br></br>  <br>Reading Yukino's memorandum makes me think that her idea of genuine is what she is dependent on and her boner for 8man is outside of that. <br><br>Unless genuine = romance I think they are two separate things.</br></br></br>  I'm up to v10.

I know that love is not based on merit but If Yukino wins, her win would have been achieved without having moved a finger:<br><br>1) Yui was pretty much sinking her own ship throughout vol. 11 because she didn’t want to be “unfair” to yukino. Furthermore, she was being considerate of Yukino and gave her chances to advance her relationship with 8man but she wasted them because of muh drama. To make matters worse, Yui will most likely get her heart crushed in vol. 12 in order to get 8man to understand that someone as wonderful as Yui can love him.<br><br>2) Iroha is teaching him how to be comfortable around girls and she is also teaching him how to be more open and conscious of a relationship (how 8man discovered that girls are sweet and spicy).<br><br>3) Sensei seems to want 8man to give yukino the genuine. Komachi, the cunt, (and haruno?) also seem to ship them and are actively trying to help them.<br><br>4) Haruno has been doing what she can to help Yukino get over her dependency issues. It is true that she can go about it in a nicer way, but who is to say that she hasn’t done so before and that only led to yukino taking advantage of that kindness and turning it into reliance.<br><br>5) Even though everyone is helping her, either indirectly or directly, she still has the audacity to ask 8man to help her some day.<br><br>6) When someone finally calls her out on her dependency issues, her only reply is:<br><br> Hurrr durrr, you are right, therefore I’m going to depend on you guys and make a request. <br><br>I know that by the end of the series she is going to get some character development which is going to prove that she is not dependent, but if she wins, her victory would have been attained by having everything handed to her. Everyone is doing their best to get Yukino and 8man together or to win the 8bowl for themselves all the while Yukino is too busy counting how many scratches the shoes of the people she talks to have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ebin.</br>  <br>Too bad she's the main girl and is going to win</br>  <br>The sad thing is that all of that is true.</br>  <br>Haruno literally did nothing right.</br>  <br>No I mean the time she said "fuck off" to 8man.</br>  <br>You got the exact line?</br>  <br> I know that by the end of the series she is going to get some character development <br><br>She's going to cut her hair</br></br></br>  <br>Are people this stupid?<br><br>Its obviously time-skip  Iroha's end  at this point.<br><br>8man and YYx2 are too incompatible to have a stable romantic relationship. Being friends is plausible though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>At this part of the story though, he kept telling himself this so that he would avoid getting pissed off at her.</br></br>  <br>that scene when she said "you don't have to go to club anymore".<br><br>Do Yukinofags all have poor memory like you, or because of shipping glasses you just ignore that your girl was acting like a bitch?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh that scene, I was reading 6.5 so I was thinking of something else.<br><br>She was telling him not to show up to the club because she didn't want him to force himself to show up to a place he had no interest in.<br><br>He kept making excuses and leaving early making her think she had no interest, she wasn't doing it to be a bitch to him.<br>She was doing it to basically set him free.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's time to end what was already wrong in the beginning. It should still be possible for us to start over again. If that's the case, perhaps the feelings that were trapped inside, the answers too will change. <br> Supposing. Supposing if. If those feelings became anything special. <br> I averted my eyes from Yuigahama, and my throat let out a strangled voice. "You have already thanked me enough" <br> I did not want to confirm whether it was really just a gift of thanks. Even so, whether it was really just a gift, I can't just accept it without giving it a second thought. <br> However, I was assaulted by a sense of regret the instance I said it. From what I could see, Yuigahama's face looked ready to burst into tears. <br> "Still, it's just a thank you." Yuigahama spoke with a voice that sounded like she was being crushed to death. Her expression was contorted as she bit her lips lightly. To hide the gleam from her eyes, she quickly turned her back to us. <br><br>HURT. ME.

Tirelessly wandering through the internet with no avail.</br>  <br> Supposing. Supposing if. If those feelings became anything special. <br><br>8man only probe on Yui's feeling. And this is not the first time either.<br><br>It's pretty much confirmed that Yui will win the romance subplot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Yui even want him at this point?</br>  <br>Nah Yukino can still win. He is over nice girls for the most part with Yui<br><br>He's open to reciprocating her feelings if Vol 11 is any indicator. But theres still Yukino's turn to make a move if she desires to in Volume 12</br></br></br>  <br>*her being Yui<br><br>Also, if you think Watari is going to make obvious who is going to win in Vol 11 then you're an idiot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She does, but remember the nurse office scene, she probably thinks her chances are nil.<br><br>It's in that mindset where a girl like Yui would just sacrifice her chances for Yukino because she doesn't think her qualities could measure to Yukino's.<br><br>Of course, by meta standards everything she's done makes Yui the girl with the biggest heart and virtue for heroines.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck you Watari you moneyfag,<br>stop giving us false hope.</br></br></br>  <br>8man didn't let her sink everyone's ship, you damn well know that he wouldn't let her do that.<br><br>I am just wondering if Yui would still want him even if she knew he truly loved her and only her.</br></br></br>  Does 8man like Yui or Yukino more? He's so fucking wishy washy in terms of his feelings<br><br> Comments about how Yukino is beautiful all the time and shows jealousy but we never get an explicit "Yes I like you" <br> Slowly has become more receptive towards Yui and her advances to the point of "Supposing if". But thats the thing, with Yui its "someday", "maybe", "supposing" <br><br>Just pick a fucking girl</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well duh, but Watari has to make that path on a bed of broken glass and rusty nails for our hearts.</br></br>  <br>Well Watari crushed Yukinofags in Volume 11 while raising the hopes of Yui (and Iroha)fags</br>  <br>He is a man that is shooting for the stars. Instead of hating him you should bless him and support him with your heart.</br>  <br>Remember, Anon. Romance is only 20% from the overall story. And most of it are leaning towards Yui. But since the rest of 80% are not hers. So it seems like she was being overshadowed.<br><br>Also, both Haruno and 8man know what's up with Yukino.</br></br></br>  How the hell is Watari going to make an ending where everyone is happy? Didnt he say somewhere that he thanked everyone for the support and love the readers gave the main trio?  <br>Iroha is pretty obvious at this point, just saiyan.</br>  <br>The story has honestly been Yukino's since Volume 6. Its just that Hachiman is the viewpoint character and that it is his actions in response to Yukino that drives the overall plot (and romance subplot)</br>  <br> And most of it are leaning towards Yui. </br>  <br> implying he didn't plan a "reunited with kouhai after became an adult several years later" ending. <br> implying WW kouhai was real and not some fan teasing/spoiler </br></br>  <br> Well duh <br>There is a theory going around that Yui fell out of love with Hikki. If she thought Hikki loved her then she might be turned off and call him gross, the only way to know for sure is to have him confess to her.</br></br>  <br>This. Everytime I try to point this out, and saying that this is a very notable advantage for Yui, both Irohafags and Yukinofags come and bitch and throw out silly delusions out of their asses.<br>Just face it, faggots, only Yui got the advantage of having 8man's number, what's more, hers is the only number he got. That itself is yet another huge advantage.<br>Yui will win, the other 2 aren't interested/genuine enough.</br></br></br>  <br>the trio grows up and still remains friends.</br>  <br>If Haruno is always right, then is she right when she keeps saying that Hachiman is/will be Yukino's boyfriend (and her future brother in law)</br>  <br> he didn't read the LN </br>  <br>Wait, what about previous chapters?<br>And why Spyro stopped at chapter 1?</br></br>  <br>But Anon, I am a Yukinofag.<br><br>He doesn't have her number or any contact info because  they aren't friends. </br></br></br>  <br>The false flagging is strong here.</br>  <br><br>That theory was built on a misunderstanding that Yui tried to sink her own ship to help Yukino.<br><br>She still loves 8man, but she thinks she's already lost to Yukino, because of the nurse office scene.</br></br></br></br>    <br>She is also right about Yukino won't be chosen again.</br>  <br>Or Yui growing jealous and haring her.</br>  so..who won?  <br><br><br>See? It's just as I said, everytime it's the same shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Well that and Chocolate making event. Yui thinks she has no chance but 8man's monologue suggests that maybe she supposedly does. If his feelings for her morph into something special. Maybe. Someday<br><br>Yeah I may wish to start a romance with Yui but I dont know what I want. And there's still Yukino and her request that will determine the fate of the series more than anything<br><br>Like honestly, all Vol 11 did was put Yui and Yukino on equal playing fields and the ball is in Hachiman's court in Vol 12 to choose a girl either as a result of or at least being partially influenced and his request and Yukino's</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watari's editor.</br>  <br>Pic related, it's Watari and his editors.</br>  Watari still has not explicitly told us Yukino's family problems yet<br><br>What the hell is he waiting for</br></br>  <br><br>Not sure how having her number is a big advantage he doesn't make a big deal about it and was more impacted when Totsuka gave him his number.</br></br>  <br>aparently volume 12</br>  <br>Vol12.</br>  <br>8man doesnt need Yuki's number anyways if they become a couple<br><br>Haruno will just magically appear whenever Hachiman cant contact Yukino</br></br></br>  <br>They're never going to become a major plotpoint. 8man won't be personally involved in Yukino's family because it has nothing to do with him.</br>  <br> the ball is in Hachiman's court in Vol 12 to choose a girl <br>Dude, it will kill 8man to think that he has to choose one over the other. That fact alone will mindfuck him for awhile once he stops being in denial that both of them love him.</br></br>  <br>Need an undressing Iroha tbh</br>  <br>Well it affects Yukino and what Yukino decides to do in the future affects both Yui and Hachiman since they both care for her <br><br> Yeah my mom wishes me to marry Hayama-kun to maintain family relationships <br> Hachiman monologue about nauseating feeling again or some shit <br><br>Was that so hard Watari</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it IS kind of weird they still didn't exchange contact info. I mean Yukino is autistic and all, we all know that, but after almost a year this shit doesn't make any sense at all. And there's even less sense with Iroha. From what we've learned about her, you'd have expected her to exchange contacts with 8man back in Vol.9, or even before in Vol.8, because there's no proper explanation as to why a character like her still didn't obtained such an easy target. I'm really starting to think that WW is just a hack writer, this shit remind me so much of that other nonsensical reaction we got from Yui in Vol.2, but that was still forgivable, since the story was still at the beginning, and mistakes can be made by amateur writers at the beginning of their stories. But now we're way over 10 volumes, and sometimes his characters still act/react totally OoC. How could people still call him a good writer will always be an enigma to me. Too much forced drama, too much OoC, too much pretentious and over-the-line reactions.<br>And there's people who got the galls to compare WW to Nisio. Ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>Iroha had Hachiman's phone in Vol 10.5 and you bet she programmed her number into his phone</br>  <br>see<br><br> silly delusions out of their asses <br>Gotta admit, sometimes you Irohafags are REALLY delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Phone numbers should only be exchanged with friends Anon.</br>  Watari made the scrunchies reappear in one of the BD side novel correct?<br><br>He brought up the Pan-San Hachiman won her in Vol 3 at Destinyland. Will he bring back the "mystery" thing Yukino put away after the amusement park ride (the photo of them)?<br><br>Will be bring back Sables dog collar too?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Hachiman and Yukino are not friends as of Volume 11.</br>  <br>Not him, but my old clubmates from college had my phone number and I had theirs. And I'm sure as hell we weren't friends.</br>  <br>Iroha is kinda like a friend, though...<br>Okay, I decided. I will blame Watari, too.</br></br>  <br>Stop trying to bait and make the thread last longer. Just let it die you motherfucker</br>  <br><br>If Yukino is so dependent on 8man why doesn't she have his number to depend on him?</br></br>  <br>So it's confirmed that it's Irohafags who are using Yuckyno? Good, thanks for the info.</br>  ITT: everybody getting triggered by baits and falseflags  <br>That wasn't really bait, but you're right on th second one.

Wait for vol 12 to see if WW remembers that plot or not</br></br>  <br> WW either didn't mean anything by it <br><br>This is just stupid. Authors always need to rack their brain to think some plots or events.  Except some hack authors who copy ideas from other people of course. </br></br></br>  <br><br>I think 8man just don't care<br><br>Like, did he ever stop Iroha from doing ANYTHING? He always stop Yukino or Yui from doing stupid shit.<br><br>He used her to indulge with shallow stuff such as date play and flirting because it was fun and comfortable. Things that 8man hates the most.<br><br>I pity Iroha, she want the genuine and she got the least genuine things in return.<br><br>Inb4 bait, no, this is not a bait. I legit concerned for Iroha right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off denialfag.</br>  <br> Inb4 bait, no, this is not a bait. I legit concerned for Iroha right now. <br><br>It would suck if Iroha is a timid girl about love (like YYx2). But too bad that's not the case. So if 8man just keep going easy on her, he is gonna  take responsibility  soon.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not in denial, Iroha loves 8man, but her feelings were much deeper than what he felt about her.<br><br>8man used her, that's a fact.<br><br><br>Maybe that too, but it will be yet another thoughtless action done by him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Well, we are in complete darkness after all. Not much we could do. As we’re stuck in this avidya of darkness, we were assaulted by uneasiness and the act of grabbing hold of a person’s clothes and holding each other’s hands were countermeasures, so I won’t question it. No worries, recently, I held hands with Komachi, so I am to-totally, like totally not fretting over it or anything, like super easily endurable. <br><br>Hikki a qt.</br></br>  <br> 8man used her, that's a fact. <br>Is this a new meme?</br></br>  <br>Iroha is not a drama queen and is too willful, unlike Yui and yukino. She doesn't do stupid shit either, so there's nothing for 8man to stop her from.</br>  <br> Maybe that too, but it will be yet another thoughtless action done by him. <br><br>It's every asian man dream to have one (or two) female soulmate. And it's not likely to be the wife.<br><br>So thoughtless or not doesn't matter, since "genuine marriage" isn't the thing 8man was searching for anyway.<br><br><br>To be frankly, it's obvious to anyone who read the LN is that 8man and Yukino will finally befriend in the end.  He and Yui could be dating for a while but break up shortly after. They would still remain to be close friends though. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   licensed by yp <br>Enjoy waiting for 4-5 years for translations to catch up.</br>  Soon.  <br> Iroha is not a drama queen and is too willful, unlike Yui and yukino.  <br>The whole fucking drama is all about deep and meaningful relationship.<br><br>Guess what exactly Iroha and Hachiman's current relationship is?<br>  She doesn't do stupid shit either, so there's nothing for 8man to stop her from. <br>You'd think he knows better than indulge in pointless romance like that.

His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called "Titans" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted "Titan Survey Corps" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what "freedom" means to him in a new world ruled by fear.<br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br> Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead <br> It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life <br> During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack <br> It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on <br> Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him <br> At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly <br><br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128163299#p128163299">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still doesn't change the fact that I don't care about those three and the movie looks really bad.</br>  <br>Then just don't watch it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128206469 <br>Why did you delete?</br>  <br>What an ingenious idea.

Not to mention how hard it would be to acquire another one when it's Hell on Earth. There's something fishy.</br>  <br>Dem thighs.</br>  <br>Every single panel featuring the pilot suggest that he is on a solo mission. This makes little sense for a multitude of reasons if they were on a retrieval mission and had non-fucked amounts of manpower. Helicopters aren't really disposable either, nor are people that can fly them.<br><br>Was it clear that they actually developed the disease? The levels of preparation might also suggest a more Fallout-ish scenario - somebody is aware of the possible threat and is building shelters and handing out survival manuals. An evil corporation wouldn't just hand out confidential, sealed documents to a freaking teacher. The chance of them getting leaked would be too high.<br><br>I think I'll just stop speculating and enjoy the ride. There's barely any info given to us regarded the whole mess.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a good chance they developed it. There's a lot of cryptic background notes about chemicals in the water, and a past incident where half the population just disappeared. However, it doesn't mean they're totally evil. Corporations are made of people. The ideologies of the company itself might be evil, but there's often a good conscious keeping it from going full tilt. Like with Google.</br>    <br>The costs are nothing compared to a more valuable, healthy person. Healthy manpower can build shit like those, damn the expense as we are in an emergency situation.<br>Also, transport choppers are cheaper compared to attack choppers which would have been escorting the chopper if it was a rescue mission. Plus more guys on it loaded for bear. But judging from the suitcase of the pilot, it really looked like it is just a routine collection</br></br>  <br>It does make sense to send an infected pilot alone if you send them at all, though. Infection symptoms and bitefights in the cockpit don't sound particularly good no matter how many guys you brought.<br><br>Ideally you'd want non-infected, healthy pilots, but maybe they don't have enough of them to spare. Or risking them for this mission is too much of a liability.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I think too. It seems weird for a truly malicious corporation to take so many measures to ensure the well-being of the people they supposedly intend to use as test subjects.<br><br>They still likely developed the virus but they also clearly didn't want things to get too bad in case of an outbreak. They knew things could go horribly wrong and took measures to attempt and minimize the damage in case it did.</br></br></br>   tfw the biker bros were just trying to warn the group the dangers of the people in the Uni, but are too jaded by the apocalypse to approach them in a friendly way   <br> skindentation <br><br>This mangaka needs to do porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they just heard the racket and came running with baseball bats, not knowing what to expect. The girls pretty much just ran away at first glance on them.</br>  <br>I would love to see a bunch of random army grunts with no education in engineering build a chopper from scraps. It's not about money, it's about helicopters being limited as fuck.<br><br>The other thing that is expensive and rare are pilots. Everybody can be trained to be a soldier in an emergency. WW2 is a good example of that. Give a man a gun, train him in using it and let him run at the enemy. Cheap and disposable. A pilot on the other hand requires years of expensive training and not everybody is suited for the job, especially if it is a combat pilot. Expensive, limited, and have to be responsible for not getting everybody around and under them killed.<br><br>Now, in a zombie apocalypse manpower obviously becomes MUCH more valuable and even a grunt isn't something you could just toss away, but the same thing applies to pilots. If they were limited and expensive before now they are worth their weight in solid gold.<br><br>The odd thing about this is him being infected tho.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one word they said here translates to stop, but literally means "stand still". However, this isn't the original, so it could've been a loose translation from Japanese as well.</br>  <br>Why is a boy wearing garters.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to Miki.</br>  <br>You have manual labor though. Better to have healthy persons build shit than infected ones that can cause delays.<br>And that is the point. He was infected and it would be more prudent to send him than a healthy pilot. He is good as lost if there was no cure and sending an infected on a potentially high risk area is acceptable. Besides, it is just basic flying not ACM which requires time. Even a civvie can land a plane with instructions from control tower alone. I do not think it would take that time to train someone just to fly around and look for things. Combat pilots are the ones that take time.</br></br>  <br>You are a faggot for making me post in the wrong thread.<br><br>Phone posting so no images. The pilot was most likely Ground JSDF because of the helicopter and gear: UH-1 Huey, Sig P220 pistol and that type 88 helmet. The gas mask I got no idea, but the rest is standard issue for ground force. The other branches don't use the huey.</br></br></br>  <br> boy </br>  <br>If it is JSDF, does that mean Japan is fucked?</br>  <br>Sending him by helicopter seems a bit weird though. Let's assume he's as good as done for, but gets selected / volunteers for a rescue / sample collection mission. Would you really give him a helicopter that he could potentially crash and kill everybody around him? This would be especially true if he was sent to exterminate the girls and bring the samples back (if it was a case where they needed survivors dead at any cost they would send a squad of healthy men).<br><br>Why not just send him by car or let another guy fly him in. The car would take time, but he'd eventually get there with a much lower risk of losing something valuable or getting people killed. Unless all comms are dead he could call in a chopper after he makes sure they are fine if he was there to rescue the girls.<br><br><br>If the JSDF sends a single infected man with just a single handgun in a single chopper for 3 girls it dun look too good to me. At the very least it is wide-spread. Otherwise there would be search choppers all over the place. Japan isn't exactly poor.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> boy <br>I love this meme.</br></br>  <br>Probably because it will take time? Let us also assume while he is planning to take samples, it might also include getting the girls out of there ASAP. You do not want the subjects to turn before you can get the samples while they are still human aftet all.</br>  Any /tg/ drawfags here? Somebody needs to draw Kurumi in Nurgle Chaos Space Marine armor wielding a Chain-Shovel. It needs to happen  <br> chain-shovel <br>Fund it.</br></br>  <br>Also no point of having another pilot fly him, moreso if pilot is healthy. If one man can do the job then that is enough.<br>Let us also assume that while he may seem expendable, they do not want to lose him or the chopper as much as possible because he would be still useful flying more missions. Now probably due to the nature of the mission, he was considered an acceptable loss if things do not proceed as planned.</br></br>  <br>Somebody post a high-res pic of Kurumi with her Shovel, I'll try it.</br>  <br>Then why use a corpse-candidate as a pilot if speed and reliability are important? Either everybody involved is disposable or not. <br><br>It makes sense sending an infected if it is a low-priority mission, but you wouldn't give him a chopper unless everybody else that can use it is already dead or there's way too many lying around for the amount of people that can use them. You don't half-ass in an apocalypse.<br><br>I'm starting to think that Japan is simply fucked and this was some desperate mercy mission or something. Get them out or at least give them a clean death, but there was nobody else to send so they went with the infected pilot. I mean, the letter was hella cute.<br><br>Since the syringes weren't clearly visible they may have been with a little bit of serum in them or empty. Markers on the map may have been known safe-zones.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose it could make sense. This also means that Japan is fucked tho.</br>  <br>Chopper is probably written off as an acceptable loss. Anything to get there immediately depending on the mission, just not attack choppers or Chinooks if the JSDF are operating them. They are more important than Hueys</br>  Oh shit.  stronk  <br>Best one I could find.</br>  Goddamn Kurumi unf  <br>Seems like a normal spade.</br>  <br> Best girl polishing her rod </br>  <br>Rii really was depending on Yuki so looking back I can see why she got so angry.</br>  <br>It's anything but normal if it hasn't broken after months of heavy usage.</br>  <br>She got experience in maintaining wood.</br>  <br>Maybe she  replaces it. </br>  <br> Was Miki trying to wake up Yuki by just showing the zombies up close and what they are? Miki is kinda mean hearted, but not wrong about Yuki's personality yet kinda going the wrong way about it.  </br>  <br>I can attest. She sure maintains my wood. Hard.</br>  <br> wake up <br>Miki never believed her to be insane. I think she believed Yuki is making it up as an excuse to stay "useless".

As soon as Marika gets dumped shit will hit the fan.   there's actual spoilers for nisekoi now <br><br>wow</br></br>  Reminder.  <br>nah. She explained to Raku that all forms of love of love are real. USED THE WORDS FALSE LOVE. Possibly enabling him to accept his feelings for Chitoge.</br>  <br>Pure idiocy. Senjogahara was chosen by the fucking end of the first arc.</br>  Goddamn this fucking bullshit going the Toradora route. Onodera bestgirl4life. Shitoge a shit.  is she gonna kill him?  <br>Onodera is not even best Onodera.</br>  <br>You do know Nekomonogatari happened chronologically before Bakemonogatari and Crab. He even had this "is this shit love or lust?" part in it, and contemplated on marrying Cat.<br><br>You probably didn't even watch beyond Bakemonogatari.  I understand, both series are shit harem series anyway. </br></br></br>  <br> You do know Nekomonogatari happened chronologically before Bakemonogatari and Crab <br>Doesn't matter, as Nekomonogatari is not the first arc.<br><br>No one would be reading Nisekoi if the first arc was him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened.</br></br></br></br>   there are actually people who think someone will win this in the next five years <br><br>Author's gonna milk this cash cow as long as he can by last-second asspulling reasons why nobody can win the Rakubowl, over and over, like he always has.</br></br>    <br> Doesn't matter, as Nekomonogatari is not the first arc. <br>Actually, it's the second arc, just after Kizu and before Bake. Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes.<br><br> No one would be reading Nisekoi if the first arc was him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened. <br>Not the point of the screencapped post though.<br><br>Kosaki was choronologically first girl, just like Cat. Chitoge was the first girl in the first season, just like Senjougahara.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually, it's the second arc, just after Kizu and before Bake.

Not even in a Nisekoi thread people want to talk about Nisekoi.  <br><br>Chronologically. That means the whole Cat arc happened before Senjougahara even appeared. It's the same thing with Kosaki. She was in the Rakubowl way before Chitoge appeared.<br><br>It's not about the what Nisio wrote first or what the anime adapted first, it's all about the story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is you said "It´s the first season that aired, yes" <br>Implying that the novel order is different and it´s not.</br></br>  <br> Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes. <br>It is the first arc, you dumb fuck. It was the first LN too.<br><br><br> Kosaki was choronologically first girl, just like Cat.

This would've been alot shorter if you just told me this from the beginning, sheesh. Still not sure why you're so mad over this, seeing I've been repeating "chronologically" all this time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Autism.   raku giving a response in the same chapter <br>Holy shit color me surprised. And here I was expecting Komi to somehow handwave this plot and bring it up again in 100 chapters.<br><br>Especially when raku went<br> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS <br>I kind of expected him not to recognice the confession as a confession despite Yui basically screaming that she wants his babies.</br></br></br></br></br>  My favorite picture of Onodera  <br> I kind of expected him not to recognice the confession as a confession <br>And he didn't. She had to repeat herself.</br></br>  WHEN WILL I BE FREE FROM THIS CURSE KNOWN AS NISEKOI???<br><br>I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!</br></br>  Why the fuck do I enjoy reading this shit so much? Like I adore these characters but there is literally 0 plot advancement, yet this has taken the spot of my 2nd favorite manga. It just makes me so happy. Am I autistic?  I like Tsugumi's boobs.  <br><br>Nothing wrong with enjoying things, dude.</br></br>   fade to black <br><br>They fucked didn't they?</br></br>   178 chapters <br><br>You could have fully read several great mangos in that time. Think about that for a little while.</br></br>  <br> I adore these characters. <br>Well there's your answer.<br><br>Nothing wrong there. These are top tier girls for the most part.</br></br></br></br>  Holy fucking shit this chapter, JUST FUCKING FUCK THE BLONDE BITCH AND END THIS SERIES FAGGOT.  <br>He needs to set up a proper WA2 ending first</br>  Who cares if the plot moves or not?<br><br>Do you actually think it's a good plot?</br></br>  <br><br>No. I actually enjoy shitting on this manga more than I enjoy reading it.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like /a/</br>   f/a/ggots actually want this to end <br>I hope it continues forever. Make it a slice of life manga.</br>  d-don't mind me, just posting best girl!  <br>Losers not allowed.</br>  <br> Make it a slice of life manga. <br><br>Wait, it isn't?</br></br></br>  <br>So adorable. I literally got into Nisekoi because I got a postcard from my weeb sister with Chitoge, Raku, and Onodera on it and thought she looked so cute.</br>  <br> weeb sister <br><br>Did you fuck her?</br></br></br>  <br>it's clearly a adventure seinen</br>  <br>No t yet </br>  <br>I want to make Yui reach her climax.</br>  <br>the mangaka is really talented. the way he frames and presents the story, and the way his characters are all likeable and fun. the overall plot doesn't really matter that much in these kinds of series, but it's by no means bad. characters develop slowly. the dramatic bits never weigh down the manga's fun overtone but still manage to make you care about the characters and feel a little suspense.<br><br>it's a good snack.</br></br></br>  <br>But why'd you post Chitoge?</br>  <br>You'd make a good dodgy car salesman</br>  <br>I've been reading this kind of shit since the first time I read Love Hina on a cjb site. Nisekoi is really good.</br>  So, the whole purpose of Yui-nee was making that faggot realise he likes Chitoge. Based Shuu helped a lot.  I'm so fucking glad RedHawk are the ones releasing Nisekoi. Imperial Scans did a shitty job.  I hope Komi Naoshi isn't a faggot and makes Y-san win the Marikabowl in the manga  <br>Y-San is the hero we don't deserve.</br>  <br>Y-san mai husbando</br>  <br>I knew it. The shitty fucking tsundere is gonna win. Fuck this shitty fucking predictable as fuck manga and fuck you Komi.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED.</br></br></br>  <br>But I'm a Tsugumifag.</br>  <br> the shitty tsundere <br>I know you're just fishing for replies, but what exactly is wrong with a Chitoge end? Especially with the improved Chitoge?</br></br>  <br>I agree with all of this but Komi's blueballing every time plot progression is hinted still rustles me.</br>  <br> Marika gets dumped <br> implying she won't get killed off in a way that makes even dense-as-fuck Raku realize the importance of letting people know your feelings before it's too late <br><br><br> him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened. <br>Ah yes, the hit TV show How I Met Your Grandmother<br><br><br>Stereotypical tsundere twin tails always wins, first girl always wins, people not liking how they made Chitoge so shitty of a tsundere in the beginning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't deserve it, she was abusive and still in denial about her feelings and she swooped in first chapter. <br>Meanwhile Onodera has been loving Raku since middle school, worked her ass off to get into the same high school and is honest with her feelings. Yes, there is the entire spaghetti bullshit that Raku shows too but that's mostly the author's shitty writing to delay the series until Chitoge wins. In all honesty, Onodera should have won by now. Raku was about to confess before the series started but again, harem trope bullshit stood in the way. <br><br>In all honesty, I'm sick of this series, we know how it's going to end, so just Komi, fucking end it now so I can close this stupid book and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Stereotypical tsundere twin tails always wins <br>Well, there's always Saekano...<br> first girl always wins <br>Nothing inherently wrong with that<br> people not liking how they made Chitoge so shitty of a tsundere in the beginning <br>Oh come on, that's ancient history. And if people are so concerned about development/progression to the point of exasperation when it doesn't happen in Nisekoi, why discount Chitoge's character growth? That just sounds inconsistent to me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128196943 <br> kosako </br>  <br>Several reasons. Get ready for some tl;dr.<br><br>1. It's so fucking predictable. It's always the first girl introduced that ends up winning in the end so all this bullshit drama is completely unnecessary and pads out this sorry excuse of a story.<br><br>2. Because modern tsunderes are all the fucking same. They start off as complete abusive and psychotic bitches that everyone fucking hates and finally when they start warming up dumbasses in the fanbase start liking her while smart people remember what an absolute fucking bitch they were. It's pathetic.<br><br>3. People who like tsunderes are absolute retarded faggots. Their excuse for liking tsunderes is "It feels like taming a lion." No it fucking doesn't. The MC ending up with a tsundere means that he got pussy-whipped.<br><br>4. Because modern tsunderes are all fucking horrible. We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night. Tsundere initially meant someone who's initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time (i.e. Rin). This change of behavior is permanent, and that's where the classic tsundere type is different form the modern tsundere). Today's tsunderes are those that switch between hostile (and sometimes even violent) and lovestruck personalities over and over again to the point of being schizophrenic (i.e. Shitoge). Guys don't find that attractive IRL. We find it fucking crazy and steer clear of that shit. Classic tsunderes I'm cool with. Modern tsunderes are complete psychobitches. <br><br>5. Because modern tsunderes win all the fucking time and I'm God damn sick of it.<br><br>There. Those are my reasons. Yes this is tl;dr, I don't give a shit. I'm mad. Fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw you will read a chapter where kosaki gets rejected and suffers in this lifetime <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br> Oh come on, that's ancient history. <br>People don't forget faggot. And IRL, first impressions are key to forming a relationship. If you meet a girl and here first instinct is to act like a total bitch to you, then you fucking walk away and find someone else. Chitoge is a fucking bitch.</br></br>  ONODERA IS GOING TO LOSE HAHAHA  <br>That'll likely not happen, I doubt it'll get that far.<br>We'll probably end with Raku realizing his feelings and confessing to Chitoge and that'll be the end. If anything, we'll see the reactions and everyone will be happy for them. The end, happily ever after.  It's stupid. </br></br>  <br> I've never interacted with anyone in real life ever: The Post </br>  <br> several reasons <br>Did you really type all of that just now? You basically say the same thing in reasons 2 and 4. 1 and 5 too. 3 is generalization. And does it really matter what she did in the past if it didn't have lasting negative consequences for anyone? MC likes her and cares about her, he isn't playing the fake love game anymore. She gets along with everyone. No one remembers or cares if she used to DK except fans like you.<br><br><br> And IRL, first impressions are key to forming a relationship <br>I think you missed the part in this manga where their relationship began as a reluctant arrangement for ceasefire between two mobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That never happened.</br>  <br>Well then enlighten me smartass. Have you ever met and formed a relationship with an IRL modern tsundere?</br>  I'm a Chitogefag but even I can feel the sorrow that will be the chapter where Onodera gets eliminated from the run.  <br>Yes I did type all that. Bare with me, I'm an angry drunk. I'm just fucking sick of tsunderes winning all the time.</br>  I dropped this shit 5 months ago<br><br>If there is any chance Tsugumi wins the bowl i'm reading it again<br><br>Should i?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lel, get fucked kosaki fag</br>  <br>Honestly I don't care who Raku ends up with. I just fucking hate Shitoge.</br>  <br> We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night.  <br><br>Stopped reading there gr8 b8 m8</br></br></br>  <br> IRL modern tsundere <br><br>I've formed a relationship with somebody that has grown on me, yes.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm just fucking sick of tsunderes winning all the time <br>Take a break from anime then and start reading manga. Good ones. There aren't many modern tsunderes, or any tsunderes for that matter, if you know which kinds to read. And go easy on the drink.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it, why not? I've had Vagabond on my backlog for a while now so I think I'll just read that. Sorry if I came off like an asshole.</br>  <br> Take a break from anime then and start reading manga. <br>But Nisekoi IS a manga...</br></br>  <br> Good ones. <br>C'mon Ralph, you're not THAT stupid.</br></br>  <br>Post a pic then faggot.</br>  <br>Name 10 good tsunderes then.</br>   mfw I read this chapter. <br><br>It's really ending, huh? Onodera is going to lose and we're gonna get some kind of bullshit ending like in the one shot. They killed of Yui in a graceless manner and it's only a matter of time before Marika is too sick to go to the hospital.<br><br>This is too much. I can't take it.</br></br></br></br>  I don't care who wins as long as it's not Onodera.<br><br>I absolutely hate these perfect girls who have a personality of being cute and being in love with the protagonist. Add whatever to it, tsun, kuu, dan, fuck, just give them anything that makes me think they have a life outside of being in love with the protagonist.</br></br>  <br>There are zero good tsunderes</br>  <br> They killed of Yui in a graceless manner <br>She's a chinese mafia boss responsible for countless murders and human trafficking.<br>I say she hasn't suffered enough</br></br></br>  Im ok with Chitoge winning, Onodera's mine    <br>Raku's father is the head of the Yakuza.<br>Chitoge's father/mother is the head of the Mafia.<br>Tsugumi has literally killed people.<br>Marika's Dad is the head of the police and she uses the police as her personal army.<br><br>The only ones who aren't blameless are the Onoderas. That's why they're perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BTFO<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>stay mad that your shitty waifu lost</br>  <br>Onodera sisters are great for fapping to<br>That's the best I can say, they're like Snake from Gatari</br></br>  <br> Implying Mamadera hasn't pulled some nasty shit behind the scenes to keep her business afloat amidst all the competition. <br><br>Yakuza bosses are one thing but local business owners can be cutthroat as hell, especially in food service.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The only ones who aren't blameless are the Onoderas <br><br> Implying their bakery isn't a front for money laundering <br>Why do you think her mother had her daughter spend the summer with a yakuza and mafia kid when she was little? Normal parents wouldn't allow that</br></br></br></br>  <br> Marika's Dad is the head of the police and she uses the police as her personal army. <br>Not to mention he's corrupt as shit since he hasn't bothered arresting anyone</br></br>  <br>That means the only blameless girl is Ruri</br>  <br>Good. Neutral party only reading for ShuuxRuri here, but having the manga end with a paring that could have been accomplished the first chapter had Raku not been a coward is a boring ending.</br>  <br>even more of a violent cunt than Chitoge. At least Chitoge is cute.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>This would be funny if I didn't want to cry. I can't believe he's actually resolving things. Onodera is gonna get BTFO and the chapter is going to be horrible.<br><br>I can already see Onodera trying to look touch and then crying into Ruri's shoulder.<br><br>Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This is not a good feel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How would you even launder money while running a bakery?</br>  <br> I can already see Onodera trying to look touch and then crying into Ruri's shoulder. <br>I'm a Chitogefag but, I just can't handle girls crying. Onodera is a cute girl and her losing scene will break my heart as much as yours.  It won't happen for at least another two years though </br></br>  <br>Shit, I meant to write tough, but good enough.<br><br> Spoiler <br>That just makes it worse. It's like knowing you're going to be executed, but have no idea when. It's that slow wait to death. Ugh.<br><br>It's gonna be as horrible as Hanekawa crying.<br><br>At least this won't be animated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this won't be animated <br>Don't count on that, Nice Koi is a cashcow. Sure, SHAFT's got Gatari and Madoka, but they have no expectations to live up to with Koi. It's a low-risk investment, and it sold decently enough, right?</br></br>  <br>Onodera didn't do a shit. She deserves losing.</br>  <br>She had so many fucking chances. She deserves it at this point.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how much it sold, but more than likely not as much as S1.<br><br><br>She told him that she wanted to kiss.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Kosaki haters use logic </br>  <br> He hasn't read the manga </br>  <br><br>Reminder that Raku falling asleep mid conversation is the worst plot protection Komi has done<br>She should've won right then and there but the arc had to make Chitoge less of a shit</br></br></br>  <br>It was about Onodera deserving to lose</br>  <br>Komi basically committed a war crime with that bullshit.</br>  <br>T-that's actually pretty accurate.</br>  <br>"eliminated"</br>  <br>But you will still read it.<br>  you know you will and you can't refute me  </br></br>   double arts gets canceled <br> people eat up this generic shit <br><br>fuck this gay earth</br></br></br>  Why am I even reading this shit anymore. It was so obvious that Chitoge is going to win. Poor girl doesn't deserve the rejection.  <br>Hey otter.</br>  <br> Tohsaka Rin <br><br>No wonder you hate Chitoge. You just have serious shit tastes.<br><br>Thank God many more anime and manga will fuck over your tastes. I just hope you don't post so much because people like you cry so hard every time and it's actually annoying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> crying <br>It'll probably look like pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck.<br>Fuck.<br><br>I didn't want to see this.<br><br><br>Fucdk<br>asfla;sfja</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Marika is going to win... right?<br><br>She is definitely the promised girl.</br></br>  <br>I finally found the proper face for this picture.<br><br> mfw </br></br></br>  Don't forget that Chitoge told Raku she has someone she likes. <br><br>It feels like she did it weeks ago thanks to the break last week, but in-universe it was like 2/3 days ago.</br></br>  I want more Paula Mccoy  Holy fuck there's some real shit happening in Nisekoi.<br><br>Can Komi troll his way back to status quo on this one?</br></br>  <br>Best Girl will be kill. <br><br>You may screencap this.</br></br></br>  <br>Reading shit like this makes me glad I'm an unlovable miscreant.</br>  <br>Where were you when we finally got freed of Tsugumifags?</br>  <br>Let us come together and pray.</br>  <br>It's worse than that, this isn't about cash this is about revenge. This is punishment. This is what you'll be reading in hell for eternity.</br>  <br>What you are even doing here? Tsugushit is 100% irrelevant now.</br>  <br>Double arts would have ended poorly after 80 chapters, anyway, man. It's best to just let go.</br>  <br> the way his characters are all likeable and fun <br> Raku <br> likeable <br><br> the way he frames and presents the story <br> best characters like Shoe and Ruri barely get any time <br> they'll never fuck </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> first girl always wins <br><br>Except in Kangoku Gakuen, but that's only because the author deliberately shits on manga tropes.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't.<br><br>It updates never.</br></br></br>  <br> progression <br> in my nisekoi <br>What the fuck is happening?</br></br></br>  <br> onodera is confessing <br> one-shot situation is happening <br> "onodera, i have to go to her" <br> raku resuces chitoge <br> "raku, i..." <br> "IM SORRY EVERYONE BUT I DONT KNOW HOW TO BE A MAN WITH MY FEELINGS YET IVE ABUSED YOUR LOVE I MUST DEVELOP INTO THE KIND OF PERSON WHO ISNT SO FLIPPANT AND CRUEL TO GIRLS" <br> raku leaves for college, onodera goes back to america, sister goes to china, cancer dies, and the onoderas stay in shitsville to make cookies <br><br>Please, pretend like anything else will be the ending. I fucking dare you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are getting rid of yet another irrelevant worst grill.</br>  Raku will get knocked out and get selective amnesia, forgetting all progression these past few chapters -- I'm calling it now  <br><br> it's always the first girl introduced <br><br>I'll give you this, it's even worse with all this tug of war status quo bullshit.<br><br> Their excuse for liking tsunderes is "It feels like taming a lion." <br><br>Hahaha what? I like tsunderes because when they get affectionate it's cuter and feels like it means more than the girls who are just constantly affectionate toward MC.<br><br>Seriously though, what really matters with Nisekoi is: Chitoge is cute, Onodera is cute, Yui is cute, Haru is cute, Ruri is cute, Marika is SHIT, and Tsugumi is  best girl .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just can't deal with this anymore.</br>   people acting like Raku is picking Chitoge in the next chapter <br> implying we're not going to have 50+ more chapters of this flip flop indecisive bullshit so that you can all pretend like the main girl won't win </br>  <br> Marika is SHIT <br><br>Opinion discarded. Let's see who this homosexual likes then.<br><br> Tsuguturd <br><br>I fucking knew it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Chitoge wins Rakubowl <br> Tsugumi wins by proxy <br><br>Goooood. Gooooood.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsugumi wins by proxy <br><br>Tsugutumors are this delusional and desperate.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsugu-who?</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  I just got off the phone with Komi, he says Onodera will win.  <br>I just got off the phone with Y-san, he says that's not gonna happen.</br>  God these threads have turned to shit. Is this anything like when Kirino won?  <br> God these threads have turned to shit. <br><br>Been here since the start of Nisekoi. Nothing has changed.<br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cat btfo <br>Never fails to bring me joy.</br></br>  <br>I just got off the phone with /a/non, he says he dropped this shit and that we'll see him next week.</br>  Does that mean I can start reading this now?  So, wait, plot is happening?<br><br>Is Raku going to carsurf through a firefight, soon?</br></br>  <br>With Yuri friendzoned it's only Onoderpa, Shitoge and Marika left. Things should be getting interesting.</br>  <br>Marika's going to lose next.  Serves that bitch right for having the worst attitude among the key girls.  She's going to get sick, and at the end of that arc, Raku will say something, then she's going to  live . Next will be Kosaki. It's going to be Chitoge end. Let's just hope Kosaki will be able to properly confess her feelings.</br>  <br>She will, and they'll go out for a while but she'll notice he likes Chitoge some way or another and push him in her direction.<br>It's harem writing 101.</br></br>  Reminder that Chitoge is not a Tsundere anymore. At least not as the shitty one she used to be the first 50 chapters.  <br>I don't think feet should work like that.</br>  <br>Raku is more of a tsundere than she is.</br>  Ruri x Shuu chapter when?  <br> Marika's going to lose next. <br>She never had a chance.</br></br>  <br>Naturally, she's had much of her tsundere arc.<br><br>He has absorbed all the tsun that has emanated off of her.</br></br></br>  <br>She deserves to win. She improved a lot, while Onodera is still Onodera.</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br> implying you can improve upon perfection </br>  I want Paula to win the Tsugumi and see lesbian action.    <br> Marika <br> Worst attitude <br><br>That would be Shitoge and Tsuguturd.</br></br></br></br>  rip  <br> stuttering and sweating profusely at the slightest sign of emotions <br> perfection </br></br>  <br> only one not hiding her feelings to Raku <br> only one being straightforward and honest <br> worst attitude </br></br></br>  You're all fucking idiots.<br>It's obviously going to be a harem end and he will be the head of the Yakuza.</br>   yfw a Haganai end happens and Paula wins   <br> crack shit <br>fuck off!</br></br>  And shit finally hits the fan.<br><br>How soon until everyone realizes Nisekoi wasn't really no-plot but just comfy?</br></br>  <br>I still have hope for her.  ;n; </br>  <br>Haganai didn't end yet.</br>  <br>You know that last book will be out in few months and Yukimura end won't happen?</br>  <br>IM FLIPPING MY FUCKING SHIT</br>  <br>rage moar fag.</br>   best friend   <br>What's wrong with Chitoge's foot?</br>  <br>not anymore </br>  <br>Dude... I could give u a hug. <br><br>U are Complet right</br></br></br>  <br> We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night. <br><br>opinion discarded</br></br></br>  Onodera Have all chances along over the Manga... she didn't deserves win.<br><br>Chitoge just have a Hack cos' of this false relationship AND She going a asshole muchtimelong.... This the reason cos' people dont like her too much</br></br>   Chitogefags <br><br>Either a newfag with less than 50 completed shows or autistic manchild. What they have in common is if you ask them what is the greatest love story ever told, they will answer Toradora.<br><br> Tsugumifags <br><br>"i want to suck dicks and gargle semen. im not gay tho lol" They think being "ironically" gay is cool. Fuccbois in denial. These faggots are destroying America.<br><br> Harufags <br><br>Memers. Some are fun to be with, but most of the time they are those obnoxious memespouter. Cancer.<br><br> Onoderabros <br><br>Bro tier with good taste. A decent human being who positively contributes in the society. Surrounded by genuine friends in real life.<br><br> Marikabros <br><br>Gentlemen with god tier taste. They skillfully hide their powerlevel in public and behave well in an anonymous online image board.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not him but tell me the last good tsundere they only i would say is Makise</br>  <br>Tsugumicancers are objectively the worst.</br>  <br>Nah... Harufags are worst. But but have a good tast for designing....</br>  <br> Bro tier with good taste. A decent human being who positively contributes in the society. Surrounded by genuine friends in real life. <br>opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>At least Harufags aren't destroying America.<br><br><br>Get lung cancer fucking Tsugushit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Much Better chose the blonde bitch asshole. you are right.</br>  <br><br> Chitogefaggot detected </br></br>  <br><br> he doesn't like onoshit so he is chitogefag <br>sorry but i like marika and stop being mad because you shitty girl lost</br></br></br>  <br>Its not for Marika, It's for Chitoge hirself.<br><br>I Cannot Like Her anymore after this.</br></br></br>  Yui Kosaki and Marika Said yours feelings for Raku.(Kosaki said 3 times atlast)<br><br>Chitoge had a such safezone 'cos this shit fakerelationship<br><br>Chitoge is the most Coward at last.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kosakifags, everyone.</br>  <br>Kosaki is the most passive worthless one out of the whole bunch. Even Yui took action this time.<br><br>Shitoge only needs to come out of the Raku closet and then Kosaki will be the single most worthless grill of the bunch. Not counting irrelevant characters like Haru and Tsugumi.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.... I think u have a point... it was bad...</br>  I can't believe.<br>Plot is moving.</br>  <br>Not this shit again. Kosaki took action 5 times but was shut down every single time by Komi's shit-tier writing. She even asked Raku to kiss her, jesus.</br>   Yui is actually kill <br><br>Wow, now she's gonna have to go fuck some chinese dude.<br><br>You fucked up Raku you niglet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's right.<br><br><br>Nobody cares of this anymore... old winds...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if that's a bait or that you are just retarded.</br>  <br>Now we'll get Yui doujins of her having sex with fat balding Chinese men to her disgust. All while crying about Raku.</br>  <br>I CARE ABOUT IT ANYWHERE! She is a Bitch for this! U Never Piss off people fealings! Only assholes do it... and Shitoge become a asshole too early... and still a asshole so much time. <br><br>If Marika never arive i'm prob drop or become a Onoderafag... then thanks Marika Shitoge&lt;a Shit</br></br></br>   all these butthurt kosakifags <br><br>Based Komi.</br></br>  <br>Kosakifags are on suicide watch.</br>  DUDE!

They are strong</br>  <br>I'm not, I just want this shit to be over with. The anticipation and waiting is worse than the action. Komi is essentially holding the gun and I'm yelling "do it!"</br>  It is out      <br>Done.</br>    It's a Metal Bat chapter <br><br>Cool.</br></br>  <br>This escalated quickly.</br>  <br>Murata is now competing with Dowman.</br>  <br>Is that psykos with a new body? Looks very similar.</br>  <br>4 pages?</br>   4 pages <br>Not going to lie, I love Murata</br>  <br>I think it's senior centipede</br>  Here are the cleans, uk<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/N5s3z</br></br>  <br>more pages are coming day 25~23 I think<br>since he posted these earlier</br></br>  bump until uk shows up  <br>That's Senior Centipede, I believe. One of the monsters that saved then tried to kill Garou after he went against the Monster Association. He got killed while Royal Ripper and Bug God survived.</br>  <br>at least we got another cute background girl</br>  Nagato's stern is very vulnerable.  <br>That left KTKM as the most well-adjusted</br>  <br>Torpedo Addict</br>  You can only have one of them. Which one will it be?  <br><br>Just for you</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Hey look, another tournament for Reiji to do nothing in.  <br>He did duel that one guy in a theatre.</br>  <br>I use him as a secret trump in DDD. Shit's great when you resolve it.</br>  So is tribute summoning not cool enough to have it's own world?  <br>Neither is ritual summoning apparently.</br>  <br>Ritual is probably TOO cool.</br>  Instead of always harping on a man's faults, tell him of his virtues. Try to pull him out of his rut of bad habits. Hold up to him his better self, his  /ai/ - Idle Activities  that can dare and do and win out.
