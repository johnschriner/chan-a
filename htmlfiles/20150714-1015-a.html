[ fact: legend of galactic heroes is the best anime to ever grace the earth  <br>What is a non-anime show in the genre that is actually good then?</br>  <br>Glad we agree on the animation.</br>  My friend asked me if i knew of anything that rivaled the great Picasso's 1937 masterpiece "Guernica."<br><br>I simply replied, "Ginga Eiyū Densetsu"</br></br>  <br> yamato and Gundam ripoff <br>They're genuinely nothing alike. You're just pulling names of shows out of your ass that you haven't even watched</br></br>  <br>Frederica is my waifu.</br>  Get in here and discuss why Hana is  the most entertaining girl, in my honest opinion. <br><br>Other boys and girls are welcome too.</br></br>  <br>She has feelings for him and is now wearing his drawers. She can probably play it off as embarrassing that she forgot she was wearing her boxers today and no one will question it; but in the back of her head is "oh god I'm wearing the underwear of who I just pissed on"</br>  <br>In what planet is it normal for a high school girl to piss in front of a hallway window.</br>  <br>Well hes also been in terminator warrior mode too, maybe he confronts her about something for once like why she kissed him. Then again he may end up being embarrassed and blushing in next chapter.</br>  <br>To be fair it would be fine if a girl saw her. She thought that all the guys were all in the same area, so there really wasn't much to lose.</br>  <br><br>Think he meant on paper. <br><br>Hormones and all.</br></br></br></br>  I have a theory:<br><br>People who don't like Cat have not read Nekomonogatari (White).<br><br>Or to put it another way, I can't imagine anyone not liking Hanekawa having read it. It had dimensions that got cut out of the adaptation.<br><br>With that out of the way, let the customary waifu wars commence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anti-Kaiki fag here is a shitposter in lots of monogatari threads. He basically posts the same thing over and over, so his entertainment value is low.</br>  <br>Is this the guy from brazil or why is more high then a drunken monkey writing on the keyboard?</br>  <br> ... <br>So computer simulations are all retarded too, right?</br></br>  <br>I also suspect this might be the case. She's just a youth who confused admiration and love, just like many adolescent.</br>  <br>She's probably a 4.5 on the kinsey scale.</br>  read before asking questions buyfag.moe  <br>The fuck? Fucking Mandarake.</br>  <br>That's not bad considering it is limited with 2 bodies.</br>  <br>But nothing beats that new figure texture.</br>  <br>Is it like the smell of a newly opened game case?</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br>  Why is DMJii so cute? Will they have an awesome fight next episode?  <br> Hibiki as the villain <br>My heart couldn't take it, please no</br></br>  <br>I'm not quite there yet, but given some proper character development (and usefulness) I think Maria might end up becoming my favourite this season.</br>  <br> internal conflict within the trio again <br>Oh boy.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't know that Symphogear is already a Mahou Shoujo. <br>You know that Nanoha is also a Mahou Shoujo, right?</br></br>  <br>I think they're a little bit closer to mecha musume than to straight mahou shoujo</br>   Precure Thread   <br>In dungeons.</br>  <br>Woah, I've never thought that cures would use dirty tricks like that.</br>  <br>FILTH!<br>Do not degenerate the pure Precures into your weird fantasies!</br></br>  I love Mana.  <br>I don't mind girls with boys as long as they are happy.<br>Still, I will take a group of cute girls over ugly boys any day as long as I live.<br>But I suppose you are faggot that doesn't like girls.</br></br></br>  The To Love Ru Darkness Chapter 57 is out  Which To Love-ru deserves the Mugi-in-LA treatment?  <br>Yui</br>  <br>I want to say it's coincidence.<br><br>Yet at the same time, could you really put it past Yabuki?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I heard TLRD moved to another magazine so author had to tone down a lot the ecchi stuff, I mean, holy crap, even the Bangaihen is censored, this is not the TLRD that we love, I am disappointed</br></br></br></br>  <br>He just did an extra chapter for WSJ,you guys need to stop being faggots, the art is the same as always,just with less nipples.</br>  sakura thread  <br>It's turned into a pet name by that point.</br>  <br>She calls him Emiya-kun when he's messing with him and Shirou when she's in dere mode.</br>  <br>Goddamn.... Why is Sakura-chan so sexual?</br>  390 / 109 / 77  <br>because she's a woman, unlike rin or saber that stay as one-trait girls</br>  So lets be honest here.<br><br>I literally have no idea whats going on in the manga anymore.<br><br>What the fuck is happening right now?<br>Can anyone fill me in?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no fucking way she's going to survive. She's got like 50 death flags and is currently in snack form.</br>  <br>Best character eating the most boring character? My nigga.</br>  <br>I think Annie will die first, then Reiner trying to protect Bertholdt and finally Bert would die maybe saving Eren's group as revenge.</br>  <br>I think he'll die saving Annie since resolution about BA is inevitable.</br>  <br>Annie is going to get eaten in front of Boot and then he's going to kick down the walls and wake up the titans in his rage.</br>  Yaoi is not angry  <br>I always se this thumbnail as rj with huge knockers</br>  <br>Because as we all know, the LNs are canon.</br>  <br>Wow, she looks lovely in ponytail</br>  <br>The Zuihou LN is a harem with Zuihou as main heroine so yes it's canon.</br>  Why do people hate the anime? The source material has no plot so it's not like they can butcher it.  Why is Binami such a sorry shit who idolized the worst mother fucker in the universe.  <br>Zoro's in the same group as Luffy. Dude doesn't give two shits if it's not Alcohol or a sword.</br>  <br> Robin flicking Koalas bean, who begs her "Onee-sama" </br>  <br>I can see her fuck girls with her playful nature, but I think she only falls in love with dudes.<br><br>I don't think he's interested in romance, but he does experience sexual attraction.</br></br></br>  Why was this the only competent villain after Doffy in this arc?  Who runs faster, Nami or Robin?

If so, I guess Takumi is the pitcher here. Catcher is obviously Mimasaka, which is funny cause the pitcher and catcher need to have great chemistry together. But who is everyone else? Hazarding some guesses...<br><br>Infielders: 1B Hayama, 2B Erina, SS Ryou, 3B Alice<br>Outfielders: RF Megumi, CF Souma, LF Hishoko<br><br>As for the batting order, I would guess that Hayama is the lead-off hitter, followed by Takumi, Souma, and Ryou in the cleanup.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what there are different types of gloves? how can you tell them apart, they all look the same to me.</br>  <br>FUCK YOU JUMP.
