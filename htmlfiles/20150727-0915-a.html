[  No Overlord thread <br>Shame on you, /a/!</br>  <br> discussing the latest vrmmo multi media project </br>  <br> Overlord <br> VRMMO <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Overlord does not need to have thread everyday</br>  <br>We don't have to have a thread up 24/7 when there's nothing new to talk about.</br>  Just finished vol 4 , shits went better than I expected  Sebas dun goofed. Now to wait a week to see how papa bones bails him out.  <br>By burning the 8 fingers down, you don't try to extort Nazarick and get away with it.</br>  <br>Hopefully the 2 goons join Demi's kebab chimera farm. Getting fast way out by Sebas' hand is too good for them.</br>  Looking forward to Mare's rape train and Entoma encounter. Literally everyone in this arc is my favourite characters.  <br> volume 9 TL will never finish this year </br>   tfw you will never be a part of Papa Bones army   <br> Get double release on Saturday <br> Vol 5 ends as Sebas is about to lay the smackdown on 8 candy fingered asses aka cliff hanger <br> Vol 7 ends while mentioning hot shots but stops right before The Darkness shows up <br><br>I'm not sure whether to feel impatient, or savoring how fun next week looks.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it Tuesday yet?<br>Is it Saturday yet?</br>  <br>Check the bottom right corner of your screen.</br>  <br>??</br>  <br>Post that ni shibullath thingie one, I want to see it again.</br>  <br>Alternatively, you can check the day in the top line of every post.</br>      <br>Well its not particularly good and there's nothing new to discuss.</br>  <br>He should quit his overlording career and become a model.</br>  <br>Shalltear should have Papa Bones child.</br>  Best girl.  Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit.  <br> Papa Bones <br> hero <br><br>I wish<br><br><br>Poor Arche ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does he have a conception spell?</br>  <br>I don't know m8, killing enemies in battlefield is pretty normal, regardless whether the method is edgy or not.</br>   Think the lizard romance last volume was cute as fuck. <br> Sebas completely blows that away this chapter. <br>Damn Sebas, why you gotta be so suave, let the lizards have something.</br></br>  Will we get to see the papa bones vs shalltear fight animated?  Been out of the loop. Anyone mind explaining where this tidal wave of MMORPG-themed anime came from?<br><br>I recall .hack from way back so the concept isn't new, what made it so popular now?</br></br>  <br>Digimon</br>  <br>MMORPG theme is so old and busted.<br>Resurrection theme is the new freshness.</br></br>  <br>Well, he plans the eradication of a sentient species just to make slightly stronger skellies.</br>  <br>This right here. MMO anime has old source material, soon they've gotta animate something new, and it's all about resurrection nowadays.</br>  <br>Monster Farm</br>  <br>I would most likely say, yes.<br>Because from the previews of Episode 4, it will finish with Volume 1 and dragging Volume 2 over 9 Episodes, would be too long.<br>I would say Episode 5 - 8 will be covering Volume two's 4 Chapters, and Episode 9 - 13 will cover Volume three's 5 Chapters.<br>Everything would be fitting perfectly and ending with a Epic Fight and Ending.</br></br></br></br>  post OC  <br>Nice,here's hoping for a second season.</br>  <br>He's a wizard.</br>  <br><br>Yes we do. Anyone who says otherwise is obvious lower lifeforms (slugs) and should be killed.</br></br>  <br>Because MMOs are dead and we watch the series that use them as a theme trying to relive our best times in games like EQ and WoW</br>  <br>Read the stats.<br><br>Alignment: Extreme Evil<br>Sense of Justice: -500<br><br>Ep 2 the only reason he helped was to see how his powers did against the new world and cause he felt he had a debt to repay to Touch Me. And he wanted info. In other words, he didnt help cause he cares about those humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good God, Ainz. That's just overkill.</br>  So I read Book 1 to 4 and the spoiler for the rest to 9, and I am concerned: MC and his army are way overpowered. I have yet to find anyone who managed to be a threat to them.<br><br>Sure, it's fun to follow a badass' journey, especially when he doesn't act exactly like a Gary Stu, but some credible danger would be nice too.<br><br>Hell, form what spoiler I read, book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level.</br></br></br></br>  PVs again in case you missed them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2kv<wbr>DO3xJFEY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU5<wbr>xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Tuesday when? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, I'm guessing the guy's sane and not overly evil but since he actually has become a lich not only has his emotions being suppressed but he's even matching game stats.<br><br>Though personally if I was extremely evil I wouldn't of left the 2 girls with a protective bubble and drag them along the ground kicking and screaming before dissecting them infront of the village, he could of atomized the village in an instant and saved the chief to force info out of him.<br><br>I know he's smart but that level of evil and to actually help out so much over a PERSONAL debt which he could easily ignore...I got a feeling he isn't sticking strictly to those stats, but I haven't read the manga and not sure if he starts matching stat for stat yet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a  guild  and potential  WC items .</br>  <br>Would be nice to see him unlease the beast   Rubedo [/spoiler[ </br>  <br>Nigga, he's not the type of evil that goes around starting shit (except with the Lizardmen) or flaunting his power unprovoked. I personally believe he's one of the scary type of evil, the smart kind. He's pragmatic as fuck but not above letting any emotion he can feel sway him to the other side. He isn't as evil as he would have been if he'd been, say, born a lich with his stats but he's growing into his alignment pretty nicely.</br>  <br>So without knowing how strong kingdoms are in this world, you would have comitted pointless slaughter with no real benefit. <br>. There's evil, and there's stupidity. Nigga, you dumb</br></br>  <br>After Monday.</br>  <br>I'm playing FFXIV and it's more like the MMO's depicted in these recent anime than anything else.</br>  <br>Is it supposed to be loyal? It looks like it'd bite the hand feeding it.</br>  <br>Indeed, the alignment system in D&amp;D doesn't cover everything for a reason, when Stupid Evil, Stupid Good, Lawful Stupid, Stupid Neutral and Chaotic Stupid most certainly exist.</br>  <br>I thought that's what Int and Wis are for? It's not surprising quite a few people on this board have like -5 on their modifiers.</br>  <br>I suppose stupid being relegated to an INT score makes sense, but even players with proper INT scores still play Stupid all the time. Especially Chaotic Stupid.</br>  <br>I doubt anything in new world could be a threat to Nazarick.<br>Heck an army consist of 1500 demi-god levels 100 and they still coudn't past 8th floor.</br></br>  <br>It was perfectly possible to get through Nazarick with a dedicated team. They just gave up at lvl 8 because of the gotcha and didnt bother to try again.</br>  <br>Weren't most of those NPC mercenaries?<br>Plus all the 41 members were there.</br></br>  <br>Ainz is scared of other players who may or may not show up and we have those Dragon Lords and unknown world items around. Tension is generated because we don't know yet. Overlord has a ways to go and I'm sure there will be dangers that sort of threaten Nazarick...maybe, possibly. But just reading how they crush the lowly humans and enslave the other races is fun in its own way.</br>   Anime too dragged out <br> No spooky orchestra music playing on background when SPOOKY SKELETON on stage <br>Why the fuck is anyone even watching this</br></br>  <br>In the novels, he does experiments on humans. Not sure if they will show that in the anime. But human experimentations are definitely EVIL.</br>  <br>That's just playing out of character, or possibly in line with their background text and such. You can't measure everything with numbers even in DnD after all.</br>  <br>Which NPC ?<br>They can't even touch 1 member since they failed at 8th floors</br></br>  <br>Because It's entertaining and I'm autistic enough to enjoy infodumps?</br>  <br>A lot of those were NPCs and they got trolled by Victim who inflicted all the status effects in the game then Ainz nuked them with a World item.</br>  <br>I remember reading that the 1500 strong army was composed mostly of NPC mercenaries.</br>  <br>From a human perspective. From a Nazarick / Undead Overlord perspective? Not really. He's not even biologically capable of feeling it. <br><br>It'd be like asking a guy who had his nuts and pecker chopped off to stay virile for the rest of his life and he gets to live for the next 300 years after becoming a eunuch.<br><br>It's not like he doesn't realize it's bad by human standards, he just can't afford to care at this point when he's prioritizing safety and his body helps a fuck ton.<br><br>Whereas in a human body he'd be sweating bullets and guilt tripping himself so hard he'd never let it go through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Rubedo ?<br>I thought she's the reason for their failure.</br></br>  Gamma the best.  <br> and the spoiler for the rest to 9, <br>Where?</br></br>  <br> experiments <br> On humans <br><br>I eagerly await this, I know his emotions have been suppressed and this just suits that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just like lizard sex</br>  “Climb. Even if you desire power, don’t give up your humanity.”<br><br>“Give up on my humanity…? Are you speaking of the likes of demons that appear in stories?”<br><br>“That and others like turning into an undead or magic life forms.”<br><br>“A normal human cannot do something like that.”<br><br>“That’s true… but turning into an undead will often twist your heart as well. Desiring perfection, becoming an undead to achieve one’s ideal… the heart will be tempted by the changing flesh and the resulting transformation will be terrifying.”<br>Nooo Ainz stay good!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also an animefag. <br><br>He monologues pretty heavily about how his current form is desensitizing him to just about anything that would make him flinch as a human being. <br>Pretty hard to miss the potential for his committing atrocities as he becomes increasingly more absorbed into this form/role of his.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Why would you think that? Nothing about her was mentioned during the description of the raid.</br>  <br>The formula is that the MC is overpowered but he plans meticulously and fully expects more resistance but he ends up winning much easier than he expects. It's been repeated since vol 1. Even in vol 7 when Demiurge reveals to Ainz that everyone was planning on world domination he just freaks out for a second then just goes with it. There's a part in vol 4. where he's talking with the Guardians and they are like 'well why don't we just do things more obviously instead of skulking around because then we can reveal the enemies faster' and he shits his robe.<br><br>They can't possibly bring out all the details from the LN or WN. There are far too many one sentence things like Ainz's despair aura or the spooky faces coming from the staff of ainz ool gown that never get mentioned again.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Rubedo probably had a part in it, though how much is another question altogether.<br><br>Every single guardian even PA was not allowed on the 8th floor. It takes someone of Victim level to stay on that floor, so Rubedo had to be something special like  oh I don't know made from the Caloric Stone making her a world class npc and living up to her name? </br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Rubedo isn't mentioned to have done anything yet. I'm not even sure Ainz visited the 8th floor yet at all, since he told everyone to stay out of there. Apparently the strongest are on that floor, even though they aren't lvl100. This doesn't include Victim who came out during vol 4 to float around for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere she's guards the 8th floor with Victim and Gargantua. Heck a guy said that she even stronger than Touch Me.</br>  Since Lupusregina is the faith-based caster of the Pleiades, I wonder if her name is a reference to the Bitch Queen, an evil god in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D setting.  <br>Rubedo being the Miko would mean she is level 100. Unless Miko is another NPC by process of elimination it would make her Rubedo, because Lastborn cannot be the same level as Sebas as written earlier.</br>  <br>I wonder what world class items albedo has. I recently read vol 1 of the LN and apparently she has two but they haven't mentioned them. Isn't she World class npc then?</br>    <br>Gargantua guards the 4th floor.<br> Rubedo is rumored to be the cherry blossoms Guardian in the 8th floor, Victim is the 8th floor Guardian.<br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's on the 8the floor. And the narration did say something vague like "the raid was halted on the 8th floor" and not "Victim stopped the raid on the 8th floor." So I guess it's possible she did something if anyone made it to her lair after Victim went off.</br>  <br>No, it's fundamentally a bit different. Ainz for example has a WC item. However Touch Me is a world class champion even if he doesn't hold a WC item.<br><br>Get the difference? While a WC item certainly puts you on the same level, if not higher depending on the item, your fundamental base isn't changed.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me. <br>Maybe Ulbert? Possibly.</br></br>    <br>By tidal wave you mean a splash n the kiddie pool? You can't name more than 5 anime franchises in the last 10 years that have MMORPG in any significant value.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have strongest magic caster class.<br>But he's not world class chamion.</br></br>   Pdf/epub link please. On mobile atm, can't do shit. ;_;   <br><br>can anyone add in ni shibullath in onto the background?</br></br>  <br>Lupus just means wolf son, theres a lot of wolf queens in fiction.<br><br>I figured.<br><br>see <br>was what I read in the novels<br>Rubedo has done nothing, we just barely know it exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>Ulbert was the magic equivalent of the world champion. This is because the world champion is pure physical and it'd be unfair to casters.<br><br>Ulbert however was always depicted as playing 2nd fiddle, and Touch Me being the gary stu with his ballin' wife and children being a level 100 raijuu.</br></br></br>  <br>It might just be a repeat of the ainz vs shalltear fight with Shalltear winning because Touch Me isn't an npc. <br><br>The goblin with the wc stick would kill him though and all of the tomb.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>What's this shit I hear about Touch Me and Ulbert getting into it in real life and why it's most likely the reason they quit the guild?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Many of the 'transported to another world' and "mmorpg is real" have been around for a long time and many are popular. SAO is the latest biggest one for anime, the LN is high ranked as well. Mushoku Tensei is another resurrection type that is the top LN now. But you can go as far back as Zero no Tsukihime or whatever. Overlord is pretty old as is, it took a long time to come from WN-&gt;LN-&gt;anime.</br>    If our youngest was here… if we moved as Pleiades then we wouldn’t have a problem…  <br>So according to Solution, the youngest sister of Pleiades might be in 8th floor too ?<br>Damn, there are just so many secrets about the it.</br></br>  <br>We don't know what Rubedo does. All we know is that currently in the new world Rubedo is the strongest being in Nazarick, cause ya know the other 40 players aren't here and Ainz has one damn gimp shit build that would be low-mid tier max without his decked out items.<br><br>I mean it's a game where the average player at level 100 had 1 divine item max. Max. Most none at all. <br><br>If put into WoW terms, it'd be like vanilla level 60 in blues with one purple from a dungeon versus full t3 with legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rubedo's the youngest.</br>  <br>Why I can't touch all of those Albedos.</br>  <br>Ainz didn't actually use any of his skills to win that, just spamming items. You could say that its just a matter of whoever abuses more World Class items at this point and which effect wins harder.<br>Don't forget all the Divine/Mythic class items that fuck people over too. Gazef without his stamina gloves is pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama does keep a lot of potential asspullery handy. Half-done character sheets, mysterious super NPCs in reserve. No ability descriptions for Nazarick's world class items.</br>  <br>She's taking about Lastborn.</br>  <br>Don't forget about Albedo's younger sister.</br>  <br>maybe the miko<br>or rubedo is the miko<br>or Albedo's sister is the miko<br>or albedo's sister is rubedo and she's just hiding in the frozen prison for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br>  Since Gate is going to get localized, I can only hope Overlord does too later down the line.  <br>This is the kind of story I like. I like my OP MC story with a little substance but not too much that it would overpower my hankering for a good beatdown.</br>  <br>If they're lovecraftian horrors they should be enemies to good and evil alike. Not that "summon them and bail" isn't a suitable strategy for an evil person.<br><br><br>A space marine chapter would probably be on even footing with everything but floor guardians and Ainz himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so you'd have to wonder what makes her special enough to reside on the 8th floor when she's not even level 100.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, forgot about her. Damn, the 8th floor's pretty balling.<br>Victim<br>Rubedo<br>Lastborn<br>What else?<br><br>Which floor sucks, geographywise? My vote goes to Chair's graveyard. Compared to the others, it's a bit not impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't even list out the classes. Since max level is 15 for any class it would have to take up a huge amount of space but of course that allowed him to give Ainz the Eclipse class. <br>I think its a good choice though, because most of the tension in the story is based around how things are going to play out or what new secret move is going to get shown next and we already get enough infodumps as it is.</br></br>  <br>There no information about her so we can't be sure she's a low level NPC like here sisters.</br>  <br><br>The Tundra must be fucking awful if you don't have frost resistance.</br></br>  <br>We can because in the early volumes like vol 1 or 2 it's said other than Sebas the rest of the maids were below a certain level. The second point is the poster of the level 100 npcs, of which there are 9 including the miko.</br>  <br>Not to mention you have to jump into a lake to get to it</br>  <br>I was bored.</br>  <br>Ok, then she must have some special shit like Victim to stay in the 8th floor.<br>Damn, the more we talk the less chance I see PDL could be a threat to Nazarick.</br></br>  <br>This works quite well</br>  <br> fighting cocytus <br>oh god all of them swords<br>I bet his cleave must have been a bitch<br> fighting demiurge in the molten realm <br>I can only imagine him mind controlling people into lava pits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're forgetting that PDL's main skill is subterfuge and trickery and that Ainz is shit at that. Demiurge will probably have to step up his game in order to prevent PDL empowering Penguin to enslave pandora's actors and stealing all the world items and class changing Ainz to a toad or some shit.</br>  <br> Ourobouros is in the new world and is probably the most game breaking in terms of long term <br> World Savior can one shot all of Nazarick <br> Nameless Spellbook allows PDL to know all of Nazarick's spells <br> Potential players that hate AOG <br><br>PDL himself was never a big deal, it's how he goes Hitogami on Ainz's ass that's the set up. <br><br>Plus, the author stated Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 70% of her faces show nothing but anger. <br><br>Come on Narb, those humans aren't that bad, calm down.</br></br></br>   “And those glasses… didn’t they seem incredibly expensive?” <br><br> “Could it be a magic item?” <br><br> “No, isn’t it just a luxury item? Maybe a dwarf made it.” <br><br>Fucking dwarves, man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's something briefly touched on in vol 7. It didn't go into specifics though.</br>  <br>CD is a chump though. As cute as she is.</br>  <br>Except for the Nameless Spellbook, does PDL even has the others 2 ?</br>  He looks pretty fucking good.  <br> All these pests around me, I want to squash them all. </br>  <br>Who is Certain Death ?</br>  <br>I still don't know what fucking race he is</br>  <br>Orobourus has already been used, its not coming back.<br><br>World Savior should still be in the hands of the goblins because no one is out powering them.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolielf that we see hanging around with the Black Scripture guy, so she's Sloan Theocracies bitch. Apparently part of the Black Scripture but not the leader.</br>  <br> it turns out that one of the goblins under Erin has it and she decides to not use it against Ainz because he saved the village <br>That would be a nice tweest.<br> she doesn't know that Ainz could have revived her parents </br></br></br>  <br>Garuda maybe?</br>  <br>There's noting stating a WC item that was used up in the new world returns to Yggdrasil instead of coming back to the new world.<br><br>In fact, assuming Martial Arts was introduced through Orobourus then that's twice it's been used since translation konjac is clearly one use.<br><br>World Savior was already used by the goblin king so it shouldn't be with the goblins since it's a twenty, so even if it's in the new world it's somewhere random. It'd be super dumb luck for goblins to find it twice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The winged god of Ra</br>  <br>confirmed high crit rate</br>  <br>She's beautiful.</br>  <br>What is Ouroboros's power ?<br>Is it alter-reality or some shit like that &gt;</br></br>  <br>Yep. It's the broken shit where you call the admin team and ask them to do something. By far the most potential over the long term if we're talking about items we know about.<br><br>And we know from how Wish Upon a Star changed that Ouroboros would be even more godly in the new world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There was a post about who was stronger between rubedo and touch me like 2 threads ago. Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz.</br></br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me <br><br>Missed it, source on the author word of god link.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't ouroboros one use though? I think the LN mentioned it being used in order to help that guild steal Ainz's secret jew gold mine. I remember that Ainz has at least two one-shot World items, but I don't know what you're implying with Wish Upon A Star.</br>  <br>How did Wish Upon a Star get changed in the nw?</br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz. <br>As in, it's a direct comparison? Rubedo is stronger because her skills have good compatibility with Touch Me as an opponent?</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128551<wbr>803/#q128565734</wbr></br>  <br>There nothing stating that orobouros was used for those two things. Another option is that orobouros isn't even in the new world. <br><br>I'm just believing in the fact that the twenty really are just one use items, that does not respawn. So the guild that used it on the mines was the only time.</br></br></br>  <br>One use means it disappears and comes back in the world of Yggdrasil as far as the game goes.<br><br>However, since the item transferred to the new world, chances are after it's used it comes back to the new world. Not proven fact but the way the novels keep hinting at shit and Ainz's paranoia at WC items it'd be more of a buzz kill if it doesn't work this way.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but author just said she's stronger than Touch Me.<br>There's no comparison mention.</br></br>  <br>nah the twenty and one-use world items aren't the same thing<br><br> Answer: The amount of EXP needed from Wish upon a star is dependent on the type of wish granted. In Yggdrasil a player who cast Wish upon a star would be granted 3 random choices from a pool of choices; However, In the New world the spell is a lot more Omnipotent. But basically the larger and stronger the wish, the more EXP given to complete it <br>https://forums.animesuki.com/showth<wbr>read.php?p=5599818<br><br><br>I don't know where you got that idea about the one use items but I'll assume you're right</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Martial Arts is 50/50 but Translation Konjac is clearly hinted.<br><br>Every fucking species in the world right down to the very last descendent's ancestor somehow managed to eat a konjac? You telling me someone went Santa Claus and spread some language jelly during Christmas for a few years in a row and even went in the sea cause sea races can't be bothered to surface?<br><br>Yeah no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the game it gets one of three random wishes to choose from every use.<br>In the new world if you can think it, it will grant it (unless it's going up against a WC item)</br></br>  <br>so what you're saying is<br> Herohero was summoned to spread jelly to the mouth of every being on the planet. <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok<br>So Ouroboros can works on even a larger scale than that ? That's some OP shit.</br></br>  <br>Possibly, but I'm pretty sure he's still busy trying to free Veldora out from the prison. Maybe it was Simmering Teapot instead. She's an eroge voice actor surely making her the best candidate to go Ho Ho Ho.</br>  <br> twenty and one use items not.the same thing <br> These items called the ‘Twenty’ were so powerful that they could only be used once before disappearing. <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was Teapot's race?</br>  <br>Slime.</br>  There are our twenties that can change the world. We're both arguing about something that may or may not have happened.  <br><br>No wonder he was away from Yggdrasil for so long then showed up overworked. He was making Christmas runs the whole time behind Momonga's back! He didn't quit the game he just logged onto the PTR fucking around.</br></br>  My lord please tell me all the Climb screentime gets toned down in the next chapter.<br>I can't fucking handle the guy. At least Zaryusu was a god damn reptile.</br>  <br>But won't you enjoy how he and Brain get mind fucked by how strong his dandy gentleman effortlessly makes them shit their pants harder than Gazef ever could?<br><br>Especially Brain, he's gotta be going crazy.<br><br> Get whooped by Gazef <br> Think effort is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Shalltear <br> Thinks race is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Sebas <br> Just goes with the flow and thinks it's all about MUH MAMORU </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh of course I will but holy shit these last few chapters.<br><br>Also, I liked Brain far more than Climb.</br></br></br>    He thought it was Ainz Ooal Gown for an instance, but it lacked depth and the presence. <br>“Is that… a hug pillow of him… who made it?”<br>“I made it myself<br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Climb is basically the kid you are meant to hate or pity or root for, and then a few volumes down the line he  gets Gazef'd, probably by the lizards or Hamsuke. </br>  <br>yes really</br>  <br>Damn, wish I had a waifu like that.</br>  <br>No one can outGazef Gazef.  RIP in pieces hero ;_; </br>  <br>She'd be the perfect housewife if she wasn't a lunatic.</br>  <br>50% Anger at humans<br>40% Confusion at why Ainz is disappointed <br>10% Abject Apathy</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing to hate about him. He's just a loyal warrior who is above average that happens to be messing around with the best humanity has to offer. He's a foil for everyone that Ainz shits upon.</br>   dat lizardsex on vol.4 <br>I kinda want to see Ainz's facepalm got animated.</br>  <br>You forgot shit at following orders.<br> Call me Momon we need to do this ninja shit <br> okay momon-sama <br> Call me momon <br> okay momon-sa- n <br> fine thats good enough </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hamsuke <br><br>Let it happen. I feel like we're not getting enough of him. I know you're embarrassed to have him around Ainz but you already registered him anyway so bring him out for a walk or genocide or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Plenty of people on /a/ hate Climb, it's enough for me to be considerate to them and include the option. Personally I'm with you, but I can't say I like/dislike him. He's just kinda there.</br>  So we all agree then?<br>Retard moe is a thing.<br>Cause there's no other explanation for best meido-ing this retard.</br></br>  Anyone here read Kuro no Maou? How is it?  Am I the only one who thinks that PA's ability is OP as fuck?<br>I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable.</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for vol 8 translations to see if Hamsuke really is a girl. And I guess the rest of vol 6 to see if Ninya was a girl. Pretty sure the latter is but these threads have been filled with nerd ragers so it's hard to discuss anything related to trap/reverse trap cause it's apparently srs biz.</br>  <br>There's a reason he's best guardian, you know?</br>  <br>Well he is best girl. That's only natural.</br>  <br>Retard-moe has existed before paper existed. It just has so many names across all the languages you can't really tell anymore.</br>  <br>  Imagine he has 80% power of based Touch Me or Ulbert <br>Well damn.</br></br>  <br> I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable. <br>He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. So 80% of their strength from skills/races, but not as strong as they would be when fully decked out.</br></br>  <br>Of course it's a thing.<br><br>Did you forget nearly an entire year of "CHAIKA ON THE FRONT PAGE?" posting.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay. God damn though. All these fucking words about nothing. Yandere fairy is cool though.</br>  <br><br><br>/a/ in charge of having  good taste. </br></br></br>  <br> he shows up <br> albedo kills him <br> Ainz goes "what the fuck' <br> They both realize its pandora actor <br> Ainz rezzes him and give albedo a look with a face that doesn't exist but she can sense his disappointment anyways. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah. that's them having low wisdom scores that would normally tell them this is totally a bad idea.<br>It's like that tale with the various sages/scientists all trying to one up another in showing off the majesty of a dead tiger they found.<br>The first one writes a Haiku<br>The next does a drawing<br>The next does an incredibly lifelike painting<br>The next makes a model<br>The next one uses taxdermy to show off it's majesty<br>Then they all get together and decided to bring it to life as a true way to show off their skills<br>The random commoner hears this and decides to GTFO as they discuss how to do so.<br>The tiger comes to life and eats everyone but the commoner.<br>High int Low wis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. <br> Cash items </br></br>  <br>No, I've seen people play dnd with both high int and wis and still make retard decisions. Cause you can't stop the player behind the character from being dumb.</br>  <br>Racial skill is enough.<br><br>Do you think in future releases, Ainz will allow PA to copy his Eclipse job and going "the goal of all life is death" together?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you really think that no one else knew about that or what?</br>  <br>That's because the player behind the character isn't actually being affected by their character's "high wisdom".</br>  <br>Oh i know. I guess i just felt like pointing out that there can be multiple sources of this.<br> I have a fellow player that I thought was absolutely brilliantly playing a low int character(couldn't be low wis since he liked to mention his high wis) due to the absolutely horrible decision making skills he displayed for months. (Not even on a low scale. Many of the BBEGs are a direct result of his bright ideas.) Then I put my foot in my mouth by mentioning his character had low int and discovered he actually had a positive int modifier.</br></br>  <br>why the fuck everyone keep calling her retard? she just simply hate human and refuse to acknowledge them. That isnt retard, its simply racist</br>  <br>Albedo should ask PA to transform to Ainz and do some kinky shit with him. It's like NTR but isnt actually NTR</br>  <br>The funny thing is he did notice her smell. He just didn't know it was from her.</br>  <br>Be unable to follow simple order is usually a sign that you're not very bright, anon.</br>  <br>nah, I can't help but think of Ainz talking like a nazi in the middle of the act. Talk about a boner killer.</br>  <br>Because he never smell a pussy before</br>  <br>Racism and being a retard usually go hand in hand.</br>  <br>She's also terminally incompetent and takes a while to accept new orders.<br><br>but that's why we love her.</br></br></br>  <br>specist*<br>She doesn't seem to think that copying the image of a human is a big deal either. <br>As for retard she can't follow momon instructions to play the part of a human or even call him by a certain name so thats where it comes from. She also tries to melee down undead dragons while being a caster.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a summon, so it's loyal.</br>  <br> summoned outsiders are loyal <br>No wonder this shit game failed.</br></br>  <br>It's retard in positive way. Retard moe.</br>  <br>Even actual retards don't think racially, many lack the mental capacity to even think in such a way.<br><br>Arrogance stupidity and indoctrination are not to be confused with being a retard, otherwise special schools would be filled with rednecks</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's was born as an Undead. It's just like the liches he creates, they're like normal people.</br>  <br>Except human beings in reality are born and raised. NPCs are ya know literally made the way they are. No different than someone being born blind.</br>  Please fucking tell me Shalltear will be in this episode?  <br>I shalltear your hopes apart.</br>  <br>nope, well, maybe. Episode 5 is more likely.</br>  <br>From the preview, it seems she will appear in the end of episode.</br>  <br>This season will have tons of her near the end, don't worry. Though if theres a second season the best scene with her will happen then.</br>    <br>Someone translated the WN version of Ainz unleashing the Super-tier spell on the Kingdom's army.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx<wbr>6CgOVk4476Uy1PdU10LXh4Rkk/view?pli=<wbr>1</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Just at the end when Ainz gives that baller speech.</br>  <br>nope. Not going to read it till we're there.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the change of flags part.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear.</br>  <br>It has nothing to do with traps/reverse-traps, people generally like Mare and Aura even if it's not a whole lot. It's a feud about wiki/anti-wiki usage, the reliability of information posted here sometimes, and people blindly trusting information without sources.</br>  <br> Double unblockable Wail of Banshees. <br>Sounds like they could beat all the guardians together with that kind of firepower.</br></br>  <br>That was great, I can't wait until we get there.</br>  <br>Brilliant</br>  <br> That there was a player within the Kingdom’s forces <br>nope nope nope I'm gonna wait</br></br>  Is there a picture of albedo in her armor from the LN? Tried googling it and get papa bones or porn.  <br>No, all we know is that it's spiky and you can't tell her gender while she wears it.</br>   His eyes moved from the book and rested on a young woman who was sitting behind the counter, next to the young man. He spoke to her in a gentle voice. <br><br> “Is there a problem?” <br><br> “N-nothing at all…” <br><br> The girl blushed and lowered her face. <br><br> “I just thought… that your posture was quite striking.” <br><br> “Thank you very much.” <br><br> Sebas showed a gentle smile, causing the girl to blush even deeper. <br><br> The gray-haired gentleman Sebas was someone who you would be attracted to simply by looking at him. On top of his graceful countenance, he radiated an elegance that turned the heads of nine out of ten women, regardless of age. It could not be helped that the young woman at the counter would mindlessly stare at Sebas; it was quite common, after all. <br><br>Sebas muh boi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see how Touch Me pulled in his wife.</br>  <br>That was excellent.  I guess this means that Ainz still hasn't formally chosen an ally nation, or that he might be near choosing the Empire? </br>  <br>He probably just sits there and points at his baby old ones if anyone trys to cause shit.</br>   killing vampire loli   <br>  He chose the Empire since Kindom send an idiot envoy and piss him off, would be different if they send Gazef the man  </br>  <br>In about a year?</br>  <br>if that's what it takes</br>  <br>This is the WN, the LN is completely different story-wise.  In the WN, Ainz becomes a noble of the Empire. In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> killing vampires <br><br>You can't kill what is already dead!</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> You'd have to fuck up extremely badly to make Ainz angry enough that he personally comes to slaughter your army. </br>  <br>fucking 10/10</br>  <br><br> It's goes more like this:<br> Empire and Kingdom send their representatives to meet Ainz. <br> Kingdom sends a dick who doesn't understand the power of Nazarick <br> Empire sends the Emperor who praises Ainz and wants to ally him <br> When they are all gone, Demiurge tells everyone that the Emperor probably plans to betray Ainz.  <br> Ainz then decides to ally himself with the Empire,but also show his might to them in case they want to betray him later on.  <br><br><br>In the WN Ainz buys the head-magician of the Empire, gets to a magic school, becomes a noble and the head-magician convinces the Emperor to get on Ainz's good side, just to eventually put Ainz on the lead of the Empire. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>I prefer the LN way of doing this.<br>Nazarick is strong enough to be independent.<br>Administration will be bitch, but I'm sure they can manage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or everyone could just leave the undead lich alone and everything he does will to categorize as a natural disaster</br>  <br>In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. Demiurge and Shaltear divide up her scenes. <br><br>Poor Shaltear, she had Ainz all to herself. It's hard to imagine Overlord now without Albedo though.</br></br></br>  <br>And now Albedo is hogging all the fanartists' attention. Well Akenest is still loyal to waifural.</br>  <br> In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. </br>  <br>That's so strange to think about.<br><br>Having had no contact with the WN, it just seems like you couldn't replace her if you tried.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither does Mare or Victim.</br></br>   Ainz getting embarrassed because he accidentally shows two lizards having sex to Aura and Mare <br><br>My evil overlord can't possibly be this cute</br></br>  <br>Victim sort of half-exists. The author threw around the concept, but never went into details about the 8th floor except that the alliance raid wiped there.</br>  <br> Ainz starts thinking about sex ed to the dark elves </br>  <br> implying Mare isn't a total slut <br><br>Remember that he will try to outbid Albedo for the right to sleep with Ainz.<br><br>Aura is pure and best daughter though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Mare is just....innocent.</br>  <br>He is. The most innocent</br>  <br> Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit. <br><br>his decent into becoming a full blown super evil lich-king is surprisingly swift and subtle. parts of it start from the very beginning at the end of book 1 (we might see it next episode)  when he captured some priests/warriors from the theocracy and had them tortured to death for information <br><br>book 2 continues this decent into amoral evil when he casually starts to order  witnesses killed, and leaves comrades to die <br><br>book 3 expands on it further when he  slaughters a whole guild of adventurers rather then let them witness his fight with Shelltear. <br><br>book 4 gets even more grizzly as  he slaughters/enslaves a whole race of lizardmen just for an experiment and to teach some of the floor guardians how to think outside of the box. Meanwhile Demiurge has built a human "farm" where people are held captive; skinned alive to make magic scrolls, then healed with magic to repeat the process for more magic scrolls. <br/> <br>book 5/6 well he's  setting himself up to be a world power, so you probably can guess where this takes us.  <br><br>at this pace the anime will probably end in book 3, so he'll be fairly evil by the point. the problem is he stops thinking of himself as human. Being a lich robs him of "feelings" and "compassion" and he's so much more powerful then the "humans" he starts to see them as "lesser" lifeforms. <br><br>in the end he still has moments where he has acts of mercy/compassion, but they're always calculated to gain something for the Tomb, or as some sort of obligatory repayment to TouchME</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will there ever be a manly bath scene with Ainz, Demiurge, Cocytus, and Mare?<br><br>While Albedo and Shalltear fight over who gets to peep, so by the time they arrive the only one there is Victim.</br></br></br>  <br>So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right?<br><br>I really want Enri to live on as a loyal servant of her savior Ainz. Especially now that we know the werewolf maido is friends with her.</br></br></br>  <br> There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a guild and potential WC items. <br>psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br>while WC items are deadly and potentially ruinous to papa bones, that's only if they catch him unaware. if he sees it coming they have zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, after they are attacked by goblins and trolls.</br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br><br>He has 12, and the Guild Weapon never comes out. It is said to rival with a WC item, but it would be one of the weak-ones, not the strong 20.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank our lord and savior Papa Bones!</br>  <br> the werewolf maido is friends with her. <br>I'm not so sure about that.</br></br>  <br> Warlord  Enri  the Bloody  is considered a subject of Ainz and Nazarick. <br><br> Since the Kingdom decided to attack Carne (which I highly doubt would qualify as a village anymore), Ainz enters the Kingdom-Empire War on the Empire's side. <br><br> Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army that is supposedly professionally superior to either the Kingdom and the Empire's military. <br><br> &gt;Her army of 5000 goblins includes goblin Hoplites as core troops, goblin beast riders,17 goblin paladin on white wolf, goblin longbows, goblin magic support squad, goblin magic artillery squad, goblin medic squad, goblin musician squad, goblin assasination squad, 13 lvl43 goblin red cap honour guards and a goblin tactician dress as Zhuge Liang. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right? <br>its inside the sphere of influence, yes. and unless I've completely forgotten, I'm pretty sure they trade with the tomb. However i don't think Papa bones ever considered them important enough to make them part of his growing kingdom. its such a minor place with nothing of importance i doubt it even occurred to him.</br></br>  <br>   gobbo Zhuge Liang <br> I know what I'm using my next session. </br></br>  <br>  "Warlord Enri &amp; Her Green Horde Going Genghis Khan On Empire/Kingdom's Ass"  -spinoff when?</br>  <br> 13 lv 43 goblin red cap honor guards <br><br>these goblins are stronger than what, 99% of the humans in the new world?</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army <br><br>How?  Ainz gave her only 2 horsn and each can summon only ~20 goblins (or so). </br></br></br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br>No, you're thinking of The Twenty, a collective designation for the 20 consumable world-class items. AOG only had 11 WC items: two on the 8th floor, one on Papa Bones' person, one on Albedo, one in the Throne, four in the Treasury, and two unaccounted for. It's unclear if the Caloric Stone (which was used) and Atlas (which was stolen) are counted.</br></br>  <br>I think she also essentially gets the local goblin tribes and ogres to pledge loyalty to her by Volume 8. <br><br>So her goblins have "civilian" support as well as a source of recruits.</br></br></br>  <br>The item  depends on class levels, which Enri gained by leading the original 12 .</br>  <br>They probably don't despawn anymore.</br>  <br> She uses it after obtaining the Commander/General class. </br>  <br> single girl commanding army that can wipe out anything in 1000 km radius (except Nazarick of course). </br>  Can someone spoil me Tsuare's reaction to Nazarik?  <br> It's a special effect of using the Horn alongside her levels in Commander/General. I believe the effect is that it summons a goblin army in proportion to the number of opponents, which in this case, was a army of 5,000 Kingdom troops. Back in the game, the effect wasn't that overpowered, considering that players rarely gathered in such numbers and goblins were weak relative to other NPC summons. Here' as with other items from Nazarick, it's overpowering. </br>  <br>Well might as well go  raiding/nomad  style since feeding those troops is going be quite hard.</br>   hey lets give this completely innocent girl some useless summon items <br> she turns into second strongest power in the region within a year <br>Oh, wow.</br></br>  Now, what I wonder about the goblins is what will happen to them in the long run.<br><br>Supposedly they despawn the next time she blows the horn and what comes out is another goblin troupe appropriate for the threat at the time.<br><br>But what if she never blows the horn again for the rest of her life? What if they set up villages and breed and for hundreds of years goblins slowly expand and form a kingdom of their own with a separate culture and a different way of life.<br><br>What'll happen then to the descendants of the original 5,000 if after all that time someone blows the horn again when faced by two thugs in some street alley? Will the entire thing just poof away and call forth two level 10 goblins? <br><br>I'm probably overthinking this, but the idea of having your entire existence hinge on someone literally blowing hot air is a bit terrifying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The horn is single-use (Enri has/uses two of them), they disappear after use; the goblins are permanent.</br>  <br>The horns are consumables, she has nothing else to blow but goblin comfort men.</br>  <br>they both will, the question is which one will be the rightful heir</br>  I can't wait for a situation like what the 13 Heroes had to deal with to come around again. Isn't the Theocracy preparing for some doomsday event in the future? How likely is it that Ainz is going to have to step in? That event would probably only affect humans, wouldn't it? Momon might have to do something but would Magic King Ainz be tempted to help out?  <br>I suppose they aren't as ugly as most fantasy goblins. They're built like green dwarfs too</br>  <br>Cool looking party, would adventure with</br>  <br>I wanna hang out with them.</br>  So I'm understanding that shit is going to get dark in this series real fast then<br><br>Animeonly fag, how fucked up are things going to get?</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  More spoilers from Volume 9.<br><br> &gt;1.

He already uses human skin for magic scrolls and then heals his victims to harvest again later, he could make a nice cushy bone recliner with regenerating flesh-cushions.</br></br>  <br>Oh god hopefully Demiurge never learns vicissitude.</br>  <br> only 30 usd <br>Order arleady placed<br>Awaiting shipment</br></br></br>  <br>Vicissitude is the poor man's protean. Bone shit doesn't even cause aggravated damage.</br>  <br>But you can't put dicks on your knees with protean, anon!</br>  <br>You have a very practical mind, anon.</br>  <br>My main worry is that he'd start flesh crafting a new chair out of flesh that starts screaming when you sit on it.</br>  <br>He doesn't need to, Shalltear is close enough.</br>  Pandora's Actor hype  <br>When does he get proper screen time in the LN?</br>  <br>Shortly before Shalltear fight in volume 3 iirc.</br>  <br>Volume 3, so we'll see him in the anime by season's end.</br>  <br><br>Well I meant after that, I'm already at volume 5 and he hasn't even made an appearance.</br></br>  <br>Soon. <br><br> This Ainz is PA. Also, he is present in vol. 7.  </br></br></br>  <br>I'm more excited for that Albedo and Ainz scene.</br>  <br>Yeah, the Mausoleum was a good part.</br>  I wonder why there's a 300 year difference between the arrival of the 8 Greed Kings[/spoiler] and the  2  of the  13 Heroes  and a 200 year difference between the  2 Heroes  and  Ainz.   <br>Where he talks about the statues and stuff? I was slightly sad when he said why he put them there.</br>  <br>Just realized that Demiurge is carrying Victim like a baby.</br>  <br>I think you did something wrong anon</br>  <br>There had probably been other players around. <br>Also, 600 years there were the 6 Gods.</br></br>  <br>Are these scans filtered somehow because they always seem so blurry</br>   Aura and Ainz riding Hamsuke together <br>2cute2handle</br>  <br>Volume 6 or so when he's pretending to be Ainz while Ainz off being Momon.</br>  will nazarick be conquered just like all the players that tried to take over the world in the end?  <br>Supposedly players showed up every 100 years. It's just that the degree of involvement varies according to the resources that they had.  The 8 Greed Kings transferred with their guild castle, as Ainz did with Nazarick. Others are more isolated, only impact certain localities and are easily contained and dealt with by PDL. </br>  <br>well at least he has something to do now. Was kind of sad that he was stuck in the treasury room with nothing to really do.</br>  <br>Yeah. Fuck phones.</br>  <br>Does PDL know of the one supposedly lying low in the Holy Kingdom or something?</br>  <br>Some had descendant? Guess the really was no way back if they stayed there long enough to have kids and shit.</br>  <br>Wait is there a player there? I thought so far only Ainz was known.</br>  <br>Apparently in the WN. Don't know about the LN yet?</br>  <br>It's not that they had descendants. I mean that players from the MMO show up in the New World at 100 year intervals.  Some of them live long enough to have descendants, but most of the time those children are far weaker than the players that show up. </br>  <br>I thought Ainz said there wasn't one. When he was fighting the Kingdom didn't he say no player was present considering they hadn't attacked him while he was casting his huge spell?</br>  <br> Lying low <br> Show up to attack a Lich <br><br>I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's intelligence net is restricted to the Kingdom and the Empire. He's relatively clueless of anything that happens outside, and he prohibits his servants from journeying too far from Nazarick and support.</br>  <br> Make massive plans in case there's another PC. <br> There isn't <br> "Fuck it, let's just fuck shit up!" <br>Ainz's paranoia is kind of adorable.</br></br></br></br>  How is Ainz planning on boning Shalltear if he's got no boner? Shit makes no sense.  <br>He was already casting the spell, might as well let it go off.</br>  LN is light novel... what the fuck is WN?  <br>web</br>  <br>Weeb novel</br>  <br>Web Novel I believe.</br>  <br> Spider's home  novel</br>  <br>He considers all the NPCs his adoptive children. He isn't going to bone any of them.</br>  <br>Western Novel</br>  <br>Well he's going to have to one day. I want preggers Albedo, and I want to see mini liches and succubae running around.</br>  <br>Web Novel. It's how a lot of series get started nowadays. They publish online because it is free, they become popular, and attracts a publisher's attention to turn it into a LN. It saves money for the publisher, because they don't need predict whether or not a new series would be popular.</br>  <br>Well apparently Albeido is going to rape him at some point so you'll get your wish.</br>  <br>nah, she just get's put in timeout for that</br>    <br> He isn't going to bone any of them. <br>Not with that attitude he won't.</br></br>  <br> I want preggers Albedo <br>I never knew how much I wanted to see this until now. I'm ready to commission this shit if need be.</br></br>  <br>Where the heck is this from?</br>  <br>That ain't PA. <br>Didn't that scene have Ainz remembering  Touch Me &amp; Ulbert fighting seeing Sebas and Demiurge arguing with each other? PA couldn't possibly know that stuff. </br></br>  <br>the LN</br>  <br>Looks like from volume 8 of the LN.</br>  <br>Volume 8.<br><br> Ainz declares how he loves all of his comrades creations, including and in front of Albedo (with predictable results.) </br></br></br>  <br>I fucking love crazy girls.</br>  So, succumbing to my hype I started reading the LN's. Starting Volume 4 now   (lizardmen) and so far NOTHING HAS FUCKING REALLY HAPPENED. WHAT THE FUCK I HAD SUCH HOPES.    <br>Is this translated? I'm reading the skythewood translations and they're up to 5ish.</br>  <br>You don't want to read about the daily lives or lizardmen? C'mon anon.</br>  <br>Oh boy. Can't wait until the translation's ready for the volume.</br>  <br>There are spoiler summaries up on the wiki, as well as snippets all over the internet.</br>  <br> book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level. <br><br>Bit of a gripe I have with WN/LNs in general, they're ambitious with far-planned endgames and long future arcs (which I love, LH very much included), but they often don't make it there, at least not in a timely manner.<br>I'm not big on MT but can really appreciate how quickly we got the full length of the story, with an actual endpoint.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. We're only up to v5ch3</br>  <br>Author is trying to get you to feel for the lizardman's side.

Yukipasta Yui buns  <br>I want to make this Yuigahama a Yuigamama.</br>  <br>Side bun yukinon is almost as cute as the genuine article.</br>  Maybe Yui should just kill herself and solve 90% of the problems.  <br>That would just be running from the problem and not solve anything.<br>Perhaps you should do it Anon.</br></br>  Imagine Yui and Yukino's feelings when they attend the wedding between 8man and Iroha.<br><br>It's only a matter of time.</br></br>  <br>Why would he take responsibility for Zaimokuza's mistake?</br>  Doesn't matter who ends up with who, I just want this guy to be happy<br><br>Although I prefer Yukino, but she has to grow too. Maybe rejection will facilitate that?</br></br>  What would Yui and Yukino think if they saw 8man playing with Keika? Would they tell Komachi she may have been replaced? Would they get jealous? <br><br>Would they imagine having him care for their own children?</br></br>   no Iroha to look down on me   <br>Not sure how being rejected again will help her grow.<br>Only reason rejection helped HIkki grow was because he was rejected over and over until it didn't even phase him anymore.</br></br>  <br> you will never smell her fluids </br>  <br>Rejection didn't really help him grow though. Just because he was going through some major growing pains before doesn't mean he wasn't still completely stunted by all the rejections.</br>    Couldn't say thanks for the Irohasu thread in time. <br>But yeah, thanks, brothers.<br><br><br><br>Stop it you, I can't do it right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not getting what you want gives people a backbone, there's a reason why spoiled brats exist. Although she doesn't seem like a spoiled brat in terms of physical needs, she isn't well versed in relationships. Might also pass the genuine lesson from Hiratsuka where being in a relationship with someone means you're ready to hurt/get hurt. There's a lot of things that can only be realized through rejection.<br><br>But then again I'm not saying that I don't want Yukino to end up with 8man, I just want both of them to grow which is exactly what the major premise of the story. I would be really happy if all the little things the novel showed be brought up again such as <br> the picture she bought from the Christmas trip show up again in their living room once 8man and her settle down and have a family  <br> having 8man's third question result in not being friends but lovers.  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei and 8man would be head over heels for him. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei <br> Drinks <br> Smokes <br> Ancient anime references <br> Punches <br>Do you really want this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's not what 8man found alluring in sensei.</br>  <br>She probably can't handle drinks and with her condition smoking is the worst she can do.<br>She does tend to go on rants about the things she likes but not as intense as Hiratsuka does.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but that's the point.</br>  <br>Was it really necessary to continue these threads under a trick like that? Let's just let them die. It's time to move on to new series and new discussions. Really now at this point there's nothing left to discuss about the series. At least the Irohafags are honest about only wanting to waifu worship.</br>  <br>This will happen if 8man rejects Yukino, what will make her realize she is actually Sensei from the past, then they'll battle it out to see who is the real Yukino</br>  <br>We have important things to talk about such as...<br><br>How would Yukino initiate sex? Would she bluntly state her need to have children or would she beat around the bush (like she often does) and imply it only to shyly reject the idea once 8man catches on?<br><br>This is important information dammit!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious how she'll act by the end of the series.</br>  <br>Is that before or after she goes super Yukinon when Hachiman dies?</br>  <br>She would keep teasing him until he's unable to resist. She wouldn't be the first to initiate early on in the relationship.</br>  <br>I think it'll be 90% hormones when she does it, but it'll start with her working a jab at 8man's sexual prowess into her banter and escalate to a "yeah, well prove it" moment when she gets right in 8man's face. Then finally realizes what the hell she's doing and that she really, really wants to pin him down and take a ride on the 8 inches, and from there it's just a matter of who caves first.<br><br>I'm wondering how Yui would work it now too. I think the shy hint-dropping would be more up her alley, though I can see her just showing up in the bedroom in new lingerie and letting nature take its course too.</br></br></br>  Rank the following Yaharis by order of intelligence (currently in random order): Yukino, Yui, Iroha, Hachiman, Saki, Komachi, Sensei, Yumiko, Cunt, Tobe, Zaimokuza, Saika  <br>I'm also quite curious about what their family interactions would be like<br><br> The hikigaya family goes to the beach <br> 8man unconsciously stares at girls <br> "Hachiman, what are you looking at?" <br> "N-nothing really" <br> "Is that so? Hey, have you heard? There were news yesterday that a wife killed her husband" <br>"R-really? why?"<br>"She had believed he had been cheating on him, shows that people shouldn't underestimate a woman's jealousy huh.."<br>"I-I suppose.."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn.

Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3.

Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is cunt ranked so highly?</br>  <br>Not him but he's perceptive as fuck</br>  <br>Not only is he book smart but he can also apply that intelligence in the real world.

It's so full of bullshit and biased.</br></br>  Is the anime doing a good adaptation so far?  <br>it wasn't much.</br>  Mostly, there are some scenes where the shadows are simplified which lessens their impact.  I find it better than the manga    Shokugeki no Soma threads are pretty dead, aren't they?  The anime is pretty much following the manga exactly. You're not missing out on much if you decide to go in it anime-only.<br><br>Plus we get great scenes like this in the anime<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Guc<wbr>0wnMdYhw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the last one?</br>  Good because Erina ZR looks nicer than manga.  <br>BEST ENDING? BEST ENDING!</br>  Fucking hell, I love this show. It's stupid, yet it does everything right.<br><br>Would you let Meat Master master your meat?</br></br>  It's doing a pretty good job, but a few things that annoy me:<br>-Much less well stylised than the manga<br>-Doesn't say his trademark "it wasn't much"<br>-Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga<br>On the plus side, it makes a lot of scenes more hype</br></br></br></br>  <br>The scanlations have a much darker image than the original. And shadows don't really count as part of good adaptation. So far as adaptation is concerned it doing great and is almost a 1:1 accurate. They even added Erina's background from the one-shot and given her more screen time compared to the manga. The only major difference so far is the Karaage arc was rearranged after Jouichirou's visit which didn't do any harm to flow of the story.</br>  <br> Doesn't say his trademark "it wasn't much" <br>Yes he does, it's just that the sub for it is different. It's a pretty hard phrase to translate into English anyway.</br></br>  <br>Oh, does he still say it in nip? Wonder why they'd change the TL, the way they translate it in the manga works fine</br>   Best villain shows up once then never returns <br>How horrible. I wanted to see more of the sexy URBAN RAIFE PURANNER</br>  <br>Good, but I worry they are not going to be able to fit the entire tournament arc in the eps left.</br>  <br>Plot twist: She is actually the end game love choice. Turns up to cheer for Souma in his final shokugeki, causes him to win</br>  When will one of the girls bet their hair in a challenge? At least one of them has to get some character development right?  <br>if she grew her hair out, yes</br>  <br>They won't. Not with 8 episodes left. There's still the Karaage arc and they still have to introduce Hayama Akira and Shiomi Jun. At best it will end at the preliminaries.</br>  <br>they made him sound like a dewgong</br>  <br>but....the short blonde hair is her best feature<br><br><br>in a heartbeat</br></br></br></br>  <br>about as good an adaption as you could expect. definitely the best JC Staff adaption i've seen. that said nothing can match Tosh's art. and at times the anime seems lacking</br>  <br> Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga <br>But Takumi is never annoying?</br></br>  <br> nothing can match Tosh's art <br>I agree with you on that. The anime's art style is still pretty good. It's just Tosh's is not easy to replicate.</br></br>   there are people who think Erina is NOT going to win the soumabowl <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7l4<wbr>ESr0PdSQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Learn your place, plebs</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Where is this from? Is this real?</br></br>  <br> There are some retards who actually think a drama CD affects the results of who wins the Soumabowl <br>Erinafags delusional as always</br></br>  ameritits &gt; erina<br>fit brown &gt; blonde</br>  <br>Drama CD</br>  <br> Souma becomes a world famous chef and marries a christmas cake office lady <br>My dick can't handle this</br></br>  Literally Fairy Tail's Cooking Guide.  <br>is it canon?</br>  <br>I want her to have neck/shoulder length hair. It would fit her.</br>  <br>Just think, Souma's dad got to cuddle with that every night at Polar Star.</br>  <br>Videotape your suicide when Megumi beats her the fuck out.</br>  <br>i don't see why it wouldn't be<br><br>so yes it is canon</br></br></br>  <br>You mean cuddle with this every night?</br>  <br>Ha ha no. Megumi Lite there just schlicked to the idea.</br>  <br> but....the short blonde hair is her best feature <br>Nigga please, we both know her best feature are her juicy, succulent, sensitive lips. They're made for kissing.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with the false flagging Nagi</br>  <br>And to think that Hisako and him became bros.</br>  Call me dumb/a newfag/whatever but are the recipes in Shokugeki no Soma even viable? Did the author actually research this or is he just pulling shit out of his ass?  <br> Erina winning the soumabowl. <br> Megumi winning the takumibowl. <br> meat getting btfo. <br><br>Drama cd was great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didnt post the recipe book for nothing.</br>   4 days in and soma's masterful plan is a new dish and benches <br><br>hurry the fuck up already</br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>He has a professional chef filling him in on these things.</br>  <br>They have an actual chef that makes the recipes. This even has a recipe book.</br>  <br>don't lewd the meat<br><br>I just want to make her wear a frilly dress and tease her.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Wow, that's fucking awesome m8.<br>I love it when writers actually research what they're writing about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's also a hot model, someone post the pics</br>  <br> Hot model chef <br>Makes you wonder if being a model AND an advisor for a manga/anime intended for children isn't detrimental to her culinary career.</br></br>   no knife thief in the new OP <br>Not sure if they are getting rid of him or actually being geniuses by following him theme of not being noticed</br>  <br>If anything it might be great advertisement for her.<br><br> hello m'dear, my son in middle school is a huge fan of that cooking manga you advise on <br> would you make the mackerel burger and eggs benedict next time I bring my family for dinner? </br></br></br></br>  this last arc is fucking things up. how long can a fucking banquet last. they are really destroying the pace.  <br>It was only 10 chapters and it's almost ending.</br>  <br>It feels like another karaage arc to me. Something light hearted before shit goes down again. Just can't wait to see what goes down and how. My expectation is that it will involve Erina quite heavily since she has had so much presence recently</br>  <br>That was cute as fuck.</br>  <br> it was only 10 chapters <br>the thing is 10 chapters of the same thing. the autumn election was not only based on ONE fucking fight.<br>yes there are many different movements souma is taking. but it took really long. it could have been simplified to 6 to 7 chapters. with the other 3 or 4-5 chapters still being the same festival but with different things to do.<br><br><br>I didn't think the karaage arc was shit, but like you said it has the same feeling. the arc itself was also long.<br><br>Seeing some Erina happening would be nice and would give some progress FUCKING FINALLY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This scenario they did for the drama CD would have fit perfectly with that limo scene they had after leaving Tootsuki resort.</br>  Hisako and Souma teaming up again when?  <br>Is suppose to be what happened in that scene.</br>  Color chapter is here   I just want Erina to find out that Souma is Jouchirou's son.<br><br>Just, do it this year please.</br></br>  <br> fucking soma's humming voice </br>  <br>I didn't mean that the karaage arc was shit either, just that the 2 arcs have a very similar 'calm before the storm' feeling to me. I know what you mean though, we really need some Erina progress. Hopefully shed some light on her relationship with Jouichirou and help her relationship with Souma in a serious way</br>  <br>-They're completely different mediums, as far as the art style goes it matches it very very well and the animation has been way better than expected. Not god tier or anything, but I was expecting average to low average.<br>-he does<br>-He's only slightly more tsun, the dere will come once soma wins back his messa luna</br></br></br>  <br>no cabbage 0/10</br>  <br>She kinda does look like a mini Hisako.</br>  <br>yep, I mean the whole fucking scar on souma, his mother. still nothing about it. and we are allready in the 100 numbers. there should be some flashback arc.</br>  <br>it's supposed to fit in that exact limo scene and complement it</br>  <br>That would have been nice to see drawn out in manga form.</br>  <br> flashback arcs <br>no fucking thanks</br></br>  <br>SZS proved that you can maintain a style across mediums. The animation is really good, but I feel like the character designs are a lot more generic in the anime than the manga.</br>  <br> and we are already in the 100 numbers <br>This manga will go for more 400-500 chapters.<br>Jouichirou back story never.</br></br></br>  <br>I would kill for it because they literally have the best chemistry.</br>  <br><br>*Edit wrong quote.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather not have flashback arcs, but certainly some more info on the backstory would be nice. I'm just hoping the success doesn't cause the manga to overstretch itself for sales</br>  Did the Shokugeki x Isobe collabs get removed from Batoto again?  <br>God damn it. Fuck Batoto.</br>  <br>Why did they get removed? Did some idiot think they were unofficial or some shit?</br>  <br> she ate all of the takoyaki </br>  <br>Probably this again<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128137<wbr>242/#128174683</wbr></br></br>  <br>Why does Erina always sound like she's orgasming. I had that link running and I thought it was porn.</br>  <br>Because Risa Taneda</br>  <br>Now I want her to try peanut butter squid tentacles.</br>  <br>She'll try it in the last chapter.</br>  <br>Such a great singer<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kfj<wbr>PqZpIslc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful and strong voice, why did I think of enka though</br>  <br>I love how the first episode made animeonlyfags think SnS was going to be pure fap material, then afterwards it barely has any aside from the occasional pantsu or tit shot</br>  Why does she wear the shorts?  No one cared who she was until she put on the shorts.<br> She didn't wear them as a loli, so this is actually true. </br>  Why was that phone service provider so homophobic?  <br>   so this is actually true. <br>No it isn't, because people cared about her as a loli.<br>Stop bringing /tv/ memes to /a/ and stop being stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Better question is why doesn't Touma upgrade to a better model.</br>  <br>Homosexuality is a horrible mental illness, anon. You should probably get yourself checked</br>  Maybe her butt hurts  She's watched enough anime to know extra protection is needed.  <br>Because shorts are great for qt tomboys</br>  <br> short life span <br> no tangible personality outside of deadpan trolling <br><br>It's too depressing to think about.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because she wants to be able to run around freely and she can't do that with Tokiwadai's required short skirt.</br></br>  More like:<br>Why is the Tokiwadai winter uniform so great?</br>  <br>How does it feel to be an idiot?</br>  <br><br>There not shorts there boxers that she puts on backwards for Touma's easy access when ever they want a quicky. (See NT7 cover).</br></br>  <br>Best Misaka</br>  <br><br>Best bum too.</br></br>  <br>It's literally identical to all the other Misakas.</br>  <br>How does adding more clothing make it easier to run?</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  She is a lvl 5 so she is a celebrity. Everyone is looking at her every time. She does not want anyone to see her pantsu  <br><br>Because the shorts cover up her panties and she doesn't have to be careful about her movements because of it? <br><br>She fucking says this herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they are comfy, and easy to wear. <br> NOW LETS BATTLE </br></br>  <br>A pure maiden like her is very conscious of her modesty.</br>  <br>She doesn't seem to care about modesty when she's lusting after Touma's Dick like a whore.</br>  <br>Touma doesn't count. All life is sexually attracted to Touma.</br>  <br>TouMAN does that to everyone though.</br>    <br>If you pulled them off would she die?</br>  Kamikoto a cutest pairing    <br>A lot of modesty for a Level 5.</br>  <br><br>Kamisaten, however, is the sexiest. Level Zero Love is alive and well.</br></br>  <br> Love <br>Habitual rape is not love.</br></br>  Touma could unite a harem the likes of which has never been seen if only he could COOK.  <br><br> if only he could COOK <br><br>He can. His cooking skills have improved considerably since Index moved in. Using bare bones ingredients to make delicious meals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He does cook, but he has to work with shit tier ingredients</br>  <br>I want to see Shirou and Touma broing about morality.</br>  <br><br>Can't he pleasure level 5s for money?</br></br>  <br>Touma would beat up Shirou for trying to sacrifice himself constantly. even though he does the same.</br>  <br><br> Misaki paying Touma to be a gigolo </br></br>  <br>And then Shirou would beat up Touma because he is trying to sacrifice himself for him.</br>  <br>And then they fuck.</br>  <br>I wonder if Touma's hand thing works on Shirou.</br>  <br>Because she has a bad habit of kicking shit when she goes MAXIMUM OVER TSUN against vending machines. <br>She only hits them because they don't do what she wants without a little negative reinforcement. <br>It's why she treats Touma the same way.</br></br></br>    <br>Its magic so it will</br>  <br>Was ruining his meme part of your plan?</br>  <br>Well it could work on reinforcement, though I don't remember if it is a one time thing or it's something that Shirou has to constantly spend mana on, since that would have an Innocentius like reaction.</br>  <br>Would it work on his projections? Cause they are good enough in to fooling the world in to not destroying them to keep the world the same, and thats pretty much what IB does, so would it fool IB too?</br>  <br>Projections are still made from mana so I think IB would work on them, since it's constantly draining mana from his surroundings.</br>  <br>I think its somewhat iffy, cause the reason it drains the mana is because it doesnt belong there, but these projections fool the world in to believing that they do belong there, which is why he does not need to keep pumping mana in to them to keep them active. I get what you are saying and it would make sense if IB was just something that was anti magic.</br>  <br><br><br>A better question is if Kamijou "Slug Like a Thug" Touma could beat Shirou in a fight even if his hand does break his projections.</br></br></br>  <br>When Misaka shoots lightning at him she creates a magnetic field that makes real electrons fly in his direction.<br>He doesn't cancel out the field which he can't touch. He destroys the electrons.</br></br>  <br>Maybe. Shirou is more /fit/ though.</br>  <br><br><br>Actually, Shirou is pretty fit himself. Even without magic he is pretty swole. <br><br>Touma only seems to be a good fighter because he can cancel an opponent's primary means of fighting, leaving them to rely on their physical skills which are likely neglected, as they don't actually need them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, man. Shirou "The Hero better than the Level Zero" Emiya does exercise every morning and has super high jump technique and he's not even part of the track and field club.</br>  <br>I thought that esper powers are based off the esper replacing reality with their own personal reality?<br><br>so it works like<br> Misaka convinces the world that electrons can be fired around the place <br> Imagine Breaker calls bullshit <br> Misaka's personal reality is removed <br><br>Or did i misunderstand it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably not unless he can moralfag speech him in to letting himself get beat up. All Shirou would have to do is trace something powerful and the sword would do the rest. Touma cant keep up with saint speed and Shirou can get to pretty close to that depending on what weapon he traces. And even without that he is pretty good at fighting, so he could probably just bring a wooden sword and beat him up</br>  <br>Her power is electromagnetism, not electron-manipulation.</br>  <br>So the same way that UBW works?</br>  <br>Shirou could just cut off touma's arm right?<br>:^)</br></br>  <br>Don't use emoticons on /a/.</br>  <br>Touma could still catch a cannonball midflight and shit on Rensa.</br>  <br>Assuming I'm correct</br>  can shirou stop the dragon things in touma arm  <br>Thats like begging to get rekd</br>  <br> going back through your myspace from 2005 <br><br>I was such a little faggot</br></br></br>  <br>When will these two fuck?</br>  <br>After he fucks Othinus.</br>  <br>Well that is how the espers work as far as I know. There is probably more to it that we don/t know about yet that has not been presented to us.</br>  <br>That site still exists?</br>  <br>They eventually do in  index3 </br>  <br>So to our current knowledge, Touma can negate UBW<br><br>we will know use this knowledge to learn why misaka wears shorts under her skirt</br></br></br>    The answer is obvious folks.<br><br>To hide the truth.  She has a penis. </br></br>  <br> that watermark </br>  <br><br>It was that or VLC.</br></br>  tfw I have a fetish for Boxers/bike shorts under skirts<br>and   Electricity as a means of torture  <br>If Biribiri ever went full sadist I'd be diamonds.</br></br>  <br>Ocelot pls go.</br>  <br>Didn't she go full sadist in Railgun SS2?</br>  <br>I want to marry Mikoto.</br>  <br>No. I want to marry Mikoto-chan.</br>  <br><br> MySpace roleplaying <br><br>It's hard to imagine it was ten years ago, but shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not calling her Miko-chan <br>You've already lost.</br></br>  <br>You'll never understand the pure pleasure of slamming a long silver bullet into a well greased chamber.</br>  <br>Mikotocchi</br>  <br><br> not calling her just Miko. <br><br>Miko deserves better than you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be extremely embarrassing</br>  <br><br>Every doujin with these two is vanilla concentrate boiled down to the raw.</br></br>  <br> not calling her Bill Cosby <br>Plebs.

It rivals ZR.</br></br></br>  <br>So people like you can't see her pantsu</br>  <br>Kuroko is the absolute worst kind of girl for Touma, so it's fitting that he should end up with her.</br>  It baffles me how appealing her design is.  <br>Her design is average and plain, especially compared to all the colorful variety of designs the other Raildex girls have.</br>  <br> rivals ZR <br>It's far superior to ZR.</br></br>  <br>That's why she stands out.</br>  I want to fuck a hamster.  <br>probably Ruka.

Also, you can go grab Armor of Ban Ard under the camp. The only danger is fighting Vincent Traut, and The Eternal battle, but I actually found consistent, no-death strategies for that section. I can sleepwalk through it now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how the only times in the manga where Darling is getting serious are either related to punching some guy in the face or cooking.</br>  <br>I was referring to the "Port" and "Tia" thing but whatever</br>  <br>wat</br>  <br>8/10 anon.</br>  <br>Why the fuck did it ate an elephant ?</br>  FIGHT ME FAGGOTS!  <br>I like this</br>  <br>Why is darling so low?</br>  <br>I AM ACTIVELY FIGHTING YOU RIGHT NOW</br>  RACHNERA A SHIT  <br>Thanks. I did Iorveths paths so I'll watch that scene now.<br><br>Mah nigga, your taste-buds work perfectly.</br></br></br>  IMO, Miia is just immature as shit. Hence why I don't like her, personally. She always acts really stupidly and on impulse.<br><br>Rachnea or Cerea are best girls to me, because they're mature to a heavy degree. Rachnea is always trying to be her best for Kimihito, and Cerea is so loyal it's almost silly, but to me just comes across as endearing.<br><br>Papi is too dumb and loli-like, and Mero is too into murdering Kimihito for love-tragedy's sake.<br><br>I'm not sure what to think on Lala.<br><br>I really can't understand those that love Miia considering she's just so obnoxious. She also can't cook for shit and poisons everyone all the time as well, so there's that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this one is actually pretty good</br>  <br>I can't steal another man's waifu, it just doesn't feel right.</br>  <br>[insert pasta w/ unlimited breadsticks about how Miia is totally justified and she did nothing wrong]</br>    <br>MIGHT MAKES RIGHT</br>  <br>Rachnee is best girl.<br><br>Would bicker with for a lifetime.</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure if Id rate Cerea that high but more or less a decent list</br>  Big question!<br>Why does the manga show tits and swearing but the anime is more sfw?<br>Why can't the anime have tits?</br></br>  <br> No Cerea at S+ <br>Naw m8, naw.</br></br>  <br> Big question! <br>Maybe they want to sell Blu-Rays and make money by retroactively putting tits in.</br></br>  <br>I want to know this too.<br><br>Anime a mega shit.</br></br></br>  <br>she indeed is, fellow rachnerafriend</br>  <br>ARIGATOU CRABMAN!</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Careful, you might make all the Miafags mad.

Genuine question, I just want your butthurt to end.</br>  <br>Its fake as fuck. Some people still bought it though.</br>  Just watched first episode.<br><br>The "twist" fell flat for me considering I figured it out after the first minute. Is this going to be Madoka 2.0 or does it retain the lighthearted elements?</br></br>  <br>Explain how you found out in the first minute. Of course I assume you don't mean literally but what tipped you off.<br><br> does it retain the lighthearted elements <br>Yes up until I certain incident.</br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 he read the manga</br>  <br> Madoka 2.0 <br><br>Just stop.</br></br></br>  <br>So Yuki waking up inside the school and getting dressed was enough for you to go "Yep, zombie apocalypse"?</br>  <br> finding out after the first minute <br>Oh well, if you watched it so late after all people on fucking /a/ were saying "HOLY SHIT THAT PLOT TWIST IN FIRST EP" everywhere in OPs, after details and images were spread en masse in dozens of threads, no wonder you got the idea. You trying to look so clever and condescending towards any kind of thematical subversion/scenaristic tool is ultimately a failure.</br></br>  <br> finding out after the first minute </br>  <br>I know you're manufacturing these "So I just watched GG and..." to make it seem like we're discussing something and this isn't a general, but you don't need to try so hard.</br>  I feel like we've already had this thread before. Hm.  <br>Trying to get my friend into it almost failed because the fucking synopsis almost spoiled it while we were downloading it. Sure he found out so early because he expected something as soon as I tabbed out of the synopsis. <br><br>Who fucking does that. He ended up finding out about it at the hard-tack scene (for the most part).</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's the deconstruction of Madoka's Evangelion.</br>  Did you figure out Megu-nee was already dead in the first minute?   Madoka 2.0 <br>Nice bait thread to keep the general going friend. Sage for obvious reasons</br>  <br>What the fuck anon WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT HOW TERRIFYING</br>  <br>Sadly, we can't blame the broadcasters for doing this, they have obligations to uphold and giving a short guess of what to expect in an anime is one of those. Lying or tricking someone into watching something whereas it ends up being something else could actually be taken into court, if I'm not mistaken.</br>  <br> Just watched first episode. <br><br>Just right after the last thread died? What a coincidence.</br></br></br>  <br>Granted, first minute was hyperbole. But by halfway the episode there's been the hints of the renamed rooms, the peculiar animation differences of the nonexistant characters, and Miki completely disregarding them.<br><br>The only thing in advance I knew was that there was gonna be a plot twist of some sort. And honestly it didn't feel very subtle to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you know? dressing girls is a symbol of zombie apocalypse in anime.</br>  <br>I just got here, there was no thread up so I made one. Bite me.</br>  <br>Well, you got the idea at least. It was supposed to give you hints before the reveal. I also knew something would happen at the end, the difference is that the anime actually bored me so I jumped half of the episode, and the plot twist hit me damn hard anyway. Expecting a plot twist is something, expecting the nature of said twist is an entirely different thing</br>  <br>If you knew there was going to be a twist then of course you were looking out for it. But things like animating background characters differently is incredibly common in anime, and for all you knew they were still setting up Miki as that sort of character. I read the manga ages ago so of course I knew, but I think they pulled it off decently enough to trick anyone going in blind. It dragged out a little long though.</br>  <br>That's not quite the first minute. Yeah, there are tons and tons of hints, some obvious and some not, they obviously wanted you to know there was something going on.<br><br>If it was just out of nowhere without any possibility of figuring anything out beforehand then it would be dumb and cheap.</br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean even things like Yuyushiki were in the middle of a zombie apocalypse?</br>  <br> common in anime <br>Yeah, so much stuff can be overlooked because of that.<br>Why are they living in the school? Moe anime.<br>Why is there a dog running around in school? Moe anime.<br>Why is Miki so socially retarded? Moe anime.<br>Why aren't there teachers stopping them? Moe anime.<br>Why do background characters keep disappearing? Moe anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Shamelessly requesting the Yuyushiki puppet theory.</br>  Reminder that Miki is involved in ALL Gakkou Gurashi ships  <br>For me the overly cutesy character even for a SoL made me suspicious and then the talking to people that no one else sees made it obvious.</br>  <br>Not in my personal ship.</br>    Kangaroo isn't real, is she?  <br> Rii is the only one without one <br><br> The bear doesn't count. </br></br></br>  Let's liven up the thread.  Is the Miki guy real or just an illusion?  <br>Miki is real.  The dick is an illusion. </br>      <br>How could you think Miki is an illusion?</br>  <br>Miki a real  slut. </br>  <br>Rii/Kurumi</br>  RII A  PUTA   <br>Too perfect to be real, for example you can realise Shovel is real because she is a slut.</br>  <br>Literally when?</br>  <br>Miki is not a slut. Miki is not a slut!</br>  <br>It's way too obvious to be a tweest, I bet she's actually real.</br>  <br>Has this chapter already been translated?</br>  <br>Having a stable love interest is not being a slut.</br>  <br>I ship Yuuri X Yuki.</br>  <br> red knees <br>slut</br></br>  I want to help Hika with her cravings.  <br>I'd like to tickle her thighs in private.</br>  Why is it so hard for Japan to just make a serious anime without any stupid little girl bullshit?  <br>Literally begging for semen.</br>  Is chapter 38 already translated?<br>It came out last week IIRC.</br>  <br>The twist isn't the point of this series. It doesn't even last the entire series. People hyping it up for the twist are big dummies.</br>  <br>Because children and pedophiles comprise the vast majority of the audience.</br>  <br>This. Makes me realize that she was a zombie since the beginning and she bite sempai.</br>  <br/>    <br><br>Maybe she has knee bursitis. Don't bully the shovel.</br></br>  <br>Yuki got the first panty shot.</br>  <br>Yep.<br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336</br></br>  <br> Bullying Miki <br>Why is Shovel so shit?</br></br>  <br> mess around with drunken college guys <br>What? That entire scene was to show that she DOESN'T do that</br></br>  <br>Never.  I was poorly attempting to make a joke with the picture. </br>  <br>The biggest question is, who got Rii-san pregnant?</br>  <br>I want to see Yuki breaking for real. Not just being depressed, melancholic, or her mind gradually snapping back into sanity in a cathartic rush, but trembling in sheer terror with nobody near to offer comfort.</br>  <br>You mean like this?</br>  <br> but trembling in sheer terror with nobody near to  <br>offer comfort.<br><br>That happened at least twice.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The "twist" fell flat for me considering I figured it out after the first minute. <br>ooooooh look at this edgelord here. a lying edgelord too. go back to MAL, and stop trying so hard to fit in.</br></br>  <br>The dog.</br>  <br> Korean <br>Ok, well played, anon, well played.<br> it's kinda annoying that 36 and 37 and + are not posted anywhere I could find it, since watching every thread is impossible. I can wait </br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck her, but not in a puddle of broken glass. That shit is to heavy for me, sry.</br>  <br>Because this is not the 90s anymore. The average modern anime fan feels uneasy without pink-haired bug-eyed girls.</br>  <br>That didn't bring her anywhere near the breaking point.<br><br>When? Everybody ran to her when she offed that zombie and started crying, and in the flashback Megu-nee was the one to comfort her. That's nowhere near being alone and abandoned.</br></br></br>    <br>She was pregnant before the thing happened.</br>  <br> distortion + moustache <br>It's evolving</br></br>  <br>That has happened twice, albeit briefly</br>  <br>Honestly, GG would lose all of it's charme and things that make it feel different if they didn't use typical Moe MCs.<br>Here it's a bad complaint.</br></br>  WHERE ARE MY SUBS [kdfss] YOU FUCKS  <br><br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/gerMN<wbr>YWC/file.html<br><br>36 and 37</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  Would Miki have lost if the School Living club didn't find her?  <br>Yes probably.</br>  <br><br> Yes </br></br>  <br>No, the school living club would have lost if Miki didn't find them.</br>  <br> WAS ME </br>  <br><br>Gakkou Gurashi is actually an argument against moe.<br><br>The zombie apocalypse represents the worthless NEET fans that are destroying anime.<br>Before the zombie apocalypse, Yuki (who represents moe) was liked by noone, a depressed bullied outsider for her odd quirky behavior.<br>After the zombie apocalypse, Yuki is beloved by all for her odd quirky behavior.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please stop, I literally just came back from school where someone was trying to explain why don't blink was an amazing movie by making crackpot allegory connections.

They even made rii's breasts bigger</br>   Did I make it in time?   <br>That would probably be because it's actually the artist editing his own stuff.</br>  <br>So do they explain why the cat hat girl has different uniform than the other 3 girls?</br>  <br>Symbolism.</br>  <br>It's in negative.

Like zombies. </br>  <br>At least lower the resolution so it doesn't look like complete ass.</br>  I don't watch this anime but I know ou the shovel girl is the sluttiest of the cast.  <br>The memes actually, we have some pretty funny over here, I personally like the mexicans.</br>  <br>Nice try Mikifag.</br>  <br>All the Gurashis are pure love.</br>  <br>you mean pure sex</br>  <br>Except  Yuuri . She's pure  shit </br>  I'm pretty sure the gakkou gurashi general can agree that Yuuri is worst girl.  <br>not even close</br>  <br>Fuck you, Yuki is best girl.</br>  <br>Only secondaries hate Yuki.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she's a sexual predator as well.<br> Yuki starts regaining her sanity and independence <br> Rii suddenly finds a new girl to play big sister to </br></br></br>  <br><br>Glasses-chan=Yuki&gt;Shovel&gt;Miki&gt;Kei&gt;M<wbr>egu-nee&gt;Helicopter-kun&gt;Crossbow-kun<wbr>&gt;Radio-chan&gt;Bear&gt;Dog&gt;shit&gt;Rii</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>that bitch with the brown hair is the worst girl<br>she's more delusional than Yuki PLUS she's a not-cute-at-all cunt who brakes the rules. <br>also she lacks prescene: only one I can't remember the name of.</br></br></br>  <br>Was Yuuri the one who got bite and return to the club endangering them?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128635559 <br>BLOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</br>  <br>Walnut = Cathat &gt; Radio-chan &gt; Miki &gt; Megu-nee &gt; bear girl &gt; College sluts &gt; Rii</br>    <br>No, that's Kurumi and that certified her as the best because she immediately told them what happened instead of trying to keep it secret.</br>  <br>why?</br>  So what the fuck is that pink slut's problem? Is she insane or just plain autismal?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128635559 <br>I can't tell if that's a bad filter or a bad transparent.</br>  <br>Now that I think about it, chances are high that the infection began in Randall Corporation itself as the alarms were not activated. The Gakkous are heading to the eye of the storm.</br>  <br>She is the sanest in the group.</br>  <br>And why would they gain with that? giving the responsibility to kill her to Yuuri while Miki search for an improbable cure.</br>  <br>she's retarded</br>   zombies <br>Couldn't they come up with something more fresh? Zombie apocalypse is boring as fuck even with cute girls.</br>  <br>what if Yuki is the doctor of the other 3 girls who are in a mental asylum and imagining a zombie apocalypse?</br>  <br>Why did she change her underwear but left the clothes by her? Where is the old underwear? Did the Shovel steal them?</br>  <br> improbable cure <br>The cure being a thing was a fact though.</br></br>  What does /a/ think of World Trigger?  <br>I like Chika</br>  I completely forgot about it.  <br>Filler season starts this october, I'm actually somehow hyped as we almost reached the manga already</br>  Really good for a battle shonen.  Dropped the anime after episode 11, it was really dull and the stupid shota constantly making the (￣ε￣) face annoyed the shit out of me.  I think I should mention that I usually dump its latest chapter along with other WSJ series on Monday (under the WSJD tag), but I have no proper internet until Tuesday this week. Also, I'm running out of data on this thing. I may not even be able to rip the issue like this in the first place. Just a head's up in this pretty much dead on arrival thread. If no one picks up my slack, I'll do it Tuesday morning.  <br> 1 day delay <br>Don't worry, you always delivered, so that's really not a problem at all.</br></br>  I genuinely can't believe I'm a little excited for filler.  <br>Probably the best series in WSJ right now and Toei is ready to milk it for all its worth</br>  It's the second best WSJ title right now and I'm really enjoying the anime, even with its shit animation.

Requesting Nishikino Maki-chan please! I'm extra late this weekend, at least I caught the beginning of this thread. Her doing anything cute would be cool but her with Tamaki or cosplaying as her would be awesome! Thank you if you take this up  Final try, I thinks~<br><br><br>Requesting something cute with my lovely Q, from [C] - Control.<br>There's really not much of her, so forgive the limited reference.<br><br>She's a quiet, somewhat emotionless character, sometimes those emotions do shine through though - I'm bias towards embarrassed blushes.<br><br>Just seeing her sleeping, embarrassed, eating, whatever, would cheer me up on an otherwise slow sunday.<br><br>Thanks for reading, or considering. If anyone works on a piece I'd greatly appreciate it.<br>I hope anyone who's not received a piece yet has a chance to get something too!<br><br>P.S.<br>I'm still warning people that I did receive something last weekend, looking at other requests first is encouraged, as somebody may have never got something!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Inori lying on a bed, sleeping, and hugging her pillow<br><br>Alternative: Inori wearing Haman Karns black/purple outfit.<br>http://i.imgur.com/U43hSBa.jpg <br><br>Anything else is fine too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd love to see mai waifu doing something with other waifus together but I have nothing particular in mind</br></br>  Requesting Alleyne in a "looking at viewer" image like this one:<br>http://i.imgur.com/8uvEl6el.jpg<br>Without the chocolate, rather a smile.<br><br>If not anything's fine as long as it's not too lewd.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Ibuki Mioda waiting in line for a concert and getting all hyped up for it.

But please put people that didn't get deliveries ahead of me</br></br>  <br>Neck may seem a bit long</br>  Requesting Ishizu Ishtar in a card dealer's outfit, dealing cards to the viewer at a game of Blackjack.<br> Apologies for the shitty imgur ref. <br>http://i.imgur.com/IUrkC6Y.jpg</br></br>  <br>Yotsugi and someones waifu training in a boxing gym, one as a trainer and another as a boxer, if someone's willing to pair up.

Requesting my husbando Kuranosuke Koibuchi, perhaps in anything horror genre related.<br><br>Have a good weekend everyone!</br></br>  <br>Hmm then, how about Mimi  teaching Akari  how to kick?<br>Or just playing Tales of Symphonia together.</br></br>  Requesting my dear sweet Lancer in Doutanuki Masakuni's battle clothing. Any level of the clothing is fine. I'm not picky however and will accept him having summer fun in any possible way, from fishing to beach time and anything in between. Tight swimsuits preferred, but draw what you are comfortable with.<br>Lancer Refs: http://imgur.com/a/Axfod/all<br>Doutanuki Refs: http://imgur.com/a/HsPXS/all<br> Being a husbandofag is as suffering as my husbando is, thank heavens my Battle Continuation and Endurance are Rank A when it comes to him. </br></br></br>  Requesting my beloved Mizuhashi Parsee wearing a nice green bikini being tsundere and a jealously girl, please  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio.<br><br>I'd like to see her in a cute sundress being happy.<br>If possible, having fun at the amusement park, with cotton candy in her hand.<br><br>Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you Ochakobro, I hope the coming week is favorable for you</br>  <br>Ryou and Ryuuko sharing a bite to eat while talking about their onee-chans.</br>  <br>How about Futayo Honda  and Mai Natsume  dueling?</br>  <br>I'm not requesting. You should find someone who still needs a delivery.</br>  <br>Chronoire and Mirai playing twister</br>  <br>No problem, same to you!<br><br><br>May I please request Erwin in either cute underwear or an old man sweater like in reference picture? Thank you!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which waifus would you NOT like to see your waifu together with? I just don't want to annoy anyone.</br>  <br>It would just be better to link to anon's post without a pairing to ask if they are willing to pair up with your waifu. I'd probably be willing to pair up with anyone.</br>  <br>They said this doesn't count as a delivery<br> and I didn't wanna do the same old Ryou/Kyou pairing </br></br>  <br>Hex and Bleach girls</br>  <br> that red underwear <br><br>anon, i ...</br></br></br>  <br>Might I say that you have very interesting underwear choices there? I would have gone full on frills and bows for the best gap moe. Your choices are very good though, very cute in a different sense. Tight underwear is the best though. My husbando agrees.</br>  <br><br>I have a suggestion. How about, after this weekend's threads are over, we move on to a new thread in which we'll discuss just that? We could throw around ideas and see who we'd like to see her paired up with, and what they could be doing.</br></br>  <br>You have no clue at all how utterly risque male underwear can get, nor how frilly.</br>  I actually would like to see my waifu  shyly kissing another waifu while holding her hand   <br>NTR fags are really the worst.</br>  <br>I like red and I like Hello Kitty haha I'm glad you like my choices, anon! Tight underwear is totally he best.</br>  <br>If Kuromeanon doesn't mind, Kurome and Maka doing Tokusatsu poses together. Poses in pic related would be neat, but if you have something else in mind that's cool too.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127934439 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128205338 <br>If Kuromeanon doesn't want in or has another suggestion I don't mind. I just wanted to see something with them together but I haven't seen him in a week or two...<br>Either way good luck with the collage!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add, it'd be great if she was wearing an elegant dress as well.</br>  Requesting Mazaki Anzu.<br>Follow this link for a random yu-gi-oh card to associate her with.<br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Specia<wbr>l:Random/Card_Gallery<br><br>Anything dance related is also very much appreciated. (Ballet, hula, samba, belly, break, rhythmic gymnastics etc)</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I'd be up for that probably. Link to it after the weekend.</br>  Requesting Mei Hatsume! Here's a big list of request ideas:<br><br>-Reading a comicbook<br><br>-Making a superhero costume or fitting a hero costume around a mannequin<br><br>-Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop<br><br>-This one is probably really hard, but I want a picture that makes it look like she's inside the monitor, fixing the insides behind a shattered part of the background. And to make it look like there's a glass wall between the viewer and the inside<br><br>-Cleaning/doing maintenance on her goggles <br><br>-Doing/wearing anything steampunk related<br><br>-Anything with her in chibi form<br><br>Thanks for considering!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who said I was into NTR? I thought it was cute. Don't you think it's sexy that you're waifu was experimenting to see if maybe she could treat you to a threesome one day?</br>  <br>Where is she from ? She's  so cute </br>  Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  <br>I'm really loving it so far. Was nice to wake up and see the updated progress on it. Just take your time and have fun finishing it. Thanks a ton!</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind</br>  <br>its not NTR if its yuri.</br>  Requesting Birdy in a Sarong bikini please. BEWARE some of the refs are of 3dpd, and are only intended as reference.<br>http://imgur.com/a/oKhX8#0<br>OR hair braiding.<br>http://imgur.com/nDKglCC <br>http://imgur.com/a/cmY90#0<br>Good luck everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like something with Youko, but I don't know if any other anon would want to pair their waifu with her.</br>  Requesting Aichi lazily playing a 3DS on a couch in casual clothing. If you have any ideas of your own that is fine too.  <br><br><br>and<br><br>In a battlebot competition?

I'm sure your waifu is cute too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My  girlfriend  ended up really getting into my waifu too.

Or if it's just one her trying to do PE class pair activities by herself while everyone has fun around her.</br>  <br>How many suggestions are you going to take? I see a lot of requests now.</br>  <br><br>No ideas. No known friend waifus.</br></br>  Whose waifu is really quiet but still sociable?<br><br> I hope I'm not offending you Ochakobro</br></br>  <br>Shion doing something with Shino since they have similar names<br> Here is the ref for shion if you need it </br></br>  Requesting Yuki sleeping under the sun  <br>btw guys just want to mention the ones I do actually do won't get done today, I want to actually spend time trying to make things pretty for once and try various thingies. I'll probably deliver next weekend.</br>  Who else has a monster girl waifu?  <br>Good luck!<br><br> Where is the cut off point of requests you are taking? </br></br></br>  For the anon who requested Akari!  <br>Spy Kobeni would be pretty legit, I'd be fine with that.</br>  <br>Are you going to do all or just pick some you like? I had an idea in my head since it's related to the girls' source material, but it's kind of boring.</br>  Reposted from last thread<br><br>Requesting Yukari Yakumo (left) dressed up as Nyarlathotep (right).<br>Be sure that she also has Nya's hairstyle, glasses and everything.</br></br></br>  <br>called it!</br>  <br>I'm prob late as hell but<br> with  doing </br></br>  <br><br>Allow me to help</br></br>  <br>Nice idea. What other waifus have similar names?</br>  <br>I'll probably end up doing all the ones that have both references linked (too lazy to track down waifus by name) at various points in time.<br><br>but I'm not some good drawfag or anything I just want something to work on, so don't look forward to it or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks! I didn't see it!</br>  <br>Thank you very much Ochakobro, I really appreciate it!<br><br>But if possible, do you think you could make her eyes green, please?</br></br></br>  Requesting Kneesocks, anything goes.<br><br>A different hairstyle might be interesting, artist's choice.</br></br>  Requesting Tsukihi dressed like a rapper  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629527 <br>It's common courtesy to stop requesting for the weekend after you got yourself a nice delivery.</br>  <br>Sorry anon, fixed!</br>  Requesting Pyrrha Alexandra in Yomi's clothes please~<br><br>Extra reference:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/484135/0d5f83<wbr>c941/<br><br>I have hope my waifu will be drawn!</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629571 <br><br>Alright, I'll wait 'till the next weekend.</br></br>  <br>No problem, thank you very very much for drawing my beloved!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128629527 <br>Some anons would kill for two nice deliveries like what you got.

If Akameanon doesn't mind. <br><br><br><br><br>Thank you for consideration.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting Beatrice cackling or something cute, preferably with the eyelashes in pic but if you can't then it's fine.  <br>Here's a reference picture for her outfit if you need it</br>  <br>len and seo cosplaying as vanilla and mint?<br>saved. thanks ive never seen that image before.<br><br>your  right? that would be nice too see.</br></br></br></br>  <br>requesting  drinking tea at a table with my waifu Yukari Yakumo. Only if he doesn't object though.</br>  Requesting anything lewd.  <br>That sounds pretty cute, fine by me if he does it</br>  <br>It is said the your waifu might have been based off mine.<br>Beatrice is an amazing waifu tbh.</br></br>  <br>How many more are you doing?

Thanks  <br>does shinoanon still request here?</br>  <br>Yeah I heard something about that a while back, they're both pretty great</br>  <br>currently have 6 in queue. but feel free to request whatever you want, it just might take longer to get to.</br>  I'd like to request my Noir<br><br>Anything is fine, but perhaps seeing her in summery wear or wearing oversized clothing, semi-lewd or otherwise.<br><br>Or maybe dressed in Tamamo's clothes/Granberia's armor, of MGQ fame.<br>Ref:http://imgur.com/dUZuWZ7<br><br>Have a good weekend, either way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How's that Audere's beach collage going?  <br>Me.</br>  <br>Oh crap I only just saw this, this is so cute thank you so much! How long did this take to make?</br>  <br>Hope you like it, anon!</br>  <br>That's wonderful to hear. If it's not too much trouble I'd like to see Shinjiro Aragaki and Ryuko Matoi hanging out, doing anything fun.<br>I know there are a few Ryukofags, I only asked 1 of them, but if it's a problem for any others go ahead and ignore this!<br><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/a/1437735742189.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/a/1437735742189.<wbr>jpg</wbr></a><br><a href="https://i.4cdn.org/a/1437736977640.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.4cdn.org/a/1437736977640.<wbr>jpg</wbr></a><br>Thank you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she looks super cute, thank you Ochakobro!

Anything non lewd is fine by me.<br><br>Have a good week, everyone.</br></br>  <br>I love your portraits. I'm almost tempted to request something</br>  <br>These portraits are making me miss portraitanon.<br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Had a few ideas but I don't talk in any of the regular hang outs so I don't have any idea who to go to for a collaboration. Still have my golf idea but I have yet to follow through on making a post for that to work. I gave up half way through thinking the request seemed to greedy.<br><br>Would drawfriends pick up requests involving multiple waifus or is it just something that seems cute but its not all that feasible when you get down to drawing it? Most drawfriends seem to wanna do quick drawings they can hammer out quickly/easily so they can move on to the next one.</br></br></br>  Requesting Rukia! Thank you.  Requesting Hagoromo Gitsune wearing the outfit on the right side of the reference. Anything else is fine, too.  <br>Why not use the general?</br>  Draw C.C. being cute.  <br>you can request, I have no more requests at the moment! I just finished my 30th one this weekend, so I'll probably only take two or three more requests. <br><br>About to head to the store, so leave your requests and I'll get to them when I get back!</br></br></br>  <br>Draw for this guy<br/></br>  <br>Gotcha! Added!</br>  <br>I dont mind at all, it sounds like a really cute idea!</br>  <br>I don't want to get the reputation for being a double dipper. Requesting your waifu outside the WWD is a slippery slope.</br>  <br>That reputation doesn't even matter. The people who call others out on it are people who do it themselves because they are afraid of competition. Total scum.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128631539 <br>Really? Who was it? I saved all of the reference pics on my desktop in order, too. I'm so sorry, please put a reference picture and I'll draw her.</br>  <br>Requesting my dear Orihime (picture) and Nanami  in a hot tub together.</br>  Kindly requesting Claudia Madobe getting dressed in the morning. Thank you.  Requesting Tsuruya please. Perhaps as a magical girl or idol.<br><br>Anything else is fine. Take it easy!</br></br>  <br>I like to keep my head down and stay out of the shitposting.<br><br>There is always next week. I'm not so far out of touch with reality that my week revolves around getting a delivery,  yet. </br></br></br>  <br> I AM RETARDED AND REALIZE NOW THAT YOU DID DRAW HER<br>I CANNOT APOLOGIZE ENOUGH FOR THAT WONDERFUL PIECE AND MY ABSENTEEISM!</br> </br>  <br><br>You gotta be shitting me</br></br>  <br>Requesting Tamamo and Nero symmetrically docking while arguing. Or just plain arguing.</br>  Requesting Rozalin dressed as Margaret http://img.ctrlv.in/img/15/07/18/55<wbr>a9a5fbaf5c3.jpg or just in the top and shorts, please.  Mayhap an image of likes of http://i.imgur.com/FLbNlWp.png  </wbr>  I miss Marisabro I wanted to request something with his waifu and mine ; ;  <br>I sort of want my waifu somewhere in the corner/middle of this</br>  <br>Deliverin'<br>I'm going to draw your cute flora/fauna waifu and you're going to like it</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128631848 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128631848 <br>That was me all along.<br>I was confused because i was here when you thought http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=49225 was tsubasa and I did not stick around to see that that was not the case.<br>You don't need to draw her again if that is my waifu. I full on goofed.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128631848 <br>I think he just missed it. You've been drawing so many waifus its understandable if that did happen though. You're doing god's work ochakobro.</br>  <br>Oh gosh, it's okay. I was so confused, but I'm glad I didn't just skip over you! I felt so horrible!</br>  <br><br>Noir  and Natsume  killing a daemon.</br></br>  <br>Ohh! I saved her as 'Tsubasa' for some reason, I don't know why. I really don't. So I posted her as that. Unfortunately, I am not very knowledgeable about lots of anime characters and have messed up with names... Please forgive me, I'll try harder next time haha</br>  Requesting Ran doing the Rancho Relaxo taunt from Team Fortress 2, and instead of a chair, Ran uses her tails as the chair.<br><br>Rancho ref: http://i.imgur.com/q6FRfum.png<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8HJ<wbr>nW0GLDVE</wbr>  [ ] [Embed] [Embed]</br></br></br>  <br>All cleared up now! I really like the work you do!</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Th-thanks, anon! I hope you request from me next weekend! Or even on the normal drawthread, I should participate in that a few days out of the week!<br><br>Thank you so much, I'm happy everyone has been so kind and appreciative!</br></br></br>  <br>Reimubro please!</br>  <br>Nor OR but fucking great. I would plant her if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I'm also going to attempt to draw a little more than what I have been. So like my picture.</br>  <br>Anon pls you have a waifu!</br>  <br>If it's not too late, I would like to see Misato doing something with another waifu. I can't think of one specifically though, maybe another waifu that is also tsundere or if someone wishes to join Misato, that would be great.</br>  <br>This is fun. Here's my ideas:<br><br>What if you paired up Doremi with someone a little more "hardcore," like with a combat form or weapons or something, and they were doing something really mundane together, like drinking tea? <br><br>Or what if you paired her with someone with huge stonkin tits and they could be doing something fanservicey but all the fanservice goes to the boob waifu and Doremi just looks jealous or embarassed about it.<br><br>I also have this thing about seeing her in different outfits, so her costume-swapped with anyone would be cool. Doremi has a lot of costumes to work with herself that I imagine it might be fun to dress other waifus in. <br><br>Rias seems like she'd work well for these to me but I feel strange choosing another anons waifu when they're all so lovely and who knows what that anon would think of my ideas.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a bunch, after a bad day this really made me smile!<br>I wasn't expecting anything at this point either, so it makes it much sweeter.<br><br>You have a really nice and simplistic style (I don't mean bad by that at all), it makes her look even cuter, definitely fitting.<br><br>I hope you have a good week, this will help uplift mine!<br><br> Repost due to an error in punctuation </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   no one wants to do anything with your waifu <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Who is she?</br>  <br>I'd like to take her out to a nice seafood dinner and then never call her again</br>  <br>oora!</br>  <br>Request her yourself with another waifu. I did the same.</br>  <br> and then never call her again <br>RUDE</br></br>  <br>no one wants anything with mine either</br>  <br>Eww no I don't want mine being paired with a meme</br>  <br>Hey, mine too</br>  Requesting Yukino as a cute loli  <br>Im surprised that greedy faggot hasnt requested that yet</br>  <br/>  <br>It's not even being delivered this week, fuck off.</br>  Requesting waifus running from a thunderstorm.  <br>Oh shit didn't see this. Thanks drawfriend!</br>  <br>dont worry they will request next weekend too despite knowing</br>  <br>So will everyone, these are under collage rules. Stop shitposting.</br>  <br>He said it doesn't count for regular request you dumb shit</br>  <br>No duh, the drawfriend said himself that it doesn't count as a delivery. Everyone requests the next week if someone says they will do something the week before because they don't know if they will actually get delivered that week.

Now he's just being a greedy cunt who feels like the mass delivery wasn't enough and needs more shit.</br>  Hey, hope the day or night finds you well.

Thank you in advance.</br></br></wbr>  <br>So you are mad. Gotcha.</br>  <br>And you're defending a greedy faggot begging for more. Fuck off to your stream.</br>  <br>Why don't you go there and tell him yourself to fuck off tough guy?</br>  <br>Why did you reply, you silly twat.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot for drawing her, anon. Especially at the end of the weekend, you just saved my weekend !<br><br>I hope you'll have a nice day.</br></br></br>  <br>Tamakifag wasn't even this bad. He even pleased people before making another request<br>What's your excuse?</br></br>  Marika!  health  <br>etnabro delivered on friday</br>  <br>Post it, faggot.</br>  <br>Actually I delivered in this thread just earlier as well.</br>  <br>oh wait, my bad, was that last thread?</br>  <br>That ryuko drawing?  I'm trying not to laugh but holy fuck. You guys can't make this any more obvious <br><br>That's one. You got more than 5 to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Drink a bleach and rat poison cocktail.</br>  Draw me a Ritsu in dubs mode like patrick bateman in pic related  Whenever I don't get a delivery, I just convince myself that a drawfag is making a really good one for me and needs to spend all week drawing it.<br><br><br><br>I do think it's fairly rude of you to do this. You knew it would cause a shitstorm.</br></br></br></br>  The anti-Circle goyim know! Mods, bury the evidence!  <br>This isn't a thing for this weekend, though. This is something that will get posted possibly several weeks from now.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention, her hands look fucking weird and her dress should cover more.</br>  <br>go away</br>  <br>It's still in poor form to rerequest and beg for art trades when you get a fucking mass delivery. Are you just doing this to get a rise out of everyone? You think this shit is funny?</br>  surely is drawing here  <br>I find it more hilarious that he knew the mass deliveries were coming (hell he fucking watched them draw them for him and planned the whole LOL REREQUEST IT'S JUST A COLLAGE on Friday) yet he requested anyway and got more deliveries on top of his collage.</br>  <br>After looking back on how many requests the drawfag actually has, you're right It will take several weeks for him to even get to you and getting a mass delivery shouldn't stop you from a delivery that far away. Sorry bout that.</br>  <br>Like this<br> hide toes <br>muri desu</br></br></br>  <br>I might be fixing it up and also coloring it if you want to stick around.</br>  <br>salmon?</br>  <br>but this<br><br>Was also incredibly rude too. I don't think being a drawfag should allow you to be a dick.</br></br></br>  <br>If it was something he had intended to do for this weekend, there's no way I would've requested to be part of it. But much like the sharkbro thing from several months ago, he planned to deliver those like two months later. So I didn't feel like I'd have to not request for that.<br>And besides, when he does deliver that collage, I won't rerequest that weekend, because it would be a delivery.<br>Also, way too busy drawing to engage in these arguments.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I have to leave to do things, but you can still post the results, I will see them in a few hours.<br><br>Thanks again, anon.</br></br></br>   Precure Thread   Dead stream was the pits.

Thanks colorfag.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't seen it yet, but I'm willing to bet it's not actually as terrible as people say. I've seen some cool animation from it anyway, and even though I know nothing about her, I actually like Ace's design at least which I always see people say is bad.</br>  <br>My experience with things /pc/ claimed to be terrible:<br><br> MH <br>Aside from Honoka being shafted and Hikari being a walking plot device, it isn't that different from FW and has one of the best finale in the franchise.<br><br> Suite <br>Hibiki and Kanade bitching at each other at first aren't that terrible, and Trio the Minor are somewhat fun if a little forgetable. Beat rocks and Hummy is a miracle of the universe and Noise is the best Precure villain.<br><br> Smile <br>Characters are one dimensional sure, but it has fun episodic feel to it and is pretty much what it set to do from the start. Some unexpected cool things here and there like the mid-season climax and ICE SWORD and Happy Robo too.<br><br>So it's all just a matter of opinions again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it isn't that different from FW <br>Down to several episodes being almost literally repeats.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki and Kanade have stopped being tsun-tsun to each other too early. They were fun.</br>    <br>I think FW and MH are just really sloppy in general because they were still figuring out Precure, but then at the same time they did a lot of the good things about Precure first and some things even best I'd say, like the fightan, or the relationship between the cures.<br><br> Noise  <br>is definitely the best Big Bad for me. I like lots of other villians better, mostly because I think Noise didn't get to be on screen long enough to have much of a personality and I hated his design. He's still the greatest big bad though, honorable mention to Moebius. Those are honestly the only two I think stand out though. Big bads tend to disappoint me in precure. At least the Dark King didn't come out of nowhere I guess but he was otherwise just a plot device. Spoilers I guess, but they mostly suck and come out of nowhere so you have little reason to care about them. <br><br>Smile sort of feels like a parody of Precure to me and I like it a lot for those aspects. They do some sort of meta stuff there too. I think Smile is one of the prettiest though by far. Some of the cuts from those high quality episodes I honestly wasn't expecting to see until I watched the movie. <br><br><br> lacrosse episodes <br>These were mostly just bad. Only one seemed decent to me but then it was QUALITY. They actually had stock footage for lacrosse though I think, or they really were all just THAT similar. <br><br> science fair <br>these were definitely meh at best but I really like Honoka at least.<br><br> parents visit <br>These actually were great and I really like Honoka. That first one when she scolds the robbers is one of my favorite precure episodes. <br><br>I'm sure there's more and I know they actually do just straight up do a lot of stuff they already did again. I wish they would've done another Chutaro episode though. Or done anything at all with Hikaris friends from class outside that one scene. At least makes sense a lot of these things would happen on a yearly basis, like the school play.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Another thing I loved about Suite. I feel like Toei trolled me.</br>  <br>What a messy little girl.</br>  <br>I'm watching it now and it's okay, I suppose. It's not super pretty like Smile, but it's okay - maybe somewhere a little under Suite? The fighting has been pretty meh, animation-wise. I don't mind Ace's design necessarily, but she's part of a recurring theme in the series where there's a huge build-up to something completely different than what you were expecting. So expectation (and disappointment) can play hell with your enjoyment of the series, I think.</br>  <br>Souta is one lucky bastard.</br>  I miss Rikka.

Less boistrous, more refined or something. One of my favs is that HaCha main theme that plays at the end of an episode a lot. There's only some laaaaaa stuff to sing along to but it's so dang pretty.

It's similar to the first few seasons as well as introduces elements of later seasons so it's a good starting point to figure out which seasons you want to watch.</br>  <br>1) Suite<br>2) Heartcatch<br>3) Max Heart<br><br><br> which precure should I watch <br>Watch the current season with /pc/. Best starting places for "independent study" are probably Heartcatch (the most popular series) and Futari wa (the first series).<br><br> how kiddy is this show <br>Literally for six-year-old girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of his best moments. I wish he was still in the show.</br>  yeah but how kiddy is the show anyways? is there alot of corny stuff happening?  <br>Might as well catch up on the current season and livewatch with us on Saturdays, it's turning out to be pretty decent.<br><br>Beyond that, have a look at the picture and whoever catches your eye, watch their season.</br></br></br>  <br>1. Catch up with the current season.<br>2. Don't watch Heartcatch first, save it for 2nd or 3rd.<br>3. Max Heart and Gogo are S2s to Futari wa and Yes5 respectively.<br>4. Try to put a series between Futari wa/Max Heart and Splash Star.<br>5. This show is literally a toy commercial.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not as moralistic as western kids cartoons, but there are definitely lessons, silly misunderstandings and the amazing power of friendship. But there's also the occasional profoundly written character, certain seasons with intricately woven themes and serious asskicky fights. This year features princesses in ballgowns punching monsters in the face, literally.</br>  <br> serious asskicky fights <br>Case in point, this is from this year's episode one.</br></br>  <br> 2. Don't watch Heartcatch first, save it for 2nd or 3rd. <br>Huh, I've never heard that piece of advice before. Why do you say that?</br></br>  <br>Because Heartcatch is considered the best one and watching it first will get your hopes/standards for the show up too high. At least that's why I'd recommend not watching it first.</br>  <br>Not him, but I would recomend the same.<br><br>Mostly because Heartcatch is the the season with best production values that has the best fights and animation of all precure with the only competence given by Urara episodes in GoGo and the actual season..</br></br></br>  <br>It's odd, Urara was this shadow darling for all of Yes!5, wasn't she. Not pushed up front into the spotlight like Akane or Hime, but it seems like all of her episodes were unusually well animated.</br>  <br>They also gave her a fairy in GoGo</br>  <br>Makes sense. I would've guessed it was something about it being the least precure-like of the seasons, or not necessarily the best example of what to expect from other years. In my head, I've always imagined HC to be the best anime series of the set, but not necessarily the best precure series, if that makes sense.</br>  <br>I think that the animators or directors loved her.<br>Or maybe were the little girls who liked her the most, anyway someone really liked her for her episodes to be so special.</br></br>  Will Yui ever turn into a Cure? ;_;  <br>It's bretty good.</br>  <br>She's going to be a villain.</br>  <br>It's translated a few threads ago, but it was the combined version. I don't have it on this comp but search "Akagi Towa Knows Nothing".</br>  Come back from being busy all weekend, and I see only minor discussion because apparently dead streams. Well I thought it was a very good episode, QUALITY aside. Towa is still actually tormented by her trauma of Dyspear, Minami bonds with her because of their high class upbringings giving them something in common, more of Haruka's sister and family. The way someone mentioned before that Shut still finds Towa beautiful looks to be shaping up for a really interesting development, and how long it took for Towa and Minami to transform allowed for some interesting talking between them all. Next episode looks amazing too with the second fairy focus, I can only pray that they'll surprise us with another human transformation like they did last time. And the whole fever thing is somehow reminding me of  when Zuko in Avatar decided to become good. The fire theme and nightmares are pretty similar too.   <br>It's really hot today. Wish I had a cute girl to get sweaty with...</br>  <br>Touch squishy Setsu.</br>  <br> girl </br>  <br><br>I miss him.</br></br>  <br>I see titties anon. Itsuki is just really athletic.</br>  <br>He'll probably come back as a mindless drone in the fourth cour</br>  <br>Watch it for the ass kicking and corn.</br>  Post Kirara.  <br>There's even a cover for your head while you lick her navel. Fucking nice.</br>  Kirara so gallant  <br> Itsuko not in her cool male uniform <br>WHY<br>SHE LITERALLY WORE A FEMALE UNIFORM FOR ONE EPISODE</br></br></br>  Gokigenyo I wasn't here 10 days, what did I miss?  <br>Because big friends want see her pantsu</br>  Next episode looks great.  <br>Actually this.</br>  <br>I sing the this a lot while riding my bike. I think sometimes people hear me.</br>  Why noone ever raise an objection about Kirara's nonsensual nicknames.  http://mirai-e-jump.tumblr.com/post<wbr>/125063932343<br> Possible ED2 <br>PD:  Reminds me Ondo de Happipi </br></br></wbr>  <br>pic</br>  <br>"Chi" can be short for chinpo, chinchin, or chikubi. I think you're the nonsensual one here.</br>  <br><br>You mean hes been an adult the whole time ?</br></br>    N-master what are you doing  The fuck is Toei doing?  <br><br>I thought Kirara was his favorite this season. Is Towa slowly usurping that position?</br></br>  <br>This was the creepiest Precure's been since the  fake mother  episode in Fresh.</br>  <br>unprecure</br>  <br><br>That reminds me of the intro The Binding Of Issac.</br></br>  <br>And this is why they shouldn't throw away Dyspear. If she can be haunting like this over 10-12 episodes into the final arc of the series, that would set up a phenomenal ending.</br>    Would you still  GERURURURURU  with  him?   <br>Nope.<br>I predict either Tsubasa or Millio to be the "antagonists" of the season</br></br>  <br>Truly the worst Gatcha! Is there anything that man won't do! <br>  inb4 "women"  </br></br>  <br>Reminds me this</br>  <br>I'd rather ｷﾀ━━━━(ﾟ∀ﾟ)━━━━!! with Katze-san.</br>  Are you fucking kidding me.  What's this from?
