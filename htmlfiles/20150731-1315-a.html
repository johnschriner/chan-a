[ Daily reminder that Asuka &gt; Rei  Why would anyone like Rei. She's not even human  <br>Daily reminder that there is no need to have this thread everyday.</br>  <br>FACT THREAD<br>A<br>C<br>T<br><br>T<br>H<br>R<br>E<br>A<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Rei &gt; Asuka  <br>And yet we will... forever.</br>  I think Rei is more attractive and Asuka was kind of a bitch.  Asuka was a whiny whore. Rei was at least a normal person that could carry a converstion.<br><br>Rei&gt;misato-San&gt;yui&gt;asuka</br></br>  <br> Rei <br> normal person </br></br>  Rei &gt; Asuka  <br>What, is she better?</br>  Daily reminder it is completely illogical to hate one character just because you like the other. Both are qts and both have massive issues<br> but at least it's not racemixing if I fuck asuka </br>  <br> Asuka's eyes aren't even blue <br>Why did the quality of these shorts plummet so hard ?</br></br>  I like them both equally.  Misato &gt; Asuka &gt; Rei<br><br>Rei is not even human, asuka is a bitch but shes young and she might change</br></br>  <br>Misato is a slut.</br>  <br> &gt;implying all anime characters arent white anyway </br>  <br>We will never get a christmas cake Asuka.</br>  <br>She is at least half-nip maybe more in the reboot.</br>  <br><br>While true how about Asuka plus Rei.</br></br>  <br>"no"<br>there can only be one</br></br>  <br>Rei? More like gay.</br>  <br>She is just working off some stress</br>  <br>Honestly I am pretty butthurt that there aren't more sketches for this concept.</br>  <br>I wonder how fast Asuka would have turned over for a little be of love understanding and interest. Or if Rei had actually done more then silently judge and tolerate her.</br>  <br>How is Rei not human?</br>  <br>Jinzo aren't real people anon.<br><br> Clones got no souls. </br></br></br>  <br>EXPOSED</br>  <br><br>"The only vessel that contained a soul was Rei. She was the only one born with a soul. The Chamber of Guf was empty, you see."</br></br>  ex-asukafag here, i have now seen the light that is rei<br><br>ama</br></br>  <br>But the Eva's need souls to work right its why the dummy plugs needed the blank reis to function. No soul syncro no AT field.</br>  <br>Congratulations on getting off the meme bandwagon.</br>  <br>Did you notice Rei had bigger tits?<br>Or do you prefer your waifu mostly self actualized and still somehow dead inside.</br></br>  <br>If your still on 4chan your still on the meme bandwagon.</br>   Kaworu &gt; Shit &gt;&gt;&gt; Asuak &gt; Rei &gt; Misato &gt; Mary   <br> Rating an actual non-character higher than real characters </br>  <br>Kaworu is perfection.</br>  <br>That's exactly why he isn't a character.</br>  <br> But his suffering seemed trite, and he never seemed contradicted about what he should do other then kinda sorta in a monolog and that was mostly about finding the wrong thing in the pit. Misoto and Asuka stired the beast bellow my belly.  Maybe if Kaworu pleaded for his life or something before he let Shinji kill him or was shown to be depresed or angry even once.  </br>  <br><br>Kaworu is shit.</br></br>  <br>You're not a character</br>  <br>His character is to be perfect.</br>  <br>So deep. Sasuga Anno.</br>  <br>Mogo Karl was kinda fun, busting into women's bathrooms and killing kittens.</br>  <br>Karl was based.</br>  <br>The point is that he's perfect in every way.<br>Begging is something human,which he never claimed to be.</br></br>  <br>I was hoping he'd show some emotion other then joy and confusion in 3.33 or at least have some sociopathic gap moe but he was flat.<br><br><br>And that was why he couldn't do anything for me. Hell it would have been nice if Shinji snapped at him a little for being too good and representing the person he couldn't be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was glad he had more then one fight even if he truly replaced Asuka as the jobbing pilot.</br>  <br>He flipped the fuck out in 3.33, shaking and everything.<br><br> Shinji snapped at him a little for being too good <br>But it's because he was too good that Shinji melted like butter everytime he saw him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shinji wants to be (like) him.<br>Shinji wants to be with him.<br>Because unlike Shinji,Kaworu is perfect and he was the first person to demonstrate love towards him.<br><br>3.33 was really stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He flipped the fuck out in 3.33, shaking and everything. <br>That was confusion not anger or really even frustration and even if it wasn't he cycled really quickly back to calm. But if that moment happened in the middle of the gay piano, my dick would have responded.</br></br>  <br> 3.33 was really stupid. <br>Lets put a bomb collar on Shinji never explain anything and be surprised when it all goes tits up.</br></br>  <br>Break the smug bishounen is hot and everything, but it doesn't really make sense for Kaworu to act like that considering he's an alien and all.<br>But yeah, a suffering and crying Kaworu would be great, I want to see him lose his shit.</br></br>    <br>At least for me Asuka was more relatable, but I'm saying this as a ex-psychiatric patient.<br><br>I went through similar things as she did in the near end of the series. Which is why I'll say that Asuka is a far more complex and interesting character then blank slate doll.</br></br></br>  <br> an alien and all. <br>Are you sure? I thought he was an angel stuffed into the likeness of a person and human feelings of angst and did go through the good old five stages of grief and other text book psych shit. Hell they didn't even make a point out of How what he was doing was weird.<br><br>3.33 was a lump of sad shit that did nothing right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei isn't a person, but Gendo's figment doll of his wife.<br><br>Asuka and Misato were people with much more real issues then Rei.<br><br>Rei is a abnormal alien that doesn't really understand straight emotions.<br><br>Only till she gets rescued by Gendo she started to emit real emotions, but they're really obsessive.<br> <br>Just like Asuka to Kaiji, but less words and more action.<br><br>Asuka and Rei are good characters, but shouldn't be compared because that makes no fucking sense. IT BECOMES A WAIFU WAR and that ain't cool measuring people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Asuka is the blank slate doll, not Rei.<br><br>Rei has her own thoughts and ideas, Asuka is just living out what NERV made her to be, a pilot.</br></br></br>  Could Kaworu fix Rei and Asuka if he wasn't exclusively fixated on Shinji?  <br>I would have settled for him to go full rape mode with the same cheerful smile in an Eva fight,  especially if it was against Asuka and the humans  just for the glorious fallout it would cause Shinji.</br>  <br>I don't think so.<br>Also,Kaworu broke Shinji.</br></br>  <br> Rei <br> conversation <br><br>At most she'd listen to you a little before dismissing you possibly with a slap and one-liner. She saved all of her pretentious monologs for herself. And maybe Gendo.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Asuka and Rei are good characters, but shouldn't be compared because that makes no fucking sense. IT BECOMES A WAIFU WAR and that ain't cool measuring people. <br><br>You say that, but them's fighting words. Rei is every bit as much of a person as anyone else in the anime, and saying otherwise is actually pretty insulting to the character<br><br>If you want to talk about dolls in Evangelion, try shooting for Asuka. She's the one with the doll cuewords and categorizations in the past, and in the present she can't be construed to be anything more than NERV's doll.<br><br>Gendo obviously made Rei in an attempt to resurrect his wife, but it failed and Rei was born instead. Rei predates Gendo's and mankinds existence in Lilith too, and Rei is technically as alien as everyone else int he show. She's not normal, but who in this anime is?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By dying.</br>  <br>Kaworu could fix Asuka pretty good before he needs to be killed by the plot, because that guy was an ace at wading through people's shit to give them encouragement. Unless he would actually leave when asked.</br>  <br>Why form a bond with someone if you know nothing good will come out of it?<br>What Kaworu did was cruel.</br></br>  <br><br>Kaworu can't fix anything. Not even once has he ever fixed something, he's only made things worse.<br><br>Rebuild demonstrates he could be given virtually endless amounts of time, virtual immortality and endless tries + 14 years and still manage to be the dumbest sucker on the entire planet.<br><br>It's absolutely astounding how such a shit character in both performance and writing can at all remain popular. It's a testament to the poor judgment of many anime fans, and proof that fetish material is more important than a meaningful character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That whole Rei as Lilith thing could have been developed a lot better.<br><br>Also Rei did manage to internalize the doll thing because her big moment as a person was to define her self as "not a doll"  I can't remember if there was a you in front of that. </br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu could fix Asuka easily, but would break her the hardest out of anyone with his death. She'd probably refuse to kill him is anything.<br>For Rei, I'm not sure. I think she needed to solve her issues herself rather than rely on someone to solve them for her. But Kaworu did help her realize her identity as Lilith, at least.</br></br>  <br>Being fixed or broken are transient states, when he encountered Shinji in NGE he pulled him out of his funk and let him have hope in humanity and a small measure of faith in himself. Now when he had to do his angel thing and leave Shinji to his own devices of course he fell apart hard. But in the brief time they had together Shinji was better and debatable Karl was better for it as well.<br><br>Now Rebuild on the other hand is shit in all things and should be discarded unless its a rebuild thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu doesn't get battle fights because he's overpowered as fuck.<br>That's why they need to come up with some plot-related reason for him not to fight like in 3.33.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7LW<wbr>nYnLJzaY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>True story. mOOT said so.</br>  <br><br> moot left 4chinz 20 years ago </br></br>  <br>The problem here is that the series lacks any evidence that Rei at all thought of herself as a doll or couldn't figure out she wasn't.<br><br>The whole "Rei is a doll" thing is quite literally something akin to a meme. Rei is quiet, subservient and mostly passive, which has the superficial quality of being reminiscent of a doll. But it's not describing the actual person, and one is here judging the dog by it's tail or the cat by it's whiskers. <br><br>If you watch the series, Rei's issues are more about understanding her differences from normal humans rather than saying she's not a doll. Rei knows that perfectly well and has no qualms saying so, or doing things her way if necessary.<br><br><br>"Rei as Lilith" is a concept that wasn't necessary to develop more in the original series, and doing so would probably detract from the overall themes and messages. It's a concept that deserves exploration however, but it's not likely to happen because it would empower Rei and all the current management is concerned with is weakening Rei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei isn't Lilith in Rebuild.</br>  <br> Being fixed or broken are transient states, <br>When it comes to a person, this state needs to have a sense of permanency and safety to it, which isn't in the case for Shinji or anyone else.<br><br>Kaworu didn't pull Shinji out of his funk because Shinji's "funk" isn't repairable by just saying you love him once or twice. <br>Kaworu betrays Shinji and the rest of humanity in the anime and cannot be construed as a "good person" or a good character.<br><br>The brief time they had together only made things worse. It's like straightening out a piece of paper to be able to cut it better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebuild is fucking stupid.<br>I'm still mad that Kaworu became retarded for the plot.It was a poor way to initiate the climax of the movie.</br></br>  <br> Kaworu doesn't get battle fights because he's overpowered as fuck. <br>What a waste having him win one fight while Shinji jobbed to an angel would have made there final conflict so much better.<br><br>But having Shinji see Kaworu wreck Asuka like that would be how you say, erotic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't really discussing Rebuild, and all I said was that the concept he (or you) mentioned did deserve some exploration. Which it never gets for the reasons mentioned.</br>  <br>This in a way.<br>All Shinji needs is love,apreciation  and a good punch in the face so he can snap back to reality. </br></br>  Daily reminder that every NGE girl is wonderful and all the Rebuild girls are pure shit  <br>Unfortunately I can't argue with that.</br>  <br>These sick shades are the only good things to come out of rebuild.</br>  <br>Kaworu was always retarded. Kaworu isn't retarded in Rebuild because of "plot", it's the plot that's retarded because of Kaworu.<br><br>Because no matter how much some idiots try to twist it, 3.0 and focusing on Kaworu is a retarded move after a movie like 2.0. 2.0 had established characters, story lines and character interaction that above all felt real, something that's crucial if you're going to prove some point later on<br><br>The only way to force Kaworu x Shinji into the story when the movie more or less ends with Rei and Shinji in each other's arms, is from a narrative standpoint to destroy everything associated with that to create 3.0. Because having the characters in 2.0 fall apart naturally like in NGE would require time and effort, and they don't want that since it wouldn't be effective.<br><br>The plot needs to be opaque, dramatic and above all destructive, or else it would surely fail.<br><br>Basically if you're a Kaworu fan, you're the reason 3.0 is allowed to exist. Their low standards combined with an appetite for destruction and shallow pseudo-romance makes it possible to generate a sizeable fanbase that shut their brains off permanently when Kaworu is discussed.<br><br>Which is why 3.0 was received with thunderous applause from those types of fans despite how it destroyed everything Rebuild had except Kawoshin, and the only other bright sides for other fans is some character pandering.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NGE Keel did them better.</br>  Asukafags need to die. Their only argument is hurr durr Rei isn't a person.<br><br>Truth be told, you would have an easier time fixing Rei than you would fixing Asuka.<br><br>Rei's got her outclassed in every other category. If that cuck moot never posted about Asuka these threads wouldn't exist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His normal shades were good enough.</br>  <br> with Rei and Shinji in each other's arms <br>2.0 was originally going to end in Rei's death, but Enokido suggested she be saved last minute.<br>She was going to die regardless, this is what they set up in Rebuild since the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>This sort of argument isn't new. It's not moots fault exactly. It has existed as long as Evangelion has due to otaku rivalry, and even if it's wrong it's just one of the things people say because they lack arguments.</br>  <br> 2.0 was originally going to end in Rei's death, but Enokido suggested she be saved last minute. <br> She was going to die regardless, this is what they set up in Rebuild since the beginning. <br><br>See, this is why you're an asshole. You pull off drafts as some sort of evidence when there's several versions in which she doesn't die. Then the drafts didn't happen, what happened in the movie did. Stop trying justify something you know in your heart is wrong. The staff working on Rebuild made that scene with the intention of saving Rei, and the status after it was written was that Tsurumaki among others were certain she was saved or didn't die. <br><br>Rei was never going to "die", but you'd like her to die because it gets her out of the way so you it's all right for you. This proves what I'm saying right, there's no proper way to develop into Kawoshin and therefore everything had to be destroyed. Because this isn't about Rei as much as it is the entire world and the rest of the characters, everything takes a huge hit to make it possible. Rei only gets most of the attention because it's such a drastic downturn and ruination of a character, but there's a lot more going wrong here as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu isn't retarded in NGE.That scene with the fucking lances were stupid.The plot requires Kaworu to die and Shinji to fuck up,so they make Mr."perfect" go retarded over the lances.It's shit writing.But that's one of the many problems with that movie.<br>3.33 was always going to be the Kaworu movie anyway but they fucked everything up by trying to do this.<br><br>I like Kaworu because of all the damaged he caused.His "betrayel" was beaultifull.I like what he represents and what he makes Shinji feel.<br>I could care less about Kawoshin and muh gay anime,this series should be above this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then there is this faggot. <br><br>I don't watch eva for fixable people, I don't give a shit about that their suffering and flaws are more important then some hypothetical future fix.<br><br>I don't like Rei as much as Asuka because she is less fun to watch less dynamic, less ironic, and less interesting even with her clusterfuck background of being a clone god thing,<br><br>I like watching Asuka sure its like a trainwreak but its amazing to see how all of her bits and pieces work together to produce an almost functional person and how close she was to resolving and when she finally did it was incredibly satisfying.<br><br>Rei was too self actualized and depressed for me to care that much about after episode five. I can understand why Anno forgot about her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> r-rei is boring!!!1 <br><br>back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>I like how relatable all the characters are.<br><br>One day you relate to Shinji,the next one you relate to Rei and so on.</br></br></br>  <br>A different approach would be needed, and for once Kaworu couldn't be the only person Shinji could rely on just having him be there to gay piano after a near impact that didn't but almost fucked the world would still have been pretty good.</br>  <br> Kaworu isn't retarded in NGE <br>He is. He gets explained where Adam is and still makes the mistake. He dies for literally no reason whatsoever.<br><br>As for Rebuild, the "plot" doesn't require anything as the plot is malleable and entirely ignored in favor of briefly enabling character pandering. It's shit writing because the characters it panders are shit, as well is it's message and story. It can't support itself.<br><br> 3.33 was always going to be the Kaworu movie anyway but they fucked everything up by trying to do this. <br>No, it was not going to be, and the very idea of having a Kaworu movie is nauseating because it's not the fucking point of serious Evangelion story to have something like that.<br><br> this series should be above this. <br>it isn't</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> several versions in which she doesn't die <br>Where are these versions you speak of? According to the CRC, the original plan was for Rei II to die like she did in EoE, but Enokido suggesting otherwise last minute so the 2.0 ending could be more positive. That's why the rescue scene looks so forced and out of place.<br><br>She was still going to die later on, because that's how it happens in NGE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its true though what would you have done with her past episode five that's not part of her end game or fanservice?<br><br> Although I would have liked to have seen her try to open up to people who weren't Ikari or Shinji </br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>Part of the reason I don't like Rei is because she never tries to interact with anyone outside of Gendo and Shinji. It makes her seem shallow.</br></br>  <br> He is. He gets explained where Adam is and still makes the mistake. He dies for literally no reason whatsoever. <br>He sees that Adam is Lilith and recognizes that if he goes on he fucks humanity so he stops and has Shinji kill him so he can't do his mysterious bad thing that was somehow different from that other thing he totally meant to do, that we also don't quite know what it was.</br></br>  <br>To put it briefly, it couldn't have happened.<br><br><br>There are several draft versions you can read about, some storyboards too.<br><br> According to the CRC, the original plan was for Rei II to die like she did in EoE, but Enokido suggesting otherwise last minute so the 2.0 ending could be more positive. That's why the rescue scene looks so forced and out of place. <br><br>You're biased and wrong. Enokido doesn't provide a suggestion in the last minute, he's invited with meditated purpose, and the rescue scene is neither forced or out of place.<br><br> She was still going to die later on, because that's how it happens in NGE. <br>This is a bullshit argument because of two things:<br>We have already diverged from the series since 1.0, and 2.0 does it even more. Therefore, the continuation is under no obligation to follow the original as it has already broken that obligation.<br>The second is that the scene as proposed necessitates Rei being actually saved, and the belief among the staff was that she survived. This is also what is shown in the movie.<br><br>You're also missing the point: drafts don't happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He sees that Adam is Lilith and recognizes that if he goes on he fucks humanity <br>No, he knows that before seeing it's Lilith. Before going down there he know what he will do means the end for humanity.<br><br>He makes Shinji kill him for nothing, no reason at all. There's literally no reason both couldn't have walked out of there. None whatsoever.<br><br>Kaworu is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>exactly that, get her to open up<br><br>asuka on the other hand has deep psychological issues that require extensive counseling</br></br></br>  <br> To put it briefly, it couldn't have happened. <br>Why not? Sure my scenario relies on the time skip not happening and Shinji pseudo cheating on Rei but it seems viable enough to last a few scenes.</br></br>  <br>She interacts with Asuka and Toji.<br><br><br>That's pretty easy. Your spoiler pretty much lays it out, and there's always room for Rei to reflect more on what NERV is doing and whether or not she should be doing it herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He comes to the realization its Lilith when he sees her.<br>He died so humanity could live.He's an angel,he's too dangerous to be allowed to live.He has to die,now why he made Shinji kill him instead of Misato or Gendou,i don't know,probably because he likes Shinji.<br><br>They been hinting Kaworu since movie 1,it was obvious Kaworu was going to play a big part on movie 3.I agree that the message and story are shit,especially the story because the ending is pre-determined:Kaworu has to die and Shinji has to be miserable,then all the characters start doing ilogical things so we can get to the destination.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a reifag, this daily reminder saddens me. Not because what you say is true, but because there are so few of us left. Where have you gone my brothers? Stand strong, together, for your waifu's sake.</br>  <br>That's why it won't be viable. It's sort of pseudo-cheating even if they aren't romantically involved, you can't do it seriously and therefore you have to drop all pretense of seriousness and go with obscure and dramatic. Rather than pseudo-cheating, Shinji is happy and not desperate enough to associate with Kaworu. <br>The plot shift of characters would also be glaringly obvious, why aren't the rest getting developed properly like in NGE? It's why the characters must be sabotaged and wingclipped in terms of depth so there's no longer any point in hoping they eventually attain any such depth.<br><br>They can't be better than the "main dish".</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are several draft versions you can read about, some storyboards too. <br>There's nothing in the CRC. If you don't show me, then I'll have to assume you're lying.<br>I did see some storyboards of her death, however.<br><br> Well, the storyline where Unit-01 devours the angel was no longer present at the earliest stage of the plot. For the new movies, from the earliest stage of planning there was a conception where “Unit-01 will reach its operational limit, cease moving, and nearly become absorbed by the tenth angel; in order to save Shinji, Rei will forcibly unite Unit-00 with the angel and self-destruct.” The script was written according to that conception up until the fifth draft. That changed from the seventh draft on to a conception where the angel devoured Unit-00. It seemed more natural that, rather than deliberately fusing with the angel, Rei would be devoured by the angel and absorbed against her will. I didn’t arrive at that idea until a great deal of time had passed. I lamented my lack of talent [afterwards], wondering why I hadn’t thought of it before then. <br><br> Because “Rebuild of Evangelion” is basically a reconstruction of the TV series, we presume that sooner or later Rei II will die. If Shinji-kun were to save Rei II it would mean a significant departure from the TV series. However, I believed that the last scene of the film had to be an earth-shattering climax. When I had this idea, it was impossible for me not to communicate it. I remember, on the third day [of the sessions], performing a solo play in front of everyone using hand gestures and body movements entitled “this is how it ends!” <br><br> and the rescue scene is neither forced or out of place. <br>It is. Only 20 minutes before Shinji completely abandons Rei and gives not a single shit about her, not even enough to say goodbye before running away. And then suddenly he wants to save her, even more than the world? It's forced, but of course you'll defend it because it panders to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Human body, human brain. He didn't have a typically human mentality, but it was something not shared with any other angel that he personally learned and developed while in really warped human care.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1553<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn (embed)<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1552  (Cross-thread)</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Sylphy lifting Salama’s dress so its bottom is at her ribs, lustfully licking her navel as saliva dribbles down Salama’s cheek in ecstasy.<br> The cycle must be completed. </br>  Requesting sexy girls wearing sexy sandals to show off their lewd, sexy feet.  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

Holy shit, I don't care about Birdyfag or whoever this shitposter who insists I'm just trying to troll is (though I guess I care now since he's trying to fuck up my request), I just want Birdy lewd. No other lewd requests get shitposted, no other requests for girls who I know have waifufags get shitposted, but apparently if I make a Birdy request I'm trolling and I'm supposed to be happy with joke deliveries.<br><br><br>I did since now my requests are getting deleted, but I doubt it will do much good. I guess I have no choice if it gets deleted again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting a giantess Super Sonico squeezing a tiny Misaki Nakahara between her tits.  <br>Because there's a legitimate birdyfag who's pretty cool and seeing his waifu getting requested for lewds probably doesn't sit right with a few people.<br>I don't like it much, but I'm not going to resort to shitposting to say so.</br></br>  <br>Are you trying to me fap with that collage?</br>  <br>How about you stop requesting this request?</br>  Requesting eva units loitering around like delinquents.  <br>Well you could go request this in /h/ if you really want it. <br>It doesn't look like people here want to do it.</br></br>  <br>I can agree with this.<br>I don't mind if a person is requesting lewds of my waifu, to an extent.<br>As long as it's not anything like rape, or NTR, you know?</br></br></br>  <br>The older Sonico art were great</br>  <br>But damn, besides dat ass the rest looks pretty dam fine tho.</br>  <br>If you want lewds go to /h/ bro, or maybe you can request lewds of something else, I don't like Birdyfag but he's almost one of the oldfags so he's kinda respected aroud here, don't get mad and stop your uproar is just a bad request you can do better ones</br>  <br>Of course, that being said, I can understand if people don't want lewds of their own waifus requested at all.</br>  <br>Hell, I'm requesting semi-lewds this week</br>  Requesting Hibiki Tokai from Vandread being disappointed about how the anime he's from got removed from Netflix.<br><br>Nice Satan trips.</br></br>  <br>I got this.</br>  <br> 666 <br> Says the word Hell </br></br>  <br>Was it too lewd? And who gives a fuck about that anyway?</br>  <br>Satan isn't even trying anymore is he?</br>  <br> Was it too lewd? <br>No, no, no. I was just complimenting you on your post GET.</br></br>  What the fuck did I just read?  <br>seriously Kubo needs to stop eating magic mushrooms</br>  <br>Is mangapanda worth reading? Of course we don't have any good options between this and mangastream, but the intense placement of watermarks still throws me off.</br>  <br>we all agree Kubo do uses drugs</br>  <br>You can wait 1 week or so for a proper translator. The general translation is usually enough.</br>  The left hand is confused and that's the reason why it's on Yhwach's side.  <br>That's more explanation than kubo can process at any single time, of course it won't be as complicated as that.</br>  either everything will tie together in the end, or some one introduced Kubo to drugs  or kubo introduced us to drugs   <br>Pernida is  _________my waifu </br>   The hand that Pernida showed was the left <br> Every time the hood inflated it had the outline of fingers <br><br>KUBOOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br>  I don't even know anymore.   pernida held onto a ledge with his fingers    hands of the Soul King <br> Shinigami had the power of the right <br> Quincy had the power of the left <br> in the beginning of the series, it was described the balance of souls and hollows <br> shinigami had one philosophy, quincy had another <br> somehow one was viewed as more chaotic and evil and the other one wasn't <br> honestly don't know where I'm going with this from here </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Still need to know where teh legs are. And the dick too.  I want off Bleach's wild ride.  <br>It must be nice, knowing there are no depths to which your works might plunge, and the editors still won't shit can your crap manga</br>  <br>Right hand is master hand, left hand is crazy hand.</br>  <br>I guess that's how fetish artists work. No matter how shitty your work is, you'll always have fans if you appeal to someone.</br>  So if I remember correctly the Soul King we saw mostly consisted of Torso+Head.<br>With the right arm also subjugated by Bach, we getting fights against all the Soul King limbs?</br>  <br>The Soul King is the Forbidden One.</br>  <br>Exodia or Eat Fresh?</br>  Left handed people are the devil, always been since the dawn of time.<br><br>No surprise the left hand of soulking would side with the bad guys</br></br>    <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Reveal his face, reveal who he is. Literally nothing else.</br>  <br> hand <br> female name <br><br>Oh god what was he using it for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a shit ton for a single Bleach chapter.</br>  <br><br>Yeah sex with her is prob the only kind that you can get.</br></br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br> No background once again <br>Gee who would've fucking guessed?</br></br>   Give me a hand here, Pernida. <br> ................. <br> Crumbles zero division Sugatara into a ball of flesh <br><br>That foreshadowing</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The soul king named his left hand? There's a limit to being lonely.</br></br>  <br>Bach named it. Or it named itself</br>  When it fought Shutara it manifested a smal left hand. How is that possible?  <br>Pernida is a hand.</br>  <br>whenever kubo does stuff like this in bleach, it reminds me of the old times with Zombie powder</br>  Kubo can draw some cool shit when he tries.  Good lord the Sterns really are a ragtag band of degenerates.<br><br>Their members include:<br> a brain in a jar <br> a robot <br> the Left hand of the Soul King <br> a zombie trap <br> a fat midget <br> a black guy with a cowboy hat that I'm convinced is actually made from his own afro <br> a Thor/viking cosplayer <br> whatever the fuck Pepe is supposed to be <br> a JoJo character <br> a gorilla man <br><br>Where does Bach find these people?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> whatever the fuck Pepe is supposed to be <br>A frog?</br></br>  <br>They all represent a body part or a feeling. Yhwach's body parts</br>  <br>which part was NaNaNaNa Batman?</br>  <br>One of Ywachs rotting teeth.</br>  <br> never mind the fact its the reios other arm THERES NO BACKGROUND! <br><br><br>The pinnacle of autism.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His weak spots. Yhwach as a baby lacked everything. He gave other people what he didn't have. Then took all back</br>  <br>a djinn<br><br><br>As opposed ot the gotei?<br><br> guy who is war itself <br> nazi scientist <br> anthropomorphic wolf <br> dandy gambler <br> lesbo ninja <br> ice kid <br> hollowfied music teacher <br> blind nigger fly <br> literal snake <br><br>to name but a few. and all led by the god of death himself who has the ability to nuke worlds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want you to know it's very clear to everyone how hard you're trying to reach to make the gotei look weird and it is not working in the slightest.</br>  <br> &gt;a JoJo character <br>wait, who?</br></br>  <br> Where does Bach find these people? <br>bottom of the barrel</br></br>  <br>they are weird. maybe not sternritter levels of weird but weird nonetheless.</br>  <br>Probably the guy who runs away.<br>Joestar secret technique or whatever.</br></br>  <br>They're almost all just normal looking humans (ghosts) and having any kind of personality or power doesn't make them weird. <br><br>You made a stupid list and it failed. Just accept it.</br></br></br>  <br> he dissed my list <br><br>How will i ever salvage my heart from such bullying? ;_; muh list guys!</br></br></br>  <br>Your continued responses only make it more clear that you are infact upset. <br><br>Just digging yourself deeper and deeper.</br></br></br>  Mayuri confirmed Kefka  <br><br><br>Stop, this is getting out of hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry...guess i was feeling  listless </br>  <br> Where does Bach find these people? <br>Like this guy said the bottom of a barrel. Remember most of the Quincys are probably just straggler mugblood Quincy that Yhwach found after he woke up. The only true bloods left are the few 1000yr old ass ones that were still kicking, as well, as Ryuuken.</br></br>  I think we got another Mayuri face out of this, too.  <br>I thought all the mudbloods except ishida were killed?</br>  <br>Ass Knot survived</br>  <br>Opposite, Bach recalled all his power from the purebloods outside the Vandenreich, killing them. Ishida's mom also died for some reason, though.</br>  <br>she was not a pureblood</br>  <br>None of it makes any sense. Masaki was pureblood, she died. Ryuken and his father were pureblood, they survived. Ishida's mom is mudblood, she died. Ishida is mudblood, he survived.. and so did Ichigo.</br>  <br>Masaki was tainted by White. She was no longer pure. Ishida is and oddball. That's why YH is puzzeled by him</br>  <br>Ichigo mom got slash ed by a hollow, thus losing her pureblood status.</br>  <br><br><br>we've already seen that the auswahlen is a fuk you ability. he can choose who to take the power from.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the pinnacle of edge.</br>  <br>Wasnt it revealed that haschwalth is the one who chooses the targets?</br>  <br>Pernida is  male? Does God have a gender? </br>  <br> pinnacle of edge <br> not "I am the Edge" </br></br>  <br>Not to mention Hwach knew that Ichigo's mom power were taken away and died.</br>  <br>Oops, let's use the older one first, shall we?<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Well he's the Soul King, not the Soul Queen, so..</br>  <br>Juhah Bach mentioned Soul King is his father.</br>  <br>He's omnigendered, so you're free to assign whatever pronoun you want to her.</br>  <br>Gotei 13 captains are Final Fantasy bosses.</br>  <br>Holy shit</br>  <br>We have no evidence of this yet.</br>  <br> so you're free to assign whatever pronoun <br>inb4<br> use the correct pronouns you cis scum <br><br>i'm reminded of the dumblr tier autism when the chapters with jizzelle came out</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck off, vermin.</br>  And here's the new Mayuri face.<br><br> I don't know how to make it transparent on photoshop because I suck. </br></br>  Wonder if Kubo will try to explain this.Maybe it'll attack Mayuri with tentacle hands next chap.  <br>That guy was easily the most hilarious thing Bleach has ever showed to us.</br>  <br> menu bar <br> select <br> color range <br> select color you want to get rid of <br> hit similar or grow <br> right click <br> new layer via cut <br> hide layer <br> save as .png <br><br>couple of other ways to do it, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>why do i get the feeling mayuri will get his shit rekt soon? he's got too much momentum at the moment.<br><br><br>I think it looks great. But if youre the kind of person who reduces everything to 'le edge xD' its obvious youd hate it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think it looks great. <br>Kill yourself. It looks like a retarded shit from a J-horror show. I can see Kubo's "I'll make him tremendous" idea behind it.</br></br>  <br>Thats the point. its supposed to be gross. I bet you think liltotto and the bambitches are better designed.</br>  <br>The left hand is always seen as the bad one</br>  <br><br>Right-Hand Path[edit]<br>The Right-Hand Path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics:<br><br>They divide the concepts of mind, body and spirit into three separate, albeit interrelated, entities.[2]<br>They adhere to a specific moral code and a belief in some form of judgement, such as karma or the Threefold Law.[2]<br>The occultists Dion Fortune[3] and William G. Gray[4] consider non-magical Abrahamic religions to be RHP.<br><br>Left-Hand Path[edit]<br>The historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the Left-Hand Path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices:<br><br>They often reject societal convention and the status quo, which some suggest is in a search for spiritual freedom. As a part of this, LHP followers embrace magical techniques that would traditionally be viewed as taboo, for instance using sex magic or embracing Satanic imagery.[1]:197 As Mogg Morgan wrote, the "breaking of taboos makes magick more potent and can lead to reintegration and liberation, [for example] the eating of meat in a vegetarian community can have the same liberating effect as anal intercourse in a sexually inhibited straight society."[5]<br>They often question religious or moral dogma, instead adhering to forms of personal anarchism.[1]:198<br>They often embrace sexuality and incorporate it into magical ritual.[1]:205</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have tits, so they're automatically better designed than that Marilyn Manson album cover reject.</br>  <br>Easily.

I wonder if it was trying to break out of that cloak.  <br>More like<br> every chapter </br></br>  <br>Kenpachi's slash broke the chain between the thumb and the index finger.

There are people who probably still take this manga seriously.  <br><br>That sounds like an actual ability that someone in Bleach would have.</br></br>  <br><br>That's the scary part. Still, at least it's somewhat entertaining when it focuses on characters like Mayuri. I would rather read about fights between weirdo side characters than anything Ichigo and his crew do.</br></br>  <br>Yhwach has that power. He gives power like mimihagi and takes life like pernida. He is always shown with glowing hands while performing auswahlen. The Creator and Destroyer aspects are both present in him</br>  <br><br>I meant it in a more silly sense.

Though that actually sells well for some odd reason</br></br>   MEIN FUHRER I CAN WALK   <br><br>Yhwach hand picked the subjects whose powers he recalled. He may have spared Ichigo and his siblings due to their hollow immunity being beneficial to the race. Those who lost their powers inevitably died, not right away but they all collapsed and died after a month. Kanae had always been weak due to the hollow corruption in her, so when she lost her powers she went into a coma from which she never woke up. Masaki lost the means to defend herself and died protecting Ichigo.</br></br>  <br>Thank you for your pointless image trip faggot</br>  <br>Not sure. Bleach fell pretty hard and now the threads are just circlejerks between retards and two tripfags along with decline in sales and ranking.</br>  <br> along with decline in sales and ranking <br>Bleach hasn't changed the sales for two or three years. And rankings are meaningless, only sales count.</br></br>  <br> He may have spared Ichigo and his siblings due to their hollow immunity being beneficial to the race <br><br>I don't think he would care about something like the Quincy race, aren't they just like servants for him?</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, why don't you keep being a whiny little bitch about it. That'll show'em.</br>  <br>Wouldn't Yoruichi be a better choice?</br>  <br> This chapter was cool. I didn't expect Pernida to be a fucking hand. <br><br>Same here, I liked this chapter. It was Kubo at his finest. <br><br> I'm getting bored of Mayuri though. He's a literal walking asspull so there's no tension in his fights. <br><br>I think he is getting BTFO pretty soon, though. Doubt Pernida will be easily defeated.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole reason why quincies began hunting hollows was because hollows were their natural enemies.</br>  <br>Yeah, but while it means Quincy would care about it, I doubt Yhwach himself would. He doesn't really care much about the Quincies, they are only tools for him.</br>  <br>That depends a lot on which personality is dominant. He seems to have some sense of fatherly pride in their accomplishments. Complementing James after he died and saying that he was proud of him. He also wasn't very happy when Yama used ZnT South.</br>  <br> Complementing James after he died and saying that he was proud of him. <br><br>Didn't Jugo mention Yhwach becomes the Father of the Quincy during the Night?<br>Maybe there is an actual personality shift going on, Ishida did comment on how Jugo was acting different as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss the opportunity of having quincy/arrancarhybrids, instead they were used as nameless grunt and it sucks.</br>  <br>Was Lloyd mercy killed or for the evul lulz killed</br>  <br>It still confuses me as to why they were introduced they way they were but then abandoned. Ebern was one thing, but Luders' position implied that Yhwach had actually given some reasonable amount of responsibility to some of his Arrancar recruits. And then they just never came up again.</br>  mayuri is second best character in bleach  <br>Since when were you been under the impression you weren't on drugs?<br><br><br>You, the reader.</br></br></br></br>  <br>GIGI IS STILL A CUTE, FUCK YOU.</br>  <br>no, fuck that shit, it means yorouichi will die and no one wants yorouichi to fucking die.</br>  <br>It's like the hand is pitying him</br>  <br>Maybe it can see his future with the eye.</br>  <br>Mercy killed, he would've died either way.</br>  <br>Despite his comment about being able to nab as many as he wanted, he didn't seem to actually want that many. Quilge had a big batch and his soldiers expected him to gut every single one for giggles. <br><br>I don't think Kubo ever intended them to be numerous or important, just extra disposable pawns they could send on stupid missions without risking real quincy. Ivan was sent to test the medallion on Ichigo, and Luders' job was to talk shit to Yamamoto's face while they kill his beloved student in front of him.<br><br>We'll probably get mindbroken Sharktits backing up the elites eventually though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IMPOSSIBLE<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BPM<wbr>ztN1qHyY#t=10s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>What always confused me was the fact that it was Luders who lead the whole war declaration team. We never got to know much about it but we know Driscoll was part of the team since he was there to kill Chojiro and pin him to a wall. And judging from the masked figured the fuckhuge one was pretty clearly Driscoll. So it would have seemed like Luders outranked Driscoll, The Overkill, a Sternritter. But then Yhwach lobbed off Luder's arm and that was that.</br>   mfw Bleach never ends   <br> Bleach hasn't changed the sales for two or three years. <br>The delusion continues</br></br>  <br>Powerful argument.</br>  <br>It almost seems like a joke now, like Shaz Domino was. As if Luders just assumed he was so important and everyone else was just letting him believe he was hype shit, because he hadn't figured out that Yhwach is basically omniscient and practically a God.</br>  <br> Bleach hasn't changed the sales for two or three years <br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2011-11-30/top-selling-manga-in-j<wbr>apan-by-series/2011<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2012-12-02/30-top-selling-manga-i<wbr>n-japan-by-series/2012<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-12-01/top-selling-manga-in-j<wbr>apan-by-series/2013<br><br>Jesus fuck have you been living under a rock?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> these shinigoyim <br>Oy vey it's another quincy shoah!<br>And with Shoah I mean Zanka no Tachi South!<br><br>By the way, let me lend you some soul power, heheh</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please take this shit out of Bleach General, it just pushes the bump limit and will not amount to any meaningful discussion.</br></br>  <br>What meaningful discussion?

If the Imagine Breaker can negate any psychic power, then Shiki's Mystic Eyes, which is a psychic power, shouldn't be able to see Imagine Breaker's lines. Whether the hand itself has lines or not is irrelevant. <br><br>But, well, that's not really gonna stop Shiki from beating the shit out of Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe if touma punched him he would negate the eyes<br><br>the knife isn't a psychic power</br></br></br>  <br>The eyes are.<br><br>Being able to see lines itself is a psychic power. <br><br>For instance, if someone with X-ray vision were to look at Touma's hand, they wouldn't be able to see past the skin. That same concept applies here. <br><br>And Shiki can't interact with the lines of death if he can't see them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Shiki is still stronger and faster than Touma and could kill him even without using his MEoDP.  <br>Pretty much. A lot of Nasuverse characters are a bad match against Touma.<br><br>He should be able to beat Alba relatively easily, though. He's basically a more flamboyant Stiyl.</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually a hybrid power. His eyes had always psychic powers but after the accident it became a mystic eye too.</br>  Shiki wouldn't kill Touma's Imagine Breaker because the lack of lines around it would make Shiki think Touma's a Dark Aspotle and thus call Arcueid to deal with the problem. Then Arcueid would look at touma and tell shiki "what the fuck did you call me here for, this is not a Dark Apostle, you owe me food for weeks now for making me do this". The whole time Zelretch is laughing at them all.  <br>And? It's a supernatural power by nature. You think being a hybrid power somehow makes it less supernatural?</br>  <br>I was just correcting the terminology, nothing else.</br>  <br> IE cancels out any supernatural power <br> doesn't cancel itself out  <br>Supreme logic. <br><br> inb4 it has to touch an object to cancel it out <br>As if he never tried crossing his fingers or anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If shiki goes into Nanaya mode, then yes. If he's just plain ol' shiki, then probably not.  <br>Imagine Breaker resets things to normal values. Imagine Breaker is designed by whatever created it to be a part of the "normal world". Ergo, it can't cancel itself out. It's something that's always supposed to exist no matter what. Even if Touma died, it would simply move onto the next host.</br>  <br>What? Whether he's in Nanaya mode or not is irrelevant. He wouldn't be able to see lines on Touma's right hand.<br><br>And at any rate, it doesn't matter. Shiki doesn't have to go Nanaya to beat up Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>It's somehow a countermeasure to the world move into disorder, i.e. move from its origin. It won't be removed from the world and we don't know if it's magical or something else.<br><br>Also, it'd be stupid for such an ability to work on itself.</br></br></br>  <br>this sounds like bullshit, he's not using any ability to draw the lines on the hand<br><br>and the lines are by no means supernatural</br></br></br>  <br>The lines aren't supernatural, but Shiki's ability to see lines is.<br><br>Again, it's like the X-ray vision example. An X-ray vision user wouldn't be able to see past the flesh of Touma's hand. The hand itself is biologically normal, but as the X-ray vision user's power is inherently supernatural in nature, it'd be useless.</br></br></br>  <br>A lot of things that would be considered supernatural in Raildex are completely natural in the Nasuverse.<br><br>I'd be willing to bet that the MEoDP are not one of them, though.</br></br></br>  <br>He can't break through Touma's precog meaning he gets punched in the face and then Imagine Breaker breaks the red string of fate, adding Shiki's harem into his own.</br>  <br>Nope. Touma's precog isn't all that useful against martial artists. Shiki would run circles around him.<br><br>A trained US soldier was able to subdue him easily.</br></br></br>  Do we even really know what the mystic eyes are? <br>Maybe when he "died" something got triggered in his brain that allowed him to see the lines.</br>  <br>Aren't Shiki's reflexes superhuman? If so, neither of them would really be likely to hit the other one.</br>  <br>Shiki can.</br>  <br>When Shiki "died", his soul got connected to the Spiral of Origin. This opened up a channel in his brain and altered his Pure Eyes ability to allow him to see the lines of death.</br>  <br>Touma is a great street brawler. Shiki is a top tier assassin with superhuman physical skills.<br>They aren't on the same level, Shiki would easily subdue Touma in a fistfight.</br></br>  <br>She probably can't either. Even if you unmake the entire universe, Imagine Breaker would still exist in some form.</br>  Reminder that shiki would get killed by accelerator.  <br>She can just cut it's line from the Root then.</br>  <br>So is it a magical ability, or is it physical?</br>  <br>But that's wrong. It works fine against martial artists. It just doesn't work well against people who beat him in straight stats like Saints or Magic Gods or Guns. <br><br><br>Yeah probably. Given Rensa mentions Touma was already pre-emptively dodging before she even started her attack means they'd probably stalemate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither, it's just something that "happened" and is part of nature itself.</br>  <br>No, the Imagine Breaker would nullify his powers, but then his powers would destroy the Imagine Breaker, which in turn wuold nullify said powers, which...</br>  <br> Killing Plot armor  <br><br>Kek</br></br></br>  Shiki<br><br>is icky<br><br>he makes me feel sicky</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, a trained US Soldier was able to subdue him easily. The only reason he beat Tsuchimikado was because he was entirely worn out completely in both body and mind.</br>  <br>Shiki<br><br>Is hot<br><br>He makes me feel sticky</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Imagine Breaker itself seems to have always existed and will continue to exist. It apparently can take many forms and it is only for this current incarnation that it's taken the form of a right hand. Even Othinus doesn't seem to be able to destroy it, meaning it supersedes death, and considering it's a reference point for the verse, it most likely transcends existence itself. Shiki's mind will most likely explode from trying to find the lines and the dots for it.</br>  Shiki could just rape Touma.  <br>So IB is akin to the root?</br>  <br>Around Shikis, never relax.</br>  <br>Who knows, but at the very least, it transcends death and existence.</br>  <br> transcends existence <br><br>indexfags everyone</br></br></br>  <br>yes, if IB existed in the nasuverse it would be directly connected to the akashic records</br>  Since this is the only Type-Moon thread alive, does anyone know which of the Knights of the Round have Excaliburs and who can use the prana blast ability?<br><br><br>Probably this.<br><br><br>Isn't the reason Touma has precog is because he can sense the AIM fields? Shiki and that US soldier lacks AIM fields.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything in the Nasuverse is connected to the Akashic records.</br>  <br> Knights of the Round have Excaliburs <br>Lancelot has Unlimited TheftWorks.<br>All you need to know.</br></br></br>   people thinking shiki can't kill touma <br> people thinking death lines are supernatural <br><br>embarassing</br></br></br>  <br> Mystic Eyes of Death Perception <br> Mystic Eyes <br> Mystic <br> Eyes <br> Not supernatural </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you really going to make me dig for the scene where arc says that death lines are natural and implanted in literally everything</br>  <br> implying that the eyes aren't what's supernatural </br>  <br>Did you even pay attention?<br><br>The lines are natural. Shiki's ability to see them isn't. So the lines are there but Shiki can't see them on Touma's hand. Rest of him's fair game, though.</br></br></br>  Depends on which powers stands higher in the cosmic heriarchy of their respective verses.<br><br>Void Shiki's MEoDP can kill existence using the 'root' of the nasuverse which is an infinite multiverse.</br></br>  <br> implying shiki draws the lines </br>  <br>He SEES the line. The ability to SEE the lines is what's supernatural here.</br>  But can shiki throw hands though?  <br>His ability to see the lines is supernatural. Ryougi can't see through layered Bounded Fields, so there is no way Shiki could see through the effects of Imagine Breaker.</br>  <br> implying that's the implication </br>  It's worth noting that under sufficient circumstances, Imagine Breaker can erase entire realities if their values don't match up with the "Pure World", as seen when Othinus was its wielder. The only real reason we see the limitations we do is because Touma is unable or unwilling to push/train/test its limits outside of immediate danger situations.<br><br>Raildex is unlike any other shounen in that there aren't any real "test out your power in a controlled setting" scenes unless your name is Misaka Mikoto.</br></br>  <br>Anon, Imagine Breaker withstood multiple reality warping, as well as every single possible spell thrown at it. It is immune to fate and destiny, and is the backup data to the entire verse. It is the embodiment of wishes to be able to restore the verse back to what it originally was no matter how fubar it is. The infinite power of the multiversal reality warping Magic Gods couldn't do shit to it. Even when Othinus crushed the right hand with raw strength, it reformed right back. That shit better transcends existence.</br>  <br>shiki is a demon hunter he can wreck touma</br>  <br>Indexverse isn't even a multiverse.<br>So far the lore and the plot only indicates it's an universe with multiple layers of reality.<br>Nasuverse is an actual multiverse with several different timelines and canons so the concept of the root stands above IB.</br></br></br>  I wish Nasu would actually write some kind of Tsukihime 2-esque vn in which powerlevels are actually relevant (outside of servants) and new characters with new abilities are introduced.  <br>what do you mean by this? powerlevels are absolutely relevant in tsukihime considering shiki cut down arc's power level by quite a bit<br><br>and despite that she was literally unkillable under the moon</br></br></br>  <br> Imagine Breaker <br> A thing that can delete/remove any and all illusions of God <br> The series itself still exists, even though everything is an Illusion <br><br>meh</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Won't his brain explode just by trying to kill a Type, a planetary level power? Imagine Breaker is at least an universal level power, he's way out of his league.</br>  <br>Instead of spreading 'sideways' into alternate dimensions, they just go outward. Doesn't change the fact that they required to divide their infinite powers through infinite phases to not destroy the world when they want to talk to Touma. And Imagine Breaker denies all forms of time travelling, so if IB was in Nasuverse, an entire form of true magic would disappear.</br>  So, Shiki can see lines that allow an entity, any existence, to continue existing. If it's a human, it's the lines that control their life. If it's an ability, it's the lines that provide the person with the ability. He uses a butter knife to cut through them, and this allows him to find a way to kill literally anything--to make it nonexistent.<br><br>But how does he cut through the lines if his opponent just kills him in one hit? Sure, you could attempt to slice through the lines of Za Warudo, but if Dio stopped time, then you'd just die while you were incapable of moving. Even if you were able to cut the lines that allowed you to be frozen, you can't move, so that's impossible.<br><br>Why is Shiki, or any person with Mystic Eyes of Death Perception a dangerous opponent? Aren't they just normal highschoolers that have a better than average ability, but are otherwise weak and slow as fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doubtful. Imagine Breaker is the reference point for all things in the universe so it's unlikely Shiki could conceptualize it's death (if it holds any concept of death at all). Likewise it is hard to say if Imagine Breaker could nullify death perception since it's a byproduct of a connection to The Root and therefore not actually supernatural in nature. If the two settings existed in the same universe their abilities would likely come from the same place and be intrinsically interconnected.</br>  "..."  <br> ... <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey newfag, good to see you.<br><br>Let's see what ending he can pull out of his ass this time</br></br></br>  "O-Ow..."

He's an overrated hack of a middle aged man who is obsessed with adolescents turning lesbian.</br>  <br> Self-insert bait MC <br>You self insert as a powerless and near useless kid with PTSD?<br><br> epic <br>Thanks, and do everyone a favor and fuck off to your containment board. <br/></br></br></br></br></br>  Stupid harem shit with a lame ass MC.    <br>He's an eroge protagonist. The very medium is self-insert bait.</br>  <br> pic unrelated </br>  <br>Yeah, streaming is pretty bad.</br>    <br><br> powerless and near useless kid with PTSD? <br>Fucking fatefags i swear</br></br></br>  <br>don't forget god awful character designs</br>  <br> the rest of the medium is shit so this is shit too <br><br> I have no rebuttal so here's a reaction image <br>My folder is always growing, anon. Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot your shitty bait pic</br>    <br> the rest of the medium is shit so this is shit too <br>Well yeah. Its actually worse than light novels. The medium was made entirely so people can imagine themselves fucking 2d girls.</br></br>  <br>I was hoping you'd post one to help with my folder. It's a give and take and I sure as hell am not going to be doing all the giving.</br>  <br>other english only plebs.</br>  <br><br><br>That's pretty much the definition of old shit, actually.</br></br></br>  <br>But how does that make UBW shit by association? I'm not saying it's good. I'd give it a 4 maybe 5/10. But you're reasoning is pretty shit.</br>  <br>I should rewatch Yuri Kuma.</br>  <br> self-insert as a broken kid that makes a deal with the world to become a janitor for all eternity <br> not even a harem, either fuck a ghost, a girl that pleases old men for money, or a worm slut <br> gets carried in one route, gets battery charge from sex and still can't beat big bad in another, and getting mutilated from the inside by swords and can't beat the big bad without him falling on his face from running out of time and then self destructs when he destroys angry manjew in the climax <br><br>Did we read the same VN?<br> I bet you only just watched the animes did you? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read much visual novels that focus on story, so I can't really say Fate/Stay Night is good compared to them but its still the worst one I've read so far, even in Type-moon.<br>Yet every single one still involves the male MC getting to fuck his choice of several girls while you "play as him". Its still self-insert bait because its the nature of the medium.<br><br><br>Read the VN and dropped the anime midway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was better than  Penguindrum .</br>  <br>Despite the fanservicey bits, it was still better than most other shows that have come out this year.</br>    <br><br> self-insert as a broken kid that makes a deal with the world to become a janitor for all eternity <br><br>Shirou is literally Naruto?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fate is bad because the writing is bad and full of plot holes. Nasu tries to make this story by throwing in all kinds of themes and seeing where it all goes, which was kind of fun but all in all it was kinda bland half the time on my second playthrough. But it's still not a self-insert deal no matter how you look at it. Don't use memes and buzzwords to explain why something is bad because then newfags will start to think Fate is good and not just fun.</br>  <br><br> self insert as the kid that fucks Saber <br> self insert as the kid that fucks Rin <br> self insert as the kid that fucks Sakura </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the guy you're arguing with, but that's just you putting the pussy on a pedestal and completely ignoring the rest of the context.<br><br>Also, in Nasuverse, sex scenes are anything but erotic.</br></br></br>  <br>Flower of Thanatos is pretty fucking hot.</br>  <br>Honestly, I don't think its bad because its self-insert bait but for the reasons you posted.<br>However, the self-insert baiting is something that's wrong with the industry.<br>Shirou is more fleshed out than the usual eroge protag but as I said before, the mediun itself is self-insert bait and you can't really get away from that unless the MC is a girl and its not an Otome. Shiki was way more insane than Shirou was yet he didn't even have a face in the main game.</br></br></br>  What's with trashing on VN about its choosing to fuck girl aspect?<br><br>How is that somehow bad in comparison with boy saving the world story, or the boy doing anything right at all?</br></br>  This turned into a Fate thread fast.  <br>And what's so bad about that?<br><br>Are RPG bad because we have to create the main character?</br></br></br>  <br> good oneshot with comedy, romance, and a good over the top ending <br> serialization starts and it turns into a never ending harem </br></br>  <br>I hoped for a Yamato thread, especially when a S2 is announced for fall 2016</br>  <br>Its a very cheap way to lure people into playing/watching shit without actually having substance as a story. The amount of Shirou wanking in Fate is disgusting.</br>  <br>If it wanks on Shirou, then it's not self-insertion.<br><br>The point of self-insertion is to be a blank page so you can make the choices without feeling conflicted.</br></br></br>  Neptunia? Anyone?  DAL &gt; Neptunia  <br>Why are the imoutos so much better?</br>  Do you ever feel really sad after you finish an anime? Why does this happen?  I feel proud.   Do you ever feel really sad after you finish an anime?  <br>Not really, unless it ended on a very sad note.<br><br> Why does this happen? <br>I assume the reason I feel sad then is because something sad happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just finished NGE for the first time and I feel terrible. I didn't even like it all that much, I thought.</br>  Only when I marathon shit.  Yes.<br>I guess it's attachment to the setting or characters.</br>  <br>Is there any other way? <br><br><br>Its like a happy sad. Like you had a good time and you're sad that its over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you spent the last x hours of your life getting attached to the characters and feeling all sorts of emotions, then when it finally ends, you don't know where the fuck to go from there</br>  <br>Weird how something fake can do that</br>  <br>When I marathon stuff, by the end I'm too tired to feel sad.<br>When it's drawn out over weeks or even years is when I feel like the characters have been with me long enough to feel bad over their situations.</br></br>  <br>You'll understand the feeling in a few years.</br>  Yup, if it drew me in then I feel kind of melancholy <br><br>I eventually get over it and move on to another show</br></br>  <br><br>For me it's because I know my life will never be as interesting as the shit I watch.</br></br>  I already cried going through the second season of K-ON for the first time and I didn't even finish it yet. I know I'm going to cry on the last episode. I guess it's because I don't want it to end knowing there's no season three to come after.<br><br>  Call me a faggot if you want  </br></br>  <br>What do you mean?</br>  <br>This is how it was for me after I finished FLCL. I just wanted to move somewhere and meet interesting people, but no I continue to sit my room and do the same thing everyday meeting no one knew or experiencing new things.</br>    Only if it feels like the story or subplots were left unresolved or didn't conclude in a satisfying way. If it all ends and you say "What? That's it?", its really disheartening, usually because you were invested in the characters and the conclusion was unsatisfying. If an anime ends in the right way, it feels like all the pieces fell right into place to make something beautiful, and I just want to smile and keep smiling. Not everything has to have a happy or perfect ending, but a good ending should always leave a feeling of satisfaction at least.  They'll continue in their narrative. Their story doesn't end just because you can't see it anymore.<br><br>Everything you came to love or hate, every tiny detail that could be drawn out and animated remains. They'll grow old and the world will change, but you're no longer given access to see it.<br><br>I think it'd be nice if there were a series that started and just never stopped. Same characters every week going through their lives in real time. It'd be interesting to watch it across a century and how it impacts its readers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand ASKA.</br>  When a very good Anime ends. I cry like shit, cause I will only watch once.  <br>Hell yeah, I wish that would happen. Then my whole life will be full of feel trips.</br>  Some shows I dread the end of so much that the end of each episode hurts.  <br>Sitcoms do that. Not as long as you'd say, but pretty long regardless.<br>Closest equivalent to what you said in anime would be Sazae-san, but it's not real-time.</br></br>   The opening is shit and doesn't get changed throughout the whole anime    HACK IN TO THE GATE   <br>Whoa anon, that's some shitty opinion you have!</br>  <br> OPEN THE EYES </br>   The opening is shit and gets changed to a another one that's just as shit    KILL ME BABY!!!   <br>Fucking Parasyte and Bakuman<br><br><br>Kill urself my man</br></br></br></br>  Nodame Cantabile got it right the third time though.

I want him to star finger inside me. I love Star Platinum so much. I want him to ram his gigantic fist up my ass. I want his gigantic arms around me. Star Platinum is the most amazing stand ever created. I wish to have sexual intercourse with him. Star Platinum is more beautiful that women to me, Star Platinum is more inspiring than men to me. Star Platinum is wonderful. My emotions toward Star Platinum are stronger than one thousand projectile-vomit powered boats. My love for Star Platinum is stronger than Pucci's gravitational force. Star Platinum should be the new mascot of the whole series. Star Platinum should be the new mascot for Shonen Jump. Star Platinum is the most beautiful stand and it should be law that every stand user has him, even Tsurugi Higashikata. <br><br>I want Star Platinum to METEOR FINGER my ass, I want him to Time Stop inside me, I want to feel his A rank precision, I want him to peruse my ass, I want him to mMeteor Finger Thorn my back, I want him to Ora Ora me.

Nice warm feel.</br>  <br>Part 4 reminds me of life in my home town. Of my high school friends and youth.</br>  <br>When did he underestimate her? I honestly don't remember , I do remember when Donatello was underestimating her and Pucci told him it was a mistake. A lot if time Jolynes gang hand a advantage over Pucci but Fate was always on his side.</br>  <br> When did he underestimate her? <br>I dont remember which chapter but he berates himself for not killing Jolyne after getting Jotaro's memories</br></br>  <br> Crazy Dimond <br> Jonathan the esplorer <br> Polly and Kujo zefu </br></br></br>  <br>I think you know what you're talking about but I'd have to reread to be sure. Was pucci always planning on killing the kujos or did he just decide after they caused him so much trouble. He was using jolyne to get to Jotaro at first so he probably only saw her as a tool and he took out Jotaro. Other then that the only time I can say he fucked up is by deactivated MiH to finish off Emporio and reactivating it in ghost room with all the oxygen. He was so close to winning.</br>  <br>I don't think he ever planned on killing them until Kennedy space center, actually. Even that memory thing he left in Donatello just told her to go spend time with her family and not to follow him. He was always more focused on heaven than the Joestars.</br>  <br>Tomatoes were broken and pasta was boiled to make that spaghetti among other things. Pucci's foot was always like that from the beginning. There's nothing to restore.</br>   JoJo no Thread <br>I can't believe I started a new meme</br>  Is Giorno truly invincible?
