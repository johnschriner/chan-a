[ It's here folks, get it while it's hot   No more amagi. <br><br>Well, time to kill myself.<br><br>Bye guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Be happy with your sento </br>  The hurt of this being over would lessen if they release the series on BD in the UK (I like having the physical media). But they never will. We don't even have Hyouka in the West.  <br>The UK doesn't have as many weebs as the rest of Europe, you can't really blame publishers for ignoring it.</br>  <br>The UK does get anime, but it's shounen garbage. The UK usually gets cheaper second-hand licences from America or Australia, but I don't think they have the rights to Amagi or Hyouka yet. Does KyoAni not like money or something?</br>  2 and a half hours left.  <br>The week after next week is Yuya vs Jack which starts off the Friendship Cup Arc. Next week is Yuya, Gong, and Shun vs Security who plays the Goyo Series boss monster that is more boss than Guardian.</br>  <br>64 is when Jack makes his appearance.</br>  <br>Jean-Mi' really needs a good injection of egao. If it keeps up his face is going to get stuck in too-old-for-this-shit mode.<br><br>Also goddamnit Yugo didn't they teach you anything in that orphanage of yours</br></br></br>  I was thinking as why Kaito posses card like this <br> Kaito explains that "Galaxy-Eyes" is his monster, and asks Hishakaku if he thinks he wouldn't have a plan in case it got stolen. Kaito tells "Galaxy-Eyes" that he would rather destroy him than watch it leave his hand and humiliate itself <br>He is a Kaiba.</br></br>  <br> Hair down Yuzu First time <br> In front of Yugo <br><br>Top kek the NTR is real</br></br></br></br>   [ron] Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid 01-12 (BATCH) <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05040<br><br>Bring on season 2.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Originally a loli</br>  <br>Everybody was "originally" a loli.</br>  <br>No I mean, isn't she doing age progression instead of regression? I don't recall any firm statement either way.</br>  I'm very sad they cut out all the parts with Nanoha and Fate on the sidelines.    I was gone for almost two months on medical reasons and I lost pretty much all of Born. Just got it downloaded from episodes 5 onwards and im going to watch it now, but im a bit surprised. No specials or ovas? or am i looking for them wrong?    <br>Now for not ants</br>  Worst show this season.  Who has the tightest pussy among the DxD?<br> Not Kuroka for sure. </br>  <br>Still best tho</br>   Part two of a series has a different MC and he's shit    part two of the series has a different MC and   she's a girl   <br>Are you talking about Mondaiji?</br>  <br>No on about cavalier of abyss.<br><br>But fuck momdaiji gets a new MC?</br></br></br>  I dunno, OP, Raiden isn't nearly as cool as Snake but he's still a decent character.  <br>Not him but, after a three years timeskip izayois adoptive brother gets summoned and becomes a split MC.</br>  Is Momo-chan's power completely unique?  <br>That's because the plot is driven by an entity that is completely in the shadows. It's present in every scene influencing things.</br>  How would Mekaku work if it doesn't have backstories?  <br>It wouldn't. Just about everything explained so far has been told through backstories. The current events merely tell of the groups struggle to defeat snake-kun.</br>  <br>Not much aside from the fact that decent English translations of the LNs are starting to roll out.<br><br> I still need to read my copy of the first volume. Been sitting on my bookshelf for weeks now. </br></br></br>  Why is it so annoying to find a full album of the songs?  What does Rei like?  <br>He wouldn't be fucking his mom. In fact, he'd be fucking something more unlike his mom than any other human. Fucking Rei would be the least incestuous thing he could do with a humanoid, biologically. It'd be no more incestuous than fucking a dog.</br>  <br>Im not buying it anon also asuka best girl</br>  <br>There's nothing to buy. Rei shares less DNA with Yui than Asuka does. She's part angel. Asuka is 100% human. So, sex with Asuka would be more incestuous than sex with Rei.<br><br>I can't think of a simpler way to explain it.</br></br></br>  <br>Having fat tits.</br>  Being best girl.  Very funny, Commie...   vlc   <br>What am I supposed to be looking at here?</br>  <br>His head.</br>  <br>Commie and OP being stupid faggots. Nothing new.</br>  It's all over the opening, wtf<br>Fuck them, it's the reason why they were fucking slow in this ep. Doing unneeded shit</br>  When did you realize that Yui was best girl Anon?  Sensei still best girl.  <br>Well, that's it. We're never getting any vol 11 translation except from some Irohafags and brief summary from Yuifags.</br>  <br> Lelouch <br> Mistaking character intention <br><br>Why am i no surprise about it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh, I bet that was good to get out of your system, hhmmm</br>  <br> Why am i no surprise <br>Too deep</br></br>   [orz] SHOW BY ROCK!! 12 [B2D7044C].mkv   I wanted k-on, and it just turned into furries.  The events are great for amassing melodisians but holy shit do the songs get old after a while.  <br>It helps if you love MariMari.</br>  <br>No, I don't understand.</br>  <br>I would a Fennely.</br>  Why are we still using raster image formats instead of vector ones for manga? <br><br>It's silly to view a 1000x1600 image on a 4k or even a 2560x1440 monitor.</br></br>  <br>SE Manga</br>  <br> vector <br> manga <br>you've never drawn a pic in your life, have you?</br></br></br>  <br>Please don't spoonfeed people who can't read.</br>    <br> searching a thumbnail <br>Humanity never ceases to be inspiring.</br></br>  The copy of archer we see in UBW "dies" as he smiles at Rin in the sunset. <br>As in his memories, feelings, and revelations during his fight with Shirou will be erased. <br><br>Counter guardians exist out of time/space and the original copy of Archer there will forever keep killing in an endless cycle resenting himself and hoping for a chance to kill his younger self(it's the same reason he forgot his "ideals", his feelings, and his memories from childhood before seeing them in Shirou again)<br><br>Copies don't get sent back to the CG throne of heroes.<br><br>But at least that one copy of archer in UBW got his answer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you're a retard?</br>  <br> prior <br>No</br></br>  <br>Prior. During. After. <br>It has already happened. And an infinite number of times at that.</br></br>  <br>Go to bed Zelretch</br>  <br><br>Look, the whole goddamn thing is pointless anyway. Archer's temper tantrum isn't going to work - Even if he kills Shirou, he's not going to free himself. He's already sold his soul, he's not going to get a takeback. (Really, he's a Xerox of the original character.)<br><br>The whole point of UBW is "Somehow, things are going to turn out okay."</br></br></br></br>  Make /a/ mad.<br><br>I'll start.</br></br>  What hurts isn't the NTR. What hurts is that she really started falling in love with MC and ruined it for herself.  <br>Found the manlet.<br><br>Hello, little guy.</br></br></br>  At least it makes me sad  ;_;   Can't believe this isnt posted yet.  <br>You can post every page of this manga and each panel would be rage inducing <br><br>Sister a slut.</br></br></br>   No ZR <br> No twintails <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>    <br>her eyes are too apart.</br>  <br>So you're saying the only thing that was cut was some luvia exposition?<br><br>Fuck that, give me some London SOL</br></br></br>  <br>The drama CD that's coming out with the BDs is confirmed to essentially be just that.</br>   memefetish waifufags getting BTFO when their girl is redesigned into a proper woman   I've finally read Part 4 and I have to say it was really fucking good. Seriously why was it so fucking good? I mean the fact it had lots of sol shenanigans was so good. Also it felt fresh that Main Villain wasn't a guy that wanted to take over the world but one that just wanted a peaceful life. Kira was a goddamn amazing Villain. I don't know why people think Dio is great Villain when you have a character like Kira who was clever, cunning, and intelligent as fuck. He felt more complex than Dio could ever be. The Stands were far more creative and dangerous than Part 3 too. Part 4 was so much better than Part 3.<br><br>I really want David Productions to animate the Italian Restaurant arc so bad now. Delicious animated Italian food.</br></br>  How did Kira even know what Bites the Dust could do if he can't remember anything about the loop? How did he even discover it? Did the arrow give him an instruction booklet or something?  The sol parts of Part 4 killed it for me. I mean if I want to read slice of life I read something like Bonnouji and if I want some le delinquent action I read something like Crows. <br>The balance between sol and stand action was so fucking ruined in DwK. Those who unironically liked it, I am sorry for your shit taste.</br>  <br>You mean Josuke.</br>  <br> reading it for autism: the jojo </br>  <br>Because Araki is awesome and refused many adaptations since they were doing a shitty job. You wanted JoJo adapted by Toei or Pierrot?</br></blockquote>]
