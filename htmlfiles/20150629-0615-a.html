[ So I always used to laugh at those "what the fuck did I just watch" eva threads, because I got it at first watch when I was a teen.<br><br>But today I finally watched the 3.0 Rebuild and now my mind is full of whys.<br><br>So, EVA thread, I guess</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3.0 <br>Are you retarded?<br><br>You should have watched 3:33.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks for the bump, I guess</br>  <br>Look up sage.</br>  It was like a two-hour version of episode 24. With extra Kaworu and Shinji just in case you didn't catch how gay it was the first time around.  <br>what was up with the spears tho?<br><br>and why didn't shinki stop? anta baka?</br></br></br>    <br>what's the middle one</br>  <br>The Next Episode trailer from the end of 2.22</br>  misato is the best girl  <br>I'm pretty sure he watched 3.33 but is too dumb to write the correct number. 3.0 was theater-only  with all the horrendous absolutely disgusting cgi </br>  <br>in between all the 'what the fuck is going on' moments.<br><br>the one moment that truly left my mouth open was all the extreme chin shapes<br><br>belongs 100% in 'Quality' threads</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=are<wbr>JdopJL_c</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Kaworu's is still the best</br>  We don't know jack, Shinji is our perspective and all of Shinji's lines can be replaced with "what" screamed with various inflections. The hope for people still stupid enough to have faith is that the last movie adds context to identify stuff hid in 3.33.  Minami should of won<br><br>what the fuck was this bullshit siscon ending</br></br>  <br>Manami a shit.</br>  Minami is a cunt.  <br> Manami punched a shit <br>Fixed.</br></br>  This whole anime was shit but people just won't let it fade into obscurity.<br><br> sage </br></br>  <br><br> Shit punched shit. <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just finished marathoning season 1 and 2 after realizing Manami was voiced by my favorite VA<br><br>kirino was such a bull cunt in season 1</br></br></br>  <br/>  Man-am-i shit  <br> should of </br>  <br> Kissanime </br>  <br>this MC was a giant faggot with his faggot haircut and faggot yelling about loving his abusive, shitty, bitch sister</br>  This is the true end  Akimi Sakurai best oreimo.  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Yes please. Kirino a literal best, objectively speaking. To be fair, though, the only bad girl in the series was Manami.</br>  <br>someone has creepy, disgusting, indecent-in-public tastes<br><br>Like seriously I hate it enough when tsunderes get any affection from the mc, but for the bitchdere to be his sister too and he still chooses her over everyone else?<br><br>Why was that ending even allowed? Kuroneko, Ayase, and Manami tears had to fall. Their smiles left unprotected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Translating into a made-up alien alphabet <br>I hate this meme.</br></br>  Is there any consolation to this super terrible sister ending?  <br>You didn't even get her name right you dingus</br>  <br>I have dyslexia</br>  Why would someone so obviously against incest watch a show called My Little Sister Can't be this Cute?  <br>I was rooting for her all through season 1!!<br>until he dated kuroneko...but then she dump him then I was back to rooting for her all through season 2!!</br></br>  <br>Her presence in S2 was pretty fucking minimal. You could tell by that alone that there wasn't going to be a Manami ending.</br>  <br>Fuck Manami. She a cunt. I'm sad for the others, though. Kuroneko a cute. Kirino was just more important to him. Rightfully so, too.</br>  <br>It actually hurt to see Kuroneko screaming in anguish. Her rejection was by far the worst.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EA2<wbr>mKbl_L5k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Literally the only thing Manami did wrong was having morality in a show that pandered incest.</br>  <br>it wasn't adapted in the Anime and non-LN fags never knew they got together in the first place</br>  <br>I know. She loved him. Made me sad.</br>  <br>But her ship sank for the sake of a relationship that the producers didn't even have the balls to go all the way with. A shame. By the end, I actually liked Kuroneko</br>  <br>Never even bothered with the garbage, but why the fuck are people this assblasted over a siscon ending of a series called: MY LITTLE SISTER CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THIS CUTE?</br>  <br>Yeah, I wish the plot twist never happened. Felt like they just said loljk the whole point of the show was a meme xD. I don't dislike the way it ended, but I would feel happier if they kept with it. <br>I just can't say no to a qt3.14 that buys her brother a minifridge and an eroge as housewarming gifts. Literal perfection. That level of trust that they had makes me feel warm inside.</br></br>  <br>my nigga</br>  <br>Because they made the sister an unlikable bitch, and every other girl introduced was better than her in every way</br>  <br>I know that OreImo was dealing with the whole incest thing in a more mature way than Yosuga No Sora, but I kind of want to see what would happen if Kirino and Kyousuke pulled the same shit, and ran away after Kirino graduates from high school. I'm sure Kirino would have enough of a nest egg at this point to set them up for a while, at least long enough to find employment</br>  <br>The anime butchered her personality, she was a much more likeable character in the LN</br>  <br>Literally only good for doujins.</br>   no one remembers Dutchguy   <br>That's what I was hoping for. They don't need society telling them who they can't love. They were deeper than that. I felt so many feels when she said yes. How can you watch that scene and not want them to do what makes them happy?</br>  <br>Manami will get over it and marry me!</br>  <br>No one WANTS to remember dutchfag. Don't mention his name, he might show up.<br><br>But it's a reality we will never see, unfortunately. <br> Imagine a crossover </br></br></br></br>        <br> I won, eat shit normalfag <br> I don't have any more gifs of the fight, BUT I DO HAVE THIS <br> A really shitty webm <br> Oh god why did I save this </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayase should have won.<br>Fixed</br></br>  <br>Nigga, incest is my shit.</br>  Did someone say Kirino thread?  <br>I dont get why a rips on kissanime. It's pretty convienient.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the content of the webm, i'm talking about the quality of the webm.<br>That scene is probably my favorite in the entire series, but i have a shitty webm of it.</br></br>  <br>Would Kyousuke and Kirino canonically make babies?</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Is Yosuga worth a watch? I'm a shitter when it comes to starting new shows. I'm amazed I manage to watch anime at all.</br>  <br>Unlike Haru and Sora, they have a good chance that their kids won't be fucked, gene wise. So i can assume they tried.</br>  <br>Watch it and read the VN. They're different enough to consume both.</br>  <br>You're absolutely right.</br>  <br>The healing will begin when you accept her victory.</br>  <br>It wastes time for the first 8 or so episodes with "what if" arcs with other girls, and the incest is pretty rushed, but it's overall a great watch, and has some fantastic fucking music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HnV<wbr>NYIyE2hs</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EFE<wbr>R3VRV27A</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lJh<wbr>i8tX-RP4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>explain</br>  <br>I like being butthurt. Bitching about shit is more fun.</br>  <br>Haru and Sora are twins, so if they tried for kids, there is a pretty high chance they would come out with some kind of deformity<br>Kyosuke and Kirino are merely siblings, so the chance for deformities is fairly slim.</br></br>   tfw not an incestfag and still liked oreimo <br>Kirino best girl.</br>  <br><br>Thanks p/a/ls. What about the OreImo LN/VNs? I only watched the show because Kirino is everywhere.</br></br>  <br>I can't say I blame you. It is more fun to talk about things you hate sometimes.</br>  <br>Kirino on being the best girl.</br>    <br>The Oreimo anime is butchered badly, the LN is a lot better.</br>  <br> English <br> you <br>Also no.</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about the VN, but i really enjoyed the LN. I'm currently doing the PSP one for shits and giggles, but i know about the whole twist on Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship, so i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</br>  <br>I like how she warms up to the idea of Haru and Sora going out it in the VN.</br>  <br>Sisters should always be devoted and loyal.<br>Best sisters are best.</br></br>  <br> should of <br>Fucking Americans, when will you fucks learn to English?</br></br>  <br>It's true, the what if arcs are pretty wasteful, especially considering none of the other female characters are particularly engaging.<br><br>I don't understand why they left that little town though. Everyone found out about and agreed not to discuss the relationship. They could have lived in that house, and spent their days together in quiet peace. Honestly, when I think on it, that town was probably the most Zen place I've ever seen depicted.<br><br>But no, let's travel to a foreign country where we don't speak the language and try to start up there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It truly is, now if you excuse me I gonna go to a raildex thread and call Touma a faggot some more. Good day.</br>  <br>Read the LNs.</br>  <br>VN it is implied they'll go back and I hear in the extension of their route they might try to open their family's business back up.</br>  <br>It would have made any interactions with their friends unbelievably akward, and they probably didn't want to hurt them any more than they had. Look at how Kozue reacted. Who's to say someone wouldn't be even more radical in their reaction, tell someone, and that would force Haru and Sora apart?</br>  You think all incest stories have a happy ending? Go read Kana Imouto, you happy fuckers. See if you're still smiling by the end of that<br> My heart still hurts </br>  All endings are shit endings. Things must not stand still.  <br>Anime haru was better than VN haru.</br>  <br>how long is it</br>  <br> Implying it was an American <br>Thou art not worth of this thread  faggot. <br><br><br>I remember reading the first volume and became a Kirino fag before the anime and all that shit.<br><br>I didn't pay attention to the incest thing, just liked them as a couple. Kuroneko too, but she lost my support when she broke up with Kyousuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the issue with KA?<br><br>It's got a mobile site with direct html video links, there isn't much not to like</br></br></br>  <br>About 8-10 hours or so. And it's nothing but pain, pain, less pain, and more pain.</br>  <br>That's good to hear. I think in time, the village would rationalise it as coping with the grief of the loss of their family.</br>  <br>wish me luck</br>  <br>Is there more Manami-chan in the LNs? Not giving her an arc in s2 was an unforgivable crime</br>  <br>You will be feeling the pain for a LONG time afterwards, anon. But godspeed.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks. May you all be blessed with kawaii DTF imoutos in your next life.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I am asking.</br>  <br>I always felt a little sorry for the other chick in that VN. Even if she drunked you up and sorta kinda raped you </br>  <br>The anime was not that far from the LNs though. You are not missing much about Manami anyways.</br>  <br>I didn't have time for Yumi, i was too busy  making sure Kana didn't suffer </br>  <br>Hopefully one that will run away with me</br>  <br>Oh, I didn't realize it was a visual novel</br>  <br>Yep. Fun fact time, it was also my FIRST VN ever. Fucking hell of a place to start</br>  <br>Damn right.</br>  <br>Manami is the Squealer of Oreimo.</br>  <br>Japan is too fucking good at piano</br>  <br>Squealer was doing everything right until he lost the war against those inhumane psychics that should all burn in hell</br>  <br>You say that like it's a bad thing<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Hfr<wbr>jSHd3wgo</wbr>  [ ]<br>But seriously, the entire YNS soundtrack is fucking god tier</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that one bgm from the VN that plays when Sora walks out barely clothed much to Haru's horror.</br>  <br>My favorite is probably the one from the anime, where Haru watches Sora masturbating while calling his name. It drove me fucking insane trying to find it.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EFE<wbr>R3VRV27A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  how easy is it to blow a load to kio kaze as compared to.. oreimo?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eq0<wbr>Tiuix3tY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The start menu theme from VN is nice too.</br></br></br>  Only retards like Kirino  <br>What do you mean, blow a load? Koi Kaze is a lot cuter than oreimo, and has a better ending, if you ask me?<br> Plus the fact that the doujin's are canon, that is something i like. I actually think they were done by the mangaka, if memory serves me right </br></br>  <br>4th from the top.</br>  I think Kirino would have been better as a yandere in the anime. Would have fit, given how abusive she was.  <br>third chapter never.  I still want to hurry up and waste that stardust one out of my mouth by finishing it too </br>  HN5 when?  <br>Win what?<br>A retarded moron called Kyousuke?<br><br>Perhaps if you hate Manami.<br><br>In fact both MC were awful, they deserved each other and now the other girls are free.<br><br>I hated when the author ass pulled Ayase falling for douchebag mc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of want a sequel to pic related. I assume that they pulled a YNS and ran away, but one can't be sure</br>  <br>They're dead Jim.</br>  <br>Was wondering when someone would say it.</br>  <br>When was death brought up? Stop speaking memes and talk sense, fool.</br>  <br>Note how how her popularity fell since 2013 to 2014 and '15.</br>  <br> inb4 2deep4u <br>Lurk more newfag.</br></br>  <br>Oh, the whole Black Lagoon thing. <br>Whatever</br></br>  <br>Getting hit in the glasses and having the frame dig into your face hurts like hell, I almost feel sorry for her.<br><br> Almost </br></br></br>  <br>Seems like getting 2d girls to love you doesn't take much.<br><br>I'd be swimming in pussy in that world</br></br></br>  <br>As a nearsightedfag, i have to agree. never had the misfortune to have the lens shatter, thank god. Man, Manami must have been in anguish afterwards, picking glass out of her face. And Kirino, probably picking glass out of her fist.<br> But only one had Kyosuke to help her </br></br>  <br><br>At least Manami-chan is going to the same college. Maybe they'll share a dorm and "accidentally" do lewd things to each other.<br><br>Like the good old falling over the girl and having one hand land on her breast</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2013  <br> glass lenses </br></br>  <br>I like it, but i can't unhear the moaning.</br>  <br>I don't think Manami want's anything to do with Kyosuke after how what he did. Any interactions, if any, were probably cold as hell<br><br>I'm sorry for being a poorfag, and being too lazy to get contacts.</br></br></br>  <br> weight <br> reach <br> experience <br> development <br>Yeah, this fight was a mismatch</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do they still even make glass lenses? I've been using plastic for what, 7 years already.<br> Don't get contacts please </br></br>  <br> But hearing her squeaks of pleasure is the best part! <br> Seriously. Lewd as the scene was, for some reason Sora was just even cuter than she usually was, quietly squeaking her brothers name </br></br>  <br>Companies have mostly stopped using glass for corrective lens for a while now. More than likely your lenses are going to be plastic, polycarbonate, or other similar materials. Those don't shatter the same way glass does.</br>  <br>Mine are glass, and they fucking suck to clean, unless I remove them from the frame. And god help me if it gets scratched</br>  Post Ayase's feet  <br>she must be a scat fetishist then</br>  <br>Nah, both of my pairs are glass. Someone hit me full in the face, and shattered them, and it fucking hurts, getting small glass shards in your face</br>  <br> Stop. My dick can't take any more. </br>  I wanted Ayase to cuff kyouske to her bed and force herself upon him  <br>Where the hell are you even from, did you not change your pair for years?</br>  <br> Man, that little minx just couldn't get enough of her brother's cock. I wonder how many times they did it before Not-Manami and the QT class pres caught them in the act? Do you think they continued afterwards? Give how Sora was all "Look at me, Haru. Only ever look at me", i think he would have had to fight her off. </br>  <br> I've been on the same 2 pairs for almost 8 years now. </br>  <br> If nothing else, at least it means your vision isn't getting worse. </br>  <br><br>Thread almost ruined. Only way it could possibly get worse is if Dutch showed up.</br></br>  <br>this is an imouto thread of course it's also a kirino thread</br>  <br>I love imouto threads. They draw all kinds of people in.<br>I remember that one anon who had practically raised his sister, since their parents were shit, and something about her getting in a car accident and telling him how much she loved him</br></br>  <br> all that unprotected sibling sex <br><br>too lewd</br></br></br>  <br> stoooooooppppp </br>  <br>Haru must have fought to keep her satisfied. it's a possibility that she was entirely Haru-sexual, and never even entertained the thought of going to another man for sex, but it's also a possibility that Haru just fucked her brains out every opportunity he got, so he didn't lose her.<br>Oh, the doujins write themselves. Too bad they don't draw themselves, too</br></br>  <br>That's one of my favorites.</br>  <br>All imouto threads are Kirino threads but not all Kirino threads are imouto threads.</br>  <br>Yes, she appears much more often. Everything is better in the LNs, and the anime butchers the most important plot elements. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</br>  <br>It's definitely one of the best oreimo doujins. Best ending, too, none of this "My Father and Little Sister"/"200 Day War" shit<br>A proper, adorable ending, for an adorable fucking doujin</br></br>  <br>You're right   and wrong since the LNs give her a different motive </br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  <br>I've never seen the show and am more than content just saving cute pics and doujins, but have often wondered what was the cause of this scene. <br>Is it safe to assume that Kirino was being a cunt?</br></br>  <br>Kirino and Kyousuke tell Kyousuke's childhood friend about their relationship, Kirino and said childhood friend get in a fist fight over it, Kirino wins, as always</br>  <br>Kirino bragging to Manami that Kyousuke loves her even though they're siblings. To be fair, she was holding it in for a few years.</br>  <br>Manami gets full on butthurt and unleashes it.</br>  <br><br><br>Why were they punching each other?</br></br></br>  <br>Minami is a jealous bitch.</br>  <br>It's justified, but i almost believe Kirino deserved some kind of comuppance. She really was up in Manami's face about, literally.</br>  <br><br>Manami gets rejected, isn't willing to accept that her childhood friend will be happy with someone else, lashes out.</br></br>  <br>Because Manami is butthurt about losing, and Kirino is rubbing it in. Manami punches Kirino, Kirino punches Manami, both accidentally punch Kyosuke when he tries to break it up</br>  <br><br>Thanks, anons.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Cold-blooded, man. Glad I got to Number2's stories before knowing about this.</br></br></br></br></br>  Manami was the only sane and pure girl for kyouske <br><br>Everyone else had some sort of fetish and mental illness</br></br>  <br>Adorable.</br>  <br>Pure? She warps Kirino's tender young mind, and then orchestrates Kyosuke's fall into mediocrity. She was just as twisted and fucked in the head as the rest of them.<br>If anything, Kuroneko is the only truly normal one. Sure, she's chuuni as fuck, but otherwise she's normal</br></br>  <br>Did he ever continue?<br>Tell me.<br>PLEASE.</br></br></br>  <br> fetish and mental illness <br><br>That's real life man. I've seen the way my friends sisters act around them, it's not a stretch to think siblings can love each other.</br></br></br>  <br>I KNOW RIGHT</br>  <br>I don't think so. Kind of sad, I would have loved to see what happened.</br>  <br><br>Probably go caught up in real life now, like OHB. I certainly don't think I'd be here as often if there were someone I cared about.<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>I keep hearing OHB referenced. What/who is it?</br>  <br>You're overreacting, so as that picture. She just tells Kirino that incest is bad and Kyosuke to calm the fuck down because he might hurt somebody if he's not careful. He grew up of course he wasn't going to be the same genki #YOLO kid forever. Manami didn't mold him to be some kind of dependable and boring loner like most Kirinofags make believe. He had friends and everything.<br><br>What's funny is that Kirino looked up to the hyper Kyosuke, but that personality never comes back, even at the end of the series he's still the same person Manami "molded" him to be.</br></br></br>  <br>He's  lurk more before you post again and embarass yourself by asking dumb questions, newfag </br>  <br> Pic related </br>  <br><br>I'm fucking kidding, relax</br></br>  <br> not all Kirino threads are imouto threads. <br>yes they are</br></br>   should of <br><br>Minamifags everyone.</br></br>  <br> same person Manami "molded" him to be. <br>Did we watch/read the same thing? The whole series is Kyousuke doing extraordinary things for his sister and others, which is exactly what Manami's molding intended to stop. <br><br>The end is no exception, where he kisses Kirino despite the more responsible option being letting their relationship go.<br><br>You have to be completely blind to Kyousuke's character arc to suggest such bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Much as i understand where you're coming from<br> minamifags everyone <br> minamifags <br> MINAMI <br><br>Oh my god, FUCK YOUR STREET SIGNS, CAPTCH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both that image and your post are wrong.<br><br> Manami didn't mold him to be some kind of dependable and boring loner <br><br>She actually did. Part of her motivation was to protect him from himself, and in that she was right, but she also used the opportunity to influence him towards the low achieving lifestyle that she believed was superior and that she wanted him to have, so that (hopefully) he would fall in love with her.<br><br> that personality never comes back <br><br>It comes back to some degree. I don't know how you could believe it never comes back at all, Kyousuke literally says it right in the text. It sounds like you're explaining things based off of a few LN quotes and what you've read on /a/. Super Kyousuke is more of an on and off thing after his character development finalizes, where he learns to control his ambition and find a balance between being safe and normal, but still being passionate and fiery about what he cares about.<br><br>The point of Manami and Kirino's fight was to show how childish their grudge was, and how wrong both of their idealizations were. Both of them wanted different extremes of Kyousuke, but only Kirino was accepting of end-story Kyousuke as a person because, as she learned more about him when they grew closer, she realized he's just a human being, not the perfect guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kuroneko a shit. Worse than Manami.   like Manami the most out of the Oreimo girls <br> didn't want her to win <br>I just don't know man.</br></br>  <br>Dude knocked up his Imouto at least.</br>  <br>Not really. I think there's an anon recently trying to make that happen but nope. There have been a lot of Kirino threads that are simply Kirino threads.</br>  <br><br> Extraordinary things <br><br>He was a kid, a fucking kid. Saying Manami is the sole reason why he's not as proactive as he used to be as a fucking toddler is dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't even what I was arguing, I suggest you reread my post. <br><br>His actions during the series indicate his reckless genki attitude very much did return, while you claimed he was the same person Manami molded.</br></br></br>    <br> 3D <br><br>You need to leave</br></br></br>  <br> white <br><br>Yeah okay get out.</br></br></br>  post lewd Kirinos <br>only they can save this thread</br>  <br> amifitinginyet xD </br>  <br>Sounds more like you than him. Lurk more.</br>  <br> Try to manipulate people and feelings from the sidelines <br> When that fails, resort to physical violence <br><br>Psycho bitch</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh you pathetic little summerfag. If you were a regular, you'd know the loophole being invoked here.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off and learn English.</br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br>/a/ doesn't take kindly to normies<br><br>That being said though she is very beautiful, would marry if she would have me.</br></br></br>  <br>Only because you reminded me of the story, Summer. <br><br>Oral Hygiene Bro, according to the stories, followed /a/'s prompting on a "y'all do this" thread and made something magical.</br></br></br>  <br>the first 'real' face i've seen in weeks<br><br>.. i feel sick</br></br></br>  <br>delete this</br>  <br>That's actually very cute for a 3D woman.</br>  <br>I hate minami, but that second bubble makes her sound like a legit retard. Yes, I know there are people who actually speak like that, and they are also legitimately retarded. <br><br>This is why I don't read translations in Thai, fuck "speech" Thai is retarded, and "formal" Thai is awkward.</br></br></br>  <br> summerfag <br><br>Please, new or not you're pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't see how  is less of a "fitting in" post than </br>  <br>He went into legend as a hero.</br>  <br>Manami kuso</br>  Better ending coming through  People worship characters that did things far worse than Manami just because they happen to look cute, why can't we just like Manami?  <br>She made the incest end possible so she is alright in my book. A necessary evil if you will for Kyousuke's true end.</br>  <br>See, I mean, even the most die-hard Kirinofag has to realise the only reason the incest happens is because of Manami anyway.<br>Kind of funny really, if she didn't get involved and let them progress normally she could've gotten Kyousuke pretty naturally.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what she did wrong.<br><br>She's cute, kind, always lends her time, knows how to cook, and even has a bit of a dom side to her so that's hot</br></br></br>  <br>She is so obsessed with the idea of normalcy that she practically ruins Kirino's relationship with Kyosuke, and basically forced Kyosuke to become a filthy normy, just so he would fall in love with her, the queen of the normies. She did plenty wrong</br>  Bully the Neko  <br>Don't bully the Neko, she doesn't deserve it. Bully the filthy megane, she's earned her punishment</br>  <br>I thought Kyouske became a normal guy during middle school after forcing a female friend to go on a field trip then coercing her into a forbidden section where she gets injured, her parents get livid af, and she ends up moving away and he blamed himself for everything and died inside</br>  <br>it wasn't just Kyosuke's self hatred, Manami decided to stick her big fat stupid nose into it, and make him terrified to do anything more than normal</br>  <br>Guess I have to read the LNs then</br>  <br> Minami should of won </br>   tfw Dutchguy killed himself over this.   <br>Who was that again?</br>  <br>Manami tripfag.</br>  <br>How horrifying.</br>  <br>He went insane at the end and a few people made him so scared that he stopped being my friend and disappeared from the internet.</br>  <br>Being friends through the internet doesn't count as actually being friends.</br>  <br>wow.<br> mfw bf recognized him and started to chat with him on skype </br></br>  <br> ~40% <br> fairly slim <br><br> https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem<wbr>-incest</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I found her annoying.<br><br> pick every option I can to reject her <br> still end up with her <br><br>She's like some succubus you just can't escape from.<br><br> Though she was pretty sweet in the 'MC goes insane from grief' ending </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ending was the only time i could bring myself to like her. She was trying so hard for Taka.<br>This VN, man, i fucking swear.<br>The first ending I got was the one with Kana's recordings. Dear god, i cried like a fucking bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>That was never in the cards for her. <br>Kyousuke mentally associates her with his dead grandma.

First end I got was the 5th one, the second intellectual ending. And that was painful enough.<br><br>The Taka goes crazy ending was probably the worst, but the Recollection ending with the recorder hurt me the most.<br><br> I'm still butthurt about the fact that Kana possibly leaves Taka in the "good" ending and am currently reading a fanfic to alleviate it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who was it that went full autism and did troll subs for an entire episode? Was it you or Dutchguy?<br><br>Is Dutch still tripfagging? I haven't seem him in any Oreimo thread this past year.</br></br></br>  <br>For the love of god, don't read the third installment of that fanfic. It takes everything, and crushes it in your hands. Just finish the second, and be done with it<br>I love this VN, i really do. It was my first, and will always hold a special place in my heart. But fuck me, it keeps tearing holes in me.</br></br>  <br>It's still the only one I've played. <br>I plan to try either Hoshizora no Memoria or Ikikoi next but I'm still not over Kana Imouto yet.</br></br>  <br>Me and I think his trip got leaked.</br>  <br> Minami should of won <br>As if I couldn't hate Minami more</br></br>  <br>This VN is nothing but pain.

It's like the author tried his best to make a girl as unappealing as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>He said in another oreimo thread that his trip got permabanned. Don't know if that is how it works.</br>  <br>How does it feel to have the worst taste on planet earth?</br>  <br>Kirino looks like an aquatic salamander in this image.</br>  <br> disliking worst girl means he has worst taste <br><br>That's not how it works. Manami is empirically shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She has done nothing to deserve such spite<br><br>She was the nicest and least retarded of all the girls</br></br></br>  <br>I never said anything about Manami herself in that post, but two of the qualities he listed are GOAT and childhood friend has no negative consequences for any character.</br>  <br>You're right, I just assumed you were defending Manami.<br><br>I find nothing wrong with those qualities he described, but in Manami they all form into some perfect storm of shittiness.</br></br></br>  <br> <br>I still like Manami though</br> </br>  I'm just a sucker for motherly-type girls<br><br>Probably cuz my own mother used to neglect and beat me when I was child.<br><br>Yea</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Manami never had any chance. Kirino is undeniably the best girl for Kyousuke and they are the OTP.</br>  <br>They're my OTP, They're perfect for each other.</br>  <br>Manami is the fucking WORSE. I hate her so much, that passive aggressive fakeass bitch. Kirino forever.</br>  <br>Manami is definitely the most unwelcome for porn.</br>  <br> Make all the bad things go away <br> Please don't leave me again <br> I need you <br>Something about desperate, yandere Kirino just makes my heart go doki-doki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Manami is definitely the most unwelcome for porn <br>How come her doujins are the best though?<br> I admit, the ones that had multiple girls were really great too, like those ones with LN-sized titles. </br></br></br>  <br> yandere Kirino <br>That sequel was so shit. I get Hyocoroad was experimenting but it's obvious it wasn't a good idea past the drawing board.</br></br>  <br> How come her doujins are the best though? <br>Eh. The one where she gets raped is alright I guess.</br></br>  <br>Only be good if we got Kirino torturing Kuroneko.</br>  <br>I dun get it.</br>  <br>I bet you like NTR, too<br> To be honest, one of my first doujins was Manami, before I really got into what this shit was. <br>http://exhentai.org/g/429378/295fc6<wbr>d2aa/<br> Then i got it confused with <br>http://exhentai.org/g/448843/364110<wbr>99e9/</wbr></br> <br>And the distinction forced me to watch/read both, and that began my downward spiral. So, in a sense, I owe Manami for forcing me to get into manga.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Shame fatty's arc was so fucking boring and needed to be resolved in the next season.</br>      I hoped the PSP VN would sorta redeem this series because you were able to choose the girl.<br>Yet it was still disappointing with no conclusive endings whatsoever. Not even a single kiss in most routes</br>  <br>Are you just randomly shitposting?</br>  <br>PSP VN was just for self inserting, right?  Considering they made Kirino his cousin. </br>  <br>Yes, it butchers characters for the sake of pairing and totally removes Kyousuke's personality to make self inserting easier. Go for it if you only care about seeing your favorite girl winning.</br>  oh hey daily oreimo thread, have your share of happy oreimo doujins :^)<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/698811/f5dd74<wbr>37d4/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/652499/b33440<wbr>1d53/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/387824/5d4c58<wbr>6a31/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I really like Kanako's design, pity she didn't get more development.</br>  Mfw never even watched the show and I knew the sister would win<br><br>Was it really not that obvious to everyone?

I'm still going to watch it regardless. I'm on this thread for the same reason. This is a huge ass fucking spoiler amd reading it made me tear up. That's something thays never happened before. <br> pic related </br></br>  <br>He looks like a kind old man. 10/10, would entrust barely-pubescent daughter to his care.</br>  <br> Sorta kinda NBR </br>  <br>Go back to /mlp/ you faggot.</br>  Kirino is a miracle of the universe.  Greatest love story ever told. I loved Kirino the first time I watched it and opened up to Kuroneko the second time. If you get into it and read the lyrics of the ED songs, which are often inner monologues of the characters, it adds a lot to understanding them and appreciating the story, and at some points it's terribly sad.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-O-<wbr>CXaNgfI8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Shame the anime adaptation was butchered so.</br>  <br> greatest love story ever told <br> not Toradora </br></br>  does anyone else think about assplay and anal sex when thinking about kuroneko?  <br>Of course they do. At least I do.</br>  <br>I think about yeast infection and other girly diseases but then I remember that she is 2D and perfect.</br>  <br>Kuroneko really has the make of a buttslut if you ask me.</br>  Minami is an ugly piece of shit, ugly people don't get love.  We will never get S2's full OST.  <br>She'll probably end up some christmas cake and end up hitting on some younger guy that looks like kyousuke.</br>  <br> That song makes me cry every time. I'm so glad Kirino and Kyousuke got together. </br>  Kirini is shit<br>Manami is shit<br>Kuroneko is shit<br>The anime is shit<br>The LN is shit<br>The author is shit<br>Overall everything about this is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand but that song is actually Kuroneko lamenting her rejection, sung by her seiyuu. It's the ED of the episode where Kyousuke confesses to Kirino, probably shows how biased the anime staff was towards Kuroneko.</br>  <br>Because it played right after the confession I somehow only associate it with Kirino, even if it's actually about Ruri.</br>        I don't think I'm autistic enough to understand what the fuck their talking about. What's all this vague social drama about? Is this a japanese thing?<br>When I was in high school the guys were always blunt and the girls were so fake that they ended up being obvious about their feelings as well.<br><br>Someone explain this shit to an adult</br></br></br>  Holy crap, I thought I was the only one. I just finished the episode and came here to read some posts to see if I could understand it.<br><br>Ever since they started talking about "The real thing" or whatever, everything they say goes straight over my head. I have no idea what happened in that whole ending scene just now.</br></br>  <br>Yeah and I really can't tell if Yui has given up her romantic interest in 8man or not. It seems like it, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to give up after she the comments she made in the 1st season</br>  I'm totally lost as well. Isn't this supposed to be the last episode too?  <br>Yeah, I don't know either. It seems like both Yuki and Yui are trying to push 8man on the other one.<br><br>That's what I thought the whole ending scene was about, I thought it was some sort of vague confession by Yui, but I'm pretty sure that's wrong.<br><br><br>Yeah. I think the 3 of us just may be socially retarded or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Personally I can perfectly understand all that talk about "the genuine thing". <br><br>Every fedoracore autist who thought he was smarter than all the normalfags in high school should be able to relate. <br><br>I'm just hoping most people(the author included) have grown up enough since to realize it's not right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't understand what the fuck their talking about. <br><br>Literally me for half of the second season. Maybe it's because english isn't my first language but I usually manage to understand most stuff pretty well.</br></br></br>  If you don't understand this drek you are literally the negative definition of a normal fag.  I'm with you, OP. I've been lost for awhile now with this show, I'm hoping reading through the LN will help clear stuff up for me.  Are you people legitimately retarded?  <br>This whole "genuine" thing doesn't make sense to me.<br>I get the concept and what 8man wants, but the groups actions don't match their words.<br>Why couldn't Yukinon just give 8man the cookies?<br>Why can't Yui just say what she's implying?<br>etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>The entire 'keep everything super close in and always put up a front' is a JP only thing, yes.<br><br>So in the ending, Yui basically confesses, and tells Yukino that she can solve everyone's problems for them. 8man rejects this and says that Yukino's problem is something she has to solve for herself, because her problem is her dependency on others, so having someone else solve her problem for her doesn't actually address the root of the issue.<br><br>All of them are on super tenterhooks around each other because there's a love triangle, and they all value the current relationship they have between each other, don't want it to change, but realize it has to change or else they'll just go in circles pretending<br><br> oregiaru in a nutshell </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kids being dramatic and shit for absolute no reason. The MC monologues are also cringeworthy, he's the poor man's Kyon.</br>  <br>Not OP but,<br>The LN?<br><br>The worst part is I like this show a lot, so watching it without understanding any of it is so strange.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think I'm autistic enough <br>You mean we are too autistic too.</br></br>  <br>So are you trying to insult us?<br>Because that sentence implies you understand, which means you are calling yourself "the negative definition of a normal fag"</br></br>  <br>The highs school part is just a setting, the main point is the relationship between humans and how they are fake in most part.<br><br>It's kinda like The Walking Dead. It's about human drama but the author decide the story to happen in a post-apocalyptic zombie world. Setting of the story plays no vital part to its actual meaning.</br></br></br>  <br>they are terrified of hurting each other<br><br>that fear is what drives every single conflict in this series</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </br>  <br>Are you asking what the LN is? The Light Novel series the show is based on, there are fan translations of it online.</br>  <br>Oh, cool. Didn't know that. Thanks.</br>  <br>u r dum</br>  Another cancerous thread under OreGairu's belt.  <br>This I can understand. Still doesn't explain  though<br><br><br>But that would mean all the claims of this being aimed at autists are wrong!<br><br><br>Part of being genuine means being honest even when it isn't the nicest thing to do. So this will be something they have to accept if they want to achieve 8mans goal<br><br><br><br>Yeah I realized after I posted that, that he meant not being a normal fag, but I took "the negative of a normal fag" to mean a sperglord or autistic fatman, which is usually an insult on 4chan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/65<wbr>093</wbr> <br> I didn't get what they were talking about in the last episode at all <br><br>Why is Yahari so deep guys?</br></br></br>  <br>Forced drama the anime.</br>  <br> Part of being genuine means being honest even when it isn't the nicest thing to do.  <br><br>and that's what they're learning to do. very slowly. the lesson 'caring about someone means occasionally hurting them' is something they are learning at an extremely glacial pace<br><br>the two autistic characters are in the first real normaly relationship of their lives. they are terrified of losing it, but are figuring out that they can't have a genuine bond without occasionally causing some pain. the normal character is learning this as well, but only because she values her relationship with the other two as deeper than the superficial shit she has with everyone else<br><br>this is a coming of age story, not a love story</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This I can understand. Still doesn't explain  though <br><br>Not him, but I think Yukinon is just being autistic. <br><br>Yui is being vague because she doesn't want to hurt Yukinon's feelings because they're friends.</br></br></br></br></br>  hikki wants genuine relationships.<br>yui wants them to stay friends and not progress to anything further.<br>Yukinoshita is autistic and can't act by herself, always to scared to take the leap of faith,<br>Hayama, Haruno, and Yukinoshitas mom are all cunts</br></br></br>  Stop making more threads you retard<br><br>Finish this one first:<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok I think I understand a bit better.<br>It's just annoying to see this move so slow and awkwardly. Season 1 was all hijinks and 8MAN. This season has been this big back and forth of "no one shares their feelings and this leads to misunderstandings!"</br></br>  <br>OP here, didn't create this thread to be a general series discussion, but to explain this scene in particular.<br>Whenever a question like this is asked in a general thread it usually gets shut down by people telling them they are stupid or just simply ignored</br></br>  <br>it moved from a comedy to a drama. pretty typical for most LNs</br>  Holy fuck the amount of filthy casuals and secondaries in this thread. Even the generals are better than this  <br>And yet here you are</br>  <br>It was still kind of a drama in the first season though, it was just drama the club was tasked with dealing with and thus hijinks insued. Now it's drama for the sake of the club's relationships which I think is much more boring and slow</br>   the real thing <br>this is a common juvenile thing. to understand it, read catcher in the rye. the author of this manga/anime probably did as well.<br><br> what was their conversation about <br>yui realized that yukinon is also in love with hachiman. both hachiman and yukinon also realize it. if one of them confesses, it will end the friendship the three of them have, and nothing will be like before.<br><br>as for "the real thing" in this scene: yui actually wants to force the confession, that's why she gave hachiman the home made stuff. she knew then yukinon would have to act on it. that's why yui said that she's not actually a good girl. hachiman realizes this and says he doesn't want a forced confession/forced progress of their relationship this way, he rather wants to play it out naturally (as in real).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry sir, but I do believe this is the ANIME &amp; MANGA board of 4chan, where us patricians discuss ANIME &amp; MANGA.<br>I do not see anywhere on this site that states the topic is light novels so unfortunately you appear to be out of place.</br></br>   not being able to understand GENUINE dialogue between GENUINE people <br><br>also<br> read the LN </br></br></br>  Also: advanced reading for understanding hachiman in yahari: Nausea by Sartré.  <br>Great, that cleared things up for me at least.<br><br>Thanks!</br></br></br>  <br> yui actually wants to force the confession <br> women always trying to force and/or "fix" things <br><br>Usually things turn out for the worse.</br></br></br></br>  It's literally a LN based about teenage interactions and relationships but since that's boring and retarded in real life this guy decided to make it "deep" <br><br>But he's just a LN writer so yeah the drama was kinda silly and the interactions between the cast are nothing like any teenagers anywhere.</br></br>  <br>Btw this doesn't make it a bad series or anything, if anything it makes it unique. But you can't disagree that the drama and dialogue isn't over the top based on the setting.</br>  <br>the way most tv series or manga, which are not braindead and want to express something, work is that the author usually looks for some references or inspiration in literature/culture and his own past. then they think about who is the target audience and what the production company wants and try to fit in into that. rarely do we get something in which the "moral of the story" or the thought behind it is rather original. when we do, we thank massaki yuasa for another masterpiece.</br>    <br><br>OP here. I think I have a decent understanding of this scene now. But I'm still not too happy about it.<br>I liked it better when the club was dealing with the drama of others and 8MAN saving the day. This internal stuff is just not as entertaining and too slow for my tastes</br></br></br>  <br>if you think it's even the tiniest bit unique you need to read some real books</br>  <br>we just pretend this fucking shit makes sense, also<br> yukino is blind <br> I HAVE A REQUEST.. SERIES END SEASON 3 NEVER </br></br></br>  <br>It's unique for anime and that's all I was saying, this is anime board. <br>Most anime doesn't have interactions and dialogue like this.</br></br>  <br> yukino is blind <br><br>She's also a vietnam vet with PTSD.<br>Never4get</br></br></br></br>  <br> pls help one day, i'm autistic,spoilt and rich but i got problems okay ;_; t-his isn't forced drama or anything just GENUINE problems, btw i want ur dick </br>  <br>Anime in general and especially LN adaptations are hardly the place to go to if you crave deep stories with great characters. <br><br>We just here for the babes.</br></br></br>  <br>this anime is the kinda shit that happens if people who have no problems make their shitty little interactions into problems.</br>  8man alone again ending, calling it now.  <br>Seconding this, not "to understand 8man", but because it is miles better than Yahari</br>  <br>It's almost on point with the first world teenager problems though. Although real teenagers don't talk like the ones in the show.</br>  <br>I wanted a continuation of S1 which at least had an unusual MC without girls tripping over on his dick, not some shitty rehashed LN harem adaption #6532 with some added 'DEEP' shit.<br><br>Anime can be good even if they aren't deep or have great characters but an anime truly sucks dick if it suddenly shifts gear and pretends to something it isn't.</br></br></br>  <br> comparing anime and novels written for young children to philosophical novels that have won the nobel prize <br><br>top kek /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah agreed but it's not like yuki changed since season 1, your post describes her then and now.</br>  <br>I don't see why we can't have both. This drama is moving really slow, you could cut out half of it, replace that half with 8man saving the day and it'd be better and we'd still get the drama and relationship stuff.<br><br>I almost forgot they were still in a club.</br></br></br>  <br>I just suggest reading it.</br>  <br> love triangle <br>Why do people only want single man-woman relationship. Since they are already somewhat an outcast, why not adopt a non-standard woman-man-woman relationship? Whats there to lose?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I like it better when he was hated by everyone and he knew it. I don't like this new people falling in love with him and wanting to be friends with him stuff.</br>  <br>RIP Goddess of S1</br>  <br>She may not have changed but the focus wasn't on the drama in the club in S1 ; the shitty internal problems really ruined the show. I don't really remember Yukino having this massive spotlight on her in S1 where everyone and their mother tries to help her with her 1st world problems. So really, my problem is the bigger focus on Yukino for no reason except for cheap,forced drama.</br>  <br>Fair enough and I agree with you for the most part about the problems in S2</br>  <br>I wonder how the cookies were.</br>  <br><br>I think I'm too socially inept and dead inside to understand all the subtle shit they do. <br><br>Can someone correct me of my current retardness thinking.<br><br>My thoughts are:<br><br>Yui and Yuki both like 8man and want to be his waifu but they know 8man is an autistic idiot and they want to all stay "friends", which they believe can never happen if one of them gets with 8man.<br><br>They all want to stay "friends" but they're not friends to begin with because they're all depressed and shit with hidden lives. They were all forced together by the teacher and go along with it because it's all they got. This “genuine” thing is them wanting to actually be friends without it feeling like its forced but Yuki's sis and mother are always there to remind them all that they’re loners.<br><br>Is any of this actually logical? <br><br>If so, then why does Yui and Yuki want 8mans dick? If they cant be fucking genuine then why do they want to be with him apart from the fact that he's the only person with a physical dick (unlike Yuki's sister who just is a dick) that talks to them.<br><br>Also why the fuck is Kaori Orimoto actually in the show apart from to be a meme.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Protagonist of Nausea:<br><br>He is a loner at heart and often likes to listen to other people's conversations and examine their actions. Even though he at times admits to trying to find some sort of solace in the presence of others, he also exhibits signs of boredom and lack of interest when interacting with people. Antoine does not think highly of himself: "The faces of others have some sense, some direction. Not mine. I cannot even decide whether it is handsome or ugly. I think it is ugly because I have been told so." He eventually starts to think he does not even exist: "My existence was beginning to cause me some concern. Was I a mere figment of the imagination?"<br><br><br>would you agree it's maybe a tiny bit similar to hachiman?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they like that 8man is a selfsacrificing person who will make himself hated to help someone out.</br>  Lets w8 to the LN, ok?  <br>i'm not saying you're wrong, the theme is basically the same<br><br>i'm saying comparing the two is dumb because one is aimed for intellectual thinkers in postwar europe and the other for little babbies in high school in JP</br></br></br>  <br> hey know 8man is an autistic idiot <br>they actually think highly of him. yukinon just teases him when she says he's an idiot and stuff.<br><br> They all want to stay "friends" but they're not friends to begin with because they're all depressed and shit with hidden lives <br>they are friends, they just have some problems with social interactions (yui not so much). one of the reason that they get along so well is that they share these problems (what you call depressions &amp; hidden lives). <br><br> genuine thing <br>see some of the replies above, it's just hachiman's thought though. <br><br> why do they want his dick? <br>because most of the time he seems like an asshole and an incompetent antisocial idiot, but when it counts he is there for other people, solves their problems and says the right things. this contrast is what woman find attractive.<br><br> meme etc. <br>ask in commie irc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui and Yuki both like 8man and want to be his waifu but they know 8man is an autistic idiot and they want to all stay "friends", which they believe can never happen if one of them gets with 8man. <br><br>correct, but they don't think he's an idiot, they think he's unaware of what they think of him - he thinks of himself as this huge asshole, but they think of him as an intelligent, introspective, and 'deep' guy unlike any of their classmates<br><br> They all want to stay "friends" but they're not friends to begin with because they're all depressed and shit with hidden lives. They were all forced together by the teacher and go along with it because it's all they got. This “genuine” thing is them wanting to actually be friends without it feeling like its forced but Yuki's sis and mother are always there to remind them all that they’re loners. <br><br>Whether they're friends or not, they want whatever relationship they have to not be forced, and they dont want to put up stupid barriers between each other. that's why it gets awkward when they start just 'maintaining the status quo'.<br><br> Is any of this actually logical? <br>in the eyes of a teenager yes, for everyone else not so much<br><br> If so, then why does Yui and Yuki want 8mans dick? If they cant be fucking genuine then why do they want to be with him apart from the fact that he's the only person with a physical dick (unlike Yuki's sister who just is a dick) that talks to them. <br><br>yui wants him because she realizes that he's at heart a good guy, someone who always does the right thing at the right time and always steps up to bat when needed, especially when everyone else is a coward<br>yuki wants him because she thinks he's the only one that can understand her point of view and how she hates the masks people put on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i'm saying comparing the two is dumb because one is aimed for intellectual thinkers in postwar europe and the other for little babbies in high school in JP <br><br>i dont know if it was aimed at this audience back then, but its appeal has changed over the century. one of the things that these great novels do, is that they have an universal appeal. the sort of existenzialismus and feelings that sartre touched upon, everyone can relate to. it's why these books became so famous, they touch upon something that is part of human nature and sometimes, some of it oozes through everything we create as well. anime as well. when you see some math on the board in a classroom of an highschool anime (as its sometimes been the case), would you say "dont drag up pythagorean theorem, it's for children!" ?<br><br>see my point is i was not comparing the sartre with yaharishit but using him as means to understand what lies at the heart of the motivations of these characters.</br></br></br></br></br>     Japanese anime drama <br><br>I'm fairly sure japanese people don't act like this irl, what a shit waste of time anime. Dropped.</br></br>  <br>this thread in a nutshell</br>  <br>Sort of like when he confessed to that girl to ensure that the other guy didn't ask her out? Didn't both Yui and Yuki not like his "extreme" methods because of of what he was doing to himself and others to ensure the task was completed? Did they eventually side with him because his methods, although sometimes confrontational/not perfect actually worked?<br><br><br>Cheers for the reply<br><br><br> correct, but they don't think he's an idiot, they think he's unaware of what they think of him - he thinks of himself as this huge asshole, but they think of him as an intelligent, introspective, and 'deep' guy unlike any of their classmates <br><br>This is why Yui hangs out with both of them rather than the "cool kids" she was with before? because 8man actually acts as himself because he doesn't care what people think and Yuki is so upfront and brazen that Yui knows she isn't hiding and asking fake.<br><br> in the eyes of a teenager yes, for everyone else not so much <br><br>I was more asking if what I was saying was logical, sorry for the miss-understanding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari dialogue in a nutshell</br>  <br> This is why Yui hangs out with both of them rather than the "cool kids" she was with before? because 8man actually acts as himself because he doesn't care what people think and Yuki is so upfront and brazen that Yui knows she isn't hiding and asking fake. <br>She hangs out with them because she doesn't have to fake shit and pretend like she does with her normalfag friends</br></br>  ITT : Extroverts trying to understand what the fuck is going on.  <br>This should be required reading before going or making any Yahari thread.</br>  Yahari s2 was even worse than A/Z s2  <br>First world problems (with asian mentality).</br>  <br> needing to read all that shit just to understand what's going on <br><br>I bet you thought G-Reco was good too.</br></br></br>  <br>No. This is just for the autistic, much like the guy who wrote that and many other anons, we got it first time round without needing such posts.</br>  So what do you think, does 8man know that Yui and Yukino like him?  <br>top kek<br>  spot on </br></br>  <br>No one wants to be a cuck. It's fine for the guy but if you were one of the girls it's be like having your waifu fuck your best friend. As in you're a cuck.</br>  <br><br>If he doesn't. He's worse than Kodaka from Haganai. All time densest harem protag.</br></br>  <br>Yeah something like this. Yui is Hayato, Yukinoshita is Yumiko and Hachiman is Ebina; this is imagining that Ebina is bisexual and that both Hayato and Yumiko want to date her.<br><br>Hachiman sees Yui as a "nice girl"; Yui sets aside her feelings because she knows Yukinoshita likes him (and deep down she probably knows that Yukinoshita has more trouble socializing than her).<br><br>Yui sees herself as a "bad person"; she sets aside her feelings for Hachiman, but forces Yukino to confess even if she is unsure. She surmises that if she gives up on Hachiman then she has to make sure that Yukino confesses, even if it could end in a disaster.<br><br>Yukino is a "strong girl"; she should be able to find the words she wants to say to Hachiman to herself, thus Hachiman enforces his "genuine" shit on her. <br><br>Hachiman realizes and stops them because it would not be genuine and because he is unsure of who he likes himself. It gives hope to Yui, and peace of mind to Yukino. And it Hachiman is also forcing himself to man-up; the girls don't really have a problem confessing, but Hachiman will probably feel it wasn't genuine if he doesn't confess himself. <br><br>And you guys thought that their relationship got awkward after the Ebina confession. I can't wait to see how they will act with one another, they probably won't even be able to look at each other without blushing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No probably not I wasn't a social misfit in high school I 100% don't understand whats going on</br>  I felt in the novels that the highschool setting is just to sell more books. This kind of drama could be more understadable on a 20 year something person.  <br>yeah but that was done before, its called honey and clover</br>  <br>But the MC on hachikuro was more normal.</br>  <br>no, they were all pretty autistic</br>  Teenage drama.<br>Just remember back in the day when you used to make a huge deal out of nothing, that's Oregairu, teenagers being stupid and thinking they are deep, wich is very relatable.</br>  <br>I don't know. Wouldn't they be more inclined to just talk it out if they were older?<br><br>Fuck it. I gave up trying to figure out the melodrama in this fucking series ever since the genuine shtick started. Sort of feel bad now that I wasted my teenage life jerking off and laughing at stupid shit instead of this horrific clusterfuck of subtle teen angst. Oh wait. I don't.</br></br></br>  I see people saying this is AOTS when all I see is pointless drama which fails to capture what was enjoyable about season 1. I think more than anything, i'd like someone to explain why this isn't genuinely shit.  <br>The first season was Hachiman hurting himself to help others and they address why this is such an awful thing pretty early in S2. He moves on from that and a good part of the LNs from that point on and most of S2 are about ignoring issues and letting the status quo be in order to protect feelings. This is also wrongminded because you're ignoring a very fundamental part of yourself and lying to everyone you care about.<br><br>Yui's ploy in the last episode was her trying to force Yukino into action (except it backfired because Yukino is too messed up inside, note the sad face Yui makes when it looks like Yukino is about accept the proposal) and to get them out of the rut they're in. While this would help Yukino and make Hachiman happy it doesn't solve any of their problems and results in one of the three sacrificing themselves. This is no good so Hachiman rejects the proposal and declares that they'll struggle with finding that genuine thing together.<br><br> OT3 End Confirmed. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Season one was completely forgettable.</br>  <br>If season one is forgettable then I hope I forget this abomination.</br>  <br>season 1 was pretty forgettable comedy. It was good but nothing that was particularly memorable<br><br>s2 is memorable. whether it's good is up for discussion, but it's something different from the floods of crap</br></br></br>  <br>But that's the thing. S2 has been much more memorable - regardless of its quality.</br>  anyone know who Hayama was referring to as "She" in this ep in S1?  <br>Shizuka, Haruno, Yui, Yukino<br><br>Could be any of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino. Yukino started the service club to help Hachiman become a more sociable person, because she felt guilty about the car accident.</br>  <br>My Dog can express his feelings better than those 3.</br>  It wasn't that hard to read in between the fucking lines. Why the fuck must everything be spoonfed to you? Also why doesn't anyone talk about the obvious fact that 8man has shown no feelings toward Yui throughout the entire show while he goes all lovestruck over Yukino. If Yui ever confessed she would get shut down anyway.  Well, they're basically saying that they love each other, without saying the magic words.  <br>It was kinda shit though. The MCs aren't as likable as Yahari. But dat ED doe.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5XS<wbr>Vgm7Wsk4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Kodaka <br> example of dense MC <br>wat</br></br></br>  <br> Kodaka <br> dense <br><br>Were you even watching the series?</br></br></br></br>    <br>Atleast he knew he's in love with Rika.</br>  Have you watched Code Geass?

The human mind has evolved over time to be able to balance friendships and other things by the many, but romance only by ONE.</br></br></br></br>  Are you guys incapable of understanding anything that isn't blatantly spelled out or something?  Gaijins can't relate to or understand this show since Japanese people are weird as fuck and the way people interact with each other there doesn't make any sense to us. The author probably didn't socialize much in high school either and everything he knows about human interaction are things he made up in his head or read about on the internet.  <br>this actually cleared up so much, I was never into relationships so I wasn't sure</br>  <br>The anime butchers it completely so don't even bother</br>  <br> read catcher in the rye <br><br>opinion discarded</br></br></br>  <br>What are you suggesting I do then?</br>  <br> pointless drama </br>  <br> implying he isn't correct in his comparison </br>  <br>There is absolutely no relation between that shit tier book and Yahari</br>  Have we just resigned ourselves into having multiple threads spewing the exact same nothings?  <br><br>All that frustration has to go somewhere.</br></br>  <br>We must reach the genuine thing somehow</br>  <br><br>I think that Yukinon wouldn't have given her cookies to 8man, despite Yui trying to force it. Yui would've won.<br><br>Hachiman interfered since he realised that this wouldn't help Yukinon's development.

More than that is falling in author's trap to keep the series alive.<br><br> tfw I didn't go to yahari threads this whole season </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FEEL cut anything that have indicator 8man have some feeling to Yui.</br>  <br><br>I kinda don't agree with this. Polyamorous relationships can work, but it takes good communication skills and a perfect understanding of the situation.</br></br>  <br> I don't think I'm autistic enough to understand what the fuck their talking about <br><br>fuck I thought I was the only one, what is fucking going on with these weird kids, are Jap teens all this autismal and pretentious?</br></br></br>  8man is an asshole.<br><br>He's not stupid, he knows that these girls like him. So, why is he letting them do this all the while talking about 'genuine this and genuine that'? Why not make his own choice? Wouldn't that be the more genuine thing to do? Either tell them both that he's are not interested in a relationship OR approach the girl that he wants to be with. <br><br>Waiting around and not making a decision is way worse. If things fall apart, it's ok...it's not the end of the world. You will make new friends...shit he has other friends now. If things manage to stay as is then that's even better. I just feel that it's awful that one of these girls isn't allowed to move on with her life, yet.</br></br></br></br>  This was the last episode. They ended the series with what basically amounted to a summary of the whole series in three minutes of high-strung genuine. Then they ended with a haiku.<br><br>Based Japan</br></br>  <br>8man has never thought Yui's feelings for him were genuine. As you can see from this episode, 8man has also fully realized that Yukino has dependency issues and struggles to find her sense of self. 8man is partially to blame for this as well (and he knows it) since he did fuck over Yukino for the student council position, which may or may not have been something she chose for herself. He can't really make a choice between them because he hasn't even sorted out himself.</br>  <br>Yukino rely too much on others for help just like me.</br>  They should rename this season to My Youth Forced Drama Is Rushed As i Expected... This season doesn't showcase the romantic comedy parts very well.<br><br>Feel, you are a fucking disappointment</br></br>  You have to remember previous conversations and/or pay attention to the characterizations. Asking way too much, I know. <br><br>Yukino has autism and can't make her own decisions. This is mentioned by Haruno earlier in the episode, and can be seen in her general indecisiveness throughout the series (remember all the drama because she didn't speak up and say that she actually wanted to be student council president). <br><br>Yui doesn't want anything to change ("If we each find out how the other feels, I don't think we'll be able to stay the way we are." / "I want things to stay this way forever.") . She wants their little group to stay together, with the same dynamics. Remember how distraught she got during the post-election drama when the club was essentially broken up. <br><br>The point of conflict here is that they both want the 8-inch. Yukino can't bring herself to confess because of her autism, and Yui can't bring herself to confess because she knows it would change, and potentially destroy, the group. Remember the first arc this season about Tobe and Ebina? It's the same thing. Ebina didn't want Tobe to confess because it would make things awkward for everyone, and probably destroy their little clique. Yui is mirroring her here. She also mirrors 8man, at least partially, in his solution of the Ebina/Tobe problem, by giving a half-assed confession that can't really be taken seriously ("It's just to thank you"). <br><br>8man sees through this (at least partially) and knows it isn't what he wants("Vague answers and mutual back-scratching...I don't need any of that."), and also that it won't solve Yukino's autism ("Yukinoshita should solve her own problem herself"). <br><br>The whole theme of the show is that people put on fronts/acts/masks/personas, whatever you want to call them, and hide their true thoughts, feelings, emotions, etc. What 8man wants is genuine understanding, and to be genuinely understood. So he rejects Yui's solution to keep things as they are. <br><br>Not that hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> romance only by ONE <br>Nope. Thats just the church's standard being pushed. Romans were pretty liberal. Islam is pretty liberal(compared to Christians on this single topic). Africans, East Asians. Even most of European royals took as many partners as they wanted.</br></br>  If these three paper bags were in EVA, they'd have all fucking killed themselves five minutes in  <br>The original name is fine. We thought it was going to be romcom with some social commentary on teenage life.<br> But we were coaxed into a snafu </br></br>  you know if 8man just dated Iroha, that would solve literally all their problems  <br><br>The author is a hidden edgelord is my best guess. Just because people are vapid doesn't mean your relationships with them aren't genuine. I wouldn't even know what the author's interpretation of a genuine relationship is. Maybe feeling safe enough to loan out 20 bucks? It's all city folk problems as far as I'm concerned.</br></br>  <br>"Genuine" in the context of what Hikki was looking for in a relationship means being able to be honest with each other, even if it means having to deal with all the baggage attached.<br><br>The shallow friendships that he doesn't want are the kind where people keep their distance and put on a facade so that they don't get hurt, or basically what Hayato's clique was doing when Tobe wanted to confess. It's not edgy at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>S1 is novel and entertaining.<br>S2 has been edgy emo shit.<br>Tuned out mostly unless haruno's on.</br></br></br></br>  So there will be a season 3, yes?  <br>Dude, I stopped getting what this shit is about couple S2 episodes in. Now I watch it only for Yui.</br>  <br>They're already social retards and polygamy is an extremely delicate thing that can fall apart if all the members aren't in agreement or under some kind of system. It's not possible for them to maintain a threesome.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127288205 <br> Underage anon <br><br>I wish there were mods so fucking bad</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127288205 <br>Night kiddo</br>  <br>OVAs most likely</br>  <br>From what I understand, it's not that their friendship is not genuine. They have become very good friends over the course of time.<br><br>It's that both Yukino and Yui are in love with Hachiman and they can't pretend that doesn't happen, otherwise they would be putting up an act and that's exactly what's happening this season. Instead of being blunt and natural they are second guessing each other.<br><br>Yui said she wants everything. She'll force Yukino to come clear with her feelings. Then she's willing to sacrifice or maybe force Yukino to sacrifice by accepting the outcome of it and then that will make their relationship good again.<br><br>Hachiman objects because he knows the one making the sacrifice will be lying to herself or some shit like that. The most important question is actually which if any of them he actually likes. If he likes neither of them then it's instantly problem solved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Oregairu just has a terrible case of not saying things directly and not talking like a normal human being.<br><br>Yui wants the club to just werk, everyone to be happy and have nice relationships. But at the same time she wants the 8man while aware of Yukinon's case.<br>Yukino can't function properly without 8man and became completely dependent on him. And apparently it's not the first time she does something like this. Also being a sort of social retard doesn't really help.<br>Haruno wants Yukino to get her shit together, but watched too much Code Geass and tries to achieve it by playing the villain. Also she finds 8man OMOSHIROI and wants to use him in her keikaku.<br>8man is tired of this whole bullshit and wants some normal, true relationships.<br>Everyone's Hayama tries to meet everyone's expectations, which results in no one being satisfied but also no one being able to complain. It's a result of some old drama from the past. Also he wants to fuck at least one of Yukinoshita sisters.<br>Irohasu is interested in Hayama, but realized that it may just be an immature crush, so she decided to focus on her feelings to 8man, to see if he's her genuine love.<br><br>Now warp all those in the speeches more indirect and unnatural than Tamanawa's SYNERGY rants and you get Oregairu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> feelings <br>What a bunch of faggots. They're definitely not autistic.</br></br>  They're retarded.<br><br>Please stop making threads about this shitty Light Novel. I liked it too but now it's just too much. The melodrama is SHIT, i'd rather watch some mexican tv series where the uncle finds out he's the father of his cousin and the grandpa of his son while also being in a relationship with his daughter that also happens to be his niece.</br></br>  <br> I don't think I'm autistic enough to understand what the fuck their talking about <br><br>So much stupidity in one sentence. Well done, OP. Well done.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually it's pretty much clear what happened to Yukinoshitas and Hayama since author dropped too many hints. Basically:<br><br>Yukino is a serious case of reputation defending sociopath with an elitist narcissist flavor. Her sister Haruno is a textbook example of a disingenuous histrionic. You can see that from their interactions with others. Haruno is destructively vengeful while Yukino is a liar who claims to never lie-one of the prime indicators of a sociopath-.<br><br>Hayama is basically a crackpot who craves to satisfy everyone. Not completely broken like Yukinoshita sisters but close. An appeasing-vivacious histrionic who yearns for attention. I blame their parents and upbringing. <br><br>Hayama and Haruno probably like each other but as concepts, not people as two histrionics cannot handle each other except in extreme cases. Yukino is only interested in Hachiman as a foil and gets her covetousness triggered when Yui makes a move. <br><br>Everyone on the show would be a field day for any psychology research team. Honestly if the author planned for their personality troubles then I would rank him above any LN writers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> muh superior deep LN </br>    I get that Yui doesn't want to hurt Yukino.<br><br>But why is Yukino so fucking passive? She won't do shit for herself unless she can pretend she's doing it for someone else. Why?</br></br>  <br>She is just a bit autistic, m8. Be easy on her.</br>  ITT: Autists defending poor communication by calling it "deep"    <br>under appreciated post</br>  <br><br>I didn't understand it either, so I dropped it. <br>Shit got too 1st first world problems for me.</br></br></br>    I actually knew a person just like Yukino in real life. The part with Yukino parroting 8man's speech brought it back for me. And again at the end when she doesn't stand up to Yui until 8man stands up for her first. <br><br>It was just like that. This dude couldn't do anything unless someone else decided it for him. In social situations, you could sometimes actually see who was "controlling" him since he'd parrot their expressions and mannerisms.<br><br>The genuine subplot is simple. 8man questions the value of putting on airs to keep friends and companions. Not the first book to tackle this problem, and it won't be the last.<br><br>As for the romantic subplot it's not hard to understand at all. Read more books, faggots.<br><br><br>Nice memory. You forgot the part where he literally asks her out (and she turns it down).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Every fedoracore autist who thought he was smarter than all the normalfags in high school should be able to relate.  <br><br> I'm just hoping most people(the author included) have grown up enough since to realize it's not right. <br><br>I agree that being euphoric and acting like you're superior is the wrong way to go, but if you're not a normalfag you'll never be one. At best you'll be the lowest on the totem pole, the friend that all the other friends like to talk shit about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why anyone and a group can't be friends if a pair of them become lover? <br>This is a major problem and flaw with Japan, it's just too much stupid and nonsense drama anywhere else in the world. I never ever see this happening in real life.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much this, glad I dropped early into the season.</br>  <br> Why anyone and a group can't be friends if a pair of them become lover? <br>You need to get out of the house. Seriously.</br></br>  <br>This post sums it up quite well. <br><br> Not that hard. <br>Agreed. I don't know what's wrong with these faggots.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what being a normalcool is like. Sometimes you actually get invested in relationships with friends, peers, girls, etc. and want them to work out.</br>  <br>Like I said, I witnessed it a few times and never became a big deal within the group.</br>  <br> Shit got too 1st first world problems for me. <br>It's been first world problems from the very beginning of the entire story</br></br>  <br>Iroha's main obstruction isn't being considerate, it's that she has amazing compatibility with 8man.<br><br>Think about it, 8man has always been a social outcast. The club is the first time having something resembling a circle of friends, and he's had to fight tooth and nail to keep it intact for just a single year. It's so rough that he thinks you can't be genuine unless you struggle for it.<br><br>To him, the idea that he'd just meet a cute girl like Iroha, and they'd get along perfectly and feel romantically for eachother is incomprehensible. His social traumas, his endless struggle in the club, and his own self-esteem all reinforce this corrupted worldview and simply make it impossible in his mind. This falls almost perfectly in line with the flawed advice he got from Sensei during the StuCo arc. He's currently trapped in her mindset, but he was actually on the right track with his response, which she just brushes off. (There's a reason why she's a lonely drunk, you know.)<br><br>8man's going to have to correct his thinking soon, or he's probably going to end up on a loner end. He'll break Iroha's heart because he'll think that actually getting along well with someone is a bad thing As of the double date, the club is in the worst state it's ever been and will probably continue to spiral out of control as well. He'll be just like Sensei at this rate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> break her heart <br>It would be silly to think Iroha will give up after being rejected once.<br>Remember, she is very strong-willed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>i'd kill myself if i was in that shitty series too tbh</br></br>  From what I understand, it is a culture thing. I'm assuming most people here are from murica or another outgoing country. A friend that traveled to the UK said most men didn't hit on her and were very reserved and proper. Most people don't go up to strangers and have a conversation. Their interaction is a lot more clique-esc. So yui is way more outgoing than the rest. So she's trying to make everyone accept their feelings and put it out there. You can really tell this with her actions towards her mother. It's contrived simply because of how conventional introverted societies work. I mean you can also go the extra mile and say it's a social statement. Like the fight between being your own person and what society wants. Yui is a society wanting to change. where as Yuki is wanting to be the proper etiquette of the old ways and is having trouble adjusting to things. 8 man is the logical manifestation between the two. He understands the old and new, but is trying to blur the two to conform the two into something stable /tangible. Just my opinion on it and there's probably a better one. It's most the impression it gave me .  <br>It was a good thread so far. Thanks for ruining it.</br>  To tell the truth, I see YY confessing to 8man after solving their own problems and 8man will reject both of them. They will cry but in the end, they would still be genuine friends. <br><br>After that, there has to be a timeskip for any of the girls to end with 8man, because I can't picture him accepting a confession during highschool.</br></br>  <br>i think that's the exception rather than the rule.<br><br>i think it's more standard for groups to wind up splintering, and often it happens in rather dramatic fashion (fights and such)</br></br></br>  <br>She recovered quickly that time because it was just Hayama. Her feelings for Hayama were never genuine so it wasn't that bad of an emotional shock.<br><br>If she confesses to 8man as he is now, it would probably be really ugly. In the worst case scenario he might not even take her seriously, in the best case scenario he'd turn her down even if he returns her feelings and horribly regret it afterward. It would be a pretty horrible event for both parties.</br></br></br>  <br> You forgot the part where he literally asks her out <br><br>Because the promised date in volume 6.</br></br></br>  Can someone explain the ending to me? It had something to do with feelings but I don't get it. Also what problems was Hikki talking about? This last episode was cute but confusing and lacked Iroha.  <br>I hate this meme</br>  <br>"thanks for buying the LN and watching the season, now BUY THE NEXT LN FAGGOT"</br>  meme drama  Even hands man is disturbed  13 fucking episodes of nothing happening nd zero progress made.<br><br>this must be a new record. <br><br>Well, at least that Almst kiss scene was good.<br><br>Missd the gay tension between these two a lot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even if so he knows that she tried to confess before AND it's pretty obvious now. He can't keep running away. It would be better if he chose at this point otherwise he would be no better than they were before.</br>  This series is probably the best anime/ln relationship drama/comedy ever created. Obviously there are alot of unrealistic aspects. Hayama as a character doesn't make much sense and neither does Yuigahama. Yukino is spot-on as a sperg. Haruno reminds me alot of a former coworker who tried to help her sister socialize and get out of her shell. People give Yukimom alot of shit but she clearly cares for her daughter, but doesn't know what to do for her. Honestly, I just don't think Yukino is ready for a romantic relationship with anyone. It would be really interesting if Watari does a couple more volumes and actually shows her trying to date 8man and the eventual breakup. But we are probably getting a friendship end.<br>60% friendship<br>40% half-assed Yukino end</br></br>  <br>Fuck you G-Reco is just an unfinished masterpiece, Tomino simply didn't have it in him to make it a 4-cour.</br>  <br><br>  People give Yukimom alot of shit but she clearly cares for her daughter, but doesn't know what to do for her. <br><br>I wouldn't call it 'clear'. She might care for her daughter, but her interpretation of what's best for her daughter may not be the right one. At any rate her motives are still shrouded in mystery.</br></br></br></br>  If Komachi doesn't win, it better be an ending with no one.  <br> Not wanting double imouto jealousy end </br>    <br>Woah, woah, woah, hold it there. You mean to say Hachiman knew all along that both girls have the hots for him? But wouldn't that be highly unlikely of Hachiman's characters? He always disregards the possibility of Yui liking him, which is best displayed on the fireworks episode. And with Yukinon, he just brushes off aside every Yukinon flags (pic related).<br><br>That's why I believe that it's just Yui and Yukinon are the only ones who are aware of their feelings with Hachiman. Yui wanted Hachiman, but still wanted to be friends with Yukinon albeit only in a pretense.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure you shouldn't rethink your argument when your central premise is that the single most positive influence on 8man's life (the service club) is somehow toxic to him?<br><br>It's even more ridiculous than your obvious confirmation bias about the strength of his relationship with Iroha.</br></br></br>  Fucking just finished this shit as well, no idea what the fuck they were talking about but I assume it's just a very vague dip into the pond I've been assuming this show would end with and it was used as a sort of conclusion.<br>If true it's good enough for me.</br>  <br>Moody teenagers doing silly emotional shit.<br><br>Don't worry bro, you don't need to understand it, just watch for the cute anime grills.</br></br></br>  <br>I too have no idea what I'm watching</br>  <br>He doesn't brush off Yukino flags, in you pic he actually has no idea why she's getting flustered, him never seeing like that makes him get that way too since he has no idea how to deal with her when she gets like that.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>just because he noticed it doesn't mean he admits it</br>  <br>The club stopped being a positive influence on him as soon as "genuine" had to come into the picture. They barely made up for a month and were immediately at eachother's throats again, this time because of romantic drama.<br><br>But then, the fact you seem to think 8man and Iroha getting along is "confirmation bias" says enough about your opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>See also beginning of ep 13 when Yui asks Yukino if she was the only one who will get cookies and hachiman monologues "Why am I turning away?"<br><br>He's subconsciously aware of the implications of what the girls are doing even if he doesnt realize it outright</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so what I assumed it was.<br>Any chance of a S3?</br></br>  <br> Also why the fuck is Kaori Orimoto actually in the show apart from to be a meme. <br>To contrast all the other girls acting like they're walking through a minefield when dealing with 8man. She just fucking comes out and says what she wants to with no awkwardness or pretense.<br><br>She's the most genuine girl in the show.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaori wins the 8bowl <br> They go on a date to Saize <br> 8man passes near the community center <br> They meet Tamanawa <br> He strangles 8man with his rotoscoped bare hands </br></br></br></br></br>  Volume 11.5 on 8 August.

The general ones usually hit bump limit around 100 posters.</br>  <br>Exactly<br>This thread is not  genuine </br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Saize?</br>  <br>This thread has an autistic OP and is almost one day old, no wonder there's so many posters.</br>  &lt;b&gt;Yukono will win because of Cat?&lt;/b&gt;  <br>No she will win because of shark.</br>  <br>shaa~</br>  <br>Nice try putting words in my mouth, I never said 8man and Iroha didn't get along, but let me be clearer. <br><br>You've used loaded language like "get along perfectly and feel romantically for each other" and "he'll break Iorha's heart because he'll think that actually getting along well with someone is a bad thing" which combined with the great lengths you go to paint the club in a negative light creates an unspoken "Iroha good/club bad" dichotomy.<br><br>That's a clear sign of confirmation bias, just in considering how all three of the club members have slowly become better people over the course of the series. 8man is slowly beginning to see himself as a person with intrinsic value, Yui hit a major hiccup at the aquarium but is ultimately learning to be more open about her feelings, and while Yukino is at an all-time low with her problems, the light at the end of the tunnel is finally in sight, if not still a long way off.<br><br>And besides how much those three have grown as people, they've grown to care deeply for each other as well. They struggle with a desire to hold back and keep their relationship superficial because they are so deathly afraid that honesty might mean losing each other, but the resolve shown at the end of the aquarium date very clearly shows that they are willing to face whatever pain honesty about their feelings might bring and work through it so that they can truly protect their relationship instead of simply ignoring problems and pretending everything is fine.<br><br>That, by the way, is a level of closeness and concern that we have seen absolutely no parallel to in 8man's relationship with Iroha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the episode three times to get a full understanding, I'm a retard. That and alcohol isn't the best thing for thinking.<br><br>I somewhat got what Yui was going for: either going the Erina route or wanting to have 8man with YukiYuki as her best friend. Yukino has really regressed and all of Haruno's warnings have surfaced, I mean, she almost accepted Yui's proposal to keep the status quo. 8man doesn't like this, it's exactly what he didn't want to happen moreso when he wants something genuine and real. My question is, how does it move from there? Will 8man just break the standstill and choose a girl? Yukino still has some issues that need to be addressed and they're barely getting resolved. LNs bros, how much am I missing? I wanted to read them during S1, but there wasn't enough to incite me. Are they mostly translated? My moon and English are shit.</br></br></br>  <br> polygamy is liberal <br><br>Is this retard serious?<br><br>Polygamy is reactionary because it is the original state of fat chieftains and their best warriors getting several of the best women and the betas being left to fend for themselves<br><br>one for one is liberal, and the romans had mistresses not multiple wives</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I specifically stated that it was in the best case scenario he would like her back, but would still reject her, just to emphasize how flawed this mindset is for 8man. The fact I also provided a worst-case should have made this plenty clear, even if your grasp of English is lacking.<br><br>Learn to read you fucking moron.</br></br></br>  I can kind of understand most of it, but what really bothers me is the scenes when they were making fun of the other school council for being so vague.<br><br>It feels to me like a way to justify it, acknowledging bad writing doesn't make it less bad. Also makes the characters seem hypocrites.</br></br>  They want to fuck and are trying to decide who should buy the condoms.<br>Then Haruno tells them she pierced all the condoms in town.</br>  <br> Yui already gave up on the 8man bowl <br>Wait what</br></br>  <br>No, that example you used still very clearly paints Iroha as something good that 8man will lose because of the evils in his life, of which the club is clearly made out to be the biggest. That also leaves my other example wide open with no effort to refute it, not to mention the loaded language used to demonize the club that I didn't bother listing.<br><br> he's had to fight tooth and nail to keep it intact <br> It's so rough that he thinks you can't be genuine unless you struggle for it <br> endless struggle in the club <br><br>Not to mention this is completely baseless conjecture<br> As of the double date, the club is in the worst state it's ever been and will probably continue to spiral out of control as well <br><br>And then from your response<br>  They barely made up for a month and were immediately at eachother's throats again <br><br>And should I take your lack of response to my points re: the good the club has done 8man to mean you concede that point?<br><br>Lastly since we're apparently allowed to get barbs in now, I'll do so by offering you a handicap: you don't even have to respond to my statement about Iroha's relationship being fundamentally weaker than what Yukino and Yui have with 8man, since I wager you can barely come up with an argument strong enough to convince yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SAWATARI pls</br>  <br>Are we doing trips and dubs again?</br>  <br>I'm not the iroha sperglord, nor have I been following the threads. I very rarely lurk on /a/.<br><br>I honestly think that all the emotional baggage the trio has accrued and the simplistic flirting Iroha's been doing might lead to Hachiman dating Iroha... Too bad it doesn't make thematic sense.</br></br></br>  <br> I can kind of understand most of it, but what really bothers me is the scenes when they were making fun of the other school council for being so vague. <br><br>They are not making fun of the other council. They are trying to force their hand. Hand Gestures guy is purposely bombing the meetings so that there would be no Christmas event.</br></br></br>  <br><br>  My question is, how does it move from there? <br>Nobody knows. And we only have 1 more volume left.<br><br>Also, here:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/89<wbr>du4zd7n3hny/Oregairu</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I disagree, primarily because I think "emotional baggage" is a poor term for it. The problem is mostly that the phrase carries negative connotations, and while what the trio is carrying right now is heavy but not necessarily negative.<br><br>Again it all comes back to how much the three of them care about each other. They have their own issues that they're struggling to work through and the romantic feelings between them that will cause inevitable heartbreak, but they've all decided of their own volition to carry the weight and struggle through the pain because they know they'll have the other two for support.<br><br>Emotional baggage would be more like what Yukino has from her family, where she has struggled for most of her life by having expectations forced on her from all fronts, with little or no real emotional support to help her through it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some other anon pointed out that there were in the archives. You could literally put Yahari and Mediafire to find the link.  Anyways, thanks. </br>  God damn, thanks /a/ for clearing this up. I didn't have a very clear understanding what was happening.  Im not gonna read all of this shit, and I don't know if anyone will care to read this BUT since we're all just talking about what we think, here we go: The genuine thing is a genuine human connection without all the bullshit that people put up to keep issues from getting in the way. The reason Hayama and mc hate each other is that Hayama and his group are willing to lie and pretend that things and feelings they have for each other arent there in order to keep the group together, while 8man and his group are trying to get rid of all the bullshit. Because of their goal of "something genuine" they're supposed to be honest with one another, but Haruno calling them out last last episode about the fact that they had a love triangle they were trying to ignore, and was that really what their idea of "something genuine" was broke the illusion they had that they were on the right path. Yui wanted to go around the whole issue and just have something else decide who was going to be with 8man instead of actually dealing with the shitty situation they were in, which is actually something the old 8man would do to solve the problem, but 8man said that it wouldnt solve anything, and whatever relationships came out of it wouldnt be genuine, because they still wouldnt know how they felt about one another still. <br><br>Yukino hadnt made her own decisions this whole time, so 8man didnt want to see her falling into the same pattern but going from her sister just to other people, in this case Yui and 8man. <br><br>There's a lot of other cool stuff in the anime that I could go on about but I think you're only asking about the ending there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hire a proofreader for fuck sake</br>  <br>naaaaaaaaaaah</br>  <br>Whoa charles dickens i didnt come here to read novel</br>  <br>then stop watching my anime you secondary</br>  <br>Forced drama: this series. Doesn't help that the fanbase is cancerous</br>  <br>Read the LN</br>  <br> All of them are on super tenterhooks around each other because there's a love triangle, and they all value the current relationship they have between each other, don't want it to change, but realize it has to change or else they'll just go in circles pretending <br>So it's any harem anime, but more autistic?</br></br>  <br><br>8man threw away his chances of getting laid, only to disappoint every 8man x Yuki/Yui shipper. It's okay 8man, you could always throw away everything you've built thus far again for the next season. (Possibly?)</br></br>  <br>Hmm because I feel like I can relate. When 8man is talking about wanting 'genuine' relationships he is talking about relationships in which people truly accept you for who you are.<br><br>Do you think your relationships with your friends and family would still be the same way they are now if you were to tell them harshly how you thought about them? Tell them absolutely everything about you? <br><br>Thats kind of the point of the whole series. 8man hates the relationships the rest of the class has because he doesn't believe they are 'genuine' and thus doesn't think they are real relationships. <br><br>The point of the series is exploring the question of what makes a relationship real.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Owari_no_Chronicle:<wbr>Volume14_Chapter_9<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Horizon:Volume_3C_C<wbr>hapter_75<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Horizon:Volume_3C_C<wbr>hapter_76<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=City_Series:Volume3<wbr>b_Chapter_3<br>https://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/<wbr>index.php?title=Clash_of_Hexennacht<wbr>:Volume1_Chapter_2<br><br>I think now is a good time for a new thread and more Kawakami fix.

I didn't see how Kawakami can extend the story even more, also they are pretty close to westfalia and horizon have 8 of 9 weapons. <br><br>All what they need to do is Honnouji incident, deal with the speers and PA O.D.A, then westfalia.</br></br></br>  <br>Black semicircular lines.</br>  <br> horizon have 8 of 9 weapons <br> She has all of them now. </br></br>  <br> Horizon have lust <br>Is there any lewd coming from her at least?</br></br>  <br> also they are pretty close to westfalia <br>They still have two months until Westphalia.</br></br>   tfw at OnC 5B <br><br>feels like stuff is starting to get serious</br></br>  <br>It actually was in the Encyclopedia, just as this screencap from episode 11.<br>They're the same colour as Malga's, how cute.</br></br>  So Sayama's dad really wanted to fuck Shinjou's mom, didn't he?  <br>Who fought and how the fights were?</br>  <br>He has a three girls around him, maybe he acted as clueless harem protag and that's why Yukio choose to leave? <br>Or maybe they was in actual relationship before choosing their work over everything.

So all characters after episode 12 in bakemonogatari that appear dead are dead due to simple logic. And thank fucking god, the worst one was that pedophile who stole money from children, im glad he died, he was the most stupid one and deserved to die at the hands of one that he tricked. his family died aswell if we take, again, nisio's old enemy, logic and reason, that if someone did that, revenge by killing his family is acceptable.

WE CANT KILL CHILD MURDERERS OR PEDOPHILES!-ala that kenshin anime from the 90s.<br><br><br><br>I supose so, the main thing I have against it is the 90% of ....well, not to be ironic, but the repetitive monotone dialogue.<br><br><br>There are manga and anime that has dialogue yet are interesting and even events happen, hxh, jojos bizzare adventure, even death note.<br><br>This is nothing like it, the author will never EVER come close to those in terms of writing clever dialogue.<br><br><br>To be constructive, you have to analyse those mangas and compare them to other bad manga books. Why?<br><br><br>Because then you can figure out the factors on what makes the dialogue interesting, and what factors make it boring. Good/bad.<br><br><br>Think of it like this, why is manga seinen and even shonen manga more interesting in terms of fight scenes then comics from america or europe?<br><br>Very easy<br><br><br>Speedlines and showing multiple panels connecting each action is one.<br><br>The other is fighting choreography, even kung fu movies and small stuff like dust appearing after hits and the noise they make is important. Simply compare them, let alone when to zoom in on certain actions and when to zoom out.<br>Even slow choreography where you can see the fighting is better than too fast.<br><br>Again im just making examples.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I ever saw you in real life I'd punch you in the teeth.</br>    <br>How does she sacrifices herself ?</br>  <br><br>Part of me wish Lelouch was here and that is saying something.</br></br>  <br>No you wouldn't.

ITS NOT LIKE IM MANIPULATING YOU INTO THINKING THIS TO KEP MY OWN INSECURITIES IN CHECK!<br><br>Also why the ever flowing FUCK did she cut her hair?<br>Character development and growth does not come from change.<br>Change does not mean good or bad and neither does staying in a conservative and same state either.<br><br>Instead, staying the same with certain attributes is bad thats true, but not all, just like changing attributes and some personality or behavior is.<br><br><br>I swear nisions way of CUTTING THE HAIR OF EVERY OTHER WORKS HE EVER DONE, I mean is the man insane? its like he is a flaming homosexual faggot who cant decide what haircut to give his female characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being an idiot is not a banable offence anon.</br>  <br>I'm almost starting to enjoy those posts.</br>   all this monogatari cancer who really think this garbage is halfgood and when someone says something bad about It they reply with a smug girl image reaction or bait meme   <br>I gave several points and constructive arguments and examples, you have given none. So it seems the one not giving points, examples or constructive arguments were the one that either lacked one, or most likely baiting and trolling.<br><br><br>Well rather report you instead then.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It does. It falls under quality of posts.</br></br>  <br>Reading has actually given me a headache. <br>Why have our schools failed us like this?</br></br>    <br>What?</br>  <br> Instead, staying the same with certain attributes is bad thats true, but not all, just like changing attributes and some personality or behavior is. <br><br>Can someone decipher this please?<br>It's 2deep4me</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it means "I am a baiting faggot".</br>  <br>Put back your tripcode faggot.</br>  <br>Its like in /co/ where someone disagrees whenever RWYB is an anime or not or has terrible qualities to it or not.<br><br><br>EVERYTHING IS PERFECT ABOUT IT AND WHILE I DONT HAVE ANY ARGUMENT OR REASON ON WHY YOU ARE WRONG I WILL MAKE SMUG ANIME GIRLS AND BAIT MEME!<br><br><br>For fucking sake people, posts something you would like MORE of then in the anime or fanfiction the author is writing.<br><br>There has been good hentai of it that I can agree on, other then that, what would you like to see more of and less of in the anime? that is a good place to start if you DISAGREE WITH ME WITHOUT GOING <br><br>"BAW HE SAID A DISCUSSION ABOUT PUTTING MAYO AND MUSTARD OR BUTTER ON BREAD IS BORING AND HAS NO POINT!"<br><br>In reference, this was something hitagi said to hanekawa in the second series season, 2-5 or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> several points and constructive arguments and examples <br> Assumptions coming from your retardation  <br> Shitposting and trying to bait <br><br>Yeah sure tripfag, enjoy your report.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could dox you to kick you in the nuts.</br>  COMMIE WHEN<br><br>FUCK!!!!!!!!!!</br></br>  <br>If you don't understand what Hitagi meant with the food in neko shiro you are actually retarded and need to kill yourself.<br><br>This fucking shit is why idiots keep saying monogatari is pretentious. Because they don't fucking understand basic fucking things even when they are clearly explained and then whine that's it's 2deep</br></br></br>  <br>You are getting less and less coherent, I liked your first post better.</br>  <br>People say character development and growth of a character comes from changing a characters personality, or attributes that person has.<br><br>In this case, the hair is an attribute, the personality is another.<br>No, it does not, thats a common fallacy in writing. having a character that stays the same yet keeps an interesting personality is still character development and growth.<br><br><br>Or is there any character here that you guys want changed in terms of personality and whatever attributes that person has?<br>And yes, there are exception to this like ichigo for example, the fact he dont want to kill people in the manga and anime.<br><br>But I wouldnt say that he would have grown as a character if he started killing people who deserved it or not, just that its a good trait.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Meaning of the fucking dialogue is fucking spelled out. <br> Retards still don't get it. <br>why</br></br></br>  Starting to doubt KoG right now.  <br> i skipped all my highschool english courses and graduated on essentials and don't even know how metaphors work <br><br>And now look at where you are</br></br></br>  <br>He was right though. See </br>  <br>You havent given a single reason or argument to either explain or counter argument my own arguments. You can whine and bitch all you want thats the difference between criticism and whining and bitching, one has assertions and reason behind them, while the others has not.<br><br>There is no reason, nision is being pretentious hipster.AGAIN, like in katanagatari. <br>There he made one of the characters cut their hair, AGAIN.<br><br>its not too deep, nision does not understand basic psychology, its like he tries to use 12 year old arguments to sound deep<br><br>"THE MEANING OF LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT!" "THE MEANING OF LIFE IS TO BE HAPPY"<br><br>No its fucking not, there is a biological meaning of life to spread your genes and dna, everything we do is to replicate a part of ourself, in this case our dna.<br><br>Thats why we would save our own children from drowning before saving 2 other unknown children from drowning. Our genetic instinct tell us this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody is countering your arguments because they don't need to, your arguments are fucking stupid.</br>    <br>You will not find any arguments here. You sound like an annoying idiot and nobody is going to bother answering you seriously even if it's just to prove your dumb ass wrong. <br>It's best to just leave at this point.</br></br>  <br> "THE MEANING OF LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT!" "THE MEANING OF LIFE IS TO BE HAPPY" <br> No its fucking not, there is a biological meaning of life to spread your genes and dna, everything we do is to replicate a part of ourself, in this case our dna. </br></br>  <br>What metaphoric example are you talking about that were in the show? Again, allegories are different aswell.<br><br><br>You have done nothing but personal attacks yet not a single argument. Shows that people who like the writing of nision lacks basic logic, reason and the only example they can give is of their own lack common sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what halfgood means</br>  <br>Did you just play through metal gear or something?</br>  <br>Okay scratch that<br> i don't even know what metaphors are <br>There we go.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it like a quarter of plusgood and an eighth of doubleplusgood?</br>  <br> Shows that people who like the writing of nision lacks basic logic, reason and the only example they can give is of their own lack common sense. <br>Haha, ok that was funny.</br></br>  You guys shouldn't bully him.<br>He reminds me of Bee.</br>  karen or tsukihi, /a/?  <br>Karen for boners but Tsukihi overall</br>  <br>Bird</br>  So Chitoge won?  <br><br>Are you an animeonlyfag?</br></br>  Nobody is even remotely close to winning in the manga and it makes me fucking sad.  <br> lets reuse that exact look we made for sasami-san for this scene </br>  When exactly did the manga enter the cashcow status?  worst girl always wins<br><br>so yes</br></br>  The only winners when it comes to Nisekoi are those that dropped it half an episode in and never thought about it again  <br>The only true winners are the ones who read the one shot while staying away from the serialization and adaptation. It actually was a good one shot.</br>  <br><br>you're kidding yourself if you don't think everything is currently lined up perfectly for Chitoge. there's literally no chance of it being anyone else</br></br>  <br>Sure buddy, whatever makes you sleep at night.</br>  <br> remotely close to winning in the manga <br>I'd have agreed with you up until the last 2 chapters. Any doubt over how Araraku feels about Chitoge is completely gone now.</br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>What is it that makes her worst girl? I'm saying this as someone that wants to watch it but is curious why there's a lot of dislike for Chitoge.</br>  <br>Shitty tsundere.</br>  <br>Plenty of people like Chitoge. It's a harem story, so you have people in different camps that hate every other girls besides their favorite. Chitoge has been set up to win the whole thing since the oneshot, so you will see desperate Onoderafags shit post about here.</br>  <br>She is an archetypical neo-tsundere.</br>  <br>Ah, that's a shame as looking at her design that's the first blonde character I've ever seen in an anime I thought looked really cute.<br><br>From what little I know of it my guess is whomever is on the front cover, or media relating to advertising the most will win.<br><br>It's like thinking Toradora, Love Hina, or Golden Time would end any other way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Oooh, Neo-Tsundere, does that mean just the pissiness without punching the MC into the sky?</br>  <br> It's like thinking Toradora, Love Hina, or Golden Time would end any other way. <br>Toradora and Golden Time were not harem stories, though.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, sorry, I thought that straight after typing. I think Love Hina and Tenchi are the only harems I've watched.<br><br>But do you understand my sentiment of the advertising and such usually being indicative of a winner?</br></br></br>  <br> But do you understand my sentiment of the advertising and such usually being indicative of a winner? <br>While does prove to be true many times, I think that in the genre of harem that you should never doubt the writer's inability to make one girl actually win.</br></br>  <br> without punching the MC into the sky? <br>In Chitoge's case, literally no. Classical tsundere is where they stare off tsun and go dere, with no bipolar mood swings except maybe during the transition. Neo-anything just means new definition. So how we currently typically think of tsunderes would actually be neo-tsundere.</br></br>  It would appear that our MC is becoming self-aware... Real end of Nisekoi soon?  Oh Komi-sensei, you jester.  <br>He'll get amnesia and reset all his progress.</br>  <br>Remember Love Hina, but only keys?<br>Yeah.</br></br>  <br>List me a few examples, I want to read/watch a few and see if the change of winner seems like an ass pull.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, last Tsundere I seen was Ringo Oginome. I guess I try not to think of Tsunderes especially since Working.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's hilarious that ever since that thread, Nisekoi threads have been dead as fuck. People really did drop it after that.</br>  <br><br>She's gonna win, yeah.</br></br>  <br> He'll get amnesia <br>HA! That will be good for a chapter or two, but amnesia rarely lasts in manga.</br></br>  <br>I like the way you think.</br>  <br><br>He already had amnesia once.<br><br>They were Chitoge chapters.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> people actually think this <br><br>lmao, just READ the mango Kosaki is a BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Spoiler: The reason the 5 of them were all childhood friends in the first place wasn't just because of all the gang stuff. It's that they were all involved in an accident that hit them with a special poison that was developed by Claude.<br><br>Marika got the worst dose, which is why she's sickly all the time. <br><br>The promise to get married was with Onodera, the normal girl who just got caught up in the over the top police/mafia war, and it was a "You'll definitely live, we'll get married when we're grown up!" way.<br><br>The reason so many details about their childhood are foggy is that Chitoge, Raku, and Onodera were then given an amnesia drug to block out their memory of the illness once it went into remission. Marika and Yui still remember everything.<br><br>Series is going to end with Marika, then Yui, then Onodera dying, leaving Chitoge and Raku. Overwhelmed by sadness, they'll avoid each other for two years, then reunite and hold hands.<br><br>The End.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Chitoge doesn't win this will go down as one of the worst harem series to exist.  This whole season was nothing but Chitoge.<br>Chitoge, Chitoge, Chitoge.<br>When she's not being a violent gorilla, she's a bawling moeblob. Who cares?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I wish we had 10 episodes of (worst) Onodera sweating for 20 minutes straight and playing with her disgusting rat tail</br></br>  Let us take a moment to appreciate perfection   in 3 years nisekoi writer catches a nippon cold and dies, plot still hasn't gone an inch forward   <br> Onodera sweating <br><br>It's extremely off-putting the amount of sweating she does. So gross.</br></br></br>  <br>So nobody misses it?</br>  <br> Series is going to end with Marika, then Yui, then Onodera dying <br><br>OK</br></br></br>  I just want S3 for animated fireworks. Or similar in relation to it. Finally getting Yui is fine too. S3 is overdoing it though, and don't really want to see such things stuffed into OVAs.  <br> nisekoi <br> anyone wining anytime soon </br></br>  <br> lmao, just READ the mango Kosaki is a BEST <br>But she is boring moeblob with ZERO development</br></br>  <br> lmao </br>  <br>Oh, let's do.</br>  <br>Best girl always wins.</br>    Is watching the tv version of the second season ok or do I wait for the BDs?  <br>you need an update</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>What are the chances for a Marika end?</br></br>  Chitoge was always the one<br> Sawsze in love means Forever in Love </br>  <br>Raku basically says in the last chapter he needs to stop leading her on and just reject her feelings already.</br>  <br>Marika a best</br>  <br>acording to the manga, I would say less that 10% (she's either kill or eventually leaving because of her health condition)<br>In the last chapter Raku said he needs to stop lying to her and be honest by saying he's not interested at all</br></br>  <br>She sweats more than the Colossal Titan</br>  <br>Last Chapter also confirms that the "Best friend" stuff was bullshit.</br>  <br>She never had a chance</br>  <br><br> manga panda </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>So it is true. Best girl always loses.</br></br></br></br>  <br> nothing but Chitoge. <br> Chitoge, Chitoge, Chitoge. <br>Because this manga is about False Love. The False Love turning into a true one.<br>  What if "Nisekoi" stands up for the "false love" Raku feels for Onodera? <br><br> implying that's a bad thing <br><br><br>You wrote "wins" wrong, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Giving Raku a crush from the very beginning (Kosaki) was a stupid idea for Harem Shenanigans: The Manga.  <br>I still have to watch this last episode but no, she didn't win unless SHAFT pulled an original ending (which I doubt because there would have been some shitstorm).<br><br>She'll win in the manga regardless.</br></br></br>  <br> I have a crush <br> my crush is not my true love <br> The girl I used to hate is the girl I fell in love with <br>We all know that's the scenario.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone that thought otherwise was delusional. It was always just Raku trying to justify his feelings in a way that wasn't romantic. Because he's swimming in a river in Africa. Onodera at this point is a strawman.</br>  <br>The episode was just like in the manga. She decided to give herself some time to get ready to confess.</br>  <br> streaming manga <br>Kill yourself my friend :)</br></br>  <br>Raku's already being forced to realize that he cares about Chitoge more than just a "best friend". We'll probably have some open love drama between the candidates in the coming months as we go through their third year of high school.</br>  <br> he posted <br> while in a Nisekoi thread </br></br>  So, is she going to marry this guy or will she choose Raku and stop being the head of the mafia?  <br> Araraku <br> ku <br><br>Wat?</br></br></br></br>   you'll never have a fake gf that runs up in front bends over and doesn't confess   <br>Jesus Christ, learn to make webms.</br>  <br>get your eyes checked</br>  <br> gif <br> 200x120 <br> 3.28 MB <br><br>Why do you do this to me baby</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tumblr pls go</br>  <br>M-muh heart. There are no excuse for this girl no winning.</br>  <br>Doing god's work, anon.<br><br>DO YOU EVEN SHAFT?!</br></br></br>  If Onodera doesn't win, I'll fucking kill myself.  <br> Wanting the doormat to win <br><br>Funny joke</br></br></br>  <br>Everything is leading to a Chitoge ending. Komi even made Onodera that much of a nice girl so she can be happy if Raku is happy too.</br>  <br>Take pics when you do it.</br>  <br>It's really unlikely, Chitoge will win.<br><br>Which is why I dropped the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>They will barely change anything</br>  I would lick her anus all day    onodera ;_;  Chitoge Mustard Race because Onodera can't ketchup  <br>I want to commit bad things</br>  <br> tumblr <br> 3.28 MB <br>Trying too hard.</br></br></br>    <br>Fuck.</br>  It's over?

I need a psychiatric analysis.<br><br>I don't know what drugs you guys are on that you think his love since elementary school is going to lose. Everybody is fine without Raku and can go on with their lives except for Onodera. <br><br> yankee gaijin going to steal honourable yakuza's heart <br> kek </br></br></br></br></br>  Chitoge a shit. A SHIT.  <br>At this point, I'm pretty sure it will be Onodera ending.<br>If you read up to the most recent chapter and think otherwise, you are stupid</br></br>  <br><br>Please stop false flagging.</br></br>  <br>Well, the concept had Chitoge winning.<br><br>So unless we see a massive swing away from the concept in the near future, I'd bank on that ending.</br></br></br>  <br> false flagging <br>is that another word for samefagging</br></br>  <br>No, it means you intentionally take the position of the side opposing you and make their point as badly as possible in order to make them look like retards.</br>  If Chitoge wins I will eat my  <br>False flag? The flag is already rock solid!<br>Yui-nee knows that and even Marika knows it. The only one who has no idea and still thinks there's a chance is Chitoge</br></br>  <br>Wow, that's such a funny joke. Not only are you shitting on Onadera betters, you're shitting on their reasons in the same go! So smart, much wow.<br> your reasoning for Onadera winning is SO shit i think you're really a chitogefag <br><br>I hate onadera too<br>but truth a truth</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your what? Your what?! This is important.</br>  <br>I'm not the guy you argued with. I only explained "false flagging".</br>  <br>But anon, everything is leading to a Chitoge ending <br>Onodera a cute but Chitoge a best</br></br>  <br>Just stop.</br>  <br>Fuck I already read Nisekoi but I gotta watch it now</br>  <br>Reminds me of Nino's hair</br>  <br>No, if you pay attention to the whole story, not just chapter by chapter, it's clearly leading up to Onodera end.</br>  <br>43 more chapters until he realises it's him<br><br>1,357 chapters until they talk about it again the following week</br></br></br>  <br> Onodera <br> Not considering the fact that Raku is finally realising that he likes Chitoge and Onodera is just an excuse <br>Anon, pls</br></br></br>  <br> I can't like anyone else because I like Onodera! <br> Yes, I like Onodera! <br>Is like he says it to convince himself but fails because of </br></br></br>  <br>You don't stream manga you fucking idiot.</br>  <br>What are you saying? Did you even read the chapter weeks back?<br><br>Raku was for the first time willing to give up the pendant, which he treasures the most the whole time, just to fulfill the promise with Onodera, and she acted the same. They both finally said fuck it and moved on from 11 years ago.<br><br>On the other hand, Chitoge is still stuck in the whole childhood promise thing, thinking Raku will still fall for promised girl.<br><br>Besides, neither Chitoge nor Onodera was the girl Raku made the promise with. It was Yui.<br>But Yui gave the book away to Onodera because she knew Onodera was the one Raku truly liked back them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raku doesn't give a shit about the promise girl anymore. Last chapter showed he likes Chitoge but haven't realised yet, he's that much of a dense. <br>And Chitoge is no more holding onto that promise, she's just being herself, have you read the last chapters?</br></br>  <br> You wrote "wins" wrong, anon. <br><br>But obsessively nice girls are great!</br></br></br>  <br>Tsunderes changing as the times passes just for their beloved one are better. Chitoge is no longer the same stupid tsundere from 120 chapters behind.</br>  <br><br>I dropped the piece of shit manga, don't make me watch the shitty anime too.</br></br>  <br>Where in last chapter showed Raku likes Chitoge? <br>Does he have some kind of feeling towards her? Sure, but it was nothing about being in love or anything. He was just confused. He was upset because he doesn't know why he's confused. He acted more like when you found out your ex-girlfriend has a new boyfriend or something. It did not show at all that Raku wants someone Chitoge likes to be him.<br><br>On the contrary, if you go back like 100 chapters, when Ruri told Raku that Onodera has someone she likes, he said he couldn't get any sleep and that was all he could think about.<br>It clearly shows that Rake wants to be that someone Onodera likes.<br><br>For the story to move forward and come to an ending, Raku first has to realize Chitoge's feeling and deal with it, along with Yui's and Marika's. And so far, I see nothing other than he loves no one but Onodera. I'm pretty sure he will eventually choose her just like 11 years ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His name is Raku...</br>  <br> 12 FPS <br>Why, Shaft?</br></br>  <br> I dropped the piece of shit manga, don't make me watch the shitty anime too. <br><br>He may as well be named generic harem MC number 5422220. So don´t wet your panties boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Are you knew into Generic Harem or what.</br>  Of course the shitty Tsundere is going to win.  <br>Since the very beginning of this entire manga the only major character development ever has been between him and Chitoge, his relationship with Onodera is exactly the same as day one, as with Marika. The only plot progression in all of this shit manga revolves around him and Chitoge. You are blind if you don't see this.</br>  <br>Stay buttblasted</br>  <br>Why? I believe Nisekoi won't end up like other generic crappy harem.<br>I think Komi knew what he was doing from the beginning.</br></br>  <br>Why? The MC is a retarted idiot Chitoge suits him perfectly.</br>  <br>This is not how a Best Friend reacts.</br>  <br> My favorite girl isn't winning!!! <br> The main girl is winning, WHAT A BITCH!1 <br> It's fine, the MC is a faggot anyways!! <br> They deserve each other!! </br></br></br></br>  <br>The show would be over in one Chapter if the MC would just grow a pair and confess. Yes he is retarted.</br>  <br> Are you retarded? <br>You're clearly the retarded one, as that is 12 FPS.<br><br>Please stop posting the backwards version of that image.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But then there would be no roller-coaster</br>   Anyone <br> Winning <br> Anything <br> Happening </br></br></br>  <br> Simpsons </br>  <br>Character development? Yeah, they just became good friends. It's nothing different than relationship between him and Tsugumi or Haru. Nothing special.<br>And after all these chapters, he still likes Onodera more than anything. The message is pretty clear.</br></br>  <br><br> 12 fps <br><br>Seriously nigga? Seriously?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's how ex-boyfriend or brother reacts.</br>  <br><br>And what about Tsugu- You know what? I'm not even gonna ask.</br></br>  <br> Are you knew <br><br>Kek.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, cover up your face your tears are showing.<br><br> brother <br>A brother would be overprotective, Raku's in denial.</br></br></br></br>  Fuck this false flagger shitposting about Onodera, ignore him already.  So, Raku is still avoiding Chitoge because he can't deal with the fact she likes someone right?  <br> Seriously nigga? Seriously? <br>Are you planning on making a point or are you going to continue to simply act retarded?</br></br>  Raku, just like the Onodera fanbase, trying to convince himself that he still likes her so he won't have to deal with the fact he's into tsundere girl now.      <br> I SHOULD LIKE ONODERA! <br>Geez, for fucks sake Raku, get over it already</br></br>  <br> What is love? </br>  <br> baby don't hurt me </br>  <br>I could ask the same to you, see the frames in the spinning.</br>  <br>Why can't he like both? And then pick both? I'm sure they would be okay with a harem marriage, they are best friends.</br>  Can't the girls just get together and rape him? I think everybody would be happy with that.  <br> brother </br>  <br> see the frames in the spinning. <br>It's even lower, at 8. What is your point?</br></br>  <br>I was confused about what happened to her ribbon this episode.<br><br>Initially I thought Raku was telling the truth when he said her original ribbon was fine but then it was shown that Chitoge had taken the other ribbon home and repaired it.<br><br>Did Chitoge really have her original ribbon destroyed only to accept that and move on because of how much Raku was trying to cheer her up?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because even if he's an idiot, he is still being an honorable man.</br>  <br>She has the original. The one that Raku bought flew to and it was destroyed. Raku reached the original one.</br>  Subs when?<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wU<wbr>k8M719Zw<br><br>Anime Staff look good:<br><br>Main voice cast:<br><br>Kiyoshi Fujino: Hiroshi Kamiya (Levi in Attack on Titan)<br>Takehito "Gakuto" Morokuzu: Katsuyuki Konishi (Kamina in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann)<br>Shingo Wakamoto: Kenichi Suzumura (Shinn Asuka in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny)<br>Jouji "Joe" Nezu: Daisuke Namikawa (Narsus in The Heroic Legend of Arslan)<br>Reiji "Andre" Ando: Kazuyuki Okitsu (Gunzo Chihaya in Arpeggio of Blue Steel -Ars Nova-)<br>Mari Kurihara: Sayaka Ohara (Alicia Florence in ARIA The Animation)<br>Meiko Shiraki: Shizuka Ito (Tamaki Kousaka in To Heart 2)<br>Hana Midorikawa: Kana Hanazawa (Ruri Gokou/Kuroneko in Oreimo)<br> <br>Main staff:<br>Director: Tsutomu Mizushima (Girls und Panzer, SHIROBAKO)<br>Series composition: Michiko Yokote (LOVE STAGE!!, No-Rin)<br>Character design/chief animation director: Junichiro Taniguchi (Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun)<br>Anime production: J.C.STAFF (Food Wars: Shokugeki no Soma)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  The president's current design is total shit.

And IS is shit to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that even uniquely identifying?</br>  <br><br>You talking about "Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan"?</br></br>  <br>That's the one.</br>  <br> shit <br><br>Did you even see the PV, if they remove those light beams (its an OVA so I'm betting they will) we're going to experience lewd like never before.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, I was pretty much automatically put off by "Diomedea".</br>    <br>"Guys with the black hair and futuristic swords" shouldn't be a problem.<br><br>But if he's gonna get his nuts kicked by said boring girls every episode, that shit should stay in Japan and NEVER be popular overseas.<br><br>Rogue Hero's Aesthetics. We need more anime like that and more shounen leads like Akatsuki.</br></br></br></br></br>   Chaos dragon <br> Rokka no Yuusha <br> Overlord  <br> GATE <br><br>I'm picking up some more but I'm rolling the dice that at least one of these shows will tide me over with some bearable fantasy adventure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one by Diomedea? <br>Yeah that looks like shit.<br>Anyway I'm too lazy to post it by days so I'll just post the whole list.<br><br> Gangsta <br> Rokka no Yuusha <br> Gate <br> Monster Musume <br> Charlotte <br> Ushio and Tora  <br> Overlord <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> Game of Laplace <br> Prison School <br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had to, I would guess that you're underage.<br>No offense if you aren't. Opinions and whatnot.</br></br>  <br> Only one show in the OP got 39 episodes.  <br> everything else that is not sequel continuation is 1-cour  <br>What went wrong?<br>Even 2-cour thing became rarer in each passing year.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first episode already came out. It still had light beams. The manga at least has loli tits.</br>  <br>GATE is shitty nationalistic nip pandering, Overlord is the same old MMO bullshit with a spooky gimmick, I saw the Chaos Dragon pre-screening and it was shit, and Rokka is just a shitty mystery with unlikable characters.<br>They're all shit.</br></br>  <br> Chaos Dragon <br>With that girly faggot shota? I don't think so.</br></br>    <br> nationalistic nip pandering <br>When will they learn?</br></br>  <br>Gatchaman is the only thing I know I'll watch for sure. Gangsta also looks interesting. Might give Ranpo Kitan a look. I'll watch Non Non Biyori and Durarara if I ever get around to finishing the previous seasons. Other than that, it looks pretty dry.</br>  <br> that certain tripfag <br>Thank you for proving tripfags have the worst taste on this board.</br></br>  Why doesn't everybody just use the live chart?<br>https://www.livechart.me/summer-201<wbr>5/tv</wbr></br>  <br>Because it's not one picture so it's more work to post our list? Duh.</br>  <br>Apparently selecting any of the shows that aren't just blatant fan service moeshit makes you underage now. I guess summer is here already, better pack the bags.</br>  <br> moeshit <br>And you're calling others summer?<br>Go back to /v/, and take your "mature taste" with you.</br></br></br>  Fate/lesbians<br>Gakkou Gurashi a.k.a. Moe girls vs zombie<br>Gate<br><br>and backlog.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't blame that anon, when all you select is mid teen orientated.</br>  Picking up 30 shows, but I'm on the fence with close to half of them (everything in orange). Regardless, it still looks like a solid season even if I drop all of them.   watch 0-3 shows a season <br> claim to have a backlog <br><br>Not fooling anyone, faggots.</br></br></br>  Which studio is doing the prison school adaptation again?  Picking up everything except for the fujoshit, yaoishit, kids toy advertisements, and Dragon Ball.<br><br>Still a lot. Pretty good.</br></br>  <br>I like you, guy.<br><br>Why not Gakkou Gurashi?</br></br></br>   All these people not having Monmusu at the top of their lists <br><br>The fuck has gone wrong with /a/?</br></br>  <br> not picking up DBS <br><br>What's your reason, cocksucker?</br></br></br>  <br><br> mid-teen orientated <br>Sure, not denying that,although then explain anything other than those being outside or over that category then? Almost everything else on there is just moeshit or fanservice shows for the nth time that just gets boring after watch that shit for years. Might as well try other stuff that might break the unending tide of moeshit like Mr.bones wild ride</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, DB is a kids show, I don't claim myself to be a mature man, but that shit is just infantile and really offers nothing for me.</br>  <br>There are hardly even "moeshit" shows, not to mention using moeshit is retarded in the first place, as they are the sole thing anime excels in.<br>There are much more shounen shit than "moeshit", and really the latter is at least aimed at adult males, however fucked up they are.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, I'm tired of anything involving zombies since it's been done to death, revived and then killed again.<br><br>Also I'm thinking of picking up Wooser, but not sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, because fantasy LN adaptations are going to break the unending tide of bullshit.</br>  <br>moe is the cancer ruining /a/ shitting up unrelated threads with their moe garbage.</br>  <br>Because for the same reason I didn't pick up Sailor Moon when it aired a few seasons ago, they're pass their prime and have no right to be brought back from their respective graves.</br>  <br>Stop buzzword posting, and write like you don't intend to shitpost.<br>"Moe" is the best thing anime has to offer.</br></br>  <br>I watched the first two seasons of Wooser and I could count the number of times I laughed on one hand.<br>Nip humor I guess.<br><br><br> I only watch mature anime for mature gentlemen like myself. <br>Go away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh boy here we go</br></br>  <br> same old MMO bullshit <br>Except that there is only one player in the main story (so far) and that not only is he overpowered as fuck (as are his minions), but also doesn't give a shit about killing?</br></br>    <br><br>Moe is shit and you guys know it is killing anime.</br></br>  <br>You can try harder than that, anon.</br>  <br>I'd rather take fantasy LN adaptations than "oh no! senpai saw my panties" again.<br><br><br>Quite the opposite, if it has kept going like this for the past 10 or so years, then it obviously is working for them. Maybe it has killed your enjoyment of it, but they don't care about that.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Man, normally it is way easier to bait moe autists. Good job guys.</br></br>   31 shows picked up <br><br>Well then.</br></br>  Pretty busy season for me, it just might be the best summer in years.<br><br> Monday <br>Teekyuu<br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa<br>Non Non Biyori S2<br>Prisma S3<br><br> Tuesday <br>Overlord<br>Sore ga Seiyuu!<br>Monster Musume<br>Bikini Warriors<br><br> Wednesday <br>OreMonogatari!!<br>Okusama ga Seito Kaichou!<br>Gangsta.<br>Himouto!

Blacked-out is not even bothering.<br><br>I'm going to try the others. <br>Yellow -&gt; Red is my level of skepticism.</br></br></br>  <br> watching nothing for the fourth season in a row <br><br>Welp, I'll take that as a sign to hang up my chinese cartoon cap and find another hobby.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget one of the main writers for that horrible E7 sequel that doesn't exist.</br>  It's an alright season I guess  <br> lamia best girl </br>  <br> Teekyuu <br> sport <br>You god damned retard. Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br> tennis club <br> not sport shit </br></br>  Pretty much just this, as i already read the mangas of everything else that might have been interesting  <br> Teekyuu <br> tennis </br></br>  <br> get called out for being ignorant <br> double down <br>Quit while you're less behind, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon. Salvage whatever dignity you still have left.</br>  <br>it's still another all girl slice of life bullshit show. But yes, there is no tennis involved.</br>  <br> slice of life <br>That doesn't mean what you think it means.</br></br>  Glad its winter in the shitland i live, get to watch NNB while being comfy as fuck  <br>Garbage. Only a few anime are worth watching, 90% is generic school setting / cute girls shit.<br><br>Charlotte is an oddball, it could be good but who knows.<br><br>Aquarion is the only good anime of the season, from what I can tell. Chaos dragon could be OK.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aquarion reeks of trainwreck (and not the good kind).</br>  <br> It has cute girls therefore it's bad. <br>Who invited /v/?</br></br>  <br>Previous season as awesome.<br><br><br>Keyword being generic. Literally every scene in those types of shows has been done a million times. It feels like you're watching the same thing over and over. Another accidental boob grab, another insert MC, another token tsundere. Shit gets old when you've seen a lot of anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aquarion is the only good anime of the season <br><br>Comedy gold.</br></br></br>  <br>It's looking to be, unless you count continuing shows like Arslan. There are always a few surprises, though. Nothing really stands out at the moment. Again, 90% generic cute girl / school setting and of course another stuck in an MMO.</br>  <br>While cute girls aren't necessarily bad, the fact that we get a dozen of that shit season after season after season is bad. I don't understand how you faggots can just eat that shit up.</br>   Gonzo is still alive   <br> boob grab, another insert MC, another token tsundere <br>That doesn't sound like CGDGT to me.<br>I'll agree with you on school-setting romcom harem shit though. They're irredeemable.<br><br><br>Sometimes you find a gem or two. Like this shit was from a show about a schoolboy surrounded by cute mermaids. You could easily pass over it if you had a closed mind.<br>And some people probably passed over Shirobako because 'muh cute girls shit'. What a fucking mistake that would've been.<br><br>And some people just enjoy the relaxing atmosphere of those kinds of shows, like NNB for example. Some people enjoy action, and some people enjoy healing. <br>It's all derivative shit at the end of the day, so nobody has a right to complain about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is this trip not banned?</br>  Finishing up on old anime I haven't taken the time to watch yet. <br><br>(Also, only saged it to see how this works, yes.

I've loved Genesis but I heard Evol sucks so I didn't watch it.  pretty good  <br>Evol wasn't that bad. That's more of a meme if anything. It's not like there's an abundance of good anime that are keeping you from watching it anyway.</br>  <br> wasn't that bad <br>Actually, I agree. The fact that I blotted out every episode after the banana one makes it so much better than it actually is.</br></br>  <br>You won't be able to speculate about reincarnations as well</br>  <br>Two shows, DRRR and Ushio to Tora</br>  <br> I've loved Genesis <br>How?

Wasn't there when I checked a week ago.</br>  I'm just going to watch the first episode of everything and drop everything that doesn't interest me after 1-2 episodes. Most of my favorites end up being the ones that don't get much hype and I pick up in the middle/end of the season anyways.  <br>The first half of EVOL is fantastic. Around episode 18 or so it goes downhill pretty hard and ends on a really shitty note. If you know what you're getting into, it's a fun watch.</br>   people deciding they will watch something to the end before it even begins to air <br>I hope it suck and you regret making hasty decisions.</br>  <br>Almost not bad<br>Get into Working!!, Working'!!, Working!!! though</br></br>  <br>Leaving 4 or 5 interesting titles it is all a shit. I can't even distinguish a series from another.</br>  <br> I can't even distinguish a series from another. <br>Because of how interesting they all look, right?</br></br>  Rate my shit taste.<br>Not picking up any sequels since I didn't watch the prequels.<br>Yellow: 3ep rule.
