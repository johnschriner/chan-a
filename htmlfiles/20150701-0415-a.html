Assuming I know nothing about their respective series, which is (are) the best one(s)?  So now that Twilight is dead what do you think of her character(or lack of thereof) /pc/?<br><br>Is she the most lazy and botched attempt of redeeming in the history of the franchise?</br></br>  <br><br> Assuming I know nothing about their respective series <br><br>Doki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Max Heart 2, 5 Go Go, Smile and Heartcatch make good standalone movies.</br>  <br>Hana no Miyako de Fashion Show... Desu ka!? for that anime hipster cred.</br>  <br>Eas and Seiren's redemption and regret arc were boring and shit. They might have well have been brainwashed considering they became completely different characters afterwards anyway. What they do with Towa might be interesting.</br>  I might be slowpoking, but...<br>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-06-29/precure-magical-girl-<wbr>anime-1st-3-part-film-opens-october<wbr>-31/.89873<br><br>  Three movies <br>  One of which is full 3DCG <br><br>TOEIIIII</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>It sure is a good thing that both of them were brainwashed then.</br>  <br>I think Twilight's character is the weakest out of th 3 redeem Cures, but I like what Toei did with the redemption last episode, mainly because what HaruHaru said carried a lot of weights and is actually inspiring, and Kanata is an unexpectedly likeable and useful character despite how little screentime he got until now.</br>  <br>It's not even done yet you twat.</br>  <br>We don't even know what Towa's character will be like when redeemed other than that she still has some of that Twilight smug. Dyspear clearly isn't going to let her go so easily given the preview for episode 22, though, so that should give us some insight into how she feels about all this as Towa rather than Twilight.<br><br> I like that she's still in Twilight's outfit for at least a little bit, though. </br></br></br>  <br> They might have well have been brainwashed considering they became completely different characters afterwards anyway <br> What they do with Towa might be interesting. <br>Is this bait or are you being sarcastic? Because that's exactly what will and is happening with Twilight/Towa. Twilight for all intends and purposes died last episode.<br><br><br> Implying Eas' brainwashing was maggy whammy brainwashing <br>Did you even watch Fresh?<br><br><br>HaCha's ED people are coming back for the movie. At least the CG will be good and not the shitty CG we got for GoPri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> They might have well have been brainwashed considering they became completely different characters afterwards anyway. <br><br>They kind of were. Seiren had a deception-then-brainwash deal while Eas lived the 1984 experience.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hacha ED <br>Gross. They have the most disgusting CG arms I've seen in all of Precure.</br></br>  I want to die  <br>FURE FURE TOMODACHI</br>  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>What I mean is that Twilight's, the dark princess', character arc is pretty weak compared to Eas and Seiren. The other 2 appeared since ep 1, and had lots of build up until their redemption, while Twilight only appeared much later and didn't do much at all, and her redemption story arc only somewhat begun last 2 eps with the mention of Kanata's missing little sister out of nowhere.</br>  <br> Did you even watch Fresh? <br>I watched most of it. And hell yeah Eas was brainwashed by her society. She didn't change into a completely different character overnight she spent the whole season working to get used to a normal life.</br></br>  <br>Actually, the shot of Twilight staring at Minami and her brother makes sense now that we know the truth about her.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they mentioned Kanata's little sister playing violin back in episode 13, or shortly after.</br>  <br> I watched most of it. <br>What does that even mean? You just stopped partway?</br></br>  <br>I'll never manage to understand how they managed to get brainwashing and redemption right the first time while all the following attempts are such awful messes.</br>  <br><br> Kanata's little sister playing violin back in episode 13 <br><br>They mentioned Kanata himself, not the imouto.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It means I watched up to Northa's introduction. So 37/38 out of 50 episodes. Which is more than 3/5ths of the show, hence most of it.<br><br><br>To be fair now if somebody is brainwashed they aren't going to act like their normal selves. Setsuna/Eas only got it right because her brainwashed state was her normal self.</br></br></br></br>    I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br> there are people who really think this </br>  Twilight's only fault is that she isn't even the least bit interesting. I hope Towa can at least change that.  <br>Look at this shit. Look at it.</br>  <br>i love hime</br>  <br>I'm hoping she'll be sassy and full of spice.</br>  <br>That's what skinny little girl arms look like, anon.</br>  <br><br> sassy and full of spice <br><br>I hope she's full of smug. Like a shadow of that former brainwashed self still lives in her.</br></br></br></br>    Why does /pc/ never has proper discussion about the shows anymore? Even Livejournal and /u/ talk about the shows more.  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>looks perfect</br>  <br>hmtn pnkk</br>  I'm excited for when Bukki arrives. Today was a nice day.  <br> Why does /pc/ never has <br>Maybe because half the site consists of retarded spics that can't speak English?</br></br>  <br>It's funny because non-native English speakers actually have better handle of the language than natives.</br>  This lovely cat has a pocket cat! I wonder how many keys it sells for?<br><br> Hummy will never be for sale. </br></br>  <br>Ellen really shouldn't be showing her pussy to everyone.</br>  <br>Is this what Mexicans tell themselves?</br>      <br>Thank you for always watching over us.</br>    <br> This late already <br>Fuck</br></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>06522<br><br>Doremi has theirs out before commie</br></br></wbr>  Translate Please!!!!  <br>it was already done. use the archive</br>  <br>I want to rest in Peace</br>    What's the most avant-garde that Haruyama has ever gotten?  <br>The pleasure of being cummed inside</br>    I'm in love with this pink  <br><br> mfw when my guess was right when I wake up <br>I wanted to be wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably the one with the flying tree in Doki.</br>  <br> HaCha's ED people are coming back for the movie. <br>I'd rather have had the Doki ED people doing it, but then again it's Doki people, I'm happy they got fired or whatever.</br></br>  <br>I dunno. Hacha had the best CGI so far.</br>  <br>As much as I like "show don't tell", a couple of frames is a bit lacking for the "show" part. If only they introduced her on episode 1 they wouldn't have been in such a hurry and they could have explored that a bit more. Gradually regaining her memories instead of bam! brainwash undone.</br>  <br>It might have been technically superior, but the characters looked outright ugly. Doki managed to have them still kind of look like their 2D counterparts.</br>  <br>How much muscle do you need on your girly tween princess' arms?<br><br><br>Nya~ruka.<br><br><br>Agree.<br><br><br>HaCha had great ED CGI, but Doki had very good ED CGI combined with incredible choreography. As a package, the Doki EDs were just incredible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is you never watched Party Has Come.</br>  <br>Yeah I watched the most lackluster ED of the franchise, what of it?</br>  <br>So what you're saying i you've never seen Suite because that series has the most lackluster EDs of the franchise.</br>    <br>Suite's 2nd ED was quite good.</br>  <br>They were both amazing.</br>  <br>The first one was technically excellent, and grew on me, but it's not a musical genre that I was familiar with and so I didn't like it as much at first.<br><br>So I can understand how someone might not give it enough of a chance to enjoy it.<br><br>But the 2nd one was both good and very accessible, so it seems like anyone could enjoy it without needing to bend his or her musical taste much.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>By far the most sensual ED, no true little girl would fail to appreciate it.</br>  Hopefully Prince Faggot killed himself in the process and Princess Precure can finally be pure yuri again  <br/>  <br>He's obviously going to be the 2nd dark over-general, now that Towa is restored to being non-evil.<br><br>Haruka will cure his brainwashing with a kiss. Or with violin music, but that'd be a cop-out.</br></br></br>  Alice gives you this look. What is your reaction?  <br>What will brocon Towa's reaction be when her new best friend starts to make out with Kanata in front of her?</br>  <br>She will  wave a Miracle Light .<br><br>Later, she'll ask Kirara to help  ease her butthurt .</br></br></br>  <br> 3some </br>  <br>Well Miyamoto was doing something for Smile and Doki EDs too, but now he's also directing the movie.</br>  <br>Also he did the character design for Saint Seiya movie but that goes to uncanny valley category for me</br>  <br> Not familiar with disco <br>get some better taste, anon.</br></br>  <br>"Disco" and "better taste" are not related terms.</br>    <br>The sexiest.<br><br><br> KANATA! <br> TETSUO! <br> KANATA! <br> TETSUO! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They absolutely are.</br>  <br>Disco is the dad rock of dance music.<br><br>You should try listening to something from this geological era.</br></br></br>  Disco isn't bad at all.  <br>Closer to grandad, but okay.<br><br> You should try listening to something from this geological era. <br>Like... rock?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of it is bad. Some of it is good.<br><br><br> Closer to grandad <br>You might be younger than me.<br><br> Like... rock? <br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   geological <br> rock </br>  <br>  You might be younger than me. <br>  All cures could be my daughters <br>I have to find somebody and start my own family.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's the joke.<br><br><br> All cures could be my daughters <br>I have a new fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want those condoms.   new Dragon Ball airs right after GoPri <br>Is there any hope for a new stream?</br>  <br>Who cares about streams.<br><br>If anything, this could boost GoPri ratings by people tuning in earlier so that they don't miss DB.</br></br></br>  Precure pls<br>Why is Cure Ace in my GoPri?</br>  <br>She isn't.</br>  Why is he asking me?  <br>He's going crazy.</br>  When are we going to find out Kanata is actually a girl?  <br>Never because male VA. </br>    I'm surprised Shut is still alive. I thought after getting rid of Close in the first cour, they'd do Shut in the second and Lock in the third, with the finale being Dyspear. <br><br>Twilight changed things up and now unless they kill a general mid-cour, it looks like Shut will be defeated at the end of the third cour, probably by Towa. <br><br>Which leaves Lock + Dyspear at the end  unless the rumors about Lock are true, and he's the real final boss. </br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>I don't know, Lock doesn't really have that final boss feel to me, not like say Kawarino did, where it was obvious from the beginning that this dude was special.</br></br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>Speaking of Kawarino. What's up with him? He looks and acts like he has a hidden agenda or something, even the old Dracula guy (sorry, I forgot his name) called him out on it. But until the very end, he was just pretty much 'muh Deparaiah-sama".</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127385673 <br>W-what?</br>  <br><br>Oh shit, sorry. I completely forgot to use spoiler tags.<br><br>Sorry. Really.</br></br></br></br>  Is Nozomi mentally ready for sex?  <br>Probably.</br>  So Dyspear is only around because of Towa?  <br>No. But she just doesn't care until it's Coco.

Its a series which you can rewatch a lot of times.<br>Its a classic, really</br>  <br>this for the most part<br>and it nailed everything it tried to accomplish, I guess it just hit the spot for some people</br></br>  Great source material and an excellent animation studio.  It was pretty good.  Even mediocre harems like Oreimo and Infinite Stratos tend to sell a lot, and Bake and it's sequels is objectively the best harem ever made. Combine the two and you have a very successful formula.  <br>so let's see here<br> harem <br> commie <br>yep this is a very shallow bait we have over here<br>move on please</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Omnipansering. Bakemonogatari is the best at it and that's why it sold so well.</br>  <br>Bakemonogatari and SHAFT were made for each-other. <br><br>Any other series couldn't pull of what Bake does. If any other studio animated Bake, they would do a straight animation of two people talking for 120 minutes with just a plain background. <br>SHAFT just ignores that convention and gives our eyes something interesting and nice to look at while NisiO's story gets told.</br></br></br></br>  <br> preferring BloatGirls over Commie </br>  because it can appeal to a lot of different people. it appeals to some for visuals, some people who actually read the source material, others because its a harem, others for the over the top fan service, some just for specific characters, and even the dialogue can get you hooked, people like banter and -monogatari is full of it.  <br><br>These two are correct.</br></br>  Ya'll got any more of these.

But then little by little I realized I was learning something and enjoying the learning. So I started studying "for real". I read Tae Kim a few times, and did just 1000 words in SRS. But SRS was so boring that I stopped. Instead I continued to "An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese" and worked through that book. <br><br>After this I started reading VNs. Or rather a single VN, Rewrite. I should probably have chosen something shorter because it took me over 14 months to read it, even though I read every single day. It because part of my life. Then I finally finished it. That's probably my biggest Japanese achievement so far. And it was amazing what progress I made during it, even though I used no other studying resources during it.<br><br>This was just a few months ago. Now I am reading another VN, G-線上の魔王 while studying grammar on the side by watching nihongo no mori on youtube and other miscellaneous stuff. I am far from fluent, probably N2 level, but I have come so far that I am sure I will get there eventually. Quitting never crosses my mind because studying is simply fun. It's just a matter of time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>- Started with Kana, learned to read and write in two weeks. Spend the next two months writing people's names and shit.<br>- Rosetta Stone for a month. Learned shit like "kuruma", "hikouki", "hito" in Romaji.<br>- Spend about four months with a common phrases book and read it twice.<br>- Did RTK thrice. First time, I reached about 400 Kanji. Second time about 1000. Third time to completion of the first book. A year of this. Physical flashcards in the first try.<br>- After finishing RTK, I tried "reading" Tomoyo After by getting the overall meaning without knowing vocab, grammar or readings. Totally deluded that I was understanding it.<br>- Dropped the language twice out of frustation from the above.<br><br>That was before I discovered DJT and after seeing the no-bullshit-allowed philosophy and the guide, I decided to give it another shot. Two years later, I'm about N2 level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> derp 1 month with kana <br> study with rosetta stone <br> spend a whole year on rtk <br>Rough dude. Did you do RTK correctly at least? I mean, if you did at least you know how to write now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Enrolled in first year Japanese at my university <br> Spent a year not learning shit (unless you count kana and 100 or so kanji something) <br> Didn't even know of Anki, DOJG or Tae Kim back then <br> Started Anki over the summer since I planned on taking second year Japanese (despite heavily sucking at it) <br> Got to 700 words &amp; quit <br> Resumed second year Japanese <br> Didn't really do much and only learned some basic grammar concepts like のに <br> Eventually passed the course decently since I had a better feel for studying Japanese. During the course, I started using Anki again since we had to learn about 500 kanji for the second course and I needed a way to memorize words <br> Resumed Anki full time with Core 6k optimized over the summer. I'm now around 3600 words | 1300 kanji in <br> About to finish my first VN &amp; starting other VNs right now <br><br>I've been practically wasting all my time in those 2 years except for the 3-4 months up until now, where I jumped from 100 kanji to 1300.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Started with Namasensei and a notebook<br>Quit<br>Used memrise, and realized that it was rote I hated.<br>Moved onto Anki RTK + Vocab<br>Figured that RTK was retarded after a month, and switched to straight Kanji + vocab<br>Figured learning kanji period was retarded after about a year and 1.?k mature and only had vocab<br>After about 2 years, and 6 thousand or so mature vocab cards, I figured Anki was retarded, and focused on reading to pick up the rest.<br><br>I never did pick up the rest(at least not to satisfaction), and while I can read LN's I couldn't go a page through DanMachi without using KanjiTomo at least once. Looking back, I only see the insidious death of my willpower/motivation. And while I read Japanese nearly everyday, I can't help but to wonder if this was all just effort that might have been better spent elsewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you need to do both Anki and some formal study to feel in the cracks of reading. Reading alone will get you there eventually (in 5-10 years) but the process can be much faster.</br>  <br>Last time I did it, I did it quick as in I wanted to finish the damn thing and move on to something else. The radical and meaning knowledge stayed with me but I can now only write about 500-800 Kanji if I make the effort.</br>  I'm having a hard time finding an English source to tell me the difference between 行き　(ゆき / いき)    <br>ゆき is mostly only for songs and as a suffix.

Reading it through seems really unnecessary to me.</br>  <br>Sort of wondering this too. Almost done with TK and not sure what is the best method to go about learning grammar from the DoJG that's not covered by Tae Kim aside from reading and looking up stuff. Maybe the DoJG cloze/abridged deck and use the reference to find the pages of each card I'm not 100% confident with and read through those?<br><br>I plan to mostly read of course; it'd just be something to do on the side for maybe an hour or so a day to solidify grammar that's a bit uncommon or hazy for me.</br></br></br>  I took my time working through core2k and TK over the last few months and I feel very comfortable with the grammar now. I know it is only a minute accomplishment, but I was happy to get all the non-listening N5 example questions correct today. Thank you for the help I needed to get going DJT! Now to seriously begin reading...  <br> college is way more time consuming than a job <br>Confirmed NEET</br></br>  How's 殻ノ少女 &amp; 嘘ノ少女's difficulty like? If anybody's tried either VNs.  <br>This might be an idea anyway, good luck and never give up.</br>  <br>Honestly, no grammar book is going to prepare you for reading, even the stuff in graded readers is way harder than the example sentences in grammar textbooks. Just start reading and use DOJG as reference books.</br>  Is it better to learn vocab with the Core deck or just add shit to Anki while playing VNs?  Hi there, Steve Kaufmann here. Today, I'm going to make what I consider to be one of my most important videos for language-learners. I'm going to talk about what I consider to be the BIGGEST MISTAKE that most language learners make. This is the biggest mistake, the biggest obstacle, the biggest hurdle, the biggest /thing/ that prevents people from succeeding and becoming fluent -- whatever that means.<br><br>And that mistake is that people stay with the BEGINNER material for too long. They stay with the beginner book, They stay with the beginner course, the beginner lesson, they never get beyond it. And it's quite unnecessary. If you buy a beginner book, which I think is a good thing to do if you embark on learning a new language, that beginner book? You can use it for a year -- but you keep on going back to it. You don't try to master it. You don't try to learn it, understand it, you don't have to learn or remember the dialogue, the vocabulary, the grammar rules, nothing! It's just a bit of initial guide, something that you go back to regularly. As soon as possible, you have to get away from the artificial environment of the beginner course, the beginner textbook, or whatever the teacher has you doing in class, you have go get beyond that.<br><br>You have to get into real language. Now, if I look at my own experience wich Czech, uhm, y'know I started I kept track of it, I started July the 23rd, and I was looking at it today and on August the 4th I started bringing in, uh, using LinQ's quick, yknow, bookmark, that quick import system, bringing in articles from Czech newspapers. That's uh, y'know, whatever it was two weeks after I started. Fighting way my way through these, of course, clicking on every word, saving the word to my database, reviewing them, not really understanding it, ah, kinda picking my way through maybe 30-40%? Most unclear instructor &lt;unintelligible&gt;, I kept on doing it!<br><br>&lt;cont&gt;</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think it would be interesting to plot over time the number of "is it better to learn by x or y"/"should I use x to learn"/"how good is x for learning" type questions vs actual questions about the language. I wonder if it fluctuates much. I feel like we get fewer actual language questions these days, but I'm really not sure.  <br>You know what fuck this it's going to be like five posts:<br>http://pastebin.com/x0pejxwa<br>Someone can edit this if they want. I just wanted to transcribe it.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it me or he is always saying that he is going back to a language or brushing up on one without ever really understanding it.</br>  <br>Yea thats probably what i am going to do.<br>But how can i make sure i translated / understood something correct without having a good english translation for it,thats something im worried about</br></br>  <br><br>He's right about classroom language learning being a joke, but I don't understand why people here think the learning strategies of an autistic savant are useful for normal people.</br></br>  <br>Autists have funny strategies because they're shit at learning. An autist's strategy will work for anyone. That only difference is that it's easier for them to continue doing things that they come up with on their own. Note: Generalizing autism here, this shit doesn't apply to &gt;130 HFAs.</br>  <br>This paranoia will kill you. A translation to check will help you, but it can also make it more difficult to understand Japanese on its own. <br><br>I mean, think about your native language. You or someone you know have probably had misunderstandings about words and what they mean, right? That's just a natural thing. If it's common enough, eventually you'll realize the problem and correct your understanding. In general, if you read a lot, your overall comprehension will move more and more to a correct one. <br><br>For the record, I'm not saying that you should never look up translations or something. If something doesn't make sense or you're confused about a meaning, look it up or ask someone (or move on if you think it's not important). But don't think that reading without an English translation to check will somehow teach you incorrect Japanese in the long run.</br></br></br></br></br>  頭をさすりながら、何事かと辺りを見回している。<br><br>What is this かと?</br></br>  <br>と functions in a sort of adverbial function here, describing how something happened. 何事 is like "something" or "some event", and か shows uncertainty.

And with the low sales I'm surprised they even made that pure CG music video.</br></br>  <br> Complaining about free bonus stuff <br>We're lucky a small budget show like this even got a nice dance.</br></br>  <br><br>You're missing the point. We're talking about a special here, a bonus, not about the show itself.</br></br>  <br><br>tell you what, you give them 1 hundred million yen and then we'll stop sucking it up</br></br>  <br>Yeah well if you gave them a few million dollars more maybe they would be able to put out something better.<br><br>Oh wait you won't, because you're just going to sit behind your keyboard pirating shit and whining when the free stuff you get isn't up to your expectations.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm assuming you bought the BDs since you wish more effort would be put in which means more money is needed.</br>  <br><br><br>I can enjoy the show for what it is. However, that extra isn't good enough for me to enjoy and I'm going to be annoyed when someone expects me to get excited about the worst animation in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, no.<br>For one thing, we don't matter, anime is made for Japanese people and we are not considered. &gt;inb4 those 2-3 example in the whole history<br>Secondly, anime is an industry kept alive by a small number of people, they HAVE to be cheap. It's not a matter of eating shit, it's recognizing this is a niche hobby.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think anyone expects or cares if you're excited. The only thing people care about is you shitting up the thread with how it didn't meet your standards required for enjoyment.</br>  <br> Im gonna be a bitch ass faggot </br>  <br>Nobody is expecting you to be excited except yourself.</br>  <br>Posting that shit and masturbating over it in public like anyone is supposed to think it's good is expecting me to get excited.</br>  <br>Is this your first time here?</br>  <br> Setting an unreasonable standard in your mind <br> Whining to 4chan when it predictably doesn't meet the standards <br> "Waah why did you get me hyped up for this shit waah" <br><br>Maybe you need to re-examine your life.</br></br></br></br></br>  So do we have links to the specials yet? Preferably subbed.<br><br>If you do not enjoy the cgi please keep the comments to yourself, do not keep the fun from others, the fun that you did not have from watching</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>No, it's just what people do when they themselves enjoy it.<br>No one cares about or expects anything of you, or your retarded standards.</br></br>  <br>1-4 are on Nyaa, 5-6 still have to come out.</br>  <br> If you do not enjoy the cgi please keep the comments to yourself, <br><br>Well you can say it sucks when it does, just don't have to be a faggot about it and have a good laugh<br><br>We want to keep out petty bitching but a hug box is just as bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the ones crying because shit animation got called out for being shit. I'm just saying it's unacceptable. Looks like the market is saying so as well.</br>  <br><br>no we're calling you a faggot because you're being a bitch whining about extras</br></br>  <br>At least shitposters like you are keeping the thread alive, I'd be sad if the thread is gone before I get home</br>  <br>I'm saying you have shit taste for liking shit and giving you concrete reasons as to why it's shit. If you can't handle that, then why are you on /a/?

The people in this thread have blown it off or made excuses, or tried to decide that criticizing a show equals shitposting. Soon there will be a thread lamenting Etotama's sales and cursing Japan's shit taste and you niggers won't see the irony.</br>  <br> hold a series to a higher, completely achievable, standard <br><br>You completely forgot that in the beginning you weren't talking about the series itself but only about the Special.

Unless you've been buying every BD, you have no grounds to stand on.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Are you seriously implying that one Special on the last BD disc drags down the sales of the whole TV series?</br></br></br>  <br>love the boob bounce</br>  I figured they were just doing their idol faces. Gotta dance around and smile the whole time, looking pretty while doing a workout. No grimacing.<br>They're acting, not being their natural self at home or on the battlefield where they make whatever expression unconsciously.<br>Now, that could be a good excuse to be lazy on the intricacy of the CG. Or just convenient. And why would they assign the same amount of production and staff as they did for the main series that aired for a BD special?

Can we just talk about how this is the best thing to ever happen to dragon ball?  <br>Naruto Kai was confirmed for january 2016 today</br>  I agree. Filler is just pointless. Although, I did like that one with the snake chick on Snake Way. It took Goku way too long to make it to the end.  It would be best if not for the fucking awful ost. Especially in 2nd Kai bgm is just abysmal. Why couldn't they leave original Japanese DBZ ost?  <br>The actual best thing that would never happened is that FUNi actually finish the Level Set without crushing the dark area of the footage.</br>  The filler is the best part  <br>I'm really glad that a new generation got to experience Dragon Ball, and they did it without nearly as much Toei shit. Plus Funimation got to redub the series using voice actors who actually have experience.</br>  <br>A lot of the VAs are the same but it's better because they have a decade more experience voicing said characters. The Japanese audio is still intolerable though.<br><br>What? It's fine. I would even say better than the original after the Saiyan saga or early Frieza saga.</br></br></br>  Saiyan Saga a best with everyone getting BTFO'd left and right and had to whittle down Vegeta to win.<br><br>Namek Saga was all about Vegeta using underhanded tactics to win with minor emphasis on muh pride. Krillin also gets props for being the only other sensible person there. Story starts to suck once Goku arrives on Namek.<br><br>Androids Saga is where everyone fucks up. Holy shit did a lot of characters fuck up.<br><br>Buu Saga was where Toriyama didn't really care anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best thing <br> edits out of the ass <br> Horrible digital transfer  <br> Shitastic soundtrack  <br> Pacing is still fucked due to the edits <br> No Driving license filler or Bardock special  <br><br>Almost as much of an disaster than Sailor Moon Crystal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But the tournament when Goku was dead was the best part in DBZ</br>  <br> best thing <br><br> hiatus <br> music change <br> buu saga <br><br>Far from ideal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The Japanese audio is still intolerable though. <br><br>I disagree, though not in the usual way. I found the japanese voice acting in Kai to be really bad, whereas the english cast did really well.<br>The original Z japanese voice acting was done really well, and the english cast suffered from poor translations, acting and direction (which improved steadily as the show went on).</br></br></br></br>  I watched a couple of episodes when it was on that saturday morning cartoon block that got cancelled, and the edits and cuts were really disjointing, Especially during the fights.  <br>Sauce or kill yourself</br>  it's not the same without the original guitar riffs  <br><br><br> Not knowing it already exists <br><br>Beginning on April 29, 2009, the original Naruto anime began a rerun on Wednesdays and Thursdays (until the fourth week September 2009 when it changed to just Wednesdays). It was remastered in HD, with new 2D and 3D effects, under the name Naruto: Shōnen Hen (少年篇?, "Youth Version"). It included never before scenes and many non-canon materials was cut to make it more faithful to the original manga. In addition, it contains openings and endings different from the original series.</br></br></br></br></br>   new dragon ball series coming <br> last ED of Dragon Ball Kai says "DON'T LET ME DOWN" <br><br>B R A V O<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm really glad that a new generation got to experience Dragon Ball <br>I hate how people act like DB is some cultural achievement that should be experienced by every generation</br></br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br>but it is</br>  <br><br>American Dragon Ball fans are the worst</br></br>  <br>Im not american though.</br>   That's it. That's the look. <br><br>Dub Cell is Perfect Cell</br></br>  <br>I don't know if you're saying Kai is great or if Kai is the best thing to happen to the franchise, but for the latter you'd definitely be correct. As a franchise Dragonball had stagnated. There was no new interest in the franchise, it was just old fans being old fans. Kai brought in a lot of new fans and breathed life into the franchise. Because of it we've already gotten two new canon movies and are about to get a new TV show for the first time since GT.</br>  Seriously, how can anyone like NTR? How can you even read it, let alone fap to it?<br><br>Justify yourself.</br></br>  <br>It makes my dick hard.</br>  The trick is to self-insert as the girl.  Director's cut when?  <br>July 3 at the earliest, as far as I know.</br>  I miss her ;_;  <br>We'll just have to trust that Nihei does the right thing, anon.</br>  <br>Goddamn Daiz</br>  <br> Nihei already forgot about that one crate with Toha logo on it. </br>  <br>I thought he created this manga just so he can draw Tsumugi?</br>  <br>The right thing would be NOT to validate the unhealthy obsession Nagate shows for a girl who died years ago</br>  <br>I really doubt that Nihei has forgotten about her. If anything, his involvement with the anime should have refreshed his memory.<br><br><br>It was all for sweet interspecies love.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Toha does mechs, not chimeras. Ochiai is away and even if Tsumugi proved it can work, Kanata was hard to deal with. <br>Enajiro 2 will maybe end up as kabi factory unless some drastic changes happen.</br></br>  <br>The right thing to do would be to at least get somewhere with the extra placenta sample waiting somewhere in Sidonia, which he could simply have killed off otherwise. Not saying she would necessarily have to "become" Hoshijiro (although I would prefer that, and think it would be fitting considering some of the show's themes), but at least that plotline has to go somewhere.<br><br><br> unless some drastic changes happen <br>I trust you have read the latest few chapters. I'd call those drastic changes. I could definitely see her make a return in the foreseeable future.</br></br></br></br></br>  S3 better be faster paced with a lot more action.  <br> S3 </br>  <br> I could definitely see her make a return in the foreseeable future. <br>Maybe Yure could pull it off with all the Ochiai's research unlocked but that would take time and they don't really have that right now.<br> drastic changes <br> Heh, I never though I'd see spaceship get a blowjob. <br><br> tsunbot <br> all the preparations for final battle <br>When that happens S3 will have a slow start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would take time and they don't really have that right now <br>I think they'll at least have to take some time to recover before really taking on the LMUS.</br></br>  <br><br>there won't be a s3 until the manga ends</br></br>  <br>The real question is why wouldn't the LMUS just rek them entirely at this point, it has clearly started the offense, so why would it stop when it has only expended a very small fraction of its forces? Kobayashi's plan relies on the fact that they don't get steamrolled, they can't wait around until 10 supersized Gaunas show up to suck on Sidonia. Then there's Ochiai who clearly wishes them harm and is amply equipped with a long-range as fuck weapon to inflict it and is also much smarter than the Gauna.</br>  <br>Well, seems like we'll find out what's going on with Nagate, Izana and Tsumugi next time, so we'll probably have a better idea of where things are going at that point.<br><br>I think one thing's for sure: Many changes are to come.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked Sidonia for the more hard-sci-fi feel.<br><br>Little did I know that Nihei just wanted to make his version of Love Hina with a talking penis monster.<br>Shit got pretty goddamn lame in the middle of this season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Youre fighting gauna and this girl straddles you in your cockpit, what do you do?</br>  <br>Stick it in.</br>   all this new BeniJiro art <br>muh dick</br>  <br>This. I fell in love with KoS when people started dying and shit by accelerating the ship.<br><br>I still like SoL with Izana though.</br></br></br>  <br> I fell in love with KoS when people started dying and shit by accelerating the ship. <br>Not that guy, but that's exactly fucking it.<br><br>It's not hard sci-fi by any stretch, this isn't Planetes, but it felt like the show put a bit of thought into what it really means to be in space, it wasn't just a backdrop and nothing more. Mid S2 did kind of veer of course, if I hadn't been already invested I'm not sure I would've liked the show in general as much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like shit though.</br>  <br>It's not fantastic, but it's better than most. I'll take what I can get.</br>  <br>That's not outright terrible, but the skin tone is totally off. They look like statues or undead or some shit.</br>  So, how much of the story did this second season cover?  <br>Up until Beni is killed properly.</br>  <br>Well shit. Brb, rewatching Planetes.</br>  <br>I hope it fixes the fuckawful CG framerate issues if they do.<br><br>I almost vomited on several occasions in both S1 and S2 when the CG was stuttering around at ~12 fps or whatever fucking lazy ass framerate they bothered to render it at.<br><br>I've mostly accepted that shitty 3DCG is the unavoidable future of anime, but for fucking fuck sakes at least make the goddamned stuff animate smoothly.<br><br>I hate it so much.<br><br><br><br>If I want to pick up the mange from the end of S2, what chapter do I start at?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever chapter they leave that planet but I would go back to the beginning where Izana did reconnaissance on the planet.</br>  <br>They changed that much of the story for an anime-original end? Interesting.</br>  <br>chapter 1</br>  <br><br>Do carsick pansies always get this furious?</br></br>  <br>Nigger I don't get carsick. It's something in how the juddery, stuttering, fucking terrible low-framerate CG shit looks against the rest of the (by comparison) smooth, stable ~24fps animation.<br><br>Stop accepting shit quality.</br></br></br>  <br>The story got shuffled a bit for anime pacing, and the original ending is just in case there will be no S3.</br>  <br> If I want to pick up the mange from the end of S2, what chapter do I start at? <br>The one with Tsunbot as the cover girl.</br></br>  <br>If there ever be S3, it will be a little faster pace than S2. Still with SoL and haremshits but more actions and scifishits in between.</br>  What is his face trying to convey?  <br> mfw they all want my dick </br>  <br> foursome is fine </br>  <br> Tsumugi couldn't come to the award ceremony <br><br>Poor penis-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga that's not what the translation of the op says, at least in the one I found.</br>  <br> I Seriously Hope You Clones Don't Do This </br>  Ren&gt;En  <br>Start from the start.

I don't remember the guy's name, but it was the pilot with number 064 who survived along with Izana.</br></br>  <br><br>It IS a Gauna. <br><br>It wasn't chasing them because they discarded their high density hyggs particle fuel and any artificial kabi.

Gauna produced copies of Hoshijiro's guardian together with pilot. One copy that survived initial battle and remained being major pain in the ass of Sidonia got called Hawk Moth.<br> how Ochia turned the Hoshigiro placenta into Tsumugi. <br>Don't browse /a/ while watching anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Only Yuhata does.</br>  <br>very cute</br>  <br>I must've looked away from the screen when he said that line. Sorry.<br><br>So what's he gonna do with the 2 Hoshijiro clones? And where'd he get that other mutated looking Gauna thing that he said was the key to ascending to a greater existence?<br><br>And why would the Gauna clone Hoshijiro anyway?</br></br></br></br></br>  Your face when?  <br>Izana is Sidonia's official fucktoy.</br>  <br>Last stand katana action from Nagate was cooler</br>    <br> So what's he gonna do with the 2 Hoshijiro clones? <br>Keep one as a backup supposedly, though he doesn't get the 2nd one in the manga so no idea really.<br><br> And where'd he get that other mutated looking Gauna thing that he said was the key to ascending to a greater existence? <br>He worked with Yure and made it the same way he made Tsumugi.<br><br> And why would the Gauna clone Hoshijiro anyway? <br>Because that's what Gauna do to adapt, consume shit and then replicate it.<br>Alternatively the theory is that they're interested in copying humans in order to be able to communicate somehow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> So what's he gonna do with the 2 Hoshijiro clones? <br>Nothing, since 2nd was stored at Toha Heavy industries, not Kunato Developments.<br> And where'd he get that other mutated looking Gauna thing that he said was the key to ascending to a greater existence? <br>It's another chimera, he got it like Tsumugi.<br> And why would the Gauna clone Hoshijiro anyway? <br>Sei said that gauna actions have no meaning when it 'eats' Yaman Eiko and crudely replicates her in the beginning of S1 but maybe it's gauna way to do science or attempt to communicate, hard to say. Anyway, gauna human clones are getting better.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Solaris: The Anime <br><br>Did Nihei ever give Stanislav Lem credit for the inspiration?</br></br>  <br>Aside from the name of the Star System? Not that we know of.<br>I get the feeling he'd readily do so once he's done with Sidonia though.</br></br>  <br>There's entire star system named after Lem in Sidonia. That should be enough.</br>    <br><br>Things like a giant laser beam seem less like trying to communicate and more like trying to genocide.</br></br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Well yes, but with gauna adaptability they don't really need to make clones yet they do it anyway. <br>Maybe they don't want to communicate, maybe they just want to understand humans better so they can make more efficient weapons to kill them.<br>We'll probably never know if Nihei doesn't introduce some TWIST with Enajiro acting as intermediary but I don't think that's very likely.</br></br></br>  <br> "I definitely want to make season 3 and BLAME! with this team. I look forwarding to your ongoing support. Please read the manga while waiting." <br> and BLAME! with this team. <br> BLAME! <br>DO IT!</br></br></br></br>      <br>We'll probably get an Enders Game style last minute reveal. But I hope not, I like the Captain too much for her to turn out to be a genocidal maniac.<br><br>I personally like to think Gauna are a man made construction by one crazy scientist who knew the only way for humanity to stop fighting amongst itself for meaningless shit on earth was to force it's evolution and cooperation by introducing a bigger threat.</br></br></br>  Too many Honkers  <br>You don't like noses?</br>  <br> I like the Captain too much for her to turn out to be a genocidal maniac. <br>It's not like Sidonia doesn't have a good reason to fight. They don't just seek out gauna and massacre them, it's mostly self defense. <br><br>I too think gauna are artificially created but I don't think humans did it. They are probably some alien autonomous work drones / weapons that went berserk.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We'll probably get an Enders Game style last minute reveal. But I hope not, I like the Captain too much for her to turn out to be a genocidal maniac. <br>You split the Earth in half and eat it, you're going to get a face full of Heigus particles.<br>Inability to communicate is not an excuse.</br></br></br>  <br>Right girl is the best girl &amp; i don't even know her name.</br>  <br> They are probably some alien autonomous work drones / weapons that went berserk. <br><br>It'd make sense considering where they found the first kabi. The captain clearly has a goal beyond "kill all the gauna", she seems to be heading to a specific place which no one but her and Bear-chan know about.</br></br></br>  <br>She's dead ;_;<br><br>Well, I assume so because in anime it looks like she was decapitated but then she up and about walking around with Ochia's assistant possesing her.</br></br></br>  Hey there. Dumping a 3-volume superhero manga by Takao Saito (Golgo 13). Crunchyroll published this a while back, along with a few other Takao series. A kind anon ripped them.<br><br> Takeshi and Kentaro are two friends who have been together since they were infants. They were born in the same hospital on the same day, have shared every class in school and even vie over the same girl. However, soon the two friends become closer than they'd like when they discover they are the Chosen Ones that will defeat the powers of an evil being and his minions who are currently wreaking havoc on mankind. Together, the two merge and become a super fighter known as Barom One, capable of taking down monsters with ease. Can Takeshi and Kentaro band together to save the world? </br></br>                        Is it actually any good?
