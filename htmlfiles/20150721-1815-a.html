[ Why is this show getting slept on so hard? It's the best thing I've seen so far this season and all I hear is people are dropping it.  There's nothing interesting about it  My nigga.<br><br>Classroom Crisis is AOTS.</br></br>   spaceships <br> corporate intrigue <br> gar engineers <br> autism-chan giving no fucks </br></br></br>  <br><br>My fellow african american!<br><br>I like it, episode 3 is great.Kids gotta learn that money isnt that easy to get.How many are left? Damn and I thought they would stick together.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's super boring.</br></br>  I like it a lot, Mizuki is really cute  <br><br>engineers are boring, CC make cute anime girls engineers, because need that internet people care about this shit</br></br>  I wouldn't say it was the best but I'm definitely interested.  <br>Uninteresting premise<br>Uninteresting characters <br>False advertising <br><br>Basically it was dead on arrival ironically because it wasn't a generic rom com.</br></br></br></br></br>  Because it's business for idiots<br><br>You don't resolve a billion dollar tech company's over-spending problems via writing on the back of looseleaf.</br></br>  <br> False advertising <br><br>To think they have to resort showcasing the 2 girls in advertising yet they don't do much in the large scheme of things<br><br>Yeah, they fucked up</br></br></br></br></br>  That logo is a total ripoff of a Comedy Central  <br> the best thing I've seen so far this season <br>You have weird or narrow tastes.<br>But yes, it's picking up and taking shape, episode 3 was a definitive improvement. Bad advertising and a slow start can kill interest in a series though.<br><br><br>Or maybe you're the idiot, since that was just a joke to help establish her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  need more yuribait  <br>autism, any series that is not in high gear by the first episode is now 'slow' even if a ton of shit is going on</br>  <br>2deep for neo-/a/, whose collective brain has been melted by all the seasonal haremshit adaptations that Japan keeps shitting out.</br>  <br> False advertising  <br> I made up my own interpretation of what promo art meant and I was wrong </br></br>  <br>because it is incredably bland and generic, there is almost nothing unique about it</br>  <br> Show reveals what the show was really about after 3 months of only showing the three generic moeblobs <br> Not false advertising </br></br>  Watched<br> Classroom Crisis <br>Expected<br> cute future engineers doing cute future engineering things <br> in space! <br>Got<br> corporate bureaucrats doing bureaucratic things </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Am I the only person that went into this expecting a workplace anime not centered around romance? The only major issue I have so far is that the opening episode was a complete mess. I'm glad it's finally picking up after episode 3, but I'm not surprised if it people dropped it entirely. It was a risky decision to go with a bait-and-switch, but it definitely didn't pay off in their favor (especially when an anime based on a manga gets more attention for doing a bait-and-switch of their own).  <br>Actually when I first saw it the first thing that came to mind was Creative Commons.</br>  <br>If this is the show I think it is than I dropped it in the first episode because NOTHING was happening, basically no characters that weren't the most cliche'd things and a plot that is more generic than a musical anime about kids in high school</br>  3 episodes in and I'm honestly not sure what genre this show is supposed to be. Are they going to start racing? Is it just a comedy show? Will they actually start doing proper business management? Am I just watching a show for fujoshi?  <br> A romantic comedy set in a near-futuristic world about the troubles and tribulations of high schoolers on salary. <br>Apparently its Budget Management - The Anime</br></br>  <br><br>The first episode was the best episode. The second episode was nothing but exposition and the third episode didn't have enough of best girl.</br></br>  I like it. Hopefully it won't have much romance in the future either. Romcom is shit.  <br><br>Oh there's going to be a lot of romance.</br></br>  <br>Of all the things to complain about, you choose that? Isn't that a good thing?</br>  It's going through same as G-Reco did when it bothered people who couldn't figure out what it's about in first 2 episodes, except G-Reco had its reputation as being a Tomino show and this is far more coherent series.  <br> Am I just watching a show for fujoshi? <br>Where you got that idea? Have we reached the point that when two guys are in the focus and there's no shitty harem themes the show is for fujoshi?<br><br>Maruto calls it "human drama" whatever that means.</br></br></br></br>  The first episode was a little crazy and nonsensical, the second episode was an info dump that literally put me to sleep (kudos to the documentary style, though), and the third episode was simply boring. The humor isn't really doing it for me and I'm not sure what genre this even falls under at this point. Maybe the show picks up later on but I'm out and not looking back.  <br>Best girl and the first episode are why I keep watching this. Also supposedly there's something big going down in episode 4.</br>  <br> Where you got that idea? Have we reached the point that when two guys are in the focus and there's no shitty harem themes the show is for fujoshi? <br><br>Pretty much. Anytime guys are involved and interacting the fujoshi will sets their sights on them</br></br></br>  <br> The first episode was a little crazy and nonsensical, the second episode was an info dump that literally put me to sleep (kudos to the documentary style, though), and the third episode was simply boring <br>Literally how I feel about Death Parade</br></br>  <br>If its yuri, it will be AOTS.<br>Unfortunately it will probably be between Lelouch and Sensei's imouto.</br></br>  <br> Believing Yuribait. </br>  <br>That's funny, I can only imagine how /a/ would react these days to LoGH. Not only it's very slow it has mostly male characters.</br>  <br>LoGH has lots of fujos.</br>  it doesn`t look good to be honest<br>which makes me want to give it a try</br>  No idea, but this show is pretty great. Most people that drop it say "wahh it's so boring," which basically translates to "the girls aren't cute enough/don't pander to me." Because Rokka no Yuusha is boring as fuck but those bunny's thighs are otherworldly, so people will praise it as AOTS even though it's shit.  <br> the girls aren't cute enough/don't pander to me. <br><br>But that's wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> /u/ projecting their shit taste on everyone else <br>Yeah nah, the Christmas cake is the only one even in the competition for best girl. Which is why everyone dropped it, there isn't enough thick feminine thighs like in Rokka no Yuusha.</br></br>  <br> promo for the series is basically one image of the cast <br> two girls are prominent clearly that must mean its a romcom/yuribait whatever <br><br>you only have yourself to blame</br></br></br></br>  You can probably feel it better if you've went through the process of co-determination at work and eventually lost your job due to it<br>I can understand that if you've never been employed it might not be very interesting, because it barely uses the high school setting it has</br>  <br>I get it now, anons think it is slow because they do not actually pay attention.<br><br>How many even seem to recognize the conflict between the brothers is whats driving events.</br></br></br>  <br> Classroom Crisis is AOTS. <br><br>looks like someone doesn't know how to spell Non Non Biyori</br></br></br>  <br>To me the show has the most interesting setting and cutest characters this season, but it bothers me that the two cutest students(PR girl and combustion tester boy) left.</br>  <br> misspelling Gakkou Gurashi </br>  Do you guys think K-On! is good or bad?  Good.  Mugi is good  <br><br>Boring as hell, I believe you need a certain amount of autism to enjoy it. If you have autism and do enjoy K-On!, good on you.</br></br>  <br>my black friend</br>  Overall mediocre.  <br>Azusa was ok i guess</br>  <br>Mugi a best</br>  <br>It was good because when I watch a show the most important thing is that elements from it stick with me even after the series is long over.<br>There are shows I absolutely love when they are airing but once they finish I forget about them immediately, that means that they were just fun in a spontaneous kind of way but nothing memorable.<br><br>The characters from K-ON can be inserted in any kind of situation in any context and they'd still be great.<br><br>Besides they are great fap material.<br><br>Yeah K-ON was good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128363520 <br><br>No, not at all, I like faggy shit too, it's just too fucking dull for me. Naruto is too shitty for me though even consider though.</br></br>  K-on is actually the worst anime i have ever seen. The girls are boring as all fuck and you must have serious tumors in your brain and also must have an IQ lower than a shark   mfw I think most SoL is complete shit <br> mfw I'd happily put K-ON! in a top ten list. </br>  <br><br>I think it's amazing.</br></br>  <br>Came for the Sawa-chan, stayed for the Sawa-chan.<br>1st season was kinda nice, 2nd season was dank dreck.</br></br>  <br>7/10</br>  <br>I enjoyed it.<br>Apparently i'm autistic, have tumors in my brain and an IQ lower than a shark.<br> life is good </br></br></br>  <br>Good as fuck. <br>Yui best girl but all keions are love.</br></br>  <br>Ritsu is perfect wife material. She is cute, fit, easygoing and down to earth, and funny. The other Keions are great too, but the rest of them have more negatives than Ritsu does when looking at them as potential wives. Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. Ritsu may be lazy but she is nowhere near as bad as Yui is. Ritsu could be reasoned with and taught to do things. Yui would just forget to do everything I told her to do. Mio and Mugi will both get fat once their metabolism slows down in their early-mid 20s. Many would think that Mugi being rich would be a huge positive for her, but to me it isn't. Even though she would be kind about it, she would always expect more than what I could provide for her on my own. I also would not want to leech off of her family's money. Mio's personality is adorable but overall I prefer Ritsu's. Ritsu is just more interesting to me. Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. I don't want to deal with her tsundere bullshit for 60 years. Jun is a fucking shit. She deserves no explanation beyond that. Ton-chan would be a better wife than Jun would be.</br>  Yes.  The anime is slow-paced, boring, and ruined by Kyoto Animation's insertion of dramatic scenes. The manga suffers from utilizing hard to translate japanese humor while being targeted towards older people who know a lot of kanji thus being inaccessible to international people. Solution: play K-ON! Houkago Live!! and let that be the end of the franchise.  <br>Dropped.</br>  20 posts in and we're already memeing it up.  <br>We're having this thread again?<br><br>okay</br></br></br>  <br> thus being inaccessible to international people <br> <br>So?<br><br>Why should they give a shit about people who will just read shitty translated scans on the internet?</br></br></br></br></br>  If Keion is not your favorite show you have shit taste  i don't have to say anything  <br>More interest in a series overseas = potential for a license deal with a big foreign company = profit</br>  <br>and you shouldn't.<br>don't write checks your mouth can't cash</br></br>  are we letting this thread sage?  <br>This.</br>  <br>Same, SoL is shit, but K-On was something special.</br>  K-ON is objectively better than Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The most sophisticated anime ever created, a tour de force, the pièce de résistance of animation! LoGH is little more than plebeian dreck in comparison, the creators wishing they could have produced an anime with even an inkling of the genius contained within Our Holy K-ON. From the profound debates about eating cake, to the highly philosophical discussions about procrastination, to the marvellous musicianship exhibited by the Light Music Club, K-ON has established itself as the greatest intellectual anime. You cannot disagree unless you are a terrible person. Seriously. It's an infallible law of the universe. K-ON is a masterpiece. And we all know that K-ON has the superior tea scenes.<br><br>"A phenomenal chef-d'oeuvre. My fifteen years of work on Evangelion now feel trivial by comparison." — Anno Hideaki, esteemed anime director<br><br>"During a time of struggle, K-ON's beautiful story provided the influence needed for me to become an ideal president. I am now a better man." — Barack Obama, 44th president of the United States<br><br>"I am an uncultured lowborn with pedestrian tastes in anime." — Anonymous plebeian, speaking in reflection of his love for LoGH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>K-on is not good or bad.<br>It's very good.<br>It is by far my most rewatched anime.<br>I just finished the movie yesterday so it's back to S1 episode 1 today.<br> the ride never ends. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>K-ON is the best anime I've ever seen because it's a good slice of life, because life is what art imitates and if you can present a portrayal of life at its most calming, pleasurable and satisfying, then you'll have a medium that transcends all else. It is the ultimate form of expression, art and part of the human experience. It is truly something that everyone must experience at least once in their lives. So, go watch K-ON. That's all the advice I can give you in life.</br>  who is your second favorite girl? Mine's Yui  <br>Ritsu and Mio keep switching for number one.<br>So on some days it's Mio and others it's Ritsu.</br></br>  <br>Yui a best.<br>Azu-nyan and Ritsu are second best</br></br>  <br> ritsu <br> second best <br>I disagree, but I respect your right to have an opinion, nonetheless</br></br></br>  <br> Not recognizing Mugi as the goddess she is </br>  <br>she's a good girl, but she doesn't have enough development to be best</br>  It's great, but it's still being talked to death  Best Moeshit anime to ever exist.<br><br>Yui is my retarded waifu</br></br>  What's the average IQ level of each one of them?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128372933 <br>Yui obviously.

I don't doubt it that it'll still be remembered 5 years from now.  Does somebody have this image in a better quality?  It is good, but also a bit overrated by newfags who haven't seen a lot of moe/SoL yet.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128373485   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128374184   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128373361 <br>what the fuck...?<br>what the HELL did you do to my waifu?!</br></br>  Potato Quality Anime  <br>wow she's gorgeous.<br>even so, that belongs on /s/</br></br>  <br>Potatoes are literally the best tasting and most versatile vegetable.<br><br>So yes K-On is definitely a Potato anime.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you</br>  <br>pretty much this</br>  <br>Who is the best tasting and most versatile Keion?</br>  <br> best tasting. <br>Probably Mugi.<br> Most versatile. <br>Probably Mugi again, she's been playing the piano since she was four so her transition to other instruments would be the easiest.</br></br></br></br>  The thing about K-On! is, at least for me, it is absolutely impossible to decide on one waifu.<br><br>They're all so damn perfect in their own ways and they all compliment each other perfectly.<br><br>I mean, if I had to sexualize one, it'd be Sawako, their teacher, because she's gotta be the only one without innocence.

Maybe I just can't understand because I'm not a fatass. Niggas could stand to do a little sweatin around here anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how hot is it where you live? For me the heat is normally okay, but today we have 70-80% humidity as well for some fucking reason</br>  <br>The news says it feels like over a hundred. It's hot, but I mean, it's just hot.</br>  <br>I hate being uncomfortable. I'm just a little bitch, so I complain a lot. Californians are a little spoiled.</br>  <br>You gotta understand man, 41°C/106°F is a lethal body temperature, and when it's roughly that temperature or higher outside your body goes into maximum panic mode saying 'damn it's way too hot, get me the fuck outta here'.<br>Staying outside at those temperatures for an hour or so will no doubt dehydrate you and possibly send you into heat stroke.<br>If you're not extremely uncomfortable at that kind of temperature, that's a medical concern.</br></br></br>  summer here in Sweden is fucking awful this year.<br><br>it rains almost every god damn day and there only been a weeks worth of good weather but not good summer weather. fuck i started freezing when i was out in the middle of the night yesterday.</br></br>  <br> a little spoiled <br>You stole enough water.</br></br>  <br>Stole?

My broke down recently and I'm dying here, I'm not used to the heat.<br> it's gonna be 95°F/35°C tomorrow. </br>  The only reason I don't like extreme heat is because it is hard to work our and ride my bike.  <br>Wouldn't shielding your entire house in solar panels cost much more</br>  <br>WUEEE WUEEE WUEEE WUEEE WUEEE WHIRRRRRRRRRRRR</br>   tfw 36°C today and tomorrow <br> tfw rained recently, so it dropped to 30°C <br> tfw 100% humidity all the time, because Florida <br> I love it when it's warm. My A/C is set to 80°F, and sometimes I think that's too cold. </br></br></br>  <br>they don't drill into your arm.<br>Also, they're delicious.</br></br>  <br> I don't know what edgy means </br>  <br> Cicada-flavored Ice Cream A Hit <br> suicide rates all time high </br></br>  <br> I'm edgy.  <br><br>Your embarradasing yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> 2 year high <br> all time high <br>no.</br></br></br>  <br>Where i'm from we get higher temperatures, i dont know if i got used to it but use a fan. During noon close all windows and try to make the house as shady as possible.</br>  After what happened during this year's winter, I never want winter to happen again. Fuck winter.    <br>Are Koreans immune to these or does it kill them too?</br>  <br>It will.<br>Seeing how hot this summer is, winter will be extra cold again.</br></br>   tfw 49° <br><br>you niggas know nothing</br></br>  <br>Humid heat is the worst. You're not human.</br>  Winter is much better than summer. In the winter when it gets really cold you can just add layers upon layers or just wrap up in a blanket. There's no end to the amount you can use.<br>In the summer though there's only so much you can shed before you start to break laws. Even in the comfort of your own home it's not like you can shed forever.<br><br>There are a bunch of other things that make it better though. Of course, Autumn/Spring are much better.</br></br></br>  <br>Do koreans die to fans or something?</br>  <br>Koreans have a superstition that having a fan on and pointed at you all night while you sleep can kill you.</br>  <br>That doesn't even make the least bit of sense, but okay.</br>  <br>This makes sense logically but it's not true. It's pretty difficult to stay warm when the temperature's subzero, and it's not like your face and hands are going to be sufficiently covered. Being really sweaty &gt; constantly shivering</br>  <br>Of course it doesn't. But all cultures have some kind of superstition that doesn't make the least bit of sense, yet is widely believed anyway.</br>  BUT WHY SPEND 300$ ON IT YEAH IT LOOKS COOL BUT IT DOESNT EVEN DO ANYTHING YOU CANT HAVE FOR 30$  <br>Nah, get decent gloves and your hands will be fine. Face is a little tricky but a thick hat can cover your ears and you'll be good unless there's heavy windchill blowing at you. If you still got face problems you can wear a skii mask for maximum comfy and warmth.</br>  <br>Pretty sure America doesn't. We just have isolated pockets of conspiratards who believe in inane shit similar to that, nothing widespread.</br>  <br>Yeah I don't get it.<br><br>Like in Winter when it's 27°c in my room I'm dying too hot open the windows. <br><br>In summer I set my AC to 27°c aka 80F and I'm cold. Probably the way AC works since it blows colder air and it hits me directly. But the thermostats in my room show 27°c. <br><br>Whats even more funny i'm feeling 27°c as cold while it's 40°c outside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do people have more free time in summer ?<br>The whole summer thing is stupid as fuck, you can go online everyday</br></br>  <br>That and you can use hand-warmers if you really don't want to wear gloves.</br>  <br><br><br><br>What i really hate about winter is having to leave a warm and cozy place and head out into the cold and when you start sweating under all those clothes even if its cold outside</br></br></br></br>  <br> heavy windchill  <br>which there is<br>always</br></br></br>  <br>It's a lot easier for high schoolers and college students to post 24/7</br>  <br>I know exactly what you mean. It's like trying to fall asleep. Take off some layers, too cold now. Put them back on, now you're sweating again.</br>  <br> you start sweating under all those clothes even if its cold outside <br><br>If only you could take off your coat</br></br></br>  <br> mfw the warmest place here is -35 degrees celcius <br>Kill me</br></br>  <br>Where do you live, Mars?</br>  <br>vostok station medic</br>  <br>And then freeze to death in seconds, yeah, fuck that.</br>  <br><br>Get a really warm scarf. Like real wool, not the synthetic stuff. My mother knitted me a hat and scarf, and I can't even wear it often during the winter, because it's so thick and warm. I get like a weeks worth out of it a year, but it's worth it if I ever need to walk anywhere really far or stand out in the cold for long time.<br><br><br>Shouldn't you be researching at your research base in Antarctica instead of shitposting?</br></br></br></br></br>     mfw it hits around/over 30°c   <br><br>But it's the ice cream of the future.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck do these things work?</br>  <br>KERO KERO KERO KERO</br>  <br>Take a picture outside your window</br>  <br> yfw allergies are actually a result of an over-active immune system <br> yfw an over-active immune system is probably an adaptive trait to inhibit parasites and infections <br> yfw we're actually genetically superior, we just live in too clean of a world now. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 34C where I am right now.

Luffy already invited him and Jinbe pretty much said he is joining when he meet Luffy again. <br><br>Unless something bad happen to Jinbe he is 100% bound to join the crew at some point.</br></br>  <br><br>Small price to pay for a Monet</br></br>  <br> Mr. JUSTICE getting BTFO <br>yes, more of this</br></br>      <br> Monet will never poop on your car </br>  <br> Unless something bad happen to Jinbe <br>Jinbe death confirmed</br></br>    <br> mfw </br>  Akainu and the 5 old farts are too far detached from reality, they don't even give a fuck when their own people are suffering under the sichibukai.  <br>Someone please appreciate Jean Bart, too. I don't even know why Law asked him to join.</br>  <br>Jinbe is too strong in water. He can command whales which is like a nerfed Poseidon and literally make knock up streams. If Akainu set sail in an armada Jinbe could beat him + his fleet solo.

I know I am!, Law and Luffy took out Doffy and are now going in for the kill on Kaido which means Kidd has equal game on Shank's head. <br><br>RIP 2 Yonkos, I wonder who's taking Big Mom's place though, I doubt she's even worth the effort, her fat ass will die before anyone can kill her.<br><br>I love Luffy's generation, WORST GENERATION FOR THE FUCKING WIN!</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who seriously think Derossa was HALF as good as Alabasta  <br><br> There will also be retards who'll respond to this post by going "No, it's even better" <br><br>Marineford Babies are the worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Usopp Usopp don't die, find a doctor! <br>It scares me that this gag has recurred in multiple arcs</br></br>  What music do you think will play when Luffy uses King Kong gun in the anime?    What if the reason Zoro hasn't had a difficult fight yet post time-skip is because of pic related, when usopp says that it would take two years for zoro to recover from his wounds inflicted by mihawk, meaning that pre-timeskip, zoro was never fighting at full capacity but now that two years has gone by he is fully recovered from his fight with mihawk  <br>agreed</br>   Kidfag <br><br>suppose it was only a matter of time, really</br></br>  <br>No, it's even better</br>  <br>If they can get Bonney involved and have her turn Shanks into a kidd or Old man then it'll be interesting. <br>Any indication Kidd working for BB?</br></br>  <br>he's saying it would take 2 years for Zoro to even move <br><br>clearly Zoro isnt normal</br></br></br>    <br>Does it automatically mean that when a Yonkou is defeated, whoever defeats them becomes the new Yonkou? Because there's three pirates in Kid's alliance and I think they're supposed to be "equals". <br><br>I'm thinking the whole system will be fucked up. Fujitora is seeking to abolish the Shichibukai. The Supernovas are trying to screw up the Yonkou. I look at this as the three powers being almost if not totally demolished. Like how Law was talking about gears in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br>  <br>overtaken<br>or gomu gomu bazooka</br></br>  <br>Bonney seems oddly adoring of Luffy<br><br>I doubt she'd help Kidtachi</br></br></br>  <br>He who kills the Yonko and takes his territory becomes the new Yonko. So you have to take control of their land and kill them or just take their land and power thus you're the new Yonko.</br>  <br>I was thinking the actual 18th century symposium that played during the defeat of crocodile "into the new world"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qkC<wbr>a90YLiag</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The main issue with Dressrosa, the main difference, is that Luffy did not grow. He was already strong enough to win, his crew was already stronger than Doffy too. In Alabasta each member had to become stronger, Nami learned to control weather, Zoro to cut steel, Sanji fought a tranny martial artist.<br>Dressrosa didn't have a real sense of fear for the straw hats but Alabasta did.<br><br>It is impossible to do Alabasta twice for that reason, that is why Dressrosa is underwhelming. <br><br>Also the DF Awakening was underwhelming compared to the Alabasta reveal of DF imbued objects.<br><br>Also the way Oda set up Luffy learning Crocodile weakness to water was 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou.<br><br>I figure if there isn't immediately a replacement like Blackbeard to take Whitebeard, then the remaining yonkou just sort of take over the turf of the fallen one.<br>You'd generally think there's a replacement, but it's not like this system has been in place for very long. None of them had died before Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know? Now that I think about it Luffy had trained the ENTIRE time on an island full of all sorts of beasts. <br>And guess what? He'll be facing off against Kaidou who will likely be all sorts of beasts. Bravo oda.</br></br>  <br>Is this your assumption or was this stated anywhere in the manga? This is an honest question, not meant to insult or anything.</br>  <br> Law brought Luffy to the island so he knows this too. <br>Bravo anon</br></br>  <br>Not him but it is shown rather than stated.<br>Blackbeard killed Whitebeard and now he's a Yonko.</br></br>  <br>goddamn croc was a weak shit during alabasta, losing to pre gear 2nd luffy. how the hell did he fight people like doffy, akainu, mihawk, jozu during marineford?? alabasta luffy who is supposedly&gt;crocodile could not do that.</br>  <br>because he was underestimating Luffy the entire time<br><br>He let Luffy chip damage him to zero</br></br></br>  <br>As I understood it, it was more like Whitebeard died and Blackbeard knew a lot about the seas and WB's territory because he was a former crewmate so he had an edge on the others entering the New World. <br><br>So you still have to take territories after defeating a Yonkou, yes? It just doesn't get passed on to you. Fishman Island was under Big Mom's protection when it was previously WB's.<br><br><br> I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou. <br><br>Good point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if Blackbeard grabbed Luffy while he was in gear 3? Would losing his rubberness with all the air in him cause his limb to explode? Would he be able to hold it together with haki?  <br>Luffy used haki unconsciously to win the final exchange, since he punched through Crocodiles cutting attack which sliced solid rock the previous time it was shown.<br>Same shit happened vs Arlong.<br><br>The Straw Hat helped Luffy win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>do you actually believe this?</br>  <br>Because Crocodile second in command Mrs Allsunday was a traitor</br>    <br>Power creep. <br>Don't think too much of it, it happens to every shounen over time.</br></br>    <br>Forgotpic</br>  http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>20/working-with-eiichiro-oda-an-int<wbr>erview-with-one-piece-editor-suguru<wbr>-sugita/<br><br> Well, now that we’re in the second half of the story, I think there will be more and more chapters that revolve around the main plot. The Four Emperors will also appear more in the story, so I think you’ll really enjoy what happens next! </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I'm pretty hype if Fujitora tries to follow his commands. Having both a Warlord and Admiral defeated would be some real shit assuming Luffy and Law can fight the following morning.  <br>Two knocked out novas versus a full health admiral. Yep, def gonna happen.</br>  <br>Fuji is just New World Aokiji<br><br>he'll follow them around lazily but otherwise isnt doing shit</br></br></br>  <br>its stated by territory, right after the war when the gorosei are talking i think. BB was in WBs crew for a long time and knew where all thin freshly unclaimed land would be and had crew that could solo cap an island each so it just happened to go to him</br>  <br>I am saddened when I see these threads and I have no recollection of reading some of these pages ;_;<br><br>Perhaps it's my due time for a re-read</br></br></br>  <br> 30% of the story left <br><br>w-what?? theres still so many unresovled things, I don't want it to end too soon :(</br></br></br>  <br>You can't remember a page from two weeks ago.</br>  <br>that page was literally 2 weeks ago chapter, are you sure you arent a speed reader with alzheimers?</br>  <br>30% ends at chapter 1100 or so.<br><br>It's as far from now as the start of the series from Luffy fighting Lucci.</br></br></br>  <br> the following morning. <br>I think this information alone allows us to deduce Fuji is letting them go.<br>If he wanted them he'd have the marines pick them off the ground as soon as the doffy fight was done.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda or one of his editors said OP was half way done back during the end of Skypeia. I'd take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>I'm just glad the Yonko are going to play a more active role now.</br></br></br>  <br>He is NOT going to come after Luffy/Law. He's saying he's fine with not coming back to Marine HQ.<br><br><br>Because Oda can't break muh monster trio, he's too strong and there are too many crewmembers wah wah wah.<br><br>Same shit you see in these threads all the time. They don't read the series, though so they couldn't know half the shit they spew.<br><br><br>Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one.<br><br><br>Neat. But to be around 70% of the story? Hmm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come people are acting like Vivi isn't already part of the crew. <br>Jinbe could have joined and then went on a solo mission, instead he said "he, ill join later." which is a deathflag or at minimum "some shit will block him from joining" flag.</br></br>  <br>he's going to have some Big Mom conflict but he'll still join. <br><br>He and Luffy are blood-brothers afterall</br></br></br>  <br> brothers <br>Another proof he won't join/will die</br></br>  <br>How much do you think there's left of Berserk?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh shieet I somehow missed last week's WSJ release. Well another example is Kuzan/Aokiji's appearance post-timeskip</br></br></br>  <br> Nearly $25million a year <br><br>Holy crap</br></br></br>  <br>Caribou will tell<br> that man <br>That Shirahoshi is Poseidon.<br>That's where Jinbe, strongest fish man in the world (deathflag), will get blocked from ever joining.</br></br></br></br>  Would I be right in saying his reintroduction was ambiguous?<br><br>Capone working for Mam is a boring to me since we already have the yonkou underling dynamic with Drake/Kaidou.<br>I'd much prefer Capone to be striking out alone.<br><br>Why would he be after Ceasar though?<br>Ceasar probably has wares that can be traded on the black market.<br>I think it would be interesting to see Capone make a play for becoming the top Broker...might also suit his namesake since it's a black market vibe.<br>Does this sound like headcannon or a reasonable theory? I can never tell when it's my own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no idea, miura does what he wants. I just hope the announcement about monthly releases holds up, and we actually do get monthly chapters.</br>  <br>He was on Big Mom's fucking ship.</br>  <br>Sabo seems to be doing just fine though</br>  <br>law said to survive in the new world you either take out a yonko or join a yonko, and no supernova can take them out alone, so I think its fine if he's working for big mom, just makes him a less important character compared to say captain kid. drake is ambiguous, he might join luffy/law</br>  <br>Sabo has more deathflags than any other character in One Piece.<br><br>He even did and said the exact same things Ace did before he died almost word for word, and Zoro explicitly commented on this.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Caribou tells Kizaru?<br>Think about it, Kizaru killed the sun pirates. Kizaru is Proven 100% loyal to tenryubito, and the tenryubito are actively trying to acquire the ancient weapons as Proven at water 7<br>Jinbe vs Kizaru means no Jinbe cremate</br></br></br>  <br> He was on <br>near, He was NEAR Big Mom's ship</br></br>  <br><br>Which translation is this.<br>Seems decent.</br></br></br>  <br>that's assuming they actually parallel 100%<br><br>I doubt they do.

All the CP9 agents were close friends with their assassination target.<br><br>you are falsely telling me what I am arguing.

Your theory holds no water either way</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu Gomu no Autism!</br>  <br>No my logic explicitly excludes them because they are not close with Sabo in any way, having met him less than 24 hours ago in canon, whereas my logic requires they were close to Sabo for years and years like how kaku and friends stayed with iceberg for like a decade.</br>  <br>My god<br><br>Luffy is a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br>Its completely feasible as it mirrors CP9 being long time friends and subordinates of their assassination target.<br>You are arguing that it is unfeasible even though it was the water 7 saga</br></br>  <br>Except we know he is not.<br>You are either just being antagonistic or very dumb.<br>Luffy hasn't talked to Sabo before today in story since he was like 6 years old, so it violates the logic, as well.</br></br></br>  watch this retard be right, and koala turns out to be a cp0 agent.<br><br>post YFW</br></br>  <br> Except we know he is not. <br><br>That's why it's proof, because it was surprising when the CP9 agents were revealed, and it would be surprising if Luffy was revealed as a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br> mirrors <br>prove that it's a mirror or even happening right now?<br><br>you have no clue IF CP0 is after Sabo in particular or someone we havent even seen yet<br><br>you're just assumin because they're in the general area that they must be linked when Dressrosa introduced something like 30 characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why Sabo? The CP0 were said to have been mobilized to take out Doffy. Shouldn't they be close to him then?<br>Plus, why do you think Oda will follow the same approach to CP0 as he did with CP9. Such blatant repetition just isn't his style. There's a better chance CP0 will be handled nothing like the 9 so all conjectures based on it are potentially a waste.</br></br>  <br> That's why it's proof, because it was surprising </br>  <br><br>She won't be she's the girl fisher tiger rescued. She'd never work for the CDs</br></br>  <br> being the is much of a troll <br>I just feel bad for you at this point.<br>The only CP9 agent who wasn't working for iceberg and also his good friend of many years was Spandam.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not proof, it is well reasoned speculation based on the known modes operandi of another in canon branch of the WG.<br>It could easily be wrong, but it is not "wild speculation," which was the initial criticism.</br></br>  <br>And Jyabura. And Fukuro. And Kumadori.<br><br>Does Nero count too, even though nobody remembers him?</br></br></br>  <br> CP0 is Koala and Hack <br> CP0 is all of Dragon's subordinates <br> Dragon is the CP0 boss <br> they're all conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary </br></br></br></br>  <br> Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one. <br><br>Marfineford and Dressrosa were both just giant arcs about a bunch of new characters fighting each other with minimal character development for the Straw Hats.

For fuck's sake, you don't even have any evidence that there's more than the three agents we already saw in CP0, that they've infiltrated the revolutionaries (who nobody knew was on the island), that Koala is one of them, why Koala would have stayed behind if she was one of them when they were explicitly stated in the last chapter to have completely left the island, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it is well reasoned speculation <br> Koala might be CP0 <br> because she works with Sabo <br> who the CP0 were obviously around to apprehend <br> because of COURSE Sabo is being doublecrossed <br> because he's deathflagged <br> because he's Luffy's brother </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did I state that ALL of galley la were infiltrators?</br>  <br>Because it's not reasonable, it's insane. You have no proof, nothing other than 'parallels', without even any evidence to suggest that the series is following parallels, that the parallels apply in this instance, why they specifically apply to Koala instead of, say, Hack, or anything at all. There's absolutely nothing supporting a single thing you're saying, and the fact that you don't seem to grasp this. The fact that you repeatedly and consistently are getting details of the story wrong is also not helping.</br>  <br>There is substantial evidence that Oda heavily mirrored Alabasta in Dressrosa, though. And he set up a spy agency involvement for the next saga and also revealed Sabo as the #2 rev, had Sabo say the same shit as ace when he left Alabasta as well</br>  <br>my bad<br><br> CP0 is MOST of Dragon's subordinates(not all because then it wouldn't be a perfect mirror!) <br><br> they're MOSTLY conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary(not all of them. Bunny Joe is cool) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora for next Strawhat</br>  <br> a correlation exists <br> therefore, a trend exists and will continue <br><br>You realize Ace was killed by Blackbeard and the Marine, right? And that CP9 had nothing to do with this? So by the 'muh parallels' logic CP0 should also have nothing to do with Sabo?</br></br></br></br>    <br>You keep putting words in my mouth.<br>I did not clack Dressrosa was a perfect mirror of Alabasta.<br>I did not claim that most of the revolutionary army are spies for WG.<br>I did not claim that "most" of São's underlings will betray him.<br><br>Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You keep putting words in my mouth. <br>YOU asked me to elaborate<br><br> Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim. <br><br>has nothing to do with CP0. Not a thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to bait holy shit</br>  <br>You are still relying on straw man after straw man. You realize that Laffite was in talks with WG shown on panel at the shichibukai meeting before Ace was killed and that Teach was Ace's crew mate for years and years before he back stabbed his friend Thatch, right?</br>  <br>then fucking talk to me asshole i'm bored</br>  <br>how's the wife?</br>  <br>There's literally a watermark anon.</br>  <br><br>Was Fujitora always blind from birth or did he get blinded in both eyes by the [swordsman?] who gave him that scar?</br></br>  <br>It's likely we'll learn of Fujitoras past in Wano.</br>  <br>Seems stupid for Ceasar to be valuable in the black market.<br><br>All he has is his bounty or whatever Big Mom's willing to pay. Not everyone can give him an island and the chemicals for Cesar to make SMILES for them. Unless Oda really wants Big Mom and Kaido to fight, Ceasar is not that important and I don't believe Capone has any interest in him besides obeying someone else's orders.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget that he built a nuke BEFORE he had smiles or any real supplies? Dude is still the second smartest character introduced after vegapunk, even without a lab. Plus Big Mom and Kaido seem like the two people most likely to be able to actually give him the stuff he needs. Which isn't to say that Capone isn't working for Big Mom, he probably is.</br>  Was Doffy Tsuru's boytoy?  <br>Have they ever met or interacted at any point in the story?</br>  <br>I want speedreaders to leave</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot, they met once right after Croc was deposed.<br><br>Still a weird as shit pairing</br></br></br>  <br> animefags </br>    <br>She also pursued his crew during Law's flashback. Do you even read, anon?</br>  <br>Still not entirely correct, stop being a speedreader.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, look at these panel layouts and posing. I completely forgot how awesome these were. What happened? All of New World feels so flat and simple compared to this...</br>  <br>This. That water weakness reveal. Such an epic fight. Such a page turner. AAAAHHH.</br>  <br>I forgot about that too, although in fairness to me they never were actually shown interacting.</br>  <br>I disagree, I'd say his crew treats him way more as a captain this arc. They always asked his permission to do things. Franky with the dwarves, Sanji with Big Mom.<br><br>Stop being a powerlevel fag that thinks character development = fighting skill.<br><br>The only true disappointing fight was Diamante, and maybe Burgess. Even Picas actions were on par with his character because in the chapter we learned about his voice, Doffy told him the battle would decide who would be king, that's why he targeted King Riki and challenged his ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is tsuru his aunt?</br>  Who else should i add to this?  Vizanon is MIA  <br> Kuma <br> Croc <br> abandoned <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>Kuma will never be explained.</br>  Does anyone else feel like Kaido is a good guy? Or at least a fallen good guy like one of those Raoh/Toguro scenarios?<br><br>I think him, Rogers, and Raleigh are like Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy. They've already shown Shanks can look like a devil to other pirates that don't know him.</br></br>  <br> Oda is still getting only 2-3 hours of sleep per night. <br>Oda goddammit, stop it. Wasn't the entire point of his last hiatus so he could get out of that habit?</br></br>  <br> kuma <br> crocodile <br> roger <br>roger is dead and still we get the flashbacks of him from rayleigh <br>croco has been shown a lot throughout the series and he is still a prominent character<br>kuma is the same</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about him needs an explanation?</br>  <br>You are kidding, right?</br>  <br>What's the Sanji abandoned plotline? <br><br>And how is Morgan still relevant? <br><br>Also what's abandoned about Kuma and Croc?<br><br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely all high tier pirates are devils to their enemies.</br>  <br>For being the wise man he is it surprises me that he's previously so unable to see the pure goodness in Luffy, despite his being a pirate.</br>  <br>Alvida.</br>  <br>The guy with speed and claws from ussop island</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>Is with Buggy</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I get the feeling that all the yonko are chill and only have skirmishes for appearances <br><br>Hell Big Mom is probably really reasonable besides the people eating thing. Kaido may just be a big friendly gorilla who happens to like fisticuffs</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because he's too strong in the water that he's waiting so long to let him join. If he just let someone as strong as Luffy join off the bat it'd break his Luffy fighting the main villian every arc since Jinbe could crush them.<br><br>As for Akainu I agree, him and Kinnemon are probably the only ones who could beat Akainu with their skills, Kinnemon being with firesealing. (Unless they say fuck it and just like Zoro damage him with Haki like they did with Marco)</br></br></br>  <br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy. <br> the first time we see what the grand line is all about is not worth remembering <br> the first time zoro shows his devotion to luffy is not worth remembering  <br> fucking roger is not worth remembering </br></br></br></br>  Code Geass or Death Note, /a/?  my peenus weeanus  Death Note. The only good thing about Code Geass was the Jibun wo song.  BOKU NI PICO  <br>Code geass, the only good thing about death note was L and he was dead for half the series.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128363605 <br>naruto is horrible, fuck off </br>  <br>Code Geass.</br>  Watch Death Note first, then refer to the manga, THEN watch Code Geass. THEN come back with your verdict<br><br> ten bucks says this scrub says Death Note cause his/her weeb friends said it was good </br></br>  <br>Code Gayass, it's so fucking fabulous!</br>  <br>fuck off I already watched both</br>  <br>maybe death note before they shit all over the series by killing the only interesting character</br>  <br>Code Geass. Death Note was boring after Light killed CIA's wife.</br>  <br>I don't get why that retarded series is so praised. it's one retarded plot twist after another.</br>  Death Note. At least with Death Note they bothered to explain their leaps in logic. Way better than lolGeass.  Death note was more mature and the characters were more real than whatever the fuck code geass did.  <br>Thank God the series ended when L died. I couldn't imagine some bullshit scenario to draw it out like there were secretly 2 prodigies being taught to replace L or some shit and they just hamfist some bullshit plot to make them work together to catch Light. That would be fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Code Geass.</br>  <br>I always pronounced it Code Geese</br>  <br> memecenter <br>codegeassfags everyone</br></br>  <br>First time I saw the title I thought it was Code Grease.</br>  <br>Code Geass<br><br>But i like more DN's art style</br></br></br>  <br> facebook tier image  <br>codegeassfags</br></br>  Code geass since lelouch isn't an overconfident Jew  <br>Either way, anything is better than Code Ge-ass<br><br> I'm getting better at these captchas </br></br></br>    <br> Death note was more mature <br>It looks more mature, it tried to be more mature, it really isn't.</br></br>  <br>But remember.... Whenever an anime attempts to create logic from its retarded plot twists, its mature</br>    <br>Death Geass</br>  <br>DN first part (till l died)&gt;Code Geass S1&gt;Code Geass S2&gt;DN second part</br>  <br>great taste anon</br>  <br>Indeed and:<br><br>CG Finale&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shit&gt;DN Finale</br></br></br>  Death note because it relied more on psychological strategy than cool robots. Not that the robots were bad. Though I like Code geass's mc and ending better. Both had dumb shit leading up to the end though.  <br>I would not be surprised if the author was forced to kill Light.</br>  <br>The manga ending was better than the anime. The shitty movie had a better ending than both.</br>  <br>What happened in the mangoes?</br>  <br> Both had dumb shit leading up to the end though </br>  <br>I think Light was supposed to die from the beginning but not under those circumstances.<br><br><br>No, ending was still shit in both of them. Light falling for the stupidest trap was absurd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Light asked Ryuk to kill everyone. Ryuk starts writing a name in his Death Note, and Light thinks he's won, then Ryuk shows everyone that Ryuk wrote down Light's name. Since Light asked him for help, it means he doesn't have any backup plans, so he's not going to be entertaining anymore. Light flips his shit and begs Ryuk to erase his name, even though he knows that doesn't work. In the end, Light dies pathetically in front of everyone.</br>  <br>DN Finale&gt;CG Finale&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shit&gt;&gt;&gt; Your taste </br>  <br>Wow that's 10000 times better. Was the other guy who fucked up even in the manga? I hated that Light relied on that faggot.</br>  <br>I like this meme</br>  <br>Light's swimming lesson&gt;DN Finale</br>  <br>Yeah, he was there. He doesn't stab himself in the chest with a pen in the manga, though. He just dies in prison.</br>  <br>Huh. All right then. They still go to the warehouse and shit like in the anime? Mello and Near both play their roles like in the anime?</br>  <br>Yeah. The whole thing is more fleshed out in the manga, though. I haven't been able to read the whole arc cause the site I used to read it on has shitty translations for part of it, but the ending is exactly the same up until some time after Light's confession.</br>  <br>https://manga.madokami.com/Manga/%2<wbr>3%20-%20F/Death%20Note<br>Read the Viz version.</br></wbr></br>    <br>Thanks man. Sorry to make you post so much for some random faggot on a Sudanese river dancing forum. I was just curious about any differences.</br>  <br>wow what a cunt. That's a shit ending</br>  <br>code geass is better</br>  <br>I've always thought of Code Geass as a better Death Note</br>  death note manga &gt; code geass s1 &gt; death note animu &gt; code geass s2  <br><br>Code Geass has a better protagonist and ending.<br><br>Death Note has better secondary characters and is more realistic in its world view.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually the Code Geass soundtrack is much better than the OP, so you're wrong (about everything but that too).</br>  <br> Near <br> Melo <br> L <br> Mature <br> Real <br><br>They don't have eye magic powers (save the shinigami eyes) like geass, but you're funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i watched it one day<br><br>it's horrible</br></br></br>  <br>Code Geass is 10000000000x better than Death Note. And I don't even like Code Geass.</br>  *tips anime*  You have to realize that the director of DN and writer of CG are also working on Cabaneli, get hyped for it!  I'd go Code Geass, but that's just me. I couldn't really get into Death Note, but I fucking love CG.<br><br>I'm a random faceless anon on the internet though, so take my recommendation with a grain of salt.<br><br>Watch the first two episodes of each series and see which one makes you want to watch the third one more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By writer you mean Taniguchi?</br>  <br>No, Ichiro Okouchi. He was also famous for writing Valvrave, if anything its<br>content was far more controversial than GC.</br></br>  <br> vlvshit <br> controversial <br>haha. Also vlvshit was a failure compared to Crown even if hipster f/a/ggots gets ass wrecked over it</br></br></br>  <br>I just said that its content (popularity aside) is bound to cause rather strong divisive comments, take the rape scene for example.</br>  Death Note was gay grimdark bullshit, Code Geass was one of the most fun anime of all time. Not to mention CG's setting was fascinating and immersive to the extreme, as contrived as it could be at times, though that may just be my monarchism and alternate history fetishes talking.  <br> rape scene <br>You mean idol slut letting the betamax have his way? That was not rape</br></br>  JIBUUN WO!!!  <br>It's the opposite, actually. I think their minds getting fucked up by Pino was the reason behind this scene, but then this causes various interpretations regarding said scene.</br>  <br>Then I'm not interested. DN director hasn't done something good after that and Guilty Crown was so shitty that I won't watching Valvrave.<br>And I bet that everything good about CG is because of Taniguchi.</br></br>  <br>Don't get too pessimistic. Araki said in an interview that he wanted to give an anime original series another shot hoping that it'll be better this time.<br><br>And Valvrave was as bad as you think, although it does handle some aspects to be better than GC. And GC's main writer was Yoshino, not Okouchi.</br></br></br>  Is there anything in the works for R3, or is Code Geass dying with the Akito release?  How about none both are overrated casual shit.  <br>Code Geass ended with R2. Akito only exist because people kept throwing their money on the franchise after all this years.<br><br><br>How about killing yourself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both are Perfect, its a Tie<br>Death Note 10/10<br>Code Geass 10/10</br></br></br>  <br>This upsets me. I haven't yet seen all of R2, but I have a general idea as to how it ends.<br><br>I'm one of those retards who doesn't like any series I enjoy to end, even if the ending is good and wraps up everything, because I always want to see what happens next.</br></br></br>  <br>Then get out of your PC, your life is the closest you will have to a never ending story.</br>  <br>Plot is pretty shit and doesn't seem to have a consistent theme, the main character is fairly retarded and bland and the show doesn't seem to be 'going' anywhere.</br>  <br> I don't get why that retarded series is so praised. it's one retarded plot twist after another. <br>Yeah, that's why everyone praises it. Code Geass goes full retard and never looks back.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, the main character will find their motivation through a spunky side character and have many adventures :3<br> Don't be so hard on yourself, anon </br></br>  <br> I had a chance to have my spunky side character years back, and after making mistake after mistake I've lost her for good now. I still miss her. <br><br>Thanks anon. I feel better.</br></br></br>  <br>I said it was the closest to a never ending story, I never said it was a good story.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1543<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1542 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting a color of Kobeni and Nanami paddleboarding together.<br><br>Nanami Reference: http://i.imgur.com/g4ixBB9.jpg<br><br>Kobeni Reference: http://i.imgur.com/Qok5pD9.jpg</br></br></br></br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.

You're wrong and will continue to be wrong no matter how hard you believe otherwise.</br></br>  <br>The entire thematic of the WWD has been totally gunned down the past month. It has been blatantly clear that drawags dont give a fuck about the actual waifu shit in the WWD anymore.

Her neck is broken, her right arm is growing out of her back, you are just guessing how hands and ankles work and putting random lines where you think they should go instead of taking to time to learn how they actually work. Your anatomy as a whole is all kinds of fucked up. Also hatch if you don't know how to, it makes it look even worse than it is.</br></br>  <br>There has been no reason for the WWD for a while now.</br>  <br>Yes, please.

I want to request something to her.  <br>Wow thats a damned fine job.</br>  <br>Wanted to practice pixel art.<br><br>I love his character design.</br></br></br>  <br>Just go to the streams.</br>  <br>holy fucking shit anon thats amazing<br> 5 days <br>good work.</br></br></br>  <br>just request it here</br>  <br>That expression says it all: DEAL WITH IT.</br>  <br>I hope so!

I will never have to deal with relationship drama again. This fucking based Earth.</br>  <br> using manbaby as an insult <br> as you say you're in love with a cartoon <br>Anon.</br></br></br>      Requesting Towa (Cure Scarlet in civilian form) being served tea by pafu in her cute human form.<br><br>Or anything of Cure Scarlet. She has the most awesome henshin of all precure so far<br>https://<span>youtu.be/uayY9-k-LGE  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with saying it here? Just request it and maybe I'll draw it.</br>  <br>I really like this idea but I think its beyond my skill. To amend your idea. Monster girls are created through an influx of demonic energy. The sources can vary but if she is turning into a succubus she is probably being turned by another succubus. I will leave it to an artist that picks it up to figure out what a female succubus would do to human female to turn her in into a succubus.</br>  Requesting Mikoto grabbing Misaki by her hair and giving her a hard, electric-charged slap on the ass after a night of rough fucking. <br>Misaki was passed out on her stomach, but jolted into a fierce orgasm by the sudden electric shock so close to her cunt.</br>  <br>Speaking of bunny girls, anyone got pictures like that need color? I finished this pic yesterday during while watching evo and I kind want to color more like this</br>  <br>I got stuff that's not from the drawthreads</br>  Requesting drawfags try and draw your waifu  with a mouse   <br>I lost all respect for you, lewd enabler.</br>  <br>What is it? If no one links anything and I like what you have, I *MIGHT* color it</br>  <br>I've got something from /v/ (not bunnygirls) that a few want coloring.<br><br> GG's Ramlethal x Blazblue's Bullet - Symmetrical docking, somewhat lewd </br></br></br>  <br>is it posted there? Those two are hot. Might check the /v/ drawthreads for that later.</br>  <br>Well it's symmetrical docking, no bunnysuits though. Go color </br>  <br><br>I was originally coloring it, but my skills are lacking and I need to sleep.<br><br>If you could do a better job (or even deliver, since I'm going to bed), I'm sure some'd be happy.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Eli Ayase doing a footjob meanwhile shes's wearing striped stockings and glasses please    Warm-up time: what should I do with her?  <br>Oh that!<br>Sure man, I saw that on the /i/ NSFW drop thread, but only if you can provide me a line art without the shading</br></br>  <br>Sadly it was another request that got filled, I'm not the original artist, I just worked on a basic color.<br><br>Doubt there's a lineart around, and fairly sure the artist disappeared for the night.</br></br></br>  <br>Take her clothes shopping.</br>  <br>Mouse is easy mode, why not  trackpad? </br>  <br>Mermaid shit.</br>  <br>footjob</br>  <br>I don't want to sound like an asshole, but I just don't feel like cleaning up line art, just do something quick to listen to a podcast while coloring. So maybe the artist can provide a clean line art later, then I will gladly take it</br>  <br>Have her do a split</br>  <br>cute as always rori</br>  <br>Nah, I understand - while unskilled I've done a number of colors myself, it really can be a pain.</br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br>Also requesting requests of loli-ish waifus or daughterus and I'll draw them with mouse.</br></br></br>  <br>would my daughteru count?</br>  <br> Dunk tank? <br><br>I'm sorry, the pool picture made me think of it for some reason.</br></br></br>  <br>(the bottom one)</br>  <br>Can you draw my daughteru?<br>http://imgur.com/a/gKT2l#0</br></br>  <br> and I'll draw them with mouse. <br>Why bother if you have a tablet? Would be quicker.</br></br>    <br><br><br>True I got impatient pretty quick, I'll just do them with tablet.</br></br></br>  I can't bump requests, can't I?  <br>thx rori, will be sure to add mirai alongside chronoire when I finally get to that!</br>  <br><br>Not if it's still in the thread. Gotta wait for next thread to re-request.</br></br>  Oh well, guess I'll stick with requesting for now.<br><br>Requesting more girls wearing this type of frilly bikini <br><br><br>Haha, nice!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd love it if you draw El!</br>  <br> Takagi <br><br>I don't even care of she's a mouthy bitch, half the fun would be listening to her try to complain when she's just loving it. More of her is always good.<br><br> A couple hitachi wand vibes would do the trick. </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Fate Testarossa please</br>  <br>Could you do something with shinobu</br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>Thank you rori</br>  Which was superior? Movie or show?  Movie  <br>Depends on what you want.</br>  movie  <br>movie by a gigantic and unsurpassable margin.</br>  The show was better in every imaginable way  <br>this<br><br>not this</br></br></br>  Manga, plebs  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>The movie had better animation, artwork, and philosophical themes.<br><br>The show had a more intricate story, more fleshed out characters, and a more detailed world.<br><br>Both are fantastic in their own ways and have their own unique strengths.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Show, because it's a lot longer, so it's much more of a thing to enjoy.</br>  <br>I want to add to this Anon and say that movie Motoko looks better.</br>  <br>Both were terrible.</br>  Why did Oshii decide to turn a ecchi cop manga about hot robots into a slow-paced art movie about the nature of consciousness?<br><br>Isn't that the definition of pretentious?</br></br>  <br><br>you sound ignorant</br></br>  <br>You sound like you've never read the manga.</br>  cutie Motoko &gt; androgynous Motoko  <br><br>an adaption not perfectly following the source material is in no way "pretentious". nobody would deny that kubrick took the shining from stephen king, and made it into a much better movie than it ever was as a book. the exact same thing applies here</br></br>  <br>i'm so glad it happened the way it did; the manga was trash, the films are great as stand-alone stories, and the series explores a lot of really neat themes/potential drawbacks and benefits to the whole man-machine thing.<br><br> movie motoko is best skeptic/killing machine, series motoko is best snarky waifu </br></br></br>  <br>The Shining was already a horror story, Kubrick just rewrote it to make it more psychological and ambiguous.<br><br>Oshii took a single chapter of a light-hearted manga, written by an author that specializes in ecchi and straight-up pornography, and turned it into something that was supposed to be "thought-provoking" and "deep."<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I love the GiTS movie and series, and even the manga to some extent, but there's no denying that Oshii took something "low-class" and tried to make it "high-class," which to me, smacks of pretension.</br></br></br></br></br>  I once knew a guy who literally told me "if you put GiTS on for a room full of psychologists, they'd end up blowing their brains out" and ever since, it's been very difficult for me to give the series a chance. <br> He also loved my little pony, and spouted /b/-tier memes like "it's over 9000" unironically as recently as 2010 </br>  <br> [taking] something "low-class" and tried to make it "high-class"...smacks of pretension <br>But some of the greatest pieces of modern media were things adapted from something low and common into absolute classics. Mario Puzo's The Godfather novel was a piece of badly written, drawn out pulp fiction that was turned into one of the greatest movies of all time. Claiming that having a base origin lessens the nature of a piece of media is completely retarded, if I took the three stooges and made a cutting-edge avant-garde existentialist play about them that made Samuel Beckett's work look like children's theater, it would be no less of a work of art for its source material.</br></br>  <br>By definition, it's only pretentious if the final product fails to be legitimately thought-provoking.</br>  <br>People would call any "cutting-edge avant-garde existentialist play" pretentious. But people tend to confuse pretentious with "not Big Bang Theory-tier entertainment" (or "ecchi harem-tier entertainment" if you want to make it more /a/-related)</br>  <br><br><br>That makes sense, I guess.<br>I'm not a big fan of Oshii in general, so maybe my bias got the better of me.<br><br>Let's just ditch the argument and have a nice GiTS thread instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm not really a huge anime fan. It's very hard for me to find something I like but I've found that Gits is by far my favorite. Is it worth reading the manga? Also, I've never read a manga in my life.    <br>movie</br>  em movie  <br>What the fuck is that supposed to mean?</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Movie looks better but I'm used to SAC.</br>  <br>Oh damn, I thought you were talking about character designs. Still movie, though.</br>  <br>Is that blonde scarjo's Major?</br>  <br>And you've allowed the opinion of such a person to influence your actions.

Can I just watch Prisma Ilyia Zwei or whatever, the one that's already out, and masturbate to it?
