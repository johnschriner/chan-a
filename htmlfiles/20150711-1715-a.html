[ Post the Yamchas of their respective series.  <br><br> That's Piccolo or Vegeta if anything. Yamcha would be Sanji, not because of power level, simply because he is established as "powerful" and then Jobs for the sake of plot. Basically Yamcha for as long as he was relevant.</br></br>    <br>You are right anon.

In Rokka the maid/princess actually says everyone knows it but they start telling it each other anyway, this was the propaganda video the brothers were talking about.</br>  <br><br>You called her bland and I showed you examples that she is not bland. At this point you're just a hater. I bet you're an Eririfag too, you're just as bad at arguing as they are.</br></br>  <br>White Album &lt; Sgt Pepper</br>  <br> I'll keep talking about her making cute faces, but never actually address the point and just claim he didn't watch the show <br>Ok, enjoy eating your shit. I'm reading a hackneyed novel must be nice when you're retarded.</br></br>  <br>You're just too stupid to see her characterization. Is it because she wasn't constantly screaming at the MC or slutting it up?</br>  What the fuck did I just watch?  <br>only people calling it that are shitposters</br>  I need that fucking dog dead.  <br>The difference is almost everyones read the manga.<br>And the suffering never ends.<br><br>  Also only shitposters call it that  </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that stupid mutt.</br>  <br>It can't be the next Madoka because it won't sell a fraction of what Madoka did.</br>  What do you dudes think of Watamote?  <br>Suicide</br>  <br>She becomes a manga artist</br>  So, in terms of personality type can we all come into agreement that Motoko is INFJ: All about self improvement, while caring way to much about what others think?  I enjoyed the manga more than the anime. She has that nice semi-relatable pathetic-ness. Pretty cute.   tfw in my sophmore year I realized I had a hole in my pants that exposed my scrotum because the underwear I was wearing had a small hole in the same place <br> tfw I noticed it during a powerpoint and the room was dark <br> tfw never know if anybody noticed <br><br>This fucking shit hit way to close to home.

The Instrumentality project can't start until all the angels are dead, and the MpEvas won't activate if they don't have a Kaworu to clone the from. Better yet, convince Kaworu not to be a suicide asshole by giving him a handy and he'll use his angel powers to protect you from SEELE and Gendo. Piece of cake.</br>  <br>She'll learn to love the anal slave decision eventually anon, eventually.</br>  <br>Except SEELE has a hold of him first before he even gets to NERV, so only half of the plan would be effective, enough to start up the beginning of EoE anyhow, with the invasion having a side objective of finding Kaworu/killing him.</br>  <br>Please, I wouldn't regard my waifu as such.</br>  <br>That's why you convince Kaworu not to off himself and use his powers to defend the lilin. He'll take care of SEELE and the MPEvas no problem if it came down to it.<br>Alternatively, break into SEELE headquarters before the show starts and steal Kaworu, then he'll stop the angels from attacking when they wake up and come one by one.</br></br>  this is where i dropped gangsta    I dropped it when it wasn't Boondocks  <br>this cant be real.....</br>  I went in expecting Black Lagoon.

Mounting clear posters with adhesive sounds like a bad idea.</br>  megahouse fucked up  <br>The blank space on the top and bottom bug me. I haven't gotten anything customed framed in years, but I'm sure if you brought in what you want framed (or just photos and a list of the dimensions) any place would give you an estimate. And picking a simple frame would keep the price lower.</br>  <br>I'd have to get a custom made one due to size. I checked out a few of my craft stores, and they did not have a stock one of that size. Might be super expensive. I'll check out that option if all else fails.</br>  When an artist names a pixiv page as 'C88web' as in 'C88webカタログ用', would that indicate that they're going to sell their works on web stores?
