[ We are still reading this right?  I think i know how Misuzu messes with them. It's so amusing.  <br>There are still those sick fucks who ship Jun and Misuzu.</br>  <br> She's a good friend <br><br>Literally the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Because we've caught up. It's a once a day strip, just so happens that when it first got translated there was a huge backlog.</br>  <br>I'm curious as to what Misuzu would have done if Jun wasn't around to catch the molester. Just what could she do, and why does it scare  and arouse  me?</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127957<wbr>481/<br><br>なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

Its pretty damn good.</br>  <br>Will do then I can actually contribute to these threads</br>  Never got to finish it as a kid, so I'm slowly making my way through it now. Just finished episode 13, things are getting pretty exciting. I hope Dorothy and Roger end up together, that louse.  <br>I haven't finished the series yet but I kinda doubt it cuz Dorothy is underage and she's an android</br>  How fucked are you?  <br> Prison School <br><br>I let expel myself.

So does Gohan need glasses, or does he just wear them to feel smarter?  <br> facts <br>Gohan was stronger than Goku at the end of the Buu arc<br><br> not facts <br>Gohan is stonger than Goku or Vegeta after the epilogue timeskip.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except unlike GT and even in Battle of the Gods, there was never any indication Gohan got weaker or Goku's Super Saiyan 3 form was ever on par with him.<br><br>The timeskip in the manga doesn't imply or give any evidence Goku got as strong as Gohan. In the 4 year timeskip after Part 1 in the DB manga, Goku's power and Piccolo Jr's power both barely went up compared to where they were at in the 23rd Budokai.<br><br>And now your saying in less then 10 years Goku surpassed Gohan when there isn't a single shred of evidence in the manga's epilogue that was indicated?<br><br>Fact: you have no evidence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The point here is that you have no proof that Gohan is stronger or weaker than Goku/Vegeta after the timeskip but still claim he's still stronger with nothing to back that argument.</br>  <br>Not the same anon, but explan why.<br><br>To me was just a regurgitated version of Future Trunks with an additional lack of backbone.<br><br>And God, don't remind me of GT Goten.

Especially since they started training with heavier gravity and Kai shit later on.<br> in less then 10 years Goku surpassed Gohan when there isn't a single shred of evidence in the manga's epilogue that was indicated? <br>Theres' no evidence he didn't surpassed Gohan. He was fighting on par with Uub in his base form while he had to go SSJ3 at the end of the Buu arc. Fact : Goku got a FAT lot stronger.<br><br>Then you have Freezer who went to SSJG (weaker than true god) with 4 months of training.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So after Usopp took over Sanji's spot in the monster trio formation he also took ace's spot in the brother trio. Is there anything that god can't do?  <br>He means Ryuuma.</br>  <br>'He' being 'Zombie Ryuuma' referring to the real Ryuuma ? Why would Ryuuma's body remember fighting himself ? I thought he was just talking about the Dragon.</br>  <br>no, no it won't. Zoro is merely impressed by Kinemons unique style but other than that he is obviously much, much stronger.</br>  <br>I love Zoro and Chopper's interactions.
