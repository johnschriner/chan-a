[  Watch the first two episodes of Gurren Lagann <br> Main characters appear to be: little bitch shinji, a big fuckin retard, and a sniping set of tits and ass. all unlikable. <br><br>why should i keep watching</br></br></br>  <br>You keep watching it to know how truly over-rated it is and to mock people who think it's great. Gurren Lagann is above average at best.</br>  <br>here is your reply</br>  Onii-chan!<br><br>Daisuki~</br></br>  ORE NO TURN  <br>MAGIKKU CADOO</br>  <br>Thank you, Ruri-chan~</br>  <br>WATASHI NO TAAN</br>  Neo-  <br>What happened to alladin again ?</br>  <br>Time for Fudo no Dyeuru on Motorbikes.</br>  <br>-s SHOKAN!</br>  <br>He got carded.</br>  <br>Carded</br>  As a longtime browser of /dng/, and a somewhat new browser of the ARC-V thread here on /a/, what's with the animosity between the two threads? Whenever someone says something that the posters largely disagree with, /dng/ has been directing people to the /a/ thread. But when the do the same thing here, they redirect them to /dng/. <br><br>I'm just wondering if there was some sort of conflict between the two threads, or if SOMETHING happened, here. I've honestly been out of the loop for a while.</br></br>   not posting the best girl for a new thread. <br>its like you fags dotn even care anymore.</br>  WHEN?    <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Pixiv makes it hard for me to take Yuri seriously some times. They seem to like the idea that he's obsessed with mochi.</br>  <br>/a/rc-v talks about the anime and some times about the card game which can go on with out people fling shit on each other and say X card is better that X card, from what ive seen people in arc-v thread are some what nicer than that shit-hole /dng/, while as people who ENJOY playing pet decks &amp; having fun /dng/ is where fun goes to die.</br>  <br>If you wanna talk about Nationals or Regionals go to /dng/.<br><br>If you wanna talk about the mysteries of the Ruris, post here.<br><br>Above all else don't be a meta-posting faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll get her spot light soon. Right now it's bikers, samurai and ninja time.</br>  <br>We like to have fun here.<br>You like to be insufferable tryhard tripfags there.</br></br>  <br>Soon after Gon v. Crow.<br>Now if you were referring to when we'll see Reira's smile in-show I couldn't say. That expression is Kaiba Ultra Parallel Rare</br></br>  <br>But the best girl was posted in the OP</br>  <br>In all my time on /a/ I never knew what true love was like until Serena. <br><br>I understand Yuya and Shun's pain of no Ruri.</br></br></br>  <br>Because when /dng/ is bad, as of the recent banlist, it dissolves into mostly shitposting and elitism, and usually a combination of both, like how anything that isn't apparently Nekroz, Qlis, Shaddolls, BA, or Tellars is a rogue petdeck that can't win shit and shouldn't even be played. <br><br>Not everyone at /dng/ is like that, but a lot of them are, whether it's shitposting or not.<br><br>Meanwhile we just argue between who has Serena, Fusion vs. Xyz, and Ruris.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like I'll fit right in, then.<br><br>Trips seem to be dwindling nowadays. Coincidentally, so is post quality, but, eh, fair point.<br><br><br>Sorry, that'll be the last of that from me.

If it goes like the others, she'll come home in the middle of the night, and tell me about how she and Yugo tag duled against an oppressive seemingly amoral force of no more than three security grad. I won't explode with anger or seethe with resentment. I'll tell her it's a great story and i'm glad she had fun. It's great because she's excited, and I',m glad because I'm a lancer.</br>  <br>guards*</br>  <br> mfw I looked up the full article </br>   summary1 <br>Chapter starts with Kawaii and Shu talking.<br>Kawaii kisses Shuu and gets naked (tits not as big as Haruka but silk and pretty)<br>Kawaii says he needs to leave the slut(saigo worst kind of woman) for cheating and that she will love(?) him instead.<br>Shu tells her it's not Harukas fault and leaves.<br>He gets another text from his mom telling him they are coming to visit on the weekend.<br>He closes it and looks at the pictures of Haruka getting fucked in the car.

This manga ends on a fucking cliffhanger. 20 chapters for this bullshit  <br> Shu tells her it's not Harukas fault and leaves. <br>Is she ugly or what?</br></br>  My cock is salivating.  <br>AHAHAHAHHAHA fuck, she won´t even let Shu fuck her anymore.</br>  <br>You forgot the part where he's holding the divorce pen and a knife while crying with anger on last page.</br>  <br><br> NTR doujin <br> surprised that this happened </br></br></br>  <br>devil is in the details<br> At home senpai and Haruka are waiting for Shu on the couch and tell him to sit down. <br><br>- Haruka actually ACCUSES him of always saying he loves her, but never stood up for her and never tried to stop the affair.<br>- After that, they both state this will be a demonstration of their relationship, tongue kiss a lot, she compares both, declares she prefers Sempai, he cums inside, he cums again 2-3 times, Haruka falls sleep.<br>- Last page Shuu in alone on crying in anger while holding the pen and below are divorce papers fully signed</br></br></br></br></br></br>  2ch thread for the moonreader anons<br><br>http://bintan.ula.cc/test/read.cgi/<wbr>nasu.bbspink.com/erocomic/143459927<wbr>6/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  So Shu gets saved by a better woman who cares for him. It's not really a bad ending after all.    <br>he pushed her away</br>  <br>What would be really funny is sempai, the wife, and her end up having a 3some in the final chapter while the MC watches.<br><br>even by hentai standards, this MC is pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Good to see her standing up for herself.<br><br>Shu might do it again...so maybe it's still a bitter ending.</br></br></br>  So it´s ending. Ah man Haruka was really hot.<br><br> When are they all killing each other ? </br></br>  <br>This is begin of volume 3.<br>It's 7~ chapters away from ending.<br><br>We have to see the coworker plot unfold and Haruka having love-making pregnant sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So you saying like 6 chapters until it happens ?</br>  <br><br><br><br> but never stood up for her and never tried to stop the affair. <br>Wrong, he tolld him that he never got angry at them nor stopped them.<br><br>Also him telling sempai and kawaii that Haruka isn't at fault is IS standing up for her. <br><br><br>Haruka is infertile. The doctor said in earlier chapters that Shu's sperm is fine.<br><br><br>Actually it's the author fault for making a third volume when he said the story was ending with the second volume.<br><br>He got greedy and exchanged quality for money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Netoraserare brings pure autism. <br><br>Its a NTR and they take it seriously.<br><br>Go look at the posts on </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't know, but having a child was a big deal for Haruka on volume 1.<br><br>So I'm hoping we see lots of that soon enough. Besides, it's fucking hot</br></br></br>  At least he divorced her.<br>If he was some true beta shit, he'd stayed with her while senpai fucks her.</br>  <br> If he was some true beta shit, he'd stayed with her while senpai fucks her. <br>I kind of agree</br></br>  <br> he doesn't use the catalog <br>cuck spotted</br></br>  <br>So same thing as with to love ru fags, right ?</br>  Even with a whole volume ahead, predictable ending is so predictable.<br><br>He'll never man up, but she will realize that it's not sex with Senpai that make her happy.<br><br>It's sex with senpai with the faggot watching.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A U T I S M<br>U<br>T<br>I<br>S<br>M</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds reasonable.</br>  <br>Wrong author if you look for this.</br>  <br>What author should i look for then ?</br>  <br>I want to angrily thrust my penis into every character's anus. I still like Harkna though hopefully the author keeps what character she had instead of just turning her into a generic cock hungry NTR heroine.</br>  <br>C U C K<br>U<br>C<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll never man up, but she will realize that it's not sex with Senpai that make her happy. <br> It's sex with senpai with the faggot watching. <br>I can kind of imagine that. It'd be like when they first met Senpai at the elevator or whatever, except now there will be a reversal of roles, sort of. Senpai and Haruka aren't having a fulfilling sex life, so she asks Senpai if she can ask her ex husband to watch them fuck. That'd be all, like, thematic and full circle if that happened.</br></br></br>  <br>The author threw away all his originality after magazine asks for more chapters.<br><br>And yes, he is good at storytelling. But not that good.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you have the wrong author. That's probably pretty close to what's going to happen except they split up, she leaves senpai and everyone is moving on.</br>  <br>I doubt she'd ask her ex, it's most likely some fat men, a bigger guy than senpai or a foreigner to do her.</br>  Wait this got animated? <br>The fuck?<br>http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;t<wbr>id=1776130</wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, this series is never getting anal tag or what ? What is this, entry level vanilla ?</br>  <br>Don't bother. It's a crap studio.</br>  <br>It was so bad nobody even cared</br>  <br>It´s really terrible.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Thanks for the laughs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can tell from the thumbnail but I'll still check it out for shits and gigs.</br>  <br>That's not what I meant. I said she'll ask Senpai if she can ask Shu to watch her and Senpai do it.</br>  <br>Yes, the original ending was just signing the divorce and leaving.<br>Flashforward: Shuu happy married Kawaii, he asks her to fuck other men in front of him.<br><br>The End.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your english summary is shit.</br>  <br><br>That is what happens when 70 cucks get together.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Tl:dr ? I am not reading that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice fanfic.<br><br><br>How does it feel to reply yourself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the original end? Source.</br>  <br>Sources?<br> I call bullshit. Shuu won't go through that shit voluntarily again.</br></br>  <br>Like I'm feeling stronger</br>  <br>90% of Netoraserare threads are fanfic.</br>    Did you guys really assemble here, make a Netoraserare thread,..just to complain about the /h/ thread?  <br>what about Exsibisionist, sex outdoor watching by people mybe?</br>  <br><br>Fanfic, didn't you notice yet?</br></br>  <br>This <br/></br>  <br>Senpai and Haruka fucking anymore doesn't even make sense if she's knocked up.<br><br>But she is a slut so we'll have to see if things change. I'm interested.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn´t it basically what every board does ?</br>  <br> he wouldn't make love to a woman carrying his own child <br>tell me you are joking</br></br>  <br>Did they at least get his despair face right?</br>  <br>Why make a thread on /a/ when you got one on  with more info and real discussions ?</br>  <br>Here is better and we have the 2ch thread and nip blogs links, /h/ thread couldn't even find those.</br>  <br>Didn´t you notice second frame ?</br>  <br>I don't know, man. S'not my thing. Fucking pregnant whores isn't me. I'm sorry, anon. Will you forgive me?</br>  <br>Because OP is a faggot that wants to be "first!" by opening threads and posting memes everytime.<br><br>Just report it.</br></br></br>  <br>On /h/ i would just complain about /a/. No difference at all.</br>  <br>I'm not surprised if you're right.</br>  <br>Those are already there hourse before this thread you retard.<br><br>Try searching first next time.</br></br></br>  <br>Because this is not even the first one for this series in particular. <br>Also, the other ones were active threads. While there is like 1 in a month here, there is constant thread (or more) in /h/.<br>Stop complaining newlord.</br></br></br>  So the final moral is that cucks are fucked up people that spread their degradation onto others, infect those around them, end up in a pit of despair alone, and everyone is worse for wear after it to the point that you can't even pity any of them since they're too fucked for even that much?  <br><br>fuck off cuck this belongs to </br></br>  <br>This story is so bad now.</br>  It's long overdue time for /a/ and /h/ to be fused anyways  <br>That's how you live anon?</br>  <br>It's basically don't let your fetishes fuck up your relationships. They're both at fault and are pretty pitiful people. It's probably going to end with them splitting up, senpai going back to doing whatever he does (does he even have a job?), and them moving back with their parents.</br>  <br>Digital version where? I will pay &amp; share right now</br>  <br> Ask question <br> Complaining </br></br>  <br> I will pay &amp; share right now <br><br>I respect and pity you.</br></br></br>  <br>who's translating this? Sub-desu?</br>  Does anyone even know what the fuck is happening in this chapter? Ignoring OP, of course.  <br>Mostly fanfic, bad translations, misunderstanding and autism. <br><br>It would be better to wait.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody  </br>  Newfag here, is this aloud ?  <br>My one true god</br>  <br>/h/ sucks monkey balls. Newfag indeed</br>  Senpai sucks, wife sucks, husband sucks. Nobody deserves anyone else, everyone's terrible, what was the point of this crap?  <br>The point, I guess, is:<br><br>Husband sucks but at least he's selfless about it, blaming himself for everything that happened.<br>Wife sucks and blames Shu for shit she did.<br>Senpai sucks because not only is he openly selfish, he's a home-wrecker. <br><br>Pretty much all there is to it. Doesn't answer your question, but hey, we're all wondering where the fuck the answers are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what was the point of this crap? <br>NETORASERARE<br><br>Some dude netorase'd his wife, then she gets really netorare'd in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  The lesson here is don't let other men fuck your wife or she may leave you. What's surprising or upsetting about this?  <br>It's annoying, particularly because the wife only seems to care about her husband in the end (though only to hurt him) even though she could've said no at any time</br>  <br> Kawaii kisses Shuu and gets naked (tits not as big as Haruka but silk and pretty) <br> Kawaii says he needs to leave the slut(saigo worst kind of woman) for cheating and that she will love(?) him instead. <br>Was this confirmed? I really need to know</br></br></br>  You could tell from the beginning she wanted to please him but she was a filthy slut. You could see since the beginning when she jacks off to the thought of the mailman. Ho's will he be hos. Now it's time to move on to greener pastures.  <br>I don't recall that</br>  Anyone here like manhwa?

I'd rather read an american comic   read manwha <br> it's fucking martial arts all the fucking time <br> involves beating women up too <br><br>every fucking time</br></br></br></br>  <br>From that image I"m going to assume it's korean fujoshi pandering faggotry.</br>  <br> /a/ - Anime and Manga <br> Rule 1 <br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. </br></br></br>  <br>That guy on the right reminds me of one character in that one Saki doujin</br>  <br> martial arts <br> beating women up <br>I see no problems here.</br></br></br>  Noblesse is pretty moe  Rarely.  <br><br>So it's basically even more based than shitty shounen shit?</br></br>  transfer student storm bringer was pretty good, even if the art was shitty...  It triggers me when 90% of the backgrounds are made in google sketchup  from manwha, its a slippery slop down to filthy chinese comics. Dear god, please save me.  This is now a thread about Red Storm  Cavalier of the Abyss is just about the only manwha I'm following, and I'm just in it for the trainwreck.  I read through The Friendly Winter today thanks to the guy who mentioned it last thread. I liked it quite a lot, so thanks mate. It was a good read.  <br>Mikael was best bro</br>  <br>there were plenty of discussion of manhwa before the "purist" fags popped up. Especially when this was still running </br>  <br>Why the fuck haven't you finished this?</br>  <br> you can't hit women </br>  <br>It's a multi-pandering thing.<br>You can read it for the tits if you want, but overall, it's kinda shit apart from the art. Dropped after 3 chapters.</br></br>  <br>fuck off rulesfag</br>  <br>You're wrong. Simple as that. Stop shitting up the thread</br>  <br>I just dislike they hit them in the face.<br>Anywhere, but the face.</br></br>  <br>Abide in the Wind is pretty good and The Pale Horse is absolutely spectacular.</br>  <br> there will never be a "Veritas" season 2 <br>why even live?</br></br>  <br> Anywhere, but the face. <br>PUNCH THEM IN THE BABY FACTORY</br></br>  Read breaker and breaker new waves a few weeks ago, I liked them.  <br>You tell him. We also should post comics like Batman and make threads about weapons and music.</br>  Noblesse? Anyone?  <br>isn't manwha just the way that koreans pronounce manga.</br>  <br>Got bored when the albino twins came into the scene. Maybe I should pick it up again.</br>  Hellper is my current favorite, Subtle disaster is funny as well.  I've only read a few of them: Id, Kubera, and The Legend of Maian. All of them where average. Id was good until it devolved into powerlevels nonsense and the publisher went bankrupt. Kubera was good (and pretty cool because its full color) until the author started shipping. The people translating it are also tremendous faggots that try to get you to use their retarded realtime browser translation extension, because somehow viewing the webcomic on its original page legitimizes the whole thing. Never mind that the extension doesn't work on tablets. The Legend of Maian is kinda boring and I don't remember much.<br><br>So in my experience manwha kinda sucks. I picked up my first manhua the other day and its been much better.</br></br>  <br>Manhua is written literally the same fucking way as Manga, now shut the fuck up.</br>  <br> literally <br>You should stop using words you don't know the meaning of.</br></br>  I like the few manhwa with dedicated efforts but it's a real turnoff that many of them have webcomic-tier quality.  <br>No fuck off with gookshit<br/></br>  <br>Go eat your dog with your shit webcartoons elsewhere you piece of shit</br>  <br>Chill out with that autism m8.</br>  <br><br>Go shit up the thread about Cory in da House if you're so mad.</br></br>  <br>Just because there's a rule breaking piece of shit elsewhere on the board doesn't mean that this thread isn't a rule breaking piece of shit either, fuck of dog eater</br>  <br>Manga and manhua means comics but that doesn't mean that we can post /co/ shit here. This board is exclusive to Japanese comics and animation.</br>  <br>It's better to be an /a/utist than to be a filthy fucking /co/rean. Go fuck off to there or tumblr if you want to talk about gookshit, you're not welcome here</br>  <br>I don't even like manwha, I just think you're a faggot.</br>  We can all agree that Cory in the House is the best anime ever made, right?  <br> right <br>*left</br></br>    I prefer The Sour Life of Jack and Brody.  <br>Chill bro</br>  <br> I DO THIS TO COVER UP MY UNENDING DESPAIR CAUSED BY MY UTTERLY MEANINGLESS EXISTENCE <br>This escalated quickly.</br></br>  <br>at least is better than shit like nisemonogatari, madoka, steins shit etc</br>  https://soundcloud.com/aloearmor240<wbr>/asked-her-whats-her-favorite-anime<wbr>-and-she-said-king-of-the-hill<br><br>this song is pretty relevant</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br> liking spin of shit <br> not watching that so raven with /a/ in 2015 -10 <br> not having eddie as your waif <br>fag</br></br></br></br>      Millennial kids please go.  <br>You're also a Millennial, 90s kid.

The bodies of Carol and Elfnein are also called this.<br><br>The original Carol was born in Europe several hundred years ago. Some time later, she succeeded the will of her late father, an alchemist. In order to find the answer to a question that would take far longer than her lifespan to solve, she began to transfer her memories to homunculus vessels, surviving to the present day.<br><br>Carol only performs memory transfer to those bodies which she deems to be more than perfect, and those which fail to match her standard are instead used as manual labour or as subjects in human experiments.<br><br>As Elfnein does not possess the mole under Carol's right eye, she was originally to be disposed of as a failed product. However, the construction of the Chateau de Tiffauges required extra labour, and thus she was able to avoid her fate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Glad that Garie isn't completely relegated to a support role.

It was still pretty shit how it went down. Naruto remembers her saying she loves him and would die for him and then thinks "oh that means she likes me"  <br>Why are you mad friend?</br>  <br>Don't you have summer school to go to kid?</br>  <br><br>Your life must be pretty sad if you're just trolling /a/ narutu threads, but whatever.<br><br>Contribute or GTFO.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he were to enforce what he said then he would have to delete 90% of the content on /a/.</br>  <br>To be fair he never had a family or anything of the sort to pick up basic social cues from, and spent the majority of his life, even at that point, as the village pariah shunned and feared by adults and avoided by their children to presume that the less positive implication is true.<br>Still retarded, by all means, and if I were to make that sort of a story that's not the route I'd go, but for the standards of this manga it is both feasible and fairly good.</br></br>  <br>"Daisuki" can mean "I love you" or "I really like you." In fact, Kakashi says "I really like you!" to Naruto, who interprets it as Kakashi hitting on him, before Kakashi clarifies.</br>  fuck off  <br>/a/ is dead</br>  <br>But then Naruto himself uses 'suki' in his own, accidental, confession.<br>It's not that good an idea to expect the series to make much sense or have consistency.</br></br>  New page, niggers.<br><br> ミツキ、ボルト、サラダ <br> Sarada, Boruto, Mitsuki <br> 新時代 <br> Next generation <br> 三人一組!! <br> Three-Man-Cell!! <br> どんな任務もよゆーだってばさ！！ <br> Boruto: No matter the mission, I even have &gt;spare time(/it's easy) ‘dattebasa!! <br> なめちゃだめよ！！バカボルト！！ <br> Sarada: Don’t mess around!!

Hell, come to think of it, we have a similar distinction that would make a confession like the one Hinata made possible to misinterpret on the 'I like you/I love you' grounds. It would still take a fucking retard, given the context, to misinterpret it, but if it works in any way similar to the Nips, I can sort of see it happening.</br></br>  <br><br>Every anime is literally misunderstandings</br></br>  <br>Best family.</br>  Fuck off, narutards.  <br>Why do you think they're dying out?</br>  Boruto? More like BORINGto.

Naruto and his gen are just another pillar on the ladder, and the next generation will keep going from there.<br><br>He paved the way that a lot of generations before him have been aiming for all this time, but its still nothing like Jesus came down and solved everything. The world keeps going, history tends to keep going, Naruto's generation are just another one much like Jiraiya's generation or Kakashi's.<br><br>Boruto is meant to really demonstrate this theme in certain ways; the respect for the older generation, but at the same time its not just all about them and that was the climax of it all, time keeps moving forward.<br><br>The new will succeed the old, but they must never forget what they were taught by them either.<br><br>Its a story that was in the works before the manga ended, as Kishi's real end to the series. Although "The Last" movie was the end of Naruto really, and the new movie is the beginning of "Boruto". As if to give us hope that it just keeps going and progressing forward, even if we don't see their journey from here on.<br><br>Its like a story about the world rather than a small boy, even if he is at the crux of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kinda looks like eminem with that getup</br>  <br> The new will succeed the old <br><br>That is still a load of bullshit. Hashirama and Madara would have never gotten stabbed by someone like Shin.</br></br></br>    <br>Naruto was something of a prop in that story, since he wasn't allowed to just end it automatically on his own, Sarada had to be the focus instead.<br><br>So they have to create some excuses why he's preforming badly; he's out of practice, Kurama calls him out of shape and not doing too well, its noted that he's holding Kurama back from going wild on everyone and just destroying it all.<br><br>Because he's not the MC he can't solve this one, it has to be Salad. So he has to kind of screw around in those important moments somehow.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madara got stabbed in the back twice. Once by a weakened Hashirama, and again by black zetsu. <br> Hashirama died against literally whos. Probably got killed when he was not paying attention and out of his super healing mode. <br>Sure anon, sure.

I'm a man. That would be too embarassing for me to carry such a girly thing. <br>Apparently they're fighting because Himawari wants to bring her stuffed panda to the inauguration, but Burrito knows she'll end up being too tired and make him carry it for her, which he finds embarrassing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's reached the point where this shitposter is legit more cancerous than the actual naruto fans.<br><br>What a time.</br></br>  <br>So you also visit OP threads? You're fucking cancer, go back to gaia.</br>    <br>He's probably been inspired by those characters, yes.</br>    The thing is Naruto is a magnet for idiots who don't even know how to discuss something properly nor did they watch a lot of series to have a better taste. Why is Gaia considered shit? Because most of their threads are about Naruto or Twilight. Sure I wouldn't care if it was a one thread with normal posts and spelling but most threads are something like:"sasuke is uber kawaii i am going to cosplay naruto at school gambatte" Having more Naruto threads here lures those kind of people who know about 4chan because of "funny images and jokes" and they usually ignore global rule about being underage. Do you see Japanese 2chan anime board having endless discussions and fanwanking about Naruto? No. Why? Because they think its a silly show for children.<br> <br>It's stupid, it's full of plotholes, it's littered with characters that are just plain HORRIBLE, the fanbase is on par with the twilight and avatar one, atrocious fanshippers who watch the stuff only to see which girl will the protagonist that is irrefutably gay fuck first, extremely undeveloped characters and a utterly ridiculous anti hero who's lifeline is deus ex machina, actually, 98% of characters rely on that because Kishimoto can't write above anything what a caveman with a club lodged up his prehistoric anus could.<br> <br>Also did i mention it's very yaoi'ish, thus attracting fujoshi and white knights who follow them, mouthbreathers and faggots? It also it attracts ADHD children, which, no matter how much your mother told you to respect the sick, are not wanted on /a/ and should just die off like the waste of resources they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He still has a long way to go.</br>  Narutards lately have been flocking to 4chan due to its somewhat recent mainstream popularity, and they bring with them their overinflated sense of entitlement. Which explains why those idiots have been trying to force /a/ to like, accept and embrace Naruto and Naruto threads. Now now, it’s true we used to discuss Naruto in the past, once a month, even if we still generally hated it. However, all this ended up accomplishing was attracting horrible narutards like the two of you to /a/, from places like Narutofan and Gaia, even more so in the last 6 months to 1 year. Always trolling other threads and calling everything else moeshit, spamming threads you don’t like, not conforming to the most basic /a/ standards and generally making the board a shittier place for everyone. It really was about time we took a stand. We learned from that mistake after all, and don't plan on letting /a/ get even shittier by incurring on the risk of attracting more shitposting narutard trolls like you.<br> <br>We're not the ones trying to change /a/. You are. And this is pointless - /a/ will never change by the hands of anyone else but moot. Enjoy your endless futile, saged, spammed, imagebombed threads, forever and ever, since now you're also in this place forever. Or until you get too asspained to continue.</br></br>  <br>I dunno. I find the retards kind of comfortable. Their complaining really livens up the place.</br>  reminder  Moe, moe shows, the moe "culture" as a whole is tolerated, accepted and embraced on /a/ by a large part of it’s userbase, whether you like it or not. Even those like myself, who generally stay away from shows like this, have to fact the fact that they’re undeniably a part of the /a/ culture. Furthermore, moebros keep it to themselves in real life, and don't stray too far outside their own threads on /a/. They annoy me far, far, far less than you trolling shitposting narutoids, which troll everything else then whine, cry and bitch “pedos, moeshit, naruto is a manga too, naruto &gt; your anime” when we point out exactly how they’re enourmous faggots.<br> <br>Moe fans, like other shounen and seinenfags, can be gentlemen and keep the civility when they’re required to, at least on a higher level than narutards. They just have some issues with the way they perceive little girls, while Naruto fans are all terrible human beings who should die in a fire.<br> <br>I hate Lucky Star, and would probably prefer watching an episode of Naruto to that, but on the other hand I would rather have 5 simultaneous A Channel threads than a single Naruto thread, where retards like you proliferate. And I believe most of us feel this way.<br> <br>Deal with it. I'm not really trolling either. Narutards are the number one thing we’ve grown to hate around here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Naruto has the worst fanbase ever known to weeaboo. And they are so elitist... its fucking awful. HOW CAN SOMEONE BE ELITIST OVER THE WORST SHONENSHIT?<br> <br>I MEAN, COME ON, other fanbases are at least aware of their shows flaws:<br> <br>883 Fractale fans know their show is horrible<br>Deadman Wonderland fans know their show is horrible<br>Elfen Lied fans know their show is horrible<br> <br>Narutards don't. But its just a few samefags trying to force their ideas and get the sheep to their flock by spamming the board with naruto everytime they come here (it's the only reason they do, if you pay attention). Those niggers should be permabanned. I mean, at least some Elfen Lied fans are vaguely aware that it lethally sucks. Naruto fans get spoon fed shit and act like it's the best chocolate ice cream in the world.<br> <br>Yeah, I watched Elfen Lied. At least I only had to live through 13 episodes of stupidity and retardation. But I'd recommend meth or heroin to someone before suggesting Naruto.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ruining Himawari's cake <br><br>FUCKING KILL HIM</br></br></br>  <br>Gaia doesn't have Nardo stuff anymore.</br>  <br><br>Man, I feel kind of bad for Kishimoto. He's going to have to do another goddamn series, isn't he? I mean, it's just minting money at this point! <br><br>But - Thinking about this - why bother with the movie? Look, the world of Naruto is basically sewn up and guaranteed at least a generation's worth of a golden age. You have Ninja Jesus and Ninja Lucifer working together, and each guy can singlehandedly crack the continent in two. More, they've concluded their plot arcs so there's not really any chance of infighting. (Also, both of them are really young. Naruto is in his early 30s, assuming he married Hinata at 18. He has plenty of years of kickass left in him.)<br><br>What the fuck would you even do in that world? Like, any manga would basically be a big victory lap because everything and everyone is doing great. Any story would have to write around "And Naruto and Sasuke come in to bitchslap the legitimate threat."</br></br></br></br></br></br>    ITT: Narutards who can't accept the fact that the anime and manga are shit and only think its good because it popular. There are thousands of anime series out there, go and increase your power level and discover that for yourself that there is better anime out there.<br> <br>And go back to your Naruto forums if you seriously want to discuss Naruto. Post a Naruto thread on /a/ and its blatant trolling as a shitstorm is inevitable.<br> <br>Any logical person that isn't UNDERAGED would understand this. And don't even think of mentioning Naruto belongs here because its an anime. /a/ is build by elitism and consists of elitists, your kind will never be welcome here, ever. Deal with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And a reminder that the anti-Narutards are 100 times more irritating than actual narutards.<br><br>Narutards:<br> one serious thread every now and then <br>Anti-Narutards:<br> shit up the catalog with troll threads <br> clog actual naruto threads <br><br>And another reminder that no matter how much you make things worse for everyone else (distracting the jans and mods from the rest of the shitposting), you're not stopping Naruto discussion. <br><br>Some of you need to grow up and learn to hide threads you don't like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ITT: Narutards who can't accept the fact that the anime and manga are shit and only think its good because it popular.  <br>Oh the irony.</br></br>  <br>So you also go to gaia? Now THAT's what we like to call cancer.</br>  Taste is subjective, but I'd rather avoid a flock of retards eating shit and acting like it's the best meal on the restaurant.<br> <br>We dislike Naruto not only because it's shit (rest assured it is, quite a metric ton of it), but because it comes hand in hand with the worst fanbase in the history of anime and manga, along with it's incredibly asinine plot.<br> <br>If you're not functinally retarded (which is statistically very probable once you take a look at the kind of people who like Naruto), once you grow up a little and broaden your experiences, you'll come to realize how silly you are now, and how pathetic the convoluted writing in this piece of shit is. In the meantime, this is a 18+ imageboard. Please come back when you're turn 18 or when genetic therapy eradicates mental deficiences.</br></br></br></br>   naruto this <br> naruto that <br>But, anon-kun, Naruto is over.

Make no mistake, it's not like I'm fighting a battle to get you off this forum, I'm just letting you know that you will never, ever be accepted here because your entire fanbase is filled with degenerate scum. If you persist, as many of your ilk do, you will eventually be banned, as has happened in the past. Heed the warning, or do not, in the end the result will be the same: /a/ will not be talking about Naruto this week.<br> <br>Good day, sir.</br></br></br></br>    <br> size of a small house <br>thought u were bullshitting until i actually saw the rasengan wtf kid must have chakra spiralling out of his ass</br></br>  <br>Actually with the right amount of shitposting we can hit the post cap easily thus you would only get a few minutes of discussion but sadly there is no one dedicated enough.</br>  I bet you're a troll, but you summerfags are really stupid so I wouldn't be surprised if you're serious. There are several forums dedicated for shit manga like Naruto, why not go to those?<br> <br>You see, this is a question that's been bugging me for a long time. Narutards keep on coming here, dragging all their shit along with them and FORCING naruto on /a/ by making tons of threads. And they start complaining when they see no one else circlejerking with them with their shitty series, and when we tell them it's because /a/ doesn't appreciate shit tastes like theirs, and that they would have a lot more fun in other places, they decry "ELITISM SHITTING UP MY /a/!" Now this is the funny thing. Elitism built /a/, and it's not their /a/, but elitists'.<br> <br>And what's worse: It's only three Gaiafags making and replying to these threads, samefagging with all their might to make it appear naruto is accepted in the least around here (you can easily see this in every thread ever). Yet even if they try, any naruto thread still gets hit with 80%+ pasta, sagebombs, dubs or whatever. Get this in your head: no one on /a/ likes Naruto except for two or three vocal summerfags who never left.<br> <br>I seriously don't get this. Why do these people keep coming here incessantly and complain that we don't accept them? When would they get the message, and that it's a win-win situation if they leave for somewhere else?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone probably gave it to him or at least their chakra. That or his chakra pool is fucking immense, bijuu or no.</br>  I swear any 8yr old writes better fanficiton than the shit Kishimoto writes nowadays.<br> <br>...AND THEN THEY TOTALLY BROUGHT EVERYONE BACK FROM THE DEAD AND NARUTO FIGHTED THE KYUUBI AND MET HIS MOM AND DAD AND MAKED A RASENGEN WITH HIS FINGER AND ITCAHI AND PEIN CAME BK TO LIFE TOO AND...<br> <br>Every week I think this manga can't get any worse. Every next week I'm proven wrong.</br></br></br></br>    <br>So, you might as well just grow up and learn to deal with things you don't like, like all adults eventually learn to do.<br><br>Go ahead and do that now.</br></br></br>  Narutardo, besides being an unlikeable character with no personality other than “fucking annoying” he’s also cursed to carry the soul of the most powerful demon in the world. I guess it’s supposed to be subtle… but it’s not. The demon is supposed to be the Adversary of the story, posing as Satan because any ordinary nine tailed fox, in Japanese Occultism, is gold coloured and posses some magical abilities, making it somewhat of a djinn – a powerful animal spirit who is neutrally aligned and takes no sides. NOT a twenty store blood red wolf with glowing red, sharp eyes and a toothy grin who yearns for the end of the fucking world! I like what they did with the demon tails in the series, though; the tails indicate how powerful they are, ranging from one tail to nine, but it’s all gone for fucking shit because the demons are so mindlessly evil and devoid of personality and character that it’s a fucking bore fest of astronomical proportions!<br> <br>Naruto isn’t exactly a good ninja to start off with, as the author still thinks the underdog concept is original and interesting. Among his friends is a schizophrenic girl called Sakura who does nothing but punch people as long as she’s not in combat when all she does is scream and pass out. Also, there’s the rival character named Sasuke who is immensely good at everything without trying and is loved by all because his mother told them to be.<br> <br>Only that’s a lie because his mother is actually dead, along with the rest of his family and friends who were murdered by his brother and because of it he’s a bit weird. But no, he’s not just a little weird, he’s emo off the fucking chart and we all know what happens when pretty boys who spill out awesome at every turn - like they took a sip of God’s mouth wash – turn emo. FAN GIRLS OHOY!</br></br></br></br>  <br>But this is a board full of manchildren, adults please go.</br>  Posting some nuruto related pictures, now you can't complain :^)  I was introduced to the Naruto franchise wayyyy before it got so huge, and from then until this day I've been kinda "meh" about it.<br> <br>In my opinion, the arcs in the plotline are constantly dragged on and on with the supposed intention of keeping readers hooked for long periods of time; this technique bores me to no end and I just wind up getting impatient with the story and lose interest in it.<br> <br>The characters generally lack depth; Kishimoto does an okay job of defining their backgrounds and their personalities but they're confronted with so many similar situations it's not like he has to try hard to get complexity out of them. They react the same way with the same attitudes to everything.<br> <br>The story's situations are hardly complex or thought-provoking either. Just an ongoing war between evil and good with arcs that cover different encounters between sides. Sure, other manga series also focus on this theme, but some dive much deeper into the complexity of the scenario and bring up very unexpected events and unforeseen twists. Series like Fullmetal Alchemist, which actually incorporates mythology and historical ties (such as alchemy's medieval roots and characters being linked to important historical figures), do a much better job of making the reader think and comprehend the depth of the tale and how it can relate to the world on a larger scale (ex. FMA makes you think about the human condition, the general stability of the world, the horror of tragedy and the value of family and love, etc...) . Authors of series like that put tons of time and effort into researching themes and using that research to make a story more interesting. It's rather obvious to me that Kishimoto didn't do that very well, if he even did. Naruto doesn't make me think, more often than not it fails to entertain me for the five minutes it takes to read a chapter.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    let me get this straight Naruto<br> <br>for like 500 chapters everyone ALWAYS talked about how the 9 tails is evil and only one person EVER has ever been able to control it and even then not well, and that you shouldn't use it's power but your own but it's going to control you and make you kill everyone around you, hell like 1 chapter ago that scanner chick mentions how evil that thing is, but you want to unleash it just so you can save one person, a terrorist who wants to mass murder everyone you ever loved or cared about and to do this he's willing helping a man who wants to remove everyone's freewill like a Darkseid wanna be, all because he was kinda your friend but not really<br> <br>fuck you</br></br></br></br>    If Obito was /a/, Toneri was definitely /r9k/. <br><br> Why doesn't she like me? <br> Why does she like Chadruto? <br> I'LL MAKE HER MARRY ME REEEEEE </br></br></br></br>  <br>that's why she hides her power levels all the time, anon</br>  Where is loliposter when we need him?  Naruto is a low-tier battle shounen manga. Its art is very simplified and dull, very poor character desing, with samefaces and plain, stoic expressions everywhere (the author OWN choice,the guys got tired of working after 5 volumes, before that he had a good desing that actually required him to work), ridiculous fashion sense and lack of shading, details and gray tones which are consequence of the weekly rush for the time limit. As for the everything else, it’s a very generic story, filled with mary-sues and emofaggotry, and told in a contrived and preachy manner – hell, it’s fully retarded nowadays. There are many series better than this one even in Jump.    <br>Go back to reddit, Narutard.</br>  Shitpost as much as you want, narutard, but the thing is you will never be able to discuss nurutu on /a/ without your thread getting spammed with copypasta, doubles and saged to death.<br> <br>You can call us "elitist" as much as you want, pretend you were here forever and that Naruto was discussed on /a/, defend the plot and characters, call us "moefags" or "wan piss fags" how much you want but you will never be able to have a proper narushit discussion thread on /a/.<br> <br>If you are not an elitist then you have not watched enough anime to post on this board. I am actually going to take the time to spell this out for you because you clearly need it explained. /a/ does not talk about Naruto. /a/ does not acknowledge Naruto. /a/ does not permit Naruto threads. If you want to talk about Naruto then go elsewhere. If you are just trying to troll, you failed. The people saging this thread are just doing it out of duty, not rage. We all know what Naruto fans are like and we all are willing to do what it takes to prevent that from happening.<br> <br>You're very obviously new here if you think you're the first one to defend Naruto and shun elitism. There have been quite a few like you before who spent their days replying to copypasta before they decided to lurk a bit and understand how /a/ works. That is why we don't need to write new responses. We've already had this very argument a hundred times in the past with people even more butthurt than you.<br> <br>Keep being angry, cry more, or preferably get out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shhh.</br>    <br>Well, Naruto never really showed any interest in her before turning 19.</br>  started as Kishimoto doing a story about a kid with no friends. Opened up its serialization with a glaring plot hole that has still never been explained or even acknowledged. The story introduced some moderately interesting side charactersm which in all honesty were still shit and poorly-characterized, but an improvement compared to the main characters, then more or less nullified the backstories leaving the characters bland and uninteresting, and mostly just vehichles for special moves with no real personalities. Naruto, despite supposedly being about a boy learning to make friends, never manage to do so in reasonable manner. Half his "friends" he makes by hitting them until they suddenly forget their childhood full of trauma and decide it's all ok. Then Sasuke took the spotlight with his melodramatic bullshit. Then the friendship thing took the backseat, the uninteresting and convoluted plot took over, and Kishimoto started preaching idealistic nonsense through his characters. Then Sasuke beat Itachi and had all of his character motivation up until that point made pointless. Kishimoto sloppily gave him a new objective, then had Pain beat him to it. Then he randomly threw him up against Danzo and that proved more or less entirely pointless. meanwhile Naruto hyperventilated and twisted his ankle. Then the retarded war bullshit happened and we've been watching Kishimoto empty out his sketchbook full of reject designs and powers ever since. All the while nothing of interest has happened.  Shitposters claim they're so much better than "narutards," but this is what they're actually like.    /a/ was not made for you (casualfags and narutards and stupid people that only watched toonami and entry-level shit). You are here only because /b/ went full retard some years ago and 4chan started to reach in the eyes of the average internet retard (like you).<br> <br>I have a HUGE powerlevel (I read over 600 manga series), and I know a bad manga when I read one; I have developed a proper critical sense, since I’m confident that manga can have a meaningful story and not just be random faggotry about "darkness", some retarded kindergarten bullshit about pacifism and some other fag that is "lonely".<br> <br>I dont care that you have never read a true manga about ninjas like "Path of the Assassin", or that you have never read a classic of Tezuka or Go Nagai, or that you failed to develop a good critical sense by reading whatever manga you have (in fact, we don’t care at all about what the fuck else you read), but at least dont act like a giant faggot and say that "I belong here" and “Naruto belongs here!”, because you don’t. Naruto and you will never belong here.<br> <br>Thanks for reading, and GO BACK TO FUCKING GAIA.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BATTLE NO JUTSU xD xD xD xD</br>    <br><br>Anon, please.

You people can't keep your shit in a single thread, and when you finally manage to get a thread with over 200 posts, all the posts are meme-ridden garbage, comparable to the work of a 13 y.o. who's had too much Coca Cola and can't sleep.<br> <br>The problem is not that you are unable to recognize terrible shows when you see them; the problem is how shitty of a poster you are. You are the same people who post in Elfen Lied threads, and the same people who keep spamming buzzwords like “moeshit” and “hipster” on /a/. Nobody wants to see those threads except you and your handful of faggot friends who came with you from Gaia or Narutofan.com.<br> <br>So please fuck off, and suck a dick. If needed, keep your bullshit in a single /cm/ or /b/ thread. But really, you fags should post this shit on Narutofan. That's what it was made for.</br></br></br></br>    ersonally the line for me was how Kishimoto handled the entire Konoha Invasion. Seriously. you know I could honestly understand Naruto forgiving Pain for everything he did, but if you are going to pound the message "The chain of hatred ends with you" you also have to show that while that is the case, if someone punches you in the face and you decide to be the bigger man and just let it go, people are going to laugh at you, call you a pussy, your face and nose are going to hurt like hell and all in all it's just going to be fucking unpleasant.<br> <br>WelL...WAY TO UNDERMINE YOUR OWN FUCKING MESSAGE KISHI, BY NOT ONLY LETTING PAIN REVIVE THE ENTIRE FUCKING VILLAGE, BUTLETTING NARUTO GET AWAY WITH IT BY CONVINCING HIM WITH SOME HALF-ASSED MESSAGE.</br></br>  Probable substance ray fiction<br><br>foot thumb gun blood fish reward fold word cause probable harmony foot<br><br>brown<br><br>so future so value<br><br>polish slip umbrella different house silver against waiting basin island detail servant cruel thin owner trick beautiful ill happy unit thumb some kettle rate sort humour<br><br>knife secretary make shade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>BAN NO JUTSU xD xD xD xD</br>  We tend to hate it because<br> <br>1)The fanbase - A large portion of them are everything the world thinks of stereotypically as an anime fan.<br> <br>2)The threads - They create a bunched of forced threads on the same topic at once, then freak out when they get saged or trolled even a little and create a dozen more.<br> <br>3)The artwork - Over the years a mangaka's artstyle changes, most people accept that, but Naruto's gets worse and worse as time goes on, at this point most people don't even use the "style" argument to defend it, it's just getting bad.<br> <br>4)The characters - It's full of annoying uneeded characters who never get any real development. In fact, the main characters don't either, instead of developing them, they add a new one. And female characters are underused and mostly ignored.<br> <br>Do I need to go on? There's a lot more. Naruto is pretty bad in my opinion but the point is that people some enjoyment out of it usually try to claim it's high tier manga, come to /a/ and make stupid troll threads thinking it's /b/ 2.0 from the get-go and try to force it down everyone's throats.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Again go soap full air baby parcel tail forward first late while sea garden control ice<br><br>cake food fall fowl till drop sun last dress white medical<br><br>take direction sand stage full cheese structure pleasure<br>education push sock wrong dear black berry carriage wrong camera insurance distribution sound rest canvas bird family drop religion degree card hour<br>straight tree metal street or<br>dress other have wrong system.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Naruto plot is paper thin. It doesn’t take any kind of intelligence to actually figure out what the show is about. It’s about Naruto, and that’s pretty much where the plot ends but the simplicity is covered with thorns, broken glass and stupid, so we’re left with something much less entertaining to waddle through. But I’ll do my best… Varth, pray for me….<br> <br>Naruto is a kid in the HIDDEN leaf village which is a secret place in the same sense as secrets are treated in Harry Potter – i.e. everyone fucking knows where it is so would someone please explain to me why in the holy Mother of Fuck – which I guess would be Mrs. Masturbation – the villages are constantly referred to as hidden? My guess is that the author wasn’t ready to actually explain where this bullshit fest took place and just decided to “hide” its location. About as subtle as the “Secret Military Base 5 km” signs you see on Google Images.<br> <br>Anyway, Naruto has the bad luck of being born with yellow hair and because of this he chooses to be a totally unlikable fuckbag; spreading anarchy and chaos; making damn sure that everyone hates him so that later in his life he can elected leader of the entire town by public election. If you cannot spot the flaw of this behaviour then kindly kill yourself. Just go take any sharp object and have fun. Run a marathon with a box of scissors.</br></br></br></br>  Full please steel west serious<br><br>mind mist loss disgust drawer soap stitch mark island angle responsible left seed responsible good frequent transport<br><br>high strange healthy now behaviour.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Loliposter sucks at his job.  And his lolis are shit. </br>  Meanwhile, there's a poor kid with down syndrome who obsessed over Mr. Popular linkn park fan, so he swears to bring him back even though the linkn park fan has made it clear he will kill -anyone- for any reason as long as it gets him the free tickets to linkn park concerts. In the end, it turns out everyone was actually fighting because thousands of years ago there was a crazy old monk who decided to troll his two sons when he died and told his younger son he would carry on his legacy, making the two and their decedents fight each other for all eternity. But there is an even bigger retard who simply wants to magnify it all for his own "epic lulz" (he even wears a really cheap guy fawkes mask) and wants to put a gigantic get in the moon to troll the entire world. Oh, that is what warrants him the status of big bad, somehow.

Naruto is a sickeningly shallow manga with vapid writing. The entire manga is devoid of subtlety or in other words, Kishimoto is incapable of writing anything beyond grade-school level prose. The manga started with a half-way interesting premise which was quickly brushed off to the side in favor of the usual nonsensical shounen tropes now with 100% more emo and faggotry. The fighting scenes are quite laughable when compared to some of the more decent shounen in that regard and not really worth a comment. Indeed, some people find that shallow, leave your brain at the doorstep simplicity to be the very appeal of Naruto. I call those people fucking idiotic.<br> <br>The guy can't do comedy, can't do tragedy, can't do action, can't do drama, can't write characters, can't draw people, and tries to pass off LOLSORANDUMXD as creativity. He is, simply put, the Stephane Meyer of mangaka.<br> <br>Just to make matters worse, all of these flaws are accentuated by his enormous koolaid drinking, cocksucking fanbase, and his commercial influence is such that until the day he passes away or retires, it is practically guaranteed there will be no artistic progress in shonen manga.<br> <br>In conclusion, the "artist" Masashi Kishimoto is a gangrenous sore on the face of human culture. Let us all pray nightly for his quick retirement.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    The other day i found an anime that i don't think anyone on 4chan has ever talked about or mentioned so i'd like to share it with you. The name of this anime is naruto. The most striking thing about narutois probably the total lack of heroes in the story. naruto is quite far from being the ruthless and tough faggot we are suited to. Full of mental complexes, unreliable, alienated. I wasn't surprised at all when sasuke pictured him as disgusting in her last phrase at the end...<br>The story is well written with a good pace, even if indulges too much in serialization. An Angel came, fight and lost against naruto. It is only compensate by the psychological growth of the main characters. Here and there you feel lost in the plot and the two final episodes, oh well, they are probably the most debated ever two episodes in anime's history. One thing i have yet to grasp was the intrusion of the fourth child. Quite useless for the entire story, I think he was used just to express the "homo" side of sasuke.<br>Animation is superb. Music is great. I'm a kind of fan of Utada Hikaru, so i'm in love with her version of Flight to the Moon. Amazing!</br></br>  aruto is an Anime about a bunch of ninja's who fight each other for no real reason other the fact that they're ninja's and that's what ninja's do. Some times they get along with one another, some times they kill each other, there's no real basis for this. The entire plot line and 99% of the fighting takes place because a over emotional linkn park fan has his family killed by his hardcore older brother who is a huge metal fan and believes in the whole ninja's fight ninja's for whatever reason system is worth killing your entire family for. His older brother goes to a late night metal concert and gets jacked up off his mind and kills his entire family when he stumbles home. The emotional linkn park fan decides that even though he's Mr. Popular at his high school, people do not understand how he's crawling in his skin and his wounds will not heal, therefor he decides to pretty much go rogue and do a whole lot of nothing for no real reason other than finding out just how emotional he can become. Some say he's trying to get linkn park to recognize him in person at one of their concerts as their most diehard fan. He eventually kills his older brother who at the last moment whispers into his ear "I actually loved linkn park" making the emotional linkn park fan even more emotional.  <br><br><br><br> go to college anime club <br> fat neckbeards watching Naruto on crunchyroll <br> Ask them about currently airing anime <br> The say they don't watch fansubs and never heard of those series <br> Several of the series I mentioned were being streamed on crunchyroll, the same damn sight they were watching naruto on <br> some other new members were there too <br> they seemed cool and we talked about decent anime <br>I showed them some of my anime collection on my netbook<br> landwhale president comes in with her neckbeard boyfriend who is apparently the VP <br> She sees new members and jumps up and down.  <br> I'm the closest to her because I came in last <br> she charges me, grabs me, gives a bear hug, and actually says glomp <br> she smells like she hasn't showered in days. <br> Can't breathe <br> another new girl hides behind her boyfriend. <br> landwhale finally lets go of me <br> she talks about how it's great more girls are joining the club <br> she grabs me again and starts groping my breasts, in front of a room full of neckbeards <br> I tell her to stop. <br> she says it's just skinship like in anime <br> neckbeards reacting as you'd expect neckbeards to react to such a scene <br> I break free and run out of the clubroom crying <br> that girl who hid behind her boyfriend before runs after me <br> she finds me in the bathroom still crying and comforts me <br> a bit later we meet with her boyfriend, who gathered up my stuff after I ran out <br> make friends with the two of them  <br> a month or so later hear that the anime club was shut down after the landwhale president and her boyfriend were found by the club's faculty advisor having sex in the clubroom.  <br>That girl had no shame what so ever. There were other incidents with her doing similar things as well. It never for a second occurred to her that she was doing anything wrong groping another girl in a room full of guys or having sex in public. Turns out the core members of the anime club were mostly losers trying to avoid NEET status by taking a couple classes a semester.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off-chan is mai waifu</br>  Just because Naruto is written for 5 to 10 year-old japanese boys doesn't mean it has an excuse to be nonsensical, idiotic, stupid, lacking any internal coherence, continuity or logic, or with horrible characters.<br> <br>Yet Naruto makes a point in rubbing all of this shit in your face. It's just shit. Any piece of children's literature at your local bookstore is better written than this.<br> <br>Now, anyone who's ever been in an American high school will know that fags run around wearing this thing. Usually, I left it at just that, something that fags wore, but hearing its actual name in the translation really made me wonder.<br> <br>Forehead protector. It's literally called a forehead protector. It's not magic or anything, it's a piece of metal on a band that protects your forehead. It's left me wondering, why not just cut to the chase?<br> <br>Why not just call it a retard helmet?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What entered into my eyes was<br><br>A giant word that took over my mind.<br><br>Meat.<br><br>An incredibly overwhelming Meat.<br><br>Leg meat, arm meat, waist meat, neck meat, stomach meat, shoulder meat, cheek meat, thigh meat, hand meat, breasts, shoulder roast, rib roast, beef ribs made from the outer thigh, filet, skirt steak, beef, pork, chicken, sashimi, chicken wings, and breasts.<br><br>Blond hair, dripping wet, cheeks slightly red, a faint veil of steam, two gently swaying mounds.

O__O<br><br>I had a dream i was in narutos hidden leaf village and naruto kept hitting on me but i wasnt interested xD, I liked sasuke alot but didnt know how to tell him, I told him and he leaned in and kissed me O___O THEN I WOKE UP T__T<br><br>:) LETS HEAR YOURS (also fi u wanna talk about other anime stuff feel free to :), try to talk only about good animes, naruto is good, i treid watching other stuff, didnt like, wasnt even in english &gt;.&lt;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Every time Naruto supposedly tries to deal with mature themes, the author ends up writing himself into corners in the most incredibly retarded ways. Take Sasuke's betrayal for example. He was out to get revenge on his brother because he killed his loved ones ok. So how does he handle that? He betrays the only "friends" he has and actively tries to kill them. He finally defeats his brother and has probably the only believable response to that death, he cries for his brother's loss. Well that's all well and good in the end until he finds out his brother killed his clan to protect the lead village and it was an order from them due to the rest of his clan planning a coupe out of spite. So what does he do? He decides to destroy the village, the only people who has really cared for him, basically spit on his brother's wishes, and team up with the person who basically planned all this shit to avenge the brother that died because of him.

It's poor writing, not shipping. I want you to take whoever you've paired Naruto up in your head, and run the same scenario in your head and if you suddenly feel mad about it then you've tricked yourself into shipping bullshit. Then I want you to realize, Kishimoto can't write for shit. Then I want you to realize you can drop the series and no one will make fun of you for it, you will not have to waste anymore time reading it, those two minutes will become four minutes, then six and so on when you could be reading better series like Riki-Oh, Kongo Banchou, or maybe even try learning how to draw or write to make your own series.<br> <br>I care about you /a/ and I want to help you. Except the ones that actuallty try to defend and justify naruto and its fanbase on /a/. These people can go get raped by crusty ass hobos. Other then those people I want to help you /a/</br></br>  <br>Angry that you're confronted with the truth about yourself?</br>  <br><br><br>Okay, look here dumb-fuck. Naruto is a fucking﻿ masterpiece and the only reason why you're not appreciating it as one is because you're too stupid to understand the complexity of it, is that clear?</br></br></br>  The fanbase is angry, retarded and gay, all Narutards have low power level most of them have watched probably less than 7 series like Dragon ball or bleach, most narutards are normalfags (don't have waifus, fetishes, etc), everyone who's seen at least one narutard knows they are 4chan's biggest enemy and cancer, they use words like moeshit, loldeep, they are underage, they can't have an intelligent discussion with other anons, all they do is say "umad", "naruto is great, have u read naruto?" "but why do u hate it?", they SPAM multiple naruto threads at the same time, etc, etc, etc.<br> <br>Naruto faggots openly admit to shitting up the rest of the board. They randomly blame arbitrary shows for their own problems. Shit like the accelerator spam happened because Naruto faggots are infesting the board. If we let these dumb underage faggots run wild in this place, they will bring more retarded underage faggots with them to /a/.<br> <br>There are many threads about bad shows on /a/, and I don't mind. But when it comes to Naruto, I DO mind. This fanbase is the worst fanbase of them all. They really are. You want to know why? Because grass grows, birds fly, sun shines, and you're a fucking headband-wearing faggot with too few braincells.</br></br></br></br>  I'm a 4chan level otaku. I don't talk with you chumps in anime club, I don't read your "anime magazine" with new releases I saw two years ago. I don't need to go to a club full of fat smelly people to watch Full Metal Alchemist all over again. I've got fuckin' live feed torrents of the newest animes you haven't even hear of, and figures from said anime being shipped to my house so I can masturbate on them. Go read your "yowie" on fanfiction.net, I'm downloading loli dojinshi and reading the fucking raws.<br>You keep wearing your naruto headbands and shit, socializing with your weeaboo friends. I'll be walking by, Anonymous. You'll never know that the master of anime had passed you by, because I suppress my power level.</br>  I'm not being facetious or speaking in hyperbole when I say that Naruto is a blatant rip off of Hunter x Hunter. It's not the same as other series which take plot a couple plot points or story ideas from other series and then give it a new spin. Naruto is almost Nick Simmons level plagiarism. We're talking shameless thievery of entire important scenes, characters and character backgrounds, battle mechanics and development. There was a time when no one on /a/ would deny this, but then a handful of cocksucking, loud and obnoxious Naruto fanboys invaded this place on late 2009. But this still isn't up for debate. If we brought in any lawyer or judge specialized in copyright laws, he'd readily agree that the similarities are overwhelming and obviously intentional.  I like Konata because she is a otaku like me, except she has friends. Oh god I wish I had friends too ;_;<br><br>Konata also likes videogames and she is kawaii. And there are lesbians in the show and that's good because I like lesbians and I will never have a girlfriend. Why am I such a loser?!<br><br>Konata is like my dreamgirl she has a :3 face I love that. She is also nice why aren't real girls nice!? I got dumped a lot of times but I love konata and she wouldn't dump me because she's so nice and cool.<br><br>We would play videogames all day and watch Naruto and other cool animes on TV, and I would have sex with her because sex is so good. I wish I could have sex with a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  /a/, I can't help but think that HxH is everything that Naruto tried to be and failed monumentally. It is a legitimately good, and well-written shounen, as opposed to gay ninjas and plotarmor: the manga. While it’s true that their paths diverged after a couple hundred chapters, and Kishimoto couldn’t steal any more concepts and ideas from Togashi anymore due to all the hiatuses, some of their early similarities are borderline plagiarism, and the only reason Kishimoto doesn’t get called out on these more often is because he is friends with Togashi, HxH and YYH’s author, and because of Naruto’s inflated popularity in America.<br> <br>Mind you, Naruto was always bad/mediocre, but it took a nosedive in quality exactly after HxH went on hiatus, leaving Kishimoto without his guiding point. No wonder Part II of Naruto consisted of Sasuke Rescue arcs and fighting old villains again, until Kishimoto finally decided what to write, albeit much too late.<br> <br>Anyways, these similarities are pretty hard not to notice, and when there’s just too many of them, copied in such a blatant manner, it’s hard to call them just a coincidence. Let’s see:</br></br></br></br>  Are you guys seriously going to fill another 450 or so replies with shitposts in an empty thread?  <br> being this mad </br>    Naruto is a gateway anime of the best kind. It's a great series, with a story and characterization that is very well done in most aspects, and which bolsters its strengths with great character development and a dark, complicated plot. Your average anon, hopefully, is intelligent enough to see this as the masterpiece it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is very well thought out and deserves recognition and respect. <br><br>These very aspects that make the anime so deep and mature make it a discussion ground for scholarly gentlemen who engage in every kind of both online and in the real world. The hard-working characters who continue to stand against all odds, the realistic jutsus and well-designed clothes, the whole and everything about the complex Naruto world provides fuel for much thought, and the deep character backgrounds, their dark past and emphasis on revenge, and overall greatness of the series make it fit just right with the refined taste of your average intellectual and his sense of disappointment towards the world’s dull, un-thought provoking choices in entertainment. Exactly the kind of material that brings the intelligent and well-educated together over critical discussion. <br><br>Naruto is basically THE series to attract the highest-tier fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to support the existence of threads discussing the subject, and make sure to give a friendly bump to all Naruto threads to make sure /a/’s elite continue to show their faces here.</br></br></br></br>  - Gon’s best friend and rival Killua is a prodigy and very skilled from a prestigious family. He is the same age as Gon but with a more calm, serious and dark attitude. Killua's nen type is electricity (similar to Sasuke's lightning). Killua however, always remains a likable character, even outside of lolJapan, and his friendship bonds with the main character are portrayed and emphasized. In return, Gon also goes all out to take Killua away from his own deadly assassin family, Naruto goes all out to retrieve Sasuke from his best friend’s very powerful and dangerous mentor. Also, Killua’s electricity Hatsu is copied to Naruto in the form of Sasuke’s Chidori Nagashi.<br> <br>- Kurapika is the last survivor of the massacre of the Kuruta clan. He lives for revenge above anything. The Kuruta clan has a special ability called "Scarlet Eyes" their eyes turn red. Kishimoto combined him and Killua to create Sasuke. Halfway through the series however, his troubles are dealt with without the descent into DARKNESS.<br> <br>- The main protagonist Gon has a father who is a legendary Hunter, but Gon has never met him or his mother. The 4th hokage was also considered legendary and this was present very early in Naruto, and Naruto an orphan. Both series start with the main characters’ childhood where Gon and Naruto are twelve-year old boys</br></br></br></br>  Whoever is rading this thread, thank you.<br><br>It was about time.</br></br>  - The concept of special moves are quite similar. While lots of shounen deal with auras and energies, in this case Chakra is a clear adaptation of Nen. Some of the jutsus, like puppetry, summons and elemental properties, are also present in the Chakra concept. Additionally, put a piece of paper in a glass of water and put your hands on top of it in HxH and you find out your Nen Specialization affinity. Do the exact same thing in Naruto and you find out your chakra element.<br> <br>- Nen training is actual training. Togashi undoubtedly writes some of the best training arcs in all shounen in HxH. This is quite a feat, because those generally suck, and they in fact do suck in Naruto. Chakra training is clapping your hands, using clones to learn faster, fighting your dark persona and swallowing frogs.<br> <br>- Gon is considered oddly special by most people who meet him. He is a very honest, determined and pure-hearted boy who brings out the good in people he encounters, making them friends. He is gifted with an ability to change people and make them believe in him. Same goes for Naruto, which in part II of the manga goes overboard, on this aspect, leading many to believe he’s being written as a mary-sue.<br> <br>- Gon Freecs eventually gains 3 friends on his quest to be a hunter while Naruto becomes part of Team 7 in ninja school and also gains 3 friends, the other main characters, in the process.</br></br></br></br></br></br>      - Both them have examination arcs, Hunter and Ninja. Both exams have a preliminary phase, where the main characters go through a dangerous forest and are toyed with by a creepy pedo villain (Hisoka/Orochimaru), and a tournament phase, where the characters fight each other, to win the approval of the head figure (Chairman Netero/Third Hokage). HxH, however, has series of intelligent and well-written challenges to test various skills, some of the mental ones are even written to surprise the readers. Naruto at best has a a cheerio's annual prize race.<br> <br>- The Phantom Brigade/Genei Ryodan is a band of extremely powerful criminals, similar to Akatsuki, except for the fact that they actually do shit. The leader of Phantom Brigade Chrollo Lucifer has a special nen ability to copy and use any Nen ability no matter what type of Nen it is. The leader of Akatsuki has the special rinnegan which lets him have complete mastery over all types of chakra element. Hisoka, the creepy pedo villain, is part of the Phantom Brigade, but has always had his own secret agenda, and eventually leaves the Phantom Brigade, not unlike Orochimaru and Akatsuki.<br> <br>- At one point, Gon meets Biscuit, a 50something lady which has developed a technique to make herself always look young (much like Genkai from YYH, also from Togashi), hiding her true appearance. Exactly like Tsunade from Naruto.<br> <br>Since Hunter x Hunter is so much better than its ripoff Naruto, why do people still keep with with those gay ninjas?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Naruto is full of shit like that. Why does an assassin trained in silent killing wield a 10 foot sword? If all ninja are capable of having a major and minor element (Fire/Lightning for Sasuke, ect) then why don't all ninja add elements to their jutsu to make them more potent? Why doesn't everybody learn at least the first one or two gates of the 8 Gates if they give sudden bursts of strength with little downside? Why is everybody a genius? Why doens't Tenten have screentime, or a LAST NAME? Why can Earth Ninja's fly when Cloud ninjas can't? If there are so many fucking levels of Sharingan, how did the Uchiha get wiped out? If Sakura is a genjutsu type why doesn't she fucking learn genjutsu? Why does nobody use genjutsu outside of asspull illusions and preggers girl? Why are samurai here? Itachi was a bad guy, then, without any clue, without any trigger, Sasuke suddenly remebers Itachi was crying when in the last 300 flashbacks he wasn't and that Itachi was actually herp derp a good guy. Why does Kishimoto adds shitty poor childhood stories to 90% of his villains? Why do Akatuski members drop without any reason, too fast to later be brought to life and die even faster? Deidara fighting Sasuke? Why? Naruto killing the other akatsuki with the oldest clone trick in the book against a guy who lived a century? Madara effortlessly toying with Naruto and team for hours while Jiraya dies, instead of just capturing Naruto… the fuck is this? Kisame vs Gai... what the fuck. For hundreds of chapters we expect to see some good fight and it's over in 2 moves? Sasuke's team. Why? Why do they have TV's and headsets but no other modern technology? WHY IS EVERY CHARACTER MENTALLY RETARDED?<br> <br>It takes something special to make one stop reading after hundreds of chapters and that was Kabuto's secret "everyone is ressurected" technique. Which can only be defeated with a friendship speech.</br></br>     160 posts 39 soon to be 40 unique ips.  <br> Over half of the unique ips are telling you guys that naruto is shit and doesn't belong here <br>Yet you still insist on having these threads. Leave why don't you, theres nothing here for you narutards.</br></br>  I say Naruto has bad writing and they scapegoat and he starts calling me names. I give reasons and they give shit arguments back and he continues calling me names.<br> <br>I say the Hinata confessing to Naruto hasn't been touched on and he says that all the war takes priority and the romance should be passed and talked about later. BUT THE FUCKING VILLAGE + NARUTO WERE JUST SITTING AROUND IN THE CAMP DOING NOTHING. He still said that war takes priority even though THEY WERE DOING NOTHING.<br> <br>And believes Pain's stupid revive everything is one of the best things to happen + bringing back Zabuza and Haku was a great way to show character development even though their fucking story is over and they had a whole god damn arc to themselves to end their story.<br> <br>This is why people hate narutards.<br> <br> That's absolutely ridiculous and will diminish the entire impact of every single death, namely Haku and Zabuza's which is literally the only redeemable portion in this train wreck of a series. <br> LOL SHUT UP YOU ARE DUMB THIS WAS ACTUALLY GOOD, THEY ARE NOT ALIVE. DISREGARD THE FACT THAT KABUTO INTENDS TO MAINTAIN THEIR MEMORIES AND MANNERISMS. <br> YOU ARE STUPID. LOOK I'M SAMEFAGGING AND NO ONE CAN STOP ME. <br> NARUTO IS MANGA TOO AND SHOULD BE DISCUSSED. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Stop bumping this thread shitposter.   OMG my brother killed my family in front of me, I MUST HAVE REVENGE <br> <br> I HATE MY BROTHER! He comes back to the village, beats the shit out of me, and is only interested in my gay lover. <br> <br> Fuck all of you guys I going to betray you all and join that weird pedo guy that was trying to destroy this village, at least he’s DARK and COOL. <br> <br> WTF, after four years you guys still want me to come back? LOL go jump in a river faggots! <br> <br> OMGWTF, my brother was trying to protect the village by killing my family to stop a civil war between clans!? Wow... that means I've been a complete dick to everyone this whole time! <br> <br> maybe I should change my attitude toward my life. Rather then being tied down by petty emotions I should live a free life. I'll make new friends and create my own renegade ninja group. One that doesn't uphold stupid things like clans or honor, a true ninja life, and just maybe... I can make up for what I did in the past... <br> <br> Naaaw, that would require me to have some type of character development. I think I'll just keep being I winy little bitch and help some 1000 year old guy destroy the world. That would be the cool thing to do. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No.</br>  <br>What is sage?</br>  Would you take it anon?<br><br>chap 2 translated<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/0<wbr>7/08/yahari-light-novel-volume-11-c<wbr>hapter-2/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Yukinoshita narrowed her eyes and lightly glared at me. “…You make excuses for the most pointless things but never when it comes to things that matter. I think that’s somewhat cowardly of you. No one can make an excuse if you do that.” <br> “There’s no point in making excuses. People act on their own the more important something is.” <br> “…I suppose so. That might be true. Things like excuses are meaningless,” said Yukinoshita, as if reflecting on it. <br><br> That’s why excuses are meaningless. Because even those excuses will make you look hateful. <br> Yukinoshita held her body and stood idly. Even so, she didn’t lean against the wall. Like always, she straightened her posture and lifted her face. <br> “…Then, that means I’ll just have to ask again.” <br><br>So it's a question she wants to ask without any excuses?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, but that doesn't look like it's illustrated by akinosora, the undisputed god of Yuifags.</br>  <br>That Miura creeps me out.<br> Sauce? </br></br>  <br> dat detailed teeth </br>  I remind them.
