Remember that this isn't taking into account their toddler years, so really their period of highest sexual activity is from age 15 (when a girl loses her virginity) to 30 (when she becomes gross, old, and/or married).<br><br>So say from 15 to 30, an average girl fucks about 50 different guys over the span of fifteen years.<br>Now C.C.'s Geass power is literally to have people fall for her, so raise the number to 300 guys in 15 years. That sounds a lot but I'm actually being generous, considering her power: that's only 2-3 guys a week.<br><br>Assuming C.C. was born around 500 AD, and modern day is 2018, that's 1518 years.<br>1518 years, divide that by periods of 15 years (highest sexual frequency for girls), and multiply that by 300 men.<br><br>(1518 / 15) x 300 = 30360 men<br><br>C.C. has literally fucked 30,000 men in her life.<br>That's fucked up.<br>Assuming she has sex not just once with a man, but also multiple times with the same men, you can multiply that again by 3-4, and including gangbangs perhaps even higher.<br><br>So potentially C.C. has fucked 30,000 men for a total of over 100,000 times.<br>She's had sex 1/10 of a million times.<br><br>=<br>Oops I fucked up my math.<br>Assuming 2-3 guys a week<br><br>79205 weeks in 1518 years<br><br>so 79205 x 3 men = 237k<br><br>C.C.'s had sex with almost 250,000 men, and assuming she has sex with the same men and including gangbangs, she can have sex 1,000,000 times in total<br><br>=<br><br>C.C:<br>-You can be as rough as you want when fucking her, she just heals right up.<br>-She has tons of sexual experience, she will milk your cock like no other<br>-Can't contract any STDs<br>-Won't age<br>-Won't get fat<br>-"fulfill your contract anon-kun, cum in me"<br>-probably can't get pregnant either</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What will she do if she doesn't get one?<br><br><br>Ok</br></br></br></br>  Can we have Leila too?  <br>what</br>  <br>Nice pasta<br>Do have in mind that C.C. didn't get to use her geass for that many years since she got the code, lost her geass and got tired of all love bullshit.<br>C.C. still best regardless.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think your theory is flawed</br></br>  <br>And I want to tongue her bung hole, but we can't all be winners can we</br>  <br> Most girls fuck approximately ~50 different guys by the time they're 30. <br>It's like you're 5.</br></br>  <br>She would probably get a bit sad, but that ain't enough to get her down</br>  What was her real name?  <br>Unfortunately, I don't have any Leila I second this</br>  <br>I only have a couple</br>  <br> Most 3DPD girls fuck approximately ~50 different guys by the time they're 30 <br>FTFY</br></br>  I did always prefer C.C. over Kallen.

Episode 3 states she has never used it before.</br>  <br>Science is frightening.</br>    Honestly I don't think I could fuck/make love with CC. Not in the sense that she's my waifu, but because she established a very strong non-sexual identity for herself over the course of the story, and the sudden emergence of her sexuality would weird me out.<br><br>I guess it's like thinking about fucking my sister, except I have no problem with fucking my (hypothetical) sister.<br><br>Actually I guess I'd fuck CC too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a tragedy of existence that this amazing zipper technology does not exist in real life</br></br>    <br><br> anus tail <br>I hate this shit, no pun intended.</br></br></br>  And now lets get Marrybell in on the fun<br> Thers no Oz fanart </br>  <br>that doesn't answer why christmas cake exist</br>  <br><br>Huh. I hadn't watched Ep 3 so I didn't realize she had her own Geass. <br><br>I guess that explains some of her insane person actions in the episodes previous to that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because procreation is a natural fulfillment you autistic fuck.</br>  <br>Well, it was implied since the credits of episode 1 showed a scene of her meeting C.C. in a forest.</br>    There are official subs on the akito bd, why has no one uploaded it yet?  <br><br> C.C.'s Geass power is literally to have people fall for her <br>I do not remember this at all.</br></br></br>    <br>Well, the nips aren't gonna upload it. Its a waiting game for now until someone who will upload gets their copy.</br>        <br><br>Yeah that jogs my memory a little bit. Of course I knew she had a Geass, I just didn't remember what it did.</br></br>  <br>Anon I just want to see a pure-hearted CC thread why must you trigger my fetish so</br>  <br>And Oldrin</br>      <br>is it fuckin out???</br>    <br>PSN rip has been out for weeks. Just no one subbing it. BDs just came out, so hopefully we'll get it soon.</br>   Suddenly Code Geass Thread <br>What's happen?</br>    <br>And Oldrin and Marrybell</br>      Good night, everyone.  <br>G'night anon, see you around whenever the next C.C. thread comes up.</br>    <br>She didn't appear nearly enough in that outfit.</br>            I love this Dance.    <br> procreation is a natural fulfillment <br><br>Than how come japan birthrate is getting lower?</br></br></br>  <br>Girls don't look like anime.</br>  <br>Who cares? CC still the best CG.</br>  CC = Cock Craver  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>I haven't watch CG in a long time but<br><br> Can't contract any STDs <br>Is this true? I know she can't die, but couldn't she spread STD to others?</br></br></br></br>  Best girl  <br><br/></br>  <br>This gotta be the most interesting discussion this thread can hope to spawn.</br>  <br>Cock Connoisseur </br>  <br>Cavernous Cunt</br>  <br><br> her name is literally "plop" </br></br>  <br>Ninja CC</br>  All this talk about CC and next episode of Akito makes me want to rewatch the series again. I fucking hope they announce something good at the 10th anniversary  So did Lelouch and CC ever actually do it?  <br><br>Probably</br></br>  <br>Do what? Change the world?</br>  <br>Be smug assholes? All the time.</br>    <br>They're doing it to this date.<br>Lelouch is not dead, we all know that</br></br>    <br> potentially <br>And I've potentially had time in my life to murder hundreds if not thousands of people</br></br>    <br>Shit, I kill millions every night.</br>  <br><br> Do what? <br><br>you know, the DO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is this so hot?</br>  <br>It's not really a Code Geass thread. It's a Code Geass female thread.</br>  Why the fuck is youtube suddenly recommending me code geass videos? Is google fucking watching what's going on my screen?  <br><br>Always watching.</br></br>      <br>Anyone who denies this needs to rewatch the show. It's so obvious.</br>  <br>The sword penetrating his abdomen makes it obvious he survives?</br>  <br>A very survivable wound, shall I pull up reports of people surviving being impaled through their heads?</br>  <br><br><br>And what about the end of Phantom of Inferno?</br></br></br>  is there a new CodeGeass series or something?  <br>Just that movie series.<br><br>And a very dedicated fan artist.</br></br></br>  <br>The next Akito episode is out but subs never</br>  <br>gg subs when</br>  <br> A very survivable wound <br>Also a deadly wound. Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>His death was never confirmed onscreen and a body was never shown.<br><br>It is extremely possible that he is alive and just faked his death. Lelouch is the master ruseman after all</br></br></br>  <br> possible <br>Maybe, but that's not what was initially said.</br></br>  I am not leaving until you fuckers tell me her name.  <br>It was initially said that Nunally was dead, Charles was dead, Marianne really was fucking dead but came back regardless through her Geass.<br><br>You can't trust anything this show tells you. It is quite likely that Lelouch is alive.</br></br></br>  <br> Lelouch is not dead, we all know that <br/></br>  <br>Can't be alive if you're a ghost</br>  So is that new series worth watching?  <br> ___C.C.__ </br>  <br> Non-canon <br>Notice how Suzaku is there too despite Kallen apparently killing him and he now assumes the identity of Zero?</br></br>  <br>It's great and Leila is lovely</br>  <br>Its canon, bro.<br>Also, Suzaku was never shown to have been caught in the explosion. Unlike Lelouch, who died on screen before his sister.</br></br>  <br>Lelouch is probably not dead. We have seen that C.C. was wounded in her flashback in church so it's easy to assume that to truly activate code after transfer someone needs to be mortally wounded (Charles was killed by lelouch in Sword of Akasha before we have seen his code) And until killed that person runs as normal geass user.<br>And to all people but Orange and CC, Suzaku IS DEAD.</br></br>  <br> Charles was killed by lelouch in Sword of Akasha before we have seen his code <br>Actually, no. Charles did that to fuck with Lelouch. During Lelouch's elaborate Geass scene, you notice that the "brainwaves" or whatever you want to call them, don't change to show Lelouch's command takes hold. Just like when he tried to Geass C.C. during season 1. The Code was already active from the moment he got it<br>Nothing in the series implies the "Need to die to activate code" theory.</br></br></br>  <br> Actually, no. Charles did that to fuck with Lelouch <br><br><br>That's the ambiguous and questionable part. He could have easily let himself be enslaved by Geass knowing that his death would activate the Code, not necessarily having to hilariously act out the part like you're assuming. The proof isn't conclusive either way.<br><br>Death seems to be involve quite closely with Code transfers. V.V. died after Charles took his and the Nun was in a pool of blood after C.C. got hers too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>V.V. was already mortally wounded and didn't have a chance to heal. Nun was crazy annd probably killed herself.<br> And in Renya of Darkness, when Shiori got Dash's Code, she didn't die to get it and became V.V. </br></br>  <br><br><br>Yet C.C. says something to the effect that the name of V.V. will continue or that said person will carry on the lineage. I would need to re-read that part and what happened with Dash.</br></br></br>  <br>gg ded</br>  <br>Where did charles's code go to?</br>  <br>Not to Lelouch since he still had Geass</br>  Shinohayu scans are out.<br><br>Man this girl is such a dumbass, funny though. The girls on this match are all fun, hope we'll be seeing them again.</br></br>  I see Saki is still as bad as ever with the awful 3D models.   Shinohayu scans are out. <br><br>Fuck yeah</br></br>  <br> 151cm <br> still in elementary school </br></br>  <br>hmm, we had a translation in the last thread, if someone is interested to compare them.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Since when do they state the blood type of the characters?</br>  <br>or the height - I suppose it's the mangaka giving the fans some additional informations.</br>  <br>Better than being a midget, like this Okinawan girl.

Never. They all bin. Every single one of them.</br>    Lewd.    <br>Anyone buying figma today is an idiot. They are overpriced shit. They came with more stuff when they were half that price.</br>  <br>I want some hand holding nendo hands but the only characters that come with them are shit.<br><br>They should just sell them separately.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, fuck Patrick!</br></br>  <br>Quality has gone up and with what yen is now, you'd be able to buy something ~20% more expensive now compared to a year ago so I'd say that the only thing that has changed is the quality going up despite the seemingly higher price numbers.</br>    <br>That looks dope. Why the horse though?</br>  <br>The line got better though, some of the new figures are much better than the old ones. Saber 2.0 looks like a must have for figma/fsn fans. <br><br>I do agree that the pricetag is getting ridiculous though. I'd understand if they released a very detailed sculpt or something out of their comfort zone (like a mecha) for 6k, but a little school girl with little to no accessories for 6k is really low. And let's not forget their whole exclusive webshop shit too.</br></br></br>  <br>Horseracing?</br>    <br>The yen is 25% weaker than what it was in 2008. The quality has gone up a fuckton since then too. GSC and Aniplex are the only companies with merch booths on overseas cons. Their increase in price is reasonable. <br><br>But fuck their "exclusive faceplate/glasses for only 4.5k more" is complete and utter bullshit.</br></br></br>  K-Onfags, what's the best Yui scale in your opinion?  <br>None because I don't own any of that piece of crud.<br><br>DOWN with Yui. UP with everyone else.</br></br></br>  <br>Alter's.</br>  <br><br>Finally best girl getting what she deserves</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck both of you. Mature women should have pubic hair. If you want to fuck little kids, then go abduct a gradeschooler.</br></br>  <br>Don't many Japanese buyers flip figures shortly after buying them, since they're just buying crap to support a series?<br><br><br>And cost of manufacturing has shot up a great deal.<br><br><br>Alter, followed by Kyoani. Either way you're committing to getting an entire set of Keions. Except for Azuza. You don't need Azuza. Nobody needs Azuza.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mature women should have pubic hair <br>Yes, but in this case, Lala is 16.<br>Do mature artists even draw pubic hair?</br></br></br>  <br>Lala's an alien though. Maybe they don't grow pubes</br>  <br>Or go to Vietnam.</br>  <br> realism in my anime </br>  <br>Why is Yui so fucking stupid?</br>  <br> wanting to fuck 3dpd <br> thinking that lala is a mature woman <br> wanting pubes on a figure that already has a fucking weird juxtaposition of tits and ass with an extremely pedomorphic face </br></br></br>    <br><br>I don't like the open month on the Alter figure. And KyoAni's figure is not in her usual outfit. Oh well.<br><br><br>She's a genius.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>It's not Alter's fault that Yui never closes her mouth!</br>  <br>But it's a turn off, bro.</br>  <br>My dick is never off, bro.</br>  <br>I like the Don't Say Lazy ver.</br>  <br><br>I only own Alter's uniform ver (far right), and I think it's really good.<br><br>Max Factory's swimsuit/santa and Kotobukiya's school festival ver. are the only ones that I would get, everything else is cheap prize figures or chibi shit.<br><br>Also I'm waiting for the 5th aniversary Yui by animaru, the source illustration for that looks amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you insist</br>  <br>That's unfortunate</br>   tfw survived my 8th cancellation on amiami   <br> File <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Everyone except for Mio looks like a raging slut in that picture.</br>  <br>You gotta stop!</br>  <br>Watch yourself mother fucker.</br>  <br>I have Santa Yui, just felt wrong not to have a figure of her in the uniform she wears 90% of the time. <br> tfw stronger is going to release Yui in 5 years </br></br>  <br> Ordering shit  <br> Cancelling shit <br>What is the point of all this?<br>You seem like a poser buyfag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Next time you wont.</br>  <br>Anon, do you say the same thing about men with facial hair?</br>  <br>  wanting to fuck mature men <br>Anon.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what you're trying to imply</br>  <br>noun<br>1.<br>a folder or box for holding loose papers that are typically arranged in a particular order for easy reference.</br></br></br>   artbook delayed   <br><br> with <br>I meant to say 'without' but that slipped. <br><br>I get people telling me women without pubic hair is indicative of pedophilia.<br>The thing is, pubic hair is not hard to manage. <br><br>Would you say a man without facial hair is also indicative of prepubescence?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I get people telling me women without pubic hair is indicative of pedophilia <br>Ignore these people.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to ignore them.

Old ladies cheating.</br>    <br>still shit. unless it's a shota and the neighbor lady neglected by her husband.</br>  Sorry for the blog post, but I just found (30 minutes ago when I was getting dressed) a box with a Madoka nendo, a Reimu nendoroid and a Cirno nendo that I apparently ordered and never opened in my closet. I don't even remember ordering these anytime recently so these have been sitting in my closet for at least 2-3 years now. <br>Have you ever bought something and completely forgot about it?<br><br> I'd post pictures but I'm on my way to work so I can't; was pretty surprised that I found some random nendos but not surprised enough to be late </br></br></br>  Does anyone else think her face just looks fucking weird?  Surely tomorrow will be the day right?  <br>I can't even remember that fags name</br>  <br>I do. Tatsuta is my favourite boat but there is no good figures of her, all of them look stupid and not like her at all.</br>  <br> University undergraduate tutor bang daughter and wife. <br><br>Get both in the end, win-win.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow she looks great. Why is there no nendo of her?</br>  <br>To some</br>  <br>Because people have shit taste and almost no one likes her, and those who do like her sister even more. Poor Tatsuta.</br>  <br>It's not great but it's the best so far and I like the look of Tenryuu's figure. So I might just get her so the two are together.<br><br><br>There's medicchus of Tenryuu and Tastuta and that's it. I'm still hoping every time some new nendos get announced that it's these two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I thought the movie sucked, don't know why my friend liked it.</br>  <br><br>That sucks she has a great design. The only shipgirl I enjoy as a nendo so far is shimakaze and the abyss girls.<br>I wish the poi girl would get a nendo too.</br></br></br>  <br>I only watched it because of that picture that was posted. Wanted to see what that Indominus Rex was all about.</br>  How long does BiJ usually take when using their forwarding service?<br><br>My package already arrived a few days ago according to tracking, but they haven't contacted me yet.</br></br>  <br>BiJ is literally dead on the weekends.</br>  The new LL nendos seem to turn out good. 3 expressions and extra accessory.<br>I hope the Nico training nendo will get her trademark face.</br>  Have any of you guys tried a Kuji before? <br>My luck is always on and off with these things. <br><br>  I got Rei socks from pic related. They're okay I guess.  </br></br></br>      I wonder if all the LL training nendos will get hand holding as an extra so at the end they can all hold each other. Would be cute. Surprised that its not a bonus.  <br>I think that's what they're aiming for.</br>  <br>wheres your proof faggot?</br>  <br>Oh I guess it was more than 8.</br>  How much do 1/6 Alter stuff cost this year?  <br>Disgusting</br>  <br>It's fun to pose them and take pics though. Though so many of them are overpriced.

I should of saved that picture. <br><br><br>Hentai.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Itou Shizuka is a wonder. I was surprised she played Kanzaki from Index until I remembered how she played Kanzaki during the Index-tan specials.<br><br>Yup, she is the perfect choice for Luvia.</br></br></br></br>  Is there a torrent for the season 1 BD? I can't seem to find one.  <br><br>UFO will fix this right? RIGHT?</br></br>  <br>There's a video out there in youtube with translated Fate Zero drama cds  they're crap  but it's kinda funny hearing tokiomi and Kirei wandering at night looking for missing Rin</br>  <br>http://utw.me/2015/04/26/fatestay-n<wbr>ight-unlimited-blade-works-bd-00-12<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>It's been a while, but now I remember it. I did most of the Dojos and the extra stuff all at once. <br>I cant remember if she gave a reason for Saber, or does she just understand him genetically because he is a sword and she uses swords?<br><br><br>But she has Sakura beat in others.</br></br></br></br></br>   not even a single shot of Shirou at his butler job <br> no Flat cameo <br><br>ONE JOB UFO<br><br>ONE JOB</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait Luvia's voice actress also voiced Kanzaki? This makes her better.</br>  <br>Ah yes, based UTW. Thanks anon.</br>  <br>But Shirou doesn't become Archer.<br>Start paying attention</br></br>  <br> Itou Shizuka is a wonder. <br>I like her when she is doing cute stuff.</br></br>  <br>make sure to get the second season come october or november from them</br>    <br>Reminder that Luvia is going to lose.</br>  <br>Rin best attribute seems to be her ass, why does she looks like she has no ass in here?</br>  <br> comic relief character <br> relevant <br>I love her too, but c'mon</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rin and Sakura are only similar though. But Sakura is more seductive underneath it, so she is the real maneater of the sisters, according to Nasu. A fair competition of them vying for Shirou would be pretty intense. <br><br>But it will be like when they let their guard down and their masks go off in Hollow. They did such a wonderful job of showing Luvia vs. Rin, imagine if ufotable amped up the drunken little sisters competition, where Sakura turned Rin into onee-chan sludge with imouto cuteness.<br><br>Or better yet, have Luvia, Rin, and Sakura in the same room together, and watch the European tigresses come out as their masks fall at once. My duck couldn't handle it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well you have notMikiya who will reject Ayako in a foreseeable future.</br>  <br> Rin best attribute seems to be her ass <br>And thigh.</br></br>  <br>Why does Ayako want notMikiya anyway?</br>  <br>Because you are a nigger.</br>  <br>because she's notRyogi</br>  <br><br>Truly the best ass and legs.</br></br>  <br><br>They don't want you to blow your load too much. They have you Rin/Shirou overdose, they gave you Luvia, they gave you Waver. <br><br>They want to savor the hype.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nevermind what I was going to say. This sums it up perfectly.</br>  <br>The episode burned me out.<br>It was just perfect and I feel sad that UBW end now.<br><br>That older Rin</br></br></br></br>    <br>I keep rewatching it, I don't want it to end. ;_;</br>  <br><br>For the Fate route, Ilya herself said she would be there for him. Which was Nasu's way of hinting she'll likely survive somehow to guide him.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense.</br>   tfw slightly worried they're not gonna be able to fit all the best tracks on the second OST <br><br>As much as people gave the music some shit early on, I really want to listen to the next album. There's probably two CDs worth of great stuff for season two alone.</br></br>  <br>Get used to it and enjoy the superior HEAVENS FEEL MOVIE</br>  <br> Or better yet, have Luvia, Rin, and Sakura in the same room together <br>Only would have happened if she wasn't a Matou. What could of been.</br></br>  <br>Q: Will Ayako ever have a boyfriend?<br><br>A: It seems like she wants to find one, but it also seems like she wants to stay single as long as possible... Miss Mitsuzuri is still fully interested in maidenhood, so she’ll probably be shot down soon after she enters college. By a young man suited to black-rimmed glassses, harmless to man and beast. ...I think I’ve seen a photo of those two somewhere...</br></br></br>    <br>No.</br>    <br>I really hope they do more than one movie for it.<br>Even a three hour runtime can't do that route justice.</br></br>  <br>I still don't understand how people think they won't do more than one movie at this point. I'm expecting 3 minimum.</br>  <br>Why is she so insecure around Shirou?<br>She should be more confidant in her sexiness.</br></br>  Do you think she laughs like that during sex?  <br><br> But Sakura is more seductive underneath it, so she is the real maneater of the sisters, according to Nasu. <br><br>That reminds me of when Shirou and Rin imagined everyone in maid outfits. When they got to Sakura, Rin was cutely angry at him imagining her sister that way, but also acknowledging Sakura would have no trouble doing (and succeeding) with romantic roleplay, and forbids it.<br><br>It's telling that she mistook the future version of herself in the Zelretch box scene as Sakura playing a joke. Rin knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it obvious?<br>She's a girl and Sherio is a boy.<br>She's not very familiar with Sherio and lacks of pleasing old men for money experience unlike Rin.</br></br></br>  <br> the drunken little sisters competition, where Sakura turned Rin into onee-chan sludge with imouto cuteness. <br><br>I refuse to believe this happened. It sounds far to ridiculous.</br></br></br>    <br>Because 3 is the maximum amount of movies you can reasonably do.<br>And even the middle one wil be shit/boring</br></br>  <br> 3 is the maximum amount of movies you can reasonably do. </br>  <br>For HF.</br>  I'm not content with that last episode<br>I want more ;_;</br>  <br>They did a movie for each part of KnK. HF isn't nearly as easy to split as that.</br>  What will it take for Case Files to skip ahead until post-FSN so we can get some London shenanigans?<br><br>-Waver being a grumpy weeb<br>-Butler Shirou<br>-Flat meeting Shirou and being retarded <br>-Moar Luvia<br>-Moar dere Rin<br>- Rin and Luvia being NTR'd by Gray <br><br>Just do the fucking casino story already Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because of what? The slow buildup? KnK didn't start feeling like it had a story until movie 5.</br></br>  <br>Because HF is unbelievably flat and boring in the second act. With three movies, the second one will be dud as fuck, affecting the success of the third and ironically best one.</br>   That slap fight <br>Goddamn Type-Moon is so much better when it's being silly</br>  <br>A personal problem for multiple movies would be the massive blue balling I would get waiting the months between movies. A week for UBW was hard enough and if they're great it'll be even harder.</br>  <br> Her bust is slightly too big for her top <br><br>Stop it, dick.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There are a dozen different things that happen in that time span. The people who say it's only cooking are dumb. What days are you including in this "second act"? Because the only slow part was day 11, and even that had really great Sakura/Shirou relationship development, with Distant Twilight.</br></br>  <br>Movies aren't TV. They have to back beginnings and ends. If they wanted to be looser they could have just gone with OVAs. Can you figure out a way to split HF up into a 7+ series like KnK?</br>  <br>This<br>I can forgive them for making UBW grimdark shit to appeal to zero fags</br></br>  Why is he so perfect?  <br>Best fight in the show</br>  <br>You know less about them so they are harder to hate.</br>  <br>The four or five days in which nothing happens but Shirou think about Sakura, cry a little, go help Rin and Ilya, cry some more, then bum around the house doing nothing until Sakura comes to eat Ilya.</br>  <br>Shirou, Flat, Luvia, Rin, and Gray.<br><br>Either the best team ever, or completely disfunctional nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br>Flat would make Rin grind her teeth to dust from sheer irritation at his mixture of ridiculous magic talent and total bumfuck retardation. He'd probably get along with Shirou though.</br>  <br><br>I really think your grasp of the route is confused, because there is never four or five days of Shirou moping. Shirou doesn't even find out Sakura is Rider's master until day 9.</br></br>  <br>I played it once, two years ago, and it bored me to tears. Sue me.</br>  <br> There seems to be something wrong with Sakura, I'll ignore it til something really bad happens. <br><br>This felt extremely out of character. What the fuck,Shirou?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd have to read the HF again, but sure. <br><br> They have to back beginnings and ends. <br>If people know there's it's a series of movies in the first place then they're gonna expect a conclusion in the last movie. If they really feel like it's a problem, then they can just release them weeks apart like a lot of anime movies that have similar goals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily Reminder that If this Holy spear is destroyed Humanity will lose it's dominance of the Earth.</br>  <br>I think he's confused about the middle section of HF where the readers have all figured out that Sakura is Rider's master and responsible for the Shadow but it's another 2-3 days in the game before His Magnificent Denseness figures it out and gets the story moving again.</br>  <br>Everyone gets along with Shirou, except Shirou.</br>  <br>It's okay, Gray can just show it to Shirou and he can make another one.</br>  <br> nothing ever comes out of Shiro/Rin meeting Gray because she always covers her face with a cloak <br>That poor girl El Melon 2 is heartless.</br></br>  <br>It's actually pretty funny that he completely rejects his older self, yet his final opinion of Kotomine is "We gotta kill each other because reasons, but dude's alright."</br>  <br>Not even KnK did stuff weeks a part. Most got put out over the span of a year.<br><br>The point is to create something compelling that's worth attending in a theater and doesn't just feel like it was an episode of a TV series that you spent money to watch.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He had a feeling, but didn't know how to go about finding out about it, much less doing something about it. You have to remember he has good acute senses, but is pretty bad as a magus. Rin didn't understand the situation until later either. It was Ilya that kept the important info about Sakura secret. We find out it was to carry out her duty as the lesser grail.<br><br>Also please don't encourage the guy who hardly knows what he is talking about please. He pretty much admitted he didn't care if he remembered everything wrong but still calls it shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they won't. Rin leaned over the table to push Shirou forehead is now canon.</br>  Ass is fattttttttttttttttttttttttt. DAMN  <br><br>And you have to remember that KnK was redone in several ways to make it work as a series. So if they plan to take a 20 hour route that is much longer than UBW, and condense it into a theatrical format, than of fucking course the way it's presented will be different.</br></br>  ARA ARA<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rLa<wbr>XYE0NO_U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>And the question is how do you properly recut it?<br><br>Like for instance, the rain scene is an obvious one to end a movie on. What if you want to stick a movie or two between that though?</br></br></br>  <br>Can we get some god damned Luvia doujins already Japan? I mean, I enjoy jerking off to Rider as much as the next guy, but throw some fucking variety in already.</br>  Disgusting secondary here, was the Holy Grail War big shit or not? Seems like there was a power jump going to Uni  <br>I wonder if a non!Matou Sakura would've fallen for Shirou while watching him high jump.</br>  <br>Gotta love the boobcheck counter</br>  Honestly I kinda wish they would just heavily retool HF into a sequel to UBW, and make it more about Rin and Sakura then Shirou Sakura.<br><br>But then you get fucked with no Illya and Kotomine.<br><br>I mean you could probably bring back Illya through mage nonsense, but Kotomine is too important.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Small to moderate.<br>It's not the craziest thing to ever happen, but it still gives you some street cred.</br></br>  <br>It's a big enough thing, but the Clock Tower is snobbish and people there only care about what's going on immediately around them.</br>  <br>It was a big deal in terms of what could have happened, but hardly anybody knows about it. <br><br>Modern civilization ended, but since most magi didn't even know what was going on, most won't even think about it. The Grail War was regarded as an obscure ritual some families got involved in every half century or so, but otherwise flew under everyone's radar.</br></br></br>  <br> Modern civilization ended <br><br>Shit, I meant "Modern civilization COULD HAVE ended".</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>then what the fuck counts as "a big deal"?</br></br></br>  <br>Anything involving Aoko, Melty Blood stuff, petty mage politics</br>  <br>Luvia's tits.</br>  <br> then what the fuck counts as "a big deal"? <br><br>Something people actually fucking know about.<br><br>The three families weren't exactly running fucking ad campaigns for the Grail War. They only created the other four Master seats when they realized three wasn't enough, but the idea that the competition was supposed to be fair and open to all was never there originally. They needed four schmucks to summon four other Servants, so they made up all that bullshit about the "Holy Grail".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A Dead Apostle appearing <br>A Dead Apostle disappearing <br>Zelretch poking his head in</br></br></br>  <br>Zelretch showing up at the end of Heaven's Feel and the destruction of the ritual itself all counted as major events at the Clock Tower.<br><br>Other big incidents are probably mostly about Apostles.</br></br></br>  <br>DAA not DA, right?</br>  <br>Arcueid</br>  <br>Yeah sorry<br>The church cares about dead apostles but the mage association probably only cares about the important ones.</br></br>  <br>They did care when Kerry's dad's research made a new vampire.</br>  <br>Well the Heavens Feel is the Third Magic, so it's more that it is a big deal that people just don't know about.</br>    <br>Kiritsugu's dad had a sealing designation on him because his work was getting closer and closer to become fruitful which when it comes to making vampires/immortality, is a pretty big no-no for the Church and the MA</br>  <br>The association was after his dad way before that/</br>  <br>Yeah, Heaven's Feel is a big deal but them blowing up the grail isn't that big of a deal.<br>After HF, there's no doubt that the Association started delving into everything that happened in the war.<br>UBW, they don't get close to "muh root" so they don't give a shit but it's different when Ilya makes shit happen</br></br></br>  <br> hungry Saber and Red Arc <br><br>How horrifying.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a big story.</br></br>    <br><br>Dirty Red.</br></br>  <br>what the fuck is she saying?</br>      <br>That's the Solar Plexus. Medulla is part of the brain.</br>    <br><br> Luvia handled Rin's combo better than Caster <br><br>How?</br></br></br></br>  Tohsaka Rin is a woman without any natural human kindness.  <br>OOOOOOOOOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHOHO</br>  <br>Do you expect Nasu to know this shit?</br>  <br>No luvia doesn't show up til fate hollow</br>  <br>Stop being stupid. They even say it in the fucking fight.<br>Modern-day mages have to know hand to hand fighting skills because magic is weirder in current times<br>Age of the Gods was just balls to the walls magic fights everywhere with no time for fistfighting</br></br></br>  <br>Rin did hit her in the head though. The one making the mistake here is you.</br>   Implying it didn't just end in hate sex one day. <br><br>The real question is who had he magic dick.</br></br>  <br>In Caster's age mages were strictly mages. No close quarters combat aptitude at all. That's the only reason Rin was able to land hits on a Servant.<br><br>Luvia, however, is a modern mage like Rin, so hand-to-hand is beaten into her from a young age. The fact that there are proper Self-Defense classes in the Clock Tower should be your biggest hint at that.</br></br></br>  <br>I can't imagine how buttblasted Caster if Luvia went wrestling on her.</br>  <br>Luvia gets one line at the end of Heaven's Feel.</br>  I think a big part of the appeal of ponytails/twintails is how nice they look when they come down.  <br>Really? What was it I don't recall this at all.</br>  <br>No, you got the wrong screencap.<br>And it would be ufotable, not Nasu.</br></br>  <br>It was her saying Rin should be her maid. It was in the epilogue.</br>  <br>To be buttblasted one would have to be conscious. The last thing Caster would know is the sensation of being carried by her waist.</br>   forklift lady was finally animated <br>almost makes up for completely bungling the rest of the route.</br>  Can Luvia beat Rin in naked wrestling?  <br>And voiced by Tamura instead of Itou, so it's not completely obvious that it's her.</br>  <br>Gap moe is a vast and fantastical plane.</br>   beautiful blonde Swede grill <br> only wants to racemix <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br>  Why does Luvia make retarded sound effects such as 'OHO OH HO' and 'ARA ARA'?  <br>Because they're arousing.</br>  <br><br>Nope, Nasu said the Grail War isn't a big thing like you make it out to be.<br><br>All the smart, actually powerful people avoid it because they sense a scam.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can beat to Luvia and Rin in naked wrestling.</br></br>  <br>What a gorilla onna</br>  <br> swede <br><br>But that's wrong you retard</br></br></br>  <br>Otaku fetishes.</br>  Rin still lost to Luvia despite delivering blows to the stomach and head.<br><br>Luvia confirmed true alpha.</br></br>  Does anybody have a picture of the new Ryougi figure?  Am I just missing it or did we not actually get a ohohohoho in the epilogue?  <br><br>Never mind, found some.<br><br>My dick is very hard, seeing this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Instabuy for me if I saw it in a store<br><br>Even better than the Rin one</br></br></br>  <br>We got ara ara~ instead.</br>  <br> Not wanting The Red Girl </br>  London, somehow not having shitty weather all the time.  <br><br> Instabuy for me if I saw it in a store <br>I'll be pre-ordering.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a fucking second.<br><br>THE SWORDS ARE IN THE WRONG HANDS</br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>welp. there goes money i cant really afford to part with</br>  <br>Yeah, we'll just get 10 minutes of it at best. Season 3 never.  ;_; </br>  <br>How long were the Fate/Zero drama CDs?</br>  <br>Well now I'm not getting it. Thanks</br>  <br>17-19 mins. But remember ufotable are Hebrews now. Faggots counted the soundtrack to the run-time of the first BD box, wouldn't surprise me if they went all "yeah, Drama CDs!" fucking 8 minutes per story. We'll get Clock Tower, Archer's monologue and Shirou saying "trace on" eighty times.</br>  Reminder there's a Fate fighting game where you can play as Luvia.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=c0_<wbr>VspNN9iY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Are you even looking properly? They're in the right hands.</br>  <br>The Rin figure has the right hand on the black sword and left hand on the white sword. It should be the other way.</br>  <br>Oh, the figure. Woops.<br>I'll show myself out.</br></br>  <br>Someone post a webm of that slap fight.</br>  <br>Gotta love Rin's post-HF look. She almost has the same aura about her as Touko.</br>    <br>Thanks.</br>  Luvia is the only good thing about fate shit.  <br> Shirou treats Rin like a cat <br> Those two fight like cats <br>Adorable</br></br></br>  <br> tfw literally Excalispear </br>  <br>Rider is too perfect for Shirou.</br>  <br>It's called Rhongomiant faggot.</br>  <br>look up ''fate kaleid liner prisma ilya''</br>  <br>Takeuchi needs to kill himself.</br>  <br><br>Why would Rin get NTRed?

Flat is the best girl and the superior choice. <br><br>He's like male magus Arcueid.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you really believe that bitch rhymes with adorable?</br>   based Nekosan <br>yes</br>  <br>Rin's left is white.</br>  <br>Wait a second...<br>With those kind of skills she could take caster out in 3 seconds and surely not be knocked out with one punch from kuzuki</br></br>  <br>Luvia is considered to be equal in everything that Rin is in terms of ability.</br>   Sex first before marriage   <br>Luvia is stronger than Rin.<br><br>Rin attacked Luvia's stomach and head and still lost to Luvia despite the fact that head blows usually result in KOs like in boxing but Luvia tanked that shit and wrecked Rin's shit in the end.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou <br> Not Shero <br><br>You had one job anon, just one</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did you two even read what he typed? He questions how Rin didn't take down caster quicker and lost to Kuzuki with a single punch and you start talking about Luvia.<br><br><br> you can stay over <br> assumes sex, pregnancy, marriage as a result <br><br>Pretty slutty there, Luvia.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the question? If that's the case then it's because this takes places two year sin the future and RIn's gotten better.</br>    <br> Why are support characters so objectively better than main characters? <br>This applies to all media</br></br>   they made her a rhino too <br><br>God damn it.</br></br>  <br>They enhanced her man face more then anything. The profile shot that comes later is bad though.</br>  <br>I like her design here but I still prefer the Prisma one.</br>  <br>Primsa makes her look fat as hell. Original design is better them all.</br>  <br>M-muh dick</br>  <br>Not a Luvia fan but she doesn't look fat at all. Does the best job out of all the iterations of Fate in actually making her look feminine as well.</br>  <br>Tits and asses are made of fat. The Prisma design also has the best hips by far.</br>  <br><br>I prefer her with boots on.</br></br>  RIN A BEST!  <br>Did you mean Otoko?</br>  <br><br>I don't like the colors in Prisma. I feel like they're too, I don't know, saturated?</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  hnnnnnnnnnnnnng  <br>I think it is more washed-out.</br>  <br>I don't understand why they'd go throw the effort of adding this as a cover page to the script.</br>  <br>To ram home to fans that yes, they fucked.</br>  <br>Not everything must be sexual</br>  <br>Fans wouldn't have seen that had Udea not tweeted it.</br>  How much money could Shirou make by projecting video game swords and selling them to /v/?<br><br>Can you even mail yourself, swords, in the first place?<br><br>Has anyone tried before?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably knew she'd post it, or even asked her to.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the Association would go after his ass for abusing magic.</br>  <br><br>Don't think /v/ isn't into being buyfags.</br></br>    <br>Better project Tolkien weapons and sell them to /tg/</br>  <br>They would go after his ass in any case if they will learn about his ability.<br>It's both unique and way broken to just allow him to move freely.<br>Although i don't think that anything but Bazett-tier combat mage will even be able to scratch him if he went serious.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou isn't part of the Association and they can't do shit to him.<br><br>Association is in a 3 way stalemate with Middle East and Asia.<br><br>They aren't globally powerful like you think they are.<br><br>Association can't stop Shirou from selling swords to freedom loving Americans because they are Eurofags cucked by Asia and the Middle East in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would it feel like to be molested by Luvia?</br>  <br>Jojo is full of QUALITY, they said.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br/>  <br>Yeah?<br>Jojo looks decent enough animated too, your point?</br></br>  <br>Is this what happened during the 30 second sunset?</br>  Body built by daily sex  <br>REMOVE GORILLA</br>  <br>Point is you're signaling out a frame in an action shot.</br>  <br>Depends, in your case that would happen when you take of your pants.</br>  <br>College Rin is a miracle of the universe</br>  <br>so the last scene was just symbolism right? so he is still with Rin in clocktower for 3 years and after that he gonna make hero shenanigansis?</br>  <br>Yes and Rin follows him.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Yeah it's symbolic, Because he looks down, sees the spot where Archer stopped and keeps moving forward with a fake smile full of hope.</br>  <br>Only if luvia is the mc.</br>  <br>It's canon that Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino riverboat.</br>  <br>Exactly, that's the point.</br>  Did Shirou and Rin have sex at least? Because it didn't look like that.  <br>Y E S<br>E<br>S</br></br></br>  <br>How can you be sure?</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  <br>They had sex before Shirou wrecked Gil in the VN.</br>  <br><br>Explain.</br></br>  How strong is Shirou compare to the other mages at the end of UBW?  <br> Filename <br><br>Fucking kek</br></br></br>  <br>That's not what I asked.<br><br>That's just art.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the script cover for episode 25.</br>  <br>Bazett levels.</br>  <br>Right after the end of UBW he's still not experienced to take on a serious opponents.<br>After mastering UBW and getting Caladbolg and Hrunting?

It's his script in the first place, and on the cover of that script is a picture of a naked Rin and Shirou.</br>  Secondary here. Just wondering where Luvia ranks power level wise in the rest of the F/SN cast  <br>Don't forget that Shirou is also a tactical genius. Catching him on mind controlling spell won't be easy and against direct magic attacks he has his chinese swords.</br>  <br>she is equal to rin.</br>  <br>She's a modern day magus. Pretty low just like anyone else who isn't a servant.</br>  <br>You wish.<br><br>Again.<br>Do they fuck in the source material at this point or not?<br>Answer this and nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Shiki also saying the KnK movies will be better than Tsukihime's if Ufotable adapts it like that?</br>  <br>In the original VN? Yes, they fucked the night before fighting Gil.</br>  <br>Isn't Rin fairly powerful herself? Then where does Rin rank?<br><br><br> So where does she rank with everyone else?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Again. That's not what I asked. Why do I have to keep repeating myself?<br>Do they fuck in London at this point in the source material or not?</br></br>  <br>THIS WAS ANIME ORIGINAL ADDED BY THE AUTHOR.</br>  <br>Nigger all the London shit was anime original.</br>  <br>Almost nothing about London is described in the source material. The novel ends with them still in Japan.</br>  <br>I dunno anon, would a couple that's obviously in love not make love to each other?<br><br> That means yes. </br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Why are typemoonfags so retarded?<br>Is it implied in F/HA that they regularly have or have had sex in London before the beginning of the story?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kid's gotta sleep sometime.</br>  <br>Above Tokiomi level combatant.</br>  <br>This shit was like, the first time we've gotten /anything/ on London. I don't think you understand how big of a deal this episode was in a meta sense.</br>  <br>F/HA is a fandisk and isn't a continuation of the original novel to begin with. If you weren't such a retard, this conversation could have ended with your first post.</br>  <br><br>So there's no source and you can't tell if they have sex or not from the anime.<br>Thanks for the indirect answer.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes anon, clearly Rin and Shirou are pure chaste Christians who haven't even seen each other naked despite living together.</br>  <br> you can't tell if they have sex or not from the anime <br>If you need to explicitly be told something to understand it then let me explicitly tell you to fuck off</br></br>  <br><br>It's not implied in any way.<br>If that was the intention of the writer then he's shit at what he does.</br></br></br>  So is Luvia supposed to be a Swedish Finn? She dresses in Swedish colors, her name doesn't sound Finnish and she doesn't act like a stereotypical Finn at all, I mean where the hell is her knife.  <br><br>What the hell? A FAN made F/HA? Meaning it's somewhat noncanon, right? So a fan's work became slightly more canon when the anime acknowledged it's existence? That certainly is impressive.</br></br>  <br>That they are a couple living together and very comfortable with each other?<br><br>Yeah of course they didn't fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>You are so new.</br>  <br>God, you people are stupid.<br>You really think I don't get that? Who the fuck do you think I am? Some demented that somehow retains teh ability to post on the internet in a language different from his original one?<br><br>The point is that from what we've seen you can't clearly say that they are fucking. Doesn't matter what's probable or not and how much that is. You can't say that for sure. Stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never claimed to not be</br>  <br> A FAN made F/HA? <br>Please stop</br></br>  <br>If she was Finnish she'd look asian like rin, I think she's Swedish</br>  <br> Some demented that somehow retains teh ability to post on the internet in a language different from his original one? <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br> Swedish-speaking Finn <br>Fixed that for you.</br></br>  <br>Seeing as they fucked in the VN before this point and in H/A they did it after this point I would say the answer is yes. Shirou may be a lot of things but he isn't gay.</br>  <br>Could Shirou beat them in a fight?<br><br>assuming he uses his swords</br></br></br>  <br>Again, I don't claim to know these things, which is why I'm asking</br>  <br>UBW Shirou is Bazett level of course he is going in dry.</br>  <br> Shirou <br> Bazette level <br>Bazette would destroy shirou. Her combat skills far suprass his and she always has fragarch if she really needs it.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you really are stupid, because not only that's impossible but it isn't even funny to answer like that after I said so myself.<br><br>That still doesn't give any certainty.</br></br></br>  <br>It's implied that they are fucking but it wasn't shown, there happy?</br>  <br>I never said he was above her, but in the same plateau as her.</br>  <br> Shirou <br> with a female he supposedly loves <br> not jackhammering <br>I don't think you understand Shirou very well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not implied. Stop repeating yourself.<br><br>From all I've seen is a limp fag.</br></br></br>  <br> No, it's not implied. Stop repeating yourself. <br>It is when you have a couple living in the same dormitory, sorry.</br></br>  <br> No, it's not implied <br><br>You're retarded, just stop posting.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't know what to imply means.</br></br>  <br> From all I've seen is a limp fag. <br> Never read the source material <br>I'm sorry you need to be shown curtains or waves to draw obvious conclusions.</br></br></br>  <br> to indicate or suggest without being explicitly stated <br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>When you imply you give a certainty. This is not the case.<br><br>Never seen Shirou taking the first step in all the anime. Limp dick.</br></br></br>    <br> Shirou's true waifu <br>Wrong pic</br></br>  <br>Mollusks and jackhammers.</br>  <br>but kirei is his husbando</br>  <br> When you imply you give a certainty. This is not the case. <br>No you don't, read the damn definition and go eat shit.<br> taking the first step in all the anime <br>Not even that anon but you are also full of shit, at least watch the anime before shit posting.<br><br>I am done.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you should reread the definition.<br>Unfortunately I've watched all the Fate anime.</br></br>  <br> Implying Kotomine isn't his husbando &amp; waifu </br>  Everyone loves Shirou<br><br>Anyone have the updated version of this?</br></br>    <br>Why is Bazette or Karen there? They pretty much exploit Shirou the one time they actually meet. They only care about dressing him up like avenger.</br>  <br><br>What is Rin standing on?

Kirino a literal best, objectively speaking. To be fair, though, the only bad girl in the series was Manami.</br>  <br>someone has creepy, disgusting, indecent-in-public tastes<br><br>Like seriously I hate it enough when tsunderes get any affection from the mc, but for the bitchdere to be his sister too and he still chooses her over everyone else?<br><br>Why was that ending even allowed? Kuroneko, Ayase, and Manami tears had to fall. Their smiles left unprotected.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Translating into a made-up alien alphabet <br>I hate this meme.</br></br>  Is there any consolation to this super terrible sister ending?  <br>You didn't even get her name right you dingus</br>  <br>I have dyslexia</br>  Why would someone so obviously against incest watch a show called My Little Sister Can't be this Cute?  <br>I was rooting for her all through season 1!!<br>until he dated kuroneko...but then she dump him then I was back to rooting for her all through season 2!!</br></br>  <br>Her presence in S2 was pretty fucking minimal. You could tell by that alone that there wasn't going to be a Manami ending.</br>  <br>Fuck Manami. She a cunt. I'm sad for the others, though. Kuroneko a cute. Kirino was just more important to him. Rightfully so, too.</br>  <br>It actually hurt to see Kuroneko screaming in anguish. Her rejection was by far the worst.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EA2<wbr>mKbl_L5k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Literally the only thing Manami did wrong was having morality in a show that pandered incest.</br>  <br>it wasn't adapted in the Anime and non-LN fags never knew they got together in the first place</br>  <br>I know. She loved him. Made me sad.</br>  <br>But her ship sank for the sake of a relationship that the producers didn't even have the balls to go all the way with. A shame. By the end, I actually liked Kuroneko</br>  <br>Never even bothered with the garbage, but why the fuck are people this assblasted over a siscon ending of a series called: MY LITTLE SISTER CAN'T POSSIBLY BE THIS CUTE?</br>  <br>Yeah, I wish the plot twist never happened. Felt like they just said loljk the whole point of the show was a meme xD. I don't dislike the way it ended, but I would feel happier if they kept with it. <br>I just can't say no to a qt3.14 that buys her brother a minifridge and an eroge as housewarming gifts. Literal perfection. That level of trust that they had makes me feel warm inside.</br></br>  <br>my nigga</br>  <br>Because they made the sister an unlikable bitch, and every other girl introduced was better than her in every way</br>  <br>I know that OreImo was dealing with the whole incest thing in a more mature way than Yosuga No Sora, but I kind of want to see what would happen if Kirino and Kyousuke pulled the same shit, and ran away after Kirino graduates from high school. I'm sure Kirino would have enough of a nest egg at this point to set them up for a while, at least long enough to find employment</br>  <br>The anime butchered her personality, she was a much more likeable character in the LN</br>  <br>Literally only good for doujins.</br>   no one remembers Dutchguy   <br>That's what I was hoping for. They don't need society telling them who they can't love. They were deeper than that. I felt so many feels when she said yes. How can you watch that scene and not want them to do what makes them happy?</br>  <br>Manami will get over it and marry me!</br>  <br>No one WANTS to remember dutchfag. Don't mention his name, he might show up.<br><br>But it's a reality we will never see, unfortunately. <br> Imagine a crossover </br></br></br></br>        <br> I won, eat shit normalfag <br> I don't have any more gifs of the fight, BUT I DO HAVE THIS <br> A really shitty webm <br> Oh god why did I save this </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ayase should have won.<br>Fixed</br></br>  <br>Nigga, incest is my shit.</br>  Did someone say Kirino thread?  <br>I dont get why a rips on kissanime. It's pretty convienient.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the content of the webm, i'm talking about the quality of the webm.<br>That scene is probably my favorite in the entire series, but i have a shitty webm of it.</br></br>  <br>Would Kyousuke and Kirino canonically make babies?</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Is Yosuga worth a watch? I'm a shitter when it comes to starting new shows. I'm amazed I manage to watch anime at all.</br>  <br>Unlike Haru and Sora, they have a good chance that their kids won't be fucked, gene wise. So i can assume they tried.</br>  <br>Watch it and read the VN. They're different enough to consume both.</br>  <br>You're absolutely right.</br>  <br>The healing will begin when you accept her victory.</br>  <br>It wastes time for the first 8 or so episodes with "what if" arcs with other girls, and the incest is pretty rushed, but it's overall a great watch, and has some fantastic fucking music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HnV<wbr>NYIyE2hs</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EFE<wbr>R3VRV27A</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lJh<wbr>i8tX-RP4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>explain</br>  <br>I like being butthurt. Bitching about shit is more fun.</br>  <br>Haru and Sora are twins, so if they tried for kids, there is a pretty high chance they would come out with some kind of deformity<br>Kyosuke and Kirino are merely siblings, so the chance for deformities is fairly slim.</br></br>   tfw not an incestfag and still liked oreimo <br>Kirino best girl.</br>  <br><br>Thanks p/a/ls. What about the OreImo LN/VNs? I only watched the show because Kirino is everywhere.</br></br>  <br>I can't say I blame you. It is more fun to talk about things you hate sometimes.</br>  <br>Kirino on being the best girl.</br>    <br>The Oreimo anime is butchered badly, the LN is a lot better.</br>  <br> English <br> you <br>Also no.</br></br></br>  <br>Not sure about the VN, but i really enjoyed the LN. I'm currently doing the PSP one for shits and giggles, but i know about the whole twist on Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship, so i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop.</br>  <br>I like how she warms up to the idea of Haru and Sora going out it in the VN.</br>  <br>Sisters should always be devoted and loyal.<br>Best sisters are best.</br></br>  <br> should of <br>Fucking Americans, when will you fucks learn to English?</br></br>  <br>It's true, the what if arcs are pretty wasteful, especially considering none of the other female characters are particularly engaging.<br><br>I don't understand why they left that little town though. Everyone found out about and agreed not to discuss the relationship. They could have lived in that house, and spent their days together in quiet peace. Honestly, when I think on it, that town was probably the most Zen place I've ever seen depicted.<br><br>But no, let's travel to a foreign country where we don't speak the language and try to start up there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It truly is, now if you excuse me I gonna go to a raildex thread and call Touma a faggot some more. Good day.</br>  <br>Read the LNs.</br>  <br>VN it is implied they'll go back and I hear in the extension of their route they might try to open their family's business back up.</br>  <br>It would have made any interactions with their friends unbelievably akward, and they probably didn't want to hurt them any more than they had. Look at how Kozue reacted. Who's to say someone wouldn't be even more radical in their reaction, tell someone, and that would force Haru and Sora apart?</br>  You think all incest stories have a happy ending? Go read Kana Imouto, you happy fuckers. See if you're still smiling by the end of that<br> My heart still hurts </br>  All endings are shit endings. Things must not stand still.  <br>Anime haru was better than VN haru.</br>  <br>how long is it</br>  <br> Implying it was an American <br>Thou art not worth of this thread  faggot. <br><br><br>I remember reading the first volume and became a Kirino fag before the anime and all that shit.<br><br>I didn't pay attention to the incest thing, just liked them as a couple. Kuroneko too, but she lost my support when she broke up with Kyousuke.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the issue with KA?<br><br>It's got a mobile site with direct html video links, there isn't much not to like</br></br></br>  <br>About 8-10 hours or so. And it's nothing but pain, pain, less pain, and more pain.</br>  <br>That's good to hear. I think in time, the village would rationalise it as coping with the grief of the loss of their family.</br>  <br>wish me luck</br>  <br>Is there more Manami-chan in the LNs? Not giving her an arc in s2 was an unforgivable crime</br>  <br>You will be feeling the pain for a LONG time afterwards, anon. But godspeed.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks. May you all be blessed with kawaii DTF imoutos in your next life.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I am asking.</br>  <br>I always felt a little sorry for the other chick in that VN. Even if she drunked you up and sorta kinda raped you </br>  <br>The anime was not that far from the LNs though. You are not missing much about Manami anyways.</br>  <br>I didn't have time for Yumi, i was too busy  making sure Kana didn't suffer </br>  <br>Hopefully one that will run away with me</br>  <br>Oh, I didn't realize it was a visual novel</br>  <br>Yep. Fun fact time, it was also my FIRST VN ever. Fucking hell of a place to start</br>  <br>Damn right.</br>  <br>Manami is the Squealer of Oreimo.</br>  <br>Japan is too fucking good at piano</br>  <br>Squealer was doing everything right until he lost the war against those inhumane psychics that should all burn in hell</br>  <br>You say that like it's a bad thing<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Hfr<wbr>jSHd3wgo</wbr>  [ ]<br>But seriously, the entire YNS soundtrack is fucking god tier</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that one bgm from the VN that plays when Sora walks out barely clothed much to Haru's horror.</br>  <br>My favorite is probably the one from the anime, where Haru watches Sora masturbating while calling his name. It drove me fucking insane trying to find it.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EFE<wbr>R3VRV27A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  how easy is it to blow a load to kio kaze as compared to.. oreimo?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Eq0<wbr>Tiuix3tY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The start menu theme from VN is nice too.</br></br></br>  Only retards like Kirino  <br>What do you mean, blow a load? Koi Kaze is a lot cuter than oreimo, and has a better ending, if you ask me?<br> Plus the fact that the doujin's are canon, that is something i like. I actually think they were done by the mangaka, if memory serves me right </br></br>  <br>4th from the top.</br>  I think Kirino would have been better as a yandere in the anime. Would have fit, given how abusive she was.  <br>third chapter never.  I still want to hurry up and waste that stardust one out of my mouth by finishing it too </br>  HN5 when?  <br>Win what?<br>A retarded moron called Kyousuke?<br><br>Perhaps if you hate Manami.<br><br>In fact both MC were awful, they deserved each other and now the other girls are free.<br><br>I hated when the author ass pulled Ayase falling for douchebag mc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of want a sequel to pic related. I assume that they pulled a YNS and ran away, but one can't be sure</br>  <br>They're dead Jim.</br>  <br>Was wondering when someone would say it.</br>  <br>When was death brought up?

Man, Manami must have been in anguish afterwards, picking glass out of her face. And Kirino, probably picking glass out of her fist.<br> But only one had Kyosuke to help her </br></br>  <br><br>At least Manami-chan is going to the same college. Maybe they'll share a dorm and "accidentally" do lewd things to each other.<br><br>Like the good old falling over the girl and having one hand land on her breast</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2013  <br> glass lenses </br></br>  <br>I like it, but i can't unhear the moaning.</br>  <br>I don't think Manami want's anything to do with Kyosuke after how what he did.

I've been using plastic for what, 7 years already.<br> Don't get contacts please </br></br>  <br> But hearing her squeaks of pleasure is the best part! <br> Seriously. Lewd as the scene was, for some reason Sora was just even cuter than she usually was, quietly squeaking her brothers name </br></br>  <br>Companies have mostly stopped using glass for corrective lens for a while now. More than likely your lenses are going to be plastic, polycarbonate, or other similar materials. Those don't shatter the same way glass does.</br>  <br>Mine are glass, and they fucking suck to clean, unless I remove them from the frame. And god help me if it gets scratched</br>  Post Ayase's feet  <br>she must be a scat fetishist then</br>  <br>Nah, both of my pairs are glass. Someone hit me full in the face, and shattered them, and it fucking hurts, getting small glass shards in your face</br>  <br> Stop. My dick can't take any more. </br>  I wanted Ayase to cuff kyouske to her bed and force herself upon him  <br>Where the hell are you even from, did you not change your pair for years?</br>  <br> Man, that little minx just couldn't get enough of her brother's cock. I wonder how many times they did it before Not-Manami and the QT class pres caught them in the act? Do you think they continued afterwards? Give how Sora was all "Look at me, Haru. Only ever look at me", i think he would have had to fight her off. </br>  <br> I've been on the same 2 pairs for almost 8 years now. </br>  <br> If nothing else, at least it means your vision isn't getting worse. </br>  <br><br>Thread almost ruined. Only way it could possibly get worse is if Dutch showed up.</br></br>  <br>this is an imouto thread of course it's also a kirino thread</br>  <br>I love imouto threads. They draw all kinds of people in.<br>I remember that one anon who had practically raised his sister, since their parents were shit, and something about her getting in a car accident and telling him how much she loved him</br></br>  <br> all that unprotected sibling sex <br><br>too lewd</br></br></br>  <br> stoooooooppppp </br>  <br>Haru must have fought to keep her satisfied. it's a possibility that she was entirely Haru-sexual, and never even entertained the thought of going to another man for sex, but it's also a possibility that Haru just fucked her brains out every opportunity he got, so he didn't lose her.<br>Oh, the doujins write themselves. Too bad they don't draw themselves, too</br></br>  <br>That's one of my favorites.</br>  <br>All imouto threads are Kirino threads but not all Kirino threads are imouto threads.</br>  <br>Yes, she appears much more often. Everything is better in the LNs, and the anime butchers the most important plot elements. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.</br>  <br>It's definitely one of the best oreimo doujins. Best ending, too, none of this "My Father and Little Sister"/"200 Day War" shit<br>A proper, adorable ending, for an adorable fucking doujin</br></br>  <br>You're right   and wrong since the LNs give her a different motive </br>  <br>Holy shit.</br>  <br>I've never seen the show and am more than content just saving cute pics and doujins, but have often wondered what was the cause of this scene. <br>Is it safe to assume that Kirino was being a cunt?</br></br>  <br>Kirino and Kyousuke tell Kyousuke's childhood friend about their relationship, Kirino and said childhood friend get in a fist fight over it, Kirino wins, as always</br>  <br>Kirino bragging to Manami that Kyousuke loves her even though they're siblings. To be fair, she was holding it in for a few years.</br>  <br>Manami gets full on butthurt and unleashes it.</br>  <br><br><br>Why were they punching each other?</br></br></br>  <br>Minami is a jealous bitch.</br>  <br>It's justified, but i almost believe Kirino deserved some kind of comuppance. She really was up in Manami's face about, literally.</br>  <br><br>Manami gets rejected, isn't willing to accept that her childhood friend will be happy with someone else, lashes out.</br></br>  <br>Because Manami is butthurt about losing, and Kirino is rubbing it in. Manami punches Kirino, Kirino punches Manami, both accidentally punch Kyosuke when he tries to break it up</br>  <br><br>Thanks, anons.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Cold-blooded, man. Glad I got to Number2's stories before knowing about this.</br></br></br></br></br>  Manami was the only sane and pure girl for kyouske <br><br>Everyone else had some sort of fetish and mental illness</br></br>  <br>Adorable.</br>  <br>Pure? She warps Kirino's tender young mind, and then orchestrates Kyosuke's fall into mediocrity. She was just as twisted and fucked in the head as the rest of them.<br>If anything, Kuroneko is the only truly normal one. Sure, she's chuuni as fuck, but otherwise she's normal</br></br>  <br>Did he ever continue?<br>Tell me.<br>PLEASE.</br></br></br>  <br> fetish and mental illness <br><br>That's real life man. I've seen the way my friends sisters act around them, it's not a stretch to think siblings can love each other.</br></br></br>  <br>I KNOW RIGHT</br>  <br>I don't think so. Kind of sad, I would have loved to see what happened.</br>  <br><br>Probably go caught up in real life now, like OHB. I certainly don't think I'd be here as often if there were someone I cared about.<br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>I keep hearing OHB referenced. What/who is it?</br>  <br>You're overreacting, so as that picture. She just tells Kirino that incest is bad and Kyosuke to calm the fuck down because he might hurt somebody if he's not careful. He grew up of course he wasn't going to be the same genki #YOLO kid forever. Manami didn't mold him to be some kind of dependable and boring loner like most Kirinofags make believe. He had friends and everything.<br><br>What's funny is that Kirino looked up to the hyper Kyosuke, but that personality never comes back, even at the end of the series he's still the same person Manami "molded" him to be.</br></br></br>  <br>He's  lurk more before you post again and embarass yourself by asking dumb questions, newfag </br>  <br> Pic related </br>  <br><br>I'm fucking kidding, relax</br></br>  <br> not all Kirino threads are imouto threads. <br>yes they are</br></br>   should of <br><br>Minamifags everyone.</br></br>  <br> same person Manami "molded" him to be. <br>Did we watch/read the same thing? The whole series is Kyousuke doing extraordinary things for his sister and others, which is exactly what Manami's molding intended to stop. <br><br>The end is no exception, where he kisses Kirino despite the more responsible option being letting their relationship go.<br><br>You have to be completely blind to Kyousuke's character arc to suggest such bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Much as i understand where you're coming from<br> minamifags everyone <br> minamifags <br> MINAMI <br><br>Oh my god, FUCK YOUR STREET SIGNS, CAPTCH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both that image and your post are wrong.<br><br> Manami didn't mold him to be some kind of dependable and boring loner <br><br>She actually did. Part of her motivation was to protect him from himself, and in that she was right, but she also used the opportunity to influence him towards the low achieving lifestyle that she believed was superior and that she wanted him to have, so that (hopefully) he would fall in love with her.<br><br> that personality never comes back <br><br>It comes back to some degree. I don't know how you could believe it never comes back at all, Kyousuke literally says it right in the text. It sounds like you're explaining things based off of a few LN quotes and what you've read on /a/. Super Kyousuke is more of an on and off thing after his character development finalizes, where he learns to control his ambition and find a balance between being safe and normal, but still being passionate and fiery about what he cares about.<br><br>The point of Manami and Kirino's fight was to show how childish their grudge was, and how wrong both of their idealizations were. Both of them wanted different extremes of Kyousuke, but only Kirino was accepting of end-story Kyousuke as a person because, as she learned more about him when they grew closer, she realized he's just a human being, not the perfect guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kuroneko a shit. Worse than Manami.   like Manami the most out of the Oreimo girls <br> didn't want her to win <br>I just don't know man.</br></br>  <br>Dude knocked up his Imouto at least.</br>  <br>Not really. I think there's an anon recently trying to make that happen but nope. There have been a lot of Kirino threads that are simply Kirino threads.</br>  <br><br> Extraordinary things <br><br>He was a kid, a fucking kid. Saying Manami is the sole reason why he's not as proactive as he used to be as a fucking toddler is dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't even what I was arguing, I suggest you reread my post. <br><br>His actions during the series indicate his reckless genki attitude very much did return, while you claimed he was the same person Manami molded.</br></br></br>  post lewd Kirinos <br>only they can save this thread</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127283606 <br> amifitinginyet xD </br>  <br>Sounds more like you than him.

Yes, I know there are people who actually speak like that, and they are also legitimately retarded. <br><br>This is why I don't read translations in Thai, fuck "speech" Thai is retarded, and "formal" Thai is awkward.</br></br></br>  <br> summerfag <br><br>Please, new or not you're pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't see how  is less of a "fitting in" post than </br>  <br>He went into legend as a hero.</br>  <br>Manami kuso</br>  Better ending coming through  People worship characters that did things far worse than Manami just because they happen to look cute, why can't we just like Manami?  <br>She made the incest end possible so she is alright in my book. A necessary evil if you will for Kyousuke's true end.</br>  <br>See, I mean, even the most die-hard Kirinofag has to realise the only reason the incest happens is because of Manami anyway.<br>Kind of funny really, if she didn't get involved and let them progress normally she could've gotten Kyousuke pretty naturally.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what she did wrong.<br><br>She's cute, kind, always lends her time, knows how to cook, and even has a bit of a dom side to her so that's hot</br></br></br>  <br>She is so obsessed with the idea of normalcy that she practically ruins Kirino's relationship with Kyosuke, and basically forced Kyosuke to become a filthy normy, just so he would fall in love with her, the queen of the normies. She did plenty wrong</br>  Bully the Neko  <br>Don't bully the Neko, she doesn't deserve it. Bully the filthy megane, she's earned her punishment</br>  <br>I thought Kyouske became a normal guy during middle school after forcing a female friend to go on a field trip then coercing her into a forbidden section where she gets injured, her parents get livid af, and she ends up moving away and he blamed himself for everything and died inside</br>  <br>it wasn't just Kyosuke's self hatred, Manami decided to stick her big fat stupid nose into it, and make him terrified to do anything more than normal</br>  <br>Guess I have to read the LNs then</br>  <br> Minami should of won </br>   tfw Dutchguy killed himself over this.   <br>Who was that again?</br>  <br>Manami tripfag.</br>  <br>How horrifying.</br>  <br>He went insane at the end and a few people made him so scared that he stopped being my friend and disappeared from the internet.</br>  <br>Being friends through the internet doesn't count as actually being friends.</br>  <br>wow.<br> mfw bf recognized him and started to chat with him on skype </br></br>  <br> ~40% <br> fairly slim <br><br> https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/animals-and-us/201210/the-problem<wbr>-incest</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I found her annoying.<br><br> pick every option I can to reject her <br> still end up with her <br><br>She's like some succubus you just can't escape from.<br><br> Though she was pretty sweet in the 'MC goes insane from grief' ending </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ending was the only time i could bring myself to like her. She was trying so hard for Taka.<br>This VN, man, i fucking swear.<br>The first ending I got was the one with Kana's recordings. Dear god, i cried like a fucking bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>That was never in the cards for her. <br>Kyousuke mentally associates her with his dead grandma. It's why she had so much influence over him.</br></br>  <br><br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind<br><br>Here it is the groove slightly transformed <br>Just a bit of a break from the norm <br>Just a little somethin' to break the monotony <br>Of all that hardcore dance that has gotten to be <br>A little bit out of control it's cool to dance <br>But what about the groove that soothes that moves romance <br>Give me a soft subtle mix <br>And if ain't broke then don't try to fix it <br>And think of the summers of the past <br>Adjust the base and let the alpine blast <br>Pop in my CD and let me run a rhyme <br>And put your car on cruise and lay back cause this is summertime<br><br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind <br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind <br>Summer summer summertime <br>Time to sit back and unwind</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn. First end I got was the 5th one, the second intellectual ending. And that was painful enough.<br><br>The Taka goes crazy ending was probably the worst, but the Recollection ending with the recorder hurt me the most.<br><br> I'm still butthurt about the fact that Kana possibly leaves Taka in the "good" ending and am currently reading a fanfic to alleviate it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who was it that went full autism and did troll subs for an entire episode? Was it you or Dutchguy?<br><br>Is Dutch still tripfagging? I haven't seem him in any Oreimo thread this past year.</br></br></br>  <br>For the love of god, don't read the third installment of that fanfic. It takes everything, and crushes it in your hands. Just finish the second, and be done with it<br>I love this VN, i really do. It was my first, and will always hold a special place in my heart. But fuck me, it keeps tearing holes in me.</br></br>  <br>It's still the only one I've played. <br>I plan to try either Hoshizora no Memoria or Ikikoi next but I'm still not over Kana Imouto yet.</br></br>  <br>Me and I think his trip got leaked.</br>  <br> Minami should of won <br>As if I couldn't hate Minami more</br></br>  <br>This VN is nothing but pain. I hate it, but i love it. I'm like an abused spouse, it keeps beating me but i keep coming back</br>   Wanting retarded babies.   <br>Are you upset?</br>   Childhood friend <br> glasses <br> short hair <br>Can you even make a girl more shit tier than this? It's like the author tried his best to make a girl as unappealing as possible.</br></br></br>  <br>He said in another oreimo thread that his trip got permabanned. Don't know if that is how it works.</br>  <br>How does it feel to have the worst taste on planet earth?</br>  <br>Kirino looks like an aquatic salamander in this image.</br>  <br> disliking worst girl means he has worst taste <br><br>That's not how it works. Manami is empirically shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She has done nothing to deserve such spite<br><br>She was the nicest and least retarded of all the girls</br></br></br>  <br>I never said anything about Manami herself in that post, but two of the qualities he listed are GOAT and childhood friend has no negative consequences for any character.</br>  <br>You're right, I just assumed you were defending Manami.<br><br>I find nothing wrong with those qualities he described, but in Manami they all form into some perfect storm of shittiness.</br></br></br>  <br> <br>I still like Manami though</br> </br>  I'm just a sucker for motherly-type girls<br><br>Probably cuz my own mother used to neglect and beat me when I was child.<br><br>Yea</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Manami never had any chance. Kirino is undeniably the best girl for Kyousuke and they are the OTP.</br>  <br>They're my OTP, They're perfect for each other.</br>  <br>Manami is the fucking WORSE. I hate her so much, that passive aggressive fakeass bitch. Kirino forever.</br>  <br>Manami is definitely the most unwelcome for porn.</br>  <br> Make all the bad things go away <br> Please don't leave me again <br> I need you <br>Something about desperate, yandere Kirino just makes my heart go doki-doki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Manami is definitely the most unwelcome for porn <br>How come her doujins are the best though?<br> I admit, the ones that had multiple girls were really great too, like those ones with LN-sized titles. </br></br></br>  <br> yandere Kirino <br>That sequel was so shit. I get Hyocoroad was experimenting but it's obvious it wasn't a good idea past the drawing board.</br></br>  <br> How come her doujins are the best though? <br>Eh. The one where she gets raped is alright I guess.</br></br>  <br>Only be good if we got Kirino torturing Kuroneko.</br>  <br>I dun get it.</br>  <br>I bet you like NTR, too<br> To be honest, one of my first doujins was Manami, before I really got into what this shit was. <br>http://exhentai.org/g/429378/295fc6<wbr>d2aa/<br> Then i got it confused with <br>http://exhentai.org/g/448843/364110<wbr>99e9/</wbr></br> <br>And the distinction forced me to watch/read both, and that began my downward spiral. So, in a sense, I owe Manami for forcing me to get into manga.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Shame fatty's arc was so fucking boring and needed to be resolved in the next season.</br>      I hoped the PSP VN would sorta redeem this series because you were able to choose the girl.<br>Yet it was still disappointing with no conclusive endings whatsoever. Not even a single kiss in most routes</br>  <br>Are you just randomly shitposting?</br>  <br>PSP VN was just for self inserting, right?  Considering they made Kirino his cousin. </br>  <br>Yes, it butchers characters for the sake of pairing and totally removes Kyousuke's personality to make self inserting easier. Go for it if you only care about seeing your favorite girl winning.</br>  oh hey daily oreimo thread, have your share of happy oreimo doujins :^)<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/698811/f5dd74<wbr>37d4/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/652499/b33440<wbr>1d53/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/387824/5d4c58<wbr>6a31/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I really like Kanako's design, pity she didn't get more development.</br>  Mfw never even watched the show and I knew the sister would win<br><br>Was it really not that obvious to everyone?

I'm still going to watch it regardless. I'm on this thread for the same reason. This is a huge ass fucking spoiler amd reading it made me tear up. That's something thays never happened before. <br> pic related </br></br>  <br>He looks like a kind old man. 10/10, would entrust barely-pubescent daughter to his care.</br>  <br> Sorta kinda NBR </br>  <br>Go back to /mlp/ you faggot.</br>  Kirino is a miracle of the universe.  Greatest love story ever told. I loved Kirino the first time I watched it and opened up to Kuroneko the second time. If you get into it and read the lyrics of the ED songs, which are often inner monologues of the characters, it adds a lot to understanding them and appreciating the story, and at some points it's terribly sad.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-O-<wbr>CXaNgfI8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Shame the anime adaptation was butchered so.</br>  <br> greatest love story ever told <br> not Toradora </br></br>  does anyone else think about assplay and anal sex when thinking about kuroneko?  <br>Of course they do. At least I do.</br>  <br>I think about yeast infection and other girly diseases but then I remember that she is 2D and perfect.</br>  <br>Kuroneko really has the make of a buttslut if you ask me.</br>  Minami is an ugly piece of shit, ugly people don't get love.  We will never get S2's full OST.  <br>She'll probably end up some christmas cake and end up hitting on some younger guy that looks like kyousuke.</br>  <br> That song makes me cry every time. I'm so glad Kirino and Kyousuke got together. </br>  Kirini is shit<br>Manami is shit<br>Kuroneko is shit<br>The anime is shit<br>The LN is shit<br>The author is shit<br>Overall everything about this is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand but that song is actually Kuroneko lamenting her rejection, sung by her seiyuu. It's the ED of the episode where Kyousuke confesses to Kirino, probably shows how biased the anime staff was towards Kuroneko.</br>  <br>Because it played right after the confession I somehow only associate it with Kirino, even if it's actually about Ruri.</br>        <br>The only anime original part that made any sense.</br>  <br> that gif <br> that doujin <br>Why, anon. Of all the doujin's, you had to pick the one with the  second worst ending. <br>Piece of shit, just love the imouto, don't abandon it</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have trouble reading doujins like that even ones like Manami being raped bug me.</br>  <br> should of <br>Why do Americans always make this mistake?</br></br>  Kuroneko is best girl<br>Manami did nothing wrong<br>Kirino a shit <br> Ayase is nothing more than cumdump garbage </br></br></br>  <br>I can tolerate rape, if it's a yandere reverse raping someone with love.<br>I can't tolerate the darker side of Oreimo doujins, with all the rape, mindbreak and NTR.</br></br>  <br>Oreimo doujins tend to be super sweet loving or super dark shit.</br>  <br>the only good oreimo doujin is a  ruri  doujin</br>  <br>I'm so thankful that i can blacklist NTR. Unfortunately, 200 day war technically doesn't have any bad tags, so it slipped through my radar. Hell of a shock i got, expecting yet another cute doujin where Kirino has loving sex with her brother. Dear god, that ending got dark</br>  Can you faggots stop talking about NTR shit if you hate it that much? It sounds like you're just shilling.  <br>ah sorry</br>  <br>Every day, threads on this show. The story revolves around a guy and his pixie dream girl little sister that is in love with him and likes playing siscon H-games.<br><br>You couldn't make up a more pandering otaku crap show if it was a parody.</br></br></br>  The series would have been infintely better without Manami or Kuroneko. We didnt have to see their suffering.<br><br>Should have only focused on Kirino and Kousuke's development.</br></br>  <br>So what would be a better incest story then?</br>    Manami a shit.  <br>Manami a shit. Forever and always. Fuck dutchguy.</br>  <br>Nigga when you post a song or whatever you gotta at least give us a tune to sing it to, otherwise it's useless.</br>  <br><br><br>These gifs were so cathartic during that time. /a/ was so split and antagonistic  even more than usual  for the duration of the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Manami a shit to you too, anon.</br>    <br>Should have read the LN, friend. Also:<br><br> muh neko </br></br></br>  I want more Kirino.      <br>I'm just waiting for pic related to get an anime to fill the void since we're not going to get more Kirino and Kyousuke.</br>  <br>I'm sure. Just a shame about that whole  NBR  thing.</br>  <br>I think it's ok as long as it's properly revealed at the start and not pulled at the end randomly.</br>  <br>We remember him. I just want to know if he already set himself on fire with the LNs.</br>  I want to fuck Kirino.  <br>how the hell do you make these</br>  <br>Love.</br>  <br>hi man i noticed u didnt spoiler the end of a show! can you please do this next time to avoid people having such a plot rich anime spoiled!!! <br><br>thanks !!</br></br></br>  <br><br>She truly is the best girl of our time.</br></br>  Kirino is love.<br>Kirino is life.</br>  <br>should HAVE won you fucking inbred</br>   should of   <br><br>You need to update.</br></br>    i want to  hug_  kuroneko  <br>She probably needs a hug after getting dumped so hard.</br>  <br>i-it was mutual</br>  <br>She draining Kyousuke of his motivation. She literally limited his future possibilities by brainwashing him. Kirino is a bitch and can go diaf, but Manami ain't no innocent.<br><br>Hell, if it wasn't for her removing his overclock, Kirino never would have become bitchy at him and he probably would have fucked both his sisters friends like a boss.</br></br></br>  <br>Bully the Neko</br>  <br>neko was too dumb, she needed to be more aggressive if she wanted to end up with kyousuke's dick inside her</br>  <br>She was still sad.</br>  <br>Yeah, she totally wanted to break up too, that's why she fainted after asking him if he'd still choose her and continued evading and interrupting him when he tried to tell her the truth.</br>  <br>s-she was only pretending to be sad</br>  <br>Totally. At least she got over it in the end and is still friends with the siblings.</br>      <br> Ball so hard motherfuckas wanna fine me </br>  Kirino is our only queen.  <br>Heh, that makes 4 off by 1 in a row I think.</br>  <br>Come on.</br>  <br>You tried, anon. You tried.</br>    <br>normal sibling behavior</br>  Everyone else&gt;shit&gt;Kirino&gt;Manami.      <br>Except that's not how genetics work, idiot. Two children of the same parents have the exact same set of chromosomes as one another, they're merely expressed in different ways. Additionally, only monozygotic twins are identical, and this is merely because two children were born from the same egg, and hence their genes are expressed identically. Fraternal twins (which is what Sora &amp; Haru are btw, since it's literally impossible to have monozygotic twins of opposite genders) have the same genes but are not identical.<br><br>Twins vs siblings doesn't impact the statistical probability of undesirable genetic traits that results from children born of incest.</br></br></br>  <br>Siblings share 50% genes, the closest you can get without any prior incest in the family.</br>  <br> 50% <br><br>how does that happen? aren't we 100% of what our parents are?</br></br></br>  <br>We get 50% from each parent.</br>  <br>We're 50/50 from each parent but still 100 of each bruh</br>  <br>This is the better thread for you. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127320321 </br>  <br>That thread is a /pol/ thread on /a/, not an incest thread.</br>  <br>let me make this simpler to understand<br>imagine that you have a red and blue marble<br>you combine these marbles (just put them in the same spot) and now you have a 2 marble combination of 2 marbles. you can say that each marble represents half of the combination because that is correct, but it is still the totality of the marble within the two marble combination<br><br>now replace marble with parents and the two marble with the offspring and you should get it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Say what you will about Kirino being a bitch, but Manami crossed the line from bitch the psychopath a LONG time ago.</br>  <br>Exactly, they will listen to your stupid shit.<br><br><br>I truly hope you know how retarded that metapher is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i truly hope you know how retarded you're being</br>    <br>I know I'm talking to a shitposter but just for the sake of completeness, it's 0.5^n with n being the degree of kinship. The closest is 1 for siblings orparent-child, 2 for half-siblings, 3 for niece-nephew, 4 for cousins and so on. I think you get the concept.</br>  <br>can i have source for that?</br>  <br>Every single biology book ever, just wait until you're in the 6th grade of whenever they start teaching it in your shithole.</br>  <br>Thanks, friend.</br>  <br><br><br>I can watch this all day.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm genuinely curious because this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeff<wbr>icient_of_relationship exists but it has nothing to do what we're talking about, or are you simply confused?</wbr></br>  <br>Kirino has higher stats so Manami would eventually lose.</br>  <br>what are these siblings doing?</br>  <br>Advanced Cuddling.</br>  <br>i suppose that is fine so long as it is normal</br>  <br> full siblings <br> 50% (which equals 0.5^1) <br>Thanks for confirming what I said earlier. Your wiki article just proves everything I said, only that I used the simpler formula that doesn't apply to all forms of incest.</br></br></br>  <br>Mamori would have been the best in bed.. I think she would be more giving and willing to please than any of the other gyrls</br>  <br>But I was not discussing that with you, perhaps you want to scroll up a little bit and re-read what I argued from the beginning?</br>  <br>see i am pretty sure normal siblings do not kiss this way</br>  <br>You're a funny guy, considering the first thing I said was that siblings share 50% of their genes.  </br>  <br>Yes, and I said that you are wrong. What we inherit on 50/50 is the alleles but we inherit 100% of genes from our parents.</br>  you watched a show called "I can't believe my little sister is this cute" and expected someone other than the little sister to win? Thats the problem. I dropped this show after episode 1 when I noticed it was going to be an incest shit.  2 0 1 5<br>0<br>1<br>5<br>AND PEOPLE STILL THINK<br>THAT KIRINO WASN'T ALWAYS GOING TO WIN<br> 2015 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course the child gets 100% of its genes from the parents but the statement "aren't we 100% of what our parents are?" doesn't make sense as you only share 50% with each parent, not 100%. It reads like you think the genes/chromosomes/etc. double every generation. No matter how you read my posts it's all correct. I'll stop responding now, I'm not bored enough to continue this.</br>  <br>Minami's mammaries the bestits</br>  <br>Will the butthurt ever end?</br>  <br>I doubt it.</br>  <br>People still cry about True Tears, so It'll probably never end.</br>  <br>I know, it's a crime that such a good show only had 7 episodes.</br>  <br> No but I'm kinda glad because we wouldn't have nearly as many threads if people weren't butthurt about x losing or the ending.

It's utterly useless, it even goes against the reference material to exaggerate numbers.</br>  <br>Kirino had that fight in the bag once Manami's glasses were broken.</br>  <br>I've been punch in the face before and my glasses didn't break. Kirino didn't pull her punch, huh?</br>  Why was the quality in this season so fucking terrible? Did it even sell well enough for another season?  It'll be lucky to break 5K.  What was wrong with it? Animation was good and the story followed the LNs pretty closely.  <br>Jesus fuck you're an idiot</br>  <br> Did it even sell well enough for another season? <br><br>I hope not.</br></br></br>  <br>Seemed as if it was fucking rushed in my opinion.</br>  Low budget, trying to run off the success of prior seasons with as little animation as possible..  <br> Did it even sell well enough for another season? <br>I fucking hope not. Anime original shit should be punished.<br><br><br> and the story followed the LNs pretty closely. <br>It LITERALLY made shit up, like Loki's dumbass curse, Rias suddenly having a fucking Balance Breaker, fake Issei, this entire season was a trainwreck.<br><br>I hope Season 4 never even exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rias suddenly having a fucking Balance Breaker, <br><br>I dropped S3 midway, what the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I mostly watched it for the breasts. S1 and S2 BOOSTO! was way better than in S3. A bit similar to how Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha was in my opinion, S1 was good, S2 was better and S3 was just mediocre.</br>  <br><br>S1 was fucking hilarious, S2 was mediocre and dragged too much, but S3 was a disaster.</br></br>  that final episode was pretty awful<br> fight scenes are just motion blurred still frames </br>  <br> that tiny face on Issei <br> those giant arms on Koneko <br> those fucked up proportions overall </br></br></br>  <br> I hope Season 4 never even exists. <br><br>DxD EX will sell all the Bds they need to cover the cost and green light S4.<br> Its going to be a LN sidestory bundled with the Bds that will have Issei´s kids from the future showing up to take care of some bad guy and also do something to prevent Asia from getting killed in the future<br/> <br> Rias, Akeno, Xenovia, Irina, Koneko, and Kuroka´s kids with issei are confirmed to show up </br></br></br></br></br>  Posting best doujin  <br>S3 was pretty terrible in quite a number of places. But the studio did Ophis's scene justice and that saved S3 for me.</br>  <br>You don't know what you're missing, anon.</br>  <br><br>Did they fuse or something?</br></br>  <br>Only parts that was good imo was issei's balance breaker and juggernaut drive</br>  <br>THK, the studio, previously lost a serious amount of money adapting things like PenguinDicks. They had to do this season on a budget.<br>It'll get another season because it's the only franchise THK has that makes bank.</br></br>  Judging from this thread looks like I'll have better luck just reading the LNs.<br><br><br>don't just tease us like that anon. come on ol' buddy what's the so-oh i got it myself thanks.</br></br></br>  Dem faces tho  <br>We got canon now so thank you, keep that with you in bed Raiser.</br>  <br>They had to dedicate all the budget to writing the original scenario.</br>  <br>just by seeing this image it's NTR right?</br>  <br>Dont even bother trying to figure out how it happened anon , some how a broken piece of booster gear is enough to create a fake balance breaker...even though they needed the fucking holy grail and issei´s dead human body to do something similar in the novels</br>  Chances of a different studio making season 4? we still have a lot of source material left and it gets really good after volume 10.  <br> it gets really good after volume 10. <br><br>If that's true, why are they dilly-dallying with the earlier volumes? At this point it'd take season 5 to get there.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>That is not a Balance Breaker. It is just used for appearance. <br><br>The fragment was nothing but a vehicle for the curse. Never did it use [Boost]. The fake Juggernaut Drive even used Norse magic to attack.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well to be fair the volumes season three were supposed to follow were actually really good, they skipped over a few huge parts and added their own.   There was a really good rating battle between kaichou and rias, a way better version of the loki fight, and what really made me mad was the way issei asks out akeno is 200000x times better   plus other things  </br>  If they are going to do a S4, they should just pretend the last 3 episodes never happened. I can forgive everything else about S3, but the last 3 episodes were pure garbage.  This season was pretty shitty in comparison to S2. The only thing about DxD that keeps me interested is BOOSTO and the rating games. We got okay amounts of BOOSTO and 0 rating game.<br><br>Honestly the highlight of the season was the Oppai Dragon song at the end, the rest of the season felt skippable.</br></br>  did dxd jump the shark? except for like 3 scenes it wasn't funny or sexy at all. what kind of idiots would rather have terrible drama instead of stripper animations?  <br>More like THK jumped the shark by rushing through content and adding unnecessary filler.</br>  <br>TNK</br>  <br>Oppai Dragon Song was the best part.<br>God, they fucked up bad with S3</br></br>  <br> quality <br>  High School DxD  <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Terrible quality for a terrible series. Seems fair.</br>  <br> Animation was good <br>In the bizarro dimension.  Not the void. </br></br>  <br> Why was the quality in this season so fucking terrible? <br><br>Kenzen Robo and Blade Dance. Both had abysmal sales and zero profit in return.<br><br> Did it even sell well enough for another season? <br><br>Doesn't go on sale until the 24th of July, as far as pre-orders go:<br><br> Ease [-, --- positions] D [*, 128 place] Ani [# 169] Gemma [* # 83] HMV [n-- place] Software [* # 20] <br><br> http://www.getchu.com/nall/rank_re<wbr>serve.html?genre=anime_dvd</wbr> <br><br> (** 2,767 pt) [*, ** 8 Reserved] 2015/07/24 High School D × D BorN Vol.1 [Blu-ray] <br><br> (***, 933 pt) [*, ** 3 Reserved] 2015/07/24 [Amazon.co.jp limited] High School D × D BorN Vol.1 (with original Stan di POP) [Blu-ray] <br><br>Combined stalker points:<br><br> BDs combined: 3.7k <br> DVDs combined: 1k+ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Given the nips reception of the entire thing despite the original story, it will.

You're probably one of those people who think fanservice degrades an anime's quality or something.

All content added degrades the quality by some amount, but in exchange gives the experience of watching content of the quality that remains. The art of writing fiction involves including only that which is necessary, so that we do not degrade quality any more than absolutely necessary.</br>   watching DxD for anything other than ecchi <br> expecting anything other than ecchi from DxD </br>  When will Issei give Rias his DxD?  <br>I watch DxD for the Kibacakes.

Is it because of the whole "why would you want to experience the same story again" line of thinking? Because it's fucking stupid! Of course we want the same story again.
