I believe there may be one more but I don't have it.</br>    Name ONE SINGLE better team in the history of manga.   mangareader.net   <br><br>They have never been a functional team with all of them. In groups yeah.<br><br>So far they spent more of the manga beating each other up.</br></br></br></br>  Samefag is trying to poison the well, and make it seem that BnHA has a cancer fan base like Naruto. <br><br>Also change the file names.</br></br>  Is Satsuki-sama not the most perfect woman in the world?  <br>She has all the traits that I like but I have never even once fapped to her.<br><br> perfectly sized breasts <br> rear <br> blue eyes <br> long straight black hair <br> dominant <br> dat voice </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Outclassed by the main character...</br>  <br>Surely you jest</br>  <br> shonenshit <br> second best girl after ragyuo "outclassed" by the mc <br><br>no shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Edgeslut is an Alien and Satsuki-sama gave her hell as mere human.</br>  Literally the only character with common sense in the whole fucking fate universe.<br><br> Died </br></br>  <br>Meant Alice, not Tamamo. Should have been more clear.<br><br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively <br><br>True, its hard to determine his exact power level, but I still feel its a safe bet its higher up there than UBW.<br><br><br>Its an irregular RM, but it still is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice is a cheater and Archer still defeats her, so how could the queen's glass game be above UBW?</br>  <br>Because you use the Vorpal Blade to counter the Jabberwocky aspect of it. It'd be impossible for him to normally defeat her by his own power.</br>  <br> but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP. <br>You heared wrong.<br>She's one of the weakest servants seen so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger what<br><br>Tamamo is a fucking monster, she's mid-high tier in Extra and an utter beast in CCC</br></br></br>   Check catalog for Berserk <br> Nothing <br><br>Fix up, anons.<br><br>I like how Rickert is going through the same thoughts that Guts had after rescuing Casca in the conviction arc. Whether to leave for friends that he's lost or stay and protect his only remaining family.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's a surreal feeling seeing previews for the next chapter so soon. It's going to take a while for the fact that it's monthly to sink in for me.  <br>Fuck is he just going to skip the whole thing of elf island and do a time skip? I know that sounds far fetched but taking this much time away from the main character when we finally were about to some closure. Seems like he's just trying with our emotions</br>  i've been on vacations, does anyone have the link for the chapter?  <br>I couldn't find it in google</br>  <br><br>Dont think the ch has been translated yet, i have only found the Chinese raws</br></br>  Sweet Mami.  mumi  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128616108 <br>I don't degrade anything by posting cute, pure yuri</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128616069 <br> homusaya <br>SomuHaya</br></br>    Shh, loli is sleeping  Shh, loli is being gently raped  <br>Like 9/10 threads on /a/. <br><br>Well fucking done.</br></br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>That doesn't look like sleeping.</br>  <br>WAKE UP</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>    <br>Nice Bikki Boa!<br>Not OR.</br></br>  <br>Boa pls</br>  Requesting Aichi lazily playing a 3DS on a couch in casual clothing.
