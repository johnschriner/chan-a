He is also the final boss.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127649129 <br> Implying people wouldn't do the filthiest things if they had a super power of some kind. </br>  <br>Why does she talk like that? Is she autistic?</br>  <br>But why would she create an evil person.</br>   MC starts as a total inconsiderate elitist faggot <br> so retarded he actually spends more time tracking down people to copy from than actually trying to study <br> can't remember questions <br> gets exposed <br> suddenly he's turned into a nice beta faggot cookie cutter MC <br>Oh well, at least you tried for like 10 minutes.</br></br></br></br></br>  This will go full Clannad on you guys.<br><br>Story summary<br> Imouto's power is to erase one person at the time from existence alltogether, she erased their father by accident after an argument over their mother. Brother will slowly turn from asshole into decent person, but he will fuck up some stuff and he will force imouto to erase him and by that their father will be back. MC simply disappears from memories and reality. </br></br></br>  <br>She looks cute.<br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Fuck off wrinkle fag.</br>  <br>She's not gonna have spotlight, so don't bother.</br>  <br>Dropped after 15 minutes: the animation</br>  <br> suddenly he's turned into a nice beta faggot cookie cutter MC <br>Where are you getting this from? After he got exposed he ran away like a real man would and they literally had to beat and blackmail him to get what they wanted. That dude would have made it to vegas if they didn't have some high speed nigga on their team.</br></br>  <br> She's not gonna have spotlight <br>Yes she will. Pay attention.</br></br>  <br>So is P.A. Works gonna deliver again? People were shitting on them for taking some manga adaptation after Shirobako.</br>  <br>No she won't.<br>A secondary character and a little sister who has at most 2 possible uses:<br>Plot device and cheap drama.</br></br></br>  <br><br>wasn't this meant to be an original series?</br></br>  <br> P.A. Works gonna deliver again <br><br>They always do. Even if Glasslip just delivered fluffy and a god-tier OST.</br></br></br>  <br>It is. Don't believe those blatant lies.</br>  <br>No wrinkles here.</br>  Characters that deserve death:<br>Charlotte<br>Imouto<br><br>Characters that will probably live:<br>Charlotte</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this speculation. It's an anime-original work, after all. I'll take a crack at it.<br><br> The student council is actually a group of students that the government is trying to weaponize.  <br> They are placed on the student council to separate them from the rest of the student body so that they can leave class at convenient times to do missions and shit for the government  <br> The brother imouto and MC think they hazily remember isn't actually a brother, it's their sister, charlotte (who is currently disguised as Yumi).  <br> Charlotte has the ability to alter people's memories and outright erase them if she chooses to do so. <br> Alters MC and imouto's memories to forget her when she runs away from the school for super powered people (she was placed on the "student council" too) <br> Charlotte's power is flawed in that she ages backwards for every minute of memories that she alters <br> As such, she never graduates and loses the power because she always has to use it for government jobs which means she is never actually aging. <br> Can't take it anymore and runs away <br><br>and now depressing backstory because muh feels<br> Their parents died when they were little <br> MC always wished he was someone else (because then he'd have parents) <br> Charlotte alters their memories to become their single mother to get them out of their depression. Takes care of them <br> MC still longs to be someone else but doesn't know why, hence that opening scene  <br> Ends up having to leave them and make them harbor animosity towards her as the mother that foisted child custody on their uncle because she could never graduate super power school <br><br> Why is it even semi-plausible that Yumi/Charlotte is actually their sister? <br><br>Imouto and yumi have same ridiculous purple eyes. Their hair is similar (imouto always took after nee-chan, after all) in style/color. Yumi had to do bangs instead of parting it down the middle to hide her identity better. she also dyed it darker to hide her identity better. <br><br>Your turn, /a/nons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just realized charlotte is already some blonde chick. disregard that part about yumi being charlotte. yumi is still their sister for the purposes of my speculation though.</br>  <br>fuck off faggot</br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br> best imouto <br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this semen vacuum?</br>  <br> semen vacuum <br>I'd play video games (Halo ODST) with, eat ice cream with, play Monopoly with, and maybe cuddle with, but never would I do something so lewd. Maybe even  hold hands with  while we talk about the secrets of the universe.</br></br>  <br>I once saw a screenshot with this green hair making a similar pose like this one; can someone post it?</br>  <br>please respond.</br>  <br>Komachi has a name you fucking pleb.<br><br><br>Nah, i was about to post it but nah. Impatient fuckwit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry</br>  <br>Patience is a virtue. One a lot of people around here should utilize every now and then.</br>  So how many Key anime VA cameos will we get?<br><br>So far we've had Mai Nakahara and Tomoe Tamiyasu.</br></br>  What if something bad happens to imouto?  <br>I think you mean game. Also, it still baffles me how Tomoe voiced Riki, Rin, and Sasasegawa Sasami all at the same time.</br>  <br><br>Here's a bonus since I'm such a nice guy</br></br>  <br>Almost positive something bad will happen to imouto since she is the only decent character in the show.<br>When she dies, the anime will truly become worthless.</br></br>  <br>Was Clannad voiced in the original release?</br>  <br><br>If imouto get hurt, we riot</br></br>  <br> .gif <br>I'll probably end up watching the show and make some proper .webm out of it. How shit is it anyway?</br></br>  <br>It came out in 04, there was a rerelease in 06, and the anime was in 07, so I assume one of the games had voices before the anime.</br>  <br>First season was actually pretty good.</br>  <br>Maeda has not killed major characters in his stories since Little Busters, no idea why faggots still pretend he is some sort of edgemaster like le butcher</br>  <br>Can we please not turn this into another brand of generals? Like what happened to shitters such as <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127656472 </br>  Kinda on the fence with this one. The characters haven't interested me at all. MC is just a faggot with insecurity issues that likes to talk big. Imouto is cute though.  <br> Imouto is cute <br>This is reason enough</br></br>  <br>The MC is basically Kanye, with the same voice actor to boot.</br>  <br>Stop trying to police shit. Let the faggot talk about what he wants.</br>  <br>Look, I'm sorry. I just saw the "New thread" and "edition" in the OP and feared we were already devolving into generals.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127656472 <br> This is now an Oregairu thread. <br>No. My thread, you slut. I created this for the discussion of Charlotte &amp; the ever-cheerful &amp; chipper Ayu!</br></br>  <br><br>Don't worry anon, these threads have been pretty descent and anons are polite enough to let the thread reach page 10 before making another unlike yahari threads last season.</br></br>  MC is funny as fuck, I don't get why some of you guys have an issue with him. It's pretty obvious he's going to get a lot of character development.  <br>The imouto is too young to have any powers.<br> a small percent of children manifest super powers upon reaching puberty </br></br>  <br>Of course, Im glad Nao stopped him on his tracks right away. She just saved us from the generic antics of another light/lelouche gary stu.</br>  <br>Funny? In what way, anon?<br><br>People in the last thread were bitching about the MC being "edgy" for cheating in school and manipulating people. Peep the archive if you want a better idea but that's the gist of it. <br><br><br> gary stu  <br>How am I supposed to self insert as a good looking, semi-insane MC with subpar superpowers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Fuck that bitch and fuck her derailing my fun plot for some generic magical school bullshit.<br>I would have been fine if it was just him manipulating people with super powers and regular folks trying to catch him in the act, or how he would adjust his powers.<br>But then this bitch comes in and was like "nope, I'm the boss of you and you go to join the xmen"<br>Fuck this show, fuck her, and fuck you.<br>Yes, I'm mad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me what you expect from the next episode then, because you likely have the wrong impression.</br>  <br>I liked him too, and I hate Gary Stu characters. Gary Stu and Mary Sue were used to describe super idealized characters without flaws. But it was obvious from the beginning that the anime was painting him as a douchebag, that his hubris is, and evidently was, his downfall.</br>  <br>And it's also called a Tehepero you fucking fag.</br>  <br> not submitting to Nao-sama's will <br>Anon pls. Yu clearly lacks focus and insight, thats why he got caught. Inside the group he will develop and even learn how to use his power more effectively.</br></br>  <br>Go back to watching Death Note edgemaster.</br>  <br>But if she didn't stop him, he would have died of ClannAIDS or something. Now he gets to make lots of friends and watch one or two of them die of ClannAIDS instead.</br>  We're going to see her again, right? They didn't waste time designing her just to give her a minute's worth of screentime, right?  <br>Shut the fuck up already about that fucking bitch you fucking cunt.</br>  <br>Sure thing. This girl will be back too.</br>  This is obviously going to get dark and edgy, could be interesting.<br><br>From the looks of this, this appears to be the consequence of misusing your powers. Seems kind of extreme considering the powers we've seen so far are far too impractical to be used for anything big.</br></br>  <br>When I was in Akihabara and looking at all the advertisements for it, I thought it was a horror anime.</br>  <br>Why, don't you like pathetic main characters?</br>  <br>Looks more to me like the ones with proper and useful powers are taken away to experimentation, or otherwise are experimented on to make the powers stick or be more powerful, kind of like the level 6 program. I think they get anyone who abuses their powers pretty quick.</br>  <br>They shouldn't spoil, in my opinion. Just watching the first episode without looking into it (well I did know the studios involved in it so they are sort of a big hint but that aside) it looks like just looks like comedy chuuni stuff. Would have made a decent "surprise" I guess.<br><br>I really don't want imouto to get hurt. I know she will, though.<br><br><br>That's also certainly a possibility. Otherwise chances are Kanye might have already been hauled off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>delusions<br>Its the same everywhere, you get those who binge on all the material possessions and then you have the few who prepare for the future they want.</br></br>  <br> being this retarded <br>I honestly don't understand why everyone hates the MC. Aside from that stupid maniacal laugh and fake disguise, everything he's done has been pretty understandable. So the guy thinks he's the only one with powers. He is able to cheat his way through school and life in general, and he is physically attractive to boot. Would this not go to your head, anon? Would highschool you not think you were the shit? Then all of the sudden his world gets turned upside down when he gets busted (he loses his confidence in front of Yumi). And to top it all off he's forced to move. That's why he seems like a meek shithead now. Why is that pathetic?</br></br>  <br>People either like absolute betas that they can feel superior to, or powerful self-inserts that get everything they want while being a paragon of virtue.</br>  <br><br><br>God damn these qts.</br></br></br>  Good subs fucking when?  <br><br>Nigga, the protagonists of great fiction aren't great because of how they measure up to the viewer. Great protagonists are great because they are sympathetic characters. Because the audience can identify with them and understand their struggles. That's all that needs to happen. So far I've seen a protaginast who had a nasty reality check (who didn't think, at some point in highschool, that they weren't the shit?) and is struggling to control his surroundings. How the fuck can you not relate to that?</br></br>  <br><br>He's a pittiable douche in many ways, but the part where he stages the accident so he can save the girl was outright selfish and ridiculous. People keep overlooking this when they try an defend him. <br> b-but you would do the same thing too <br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Way to take what I said out of context, friend. I'm talking about him being pathetic. Not about him being a douche. I never said he's a great guy.<br><br>He thinks he's the shit and he wants other people to feel the same way. So he rescues a girl from a speeding truck. Anybody with half a brain wouldn't do something that risky but its a testament to how full of himself he is.</br></br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with what I'm talking about. What you described is what makes a good protagonist. I'm talking about the sort of people who hate the MC.</br>  <br>And since this is a Key anime, the truck driver probably killed a father of four beautiful children, who are now orphans, and will have to be sold into sex slavery to avoid starving.<br><br>That's right, folks. Kanye is behind all the Japanese Truck killings you've ever seen. He deserves none of your sympathy.</br></br></br>  <br>... so the sort of people who hate the MC don't know what a good protagonist is. That's my point.</br>  <br> QC finishing now. </br>  <br>Mazui?</br>  <br>Fyurie pls go.</br>  <br>This is at least the third time I see someone mentioning Mazui in these threads, what gives?</br>  <br>Right, but you replied and addressed me as though those were my views.<br><br> ... <br>Don't do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have to post this on every single Charlotte thread?</br>  <br>That happened,he was busted, and he acted pathetic because of that, he wouldn't be pathetic if there was no reason.Was it bad? No, and I will keep watching.</br>  <br>My bad, m8. When you said "people" I thought you were trying to speak for everyone (including yourself, of course). That didn't read like you were only trying to speak for the people that did not like him. <br><br>I did that so that I wouldn't have to start the sentence with "So." It suited my autism at the time. I'll see what I can do.</br></br></br>  I like the MC, at least he isn't a disgusting beta like bell from danmachi  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>Don't really think I can enjoy this anime.</br></br>  The MC treats women like shit and he's a manipulative arsehole.<br><br>I really think I'm going to enjoy this anime.</br></br>  <br>Do you really think he'll stay that way, anon? After having such a rude awakening from Yumi snd learning that he isn't the only special snowflake with powers?</br>  <br>I can see why you'd think that. No worries, it just keeps popping up a lot the past week.</br>  <br><br>Sorry, it's just me. <br><br> [GJM-Mezashite] Charlotte - 01 [40A3E193].mkv </br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks baby.</br>  <br>Well considering all the edgelords here would be disappointed if he started acting normal I really don't expect him to change.</br>  <br> not expecting character development <br>why am I taking this bait</br></br>  <br><br>I just want my smug MC, my smug FeMC and that qt redhead.</br></br>  I like this asshole mc. So far its great.   possession power only lasts five seconds <br> "so I can't use it for lewd stuff' <br>MC would have been a real criminal if his power wasn't shit.</br></br>    I'd let her roll roll her hands in front of me if you know what I mean.  Look at this face. Is this the face of evil?  Is this going to be another anime where nobody in the threads refer to the characters by their real names?  Whats this show about?  <br>No. Its just the first episode. No one remembers names in the first episode.</br>  <br>What do you mean? Charlotte is Charlotte.</br>  <br>No one cares about your fun. Go post on your blog.</br>  <br>Too bad the VA of Misuzu (Kawakami Tomoko) won't ever show up. She passed away in 2011 at the age of 41.</br>  Calling it now, imouto brainwashed Yuu to forget his long, lost brother.  <br>Watch the first episode and read the synopsis, you lazy fuck.<br><br>It has the potential to be very good or very generic. Cocky MC gets a reality check and is uprooted from everything that's familiar to him. Hopefully this covers his personal growth and explores peoples' powers rather than turning into another generic schoolshit comedy</br></br></br>  <br>Why not both, maybe it'll be both a school life comedy/drama and sci-fi horror at the same time.<br>I trust that the brilliant mind of Maeda Jun can pull it off, complete with sad girls in snow.</br></br>  <br>is this harem?</br>  <br><br>So generic it hurts. They even stressed it.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> Mai "Terminator" Nakahara <br>Oh, so she'll be back then?</br></br>  <br>No but this one is</br>  This show had the potential to be AOTS but they ruined it in the first episode.<br> MC is a smug asshole who thinks only of himself <br> Uses powers to cheat and get girls <br> No-fun-allowed student council shows up and everything goes to shit <br>I only wanted a 13 episode series of MC being an asshole then getting fucked when his powers fade, instead he is going to become Tomori's bitch and agree with her corrupted sense of justice</br></br></br></br>  <br>epic post +1</br>  <br><br>I came here for these two smugs. <br>Will the smug continue?</br></br></br>  <br> implying we know the student council is the fun police <br>They (presumably) stole his health records, made a mess of the town with teleportbro, and kicked the shit out of MC twice. <br>If  is anything to go on, these people aren't just at all.</br></br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>The student council and the underground lab are almost definitely not the same.</br>  <br>That's why<br> corrupted sense of justice <br>Student council is just as bad or even worse than MC if they are willing to do so much collateral damage to catch a guy who cheated on tests just because he is a potential danger.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>oh no, it is following me<br>begone I say</br></br></br></br>  <br>Has he finally discovered the joys of 2D?</br>  <br><br>Deathnotefag pls go.</br></br>   No qualms in getting other people hurt. <br>Damn, this nigga hard.</br>  <br>Don't know, I didn't even mean to post that screenshot but it's already too late, rip.</br>  <br>almost is good enough for my autism, at this point.<br><br>If they're just as bad as MC, why is that not "fun" to you? You just said that the show was "fun" when he was cheating and shit.</br></br></br>  When will he lost it?  <br>When Key happens</br>  <br>He's already lost it.<br><br> His memories, that is. </br></br></br>  <br>Camera girl thinks herself all high and mighty because she's protecting people from getting fucked by MC, while simultaneously having no qualms about destroying a bunch of shops and potentially injuring innocent people just to catch him. That's a corrupted sense of justice.</br>  <br>No, she doesn't. You should actually listen to what she's saying, not just assume things.</br>  <br>I'm not even an edgefag but I was honestly looking forward to more smug MC but now we'll just have annoying cunt main girl try to reform MC or some garbage.</br>  <br>And exactly WHAT is wrong with ellipses?</br>  <br>I want MC-kun to remain a bit of dick<br>But knowing its KEY, the suffering train will betatize him.<br>All I really want is him peeking down girls shirts while in their bodies. That level of evil is enough for me.</br></br></br>   another Key amnesia plot point <br><br>Jesus fucking Christ. Learn how to do something else already Maeda.</br></br>  <br> implying its not the secret to his success </br>  <br>...nothing...much that only if you use them...thoughts get a little spaced...and it looks like someone...is thinking their shit out as they post...and thinking that the person reading it is just fine with that...no matter what useless point they eventually conclude on...I hate it...!!!</br>  <br>Ellipses should only be used to indicate omissions in a quote, to indicate a character's broken train of outspoken thoughts aloud, or to indicate the trailing off at the end of spoken dialogue. Basically, only within quotation marks. In addition, they should be used sparingly. The use of ellipses as a sort of pause, as a replacement for another punctuation mark, or within the narration (i.e. out of quotes) is almost always wrong, unless used in a poetic sense. Furthermore, ellipses should never begin a sentence. The valid situations I listed above occur after a word.<br><br>Most importantly, using ellipses incorrectly makes you look like you're 12.</br></br></br>  <br> high and mighty <br>She was extremely nonchalant when she busted the MC for cheating and shit aside from the part about his medical exams where she said that he was lying about being narcoleptic. She could have way more in his face though. If anything, she seems very goal oriented. She did what her school (probably) told her to do. Investigate MC and relocate him if needed. She never said or implied that what he was doing is wrong.</br></br>  Nice.  Wait, KEY is involved? Dropped. It could have been interesting but I now know that it will be garbage no matter how good it will be perceived as being.  <br>NOTHING is wrong WITH ellipses. There IS also nothing WRONG with random CAPITALIZATION to act as IF you're yelling WHEN this is just TEXT. It doesn't EMPHASIZE your point IT just makes YOU look like YOU'RE underaged.</br>  jesus christ why the fuck would CR translate it as Horo-Hero when the fucking name was shown in the episode?  <br>They usually translate the script only.</br>   Rascal! <br>Heh.</br>  <br>Even the slightest bit of research could have easily given them the answer. It's only written all over both the official site and the English wikipedia page.</br>  Why is Takamatsu from Angel Beats in this animu? Did he get reincarnated?

Why would I willfully sound retarded?<br><br><br>No. What were these references?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>they were kinda small, in the beginning he quotes Descartes, "I think, therefore I am."<br><br>Also when he tells his little sister not to talk to her friends about stars, he says, "I learned this from my foundation and experiences"(Descartes and Hume) <br><br>I don't think there was a Kant reference.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alpha /=/ bad things never happen to you. In this context, anons are just calling him alpha because he has self-confidence.<br><br>Tired of MC's who call themselves losers or weak all the time. I'm also tired of characters that never act in their own interests. It's interesting when someone subverts that by turning their selflessness into a selfish desire like in Kokoro Connect though.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, the dream he had about the missing sibling can't be false because according to Descartes "You cannot have a self-contradictory image in your dreams"</br>  <br> this is what reddit cancer actually believe </br>  <br>It was the MC's monologue in the beginning, he started with Descartes, then ventured off into Kantian phenomenon, and wrapped it up with some Hume-style naturalism and free will.<br><br>As for the ellipses thing... who the fuck cares. It's an indicator of a pause or a tonality or a combination of both, and it really shouldn't get anyone's panties in a bunch so badly that every single instance of it on /a/ gets called out by a dozen "Fuck offs," which are ten times as annoying as the ellipses was to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br> this is what faggots with shit tier taste actually believe </br>  <br>Self-confidence? Did you see how crushed he was after he was dumped? He didn't walk that off at all. He was in the same state of shock when he got home from the cafe or whatever.<br><br>I'm not a fan of the limp-dick, meek MC either but this guy is far from alpha.</br></br></br>  <br> reddit cancer trying to fit in </br>  <br>Of course he was crushed, but he didn't suddenly doubt all of his abilities or looks. If he wasn't confident, he'd be sitting in a corner calling himself worthless like that faggot from Mirai Nikki. He still thinks he's clever and deserves shit. He'll continue to act in his own interests.</br>  <br>  Did you see how crushed he was after he was dumped? <br>His ego got damaged but recovered quickly, after all he didn't care for the girl that much.</br></br>  <br> trying to fit in <br><br>You just did all the work for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, faggot. We're trying to discuss a show here while you defend bad grammar.</br>  <br> Fuck off <br>Like I said, ten times worse, every time.</br></br>  <br>Don't know how I missed that first one. My subs fucked with the second one. What subs did you use?<br><br>A cursory Google search doesn't give me shit for that quote. It's also kind of a stretch but interesting nonetheless. <br><br>Cool. Regardless though, I still misused it. <br><br>Just because something didn't happen does not necessarily mean the other did. I could just as easily say that because he didn't have a monologue psyching himself up afterward, he's no longer confident. <br><br>He didn't even notice blondie letting herself into his apartment or whatever because he was still thinking about getting dumped. That's not a quick recovery or a girl that he didn't care about.<br><br>You may have the support of trips but a few posts here saves a shit load elsewhere if I were to do the same thing in a bigger thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking pedo. How could u get off to the idea of removing a little girl's clothes and licking her tiny body all over, nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples? Only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva, pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts, the cum more than her little throat can swallow. The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down her chin over her flat chest, her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to her pure, tight, virginal pussy, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum, while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke.<br>I am disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over her, listening to her quickening breath, her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling rapidly to meet yours. It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her, feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest, her neck and her armpits, savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax, hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her, pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshly-deflowered pussy for the first time, filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop her flushed body, she sighs breathlessly and her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside her again. Sick fuck.</br></br>  <br>Thank you so much. I was literally going skeletons.exe!<br><br><br>Based Aikatsukin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> All hail lelouche </br>  <br>I feel like Lelouch got reincarned with a new geass everytime I think of the mc.</br>  SHE'S AS COLD AS ICE  <br><br><br>Fuck this meme. The only thing similar about the two characters is that their special power bullshit allows them to compel others to do something (and even then, Lelouche's was way stronger in every way) and both of them have visual cues on the eyes to tell the audience when it's used. Their personality, motivations, and everything else that matters are very different. <br><br>Yes I'm the same guy from the other thread. Prove me wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she turned cold as fuck in an instant.</br>  <br> Best girl will never win the hentaibowl <br>I don't understand why shows like that exist. What's the point of getting a bunch of cute girls who want the MC's dick when he just chooses the worst one and the rest all suffer?</br></br>  <br>I felt so pissed when that student council bitch ruined everything, hoping she suffers. But I guess he gets to suffer for getting caught</br>  <br>bitch just showed her true colors.</br>  <br>Is this logical thinking?</br>  <br>This, I hope the studio burns.</br>  <br>She was nice to him and took him out for lunch because he just saved her life. Then he ditches her and runs away, and all of a sudden he's acting like they should be together when they barely know each other, because it was part of his plan. Nigga came across as creepy as shit.</br>  Tomori is a bitch  <br>Do you think she makes "home videos"?</br>  <br> wanting P.A. Works to burn <br>I want you to burn.</br></br>  <br><br>This is just my crazy theory but I think her red-haired friend has a power that lets her control minds to some extent, as in making them believe what she says. Yumi didn´t quite realize what happened at the beggining then immedeatly starts lusting for MC's dick, as in begging him to come to eat pancakes. That'd explain her change of personality because red-haired friend's influence faded.</br></br>      <br>I don't know about that, but while I do think Yumi's going to become irrelevant, I'm almost certain Red is going to come back.</br>  <br>Just noticed the Houshinoumi logo in her uniform. Nice.<br><br>Awesome premise, music and animation all around, PA Works is finally back to its top form.</br></br></br>  <br> PA Works is finally back to its top form <br><br>What about Shirobako?</br></br></br>  Is this 13 episodes? We all saw what happened to Angel Beats...  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=D3r<wbr>NBAMt-kg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Mediocre, visually unimpressive and also unrealistic considering the setting it had.</br>   tfw i have no sister <br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br> We all saw what happened to Angel Beats.. <br> Top selling and most popular Key IP <br> Top selling and most popular PAWorks IP <br><br>Why do you think Charlotte even came to exist?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she makes animal videos.</br>  <br> best imouto ever <br> not even a best imouto this season </br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean it was handled well.</br>  <br>It means hipster opinions mean jackshit beyond the hipster bubble that is this shithole.</br>  <br>Not him but just because it sold well doesn't mean the show was good, retard. It had potential and some moments, but nothing ever delivered and had no sense of direction at all.</br>  They clearly gave the most OP half assed ability to the MC, HOW FUCKING UNCOMMON.<br><br>He can easily just kill them if he wants too, 5 seconds is enough.</br></br>  <br>I imagine she'd have this expression during sex.</br>  <br>she looks like a shit potato</br>  <br><br>yu's power have so much more potential than Light's death note you faggot<br>I'm mad because first it looks like a better version of Death Note but then it becomes some magic high school bull shit</br></br></br>  <br>What happens if he kills himself in the 5 seconds?</br>  Why does she speak like this?  From the shadow of SMUG, a new empress is born  <br>She's got a long way to go if she wants to overthrow last season's queen of smug.</br>  <br> MC would have been a real criminal if he wasn't so fucking retarded <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>She did.</br>  <br>I would totally have.</br>  <br>n-nano desu</br>  Anyone realize that the imouto speaks with "de gozaru" at the end of her sentences?<br>Do you think she's just eccentric or is it related to her power?</br>  <br>I feel you bro, say goodbye to your "easy" life, public life that is.At least he didn't go full crazy and tried to kill the girl using the dude.</br>  <br>How will that happen? He's controlling the other guy.</br>  <br> Lelouche's was way stronger in every way </br>  <br>my Dad remarried a nip and I can confirm this, and that he's a beta faggot because of it</br>  <br> trying to kill her using glasses-kun <br> Tomori just turns off glasses-kun visual perception until the 5 seconds are over <br><br>Tomori is super effective against Yu, he has zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Moe as fuck</br>  <br>The last thread had more buttmad people. You might have liked that one more. <br><br>He can't control someone that he can't see and he can't see invisibitch or the teleporting guy if they activate their abilities. He also cabt control more than one person at a time so the chances kf him killing 2 people are slim. Also why would he kill them? That'd be pretty out of character for him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just tap into Tomori and make her jump from the building.<br>Surely those 5 seconds will be over before she falls.</br></br>  <br>a bitch heroine and a faggot MC<br>please staph Maeda, please</br></br>  <br>That wasn't confidence. That was an ego.<br>The MC strikes me as cowardly and weak person, and that's before the student council showed up.</br></br>  <br>When?</br>  How many commercial trucks have been SUPPORTING CHARACTERS in anime so far?  <br>When he was in the student council room retaking his exam? That wouldn't be a very far fall. The pavement is pretty much horizontal from the window's view.</br>  <br>I meant from his new house</br>  <br>It'd be a little late to murder them at that point, anon. His secret was already out.</br>  Is there going to be incest in this?  How old is imouto?  <br>Then maybe in the lake?<br>Could he possibly make her drown in 5 seconds?</br></br>  <br> Key <br>What do you think?</br></br>  <br>old enough.</br>  <br>Is that a no or a yes?</br>  <br>Not unless he conveniently already had a ton of cinder blocks tied to some netting laid out on some dock that he could roll her up in and jump into the lake with, all in 5 seconds.<br><br>And last I checked he didn't plan on skydiving into that lake with glasses kun.</br></br></br>  Best girl.  I want to beat her up, rape her and then steal her camcorder.  <br> not stealing the camcorder then filming you fuck her <br>You had one job.</br></br>  <br><br>I like your theory.</br></br>  <br>He can control the dude and kill the invisible chick. It's not like they have their habilitied activated all the time</br>  <br>The invisible chick can then make herself invisible to the dude and kill him.</br>  <br>Did she came from Air?</br>  <br>Alright how about this, get a gun into the hand of the teleport dude, take his body over, shoot Sue Storm in the fucking face, toss gun back to self just in time to pick it up and shoot teleporting dude as he's briefly stunned by the sight of the chick with the top of her head blown off.</br>  The exam didn't even seem to be mathematical.<br>Did he not even look at the questions he answered?</br>  <br>Yeah that was a total scrub move, if you take an exam once and learn the answer to every single question, you should really be able to do it again without cheating and at least get a 90.</br>  <br>Good luck shooting someone you can't see.</br>  <br> shoot Sue Storm in the fucking face <br>How? She already became invisible</br></br>  <br><br>But if she made herself invisible to MC, he would be able to see her from teleporter dude's body, wouldn't he?</br></br>  <br>We'll see. If her power targets the "soul" rather than a physical body, then even if MC were to keep switching he wouldn't see her. In this episode, for example, he hadn't seen her before she revealed herself to him despite him switching with other people in the same room as her.</br>  Just watched the first episode and holy shit was that first have up to Nao's introduction fantastic. MC was a smug Kanye and a complete piece of shit. I loved it.<br><br>Second half with the changing of schools was kind of a bummer, overall this starter episode was a perfect hook.<br><br>MC needs to stay a smug bastard until the end or I will wind up very disappointed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get a good balance of the MC being a smug little shit and messing with people and him falling on his ass and getting slapped around by the other people in the school council.</br>  <br>That's a good point, I forgot he didn't see her when he took over the seitokaicho's body. That must be how it works then, unless he was really just that distracted by the porn he was holding.</br>  <br>It's been this way for a LONG time.</br>  <br>I have to wonder why /a/ keeps going back to anime that has the same themes. It's like women who constantly get into relationships with guys who drink a lot and beat them. You would think "we" would learn our lesson eventually, but we keep coming back to the same ol' same old shit.<br><br>Moefags didn't ruin the industry, it was people who kept giving the illusion that it was popular. People who wanted more quirky grills in their Chinese cartoons. People in general.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty funny that "school" is a genre. I can't really think of any other medium where you'll find that as a genre tag in like half the entries in that medium.</br>  <br>She's already imouto of the season. Maybe even loli of the season too.<br><br>Also, her third person speech is moe as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, it makes a lot of sense for Japan to have "school" be a genre. That's half their life, doing shit in school for university. Going through hell of exams, just to be another number in a box designed to be just as bad as school. Dogs and Demons is an excellent book, but it puts it all into perspective what kind of messed up culture Japan has. I honestly cannot find it in my heart to blame anyone there for being a social outcast, since it's almost impossible to make it the legitimate way.</br>  <br>It's not really cute, since it smacks of "special snowflake" crap that most moé shit is.</br>  <br>Nah her 3rd person speech is fucking retarded. If I knew a girl like that in real life I would avoid her like the plague.</br>  <br>She'll grow fox ears and tail soon enough.</br>  If I take away the camcorder, will she die?  <br>I think it would [REC] her badly.</br>  <br>I hope the MC possesses her and just fucking hurls it against a wall or something.</br>  <br>It's called 3DPD for a reason</br>  <br>top rek</br>  <br>trips confirm.</br>   there are people who wouldn't watch a show because they don't like the MC <br>Do you watch shows for a good story or to make imaginary friends?</br>  <br>to self-insert, is there other reason?</br>  I don't really get you guys, /a/.<br><br>You're always going on about how you all hate generic SAO male protagonists, but then an MC comes up who looks like he's going to veer away from the norm, and everyone shouts 'Edgy!'.</br></br>  <br>People watch fate, and that one have no good story, but it has a harem. So yeah, people watch things to self-insert.</br>  <br>Not "everyone", just a vocal minority.<br>This is probably the best rated first episode of the new season so far.</br></br>  Kinda unrelated but can anyone here read japanese?<br><br> I'm trying to communicate with a seller and I think I said something really fucked up or something happened and I don't know whats going on any more.</br></br>  <br>It would be extremely painful.</br>  <br>For you.</br>  <br>possesses her and break her virginity<br>now that would be both extremely painful AND fun</br></br>  <br>If she turns invisible while youre fucking her, will your dick be visible or not?</br>  <br/>  Why does she look like GGO kirito  <br> he was manipulating Yumi to love him <br>He really wasn't. At best, what he did was a rather elaborate trick to break the ice and have them meet. Aside from its scale, it's really not much different from spilling a drink or tripping or whatever else people do to accidentally™ start talking with a girl. <br><br>The only deceitful thing are his grades. Yumi may have found his grades and the supposed effort he puts towards achieving them to be attractive when it's in fact nothing but a hoax. Cheating is a very real life skill in the world though, and I am sure it could have been cleared up later some time down the line eventually. <br><br>But that's aside the point. The point is that he never manipulated her. He just presented himself as a man with achievements he doesn't technically have.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are Megashite's subs better than CR's?  <br> is anything better than CR <br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>As long as they aren't localised to shit like CR's were I'll be happy  de gozaru </br>  So what's with the comet(?) in the logo? Could that be Charlotte?  <br>Deep.</br>  <br> http://charlotte-anime.jp/music/ho<wbr>w-low-hello/</wbr> <br> 通称：ハロハロ <br>They adapted Haro-Haro.</br></br></br>  Who's Charlotte? The girl with the cam?  <br><br><br><br>You know what's the issue here? This is an Aniplex's script, not an in-house translation, this is just the production company not knowing their own materials.</br></br></br></br>  Just watched nico stream and find out there's episode 2 preview, seems preview will release after nico aired  <br> when it's used. <br>They both have a real soft spot for their little sisters who they consider to be their only real family. <br>They both grin, smile, and laugh manically. <br>They were both confident to a fault. <br>And the way he tries to analyze everything bis also reminiscent of Lelouch. <br>Not to mention how they aren't too dissimilar visually. <br><br>I don't even care much for Lelouch and Yu has in one episode almost been more entertaining already. But you can't honestly argue that there are no similarities, can you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is Tomori going to be the new Kanade?  Episode 2 preview is out<br><br>http://charlotte-anime.jp/story/02.<wbr>html</wbr></br></br>  <br> http://charlotte-anime.jp/story/02<wbr>.html</wbr> <br> the uploader have not made it available for your country <br>Dammit why do people do this, off to proxies I go</br></br></br>  <br>Aniplex as usual</br>  <br>that would trigger me very hard</br>  <br>What's wong with Tenshi?</br>  Come on Tomori, it just episode 2  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>08614</wbr>  <br>http://japanwebproxy.com/index.php?<wbr>x=Mfv0Kfa6bO93J3KSIq91JfrEnu5DL20RJ<wbr>2h0o2G%2FJD1AwCX0tpXiotJXrw%3D%3D</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>She is so best and that's why</br>  Confirmed for tenshi  <br>Maybe she has the KEYaids instead</br>  <br>Beautiful.</br>  <br>We can only hope</br>  <br>I kind of like her character though.</br>  <br>she ruined my self-insert</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  I thought it would be nice at first, selfish, very human MC. Then he already got caught in the middle of first ep. I hoped that at least he might try to fight or salvage the situation with his power anyways, but nah, generic 'join our super brigade' scene.<br>And then it became supernatural powers club/student council anime #2356.</br>  Charlotte is cute. CUTE.  First half was nice, Yuu was relatable as in anyone would have used that power for the same things, look at boobs, get revenge on other people and cheat on tests(though most smart people would just take 90% of the test instead of acing like the egoistic idiot the MC is), the truck thing was a bit too much and rightfully so, made me feel he was a bit too unresponsible and needed to be stopped somewhat. The second half is way too much punishment though, it makes both Nao and Joujirou quite unlikable, they get him expelled, force him to join another school and the student council, beat him up and by proxy get him dumped, a mere secluded threat would have been fine.<br><br>Overall it was good enough to keep watching but they will have to make Nao likable as fuck the next few episodes if they expect me to give a fuck about that smug little bitch.</br></br>  <br>Someone censor the chopsticks.</br>  <br>That would be a very tiny penis anyway, Anon.</br>   Posses the two people who know his secret <br> Force them to commit suicide. </br>  <br>I want to nibble her ears.</br>  What's the story for this bad anime?  <br>Not for asians.</br>  <br>I hope she will be more than just plot device, she really is the cutest and most amusing.</br>  <br>Point taken.</br>  <br>If you're cornered like that, I'd guess first thing you'd try to do would be to posses one of them and try to kill the other and then themselves or something. Or at least make the girl destroy the camera/memory card. They would probably stop him, since they have powers too and there's more of them, but still, it was weird he just run away without trying anything.</br>  I wish she didn't talk in third person, but whatever, she's a great character. <br><br><br>Watch the episode, ya big dingus. <br><br><br>He's a kid. Sure he cheats and stuff, but murder is a pretty big leap.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They probably aren't the only people that knew his secret, and murder is a far worse crime than anything he has done, so i don't think he would or should have done it. What he needed to do was not blatantly cheat everything perfect, since that is what gives him away.</br>  <br>I´m offended as an Afro-American. Not every race have the same size as represented in porn.</br>  If anyone wants to have a look at the preview,  Why does she wear the camera?  If you had his power, how would you use it? Cheating is nice and all, but what's the point of getting good grades and graduating from a good university if you don't actually know anything at the end?  <br> bottom left <br>Oh god. Magneto.</br></br>  <br>CG mobs getting BTFO.</br>  <br>This is Key alright.</br>  <br>Shit's going down next episode</br>  <br>So what you're saying is you have a small dick for a nigger</br>    <br>I'd try to limit the use to minimum, do something that sets me for life once or just over just a few uses and then keep my head low. How exactly... would need to figure something out with some kind of lottery or something like that, because I don't think possesing a CEO of some corp and then writing a check would work in the long run, even if you could pull it off in 5 seconds.</br>  <br>I want to beat her up and steal her camera.</br>  <br>We're not mad at the protag.<br><br>We're mad at the fuckers wanting him to go all Light and murderous and edgy.<br><br>There's a difference</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking something along the lines of what he did with Yumi. Find a CEO or other wealthy businessman and save him from a truck, get offered a job when you graduate high school as a reward.</br>  <br>is this going to turn into one of those dic pics threads?</br>  <br>He wasn't expelled, he was forcefully transferred (the difference is what effect that will have on his future). And he got himself dumped by pulling Shirayanagi so hard she fell, and then instead of helping her he cursed and ran away from what was presumably a threat, leaving her to the wolves.</br>  All the doujin potential though.<br><br> MC goes in to have a bath, and actually remembers to lock the door behind him <br> Gets undressed <br><br> It turns out Nao was there naked and invisible the whole time and because he locked the door she couldn't find an opportunity to leave <br> Things progress from there </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even know man. I'm not creative at all.<br>And if I did have a power like that, especially from birth, I wouldn't think to keep it a secret until way too late. Fuck, even if it only starts at puberty like everyone said I still wouldn't be able to keep that secret.<br><br>I'd probably use it to get revenge on people though. Especially if it was around middle school when I got them.<br><br>Good question indeed. Assassination is the most pratical use I can think of, really. Easy as fuck to kill someone with only 5 seconds in the right setting, and if all you have to do is see then you can do it from miles away with just a telescope/binoculars.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> telescope/binoculars <br>Is that MCs reason for having one?</br></br>  Why didn't he just study?  <br>Hell just possess them and jump in front of a train. No way it can be seen as anything but a suicide. Still, I don't know what reason I'd have for killing anybody. I wish you could use it to steal, or something else for moneymaking.</br>  <br>Isn't it his sister's? Even so, what would he even use it for? Assuming he's not killing people.<br><br>I think it might have been cooler if he had the power to jump bodies after 5 seconds, not just get sent back to his body.</br></br></br>  <br> Even so, what would he even use it for? <br>Another anon said it already but you can jump into a person having sex. <br><br>If you would want to become a criminal you could even use it to break into a house.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You would be the best assassin ever, as long as the target does not sit in an underground bunker all the time. Make them jump out the window, make their own bodyguard shoot him. <br>Keep doing it though and you're gonna get busted, either because of revenge or by federals who are actually much smarter than media would want you to believe. You'd have to be a pro at underworld shit before you even started.</br></br>  <br>Posting superior version</br>  <br>Huh, that could be fun.<br> Jump to the first person you see consecutively and see how far you can get without the 5 seconds per person running out </br></br>  <br>Nigga's gonna explode.</br>  If you really aren't above stealing, you could stand outside of banks, and when people take money out of the atm, possess them and make them hand off the money to you. It'd take practice, and would be much easier with an accomplice, but it's possible.<br>Also, you could possess a rich person, have them hide their money somewhere or throw it in the trash, and then you go fetch it later.<br><br>Not to mention insurance fraud.</br></br></br>  <br> possess them  <br> hand yourself money  <br> five seconds is up <br> ???  <br><br>Might as well just take it from their hands. Could work with an accomplice though, if you can possess from a good enough distance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait this is bait<br><br>damnit FUCK YOU KEY</br></br></br>  Nice booty.  <br>Now if only she can stroke my hamster with that speed.</br>  <br> his power is not op enough </br>  <br> X-Men <br> Study </br></br>  <br> treats women like shit <br>He let the normal girl down easily, why even go to the trouble if he treats them like shit?<br>He also treats his imouto properly. Yes, he's a manipulative asshole who has no regard for others, but he at least treats them right to maintain his image.<br>It's obvious he will change though, Maeda stated he is an imperfect MC that will undergo a lot of development.<br><br><br><br> Breakneck movement <br>It explains his inability to stop better than "teleportation".<br>Fuck CR.<br><br><br>He won't change right away. He's still hostile toward them for now. Plenty of time for smug asshole antics.<br><br><br>That was in the first PV too.  It also looked like she was in a wheelchair. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way I was thinking of was a bit different, but I realized you should be able to see the person, so I guess it wouldn't work.<br><br>You could use the power for betting on games, and especially for reading cards at casinos.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Make them put the money somewhere they won't find it. Using trashcans is a good idea.</br></br>  <br>Something horrible will happen to her. I bet my balls on it</br>  <br>she is getting cancer? anon she is getting cancer right? please tell me she gonna get cancer</br>  Was the Little Busters anime really bad?  <br>Gambling might be good, though I suppose people would begin to wonder why you're fucking passing out all of the time. You'd have to get good at possession while maintaining an upright position or something. But yeah checking other people's hands at poker would be sweet. <br><br><br>Right, I guess they don't remember anything so that could work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  she poops from there  </br>  <br> . It also looked like she was in a wheelchair. <br>That's wrong. She was walking along the MC and pushing someone in wheelchair. The same shot is show in the episode two preview so that is something that happens eary on.<br/></br></br>    <br>I like it.</br>    <br>That angry one is adorable</br>  <br>So she can blush too.</br>  <br> dat sigh <br>MUH DICK</br></br>    <br>She looks to sad.

And it ended on such a friggin sweet fluffy way too.</br></br></br></br>  .<br>Hyuuga Hinata’s thoughts had wandered over to a place beyond the sky again.<br>Neji nii-san…<br>Glancing out the waiting room’s window, she could see the blue sky free of any clouds.<br>I’m getting married.<br>She whispered those words inside her heart, and turned to look at the young man standing next to her.<br>Looking at the intense look on his face, her heart started thudding despite herself. Even though she’d always been looking at him, just being with him like this made her pulse rate pick up like it had the very first day she’d met him.<br>Naruto’s unflinching eyes were looking at the Hokage Monument, the faces of previous Hokage carved into rock.<br>Or rather, to be more accurate, he was looking at the carved face of Namikaze Minato. His dad.<br>Just looking at him as he did that, Hinata felt so full of emotion, her chest could burst.<br>Ahh, she thought. Right now, this second…<br>Standing next to the person she loved like this made her feel unbearably happy. She was so happy, she couldn’t even hope to express it with words.<br>This moment is bliss. Hinata thought, simply, honestly.<br>As she did, maybe he noticed she was looking, because his eyes turned to meet hers.<br>Hinata’s face turned red. She ended up fidgeting a little.<br>He gave her an embarrassed grin too. The serious look on his face turned into another one, innocent like a young boy. She adored every single one of his facial expressions.<br>Her father Hiashi and little sister Hanabi entered the waiting room.<br>It was almost time.<br>Hinata took Naruto’s arm, and held on tight.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>Uzumaki Naruto and Hyuuga Hinata.<br>Their wedding ceremony now begins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks anon</br>   thumbs up on his own wedding photo <br> his house has a balcony with a view of the giant ass statue of his face <br>how fucking arrogant is this little shit</br></br>  <br>They really should make at least an OVA of this</br>  <br>more like 1 hour special episode</br>  <br>I still am in utter belief that fucking Naruto, one of the shittiest, managed to somehow redeem itself with its ending. I had so much anger and animosity towards it, but all I can feel is a bittersweet happiness at how it ended. God bless Kishimoto for having the best taste in ships.</br>  <br> they fucked that night </br>  fuck off  <br> Kurama watched the whole thing <br> Probably took over one of the Naruto's Clone and sandwiched her with Nardo </br></br>  <br>Is Pierot retarded enough not to do it?<br>The Konoha and Shikamaru Hidens are the only ones I've read, but they would make for some actually good material to make, instead of botched and sorely disappointing exam arcs.</br></br>  <br>iirc exam arc was they did back when shippuden was a thing but arc was scraped/unfinished so what they did is they continued the arc right before gai vs madara fight to gain time <br><br>also SP is huge NHfaggots and i bet they would make anime adaptations of at least 2 said books</br></br></br>  <br>My problem is that when you take something potentially interesting and useful for world/character building and make a half-assed mess of it not only are you producing some shitty filler, but wasting an opportunity for someone decent to do a good job of it later.<br><br>Skipping stage 3 in particular was truly stupid, almost as bad as promoting fucking everyone and even giving Neji a double promotion for kind of saving the Kazekage's life, but not promoting the MC for doing way more than that. It's fucking stupid.<br>At least stage 2 could have shown characters really grown and taking charge at the right points, but instead what we got was jobbing against joke characters and never really having a decent fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if Naruto shopped Sasuke into this wedding photo later.</br>  <br>I don't think he knows how to computer much, he merely uses it to shitpost on ninja /a/.</br>  <br>newfag here, are these novels canon? were they made or supervised by kishimoto?</br>  <br>I think they are written by his assistants or something.</br>  <br>I dunno, but at least whoever write them seem to care more about the non Naruto and Sasuke characters more than Kishi does.</br>  <br>It supposed to be bridge between part 2 and 3</br>  <br>Is there actually going to be a part 3? Couldn't they at least wait 20 years like Dragon Ball did?</br>  <br>Gotta milk the dead cow while it still warm<br>And about dragonball theres still time to liquidify the bones and make milkshake</br></br>  <br>Nah. Only Sakura cuts herself and Sasuke into photos together.</br>  <br>Look at this smug cunt, marrying the man of her dreams and having a wonderful family.</br>  <br>He saved all sentient beings. He's entitled to some arrogance.</br>  <br>btw movie isnt released yet fujoshits already started to draw shit like this<br> tfw we probably get borumitsuki doujin before naruhina </br></br>  Do you guys like cute stuff?<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/vItnC</br></br>  <br>Where's that guy who always talks about lolinata and shotaruto?</br>  <br>right here<br>Naruhina a shit<br> ShotarutoLolinata the best <br>also Orochimaru, Madara and Shizune best waifu<br>gotta sleep</br></br></br></br></br>  I like the new ending.  <br>Pretty dick move not to invite Orochimaru and Kabuto</br>  <br>They would be stupids if they don't do it</br>  <br>How did Ino and Sai end up together?</br>  <br> Shikamaru's chapter <br>Damn he's an idiot, even Chouji realizes about it</br></br>  <br>Sasuke is the background aka Darkness</br>  <br>they must have retconned his gayness im order ro make shitty next gen kids<br><br>nh (and shikatema i guess) are the only good pairings to come out of the nardo end.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura pasting herself over Karin's picture and chimping out and making her kid cry at being reminded of the fact Sasuke doesn't care about her was the funniest thing to come out of gaiden</br>  <br>ino does some deep-sea diving into his mind in shikamaru hiden, that sorta kickstarts their relationship</br>  <br> Mind rape. </br>  <br>adorable as fuck</br>  <br><br> Ino <br> bigger than Temari <br><br>H-h-how?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ino does some deep-sea diving into his mind <br><br>Didn't she see how many penises were in there?</br></br></br>  <br>He's just drawing Ino.

For what? <br> Maybe she felt awkward in front of such a fancy looking place? <br> If such a high class place had prices that were too high for him to afford, then of course Shikamaru was going to give up. He’d think it was a shame, but he would. But they wouldn’t ever know without going in and checking the place out. Whether his decision would be to go for it or pass, he’d still have to look at the rooms and hot springs. He had no way to work around it. It was going to be a problem if they just gave up right in front of the place’s doors. <br> “Temari, for now how about we just go in, and then you can think about it. Okay?” <br> “I– it’ll be too late to think about once we go in. I could get carried away with the atmosphere, so…” <br> “What do you mean?!” <br><br>GOD DAMN IT, WHY IS HE SO STUPID!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's an aussie camrip floating around and an HD Korean dub with shit subtitles.</br>  <br>Because he's a genius.</br>  <br><br>Because he has a Temari-sized blindspot in his head, and has since he was fucking twelve.</br></br>  Why is Sauce so autistic?  <br><br>Temari always did get by on her personality, anon.<br><br> that was her strategy for getting shikamaru <br> you can spend time with me and not fight down constant urges to commit sudoku <br> but also have heterosexual sex for the purposes of procreation </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He absolutely couldn’t understand what Temari was saying. Shikamaru was at his wits’ end. <br> What on the world was going on? The atmosphere? Did she mean the old-fashioned atmosphere of the inn? Carried away? Swept away? Was she talking about the pond? He didn’t understand a thing. <br> However, he knew one thing for a fact: <br> There’s definitely something wrong with Temari today. <br> Shikamaru looked carefully at Temari’s face, staring as he gave her a once over. Temari hurriedly looked away from his gaze. As she did, her face was turning bright red. <br> “You…” Shikamaru slowly said. “Don’t tell me you…” <br> He put his hand on Temari’s forehead. She let out a startled sound, her whole body shivering with a jolt. It was probably because his hand was cold. <br> “You’re burning up, aren’t you?” He asked. <br> Temari’s forehead felt slightly warm. But, it didn’t look like a fever. On the other hand, she had turned bright red up to her ears. <br><br>She's like a motherfuckin' water flow down there and he doesn't realize about it. It makes me mad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cause Kishi actually somehow managed to write a love story worse than Twilight.</br>  <br>Asuma must be on the edge of resurrecting himself to slap the shit out of him.</br>  <br>You can't assume the sandiest vagina is wet, anon.

The only thing that matters is muh original T7.</br>  <br>Yamato got sidelined the hardest of everyone. He didn't even get an awkward scene with Hashirama. Poor bastard.</br>  <br>Yamato at least got to help Naruto with the rasen shuriken training and his tailed beast training. Though it's pretty sad that in the end he aged up the worst and his job is to sit outside Orochimaru's cave with a telescope.<br><br>Sai was just there so Naruto has someone besides Sakura to speak to in fillers and filler movies.</br></br></br>  <br>They have the Shueisha seal of approval. If thats enough for you to consider them to be canon, then they are. I do, and until Kishimoto says otherwise, they are canon for me.</br>  <br>Forget to say that Shueisha also published an official timeline with chapter 700 --&gt;The Last--&gt;The Novels--&gt;The Gaiden. So I don't think there's anything more to be said.<br>Someone should ask Kishimoto (when he comes to the USA in october) if he gave the ideas and general guidelines to the authors, or did they had free reign to do what they wanted.</br></br>  <br>The new ending hurt them more.</br>  <br>Pierrot gives no damns</br>  <br>If only he had been around during her Itachi phase.</br>  <br>Are they NS fags?</br>  <br><br>underrated poost</br></br>  <br>YouTube link?</br>  <br>Is that Hinata eating more ramen than Naruto?</br>  <br>"Kakashi-sensei, can Orochimaru pleaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase come to my wedding?"<br>"He's still an S-rank missing ninja."<br>"Awh, come on!

Looks like the guy that OP linked to has translated Shikamaru, Konoha and Gaara Hidens, but isn't doing Akatsuki, Kakashi or Sakura Hiden. Someone on Reddit is apparently doing Kakashi and Sakura at the moment, but no word on when they'll be fully complete.  <br>How many endings are there?</br>  <br>Can't wait to see some fillers about it. I would be okay with this</br>  <br>  Fillers about what's under Kakashi's mask <br>  No fillers about inter-personal relationships between the teams <br><br>I am not ok with this.<br><br>I do hope that all the Hidens get translated sooner or later.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome, I didn't know this guy was doing the Gaara Hiden.</br>  <br>You're quite welcome<br><br><br>Yes, yes we do TL Anon<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup yup yup. It bugs me though, because they're not doing Kakashi Hiden, and that's the first one, and Jesus Christ is bugs me when I read things out of order, even if they're not direct sequels.</br>  <br>His older brother killed his entire family when he was six and forced him to watch on repeat for a subjective 72 hours before telling him to live an unsightly hate filled life. Then, when he was thirteen, an amoral scientist put a small piece of him in his soul just before his brother returned to make him watch the death of his entire family for 72 hours AGAIN. Then, when he's fifteen (sixteen?) he finally gets revenge on his brother only to find out that he was following orders, never wanted to do it, and only kept from killing himself to make sure he could satisfy his vengeance.<br><br>Sasuke isn't autistic, that's something you're born with, Sasuke is traumatized.

His assistants can emulate his shit well enough, and aren't half as forgetful or autistic.</br></br>  <br>It was the only way to become family via proxy, eh?</br>  <br>It's for the sake of character development, he'll come around.</br>  <br>Ino a cute.<br>CUTE.</br></br>    <br>Why do I get the feeling Bort's the oldest kid in the village?</br>  <br>Likewise<br><br>Then again a Himawari SoL series where she goes full Yotsuba would be great</br></br></br>  <br> How can you say you love her if you can't even eat her poop.png </br>  So why did Kishi think it was a good idea to give Neji the shittiest dead possible and instead of just giving Gai the best dead ever  <br>To be fair, you'd kill Orochimaru, and six months later you'd see him walking around again. Hard to keep that guy dead when his immortality plan is better than Hidan's.</br>  <br>Pretty sure he is, if only by a little. I believe Naruto and Hinata knocked boots first, and the rest of the main character bunch just sort of followed suit.<br><br>"If that autistic retard who didn't notice that hot piece of ass wanting him for like five years can get married and get it on, why can't I?"</br></br></br>   that response <br>Hope we get to see more of his Neji side in the movie.</br>  <br> those new kages <br><br>so kumogakure goes from strong as fuck black guy to poor man's kakashi and kirigakure goes from multiple nature bitch to whatshisname<br><br>the rock bitch at least has multiple natures but can't really compare to the tsuchikage's fucking powers<br><br>only naruto and gaara are actual top tier</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No wonder they brought the 12 year-old.</br>  <br>Darui was A's right-hand man, and the Fifth Mizukage's right-hand man (the current Mizukage pictured) was one of the Seven Mist Swordsmen. Not too bad.</br>  <br>As long as he's not as much of a cunt as pre-Chuunin Exams Neji was. I wouldn't enjoy seeing Boruto send Himawari into cardiac arrest.</br>  <br> the four Kage got their assholes absolutely reamed by zombie Madara <br> these jokers are not only weaker but are expected to take on faggots as strong or stronger than Kaguya  <br><br>They better have brought lube.</br></br></br></br>  How awkward was Naruto and Hinata's first time, both had zero experience.  <br>It's okay. His murderous tendencies will be directed towards that faggot Nara kid and Master Blaster.</br>  <br>Are the Kage accompanying Naruto, Boruto and Sasuke? I was under the impression it was just them three, because Super Ninja Jesus 1 and 2, plus Super Ninja Jesus 1's kid.<br><br><br>There is no way in hell that Hinata didn't ride Naruto to exhaustion for their honeymoon. You know the old adage of the quieter they are, the freakier they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why should the other 4 Kage have to do anything when Naruto and Sasuke are around?</br>  <br>sure they may be their right hands but still just the huge drop of power would make people doubt the village strenght, they are lucky they are all buddies now</br>  <br> Are the Kage accompanying Naruto, Boruto and Sasuke? <br>They're part of the rescue party going after Princess Nurudu.</br></br>  <br>They're jobbers to show off the villains' abilities.</br>  <br>I dunno, Gaara's pretty storong, Nigger got some good movesl like black lightning and if that Mist swordsman gets his shit together he can slam major ass. Tsuchikage's daughter is shit though, she has neither flying nor jinton.</br>  <br>Ah. All I know about the movie is Sasuke trains Boruto.<br><br><br>Yeah, I guess. All the previous Kage's aren't dead though, are they? I mean, they're still Kage as of The Last. Didn't they just abdicate and allow the next generation to take over, like Kakashi did?</br></br></br></br>   this shit will never end   <br>Well, Kishimoto just "retired" from Nurudu so we'll see how that goes.</br>  <br>she still has multiple nature and his father made was hardcore with his dotons all things considered<br><br>the new mizukage is the one I would consider the weakest but then again she's a woman so kishi will probably shaft her<br><br><br>I think there was no reason for the mizukage to step back. Even if they aren't dead is still lame that in an emergency you would have to make fight a guy that is almost 100 years old or someone who only has one arm left</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Third Hokage was old as fuck and still stepped back into the role after the Fourth sacrificed himself.<br><br>And as for 'that guy with one arm', A straight-up has zero fucks to give about anything whatsoever. He'd kick ass with no arms and one leg if he had to.</br></br></br>  <br> Sakura looked up at the sky, alone. <br>ha</br></br>  Man, Teuchi's chapter in Konoha Hiden is emotional as fuck.  <br>Did his hot daughter take on the family shop or is he still the cook?</br>  <br>He stepped down and put Minato because Minato was the best at that time and when he died he didn't call Asuma or Ebisu and told him "yeah I'm too old for this you're hokage now"<br><br>Why retire if you can kick the ass of whoever is replacing you</br></br></br>  Havent been keeping up with this shit<br><br>so theres the og manga then the seventh movie and an 8th movie about burrito and wtf is this?<br><br>Isnt there a burrito mango too? Shit confuses me</br></br></br></br>  <br>I cringed. These two barely have any chemistry left.</br>  <br>He's still the cook, but it's basically him reminiscing on all the shinobi who've come to his place for ramen before heading off on a mission and said "I love your ramen, I'll be sure to have some when I get back from my mission!" and have never come back. And he keeps telling himself that they've just found a better ramen place or they've moved somewhere else and that's why the shinobi have never come back, and he has to make the next day's ramen extra good, just in case they happen to pop through his door again.</br>  <br>Its kurotsuchi and her title is Tsuchikage.<br><br>The previous Kage's are old as fuck. Tsunade was early 50's during the war she's like in her 70's now, same with the other Kages, except Gaara and kakashi probably resigned after a few years of being a Kage.</br></br></br>  <br>Nurudu was serviceable up until the end of the Pain arc. Then shit got dumb and aliens. Then Nurudu fought some Muslim on the moon because he was trying to NTR him. Then he got married, had 2 kids, and became Hokage. Then he fought some onions and a crazy bald man with a hundred eyes with his emo partner, a fat little niggress and a Salad. <br><br>Now the series is supposed to end with a movie about his son Bolt, and his teammates Salad and Stretch Armstrong. They also fight aliens or something. I think it's a Playboy bunny.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for Boruto to go big and have 10 more years of Naruto:Boruto 3<br><br>Of course it won't happen but it'd be neat to watch the Konoha 11 die<br><br>That and all those new cyborg tech wizard ninjas</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bolt main character </br>  <br>I literally only just noticed the symbol of the Kaguya clan on the Big Bad's forehead. That's the same clan that Kimimaro was from, and they're ALSO ancestors of the goddess Kaguya. Hmn.</br>  <br>Meh. Salad got boring as soon as she became Pink Shit 2.0. At least Burrito has potential and room to grow.</br>  Who's the women next to Kiba (his wife) ?<br>Rock Lee too, who the fuck is that, ten ten?</br>  <br>Let me guess: burrito will straighten up and become hokage?<br><br>ZZZZZZ</br></br></br>  <br>But Bolt wears Naruto's old jumpsuit in the end for maximum nostalgia, I guess he's going to take up after this dad in the end.</br>  "The other day day, Iruka had been in the Academy’s staff room as usual, working through some documents. Naruto had come to see him with an incredibly deferential look on his face. He said he had something to ask Iruka, something about the wedding.<br><br>Iruka had already let Naruto know he was definitely going to come to the wedding, so he didn’t have the faintest idea what he wanted to ask.<br><br>Iruka asked him what he wanted to talk about, and Naruto abruptly blurted out:<br><br>"I’d like it if you’d come to the wedding as my dad."<br><br>THE FEELS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kiba got a pussy with pussy and Lee fucked someone and made a Mini Lee named Metal.</br>  <br> THE FEELS </br>  <br>Didn't reddit pop not too long ago?</br>  Isn't that Kurenai? She looks pretty young there though.  <br>Woman next to Kiba is Kurenai, he got together with granddaughter of cat lady Sasuke visited when he was with Taka. And next to Lee is Tenten, he does have a son but we don't know who with, maybe her.</br>  <br>It's a slowly leaking bubble right now, shit has yet to burst though</br>  <br>She looks kinda old in the ending but her daughter's quite fuckable. Wonder if we'll see her in the movie.</br>  Where are those scenes in OP pic from? Are they doing an OVA of this, or is it going to be included in the movie?  <br>the fuck's reddit got to do with anything?<br><br>it's just that this post (). holy shit</br></br></br>  <br>Credits and post-credits scenes from The Last.<br><br><br> don't know who with, maybe her <br>Hopefully. It'd be sad if fucking Lee came out better than her. All 10/10 got right now is an empty shop and dead teammate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame Neji</br>  <br>Reminder that Neji was right all along.</br>  <br> implying Neji would've ended with her  <br>He would probably succumb to someone from his clan.</br></br>  <br><br>Man, in perspective he probably had to see them at their lowest too when they lost someone.</br></br>  <br>That's probably one of the best ED in Naruto. Is kind of nostalgic as well.</br>  <br>Damn I was hoping kiba would have a litter of kids or at least one.</br>  <br>what manga is that</br>  <br>Chrono crusade I think...</br>  <br>I like how they included from the Konoha Hiden that part where kid Naruto is invited to eat ramen by Teuchi the first time. It's so touching.<br><br>Teuchi is the real hero of the village.</br></br></br>  That Kankuro Jr. though  <br>There hasn't been any hints as to exactly where Mizuki is from, has there? Just he's from an unknown Village and he's come to Konoha.</br>  <br>He seems to be Boruto's best friend, so I wonder if Mizuko has led the boy down the path of cake-smashing evil?</br>  Just finished Konoha Hiden. It says that Sasuke isn't at the ceremony, but at the end of The Last, in the credits, Sasuke is clearly there. I wonder which one is more canonical.<br><br><br>I actually wondered if  he has something to do with Orochimaru. He's super pale and does the stretchy limb thing, even though that's not unique to Orochimaru. </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Wedding pictures <br> &gt;Baby Pictures <br> &gt;Pictures of the parents with their children <br><br>So why the hell couldn't Sakura have had a single picture taken of her with Sasuke at some point despite being his "wife"?<br>The entire plot of the gaiden would have been avoided if she had one, and wasn't so retarded as to give obviously flimsy answers to her daughter asking about something that turned out to be entirely innocent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but at the end of The Last, in the credits, Sasuke is clearly there. <br>Pretty sure he wasn't</br></br>  <br> &gt;Shikamaru forgot the condom </br>  <br>welcome to kishi writing/narutu being wrung out for every cent</br>  <br>No he's not, you probably mixed him up with Kankuro he looks somewhat like Sasuke there without his makeup and hood.</br>  <br>I'll take another look, but from what I saw, there was Sai, as well as someone else with black hair and an emo fringe. I thought it was Sasuke, but maybe I'm wrong.<br><br>Dick move from a best friend. Did his travels really never bring him back within walking distance of Konoha for 12 years?</br></br></br>  <br>That Kankuro Jr is pretty metal</br>  Reading through the novel and damn, character interaction is so much better there, even though it's pretty cliche most of the time, but compared to manga itself it's leagues better, you can actually tell that characters have relationships between each other. Though so far only Shikamaru, Teuchi, Iruka and Shino/Kiba ones were worth reading. Sakura/Ino one is utterly pointless and Lee and Tenten chapters feel like a part of SD.  <br>Thanks tl anon</br>  <br>  dat malnourished 1010 </br>  <br> Is the g-spot located in the forehead in the Naruto universe? <br>Why the hell do you think they wearing that pussy deflectors?</br></br>  <br> Sakura/Ino one is utterly pointless <br>Really, shouldn't they be past the pointless bickering and insults by this time in their lives?</br></br>  <br> MALASION AIRLINES</br>  <br>You'd think so. Don't even know why it's such a big deal since it's not over SAAAAAAAAAAAAAASUKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEE</wbr></br>  <br>same artist?<br>shieee</br></br>  <br>hope its 1010's pussy that he smashed</br>  <br>What is fujo? I've seen the term.</br>  <br>Sasuke is too edgy for weddings. I doubt he even showed up to his.<br><br>It took the most adorable character in the Naruto universe to get him to show something resembling a normal human reaction.</br></br></br>  <br> that fucking nose and face </br>  <br> Did his travels really never bring him back within walking distance of Konoha for 12 years? <br>God only knows what he was doing during all that time, besides avoiding Sakura.</br></br>  <br>He is the keikaku behind the keikaku.</br>   Karin is Sarada's real mom!!! <br> all those cuck anons who got btfo by Kishi <br> mfw <br>I told them. I fucking told them.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah i know...</br>  <br>I'm gonna make 10/10 in Play Club now and fuck her silly.</br>  <br> Play Club <br>w-what<br> and fuck her silly. <br>DONT EVER LAY ON HANDS ON MY WAIFU</br></br></br></br>  <br> Teuchi is the real hero of the village. <br>Truth be told, he was there before Iruka even cared about Naruto.</br></br>  <br>  "I'd like to see Naruto" <br>  "But then I wouldn't be able to get out of seeing Sakura." <br>  "Sorry buddy, maybe next year." </br></br></br>  <br>Wait, wasn't Naruto surprised that Sarada had never even met Sasuke? That would suggest that Sasuke met Naruto, while still avoiding Sakura.</br>  <br>  "Hey Naruto!" <br>  "Oh hey, Sasuke! We should go see Sakura together!" <br>  "NO! No, I, uh, I mean I've...I've already seen her. Yeah." </br></br></br>  <br>This, I fucking fapped to this 10 years ago.</br>  <br>/u/ please  stay </br>  <br>I'm gonna add plenty of makeup too, to make as slutty as possible. Then I'm gonna fuck her up good.</br>  <br>SS is literally the worst possible ending for those characters except that it produced Sarada.</br>  <br> Sakura x Ino <br>thats the old news gramps<br>2 moms are the thing now</br></br></br>  Why does Sarada need glasses if both her parents don't have them, not to mention she has super eyes as per her genes? God what a shitty excuse to create some drama.  <br>Your parents don't need bad eyes for you to have bad eyes, although yeah, it's definitely a major factor.<br><br>That being said, I think the 20/20 Sharingan vision is only there when the Sharingan is actually activated. I wouldn't be adverse to Sarada going full Itachi and having the Sharingan on 24/7 though. I think it'd be cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Obito genes and a bait to cucks.</br>  <br>Kishi liked the idea of a cute girl with eye powers wearing glasses.</br>  <br>That filename</br>  <br>Add 'eleven boy' at the end.</br>  Oretto is a good artist.  <br> She is, anon. He even has her eyeshape.</br>  <br>Most of the people who were banging on about Karin being the mum legitimately didn't care - they just enjoyed making SS-fags mad. Hell, even though Sakura IS the mum, it's clear that Sasuke only feels the baaaaaaaarest hint of emotion towards her - it took twelve years just to get one good family photo.</br>  <br> I think the 20/20 Sharingan vision is only there when the Sharingan is actually activated. <br>If that were the case, then she should have had to take her glasses off when her Sharingan activated because everything would have gotten blurry.</br></br>  <br>HELLO WHAT IS THIS FROM I THINK I NEED THIS.<br><br><br>Unless the Sharingan can account for glasses and fix that as well. It's not a long stretch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just a one-off picture, but the artist does really good work and has quite a few lewd pictures.</br>  <br> Probably saw many people say "I will have something to tell you after this mission" to their gf <br> Probably saw many people go in their last missions before retiring <br> nome of them came back </br></br></br>    <br><br>cute</br></br>  <br>The glasses were just a design choice.<br><br>I doubt there was any plan for any Maury drama when 700 came out. Kishi probably got asked by Jump to make a miniseries to promote the movie and to milk the cow a bit more and he saw it as the perfect opportunity to draw his new waifu showing a bunch of different emotions + her ass and tighs. He still hadn't anything resembling a plot so his assistant told him about how a bunch of retards were asking him about how they thought that the girl who is shown referring to Sakura as her mom is the daughter of some side character that didn't even get shown in 700.</br></br></br>  <br>There's also this, which is about boobs. <br>http://imgur.com/a/1rWEt</br></br>  <br><br>I've heard that Nanashi, of gore and torture doujin fame, is working on one or two Naruto doujins, as well as several non-hentai ones that are just Naruto and Hintat doing cutesy shit during their dating period. And I am psyched as fuck for that.<br><br><br> Ichiraku isn't a licensed venue, but Teuchi always keeps a bottle of sake below the counter when a squad of three return from a mission </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh he's working all right.</br>  <br><br>Even though Narutu is shit, I'm fucking loving this.</br></br>  <br>Is there an ETA, or has he only released a sly "It'll be ready when it's done"?<br><br><br>Everyone knows that everyone on /a/ is secretly a bunch of softies with a warm spot in their hearts for in-universe romance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does anyone know this artist?</br>  <br>I approve of the five or six pages in that link. Cute as fuck with a touch of not-really-safe-for-work. Love it.</br>  <br>That's exaclt what he's thinking about in the novel. <br><br> Every night, Teuchi would prepare the ingredients for the next day of work at Ichiraku’s. At as he did, all the faces of his missing shinobi customers would come to mind. <br><br> You were careful, right…? <br><br> You just got fed up my ramen, right? <br><br> You just found another, better store, right? <br><br> Right? <br><br> That’s the case, Teuchi tried to tell himself, trying to cheer himself up. That’s definitely the case. Who knows, I may even see them tomorrow. In that case, I’d better make sure tomorrow’s ramen is better than ever! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Comiket 88, anon-kun<br><br>l-lewd</br></br></br>  <br>It'll go the exact same way dbz did with toriyama</br>  <br> Teuchi thought Naruto was dead <br> Teuchi made ramen while the apocalypse was happening <br> Teuchi gave Naruto free naruto for life <br>These are feelings I did not expect.</br></br></br></br>  Hanamoto's art is also good and cute.  <br><br>Playclub? Is that something like Artificial Academy?</br></br>    <br>why theres so much NH artists that draws cute NH things but no hentai doujins?</br>    <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=49404531<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50313316<br><br>Enjoy.</br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Comiket 88? Can you elaborate?<br><br><br>As I said, Nanashi's working on something, and there are several half-decent doujins. Got to Fakku and type in 'Naruto'. There's like 12 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Comiket is a doujin convention, I usually look forward to them because of Touhou music arrangements, but they also sell doujins and stuff<br>nanashi is selling it at C88</br></br>  <br>Didn't even know there WAS a doujin convention, although I shouldn't be surprised. What's the date for that? And how long after that do you reckon it'll be released online?</br>  <br>14th till 16th August<br>it should take 1 week till 1 month to scan it, although the last nanashi doujin took 3 months to get uploaded on sadpanda</br></br>  <br>Should I make a exhentai account? That's what you need to view sadpanda, isn't it?</br>  <br> all those NH doujins that left untranslated </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127676943 <br>I've only found one of Nanashi's on e-hentai. I've found that site oddly hard to navigate and find what I want.</br>  <br>tl anon you should translate this<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=49990366<br>seems pretty keky</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>not TL anon here, but I think someone already translated this, I only too lazy to find the post</br>  <br>I can't see it. Do I need an account?</br>  <br>I did. <br><br>http://imgur.com/a/glCQr</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I feel sorry for Kurama at moments like this.<br><br>  "Kurama" <br>  "Hey, Kurama?" <br>  "Come on buddy, what's up?" <br>  "...You humans are disgusting, don't talk to me." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tenten chose wizardry bruh</br>  <br>Kek at Kiba boasting about the aphrodisiac wine.Also kek at Kurenai teaching him more.</br>  ITT: We wait for the next Gaiden chapter  <br>Oh god, that Shikamaru chapter.<br>Though one thing I don't really get about it, it mentions he alredy asked Temari on a date before, maybe it's just a poor choice of words by translator.</br></br>  <br>You know, that photo looks like Shikamaru is best man. Iruka came as Naruto's dad, I'd reckon Kakashi would be best man.</br>  <br>so Kiba and Tamaki, the catlady meet again? didn't expect her to show up in Konoha Hiden</br>  <br>Kakashi's closer to Naruto. I think it goes <br> Bride/Groom <br> Family <br> Best Man/Maid of Honor <br>In terms of distance. So Iruka's probably his "dad" and Kakashi's the best man while Hanabi is the maid of honor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For some fucking reason I thought Iruka was fucking Shikamaru. I just went full retard. Yeah, in the Hiden Naruto dropped into the Academy staff room and asked Iruka if he'd attend Naruto's wedding as his dad.</br>  <br>Look at Bee on the end there<br> The fuck I gotta stand near this bug nigga for <br> How Naruto manage to score a bae with such fine titties? <br> Ain't she that bitch that we tried to kidnap a while ago? </br></br></br></br>  Reading these novels I realize this is exactly what I want from Naruto, character interaction in a crazy setting, that moment Sai's present to Naruto and Hinata accidentally flew away was the most hilarious thing after Kakashi's mask filler. Too bad as a shonen it's bound to be DBZ rip-off to the end.  <br>no gaiden<br>but there will be Part 3 for sure after SP done with shippuden<br>probably we gonna have like arcs like enemy cyborg ninjas and hostile people without chakra powers from faraway land inventing artifical chakra  aka nanochakramachines son!  to keep this ninja shit going<br><br>also 3 days ago it was neji's birthday</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm late, but.. Metal Lee???<br>holyshit, who's the mother??</br></br>  <br>Wait, what does it say about Lee and Lee 2.0?</br>  <br>Eh, Bee scored with Samui, that's nearly as good as Hinata.</br>  <br>Choices are Tenten or new character. Did Lee name his child Metal because he thought that's stronger than rock?</br>  <br>That he's Lee's son named Metal Lee. That is all.</br>  <br>  Next son will be called 'Total' </br>  <br> holyshit, who's the mother?? <br>anon's split up between some random nameless chick or 1010<br>or he might adopted the war orphan, or hell he might ended up reproducing asexually</br></br></br>  <br>i though it's metal as in music? Like Rock</br>  <br>Happy birthday Neji, you magnificent, nearly-fratricidal bastard</br>  <br> Metal music came from rock and roll <br> Rock came from blues <br> Lee's dad was Blues Lee <br> Blues = burusu = Bruce <br> Bruce Lee <br>DEEPEST LORE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolute pottery</br>  <br>damn!!! it's like pottery</br>    <br> not Platinum <br> not Dragonforce <br><br>maybe or he might he settling with 1010 and decide to name "metal" since she probably likes weapons that are made out of metal</br></br></br></br>  <br> Total because then his name would be Total Lee. I know it would work better if Lee was his middle name, I really didn't think this through. </br>  <br> Next daughter is Lenalee <br>Oh wait</br></br>  I'm just gonna note that if you look closely, most of the couples are next to each other<br> Ino and Sai holding hands <br> Temari and Shikamaru next to each other <br><br>I'ma just note that 1010 and Lee are next to each other. Although that could just be from them being on the same team.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  implying Lee would snap the neck of any daughters as soon as they were born <br><br>He's seen what women who's power is 'physical strength' grow up to be: useless supporting characters of hyperactive blond kids and emo massacre survivalists.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Rock Lee's dad actually got killed by ninja triad <br> yfw thats why we don't see his family </br></br>  <br>Soon anon.<br>Soon</br></br>  <br>He asks her on a date at the end of shikamaru hiden, which takes place before this, that's what it's refering to. Sounds like he didn't follow up on it very well</br>  <br>What about the two hokages?</br>  <br>Only one Hokage has been female.</br>    <br>Deciding to become Hokage don't mean shit. Sasuke and Kiba both 'decided' to become Hokage. On the flip side, Kakashi and Tsunade never planned on becoming Hokage, yet they still did.</br>  A post from this thread got posted to reddit.  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>which post and why do we should care?</br>  <br>This one </br>  <br><br>i cant see<br>also nice dubs</br></br></br>  <br><br>cute, thanks</br></br>  <br>They walk among us</br>  <br>Kiba is a minor comic relief character and Sasuke didn't give a shit about the position until 600 chapters in and what he wanted was to pretend to be some sort of evil emperor.<br><br>Burrito is the only character mor relevant than Salad and he wants nothing to do with the job.</br></br></br>  <br>no, sorry</br>  <br>chose to have a kid with the guy who was trained by a man who would've killed madara with "TAI JUTsU " if he was mortal at the time. <br>Bitch couldn't get first or second but she made sure to get third.</br></br>  <br> Burrito is the only character mor relevant than Salad and he wants nothing to do with the job. <br>Not until the movie ends.</br></br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br>Oh please, it most definitely will end up with him wanting to be hokage and competing with Salad for it.

What's he doing hanging out with Type-Moon scum? <br>You know Narita is the author of Fate/strange fake, right?</br></br>  <br>Oh, and most importantly: Who DM'd?</br>  Please keep me updated!  <br>You have to be fucking shitting me.<br><br>Why would he soil his perfect Baccano, DRRR and Vamp track with Type-Moon shit?<br><br>Please tell me you're rusing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Narita is as big of a hack as the rest of them.</br>  <br>He also co-wrote an Index crossover.</br>  <br>because he and nasu a very good friends also he is also a big TMfag you piece of shit</br>  <br>He is the biggest hack because he fell the hardest.</br>  <br>No way.<br><br>Nasu can't write for shit (really, Kawahara Reki-tier, and not even Accel World-level) and Urobuchi can't write two pages without plagiarizing something.<br><br>Narita's shit is actually well written and interesting. And I say this as the dude who's always uploading real novels to the goddess.<br><br><br>I'm fine with that.<br><br><br>That's really lamentable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He also wrote a non-crossover Index short story.</br>  <br>And let's not forget the Shizuo x Izaya yaoi story, which was still miles better than anything that's ever come out of the pens of Nasu and Urobuchi combined.</br>  I love watching the cognitive dissonance in a person when they are confronted with the fact that the shit they like and the shit they hate are all the same shit.  <br><br>If it makes you feel slightly better he probably plays the best character out of the cast. The sad thing is we likely won't see him until mid season.<br><br>The writing so far is nothing special and while I love gen, nasu, and narita equally the anime's writing team has none of their influence so far with maybe the exception of a little bit of urobutcher if you are one of those people that goes killing someone=urobutcher. <br><br>If it makes you feel even better beyond that Nasu/Gen are not really the main focuses and only got a few lines of dialogue this ep.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Narita loves TM and is a close friend of Nasu. He is even writing a Fate spin-off right now that feels like Fate mixed with Baccano and is fucking great.</br>  <br><br>Nasu, Gen and Narita are TRPG veterans so they actually knew what they were doing, so their characters were actually pretty interesting.<br><br>Ibuki and Eiha were just boring, even if they got better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, man...<br><br>Who's Narita's character? The steampunkish ball thing?<br><br><br>No, no.<br><br>See, there's one I hate unconditionally because he sucks: Nasu. One I wouldn't hate if he didn't plagiarize so much, or at least if he wasn't so blatant about it: Urobuchi (and well, I did enjoy Gargantia and S1 of Psycho Pass). And one I haven't had a reason to hate, and have actually loved since the Baccano anime DVD came out: Narita.<br><br>I just don't get why Narita would be retarded enough to write anything set in Nasu's absolutely shit universe. But I guess if they're friends IRL, that can blind you.<br><br>... but yeah, the idea of the show sounds great. I'd love to have some of my D&amp;D sessions animated, not to mention so many of /tg/'s screenshots. But I've played with some assholes that have really ruined some sessions, and I can see Nasu... and really, Urobuchi too, being that kind of asshole.<br><br><br>I just can't understand it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nasu can't write for shit (really, Kawahara Reki-tier, and not even Accel World-level) and Urobuchi can't write two pages without plagiarizing something. <br>EOP much faggot, juding someone writing based on a very shit english translation, you are obviously a naritafag also even narita stated that nasu is a better writer</br></br>  <br>Nasu is average, he really doesn't suck that much but he is not good either. He is the prefect example that a good/decent worldbuilder is not necessarily a good writer.<br><br>Also, Nasu actually did a pretty decent character that saved Urobuchi's from being just an edgier throw-away and gave it a thematic purpose in the whole story.<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/Lgo3w</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nasu literally saved the story from derailing and gave it an internal logic. Urobuchi went full asshole but ultimately fit within the whole scope and make it more interesting. Narita was just the interesting character in the background who liked to pull strings and never get to involved.<br><br>Both three did their job pretty well, really. Stop your blind hatred because you are just being a fanboy now.</br></br></br>  <br>I played FSN. Nuff said.</br>  <br>FSN is amateur Nasu and got a really bad translation. He also got far better with the years, nuff said. <br><br>I wouldn't call him a good writer, but he is not really bad either right now and has some interesting ideas that are unique on their own.</br></br></br>  <br>Mirror Moon translation is really subpar. Also, as  said, FSN is really amateurish and he got far better nowadays.</br>  <br><br>I just know that, around '06 or '07, /a/ couldn't recommend FSN more. So I tried watching the anime and it was shit, and when I came to tell you faggots how shit it was after 3 or 4 episodes, there were two camps: those who told me to play the "amazingly good" VN instead, and those who were raging because they were butthurt typemoonfags.<br><br>And then I was retarded enough to go and play the VN.<br><br>And yeah, KnK is much, much better, but that doesn't mean it's good. It's just not ass abysmal as FSN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shounen fag author being into shounen fag's holy grail <br>WHAT A SURPRISE!<br> **5,139位/**4,583位 (***,*63 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/09/16 【Amazon.co.jp限定】ケイオスドラゴン 赤竜戦役 第一夜 Blu-ray <br>I hope it will flop just as hard as it looks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kara no Kyoukai is even more amateurish than FSN though, it is just that is not constricted by VN tropes so it feels more fresh.<br><br>And Narita is not that good either really. I love him because he is really fun to read, but he is not consistent at all and usually fails at giving his stories any semblance of coherence.<br><br>Outside of blind fanboyism I would rank the three more or less the same, each of them with their own strenghts and weaknesses.</br></br></br></br></br>  Ugliest show of the season, and I watched Aoharu x Kitanjuu.  <br>Worst is Classroom Crisis. Gangsta comes second, but not nearly as bad.</br>  <br> I just don't get why Narita would be retarded enough to write anything set in Nasu's absolutely shit universe <br>because if you have a good plot and characters and writing skill, you can write something set in fucking MLP universe and it will still be good?</br></br>  <br>I'll give you 1/10 since I responded</br>  <br> Kara no Kyoukai is even more amateurish than FSN though <br>Yeah. but Ufotable cleaned it up and turned it into something incredible.</br></br>  <br> One I wouldn't hate if he didn't plagiarize so much, or at least if he wasn't so blatant about it: Urobuchi <br>What did he plagiarize, again?<br>Do you hate Buronson and T. Hara for "plagiarizing" Mad Max?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but the LN is also interesting on its own.<br><br>Nasu is actually quite ashamed for all his old stuff and wanted ufotable to do exactly that and even gave them some instructions to make it better.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but he is correct...</br>  <br> http://imgur.com/a/Lgo3w <br>And the other 3?</br></br>  <br>Only Nasu did that sadly.</br>   [TAC]Chaos Dragon - Sekiryuu Seneki[01][720p] <br><br>is this shitaub any good?</br></br>  <br>Overall correct but poor grammar, shit romanizations and some untranslated terms.</br>  So is it really that bad?

There are no Puella Magi in that book at ALL.</br>  <br> implying TypeMoon hasn't always had at least as many haters as it's got fans <br>Your summer is showing.</br></br>  <br>It really isn't though. I've been in countless TM threads where there has been no real TM hate. The shitposters just like to parrot each other.</br>  <br>translate it weeb</br>  <br>But that's everything /a/ discusses.

Does it have to be super obvious? <br>Besides F/SN was influenced by Ryuki too and Madoka's witches are humans is a KR trope, and more of a Showa rider trope. <br><br><br>I know.

How can I enjoy his work when he isn't as much of a loser as me?</br>  <br> he says while quoting someone who has clearly stated ITT how he plays D&amp;D <br>Projecting much?<br><br>And no, I won't stop enjoying Narita's shit just because his friends are shit writers. It's just a shame, that's all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the same with studios. Some people think that the people who made the shows they like must also hate the shows they don't like.</br>  <br>And I won't let you to soil Narita with your blind fanboyism.</br>  <br>It's just a ridiculous thing to lament because it shows exactly how melodramatic and pathetic you sound. There's nothing to lament over the company Narita likes to keep and what he enjoys doing, that's silly.<br><br>Besides, your personal rankings of these authors is founded off what exactly? Your personal taste has created an arbitrary sense of self-importance and you can't quite cope with the fact that an author you enjoy likes something that lies beyond your own interests.</br></br></br>  <br> your personal rankings of these authors is founded off what exactly? <br>I'm willing to bet it's the cartoons that he watched made out of their works.</br></br>  <br><br>see </br></br>  <br>Well it's safe to assume that Narita did as well. How does that make you feel?</br>  <br>Like we both wasted our time.</br>  <br>Why do you keep projecting yourself onto Narita?</br>  <br>He is just idiotic.</br>  <br>He enjoyed it though and is a happy, successful writer who gets to play in games with pure shounen hearted Nasu. I think it turned out pretty well for him.</br>  <br>I'm not. I'm replying to your post concerning both Narita and I.<br><br>I'm just a fan of his, and at the same time, hate some writers who apparently are his friends.<br><br>... at least Mari Okada isn't in the mix.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How lamentable.</br>  <br> and I can see Nasu... and really, Urobuchi too, being that kind of asshole <br><br>It's one thing to not like an author's works and think they're a subpar writer, that's your opinion and you're entitled to it, but when you start saying that they're probably an asshole IRL, based off nothing but the fact that you dislike their works of fiction, that's when it goes into blind hate territory.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm coming off from D&amp;D experience.<br><br>The shittiest campaign writers are the shittiest players that always ruin everybody else's campaigns.</br></br></br>  <br>D&amp;D is one of the shittier tabletops out there at the moment. It has some of the worst fans/players and engenders a lot of wrongmindedness in new players that ruins them for other tabletops.<br><br>Case in point: You</br></br></br>  <br>Except I've been playing it since '95. And even though my group adopted v4, we reverted back to 3.5 because fuck that shit.</br>  <br>Writing in a D&amp;D session is way different from writing on your own, though. You don't know what Nasu and Urobuchi are like as campaign writers and didn't even give them a chance before deciding that they were assholes who were probably ruining the fun for everyone else.</br>  <br><br>And it was already said to you that in this very case, those people you hate so much actually were pretty good players and did more for the sake of the campaign than everyone else, at least in Nasu's case.<br><br>So stop being a blind hater because you are only making yourself look bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You know what's weird? Everyone's so young in this anime. Like, it's a fantasy adventure, but they all look 12! It's impossible to take it seriously when the proportions are so bizarre. I mean, even for anime, that's *young*. <br><br>If the designs weren't all literally little children, there'd be a lot more pathos involved. But they're ALL kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Urobuchi's an adult dude. She has really really big boobs too.</br>  <br>They aren't. Ibuki and company are 15 years old, Swallow and Meryll are 25 and 26 years old. Lou is also 26 years old.<br><br>And then Kaguraba is like age unknown and is alive from centuries.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I say this with the caveat that I've only watched the anime, and I've never read the novels. From first impressions, the white shota and his friends appeared to be the main characters, and they're literally kids. It felt really weird to see this pint-sized boy fighting a fat bastard that was about four times his size.<br><br>And are they seriously fighting the not-Chinese?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the main party, only Ibuki and Eiha are like that. Everyone else is more than 25 years old or even hundred of years old.</br>  <br>Ibuki and friends are teens, but I agree they seem younger. Also Ibuki was able to fight that fat guy because of the contract with the Red Dragon giving him strength.<br><br> And are they seriously fighting the not-Chinese? <br>Not really, in the original Kouran wasn't even this evil, that was added in the anime. The main plot is forming a multi-country party to fight the insane Red Dragon and trying to fix what is wrong in the island.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It felt really weird to see this pint-sized boy fighting a fat bastard that was about four times his size. <br>So this is your first time ever watching anime?</br></br>  <br>Even more here that is given a semblance of an explanation if you just turn your attention span on.</br>  <br> Urobuchi, Nasu and two faggots I don't know <br>urgh disgusting.<br><br>Art is also disgusting looks like Type Moon Garbage</br></br></br></br>  <br>The white haired shota is the only important one in that group.</br>  <br>I understand you don't like Fate Stay Night, but what's your issue with the Fate Stay Night universe exactly?<br><br>World building is Nasu's biggest strength.</br></br></br>  <br> Urobuchi can't write two pages without plagiarizing something <br>Have to agree with this. Madoka is basically Fate with cute girls and suffering.</br></br>  <br> Madoka is basically Fate with cute girls and suffering. </br>  <br> posting Dragon Ball, SAO, Naruto, Danmachi, Mahouka, Love Live and KanColle all day is fine <br> TM isn't <br>Neo/a/ is frightening.</br></br></br>  <br>They're not alike in the slightest? Also, Fate Stay Night has plenty of suffering already.<br><br>People say that Madoka ripped off some Kamen Rider show.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off /v/</br>  <br>I remember when nobody posted Naruto, for fucking years, and everything was fine. And threads of that got shitposted to death.<br><br>Then it ended and every reddit faggot like this one  began posting naruto shit all over the place.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, fuck off /v/</br>  TMshit is pretty rooted in /a/, anyone telling you otherwise is a fucking retard and probably new. Regardless of how much I hate Fate it's hard to deny it.  who is even subbing this show?  <br>DDY, Funi, and this group</br>  <br>Funi.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I guess funi's delaying it a week or more like usual and DDY is just working at their usual pace?</br></br>  <br>Maid is best girl, right?</br>  <br>Like hell it is, back when DEENshit was all there was there was more discussion of TM on /jp/ where even the EOPs quickly realized from their limited pool of VNs that Nasu isn't a good writer.<br><br>It only really blew up on /a/ again in 2012 with FZ and briefly before during the UBW movie.</br></br></br>  <br>There have been constant TM threads here since 2006.</br>  <br>That's a joke people took seriously. Ryuki has more in common with FSN, and neither invented battle royales.</br>  <br>What? /jp/ didn't exist when DEEN aired. And even during the VN translation we had many many threads here.</br>  <br> it started with Zero </br>  <br>Stop abusing the quote feature.<br><br>TM and Fateshit did not have nearly as big of a board presence in the years following DEEN S/N except for the occasional KnK film. If you don't think Zero caused a massive influx of people into those threads you're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br> back when DEENshit was all there was <br>Refers to the period between the end of the DEEN adaptation and the next TVA.</br></br>  <br> Liking 3.5 over 4 <br> Not having shit taste </br></br>  <br>Zero caused an influx outside of /a/. Here, it wasn't such a big impact besides secondaries ruining threads.<br><br>This place, as shitty as it is, is one of the last bastions of TM primaries in the internet along with Beast's Lair.</br></br></br>  <br> TM primaries <br>It's fucking hilarious how TMfags wear that like a badge of honor. Reading through a moderately long VN that has been translated for the better part of a decade must be some accomplishment. I guess even EOPs need someone to look down on.</br></br>  <br> one of the last bastions <br>I'd say the only one left. Every other shit began with Zero.</br></br>   reading LN's <br>How about reading some real Japanese literature?</br>  <br> It's fucking hilarious how TMfags wear that like a badge of honor. <br>Nobody here is strictly a primary because everybody started with DEEN, and then moved to the VN, but it's not fucking Zero. And yeah, it is.</br></br>  Holy fuck what a boring first episode<br>Will it get better?</br>   this thread <br><br> EOPs <br>What else is there to comment?</br></br></br>  <br>Reading is for nerds.</br>  I came here cuz I wanted some info on Chaos Dragon and now I don't know what the hell EOP is.  <br>2 and 3 were definitely better.</br>  <br> based on tabletop session <br> surprised it's boring </br></br>  <br>I expected the maid to bully Swallow and Urobutcher to be a cute and edgy girl.</br>  <br>Happens in the next few episodes</br>  The character designs were beyond disgusting(well, I guess TMfags are already used to this though), very awkward animation(like when that bad guy shoved one of the kids on the ground), really bad wall of text exposition in the middle of the episode, tried too hard to show too many focus characters in one episode and it's hard to get into it. Not going to mention there's "shocking scene" when MC has to kill some girl we probably are supposed to care about after this one episode. I'm really not surprised that this is the director's debut work, it's like it has every single amateur mistake it could have. Worst first episode this season so far.  <br>Oh, that's nice.</br>  <br>EOP is English Only Peasant. It's used by a bunch of people who can read Japanese but decide to broadcast it in English boards instead of going to Japanese ones.</br>  <br>The character designer hasn't even done any TM work before, but yes this episode was quite mediocre.</br>  <br>Salty.</br>  <br>I don't think you were even supposed to care about that girl really. It wasn't even played that way either. It was just a bloody powerup.</br>  <br>Most Japanese anime discussion is boring as fuck.<br>Which you'd know if you weren't an EOP.</br></br>  <br>Found the EOP.</br>  <br>It's beyond me why Japan hasn't made a SoL out of Kappa by now.</br>  <br>But I can read read Japanese.<br>Are you people going to pretend like <br>Is a stellar poster? I'm not saying that people who know Japanese are all shits, I'm saying that EOP is almost always used in a contexts where it just looks like a guy showing off.</br></br></br>  <br><br> girl we probably are supposed to care about after this one episode <br><br>Don't be so dishonest in your criticisms. Or are you really braindead and don't realize the obvious thing? <br><br>You're supposed to care about the guy, who's forced to kill a girl he cares about. And to be interested in seeing how he deals with the guild later or something.<br><br>Fuck, I bet you're the worst kind of fucking cancer on this board - the kind that wants to criticize everything for some retarded "cred" or to "bait" others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Holy shit this was terrible. I can't handle all the edgyness, retardation and bad production quality of this episode.  <br> people boasting about being able to read Japanese <br> they never put their skills to good use and never translate anything <br><br>which also means that their Japanese skills are terrible in the first place.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm saying that EOP is almost always used in a contexts where it just looks like a guy showing off. <br><br>Yeah. And also to point out how clueless EOPs are usually. That's the two main purposes the acronym has.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what entitles you to other people's free time and effort?</br>  <br>It's still awful way to start off series and rarely works. Don't worry, you can still enjoy your favorite eyecancer even if someone criticizes it.</br>  <br>If you're not going to shoot your gun then why are you using it to intimidate others?</br>  <br>Because shooting them is a crime.</br>  I found it okay. Probably going to keep watching because I want to see Lou and the whole show looks fun and stupid.  <br>Yeah, now you can only try dodging.</br>   EOP meme on /a/ <br>Dear fuck, is nothing sacred anymore?</br>  <br>It's pretty much average show with average budget.</br>  <br>I'd argue that's it's a below average show with below average budget. But then nothing has really happened yet.</br>  <br>Not as bad as other shit that aired like Rokka and Shimoneta</br>  <br>Nice one.</br>  <br> hates on Nasu and Gen <br> goes so far at to think they'll be assholes in real life because of how he thinks their shit at writing, showing his retarded bias <br> provides literally 0 explanation as to why those authors suck, resorts to buzzwords and "mug plagiarism" </br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's average as hell.<br><br>Could easily get worse or better from here depending on how the other episodes go.</br></br></br>  <br> provides literally 0 explanation as to why those authors suck <br>Freshly boiled pussy</br></br>  <br>What dodging? Why are you so mad if someone doesn't like this shit? Instead you're welcomed to make arguments why you think I should think it's good.<br><br>Here's an example, this entire scene was so bad. Why are they running towards a guy with sword when they're unarmed? Not to mention the really bad animation, that's not what happens when you shove a kid on ground.<br><br><br>Rokka also had quite bad case of exposition, but at least it looks decent so I'd say this is worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From the thumbnail that looks like some KanColle stuff.</br>  <br>Not him, but it's because he's an idiotic child running on emotion rather than rational thought. That's pretty obvious.<br>The movement is horrible though, what human being bounces like that in a show this serious.</br></br>  <br>That's average animation, not really bad.</br>  <br>What? It's clearly bad.</br>  <br>Nice well-thought out, informative image reply, but the most explanation he gave was <br>Which really says nothing other than "I think these two suck", I mean if you're going to accuse someone of plagiarism (a hefty claim) at least say what he plagiarized.<br><br>The fact is that he's in panic mode because his perfect Narita is actually a TMfag/Urobutcher fan. Like how  said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's really bad.</br>  <br><br>No, there are things out there far worse, even in this very season.<br><br>Just look at Arslan or Soul of Gold for example. Or anything by Toei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon I have no idea what the fuck you're trying to convey.</br>  <br>That OP is autistic</br>  <br>I'm curious what kind of animation you could as example for "bad" in similar situation then, the kid bounces unnaturally like a ball.</br>  <br>Toei is Toei you know it's gonna be shit so there's no expectation.</br>  <br>How can Toei being so shit? I really don't understand.</br>  <br>That's an example of pretty good actually, it's not even fair. Still, this is anime and you see unrealistic stuff all the time.</br>  <br><br> and I can see Nasu... and really, Urobuchi too, being that kind of asshole. <br><br>Narita was in the game because Nasu literally begged for him, kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is anime as in animation and that's why I'm expecting even somewhat dynamic animation. That's clearly not a case of "well this isn't supposed to be realistic anyway", it's just bad.<br><br>Also nice going with the "everything by Toei is shit by default" when both DB Super and Go Princess had better looking first episodes than this.</br></br></br>  <br>Unrealism has nothing to do with animation. Look at the actual character move from frame to frame.</br>  Japan hates it. Is it bad?  <br>It's not diferent from what is usually seen in any subpar LN adaptation.</br>  Remember to keep your Ruris covered.  <br>Yugo, please. We all know you're not lasting past this arc, you should really just start coming to terms with it.</br>  <br><br>Too bad. The german version was chuuni as fuck. I loved it. Kinda a predecessor of the current ones.</br></br>  <br> mfw if Yugo does survive the arc, it'll be all in his mind and he'll go through the stages of grief <br> denial - lasting the arc seemingly intact and seeing nothing wrong <br> anger - dropping motherfuckers left and right, regardless of their alignment <br> bargaining - striking deals with anybody who can keep him afloat long enough to find muh Rin <br> depression - realising he may never find muh Rin, and taking on Yuto's sad eyes and getting the shakes like he did <br> acceptance - falling in battle to Yuri (or similar) and getting nommed by the tomato </br></br></br></br></br></br>  New episodes when  <br> He is a prisoner of Academia. Considered a heretic by everyone else because he doesn't use fusion, uses filthy rituals and he made decks built entirely on sealing away fusion summons. The last straw was him saying "Fusion summoning causes you to lose card advantage most of the time, it's not worth the investment. I think Xyz could be better". As punishment his name has been stricken from all records and by law nobody can ever acknowledge his existence. None of his "friends" even miss him, and forgot about him even before he had been stricken from public record. <br> He sits all day in his cell, longing for the death that will not come as Academia's scientists use him as a guniea pig and torture toy. </br></br>  Today.  <br>Why should a booze hound like me care?</br>    Time for some    <br>i'd prprprpr</br>  <br>Ano nagai yatsu!?</br>  <br>That's quite a little tummy on Komari-sempai</br>  But I'm only on episode 4 of the first season!  <br>Sou!</br>  <br>Then you'll be glad to find more at the end.</br>  There ain't a Non Non Biyori I wouldn't fuck.

Renge is a bit of a dead fish. <br><br>Koma: Koma's pussy delicate but strong and durable and will grip you tightly with powerful orgasmic contractions, her vagina can take the average dick with only light/soft bumping of the cervix, Koma tries to be adult and dominant when she can be but she lacks experience. Koma is prone to peeing/squirting when having an orgasm. Koma's sexual moans are akin to moans of pain, even when she is enjoying herself.<br><br>Natsumi: Natsumi is the strongest of the group, sporting a vagina that can take a royal beating. Go as hard as you like with Natsumi and she'll love every minute. Natsumi's pussy is not too tight and not too loose, she gets extremely wet when aroused. Natsumi loves taking control and prefers to be on top. Natsumi is prone to intense Ahegao. <br><br>Hotaru: Hotaru has the most mature pussy of the Non Nons, this is not a bad thing though if you enjoy the softer feeling. Hotaru is very embarrassed of sex, but warms up to it albeit slowly. Once accustomed to the D, Hotarun loves being pounded. Once she has gotten used to you she is quite the lover, insisting on sex as often as possible (but in her own, shy way). Hotarun loves creampies and has fantasies of becoming pregnant. Hotarun would be easily persuaded to have a threesome with you and Koma.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime online </br>  <br>Thanks nii-chan!</br>  <br> and will grip you tightly with powerful orgasmic contractions <br>this is how you spot a virgin.</br></br>  <br> not being a virgin <br/></br>  <br>Y-You're not?</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Sounds exactly like my chinese cartoon porn comics.

Those four panels aren't a great example because it's extra stylized.<br><br>The adaptation is good looking though.</br></br></br>  <br>did they fix hotarun`s tits? they seem more like in the manga now.</br>  <br>I disagree. The manga is cute, although somewhat odd with most iyashikei manga. The anime, however, is not particularly good, so I can't see how anyone would think the anime's quality is better than the manga's.</br>  <br>Natsumi is still the cutest.</br>  <br>The anime looks more than decent. I'd say above average quality with a few amazing bits.</br>  <br> The adaptation is good looking though. <br><br>Not really, it looks pretty damn bad except for the backgrounds.</br></br></br>  So who's subbing this and when?   marathon the first season <br> episodes with the toys <br> it touches my heart since i live in a third world country which was 20 years behind during the 90´s </br></br>  <br>Me and now.</br>  <br>Cheers.</br>  <br>You don't even need to cry to any mod, the post in itself is so shit, they will notice eventually.<br><br><br> talking about dicks on a NNB thread <br>Just get the fuck out</br></br></br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4843189  <br>For the budget I assume it has it's alright, and the character designs weren't completely butchered.<br><br>Not like SOL has to be THAT well animated.<br><br>Although it would be better if it was Dogakobo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, this butthurt Hotarun-fag</br>  <br>I can't talk about the budget but the characters and shading don't blend well with the highly detailed backgrounds most of the time.</br>  <br> Hotarun-fag <br>They exist?</br></br>  <br>Hotarunfags are alright. <br><br>That guy is just a fag aka NHF.</br></br></br>  <br>What's a NHF?</br>  <br>Report a missing child.

I don't care about anime anymore and rarely browse /a/. Shitty medium and even worse fans. I'm not planning to watch S2.

Now I can actually enjoy the show without feeling the need to shit on the artstyle (which will be much better than most this season, just like S1) so that other mangafags might someday notice me.  <br>Natsuki.<br><br>I want to live that tomboy life</br></br></br>  <br> not wanting to be a little girl </br>  Why are NNB threads filled with so much degeneracy, why can't we just have and enjoy nice comfy things  <br>Congratulations, you were able to successfully consume the images in front of you. However, the deeper meaning, which really wasn't all that deep, apparently eluded you.</br>  <br>its the swimsuit it self.

Enjoying lewd things of them too is just a plus, NNB was always primarily appealing for the comfy.</br></br>  <br>Have you ever watched anime before? Or, hell, accidentally walked in on someone in the bathroom? The issue wasn't that she's flat-chested.</br>  <br><br><br>I recognize that pedo!</br></br></br>  <br>Natsu, so i could marry Onii-chan</br>  <br>Pedos. <br><br>And it's boring SoL shit.

Fucking Wata should release more volumes.</br>  Stay hydrated, brothers  <br>And nobody translates those volumes</br>  <br>Iroha don't abuse verbally.</br>  <br><br> komachi meets iroha <br> calls 8man gomiichan <br> iroha has similar reaction to yukino when she heard komachi shittalk him and starts using gomiichan <br><br>sasuga watari</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Gomii-chan-senpai~" <br> "Don't call me that please" </br></br>  <br><br>Nah, just 'Senpai' is already his nickname for Iroha</br></br>  <br>You can expect me to translate it if it's anything Iroha related (expecting poor quality though)</br>  Spyro is going to join YP.  <br>i never understood why they never bother hiring people that did fan translation for dirt cheap and do quick edit job and release. they do a piss poor job and take forever translating on their own.</br>  <br>Fan translators want to leave in horrifics, Yen Press doesn't want to. Conflict~</br>  <br> horrifics <br>isn't it honorifics, or is this a meme I missed?</br></br>  <br>Why not? The people who read weeaboo shit don't want it localized to sound like some American shit.</br>  <br>It's a meme you missed. Much like "You're waifu is shit".</br>  <br>but they did, often so (at least in manga section). But the translator can't help but have to obey the publisher policy.</br>  <br> horrifics </br>  <br>Now this is a meme I like</br>  <br><br>It's horrific that they don't use honorifics.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Professional translators tend to do language localisation. You just need to read a book in your language and then the same parragraf in the original language and you will see how different they are</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like with pottery it rhymes.</br>  <br>I like honourifics because its not something that is easily translated and is an instant indicator of relationships between two people. We dont have defined social standings to the extend of senpai/kohai. Calling someone -sama, -san, -kun, -chan, etc all show extremely different relationships. <br> <br>Like in this series, youd see Iroha only calls 8man senpai whereas if you leave all honourifics out, shed have a nickname for him as senpai (or bob or however retarded they bother to translate it). Just one small instance off top of my head.</br></br></br>  <br>They are trying to make it accessible for others who aren't into Japanese media. I imagine loads would take of to YenPress social media going "wtf is this "kun" and shit.<br>Though this would be easily solvable by including a glossary in their releases.</br></br>  yahari is dead what hte fukc  <br>This is the problem, they'll change all of that to Mr/Mister/Miss/Mrs or just to the person in question name. <br>As you said you'll never accurately know the relationship between 2 characters or the subtle change when they use a more friendly honorific or drop it all together.</br></br>  Yahari threads definitely won't die for a while. Even if we somehow managed to hit page 10, somebody will bump it for the heck of it.  <br>This kills the Irohafag.</br>  <br>I've saved the thread multiple times that way<br>The only way Yahari will die is if the mods kill it</br></br>  <br>Spamming Yahari threads would only encourage mods to purge them.</br>  Don't worry, I can not translate like Spyro does word for word, but I can give summaries.  <br> save <br><br>no you just trap us here, again again agin and again....<br><br>I hope you burn in hell  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And when they do I will finally be released</br>  Iroha confirmed?<br><br>What's this yen press stuff, did they pick up the novels?</br></br>  anybody have pdfs for the volumes in case he takes it down? i'm too lazy to copy and paste from his site.  fuck those YP scumbags. How the hell i can buy the fucking translations of theirs if I'm not Western and I dont have money? and we have to wait for years for those shitheads. DAMN ITTTTTTTTT  <br>Yes, and Spyro is probably ending his translation which means we'll get shitty translations in 3-5 years.<br><br>check the last thread some anon posted a mega link</br></br></br>  Someone should make a torrent and upload it to nyaa  <br> Spyro is probably ending his translation <br><br>Why would he? All he has to do is translate shit and make torrents for each chapter or just the whole volume.</br></br></br>  <br>Here<br/></br>  <br>Don't worry, some anon will scan the YP translations for you. That's how things work since ages ago.</br>  epub<br>https://www.mediafire.com/?89du4zd7<wbr>n3hny</wbr></br>  I thought we officially moved over to /djt/  <br>This. Can we just get a torrent?</br>  <br>It's a bluff.</br>  <br>DDL is faster.</br>  <br>DDL can also get removed</br>  <br>Well, I understand the loss of motivation to some extent, but it's not that huge of a deal. I mean, the people that matter and read the current fan translation are not going to wait 7 years for the official TL of the last 2 volumes when there's a fan TL of them available already.<br><br>You TL for the faggots on 4chan and some other sites, not for the normalfags who may buy the novels and read them first time like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.<br>Is this the latest version with the fixed translation from kyakka?</br></br>  Someone please post the link for downloading volume 11 raw.<br>Please spoonfeed me!<br> My picture says otherwise! <br><br> Does 4chan captcha system has a problem? It isn't giving me captcha to solve. When I click the box, it just gets checked. </br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>You need motivation in order to translate for free though. What's the point of wasting your time translating a book you already read and taking the risk of getting DMCA's and C&amp;D's? <br><br>And by doing it off-line, you would spend 1-2 months of your time translating stuff just for some anons saying thanks, while others criticize your efforts by saying your TL sucks or it's biased</br></br></br>  <br>Implying Nyaa hasn't removed stuff before.</br>  <br>We've became jojofags.<br><br>Same mindless discussions, which x would you let buttfuck you, etc</br></br></br>  So do you want to continue reading fan TL or not?  <br>Aren't most of us heterosexual males though?</br>  <br>So do you want to continue reading fan TL or not?</br>  <br>Sounds familiar.</br>  I can't find 10.5 PDF in the MEGA link, anyone had it?  <br>i dont even understand how you localize shit..... like if they said it red and three times faster would they say live long and prosper or some shit?</br>  <br>Take the torrent and put it in pirate bay and kat.cr as well then.</br>  <br>Except we can "hear" when characters speak. Also, at least memesubs left "Hikky", "Yukinon" and even chose more literal approach for "suki... nano". I doubt YP will do the same.</br>  <br> even chose more literal approach for "suki... nano" <br>Watched raws, how did they handle it?</br></br>  SPYRO!<br><br>YOU CAN ALWAYS POST PDFs AND RENAME THEM AS SOMETHING.jpg AND POST IT ON YOUR BLOG UNDER SOME CONCEALED SPECIAL TITLE!<br><br>WE CAN CONVERT IT BACK TO PDF.<br><br>YEN PRESS CAN'T STOP YOU FROM POSTING IMAGES, CAN IT?<br><br>SO PLEASE! DON'T ABANDON IT!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't post in caps on this site, you newshit.</br>  <br>Spyro said memesub's "I'm in love" is more accurate than his own "I'm falling in love", and quickly fix it.<br><br>Localization and memes aside, Commie is infinitely better than shitstain that is HS/CR</br></br></br>  <br> spyro posts .jpg <br> convert it to .xls <br> extract numbers <br> compile into python <br> it's audio <br> record audio <br> use PC power to turn audio into random strings of text <br> use code decipher to turn code into actual readable text <br> all of this for 1 sentence <br> all it says is   "the pleasure of being YEN PRESSE'D inside" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's his waifu then?</br>  <br>Yukino<br><br>Not that there's any other problem aside from pure lack of motivation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thank you.</br></br>  <br>Actually HS is better than Commies more times than not. Yahari was a pleasant exception.</br>  <br> python? </br>  <br>Yeah, sorry, I mean specifically for Yahari<br><br>perhaps because Yahari is full of context relevant dialogue. I never find HS truly problematic for anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>we're all tsun for commie but yp is legit garbage</br>  <br> there are people on the /a/ that don't know about programing. </br>  I just hope Yukino won't win. She's the worst character, a lying selfish bitch and a drama queen to boot, I don't get why 8man cares so much about her when there are better girls around him already.  <br>Oh, and ungrateful as fuck, also.</br>  <br>no I'm pretty sure I know more about programming than you, but your line was confusing to me<br> compile into python <br>what do you mean? Compile using python? Compile into bytecode? Compile to python source code?</br></br></br>  <br>degrading other because they dont know aobut program language on about about anime and manga only degrades your own self worth anon</br>   We will never see Vol 11 and possibly 12/13 translated <br> No anime/movie/OVA to wrap up the series <br> Can only rely on 2ch spoiler/summaries to conclude the novel <br><br>Fuck this shit. Why cant Yen Press licence the series after Yahari is done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ is written in python.</br>  So, WW said that the ending has been foreshadowed in vol 10. Does that mean we'll get three integral ending? Like for example, Yukino character arc (almost the whole time yeah I know), friendship end (three of them having 'small luck'), and  someday  after story?  <br>I see, well I wasn't the OP of that post anyways so I don't know what he was talking about either.</br>  <br>are you sure? I read some where that 4chan was originally written in PHP by Shii or some sort. Did they change it later?</br>  <br>She'll win just fine. Winning her mom and oneesan.</br>  <br><br>That's actually what you guys get from a post that ends with yen pressing inside?</br></br>  <br> his own "I'm falling in love" <br>No. There's nothing wrong with that translation. The problem was that he initially translated it as "I like it," which basically missed the entire point of the scene.</br></br>  <br>programmers are pretty much autistic they always get focused on strange things.</br>  <br>yen press fucked other people <br>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-05/yen-press-licenses-my<wbr>-youth-romantic-comedy-is-wrong-as-<wbr>i-expected-how-to-raise-a-boring-gi<wbr>rlfriend-baccano-more/.90112</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>programmers are the reason you can shitpost on /a/ you ungrateful degenerate posing as a patrician</br>  <br> implying I'm not a programmer myself. </br>  <br>I post because I post and when I want to post I will make it so.</br>  <br>http://pastebin.com/4JVjS02b<br>That was the case in 2010. But we 2015 now.</br></br>  <br><br>implying you are not just a shitty web developer or only know java script</br></br>  <br>Nobody was translating Banco or Another S, so those are good picks.</br>  <br><br>As a yuibro, vol 10 left me mixed. I can get behind the implications of the other two plotlines though.</br></br>  <br> thinks java scripts is the lowest tier <br> my sides </br></br>  <br>But he is, anon.</br>  <br> being 8man <br> being content <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br> implying I didn't know C, C++, Java, .NET, Delphi, Ruby, Python, Lua, Javascript and bunch of other secondary languages.  <br><br> inb4 LISP or Haskell. Sorry I'm just a filthy code monkey who only know mainstream OOP languages </br></br></br>  Happy Birthday Yukinoshita Haruno!<br><br>May you find something  genuine soon!</br></br>    <br>but can swiftly go?</br>  <br>There is no rest in search of genuine.</br>  <br>I don't understand. If YP indeed wanting their shit to be accessible widely, why chose some heavy otaku pandering shit? Baccano is fine, but can't be said to Yahari and Saekano.  I'll gladly lining up first place for Saekano though. At least it is still in the middle of untouched territory and we're getting a second vol batch. </br>  <br>Time to learn another language!<br><br> Japanese. </br></br></br>  <br>Is it just me or does this artist draw the cutest 8mans?</br>  <br>sorry Apple fag.

She is super expressive in the manga, not really flat like in the anime.</br></br>  <br>The manga is more faithful to the LN than the anime is though.</br>  Hourly reminder that Yukino is a bitch that spent most of her time not caring about 8man and not thinking of him.  いろはす～  <br>Reminder that she did it all for him.</br>  <br> Cray XC40 <br>What?</br></br>  <br> Cray XC40 <br>wtf, are you mocking us?

I'm the prefect of the department in my institution that owns it though.</br>  <br>She was mad at him because the only way he knew to solve problems was by painting himself as the enemy, taking all the blame.<br><br>Also remember how buttmad he was after he forced the status quo in Hayama's group, which was foreshadowing for the subsequent club stasis before genuine, and also for the current situation.<br><br>She and Yuigahama actually care about him. Hell, Yukinoshita even ended up depending on him since she can't do shit by herself. She also acknowledged that in that extra memorandum.<br><br>She is definitely aware of her shuortcomings. Whether she will manage to overcome them or not and at what price will be the topic for volume 12, I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Saekano would be hell to translate. I'm not even sure if it'd be popular in America, it's not nearly as easy to get into as Yahari for someone new to the anime world.</br></br>  <br> prefect <br>what are you doing here, anon kun</br></br>  <br>Are you a retard? She told him he didn't have to come to club because she felt she/they were weighing him down. That he was perfectly capable of solving things on his own.</br>  <br>Exactly, she was extremely desperate to keep him from doing something stupid, hell she even went so far as to suggest they break the rules using one of 8man's old suggestions of lying about the votes.</br>  <br> not caring about 8man <br><br>She doesn't even care about her first and "supposedly" BFF whose keep reaching out to her but never got reciprocated</br></br></br>  <br>Missed a spot.<br><br> How about doing some push-ups to help (me) hold up my weapon...? </br></br></br>  But Ushio kai ni was like months ago!

No, I don't think it has, what with refrain being busy, I'll do it later today.</br>  <br>Thanks, the chapter looks cute as hell.</br>    <br>Good, because I feel like I can only fap to Fubuki.</br>  <br> sexualising ship girls </br>  <br>Fubuki is for tender love making.</br>  <br>That's still sexualising.</br>  <br>And what's wrong with that?</br>  <br>It's just that you're a kuso who sexualises his girls.</br>  <br> implying you wouldn't want to make love with a girl you love </br>  <br>Strangely enough, for me, that doesn't seem to apply to non original girls.</br>  <br> Fubuki <br> not original </br></br>  <br>I meant girls appearing only in H-manga.<br><br>And Fubuki is not exactly original, she's the "all-around average girl".</br></br></br>  <br>How about 6th desdiv?</br>  Too cute, I can't resist the urge to hug Kaga  <br><br>How can you say you love her if you can't even eat her curry?</br></br>  <br>They're not really original either, except maybe Akatsuki (I have no memory of a girl who is childish but wants to be treated as an adult).</br>  <br>Depends on who made it, I don't want to die prematurely and leave the other girls alone just to please one person.</br>    <br>Who is original? <br><br>Big breast, not original.<br>Small chest, not original.<br>Accent, not original.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I one night standed Makigumo on the beach because she begged for it. <br><br>I dont know how to react to this.</br></br></br>  <br>Sendai, Speedslut or Naka are pretty original.</br>  Is it possible to sexualize Samidare?  <br>Definitely.</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>By putting an erect dick in her?</br>  <br>I'm not sure I'm following.</br>  <br> today is my birthday <br> Shigure <br>No thanks</br></br></br>  <br>Think harder.</br>  <br>Since it's your birthday, ask for some decent taste.</br>  <br>Nothing, I think it's impossible to sexualize her.</br>  <br>I'm sure you can find some H-doujin featuring her. It means that people managed what you couldn't. Follow their example.</br>  I will post this occasionally until you like her.  <br>Since its my birthday, how about I get a gift that isn't a boy? Like Urakaze or Yayoi or Kiyoshimo or Naganami instead?</br>  <br>Pretty sure those are cosplayers.</br>  <br>Nice meme, mate.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  The after-effects of ship bullying by fellow ships!<br><br> It's been a while since this guy did these. Seems guy's pretty busy with illustration work for things that are not Kancolle <br><br>Yahagi: Hmm...<br><br>Yahagi: Yes! This time's Doll Admiral is probably the best I've made.<br><br>Yahagi: That said, I wonder if I made too much...?<br><br>Yahagi: Well, it can't be helped since I've gone and done it.<br><br>Yahagi: Where else shall I decorate with this I wonder~ <br><br>Caption: Tenryuu is sharing rooms with Yahagi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I one night standed Shigure at the park because we are madly in love.<br><br> mfw I don't have any favorite color <br> Other isn't even an option at this point <br> just rolled 1~9 and got 1 <br><br>I'm ok with this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why Chinese zodiac?</br>  <br>Because Western zodiac is determined by your birthday?</br>  <br><br> I got funky with Ushio in the classroom because she begged for it <br><br>C-can't be helped  ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br> I made love with Shigure in a row &gt;&gt;&gt;boat because she craves me </br>  <br>hnnng, my heart</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Webms are olev</br></br>  <br> boobs <br>I thought shigure was a boy.</br></br>  <br>See </br>    <br>Even if Shigurin was a boy I'd smash his ass so much he'd endlessly leak cum from his useless little cock for the rest of his life.</br>  <br>Nice blogpost. Subscribed</br>  <br> blogpost <br>Nice metapost, my kuso-oriented newfriend.</br></br>  <br><br>at least it gave me this cutie on the beach because madly in love.</br></br>  <br> getting intimate with Hamakaze in the hot springs because she begged for it <br><br>dick status: muh</br></br></br>  I'm so hungry for Ashigara.  Dayum    <br>Those fucking hai hais. I want to grab them.</br>  Took me long enough to realize that a tanned NuiNui is everything I ever wanted.    <br>I wish Shibafu drew all the ships in the entire game</br>  <br>I love slutty hai hai</br>  <br>Ashigara needs to be meatier</br>       you have fapped more to this anime/manga's character than you have read/watched the actual product <br><br>What is it, /a/non?</br></br>  <br>guilty but I can't help it shes so good.</br>  Musashi from Kancolle  Any Idolm@ster, Precure or Kancolle bitch.  <br>Nico from Love Live.</br>  I tried to watch index once but didn't like it after about 2 or 3 episodes.<br>Fapped to pic related a few times tho.</br>  <br>Curse you sweet mami</br>  I've re-watched Monogatari 5 times and read half the books.  <br>Bleach.<br>Kubo can draw sluts.</br></br>  Oreimo. God Kirino is such a little whore, thinking about her just gets me hard.  <br>Fap to her all you want but don't call her a whore.</br>    SAO stuff. The ntr is just soooo good.   Iori Minase <br> Kaga / Seaport Hime / Shimakaze-kun <br> any Bad End Pretty Cure <br><br>Never seen or read anything other than porn of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>watched only 3 or 4 episodes I think<br>its better to just go into Bake threads and obtain fap material there than watch this shitty pretentious anime</br></br></br>  Oreimo. I never even watched it but I want to rape Kirino so bad.  <br>Akiko Minase. Haven't read or seen the source material.<br><br>Aki Nijou from Maken-ki. Same as above.</br></br></br>  The brown kid from Summer Wars  Had plans on watching it but ended up fapping to doujins only.  <br>I actually fapped to this hard before actually watching the show</br>  Both of them actually.  <br>Oh man, I didn't know that guy is shorter than his sister.</br>  Precure.<br><br>Never seen a single episode of it, fapped to countless doujins.</br></br>  <br>I regret nothing</br>  <br>This but Louise. Holy fuck I want to rape her to death so bad.</br>  <br>Same here, i've splooged Misaka about 53 times.</br>  <br> rape her to death <br>This seems illogical and not possible.</br></br>    <br><br> Precure </br></br>  <br>A dude from Yemen raped his wife to death on their wedding night a couple of nights back so it's possible with a loli and I imagine Louise is tiny enough if not quite as young,</br>  So many fucking doujins about battleships, and I haven't even watched a minute.  <br>And what are the contributing factors to a death by rape? Broken hymen? internal ruptures or blunt force trauma?</br>  <br><br>fucking mudslimes goat fuckers smh</br></br>    <br>no</br>  <br>Some sort of bleeding I assume. I don't think he had beaten her, it was actually raped to death instead of raped and beaten to death. Dunno if it's vaginal or internal. Vaginal would be hotter.</br>  <br>By far.</br>  <br>They shouldn't have made her so goddamn delicious.</br>  who ever this bitch is  <br><br>would you watch Sento and the Fairies spinoff about pirates plundering booty?</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>That ass is awfully drawn.</br>  <br>I'd rather watch it for more of Kayne's pure alpha status.</br>  <br>wouldn't this be any character from a series you never read/watched, but read even one doujin of?<br><br>or is this limited to characters you read/watched the source on and still spent more time fapping?</br></br></br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  ITT: Nasuverse.  <br>Seconded. That shit is everywhere.</br>  <br>This, so much this.</br>  Nisekoi girls are delicious but the show sucks so that series for me    <br>Nasu-verse porn consists of the following:<br><br>80% Fate<br><br>15% Tsukihime<br><br>5% Everything else<br><br>And I have definitely weebed out to their IPs enough to deserve fapping to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Every Fairy Tail female character, Maki from Love Live, Fate series...<br>First ones that come to my mind.</br>  <br>touhou, code geass (which is saying something because I watched three times)</br>  Touhou and Kancolle, easily.<br>And since we're on this topic, have you ever picked up a show and discover a character in it that you had previously fapped to?</br>  <br>Pretty much whole cast. Hibiki, Makoto, Yayoi, Chihaya and Miki are perhaps the top five.<br><br>Watching it now for the first time after all these years and it feels quite weird.  Never touched the games. </br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm legitimately unsure if there's even an actual show for this or not. The porn: content ratio is a bit broken.</br></br>  <br>Pretty Cure, any idol show (though I watched most of the im@s anime), Pokémon, Narubleapiece, Evangelion.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Her DL Action volumes are condensed spring. Masterpiece.</br>  <br>queen's blade</br>  <br>Fapping to a 2D first and then watching their source material is kind of like watching porn where the girl is interviewed and shows a sweet, clever personality and then 5 minutes later she's getting pounded in the throat.<br><br>There's some sort of subtle dissonance.</br></br></br>  ITT: confess your sins /a/nons.<br><br> i enjoy the NGE dub despite it's flaws <br> i've never finished Haruhi <br> i think Berserk is overrated <br> i got bored with Clannad and stopped watching after Episode 2 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Pick up on the manga where it leaves off <br><br>STOP</br></br></br>  <br> Fairy Tail <br>Anon you got hooked hard. It's purely "made for readers" and not for himself unless you don't mind</br></br>  <br> this isn't a sin, its better than the first half by a landslide <br>I like the first half. Ever since Nui came along things went downhill.</br></br>  <br>Not understanding what you just said.</br>   i think Berserk is overrated   New episode soon. Let's see how bad is it.<br><br>PV:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<wbr>BDonHeTke1w</wbr></br></br>  RIP threads.  <br>MOTHERFUCKER!!!</br>  <br><br>Not him but I like it.
