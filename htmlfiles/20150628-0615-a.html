There is enough information provided to find the areas of ア, イ, ウ, エ, and オ.<br><br> Let A denote the area of the full rectangle.<br><br>Observe that ア + ウ = A/4 and イ + ウ = A/2.<br>Hence イ - ア = A/4.<br><br>Furthermore note that A - ウ = ア + イ + エ + オ = 16ア. Along with ア + ウ = A/4 this implies that 5ウ = A.<br><br>Hence ア + A/5 = A/4, or ア = A/20.<br>Also イ - A/20 = A/4, or イ = 3A/10.<br> And ウ = エ = A/5 and オ = A/4 as promised. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>   using japsquiggles in algebra  <br><br>THIRD NUKE<br>H<br>I<br>R<br>D<br><br>N<br>U<br>K<br>E</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No. We need a simple one that a 7 years old kid could understand<br><br><br>For example, we call those small parts red, blue, green, white<br><br>We have:<br>Red + blue = a<br>blue + green = b<br>green + white = c<br>red + white = d<br>We can calculate a,b,c,d simply, using basic maths, therefore, we can calculate red, blue, green, white easily too.<br>Sorry for my Englit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's actually pretty simple, you have the data for the lower triangle which in turn helps you solve the top triangle and the 4 side geometric shape, once that's left you can simply calculate the inner angles to find where the line cuts the middle triangle at and based on your knowledge that it has a 3cm adjacent side you calculate the hypotenuse giving you the data necessary to solve the left triangle and in the end all the solutions automatically solve the middle triangle</br>  <br>Heresy. Heresy of the highest degree.</br>  <br>nevermind i'm retarded</br>  (You could also calculate every given triangle with the "Law of Sines", "Sum of Angles in a Triangle", "Transversal Angles on paralell lines", "Angles on a Side of a Straight line", ("Angles in a 90° Corner"))  <br>Isn't this just telling us that 2 = 2?<br><br>You are basically saying that the whole area + 2 minus the whole area = 2. Which doesn't really help at all.</br></br></br>  You are making quite an assumption, assuming that the angles are right.  <br>2 is the most difficult triangle to solve, he is simply describing a way to solve it.</br>  <br>it's unsolvable because we don't know what the angles are<br><br>never assume</br></br></br>  <br>We do know the angles though.</br>  <br>You can find the angles easily</br>  <br>What did you do to Kurisu?</br>  <br><br>None are marked with right angle marks. Thus the entire thing could be a trapezoid for all we know.</br></br>  <br><br>You're both assuming that the object in question is actually a rectangle.</br></br>  <br><br>It says Rectangle on the blackboard. <br>Learn to read.</br></br></br>  <br>thats not fair anon i cant read</br>  Hey /a/, Japanese Mathematics teacher here.<br>You can solve （ア） if you use similar triangles without getting really complicated. (Though I don't really recommend this for ordinary 5th grades.)<br><br>Firstly, can you see 3:4 right triangle?</br></br></br>  no, you can't.<br><br>just forgot pic.</br></br>  and there is this 2:1 right triangle.  <br>Damn. Cheney's been around for a while.</br>  draw a perpendicular line in （ア）<br><br>and voila, you got 3:4 and 2:1 triangles in （ア）.</br></br>  forgot pic again.  Nah nigga I failed math 4 times in school what makes you think I can do that shit.  there I finally solved it<br> so retarded i took over 30 minutes to solve it <br><br>i was lucky to even be able to get into STEM</br></br></br>  not sure you guys are following me, but...<br><br>a:c = 2:1<br>b:c = 3:4<br>a:b:c = 8:3:4<br>a+b:c = 11:4<br>we know a+b=3cm, so c=12/11cm<br><br>（ア）=3 x 12/11 /2 =18/11</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i was lucky to even be able to get into STEM <br>I feel you, I have no idea how am I able to keep up.</br></br>  <br>it's thanks to those lazy pieces of shits I call my classmates that my teacher have so low standards that purely studying cuts it for me</br>  What's wrong with all these writers of fantasy LNs and manga?<br><br>It seems that they aren't capable of world building and character development that they have to resort to a virtual RPG system.<br><br>I don't need information about XP,HP, MP, status ailments and stats.</br></br></br></br>  I will fuck Red Chaika in the mouth!  I want to shave Chaika's eyebrows!  <br>It's called being a shit writer, OP.</br>  <br>hearing characters in akame ga kill use the words "level up" triggered the shit out of me</br>  <br>and then I will cum on her eyebrows!</br>  No they are not. <br><br>My guess is that they all like Rance a bit too much but ignore that it's a developed setting outside of the level stuff</br></br>  <br>I don't know about manga, but LNs are an incestuous creatively-bankrupt medium consisting entirely of teenaged kids ripping off existing fiction. So it's not surprising that they just ripoff whatever's popular and the result is generic schlock.<br><br>I hope you're not using Chaika as an example though, I thought it was a thoroughly competent fantasy story.</br></br></br>  <br>You fucking monster</br>  <br>I swear I just saw another thread like this.<br>And who cares about what you want, I like them.</br></br>  Is this the birth of an epic new meme?  <br> I hope you're not using Chaika as an example though <br><br>I'm using Chaika for Chaika's expression and Chaika a cutie.</br></br></br>  <br> What's wrong with all these writers of fantasy LNs and manga? <br>Western fantasy is all over Tolkien's dick. Eastern fantasy is all over a different dick.<br>What's the matter, don't like strange dicks?</br></br></br>  <br>Chaika is cute!<br>CUTE!</br></br>  <br>Are you kidding me? Chaika is trash aside from the girls.</br>  <br>Get fucked. Chaika was a decently fleshed out fantasy setting with some history and consistent themes.<br><br>Most importantly, it didn't fucking drown the viewers/readers in exposition every two pages. Toru and Akari don't have long conversations about what saboteurs are to inform the viewer despite the fact that both characters would know what saboteurs are. Instead, we get the details when they become contextually relevant.<br><br>That has to be the biggest pitfall in LNs: worthless exposition dumps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chaika had potential, but the author had no idea what he was doing with the world building. Or maybe the anime just did a poor job explaining it. Who knows.</br>  <br> Who knows. <br>People who read the manga might?<br>Why is it that anons keep insulting source material they have never touched?</br></br></br>   <br><br>Chaika is based on a LN. It's also shit aside from the cute girls.</br></br>  <br>Because it's an LN.<br><br><br>I disagree. The worldbuilding in Chaika was good, excellent by typical anime/manga/LN standards. I liked that it didn't explain things but kept the world as logically consistent as it could, and wasn't jacking off in my face all the time with fucking exposition dumps.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah man, I felt like the worldbuilding was great in the anime, atleast for the country itself. I dont know about the surrounding countries though.</br></br>  <br>It's a lot easier to use a standard RPG system that most of your NEET reader will understand without problems than to actually be creative.</br>  <br>Is this some new kind of bullying kids are into these days?</br>  On the flipside<br><br> setting the turns the RPG system on its back and makes the mechanics central to the story </br></br>  <br> flipside <br><br>more like the writer doesn't have any imagination</br></br></br>  <br> commenting on the author and his idea of world building <br> did not even touch the LN <br>secondary spotted</br></br></br>  I get it when both sides come in to play, but I don't get Danmachi.<br><br>Is it a game? What's with the game like levels and stats?</br></br>  <br> is it a game? <br>I think it is. Or at least from the gods' point of view.</br></br>  Chaika thread.  <br> That has to be the biggest pitfall in LNs: worthless exposition dumps. <br><br>Anime and manga as well. I cringe every time they force the dialogue just to give the viewers info.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't need what this show offers <br>so don't watch it</br></br>  <br>Technically, it is a game, if you're a God. Otherwise, it's a fantasy world with rpg elements integrated into the actual world, instead of being floating boxes</br>  <br><br>I've been thinking of starting a "Write your own WN" thread because I actually got some inspiration in another thread a while back after writing a post with a typical reincarnation isekai beginning.<br><br>The thing is, though, that I loathe this place and I have no idea why I come here except for the freedom and anonymity to call you cunts cunts, so now I'm hesitant to actually take the snippets I wrote and put it somewhere else where it might be actually tracked back to me through my seven skellington armies. I don't want people to know I come here, even if it's just to feel disgusted at you all. They might think I'm a pedo.<br><br>Long story short, I hate you all, but I might want to write a story here, wat do?<br><br> Of course the rational answer is turn 360 degrees and walk away, but 60% of you agree with everything I said above and I am a dumb fuck for thinking I might actually salvage something from here.

I are interested. </br>  <br>If you bring it to /tg/ under the guise of worldbuilding, you might get some pretty good mileage.</br>  <br>Use a proxy to upload it to pastebin or a similar site.

One more animoo themed thread won't look out of place.</br>  <br>They suck, that's what's wrong with them. There isn't a single good LN, they all inevitably fail to deliver as literature and as comics. It's like someone decided genre fiction needed a medium of its own.</br>  <br>Because it doesn't need anything you mentioned.<br><br>It is 100% moe pandering.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only that, it's BAD genre fiction. Say what you will about American scifi and fantasy authors, the average quality level fucking curbstomps LNs.</br>  <br> I am a dumb fuck for thinking I might actually salvage something from here. <br>Then I must be the dumbest fuck of them all.<br> Virtual Sky Lanterns, Dualists, Sensebound Lenses, Skillweaver, and Storied Tenement are all being written as we speak. </br></br></br>  <br> Then I must be the dumbest fuck of them all. <br><br>I think we all might be. We all are the dumbest fuck of them all. The dumbest.<br><br> Carry on and don't give up. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>We've been through this a couple of times now, and the answer is always the same; some writers are hacks.</br>  <br> There isn't a single good LN, they all inevitably fail to deliver as literature and as comics. <br>Yeah, they're all complete trash.</br></br>  <br><br>the anime is really bad are you kidding me?<br><br><br><br> Ben-to <br> Chaika <br> Inou Battle </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hi I'm a dumb EOP who pass his time reading shit translation of bad LNs, my opinion is so important and a fact </br></br>  <br> the anime is really bad are you kidding me? <br>Quite a majority of /a/ would disagree with you.</br></br>  Light Novels are by definition shit aside from 5 or 6 exceptions. Light Novel writers are hacks that just follow the same template established by their editors. They're simple yet effective entertainment for the otaku masses.  <br>Hayao Miyazaki is right.</br>  <br> Hayao Miyazaki is right. <br><br>An industry dominated by people who are sexually excited by child and incest create stuff that turns out to creatively incestuous and childish. Sounds about right.</br></br></br>  <br>They all suck pretty badly.</br>  <br> it has been 3 years since the anime.  <br>I'm getting old.<br><br>I think I'll make a fairy 3d model, when I have time</br></br></br></br>  I want to anally inseminate the Chaikas until they get pregnant.  <br>I've read stuff where girls are first penetrated anally and then the dick pushes through into the womb in a very bloody fashion, but I'm not aware of any such Chaika doujins.</br>   EOP talk shit about untranslated LN <br>topkek</br>  <br>They're just awful writers that don't know to write character progression without numbers thrown around everywhere. I can count the number of LN/manga I've read that have done this and not have it be completely immersion breaking on one hand.</br>  Best Chaika doujin  <br> the average quality level fucking curbstomps LNs <br>Completely wrong. There's just more material available in English so it's easier for you when you google "best scifi novels".</br></br>  <br>plus the fan translated LNs are google translator tier</br>  I appears that you're not on the front page anymore, Chaika.<br>Let's fix that.</br>  Slayers was a fantasy LN, and it's one of the best western fantasies period.<br><br>Of course, it has only one word as the title so modern LN writers would have a fucking heart-attack. It also has an MC who is both a girl and a native to the fantasy world instead of some japanese school-boy who slipped on some panties and fell into a wormhole.</br></br>  <br>Yet as much as Lina Inverse should appeal to me, I could never get into the series proper at all. The movie was okay in its own right though.</br>  <br>There are plenty of fantasy LN and manga that aren't based on MMOs, but apparently you'd rather complain about things you don't like than go read things you do.</br>  <br> the anime is really bad <br>So you're judging the quality of a book based on its adaptation? Why do you even expect anyone to take your opinion seriously.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you're just a pleb.</br>  <br>A shame most of the ones that get anime are Dragon Quest rip-offs/parodies.</br>  <br>The saddest thing is that the actual Dragon Quest games are better written than those novels. Not to mention the Dragon Quest manga and novelizations who are even better.</br>  <br>S2 never</br>  Who gets do decide on all those shortened names like OreImo, DanMachi, OregaIru etc.?  <br>These Jap writers have been so engulfed by video game terminology that they genuinely don't know how to express these basic human concepts like strength, health, and mental status in a non-numerical manner.</br>  <br>The Japs, of course.</br>  <br>And some of them actually have the balls to ask for money in compensation of their "work".</br>  Danmachi is a challenging story.<br>No challenge, no success.<br>By the way, are you absolutely certain this world is not an MMORPG?</br></br>  <br>What's worse is that people actually give them money.</br>  <br>Watashi is still best girl even after all these years.</br>  <br>Welcome to the internet, where dumbfucks are easily duped to give e-beggars money.</br>  <br>It would be easy to peg me as such if I were one of those types who refuses to watch anything that aired before 2010.</br>  <br><br><br>If people are willing to give money to people like Sarkeesian or Noah Antwiler, then yeah you really shouldn't be surprised.</br></br></br>  <br>We should ask the other question then. Why are there people out there eating their shit gleefully?</br>  <br> Sarkeesian <br><br>Someone should pretend to be a feminist and troll the fuck out of those translation sites. They have lots of "problematic" content after all.</br></br></br>  <br>That's like asking why people happily eat shitty fast food like McDonald's and Taco Bell despite doctors saying that crap can kill you.</br>  <br>They're cheap and delicious?</br>  <br> DQ7 novel will never be translated <br><br>Life is suffering.</br></br></br>  <br> There isn't a single good LN </br>  <br>Yeah, /tg/ is already infested with anime fetishes since a long time ago.</br>  <br> that just follow the same template established by their editors <br><br>Reminds me of The Sacred Blacksmith where the author is stealthily writing a shoujo under all the cute girls and fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br> The Sacred Blacksmith <br><br>I love that  rape  scene.</br></br></br>  <br>The author backpedalled on that.</br>  <br>Too long, anon</br>  <br>I know. Still great though.</br>  <br>Thinking about it, the fairies in Jinrui act somewhat similar to the classic fairies in fairytales. Cute, mysterious, powerful, and having thought process quite alien to ours.</br>  <br><br> implying any of the popular LNs are any better in Japanese </br></br>  <br>Jesus. I should have bought 300 more copies of the second volume.</br>  <br><br>how would they stay warm?</br></br>  The thing with LNs is, if they're good enough and well-recieved, they simply continue on forever reusing or making new plotlines (DxD, Index, etc)<br><br>And if they're bad they simply get cancelled and fade off without really having any solid conclusion<br><br>It's a format that, by DESIGN, creates works that will never properly end regardless of whether it does well and remains popular or not. It's a "sling shit against the wall and see what sticks" kind of business. <br><br>RPG formats are easy to write around and the perfect background for battle harem crap, so of course many LNs end up going that route. High school stories are another easy route.<br><br>Point being, LNs are a blight on anime in general, but it's unlikely they'll be going anywhere. If you're tired of reused plotlines and no solid conclusions, simply stop watching LN-based anime because that's all there will be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically, they're just like third-world soap operas.</br>  There is a lot of fantasy LN without rpg format but a lot of them were influenced by Dragon Quest in the same way as the West was influenced by Tolken  <br> If you're tired of reused plotlines and no solid conclusions, simply stop watching anime <br>fixed that for you</br></br>  <br>Why don't they just adapt the actual Dragon Quest instead of all the LNs inspired by it?</br>  <br>Because the companies who make the LNs are the ones willing to fund an anime.</br>  <br>Seriously. The first two volumes are still sitting on my shelf, looking incredibly lonely, with only the lone released version of Kino no Tabi to keep them company. I really should just give in and learn moon.</br>  <br>And the fact that DQ doesn't need any animu advertisement.</br>  I've read so many LNs, dropped many but the only one I really enjoyed was Haruhi. I dunno what that series did that made itself work compared to the other crap I had to deal with.  <br>Maybe the fact that most of the stuff you read was either translated by a machine, by someone who went japanese to chinese (badly) to english or by an autist NEET with no skill in either english or japanese?</br>  <br><br>Wasn't the last DQ Dragon Warrior VIII? That's PS2 era.<br><br>It always surprised me a little how it seems like DQ absolutely dominates the Japanese meme-space for fantasy clichés in contrast with FF.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nevermind, I was wrong, there's been more since then.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't know why DQ influenced so much LNs in the first place. A boom caused by DQX perhaps?</br>  <br>I want to become a Chaika, how do I go about this?</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>Remember to keep relaxing and taking it easy.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> show <br>mine's from a game mate, please don't exclude</br></br>  <br>Hey look, a rare sight.

I truly love you! <br> Taki-sensei:If you still feel the same way in 10 years, I will marry you. <br> 10 year timeskip <br> The day of Reina and Taki-sensei's wedding <br> Taki-sensei is 44 and Reina is 26 <br> The Kitauji High School band comes back together to play songs for the wedding <br> Kumiko and Shuichi's children are members of the audience <br> Final shot of the anime is Taki-sensei princess carrying Reina away for their honeymoon <br><br>Calling it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because crying anime girls is my fetish.</br>  <br>Responding to you from the last thread, it wouldn't be in Taki's character to make that sort of promise, as it's not one he can reasonably keep. He would have to not date anyone for 10 years.</br>  <br>Hmm... I didn't consider that, anon... shoujo endings often ignore that kind of thing in favor of creating a touching story, though, so it's okay.</br>  <br>Hibike isn't really shoujo and nothing about it would indicate such a silly ending to the series.</br>  <br>Maybe not from Kumiko's perspective, but Hibike has been nothing but a shoujo for Reina</br>  BD Vol 1 has subs now.

We've had like 4 goddamn episodes of build up where Kumiko was shown admiring Reina more and more, and now she's realizing that she's becoming more like Reina. Makes total sense.</br>  <br>Its bait anon.</br>  <br> smug faggotts </br>  <br> I'll marry you if you can get into Tokyo University <br> Reina hasn't been studying at all, only playing the trumpet  <br>Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I was being pretty serious. These fucking girls overthink everything too fucking much.<br><br> NEE-CHAN QUIT EUPHO...? WHY!? SHE LOVED EUPHO!! SHOULD I QUIT IT TOO?? NO... I LOVE EUPHO AND KUYASHIIIIIIIIII <br><br>Everything is forced.

Why be in band when you're not going to do anything with it in the future? Studying would be more useful. In the last episode she's seemed to have resolved that she's in it because she indeed loves playing the euphonium. She's not in it because she admired her sister or had nothing better to do, she loves to play music and that's reason enough to be in band.</br></br>  What happened to her smile again? I'm pretty sure that the situations established at the beginning of the episode were resolved at the end of the episode.  <br>Hey bud, guess what. It's an anime series based on a book series aimed at teenage girls. Go watch Death Note or something if you want something a little more intellectually stimulating.</br>  <br><br>Middle schooll band drama, Sister giving up band, and Shuichi calling her ugly.</br></br>  <br> ep 13 starts <br> kumiko wakes up <br> its the morning of her middle school competition <br> with newfound passion and creative spark she's able to take her school to the next round.  <br> her and Reina hagu after getting the real gold <br> "lets become special" <br> quick reconciliation with Shuichi before she's welcomed home by her sister </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And this is what disappoints me: all you want is void entertainment, you don't want something that'll make you think. At the end of the day, all you want if your fucking cute little girls doing cute shit.</br>  <br><br> Shuichi calling her ugly. <br><br>He never apologize didnt he? What a dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He is indeed a total weiner.</br></br>  <br>Oboe looks deeper in despair.</br>  That was painful to watch. Too much tears in this show.  <br>bwuaaha</br>  <br>I like how you responded to the guy who basically said "it's just stupid don't worry about it" instead of the other two who actually answered your question.</br>  <br>TYBKA</br>  <br><br><br>The anime skipped his apology to make Kumiko pissy about him.</br></br></br>  Better stomp the fuck out of him.  <br><br>Remember when Shuichi lightly punched Kumiko on the back for ignoring him? Yup Motherfucking parallels man.</br></br>  <br>Makes me think they intentionally altered his scenes for this.</br>  <br>When was that again?</br>  <br>I remember Kumiko is having in trouble with her fingering, and is walking around like a crazy person playing the air euphonium. Pretty sure its right before he asks her to festival.</br>  kyoani will never have a better MC  <br>They remade Kyon once, they can do it again.</br>  <br>Railway station.</br>  yfw Episode 13 ends with "So the next piece begins" with a focus shot on Oboe-chan as someone calls her by name  Hibike:<br>#3: 中野 (Nakano ___)<br>#7: 高橋 沙里 (Takahashi Sari)<br>#27: 石上 (Ishigami _____)<br>#26: 野口 (Noguchi _____) &lt;--- Is she related to Hideri?<br>#57: 臼井 (Usui)<br>#60: ___ 川 ___子 (___kawa ____ko)<br>#42: 日 ___ 子 ____ (Nichi____ ___ko)<br>#49: 古木 のぞみ (Furuki Nozomi)<br>#21: Yoshizawa Akiko<br>#17: Kabe Tomoe<br><br>Sorry guys.

I've never even heard #26 talk before.</br>  <br>Wait for the next BD. There'll be names all over the place.</br>  <br>That's why its threads have so much deep, insightful discussion going on, right?</br>  <br>Woah dude, no need to be rude. This person and their friend took a lot of time to translate these names.</br>  <br>She spoke in episode 11. It's possible some seiyuufag could recognize her.</br>  <br><br>I like how Shuichi and Kumiko scenes are subtle and well done.</br></br>  <br>It could be, but the constant yuri-baiting cheapens the experience.</br>  <br>There's 0 correlation between what /a/ threads are like and what shows are like.</br>  <br> took a lot of time <br>No wonder they did such a great job. It shouldn't "take a lot of time" to read names.</br></br>  <br>Translation: "I don't like yuri."</br>  <br>Really? I don't think I've ever heard #57 talk before.</br>  <br>I like yuri though, this is yuri baiting.</br>  <br> read names <br>There's a difference between translating and reading. I'm pretty sure the former takes more time to do.</br></br>  <br>This happens all the time. Whether the show is good or bad, if it has a lot of people interested in it a lot of back-to-back threads will be made. People run out of things to talk about. Then people talk about nothing/shitpost/argue over stupid things. This is why generals are so looked down upon. Even so, if a thread exists people will want to come and hang out.</br>  <br>Show: two girls become close because they understand and admire eachother, with a bit of playful flirty stuff occasionally mixed in because they're teenagers.<br><br>/a/: Fucking yuri-baiting, kyoani lost their way.<br><br>Why is erotic lust the only kind of love /a/ understands?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never heard of a seiyuu with the surname Noguchi before.

Maybe later.</br>  <br>Not him but if a show throws yuri hints with no intent whatsoever to have the two in question have feelings for each other for the purpose of appealing to viewers then yes, I can see why some would feel their intellect was insulted. <br><br>I remember reading that the creators wanted to make something like Chihayafuru and I think they could have gotten a lot closer to that feeling if they weren't pandering, or a at least tried to be subtle about it.</br></br></br>  <br>He's right though.</br>   MUH TEAMMATES   <br><br>Hopefully this will help, anon<br><br>#3: 中野 蕾実 (Nakano Tsubomi)<br>#7: 高橋 沙里 (Takahashi Sari)<br>#17: 加部 友恵 (Kabe Tomoe)<br>#21: 吉沢 秋子 (Yoshizawa Akiko)<br>#26 (Seiyuu): 野口 (Noguchi)<br>#27 (Seiyuu): 石上 (Ishigami)<br>#32: 堺 万紗子 (Sakai Masako)<br>#33: 加山サキ (Kayama Saki)<br>#37: カマヤ ツバメ (Kamaya Tsubame)<br>#38: 福井 (Fukui)<br>#39: 赤松 (Akamatsu)<br>#42 (Seiyuu): 日笠 陽子 (Hikasa Youko) <br>#49 (Seiyuu): 古木 のぞみ (Furuki Nozomi)<br>#50: 植田 日和子 (Ueda Hiyoko)<br>#52: 田中須加美 (Tanaka Suka bi?

Also pic related.</br></br>  <br>Pic related is subtext, not bait.</br>  <br> Given literally everything else in all three novels prior where we're given Kumiko's POV, there's nothing that hints she has any feelings for him more than friendship outside of one vague line in the epilogue for novel 3 <br><br>Kumiko's reaction to Hazuki and Shuuichi's date in novel 1:<br><br> "Hazuki-chan's been like that for a while now." <br><br> Sapphire lowered her voice as she responded. <br> "She's going to the festival with the person she likes today. And she's planning to confess to him." <br><br> "Oh man, youth on full display! Gives me heartburn just hearing about it!" <br> Natsuki's face clearly twisted. Her voice was pretty loud, but Hazuki gave no reaction. Somehow, she couldn't hear a thing. <br><br> That "person she likes" was no doubt Shuuichi. In an attempt to turn her attention away from the conversation, Kumiko let out a small sigh. She felt a little sick. As if something in her stomach was bubbling up, a muddy sort of feeling began to well up inside her. And as if it was able to course though every one of her veins, the feeling began to spread throughout her body. As if in an attempt to cool the fever that had accumulated in her fingertips, Kumiko gripper her euphonium tightly. I don't like this. I really don't. She couldn't quite explain why, but the thought simply drifted through her mind. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JUST<br> ;_; </br></br>  We all desire to get good. <br><br><br>No, you stupid mong, the whole river practice and bridge scene is a lead up to the cheering up scene.<br><br>Fucking cock mongler, get your head set straight. Fucking communists. <br><br><br>A good thing Shuichi turned down Hazuki. A true capitalist only strives for true love.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A true capitalist <br>What?</br></br>  <br>A true capitalist indeed.</br>  <br><br>Kyoani will always find a way to insert yuri bait even if it's at the expense of other characters.</br></br>  <br> Fucking communists <br> A true capitalist <br><br>anon are you ok</br></br></br></br>  <br>So Natsuki and Asuka speak Kansai-ben in the novels? Can't remember hearing any Kansai-ben in the anime.</br>  <br>Yes they dropped it unfortunately.</br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere that everyone except Kumiko speaks Kansai-ben, since she's a filthy immigrant.</br>  <br>That would be fucking hell to do in the anime.</br>  <br>Northern voice actors have done kansai-ben before though, it's not exactly impossible.</br>  <br>What I mean is having 1-2 characters is fine, but everyone expect MC speaking in Kansai-ben looks weird to me.</br>  <br>But they're in Kansai. Do you also find it odd for e.g. Irishmen to speak with Irish accents?</br>  <br>Waiting anxiously for another anime to go full Saki.</br>  <br>Well fair enough. It's just that I don't remember a anime where the whole cast speaks in Kansai-ben.</br>  <br>It's not like it'd be that weird, lovely complex did something similar with a different accent iirc.</br>  <br> unfortunately. <br>You mean fortunately.</br></br>  <br> Waiting anxiously for another anime to go full Saki. <br>A bunch of kanto actresses faking accents?</br></br>  <br>No, I think it's sex</br>  <br>You bet. Fake accents in a language I can't understand are my favorite.</br>      <br><br>Sasuga Kyoani.<br><br> At least change the file name, faggot </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> maximum yuribait <br> tumblr <br>Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>Can't see kumifeet due to shit scan.<br>Fix this.</br></br>  <br>Reina sharing her skincare routine to help a girl out</br>  <br><br><br>Why can't they just make them the official pair? Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that'd be gay.</br>  <br>Because KyoAni is not filled with raging homosexuals. Hopefully. </br>  Those two really have the most awkward friendship.  <br>Because Reina loves Taki-sensei.</br>  <br>They are in your heart, Anon.</br>  <br>The more I see promo art featuring Reina and Kumiko getting intimate, the more I get mad at Kyoani for not having the guts to ship them. I really hope they reconsider after all the positive feedback from the fans and make a S2 with them as the end pairing.</br>  Is that lip gloss she's putting on her?  <br> no regrets <br>Shine on, you crazy diamond.</br></br>  <br>Its just bait, but I do think the animators likes drawing them together.</br>  <br> the animators <br>Yeah, because they're definitely the ones in control of what gets drawn.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it will very likely happen.<br>Hetfags are on the wrong side of history.</br></br>  <br> character does something I disagree with and doesn't do what I wanted/expected them to <br> wow what a shit character <br>I bet you hated Yura too you mongrel.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this a real tweet? I won't be fooled by your lies, internet.</br>  <br><br>I know it's bait and that's why I'm upset. They compliment each other so well, Reina is the reason why Kumiko starts liking music again. They inspire and encourage each other. It all makes sense. Replace Shuichi with a rock and the show would still be the same. They should have never added his character.</br></br>  Am I the only one who wants Shoeboy to win?  <br> https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/sta<wbr>tus/614490471558033408</wbr> </br>   yuri show <br> no yuri <br><br>Why does KyoAni always do this to us?</br></br></br>  <br>The tweet is %100 real.</br>  <br>Technically everyone in Haruhi should speak Kansai-ben too.</br>  <br>His character does inspire her. Have you not watch the last episodes?</br>  <br> all that grease </br>  <br>Crunchyroll's twitter is a fool.</br>  <br>I like his interactions with GEH, they are cute and not kind of creepy like half of hers with Reina.</br>  <br>Time to die.</br>  <br>It's real but it's really just CR baiting a bit</br>  <br><br>No, it's Reina that inspires her. She's even the one she calls at the middle of the night to seek comfort. I will be angry if they suddenly make Kumiko like Shuichi at the final episode. It is shit writing and a fucking asspull.</br></br>  <br>Still not as bad as the "we did it!" when Free was announced.</br>  <br>It's like watching someone ignorant of everything behind the show and just watching it without posting in any discussions. They'd think it was gay and they'd be none the wiser to know it isn't. It's sort of pure, innocent, in its ignorance.</br>  <br>But she doesn't like Reina that way and she likes Taki anyway.<br>She was so fucking butthurt at him about what he said to her in their last year of middle school she even changed her hairstyle, that's love.</br></br>  <br>She will go to Tokyo Uni I'm sure.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit you cant possibly be real.</br></br>  <br>More legit than pretending she's in love with Reina or something.<br>Even the source material is against you.</br></br>  <br> She was so fucking butthurt at him about what he said to her in their last year of middle school she even changed her hairstyle, that's love. <br>I don't hate the shoe and I don't deny she ends up with him in the novels but that's retard logic</br></br>  <br>There's very few people left here on /a/ who still expect a yuri end, so there shouldn't be too much of a shitstorm when the anime ends here.<br><br>But I can only imagine how bad it's going to be everywhere else where everyone seems certain Kumiko and Reina are a couple.</br></br></br>  <br>Reina isn't the only one that inspired her though, seeing Shuuichi work hard also made Kumiko want to as well. Look I get being angry at the bait. But Kumiko does care about Shuuichi, he does inspire her. They are going to have their scene together next ep, maybe it will be romantic maybe not. But the episodes have been building up for them to reconcile their relationship in the final ep. Kumiko and Shuuichi don't get together until the end of the 3rd novel anyway.</br>  <br>Because it's nothing but shameless cheap bait.</br>  <br><br>Its an adaptation where they haven't been shy to change or ditch entirely the source material when it suited them. What matters is what's on the screen, and Reina is on screen with Kumiko a hell of a lot more than Shoe is, and in far more intimate situations.</br></br>  <br>You're right, this is much worse than that.</br>  As much as I hate to say this<br>Kumiko and Shuuichi as a couple is a given and pretty obvious, you have to be really delusional to still believe she might end up with Reina at this point, especially after the last episode</br>  <br>  Especially after the last episode <br>What the fuck are you talking about</br></br>  <br><br>I will lose respect for Kyoani if they make it romantic. There is no build-up, the attraction is one-sided and they don't even have good chemistry.<br><br>Also, I prefer if Reina confesses to Taki and he denies her early so that a Kumiko-Reina is possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one gives a shit about what you or anyone thinks.</br>  <br> Its an adaptation where they haven't been shy to change or ditch entirely the source material when it suited them. <br>On the contrary, it's an adaption where they HAVE been shy to ditch the source material. If they wanted to go anime original yuri, they never would've included the hints that Shu1 wants to get it on with Kumiko, nor Reina's Taki crush. When it comes down to it, they still tried to stay true to the spirit of the story as they well should.</br></br>  <br><br>Almost no one here thinks RxK will happen, but ShoexKumiko isn't "obvious" it's functionally undeveloped in the show.</br></br>  <br>Did you not see how Reina reacted when she heard Kumiko spent time with Taki-Sensei?</br>  <br> being this mad <br>it just won't happen, give up really</br></br>  <br>No one is deluded. People just prefer a ship. I don't think many even care about end game at this point.</br>  <br>are you blind or something?</br>  <br>Now that's just delusion.</br>  <br>to be fair that can be interpreted in many ways. and honestly you would have to be retarded if you think someone is stealing your crush even when they have shown no signs of being interested in them</br>  <br>Because you deserve to be blueballed for all eternity.</br>  <br>Because the only good thing about her is her disappointment voice</br>  <br>Kumiko deserves nothing</br>  <br><br> Almost no one here thinks RxK will happen <br><br>I think it's possible if there's another season. Kumiko-Reina sells they'll make the proper adjustments. Nobody literally cares about Shuichi. It would be great if they make Reina confess to Taki-sensei and gets rejected at the end of this season. I'd throw them all of my money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So she doesn't realize what she wants is right in front of her. She's a girl with a crush. Whatcha gon' do.<br><br> inb4 "but it's so much MOOOOOOOOORE" </br></br></br>  <br> to be fair that can be interpreted in many ways <br>Not really.<br>I'm sure some people grasping at straws would try to interpret it as Reina being jealous because Kumiko was with a man at night, but those are diehard shippers. Reina has never shown to be even remotely jealous over Kumiko being with other people, and it makes no sense in the context of their relationship.</br></br></br>  <br> The anime skipped his apology to make room for yuribait to get yuribucks <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>Not even her own euphonium san?</br>  <br>What does that have to do with Kumiko and Shuichi</br>  <br>There are hints everywhere in the show, it's not as evident because Kumiko is still realizing her feelings</br>  <br>It means that the last episode clearly showed that Reina is still madly in love with Taki-Sensei and doesn't think of Kumiko as a possible love interest.</br>  <br>reina is just a schoolgirl with a crush, she probably wants to know if taki said anything about her. i mean who gets jealous over someone spending time with someone else even i they don't much care about them.<br>lets be honest that it wasn't that good of a scene anyway</br></br>  <br>There are a few small moments, but the two have only had two or three scenes with each other. Shu is underdeveloped as a character in general, and their relationship is almost nonexistent save for their past relationship.</br>  <br> actually believing KyoAni gives a shit about butthurt western fan response </br>  <br>At least the novel made it more obvious.</br>  <br>No, euphonium-san would be better with Amethyst</br>  <br>Everybody likes them, not just the west. Just look at pixie.</br>  <br>I wonder if we'll see Aoi in the audience.</br>  <br> i mean who gets jealous over someone spending time with someone else even i they don't much care about them. <br>Reina does.<br>Her entire personality can literally be summed up as "muh taki".</br></br></br>  <br>Novel 2 shows Reina depress because she thinks the new adviser is going out with Taki. Who is also Taki's friend from college. <br><br>I'm sorry but she gets jealous very easily, and can become yandere.</br></br></br>  <br>She'll have a ticket, stand outside the concert hall for a half hour, then walk home.</br>  <br> I wonder if we'll see Aoi in the audience. <br>She will most likely. She's Haruka's friend after all.</br></br>  <br> you will never see that being animated </br>  i honestly don't want shu to win the kumikobowl just because he's so undeveloped as a character. i mean what do we know about him, he's the worst trumpet player and he wants to improve. if they gave him some more development i wouldn't mind but if they get together it will be one hell of an asspull  <br>Good job cherry picking that last frame. Reina looks interested or concerned in that scene, not jealous, and the way the scene cuts out at the end is pretty clear evidence that nothing of note happens during it.</br>  <br>She even breaks her glass cup cause it makes her blood boil.</br>  <br>looks like she picked the wrong week as we have a defective Nagato that can't save her!</br>  <br> what is Class S? <br><br>being obsessed with genuine homosex or "queer representation" is a thoroughly western phenomenon<br><br>that's why you don't see Kyoani twitter fellate shibuya legislation, but CR twitter co-opting eupho to promote American gay marriage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the joke <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> your head </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reina looks interested or concerned in that scene, not jealous, <br>Are you serious? She literally drops her wattle bottle, freezes for a few moments, then stops listening to what Kumiko is saying to make her talk more about what happened with Taki-Sensei.<br><br>What do you think was the point of this scene?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He plays trombone, and he's not that bad. He just started playing it. He swapped from french horn. <br><br>He has some development but I don't think Kumiko will get with him in this final episode. In the novel they only got together at the end of novel 3. I can only guess that there scene will just cause Kumiko to finally see him in a different light. You know see him as a boy not a friend.</br></br></br>  <br>She is about to join Kaori as a sinful Haibane.</br>  <br>I've read your post twice and I've come to the conclusion that I have no idea what you intended that response to mean.</br>  <br>ターキー？</br>  <br>I don't think these were small moments, you just need to see the look in her eyes when seeing Shuichi trying to get better, and how Kumiko reacted to Hazuki's confession to get how tsun she is<br>the yelling scene, and the river scene only make it even more obvious</br></br>  I can't believe people can deny the truth this goddamn hard.<br>The original source is goddamn exist, read it and end this useless debate already. Or ask the author directly or shit just DO something because this is getting annoying.</br>  <br> What do you think was the point of this scene? <br>Showing that she was surprised? Regardless, it's clear that this event probably isn't going to lead to any drama, otherwise it would have actually been focused on.</br></br>  <br> what is class S? <br><br>Something this board thinks about far more than any Japanese discussion I've seen ever has. A cute couple is a cute couple; nobody drawing the tons of Kumirei art is thinking about that in the slightest.</br></br></br>  <br> they don't even have good chemistry <br><br>You don't like the gehs anon?</br></br></br>  <br> You know see him as a boy not a friend. <br>I don't know what makes you think the story is heading this way.</br></br>  <br>yuri fanart on pixiv does not equate interest in actual lesbian couples is what it means<br><br>Class S is a concept among japs and not what westerners like you want<br><br>Kyoani is working within that concept and won't give you lesbians because neither they nor their fans actually give a shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone knows about the source already, and they've all decided if they care or not too. This point is meaningless.</br>  <br>But didn't you hear anon, the author was forced by publishers to have a normal het ending. KyoAni is reworking the story to fit the original vision.</br>  <br>Kaori is a saint.</br>  <br>No, it was to show once again that she's completely obsessed with Taki-Sensei.<br><br>They can show her being concerned about Kumiko without the yandere vibes they use exclusively for Taki-Sensei.</br></br></br>  <br> yuri fanart on pixiv does not equate interest in actual lesbian couples is what it means <br>I guess you're right. There's nothing gay about the fanart at all, really.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why was the scene cut short?</br>  <br> hurr what is IRC fucking up the place <br> what are crossboarders shitposters from /v/  <br><br>Please anon, end yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why this whole damn thing is fucking retarded.<br><br>Source pls. I want actual source, something that really legit, coming from the author itself, nit baseless rumor from 2ch or 2chan.</br></br></br>  <br>God dammit, is the novel translated? My moonrunes level doesn't allow me to read kanji unless there's furigana</br>  <br>Kumiko wasn't tsun during the yelling scene. She was genuinely upset because of what happened in band. The River scene was more about how they are becoming friends again. Again they aren't gonna get together in the last episode. But they will fix their friendship and hopefully give a hint of Kumiko's feelings towards him.</br>  <br>But it wasn't? It clearly showed that she's still obsessed with Taki-Sensei. There was no need to make it any longer than it already was. They're not planning on making the next episode have some kind of drama between Kumiko and Reina.</br>  <br>stay salty but it won't change anything<br><br>Kyoani literally does not care for your queer crusade and they won't make them canon lesbians to satisfy western "progressives"</br></br></br>   Ribbons did nothing wrong   Guys could we stop the discussion for a moment to agree on the universal miracle that is Peace-chan?  <br> That's why this whole damn thing is fucking retarded. <br>No, because many have decided that they don't care about the source material. So they want other evidence to convince them.</br></br>  <br>You're so delusional you qualify as an Akibaranger.</br>  <br> you just need to see the look in her eyes when seeing Shuichi trying to get better <br>You're reaching.<br> and how Kumiko reacted to Hazuki's confession <br>Which never happened in the anime.<br> how tsun she is the yelling scene <br>There is no dere.<br> and the river scene only make it even more obvious <br>You're reaching. Again. In fact, isn't this the same reaching you did already?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Source pls. <br>Anon was being sarcastic. That's a rumor invented by butthurt yurifags who'll grasp at any straw to deny the reality in front of their eyes.</br></br>  <br> But it wasn't? <br>What? They literally cut the scene while the two are still talking.</br></br>  <br>who?</br>   mfw animesuki <br><br>I want to see these faggots bitch and whine by the end of the show.</br></br>  Can't wait for Kumiko Love Story movie, /a/  <br>Yes she did   she choosed to wear that ugly ribbon  </br>  <br>There is a difference to seeing a friend who is a guy, as either a friend or a boy. Once you start to see your friend as a boy and not a friend. It means you notice his looks and start to have feelings for him. It happens a lot between a girl and boy friendship. its the same in reverse when the guy starts to see his female friend as a girl.</br>  <br>The whole fanbase are just idiots.</br>  <br>The point of that scene was to show Reina's yandere tendencies for Taki-Sensei.<br>The point of that scene was not to have drama based on a misunderstanding. That's why the misunderstanding was resolved off-screen like five seconds later.</br></br>  <br> salty <br>Yes. Project more. Use buzzwords more. It feeds me. NOM NOM.<br><br> Kyoani literally does not care for your queer crusade <br>And you base this on?<br>Also..<br> your queer crusade <br> projecting again <br>NOM NOM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Peace-chan <br> Miracle <br>Pic related is the only miracle.</br></br></br>  Time for bestsuki  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>Mikino.</br>  <br>Holy flipping fuck, I know what the phrase means, Anonymous. I asked you what made you think they were going to incorporate something like that into the last episode.</br>  <br>No one is salty, people just ship what they want.</br>  <br>That's still weird to use<br><br>Right fagott.</br></br></br>  <br>a.k.a. 2nd</br>  <br>Absolutely</br>  <br>She's a bitch, I can tell just by looking at her.</br>  <br>You're a bitch. I can tell by the way you type.</br>  <br> No, because many have decided that they don't care about the source material. <br>You can decide you don't care about source material, but that doesn't make source material any less important.</br></br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth</br>  There are hints that Kumiko may like Shuichi but it's subtle since Kyoani downplayed it but it's there still there.  <br>I just wanted someone to post that image since I can't seem to find it on my folder.<br>Thank you anon, you have splendid taste.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck talks like this? Jesus</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  All the threads are the same. All. The. Threads. Just where did we go so wrong?  <br>It doesn't matter how important it actually is, all that matters is perception.</br>  <br>50% of her face is eyes. Why is this allowed?</br>  <br> but that doesn't make source material any less important. <br>The way KyoAni's chosen to adapt it does, however.</br></br>  <br>HTH, /a/non</br>  <br> Mikino <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Some people like to argue rather than post pictures of they're waifu. It can't be helped, Anonymous.</br>  <br>In the novel during that scene his smile makes her feel at ease and calms her down, then after staring at him for a while she notices and then steps on his foot out of anger. <br><br>That's the scene where she'll look at him like a boy before getting defensive. Though in the anime I do think they are gong to replace foot step for something else.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say it's that subtle - There's just very little of it.<br><br><br>They're basically  generals , so they were doomed from the get-go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naw, that's not gay, it's just Cool Biz.</br>  <br>By following the story 99% faithfully and adding a couple more fanservice scenes that amount to nothing?</br>  Kind of weird they left the percussions for the last ep.  <br><br>Episode 8 - 9 has some. Also the fact that Kumiko really took to heart Shuichi's comment about her is already a big hint.</br></br>  <br> Sakai literally failing bashing two things together <br>And some people say she's best.</br></br>  <br>Because it's anime, and a KyoAni show at that. If you want realistic faces go to /tv/ or watch something like that rotoscoped show from a couple years ago.  I already forgot its name </br>  <br>They're saving best girl for last. <br>I think they may have been going in order. Drums are way in the back of band.</br></br>  <br>I can't think of a single scene between Shuu and Kumiko that has been remotely similar to one they had in the novels since he asked her to go to the festival in episode 8. And even that was pretty different. You're in an uphill battle if you're basing your argument on "it happened in the novels".</br>  <br>Certain Kyoani fans have been in to homolust for a while now, and everybody on /a/ is autistic. <br><br>Fuck, we have an anon here arguing that a scene cut meant something other than inserting humor into his AoTS.</br></br></br>  <br> following the story 99% faithfully </br>  <br>Percussions don't participate in tuning. They tune their own way.</br>  <br> There's nothing gay about the fanart at all, really. <br>Imminent Kumiko gangrape confirmed, the fanart on pixiv has spoken.</br></br>  <br>What major plot points were changed?</br>  <br> those boobs <br>WHEN WILL THOSE MONKEYS STOP?</br></br>  <br>A couple. But I see no reason to spoonfeed your goalpost-moving request.</br>  <br>Maybe they'll just put Taki-sensei as conductor for the last ep since percussion instruments are shit and irrelevant.</br>  <br>pedophilia is illegal now, it can't be helped</br>  Kyoanus obviously left Kumiko x Shuichi hints as vague and open for interpretation, this is probably to bait people on Kumiko x Reina and make it seem credible. But we know at this point that it's all bait and so we disregard it. Now what's left are Kumiko x Shuichi hints. They can always say look 'she likes him all along' and those scenes were supposed to be interpreted this way.  <br> feet  touching when</br>  <br>I have faith in the Yamada. Ep 13 will be great and it would suck because that's the last thing we'll get.</br>  <br>So you're talking out of your ass and have no argument.<br>Alright, shitposter.</br></br>  <br>The point is I don't have to prove anything to you when you run your mouth about some 99% nonsense when you obviously don't know what the fuck your talking about.<br>And you call me the fucking shitposter?</br></br>  <br>I don't expect a yuri bait scene like the episode 11 one in the last episode exactly because Yamada is directing it.<br><br>She handled Midori in Tamako pretty tastefully, I would be disappointed if she resorted to cheap fanservice this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Novelfag here.<br>If anyone is wondering why Asuka has those hints of darkness:<br> Her mother is abusing Asuka. She tries to force her to quit the band and focus on studies. Bitch even hits her in presence of Taki when she says that she is not going to quit the band. Her genki attitude is just a mask and music a way of escaping from her shitty life  </br></br></br>  <br> Spoiler <br>What a great lady.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty obvious Asuka has good reasons for being obsessed, but man those are some unpleasant reasons.</br>  <br>Yup. She might be the only sane person still in KyoAni. But I really want a new original movie by her.</br>  <br><br>   Her mother is abusing Asuka <br><br> t-the sexual abuse kind? </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm calling you a shitposter because all you're doing is posting epic reaction images and refusing to clarify on any points you're trying to imply.<br><br>So yes, you're a shitposter.<br><br>All the major plot points in anime and in the novel are exactly the same. Some scenes were changed and made open for interpretation, but it doesn't affect the story itself. All the major events that happen in novel also happen in the anime.<br><br>Do you want me to write you a synopsis of this show so far, in case you're just a shitposter who isn't even watching it and just posting in these threads?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bitch deserves it for not listening.</br>  <br><br>Goddamn shit's getting real. Season 3 please kyoni. No wonder her room is shit.</br></br>  <br>And people doubted that she's best girl.</br>  <br>Not directing it, but storyboarding it.</br>  <br>The eyecatches were pretty much in score order, although flutes are usually before clarinets and horns before trombones. Maybe they score it differently in Japan?</br>  <br>Didn't she direct an early episode though? As well as helped with episode 8.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>That's good right? As she storyboarded any other episodes.</br>  <br>All I know is that she storyboarded episodes 1 and 4 and directed episode 1.</br>  Why does kyoani hate the gays  <br>Episode one was pretty good. it introduced all the characters. That scene where Kumiko recognized Reina was hilarious and the Kumiko and Shuuichi scene was cute.</br>  <br><br>They don't. They actually love them since they're good marketing material.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you hate gays ?</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Those episodes were the most accurate following the novel. I have faith in Yamada.</br>  <br>Fine. Since you're obviously begging at this point, I'll spoonfeed you. <br><br> All the major plot points in anime and in the novel are exactly the same.  <br>You see, this is you moving goalposts. Major plot points != 99% the same as the fucking novel. If you made an anime about a girl name Kumiko who plays euphonium in a brass band, then you're not changing the major plot points. never mind the fact that you can add things like her also knowing magic and owning a talking familiar. The main plot points still haven't changed.<br><br> Some scenes were made open for interpretation <br>What the fuck does this even mean. This is how I know you're full of shit. Creating new scenes from scratch isn't leaving things for interpretation. Cutting scenes entirely isn't leaving things for interpretation. Changing personalities isn't leaving things for interpretation. <br><br> but it doesn't affect the story itself.  <br>The story itself doesn't matter. It's your ridiculous claim that you know how much of the show is accurate to the source when you fucking don't. You just don't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't that episode 1 disregard Shuchi's apology and made Kumiko fixated on Reina?</br></br>  <br>Yuri subtext is good for all cause waifu fans like it so they can see the girls in different almost romantic situations to see how they react still staying safe that they might be into them too, and yuri fans take it as granted.<br><br>While yuri canon means the girls aren't into waifu otaku and prefer girls for real which alienates big part of the male audience.<br>It's similair in western media(comics, games, movies), bisexual girls are welcomed, lesbians are not, cause they don't make good joke characters like gay men, and don't want to do it with guys like bi girls usually always do.<br><br>And as most important reason yuri fans buy too little to matter compared to let say yaoi fangirls.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohh right. So it was her idea to make Kumiko fixated on Reina. Episode 13 is going to have altered scenes isn't it.</br>  <br>I tried to tell you she was best girl, but would you listen?</br>  <br><br>I want to buy her stuff and also a proper bed.</br></br>  <br>In my point of view i get TWO waifus for the price of one and angsty smelly underachiever emo male gook teenager</br>  <br> having faith in the biggest yurifag at KyoAni not to add more bait in the last episode <br>You got to be kidding.</br></br>  <br>Why do you hate the straights?</br>  <br>She made Mochizou x Tamako happen. I don't she will do bad yuribait, but still Shuuichi/Kumiko.</br>  <br> Fine. Since you're obviously begging at this point, I'll spoonfeed you.  <br>I wasn't begging, I was giving you the chance to prove you're not just a shitposter. If I needed spoonfeeding I would not have written the last line of that post.<br><br> Major plot points != 99% the same as the fucking novel. <br>Yes it does, you fucking retard. That's the whole crux of the argument. Literally not even the most faithful adaptation in the world is 99% the same, it was a colloquial term that nothing major has changed.<br><br> What the fuck does this even mean. <br>The storyline and character relations are the same.<br>Kumiko and Shuichi have a strained but close relationship. Hazuki falls in love with Shuichi and goes on date with him but he rejects her. Shuichi asks Kumiko but instead she goes with Reina, and the two become close friends. Hazuki talks to Kumiko about her feelings for Shuichi and denial over them. Reina is chosen for the solo which causes drama and the second audition, where Reina keeps the solo. The drama regarding the solo gives Kumiko more insight into Reina's character and she finds out about her love for Taki-Sensei. Kumiko talks to Taki-Sensei and thinks about Reina's determination and it makes her realize she loves playing the euphonium.<br><br>All the major stuff stayed completely the same. The stuff that was changed was just fluff. Kumiko's feelings for Shuichi are not as obvious. Reina has more presence before the mountain date to build up for it. That sort of stuff. But absolutely nothing major and nothing game changing. Important changes would be stuff like Reina not getting the solo, Shuichi not passing the audition, Haruka not quitting the band, etc.<br><br>There is nothing about this adaptation that implies Kyoani is going for an anime original ending, so there is no reason to disregard source material when discussing the adaptation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hibikes will end next Tuesday   <br> lilies in free <br>Was Gou secretly a lesbian?</br></br>  <br>I want to hold her and tell her everything will be daijoubu.</br>  <br> The person that BTFO /u/ for good in TLS. <br> Yurifag <br>I'm not following anon.

I wanna hagu her and tell everything will be okay.</br></br></br>  I was promised feet, where are my feet?  <br>feetfags = cancer</br>  <br>Midori wasn't a bad character. She loved Tamako as much as Mochi did. But Mochi manned up and confessed. And Tamako always saw Midori as nothing other than a friend and that wasn't going to change. Midori was a perfect girl for a perfect movie.</br>  <br>She'd kick your shinbone and tell you to focus on the music.</br>  <br>No, Haru and Rin were the lesbians.</br>    <br>But was it her idea to make Kumiko fixated on Reina in episode 1?</br>  <br>Yaoi has the same exact issues with canon gay selling like shit (especially compared to subtext) that yuri does.</br>  <br>You obviously haven't read jack shit of the novels and wanted a spoonfed answer to your question of what major plot points had been changed you made in , even though you had just made the thread worse with your lies.<br>Well if you must know, Reina's and the 3rd years' roles in the story are pretty major plot points. They've been changed.<br><br> it was a colloquial term that nothing major has changed. <br>You must have great quads with all that backpedaling. <br><br> The storyline and character relations are the same. <br>That doesn't even answer my question. Some scene being "open for interpretation" means that the characters relations are the same? Fuck you and your inability to answer a question.<br>Also, <br> The character relations are the same. <br>Just stop, man. Stop forever. I will spoonfeed you no more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> series director <br>Maybe</br></br>  Bait or not, I no longer care. I came into this show with no real expectations and yuri goggles on full blast, intent to call any sneeze a sign of gay love. But instead of throwing yuri hints, Hibike threw yuri bricks, and now it's like I've stared at the sun for too long and started seeing the Virgin Mary everywhere. Nevertheless, I'll be damned if I take my yuri goggles off now. Whatever the ending happens to be, I've already decided it's gay as fuck, and I'm completely satisfied with that.  <br> that spoiler about Asuka quitting <br>Please KyoAni, I don't care about yuri or het. Just save her from suffering.</br></br>  <br>why did Clarinet part leader become a slut between the TV and BD version?</br>  <br> Well if you must know, Reina's and the 3rd years' roles in the story are pretty major plot points. They've been changed. <br>So that's what you're going with? There are major plot changes from the novels because Reina fell in love with Taki-Sensei in middle school but not earlier? That the wrong third years were the baddies? Those are important, plot changing events that make you disregard source material?<br><br> You must have great quads with all that backpedaling.  <br>There was no backpedaling. You are genuinely autistic if you took the "99%" line literally. It's a fucking colloquial term, and your entire argument is based on arguing semantics.<br><br> Some scene being "open for interpretation" means that the characters relations are the same?  <br>Yes. Relations between Kumiko and Reina and Kumiko and Shuichi in the novels and in the anime are only made slightly more ambiguous, they were not drastically changed. Shuichi likes Kumiko. Kumiko is unaware of her feelings for Shuichi. Reina and Kumiko have a close emotional bond, idolize and support each other. Reina madly loves Taki-Sensei and is protective of him.<br><br> I will spoonfeed you no more. <br>That's a shame, because I really wanted to hear more about these lies I posted. I'm sure you could prove everything I've written as wrong, but alas, refuting arguments is spoonfeeding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How will KyoAni even adapt the second and third novel. The third years are suppose to be the villains in the second novel. Since they were the ones that made the try hards quit, which is the reason why Nozomi (flute girl) and Asuka dislike each other. Asuka doesn't want Nozomi back in the band because it would cause drama with Mizore.</br>  <br>It's a fake spoiler, you retard.<br>If it was a real spoiler it would have been accompanied by a page from the novel and its translation.</br></br>  <br>Easy. They wont.</br>  <br>It's fake but Asuka deserves a little suffering at this point.</br>  <br>They have to though, its important to the story, they can't just skip to the third novel.</br>  <br> No wonder her room is shit. <br>When have we seen Asukas room</br></br>  <br> People who speak normal <br>Kumiko (originally lived in Tokyo)<br>Mizore (visits family in Kantou often)<br>Taki sensei <br>Mamiko (see Kumiko)<br>and maybe some other adults<br><br> people woh speak in Kansai ben <br>Every other person<br><br>Also hearing Reina be "special" in Kansai-ben takes away a lot of the impact.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think anon's point is S2 never.</br>  <br>Then what is the deal with Asuka in the third novel.</br>  <br>It's not. Here is the part where is Asuka is hit by her mother. I'm not going to translate it because you apparently know better</br>  <br>How did they live in Tokyo, Kumiko's childhood was with Shuuichi.</br>  Is anyone translating the LN?  <br> inb4 novel </br>  <br>I had a good laugh imagining Reina as some naive country bumpkin proudly proclaiming "me wonna be speshul, yes me do." Combine it with that desire to fuck a father figure of hers and she comes across as quite the pathetic hillbilly girl.</br>  <br> she speaks kansai-ben, so she must be some country simpleton <br>Tokyo pls.</br></br>  <br>I didn't think it was possible to think of her as even more adorable than I already do.</br>  <br>It can't be helped, Anonymous.</br>  <br><br>Hope Taki-sensei scolds her mother or comforts Asuka.</br></br>  <br>Reina's character is only important in the 1st novel for Kumiko's development. by the time the second novel begins Kumiko's focus will be on Mizore. Its basically Kumiko helping a character from each grade. Reina (first year), Mizore (second year), Asuka ( third year). That doesn't mean that Reina isn't Kumiko's friend. They become best friends but Reina's character becomes a little one dimensional by the second novel and not as important (Only Taki centric scenes is where she's important.) Shuuichi is a side character in the second novel. <br><br>The anime made Reina more important than they should of, and the third year roles are pretty important, since the plot for it is ongoing throughout the whole novels.</br></br></br>  <br> comforts Asuka </br>  <br> The third years are suppose to be the villains in the second novel. <br>the past third years are still the villains in both versions. The 2nd years only ignored the first years because the third years made them. The past third years were the ones who made them quit. Nozomi explains it right here. And neither of them are the villains in the second novel because Asuka does that for them.<br><br> Since they were the ones that made the try hards quit, which is the reason why Nozomi (flute girl) and Asuka dislike each other. <br>No, the drama between these two doesnt have anything to do with the third years who are never brought up again. Nozomi doesn't hate Asuka but she's pissed off that Asuka called her chickenshit for leaving the club when she could've waited for the past third years to graduate. Asuka doesn't hate Nozomi either but refuses to let her back in for petty reasons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In a not lewd kind of way obviously.</br></br>  <br>Maybe not too far into her childhood. Maybe she moved to Uji when she was 5 or something.</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>great, everyone will understand this here</br>  <br>From what I've read, during the first half of the second volume of the novel, Kumiko gets over being Reina's "follower" and wants to become special herself, on her own, and be an equal to Reina. Right?<br><br>They already implied this to be happening in the episode 12, with that conversation they had when Kumiko was practicing out.</br></br></br>  <br> Taking pride in not being able to speak properly <br>Pls.</br></br>  <br>A different anon from the guy who posted the spoilers originally, but there's actually two scenes where Asuka's mother hits Asuka in front of him. The first time he's shocked and tells her there's no need for that, the second time he punches her in the face and says "If you don't like being hit, maybe you should keep your hands off your daughter."</br>  <br>Wait seriously? Thanks for the clarification.</br>  <br> petty reasons <br>She's a quitter. <br>I wouldn't let them in halfway through the year either.</br></br></br>  <br><br> he punches her in the face and says "If you don't like being hit, maybe you should keep your hands off your daughter." <br><br>I don't believe you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kek</br>  <br>She moved from Tokyo to Kyoto when she was either 8 or 10.</br>  <br>Isn't Nozomi suppose to be the best flute player?</br>  <br>8 seriously? So their grade school friends.</br>  <br>I've read the novel I can confirm this.</br>  <br>I'd rather imagine Reina speaking like a princess.</br>  <br>You forgot the part where Taki takes Asuka under his wings after making her mother commit suicide.</br>  <br><br>I thought 13 years old was the cut off for osananajimi?</br></br>  I just want pictures of Kumiko being lewd with her euphonium.  <br>Yes Nozomi is the best flute player, but they only have one Oboe. And if they get Nozomi back, Mizore might go insane.</br>  <br> gokigenyou <br> desu wa <br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure, the patron saint of losers and talentless hacks.</br></br>  <br>She is the patron saint of girls suffering domestic abuse.</br>  OHOHOHOHOHO<br><br>UFOTABLE PLEASES FANS FOR MONEY</br></br>  VNbabbies BTFO<br><br>GOATfutable does it again</br></br>  Rin is old and busted.

Shirou shouts from the base of the Edelfelt mansion. <br> Noticing Shirou's exclamation, Luvia starts walking down the stairs leading from her bedroom to the front door. She is wearing nothing but a purple bra and matching panties, which are hardly purposed to cover anything. <br> "Luvia, I'm never going to get home in time to feed Saber if you walk that slowly..." Shirou responds, oblivious to the musky scent Luvia has been magically spreading throughout the house for the past thirty minutes, or the private Jazz band providing saucy music from the base of the steps. <br> "Shirou... Don't you think you can forget about Saber for the night?" Luvia whispers into Shirou's ear. At this point, Luvia's hands are exploring all around Shirou's body. <br> "I hardly think I could forget about her, she's the reason my grocery bill is always so high." Shirou casually responds. <br> Luvia bends down to greet Shirou's unroused member, perhaps his other mind will greet me with more passion? <br> As Luvia is about to unsheathe the bone of Emiya's sword, her target starts walking away. <br> Shirou has found himself a spot on the couch, and started to read a cooking magazine that happened to be lying around. <br> Luvia heaves a sigh, and follows the boy, sitting down on the same couch and leaning on the boy. <br> Noticing Luvia's giant breasts asserting their presence, Shirou pays Luvia the attention she is hunting for. <br> "Oh, did you want to read this article? I'm sorry, I shouldn't have just started thumbing through your things in your own house." Shirou apologizes, a genuine smile upon his face. <br> Luvia flashes a very small, near unnoticeable signal to her head maid, who promptly drops an ice cream cone on Shirou <br> Luvia gasps, and with an "Oh no! Here, let my maid take care of your clothes, you can wash up in my bathroom," Shirou finds himself sitting in a giant bath with Luvia. <br> The two of them are naked. <br> Shirou asks <br> "Do you like fish or squid more? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   epilogue is all original material that has just about absolutely nothing at all to do with the plot of the show <br> it's better than every other episode of UBW's second season <br>Bravo Nasu.</br></br>  FINNISH PRIDE FUGG :DD  <br> Prisma is for lolicons they said <br>I watch it for Sella.</br></br>  <br>luvia confirmed tuskarr confirmed<br> but if she is, how did she lose a 1v1 manfight to a &gt;grill </br></br>  Subs out    <br>s-sauce?</br>  <br>Is her titties really 4x the size of Saber's titties?
