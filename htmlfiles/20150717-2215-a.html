Then the daily wait began.  If the mangaka never draws any porn of this, it will be a crime.  <br>One can only imagine what kind of cute/sexy sound she made at that moment.</br>  <br> 93-chapter <br> each chapter is a page <br> 93 pages <br>Not much of a binge.<br><br><br>He already draws plenty of porn though, this one is him getting his vanilla fix.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you insert yourself into that panel </br>  <br><br>As which one though? Tomo or Misuzu</br></br>  <br>Dat sex hair</br>  <br>Tomo. Both sides have their charm though, now that I'm considering.</br>  We haven't seen Misuzu's love interest for awhile. I wonder if he's gonna try something schemey in here too, cause otherwise he's kind of a pointless charachter.  <br>Hence why I could actually bring myself to get through that many chapters in such a short time. No way do I have the dedication to do 100 chapters in a day of a manga with 20+ page chapters.</br>  <br>Oh wow. I thought his art looked familiar.</br>  <br> That tussled hair <br><br>I can't contain this boner, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He also did the one about the tall tomboy and the American girl</br></br>  I wish we'd gotten more of this.  <br>So many tomboys to explore.</br>  <br><br>Oh god I just want to fuck Misuzu till its painful.</br></br>  <br>OOGA BOOGA Where da hatefuck doujins at?</br>  <br><br>I'm always happy to see good doujin artists getting real work. He is getting paid for this right?</br></br>  <br><br>I have no idea. It's not serialized in a magazine or anything, but maybe? I can't imagine he'd do a chapter a day with no recompense</br></br>  <br>That one was too cute to fap to</br>  <br>I believe it's just a 4koma he puts up on a website. Free aside from probably donations.</br>  <br>Fuck, that was this artist? How did I not put two and two together.<br><br>The best is the imouto one with the tender hours long love making..</br></br></br>  <br>Too bad she was the only one of the three friends that didn't go through suffering. Chiyuri's put a stupid grin on my face, Mayu's was sweet but sad, and Ameri's just made me frown.</br>  <br>Possibly ad-revenue as well. Its on a popular enough site to have a weird Fate Mahjong doujin on it.<br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/comics/twi4/f<wbr>atemahjong/0019.html<br><br><br>That one was cute too. Except for the part where the imouto was raped horribly off screen.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Why is my arm numb?  <br>You slept on it?</br>  <br>Tomo's character design fires on all of my fetishes.<br> Tomboy <br> Medium length hair <br> dress down <br> fang <br> spats </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Jun the only entertaining boy? The other two seem kinda flat.  <br>Yanagida Fumita really is a great artist.</br>  I didn't think this would be true when I first started reading, but Tomo is actually third best girl.<br><br> Misuzu <br> Blondie <br> Tomo <br><br>Sorry Tomo, but you can't argue with those tits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tits over character <br> Tomo is already stacked <br><br>You silly nigger it's Tomo -&gt; Misuzu -&gt; Blondie.</br></br></br></br>  Is anyone else using ameboide's webcomic reader extension? Seems like it stopped working for bato.to since a few days ago. Won't preload previous or next pages on any mango page  Now Misuzu will try to provoke Tomo to start flirting with Misaki-senpai.  <br>tomo is based and you are wrong</br>  <br>noOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Trips don't lie, Misuzu's reverse psychology NTR keikaku has begun.</br>  <br>Well, I'd certainly be worried if they were busty.</br>  <br>Ok.</br>  <br> Dat sex hair <br>Nice</br></br>  MISUZU<br>I<br>S<br>U<br>Z<br>U</br></br></br></br></br>  Jesus where are the doujins?  Several seconds in MS paint.  <br><br>Damn Misuzu looks good after being roughed up a bit.</br></br>  <br><br>My god I want fuck the smug out of her<br>IT's so damn sexy and so damn madding</br></br></br>  <br>Is there some unwritten rule that artists don't do doujin's of their original work? The only one I can think of is the Unbalance x Unbalance guy but hes Korean scum.</br>  <br>And by doujin's I mean actual porn.</br>  <br><br>Three hundred years in paint</br></br>  <br>I want to make a mess of her!</br>  <br>Some brave soul needs to draw in blush, sweat, and those breath clouds what indicate heavy breathing.</br>  <br>It gives me trouble regularly in batoto. But I hate batoto normal interface, so I just never go there anymore. <br>Kissmanga for me.</br></br>  What are the chances of this getting serialized somewhere? It seems like something that could be made into an anime.  <br><br>My body couldn't handle it. I wonder if she'd get violent with you, she's shown no signs of actually being violent so far. I'm not sure she would, but I still want her to be mean to me.</br></br>  I need to know, what doujin has the smugest anime girl imaginable?  <br>Not violent, but pushy. Need some fanart of her pulling on a guy's necktie.</br>  <br> that disheveled hair  <br> that strand of hair in her mouth <br>Hold me back niggas. My dick cant take it no more</br></br></br>  I fear the day when we get beach chapters.<br> Tanned Tomo-chan. <br>I don't think my dick and body can take it.</br></br>    <br>im bettig they will follow Jun and see them doing locks and shit</br>  <br> Mizusu in a   white one piece swimsuit </br>    <br><br>I want her to tie me up with a neck tie.</br></br>  <br><br>Anon don't. DON'T<br><br>Someone fucking help me here</br></br></br></br>  <br>My flag stands at full mast.</br>  <br><br>Sweet jesus</br></br>  <br>Add on a 4chan logo and save it for the next time we get new banners.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, this is the third time I've ever had the urge to violently ravage a character,</br>  <br><br>I need to stop browsing these threads at work. Now I can't stand up for the next 20 minutes.</br></br>  <br>If she has abs I swear to Christ.</br>  <br>We should colour it and make the hand grabbing her green.</br>    <br>HNNNNNNNG!</br>   ryona when?   <br>Stop right there you criminal SCUM</br>  <br>Hopefully very soon. There's not enough  ryona  in this world.</br>  <br><br><br><br> sex hair Misuzu </br></br></br></br>  <br>has someone done mayonegg yet?</br>  <br>Evil genius<br><br>I love it</br></br></br>  <br> If she has abs <br>Looks like she does.</br></br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br> dat hair <br> dat everything <br><br>Misuzu is sex</br></br></br></br>  Misuzu is a miracle of the universe  why cant girls like this exist? Fuck!<br><br>Well at least this is gonna get an anime and start a tomboy trend and thats gonna prevent me from killing myself.<br><br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br>  sip  fuck off haruhi  fucking slut  fuck you  <br>Fuck you, leather man. You're not the boss of this gym.</br>  Post more Haruhi  <br>I want to comfort her.</br>  fucking waifu  <br> that scaling <br>terrible</br></br>  <br>You start</br>  <br>You tryin' ta say sumtin?</br>  Post sip  Have you pledged your loyalty to Papa Bones?  <br>Why would I pledge allegiance to the immoral evil characters? Impure scum.</br>  <br>This is Evil. Evil is Good.</br>  Can we all agree this show is the spookiest of the season?  *Have you pledged your loayalty to Skeletor  <br>I cant wait for skeletor and his spooky minions to wreck shit next episode.</br>   papa bones will never :D me <br>Why even live?</br>  Oh my god they are going to die so fucking badly.  So other than fuckhueg dragon what do people think future plot points are gonna be<br><br>I'll go first<br><br>Leaders of Zuranon use   the creation of an undead ruled nation   to strike against The Empire and Kingdom throwing the continent into chaos</br></br></br></br>  <br>I am honestly surprised that there are good characters under Papa Bones. I would assume that the good characters get along less well than with the evil characters.</br>  http://skythewood.blogspot.sg/2015/<wbr>07/AO1.html</wbr>  I pledged my allegiance to her.  <br>The only "good" NPC are Alpha and Sebas and even Sebas who has the highest "good" alignment will do whatever the fuck anyone tells him so long as it furthers Ainz.<br><br>Sebas doesn't even really seem to dislike any of the majorly evil characters.</br></br></br>  I have joined the Gravelord covenant  How do lich's breed?  So I am not sure why /a/ hate this so much. The "hur dur trapped in a gaem" is stale but it looks like he is going to be alone and the focus is shifting away from the game aspects and more towards being trapped in fantasy land. <br><br>Am I missing something or am I taking shitposting too seriously?  or am I just blinded by the skelly MC </br></br>  <br>Whose this semen demon</br>  <br>A retarded maid</br>  <br>He doesn't like demiurge, the guy who skins and tortures people.</br>  <br> So I am not sure why /a/ hate this so much. <br>That's news to me. Bar a few shitposters, I'd have sworn it had been received if not positively then neutrally. Especially after episode 2.</br></br>  <br>Everyone hates Demi which they should</br>  I'm scared guys<br>the first episode was great like log horizon season 1 and the second was as bad as any from log horizon season 2. I really want this to be good.</br>  <br>I kept seeing that is was the worst anime this season. I find that hard to be true when GOD EATER is airing.</br>  <br>see file name</br>  <br><br>What are you talking about? The whole scene with Ainz flying to the moon was good and also Albedo scenes were great.</br></br>  <br>Of course he would, however Sebas is less likely to cause unnecessary destruction and murder unlike the evil cast. Sebas and Cocytus are less likely to enslave you, while the rest of the guardians would probably have no qualms about it.</br>  <br>People jacking off to how great the mc is and the mc being the nicest guy ever doesnt make an episode good. That's all they did in ep 2.</br>  <br> implying Ainz isn't the biggest dick OG </br>  <br>Where? Just ignore them. Most of them just heard "MMORPG and didn't bother taking a second look.</br>  <br>They are his servants, they cant do anything BUT drool for him. I agree it doesnt excuse a whole episode of drooling over the MC though.</br>  <br>If you didn't get that it was the whole point of those scenes, you probably weren't paying attention. Momonga finding out how they see him means he HAS to keep up the act in front of them even if he didn't want. That should bring out a bit of the "conflict" people like you seem to be looking for.</br>  Is Dio going to be He-Man?  So after checking around the web, the general consensus is about 85% positive. Most people are really just wondering where the series is going. And Albedo is currently the best girl.  EEEY EEEY E<br><br>Im liking the opening too much.</br></br>  <br>I mean when I saw that it was another MMO game it turned me off too, but I am enjoying it so far. <br><br><br>I am hoping that it avoids any other "real world" people and trying to explain why the MC ended up here and instead focuses on them trying to take over the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am hoping that it avoids any other "real world" people and trying to explain why the MC ended up here and instead focuses on them trying to take over the world. <br>Well you're in luck my friend. Keep watching.</br></br>  <br>I thought this was going to be full on comedy. Kind of disappointed that it turned out to be SAO#29321948. I mean, it's better than SAO so far, but this setting is getting really tiresome by now.<br><br>Dark elf onee-san a best girl.</br></br></br>  <br> Dark elf onee-san a best girl. <br>which one?</br></br>  <br>What are the similarities with SAO?</br>  <br>The trap's sister.</br>  <br>Bestus Girlus. A rather rare species in the wild.</br>  <br><br>The MC is dickless, just like Kirito.</br></br>  Narbel? More like Narbest.  <br>He may not have a dick but at least he has a spine</br>  <br> guy stuck in a MMORPG <br>Come on, I'm not trying to say they're similar shows. I'm just saying this setting is getting overused. Even Danmachi sort of does the same thing but with dungeon crawlers instead of MMORPGs, except there's no real world in Danmachi, though there might as well be since everything in their world works like a game.</br></br>  <br>But anon, he  has a boner ohohohohohohhooh skull joke </br>  <br>lel</br>  <br>All D&amp;D nerds know that create dick is a 5th lvl spell so he can most likely use Greater Dragon Dick at max lvl so no worries.</br>  <br>Anybody have webm of papa bones laughing in a spooky manner in the OP?.</br>  <br>fyi this is not Ainz.</br>  I really wish the <br> how can Albedo have sex with Ainz if he has no peenus weenus? <br>meme would die</br></br>  <br>&lt;3</br>  <br> casts Albedo Breaker </br>  <br>Is that Blue Rose</br>  <br><br>Yes, thank you Mr Whales number one porn star.</br></br>  <br>I believe so, yes</br>  <br> meme <br>That is a legitimate question, you fucking redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>To be fair you could say the same thing about every slice of life harem out there.<br>It may be because weve gotten used to everything being a slice of life harem but at least the mmorpg shows are kinda new, even if there is one every season.</br></br>  <br>yeah but hearing it 100+ times get's real old.</br>  <br> that is a legitimate question <br>no its fucking not it's a silly joke that gets spammed, and the fact that it get's repeated nearly a dozen times EVERY thread, makes it a meme you fucking moron<br> you fucking redditfag. <br>don't reflect please</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you answer it though?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> At least they fuck before one of them dies. </br>  <br>Do.</br>  So no new chapter this week, instead we get a random crossover with a series nobody reads?  <br>At least Overlord does it in a fresh way<br><br>10 minutes of mmo and then no more screens no more levels hell   the new worlders aren't even aware of the concept of levels and the character sheets for them are just reflections of their skills as opposed to gaining skills from leveling </br></br></br>  <br> _________read the LN__________ </br>  <br> Wish Upon A Star - a Super Rank spell - can give him a penis or artificial human body at any time </br>  <br><br>We are still expecting a new release this Saturday, calm down anon.</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry to tell you but Dio is   a mook  </br>  <br>still says saturday. So unless Sky changes it, should be the same.</br>  I know this would be the Oregairu of the season. I shouldn't have expected any different from you guys. Worst fanbase this season. All that talk only making threads when you have an update on your LN and have something to talk about are all lies.  Post yfw someone tells you they can't wait for Ainz to be a hero and save the world.  La Shub Niggurath when?  <br>Suuuuuure buddy. Keep thinking those happy thoughts.</br>  <br> no new IP number <br>who do you think you're kidding?</br></br>  I want to marry shizu  <br>But Ainz is the greatest hero the world has ever seen whether they like it or not.</br>    <br>Who are you kidding? There is a new IP. Stop lying to yourself.</br>  <br> Worst fanbase this season. <br><br>You came to the wrong neighbourhood motherfucker.</br></br></br>  So the guardians know they were created, but do they know how long ago it actually was? Mare said she was only 70 some years old, but is that from her character setting?  <br><br>What are you talking about, this a novel about happy magicalgirls.</br></br>  <br>Their creation date is probably not their birth date. Like, they joined Nazarick at a certain age, rather than being born into it.</br>  So who would be the best Guardian to live under? Going by personality, it'd probably go like this.<br><br>Sebas=&gt;Cocytus&gt;Pandora Actor&gt;Dark Elf Twins&gt;Albedo&gt;Shalltear&gt;Demiurge<br><br>Didn't include the other two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Papa Bones needs to impregnate Mare and Aura ASAP</br>  <br>they're too young for that.</br>  <br><br>only one of them is a girl</br></br>  <br> Cocytus in second place <br>He unconsciously releases a freezing aura. You will become an ice block.</br></br>  <br>depends on if you are a monster or not<br><br>If you are a heartless monster Demiurge is bro as fuck, just look at how happy the clown is.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see what the problem is</br>  <br> At least Overlord does it in a fresh way <br>This.<br><br>It's unusual already to have the main character being a wizard rather than a magic swordsman, let alone a fucking lich.<br><br>That already sets this show apart from all similar ones.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> too young <br><br><br>They're both girls if you will it hard enough</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think most people are misguided<br><br>i remember reading some comments on IGN abot how overlord is gonna be another story about a Hero saving people.<br>I love how wrong they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's already been shown he has complete control over that.</br>  <br>He can control that. Plus, he treats the Lizard people he subjugated well. If it was Demiurge, they'd all be in slave camps and experimented on.</br>  <br>You mean like Log Horizon?</br>  <br/>  <br>I love what people think of Demi so far. It ranges from "this guy is up to something" to "he seems like a nice guy".</br>  <br>He's also been shown to be a forgetful person<br><br><br> he treats the Lizard people he subjugated well <br>After first slaughtering them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course we lie. Why would you think anyone of us would admit this is turning into a general? I mean you have better chances at making us go outside rather than making us say our way of spending free time is bad.</br>  <br>Nah it's more<br> This is guy is definitely up to something <br>and<br> He seems like a pretty cool bro* <br><br> *heteromorphic races only, filthy human need not apply </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's too overtly smart to be blindly loyal like the rest.</br>  <br>I wonder how far they will got with Demis "subtly" in the anime.</br>  <br> draw a boy and a girl <br> call them a girl and a boy <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br> japan </br>  <br>Shut up you bitch. Overlord is fucking amazing and so different than that fucking log shit.</br>  <br>Will MC remain as a lich and never turn back into a human?</br>  Isn't making generals while saying you're not making generals pretty much the standard modus operandi on /a/? <br><br> When did we get to be so schizophrenic? </br></br>  Next episode should be  heart crushing  right?  <br>I wish people would stop comparing Overlord to SAO and LogH<br><br>To be clear this is a legit fantasy world ala 90's fantasy series, yes it starts with an mmo but that gets dropped like a bad habit. <br><br>Hell at one point a character tries to stab out someone else's eyes and into their brain to kill them instantly because just like in the real world that shit is lethal. It isn't game style "you struck their weak point for massive damage" it's real world "you cut open an artery either they get healing magic or they will bleed out within a minute"<br><br>Ainz and co. just get to obfuscate the fact since they are horrible monstrosities that ignore most forms of damage that don't target their natural weakness.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>A general is like a forced continuation of the previous thread. If the previous managed to hit bump limit, and there was still enough discussion/posting to warrant another thread, then I think it's fine.</br>  <br>Than I see no point in making it a try from an MMO anyway unless it actually uses those mechanics later which would make if like LH.</br>  <br>People trying to find something to shitpost isnt new on /a/.</br>  <br>These aren't generals, anon. I am the OP of last thread and I only linked to the other thread to prove a point.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>A general is when you linked the previous thread for no fucking reason which you guys happily do in the previous threads.</br>  <br>Yes, he did slaughter them. All the guardians would. However he was merciful to them. If it was anyone else sides him or Sebas, the lizards would be slaves. As a ruler, Cocytus is much, much better choice than all the evil guardians.</br>  <br>Get out of my head Charles.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the threads which go on nonstop for weeks, one after the other, where people just won't admit they're having a general. That's pretty much how it seems to work with a lot of anime these days.</br>  <br>Read the novels to see why it really DID have to be an MMORPG setting at the very beginning.</br>  Whoa, stop fighting guys<br><br>We are supposed to be comfy, papa bones would be upset</br></br>  Just done episode watching episode 2<br>Its still slow pace and kinda tiring to keep up with all the info dumps but at least the scene where he flies into the sky and rips off his helmet was majestic as fuck. anyone got a webm of flying scene? </br>  <br>Go back to /v/ you fucking moron. Generals are always a no no on /a/.</br>  <br>He's overly full of himself.<br><br>He's shown he's willing to go against Ainz for the sake of protecting/pleasing Ainz in the long run but at times it feels like a lot of his little plans work on the principle "as long as Ainz doesn't find out he'll be happy with my end result".<br><br>For all we talk of loyalty he goes behind Ainz the most over really dumb shit.<br><br>He should just stick to his true passion carpentry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just tell why. As I see now they havebno fucking reason unless you think meta jokes are a legit reason.</br>  <br> /djt/ </br>  <br>The mmo is important from a world building standpoint<br><br>Very minor spoilers that aren't even relevant to the plot but just stuff that hasnt been revealed yet<br><br>  Everyone that watched the server get shutdown was transported over appearing once every century or so (at least as far as history knows), these people who are strong as fuck compared to the baseline of the world pretty much fucked the natural course of history doing stuff like introducing their games magic system, leaving behind a bunch of weapons and armour that became relics and weapons that protect humanity against monsters, and stuff like another guild hall appearing far away and years after it was emptied becoming a prosperous city  </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>See  and shut up now.</br>  <br>Faggot, I am last OP and I am TELLING you that I linked it to prove a point.</br>  <br>None of that is required for the sake of telling the story.<br><br>You can replace almost every single instance of "wow isn't like the MMO at all" with "wow this isn't like my old world at all" and nothing changes.<br><br>All the old World Class items? Them being relics from the MMO or them being relics from "ye old fantasy land other dimension" don't matter. The difference between how fucking powerful all of Naz and your baseline bumfucks from this world? The fact that's because they're from the MMO reality of Yggdrasil matters even less because even Ainz at this point just basically treats Yggdrasil as any other weird fantasy land and less like an MMO.<br><br>The only thing you get out of the MMO aspect that cannot be replicated with "Ainz and Naz were high tier final bosses of their old world and now are in a world where things are different and they're even higher tier endgame fuckers" is the whole fish out of water thing Ainz goes through with having to adjust to being an overlord for what was previously a mundane game.<br><br>Even that aspect is shat on because it takes him realistically one volume (ignoring his adventuring side projects) to take up the mantle of Overlord and you stop getting funny moments of "the floor guardians treat seriously what was mundane for Ainz" because as seen in Volume 3 Ainz really soul crushingly loved the game and his friends to the point where it might as well of been real to him.<br><br>I don't hate the MMO aspects at all but there's really nothing about Overlord where the story had to be impossible without the constant references to "WOW THAT'S NOT HOW THAT WORKED IN YGGDRASIL ONLINE".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Draw a pipe <br> Call it not a pipe <br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Those mexicans sure are a funny bunch.</br>  <br>Just like every other general. You don't have to defend it. We all know how much you crossboarders like to make generals.</br>  <br>Okay then kiddo.</br>  <br> All the old World Class items? Them being relics from the MMO or them being relics from "ye old fantasy land other dimension" don't matter. <br>Did you even read the story? The issue isn't only that there were relics from the game. It's the fact that people came along with those relics. Obviously, the author wanted to take people from the "real" world, future Earth to be exact, and bring them to a new fantasy world. Without Yggdrasil, what are the odds that everyone transported would have been conveniently holding items strong enough to game changers in the New World? You'd be sitting there going "No, that's too forced".</br></br>  <br> spoiler <br><br>If you think that's cool, check this out. It's basically a novel-length-length bit of writefaggotry from /tg/ about a similar concept.<br><br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17586304<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17611378<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17632664<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17648894<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17663235<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17670989<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17685424<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17705159<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17717365<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17732681<br>http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.c<wbr>om/archive/17751162<br><br>I've been meaning to pastebin these up for easier access because I thought it'd go down well in Overlord threads, but oh well.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you won't. You could have a world setting exactly like Yggdrasil even without making it an MMO. Making it an MMO is just more convenient and have nothing to do with the story at all. It's just an easy way for the author to introduce something without him having to actually explain more in depth. Log Horizon on the other hand actually uses the MMO setting to its fullest without making it look stupid.</br>  <br> Log Horizon  <br>I see. This is where I get off your ride. Looks like you are just disgruntled that there's another concept like your precious LH.</br></br>  <br>  It's the fact that people came along with those relics. Obviously, the author wanted to take people from the "real" world, future Earth to be exact, and bring them to a new fantasy world. Without Yggdrasil, what are the odds that everyone transported would have been conveniently holding items strong enough to game changers in the New World? <br><br>No it's not. Again you can replace Yggdrasil with any other non MMO fantasy setting and have a bunch of random fucks get dropped into fantasy setting B and it produces the exact same effect. The likelihood of all the beings transported having a World Class item does not change when you replace "only a handful of MMO players had these items" with "only a handful of random fucks from this world had these items". What are the odds that a random Yggdrasil player had a World Class item on them when they got brought over? As much as the above random fuck having a World Class item from separate but equal generic fantasy location. There's absolutely zero difference in the implications behind having those items if you swap where they're from.<br><br>Even the "real" world shit has not mattered. What sweeping technological advancements and ways of thinking were brought over from people in the real world you played an MMO who then got transported that you couldn't achieve by cutting the MMO middleman? The creation of a fucking rubik's cube that's what. <br><br>World Class items, other "players", the differences between the two worlds, and all that other shit. The need to have a separate world from which to pour all that into this one yes. But it doesn't have to be an MMO.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I love how wrong they are. <br>B-but Momon is hero, that saves people.</br></br>  Look children. TITS!  <br>It isn't even a different concept. Overlord literally uses its MMO setting because it's just convenient and the author doesn't need to come up stuff on his own.</br>  <br>Oh but it's not forced that every single implied player transported over was a max level world class player who happened to have a world class item on them?</br>  <br>I guess we'll just agree to disagree then because I still think Yggdrasil was the best way to get people into the new world. The author obviously wanted to go that route. I don't see any reason to complain about how he wrote his story, I just enjoy it.</br>  <br>Nah it's not hate, just dislike of each others views. Same how Yuri and Shalltear don't get along.</br>  Look at the tits children. Jingle jingle jingle  <br> Log Horizon on the other hand actually uses the MMO setting to its fullest without making it look stupid. <br>muh space vampires<br>muh shitty secondary annoying and boring as hell child characters taking up 5 episodes discovering the power of friendship</br></br></br>  <br>And it doesn't make you wonder just how that happened? At all?<br><br>Alright then.</br></br></br>  <br> agree to disagree <br> I just enjoy it. <br><br>I refuted your points about why it having the MMO element is vital to the story's structure and you can't give a single reason why but yeah let's just mindlessly enjoy anything thrown at us without criticism we've clearly reached a standstill.</br></br></br></br>  Jingle jingle  <br>You don't like character development? The children episode is one the best episode in that season.</br>  <br><br><br>So we're posting Gorillas and Chairs now?</br></br></br>  <br>I clearly took note of your criticism. Did I go like "Overlord is the most perfect novel ever written and I won't listen to any criticisms about it"? No, I didn't. I said all I wanted to say about why I think it was the best way to go about the story. You disagreed. I saw that there wasn't a chance in hell either of us would change our minds. I said we should agree to disagree. If you're looking for someone to argue with, find someone else. I don't want to.</br>  <br> wanting character development on child characters <br> going around being by the book morally righteous kids singing songs and finding the power inside themselves <br>it was like I was watching a paladin summer camp complete with camp fire songs and other bullshit<br>it was boring as all hell</br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>I don't see Shitoge anywhere in this thread</br>  <br>No, because you run into the fact that there's no real reason to experiment when trasnporting the deziens of one fantasy world to another.</br>    I like how the authors are actually friends. I would rather see their TRPG getting animated than that shitty Chaos Dragon.  <br>Who else would sentimentally stay online for the last minutes of the server's life when most people had moved on to some other game? It's a broken P2W game, obviously the payfags and turbo autists are going to be the ones that care enough as opposed to some lvl 50 scrub trying out an old forgotten MMO.</br>  <br>Overlord was written before LH and if anything they're both ripping off SAO.<br><br>Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>It looks like victim is giving the viewer bedroom eyes.<br>I-Im not sure how I feel about that...</br></br>  <br> they're both ripping off SAO <br>yeah because the dot//hack series doesnt exist right you fucking idiot?</br></br>  Why is narberal so useless?  <br>The concept of LH was even before Overlord. Stop kidding yourself.</br>  <br> Oh, we developed this standard Fantasy setting just so that we could rip characters out of it into a new fantasy setting. <br><br>That's a fucking terrible idea. You lose the entire connection of Ainz's rapidly eroding humanity and the connection he has to the NPCs because his friends designed all of them.<br><br>Your entire argument is basically: How to ruin everything but the most basic level of Overlord - The Post.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Momonga-sama is a hero to those that matter.</br>  Let's say you were maxed level/max gear and were transported at the same time as Papa Times<br><br>What would you be doing with your new Demi-Godhood.</br></br>  <br>He's my hero</br>  <br>Read a chinese LN forums, they mentioned Overlord's author is friends with Altina's author and LH's author as well. Not sure if there's any truth to it.<br><br>By the way, in the OverlordxAltina crossover by Maruyama, Momonga lost against Regis in a game of chess.</br></br></br>  <br>Adventurer's guild. Live the high life.</br>  <br>He'll save the world by imposing order on the chaos of freedom.</br>  <br>A jew?</br>  <br>make him feel bad that all his friends left him</br>  Just finished volume 3. Man, I wonder how they'll do the fight. It probably won't go into Shalltear and Ainz's POVs. That bit was really neat.<br><br>Also, is Overlord published as a light novel or novel? It uses more descriptions and prose than I normally see in LNs. And I saw that it appeared in the "Novel" sections of the Oricon sales.</br></br>    <br><br>Please, they are all cheap Tron knockoffs.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like they need a hug</br>  <br> Find Nazarick <br> Set an appointment with Papa Bones <br> Offer up my rarest WCI in exchange for Narberal's hand in marriage <br> Make dozens of doppelganger children </br></br></br></br>  <br> Be on the look out for heroes lead by a dragon that wants to kill off all players to keep the world safe. </br>  <br>novel.</br>  <br> implying tron didn't rip off dos </br>  I'm going to post this every thread till I stop finding it funny.  <br>Adopt a bunch of orphans and start training them as warriors or whatever. Build a cult/sect.</br>  <br> I'm just saying this setting is getting overused. <br>yeah but that is the nature of the industry</br></br>  <br>its a light novel buts is the same price as a novel. Totatlly worth it because of so-bin's art.</br>  <br> Oh we've created a standard game setting to just rip those characters out into a completely different fantasy setting and then go "wow this isn't anything like the game at all how wacky" <br><br>Human turning into Lich and changing his way of thinking becoming less and less human over time? Novel idea. Does it have to fucking be an MMO lich for any reason whatsoever? Nope.<br><br>Person being connected to the creations of his friends and willing to do whatever it takes to protect them for the sake of preserving his friends' legacy? Yeah super. Any reason you an MMO to introduce those character? Nope.<br><br>You keep taking concepts from Overlord that are central to the plot and tone of the story and attributing their importance to the MMO aspect when it matters absolutely zero. <br><br>It's not that the MMO aspects and references are inherently bad. I don't really think they deter from shit too much but to say they are a necessary part when half the fucking story is "wow that's not how that worked in the MMO" and the other half is comprised of second person narration from the perspective of beings who have never interacted with the MMO or never treated the game as anything other than reality is silly. <br><br>Removing the MMO doesn't ruin the basic plot because the basic plot of Overlord has nothing to do with the MMO beyond using it as a constant stream of reason why these things are already there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Skull san will meet another player from his Dmmorpg?</br>  <br><br>Most LNs are about 150-250 pages. Overlord averages about 400 pages per volume. Vol 6 being the longest at 450 pages</br></br>    <br>Shut up already you have no argument other than "nuh uh I don't like it this way" and pretty much say major plot points are unncessary<br><br>Wanna know one of the biggest points about mmo being relevant<br><br>The author wrote it this way so you can fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  Well for me. If I ended up getting warped to a magical fantasy land with insane powers and items, I'd got full Innocent Sword.  anyone have the link to the epub?  Is this site working or anyone http://anichart.net/summer it isnt working forme and i wanted to check how long until next episode.<br><br>Alternatively,can someone tell me please?</br></br>  <br> Human turning into Lich and changing his way of thinking becoming less and less human over time? Novel idea. Does it have to fucking be an MMO lich for any reason whatsoever? Nope. <br><br>Are you proposing some kind of 3rd world for Momonga to have been originally transported from or something? Otherwise it simply doesn't work. The entire structure of Nazzarick wouldn't work if Ainz started as a human in a fantasy world. <br><br> Person being connected to the creations of his friends and willing to do whatever it takes to protect them for the sake of preserving his friends' legacy? Yeah super. Any reason you an MMO to introduce those character? Nope. <br>Same thing. If they're just generic fantasy creations of fantasy world people that were friends with this Lich we're starting out with because fantasy world, the whole thing falls apart and you're tossing the reader's connection to it as someone who can sympathize with Ainz's connection into the trash can. <br><br> Removing the MMO doesn't ruin the basic plot because the basic plot of Overlord has nothing to do with the MMO beyond using it as a constant stream of reason why these things are already there. <br><br>The MMO frame and his origin into this new world is a major part of how players start off being and continue sympathizing with Ainz as he gets really fucking evil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Christ you guys. Give it a fucking rest.  <br>Every Tuesday, friendo.</br>  <br><br>It ripped off unix. Actually Tron predates dos given it was in development for a few years.</br></br>  <br>It's just that one guy who obviously believed he could do a better job than the author. I wish he'd just do it and leave the rest of us who just want to enjoy the story in peace.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192465 <br>What is this, a picture for trap elves?</br>  <br>Read LH. They explored and more than Overlord would ever do.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192465 <br> obviousAntGirls.jpg </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192465   <br>If that's blue rose, why is there a man on the left?<br><br>...wait he's wearing boobplate... woman? but she has such a nicely shaved beard...</br></br></br>  <br>She's quite handsome isn't she</br>  <br>Part of what very little humor is in the series comes from the fact that the lich has the mindset of a Japanese salaryman. The entire series wouldn't work without that.</br>  so what's with albedo when her settings don't really have anything that would make her psycho? Did changing the last line fuck everything up?  <br>Yeah I hate discussion too, I wish we could just keep posting waifus and spoonfed newcomers forever.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192465 <br>Narberalfags are just as retarded as she is.</br>  <br>Conquer an entire nation and lead a rebel army around until I get bored and find a waifu.<br><br>Then I settle down as the rightful king of a small swathe of land.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128192465 <br>What is this, a gorilla, a chair, and a dumb shit for ants?</br>  <br> so what's with albedo when her settings don't really have anything that would make her psycho? <br>how do you know? Did YOU read all of ther settings?</br></br>  <br><br>You probably could rewrite the story to be about some sort of godlike beings who randomly show up in some other world and do some crazy shit, but you'd also probably end up with a rather different story.<br><br>I think there a few big reasons why they may have chosen this, <br><br>Aside from the simple fact that the mmo thing is popular, it plays on the whole wish fulfillment thing of a normal person gaining power, women, living in a virtual/fantasy world instead of their own. A lot of the target demographic has probably thought something along the lines of "I wish I could live in my games/books/whatever" at least once in their lives, it doesn't even have to be an mmo.<br><br>By having the main character be a relatable normal person mentally and an outsider to the world he is in, you have a convenient and easy way to handle exposition without it being really fucking jarring. The MC is basically just as confused as the viewer and will try to figure things out whereas a godlike Skeletor is pretty much in his endgame and there would be no real reason for him and his minions to just start randomly explaining things. It would just be really weird because they would already know exactly what they were doing. We'd also likely lose our view into the MC's mind if that were the case. Also the true nature of the MC might influence his behavior.<br><br>Overall, I don't really mind if it ends up being an actual plot point or if it's just a regular old plot device to keep things easy. I'll let the rest of it carry it along. Like I said, you probably could change the story but it would likely change not only the plot but how it is told and presented to us.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Start metagaming. And fuck with people because you are so fucking overpowered.</br>  <br>Thankyou. Is the site working for you?</br>  <br>Albedo  was a cruel and manipulative bitch before Ainz edited her, according to what someone got from her profile in episode 1. Now, she's a cruel and manipulative stalker.  </br>  <br>His hands have been bugging me for a while and I finally figured out why. His metacarpal bones are practically nonexistent except for on his thumb. Either that, or his other fingers are missing a set of phalanges.</br>  <br>Well i read that too and the only thing i could tell from it was the fact that she's evil to the core and her smile's a poker face. But still don't get why she would start acting like a psychopath as the story goes on</br>  <br>Can someone post Albedos' character sheet?</br>  <br>Just say what would you be doing if you got transported to LH because that's what you basically mean anyway.</br>  <br>Well, I think it's officially considered a light novel; but most stores will make you go to the "real novel" section to buy Overlord.</br>  <br>I guess they don't give enough aa fuck to animate a skeleton hand without CG. At least So-bin illustrations seem to get it right.</br>  <br>It's a full on novel, people just consider it a light novel because of its web novel roots and the fact that the it's the writer's first real published work.</br>  <br><br><br>Nope, guess it's busted.</br></br></br>  <br>She gets to cut loose more and more as the plot rolls on; she was always that fucking crazy and evil but didn't have an excuse to express herself.</br>  <br>Overlord is making people on /a/ read a actual book. Truly evil at its finest.</br>  <br>I want to fuck his boypussy.</br>  <br>Of course the Overlordfag would think this. Oh god you guys can't be this dumb.</br>  <br>its considered a light novel but is double the price of a ln<br><br>what a rip off</br></br></br>  <br>they're nice books though, so I don't mind.</br>  <br>Well she was written to be a bitch or something like that but the MC did a tl;dr over most of her profile and just changed the end. The love thing is now a fact but at least some of her old personality likely carried over somewhere in there. Who knows what the rest is like</br>  <br>You imply anyone here is actually supporting the author.</br>  <br>So-Based's artwork is also worth the double price. Hope he'll release an artbook someday.</br>  <br>hey fuck you buddy. I bought a few of the books.</br>  <br>pics or it didn't happen</br>  <br> Double the length of typical LN <br> Better art than typical LN because based So-bin <br> Ripoff <br><br>What the hell are you talking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I chalk that up as a time/budget constraint. Either that or they just made the distal phalanges longer so it can make his hands look more malevolent.</br>  <br>It's also double the size of an ln. Because it's not an ln, it's just an n.</br>  <br>Not everyone can be Kawakami, anon.</br>  <br>Are you implying that the artwork actually gives this the right to be double the price of a LN. Fuck no. There's a lot more things that have better art that isn't scamming people into buying it.</br>  <br>that "bitch" part is supposed to erotic not personality bitch</br>  The second episode wasn't as bad as the first, but it's still bad. If it ever picks up the pace it might not be bad, but right now it's a 2/10 show  Yeesh, shitposters are making this thread unbearable. Is selling a novel at a novel's price a reason to shit up a thread now?  <br>I have a  bone  to pick with you, anon.</br>  <br>I was the one waaaay back who was scanning the novels for TL anons. Don't have a camera though.</br>  <br>Hi welcome to midweek threads for pretty much any show ever</br>  <br>It just perplexes me how they don't realize Evil always finds a way.</br>  <br>it's literally twice the size of a regular LN anon. I don't know why you're fighting this.</br>  <br>Try me fucker.</br>  Well, these threads were cozy for a good while anyway.<br><br>See you all on tuesday when there's a reason to be here and the shitposters are gone.</br></br>  <br>Regardless of what it meant, there's still a lot of unknowns about her personality in that stuff he skipped over. We can assume it was basically her whole life story and more though, so you have whatever was in there balanced with that unconditional love that was written in.</br>  <br>So call it a novel. Being twice the size and still calling it a LN is scamming people.</br>  <br> pictureforants.jpg <br>I don't need to, you have already  boned  yourself</br></br>  <br>There was a Altina X Overlord crossover translation released earlier today. Ainz solves the problems of an entire LN series in a chapter.</br>  Any preview out for the next episode?  <br>It IS a fucking novel, only /a/ call it a LN.</br>  <br>yes.  in the LN </br>  <br>It IS called a novel, only /a/ is retarded and keeps spreading the LN misinformation, it is marketed and sold as a regular novel.</br>  Why does 4chan like Skeletons so much?  <br>Because they give us a  boner .</br>  <br>I read that there is information about the world of Papa Bones in the crossover, how much legal is the information?</br>  <br>Because it is the most relatable thing between all of us. <br>We are all Skeletons on the inside.</br></br>  <br>also quite contain info also<br><br>Seems like<br>-Papa bones real world life is full of skyscrapers<br>-An Player warrior can destroy a city in one punch<br>Papa bones and his goddamn mass paralysis man it only took a day to conquer everything</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>here you go</br>  <br>but i already read them anon<br>i just want to see crushing hearts in animated form. Sorry </br></br>    <br>Because there are skeletons inside of us?</br>  <br>You know, there's a big difference between a city and a city wall.</br>  <br>Because Chagama-san was a lady with great taste.</br>  <br><br>Supposedly, it's an officially sanctioned crossover. The information is believable, considering that Ainz comes from the future. <br><br>From his dialogue in both the LN and Episode 2, it's implied that his world has developed to the point it was almost impossible to see the natural night sky. In regards to the strength of a player, Ainz himself is a caster, but is still insanely strong due to being a 100.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i forgot. Sorry, you are free to call me a faggot.</br>  <br> Overlord threads are a constant magnet for skeleton posting <br> Heaps of skelly images I haven't seen in other skeleton threads <br> My skelly game can only get better <br>Thank God for Overlord.</br></br></br></br>  Who's the better leader. Papa Bones or Shiroe? Gonna have to go with Papa Bones on this one.  <br>Aura is the dominant one. Mare is submissive. Chagama didn't get along with her brother. Mare is a parody of how she thinks her relationship with her brother should be.</br>  <br>Shiroe is not a spooky skeleton so i''ll go with Papa Bones.<br><br>Shiroe is still cool though</br></br></br>  <br> Shiroe has better qualities as a leader, but Log Horizon lacks the complete and utter loyalty than everyone in Nazarick has for Ainz, so Ainz wins.</br>  <br>Agreed. Both are pretty good leaders but Papa Bones wins soley for being skeletons and having a better loli</br>  <br>He is more likely to fuck yours instead.</br>  <br>Papa bones, of course.</br>  Something to give some good ol' bones a rattling.<br>http://crossfade.io/#!/zmtnt7j93j</br>  <br> having a better loli <br> insulting Minori or being an absolute retard and meaning Atkatsuki who is a chuuni faggot that ruined S2 and in her 20s <br>Better watch yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Log Horizon has respawn points. Overlord does not.</br>  <br>Shiroe wins for brains and strategic skills. Papa Bones wins for charisma and his ability to engender loyalty from his people. While his brain isn't on the same level as Shiroe, it's not bad at all. so Papa Bones, I guess?</br>  Is there any reason the guild didn't make all their combat NPC Lvl 100 ? The Pleiades is only 50ish, isn't that kind of weak.<br><br>Role playing purpose ? Limitation ?</br></br>  <br>Come at me faggot, Minori is literally shit compared to Shalltear. <br>LITERAL SHIT</br></br>  <br> What does that have to do with Shiroe being a better leader?</br>  <br>The Pleiades were only meant to be a delaying tactic. For that reason, wasting precious levels on them would be countertuitive.</br>  <br>Shiroe can afford to make mistakes, Ainz can't.</br>  <br>I kinda feel for Peroronchino for not being able to enjoy his eroges whenever he realises his sister does loli voice in it.</br>  <br> shalltear <br> loli <br><br>Oh come on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure NPCs created to guard a guild base had a collective level cap of 700. It would be too unfair if you could have as many level 100 NPCs as you want.</br>  <br>Don't pull the "she's like a billion years old so she's not a loli" shit on me. She looks like one therefore she is one.</br>  <br>She is, she's the best kind of loli, eternal loli.</br>  <br>Her body is plenty loli. Though her attitude and speech makes her seem very mature.</br>  <br>There's no saving such terrible taste. For starters Minroi isn't some try hard fake. Another plus for Minori is that Shalltear is a jealous flirt with no charm. <br><br>This guy understands. Shalltear is the is a poor, poor, poor man's Rory in anycase.</br></br></br>  <br>Yon ride, it endeth not.</br>  <br>Well hold on, I wouldn't say that. He may have a good strategic mindset but in terms of intelligence Bones has him beat. No matter how you sugar coat it, he has had over a decade of experience and knowledge compared to Shiroe.<br>So Papa Bones would win by a larger margin than you think.</br></br>  <br>The 700 level cap was for a low-mid tier guild, you can shell out cash for more.</br>  <br>Rory is god tier but don't bring other series into it since that's cheating. Shalltear is meh but Minori is a literal ball of human excrement.</br>  <br>  he has had over a decade of experience and knowledge compared to Shiroe. <br> Shiroe has been playing Elder Tales for eight years.</br></br>  <br>Fucking P2W garbage<br>0/10 Yggdrasil a shit</br></br>  <br>But bones has been playing for 12</br>  <br>Create a Harem of Loli's (Yes, just like Death March).</br>  <br>I've always loved Overlord and the dark humor they throw in them, but this new one I'm not so sure about...<br><br>Also, it'd be cool if they had a undead overlord or an overlord who was another species.</br></br></br>  <br> She looks like one <br>No she doesn't.<br><br><br>I'm not.<br><br><br> Her body is plenty loli. <br>No it isn't.<br><br>There's no way Shalltear looks younger than about 15 and on top of that she's stacked; calling her a loli is bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stacked <br> after she's accused of stuffing her bra because she has small tits in Episode 2 <br>Nigger plz. she's a loli, get over it</br></br></br>  <br>to be fair Yggdrassil was pretty darn pay to win even outside guild improvements and NPC creation. Those gatcha rewards like shooting star are op.</br>  <br>No one should sent Papa Bones into another LN like altina. That didnt take long to conquer everything.</br>  <br>She is though, it's just with her clothes and stuffed bra it's not obvious. Ainz explicitly describes her as such.</br>  Looks like Papa Bones is collecting territories like you would collect bitches. By the time he's done, neither the Kingdom nor the Empire nor the Theocracy will have any land left.  <br> I thought it was just 10 years.<br> Anyways, there isn't such a great difference between 8 years and 12, especially if you consider that Shiroe spent most of those 8 years as a tactician for DTP and random raid groups, while Momonga spent most of those 12 years with a support/CC function, and then he pretty much dicked around in Nazarick without doing shit.</br></br>  <br> Are we sure those that appeared before him were from the same game? Or is this just an assumption. </br>  <br>"Shalltear is a vampire of short stature and a child-like appearance. "<br>She is loli, get over it. Even i had never thought of her as loli until it was pointed out as she acts very very maturely.</br></br>  <br>And Shiroe also make his own kind of wiki about elder tale.</br>  <br>But that is not how Shalltear looks like.</br>  <br>Fair enough the True form is a monster leech.<br>On the side note youd think Peroroncino is lolicon if he keeps running into his sisters voice in games and she mostly does loli roles.</br></br>  <br>Shiroe isn't a leader. He is a strategist. This is one of the points that's actually explored in LH.</br>  <br> Complain about this <br> All of volume 4 is pointless lizardman adventures with short scenes of characters that actually matter doing mundane bullshit sprinkled in </br></br>  <br> 4chan <br>time to leave redditor</br></br>  <br>yeah because that compares to the magic school bus adventures of loli-shiroe and the morons</br>  <br> Level 100 warrior <br> Explode cities by casting fist </br></br>  <br>I don't think I'll ever stop being amazed at how well that fits.</br>  <br>Lizard sex was too much. Overall i was ok with Lizards, but the volume had WAAAAY too little Nazarick.</br>  <br> Tuesday <br> Not Saturday <br> Not Friday night when people make speculahs </br></br></br>  <br>Shiroe is also far more vulnerable to   Platinum Dragon Lord, who has been fighting against players by turning them against each other throughout history , than Ainz would be to the Genius. <br><br>Shiroe depends on the subjective trust of humans too much, whereas Ainz's followers are wholly loyal, and far less likely to be manipulated.</br></br></br>  <br>holy shit that's funny</br>  This is more of a /v/ question but are there any MMO's where I can become my own Papa Bones?  <br>   Platinum Dragon Lord, who has been fighting against players by turning them against each other throughout history <br> So what the fuck is he going to do against Ainz if there are no players around?</br></br>  <br>Just play DnD. Overlord is closer to DnD than any MMO honestly.</br>  <br>It's gives me  boner  whenever anything D&amp;D related appears in Overlord, which is like every other paragraph.</br>  <br>Die.</br>  <br>To be frank I'm not big on MMO's or rather I haven't touched any for over a decade. But I don't think you'll have many choices. I'd suggest instead just looking for a RPG or a mod for an RPG instead.</br>  <br> Platinum Dragon Lord <br><br>OH MAN I BET HE GIVES A LOT OF EXP</br></br></br>  I think I'm humersexual. I find Papa Bones to be very, very handsome.  <br>Die before the might of Nazarick, of course. <br><br>In the past, players always showed up in packs .</br></br></br>  <br>It's the manly chin.</br>  <br>I don't know how to play.  Not that anyone would want to play with me, anyway. ;_; </br>  <br>been reading Altina because of that<br>not a bad descision.</br></br>  <br>What have you been watching. Shiroe trust other people as much as he trut his enemies. He doesn't tell them anything at first. You need to be really close friends with him to let him tell you anything. Shiroe could and would overcome the Platinum Dragon Lord.</br>  <br>Storium</br>  <br>Realize that whatever God is fucking him WAS just fucking with him and saved the best for last so that he could have a futile hope that would be snuffed out</br>  <br>IIE SENPAI<br><br>Ainz is our hero!</br></br></br>  <br>Just do a beginner game on roll20 or find a decent role playing forum. There are a couple and they all kinda suck, so just do roll20. There are a lot of people that feel the same way and roll20 lets you play with them. I'd play with you</br>  <br>I don't even watch the show and typically just lurk for bone puns and 2spooky images</br>  <br>Different anon.<br><br>I guarantee you I could get me and another guy on board for this, maybe a third. I'm also fully willing to anally document all the ins and outs of the helper NPCs.<br><br>The last group we were in fell apart due to missing three sessions in a row and the ledditors went MIA. So we're on the prowl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's what I'm thinking that isn't an mmo. I tried to play a game or two on their and either the GM was retarded or the party was slow as fuck. What a let down.</br>  <br><br><br>I've DMed a number of games of Pathfinder, and have a horrible weakness for giving the players sycophantic NPC minions. One of my campaigns that fell apart was trending towards two of the players building their own armies to settle their rivalry in a really spectacular/climactic way.<br><br>... And, uh, I wouldn't mind trying that again...</br></br></br></br></br>  /tg/ pls  stay   I'm interested in partaking in these DnD adventures. How difficult is it for a complete scrbu like me?  <br><br>I would be interested in this, but I suspect that the timezone I live in would prevent me from playing.</br></br>  <br> post your skype info  so I can roll a qt synthesist summoner<br><br><br>Pathfinder is hard, there are easier systems though.<br><br><br>EST master race</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad they never added weeaboo fightan magic in YGGDRASIL so Gazef is probably the best discipline user we'll meet.</br>  So since that crossover thing revealed a bit about fighter classes from YGGDRASIL it only tantalizes me all the more, I mean being able to shatter castle walls with a single punch? Good golly.  <br> Pathfinder is hard, there are easier systems though. <br><br>Well is not like I wanted to play with any of you guys  ;_; </br></br></br>  When Ravelord Neato will summon army of skeltals?  <br>3.5/Pathfinder would be the closest to the Overlord experience though. The complexity and variety of sources is what leads to shenanigans like Victim in Overlord and Locate City nuke.</br>  <br>3.p MAYBE, but you shouldn't touch 3.5 with a 10 meter pole</br>  <br> nearly any system <br> hard <br> "add the numbers I tell you to and roll the dice I tell you to" <br>I'd really just like people who are good at or at least genuinely interested in roleplaying. My group sort of hinged on two people being in character.<br><br><br>The aforementioned DM anon here, I'm also EST.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pathfinder is hard <br>No it isn't.</br></br>  <br>vol 4<br><br>sadly we wont see it because fucking madhousw</br></br></br>  <br>Literally the only hard anything when it comes to DnD is finding people to play with who aren't complete faggots.</br>  <br>Clearly you've never played with optimizers. Which I suppose is a good thing. I'll have to reign in my friend though.<br><br><br>Says the guy who's already learned it.<br><br>Shit man, THAC0 was easy once you learned it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  hey /tg/ bros<br>is Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine worth checking out?</br>  <br>Vol 4 is a terrible endpoint though. It's 1 season to 3 or 2 seasons to 6.</br>  <br> EST. <br>As I suspected, I'm fucked.<br>NZST (UTC+12) here.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I don't think any tabletop game is hard if there's a person there willing to teach you how to play, which is basically what we are talking about. If you read the core rules(which doesn't take long) you can get a fairly decent grasp on how it works and what to do.</br>  <br>Only fags try to squeeze in all the bullshit they can find from Dragon mags or make up some ridiculous convoluted backstory to justify this and that. Players like that need a good slap from the GM.</br>  <br>Right you are. Author does it 1-3, 4-6, 7-9 with 8 a collection of short stories. If this were 2 cours, volume 6 would be the best place to end it. In 13 episodes though, volume 3's definitely right.</br>  <br> people to play with who aren't complete faggots. <br><br>I just want people to have fun, like in some screencaps I have read. <br><br>Also i'm UTC -6, I'm fucked right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the worst part of trying to play online. I don't have any friends that tabletop and I enjoy it so I'm pretty much forced to and I can count the number of positive experiences I've had on one hand.</br>  DM-kun, post your skype so we can flock to you.  <br><br>Avoid being a minmaxing turdburgler and we'll be fine. No psychic stuff either.<br><br>If interested in this whole pathfinder papa bones rigamarole, send the email an email.</br></br></br></br>  <br>jesus fuck disregard that I'm a faggot just go to this skype<br><br>winterofnations</br></br></br>  I expected this show to be a comedy about skeletons.  Man, I'd totally just start recreating manga and anime arcs where I'm the villain and I pick a group of heroes to defeat if I had this kind of power too.<br><br> Pulling the whole this is only my 2ND form ala Frieza to the band of heroes </br></br>  I want to see Papa Bones, Yorrick and Nito together.  <br>Do I add you as a contact or what?</br>  <br>Yeah, just message me. Usual skype stuff.</br>   the writer is bad for setting it up as an MMO instead of dumping loads of worldbuilding shit on our heads right at the start and giving a plausible reason as to why an evil skeletor suddenly has the soul of a japanese salaryman <br> the only reason I can give for the (barely existent) MMO elements being bad is because other things did it first, as opposed to straight high fantasy which is fresh and new </br>  <br>For what it's worth, the Chaos Dragon anime is only based on the tabletop session. As in it's anime original. I don't know why they did that, but it's fucking dumb.</br>  <br>I thought one of the guild entry requirements was being a productive member of society. Not contributing to smut.<br>I kind of just imagined they were all salarymen, book keepers, and stock brokers.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand how anyone could refuse his logic.</br>  <br>Nito would just sit there looking cool without saying shit. Yorrick would be non-stop yaping about shit. Ainz would be too insecure to interrupt Yorrick and would just nod wile monologing internally.</br>  <br>Those tree hugging elves do. Always going on about them living in a rape culture and shit.</br>    <br>A job's a job. Besides, there are seiyuu that started their careers as hentai voice actresses.</br>  <br>How close to the sessions are they following?<br>urobochi was genderswap, how has that impacted the story?<br><br><br>gotta have some standard. I know Japan has a soft labor market, but they can't just let anyone who works at a lawson or video store in.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Elves are for raping <br><br>Weeell...</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like an interesting idea to me, though I hear Chaos Dragon is bad, how bad are we talking?</br>  <br>Shalltear is a chair, anon, not a loli. Although I can understand how you would get confused.</br>  <br>Is it just me, or is there someone right under Ainz?</br>  <br>Dude, i like Log Horizon and character developement matter but the children episode suck ball. Fuck this crap, i'm not looking LH for newbs, i want some mother fucking action, i want politics and new shit, not the fucking power of friendship. God ....</br>  <br>He is most likley stronger than Ainz, he could threaten the entire tomb.</br>  <br>okay who is that egg head guy wearing a nazi uniform</br>  <br>he will most likely turn an old comrade of ainz against Ainz. Author already has hinted that Albedo's little sister will be the trigger to fuck shit up</br>  <br>Pandora's actor, a doppleganger created by Ainz, that can transform into the the other 40 guildmembers with 80% of the stats, he protects the treasury</br>  <br> 'full on comedy' <br>uh...what led you to believe that. Outside of the highly tropic NPCs, series is mainly MC being a spooklord. Not much comedy (at least not funny to me) in this series</br></br>  <br> novelty-hungry <br>Even in this filth-hole I can't get away from people like this. I should really just kill myself.</br></br>  <br> tfw i laugh at the huggin scene <br> tfw i laugh at the lizard massacre <br> tfw i laught a little girl getting spooked by Papa Bones and getting killed <br><br>A-am i horrible</br></br></br></br></br>  Platinum Dragon King sounds like a dick.<br><br>Like who the fuck lets him decide how the world should go or not?

He wants to make a story without having the burden of making up a real world with it.</br>  <br>Manlets...</br>  <br>Not him, but isn't it common sense to know that all things belong to Papa Bones?</br>  <br>I'm sure in ten years you'll grow out of the edgy faggot phase, child.</br>  <br>2spooky4me</br>  So when is the faggot demiurge going to betray papa bones? This cunt is up to something. I can see it in his eyes    <br>Yep, I'd assume anything he sees is his, after declaring to take over the world, looking forward to some action</br>  <br>I don't like this meme.</br>  <br>Well I'd probably be a fighter/warrior kind of class<br><br>Probably spend some time pretending to be some newbie weakling just to see the reactions as I completely dominate everyone I go against. Maybe try and set myself up as a hero of sorts, fuck with corrupt nobles so they waste their time trying to do anything to me, it's always fun to fuck with corrupt nobles. Eventually I might try and track down Papa Bones and offer to ally myself with Nazarack. I would be a human, so I couldn't join, but hey, having a godly powerful warrior as an ally would be stupid to pass up.</br></br></br>  <br>They touch each others phylaktarium</br>  <br>oh sweet my birthday is going to be spooky</br>    <br>No, I think he's fucking surprised that Big Bad Bones wants to take over the world because it might be entertaining and Demiurge is being constantly surprised at Bones's ambition now, it's not the tomb, it's the entire world and that's thrown him into an amazing spin, remember he's a defender but to go on the offense opens up a fuck of a lot of things, anyhow just my thoughts</br>  <br>Trying too hard.</br>  <br><br>But he has created a world, we just haven't seen it yet.</br></br>  <br> level 10 professional <br><br>why do i imagine him having Nakata's voice</br></br></br>  <br>He just says that it's an "amusing thought" out loud but internally he was like "Yeah right haha..."<br><br>It was just idle chatter wasn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so</br>  <br>Pretty much, just a joke pretty much<br><br> Too bad none of the Guardians understand jokes </br></br></br>  <br><br>me neither</br></br>  <br>It ain't this bad. Now the 5th character of the main cast has been presented, so it will be now interesting.</br>  whens papa bones gonna unleash his army of bone wheels on the unsuspecting new world  <br>Imagine an army of mimics.</br>  <br>Imagine an army of Dopplegangers who turn into TouchMe</br>  I'm only pledging myself to ONE PERSON.  Does Shalltear sleep in a coffin?<br>How bad does sunlight affect her?<br>Basically how cliché of a vampire is she?</br></br>  <br>i imagine tomb of nazarick is just tomb of the giants where every enemy is a red phantom and you get 6 man gank invasions</br>  <br>I'll do you one better.<br>Imagine an army of little girls.  That are all actually mimics and their backpacks are the mouths. <br><br><br>Also is anybody getting geography questions in their captcha now?

I feel a bit for the Millennium Earl. He just wanted his qt 3.14 Noah back</br>  What's wrong with a normal telephone, or even those golem thingys they use for communication.  <br>It's amazing how Hoshino draw expressions. We can immediately tell that's not Allen from that alone.</br>  <br>That looks convenient as fuck for me.</br>  Why is Kubo sabotating every other manga?  YES!<br><br>I thought it was dead, I was so upset. Is it officially off of it's Hiatus?</br></br>  <br>That's because that's actually what she tried to focus on. If i remember there was an an interview where she said the hardest part of drawing Allen was with his facial expressions. To differentiate between his emotions. In that aspect she really earned my respect as a mangaka</br>  <br>Yes, but you only get a chapter every 3 months because I imagine it's hard to fully recover from arthritis</br>  <br> Kubo <br> sabotaging DGM <br>It's impossible</br></br></br>  Hey look, another tournament for Reiji to do nothing in.  <br>I will mind crush you if you keep mind crushing my heart.</br>  <br>Did someone say mind crush?</br>  <br>Most people do want to see him win. They're just pointing out that Crow is more likely to win due to Gon not having much plot involvment and it being Crow's first proper duel.</br>  <br><br>I actually don't want Gon to win. It's Crow's first duel and it would be absolutely stupid if he lost that and Gon had enough time to shine this arc anyway</br></br>  Tomato, you are too cute.

I see a lot of content posted on Ilbe nowadays.</br>  <br>I tought it was their displacement, make up your mind.<br>All of IJN carriers looks flat, unlike the burger ones, they all look super fat and wide.</br></br>  <br>I think you'd have a better idea than me if you know of that place.</br>  When will Nagato stop being a lolicon and give Mutsu whats shes been begging for?  <br>So I assume it's a pro-japanese, Ilbe exclusive phenomenon and that we won't be seeing any kpop idols playing the game anytime soon, right?</br>  <br> I tought it was their displacement, make up your mind. <br>No one has ever said that as far as Shibafu's CVs are concerned. It has always been how many planes they carry.</br></br>  <br>The deck on Ryuujou is perfectly flat, there's no control bridge on top. Displacement was always a fan theory that made no sense since sister ships have different busts. Hangar capacity was something Shibafu confirmed himself. And you're right that burger ships were generally wider; they'll have to get Aoki Ume to draw them.</br>  <br>All the people I know who play Kancolle in real life are Chinks.<br><br>I'd think that despite how people perceive Chinks and Gooks perceive Japanese, there are a lot of people who don't care about it as long as there's cute girls.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm okay with burger ships designed by Aoki Ume.</br>  <br>How about Mutsu become loli</br>  <br>but lolis cant ara~</br>  <br>But the only non-loli romance she wants is for her beloved TTK to romance her rear end.</br>  <br><br>Maybe I mixed them, because it kinda of makes sense since kaga is a little fatter than Akagi irl. Still, it doesnt make it less biased since they carried pretty much around the same amount of aircraft, they either need to buff Akagi or nerf the other, I belive they are not counting Akagi's full reserve.</br></br>  <br>Yes they can.</br>  When will Hibiki get a real kai 2 with good stats?  I want to rub my face against a sweaty Yuubari's armpits and butt.  <br>Dekabrist soon.</br>  <br>RJ?</br>    Yamashiro.  <br>Kaga mai waifu</br>  I wouldn't mind an if remodel for Akitsushima that makes her a repair ship...  Believe in Konishi.  <br>Please no blueprint.</br>  <br>good</br>  <br>What else are we going to do with these medals?</br>  <br>Still shit, if this crap have a Blueprint, I'm gonna scraping.</br>  <br>What's wrong faggot? Don't have 20 medals lying around?</br>  <br>Feed 8 to the cranes, and at least 4 to the inevitable event ship that requires them.</br>    <br>I want to play with those little bumps on her chest.</br>  <br> flat <br><br>Sure, she is a light cruiser.</br></br></br>  <br>I have enough medals for that, but no, I don't want to waste in this shitty Kuma.</br>  <br>She's not flat, are you blind?</br>    Not sure why they replaced Ashigara with Kaga yesterday. <br><br>Maybe she gets something as well.</br></br>  <br>No that's and old drawing that was on the cover of something.</br>  <br>yes and?</br>  No translations today, but I did spend a while tinkering with ffmpeg.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>96971<br>DL of original: http://tinyurl com/ozblyrr</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>It's for promoting the dazzle camo version of her figure, but Shibafu was too lazy to repaint his original drawing so they had to do with the old one.</br>  <br>I just started playing this year</br>    <br>Why is she so perfect</br>  <br> mfw no Kana Asumi ship </br>    <br>It's happening!</br>  <br> tfw no KugiRie ship </br>  <br>Stupid sexy Ooicchi.</br>  This kills the Kitakami.  <br>I'm hoping for that Kugyuu ship.</br>    <br>I love Kitakami's hair.</br>  <br> 4 tsunderes <br> expecting more. </br></br>    We need more sadistic shipgirls  Where is the best place to get Abukuma? I got her twice before, I don't know how but she disappeared from my fleet. I remember I did put a lock on her  <br>I was just reading a book about kamikaze, don't do this to me.</br>    <br>2-5. Got her and Kinu consecutively.</br>  <br>It looks pretty similar to what Abukuma's carrying.</br>    <br>It's the situation that desperate that we need kamikaze fairies?</br>  <br>It's a sign, we'll be fighting Re Kai and we'll need new strategies.</br>    I love it  I really hope that's for midget subs and not actually Kaiten.  <br>They wouldn't dare, right? right?</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind though since tsundere is the cutest dere and she hasn't voiced tsundere girls lately.</br>  I think I should translate something. Still mad that I lost my Abukuma though  <br>Translate the Yamato short story!</br>  I like her.  <br>She speaks funny.</br>    <br>She speaks like sex.</br>  <br>Is kinu worth keeping? Nagara class as a whole seems boring with exception of Abukuma ofcourse</br>  <br>If you want to Kantai collect, then they're worth keeping. If you don't like her, then it's okay.</br>  <br>They're cute and Kinu is kinda rare.<br><br>If you're a statfag then no.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsua is actually a maiden</br>  Why is the pairing tag so short?<br> 225 results </br>  <br>Because nobody cares about Abukuma.<br>Until now maybe.</br></br>  Wo-kyute.

They even go so far as to mention in their discussion that Hennrietta doesn't get them because she had her uterus removed.</br></br>  <br>Anyone remember that scene from lucky star?</br>  <br>I only joined tvtropes recently to obsessively edit the  YuYuYu  page, I wasn't there for the legendary shitstorms of the Lolipocalypse. <br><br>Was Tvtropes fairly popular on /a/ before then?</br></br></br>  <br><br> TIMOTEI TIMOTEI TIMOTEI TIMOTEI TIMOTEI </br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>They do, just not often. It's something not worth mentioning, like pissing or crapping of farting.</br>  <br>Tvtropes was popular everywhere for a while, to the point that it became obnoxious and constantly posted which caused it to grow hated. Also there's just a lot of stupid shit there that sours people on it in general. That said, I think many people weren't around for that and just hate it because everyone else does.</br>   tropes <br/>  <br>I see. Thanks for the history lesson anon.</br>  <br><br>Astute anons will notice that it basically followed the series popularity curve.</br></br>  <br>Maybe that curve applies to more than just shows.</br>  <br><br>Perhaps it does.<br><br>Imagine if we could test it for waifus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seasonal waifus like Hestia sure follow that.</br>  <br>It was stupid. You can't even talk about loli? Seriously? Even Wikipedia lets you talk about loli.<br><br>And what gave Strike Witches a pass when Lotte no Omocha got blocked. People complaining about Lotte obviously never even saw it.</br></br></br>  they are elves, elves don't menstruate they don't have safe days  <br><br>/tg/ pls</br></br>  <br>Oh my fucking god after 10 years I finally understand what was that about.</br>  <br> Even Wikipedia lets you talk about loli <br>Wikipedia doesn't have advertisers who will pull their money if they don't like your content. I'm not saying I agree with the ban, but it's a different situation.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if they didn't bow down to pedos they wouldn't have to have stupidly large "pls donate" ads</br>  <br>Right. If they were that obvious about being biased then the entire point of wikipedia would go out of the window.<br>I'm not talking about lolis either, but about having a sponsor.</br></br>  <br> the entire point of wikipedia <br><br>Isn't the point of wikipedia so autists can argue over inane shit on the talk pages?</br></br></br>  <br> The talk page for products of Microsoft has been locked due to anti-Microsoft sentiments that paint the company and its merchandise in an unfair light. </br>  <br> Why do high school girls in anime never get periods? <br><br>Because they're all sluts who are secretly pregnant</br></br></br>  You know that in an average 12 episode anime in which a story will typically spread a few weeks or even months, you only ever see like 2-3 total hours of most characters lives.<br><br>Just because you don't see it happening doesn't mean it never happens. Odds are its just taken care of in the countless hours of their lives you don't see.</br></br>  <br>How do more elves come into being if they don't menstruate?</br>  <br>What about in times where it should be plot relevant, like in a survive innawoods situation or something?</br>  <br>I swear I've seen a period in anime before</br>  <br> unfair </br>  <br><br>When they are masturbated to, they self-replicate.</br></br>  There was an episode about lina losing her powers over a period.  <br>they do in shojo shit also nice trips</br>  <br>I remember that, didn't she get captured during it?</br>  I can't remember if it was an anime or manga but a girl sat out during pool time and the MC asks why. It was implied that it was that time of the month. God I can't remember at all where it was from.  <br>Haven't visited TVtropes in 18 months. What pages did they get rid of?</br>  <br>Everything the advertisers considered pedo, although I don't recall exactly when.</br>  <br>According to what I´ve read in VN and ero manga, japanese women are always on their safe days.</br>  <br>was asuka just on her period for the course of evangelion?</br>  <br>Yep. There's an episode where she mentions it</br>  Asuka did.  <br>Welp. That explains a lot.</br>  <br>It was a plot-point in Only Yesterday, but that movie is literally in a league of its own.</br>  It's not something you usually mention anyways. Most girls have little to no mood change from it as well, those who have problems from it take birth control.<br><br>There is no need to show it because it isn't really a big deal and it is gross</br></br>  <br>I miss that meme</br>   tropes <br>Fuck off /co/cksuckers</br>  <br>They do.</br>  <br>That and the flashback with her doll really made me feel bad for Usaka</br>  <br>What a fuckin drama queen</br>  Some do.  <br>Because they're not girls. They're pure stereotypical maidens with perfect bodies and defined by only one personality trait so the disgusting regular japanese otaku shut in neet can, who has no hope to ever get a real girl in his life, can masturbate to the idea of these maidens thus warping even more his concept of what sex is or should be thus alienating himself even more to the actual act of getting laid ever.</br>  Reminder why Miki is best:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7Xm<wbr>DYJBZZdc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Is that a normal amount of blood?</br>  No one wants to watch girls on their periods.<br><br><br>Oh god stop.</br></br></br>  <br>More like I'm disgusted by your normalfaggotry.</br>  <br>Of course not. It's an info graphic portraying the cumulative uteral shedding of the average high school over the course of a year.</br>  <br>It wasn't just pedo was it?<br><br>They basically removed everything related to hentai, even stuff that would be ecchi at worst.</br></br></br>  <br>It's baiting at this point. No trolling outside of /b/.</br>  Phone posting so no images. The pilot was most likely Ground JSDF because of the helicopter and gear: UH-1 Huey, Sig P220 pistol and that type 88 helmet. The gas mask I got no idea, but the rest is standard issue for ground force. The other branches don't use the huey  <br>There's a theory about menstruation occurring because of an evolutionary arms race between the fetus (that wants to hog all the mother's resources to itself and has practically weaponized the placenta to do so) and the mother (that wants to share her resources between all her potential children and has turned the endometrium into a testing ground). So as a solution, humans have evolved to go fuck it and just slough off the endometrium. It's not as pants on head silly in a tribal context. Between delayed menarche, pregnancy, and lactational amenorrhea, a woman would only experience menses a dozen or so times.<br><br>For elves to not menstruate, all they need to have is the ability to completely reabsorb the endometrium and to lack a hemochorial placenta. They're fucking elves, so you could even write some shit about them being able to abort at will.<br><br>It's just one of those things that's still not mentioned, same thing with shitting in the woods and wiping your ass with leaves.</br></br></br></br></br>  lucky star ep6  <br>Miki confirmed to be Big Boss</br>   Women bleed disgusting shit from their pussies every month for a week <br> This also affects their mood and emotions <br><br>Fucking disgusting. Why am I even straight?</br></br></br>  Second best girl behind Big Boss.  <br>Post more girls with eyepatches.</br>  <br>Melodramatic girls do. I've known several girls who actively told me when they were having their periods for no apparent reason other than "I'm not sorry for anything I've done, I get a free pass so fuck you". I feel like a standard tsundere would make a big deal about it, see Asuka.</br>  <br> Why me?! Why me?! <br>It's the same for almost all girls before menopause, you stupid useless bitch. Get used to it, cause you're in for at least 40 years of it.<br>Jeez, you've just reminded me why I hate almost all of Eva's characters.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember her being this brown.</br>  So what's the chances of us actually getting a Triad Primus debut this season?  post more kaede  Petting Nao's bush.<br>Sending Karen to hospice care.<br>Ignoring Rin.</br></br>  <br>Pretty high actually, especially if they are doing a mini time skip.</br>  <br>about as good as StepmotherP kicking Dookie into Main Red Dramtic event horizon</br>  <br>You're are a rude.</br>  <br>good enough. I can't wait to see Nao and her antics. Fluffy nerd idol is cutest idol</br>   I can’t tell you what is happening with Cinderella Girls, but I do know that hopefully it’ll be done.

They are swimming in shopping money from their various sugar daddies.</br></br>  <br>Stop it.</br>  <br>Karen has to pay for her hospital bills somehow.</br>  <br>Japan has universal health coverage like every other first world nation.</br>  <br>It's not universal, though.</br>  <br> Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance programme administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. For-profit corporations are not allowed to own or operate hospitals. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians. <br><br> This healthcare is provided by both the local and the national governments. Payments for personal medical services are offered through an insurance system called universal healthcare. This system provides equality of access, along with fees that are set by a particular government committee. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, Karen is still done for regardless. It would be hilarious if she dies in the middle of a live. Imagine Rin and Nao running over to her body after she collapses and thinking she just fainted, only to find out she has no heartbeat. Now that would be a show to remember.</br>  <br> anon feels threatened that his idol is no longer pure <br>anon please.</br></br>  <br>Endometriosis isn't going to kill her, anon.</br>    <br>So Nao pleases old men for money?

She's an ugly, hairy nerd with a terrible singing voice.</br>    S2 will end up being more Rin bias and focusing on the forced drama between NG and TP  <br> Ugly is a word better used to describe Nao's face. <br> Nao's face. <br>I believe there was a mistake in your statement.
