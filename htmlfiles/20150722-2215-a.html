[ Here she comes /a/nons. Hope you have enough tissues in Store.  <br>For shed tears?<br>Please explain.</br></br>  A new original anime titled 'Comet Lucifer' has a site up. The site seems to be fairly interesting imo and is scheduled to premiere in Fall 2015. The drawing on the site so far seems to reveal the artwork of a young girl. The anime is original, not based on any source so far.<br><br>Site:<br>http://comet-lucifer.jp/<br><br>Pic unrelated</br></br></br></br></br>  Whoa that site is trippy as fuck<br>Though it is pretty weird to JUST announce it and have it air already next season<br>Title is interesting at least</br></br>  What's the countdown for?  <br>Madoka and Shirobako did the same thing, nothing new to see here.<br><br><br>97 hours left. More details will be unveiled 4 days.</br></br></br></br>  <br>PV release?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4kU<wbr>dNzpdWlw</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2zV<wbr>Qmxaoen8</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7v2<wbr>6qLhkcIA</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kb9<wbr>6PyB8vbg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Animation Production: 8-Bit<br>Production: Bandai Visual</br>  Weird way to reveal this. The site is kind of neat, though.  What pun?  <br>His voice makes me want to kill myself</br>  <br><br>His voice acting is probably killing himself as well.</br></br>  <br>Everyone's voice fucking sucks. Goku's is the worse.<br><br> probably 2+ years until dub <br>Kill me</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gohan's is the worst. He sounds like a fag</br></br>  <br>Goku, Gohan, and Goten are all the same old lady</br>  <br>He has to, or the Japanese fans will threaten Toryiama again because they'll think Gohan is going to start doing anything again, and Japanese fans don't want that.</br>  Do people actually watch Dragon Ball after Dragon Ball?<br>And how do you watch it in Japanese? Everyone sounds like a granny</br>  <br>So, we are going to watch battle of gods again, but on a ship and with more building up and stuff?<br>Well, Í guess I have the "this is my wife" scene to look up to, even if it's going to happen in like a month or so.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, when I realized this is just Battle of Gods: the show I felt pretty deflated about the whole series</br>  <br><br>Why the fuck does he sound bored?</br></br>  <br>Here's a better pun.<br><br><br>He's a really, really old man.<br>He's the worst voice in the show thus far, people who hate goku's voice are mad dubfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people who hate goku's voice are mad dubfags. <br><br>Know, we just know what Goku is SUPPOSED to sound like, and it's not some old granny. I'm so mad they aren't dubbing this first, we deserve it. DBZ is way more popular in America and even the Japanese know Sean Schemmel is a better goku (Nozawa herself said it at a con once) and that we have the better dub. It's pathetic they even bother doing it in jap anymore, it makes my ears bleed its so bad. People think shit like 4Kids is bad? This is 10x worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant no instead of know im just so pissed people actually think we're just angry cuz its different or whatever that I made a typo its true we're angry but because its an OLD LADY not GOKU.</br>  <br>The worst VA performance I've seen ever in anime.<br><br>Even some Z tier anime had better deliverance.<br><br>If he is dying just let him rest in peace, when Kai is running and being angry at Goku while sounding while he is whispering something from 5 meters it is bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are you pulling shit out of your ass?</br></br>  <br>I don't know how people can like the jap dub. Everyone sounds like preschoolers, it's ridiculous.</br>   Every DBS thread <br> WHY DOES EVERYONE SOUND LIKE OLD LADIES <br> DUB WHEN :D </br></br>  <br>Maybe it's a sign that most people would rather it dubbed???</br>  <br><br>Literally never happened.</br></br>  The pun is basically "Peace is nice". Heiwa hei wa  <br> said it at a con once <br>Oh well in that case.<br><br><br>And not knowing what dub means, someone's on a roll today.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a sign that dbs threads are filled with crossboarders.<br>I don't think people from fucking /v/ would complain about the dub because all the games had japanese voices so I don't know where the fuck this people came from.</br></br>  <br>Alright let's go through this step by step<br> I'm so mad they aren't dubbing this first, we deserve it.  <br>When has this ever happened<br> DBZ is way more popular in America <br>Than Japan? That's a good joke m8<br> and even the Japanese know Sean Schemmel is a better goku  <br>That's literally impossible<br> (Nozawa herself said it at a con once <br>No she didn't<br> . It's pathetic they even bother doing it in jap anymore, it makes my ears bleed its so bad.  <br>I am pretty sure most of these complaints are a problem with you and not the home country itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goku, Gohan, and Goten are all the same old lady <br>I do get the point of keeping Goku's VA the same, to show that he is still the same childish character as in Dragonball.<br>But why did they decide it'd be a good idea to use same lady as voice actor for all of his family?</br></br></br>   Beerus says he's the reason dinosaurs went extinct <br> Dragon Ball world is full of dinosaurs <br> Beerus not just blowing up the planet <br>Fuck, I'm mad. It makes no sense.</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe it's a sign that most people would rather it dubbed??? <br> ??? <br>Or maybe its a sign that like 75% of you are casual newfag shitposters who only watched the show as a child and expect everything to go your way.<br><br>Seriously, anybody who says "Hurr why isn't the show being released in English" first deserves to be laughed at</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Dragon Ball world is full of dinosaurs </br>  <br> I don't think people from fucking /v/ would complain about the dub because all the games had japanese voices so I don't know where the fuck this people came from. <br>Do you think they wouldn't listen to the games dubbed if they had the choice because "m-muh heroic Goku"</br></br>   All these newfags forced to watch the original language and it's unknown when Funimation will get it <br><br>And I like the dub these days too. It's just really fun to watch. I hope they don't get it until after it ends like Buu Kai just so I can see the suffering continue</br></br>  <br>There were literally dinosaurs in episode 2. Is Toriyama this senile?</br>  <br><br>lets not forget<br><br> he saw a dinosaur in the previous episode </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Agreed unless you're that fag penguintruth who thinks that Japanese is superior</br></br></br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>It was a totally different planet.</br></br>  <br><br>to be fair, it was on a different planet, not Earth</br></br>  Toiei should've seriously replaced some of the voice actors. A few of them are too old to continue forcing their voices  <br>Do you really think Toriyama is writing the script again?<br>He only gave TOEI the general outline of the story, nothing else.</br></br>  <br>It's really just Kaio. The others sound pretty much as they always have. Kaio is straight up dying though. I don't even know why he's here. Maybe after BoG, he will sit out of the rest of the series since he wasn't in RoF</br>  <br>Goku sounds so bad.</br>  <br><br><br> different planet <br><br>But he made out he barely remembered what dinosaurs were, regardless of where they came from</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Unfortunately, Toei doesn't realise that DB is better at selling outside Japan than inside of it. Obviously its still hyper popular in Japan but the outside market is bigger. <br><br><br> Sean Schmell  <br> good <br><br>The best Goku is the Teamfourstar one. I would love to see them tackle it seriously and create their own shit from it. They are talented as far as voice acting goes, much better than anyone in Funimation. Fuck, even Ocean Groups dub had better voice acting but suffered heavily from underbudgeting which allowed Funimation to get its foot in the door and ruin hundreds of series with their half arsed 'use the same voice' characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only good English dub for Dragon Ball Z is WeeklyTubeShow.  <br> Unfortunately, Toei doesn't realise that DB is better at selling outside Japan than inside of it. Obviously its still hyper popular in Japan but the outside market is bigger. <br>no one cares about gohan in the west either, just you guys</br></br>   Dubshits will never go away   <br>It's not that Teamfourstar are particulary great, they are just better than the shitty Funimation cast.</br>  The Dub isn't even remotely good. Tien still isn't called "Tenshinhan" or Krillin being "Kulilin."  <br>did it ever cross your mind that maybe they're from /a/ and that maybe having a granny voice goku's entire bloodline and an old man on his deathbed voicing kaio isn't such a good idea?</br>  <br>/a/? The people who shame dubfags on sight?</br>  <br> All the games had japanese voices <br><br>But no one actually uses them retard, we don't want granny goku.</br></br></br>  <br>Still better then Granny Goku or little girl Krillin.</br>  <br>Still better than the japanese version<br><br>Doesn't make my ears bleed.</br></br></br>  <br> Tien still isn't called "Tenshinhan" <br>Will and William.<br> Krillin being "Kulilin." <br>I'm fine with that. Kulilin is a pain to actually say.<br><br>Shut the fuck up, holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure it is. If it's so better, why Superman's entire character to Goku? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fmf<wbr>yp_4JpUE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Do you have any reason why Nozawa is not a good VA other than "o-old woman!"<br><br> I am being epic baited aren't I </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a fandub right? This can't be what people are defending, it just can't</br>  <br>Because she sounds like shit? How the fuck else are you suppose to answer this question? <br><br>Goku literally sounds like an old lady whose been smoking all her life.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it's not! <br><br>Sean Schemmel still sounds fresh from the street, Sabat still screams all the time to try and be funny and the only one remotely good is Kaio. The problem isn't the show, It's you people being so ignorant because a company supplied your ignorance with censored garbage like Toonami.</br></br></br></br>  Does anyone else actually really like king kai in the new series? I think his new voice and attitude are perfect for his character. Even when he gets mad you just can't take him seriously and it seems much more natural when he gets no respect from everyone else in the cast.  <br> Not posting links to the updated dub </br>  <br> This dumb, and lighthearted character doesn't sound like a serious, badass, manly man! <br><br>Show me a single woman who sounds like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Nozawa is fine voice actor. She good with kids and even like her in Tamers as Guilmon/Dukemon<br><br>But not Goku. It's bad as Goku. Goku is not child nor granny he should sound like Sean.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and Goku, Gohan, Krillen and Goten <br><br>still sound like shit in the japanese version<br><br>I'm fairly sure people can name more shit voices in the Japanese version than the dub</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, you said "Dub". you didn't specify which. Ocean? Funi? Neo-Funi with Kai?</br></br>  <br>I'd be fine if they didn't animate him freaking out while the VA is calm.</br>  <br><br>He still sounds cringy. He's forcing himself to be all dramatic yet it falls flat. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=75g<wbr>UJ_4SyY0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  I had the same attitude towards Goku's japanese VA until I actually watched the original show in jap. It's painfully obvious that the dubshitters in this thread hasn't  <br>Yeah and old granny Goku is so much better right? <br><br>Haha</br></br></br>  <br>I'm with you brother. I used to hate the idea of JP Goku until I started playing UT with the Japanese voices then went back to watch the series after that. I can't imagine going back to the dub now.</br>  <br><br>That's because people don't watch at all.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xKR<wbr>GZdgtncg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy and sure it might've been a better decision to change Goku's VA after he becomes an adult. but it's better than the entire cast being garbage. Your logic makes zero sense</br>  <br>Funny, I always thought Kid Goku and Gohan had the voice of an old lady whose been smoking all her life in the american dub.<br>I prefer Nozawa's voice for Goku, because at least it keeps the lightheartedness of the character.</br></br>  <br><br>How would Beerus know he extincted the dinosaurs? You really think he has the patience to be so meticulous as to kill them all without blowing up the planet? Fucking BEERUS?</br></br>  Every single time.  <br>She sounds find voicing children and retarded dinosaurs.<br><br>Congrats. She shouldn't voice men in their 30s - 50s.<br><br>You faggots find me a man that sounds like her voice for Goku.<br><br>Voicing Goten and Gohan as kids is fine</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hjv<wbr>e9s90DRU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>You're damn right. She just says it in a simple tone, yet Sean has to sound dramatic to reach a point? Do these people know anything about voice acting?</br></br></br></br>  <br>All he had to do was blast the planet as hard as the asteroid did.</br>  <br> Dramatic scene  <br> Not sounding dramatic <br><br>Okay</br></br></br></br>  <br>The dub is good but I don't cry about muh voices.<br><br>I'm enjoying this show for what it is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not what I mean. you're trying too hard to be dramatic when the scene itself isn't THAT dramatic.</br></br>  <br> still thinks the dinosaurs were made extinct by an asteroid <br><br>Beerus killed a bunch of dinosaurs, went "guess I'm done here," and then took a nap.</br></br></br>  Dragon Ball threads are allowed on /tv/ right? Why do you feel the need to come here?    <br> Saiyan just became the legend of his race and is about to fuck the person who enslaved and killed his entire race <br> Not dramatic </br></br>   Dirty americans can't enjoy Dragon Ball because of the dub <br> The same ones that didn't get Dragon Ball <br> The ones that got DBZ several years later than the rest of the world <br> The ones that censored Mr. Popo <br>TOPPEST KEK<br><br>We all know the Mexican dub is, literally, the best DB dub out there, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying DBS in Japanese because I'm not a dirty burgerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> still thinks the dinosaurs were made extinct by an asteroid <br>Is that not how it happened?</br></br>  <br>The problem is he's overacting in a scene he shouldn't.</br>  <br><br>What exactly do you mean? Find someone who's fit for guys? <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KfJ<wbr>b517Ec2k</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Angemon <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6Qq<wbr>ZCGCOvxA</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Yusuke</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was born with a lisp and his voice being fucked. He even started smoking to make his voice sound different. He also got into fighting because of it.<br><br>So yeah okay bro nice</br></br></br>  <br><br>You should really read up on dinosaurs, anon. The asteroid theory is all but debunked at this point.</br></br>  <br><br>You are really this stupid, are you? how do you fail to see the words "Trying too hard"?</br></br>  <br> Posting Yusuke <br>Dub was better here too</br></br>  <br><br> Dub was better here too  <br><br>Yeah, you people really do have shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't trying hard at all.<br><br>Hell go compare the scene when Goku does SSJ3 or the fight between him and Vegeta.<br><br>She should stick to voicing children.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br>There was no one specific cause. There was a whole lotta shit going on around the time they were dying off.</br>  I have to say I havent been impressed with any of the animation at all so far.  <br>Yeah, seems modern, but low budget. Embarrassing really.</br>  <br> Wasn't trying hard at all. <br><br>Listen to the part where he says "Pure of heart and awakened by fury." and tell me, with a straight face, how that's not trying so hard?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and so was Goku, your point?</br>  I don't get how ppl can defend the jap dub. it's pure shit.  <br>Kaiō’s pun — 平和がへいわー (heiwa ga hei waa) — set in the standard structure of “X is X” using homophones, roughly means “hooray, peace!”<br><br>Japanese puns are dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>No dude, seriously fuck off to whatever shithole you came from. These threads are nothing but cancer</br>  <br><br>They're only dumb because you weren't born Japanese and because Kaio's jokes are also not funny.</br></br>  First Majin Buu Kai and now this. What happened to US getting DBZ before Japan? That used to be the day.  <br><br>Hey, I'm from /v/, and I'm not here to bullshit you I'd prefer a dub since those voices are what I grew up with, but within like two episodes I learned to like the japanese version for what it is. Grandma Goku sounds weird but that's not too bad or something.<br><br>King Kai is fucking shit though. Don't defend it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seek help.</br>  <br>No he wasn't</br>  <br>Nah they're dumb period.</br>  <br>That's true enough. Kaio's puns are meant to be corny and unfunny, even by Japanese standards. Really, most of the time puns are used for the same effect in American cartoons. Here's lookin' at you, Carlos.</br>  <br>No, it's a cultural thing.<br>Old people like shitty puns, they need to be really bad to make an old man laugh.</br></br>  In all honestly, how can anyone like the Japanese version? Not even defending the eng dub but its just so fucking bad. One of the worst sounding anime out there.  <br>Because muh Japanese is superior to everything weeb logic.</br>  GT &gt; super <br>Ssj4 &gt; ssjgssjgssjgssj<br>Li Shenron &gt; Beerus, Freezer and other villains without a background story<br>Mustache Vegeta &gt; effeminate Vegeta throwing his pride away by dancing at a party<br>Mustache Krillin &gt; 3"11 dressed as a kid Krillin</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because Kaio's jokes are dumb, you imbecile. I just told you that.</br></br>  <br>Japanese Beerus sounds better than his English counterpart.</br>  <br> How can anyone like things I don't like? </br>  <br>Nah bro they're just dumb</br>  <br>It's better than the dub, which doesn't take much at all</br>  <br><br>How about you fuck off then. wasting bandwidth on shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Nah it's not bro</br>  <br><br>It's "weeaboo" to watch the original form and have a preference?

There's no discussion to be had here, it's just retarded children shitflinging.  <br>He's voiced by spike spiegel, of course he would sound better than the english.</br>  Please tell me DBS covers more than the fucking retelling of the movies.  <br>Didn't someone revive the dinosaurs pre-dragonball?<br><br>Please correct me if I'm wrong but I think it was through science.</br></br></br>  <br>It does. <br>Universe 6 arc.</br></br>  <br>Then Resurrection F and then a new arc in which they go to universe 6.</br>   literally 3 filler episodes in a row   <br>He says he wiped them out on Earth. For fucks sake, quit trying to discredit Toriyama at every turn. It's like you people want a champion to fall.</br>  <br>He acts like he doesn't know what dinosaurs are</br>  <br> hur dur I don't know what "filler" means. <br>Did you expect Goku and Beerus to duke it out in the first episode? It's called exposition.<br> <br>He remembers the knes from Earth. Maybe, he never ate the ones on Earth. That was what that scene was about: trying dinosaur meat, not seeing a dino fof the first time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're not reading the subs you're a summerfag</br>  holy fuck, king kai's voice actor is 83 years old. he is practically dying in the recording booth  <br>Android 16 it's Terminator T-800 from Terminator 2 Judgment Day<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jER<wbr>4qZtz91w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I didn't realize you were America, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Britain, Italy, Spain, Russian, Africa, Germany and every other Western Country I forgot.<br>Oh and the other Eastern Countries that Aren't Japan.</br></br>    <br>I like King Kai's current Japanese voice. It is nice. His English voice sucks. Not to keep that toxic "sub vs dub" shitfest going, but I like the dub more. Beerus' voice is better in Japanese, though, and Piccolo and Vegeta's are pretty even in both.</br>  Daily reminder that DB will never have a pass the torch to the next generation deal will always be the adventures of Goku and how he saved the world.  <br><br>The voice for Goku is literally an old woman. It's kinda fucking hilarious.<br><br>I'm used to it though since I've watched DB and DBZ in Japanese plenty of times. <br><br>Also am I the only one who really hates DBZ fillers?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nozawa is only 4 years younger than him. It's not so much a problem of age as it is of illness. Before the show premiered I was sad that he might not be able to do the show at al, but now he's doing it, but he doesn't even sound like himself anymore, and it just takes me out of the show. Even dubfags notice he isn't in good health. It's a shame, he's one of my favorite actors in the original but all his voice does is make me sad and worried now...</br>  <br>As it has been since it started. I am glad, too. I don't want to see an "adventures of pan and uub", I want to see what we have always seen: Goku fighting stronger and stranger enemies with his friends and family. <br><br>Also, fuck uub. He was boring as shit.</br></br></br>  The only characters I feel aren't fit for Nozawa's voice are Bardock and<br>I guess just Bardock, maybe Gohan if I really push it but you could honestly replace Gohan with a cardboard box and I'd probably end up giving more of a shit about the box than I did about Gohan.</br>  So what sub groups for this are not shit?  <br>The best Goku is obviously Tommy Morgenstern  because nostalgia </br>  <br>Kissanime is pretty good. Elspark15 releases a shit one in a few hours, and then a better one the next day. His team translates from Jap to Spanish, and then he translates Spanish to English. It's still pretty good though.</br>  <br> &gt;Also am I the only one who really hates DBZ fillers? <br><br>There's a world of difference between "getting your license" tier fillers and "scream and power up for twenty five minutes" tier fillers.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, Herms says the moonlighters are pretty spot on.</br>  <br>Her voice fits Goten for now. They should have changed Goku's after the timeskip in Dragon Ball though.</br>  <br>to be fair, he never really had a chance to grow<br><br>Dragon Team. Spot on translations, much better than any group out there. http://the-moonlighters.ml/pelican/<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Cool, sounds good</br>  <br><br>In Kaio's case they're not even funny to begin with. Not in the "so bad it's funny" kind of way, just "I get it, he sucks at jokes, please stop" kind of way.</br></br>  I need more femWhis! Whis too.  <br>His English voice isn't even a voice, it's like a shrill. I don't get why people need to make that strain "I'm taking a shit" voice for many characters in the dub. You don't have to like the Japanese voices but is the English really that good of an alternative?</br>  <br>not really, fillerapologistfag</br>  <br><br>I liked the funny shenanigans fillers. I hate the battle fillers.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think any other anime has fillers like DBZ does. Also already into the show I get to see DBZ's infamous fillers so I barely feel like the show's even started at this point. <br><br>I said this in another thread, but their fillers tend to be the characters scaring the shit out of regular people for the billionth time (which has been overdone) or something as ridiculous as Piccolo getting a driver's license.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mexican dub <br> good <br><br><br>"bills"<br>lol</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also I agree with this, I can't tolerate the battle fillers.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you calling filler? Do you know it's an original anime? The manga is just there to promote the anime just the the BoG / RoF shorts.</br>  <br>Filler doesn't just mean "not in the manga".</br>  <br><br>You can still call it filler when you have Vegeta shopping with Bulma at the mall for an episode.

He doesn't literally have to have the voice of a little kid.<br>Imagine how jarring it would be if he still had his "kid Goku" voice in the dub.

His voice is clearly still child-like.<br><br><br><br> He acts like fucking superman in the dub <br><br>Why is this surprising? <br><br> Sent to Earth via rocket by his parents.

Same backstory for the most part. Scientists or not, they had to have been pretty tech savvy to pull all of that off.</br></br>  <br>Were it really his parents and not Frieza who sent him to earth? I will admit the extreme similarities but let's be fair: Frieza sent him to earth to wipe out all life on it so he can.... sell the planet....<br><br>anyone else thought this was stupid?

He's extremely similar.</br></br>  <br>No, his backstory is extremely similar.<br>His character is completely different.</br></br>  The American dub has always been more savage than the OG Jap version. <br><br>Manly because of the synth metal replacement soundtrack. Falcouner's the man.</br></br>  <br>You haven't watched the Bardock special nor read DB Minus, have you?<br><br><br>Similar backstory doesn't mean similar character/personality.

Good or bad mean jackshit to him. <br>You are strong and I beat you, you live.<br>You are weak and no fun, i kill you.<br><br>He just fights for the lulz, the dub just made him more of a good guy than he really his misrepresenting his character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DB Minus, <br> I just read Jaco the other day actually. What's your point?</br></br>  <br>Why is everyone responding to this obvious bait?</br>  <br>By that same logic, Freeza is the reason the saiyans are extinct.<br>Whoops.</br></br>   TWELVE rock and metal inserts <br>Who thought this was okay?</br>  <br><br>Considering I know jack shit about moon beyond like four words that I've just picked up from hearing over and over again over the years, and I can still tell King Kai sounds like ass  and in a more /m/ example Takaharu in Ninninger was a TERRIBLE actor for the first couple of episodes before he sorta became tolerable  I'd say yeah.<br><br>I mean don't get me wrong I think most people saying subs are infinitely superior to dubs are just retarded dipshits that need to get over themselves but most dubs aren't anything special at the same time. I just don't think they're as godawfully bad as most people make them out to be.<br><br>But either way the fact that you can more easily tell when someone is doing a shitty job when it's in a language you actually know does mean that something in a language you don't know will seem better by default.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goku heart of gold? <br> Goku is just a retard.

Jesus fuck, than god Funimation eventually got their shit together</br>  <br>Is the japanese audio the original japanese audio or does it have the music replaced still? I think I have this on DVD somewhere and wouldn't mind fishing out and watching it again if it were the original audio.</br>  <br>It did, and it was annoying as hell. The BGM in that movie would not stop yelling at me.</br>  <br>I know Arale went back in time, stopped a meteor from hitting Earth, saving the dinosaurs.</br>  <br>The music's hilariously bad, I can see why some people like it.</br>  <br>He's going all out</br>  I'm about as weeaboo as it comes, I taught myself Japanese and even I can agree that the English voices better than the Japanese ones. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy the Japanese voices, and the Japanese dub is still superior overall just based on the OST and writing alone.  <br>I laughed, then cried.</br>  <br>It's taken from a spanish sub. It makes more sense in spanish.<br><br>All of kaiosama's puns are shit though.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish English dub Goku talked a bit more hick-like. It's kind of a huge aspect of his character to be kinda improper.</br>  <br>I am not a dub hater. I freely admit the dub is perfectly fine with Kai and the movies. But that's usually not what people are talking about<br><br><br>He doesn't have to be a direct hick in English but if he threw in some "aint's" in there, it would do wonders</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. Some ain'ts. Some more Yo! or Heya. It doesn't have to be over the op, but Funi plays goku WAY TOO straight.</br>  <br>Here we go:<br>Beerus put a meteor to wipe out the dinos, but Arale stopped it. <br><br>I have reconciled two gags that Toriyama wasn't serious about, but peoole take way too critically.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Arale vs. Beerus when?</br></br>  <br>Lol. Depends on if she was revived after Majin Buu killed everyone. Android 8 was, so you never know. Beerus would win, of course. It'd still be fun to see though. Imagine, she throws gag after gag strong enough to counter his overwhelming power. It'd be classic.</br>  Do you think we will ever see SSGSS Gohan?  <br>If gets his lazy ass up and starts training again.</br>  <br> they killed a lot of the jokes. <br>Like what?

Gohan is old and busted, Goku is and will always be the new hotness</br></br>  <br>Fellow spic, DB dub tried to avoid the lewd jokes, it wasn't until Piccolo arc that they got their shit together.</br>   Dubs debate again <br><br>DBZ: Battle Of Voice Actors (Sean Schemmel and Jason Douglas) Preview<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=87B<wbr>uPWfUgQI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Now fuck off JPN Goku fags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I will not let you destroy my world <br>The speed he says this makes it hilarious to listen to.</br></br>  <br>beerus is much better in jap. Goku's debatable, though I enjoy both.</br>  <br>Sean is a legend</br>  <br>And in the manga he wasn't like that at all either. He's a good guy. Not some chaotic good (which could only be properly argued for during the Cell games).</br>  <br>And that's filler because he isnt punching a bad guy? <br>That is part of the anime.</br></br>  <br>False, Goku clearly shows a moral code (killing for no reason is bad or abusing others is bad), he gets angry when someone is being a dick for no reason, like when Tien broke Yamcha's leg, or when Tao Pai Pai killed the Indian's father and all the shit the RR did so he decided to kill them all instead of just taking the Dragon Balls and fuck off like he originally intended. He is not some amoral retarded character.<br><br>He is naive not retarded, he clearly has his own idea of whats is right or wrong, the only thing that is true is that he lives to become stronger and there is nothing more exiting from him that to fight beings stronger than him and doesn't care for justice unless it involves someone close to him.</br></br></br>  <br> guys guys hear me out. You know those 2 movies we released that made us a lot of money? lets release what will most definitely be a 30+ episode anime that tells the exact same story only slower and with cheaper animation. essentially double fucking dipping. </br>  <br> hey guys, you know that famous comic I made? Let's release it as a cartoon with slow pacing and lots of filler, and animation that ranges from gokd to downright horrible, essentially double dipping. <br><br> hey guys, I know a lot of people haven't seen the new dbz movies, so why don't we make them into a show with a lot of added material befofe moving on to a new topic? </br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>They want to do a story set after RoF, but they can't actually do that on public TV because RoF isn't actually out on home release yet and won't be until October and its quite possible kids have not seen it in when it was in theaters so you risk confusion. And you can't 'just' retell RoF without BoG there too. Plus this gives them a chance to fill in what happened between BoG and RoF.</br>  <br> Toei doesn't realise that DB is better at selling outside Japan than inside of it <br>They probably do realize it. Thing is, Toei has to SHARE the money it makes overseas with distributors and the like, whereas in Japan it keeps all of it</br></br>  How come Doraemon replaced all its old VAs because they'd been doing it for decades and it was about time but Dragon Ball insists on using 84 men who can't even scream?  <br>harbor my deep secret</br>  <br>Doraemon is handled by a competent studio</br>  <br>meant to say 84-yea old men</br>  Post yfw  So if Goku can't sense the presence of dieties...

I only care about Gohan?  <br><br>Good point.

I even prefer to watch series like Cowboy Bebop subbed, which some regard as having a superior dub  it's shit, by the way . I came in on Dragon Ball late. I have no nostalgia bias like most. And the Dragon Ball dubs are empirically, undeniably better on the whole than the original voice actors. Not to say that there aren't some characters that I legitimately enjoy in Japanese, and even on the whole, it's not bad. But the dub just just superior. Might be the only anime for which this is true, too.<br> <br> Also, aside from Gohan's SSJ2 transformation in the Japanese original, Bruce Faulconer composed a more impactful and memorable soundtrack. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It definitely grew on me, but it took a while to get used to that Luffy voice.</br>  <br> the Dragon Ball dubs are empirically, undeniably better on the whole than the original voice actors <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s3N<wbr>_FN1-KqQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>English dubs.

Your puns mean nothing to the names they write for the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was fun.</br>  <br>it's his pun. He even explained them. Just because he fucks up writing Katakana to English doesn't mean that is the literal translation of the name.<br><br>Hell, in the first chapter "Bulma" appears in, Goku tells her "Your name means Bloomers" which doesn't work if her name was in fact "Bulma".<br><br>Marron, Krillin's daughter, has the same NUT naming scheme as "Kurilin". The explanation of these names are all here:<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/vie<wbr>wtopic.php?f=7&amp;t=12853<br><br>I didn't make that shit up.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, that's not too out of character.

But this here's my home so could you not?"</br>  <br> Hell, in the first chapter "Bulma" appears in, Goku tells her "Your name means Bloomers" which doesn't work if her name was in fact "Bulma". <br><br>That's just a heavy rewrite from Viz trying to explain the name pun.<br><br>In the original he just goes "Bulma? That's a weird name."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God damn it viz.<br><br>Well then, I'm sorry.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;"I am the hope of the universe.

Might be the only anime for which this is true, too. <br><br>Objectively wrong because the dub fucks with the script. I'm so fucking sick and tired of people parroting this fucking bullshit.<br><br>DBZ Funimation dub is objectively shit, this is not opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That VA has always been kind of stiff and weird. He only really worked as the narrator in Dragonball.</br>  <br>The rest of the family's names are also puns on underwear: Trunks, Briefs, etc. Her name should be Blooma, it's that simple.</br>  What is everyone's thoughts on the somewhat relaxed pace of the show?<br><br>I personally like it. It's comfy. It also allows the characters like Beerus to be fleshed out more.</br></br>  <br>It's cute.<br>Also, I don't get people who compare it to DB.<br>Sure it was more lighthearted, but the plot progressed with every chapter.

Life is dull for the most part it's fun to get into something over the top and silly like a warrior ascending to some crazy level of strength and triumphing over the evil overlord. Just take it as face value man, its fun just go with it.</br>  <br>The mouth animation looks weird here, it doesnt fit the emotion in the voice. <br>Kind of weird.</br></br>  <br><br> a grandma voice fits a 40 year old male adult <br><br>3/10 you gotta troll harder than that, son.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 40 year old <br>He's 30 at most.

So, Goku is chronologically 42, biologically 34, and logistically 41. Still more than 30.<br><br>Also, I suck with math.

Some random knight could be a level 100 warrior for all he knew.<br><br>Then he picked a level 5 spell, which I agree was still too high, but Ainz is obviously risk averse.</br></br></br>  <br>He had no way of figuring out how strong they were excepting by trying to see what killed them.</br>  <br>No, I don't want our souls to let go.</br>  Grasp Heart is a Save or Die, and a Save and suck.<br>you fail the save and instantly die, but you pass and you take massive damage and are stunned.<br>there's a reason that it's Ainz favorite spell.</br></br>  <br>I want to commit a cirme.</br>  Didn't albedo have a sister?<br><br>I'm talking about the "real"most powerful guardian.<br>The Secret guardian and the MC's personal bodyguard<br><br>You know the one all the other guardians are terrified of</br></br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck this is amazing.<br>This is literally the greatest power fantasy that I've ever experienced.<br>WORSHIP ME</br></br>  <br>Albedo a cute.<br><br>I'm an animefag but want more, is the manga or light novel better?</br></br></br>  <br> sullying the guild staff </br>  <br> rocks a sexy practical armor <br>That's Anime original, her actual armour is extremely bulky and completely conceals her figure.<br><br><br>This studio really keeps letting us down with the adaptation. I mean where was the fear in the faces of the sisters and villages. They were suppose to be literally cowering, while pissing themselves. There faces barely had any expressions.</br></br></br></br></br>  I heard something about martial users what are those?   Albedo's sexy armor that's completely covering her <br>That was nice. REALLY nice.</br>  <br>Guilds only have 700 character levels to make their guardians with, so everybody's pretty much accounted for.</br>  <br>Yeah.<br>But people are not terrified of her because she is strong, but because she was made as a horror. Like, horror movie-kind horror.<br>Momonga says he freaked out first time he saw her.</br></br></br>  <br>Mang, the LN made my imagination go full throttle.<br>I didn't sleep for 2 days just because I enjoyed it that much.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, except Finger of Death is a Fort save. Most SoD or SoS spells are Fort saves which is bad as Fort is usually the highest save a monster will have. Leave the damage dealing to the gish and dumb meatshield.</br>  <br>Basically melee skills.</br>    <br>If you enjoy the anime you will likely enjoy the LNs too. They're very close to the anime but LNs have some more details.</br>  <br>Yeah basically <br>you'll see next episode I'm sure.</br></br>  <br>Rubedo and Nigredo are different characters</br>  <br>MC's personal bodyguard?<br>I don't remember that</br></br>  <br>They're supposedly something that didn't exist in the game. If you're reading 'The New Gate', you can liken it to the 'Arts' from the series. Also martial arts don't use mana they use something else. Ainz is curious about them but they're pointlessly weak.</br>  That knight scene was more brutal than I was expecting from this kind of anime  <br>What kind of anime were you expecting?</br>  <br>Not genuine.</br>  <br>She has 2 sisters, the one with sensory magic that's kept in the prison area on the ice level and the other which hasn't properly been introduced only mentioned. Neither are the most powerful or anything like that. <br>MC doesn't have a personal bodyguard, he has the Guardians and the Maids (Unless you count NPCs he created but PA isn't really a combatant).</br></br>  <br>Most anime kind of cut away at the critical moments, you know? But I guess these guys are hardcore.</br>  <br>Turns out nips hate money Jews<br>Who knew</br></br>  <br>It was toned down compared to the LN, it was done from the Knights perspective and they were seriously scared shitless (The gore and the fact they couldn't even hurt it wasn't the only scary things, everyone killed with the sword becomes a zombie and starts attacking as well). The studio sucks at expressions as well either that or they're trying to make it teen-friendly.</br>  <br><br> Sucks  that she's  dead  hopefully they  bring  her  back .</br></br>  <br>Don't tax evade anon.</br>  <br>Isn't rubedo supposed to be the strongest?</br>  <br><br>Thanks guys, reading the prologue now. Going to try the first part of vol1 ch1 tonight before bed. Cant wait to get off.</br></br>  <br><br>So he is building a country full of these guys?<br>Or at least a country where these techniques are actively taught?</br></br></br>  <br>nah. Albedo is a bit too rapey. But once Aura Bella Fiora, the reverse trap dark elf girl, grows up,she would be worth siring an heir with.</br>  <br>Read volume 1 of the light novels after seeing the first 2 episodes. Thia shit is fucking golden.</br>  <br><br>Well the author certainly gave her death. It's a pity I really liked her rivalry with Albedo. Anyone know if she was brought back after all?</br></br>  <br>She's already 76 though.<br><br>When does puberty happen</br></br></br>  <br>chair forever.</br>  <br>She's 7-8 in relative human terms so maybe another 30-40 years.</br>  <br>Martial Arts did not exist in the game, they only exist in the new world, Nazarick residents have no idea what they are or how they work. Ainz ordered some people to capture martial art users and wants them studied/researched. He wants to see if the arts can increase Nazaricks strength. But basically the arts and their users are too weak by Nazarick standards to have any real value.</br>  <br>Clarify I have no fucking idea what that means.</br>  Reminder that in Japan, Bitch = Slut so in universe canonically Albedo would probably have been polishing everyone's spears.  I heard there's a regular demon lord in this world.<br>If he were to be compared to the Guardians what level would he be? And does he swear loyalty to the overlord?</br>  <br><br> she dislikes humans </br></br>  <br>you wouldnt need to remind anyone if they stopped watching horribly translated funi rips</br>  <br>So what you read part way through volume three then just stopped? Finish it off then you'll have your answer.<br> Ainz can freely revive people (via consumable item (which he has a hundred or more of)) and Nazarick members (Nazarick revival system, cost shitloads of gold). There's also probably revival magic as well.  </br></br>  <br>humans are nothing more than skeletons in hiding</br>  <br>Ainz sits on her, how can you not understand that?</br>  <br><br>You caught me, I literally just finished that chapter before I posted &gt;&gt;  I'll finish the volume tonite.</br></br>   You will never slay these monsters and their eldritch master.     <br> Ainz sits on her, how can you not understand that? <br>Dude how can I? There was no context unless it's a new thing which just means I've been neglecting /a/ a little too much.</br></br>  <br>Who the heck is Rubedo? She's never even mentioned from vol 1-5.</br>  <br>The majority of Nazarick residents dislike/hate/despise or otherwise look down on humans. There's probably multiple factors that contributed to it; their races (except for elf twins none are human or demi-human), Guild rule that only heteromorphic races can join, evil alignment, character setting and finally the fact that while it was still a game humans/demi-humans are probably the main groups that attacked the guild (and died doing so). Anyway they have every right to look down on them, in-game human/demi-humans had inferior stats to heteromorphic races and the guild was a top-tier guild that had one of the best players as a member (Touch Me is a world class player).</br>  <br>in Vol 7 I think</br>  <br> Touch Me is a world class player <br>That name never fails to crack me up. It's as juvenile as a Gnome named Parts with the Private title.</br></br>  <br>Becoming a chair normally results in being sat on. Get up to date with the latest LN translations. Also lurk more, fanart of the exact scene has been posted multiple times.<br><br><br>She did though, although it was brief and her name wasn't said she was only referred to. Re-read Albedo's conversation with her sister in volume three.</br></br></br></br>  Animefag here, did Ainz develop one of the guardians?  <br>Yes, but he hasn't been introduced yet.</br>  <br>Pandora's Actor, the Doppelnazi</br>  <br>Touch Me has a wife daughter and is a collage prof. on top of being the world champion for the Melee classes and all around good guy.</br>  does papa bones ever meet a worthy foe?  How competent is the TL for the Overlord manga? Because /ak/'s editing sure as hell isn't any good.  <br>At the end of this season. Then it'll be a while again.</br>  I wouldn't because she hates lower life forms and will obliterate my ass for just looking at her  <br>  Successful in life <br>  OP as fuck in game <br>Can he be more based ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  Is there an epub or pdf version floating around for volumes 3-5? Did a cursory Google search and didn't find any results.  <br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Pandora%27s_Actor<br><br><br>Yes.  Shalltear <br>Aside from that there are yet to be encountered (as of the translated volumes) strong characters (dragon lords and stuff) and the chance of meeting other players or NPCs in future.<br><br><br>It's fine. But if you haven't read the LN first then start with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Is there a group that's still taking the subs and muxing them into rips that aren't Funi garbage?  What race was Touch Me? I know he was Inhuman but was he an elf or something?  <br>I'm guessing you're referring to Spinel, Albedo's little sister? Where did the name Rubedo come from?</br>  <br><br>that name gets funnier the more i see it</br></br>  <br> pointlessly weak <br> bitch is over 50 levels lower than you <br> you are as strong as Kid Captain in melee <br> Kid Captain can tank crazy mode Shalltear no problem despite being vastly outleveled <br> Skill can tank any physical hit you dish out so long as she uses her block skill first <br><br>It's amazing. Martial Arts is the one thing that will allow Certain Death and future Brain to fuck with Nazarick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here; https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br><br>Does someone want to make an OP template, so we can reduce the repeated questions every thread?<br><br><br>My mistake.

Knew I should have instead of /r/'ing.</br>  <br>Source on the college prof part.</br>  <br>The Demon God they'll talk about later is on par or weaker than a level 7 summoned angel. Which means it's leagues below Ainz level. Of course this all assumes Nigan knows what the hell he's talking about.</br>  <br>That's super dangerous, to ever trust Nigan's words. That retard thinks a WC item is worth less than his dumb angel.</br>  <br>I don't think its ever said what race he is. Some assume it's the same race as Sebas, namely a dragonoid.</br>    <br>your hours late ;_;</br>  <br> thatsthejoke.gif </br>  <br>must have been one of this threads as I can no longer find it.<br>that said World Break: Attacks target by slashing the space. This skill is superior to the 10th Rank Magic, "Reality Slash".</br></br>  so we all agree that this is aots right  <br>No, it's a poorly done adaptation that does not do the source material justice. Of coarse it could be much worse (See the Manga), but it could still be many times better as well.</br>  Is that Planescape: the Anime?  <br>whats wrong with it? for a guy that hasn't read the source material i thought it was pretty damn well done.</br>  <br>If you truly enjoy it, I strongly suggest you just read the LN. Then you'll understand the disappointment.</br>  <br>No since Ains never updates his journal</br>  <br><br><br>dont listen to LNfag, they will shit anime any adaptation because normalfag cant into moonrunes</br></br></br>  Anyone made a webm of Papa Bones appearing in the portal and squashing hearts?  <br>I don't see where he says it's more valuable, just that it was his "sure kill" trump card that few people knew about. Of course I would still be very careful about taking Nigan's assessment too seriously.<br><br>Also I was wrong here .<br>The Dominion of Authority can cast up to7th level magic, I don't know what level summon it is.</br></br></br></br>  Audio Drama Tracks 9 &amp; 10 released<br>Get it from Imoutlicious's blog (Can't like cause of link spam filter)</br>  <br>About half the novel is translated so far, so it's not like you can't read it yourself.</br>  <br> What can change the nature of a man? <br> Becoming a lich apparently. </br></br>  <br>It's mentioned when he brings up the 3 most important treasures of the Theocracy.<br><br> 1. The relic of the 8 greed kings <br> 2. The magic tool of the dragon king/lord <br> 3. The crystal left behind by the 6 gods <br><br>That he doesn't include the WC item despite knowing it's name either means the robe belonged to the 8 kings, but would make the author a poor writer because there's no need to imply they may be separate items, or that Nigan is an idiot which is the most likely outcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THAT'S A NICE HEAD YOU HAVE ON YOUR SHOULDERS  <br>Narberal can cast 7th level spells and she's 63</br>  <br>Where does he   Keep his phylactery  </br>  <br>She can cast up to the 8th tier though, so that angel is definitely not her level.</br>  <br>maybe he outgrew the need for a phylactery when he ranked up to overlord from Elder Lich</br>  Any webm for the death knight butchering scene ?  <br>I was trying to set an upper limit, so less than 60 and more than 40</br>  <br>So is anyone else trapped in game?<br>Baka Tsuki isn't showing any sign yet.</br></br>  <br>When did she cast 8th tier magic?

You did it right this time.</br>  <br> Leave the damage dealing to the gish and dumb meatshield. <br>Were there even prestige classes in the game?</br></br>  <br>This?

It's brought up first when he talks about the three items and again when he actually summons the angel. Neither of them seem to imply it's the same item to me.

There can be no doubt.</br></br>  <br> damaging it at all with a shitty weapon </br>  <br> not already useless </br>  <br>I'd tell you to read the LN, but I don't really care.</br>  <br>A spider.</br>  <br>2spooky</br>  <br>All of the guardians pretty much have "ignore any damage below 3rd tier shit" as well as Ainz. Its mostly for intimidation/hiding identity.</br>  <br>The all-powerful bunny girl!</br>  <br>The LN barely describes the armour other than it being spikey and not showing any skin.</br>  Only 13 episodes? Fucking why?  I wonder how much more fun the show would be if he left that line in.  <br>Does it also mention how Albedo wears shitty armor because she's "ruler of the guardians she doesn't really need high stats on er armour"?</br>  <br>So what's the point of having Disgaea tier stats on that thing? Does it have some sort of counter or magic reflect to make it worthwhile?</br>  <br>"Bitch" in japan refers to a "bitch in heat" so that line actually meant she was a slut. So probably a hentai</br>  <br>It mentions how she has a fuck huge backstory, it wouldn't surprise me at all if she had equipment that looked nice instead of equipment that had the best stats.</br>  <br>She'd be generic tsundere</br>  <br>Is it true the LN version had a kite shield? Any art of that?</br>  <br>It would have been a hentai. Still would have been good though.</br>  <br>Trap elf's chastity won't make it past the 2nd episode.</br>  <br>Tower shield</br>  <br>Unless her backstory makes her an incompetent retard, she's not going to show up in useless armor after Bones orders her to gear up and head out with him while the Tomb goes on max security.</br>  <br>That's my point. The only way Nigun isn't a retard is if the WC robe is one of the 3 great treasures, but going by how the author words it, that clearly isn't the case.<br><br>So therefore, Nigun is a fucking idiot. Obviously the BS knows better, and it's not like the Theocracy is obligated to be truthful to all their members. That's just how it is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck I forgot that they meant different things. Although a slut second in command running around and riding the bones off of anything on a regular basis would be pretty funny.</br></br>  <br><br>It's MMO armor, it's not supposed to look realistic<br><br>I honestly don't get why all the "muh armor realism" fags are getting mad over that</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. No.</br>  <br>You claim this yet these threads are clear evidence that go against your statement. And let's not forget /m/ exists.</br>  <br> Because some faggots said Albedo's armor was great and more relaistic than most anime armors so the armorfags got triggered.</br>  How can anyone watch this Gary Stu trash?   humming the ending <br> see  </br>  <br>It's the only way to avoid becoming a bunny slave to Zorzal.</br>  <br>The post that started this chain said nothing about realism, just that the armor looked like shit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9u_<wbr>v9H24PfY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>KyanKyan are for bullying.</br>  <br>Can they even change their gear by themselves?

Not too useful, but when the game has no definite end and is an endless grind to pass time strange choices are made after a while.</br>  <br>We're talking about autism, not which is better. Don't move the goal post while using /a/ images.</br>  <br>because mc is a skeleton<br>if he wasnt then there would no reason to watch it</br></br>  <br>You can't self-insert as a skeleton, anon.</br>  <br>Careful testing of waters.<br><br>If they keep the 4ep per volume (and they're still cutting small scenes/details out completely), they'd have enough material for 2x 13 eps after the first.<br><br>Don't know if the author has mapped his output to climax every 3 volumes or what but it's pretty nice so far.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if he wasnt then there would no reason to watch it </br>  <br>Technically,  yourself is already inserted into a skeleton. </br>  <br> there is one inside you RIGHT the fuck now <br><br>I'm serious.

There are no skeletons.</br>  <br>S2 would be fun but then I realized I'd have to put with Climb all over again.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> I don't think so. </br>  <br>I can't do that on a Christian image board, ask Albedo for private lesson.</br>  <br>Skeletons don't exist jackass</br>  I was expecting her to flip out during episodes, starting murdering civilians and asking Ainz what the hell he helps mortals.<br><br>At least could have included some scene of his minians thinking something like " Ohh.. so thats how evil his real plans are! He probably wants to provide them false sense of security, to enjoy their suffering more when crushing them! The two lolis he is preparing as a virgin sacrafice to create new dark artifcat! Thats Momonga-sama for you!"</br></br>  <br>Yeah and neither does Santa right?</br>  <br>At the very least, the Death Knight Papa Bones summoned had better pathfinding than any of those fucking imps.</br>  <br> Maybe it has something to do with "Overlord" being a word for dark lord-like chaotic evil character who's goal is to conquer to world, just maybe.</br>  <br>There will be plenty of that in the future. Ainz can do no wrong in the eyes of his guardians.</br>  <br>That's bullshit and you know it, "Dark Lord" or "Shadow Lord" or fucking "Underworld Lord" are all more common than "Overlord"</br>  <br>It may be because of the meaning of the word "Overlord'</br>  <br><br> all that potential /ss/ doujin it should've generated <br><br>Imagine all the doujin that will be writing themselve if he didn't change that one fucking line</br></br></br></br>  <br>Theyre not evil. Their sense of justice is extremely negative, but it doesnt mean theyre bad guys. They lack the empathy for lower lifeforms.</br>  <br> Doesn't change the meaning of "Overlord", which also sounds cooler for a title than "Underworld Lord".</br>  <br><br> make excellent grills <br> give them dicks <br>Do the japs not realize the reason for their low birthrates or is this some sort of campaign to reduce them?</br></br></br></br>  <br> two different series have the title " The King"  <br> "man, they're both about kings, what a coincidence right?" </br></br>  <br> two trilogies called star wars <br> one is about star wars, the other about the romantic adventure of some child </br></br>  <br> three different series have the title "The Faggot" <br> man, one's about a body builder, the other is about a guy who plays video games, and the last one watches anime, what a coincidence right? </br></br>  <br>It was a typo, I meant Lich instead of Lord</br>  <br> romantic </br>  <br>The trilogy basically revolves around anakin and padme and their forbidden relationship.</br>  <br> two different people have the title "eternal loser" <br> one browses /a/ the other browses /tg/ <br> "man, they're both losers, what a coincidence, right?" </br></br></br>  <br><br>Heh.</br></br>  <br> The trilogy revolves around Anakin being a whinny creepy stalker till he gets the girl and then kills her.</br>  <br>Actually, they are extremely evil. Some Chaotic evil, some lawful - but they officially are.</br>  I really hope the massacre isnt just limitted to this episode.  <br>sssh<br>they haven't figured it out since MacArthur first took charge of them during the post war occupation</br></br>    <br> two series called Fate <br> "man, they're both shit, what a coincidence right?" </br></br>  <br>There will be more cool stuff in the following episodes but the LN turns kinda boring later on with entire volumes dedicated to lizardmen nobody cares about and this faggot Climb.</br>  <br>We can only hope author has something planned for Climb. Something fitting his status. I mean his end of the road.</br>  <br>I'd pay good money to see LN fully armored Albedo but noo, we get stuck with boobplate, oh well I can imagine that it's a female robot to get my dick instantly hard.</br>  <br>It's latter explained that those potions are literally liquid magic.</br>  <br>Evil in the sense that they have no conflict doing evil things, but they'll never go out of their way to cause unwarranted destruction and mayham. They're pretty much neutral unless Ainz orders an action. But at that point its semantics</br>  <br><br>Fuck you, I loved the Lizardmen arc.<br><br>It was great to see how others perceive Ainz and his ruthlessness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They all have their own stash and they're all kitted out in divine stuff.</br>  <br>Mindflayer.</br>  Who is Nazrick?  <br>Dragon dude.</br>  <br>I feel like it was in their perspective for too long. I enjoyed it too, but I enjoy Ainz perspective more so.</br>  <br>No anon, no. The insertion is the other way around.</br>  <br>Slime.</br>  <br>Though rarely you went all-out and moved around your best possible gear at once, since players would always drop one item on death.</br>  <br>Burd.</br>  <br>I wonder how bukubukuchagama-san handles those In game costumes. Maybe he just wears headdresses.</br>  <br>It would have been okay for 1 or 2 chapters, but their part was way too long especially since they probably won't be too relevant again.<br>Would have rather read about Ainz/Momon doing stuff or adventuring.</br></br>  <br><br>Make it happen.</br></br>  <br>Well since she, Herohero and Solution are all ooze's, they could probably go for other forms than just one blob on the floor. Who knows.</br>  <br>And theyre doing it again with Climb now. I understand the importance of seeing it from his perspective, but hes just so GOD DAMN BORING.</br>  <br>You gotta make them somebody before turn'em into lizard jerky (peppered).</br>  <br><br>You can't tell me that you didn't like Zenberu though?</br></br>  <br>Who knows, look what Enri got herself into with her Green Horde. And Cocytus is training them to be loyal troops so they will most definitely get another spotlight/relevance later. <br><br>Maybe if those troops are needed somewhere where just gating auto-spawns won't do.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked the lizardmen and the battle against the dummy army was kinda funny/entertaining (felt like a "normal" fantasy battle).<br>I just felt it could have been way shorter without emphasizing their relationships (tribal and personal) so much.</br></br>  So why did he start calling himself Ainz?  <br>To spread the name of the guild, which was reasonably well known back in the mmo. He even thinks that if he ever finds one of his guildmates he'll stop calling himself Ainz.</br>  <br>he didn't think about it that much he just said he'll use that name until he meets another guildmate</br>  <br> want to spread the name <br> hide his skeleton face, keeps his power in check and tries to keep a low profile as possible. <br>?</br></br></br>  <br> not hiding your powerlevel until absolutely necessary to show it <br><br>Did you learn nothing from DBZ?</br></br></br>  <br>What are you saying?<br><br>It's a cool mask!</br></br></br>  <br>The novels explain why he doesn't just do that. Go read them now.</br>  <br>The plan is to have Momon become a huge legend then revealing he's part of Ainz Oown Goal. And that there's a fuckload of people on his powerlevel in Nazarick.</br>  <br>Be careful with that mémé champ, it's an antique :^))))))))))))))))))))))))</br>  <br>He tries to have two identities at first. One as Momon the adventurer and the other as Ainz. His plan is to build up the fame of Momon and then reveal that Ainz is the same person. The reason why he waits is because his guild were massive dickwads and PKers back in the day so he wants to give it a pre-emptive positive reputation in case there's any other players.</br>  <br><br>i'm triggered</br></br>  <br>Bro it's a Meuporg, you can be any race you want to be so long as it's an in-game playable.</br>  <br>  top-tier guild that had one of the best players as a member (Touch Me is a world class player). <br><br>Aside from Touch Me, the Guild also had Ulbert (Demiurge's creator and part of the Original 9) who was the best magic caster, and Tabula, who was a strong ass alchemist, much more powerful than Ainz.<br><br>Ainz is only upper-middle tier, and he was mainly support. The world would have shit its pants if Ulbert or Tabula were the ones that arrived (both of them were much more focused on the 'evil' side of the guild).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his guild were massive dickwads <br>more like reverse dickwads. none humanoid races didn't have a penalty if you PKed them, so not only where the dedicated PvP players after them, but the PvE players would also attack the non-humanoids. the Original 9 with Touch and momo were basically a counter gank squad, that became a guild focusing on PvP because if they're going to be free targets then why not earn the hate.<br>they were so effective that they ranked 9th highest guild, had the best mage and warrior, collected 11 of the 200 strongest items( the next best guild only had 3) crafted the most badass dungeon ever( when you can hold of a 1500 player raid you've earned teh right to be called badass, espcially once one factors that max party size is 6)<br><br>TLDR: the other players were asking for it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are the top 8 guilds ever mentioned?</br>  <br>All the extra weight is worse than the boobplate.<br><br>Also the anime design is more 'Fantasy MMO'.</br></br></br>  <br>No. Blindly fanatic girls are not my type. I like someone who can actually think for themselves.</br>  <br>mid upper-tier*</br>  <br>neither really matters as her armor is Divine Tier Magic Armour and she's basically got all teh Tank classes.</br>  <br>I think the only other guilds that's been mentioned so far is one guild raided the guilds mines at some point and another guild filled their own guild base with cats instead of NPCs enemies.</br>  What makes Narberal so perfect?  <br><br><br><br>I hope we keep getting more of this in the next volumes.</br></br></br></br>  How does a lich create an heir? Is his lower body not made of bones?  <br>forgot the pic</br>  <br>Transformation magic</br>  <br> guild base with cats <br>what, 700 level 1 felines? thats hilarious</br></br>  <br>He's a wizard. There's probably a spell to help with that.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>A double page showing the whole guild (pic related) would be a nice end for the series or an important arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else want to be inside solution?  <br>Level 100 mage. heaps of ways, like polymorph, or create item (semen in a turkey baster), or even just alchemically creating an heir</br>  <br>they probably had at least one nemean lion</br>  Does Ainz ever run into other players who got trapped in the game?  <br> sniper <br> monk <br> assasin <br> wizard <br>What are Bug-girl and tomboy's classes?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would level 100 Solution be renamed to Final Solution?</br>  <br><br>All the maids are going to get screen time?</br></br>  <br> Fantasy MMO <br><br>Overlord is heavily based on DnD, so it would hardly have normal fantasy mmo gimmicks</br></br></br>    <br>its:<br>CZ(Sniper)<br>Yuri(Striker)<br>Solution(Assassin)<br>Lupusregina(Battle Cleric)<br>Entoma(Talisman caster/ insect summoner)<br>Narberal( Battle Mage)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cyborg and Yuri get some time in Vol 3 when they meet PA, Solution has some in the begining of the Vol 3, and Nabe is a MC in Vol 2, but the other two don't show until later volumes.</br>  Elves would make bad swordsmen with how their ears stick out.  Kuri.  <br><br>Why does she try to kill Bozes? That makes no sense.</br></br>  <br><br>Don't ask me, I only read the manga.</br></br>  <br>She's jealous because she's inferior as a woman.</br>  <br>Jealousy makes women do stupid things.</br>  <br><br><br>How is she jealous? Did she even like him?<br><br>Wouldn't that still mean she's raising another woman's child?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those aren't ears - they are "rape handles"<br><br>You know, so you don't fall off while riding them...</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah she did like him and yes women are crazy like that.<br><br>Didn't you ever watch Mexican soap operas when you were a kid anon? Those were common plot lines.</br></br></br>  <br> Didn't you ever watch Mexican soap operas when you were a kid anon? <br><br>No, I got fat and played a lot of video games.</br></br></br>    <br>That's why they're archers.</br>  <br>Wait, someone still watches/reads that shit?<br>Outbreak Company did the same plot in an orders of magnitude better way and with the bestest girls.</br></br>  <br> Elves <br> making good anything except sex slaves <br>Laughingdwarves.axe</br></br></br>  <br>Throughout the entire series, she's unable to get a man who wants her, even though she has big tits and is quite willing to settle down. Her being able to beat up other males only further scared off potential suitors.<br><br>So when Bozes is finally proposed to by her lover, she snaps, thinking she could take her place as lover, wife, and mother.<br><br>At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if she managed to tame a wolfman (being that she's also worthy of being an alpha female) or minotaur (she has the bust to attract them) and take them as her husband. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised if she outfucked and tamed an Orcman for a husband.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You again? It seems your autism knows no bounds</br>  <br>Outbreak Company did the same plot because it copied Gate's fights like beating a red dragon with a panzerfaust.</br>  <br><br>Please tell me Bozes can put up a fight. I don't mind shorty being strong, but steamrolling everyone in single combat is kind of flat.</br></br>  <br> she's unable to get a man who wants her <br>Tomita wanted Kuri?<br>Also Kuri fell for Itami in the webnovel so she might be joining the harem soon.</br></br></br>  Rory is the best girl.    <br>Rory is sex.</br>  <br><br>That really doesn't show much.</br></br>  <br>I don't think a knife vs a sword would mean steamrolling. Plus Bozes is a knight so it might be more equal than you think.</br>  <br>It'd be hilarious if Kuri did fall for Itami like in the WN. Moreso if she managed to wrestle him down and sex him (with Rory jumping in at some point).<br><br>Tomita is fine too.<br><br> Though now that I think about it, it's time that we got a female JSDF soldier getting a male mate from across the gate. All the pairings thus far is JSDF Male / Gate Female. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rory has the end game win.</br>  <br> I don't think a knife vs a sword would mean steamrolling. <br><br>You've seen what she can do, she can.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That she is.</br></br>  I find it weird that magic and their powers work in our world. Would that imply that our world also has magic but it is a lost art?  <br>Misconduct towards a superior officer :<br><br>Using violence against a superior officer<br>Threatening behaviour or communication to a superior officer<br><br>Max. sentence at Court Martial :<br><br>10 years' imprisonment<br><br>But hey she's a female, it's not a big deal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Magic use is genetic.</br>  <br>Maybe. we have our own demigod as well, except he was nailed on a cross and people don't believe him</br>   Reminder that this will never be animated   <br><br>They're just going to let her off for trying to kill Bozes, aren't they?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1284 <br> superior officer <br><br>Zorzal?<br><br>I wish he was dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a very good reason to have mages trapped in tubes</br>  <br>he's never going to find love, is he?</br>  <br>Speaking of that Considering the fight Itami had with Flame Dragon. He took a lot of damage which was directed to Rory. Does that mean Itami is now invulnerable? </br>  <br><br>Wouldn't you think there'd be a point that it'd overload her capacity to self-heal?</br></br>  <br>Highly doubt it, she will just feel the pain he's feeling.</br>  <br>Made me wonder if he'll even age now.</br>  <br>Can't really do that. You can cut Demigods into hundreds of pieces and they'll still heal back together. I guess there might be a limit on the damage that the contract can transfer to Rory.</br>   Spoil me on this, why does the gate close in the novels?   <br><br>can anyone spoil me on this?</br></br>  <br><br> Kuri goes full retard when Tomita proposes to Boozes, and challenges her to a duel. <br><br> Rori stops it. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Had to be closed due to instabilities in both worlds, earthquakes etc. However Lelei opens a new one 4 years later that can be opened and closed at will. </br>  <br>Well, this guy is a Jedi so is not big deal</br>  <br><br> Is it 4 years here or 4 years there? Chose a side, dammit </br></br>  <br><br>Must be nice living in the forest though, those ears must be great for hearing things.</br></br>  <br>Which girls has sex with Itami in the WN?</br>  <br>*had</br>  Lelei  <br> Either way its a 2 month difference, so doesn't really matter but since it's told from the other world's PoV I assume it's their 4 years. </br>  <br>1 year in gate 4 years on earth</br>  <br><br><br>M'kay, thanks</br></br></br>  What is this  <br>granny panties, you sick fuck.</br>  <br>well played sir.</br>  <br>Weren't the years in their world 389 days but the days a little bit shorter?</br>  <br>or great for having ants and bugs burying themselves into it while you sleep. during vietnam war soldiers had rub their ears with insect repellent before taking a nap to stop nasty bugs from going in and fucking up their ear drums.</br>  GATE's, mangaka drew the anime version of Rory in his style.  <br>Looks better.</br>  <br>to be perfectly fair, the artist who did Gate manga wasn't that good of an artist. the anime version looks better drawn overall, even if the style isn't as agreeable to some.</br>  <br>I was about to post that.</br>  <br>wait what?<br>that's how the novel end?<br>i need more spoilers on this shit,so it closes, then what? the end?</br></br></br>  How much slavery was there in the Holy Roman Empire (as opposed to the Roman Empire which was full of it)? The whole "yeah we took some slaves from you guys, what of it? You're not going to take any from us?" thing made sense in the context of "Rome" but I don't know it it makes sense her.  <br>It closes and the gaiden series starts.</br>  <br>Read the previous thread.</br>  <br> op doesn't have link to previous thread <br>okay..</br></br>  <br>the gaidens look generic as fuck and mighty lame</br>  <br>Any man would prefer a blonde drill ojou-sama to some generic shitty jap woman.</br>  <br>we're not doing generals this ain't a charity we're runnign here</br>  <br> I'm too lazy to check the archive, spoonfeed me plz! </br>  Haha, anyone else enjoy that the MC is such an otaku who loves cat-girls despite being a military officer? I know I do! The contrast between otaku and military is so hilarious! Lol!  <br>Picked up</br>  <br>Gaiden 3:  Itami becomes a dragon knight made stoic by Tuka so his fear of flying dragons doesn't appear to save a bunch of elves. She finds out that her dad survived the dragon attack and has harem and a new kid. Turns out the dad had amnesia and only recovered for a short time when Tuka and Itami arrived. He doesn't want to leave his newfound harem and family so Tuka leaves him there. <br><br>Not a novelfag just remembering what was said in previous threads</br></br></br>  <br>Given that many countries in the world practice conscription, a large amount of /a/ has probably had military experience, so I don't see you are point.<br><br>Also, I heard plenty of WoW stories from my superiors in the army.</br></br></br>  <br>Haha, because the MC being an otaku was the whole point of this story! Lol!</br>  <br>I like him more cause he's a stealth badass. I don't care about the otaku shit.</br>  <br><br><br>yeah that's so super duper crazy cause we all know that soldiers aren't allowed to have a hobby right?<br><br>are you guys like... 14 or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was being sarcastic you idiot.

Like for example if a series has vampires then it is to be assumed other nightmare creatures exist. If magic and gods exists in the GATE world then magic and gods exist in our world.</br>  <br><br>Normal tanks work just fine in Japan, they always have. Nothing about Japan's terrain is in any way unique to it. Mountains exist elsewhere, as do plains, cities, and forests. The Japanese "optimized" their tank a bit for their terrain in light of the fact it isn't expected to go anywhere else (and thus doesn't need things like desert operations capability and huge intake filters), but that doesn't mean that other tanks wouldn't function just fine in Japan.<br><br>Modern MBTs are by design supposed to function just about everywhere. Just look at other island nations like Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia, all of which operate "conventional" MBTs (Leopard 2 and PT-91) just fine. The Leopard 2, Abrams, Challenger series, etc. were all designed to operate globally either due to a desire to promote exports (Leopard 2) or because their operators needed the ability to deploy anywhere globally (Abrams, Challenger). Korea, incidentally, has a fuckton of mountains.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe magic and gods were inspired by people who passed through the gate and back?</br>  <br>Serfdom was used extensively in the HRE, which was essentially slavery; you were bound to the land, and forced to work for the local lord.<br><br>Churches had massive power back then, and were given a share of local land for their own use.<br><br>It was a bad time to be a peasant, that's for sure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I recommend you look up the rape of Nanking anon. <br><br>The peacetime Chinese government after world war 2 killed more chinese people than the wartime japanese ever did. Please also note the difference between war and peacetime for China. There's been a lot of anti-japan rhetoric by both China and fans of china ever since Japan refused to hand over some of its islands to China because they sit in an area where there could be deep sea oil. Some of the history rewriting has even occurred on wikipedia where many chinese rewrites had to be reversed.<br><br>China is quite unashamed with its various tactics as hypocrisy is not in its dictionary. For example, it tried to force its way onto the organization membership of nations that share arctic territory borders in order to secure fishing rights there. Currently, only countries which have shared arctic borders are members of the organization which meets to portion out fishing, navigation, and occupation rights. Obviously, China is no where near the arctic but that doesn't stop them from trying to force (or bribe) some of the organization's member nations into proposing China as a member.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I'm not agree with your reason, I agree with "re-bomb the fuck out of them" part. A-1 studio should be ground zero</br>  <br>In modern times, there is "wage slavery" but it is unlike older slavery models which tied people to land. The wage slavery model ties people into groups or classes of people. Of course, such people typically would live in certain lands that the upper classes don't live so in one abstract sense, land is still a factor.</br>  Elevens have become Westernized so much I'm not sure they could ever go back to the old Showa-era militaristic Imperialism.<br><br>It could happen, for sure, but it would take a long time for such sweeping changes to occur; you'd need at least a generation to reeducate the children.<br><br>Even with all their economic troubles and woes, the average person in Nippon still lives far, far better than they did pre-WW2. It would take some serious shit going down for things to change, and I cannot see that happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong century dude.</br>  <br>To add to that, type 10 uses a ceramic armor of some kind which JSDF claims more resilient than the standard Armour. I don't believe it till I see it but Japan did spend money researching on the topic.<br><br>Also type 10's design philosophy is different from K2. While K2 is designed to beat down enemy tanks head-on, type10 is designed to get them based on info from recon drones etc preferably before enemy get in the line of sight and either annihilate the targets or run away. <br><br>Name wise both K2 and type 10 are tanks but type 10 is more like a striker with better Armour and firepower that Abrams.</br></br></br></br></br>  But they can make awesome bros.  <br> Malaysia <br> island nation <br>It's a peninsula</br></br></br>  <br><br>All tanks with modern FCS are designed for battlefield networking. The Type 10 is not special in this regard, it just got a fancy video to promote the capability. In the US Army this capability is provided by cavalry scouts (the unsung heroes of armored warfare), helicopter reconnaissance, or via drone for units equipped with them. <br><br>Abrams has better armor than the Type 10, and almost certainly better penetration against likely threats. While people like to make a big deal about how the Leopard 2A6 has an L/55 gun and the Type 10 has an L/50 vs. the Abrams' L/44, the Abrams has much better ammunition as the US has invested huge sums in developing more advanced penetrators. This is why the US intentionally decided against using the L/55. Their ammunition is already plenty effective with the L/44 and the L/55 would require recalculating all of their ballistic tables and actually make the M829A3 too fast (its lower MV is designed to make it less likely to set off ERA on contact).<br><br>The Type 10 is impressive for what it is, namely an almost purely domestically-made tank focused on maintaining a low weight and high mobility. But it isn't an amazing wonder-tank, and at the end of the day, there are just no substitutes for mass. Those extra 10 tons of armor matter.<br><br>And Japan is no longer interested in building more tanks, their strategic doctrine is changing from expecting to repel a Soviet amphibious invasion of Hokkaido (which the Type 74 and 90 and to a lesser extent the Type 10 were designed around) to a focus on strategic mobility, using wheeled vehicles like the MCV rather than heavy tanks that are hard for Japan to deploy with its limited sealift capability. The threat is no longer a mass invasion but skirmishes in the disputed zones and islands against China. Tanks aren't so good for that role unless you're an Amerifat and have a whole fleet of ships designed to support them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what if she became Emroy's new apostle after rori.</br>  <br><br>inb4 Borneo.</br></br>  <br>That would actually fit her quite well.</br>  <br> COBRA COMMANDER </br>  <br>Are you joking?<br>Attach a short blade to each one of those ears and she will gouge your motherfucking eyes before you realize what is happening!</br></br>  <br>She'd be like 60 by then though.

For the purpose of avoiding attacking the same target and friendly fire, the platoon leader is given the capability to assign a target for each unit via BMS;automated target allocation is available. Target acquisition is enhanced by the shape based threat detection system which recognize MBTs, Armour vehicles, airborne threats, static targets and enemy personal. <br>I might have mistranslated some bits but hope you will forgive me for that.<br><br>Now I don't believe the auto aim is good, it would require human elements to prevent shooting a random target. The tank's FCS design is very experimental and would be dangerous for Peace keeping operation and such.

Both shows have this sort of modern urban fantasy thing with characters making tons of unfunny meta wank banter comments at each other for minutes on end while the camera occasionally gives us some sort of fanservice shot. I'd argue that Saekano is also A-1 trying to do pretty much the same damn thing only even more blatantly so with even more meta otaku wank stuff and awkwardly placed quick cut fanservice shots. It's no wonder why /a/ are such apologists for both shows.</br></br>  <br> Saekano is also A-1 trying to do pretty much the same damn thing only even more blatantly so with even more meta otaku wank stuff and awkwardly placed quick cut fanservice shots. <br><br>This sounds fucking awful.

It's written as pathetic and vile and to whatever extent he as a character is hating himself for it, the author is clearly hating him even more, and the audience too for demanding it. It's harder for this kind of deconstruction to come across in animation at all, even though Shaft really does convey a lot more than you might expect would be possible from the books. With this stuff, and in general all the meta commentary on the industry/audience/author relationship that's mainly out from in Hachikuji and Ougi's stories, it seems like Shaft just doesn't get it, or doesn't think the audience would get it, or something. The next season is Ougi focused, so maybe they'll finally come around on this stuff. And they could even do it in ways that make clearer what the books were trying to say in these Hatchikuji interactions the whole time, depending on what all they include from the book.</br>  <br> It's written as pathetic and vile and to whatever extent he as a character is hating himself for it, the author is clearly hating him even more, and the audience too for demanding it <br>Top tier bullshitting right there, moralfag.</br></br>  <br>What do you think Nisio was trying to say about the Araragi and Hachikuji interactions?</br>  <br>Pro tip   we can't  </br>  <br>It was alright.</br>  <br><br>It's one of those shows people absolutely wank about because it had some nice character designs (the original artwork at least, the usual A-1 massive downscale in visual detail and quality applies as always) and because they figure one girl is like the best harem heroine ever or something since she's supposed to not fit into a clear stereotype while the other characters constantly have the stereotypes they fill lampshaded at every possible opportunity as a pretty major portion of the dialogue early on. <br><br>Personally I found it downright obnoxious in many ways, it kind of reminded me of everything that was awful about the directors last light novel adaptation at A-1 Oreshura. Loathsome characters, inconsistent animation quality that tries to get around it with constant panning fanservice shots of the female cast, and what feels like ceaseless meta level banter about the casts otakudom and what a coincidence that everything resembles x scenario from some light novel or eroge they read. If you like that sort of thing it's probably great, but I'm hardly obsessed with it so it was just kind of like slow torture listening to this cast go on about their hobbies and be living stereotypes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  It's no wonder why /a/ are such apologists for both shows. <br>The people who defend Saekano/Monogatari meta wankery banter as having any value like it because it's middlebrow. It's different but not different enough that it makes these people uncomfortable. <br><br><br>Aside from really appealing character designs, you didn't miss anything. Considering that the character art is the only redeeming quality of these shows, it's something that doesn't require actually watching the shows to get. You can easily find the art on Pixiv/*Boorus/etc.<br><br><br>It's very self-indulgent. A self-aware form of self-indulgence. People into this shit think they're smart or enlightened compared to the "rabble", when really they're no different. At least the lowbrow "rabble" don't pretend they're different.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know who would have done monogatari better.<br>White Fox.</br>  <br>They did do the better Nisio adaptation after all.</br>  Reminder that Kyoani stopped making good anime a while ago.  <br>Yeah, since Hibike they haven't done anything worthwhile. Meanwhile out of 27 series and 45+ seasons SHAFT has made only 2 are relevant.</br>  <br>I enjoyed Hibike and AmaBuri, though both were far from perfect. KyoAni's doing alright.</br>  <br>Of course they're doing allright in sales term. But I'm really fed up of the cutesy SOL stuff, and believe me, I even liked K-on at the time.</br>  <br><br>And yeah Amaburi was fun at least. Hibike bored me to death, dropped after a few eps.</br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking in terms in sales. I've enjoyed their most recent shows, though Kyokai no Kanata was complete trash.<br><br>Being fed up with SoL isn't an issue with the works or studio themselves though, you can't exactly use it as a criticism. It happens, give it a few months and you'll be wanting SoL again, trust me.</br></br></br>  Reminder that Little Busters would've been better and would've saved Kyoani if they had done it.<br><br>Now they're shit and will just keep on making shit with a few decent shows mixed in here and there.</br></br>  <br> one girl is like the best harem heroine ever or something since she's supposed to not fit into a clear stereotype <br><br>She is. You reek of the Aniplex Guy who ruined our S2 celebration thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that the only reason why Monogatari is so good is because Shinbo directs it</br>  <br>Yes LB would've been better with KyoAni adapting it because they are one of the few studios that know how to adapt a VN. But they don't want the Aniplex/Kodakwa jewery that comes with adapting stuff that they don't own.</br>  <br>Then why is Katanagatari good anon?</br>  <br>Because it's good? <br><br>I'm not saying SHAFT is shit, just that Monogatari is successful because of its direction.</br></br></br>  Violet Ever Garden by Utsumi when?  <br>And what is called? Guessing it's NGNL.</br>  <br>But they are, in some cases.</br>  <br> wish-fulfillment for self-described "intelligent, but lazy" otaku manchildren <br>Sounds about right.</br></br>   Kyoanus licker wanting to turn everything into generic moe SoL <br><br>Please kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Can anyone provide a remotely tenable argument about why this would be true?</br>  <br> looking for reasonable discussion in a shitposting thread <br>?</br></br>  Literally any show would be better off if it was done by KyoAni. I know hating this studio is a cool thing to do on /a/ right now, but the fact is that KA is pretty much in the tier of their own when it comes to quality productions.  <br>Bakemonogatari was a good watch but the other Monogatari series are so boring I could never get through them. I don't care about Shaft's presentation. It never fit Monogatari the way it for SZS. If KyoAni animated Monogatari it might be worth siting through because at least the animation quality would be decent.</br>  <br> We will never get pre-'10s Madhouse ever again  <br><br>why even live</br></br></br>  <br>Thank god it wasn't. <br>I'd hate to see KyoAni resort to that level of blatant fanservice. Amagi was bad enough, and that was admittedly nothing in comparison.</br></br>  <br> premise == quality <br>k m8</br></br>  <br>YOU<br><br>Why are the K-on's shit?</br></br></br>  <br>But Monogatari is full of blatant fanservice, you nigger.</br>  How often does SHAFT take their employees to Hawaii, huh?  <br>Are you a retard? How can you have such poor reading comprehension? The anon you replied to was complaining about Monogatari being blatant fanservice, and saying that it's good Kyoani didn't animate Monogatari, because he doesn't want to see Kyoani resorting to the Monogatari series' blatant fanservice, and that Amagi (which was nothing in comparison to Monogatari in terms of fanservice) was bad enough for Kyoani</br>  <br>I don't know if Kyoani actually do that, but even if they do it, it doesn't change the fact that most Kyoani shows are boring shit</br>  <br>That's his point you dumb fuck. Learn to read instead of just reacting to keywords like a triggered autist.</br>  <br>http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/sta<wbr>ff/anibaka/blog/?p=1070<br> どうも。今年もきっと海に行くぞと息巻いているわさびです。 <br> PS　あ。わさびもう海いってました！ハワイですけど。。。。 </br></br></wbr></br>  I don't know OP. I prefer to be able to tell characters apart by their facial features. KyoAni makes this impossible; picture related.  <br>Your pict is outdated, man.</br>  <br>You must have some serious problems if you can't tell those girls apart.</br>  Reminder that Shaft will show more of Monogatari and Prism Nana next comiket.  <br>No it's very current. The projections of the facial features(seen here  ) is 99.9% accurate.<br><br><br>Also, you have conclusively proven my point of KyoAni sameface by stating "those girls." There is a male in the picture. Thank you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There is a male in the picture. Thank you. <br>No shit, I didn't feel like pointing out Nagisa because I didn't think you were that stupid.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure those Amagi and Hibike pictures are promotional images.</br>  <br>Well, yeah. Guess what I don't care. I probably should have used another pic for Sento because her design in the show is a bit different than the key visual but guess what.</br>  <br>They would just cut out the loli fanservice like always, and cut down on the other fanservice.</br>  <br>I've come to the realization that if I hear a manga/LN/etc that I know of is going to be animated by KyoAni, my reaction would range from relief to cautious excitement. That is, absolutely no sense of disappointment before the fact. <br><br>I don't think there's any other studio that I can say this about. Literally the only thing I would be worried about is that it means the threads will be a mess, but that hardly has anything to do with the show itself.</br></br></br>  <br> Karen, Tsukihi, Koyomi <br>but they're siblings, aren't they supposed to look alike?</br></br>  <br>Was Takemoto directly taking a jab at Shinbou here?</br>  <br> 2003  <br>That's Munto, right?</br></br>  <br>There's not a single "bad" KyoAni show.<br>There are average shows, okay-ish shows, good shows, but not a single one made me feel like I wasted my time watching it. The worst one has got to be Chu2 S2 and even that is just merely "pretty annoying at times"<br>Plus there's the guaranteed visual quality.</br></br></br>  Katanagatari was already better than Bakemonogatari. Bakemonogatari is horrible adaptation of LNs, missing lot of material and its main strength - Nisio`s language, half the interesting stuff appearing only as "black frames" or even pages of text that appear on screen for one second.<br><br>Its decent anime, but bad adaptation. Pretty much everyone could have done it better than Shaft. Most disappointing was Nekomonogatari White.</br></br>  <br> Most disappointing  <br> Not Hanamonogatari  <br>I mean Hana is really weak in the LNs but SHAFT really managed to fuck it up even more.</br></br></br>  <br> uniqueness <br>Newfag spotted.<br><br>Its same shit by Shinbo from as early as Moonphase. Nothing new, absolutely. Its even visually exactly the same in Mikagura and Nisekoi - the only difference being Nisio novels actually not being shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do I have to watch Katanagatari before or after Bakemonogatari?</br></br>  <br>How about you don't watch any of them.</br>  <br>Katanagatari proves you wrong. Even Nisio`s Medaka Box adaptation by Gainax was decent, albeit not getting to really good stuff.<br><br>If you think Monogatari is good, you are anime only (and shaft newfag, otherwise you`d be sick of that style already) fag that does not know what he misses.<br><br>Taking two major author Nisio and Narita - you can disregard Narita language and any adaptation will be great since his strength is characters and story, not fancy wording. Nisio is exactly opposite - the words is all he has and monogatari reduces it to flashing frames and theatric monologues.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where does OreMonogatari fit into the timeline?</br>  <br>Not him but<br> Implying you can get bored of Shinbou's art style. <br>People on /a/ always rewatch Hidamari and SZS and I've never heard anyone saying he was sick of it unless he was being an edge master.</br></br></br>  <br>I would actually love to see that.<br>But only if Shaft got to redo Clannad.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and it successfully killed Monogatari. Nishio after watching it, finished last monogatari novel and started Mirai-rip off instead, inspired by KyoAni work.</br>  <br>fuck you, Kore wa zombie desu ka is the best thing DEEN manage to make recently.</br>  <br>Whoa hey, Deen's Rozen Maiden isn't too shabby either.</br>  <br>KyoAni tends to adapt mediocre stories so much that I can't even imagine them adapting anything particularly exciting that actually deserves their production values though.</br>  <br>I'm not convinced. KyoAni do great work, but Bakemonogatari strikes me as the sort of thing that only Shinbo Akiyuki and SHAFT could do properly.<br><br>KyoAni Bakemonogatari would still be good, I have no doubt of that. But it wouldn't be as good.</br></br></br>  <br> Shinbo Akiyuki <br>You mean Tatsuya Oishi.</br></br>  <br>  Bakemonogatari strikes me as the sort of thing that only Shinbo Akiyuki and SHAFT could do properly <br><br>While I think that KyoAni would have been a bad choice, I also agree with the people who've pointed to Katanagatari as proof that it wasn't only SHAFT who could do it.<br><br><br>That's the thing, is I can't really think of anything specific that recent KyoAni is particularly good at outside of their production values. Like, I can't point to a certain manga or scene or anything and say "KyoAni would do that part so well."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that the author's previous work featured a morally bankrupt, non virgin, traitorous main heroine.

It's fucking weird. They don't like it. Walk up during airing day and ask for a LL ticket and tell me you couldn't feel the stares.</br></br>  <br>Are you going to a screening?

I can see him walking into a DBZ/Naruto/SnK screening though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is this any worse?</br>  So /a/ meets up and goes to love live desu?  <br>Well, believe whatever you want. I hope you have the balls to apologize in a thread after you went to a screening.</br>  <br>Why are they posing in a parking garage of all places?</br>  <br>ikr? Its the worst place for a cosplay picture. Especially for an idol cosplay.</br>  <br>Well, admittedly, I was more aloof about the fact that anime had a pretty big stigma, but highschool girls dancing is indeed worse than highschool girls fighting, even if it is in frilly dresses and with magic.<br><br><br>I would but I'm not going to the screening. Too big a pussy. We wouldn't be in the same thread anyway .

Each girl gets a decent amount of screen time. They end up traveling to New York for a bit, my hometown, so I was incredibly excited (still sour about not getting the Keions). I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though.</br>  <br>Which Raibu besides Honoka got a lot of screentime?</br>  <br> I don't want to spoil anything for anyone though. <br>How long have you been here on 4chan? We literally had a thread full of spoilers(two in fact) on release day.</br></br>  <br>It was mostly even if you ask me. Hanayo obviously gets a lot of time to whine or shout out that there's a problem. Nico got a lot of time. Rin, too. Honoka is the only one who had a disproportionate amount of screen time. They know how much people love their favorite characters so they try to give every love live a chance.</br>  <br>I'm just not an asshole. Doesn't mean I'm exactly new. It's also possible that some people have managed to avoid them.</br>  <br> You failed to answer my question. <br>Dude, in the two threads I mentioned practically everyone was *asking* for spoilers.
