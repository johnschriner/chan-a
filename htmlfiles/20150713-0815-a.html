I don't like Prisma Illya at all, I want the VN Illya.  Heaven's Feel? Is that the FS/N Dedicated Edgy route?   on the horizon <br><br>Literally 2017 at the earliest</br></br>  <br>VN Illya is superior in every way.</br>  <br><br> Ilya will never get on all fours in your bedroom asking you to explain to her how the male body works <br>Why live.</br></br></br>  <br>Hollow Ataraxia in 2020?</br>  <br>This.

When did she pilfer Taiga's dressing room in UBW?  Daily reminder that if there was an Ilya route it would have no H scenes as Ilya is a mana battery and doesn't need any extra external mana source.  <br>Yeah just as Rin doesn't need mana from Shirou.</br>  <br>Are you implying the H scene in UBW wasn't completely forced in? At least it made sense, story wise, in Fate and HF.</br>  <br>It made as much sense in UBW as in the other routes.<br>Why wouldn't the connection work in both ways?</br></br>  <br>you mean the less popular and most hated of all? No one cares about emokura.</br>  <br>Not even close.</br>  <br>She does. As a third tier antagonist.</br>  Which Fate story has perfected the Holy Grail War concept?  <br>She's a cup that you fill with your semen.</br>    <br>Try harder.</br>  <br> best girl <br> gets off on senseless murder <br><br>try again</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just realized how dangerous Shirou's household is in HA. Rider and Saber are fucking idiots when left to their own devices, Remember what almost went down because they couldn't decide what to have for dinner? Shirou's too beta to coil them, Rin doesn't care because destructing his house could be a way for her to get him to live in that big ass mansion with her and the same goes for IIya. Sakura's a god send when that happens.</br>  <br><br>Implying a best girl can't murder?<br>Those things don't exclude each other, seems someone failed logic in elementary school.<br>Also, your inability of understanding her character as a whole amuses me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How the long does it take to finish HA?</br>  <br>The hero and heroine having sex before the climactic battle is a pretty common story trope.</br>    <br>I said "senseless"<br>Saber and Rin fought out of self defense or to defeat an evil prick.<br>Sakura killed because she's a emo girl who suddenly obtained vast power and immediately got drunk on it. I'll even be fair and not pin the Shadow's initial feedings on her, since that was beyond her will, knowledge, or understanding. Her killing Shinji is justified, going into a laughing fit over how easy it was and toying with his corpse for fun is not.</br></br></br>  I wonder what Sakura's dolphin looks like...  <br> blue <br> green <br>I guess Sakura's will be red?</br></br></br>  <br>Where can you find that Sakura was OK with killing people?<br>What we get from the VN is that she resented that nobody saved her from her situation and she was ready to give up on life but decided to cling to hope because of Shirou. It was only when AM started emerging that her Dark emotions got exploited and twisted.<br><br>As you see in the other routes she never killed anyone, because she was mentally stable, it was only in HF were her emotions were exploited to the max to bring birth to All the worlds evils.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Forever. You'll be there forever. That said, It's pretty funny that Rider's punishments by Sakura are time outs in a shadow dimension while Saber's punishments are no meat dishes for a week. Honestly Saber's more like a cute freeloading gajin in HA then the heroic king arthur of legend.</br>  <br> Her killing Shinji is justified, going into a laughing fit over how easy it was and toying with his corpse for fun is not. <br><br>She did? I could of sworn at that moment she declared herself evil or something and started going even more off the deep end with fragmented thoughts. <br><br>Still why the fuck did Nasu write her to where she says she's going to try and take Zouken out with her only for the narration to pop up and say she's already forgotten the thoughts as quickly as they leave her mouth? It honestly makes it hard to tell what's going on with Sakura's head other than, she's fucked up the ying yang and things are getting worse while zouken laughs his crusty wormy balls off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The technical term is retirement.</br>  <br>thank you didnt post that but have been wondering for a while</br>  Absolutely  <br>Every inch of my body is ready.</br>  <br>Doesn't sound so bad.</br>  Yup. Ready for true heroine.  <br>Pls don't bully Rider.</br>  Not really.<br>I'd be surprised if she got more than seven minutes of screen time. <br>I'll still savor every moment of it, though.</br></br>  <br>You took the bait.</br>  <br>Literally does jack shit worthy of being called a heroine.</br>  <br>I always wondered if that shit was supposed to represent the rapeworms or something.</br>  <br>To bad for you. She is still the true heroine of the novel tho.</br>  <br>Stay delusional.<br><br>Sakura is not the heroine of Heaven's Feel. She is simply a plot device/villain made to keep the story moving forward. She does not do anything worth calling her a heroine. Yes, she does in fact have sex with Shirou, not because she is the heroine, but because she is the love interest, two different things. This is also something that sets HF apart from Fate and UBW, the heroine and love interest are not the same person, like Saber or Rin.<br><br>You probably already guessed who the heroin of HF is, but before that you might be wondering, "Why did Nasu choose make the heroine and love interest in HF different but not in the other routes? He certainly had choices between rider, Caster, Ayako, Taiga, and so on." This is because, as we all probably know, there were originally mean to be four routes, not three. He was forced to merge the Illya and Sakura route for reasons. He always meant for Saber, Rin, Sakura, and Illya to have the same about of significance in the complete Fate/stay night story, but out of no where he had to axe either Sakura or Illya. He clearly did not want to do that so he found a way to bypass it, make one the love interest and the other the heroine, something he never considered for the other routes because he did not need to merge anything back then. And why is Illya the heroine? If you read HF you should already know, or just use google-<br><br> A hero or heroine is a person or character who, in the face of danger and adversity or from a position of weakness, displays courage or self-sacrifice-that is, heroism-for some greater good. <br><br>I'm just trying to clear up a common misconception. Don't let disillusion Sakurafags fool you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is beautiful, devoted and brave.<br><br>No bully!</br></br></br>  When is Heaven's Feel chapter 3 coming out?  <br><br>You are wrong on so many levels.And you have no idea why Sakura is the true heroine of the novel. Here let me explain you:<br><br>Sakura is the love interest and a plot device for the story, all that is true. But you are missing the most imporant point here and that is that she is the key point of everything that goes on in the novel. It doesn't matter if she was the one saving the day at the end or not, a heroine in culture media these days is define by her role in the novel as the most important focus point, not by her heroic achievements. In that regards she is a tragic heroine:<br>a : the principal female character in a literary or dramatic work<br>b : the central female figure in an event or period.<br><br>Heaven's Feel is the culmination of the novel and most mature route even stated by Nasu himself, because it finally gives Shirou a reason goal to fill the void of the Emiya ideal. In HF it is were the ideal is put to test and it brings the biggest and most important change in Shirou. Shirou needs Sakura not only because he wants to save her, but also because she wil save him from the emptiness of his nature, which is basically the whole point of the VN.<br><br>Now this connects perfectly with the main theme of FSN which is the growth of Shirou as a person. The introduction of the ideal in Fate, conflicts and resolve of the ideal and the salvation of the emptiness of the ideal with HF. Shirou knows the true Sakura is a good person and this is why he risks it all against all odds. He knows who she is and why he can achieve salvation with her, because the cycle of the ideal ends with person he truly cares about.﻿</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Illya <br> Rider <br> Kirei <br><br>Too bad we have to suffer through Sakura to get to the good stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Best girl, indeed.</br></br>  <br>I now wonder what that punishment was exactly.</br>  <br>Kills all of the villains by herself. More of a heroine than Rin ever was.</br>   Cute as hell <br> Sexy as fuck <br> Loyal to the death <br>Best girl indeed.</br></br></br>  Heaven's Feel is an exceedingly flawed route hampered by a terrible heroine and a terrible "romance".<br><br>Sakura, as a character, is given hardly any time to become endearing to the reader. She is on the same level as Ayako in the previous two storylines, but suddenly she's thrown face first into the plot of HF, and her role is not a particularly likable one. It's split between mostly being helpless, with the last part of the route actually having her become the primary villain. She's a damsel who needs to be saved from Shinji, Zouken, the worms, the war, and ultimately herself.<br><br>She is pushed to the lowest of the low in the route, but unlike Saber and Rin, you don't have this established connection with her. If you saw either of those two in Sakura's state after two routes of being with them, you'd instantly be more invested in the situation than you would with Sakura, because, as mentioned, she's almost completely absent from the story before this. <br><br>This further becomes a problem due to the fact that despite her being the least developed, she's supposed to be the one who's known Shirou the longest, which actually ends up hurting the narrative as a whole. Because their relationship is already there, you, the reader, don't get to see much of the growth between them with your own eyes. You do with Saber and Rin. Shirou and those heroines respectively learn more about each other, get closer, and fall in love. With Sakura though, they're already "in love" roughly 1/3rd of the way through the route, so that whole plotline just kind of stalls right there.<br><br>This ultimately actually hurts Shirou's development in the story. Because Sakura is not shown in an extensive positive light, because you don't really see the proper development of their relationship, there's less of a connection with seeing Shirou abandon his ideals for her. It becomes more about abandoning them for the concept of a loved one, rather than Sakura as a person. She's an object. A goal. Not a character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She learned from the best</br>  <br>The heroine of HF is Illya</br>  ONE<br>SINGLE<br>90 MIN<br>MOVIE</br></br></br>  <br> terrible "romance" <br>That's a given with Nasu. He has never written any other kind of romance.</br></br>  Posting again, because fuck this gay earth.  <br> "it's okay to like Sakura now" <br><br>That's a good joke.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice try, lolifag.</br></br>  <br>Yeah yeah, show your real color, Rinfags.</br>   Rider will never ride you brutally while Sakura tongue your anus   <br>It's the truth. If it wasn't for Illya Sakura would never even get a happy end. You better be grateful that she sacrifices herself for your sins.</br>  <br><br> Terrible heroine and terrible romance? <br><br>Not sure is serious Anon.<br><br>Sakura and Shirous relationship is the deepest one in the VN even if she only showed a full appearance in the last route. Their relationship is the most mature and realistic one because it shows the tragic part of being in love. Shirou has to go tru so many troubles to save the person he loves even if he is hurt many times in the process, and Sakura showed how devoted she was to him from the very beggining of the novel, you just get the bigger picture in HF.Sakura and Shirou's relationship was well stablished during the cooking/house scenes that you probably skipped, because lolshonenboy, and it was cemented in Rain.<br><br>You are right on saying it was terrible romance tho, since what it was shown in HF was Love not Romance. In Fate we had a truly forced relationship between Shirou and Saber that basically came out of nowhere, plus it wasn't even close to realistic with Saber being a Heroic Spirit and Shirou a human. In UBW the true protagonist of the route is Archer, and Rin only has her time to shine in the fighting scenes, it was only in the Ufo adaptation that got a puch in the romantic side of her relationship with Shirou. Then in HF,what you see is Love where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it.<br><br>"I really did separate romance" and love with the heroines.<br>Romance is something where a couple blindly pursue each other's ideals. "Love," on the other hand, is something where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it. There are no ideals to be found there. It's just about coming to terms with reality. They don't even have time to dream... but you can't just keep pushing harsh realities over the hopes and dreams of young people.'' - Nasu<br><br>Also even Nasu ships Shirou with Sakura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In anime version of her route she is the one who rapes Shinji, right?</br>  <br><br>Lol, she was going to die either way. #homunculusbody.</br></br>  <br> it was only in the Ufo adaptation that got a puch in the romantic side of her relationship with Shirou <br><br>Completely full of shit. Every bit of romance in the UBW anime was in the VN.<br><br>People really undersell the romance in the route and oversell Archer. Archer certainly is an important character, but he does not dominant the story like people like to say. Meanwhile Shirou and Rin's relationship is consistently developed throughout the entire story. It just takes a minor detour on day 15 when she gets kidnapped.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer is actually out of the plot for massive swaths of the story. There's even a point where Rin stops using him as a servant because she deems him not trustworthy.</br>    Heaven's Feel feels really stitched together to me. So much of it needs to be expanded on.  <br><br>You don't need to be physically present to be the main focus of the story overall tho.</br></br>  <br>The overall focus of the story is around Shirou, with Rin trying to come and understand him and help him.<br><br>Archer is consistently an antagonist who the vast majority of the cast distrust by about halfway through the story. He gets to redeem himself by the end though.</br></br></br>    The only good thing out of HF is when Shirou literally went bone of his sword and Kotomine.<br>The rest is shit.<br>SHIT</br></br>    <br>I quite liked how spooky the beginning was</br>  <br>Gil getting rekt is always nice</br>    <br>But Sakura is the only one that didn't have sex with Johnny. You are such a tertiary.</br>    What the fuck was with those worms?  <br><br>Your mom ate them.</br></br>  <br>Zouken's version of magic circuits, or at least that's what I remember from reading this shit years ago.</br>  <br>Live insertion is a fetish.</br>    <br>If she's best girl why was she forgotten by Shirou?</br>  <br> forgotten by Shirou <br>Explain yourself. Archer DID remember her as far as I can think of.</br></br>  <br> fix my problems senpai ;_; <br><br>Shit.</br></br></br>    <br>RIN A BEST!</br>    <br>Everyone agrees that Rin is the lead female and heroine of Fate/stay night.</br>  <br>thats disgusting<br>0/10</br></br>  <br>Was this a bad end? I don't remember seeing this anywhere and I just played through Heaven's Feel.</br>      <br>You are average and don't deserve any better.</br>  <br>Fate/hollow ataraxia. <br><br>What did you think of Heaven's Feel?</br></br></br>  EDUCATED<br>PROSTITUTE</br>    <br>I loved it. My favorite of the three, I think.</br>  <br> No real answer </br>  <br>I gave you the response you deserve.</br>  <br>Rider's punishments are her being put in the shadow dimension. Sakura even does it again when she tries to fuck Waver in public and a third time when she tries to get some of Ayako''s blood again but IIya rats her out.</br>  <br>  muh ad hominem </br>  <br><br><br><br>Sakura fan please stop same fagging, there are no upvotes to be found here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone is at first excited to see the reincarnation of King Arthur, but as soon as she makes ANY mistake they say "OH IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN! You're a little girl who should be playing with dolls!" - Seriously. Every single goddamn time. In a feminist anime, she would rise up and say "no eff you" and prove them wrong, but in F/Z she takes their words to heart and starts questioning herself and her noble actions. All of the other women are either plot devices or tools. When they finally show a strong woman (the assassin) she says near the end of her life "You know I secretly always wanted to be a mother, I just didn't know it..." In any other series this would have been fine, but in F/Z it was just more icing to the cake of misogyny.</br>  <br>Well what do we know, she is a little girl. Who the hell would vote for a 15 years old grill to run anything?</br>  <br>Sakura never really shines in HF until the epilogue. She's actually quite pathetic and frustrating to deal with throughout the route. Rin is the only consistently decent girl in all three routes, and i'm not even a Rinfag.</br>  <br>You don't vote for kings.</br>  <br>Elective monarchy is just as valid ruling system as the hereditary monarchy.</br>   Fate／stay night [Heaven's Feel] [Taskohna].zip <br> https://mega.nz/#!C8EhlCiI!3EatLNdV<wbr>bq71r9HIzA2HieRX7dUN_2OvRjXztVGqUqQ<wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>The only vote that matters is that of the magic glowing laser sword.</br>  <br>How many volumes is this?</br>  <br>0, 1, 2.

The anime went full retard there.</br></br>  How did Shirou trace Excalibur in the normal ending of HF? I know he had Archer's arm, and destroyed himself in the process of tracing, but isn't it said somewhere that weapons created by the gods such as Excalibur and Ea are impossible to trace? He was on his last projection, too, so how could he have enough prana to trace Excalibur? Even Archer can't normally trace Excalibur, nor can he reproduce it with Unlimited Blade Works.  <br>I can't read chicken scratch and 'fantranslations' sound degrading.</br>  <br>Read the wiki then you dumbfuck.</br>  <br> You don't vote for kings. <br>Elective monarchy is a thing, but obviously the vast majority of people did not vote for their king. It was more generally a case of, "99% of people don't vote for kings." Arturia just became king because she could shoot magical laser beams from her sword and had a futafag wizard vouching for her, though.</br></br>  <br><br>If i remember right it's like a bootleg excalibur.</br></br>  <br>Archer can project Excalipoor, so he projected Excalipoor.</br>  <br>The wikia is fanfiction-tier, newfag.<br><br> I was fucking with you this whole time, tripfag :^) </br></br></br>  Okay, Rin. Heaven's Feel. Someone please explain to me the rationale behind her actions in her fight with Sakura at the very end. She pulls a victory out of her ass with the Zelretch sword, manages to get Sakura to the point where she's emotionally collapsing and ready to surrender, and then basically says "So you've been raped, abused, and cornered all your life, and now you're crazy. Boo fucking hoo." What the hell?! How can she not tell that this is a massively bad idea? Did Rin have a real reason to do this, or is it just her idiot-magnet status coming back to take a bite out of her bum? It makes no sense to me.  <br>Simply epic.<br>And the wikia has always been ok, except for its shitty background.</br></br>  <br> Sakura <br> Best girl <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>French wikia is significantly better. I use TMdict personally, though</br>  <br> Really? I speak french yet I have never looked it up. </br>  <br>fr.typemoon.wikia.com/<br><br>typemoon-france.tumblr.com/<br><br>typemoon.fr/<br><br>http://tmdict.com/en/#en</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin is a heartless bitch, nothing else to it.</br>  <br> Did Rin have a real reason to do this, or is it just her idiot-magnet status coming back to take a bite out of her bum? It makes no sense to me. <br><br>Yes. she was trying to amp herself up to kill Sakura there but in the end she floundered which lead to the terrified Sakura to stab her, which drives her even more crazy until shirou farts out rule breaker and dies to which IIya farts out a DEM to bring him back. God I hated that ending. I would of liked an ending where Rin and Sakura die but IIya brings back Shirou and herself traveling the world together instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't use photoshop</br>  <br> How did Shirou trace Excalibur in the normal ending of HF? <br>Excalibur wasn't created by the gods but it is still born from miracles. It is normally impossible to trace such artifacts, but Shirou and Archer can trace it to some extent due to some unexplained factors which I'm guessing is due to Avalon having Caliburn and Excalibur's memories. His traced version shatters after use and can't use the maximum Excaliblast but it is still quite powerful.<br><br> Even Archer can't normally trace Excalibur <br>Archer threatens to use Excalibur in Hollow Ataraxia even though he knows that he will immediately die after using one Excaliblast due to the magical energy required. It is also one of his attacks in EXTRA CCC but he can use it repeatedly here due to having a superior Master.<br><br> but isn't it said somewhere that weapons created by the gods such as Excalibur and Ea are impossible to trace? <br>Ea is made of some primordial materials that existed before the world was formed, so it is literally impossible for Shirou or Archer to replicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps what helped Shirou traced it is due the fact the sword became corrupted and Shirou traced that version of Excalibur. However, it still took a tole on him to do so, I would say Shirou's corrupted Excalibur is about a C rank at best.</br>  <br> I would say Shirou's corrupted Excalibur is about a C rank at best. <br> &gt;&gt;/fanfiction.net/ </br></br>  <br>I remember some anon saying that in Extra he states he made it out of earthly material which is why it's inferior to the actual Excalibur, so basically it's just a side project that HF Shirou dug out of the arm.</br>  <br>Are you seriously implying Shirou can trace at the same level as Archer? Don't be retarded.</br>  <br>You are wrong, also HA is canon.</br>  Whenever she is fighting without her master around, why doesn't Rider ever just take off her blindfold and turn all her opponents to stone? As a matter of fact, wouldn't that be good just to do that in the first place because anyone who saw them would be turned to stone anyway...  <br> Are you seriously implying Shirou can trace at the same level as Shirou after the arm was implanted on him, granting him all of archers abilities? Don't be retarded. </br>  <br>Do you also fill it with Fanta after filling it with semen?</br>  I'm looking forward to it.<br><br>Kinda bummed that they'll obviously cut out the sex scenes.

You really didn't under the point of that scene was that Sakura couldn't hide her anger and despair behind another mask, not that she loved to kill people right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is what HF cuck want to believe</br>  <br>Fuck off, Athena.</br>  Sakura is the greatest <br>My opinion&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;everyone else's opinion</br>  So when is UBW's second OST dropping?  <br>October.</br>  <br>Ahahah holy shit my sides. Who made this?</br>  <br>Holy fuck, that's why I hate 3D.</br>  <br> HD is out <br> still posting 600p versions of CGs </br></br>  <br><br><br>That Monty Python reference flew right above you two's heads, didn't it?</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't see this. Sure, there are parts of Heaven's Feel that make Rin seem incredibly callous, especially the bit where she says she hasn't a lick of sympathy for the horrors Sakura endured, but even that moment is immediately followed by Rin having one of the most enduringly Rin Tohsaka moments ever: the casual discovery that she was unable to kill her own sister until the very moment she had to do it. (Also, if you read the VN, Rin basically says that she had tricked herself into believing that Sakura was living a happy life because she wanted her sister to have a better life than she was as an orphan.)</br>      <br> &gt;Fails to understand that even if Shirou is resolved with his Fate, his fate is still to be betrayed and eventually live through an embittered lie. </br>  <br><br>The main issue is that some don't see that both sisters were at fault for their estrangement, Sakura desperately needed to get things off her chest, and let herself heal from it. Rin needed to be more honest and not say what she wanted to say to Sakura only in Shirou's presence. Even Shirou said that she should ease up and say the things she was saying to him, to Sakura. But at least Sakura tried to get the hatchet buried before things went completely to shit.<br><br>It was just a bad time for all these things to come out into the open. They honestly could have patched up years of shit with an honest, no bullshit talk. Wars aren't exactly the best place for family counseling, or which they both needed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder what the Type Moon version of Athena would look like.<br><br>We have seen Merlin, Scathatch, Ishtar, and so many mythological figures. The Greek pantheon is woefully unseen. Unless we count Herc of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is tons of greek characters already, but they cant show all of them because there is a fucking tons of them in mythology. You can write 2 or 3 HGW only with Greek servants.</br>  HF is beautiful in the sense that Sakura is absolutely irredeemable to nearly everyone else but Shirou and he alone gets to be her knight in sword skin. Hell even Rin admitted to not giving much of a damn before she gets emotional.  Any speculation as to who the other voice actors will be playing?<br><br>Hero: Shimazaki Nobunaga<br>Mashu (totally not Shielder): Taneda Risa<br>Dr. Roman: Suzumura Kenichi<br>Proffesor Lev: Tomokazu Sugita<br>Olga Marie: Toyoguchi Megumi<br><br><br>Suzumura Kenichi (Kokutou Mikiya's seiyuu)<br>Ueda Kana (Rin's seiyuu)<br>Taneda Risa (Miyazuki's seiyuu (from KnK's Extra Chorus))<br>Sawashiro Miyuki (Canaan's seiyuu)<br>Namikawa Daisuke (Waver's seiyuu)<br>Endo Aya (Kogil's seiyuu)<br>Ohara Sayako (Iri's seiyuu)<br>Shitaya Norika (Sakura's seiyuu)<br>Ogura Yui (Passionlip's seiyuu)<br>Hayami Saori (Meltlilith's seiyuu)<br>Tanaka Rie (Kiara and Kirie's seiyuu)<br><br>I have a feeling some of them will be playing one of their previous roles that might make a cameo. Also, aren't there supposed to be a lot of new servants? Most of them will probably voicing multiple servants.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably didn't need to mention this, but I was talking about F/GO</br>  Heaven's feel taught me to hate people who victims of abuse, All they do is blame others for their own problems and end up a burden to actual good people. It's the same in real life. Rin may of been bluffing herself at the end but that's actually the correct attitude to have in the world be it magus or human. If she really didn't want to kill Sakura so badly why not ice her then kill herself if it means so fucking much to her? She and Sakura caused innocent people to die just because of their own damn problems  <br> that's actually the correct attitude to have in the world be it magus or human. </br>  <br> Heaven's feel taught me to hate people who victims of abuse </br>  <br> every Shirou goes to the middle east and gets betrayed by some blue haired scumbag  <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br><br>You realize it wasn't really her that did all that right?<br><br>*Facepalm*<br>And here we see how Sakura is the most polarizing character, because simple minded people cannot grasp her personality as a whole.<br><br>First of all you say it is all Rin and Sakura fault that the murdering happened, even tho it clearly only started to happen when Sakura was under the influence of AM. Yes she was jelous and mad about her situation which is completely understandable considered she never really had a chance to live a normal life. Sakura can't change her situation, unless she's willing to destroy the rest of the world in the process, and to me that's not noble. Instead she tries to move on and change her situation by finding a normal life with Shirou, the person who inspired her to fight for her dream on having a normal life. Of course we want rape victims to get out of their situation, but at the same time you can't blame victims for not actively trying to do, because there's ALOT of psychological, societal, financial at times, mental, emotional, baggage that prevents them from doing so. In fact those emotions were explotited by zouken to break her down little by little tru her WHOLE LIFE as a Matou and she only produced some negative thoughts without corrupting her existence until the climax of HF that we all know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? He's talk about the fact that even if he chooses to save everyone, there is fundamentally nothing different between him and Archer given that what they want is impossible. The only difference is that in UBW, Shirou says her won't regret is so he probably won't try to become CG after he fails, which I'm not sure how much that mean after you're dead but at least he won't have to be summoned to fix shit forever. Fate Shirou could still regret it or fuck off to where ever he wants to and try to save people then go to Avalon, and in HF he already exited the game and is living comfy with Sakura.</br>  <br> *Facepalm* <br>Fuck off reddit</br></br>  <br><br>There is nothing that implies that Shirou decides to totally abandon his ideals in HF tho. What I understand from it is that he refuses to follow the path of the cold blooded killer in the name of Justice like Kiritsugu, as we see in the superhero bad end.<br>He still want to save people, but now he doesn't do it just because he wants to follow an ideal, but because he actually has a goal now and that is to protect Sakura. If he abandoned his ideals all together he wouldn't have told Sakura and Rider that he wanted to stop the Ritual to save innocent people as well.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Heaven's feel taught me to hate people who victims of abuse </br></br>    <br>I don't see the connection to the filename</br>  <br> completely ignoring Rin's influence on Shirou <br>She will be with him the entire time to ensure that things go right, this is something Archer didn't have.</br></br>  <br> Most well written <br> such as Sakura <br> Browses /jp/ <br>Every time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> elective <br> trusting the peasants to vote </br></br>  <br> responding to obvious shitposters </br>  <br> responding to people who still believe that UBW or Fate Shirou become Archer </br>  <br>Are you going to take this, UBW fans?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>He's not going to save everyone just because he has Rin. It is still impossible to save every single person.</br>  <br>I swear these bait images get better and better.</br>  <br> responding to people who still believe that UBW or Fate Shirou become Archer <br>Where does it say that?</br></br>  <br><br> Implying Shirou will care about what the Generic Tsundere thinks about his ideal. </br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to save every person, my point is that he will walk the road of a hero like Archer did, but actually surpass him by having no regrets and not being betrayed since he will always have Rin by his side to trust. Nasu even made this even more clear in the notes about the final episode in the UBW adaption.</br>  <br>So what? The entire point of UBW is that he realizes it's impossible, but there's nothing wrong with trying anyway.</br>  Which was the right choice?  Reminder Sakura did nothing wrong.  <br><br>UBW for kids, HF for men.</br></br>  <br>Reminder Sakura did everything wrong</br>  <br><br>Which doesn't contradict anything I've said<br> What? He's talk about the fact that even if he chooses to save everyone, there is fundamentally nothing different between him and Archer given that what they want is impossible. The only difference is that in UBW, Shirou says her won't regret is so he probably won't try to become CG after he fails <br> her won't regret is so he probably won't try to become CG after he fails </br></br></br></br>  <br>HF betters only Shirou and his own. It's the most reasonable route.<br><br>UBW/Fate betters the world at large. They're the most admirable routes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She was used and manipulated since birth.</br></br>  <br>More like HF for waifufags. Sakura had no likeable qualities and the only reason to actually chase after her was that people self-insert to the idea of giving everything up for their waifu.</br>  <br>And she became the person she was in HF. Just because her past made her into who she is doesn't mean that she's not responsible for her own actions when the entire route hammers in that she was.</br>  <br>Isn't HF for edgy self insert?</br>    <br>Yes, more specifically MoS</br>  <br>Isn't UBW for edgy self insert?</br>    <br>My opinion &gt; Your opinion<br><br>Nice try, tsunderefag.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. UBW is about Shirou following his ideal regardless of how impossible it is, because the act of walking that path is more beautiful to him than anything else. HF is sacrificing absolutely everything for the sake of one girl who doesn't even actively contribute anything while being the problem in question.</br>  <br><br>She was raped, anon. Do you not understand the trauma that does to a woman?</br></br>  <br><br>No.<br>UBW is about following a hollow ideal that will end up breaking him sooner or later.<br>HF is about the final evolution of the ideal which is fighting for a goal and happiness in your life while still fighting for what you believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, it's pretty bad, but it's not like the worst thing in the world.</br>  <br>Sorry but being raped doesn't justify massmurder.<br>Also she wasn't raped in RN, which is what's going to get adapted</br></br>  <br>Yes, but using that as an argument is retarded. "If she wasn't raped and experienced everything she did then she wouldn't have done all that!"<br><br>If she hadn't experienced everything she did then she wouldn't even have been the same fucking character, just have the same genes with an entirely different personality.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Go read the VN again, it was 'all the world's evil' using her negative emotions. She is only but a victim of the circumstances.</br></br>  <br>This one.</br>  <br>His ideal in UBW doesn't end up breaking him unless he detaches himself from everyone and regrets following his path. It's not a hollow ideal, it's an ideal in which even trying to spend your life following it is enough to be treated as an heroic act because of how many are saved through it. <br><br>In HF he's no fighting for what he believes in. In fact he throws away everything he believes in for the sake of adoptiong a new ideal that more conveniently fits the situation, that's literally the exact opposite. Calling it a "final evolution" rather than deconstructing and replacing it entirely is a fucking lie.</br></br></br>  <br>Angra doesn't have a will of it's own.<br>It's all Sakura</br></br>  <br><br>Sakura hated her situation, but that doesn't imply she wanted to kill everyone that is just your assumption.<br>AM amplified all her negative emotions and used all that to bring "all the evil of this world".<br>AM doesn't have an identity, but it does have a purpose and she used Sakura to achieve it.<br>Shirou saw tru all that and decided to believe in her and that is why he stayed with her until the end.<br>It wouldn't make any sense if what you are assuming it's true and she was inherently evil, because then the evolution of Shirou's ideal wouldn't have a meaning and ultimately the novel itself wouldn't have a meaning.﻿</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose Sakura also corrupted the grail.</br>  <br><br>Rape against a woman is one if not the most offensive crimes in the world.<br><br><br><br> Girl gets raped. <br> Never gets any help <br> Is expected to be a full functioning adult <br><br>I don' understand you people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not using her emotions, it's acting based on her emotions.

Her having a godawful life doesn't justify her taking pleasure in killing innocent people.</br>  <br><br>Not all.<br>Keep in mind AM and the grail by extension are corrupted to twist one's wishes, whatever it is, to bring All the world's evil.<br>The only thing Sakura is at fault is wanting to be with Shirou so badly, but can you really blame her after finding a tiny bit of happiness and a cling of hope next to him?<br>Sakura NEVER killed or hurted anyone in the other routes because AM didn't have the chance to turn Sakura insane and exploit her weakness: Shirou.﻿</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rape against a woman is one if not the most offensive crimes in the world. <br>Really? Didn't they used to do that all the time back then? I feel like there would be a lot worse.</br></br>  <br>Yes I can fucking blame her for it when it means several people dying, what the fuck.

They make it very apparent, especially when she's confronted later on about using the Shadow as an excuse.</br></br>  <br>Zouken is obviously a fucking dick, but no matter how shitty her past was, that doesn't justify her actions.</br>  <br><br>You know he was full of shit right? She was altered by the worms.</br></br>    <br> it was out of her control <br>Was it truly?</br></br>  <br> Am I just supposed to think that it's all okay because she wanted to find true love? <br>If by true love you mean. Not wanting to go insane, slowly disappear, and be forgot by the people closest to you after pending the last eleven years being beaten raped, and experimented on.

Also, they're considering trying to kill you.<br><br>Then yes, if you want to.</br></br></br></br>  <br> a few of this could've stopped HF entirely <br>Why didn't Sakura just go to the supermarket?</br></br>  <br>Will Sakura and Shirou kiss?</br>  <br> While seemingly no one cares <br>Shirou doesn't even fucking know.

That would be a suitably over-the-top way to finish the series, I feel.</br></br>  <br> Maria-sama watches over us </br>  I want to have my way with Maria.  <br>How can I see the highway for the songs I play like the one you posted? Also Waikyou Shenshoujing has a pretty nice route too.</br>  Where's radiant force  <br>It's the screen that comes up while it's loading the song before you actually start.</br>  <br/>  <br>I don't understand this meme.</br>  <br>Is that from the first one? Or maybe my install is fucked since I see nothing but a white box while the song is loading.</br>  <br>Yeah, first game.</br>  <br>NO I WANT IT NOW</br>  <br> that pic <br>I don't know what's going on, but I think I like it.</br></br>  <br>Opposite day.</br>  <br>Hotblooded Miku would be pretty great.</br>  <br>Initially, Iguchi was supposed to voice Hibiki.</br>    <br>I want to suck Miku's honorary member.</br>  <br>She's the most breedable geah.</br>  <br>Then get ready to be cucked by the sakimori </br>  <br> Not being able to self insert into either of them </br>  Is it just me or the sound quality on G-Beat kind of awful?  <br>Just you.</br>  I-I'm evil guys, seriously.<br><br>Stop laughing at me!</br></br>  <br> cucked <br>Stop this shit nigga, there's an /a/ equivalent that was used long before this meme became a thing.</br></br>  <br>Carol if your alchemy is so great, why didn't you revive your father?</br>  <br>I want to invade Carol's privacy when she's in the bath.</br>  Why is alpha Maria so hot?  <br>Alchemists never learn. Fists and swords will always prevail in the end.</br>  <br>That's why she has the throne and impractically large hat, isn't it? She's trying to compensate for looking like a little girl.</br>  <br>If you mean the tv version the CD is glorious.</br>  <br>I want to kneel before her throne, so I can look at her pantsu.</br>   "why didnt I get any inheritance! At least that bitch got a quest to destroy the world" <br>Classic bikkie</br>  <br>Is there a rule somewhere that says Alchemists have to look cute as fuck?</br>  <br><br>pretty sure it's a /int/ meme from a gathering of English /int/ users looking to meet up at a bar. They all completely missed one another and the whole thing was autistic as fuck. Spaghetti everywhere.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's like a frilled neck lizard or some other animal that makes itself look big.</br>  <br>They fix their broken faces with alchemy like witches</br>  <br>Isn't it a /fit/ thing? One guy posted pics of ass, another guy said "please be in london"<br><br>Turns out it was a trap.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it from /fit/?</br>  Why Little Miracle -Grip It Tight- is so good?<br>Reading the letter while listening to the song almost made me tear up.<br>It can be the best Hibiki song as for now, it is the one that has most emotion in.</br></br>  <br>Usually I don't like her clean versions that much since they are not as hotblooded as the ones used in the show but damn I fucking love this one</br>  <br>Bikki your father is probably still alive in Thailand fucking cute lady boys.<br><br>Dying Wishes don't come from people who are alive</br></br></br>  <br>Really lad?<br>The meme goes like this: if someone is or posts a picture of a girl/feminine man, you might say something like "please be in london" or "please be in san francisco"<br>This is eventually simplified into just typing the name of the city eg. L O N D O N<br>This means that typing london in capitals implies the post it replies to is in some way attractive as a girlfriend<br>It originates from /sp/ and /int/, the patrician's choice in meme boards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>my bad, I always associated it with some screenshot from /int/ which used it. In retrospect, I guess they were referring to the /fit/ thing in that thread which is where I got my wires crossed.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought /tv/ was the meme board</br>  <br>It's from /fit/ where a tripfag thought a dude posting was a girl and said pls be in London. It's old as fuck.</br>  <br>Oh no a lost child!<br><br>Every board is a meme board apart from the ones you go on.</br></br></br>  <br>/tv/ is the forced meme board.</br>   previews only come out a few hours before the next episode <br>Still hurts but at least there's a non-stop hype build-up before the show.</br>  <br>/tv/ has only a single meme that is popular on other boards, which is admittedly the strongest meme (killed at least 250 people so far) but boards like /int/, /sp/ and /fit/ have more widespread memes such as LONDON or the nation of sweden.</br>  <br><br>Symphogear has almost reached the point where it's in perpetual hype. If you could generate power from Symphogeah hype, you could power a nation. Honestly? We're just getting started, wait until the drama kicks in proper. We're in for a ride and come the last three episodes we're probably going to break our post limit records.</br></br>  <br>Did it kill more? I only knew it killed 150 from the crash with no survivors.</br>  I didn't know I was watching Kamen Rider Ryuki  <br>I can't wait honestly. Even if I was a bit disappointed with Ep2, I'm looking forward to the next episode and onwards</br>  <br> radio show, then the previews, the actual episode and then waiting for subs <br>Endless ejaculation.</br></br>  I want to see Genjuro kick some doll ass.  Did ogawa shoot the bullets out of the air?<br><br><br> nolan's dignity </br></br></br>  <br>You've been watching Kamen Rider the entire time, you just haven't noticed.<br><br>Symphogear can technically go on forever because there's a ton of different magics and artifacts around the world.</br></br></br>  <br>He shot their shadows.</br>  Question, what song is playing during the shuttle scene in the first episode?  <br> Reminder that Ogawa-san is the MC.  <br>Is Symphogear actually a harem series??</br></br>  <br> Even the courage not to cry or the [courage] to stand <br> Can become love worth crying over <br><br>guys I am scared</br></br></br></br>  Will Genjuro take the role of Hibiki's daddy?  <br><br>Following a similar pattern to season 2 to be honest. Expecting shit to keep up with the first episodes quality was always unrealistic.<br><br>Episode 2 was alright, it expanded on a few things and did some symmetry with last season (a villain telling Hibiki that she couldn't possibly understand her pain, and Hibiki hinting that she understands their pain all too well).<br><br>I expect we'll have ups and downs as always, with at least one fucking amazing moment, lots of forced drama, plenty of good moments to balance it out and generally just a crazy ride.<br><br>Not sure they can top Ver silly faces for villain tropes though. Ver silly faces made all the dark moments fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that one fucker that didnt believe when I said it was release already</br>  <br> forced drama <br>Anon please. <br><br>But yeah I expect to have lots of ups and downs. Hopefully it tops season 2 and maybe 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>RADIANT FORCE</br>  <br>To continue the alcohol fueled sexual abuse? No thanks.</br>  <br> lots of forced drama <br>Anon....</br></br>  If the big bad is not Hibiki's father I will eat my sweaty socks.  I know I'm late, but we're Symphogear A's now, right? It's always fun when the good guys get to steal enemy tech when it's usually the other way around.  <br>Right before he sacrifices himself to Dainsleif so that Hibiki doesn't die after using it.</br>  <br><br> denying forced drama. <br><br>Come on, Anon. Don't tell me you forgot the whole episode 7 bullshit from the first series? You know where Miku just decided Hibiki keeping state secrets about saving people was enough to throw her friendship away.<br><br>I love symphogear but sometimes they contrive shit for the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do Ver shitters always have the worst opinions? He was the definition of beating a dead horse.</br>  <br>Hibiki and the new girl have the same father<br><br>Chris will use the naked loli's new weapon and have implied yuri with her<br><br>Tsubasa will become useless like Maria so they can sympathize and have more development with each other<br><br>Kirika and Shirabe will save the day half the time<br><br>Genjuro will also do something awesome at some point<br><br>Miku will cuddle up to Hibiki more<br><br>Hibiki will continue to have more reverse character development to have more character development</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I wanted somebody to trust... I wanted someone to hold... <br> Somebody's large hands to praise me (It's okay) </br></br>  <br> It's just the songs that are wrong. <br><br>What is the main point to Symphogear?</br></br></br>  <br>I am so happy this didn't turn into symphogear strikers</br>  <br>What? That has been an integral part of Miku's characterization. She regrets Hibiki having to fight.</br>  <br>Forced drama is still a meaningless buzzword that can mean anything. <br>I thought that was an annoying moment too, but they're teenage girls and it was part of Miku's character.</br></br>  I like this sex hair doll.  <br>Yeah, I totally wouldn't mind if we got a new cast next season if the story with the ones we have now ends satisfyingly enough. Then when we get enough geahs we could get a big crossever.</br>  Did she escape from the Strike Witches universe?  I want the Noise to show up and fuck up these fake Noise.  <br>Commie best fansub group</br>  <br> Hibiki and the new girl have the same father <br>Nope, Hibiki's father is a bum, not an alchemist. He left because he got bullied at work until he quit. <br><br> Chris will use the naked loli's new weapon and have implied yuri with her <br>No, she will be Chris' imouto. <br><br> Tsubasa will become useless like Maria so they can sympathize and have more development with each other <br>No, Maria will become useful like Tsubasa so they can princess carry each other. At the end they'll announce they're going to tour America for a while.<br><br><br> Kirika and Shirabe will save the day half the time <br>No, they will have to argue their way into fighting again.<br><br> Genjuro will also do something awesome at some point <br>This is true<br><br> Miku will cuddle up to Hibiki more <br>So is this<br><br> Hibiki will continue to have more reverse character development to have more character development <br><br>Nope. She was pretty much forced to fight last season as well. She has always had a problem fighting other humans at first. <br><br>First it was Chris <br>Then it was DMJii and Maria<br>And now it's Alchemist loli<br><br>Each time she was forced to fight because talking didn't work. Hibiki has literally tried talking every single time. Just this time she didn't have Tsubasa or Chris telling her to just fucking transform already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me too m8.</br>  <br>And then they get married while in America, right?</br>  <br> Chris is saved by grape-kun next episode </br>   Elf nine <br><br>Where's Elf One through Eight?</br></br>  <br>It's Elfnein</br>  I want a male symphogear  <br>Yup that's what is implied by that.</br>  <br>but why would Grape-kun save her? What made Grape-kun do this</br>  <br>Nah, Tsubasa belongs to Ogawa.</br>  <br>I want JAM Project fighting the symphogeahs</br>  <br>AI YO</br>  <br> Valkyries <br> Male </br></br>  <br>Where did you get this CD version?</br>  <br> Hibiki will never just have a cool fist fight with a rival <br><br>This is really my only problem with Symphogea, it's the only thing I ever wanted and yet every season it gets farther and farther away. At least Miku finally became cool.</br></br></br>    <br> King Arthur <br> female <br>Wouldn't be the first time Japan didn't give a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>But Maria just told him she's going to have her way with Tsubasa.

She'll need her butler in America</br></br>    please remember to respect the privacy of others  <br>And that comment about "The sentinel's sword isn't just a pretty face" and Maria getting embarrassed about it.<br><br>Maria's been trying to win da tsubabowl.</br></br></br>  <br>We could always have a trap symphogear.</br>  WHAT WILL YOU DO NOW, KABUTO KOUJIIIIIIIII  <br> tfw super cool ninja producer <br> tfw you get cucked by a grandma </br></br>  ArcoNoise<br>ArcoNephilim<br>ArcoSymphogear<br>ArcoGenjuro<br>ArcoVers<br>Calling it now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does this face make me laugh everytime?</br>  <br>She already won.</br>  <br>I get that impression too.</br>  <br>She is already responsible for several deaths.

Invasion of privacy is necessary.</br>  <br><br>That would mean he wasn't like her dad already.</br></br>  <br>Why was Maria mad about this again?</br>  <br>I always thought Kirika and Shirabe were had joint hips.</br>  <br>Genjuro better get attack cards when it's his time to shine  and die. </br>  If Nanoha was around, she would have kicked that lolis ass.  <br> They're using her because they're threatening to release the identities of the other girls and ruin their chance at a somewhat normal life. So she's pretending to be a hero of justice and idol so that the UN doesn't touch the other girls </br>  <br>DELETE THIS.</br>  <br>People don't usually react positively to blackmail I guess. Become our puppet or these 3 girls get it. It was a good deal so she took it but still, throwing away your freedom kinda sucks when she finally wanted to live truthfully instead of living a lie.</br>  <br>But Hibiki was broadcast on national television. There is no way that no one figured it out.</br>  <br>Well Hibiki isn't Nanoha, she's Shirou.</br>  <br>Maria is the hero we deserve, why do people hate her?</br>  <br>America finds a way.</br>  <br>Shirou isn't afraid of fighting</br>  <br><br>Oh<br>I guess I missed that<br>I thought they were trying to help her out but had only to lie to get away with it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh wait it wasn't just national, it was worldwide. And she talked.</br>  <br>It's the gubbament. They ain't gotta explain shit.<br><br>As well as she's still treated normally at school and around town. So they never released her identity.</br></br></br>  <br><br>THANKS OBAMA.</br></br>  <br>They don't want a hero. They just want a martyr.</br>  <br>Shirou would hesitate the same way if cute girls were trying to destroy the world.</br>  <br>Believe in the government.</br>  <br>check the last thread</br>  <br><br>To be fair, Hibiki has always been kind of iffy about fighting real people, where as Nanoha was brought up by fucking Ninjas later retconned into 'body guards'</br></br>  <br> dat foot <br> Maria will never step on your dick </br></br>  <br> Mr President! Believe in your own Justice! </br>  <br>No you dont understand they echelon traced the sacrist through the babylonian armory using the power of phonic gain and action movies</br>    <br> swan song </br>    <br> s4 <br> Tsubasa and Maria are having a concert <br> After the song, the lights go out <br> Some punk with a guitar breaks onto the stage <br> "Everyone... listen to my SONG!" <br>   TOTSUGEKI LOVE HEART~ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. I don't know why you fags keep saying she was fine with fighting people.<br><br>She's never been fine with it and only did it when talking didn't work. Hell, she didn't even really fight Miku either.</br></br></br>    <br>They didnt show this niggas face  because hes dr.

That comic is stupid.</br>  <br><br>lol</br></br>  Anyone know who did the art for the cover?  <br>not for long.</br>  <br>You gotta have the kitty hair anon.</br>  <br> Hibiki's CD <br> Tsubasa's won't be released until next month </br></br>  <br>Maybe they just get powered up alongside the broken gears? I don't think the gear needs to be broken for it to be upgraded anyway. The Shirabe/Kirika gear fusion sounds nice though.</br>  <br> s1 <br> superb song </br></br>  <br>They just go on a jog with Genjuro and sing some Cantonese songs to power up.</br>  <br>He's wearing a wig<br>Its the most efficient way to pack maximum hype into one show, they will absolutely do it</br></br>  <br>S4 please bring in JAM Project.<br> MOTTO MOTTO <br><br><br>A statue to raise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ver's gone mate.

She is the most offensive Symphogear. I don't know how I'd deal with a non-offensive Chris</br>  <br>No. The new best girl is Phara. She will Sword Breaker Tsubasa's Tsubasa this season.</br>  <br> tfw nana's fat name in the way </br>  <br><br>Micah is obviously the best doll and most powerful. That's why she has to have two Gear users to fight her.</br></br>  <br>I can't even imagine Chris as anything other than an adorable little ball of fluffy, tsundere, anger and blushing.</br>  Is symphogear the touhou of anime?  <br>But Micha is obviously a retard even though she might be the most powerful doll.</br>  <br> Micah is obviously the best doll and most powerful. That's why she has to have two Gear users to fight her. <br>Two Gear users with the smallest Phonic Gain.</br></br>  <br> DMJii <br> two Gear users </br></br>  <br>Nothing retarded about liking to slice things.</br>  <br>Shirou is a sword, m8.</br>   sword is either ineffective or gets broken <br> noise beats her <br> relic gets fucked <br><br>Not a good day for her. I wonder if she'll be in shock next episode. She doesn't have Elfnein and her alchemy knowledge to tell her that it can be fixed like with Chris.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. They use two separate Gears.</br>  <br>More like they need both of them to equal one Hibike on a bad day.</br>  <br>Still waiting for MechaShirabe wielding the deathscythe.</br>  <br>They had to split Shirou into Hibiki and Tsubasa.</br>  <br> Scythe that severs souls <br> Dolls don't have souls <br>Can't wait for this to happen. I already see the reaction.</br></br></br>  so chris and tsubasa are no longer symphogeahs?  <br>Sidelined for a little while until Elfnein fixes everyone's shit.</br>  <br>She has Maria there to reassure her it's not all that bad being useless.</br>   Not transforming is actually the right move for Hibiki <br> /a/ shits on her for not loving to fight little girls. </br>  I'm starting the second season, So Fine 2.0 is here to stay? She isn't going away? Why would anyone have superior Fine die and replace her with a failed ojou-sama ripoff? Does milf ararar fine come back? At least in ghost form? What the fuck.  <br>I just realized Maria already lost her gear twice. Lots of experience to share.</br>  I suddenly feel like playing arkanoid for som.    Why are the so gay? Don't they know it's immoral?  <br>Still waiting for Combine Harvester Final Form.</br>  Not really liking Seiten Galaxy Cross, G-Beat and Little Miracle<br>All of them just seem to lack the punch their previous iterations had</br>  <br> Fine <br>Just keep watching.</br></br>  <br>Nothing gay about sleeping together, hugging and taking baths like sisters. Maria did it with them too, they just think it's normal.</br>  <br>Kinda hard to feel the punch when you can hardly hear the song and they are getting their ass beaten.</br>  <br> Even Shirou will be afraid of Phara's Sword Breaker </br>  WHY IS CHRIS SO OFFENSIVE  <br>It's moe.</br>  <br>Full version and G-Beat is fantastic and LM isn't supposed to be a hype song.</br>  <br>Talking about the tracks from the CD singles, so that doesn't really matter</br>  CUTE<br>U<br>T<br>E</br></br></br>  <br>Defective sword. Look at that rust.</br>  I NEED to molest Shirabe  Guys, I don't think my heart will be able to take it when Little Miracle is actually used in the show. Help.  <br>Fight, Symphogears. Fight until there's only one left.</br>  That G-beat intro, holy shit.  <br> Tsubasa and Maria have been alone together a lot flirting with each other in private. </br>  <br>this is basically a song of hope. Plus i think aoi will ad-lib in some part of this song while shouting her hot blooded voice just like rainbow flower. Can you handle that?</br>  <br>But then what if Hibiki is crying her eyes out while singing?</br>  <br>Then we cry with her.</br>  <br>LIKE I THOUGHT I'M NOT READY</br>  <br>Might as well post this here.<br> Even if I get hurt protecting something <br>This one should be <br> In order to protect, even if I have to hurt something  <br>She's saying she's gonna beat the shit out of Carol next time.<br><br> More!

(Let's shout) I won't be able to face the future <br>Note that 未来 or "the future" in this line is double as Miku's name.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one will be, and that will make the tears all the more real.</br>  <br>She won't be able to face Miku?</br>  <br>I know we will all be brought to tears when it happens.</br>  <br>Keep watching.</br>  I don't think they will kill Miku but either her or Hibiki are going to loose their memories of each other at one point.  Just so we are clear, is 限界突破G-beat supposed to be romanized as Genkai Toppa G-beat?  <br><br>No they fucking won't.</br></br>  <br>If this was the first time they had met, how did they choreograph an entire song and dance?</br>   been wanting to watch symphogear for the longest time <br> friend tells me there's a new season out <br> "k cool I'll just marathon the first season and see where it goes from there" <br> marathon of the first season turns into a complete non-stop marathon of both seasons, the ova's, and the two current episodes of GX <br> don't know what to do now that I'm all caught up and overdosed on hype <br><br>I feel like I'm on a really intense adderall high guys, should I get some sleep?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dress rehearsal?</br>  <br> More! (Let's shout) Unless I step forward with resolve <br>Or <br> Unless I step forward with more resolve. </br></br></br>  <br>kokoro</br>  <br>Reminder that Maria didn't say the "This sword isn't cute at all" out loud during G episode 4, so she must've said it to her again at some point.</br>  <br>Unlike DMJii, Hibiki wasn't a fucking terrorist.<br><br>Why would they try to fuck her up?</br></br></br>    How'd they manage to fuck up G-beat so bad? The music is way too loud. Even when she's shouting, Aoi is getting completely drowned out.  <br>Cliffhangers are just too strong</br>  <br>A lot of people hated her</br>  <br>Download the songs collection, Seiten Galaxy Cross, Exterminate and the new Hibiki single.<br>After hear to it nonstop until next episode, then repeat process.</br></br>  <br>The anon who translated the songs here: This anon is right, I fucked up.<br><br> Well, "you" technically isn't wrong, but "I" is probably better.   And while "Miku" and "mirai" both have the same kanji, the lyrics sheet makes it very clear it's supposed to be "mirai" here. </br></br></br>  According to his twitter, 12 hours ago, Agematsu is still not done with writing GX's songs. He said there was still one more to go.  Loli alchemist befriending when?  <br>This is correct, but I couldn't in good conscious translate the line as<br><br>Unless! (Let's shout) I step forward with more resolve.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah I remember that.<br><br>Man I kind of want to see her actually say it now.</br></br></br>  <br>I was wondering that too. At first, I thought it was geah telepathy but having her say it out loud again is simpler and makes more sense.</br>  <br>Season 1 was so good, why was G so shit in comparison?</br>  Gear gets broken right after the reveal of her transformation and battle song.  <br>They wouldn't need to put the ーみらいー there if it is just that since that's how you normally read it anyway. Like how the kanji is 運命 but the reading is ーさだめー in the above line. Zoid also said in the lyrics of Galaxy Cross, there was a part where the kanji is "fist" but the reading is "sword". This is not the first time they did this double meaning thing.</br>  <br>Production hubris.<br><br>Everyone wanted stuff, and they tried to cater to everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>What if she doesn't sing her first song again and skips straight to the second one after her gear is repaired? Which would explain why her CD is one month after Hibiki's.</br>  <br>On another note, I'm digging the lyrics of her song.</br>  Is Bikki a good role model for young girls?  <br>Not sure if Commie just invented their own lyrics there. Waiting for H&amp;D.</br>  <br>I am a little girl and I want to grow up to be just like Hibiki.</br>  Did yurifags complain endlessly to staff? <br><br>Could do without the random blushing and yuri fanservice.</br></br>  <br>This show has always been gay as fuck.</br>  <br> S1 EP2 </br>  <br>Waiting for FLAC</br>  <br> Did yurifags complain endlessly to staff? <br>And that's why the staff added the scenes of female dolls kissing random guys?</br></br>  <br>I'm jealous of those fuckers. I wanted to be absorbed by Phara too.</br>  <br>We don't need IRC in these threads.</br>  <br> not by the superior qt Garie </br>  <br>Disregard this, I suck dicks</br>  <br> that size difference <br> the way she grabs his face <br>Why did that mad that scene so erotic?</br></br></br>  <br>She's cute but older looking women are more my type.</br>  <br>I'm starting to think Miku might not have always been gay.</br>  <br>I don't like to think of any of them as gay. That implies that they would've eventually fallen for some other girl along the way, which bothers me. It's much more special if they're actually straight but eventually developed such intimate and deep feelings for each other that their love exceeded the boundaries of gender and sex. A spiritual kind of love that yearns for the core and soul of the other.</br>   still no glasses girl in the main cast <br>Do these fuckers think Sakurai was enough and they don't need any more glasses? I mean Ver is nice and all but he's not a cute girl. Shirabe, Kirika and Ogawa only wear them for a nick of time in their disguises.</br>  <br> That whistling at the start of Break Through the Limit. <br><br>Wild Arms, is that you?</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Grasper pls</br>  <br><br>It really gets you into the mood.</br></br>  <br>DEATH</br>  <br>What about Tsubasa? She had Kanade and now she has Maria.</br>  <br>I think the word you're looking for is Platonic love.</br>  <br> Most of the Symphogear staff worked on Wild Arms.  </br>  <br/>  H&amp;D's GX Ep. 2 has been "nearly done" for more than 12 hours. What's taking 'em?  <br>Tsubasa is projecting Kanade onto Maria because of the idol sempai dynamic.</br>  <br>Giving two fucks about the songs and timing isn't easy in general.</br>  <br>Well, shit.</br>  <br>Another spider got into Symphogi's room, I guess.</br>  <br>Worth it.</br>  What does Garie taste like?  <br> hair different color on either side <br><br>Who the fuck allowed this?</br></br></br>  <br>Since her element is water, I bet her kisses are real moist.</br>  <br> translating songs while im asleep <br><br>Dont worry ill catch up!</br></br></br>  <br> I want to have my way with Maria. <br><br>Tsubasa, plz</br></br></br>  <br>Will be uploading them all once they are all complete</br>  <br>Tsubasa would rather be dominated by an older women though.</br>   there will never be a symphogear fighting game made by the blazblue dev team   <br>I'd rather a Dissidia Symphogear, I suck at normal fighting games.</br>  <br> Tsubasa VS Kanade <br> Orbital Beat starts playing </br></br>  <br>I'd prefer French Bread as long as there's no one as ridiculous as Gordeau.</br>  <br>I can only see it as a karaoke-DDR combination.</br>  <br> GRIM REAPAH </br>  <br>Even now I wonder how they thought something like him was a good idea.</br>  <br>It'd be better as a musou or a MGR clone where you first get to beat up mooks and then fight a big boss.</br>  <br> There will never be another karaoke SoL episode. </br>  <br>They all have hair like that. Natural hair colors on the outside with their theme color on the inside. </br>  <br> fight a big boss <br><br>I thought you wanted a MGR clone not a MGS clone</br></br></br>  <br> Musou <br>Please no.<br>A beat 'em up would be perfect though.</br></br></br>  <br>This makes me realize that with all the mid-air combat in G we didn't see much of Hibiki's powerful steps.</br>  <br> As much as I hate when people go,"hurr x should have a game by Platinum," the people who did metal gear rising would be perfect for symphogear.<br> Also When does everyone think Hibiki's going to sing grip it tight<br> -After Miku's death<br> -After Genjurrou's death<br> -While fighting ArcKanade.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Tsubasa consistently has the best songs.</br>  <br>But her personality like a trash.</br>  <br>As expected of Nana.</br>  Green: Flamenco<br>Blue: Ballet<br><br>What is Yellow dance supposed to be? Also what's Red's going to be?</br></br></br>  <br>KE-N-YOOOOOO &gt; *</br>  <br>But Seigi wo Shinjite was the best song of the main trio and Waikyou Shenshoujin was the best song of G overall.</br>  <br>Both her and Hibiki for me.

Bloom Diva suddenly inflicting effect damage against Dennis comes to mind, amid other cards that get changed to their IRL effects.</br>  So why didn't Yuya summon Odd-Eyes Rebellion?<br><br>Is it really only exclusive to EGAO duels?</br></br>  <br><br>He need Creation and destruction for that</br></br>  <br>Which he only ever draws when he's in his Yuto state</br>  <br>Like Alexander losing his bonus attack eff</br>   You will never have these many cuties cheering for you whenever you do well in card games    What card can flip a trap to face-down position?   <br>Which is kinda close to the state he was in just now. He tends to go entermates when his friends are around and dragons when he (thinks) he's alone. Why?</br>  <br>I wonder what's the Pendulum Pair when he enters Yugo state.</br>  <br>Why would you not attack 3 times if you have the chance?</br>  <br><br>Malfunction</br></br>  Does this look like a Yuzu?<br><br>Maybe he's weaning off his Yuzu.flac</br></br>  <br>Probably gonna be a pair of wizards that look like Yugo and Rin</br>  <br><br>It can only attack 3 monsters</br></br>  <br>As a comparison, Yuma has lost 34 times over the course of Zexal (9 on screen).</br>  <br><br>It's a Mieru</br></br>  <br><br>What?<br><br>On screen losses he has Yuzu (if that even counts), Reiji and now Jack. I don't remember any other losses</br></br></br></br>  <br> pinkish hair <br> fringe <br>Eh, close enough.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish Yuya would eventually defeat Reiji. But it probably won't happen and Reiji will lose to somebody else and develop that way.</br>  <br>Well it's got Pink hair</br>  <br><br>DARINGU</br></br>  <br>anon probably also meant his offscreen tournament losses that were shown in episode 2.</br>  <br><br>This rather looks like an entermage<br> It's eff would also fit better into entermage </br></br></br>  <br>From his duel record in the second episode<br><br>And that anon is wrong anyway, Yuya has lost 24 duels + Yuzu, Reiji, and Jack which makes 27</br></br></br>  <br>MORE MIERU WHEN?</br>  <br>Shun, please man.</br>  <br>Wait, what? Who're you referring to?</br>    <br>After having to listen to her crush go on and on about how great some other girl was? Probably never.</br>  <br>Damn it Yuya when will you get a Tuner monster<br><br>Pendulum Synchro would be so based. I can even hear Kensho Ono saying "SYNCHRO SHOKAN" in my head, I just need to see it happen</br></br></br>  <br>Yuya looks so fucking good whenever he takes his swag-cape off. I love his body.</br>  <br>Never hopefully</br>  <br>Masumi would only reappear to die for Yuzu or get killed by Yuzu.</br>  <br>Will we eventually see him hugging Yuzu without his cape? I mean, that way Yuzu can properly appreciate his body.</br>  <br>Why is that skirt so hot</br>  <br>Somebody put me out of my misery</br>  <br>LITERALLY<br>SEX<br>It's not a shirtless scene, bu I guess it does the job.</br></br></br>  <br>Even if I am a Yuzu fag, that is just a Mieru reference for her fans, I mean come on. Also based Y. Aoi</br>  <br>Dem dragons wanna mate</br>  <br>Being Ruka is endless suffering</br>  How would everyone react if Jack actually lost from Rune-Eyes?  <br>Isn't that what that anon implies?</br>  <br> twig composure with ridiculous chest <br>What in the world</br></br>  <br>Perfect masterrace EGAO genes</br>  <br>How their reacting in your image.</br>  So it looks like Yuzu and Yugo run into the arena to help Yuya<br><br>I wonder how he'll react to seeing her with Yugo</br></br>  <br>I really miss Mieru.<br>I hope she return for the last arc or the series.</br></br>  <br><br> clone stole my citrus <br><br> so I'll stole hers <br><br> LET'S GO TO ACADEMIA GUISE </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He sounded like he wanted to punch Jack in the face</br>  <br>I think it's more like Jean is gonna catch them and the board let them stay.</br>  <br>his*</br>  <br>They are in the arena</br>  YUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA   OP changes to reflect JOHANNN being missing <br> Everybodys EGAO is gone <br>Greatest love story in history</br></br>  <br>Roger gets mad and smacks his chessboard at one point - do the council fuck him over, or does Jack intervene and punch out the Security shitters? Either way, it looks like Chess-kun does not get his chekkomeito next weekend.</br>  <br><br>What did Crow say in Yuya's mind? Sounded like he had something to say about Jack.<br><br>WHY THE FUCK HAVEN'T WE SEEN CROW'S REACTION TO JACK THIS EPISODE</br></br></br></br>  <br>We did, at the very beginning<br><br>He called Jack a traitor</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why won't Yugo get ported away?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, lots Action duel naturally makes a great body.</br>  <br> Implying there will not be another Mieru in each dimension. <br>But I miss Mieru too.</br></br>   Still no Yusei <br> Probably no Yusei <br><br>Fuck this shit</br></br></br>  <br>He called him a traitor of the commons. <br><br><br>Bracelet has a range.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit I missed the beginning of the episode</br></br>  <br>Because Yuya will. <br>Bracelet ships Yugo/Yuzu.</br></br>  <br>Wait for the great appearance of Lancers B team.</br>  <br>I wonder if Yuya will get an arc where he's the villain like Jaden</br>  <br> Previous MC <br>That is not how it works.</br></br>  <br>Yusei would steal the spotlight, and he's a previous MC.</br>  Is it just me or are Raidraptors pretty fucking cool?  <br>Seems like the shilling is affecting you just as planned.</br>  <br> inb4JudaiYugi <br><br>I mean I get that, but it's not like Yusei didn't play a pivotal part of their lives, in what they're playing off as an alternate reality. It's almost off putting</br></br></br>  <br>I want this, I enjoyed judai being a villain.</br>  <br>Possibly. The whole Yuya/Yuzu thing does have striking similarities with Judai/Johan, aside from one being gay and one not being gay.</br>  <br>No, that's when they introduce the participants the next day. Yuya was dueling at night.</br>  <br> Sawatari will get BTFO by Yuya similarly to how Jim lost to Haou Judai, and Sawatari will get carded. <br> Gongenzaka will force a tie with Yuya, sacrificing himself to make Yuya EGAO, so Gongenzaka also gets carded. <br> Yuya cannot EGAO because he basically killed two of his nakama. <br> One of them being Gongenzaka, who is basically the 2nd most important friend in his life after Yuzu. <br> Yuya tries to duel without using Pendulums in one episode because MUH ZETSUBOU. <br><br>I prefer Edge Mode Yuya to MUH ENTERTAINMENT Yuya.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's Yuzu who goes evil instead </br>  <br>Yuya isn't there. Which make me think Yuya isn't one of the participants. Also since Yugo is out in the open we can all expect a 'Yuya!' from the Lancers team at least.</br>  <br> They both go evil together <br> Rule a new world of overflowing darkness and pain while holding hands </br></br>  <br> If this card is in your hand: You can Fusion Summon 1 Fusion Monster from your Extra Deck, using "D/D" monsters from your hand as Fusion Materials, including this card. <br><br>He inspired by Reiji?</br></br></br>  <br> Jim <br><br>Fuck man. I forgot how much I liked that guy.</br></br></br>  <br>*He was</br>  <br>I loved his nicknames<br> Tomorrow Girl <br> Dino Boy </br></br></br>  <br>Wrong image</br>  <br><br>Crow is pretty much side character Yusei anyway so no need for two Yusei's</br></br>   Melissa facing the crowd on the long sides of the arena <br> People on the two ends get her huge holographic butt in their faces <br>How lucky do you have to be</br></br>  <br> Gongenzaka will force a tie with Yuya, sacrificing himself to make Yuya EGAO, so Gongenzaka also gets carded. <br>I really want this to happen again.</br></br>  <br> Yaiba v Gon-chan was a fucking great match <br> The dub will ruin it with shitty accents, some kind of sword puns, and Gon throwing in one line about "having a blast" or some other shit like that <br><br>RIP in piece Yugioh popularity in the west</br></br></br></br>  So<br> Special Summoned Aria and a Fusion Melodious <br> Have a Poly and Defusion <br> Can you use any of those cards with Aria effect being applied? </br></br></br>  <br> implying Gon won't get an archetype Relay Soul to take a gorillion shots from Antique Gear Soldiers as he holds off Academia for Yuya to escape </br>  <br>You can use Poly, because it doesnt target, its like Dark Hole. Cant use Defusion whilee Arias on the field</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Why won't Gongenzakafags fuck off? He only lost to Yuya, the main character, which is by far not a bad feat.<br><br>Meanwhile, Yuzu lost to Masumi, Dennis, would've lost to Yuri and probably Halil. Yuzufags had to take way more.<br><br>I hope Crow beats him just because.</br></br></br></br></br>  How come nobody is on about how OP Reiji is? Seriously, the guy seems like he's playing with his damn food whenever he's dueling.  <br>Because they're all Lancers who ate the 2000 LP intrusion penalty that he left on their Duel Disks.</br>  <br>Shuzo mentioned it was ridiculous that in less than three years Reiji taught himself Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Summoning during his first duel against Yuya, and everyone is legitimately afraid whenever they have to go up against Reiji KNOWING what he's capable of. Barrett was the only one who didn't show cowardice dueling him, and even Dennis had a moment of sudden shock seeing Reiji UNLEASH.</br>  <br> Almost gets otk'd by random fodder </br>  <br>I fucking love Reiji<br>  D/D need more high scale pendulums though  </br></br>  <br>You should not focus on constant pendulum summoning.<br>Kepler is enough for that.<br>You have enough low scales by running the essential monsters in the deck as well</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty obvious that he was holding back.<br>Then again, it seems like he's holding back in literally every duel he's faced</br></br>  <br>HANATE REIJI</br>  <br>I know that. I actually have 2 DDD decks. One which does all plays and one i tried to build around pendulum summoning. Even then i want more D/D monsters, their design and naming is awesome</br>    <br>OH YES!</br>  <br/>  Does any of you even play the actual game or is it all YGOPro now?  <br>Dr. Fudo, I'm KING.</br>    <br>Reji is legit scary, His deck not only runs all the summoning methods baring advance and ritual but they run them in such a way you need to do him fast or it's over.</br>  <br> advance <br>He has advance summonable monsters, he's just always been able to pendulum them up to now</br></br>  <br>Another DD synchro would be ideal. A high level one like lv9-11.<br>Standard combo Night howling&gt;grab Armageddon&gt;Grab DDD would have an even better payoff</br></br>  <br>So the only method he doesn't have is Ritual?</br>   Gon faces CROW on the first episode <br> Yuya, Sawatari, Yugo, Serena, Yuzu and BENNIS :DDDD all face fodder </br>  <br>It's a reverse of the Miami Championship. Gon gets an important opponent while Yuzu will face Nega-Yuzu.</br>  <br> Niggerwings vs Superheavy samurais <br>What kind of a match up is that?</br></br>  <br>Remember when Masumi could be considered remotely important. Good times.</br>  <br>Remember Marco-sensei?  Its ok, neither does she </br>  <br> Kurosaki -sensei a best</br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br> Tfw actually liked Hokuto and his shitter constellar plays and Yaiba's xsaber spam <br> Reiji picks Sawatari instead of Yaiba or Masumi to synchro dimension </br></br>  <br>I wonder if we'll ever actually meet Marco-sensei.</br>  <br> does combos with Entermates <br> wins <br> tries to sledgehammer opponent with dragons <br> loses <br>Hmmm</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or rather he deems it useless, I bet he can do it like the others special summons but he just don't want/need to use it.</br>  <br>He's just not using the right dragons<br> right? </br></br>  duel me  <br><br>It's just that one autistic Crowhater. He's probably not even a real Gonfag. <br>Gonfans know that Gon doesn't need to win every single duel and that his cards get shilled quite decently enough compared to other people</br></br></br>  <br><br>Performapals &gt; Magicians confirmed</br></br>   yfw the movie reveals that Kaiba is basically responsible for Arc-V   <br>Based Kaiba</br>  <br><br>movie trailer where</br></br>  top 5 duelists according to pegasus:<br>Yugi<br>Kaiba<br>Jonouchi<br>Edo<br>Johan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we can all agree that Melissa butt is best butt.</br>  after yesterday's survey, here's the tourney. Bad anime archetypes won the vote handily, with all the other rulesets coming close to each other.<br>http://challonge.com/tomo10<br>tourney will be next saturday.</br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>I think Jack could defeat him. Maybe.</br>  <br>Not what I'm looking for but thanks.</br>  <br>I haven't watched 5Ds in a while. Why is Crow so hated? Is it the Blackwings because I hate those as well but that doesn't seem like the only reason.</br>  <br>He didn't put Judai in the list? by season 4 he was better than everyone so far except Yugi and maybe Kaiba.</br>  <br><br>muh Aki</br></br>  <br>With access to proper support and all the summoning methods, Jack would be untouchable.</br>  <br>Buttblasted waifufags.</br>  <br>Nothing all that bad about the character in and of itself, it's just that they derailed the story to introduce him and he was a sign og things to come in part 2.</br>  <br><br>Funny thing is that part 2 Crow was more enjoyable than part 1 Crow</br></br>  <br>I think he could defeat Jack with his current deck, Scarright counters DDD hard (And pendulum in general, really). And we know the duelists from the alternate dimensions are better than Standard duelists, I doubt one could stay King for any significant amount of time in Synchro dimension without being insanely good.</br>  <br>I'm assuming you mean that he could defeat Reiji</br>  <br><br>Yep,sorry, meant "I think he could defeat Reiji"</br></br>  yfw action cards are added to speed world neo  <br>There is one man who could beat him</br>  Damn, Yuuya got trashed. <br><br>I guarantee that Yami will be some next level of OP after this movie. Kaiba too.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd prefer if speed counters came back</br></br>  <br> filename <br>Huh. It is kind of like Mario Kart, isn't it?</br></br>  <br>Not with Pendulums existing</br>    <br>When I saw that, I thought that I could be wrong about Jack easily stomping Yuya, that tomato could use action cards to his advantage and that Jack wouldn't be able to figure them out. Nope, Kingu still stomped. I just wish that the speed world action field instead of having action cards lying around, had like goal lines appearing in the track and that crossing them gave you an action card or something like that.<br><br><br>He did get thrashed. He's tied with Judai for YGO protagonist with most confirmed losses, one more and he'll me the biggest MC loser in the franchise history.<br><br>Yami and Kaiba will probably get updated and really powerful decks, but given that Dark Magician and BEWD won't be retrained and will still be an staple of their decks, I wonder how OP they can really be unless they get some really, really broken support for them, and even then. Also, if both characters get absurdly OP, it won't seem like it, OP characters need a jobber in order to show the true extent of their abilities.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pegasus' statement about his top 5 duelists occurs in a flashback (shown in episode 107 of GX, when Judai is dueling Johan) I assume the flashback predates Pegasus meeting Judai in Season 2 of GX, but I don't think the show clarifies it.</br></br>  <br>I thought we told you to fuck off to /dng/</br>  <br>and I thought I told you I don't care about what you said.</br>  <br>Aren't you that one guy who posts awful futa transformation caption stories on /d/ and has no idea how to write smut?</br>  <br>Back to /dng/ faggot.</br>  <br> Posts off topic <br> I DUN CARE, I DO WHAT I WANT </br></br>  <br> yugioh animu tourney <br> offtopic </br></br>  <br>Nah, I am a Gonfag. I just also hate Crow. Crow coming back and beating Arc V characters that I actually like, knocking them out of a tournament preventing future duels in it and making them face whatever the fate of losers is makes me mad. Also I'm sick of Blackwings. Unless they plan on making them top tier which they aren't, what's the point of more Blackwings.<br>Also I want to see Gon riding duel more than a single time. This tournament is the only chance I'll get to see it.</br></br>  <br>I agree with him, fuck off back to /dng/ and stay there.</br>  <br>You talk as if Gon would be winning if they paired him off against someone besides Crow. He wouldnt; there's no point in Gon advancing in the tournament, as opposed to someone like Crow who's a syncro native who knows Jack. Gon has dueled a fuckton lately, more than Crow or most other characters.</br>  <br>mmm, yeah, I think I'll post an animu tourney on the animu thread about the game.<br><br>stay mad tho.<br>http://challonge.com/tomo10</br></br></br></br>  My god, too much chaos here. I remember the old times where 4chan was more of a cool place.  <br>He's part of the official unofficial main trio. I think that means plenty.</br>  <br>Arc-V has a fucking ton of trios to the point they don't matter anymore.</br>  <br>And you'll eventually get banned just like the guy who kept spamming his shitty strawpolls.</br>  <br> banned for posting on-topic <br>u wot?</br></br>  <br>There's no point in anyone other than Yuya and Yugo advancing in this tournament. Most of it is practically filler. It's there to show off the Lancers capabilities. Crow being a Synchro native doesn't mean much. What is the point of the other Lancers being in it? Nothing but filler. That's what. I want to enjoy my filler thank you very much.</br>  <br>It's not on-topic. You're encouraging outside-thread bullshit that isn't needed here. We're a general, but we don't need the faggotry that comes with it.</br>  <br><br>I am a Gonfag as well, but I'm still happy that at least he's going to get some screen time in a duel vs Crow. Don't be too offended by the fact that he *might* lose. If that does happen, maybe he'll get involved in that subplot you mentioned, which might be a good thing.<br><br><br><br>Well, you can't compare a character from day 1 to one who's just appeared, can you? I'd say Gon has roughly the same number of duels to Shun's, a tiny bit more than Yuzu's.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These threads are actually pretty chill most of the time, at least in comparison to the rest of the site. We've just had that shitposter a few times lately, the strawpoll guy, and early on we had sad-straight-virgins-kun, who seems to have been banned or just got bored.<br><br><br> &gt; Crow being a Synchro native doesn't mean much <br><br>I think it does, just not enough to get him to the finals. But he's pretty much guaranteed to beat Gon, we know that alternate dimension natives are better at their summoning methods than people taught by LDS, and Gon was taught by someone who was taught at LDS.<br><br>By the way, is anyone else sad Yugo is doomed to lose against Yuya? Poor guy is cursed to never be able to leave the Commons, unless it is as a .wav in Yuya's head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's no point in anyone other than Yuya and Yugo advancing in this tournament <br> Most of it is practically filler <br>You dont know what that word means. Some people like Crow and Shinji advancing has a purpose because they have plot related goals for it (rousing the commons, possibly confronting Jack). Dennis is a spy, him making it further is self explanatory. Gon meanwhile has no stake in the universe besides following Yuya, no set up character depths to exploit and no existing relationships with Yugo, Jack or anyone important. The most useful thing he can do to the story is lose to someone</br></br></br>  <br>As long as people keep shunning the faggotry that normally comes from a general, I think we'll stay okay.</br>  <br> Well, you can't compare a character from day 1 to one who's just appeared, can you? I'd say Gon has roughly the same number of duels to Shun's, a tiny bit more than Yuzu's. <br>I said lately, he's dueled far more than Crow since the episode Crow was introduced.</br></br>  <br>don't forget the gore spammer, who spammed in /a/rc-v and sarada threads</br>  <br> outside thread bullshit <br> the yugioh card game <br> is outside thread bullshit <br> in the yugioh fucking general </br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't gore poster get arrested?</br>  <br> By the way, is anyone else sad Yugo is doomed to lose against Yuya?  <br>He's just so adorably dumb, I don't want to see him go</br></br>  <br>Still not seeing you talk about the anime. At all. You have the card game specific thread, go use that.<br><br>Of course, I'm not talking about the anime either anymore, so I guess you successfully baited me.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree, this whole thing where character development episodes are dismissed as filler unless they directly move the MC towards the next arc. Character development and exploration can be very important to set up future action by characters, and honestly I really want to see all of the lancers have a riding duel at least once. Plus the friendship cup is the perfect vehicle to learn more about synchro society and the aspirations of the commons and the tops, which is an important plot point, after all, the Lancers are there to gain Synchro's alliance.<br><br><br> &gt;general <br> &gt;anime discussion being the same thing as card game discussion <br><br>fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go back to /dng/</br>  <br>Whatever you consider plot related. Rousing the Commons does what in the fight against Academia. Crow isn't going to fight Jack and even if he does, it's still going to be Yuya that actually succeeds. <br>Crow is terrible so who gives a fuck what he does, the most useful thing he can do is get carded and get out after shilling his Blackwings.</br></br>  <br>Uhh, I'm counting the one duel with Dennis in ep 57 and that's pretty much it... So I wouldn't say far more.<br><br>Are you taking into account his tiny appearance in the duel vs Arrest Cop in the recent ep as well?</br></br></br>  Is the sex cult scandal still to recent for a Carly cameo in the audience cheering fir Jack louder and more passionate than his legions of fangirls?  <br><br><br>yes, because this thread is all purely about the anime, because 'that anon posted gore' 'I want a yuzu' 'yugo is adorably dumb' is really talking about the anime, FAR more than discussing and/or playing decks specifically shown off in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>The what?</br>  <br>Still not seeing you talk about the anime bruh, all you're doing is bitching that people don't like what you're trying to push.</br>  <br><br>I would love to see Carly in Arc-V, but I just don't think its feasible to expect her.</br></br>  <br>The sad-straight-virgin-kun wasn't the one who started it's post with a vaccumm or some shit like that?</br>  <br> is really talking about the anime <br>More than you at least, go back to /dng/</br></br>  <br>because I'm posting anonymously. for all you know several posts on-topic in this thread were mine, I just happen to also be hosting an anime tourney.</br>  <br>Cult scandal. And her original VA got arrested, so I think she'll be unlikely to appear.</br>  <br>Here have some pasta.<br>Ignoring Shin "No females Dueling in this Work" Yoshida probably recasting personalities, one of the more bizarre points in 5D's is the sheer disappearance of cult like elements from 5D's right around the time Demak vs Rua and Ruka entered.<br><br>It appears it was probably tied back to the ultimate firing of Li-Mei Chiang due to her connections to the ロマゾフィー協会 cult (The Roma-Sophie Society), which was basically a hyper sexist cult that basically brainwashed a lot of women (and had them as in home slaves and for their lighter crimes, forced women to wear Mini-Skirts for the proper spiritual energy).<br><br>It appears that the actual arrests and investigations might of been on going from around the mid-way of the first season of 5D's was in production. And likely Chiang's cult connections were likely known on some level by the 5D's production staff, so.<br><br>They likely probably wanted to avoid any connections with Chiang's crazy ho ha if/when it came down. Probably also PTA/Concerned parent complaints about children's show subject matter. (5D's was a kid's show, was on a kid's time slot, and sells cards to elementary school children as part of its market audience).<br><br>Basically having an ancient star cult sekritly running the world, Demak being from apparently an Earthbound God death cult, and the Arcadia Movement being one of the most blatant cult/new age religion things probably to be in a children's work:<br><br>Huge no no. Especially when a major supporting actress is in a drug-addled sex/slavery cult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is the sex cult scandal still to recent <br><br>Considering that regarding Pokemon, Porygon (and its evolutions) haven't appeared since that one banned episode, and that is well over 10-15 years old, I think that the sex cult scandal related to 5Ds and Carly's VA would be deemed too recent.<br><br>Granted Pokemon is different to YGO but I seriously doubt Carly will appear since when Japan gets triggered by stuff, it never goes away.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your posting style is incredibly obvious, dude. All you're doing in this thread is pushing your garbage tournament and bitching about people not liking it. And yes 'I want a yuzu' 'yugo is adorably dumb' are more anime related than your shitty tournament.</br>  <br>okay buddy, here's a cookie. you like cookies? yeah, I bet you do. why don't you run off and play, the short bus will be here soon to drive you off to your lessons in comparisons and understanding what makes things similar or different.</br>  so how long until shun and serena go full tsundere for each other?  <br/>  <br>Now you aren't even close to being related to the topic. You just sound upset that people don't like your tournament now.</br>  <br>it's okay, buddy, just enjoy your cookie. once you learn about discerning how things would be considered on-topic, we can continue this discussion.</br>  <br>Nobody likes tournaments anymore, we had<br>enough with the TFS tournaments.</br></br>  So. A Ruri cosplaying BMG or another cardfu will save the thread right?<br>Or just the KING is enough?</br>  <br>Still not seeing any YGO related content in your post.

I hate every single one of you faggots who forced that anon to stop them.</br>  <br>Why they are so perfect. It is fate?</br>  <br>I've been posting on-topic, actually, they're just being lost among your whining and bitching and my refuting.<br><br>now, it's rude to talk around a mouthful of cookie....and why did you take your helmet off?</br></br></br>  <br>They overtook the threads from the actual anime discussion, especially after Sawatari won and people got butthurt he didn't get into the OP even though he wasn't even appearing in the show at the time.</br>  <br>Having like 4 threads in a row filled with it was overkill.<br><br> every single one of you faggots <br>With this is like you're the problem, not us.</br></br></br></br>  <br>those were the best</br>  <br>Faggots like the guy trying to push his tournament now are the real problem.</br>  <br> Rousing the Commons does what in the fight against Academia <br>Creating a better society that'll be able to help standard fight Fusion, or whatever the true end boss is<br><br> Crow isn't going to fight Jack <br>Crow being there allows the audiance and Yuya to learn more about Jack from him<br><br> Crow is terrible so who gives a fuck what he does <br>What's wrong with Arc V Crow?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>gon needs a trap that banish itself when it leaves the field</br>  <br>TFS tag duel tourney<br><br>yes/no</br></br></br>  <br>I made one post, and got 5 people telling me that yugioh is not related to yugioh.<br><br>but sure, the entire reason the anime still exists is totally unrelated. mhm.</br></br></br>  <br>With comments like that, it makes it obvious you belong in /dng/.</br>  <br> The TFS tournaments were fun. <br>I agree<br><br>  I hate every single one of you faggots who forced that anon to stop them <br>One was enough. I dont think people needed to get salty about it towards the end of it, but there wasnt anything to be gained by doing more<br><br><br> especially after Sawatari won and people got butthurt he didn't get into the OP <br>It was a few mostly joking posts at the start of the thread, not an epidemic</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  C A R D I A N S <br>A<br>R<br>D<br>I<br>A<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have a thread entirely dedicated to the card game. Use that. This is for the anime. So yes, a shitty tournament IS unrelated to this thread.</br>  <br>Not that Melissa isn't cute, but I feel like a commentator like Gallager would've been a better fit for the kingu's duel.</br>  <br> &gt;Crow is terrible so who gives a fuck what he does <br>He still uses Blackwings. Also my 5D Crow PTSD acts up when he's around</br></br>  <br><br>You call that autism</br></br>  YAMEROOOO  <br>I feel bad for Enjoys VA. He shows up to do some shitty card game commercial, and has to spew off insanely long card names all day<br><br><br> but I feel like a commentator like Gallager <br>Gallagher does illegal gambling duels. Mellisa a qt with plenty junk in the Junk Warrior, thats what the audience really wants</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if Sawatari is the one to defeat Evil Egao.<br><br>...by getting cardad, finding his way into Evil Egao's deck, and then being a dead draw for Evil Egao when he needed to topdeck.</br></br></br>  <br>You shouldn't feel bad unless he does it for free.<br><br>I bet he ENJOYS his job and so you should too!<br><br>KOI KOI KOI KOI KOI</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>KOI KOI KOI KOI</br></br>  <br> &gt;Gallagher does illegal gambling duels <br><br>Speaking of which, he ended up being a three episode character with not that much of a role since the lancers ended up reuniting and going to the friendship cup by getting arrested, anyway. For a character with a big place in the OP he seems a bit irrelevant. I'd say he'll appear later, but I don't see where he could possibly fit, given that he's unneeded while the cup lasts and that I don't really think the lancers will stay in Synchro for long after the cup ends.</br></br></br>  <br>why the fuck not? It's been a while since last one anyway, put Yuya/Jack on team to celebrate them(hopefully) working together at some point</br>  <br>Yeah autism. I'd rather get Lancer development than whatever the fuck Crow does. Gon struggling with a duel style that he's unfamiliar with then coming to terms with it then winning is better for me. If I wanted fucking Crow then there's 5Ds.</br>  <br> not yuya/yuzu </br>  <br> overtaking the threads with that shit again <br>Doesn't matter how boring the threads get to you, we don't need that.</br></br>  <br>It would only take half a thread and it's one time only</br>  <br> Gon struggling with a duel style that he's unfamiliar with then coming to terms with it then winning is better for me <br>For someone who was bitching about duels being filler, that is an actual example of a filler duel. What does Gon do then? He's a narrative dead end<br><br><br>People hate them now, it isnt worth it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One time will become "what's one more?" and you know it. Just talk about the fucking anime instead of keeping on trying shit like this.</br>  <br>Not that anon and I don't really mind if Gon loses, but I feel like Crow losing and meeting the loser's fate would mean that Gon winning would still move something in the story. <br><br>There's not a lot known about Shinji, but he seems the type to wait and bide his time. However, for some reason he's making a pretty drastic and ballsy move during his duel that probably guarantees he won't be allowed to continue in the tourney even if he beats Tsukikage, which makes me think something bad might happen to Crow.</br></br></br>  Look I think everybody can agree that between Crow and Gon, I don't care who wins but the most important thing is that the story manages to make something good from it. The plot is the most important thing here<br><br>However, if Crow starts shitting on Gon for whatever reason if he wins, that's not going to be cool. Not at all. This is why I feel it would be safer if Gon won since he wouldn't do that and we'd get some character development from Crow.</br></br>  On the nature of filler duels. In a tournament setting, I don't think any duel can be considered filler because that's like saying you can skip parts of a tournament with main characters.<br><br>Realistically everybody knows the main character will make it to the finals. That's how it is for all toyetic commerical anime, so what's the point of the rest of it? It's to see multiple characters duel.<br><br>Filler duels come in the form of things that aren't involved with the main story and never get referenced again like Eita or that one stretch of 5Ds</br></br></br></br>  <br> However, if Crow starts shitting on Gon for whatever reason if he wins, that's not going to be cool <br> This is why I feel it would be safer if Gon won since he wouldn't do that <br>Christ, Gonfags are the most hysteric people in these threads. Where the hell did you get the impression that either Arc V or 5Ds Crow would take a shit on someone he beat or whatever you're worrying about. What kind of scene are you envisioning happening that'd be so triggering?</br></br></br>  <br> still no   regulus-dono </br>  If there was a place in Yu-Gi-Oh that you could live where would it be?  <br>I never said, it wasn't filler. I only said that I'd rather have filler that I'd actually enjoy. Also how does it not become filler if Crow wins. Gon winning is the best way to show the power of the Lancers. No super secret summoning methods and just winning on skill alone.</br>  <br>I'm only offering it as a thing. I'm not saying it would happen.<br><br><br>Any answer other than Heartland is wrong. That place is incredible</br></br></br></br>  Purer than your waifu.  <br>Purer than you.</br>  <br>Tell me about it, my waifu keeps getting sluttier and sluttier and I don't know what to do.</br>   Anna <br> pure </br>  How long until her purity gets desecrated and she herself feels the power of c*ck?  <br>Anon,<br><br>Ignorance =/= pure<br><br>Ayame is the purest because shes fully aware of all the lewd things in the world but stays true.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pure </br>  <br>You are way to late for that.<br><br>She's literally a succubus, she already knows cocks.</br></br></br>  <br>Staying true to the path of being a slut=/=being pure.</br>  <br>Is it true? And you know it from the manga or LN?</br>  Being ''pure'' is fucking shit anyway. The more filthy they are, the better.  <br>Fuck off kike.</br>  <br><br>NOT CONFIRMED<br><br>don't believe the lies</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. You fuck off with your shitty ''pure girls'' fantasy. Pure girls are shit and ignorant. They're only made for neckbeard waifu faggots like yourself to lust over.</br>  drones don't actually believe a world like this can happen with all the SJW and feminists in high political power and with massive sway in the media  <br>What a shitty haircut design</br>  <br>My waifu is dirty.</br>  <br>good</br>  <br>Purity is overrated<br><br>Everyone knows guys want someone who is lewd as fuck; they just want someone who is like that only for him.</br></br></br>  <br>Her voice makes my  heart  throb. T-this isn't love, right? I'm already married.</br>  <br> I'm already married. <br>No you're not. Kanbaru's a lesbian.</br></br>  <br>She is not my wife. Wait, I'll take a photo of her with my phone, give me a sec.</br>  <br>This is my love.</br>  <br>No, fuck off.</br>  <br> shounen. </br>  <br> seasonal waifu <br> being a cuck </br></br>  <br>I bet her mom is the most filthy and wild slut</br>  <br>Is there a loop of just the third part?</br>  How long until MC sees that his so called pure, innocent idol is really a lewd cock craving slut? Does his world get shattered?  <br>Her name literally means hole.</br>  <br>In what language, retard?</br>  <br>moon</br>  <br><br><br>Well as long as they don't have STD's and don't cheat then I guess that's all fine. Too bad we'll all have to settle for worn in, well used, rode hard cars that have been put out to pasture.</br></br></br>  <br>Sluts like her are the best.</br>  All I want is for Alice no Takarabako to make a doujin for this series.  <br>No, it doesn't.</br>  <br>This girl is terrible, she talks a big game but when it actually comes to mature situation is still just another pure waifu for the otaku to fawn over.<br><br>A chick that would actually be willing to look at a guy naked would be too scary for them</br></br></br>  <br> Ayame is the one shy about actual sexual acts/spoiler]<br><br> Anna is the sex fiend </br></br> </br>  <br> Too bad we'll all have to settle for worn in, well used, rode hard cars that have been put out to pasture. <br><br>If she's that well-worn she'll probably cheat at some point.</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese. <br><br>Hole in Japanese is called "ana" in romaji. <br>Don't be a fagget.</br></br></br></br>  Anna is for anal  Why is terrorist girl so prudish? Could Japan really not have her actually be interested in sex? Beta self-insert MC's and girls who respond to lewd by screaming and slapping someone are so boring  <br>That's what I'm afraid of. Of course I'll already be expecting it to happen at some point given the statistics on how many women cheat these days. <br><br>That way I won't be surprised when it happens. What a great age we live in when men expect their women, their wives to be complete unfaithful whores and sluts.</br></br></br>  <br>So, have you actually touched a woman before in a sexual manner?</br>  <br>Women have always been unfaithful sluts, don't kid yourself.</br>  <br>where is this from.</br>  <br>Heroine of the season.<br><br>She would make best girl of any series</br></br></br>  <br>Just because she thinks lewd jokes are funny doesn't mean that it's open season for you to fuck her. <br><br>Sorry /pol/ but feminism wins yet again.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck no. Honestly I cannot stand their company, I don't enjoy being around them. Either I'm a huge faggot, misogynist, sexist whatever I don't enjoy having them around me for extended periods of time.</br>  <br>She's shit. The plot really goes downhill later on.</br>  <br>That fucking chase sequence, she's a goddamn beast</br>  <br>Since when is "anna" written or pronounced as "ana"? Learn the fucking language, kid.</br>  <br>Or you could get an infinitely pure trap.</br>  <br>I'll take being alone thanks.</br>  <br>In my country it is has the same sound.</br>  Why the fuck does people keep thinking wanting to say dirty joke = wanting to become a slut?  <br>Feminism would be a girl being mature about her desires, not being afraid of sex.</br>  <br>No ones saying that, people are saying she's lame because she can't even handle the sight of a penis without turning into akane or dropping her spaghetti.</br>  <br>BWAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br>What? Look at her, an erection covered by a towel and she can't even look in its direction while turning scarlet.<br><br>You think she could be in the presence of one and at least make a joke casually.</br></br></br>  <br>Is your country Japan?</br>  So is she lewd cause of Blue Snow or is she just naturally lewd since the very beginning?<br><br>I'm thinking because of her deep fixation in wanting Blue Snow apprehended, and her utter naivety on obscenity, her curiosity got the better of her and she started to research shit on obscenity probably in hopes that she'll know how Blue Snow ticks and can finally get her. Then she stared into the abyss too long and became the very thing she was against except worse.</br></br>  <br>Nah, apparently she's the spy of the group of actual pervert terrorists who perform some more serious terrorism and their leader is a dude who has a panty fetish and dresses in a suit made of underpants.<br>So of course the heroes have to fight him.</br></br>  <br><br> Cover art completely spoiling her turnaround <br><br>even if it's completely fucking obvious, there is such a thing as novelty to the surprise. why does Japan always do this shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was agreeing with you super autismo.</br>  <br> public exposure=just telling a dirty joke </br>  <br>Because Japan is shit tier at writing. Just watch for the cute girls and you'll never be disappointed.</br>  <br><br> more serious terrorism <br><br>like what, having sex in public</br></br></br></br>  <br>They have guns for one thing</br>  <br>Clearly you don't understand gap moe.</br>  <br><br>Guns that shoots needles filled with aphrodisiac right</br></br>  <br>blue hair is slut tier</br>  <br>She's a bitch rather than a slut though.</br>  <br>Guns that shoot bullets that make people die</br>  <br> pretends to be a slut <br> can't even tolerate the sight of a dick <br>What a scam.</br></br></br>  Are we suppose to think MC's dad isn't a weirdo for rubbing his dick on his son?<br><br>Bathing your kid, sure, rubbing your nuts on their head, you what?</br></br>  <br>he wasn't rubbing his dick, he was making different shapes</br>  <br>I want to destroy her with my dick.</br>  <br>He was being a pedophile.</br>  <br>have they actually killed anyone?</br>  <br>They killed  the quality of the series .</br>  <br>She's prudish?</br>  <br>What are you, gay?</br>  <br>For all her crass talk can't even handle the sight of an actual penis without freaking out.</br>  <br>a good one</br>  <br>Is that a brandy glass full of urine?</br>  If that shit about her having had sex before is real, I'm going to drop the FUCK out of this shit.    <br>It's not.
