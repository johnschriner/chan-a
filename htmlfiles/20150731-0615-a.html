Really, really bad.<br><br>Why are op fans so defensive? Kaidou looks like shit. This isn't bait.</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br><br>Immortality=/=Invulnerable</br></br>  Kaidos introduction was lame. Really fucking lame. I expected him to be full Brutal Rampage mode, especially if he's gonna live up to "Hundred beasts Kaido".<br><br>I mean, I tought he was gonna be all bloodthirsty ruthless maniac, instead he's suicidal and sick of his life. What the hell?</br></br>  <br><br>It might've been WB - which is why he was so pissed. <br><br>That's why he wanted to go to MF.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Ivankov can pierce his skin </br>  <br>'Tis but a scratch.</br>  <br>It was technically a flashback when he jumped off the sky island. He was really serious.</br>  dat delicious Nami, it really has been too long<br>Thank you Oda</br>  <br><br>Kaidou is probably top now, but BB is still a fucking tank, so is Zoro too I guess.</br></br>  So since Law opened the gates of fujos for the fan base, how bad do you suspect the new mouse girl will affect these threads, the outside opinion of one piece/fan base, or any other variables that you can think of, anon?<br><br>Also what's the best panel in your opinion?</br></br>  <br> go back to who ever did that to you <br>One is from Whitebeard and the other is from Roger so...</br></br>  <br> still trying this hard </br>  <br><br>Why are you fucking trying still?</br></br>  <br>I think the logistics and efficiency of this method of suicide are secondary to the ridiculous idea of jumping to your death from a sky island. It makes for powerful visuals and gets across the idea of suicide without being contrived. And this is One Piece, ideas like jumping down from a high place to kill yourself in a spectacular fashion fit the tone of the series but Kaido trying to rip his own head off or reaching into his ribcage and crushing his heart hardly fit.</br>  <br>???<br>he is a giant with long hair and some tattos<br>why he's design is bad?</br></br></br>  <br>She's actually wearing a shirt for once.</br>  <br> suicidal and sick of his life <br><br>really nigga</br></br></br>  <br> Law opened the gates of fujos for the fan base <br>Are you serious? One Piece has been popular as fuck with fujos ever since Sanji joined.</br></br>  Kaidou wouldn't die even if he was killed  <br> So since Law opened the gates of fujos for the fan base <br>who are Zoro, Sanji &amp; Ace?</br></br>  <br>He can't if the one who did that was Roger or WB. Heck, maybe that's the reason he tried to stop WB going to Marineford.</br>  <br>Anon you can't expect them all to be a super tough coolguy. Kaido has a really emotional and soft side to him despite being the strongest pirate ever, can't you see the complex nature of his duality? ;_; <br>One Piece is truly the citizen kane of manga.</br></br>  <br>Why is Rebecca on that island?</br>  <br>I got you fam<br> &gt;&gt;/FateGeneral/ <br> &gt;&gt;/TokyoGhoulGeneral/ </br></br></br>  Why didn't they just chain him with seastone and throw him out into the sea?  So Kaidos nickname "Hundred Beast" isn't related to his DF but rather than he's as strong as Hundred Beasts, or something?  So which new nakama will join Luffy to fight Kaido?  <br><br>Maybe he has gills.</br></br>  <br> dat bellybutton <br> dem vagina bones </br></br>  <br>finally a skirt again</br>  <br>I expected a lot more that a some henchmen looking huge bitch for a fucking yonkou.<br><br>His shadowy image that looked nothing like him looked more menacing.</br></br></br>  <br>Fear the worst</br>  <br> Army of Zoans <br> Island called Zoo </br></br>  <br>Why is this meme so stale?</br>  <br>He might not even have a fruit power, and he may not even be able to drown.<br><br>I'd be pissed as fuck if I were chained down at the bottom of the ocean for eternity.

One Piece is very westernized.</br>  <br>Nah. Luffy has a goal: beat the Yonkou.

It's one of the few shows on Toonami we like.</br>  Thread in which we wait for chapter 53 spoilers and chinascans.<br>Please no shitflinging like in those bait threads earlier today. This is for actual discussion and speculation for the manga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128774080 <br>This is new Yu Yu Hakusho.<br><br>Complete with a Genkai.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128774080 <br><br>Like clockwork.<br><br>Anyone, anyone willing to pitch this series to me? What's the major appeal? Characters, worldbuilding, plot, creative fights, etc.</br></br></br></br>  I wonder if Bakugou will show up too.  <br>You need to give us more to work with if you want discussion, OP. Give a scenario or question. <br><br>Like what do you think happened between todoroki and his mother during his visit with her that let him come to terms with his firey side?</br></br></br>  <br>cool character designs, powers, great fights. the characters are easy to love. It has potential.</br>  Okay, give Deku a sidekick, gotta be someone we've seen. Who would offer the best dynamic and quirk combos  <br>Maybe Gran Torino could be his sidekick. Or vice versa.</br>  <br>One of Hiroshoki's strong points is his character design. Although their personalities contain some standard shounen cliches, their interactions with each other feel very natural.</br>  <br>"has"<br>its been 1 year, this one is a keeper.<br><br>However I think the plot is getting 2 fast</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's great. How does that sound or do you want the long version</br>  <br><br>Nah. If it was Yu Yu, we'd be seeing more bullshit power ups that appear from absolutely nowhere and redundancies out the ass with no prior warning.<br><br>So far we have had everything explained.</br></br></br></br>  How long do you think before Deku is better than Todoroki?<br><br>Right now I'd honestly put it at Todoroki &gt; Deku = Kacchan &gt; Crowbro = Iida &gt; Tentacle guy &gt; Tailbro</br></br>  <br><br>It's Naruto then. <br><br>Just wait for some sort of time skip and everything to go to shit. At least we had an early tournament arc where the protag lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le naruto meme <br>Fuck off /v/ermin</br></br>  <br><br>He already is. <br><br>Deku recently got full body 5% and can act faster than before where as he fought Todoroki with his self damaging attacks. <br><br>Deku could probably take Todoroki already in a fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Except fuck you.<br><br>Naruto was great as a shonen until we got past the time skip. <br><br>Before, it was about good fights with repetoires of techniques. <br><br>After the Saucekey vs Believe it fight at the waterfall, it went full DBZ and ruined what was a decent series. It went from what made it good into I HAVE A BETTER MOVE NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Characters feel both fresh and natural, fights are solid and don't drag on. The series is also great at delivering on HYPE moments.</br>  <br>I still don't think so. Not to talk Deku down, but Todoroki is just a beast with any sort of distance. His Ice and Fire are fast and AOE. Until Deku can use super big shockwaves he's at a pretty hefty disadvantage</br>  <br>Bakugou is still the strongest in my opinion. His quirk is ridiculously powerful and the kid has the best fighting instincts out of all of them. Todoroki is powerful, but we haven't seen him employ much strategy outside of "freeze the entire arena" or when he blocked lida's pipes.</br>  <br>I meant it has potential to become a huge series like One Piece. I wish people would stop comparing it to naruto, I don't want MHA to end up like that</br>  <br>Maybe, I won't disagree that's he's super strong, he just really needs to chill. Case in point<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xGP<wbr>pmGTXKVs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I am pleasantly surprised. Everyone tried to call Todoroki and Kaachan as the "hero gone bad rival" to deku but it's looking like it's Iida instead</br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree that Bakugou is the strongest. He just needa to chill</br>  Vol 5 Teaser  <br><br>Agreedo.<br><br>Time skip ruined Naruto.<br><br>I don't think My Hero Academia is gonna get a time skip though. Like the academia part is in the name, and he's only got 3 years of school to go through. Can't skip TOO fast.<br><br>Technically we're only ~1-2 months into his first year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is this the greatest manga of all time?</br>  <br> It's todoroki <br>Is this the end of the tournament ?</br></br>  <br>It's going to need to start catering to a couple more of my fetishes before it beats the number one in my heart.</br>  <br>unless it follows him becoming a teacher and then the principal</br>  <br>what fetishes, tiles?</br>  <br>In no way is kacchan the strongest. Todo of course will be able to out power him, we just haven't seen him use his fire side that much which was his weakness</br>  <br> as if anon won't notice it's todo  <br>Well then again maybe that's the point of a teaser</br></br>  <br>Classes in Japan start in the Spring. We already blew through the last half of his middle school year in 3 chapters, then we blew through all of Summer with the training for the sports festival montage. It's already Autumn, so by 100 chapters we'll be done with his first year, and be finished with school within 300.</br>  <br>Since the other anons have put in about the characters, the world building is actually quite good at the moment. Hiroshoki seems to really be trying to expand on the idea of everyone being super, even into the economic and political sides.</br>  <br>But that's just assuming he follows the same formula. Which he more then likely won't</br>  <br>Can't say for sure without knowing what kind of power ramp OfA has, but I think it's safe to say that 100% full body with a very good physique is completely broken. All Might changed the local weather with the air pressure from a downwards strike, and that was when he was already weakening.</br>   <br>i buy the japanese volumes did 4 get a release date yet? i didnt see it in the scans</br>  <br>vol.4 is already released, vol.5 coming out early August (aug 4 I think?).</br>  <br><br> has potential to become a huge series like One PIece. <br><br>There's being a fan of a body of work and then there's being delusional.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a hell of a performer so far. If it keeps up what's it's doing with its sales/ranking it's on track to have some real legs.<br><br>The thing is what happens if it manages to become popular enough to hang on past Horikoshi's most optimistic end-date. Sorta why I respect the mangaka for Assassination Classroom who says that it's OVER at the end of the school year despite it being rather popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The one thing where BnHA falls down is the definition and clarity of wtf Midoriya's percentage use of OfA is and how effective that percentage is at being properly utilized.<br><br>Like, All Might was well past his prime due to his injuries and was still ridiculously, overwhelmingly powerful compared to even broken fullbody element powers like Endeavor and Todoroki before, and after giving up OfA.<br><br>He says he could've beaten Noumu with 5 punches in his heyday, but it took him 200-300. his 100% punches being half-dead, out of energy, and running on leftover fumes after giving up OfA to Midoriya completely fucking smoke the "100%" arm-breakers Midoriya can throw.<br><br>Like, 5% of All Might in his prime should have Midoriya sending Stain flying like 50 feet.<br><br>I personally interpret Midoriya's concept of "100%" being, "This is the absolute maximum output I have before I literally kill myself with the attack." Like All Might 100% output should do more than powder his bones, so I think his supposed "100%" is some fraction of the real power and he's mentally holding back so he doesn't literally blow his fucking arm completely off.<br><br>And this is before you get into the fact that according to All Might, every OfA user is stronger than the previous. Midoriya at his real potential max output should be able to level city blocks in a single punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's also possible that OfA works as a muscle enhancer, and thus gets stronger as the user gets stronger. That would be why the scrawny Midoriya has less power than the giant All Might, even if both use 100%.</br>  <br>Even with great pacing, what this guy  says holds weight due to precedence of shonen battle manga. <br><br>It'd be wonderful if MHA subverts this and says fuck you to retarded logic that messed all the other shonen up, but the power of editors is always strong.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's heart.<br><br>My Hero Academia is a "traditional" (read: generic, but not in a bad way) shounen series. You've got cliche shonen tropes, trope characters, and lots of action. The whole plot is "MC gets a superpower from a cool guy and wants to be a hero". Plain as it gets, right?<br><br>But somehow, in spite of that, it takes these things and breathes new life into them. You'd think the MC is a scrawny wet blanket, but he's worked for everything he's got (and there's a reason people keep calling him based). The smug snake character is a complete and total asshole, and is framed as such, which makes it all the more hilarious when everyone trolls him. The "designated love interest"? She's a bro and can actually hold her own. The brooding guy's got his daddy issues, but he's a decent guy in spite of it and is actually trying to work through them. There're SO MANY interesting characters (and I really hope we get good screen time for all of them), but there are no Sasukes in THIS series, my friend (one guy's been going edgy, but the goddamn VILLAIN he was going after told him what a moron he was being).<br><br>The plot has been going arc-to-arc, with a training exercise to the sports festival to hero internships (which is now). But Horikoshi doesn't drag on. Something happens in EVERY chapter. And it's awesome.<br><br>The art itself is really dynamic and fun. And each character looks like their own person, to the point they all have their own individual type of eyes.<br><br>And on top of that, Horikoshi puts lots of little details in. Characters interact even when they're not the main focus, and their personalities really shine through. You can tell Horikoshi really loves what he's doing.<br><br>So yeah I'd really recommend it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who's buying the physical copies when they FINALLY come out? I know I will.<br><br>And I doubt it's gonna sell out like it did in Japan, but how well do you guys think it's gonna do in the states?</br></br>  <br>I could deal of a time skip sort of scenario of it was more in the vein of a continuation series taking place after the storylines dealing with the school, after we catch up with narrator Deku in the timeline.</br>  <br>With the pace that it's going at though, I honestly don't see MHA going past the 500ch mark. And the worldbuilding can only go so far in a setting like MHA. It literally has the word Academia in it so I don't see it going past their school life. I think it'll be more in the lines of FMA, a good shorter shounen, rather than a long hitter like One Piece.</br>  <br>It's probably gonna be pretty big here.</br>  <br>Not all editors are bad though<br><br>WT's editor was the former OP editor and if you watched his interview he basically said "I give suggestions but he can do whatever the fuck he wants"</br></br></br>  <br> Anyone, anyone willing to pitch this series to me? What's the major appeal? Characters, worldbuilding, plot, creative fights, etc. <br>Capeshit: a japanese Interpretation</br></br>  <br> capeshit but actually good editon  <br><br>I started reading comics and capeshit when I was about 11 (2002) and after about 7 years I found manga and not many capeshit stories hold up to manga since I started reading abd MHA is a pretty good if compared to other capeshit</br></br></br>  <br>I think I'll actually buy the volumes. I've never supported a series before, so this'll be my first.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks, sounds like it might be interesting. I wish I didn't start reading Souma just a couple of days ago, feeling kinda burned out already, and this might have been a better fit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 5% Deku is not using prime All Might power, but the 1/60 All Might has left.</br>  While waiting for spoilers and raws, here are the results of the /a/ Character Popularity poll.<br><br>This was rather interesting. We'll see how it compares to the Japanese reader poll in a few weeks' time. Total number of responses was 74 for the character poll, 73 for all other questions. <br><br>Character Poll Results: <br>Deku took first place with an overwhelming 28% of the vote, 21 total. Tsuyu was second with 12%, while All Might was third with 11%. Shinsou was fourth with 7% and Bakugou fifth with 5%. All other characters received 3 or fewer votes, including Uraraka, Iida, and Grapes.<br><br>Surprisingly, or perhaps not given who actually knew about the survey, random translator on /a/ was the most preferred scanlation, with a whopping 41% of the vote. Viz was second with 31% (23 votes), while Fallen Angels was a bad fourth place with only 7 votes. Powermanga is still going strong, with 16% of the vote. I wonder if MAL or Batoto would produce different results; probably, since they don't know about anonymous<br><br>The shipper question, which was mostly a joke, had 31 of you (42%) answer "Maybe." More people voted for "I find this question offensive" than for "Yes" (12 to 11). 19 answered "No," for a total negative of 31, tying the Maybes. <br><br>65 of you, representing 89% of the pollsters, believed you would follow Boku no Hero Academia for more than 2 years. I guess it's long-term popularity is assured, at least amongst use pirating fags. <br><br>Link to the raw survey data can be found here: http://pastebin.com/ftn4rBHA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Not even 100 people voted. <br><br>Sausagebra, /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Iida only got one vote. <br><br>What did best boy do to deserve this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The first thread that it was posted in only had about 35 posters and got 25 responses. The second had more, but at the time I posted the link it had 33 or so. <br><br>Just how much of BnH General is a circlejerk, and how much of the low post numbers is because one was a raw thread and the other was Weekly Shounen Jump Dump, only you can decide.</br></br></br>  <br>I spend all my hobby time here and I didn't know about this poll. I guess it was a flash thread or something.</br>  <br>He should be glad he even got one. No. 13, most of Class-A, and Stain got nothing.</br>  What's with all these rampant shitposting keep appearing on Heor academia thread lately?  <br>Some people that don't have something to watch or read come to shitspot.</br>  <br><br>It's because some idiot keeps making the same exact general threads to make /a/ hate the series.</br></br>  <br>All might can do a lot more damage even when he's weakened than Deku's 100%. If the current OFA user is stronger than the last, then Deku might just be using 40% of his real power.</br>  <br>No, that would be  Hoshi no Samidare <br>But it's pretty fucking good, my current favorite series</br></br>  <br>Food wars is a good series too, but like you've said it kinda burns out after a while. Sometimes it will pick back up but then again a lot of times it doesn't. While BnHA on the other hand it's been great so far will little to no dull moments. (But that's for now who knows how it will be after 100+ chapters</br>  <br>No, that's xxxHoLiC.</br>  <br>Actually we aren't even in summer yet, considering that sports festivals happen in Spring. You can even tell from the way they're dressed.</br>  <br>That only really seems to fool newfags trying to fit in though.</br>  <br>Because naruto gaiden ended so shitposter is bored</br>  Espoilurrs cuando?  <br>Nani?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128785389 <br>seek help</br>  <br>This reply is a little on the late side, but there's official English release dates for the first 4 volumes already:<br>Vol 1: August 27th<br>Vol 2: November 19th<br>Vol 3: February 2nd<br>Vol 4: May 3rd</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Deku = Kacchan <br><br>Oh Dekufags are hilarious. Katsuki destroys Deku stop wanking.</br></br></br>  <br>City blocks is too weak. <br><br>Give him more power</br></br></br>  <br>Within the next 15 hours.</br>  <br>Deku literally spared Bakugou's life once.And now he can move like him, I wouln't be so sure.</br>  <br>The first time they fought, Bakugo wasn't taking him seriously he just wanted to blow him up. <br><br>The fact that you're counting that fight just shows how much you wank Deku.<br>And Deku isn't the only one training</br></br></br></br>  <br>But you are way underestimating Deku and I used that fight as an example, also I didn't say Deku would win. And even if Baku is training, which we don't know, we can't tell if he improves as fast as Deku. Knowing the hard time Bakugou had dealing with Deku and saying that he wouln't stand a chance makes no sense at all.</br>  <br>dentro de 5 minutos.</br>  The full volume 5 cover is out.  <br>when will hiroshiki learn to draw hands?</br>  <br>You. You are my nigga.</br>  Which Teenage Mutant Ninja Stain are you?  <br> every OfA user is stronger than the previous <br>I never took OfA description to mean that<br>I figured they were just treating it like a sacred torch and that's it, just not letting it burn out and keeping it burning at it's brightest<br>not that they were constantly increasing its power</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure volume 1 comes out on August 4th<br><br><br>That cover looks terrible, what the fuck? His scar is nearly invisible and that hand looks wonky.<br><br><br>Yes, OfA does grow with each user. See the 8 balls of light that grow in the background?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bless you anon</br>  <br>I'm still wondering about stain's appareance, so far we only know his scarf is red, but there has not been a color of him, or of any bad guy so far....</br>  <br>oh dang<br>guess I'm wrong<br>I wonder what 100% OfA would look like dozens of successors from now, then?<br>would it be a logarithmic curve? or linear with a small-ass slope allowing for unlimited power?<br> OfA years from now is essentially Onepunch-Man </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We've already seen Noumu, Shigaraki, and Black Mist in color.<br><br><br>The problem I see is that after a few more generations it could be impossible for someone to gain enough muscle to handle the full 100% without tearing them apart.</br></br></br></br>  Chiba Toshirou is making a doujin of the series, with Tails and Momo  <br>We'll have to see just how strong Deku is going to get. One thing is for sure, Deku prime (hehe get it) going to be a hell of a lot stronger than All might in his prime.</br>  <br>I had forgotten about that pic</br>  <br> japan in charge of having not an ounce of taste <br><br>terrible times.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I guess it was just bad-timing and bad threads.</br>  My biggest fear is that Boku No Hero Acadamia is what Pierrot plans to do once the Naruto Anime ends, and the reason they are still having filler in naruto despite it being done is so they can keep it going until Boku no Hero gets enough chapters to start.  <br>Better than Toei animating it. I'd choose the lesser evil.</br>  <br> I started reading comics and capeshit when I was about 11 (2002) and after about 7 years I found manga and not many capeshit stories hold up to manga since I started reading abd MHA is a pretty good if compared to other capeshit <br>I guess you are to young to remember that capeshit (no) american comics were good a long time ago.</br></br>  <br>Rabble rabble rabble underage fag get...<br><br>Oh christ wait.<br><br>Oh gods no, I'm old</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope that Madhouse animates this.</br>  <br>David production.</br>  <br>I'll give you that, certainly.<br><br>Really, lets just hope a good studio does it, I don't know who necessarily, but someone (Madhouse is the obvious option, and they do seem to be getting a lot of popular stuff so we might get them. MAPPA could do a good job, but I dont think they want to do anything that isnt strange in some way. BONES could do a good job, although, they do ofcourse have a tenancy to create there own endings. Lerche might be a good secondary to bones, and they've proven they can do a great job with shows like [this season] and Assasination Classroom, although I do think they aren't particularly action orientated, so I dont know if they would be good at any of the battle scenes)</br></br></br>  If they are really wanting to push this as the next big jump series, its probably going to get a long running anime adaptation. I wouldn't be surprised if Toei or Pierrot does do the anime.  <br> David production <br>They could do a great job too actually, although I just want them to focus on animating Part 4+<br><br>A-1 could do a fair job too I think, they are pretty good, and there only real problem is an annoying amount of mediocre source material and stories.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>what about Studio I.G.?</br></br></br></br>  Spoilers in 5 min guys!  <br> Studio I.G <br>Oh yeah, sure, them too. Really nearly anyone but Toei or Pierrot and we're golden.</br></br>  <br>It'd need to be someone who can a) attack at a distance, b) restrict an opponent's movements, and/or c) mitigate collateral damage. Someone who can buy Deku the time and focus to make a thorough analysis of difficult situations. Ochako is probably the most compatible character we've seen so far: she has great potential for long-range strikes  tossing shit, meteor move , she can turn foes into sitting ducks at close range, and her quirk can be used to quickly clear rubble or stabilize damaged structures. Todoroki is also pretty high up there based on his skillset alone, but I'm not sure how likely it'd be for him to take the role of a sidekick.  It'd definitely piss his dad off, so there's that. </br>  <br>If it's the same cast that made AoT, then it's all good. <br><br>Don't let Pierrot destroy this, just like how they butchered beelzebub.</br></br></br>  I starter reading BnHA today and I'm in chapter 44.

Deku has O blood type which has the lowest paralysis time. We also get a small flashback of Todo's conversation with his mother and how she wants him to use all of his potential, even if it means using his left side.</br></br>  <br>Correction, Stain cuts Todo but he freezes his own blood so he can't get any on his blade. Around that time Deku becomes unparalyzed because his blood type has the lowest time limit Stain's quirk can work.</br>  <br>  Stains quirk works differently for different blood types. Deku has O blood type which has the lowest paralysis time </br>  <br>Quirks are going to have downsides found out during fights, anon, it's an acceptable asspull method in my opinion since it doesn't really change how strong Deku actually is.<br><br>And it seems like it's only used so that Todo and Deku can double team Stain while Iida is helpless, even furthering his edge.</br></br></br>  <br>If the spoiler is ture, I have to agree, it's an asspull.<br><br>If we had known previously that stain's quirck works more or less time on different people but not knowing why, it wouldn't but as we didn't, this qualifies as an asspull. Has it been previously established that Deku is blood type 0?<br><br>It makes sense in the context of the series, but I think this is the very first asspull of the series.<br><br> Stay strong hiroshiki. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> first asspull of the series <br>False.</br></br>  <br>Asspull or not that was a pretty cool limitation. Atleast it was not going full avatar calling upon the powers of the previous mights to undo the paralysis</br>  <br> Quirks are going to have downsides found out during fights <br><br>I agree, and hat makes fights itneresting, but we had no prior information on any of that, like  points out.<br><br>I'm sad to say IT IS an asspull. Not game breaking, nothing much so far, but still it's a precedent for the series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you not paying attention dosen't make sit an asspull </br>  <br>My post has literally nothing to do with my other post, dumbass.</br>  It would only be an asspull if we didn't know Deku had O-type blood before. However, we found that out when Recovery Girl healed him.  <br>it is, and still is a strong as fuck quirk, he can paralyze independently any number of persons and each have their own running time, so this shit is pretty broken.<br><br>now I have the doubt, how long does he have to wait to be able to paralize someone again?<br><br>can he?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still an asspull, anon. Know his blood type doesn't change anything unless we knew Stain's quirk flaw.</br>  <br>we did?<br><br><br>then you are retarded, in the very own screenshot that you posted it was established that OfA had several users and that it had tob e passed down, each of them adding something.<br><br>So hving the "shadows" of the previous users to represent waht each of them added to OfA is not an asspull, just an extension of something we already knew.<br><br>So not an asspull.<br><br><br>we did?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, if we had known that different people got paralyzed different times previously, this wouldn't be an asspull.</br>  <br> So hving the "shadows" of the previous users to represent waht each of them added to OfA is not an asspull, just an extension of something we already knew. <br>All we were told was that it was the power to transfer power. It never states anywhere before the finish of the fight with Shinso that there were "shadows" of OfA users that can control Izuku's body. Stop being an autistic fanboy and realize that the manga has its flaws.</br></br>  <br>we knew each user polisehd the power and added something to it, with the shadows, we got to know some consequence of that process.<br><br>You are a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>He probably needs to lick the blood again. Since he barely cut Deku and got a small amount of blood, it's safe to assume he needs to cut him again to get more blood.</br>  <br>Oh no you're totally right. 100 chapters down the line I'll be sure to remember your post when Izuku<br>is pushed off a building and learns OfA had the ability to fly all along. Totally not an asspull right?</br></br>  <br> we knew each user polisehd the power and added something to it <br>No we don't. Stop forcing your headcanon onto everyone.</br></br>  <br> 2 factors to paralyze <br> the amoutn of blood licked and the blood type. <br><br>it's an interesting quirk all right.<br><br>How dod he learn about it though?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He has an abnormal tongue. It probably wasn't hard to realise that his quirk was taste-related. Then you experiment.</br>  <br>You're making no goddamn sense. Having your consciousness attached to OfA is a consequence of passing your physical strength (and possibly quirk) down? Do you even understand what you yourself are even saying? All we've been told for sure is that OfA passes down strength (and some life from previous users AFTER the fight with Shinsou).</br>  <br>as i said, we knew OfA was passed down, we knew it has had several users and we knew that each of it's users had polisehd the power, so it wasn't an asspull to show how that process that we already knew works, which apparently involves leaving an imprint f the user consciousness or some shit like that.</br>  <br> so it wasn't an asspull to show how that process that we already knew works <br>Except we didn't know it passed on consciousness. Are you trying to say it's not an asspull to give a character a power that can potentially give several different powers that arise at just the right moment with no proper explanation? <br>So if I had a power to generate a new power every day, and I was fighting a fire based villain and I just so happen to get a water power as midnight strikes, it's not an asspull? You're fucking retarded and most likely underage considering your grammar.</br></br></br>  <br>Your assumption that OfA gets stronger with each user is based on assbackwards translation, original meaning is that the previous users kept the power alive like an olympic torch.<br>And the growing spheres in the picture you use may as well represent the distance, the passage of time. <br>You'd think something important like the fact that it gets stronger and stronger would catch Deku's curiosity and become a point in the dialogue instead of being barely mentioned.</br></br></br>  <br>the main difference is we knewthat ofa got passed down between users, and that it grew stronger each time, but we didn't knew what that process required or involved, and we got a glimpse of that.<br><br>We didn't have any indication on how stain quirk worked, just that it paralized people. There's a big difference there,<br><br><br>  the fact that it gets stronger and stronger would catch Deku's curiosity and become a point in the dialogue instead of being barely mentioned. <br><br>all in it's due time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? Not that anon but it's obvious that OfA gets stronger and stronger. There were 8 users before Deku, and there were 8 spheres growing each time with smaller spheres going into each bigger one. I would presume the quirk sucks all the strength of the previous user when it's passed down, which is why they die.</br>  <br>That's just FA's terrible editing.</br>  <br>Thas's not the FA version. FA's is way worse.</br>  <br>We didn't get a glimpse of anything, you fucking retard. So far all we know for sure is that OfA transfers physical strength, that's all, everything else you're saying is your shitty headcanon.<br><br>Let me lay out what an asspull is to you:<br>-x character has mysterious power<br>-mysterious power is never explained in full<br>-x character learns that a part of this mysterious power actually solves his problem just in time<br><br><br>That's not FA's terrible editing though, that's the one done by viz.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually like the way he does hands, but they don't look so great here. Maybe the lack of detail?</br>  <br>thanks.</br>  <br>They always look weird when he colors them.</br>  Toriko and Black Clover spoilers/raws are out, BnHA will be soon.  <br>From where? Ishuhui doesn't have Black Clover.</br>  <br>mangamint</br>  Deku having O blood type isn't surprising since it's the blood type that can give blood to all other blood types except the negative ones(which i assume represent villains.  <br>why does black clover get the spoilers and shit faster than BnHA? I thought BnHA was the new hotness, but it seems black clover is taking that place.<br><br> is black clover worth reading?   all I know about it it's that it's a shitty naruto clone on all aspects, story, characters, art style... </br></br></br>  <br>If you know that much, you should be able to decide for yourself whether you want ot read it or not. Black Clover got raws sooner because it gets center color and cover this week.</br>  <br> enter color and cover this week. <br><br>that explains it.<br><br>But what I mean, is it copying naruto ina way that is actually enjoyable, or it's just a shit series?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's absolute shit in the beginning, but only just shit later on. I read it to see how much worse it can get.</br>  <br>so it skipped the starting of naruto whre it was actually good, and got to the last part where the only fun was to see how shit could it get.<br><br> Now that i've dropped Toriko I think I'll pick it up. </br></br></br>  Stain?  <br>yes?</br>  <br>looks good</br>  <br>Ingenium needs to shopped into that</br>  <br>A LOT OF LOYALTY FOR A HIRED SWORD!</br>  <br>Really? Seems simple to me. Todoroki clearly had a problem taking a shit that morning and Germany is backing Stain trying to purify the world by blood types instead of race now. Oh and the Chinese were backing Ingenium which was the real reason he was made an example of.</br>  <br>But who was phone?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I don't see it as an asspull, i mean it's been pretty clear that stain paralize his oponent to beat them up and then finish them, then it was subtle but still implyed that the paralisis quirk wasn't that reliable at all as he would not need to beat them up and just straight up finish them.<br><br>Also that's the reason why he hurry up to finish them up when the wounds he inflict don't compromise their mobility (for example iida legs still work, not like his brother ones), as he is conscious of the probablity the paralisis wear off while he's busy and they still manage to escape.<br><br>The problem stain got was that they delayed him and that fucked up his timing, showing his quirk downside.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not using mineta <br>awful</br></br>  <br> spam a board with something you don't like <br> people get tired of it <br> people start shitposting on genuine threads <br><br>So much for "not your personal army".</br></br></br></br></br>  Wich girl is the most qtπ and why is she Jirou?  boku no asspull academia  <br>You don´t know what that word means, right?</br>  <br><br> Todoroki Shouto: The Origin <br><br>Well that explains why He's the only one there.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thank you, anon.</br></br>  <br><br>You've done this for the last three weeks anon.

Stop speedreading faggot.</br>  <br>Was he even paralysed to begin with ? I don't remember.</br>  <br>Makes more sense if you know that Japanese belief that different blood types have different personalities.</br>  <br>He was.</br>  <br>So the closer you are to his blood type, the longer the paralysis?</br>  <br>It doesn't seem to me like he was. He was only pinned by Stain, not paralyzed.</br>  <br>Delete this fujopandering: the manga</br>  <br>His left arm looks like it was cut.</br>  <br>Stain have to lick the bloodstain first to activate his quirk,</br>  <br>Huh? His right shoulder has been cut, yeah, but I don't see where his left arm could have been cut.</br>  <br>Could have cut it in the time time period that was cut out.</br>  so to beat Stain you need to use someone either unable to bleed or inmune to cutting attacks. so either of the Metapods would be more than enough to beat him.  <br>Shinshou would be a good counter to Stain too since he is talkative as fuck. You know what, where the fuck is Shinshou?</br>  <br>Jobbing around.</br>  <br>Pfft, who cares about what some second rate B class is doing?</br>  <br>Shinsou isn't from class B, he's from the General Department.</br>  <br>Pfft, who cares what some second rate Gen Ed is doing?</br>  <br>It's fun.<br><br>I don't know what else to say. The characters are fun, their designs are fun, the fights are fun; it's fun. It makes me smile.<br><br>It's not perfect: the biggest "issue" I have with it is that I don't feel characters beyond a very small number bear any significance yet, but that's fine; this is mostly a story about the hero, not his classmates.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>was an invisible girl doujin too risky</br>  <br>ask noill to do hakagure comic.</br>   best girl too shy to show the goods <br>why live</br>  <br>Will Blackmist ever not be a jobber? <br>He can teleport black holes and got shanked by a ninja turtle.</br></br>  <br>We've barely seen him in action, I think it's too early to call him a jobber.<br><br>Besides, his quirk seems unsuited for actual combat, so it isn't strange that he got cut by someone who's great with knives and swords.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Far be it from me to defend this, but I'll say one thing: Japan has "a thing" about blood types and personality and shit. I don't know much about it, but they seem to really believe it. Does Deku have the "O" type personality, as defined by Japan? I wouldn't know personally.<br><br>Though, in any case, it just so happening to be O that gets off almost scot-free is fairly ass-pullish.</br></br></br></br>  5 Minutes until scans  <br>5 minutes until 5 minutes until scans</br>  <br> Deku has the one blood type that can be donated to every other blood type <br>Horikoshi you sly devil.</br></br>  <br><br>because she's pure with class unlike that slut acid girl or the invinsible whore.</br></br>  <br>Welp.</br>  <br>basically now that they know the trick of his power Stain is fucked... unless he's controlling it consciously and wants to spread false information.</br>  <br>DEEPEST LORE</br>  <br>damn</br>    <br><br>My biggest worry is BHA suffers the same curse as Naruto. One of the most popular series, almost everyone knows about it even people who don't have iota of interest in Naruto at least knows the name and maybe the basic premise.<br><br>Despite this popularity they have almost no good porn. There are more western porn of it than eastern. I shouldn't see hentaikey on almost every single naruto image.<br><br>It'd be a tragedy if this series doesn't get the porn it deserves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsuyu porn on pixiv and such has been promising so far, at least.</br>   Deku deducing where Iida and Stain were based on previous incidents <br>Like motherfucking Batman.</br>  <br>Yeah and that one tsuyu doujinshi was pretty good too, juts hope it doesn't run out of gas.</br>  <br>Blood type O is also a universal donor. So yeah it's most likely intentional.</br>  <br>Blood type 0 with a rh -</br>  <br>Yeah I've noticed the lack of porn for this compared to fujo manga or shows <br>Hope this doesn't go the nurutu route of low quality porn <br><br>At least the amount is pretty equal between girl or boy characters</br></br></br></br>  <br>The porn has possibility. Kacchan blowing his own dick off, Invisigirl blowjob, Shouji could grow some tentacle dicks.</br>  <br>Seriously, Deku's a smart guy. He needs to get that gadget girl to help him out.</br>  <br>There's actually a lot of porn on pixiv and even more on twitter you just gotta know how to look for it.</br>  <br>He'd be way too overpowered<br> batman intellect, deducing skills and martial arts knowledge with superman's strength, stamina and resistance aided with high tech gadgets. <br><br>No villain ever could do shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a hero isn't about giving the bad guys a fair fight.

I haven't been disillusioned yet.</br></br>  <br>The moment Deku masters using higher amounts of power with OfA the story's probably gonna segue more into the typical existential/dilemma types of scenarios rather than combat.

Briefly becomes an IRL version of Rikka from Chuunibyou. Does not yet understand why /a/ trolls shonenshit threads. Will hate self for the rest of his natural life for this brief phase.<br><br>Stage 3: Mature / deepfag phase. Once he begins to realize shonenshit is shit, begins to seek out “deep” and critically acclaimed anime such as Evangelion, Madoka, Lain, etc. Starts debating the meaning of these anime on /a/, as well as starts trolling shonenshit threads, suddenly feeling superior to the plebes in said threads.<br><br>Stage 4: Moefag, the final phase. Decides to try a moe series which /a/ seems to love, such as Aria, or more recently Hidamari Sketch, etc… justifying it to self as for “purely academic reasons,” e.g. so they can troll or shittalk these series with an informed viewpoint. Ends up discovering that nothing is more peaceful, relaxing, and enjoyable than watching cute girls doing cute things.

Why the fuck should people wait 3 hours for raws when they don't have to?</br></br></br>  <br> Yugi </br>  I have to admit that I was very briefly an Amourshipper, or at the very least a Serenafag, and even to this day I don't hate Serena (I actually like her). I'm just not happy with the way things at /padt/ have gone. In the past, it was full of discussion of various topics. Sure it had lots of Amourshipping, but other topics got their time in the spotlight as well. But nowadays it's just a de-factor Amourshipping thread. It's not wrong to discuss Amour, but when it becomes the main source of discussion most of the time, along with criticizing anyone who even dares to at the very least imply Serena will leave at the end of XY or not believing that Ash and Serena will become a couple, something just doesn't feel right. Hate me all you want, whether it be though my use of a trip, my opinions, or that fetish, but it can't be denied that you guys take Amour way too seriously and are guilty of the same problems as Pokeshippers. You guys keep saying that you are "just going along for the ride" and aren't taking things seriously, but that doesn't seem to be the case if you discuss Amour *and little else* day in and day out. It's not wrong to be a shipper, but please, can't you guys stop making /padt/ a shipping thread? You guys aren't "not being serious" if you hate anyone who isn't a shipper.<br><br><br>This.</br></br></br>  JUST ENJOY THE RIDE  <br>Tl;dr</br>  <br><br>Somebody needs to chill.</br></br>  <br>Mami you seemed to have forgotten, you're a shit and no one cares about your opinons</br>  <br>Don't be a fucking whiner you fucking namefag.

Let them discuss Amour all they want, they just need to at least chill about Amour and treat people with other opinions about Serena better. </br>  <br> your crush will never eat and enjoy your homemade dogfood </br>  <br>maybe</br>  <br>It's pretty good.<br><br> That thread has exploded with OC lately. Multiple drawfags, and they even scanlated the movie adaptation manga </br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to the part about /vp/ being autistic, not this thread.</br>  <br>Some nigger just has to make a Pokemon thread in /a/ even though he's been told not to. Make of that as you will.</br>  <br><br>Um, no. Shut the hell up tripfag. This is the first time in TWENTY YEARS that there is even a REMOTE POSSIBILITY that Ash might hook up with a girl. We'll discuss it all we want.</br></br>  <br>Based Mami dropping elite truth bombs</br>  <br> box-office performance <br> important <br><br>go talk about how yakaii is killing pokemon somewhere else fag</br></br></br></br>  <br>Half of it is Mami shitting things up, it's not so bad otherwise</br>  <br>Like a flip you are mami, always cannot be satisfied. That's the reason why your country is shit, you vote guys only to put the blame game on</br>  <br>You're taking funposting too seriously, Mimi.</br>  <br>Serena is cute!</br>  <br>Discuss what you want to discuss. If no one else wants to, then deal with it. That's the state of the fanbase.</br>  <br>I was in the movie threads and no, that's not what was happening. People discussed the movie itself first. When that was done they began talking about that scene. Don't twist facts. People like you are the ultimate shitposter since you only complain and don't try to discuss anything else. Which people will do if you just bring up a topic. Besides, we had the manga adaptation for long and that was discussed a lot. So fuck off with your skewed shit.</br>  I'm just waiting for KoG to get some more trips.<br><br>I would try for trips myself, but I know I'd miss.</br></br>  <br> your crush will never stare at you passionately </br>  <br>qt</br>  <br>HELL</br>  <br><br>You should have more confidence in yourself!</br></br>    <br>And this is why /padt/ is getting hated even by the other threads on /vp/.</br>  <br>why is she such a qt?</br>  So is it safe to say that Serena is a slut?  <br>You mean the /v/-infested threads that hate all of /a/ too?</br>   you will never have your way with this whore <br><br>why live?</br></br>  <br> taking up one post from a spamming fag <br><br>shit example Mami. Besides, the rest of /vp/ is just showderp.</br></br></br>  <br> voter turnout: 38 </br>  <br><br>A wild Doublade appeared!<br><br>Go, Seaking!</br></br></br></br>  <br> your crush will never compliment on your looks </br>  <br>They probably hate it more because Masuda's on board instead of making a new game.</br>  <br>of course</br>  <br>/vp/ is a complete shithole these days.</br>  <br>At least crop porn from GOOD artists.</br>  <br>fuck you ash ketchum</br>  <br>Well, you're right.<br>It's why I barely go on anymore except for livestream threads.</br></br>  <br> last OP was shit edition <br><br>I laughed</br></br></br>  <br>/v/ side of /vp/ is angry because Masuda is busy shipping ash serena instead of focusing on a new game</br>  <br>i now know what it feels like to agree with a tripfag for the first time</br>  <br>What happens when there's no new game. You know, /v/ and what not.</br>  Why did it take so long for the writers to give us Pokemon anime watchers such a good sex object like Serena?    <br><br>Serena knows how get Ash interest</br></br>  <br>ITS TIME</br>    I'm just waiting for KoG to get 3333 so I can go to bed already. :^)  <br> /vp/ is /s4s/ </br>  <br>like this?</br>    <br><br><br>I love how the deviantart links are just plastered on the page itself.</br></br></br>  Guys, why is this "serena" so fucking cute and why is she interested with ash  <br>I so badly want to put my cock into her. Serena is so fucking hot.</br>  <br>http://kisarasmoon.deviantart.com/j<wbr>ournal/Misty-is-Ash-s-only-girl-Sor<wbr>ry-Serena-438232217</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>When she was a child, Serena visited Kanto and went to Oak's Summer Camp. There, she met Ash, who helped her after she got injured. To be precise, Serena got bruised and Ash covered the wounds with a napkin (IIRC). Many years later, Serena continued to have that napkin and waited for the day she would again meet that young boy.</br>  <br> short hair <br>its shit.</br></br>    <br>Fuck off you idiotic tripfag.</br>  <br><br>Just go to bed already.</br></br>  <br>Falling on deaf ears.<br>Who would have thought all the people who used to come into these threads and talk about how they haven't watched pokemon in 10 years would be that much more preferable to the way they are now?<br><br><br>Here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> still not watching XY <br>Step the fuck up anon</br></br></br>  <br>I feel your pain anon.

It's been at least a decade.</br>  <br> Someone actually typed all of that out </br>  <br> why </br>  can somebody tell me if serena is flat-chested?<br><br>it's very important to know...</br></br>   Walk into room <br> See this <br>what do?</br></br>  <br> May I recommend Millefeui? </br>  <br><br> Jessica is better. </br></br>  <br>Why shit on him when he's helpful?<br><br>Otherwise, sure, but when he actually contributes?</br></br></br>      <br> Mami comfirmed Jessicafag <br>You never really left /padt/ did you?</br></br>  Dumping our main subbing sponsor<br><br>http://pocketmonsters.edwardk.info/<wbr>#PocketMonstersXYSubbed<br><br>get all fresh episodes here for free!</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Ash is indestructable.

Apparently, French dub went all out by having Ash say the ribbon matched eyes and it was beautiful like them or something like that. </br>  <br>There are at least three Jessicafags there including me.<br><br>https://archive.moe/vp/post/2379419<wbr>1/<br>https://archive.moe/vp/post/2379422<wbr>3/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>He is literally the only person. <br>At least since lucariopk disappeared off the face of the Earth.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Here you go.

That shit was cancer.</br>  Why are they so perfect for each other  <br>The french probably did that because Serena is French.<br><br>Which is funny, because there is no france in pokemon</br></br></br>  what a qt  <br>Original has Ash compliment Serena's look, English dub has Ash indirectly calling Serena cute, and French dub pulled that shit.</br>  <br>bonnie wont be sleeping tonight due to loud moaning wet dream by serena</br>  <br>Break the handcuffs and escort her to the toilet.</br>      <br>Try not forgot that they're both ten. Unless the series goes in a very different direction, they won't be staying together for long.</br>  Did the circlejerk really have to come to /a/  <br> Try not forgot that they're both ten </br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Seems like that's what they're going for.</br>  <br>how the fuck is that even Amour</br>  <br>we know that they are ten, anon<br><br><br>yes its not</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's my issue with Amour as of late, people jump on every single interaction and scream 'AMOUR! AMOUR!'<br><br>Hell I like it and how Pokemon is finally having the guts to add romance elements. However some people take it to autistic levels and get very hostile about it</br></br></br>  <br>This anime needs to end Ash's suffering. It would be good though if he wins this girl too.</br>  <br> not liking cute </br>  <br> not being able to read </br>  <br> Hell I like it and how Pokemon is finally having the guts to add romance elements. However some people take it to autistic levels and get very hostile about it <br>This. Though to be fair, all Pokemon ships since the dawn of time (i.e. Pokeshipping and Rocketshipping) are guilty of the same thing. It's just that Amour has more moments and more blatant moments than other ships.</br></br>  <br>Haven't watch pokemon for years now, what is this.<br><br>How about the children</br></br></br>  When you gents say "Amour", what are you referring to?  <br>what they call ash serena ship</br>  <br> what is this <br>Shipping</br></br>  <br>Literally shipping on a ship<br> inb4 someone posts that 4 mb amour collection </br></br>  <br>What about the children?</br>  <br><br>Because it's pointless to trip in a thread like this, and only serves to seek attention. Fuck off idiot.</br></br>  <br>I don't buy it. It's probably the name of a new series or something.</br>  <br><br><br>What power does pokemon animators have to draw cute shit like this</br></br></br>  <br> Ash's free hand going right for Serena's ass. <br><br>Smooth.</br></br></br>  <br>try searching amourshipping</br>  <br> new Pokemon anime genera on /vp/ uses nurse Serena too <br>kek</br></br>  <br>how about shipping on a kitchen?</br>  <br>Okay, I believe you.</br>  <br>Female animators.</br>  ayy check those abs  New episode just got announced<br><br> XY087: Bonnie Will Take Care of You!

(Sep 10th) <br><br>Muh heart</br></br></br></br>  <br> better point out this totally expected turn of events as unexpected </br>  <br>serena pls</br>  <br>Kekked at those last 4 seconds.</br>  <br> mods are incompetent shitstains <br>woah</br></br>  <br>/vp/ is the worst moderated board on the entire 4chan for some reason. We had like 50 porn threads at once a couple weeks ago.</br>  <br>I hope they tune down the tan to be closer to what Ash used to be.</br>  <br>NO STOPPING THE TAN MACHINE UNTIL WE ARE MARLON</br>  <br>He was always tan. It just became more obvious when they went digital.</br>  Best girl coming through  <br> being this right </br>   implying this shit will ever go anywhere <br>Serena is going to be replaced by another girl next region and you know it</br>  <br>we jojo time</br>  <br>You'll get destroyed if you say this on the Anime General on /vp/</br>    <br>Shit's been going somewhere though.</br>  When's the regional Ash crossdressing episode? I just want to see Serena react to that  <br>nah that's probably /vg/. The /vg/ mod is a dota 2 player but can't even be bothered to look after that shithole of a thread</br>  <br>I'm still waiting</br>    <br>BEST</br>    <br>Why would you visit /vp/ in the first place? It's like going to /mlp/-lite.</br>  <br>Valerie never had a chance</br>  <br>She never did</br>  <br>Everything? Serena is literally the childhood friend/devoted waifu with enough substance on the side that /a/ has been looking everywhere for.</br>  <br> Apparently, French dub went all out by having Ash say the ribbon matched eyes and it was beautiful like them or something like that </br>  <br> there's still no porn of these two </br>          <br>narutoad</br>    <br>not posting the MvP</br>  <br><br> that onesie <br><br>cute</br></br></br></br>  I hear anime Valerie was into shotas. True?    <br>This isn't your blog.</br>  <br>She's into a recurring shota character literally NAMED Shota.</br>    How is /a/ and /vp/ gushing over amour any different that tumblrtards gushing over their pairings of SherlockxWatson?  TOO CLOSE    <br>Shit this is pretty accurate, May, Rosa and Cynthia are all top tier</br>  Why is this not on /vp/?<br><br>Thats where this belongs</br></br>  <br>There was an /a/ pol but I dont have the link and Serena won there with 200+ people participated</br>  <br>its not</br>  <br>Eh It's probably not. Different I mean. It's a funny old world isn't it?</br>  <br> Bonnie Will Take Care of You <br> Pampered <br>Calling it, Clemont's invention of the episode will be a microwave.</br></br></br>  <br>Truly a crime</br>  <br>I don't know. But we got to feel like we're better than some other arbitrary group of people somehow right? I mean how else could we call ourselves human?</br>  Soooo... are they gonna bang or what?  <br>It's literally a subplot in the series and not just headcanon?</br>    <br>This pic is missing pepe.</br>  <br>threads are too hype right now for sadfrog</br>  <br>She gets Ash going</br>  <br>They get each other going.</br>  Are you enjoying the ride?  <br>3dpd</br>  Hi res nurserena  JUST ENJOY THE RIDE  <br><br><br>If the anime doesnt end without ash getting the girl idk what to say</br></br></br>  <br>We have about two years left and those two are developing quite well</br>    <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>Execs are pushing them hard</br>    <br>Can't wait for Hall of anal devastation 2.0</br>  <br><br><br><br>My dick is diamonds</br></br></br></br>  <br> hall of anal devistation 2 <br>it will be glorious<br>also what's up with the shipping in mainstream anime, first Nalt, then Pokemon and now even YGO Arc-V</br></br></br>  <br> not a single 5 <br>you messed up</br></br>  <br>reminds us that we are already too old and we need to find ours</br>       show is totally for kids   <br>Oh wow. Maybe I should pick this up.</br>    <br>Join the fun</br>  What is going on?  <br>It's like the cheapest way to get a regular audience.</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  <br>You are right though</br>  <br> bonnie knows <br>can't wait till she spills it out</br></br>  <br>Isn't this an Harem trope. Is pokemon secretly a harem show for kids?!</br>  <br>After the BW disaster I guess they wanted anything that would make the audience come back for more. Pretty sure Serena's character alone drew a lot of new fans in.</br>  Is Serena the reason Ash doesn't lose every single fight this generation (in fact he wins most of them)?  <br><br>For 20 years Dat Ash will finally score.</br></br>  <br>Everybody is crazy for the Ash in this region, anon</br>  <br>God knows that I've wanted to pick this back up because Serena and OP Ash is back.</br>  <br>She's gonna get replaced next season</br>  <br>Two gym battles implied it, also Ash helping Serena on her dream</br>  <br>The battles are awfully nice too.<br><br>But then you have the mandatory insipid pokemon fillers.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn.</br>  <br> they put a lot of effort into developing her <br> even gave her a new design midway which made her more unique to her game counterpart <br><br>If ever Ash loses and makes it to next region (which could be southern to kalos or east to poke germany), he might bring Serena with him.<br><br>Or they might just end the anime on a high note of Ash winning league and Serena then reboot for next gen  with possibly son/daughter of both will be mc </br></br></br></br></br></br>  God fucking damnit, take your Amourshit back to /vp/'s anime general and stay there. Actual discussion is impossible there thanks to the amourfags.  <br>Lots of people on 2ch said they dropped the show after the fucking disaster that was BW86 (good for them, the show managed to get even worse not too long after) then came back when XY started.<br><br>The execs KNOW BW was poorly received and cost them viewers.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Ash score an aryan QT <br> yfw you will never get to score an aryan QT, let a lone a girl </br></br>  How much anal devastation would happen if Ash x Serena becomes the real deal at the end?  <br><br>Why would there be any anal devastation? This is not fucking Naruto.</br></br>  <br>Dropped it at the start of BW, came back around XY26 when I found Ash was back at Sinnoh levels and a girl liking him.<br><br><br>Fuckton of nostalgia fags will be caught unaware over the internet, probably can cause more devastation than naruto since misty was mostly a part of their childhood</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bowl. Eggs. Etc.</br>  <br> he doesn't know nostalgiafags </br>  <br>At least be happy anon, we have been riding with him throughout our lifetime and he'll get married before we do too.</br>  <br>anime mistyfags are the worst</br>  <br>You missed out on the one good thing that came from BW</br>  <br>I watched BW after reaching XY latest, hell it was a shitty ride but it had its ups too like your pic related.</br>  <br><br>and just how many are there? 5?</br></br>  <br>There was a website dedicated to it, owner of bulbapedia is a big pokeshipper and had a cult following him. Also almost every normies you ask about the anime, they remember misty ash and brock</br>  <br>I liked her too. Man BW just shat all over its own potential.</br>  <br>Ash is such a lucky cunt</br>  <br>Bitch please, they even have their own Chatte.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Insane Narutard with delicious tears.</br>  <br>fanartist on deviantart, who can either imitate or trace their artstyle like hell<br>also insane NaruSakutard, who was salty about chapter 700</br></br>  <br>oops, this is LadyGT, who I described...</br>  <br>Some NS hambeast who created an insane theory of how the ending in genjuutsu and Kishi is gonna show the true ending soon. She have been saying this since November and every time something new is released she get BTFO.</br>  <br><br>I know who Chatte is. I was asking who is the Chatte of the Pokemon fandom</br></br>  <br>Some Mistyfag on tumblr called Suift.<br>Some retard keeps reposting his shit on /vp/ despite it always getting deleted at shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Swifty, he have been in the fandom since forever. He used to dwell in Bulbapedo forums no he has a Tumblr with in tinfoil hat theories.<br>Just look a this: http://suift-duroo.tumblr.com/tagge<wbr>d/the-bonnie-and-misty-connection</wbr></br></br>  <br>You know? Even if he is bullshitting and knows it, his friends and followers are probably impressionable kids who will think this is actually legit.</br>  <br>Is the same with Chatte actually, they know they are bullshitting but they are attention whores who like to be worshipped by 15 year old.</br>  <br>He advertises that he works on video games on his blog which is basically only about Pokémon, so honestly this theory holds quite a bit of water to me.</br>  <br>The breast still bother me.</br>  <br>oh boy</br>  Pokemon anime has always been just advertisement for the games. They'll need to ship Serena back home to make room for the next game's female character to join the party  <br>fuck</br>  <br>Suift also dates a girl who meet on Serebii (she was a Pokeshipper too) and the girl was underage when they meet and start dating so I wouldbe careful with him. He can be a predator.</br>  <br>Make that two good things.</br>  /a/ pokegirl poll results:<br><br>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1El<wbr>1f1F8zXviEONk5y0Uy2dntwVkCqrF_Hpyo5<wbr>j2yIWA/viewanalytics?usp=form_confi<wbr>rm</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Stopped wacthing pokemon after sinnoh ended and i don't regret<br>Xy have better animation but without a proper rival i can't het into it<br>Plus all the episodes repeat the same formula and are the same.

The relationship will go nowhere and the girl will leave at the end as always.  <br>sauce?</br>  <br> ashfags are just THAT delusional </br>  <br>Just watch the gym battles then.</br>  <br> Actual discussion is impossible there thanks to the amourfags. <br> implying there can be actual discussion about this show </br></br>  <br>You have absolutely no idea how desperate people are for something different to happen in this franchise</br>  <br>Nothing different happened in 18 years, if you have some sort of self respect you should stop expecting it and go to a better franchise.</br>  <br> Namefag <br> This whole fucking post <br>Please tell me that this is just cheap bait and not some summerfag trying to fit in.</br></br></br>  <br><br> watching pokemon for relationships <br> self-respect </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt most people who grew up with it and moved on will care. Naruto had people following it to adulthood but pokemon has mostly children audience excluding the crazy neckbeards ITT</br>  <br>Exactly my point.</br>  <br>What does self-respect have to do with anything? Are you faggot from /vp/ or something?</br>  <br> What does self-respect have to do with anything? <br> Watch a show expecting it to deliver <br> it doesnt <br> keep watching next season so it may deliver anyways <br> repeat for 18 years/6 gens <br><br>It's pretty obvious<br><br> Are you faggot from /vp/ or something? <br>I'm regular on /vp/, yeah. But /vp/ worships this show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't I just be having fun watching a show and hoping for something that will never happen? I'm confused as to why you're confused.</br>  <br>So you like being dissapointed?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he's gay</br>  <br>If I were disappointed why would I continue watching the show? If you stopped trying to reconcile what I'm saying with your preconceived strawman instead of simply understanding what I'm saying you'd understand.</br>  Normally I always say short hair is gay as fuck.<br><br>But I'm just joking, because short hair is the best.<br>Serena a cute.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm just watching for the battles. The canon shipping is icing.</br></br>  <br> If I were disappointed why would I continue watching the show? <br>no self respect. You could be watching a show where shit actually happens, there's a lot of animee out there.<br><br><br> of simply understanding what I'm saying <br>You're literally saying you actively want the show to do things that you know it wont.<br>If you dont see how that's at least odd, you're retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>there's something really suggestive about the way he handles those cakes</br></br>  <br>What makes you think I'm only watching Pokemon? Is everyone from /vp/ this retarded? Listen, if you're too retarded to understand what I'm telling you then so be it. It's not my problem.</br>    <br> where shit actually happens <br><br>things happen in the show. just because he hasn't become a pokemon master doesn't mean nothing happens.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow.</br>  <br><br>underrated post</br></br>  This hardcore shipping proves they want this generation to be the last.  <br> no hex <br> shauntal: 4 <br>I'm glad I left that shithole</br></br></br>  <br> What makes you think I'm only watching Pokemon? <br>Well, if you have a standard to compare this show with, then you're more stupid than I thought.<br><br>  Listen, if you're too retarded to understand what I'm telling you then so be it. It's not my problem. <br>good argument<br><br><br> things happen in the show <br>everything that "happens" is moot because it gets discarded/retconned at the next season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its only 38 people, which is a tiny fraction of /vp/'s users<br><br>nice digits</br></br></br>  iturazkondea  <br> Well, if you have a standard to compare this show with, then you're more stupid than I thought. <br>I can't just enjoy watching a show? Just fuck off already you sound like those /v/ fags who only watch mature anime for mature individuals such as themselves and think 99% of anime is shit.</br></br>  <br> its only 38 people, which is a tiny fraction of /vp/'s users <br>I wouldn't be so sure.<br><br>That place is getting deader by the second.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I can't just enjoy watching a show? <br>It's not that simple.<br>Firstly, that's not what ashfags do and this thread proves it. There's already a containment thread and instead of using that you not only spam /vp/ but also this board.<br>Secondly, the pokemon franchise has a big potential for an anime show which it cant have since this shit exist. So it's not a case of "if you dont enjoy it dont watch it" since its actively ruining a franchise that would otherwise be pretty much perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br>First, I don't post on /vp/, so I can't help you there. Second, the existence of shipfaggotry doesn't mean that you can't discuss the show. Instead of complaining about people enjoying the show differently from you just discuss the show.</br>   Stopped watching Pokémon around the second season of Johto <br> Occasionally watch an episode if it's on TV, but don't follow the series anymore <br> See people making a fuss about the new series <br>Seems pretty cool, might pick it u--<br> Ash is still 10 years old despite YEARS passing within the anime itself <br>What the actual fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't like this show so I must spam every thread I see about it to make sure people know that I'm the boss of 4chan and decide hat people can't discuss where. <br><br>Kindly kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>It's a cartoon, you dildo.</br>  <br>It's a cartoon with an overarching plot that progresses over time. Ash has even had a birthday or two within the series, so he should at least be 12 or 13.<br>Traveling takes time, especially travelling on foot, like they do for most of the show, so there's that time lapsed, too.</br></br>  <br> First, I don't post on /vp/, so I can't help you there <br>/vp/ is the pokemon board. Discuss pokemon there.<br><br> Second, the existence of shipfaggotry doesn't mean that you can't discuss the show. Instead of complaining about people enjoying the show differently from you just discuss the show. <br>What's there to discuss? Nothing there will deliver or have any kind of meaning in the end, its pointless.<br><br><br> decide hat people can't discuss where. <br>Ok, lets discuss live action tv shows here then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>You're applying real life logic to pokemon which you shouldnt........except when explaining why Ash is not the champion, then its ok to be realistic.</br>  <br>Live action tv shows aren't anime or manga, you retarded nigger.<br><br>Just hide the thread if you hate it so much.</br></br></br>  <br> /vp/ is the pokemon board. Discuss pokemon there. <br>The pokemon anime is an anime. I'll discuss it here.<br> What's there to discuss? Nothing there will deliver or have any kind of meaning in the end, its pointless. <br>You could say the same about the anime. The point is that you're autistic enough to want to tell other people how they should enjoy the show.<br> Ok, lets discuss live action tv shows here then. <br>If you had read the rules you'd know that Live Action adaptations of /a/ material can be discussed on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So? Pokemon already has a board. Go there.<br><br><br> The pokemon anime is an anime. <br>the pokemon games are vidya, the TCG is a traditional game, the manga is a manga. The entire reason /vp/ exists is to discuss it instead of /a/,/v/ and /tg/.<br><br> You could say the same about the anime.  <br>Yeah, that's my point.<br><br> If you had read the rules you'd know that Live Action adaptations of /a/ material can be discussed on /a/. <br>How about live action shows that dont adapt /a/ material. They should be discussed here according to you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Delia at 1 vote <br>wtf /vp/</br></br>  <br>I'm just want the show to move on to someone besides Ash and Pikachu</br>  <br> How about live action shows that dont adapt /a/ material. They should be discussed here according to you. <br>How? I'm saying that people discussing the Pokemon anime on /a/ is normal. What's confusing about this?</br></br>  <br> How?  <br>Because you dont give a shit about board division.<br><br> I'm saying that people discussing the Pokemon anime on /a/ is normal. <br>normal!=right</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if it was wrong why is this thread still here?</br>  <br>Yaaaaas</br>  <br>I don't give a shit that the /vp/ board exists. If I want to discuss the Pokemon anime on /a/ I will do so. I won't have to visit the shitboard that is /vp/.<br><br>This thread is not an extension of the /vp/ board, it's an anime thread on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>You know people can make mistakes do you?<br><br><br> If I want to discuss the Pokemon anime on /a/ I will do so. <br>So you will ignore the board divisions? Fine.<br><br>  I won't have to visit the shitboard that is /vp/. <br>Nigga, you want to have serious discussion about what's objectively the worst anime ever made, you can't call anything shit.<br>And in fact, literally the reason /vp/ is shit is people like you.<br><br> This thread is not an extension of the /vp/ board, it's an anime thread on /a/. <br> muh word tricks <br>There's a pokemon board. Use that for discussion of the pokemon franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess people can't discuss mecha anime here, since /m/ exists.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off you autist. Go post in a thread about something you enjoy instead of shitting up threads you don't like.<br><br>Or cute anime, or have sadpanda threads.</br></br></br>  <br> despite YEARS passing within the anime itself <br><br>citation needed<br><br>no one in the anime has aged</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, ideally not since that's the very reason /m/ exists.<br><br>Though you could argue that there's not a board for specific mecha franchises like pokemon has.<br><br><br> ashfag telling people not to get in their threads <br>Oh, the irony.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what an ashfag is.</br>  <br> Iris beating misty <br><br>There is a god</br></br></br>  <br> ashfag telling people not to get in their threads <br><br>i don't think you know what irony means.</br></br></br>  <br> despite YEARS passing within the anime itself <br>This isn't true<br><br><br> Ash has even had a birthday or two within the series, so he should at least be 12 or 13. <br>This is not true at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you're also new?<br><br><br> I have no arguments left </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>clearly you don't. your statement implies that "ashfags" raid other threads to shitpost, like you're doing.</br></br>  Old thread<br><br><br> http://typemoon.com/news/2015/tdkk<wbr>5n</wbr> <br>DELETING CACHE WILL FUCK UP YOUR GAME!

Make her look like a fatty.</br>  <br>They are overreacting because of the cache thing. Just a bunch of whiners.</br>  I am in awe of Gaius Julius Caesar.<br><br>He's a fat fuck and yet I am drawn to his self-confidence.</br></br>  <br>Because the mushroom is a huge Dark Souls fan</br>    <br>Because this game is going to work in as many dark souls references as possible</br>  So how does it fuck up your game exactly.  <br>Nah they're bitching about the cache thing. I got Mata Hari and I'm not complaining.<br><br>Accept your destiny, befriend your Servant.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are the designs for the female servants so fucking shitty?</br>    <br>I wonder what From thinks of it.</br>  <br>Is his hero jacket fused with his shirt?</br>  <br>That's not from the game though.</br>  <br>He has traits that the likely player audience identify with (you know what) and traits they want but will likely never have.

Their whole mobage division seems pretty ill-conceived in the first place between this and that home appliances game. It's bad enough they can't even come up with their own franchises and have to rely on Type/Moon and Nitroplus all the time nowadays, they clearly can't even properly develop a simple cell phone game and get it out at launch in working order. There will almost assuredly be patches, but I would be concerned about getting the game just yet if you have any long term plans with it.</br></br>      <br>This isn't even his final form.</br>  What's her actual identity called?

Any more information on that server maintenance?    <br>Prototype Lancer best Lancer</br>  <br>go design &gt;proto</br>  <br>That design was confirmed to be in the game ages ago.</br>  <br>Shit game</br>  So....<br> What are the prices for the gems? </br>  <br>Stupid sexy Shirou.</br>  <br>Its one of his forms, it was in the trailer.<br><br>This stil gives me hope for berserker cu</br></br></br>  I installed it through qooapp or w/e, I start it and it goes to a screen and I think I get an error 88- 1438278512 then it closes.  <br><br>I meant for the official VN.</br></br>  <br>So, he is like Gilgamesh, no? The same tattoo</br>  So anybody not in Japan have this game yet?  Best Seiba.  Here's the pastebin from /fgo/ on how to get the game working in case you're a newfag<br><br> http://pastebin.com/Nsg98EEf </br></br>  <br>Goddamn, Shirou and Sakura are perfection itself, I must have more of this!</br>  <br>We were playing it when the servers went manteinance.</br>  <br>It's different hero. Like SaberLily. His first slightly armorless form was teased in first trailers.</br>      <br>Yup. Just deleted everything since I've wasted an hour on it with no success.</br>  <br><br>I love how they went for the arm cloth and japanese motif for both of them.</br></br>  <br>Oppai Rin &gt; Japanese Sakura</br>  <br>I like Sakura's haircut. It gives her more personality</br>  <br>I don't get why he's dressed some two thousand years out of style.</br>  So anyone get out of the burning Fuyuki map before maintenance came down? Where do you go next?  <br>Thank you, anon.</br>  <br><br>It's under maintenance.</br></br>  AMERICA FUCK YEAH  <br>That's a server maintenance notification</br>  <br>Best design Takeuchi made in a while. I love it.</br>  <br>What's this? Early adult Sakura?</br>  <br>If you have garbage taste, sure.</br>  <br>They even got his name right, as opposed to 300.</br>  <br>Same reason Nero is a little girl</br>  <br>Shirou's arm shirt is a reference from HF and Sakuras arm shit is from her future design.</br>  <br>He's dressed a lot like Nero, if you look at his top and bottom parts you'll notice its very Rome.<br><br>Nero also has that business thing.</br></br></br>  <br> liking wormslut </br>  <br>First time I legit liked the way Sakura looked.</br>    <br>Who is this?</br>  <br> liking rhinos </br>  Why do they keep milking this shit franchise?  <br>Calamity Jane</br>  <br>Calamity Jane apparently.</br>  <br>Guys, you do realise we might see this design animated in the epilogue of the HF movie, right?</br>  <br>Who is the artist? For *slurp* future references</br>  <br>In F/SN Sakura is 15, here she is probably 17-18</br>  <br>Fortunately I'm not an anime only ufo cocksucker.</br>  <br>How do we go from this to that?</br>  <br>epic anime meme dude doesnt change the fact that she in the VN a wormslut</br>  <br> *slurp* <br>That's my dick you're slurping there, faggot.<br><br>Don't stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is just me or Sakura goes full CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT here?</br>  <br>Of course they are going to say that. They don't want you to keep rerolling for 5* for free after all.</br>  <br>Her "character" was always pretty "developed".</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>That is fake, you guys have no sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet they added that "feature" after the last maintenance.</br>  <br>That would require short hair. This, however, is clearly not.</br>  <br>The FATTEST Seibah.<br><br> Arturia got her looks from Nero <br> she got her appetite from Julius </br></br></br></br>  <br>All makes sense now.</br>   Caesar has B rank Agility   <br>Why, it's true.</br>  How many times can you reroll?  <br>Euralie, I take it?</br>  <br>Stheno.</br>  <br>Stheno.</br>  <br>Sutenno. The heck?</br>    <br>Stheno, learn to read</br>  where is the OP, no one has it yet?  <br>Is that her endurance and magic being ex-rank?</br>  <br/>  <br><br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Sorry, I didn't put much Talent Points in nipspeech.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an acrofat</br>  <br>Now seriously, both of them have the japanese style and arm cloth thing. You are just being desperate here.</br>  <br>Not really. I wasn't baiting anyone.</br>  <br>Old and busted<br><br><br>New hotness</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bitch looks like Timmy Williams from Whitest Kids You Know.</br>  <br>It's Luck and Magic Resistance.</br>  <br>Magic and Luck</br>  <br>I had it loaded in one tab, but couldn't copy it from the cache. I got bored of watching it with no sound so I closed it.<br><br>I posted all those screenshots in this and the old thread.</br></br></br>  <br>He is just calling bait to random stuff he doesn't like or something like that.</br>  <br>Only thing they got in common is the japanese outfit retardo.</br>  <br> Stheno <br> Servant <br> Assassin <br>Jesus Christ, how is it even possible?</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying wormslut isn't a meme <br><br><br>Yeah you gotta justify that shit taste somehow don't you?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeuchi <br>Nakahara, the artist for prototype, made it. Unless you're talking about Shirou's design?</br></br>  <br><br>so thats means lancer is also the same </br></br>  <br>Yes, and that is what I said? The Rin, Sakura and Shirou cards are supposed to be a set, you retard.</br>  <br> EX Luck <br>Oh boy, you don't need anything else with fucking EX luck.</br></br>  <br>He lacks the japanese motif. Also, he is not a support card.</br>  <br>What's the different between 4star shirou and 5star shirou? Also I don't think the 5 star shirou's name is written Emiya Shirou at all.</br>  <br>Not happening</br>  <br>Different effect. They are not character cards, they are support cards.</br>  NASUUUUUUUUU  <br>Attack</br>  <br>I mean this one</br>  <br>They're stat increases for your servant. Not servants.</br>  <br>That didn't help Drake tho.<br><br>So the Mona Lisa is a self portrait in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br>   meme <br>it's like you even didn't play the VN<br> please shinji fuck me because muh worms </br></br>  <br>Apparently the Mona Lisa was a self-portrait</br>   all these people caring about a mobage in japanese   <br>What thought process do you think Nasu goes through to decide which historical figure gets genderbent?</br>  <br> Mona Lisa is a self portrait <br>Clever</br></br>  <br>I don't understand why anybody would have a problem with genderbent characters. It's better to make them women.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind the hair cut showing up in the epilouge.</br>  <br>meant for </br>  <br>He compares how cool the are as a male to how cute/sexy they would be as a female.</br>  <br> rape means she's a slut <br><br>Sasuga anon-kun</br></br></br>  Okay, so we know that they're both shit but who's the bigger offender?<br><br>Also, post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it.</br></br>   Hana kana  <br> shit  <br>Yeah, she's mainstream as fuck but damn she really got the talent. See her performance in The Garden of Words and you'll realize that she's not that really bad. <br><br>Amalia Sora on the other hand is a different story. Her performance in Aldnoah Zero and Akame Ga Kill is just inconsistent. I feel like her Hime voice fits her much better. It's like a lower pitched voice of Yui Horie's. She's just being pushed around for roles that doesn't really suit her voice (as of now). Give her some time to be more versatile and she'll turn out fine. It's just that her talent agency is pushing her around too much without giving her enough time to adjust.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Fuck off.<br><br> post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it <br>You first, let's see how great your taste is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got more roles like this.</br>  HanaKana had to work hard to gain her popularity while Amamiya is just Sony's puppet.  <br>left &gt; right</br>  <br> hanakana <br> shit <br>Please don't bring your subjective opinion here, hanakana is famous for a reason</br></br></br>  <br> hanakana is famous for a reason <br>Yeah, because so many people like cutesy voice, which is fine in moderation but that's the only voice she ever use.</br></br>  <br> HanaKana had to work hard <br>And you think other seiyuu (not talking about Sora) don't work as hard as her? She got lucky she voiced popular/likable characters early in her career and when Osawa saw they can milk the fuck out of her they just kept the ball rolling.</br></br>  Hanakana just need more crazy roles, her usual "cute" castings are shit.  <br>I was just comparing the 2 of them and you suddenly feel the need to get all defensive? Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days.</br>  <br>KanaHana is actually talented and her voice is pleasant to listen to. Amamiya ranges from okay to makes me want to rip my fucking ears out.</br>  <br>Sawashiro is the best.</br>  <br>Mah nigga. She's always a treat to listen to.</br>  <br>You're praising HanaKana just because you think she worked hard when her workrate was average before she became popular.</br>  <br> that's the only voice she ever use <br>What about Rize?<br>What about Akane?<br>What about the love interest from Kotonoha no Niwa?</br></br></br></br>  <br> her workrate was average before she became popular <br>Stop lying and kindly fuck off. <br><br>Seiyuu with the most annoying fans on /a/:<br>1. Yuuki Aoi<br>2. Sakura Ayane</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akane sounds the same as her usual roles though. Didn't watch the other 2 so I can't say anything about them.</br>  <br> Stop lying and kindly fuck off.  <br>Prove it asshole. Show me how she worked hard during her early career instead of talking out of your ass.</br></br>  Sawashiro and Chiwa Saito are my favorites in terms of talent, but I do love HanaKana the most.  <br>Can you prove otherwise? No. <br><br>One can only conclude that she worked hard because she had so many roles. Can't be lazy and still do that many work.</br></br></br>  <br>  HanaKana <br>  shit <br>Do you even Renai Circulation?</br></br></br>  any canadabros out there, see if you can meet up with tyrant-chan in 2 weeks if you want  <br>Gentlemen, I present to you: a deaf person</br>  <br>I do<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4l7<wbr>n71K0R7o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Wow this thread really turns to shit fast.<br><br><br><br>I'll hopefully meet her, will be in Canada for a month or so.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinks Akane sounds different from the usual HanaKana roles <br> call other people deaf <br><br>There's only one deaf faggot here and it's certainly you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Kana Hana is so beautiful. She doesn't look like your average Japanese girl. She doesn't have that "round face" that makes so many Asian girls ugly.</br>  <br> Can you prove otherwise? <br>Yes.<br><br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8<wbr>A%B1%E6%BE%A4%E9%A6%99%E8%8F%9C<br><br>See her roles for anime, game, and drama CD pre 2008 and count how many they were. Not so many, huh? Also count the number of radio shows pre 2008. One can only conclude that her workrate is the same as the average young seiyuu and she was lucky because she voiced likable and popular girls in her early career.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>   post superiors seiyuus <br><br>I happen to be an expert on this subject. A superior seiyuu all around.</br></br>  <br>Trips confirmed, miyukichi best seiyuu</br>  <br> she was only lucky <br>Is every Aoifag as bitter as this faggot?</br></br>  <br>Is every HanaKanafag as delusional as this faggot?</br>  <br>Taneda has a beautiful voice, but who is the absolute best of the best?</br>  <br><br>Yes to both questions.</br></br>  <br>you can tell it's her, yes.<br><br>But you also can tell Magneto is fuckin Ian McKellen, still it's different from his Gandalf.<br><br>So does she voice act in a different style in that role than in some below average harem shit? Yes she does and it's audible.<br>She has a range. Not a range as others might have, but also not as small as some might think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was lucky because she has a voice like that. no matter what role she did in her early career sooner or later someone's gonna recognize her and put her in a good show/role.</br>  <br>My personal favorite is Ayaya and Yukina(I think this is her go to voice).<br><br>Rory sounds very sexy though.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only average, many of the insanely popular seiyuu started off with those one-off gigs and years of voicing "Girl C" and "Boy in convenience store"<br><br>Without luck, they won't get big. Without any talent whatsoever they won't stay big.</br></br></br>  <br>You just don't get it. She wouldn't be this popular if she voiced shit characters like Haruna, Kirino, Mikono, etc. When you're a young seiyuu you pray to the voice gods that you get roles that are likable or popular so you can ride on the popularity of the characters you voiced and when everyone notices you voice "best" girls then you can voice shit characters and no one would care, the fans will eat up your shit. Voicing popular and likable characters is the key to becoming popular.</br>  <br> lucky people can't be hardworking <br><br>Again, how can she be lazy and still do so many roles? Almost everyone needs a lucky break (i.e popular roles) to kickstart their career to a higher level but if she didn't work hard there's no way she can build on that initial popularity to be as popular as she is today. <br><br>You just sound like a bitter retard who can't accept Hanakana's popularity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer to Mousou Express</br>  <br> how can she be lazy <br>She's not. Where in my post did I imply she was lazy? I said her workrate is average just like most seiyuu and it's nothing to brag about, retard.</br></br>  I want to hold hands with Aoi!  Post music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gmy<wbr>oRq-lYps</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ODe<wbr>NAOifss0</wbr>  [ ]<br>http://en.musicplayon.com/play?v=96<wbr>1626</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> workrate is average because she didn't get many roles early in her career <br>Seems like you're the one talking out of your ass. There's now way she can have many roles as some newbie. What matters is what she did once she got a lucky break and everything seems to indicate her as hardworking based on how many works she did every season.<br><br>Faggot like you can't even counter what I said in my post. You seems to be very angry about the fact that some people won the genetic lottery and they can build on that by working hard, yes, working hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All seiyuu who are serious about it work hard. She got a break because of talent and luck.</br>  Reminder among her major roles since 2014, Sora Amamiya only have 2 roles that did not involve Sony Music in the production committee of those anime.  <br> implying Amamiya Sora works hard </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jxy<wbr>IV9si5eg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YGg<wbr>ZS_uP_0k</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zY_<wbr>Tp7QLHyg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, retard.</br>   there are people on /a/ right now who like this slut   <br>Those fucking  Sonyggers .</br>   Aoifags vs KanaHanafags <br>It will never end</br>  <br>I'm not even a KanaHanafag and I don't think she is as bad as what Aoifags want people to believe. Though her same voice syndrome can really get irritating sometimes. Same with Yuuki Aoi and her grating stock voice.</br>  Tanechan is 100x better than Amamiya Sora and 2x better than Hanazawa Kana.  <br> Seems like you're the one talking out of your ass <br>You're accusing me of talking out of my ass when you're the one who hasn't provided a lick of evidence as to why she's hard working. Tell me anon, what makes her hard working? Show me concrete examples and not some stupid logic you formulated in your head.</br></br>  <br>She looks dirty.<br><br>I like that.</br></br></br>  <br>According to this anon, yes. <br><br> everything seems to indicate her as hardworking based on how many works she did every season <br>So Sora worked harder than HanaKana because she had more roles in her starting career?</br></br></br></br>  Superior Seiyuu flying through  Can Hanazawa do this?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mMZ<wbr>AMJr_DSc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>based as fuck</br>  <br> male <br>GTFO</br></br>  <br>Future Nakahara Mai 2.0</br>  Convulted logic - the thread<br><br>Make room for best dork</br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe there's a replacement for Nakahara.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8R8<wbr>sSkDQSEM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E9E<wbr>dBLzPqBY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e6Q<wbr>RMqJreTE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Amamiya Sora was being supported from the very beginning. How did her first audition happen? Oh, Sawashiro brought her there. Her first agency? Music Ray'n, a subsidiary of Sony Japan. Her first lead roles rained on her in the same year, only 2 years after her debut. Even Sugita doesn't have that kind of jumpstart and he's the best seiyuu in the entire industry. Hell even Kaji Yuki had to wait 4 years until he got a lead role.<br><br>Meanwhile HanaKana began acting when she was around 4- 5 years old. She basically went Toroko route to stardom. Auditioned and got every role she can get no matter how minor they were while also graduating from uni. Her agency? Office Osawa. A studio with no influence. Her first lead roles weren't exactly loveable either. Nadeko is a basebreaker, Mikan is Mikan and Suou is from that second season almost everyone wished to forget it exists.</br></br></br>  Was listening to old programs of プチミレディオ yesterday.<br>One of the listeners asked them about their main inspirations as a seiyuu, or something along those lines.<br>Being an Aoifag I knew about Aoi's relationship with Sawashiro from long ago, but I had no idea Taketatsu respected Hocchan so much.<br>Hearing her talk about it was a bit moving to be honest.</br></br></br>  I just want it on the record that you, OP, are shit.  <br> Her agency? Office Osawa. A studio with no influence. <br>Nah, Osawa has quite a few popular seiyuu as well. Before HanaKana their primary cashcow was Mamiko Noto.</br></br>  <br> No liking Sugita <br>JUST</br></br>  <br>Is Sugita the Brendan Fraser of seiyuu?</br>  <br>She's so skinny, she's probably one of the few seiyuu who look better with clothes ON than off.<br><br>Seiyuu-wise, she's okay when she's not playing Chu2 all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Well many anons seems to hate sora a lot more lately. I just wish to rape the both of them.</br>  I love Kayanon.    I love Saorin  <br>It has no influence. If Sony is Barcelona then these guys are FC Porto.</br>  <br> implying Sora, Mikan, Kuu-chan, and Kobato aren't likable <br> implying Renai Circulation did not put HanaKana on the seiyuu map </br></br>  This isn't anime  <br>You're not anime</br>  Hayami Saori is the current 'it' girl on seiyuu business right now.  <br>Seiyuu is everything anime.</br>  <br><br>She's really damned good</br></br>  <br>You don't know that</br>  <br><br>Matsuoka pls</br></br>  <br>Perfect voice, acting, and singing. Should've dominated every season since a few years ago.<br>Too bad she rose to prominence right around Hanazawa's reign of terror.</br></br>  <br> now </br>  <br>How can you be anime if you're real?</br>  <br>Sketchbook is kinda obscure, Mikan is from To-Love-Ru, Kuu-chan and Kobato serve to a certain niche but they're not leads anyway. Renai Circulation helped her because she was so good at it. Her role didn't come with that guarantee. Even now people either hate Nadeko or love her. Do the calculation which one would net in more fans/popularity in a normal distribution? She was just that good to overcome that.<br><br>She had to be good to get where she is while Amamiya Sora got "blessed"-means "Sony called the studio" in Japanese- with certain hit roles. Akame, Elizabeth, Asshime. These are not usually roles you see a 2nd year seiyuu performing. One might be, but all three at the same year? It's not that Amamiya Sora is talentless-she's good- but she get's places she had no chance of getting without Sony pulling strings.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had gone to Otakon last year when she was a guest. Apparently, some random confag had the gall to ask if she was a fujoshi.</br>  <br>I like Sony Music's previous gorioshi, Tomatsu more than Amamiya.<br>She's actually a great seiyuu.</br></br>  <br> okay <br>I think she's great seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget, she has Im@s Million Live in her pocket too. With the way Bamco is pushing ML and Cinderella Girls, it's guaranteed money for her, and inevitably another anime for ML will come.</br>  <br>During Otakon Hayamin also said she is friends with a seiyuu who is a fujoshi.<br>Gee, I wonder who that is.</br></br>  <br>She and her compatriots Asakura and Natsukawa already hijacked the imas movie.<br>Their character got featured prominently and the actual main trio of million live didn't appear at all.</br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that Sora Amamiya lead roles since 2014-2015 are 14 roles (sequel counted as one) with 10 main girl roles, two 2nd girls, and 2 important girls, also she will be in two new Sony/Aniplex movie too as one of main characters in both movie. Which seiyuu do you think ever jump that much and fast before?<br><br><br>All Trysail are in ML too, A-1 is working in all of the im@s so far so Sony is definitely part of production comittee</br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.liheliso.org/2014/09/01/<wbr>otakon-2014-hayami-saori-qa-panel/<br><br>Some lovelivefags ruin it though with love live question</br></br></wbr>  <br>If they were just idolshit wota, they could've at least asked her about Cinderella Girls. How do you ask someone a question about a franchise unrelated to them in any way?</br>  <br>Her talk with Ozawa Ari in Nozaki-kun radio is really fun. That radio also make me become an Ozawa fans.</br>  <br> Sketchbook is kinda obscure <br>That was a lead role no matter how obscure it is and Sora was likable.<br><br> Mikan is from To-Love-Ru <br>What does that even imply? Mikan is one of the most popular girls in TLR. She's in the top polls of favorite characters in the manga. She is one of the girls who get consistent merchandise.<br><br> Kuu-chan and Kobato serve to a certain niche but they're not leads anyway <br>Kuu-chan is still likable and Kobato not a lead in the anime called "Kobato," what?<br><br> Renai Circulation helped her because she was so good at it. <br>No, just no. Have you heard her character songs? They're not actually good. Renai Circulation is actually a good song and it helped boost her career.<br><br> Even now people either hate Nadeko or love her. <br>Having haters doesn't matter. Nadeko is still one of the most popular girls in Monogatari and she still consistently gets merchandise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She worked several times in Sunrise anime</br>  <br> LLtards in charge of not being obnoxious <br>Props to Hayamin to give the best answer possible, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, Not only her voice, her look also a bit similar with Nakahara Mai</br></br>  <br>Wrong quotes </br>  <br>Here is one.</br>  <br> lead roles <br>major roles</br></br>  <br><br> AniRevo <br><br>If it wasn't on the opposite side of the country.

Her personality is fun too.</br>  <br>She is really underated and /a/ don't know her</br>  <br>I really like her voice and she also looks really cute.<br>Kinda like Kayanon's younger sister.<br>Also I was curious of what how bad her remarks were that forced the radio producers to censor her quite a much.</br></br></br>  <br> censor her quite a much <br>Do you have any links for such radio shows?</br></br>    <br>Can't find it. Even the official twitter account of the show also doesn't have any link on it.<br>Maybe someone uploaded it on Nico/Bilibili, haven't really bothered to check there.</br></br>  <br>Do you at least know the name of the radio show?</br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm267<wbr>07903</wbr></br>  <br>https://twitter.com/ozanari1134</br>  <br> Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days. <br> these days <br>They were always cancer, spamming their "3D LOLI" in every thread. The Prison Schoolfags of VA threads.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't what radio he mean. But if you like Ari, you should watch Ozanari, it was her radio show with Naganawa Maria. Both of them so cute together. <br>You can find it on youtube. it almost have all episode. I can't wait for new episode tonight.</br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Seems like he meant Ozanari also.</br>  <br> Naganawa Maria <br>Why is her face looking fat there?</br></br>  Your thoughts on Takeuchi? P-kun really isn't enough to see if he has range to go with his timbre.  <br>Look fine to me, but maybe she's starting eating properly. She's not eating properly until Ari suggest her to.</br>  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh<wbr>WF9o4VLUSvP4UUtU2Owug<br>this channel has pretty good seiyuu radio collection, including Ozawa Ari's.</br></wbr>  Best young male seiyuu here  <br>Anyone who watched YuYuYu should know her.

Ayaneru is my seiyuufu.  <br>Because that gif is really small and therefore very misleading.</br>  <br>Listened to every episode of Haikyuu radio for him.</br>  I was listening to Gundam Seed Destiny's radio (which was aired in 2005 IIRC), hosted by based Suzumura Kenichi, and whenever Maaya Sakamoto was guest they would flirt shamelessly. It's hnngh-inducing to the listener and unsurprising in retrospect that they married.    <br>Late but here. Is she okay lately?</br>  Did Sugita banged her?  Every seiyuu whose name contains Rie is good  <br>I like him since Madan Radio with him and Iguchi Yuuka. That radio is awesome. I always laughing listening to it.<br>And it's a plus for me knowing that he's one of Matsuoka's best friend. And he also so friendly with other young male seiyuu like Ohsaka Ryouta and Natsuki</br></br>  <br>How the fuck Amamiya Sora instantly get all that main roles. is she pillow seiyuu?</br>  <br>Not him but I think she's doing fine.

I don't really know about her singing career but I have a feeling she's not favored anymore.<br> On another note, I just started to play Custom Maid 3D and the tsundere voice sounds a lot like her. </br></br></br>  <br><br> Amamiya Sora <br> Voices Asshime and Shiho (which somehow ruined A/Z and the IM@S movie) <br><br>She'll always be the worst until the end of time</br></br></br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zNd<wbr>pUShO4K4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Sawashiro's otouto seems like a pretty fun guy.</br></br>  <br>Shiho is a good girl.</br>  <br>Sugita is pure.</br>    <br>Hirano probably fucked Sugita in the ass with a strap-on.</br>  <br>He seems like the kind of guy who might be into that anyway.

I realize it can vary a lot, but I'm just looking for a rough estimate. I'm complete trash at estimating weight and don't have a scale. Would be helpful in trying to estimate shipping costs.  <br>1. Dunno.<br>2. For supporting the author, the japanese is obviously better. I don't have that many japanese tanks to compare with.<br>3. I don't get in the mood for reading manga when staring at a computer/tablet display.<br>4. Yeah. While he might not get paid directly from each sale of a license-tank, he's going to have money to his name in the publishing house. Contracts vary and nobody knows the entire truth.</br></br></br></br>  <br> localized <br>Disgusting.</br></br>   [HorribleSubs] Gakkou Gurashi! - 04 [720p] <br>It's time.</br>  Is the ED an older song or are we going to have to wait for its release?  <br>She has by far the most fanart.</br>  is this the new season of highschool of the dead?  <br>Pixiv.</br>  <br>Field trip to Mexico?</br></blockquote>]
