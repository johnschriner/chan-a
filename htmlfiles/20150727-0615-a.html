You first fag.  Would be good if Daiz actually started subbing it again.  <br>Okay. I liked it, not bad story so far. Very thoughtful characters. It seems edgy at times with all the twilights around but other than that, 7/10 from me.</br>  <br>Okay, now me. Haven't watched it.</br>  <br>Just go with Funi</br>  Animation and choreography could've been better , at one point he pulls off some completely unnecessary but also very retarded looking moves (think it was in the first episode, he just does a sort of low height jump and mid-air roll and lands exactly where he was before just to slash the guy)<br><br>Also muh superhuman test subjects is pretty silly, but otherwise the story hasn't been unbearable and if anything it's worth watching for the novelty alone.(Whore main characters, etc.)<br><br>As this guy put it <br>7/10 is a fitting score.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Definition of 7/10. <br>The characters are interesting enough, there's an intriguing backstory that hasn't fully developed, the action is fine and it's short enough to stay entertaining.</br></br></br>  It's in the ''so bad it's good" category.  It needs an anime original ending.  Average. <br><br>The relatively novel setting is nice, but it's lacklustre.</br></br>  It's pretty  gangsta   Its starting to get good<br>Last episode was the best one</br>  <br>Hell no. Anime original ending is only a great way to ruin the series completely.<br><br>As for the anime, it's pretty okay, there are some silly moments, but I'm enjoying it so far.</br></br></br>  I'm really liking it.<br>I think it's very interesting that one of the main characters is deaf.<br>Communicating by sign language and barely being able to talk, while talking to himself normally was a very good touch.<br>Nico is a pretty likable character, in my opinion.</br></br></br>  Ep.4 and still haven't dropped.<br><br>That means I like it better than 90% of the shit I start.<br><br>Alex-chan a cute, hope nothing bad happens to her</br></br></br></br>  <br>5/10, terrible choreography and "emotional" animation. If you cant animate feeling, you have failed as an animator. Mind you some parts are good, some.</br>  <br>fujoshit</br>  <br>Its a bit slow but entertaining. hopefully something articulated will actually happen before last episode</br>  <br>Yeah they invested everything in characters and not much in a plot.</br>  Characters seem good enough, but it kinda lacks that hook that makes you want to keep watching  <br><br>Since when does being deaf mean you have fucked up control over your eyelids?</br></br>  <br>Opening is good<br>Show isnt</br></br>  <br>But Funi so incredibly bad.</br>  I'm not sure about the whole super soldier business, but I like the main characters a lot, especially Nico. Time will tell if my interest in the characters carries me through to the end. <br>Predicting a 6 or 7/10, entertaining but nothing to rave about to recommend to a friend.</br>  <br>A deaf fighter surely would have been ambushed and killed by now. Other than it it's boring if you wanna watch a real gangster anime watch GunGrave or Black Lagoon.</br>  I really liked the first 2 eps for the action, atmosphere, and music. <br><br>I didn't like the last 2 eps very much since they took it in an entirely different direction. There was an unnecessarily large amount of time spent on backstory, especially in a 12 episode anime. The girl turns from a whore who shot her pimp into a bland character who asks questions about everything to get the audience up to speed. <br><br>Also I don't like the introduction of more super soldiers doing super acrobatics. I could suspend my disbelief with Nicolas's acrobatic swordplay, but I can't keep it up anymore when there's a kid with machetes jumping over rooftops avoiding every bullet the mafia boss's closest men shoots. Not to mention the gang leader is a sharpshooter who can't land a hit on a kid running around in an enclosed alleyway.<br><br>Another point is that so far we've only seen a single setting: a generic alleyway. There's hints to a larger bustling city, but we never see it. Instead we see the same alleyway with a corner or two to mix it up.<br><br>Started out as a 9/10, but now it's a 7/10. I hope it gets better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like it so far. Not awesome but it's solid entertaining.<br>The op is pretty nice, i like the chardesigns and so far no char is as dumb as a potato. Thats nice for a change i guess.<br><br>The Story reminds me of Dark Angel, and i don't know how to feel about that.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Pretty lackluster adaptation. Sure, is more or less faithful to the manga, but the animation is cheap and boring. Fighting scenes are yawn inducing and just lack that exciting spark. I guess is 5/10. Not dropping because of Nina and Nick.</br>  The show is the definition of a 5/10. It lacks any discernible identity of its own in anything it does, even down to its terrible choreography. Let's see if it's flying, or floating at the end, though.  atleast its not highschool/10<br><br>while it started pretty nice and certainly is good and nothing major. 6/10 nice watch, nice style but still waiting for that big stuff to happen.<br>too bad the hentai of it is shit aswell. instead of brown hotness or cute nursegirl we get Worick fucking nico all day. fucking fujoshits ruin it</br></br></br>  <br> its shit because the males have more screentime </br>  Honestly didn't like the anime adaptation at first, but it made me re-read the manga and eventually catch up with the anime. Still neither here or there with the anime, but love the manga, so I have hope. 7/10 so far. <br> No clue what they're going to cover in 12 episodes though, a lot goes on... Sad they've cut out some of the smaller, cuter moments </br>  <br>i was talking about the fanart, especially the hentai you dibshit. Have you checked pixiev on it? <br>http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_m<wbr>ode=s_tag&amp;word=gangsta<br><br>Go to R-18 and feast your eyes on dispear. <br><br>I like the 2 male leads and they certainly carry the show, its good they get the most screentime. the show is mostly about fighting and the girls dont fight there its obvios the anime isnt focusing on them.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Everything's cool, but I'm not liking the 'THESE GUYS ARE SUPERMEN' shit  <br> Guy jumps around crushing roof tile in the OP <br> He kicks a police car so hard it nearly tips over <br> Oh shit this guy is [special man from special group] <br><br>What else were you expecting?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was expecting no superpower shit.<br>Though roof tiles are pretty fragile and that's a bad example.</br></br>  <br> Complaining about anime for the lack of fanart fap material <br> Complaining about lack of fanart <br> Fanart <br><br>Just pick up a pencil and draw so you can get your load off, you fucking faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  I love it, I think the dog tags aspect is pretty interesting I'm just waiting for some shitty Alex drama I can see it happening already.  I need that full OP.  was ok until they introduce super human and stuff.  <br> not being able to feel their killing intent <br>git gud scrub</br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>14661</wbr> </br>  <br>Its entertaining, the OST is good, and its a nice change of pace from all the other super typical shit I'm watching this season, so its all good in my book. Nothing amazing and I don't think it will be by the time its over, but fun enough</br>  <br> Jesus fuck it's already out? Thanks anon. </br>  It's one of the shows I dropped this season. The story itself is competent, but the super powered Dog Tags seemed to be conflicting the rest of the show that is relatively grounded in reality.  <br>I haven't seen anything like it for a while so it's nice and fresh. It has flaws but like it.</br>  <br>There's nothing fujoshit about it at all. That's like saying that Ushio to Tora is fujoshit.</br>  I've been enjoying it so far. White haired makes me think of male balalaika and nicolas is male revy basically.  <br>So that makes the whore female Rock?</br>  <br>I think you might be onto something there. But the whole superhuman side kinda killed it for me.</br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437596633673.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437596633673<wbr>.webm</wbr></a><br><br>Doug is a pretty cool guy</br></br>  Eternal wait for Underwater  <br>They only did it because HS didnt pick it up.<br>They have no reason to do it now</br></br>  <br>Ah I see.<br><br>Originally planned to just watch this Raw but when underwater picked it up I abandoned the idea. Guess it's time to catch up using raws.</br></br></br>  I love when Nicolas speaks, sounds badass.   anime <br><br> not set in Japan <br><br> cast isn't all teenagers <br><br>/a/ I'm scared please hold me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let's just all agree the opening is amazing.  <br> not set in Japan <br> cast isn't all teenagers <br><br>Why do you think /a/ dislikes this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's a mature adult anime for mature adults such as myself</br>  <br> Fight scene with 0 animation <br> Stills everywhere <br> Horrible music drowning out the talking <br> Literally showing off their powerlevels to eachother <br><br>this is what you consider good?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True.<br><br>We need more teenage anime for teenagers such ourselves</br></br></br>  <br>Next episode</br>  <br>Very weak direction in general. Poor fight scene choreography. Poor animation. Gangsta really makes Black Lagoon look like god's gift to japanimation.</br>  <br>Yeah all those generic SoLs you watch are directed and animated like Gits and Akira right</br>  <br>ah I remember this fuck<br>  comes out of fucking nowhere kills a bunch of allies <br>  no real legit reason <br>  a rank battle <br>  other group comes out of nowhere and pick him back up <br>  entire fucking indecent is forgiven randomly <br>  becomes an friend for no reason <br>  gets slaughtered by some human <br>  entire fucking chapter about a bro relationship we never heard of and a shitload of crap attempting to portray him as human <br><br>why is the author so shit at writing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything is fujo if you are a faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah around this time my interested in the manga started slipping.</br>  <br> We need more teenage anime for teenagers such ourselves <br>You meant, we need more girly anime for little girls such us ourselves.</br></br>  It's ok, but not great. I can see normalfags spewing how great it is in a few years  <br>You sound upset. But yes, shows like NNB and Gakkou Gurashi are far better directed than Gangsta.</br>  <br>The last two chinese cartoons i watched were giant robo and otaku no video. I don't think "gangsta is very badly animated but so is a whole lot of bad anime" is a very strong argument in its favor. <br><br>Is there some stand out element of gangsta that redeems its many obvious flaws for you?</br></br></br>  <br> japanimation </br>  The only reason I'm watching this show is for tasty brownie girl.<br><br>She's the best looking girl of the year. Them JP folks need to appreciate brown girls more. <br><br>Nicholas or Worick need to fuck her already so that she can give birth to mixed breeds.<br><br>Manga readers, please tell me either of the two guys gets to fuck her brains out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She already got used in every orifice already, by more guys you can count on all limbs.</br>  <br>Worick kind of develops a romance thing with her but no fucking at all.</br>  <br>With Worick? I thought she would end up falling in love with Nicholas. But eh, whatever. As long as that brown ass is getting tapped.<br><br>The world needs more brown skinned, blue/green-eyed women.</br></br></br>  <br>Nicolas is too hung up on his past girlfriend(?) Veronica and it's implied he had something to do with her by accident. She's the woman figure Nicolas sees in the flashbacks, and probably the lady who touches Nicolas' face before the door shuts. <br><br>Her arm was also chopped off, so maybe that happened by accident when Nicolas overdoses on uppers?</br></br></br>  <br>I kind of wish the subtitles for him were more disjointed like the translation of the manga (like when Nic tries to tell Workick that he's deaf) but I can understand why they'd want to make it more readable.<br><br>I think the adaptation is alright so far but the animation is very subpar.</br></br></br>  Average 6/10, it seemed to have potential and is enjoyable at times but mostly comes of disappointing as the character interacting feels forced and the tempo is lackluster.

Been out of the loop. Anyone mind explaining where this tidal wave of MMORPG-themed anime came from?<br><br>I recall .hack from way back so the concept isn't new, what made it so popular now?</br></br>  <br>Digimon</br>  <br>MMORPG theme is so old and busted.<br>Resurrection theme is the new freshness.</br></br>  <br>Well, he plans the eradication of a sentient species just to make slightly stronger skellies.</br>  <br>This right here. MMO anime has old source material, soon they've gotta animate something new, and it's all about resurrection nowadays.</br>  <br>Monster Farm</br>  <br>I would most likely say, yes.<br>Because from the previews of Episode 4, it will finish with Volume 1 and dragging Volume 2 over 9 Episodes, would be too long.<br>I would say Episode 5 - 8 will be covering Volume two's 4 Chapters, and Episode 9 - 13 will cover Volume three's 5 Chapters.<br>Everything would be fitting perfectly and ending with a Epic Fight and Ending.</br></br></br></br>  post OC  <br>Nice,here's hoping for a second season.</br>  <br>He's a wizard.</br>  <br><br>Yes we do. Anyone who says otherwise is obvious lower lifeforms (slugs) and should be killed.</br></br>  <br>Because MMOs are dead and we watch the series that use them as a theme trying to relive our best times in games like EQ and WoW</br>  <br>Read the stats.<br><br>Alignment: Extreme Evil<br>Sense of Justice: -500<br><br>Ep 2 the only reason he helped was to see how his powers did against the new world and cause he felt he had a debt to repay to Touch Me. And he wanted info. In other words, he didnt help cause he cares about those humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good God, Ainz. That's just overkill.</br>  So I read Book 1 to 4 and the spoiler for the rest to 9, and I am concerned: MC and his army are way overpowered. I have yet to find anyone who managed to be a threat to them.<br><br>Sure, it's fun to follow a badass' journey, especially when he doesn't act exactly like a Gary Stu, but some credible danger would be nice too.<br><br>Hell, form what spoiler I read, book 9 (and probably book 10) will be about raising his reputation to an even higher level.</br></br></br></br>  PVs again in case you missed them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2kv<wbr>DO3xJFEY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU5<wbr>xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Tuesday when? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, I'm guessing the guy's sane and not overly evil but since he actually has become a lich not only has his emotions being suppressed but he's even matching game stats.<br><br>Though personally if I was extremely evil I wouldn't of left the 2 girls with a protective bubble and drag them along the ground kicking and screaming before dissecting them infront of the village, he could of atomized the village in an instant and saved the chief to force info out of him.<br><br>I know he's smart but that level of evil and to actually help out so much over a PERSONAL debt which he could easily ignore...I got a feeling he isn't sticking strictly to those stats, but I haven't read the manga and not sure if he starts matching stat for stat yet</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a  guild  and potential  WC items .</br>  <br>Would be nice to see him unlease the beast   Rubedo [/spoiler[ </br>  <br>Nigga, he's not the type of evil that goes around starting shit (except with the Lizardmen) or flaunting his power unprovoked. I personally believe he's one of the scary type of evil, the smart kind. He's pragmatic as fuck but not above letting any emotion he can feel sway him to the other side. He isn't as evil as he would have been if he'd been, say, born a lich with his stats but he's growing into his alignment pretty nicely.</br>  <br>So without knowing how strong kingdoms are in this world, you would have comitted pointless slaughter with no real benefit. <br>. There's evil, and there's stupidity. Nigga, you dumb</br></br>  <br>After Monday.</br>  <br>I'm playing FFXIV and it's more like the MMO's depicted in these recent anime than anything else.</br>  <br>Is it supposed to be loyal? It looks like it'd bite the hand feeding it.</br>  <br>Indeed, the alignment system in D&amp;D doesn't cover everything for a reason, when Stupid Evil, Stupid Good, Lawful Stupid, Stupid Neutral and Chaotic Stupid most certainly exist.</br>  <br>I thought that's what Int and Wis are for? It's not surprising quite a few people on this board have like -5 on their modifiers.</br>  <br>I suppose stupid being relegated to an INT score makes sense, but even players with proper INT scores still play Stupid all the time. Especially Chaotic Stupid.</br>  <br>I doubt anything in new world could be a threat to Nazarick.<br>Heck an army consist of 1500 demi-god levels 100 and they still coudn't past 8th floor.</br></br>  <br>It was perfectly possible to get through Nazarick with a dedicated team. They just gave up at lvl 8 because of the gotcha and didnt bother to try again.</br>  <br>Weren't most of those NPC mercenaries?<br>Plus all the 41 members were there.</br></br>  <br>Ainz is scared of other players who may or may not show up and we have those Dragon Lords and unknown world items around. Tension is generated because we don't know yet. Overlord has a ways to go and I'm sure there will be dangers that sort of threaten Nazarick...maybe, possibly. But just reading how they crush the lowly humans and enslave the other races is fun in its own way.</br>   Anime too dragged out <br> No spooky orchestra music playing on background when SPOOKY SKELETON on stage <br>Why the fuck is anyone even watching this</br></br>  <br>In the novels, he does experiments on humans. Not sure if they will show that in the anime. But human experimentations are definitely EVIL.</br>  <br>That's just playing out of character, or possibly in line with their background text and such. You can't measure everything with numbers even in DnD after all.</br>  <br>Which NPC ?<br>They can't even touch 1 member since they failed at 8th floors</br></br>  <br>Because It's entertaining and I'm autistic enough to enjoy infodumps?</br>  <br>A lot of those were NPCs and they got trolled by Victim who inflicted all the status effects in the game then Ainz nuked them with a World item.</br>  <br>I remember reading that the 1500 strong army was composed mostly of NPC mercenaries.</br>  <br>From a human perspective. From a Nazarick / Undead Overlord perspective? Not really. He's not even biologically capable of feeling it. <br><br>It'd be like asking a guy who had his nuts and pecker chopped off to stay virile for the rest of his life and he gets to live for the next 300 years after becoming a eunuch.<br><br>It's not like he doesn't realize it's bad by human standards, he just can't afford to care at this point when he's prioritizing safety and his body helps a fuck ton.<br><br>Whereas in a human body he'd be sweating bullets and guilt tripping himself so hard he'd never let it go through.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Rubedo ?<br>I thought she's the reason for their failure.</br></br>  Gamma the best.  <br> and the spoiler for the rest to 9, <br>Where?</br></br>  <br> experiments <br> On humans <br><br>I eagerly await this, I know his emotions have been suppressed and this just suits that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You just like lizard sex</br>  “Climb. Even if you desire power, don’t give up your humanity.”<br><br>“Give up on my humanity…? Are you speaking of the likes of demons that appear in stories?”<br><br>“That and others like turning into an undead or magic life forms.”<br><br>“A normal human cannot do something like that.”<br><br>“That’s true… but turning into an undead will often twist your heart as well. Desiring perfection, becoming an undead to achieve one’s ideal… the heart will be tempted by the changing flesh and the resulting transformation will be terrifying.”<br>Nooo Ainz stay good!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm also an animefag. <br><br>He monologues pretty heavily about how his current form is desensitizing him to just about anything that would make him flinch as a human being. <br>Pretty hard to miss the potential for his committing atrocities as he becomes increasingly more absorbed into this form/role of his.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Why would you think that? Nothing about her was mentioned during the description of the raid.</br>  <br>The formula is that the MC is overpowered but he plans meticulously and fully expects more resistance but he ends up winning much easier than he expects. It's been repeated since vol 1. Even in vol 7 when Demiurge reveals to Ainz that everyone was planning on world domination he just freaks out for a second then just goes with it. There's a part in vol 4. where he's talking with the Guardians and they are like 'well why don't we just do things more obviously instead of skulking around because then we can reveal the enemies faster' and he shits his robe.<br><br>They can't possibly bring out all the details from the LN or WN. There are far too many one sentence things like Ainz's despair aura or the spooky faces coming from the staff of ainz ool gown that never get mentioned again.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but Rubedo probably had a part in it, though how much is another question altogether.<br><br>Every single guardian even PA was not allowed on the 8th floor. It takes someone of Victim level to stay on that floor, so Rubedo had to be something special like  oh I don't know made from the Caloric Stone making her a world class npc and living up to her name? </br></br></br>  <br>see<br><br>Rubedo isn't mentioned to have done anything yet. I'm not even sure Ainz visited the 8th floor yet at all, since he told everyone to stay out of there. Apparently the strongest are on that floor, even though they aren't lvl100. This doesn't include Victim who came out during vol 4 to float around for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere she's guards the 8th floor with Victim and Gargantua. Heck a guy said that she even stronger than Touch Me.</br>  Since Lupusregina is the faith-based caster of the Pleiades, I wonder if her name is a reference to the Bitch Queen, an evil god in the Forgotten Realms D&amp;D setting.  <br>Rubedo being the Miko would mean she is level 100. Unless Miko is another NPC by process of elimination it would make her Rubedo, because Lastborn cannot be the same level as Sebas as written earlier.</br>  <br>I wonder what world class items albedo has. I recently read vol 1 of the LN and apparently she has two but they haven't mentioned them. Isn't she World class npc then?</br>    <br>Gargantua guards the 4th floor.<br> Rubedo is rumored to be the cherry blossoms Guardian in the 8th floor, Victim is the 8th floor Guardian.<br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's on the 8the floor. And the narration did say something vague like "the raid was halted on the 8th floor" and not "Victim stopped the raid on the 8th floor." So I guess it's possible she did something if anyone made it to her lair after Victim went off.</br>  <br>No, it's fundamentally a bit different. Ainz for example has a WC item. However Touch Me is a world class champion even if he doesn't hold a WC item.<br><br>Get the difference? While a WC item certainly puts you on the same level, if not higher depending on the item, your fundamental base isn't changed.</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody is stronger than Touch Me. <br>Maybe Ulbert? Possibly.</br></br>    <br>By tidal wave you mean a splash n the kiddie pool? You can't name more than 5 anime franchises in the last 10 years that have MMORPG in any significant value.</br>  <br>Ulbert might have strongest magic caster class.<br>But he's not world class chamion.</br></br>   Pdf/epub link please. On mobile atm, can't do shit. ;_;   <br><br>can anyone add in ni shibullath in onto the background?</br></br>  <br>Lupus just means wolf son, theres a lot of wolf queens in fiction.<br><br>I figured.<br><br>see <br>was what I read in the novels<br>Rubedo has done nothing, we just barely know it exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br>  <br>Ulbert was the magic equivalent of the world champion. This is because the world champion is pure physical and it'd be unfair to casters.<br><br>Ulbert however was always depicted as playing 2nd fiddle, and Touch Me being the gary stu with his ballin' wife and children being a level 100 raijuu.</br></br></br>  <br>It might just be a repeat of the ainz vs shalltear fight with Shalltear winning because Touch Me isn't an npc. <br><br>The goblin with the wc stick would kill him though and all of the tomb.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>What's this shit I hear about Touch Me and Ulbert getting into it in real life and why it's most likely the reason they quit the guild?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Many of the 'transported to another world' and "mmorpg is real" have been around for a long time and many are popular. SAO is the latest biggest one for anime, the LN is high ranked as well. Mushoku Tensei is another resurrection type that is the top LN now. But you can go as far back as Zero no Tsukihime or whatever. Overlord is pretty old as is, it took a long time to come from WN-&gt;LN-&gt;anime.</br>    If our youngest was here… if we moved as Pleiades then we wouldn’t have a problem…  <br>So according to Solution, the youngest sister of Pleiades might be in 8th floor too ?<br>Damn, there are just so many secrets about the it.</br></br>  <br>We don't know what Rubedo does. All we know is that currently in the new world Rubedo is the strongest being in Nazarick, cause ya know the other 40 players aren't here and Ainz has one damn gimp shit build that would be low-mid tier max without his decked out items.<br><br>I mean it's a game where the average player at level 100 had 1 divine item max. Max. Most none at all. <br><br>If put into WoW terms, it'd be like vanilla level 60 in blues with one purple from a dungeon versus full t3 with legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe Rubedo's the youngest.</br>  <br>Why I can't touch all of those Albedos.</br>  <br>Ainz didn't actually use any of his skills to win that, just spamming items. You could say that its just a matter of whoever abuses more World Class items at this point and which effect wins harder.<br>Don't forget all the Divine/Mythic class items that fuck people over too. Gazef without his stamina gloves is pretty shit.</br></br>  <br>Maruyama does keep a lot of potential asspullery handy. Half-done character sheets, mysterious super NPCs in reserve. No ability descriptions for Nazarick's world class items.</br>  <br>She's taking about Lastborn.</br>  <br>Don't forget about Albedo's younger sister.</br>  <br>maybe the miko<br>or rubedo is the miko<br>or Albedo's sister is the miko<br>or albedo's sister is rubedo and she's just hiding in the frozen prison for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br>  Since Gate is going to get localized, I can only hope Overlord does too later down the line.  <br>This is the kind of story I like. I like my OP MC story with a little substance but not too much that it would overpower my hankering for a good beatdown.</br>  <br>If they're lovecraftian horrors they should be enemies to good and evil alike. Not that "summon them and bail" isn't a suitable strategy for an evil person.<br><br><br>A space marine chapter would probably be on even footing with everything but floor guardians and Ainz himself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, so you'd have to wonder what makes her special enough to reside on the 8th floor when she's not even level 100.</br>  <br><br>Oh right, forgot about her. Damn, the 8th floor's pretty balling.<br>Victim<br>Rubedo<br>Lastborn<br>What else?<br><br>Which floor sucks, geographywise? My vote goes to Chair's graveyard. Compared to the others, it's a bit not impressive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't even list out the classes. Since max level is 15 for any class it would have to take up a huge amount of space but of course that allowed him to give Ainz the Eclipse class. <br>I think its a good choice though, because most of the tension in the story is based around how things are going to play out or what new secret move is going to get shown next and we already get enough infodumps as it is.</br></br>  <br>There no information about her so we can't be sure she's a low level NPC like here sisters.</br>  <br><br>The Tundra must be fucking awful if you don't have frost resistance.</br></br>  <br>We can because in the early volumes like vol 1 or 2 it's said other than Sebas the rest of the maids were below a certain level. The second point is the poster of the level 100 npcs, of which there are 9 including the miko.</br>  <br>Not to mention you have to jump into a lake to get to it</br>  <br>I was bored.</br>  <br>Ok, then she must have some special shit like Victim to stay in the 8th floor.<br>Damn, the more we talk the less chance I see PDL could be a threat to Nazarick.</br></br>  <br>This works quite well</br>  <br> fighting cocytus <br>oh god all of them swords<br>I bet his cleave must have been a bitch<br> fighting demiurge in the molten realm <br>I can only imagine him mind controlling people into lava pits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're forgetting that PDL's main skill is subterfuge and trickery and that Ainz is shit at that. Demiurge will probably have to step up his game in order to prevent PDL empowering Penguin to enslave pandora's actors and stealing all the world items and class changing Ainz to a toad or some shit.</br>  <br> Ourobouros is in the new world and is probably the most game breaking in terms of long term <br> World Savior can one shot all of Nazarick <br> Nameless Spellbook allows PDL to know all of Nazarick's spells <br> Potential players that hate AOG <br><br>PDL himself was never a big deal, it's how he goes Hitogami on Ainz's ass that's the set up. <br><br>Plus, the author stated Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 70% of her faces show nothing but anger. <br><br>Come on Narb, those humans aren't that bad, calm down.</br></br></br>   “And those glasses… didn’t they seem incredibly expensive?” <br><br> “Could it be a magic item?” <br><br> “No, isn’t it just a luxury item? Maybe a dwarf made it.” <br><br>Fucking dwarves, man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's something briefly touched on in vol 7. It didn't go into specifics though.</br>  <br>CD is a chump though. As cute as she is.</br>  <br>Except for the Nameless Spellbook, does PDL even has the others 2 ?</br>  He looks pretty fucking good.  <br> All these pests around me, I want to squash them all. </br>  <br>Who is Certain Death ?</br>  <br>I still don't know what fucking race he is</br>  <br>Orobourus has already been used, its not coming back.<br><br>World Savior should still be in the hands of the goblins because no one is out powering them.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolielf that we see hanging around with the Black Scripture guy, so she's Sloan Theocracies bitch. Apparently part of the Black Scripture but not the leader.</br>  <br> it turns out that one of the goblins under Erin has it and she decides to not use it against Ainz because he saved the village <br>That would be a nice tweest.<br> she doesn't know that Ainz could have revived her parents </br></br></br>  <br>Garuda maybe?</br>  <br>There's noting stating a WC item that was used up in the new world returns to Yggdrasil instead of coming back to the new world.<br><br>In fact, assuming Martial Arts was introduced through Orobourus then that's twice it's been used since translation konjac is clearly one use.<br><br>World Savior was already used by the goblin king so it shouldn't be with the goblins since it's a twenty, so even if it's in the new world it's somewhere random. It'd be super dumb luck for goblins to find it twice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The winged god of Ra</br>  <br>confirmed high crit rate</br>  <br>She's beautiful.</br>  <br>What is Ouroboros's power ?<br>Is it alter-reality or some shit like that &gt;</br></br>  <br>Yep. It's the broken shit where you call the admin team and ask them to do something. By far the most potential over the long term if we're talking about items we know about.<br><br>And we know from how Wish Upon a Star changed that Ouroboros would be even more godly in the new world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There was a post about who was stronger between rubedo and touch me like 2 threads ago. Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz.</br></br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me <br><br>Missed it, source on the author word of god link.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't ouroboros one use though? I think the LN mentioned it being used in order to help that guild steal Ainz's secret jew gold mine. I remember that Ainz has at least two one-shot World items, but I don't know what you're implying with Wish Upon A Star.</br>  <br>How did Wish Upon a Star get changed in the nw?</br>  <br> Author said rubedo was stronger than touch me like how shalltear is stronger to ainz. <br>As in, it's a direct comparison? Rubedo is stronger because her skills have good compatibility with Touch Me as an opponent?</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128551<wbr>803/#q128565734</wbr></br>  <br>There nothing stating that orobouros was used for those two things. Another option is that orobouros isn't even in the new world. <br><br>I'm just believing in the fact that the twenty really are just one use items, that does not respawn. So the guild that used it on the mines was the only time.</br></br></br>  <br>One use means it disappears and comes back in the world of Yggdrasil as far as the game goes.<br><br>However, since the item transferred to the new world, chances are after it's used it comes back to the new world. Not proven fact but the way the novels keep hinting at shit and Ainz's paranoia at WC items it'd be more of a buzz kill if it doesn't work this way.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but author just said she's stronger than Touch Me.<br>There's no comparison mention.</br></br>  <br>nah the twenty and one-use world items aren't the same thing<br><br> Answer: The amount of EXP needed from Wish upon a star is dependent on the type of wish granted. In Yggdrasil a player who cast Wish upon a star would be granted 3 random choices from a pool of choices; However, In the New world the spell is a lot more Omnipotent. But basically the larger and stronger the wish, the more EXP given to complete it <br>https://forums.animesuki.com/showth<wbr>read.php?p=5599818<br><br><br>I don't know where you got that idea about the one use items but I'll assume you're right</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Martial Arts is 50/50 but Translation Konjac is clearly hinted.<br><br>Every fucking species in the world right down to the very last descendent's ancestor somehow managed to eat a konjac? You telling me someone went Santa Claus and spread some language jelly during Christmas for a few years in a row and even went in the sea cause sea races can't be bothered to surface?<br><br>Yeah no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the game it gets one of three random wishes to choose from every use.<br>In the new world if you can think it, it will grant it (unless it's going up against a WC item)</br></br>  <br>so what you're saying is<br> Herohero was summoned to spread jelly to the mouth of every being on the planet. <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Ok<br>So Ouroboros can works on even a larger scale than that ? That's some OP shit.</br></br>  <br>Possibly, but I'm pretty sure he's still busy trying to free Veldora out from the prison. Maybe it was Simmering Teapot instead. She's an eroge voice actor surely making her the best candidate to go Ho Ho Ho.</br>  <br> twenty and one use items not.the same thing <br> These items called the ‘Twenty’ were so powerful that they could only be used once before disappearing. <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What was Teapot's race?</br>  <br>Slime.</br>  There are our twenties that can change the world. We're both arguing about something that may or may not have happened.  <br><br>No wonder he was away from Yggdrasil for so long then showed up overworked. He was making Christmas runs the whole time behind Momonga's back! He didn't quit the game he just logged onto the PTR fucking around.</br></br>  My lord please tell me all the Climb screentime gets toned down in the next chapter.<br>I can't fucking handle the guy. At least Zaryusu was a god damn reptile.</br>  <br>But won't you enjoy how he and Brain get mind fucked by how strong his dandy gentleman effortlessly makes them shit their pants harder than Gazef ever could?<br><br>Especially Brain, he's gotta be going crazy.<br><br> Get whooped by Gazef <br> Think effort is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Shalltear <br> Thinks race is the big difference <br> Gets whooped by Sebas <br> Just goes with the flow and thinks it's all about MUH MAMORU </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh of course I will but holy shit these last few chapters.<br><br>Also, I liked Brain far more than Climb.</br></br></br>    He thought it was Ainz Ooal Gown for an instance, but it lacked depth and the presence. <br>“Is that… a hug pillow of him… who made it?”<br>“I made it myself<br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Climb is basically the kid you are meant to hate or pity or root for, and then a few volumes down the line he  gets Gazef'd, probably by the lizards or Hamsuke. </br>  <br>yes really</br>  <br>Damn, wish I had a waifu like that.</br>  <br>No one can outGazef Gazef.  RIP in pieces hero ;_; </br>  <br>She'd be the perfect housewife if she wasn't a lunatic.</br>  <br>50% Anger at humans<br>40% Confusion at why Ainz is disappointed <br>10% Abject Apathy</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing to hate about him. He's just a loyal warrior who is above average that happens to be messing around with the best humanity has to offer. He's a foil for everyone that Ainz shits upon.</br>   dat lizardsex on vol.4 <br>I kinda want to see Ainz's facepalm got animated.</br>  <br>You forgot shit at following orders.<br> Call me Momon we need to do this ninja shit <br> okay momon-sama <br> Call me momon <br> okay momon-sa- n <br> fine thats good enough </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hamsuke <br><br>Let it happen. I feel like we're not getting enough of him. I know you're embarrassed to have him around Ainz but you already registered him anyway so bring him out for a walk or genocide or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Plenty of people on /a/ hate Climb, it's enough for me to be considerate to them and include the option. Personally I'm with you, but I can't say I like/dislike him. He's just kinda there.</br>  So we all agree then?<br>Retard moe is a thing.<br>Cause there's no other explanation for best meido-ing this retard.</br></br>  Anyone here read Kuro no Maou? How is it?  Am I the only one who thinks that PA's ability is OP as fuck?<br>I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable.</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for vol 8 translations to see if Hamsuke really is a girl. And I guess the rest of vol 6 to see if Ninya was a girl. Pretty sure the latter is but these threads have been filled with nerd ragers so it's hard to discuss anything related to trap/reverse trap cause it's apparently srs biz.</br>  <br>There's a reason he's best guardian, you know?</br>  <br>Well he is best girl. That's only natural.</br>  <br>Retard-moe has existed before paper existed. It just has so many names across all the languages you can't really tell anymore.</br>  <br>  Imagine he has 80% power of based Touch Me or Ulbert <br>Well damn.</br></br>  <br> I mean, capable to shapeshift into Supreme Beings with only 80% of their original power makes him very versatile and unpredictable. <br>He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. So 80% of their strength from skills/races, but not as strong as they would be when fully decked out.</br></br>  <br>Of course it's a thing.<br><br>Did you forget nearly an entire year of "CHAIKA ON THE FRONT PAGE?" posting.</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay. God damn though. All these fucking words about nothing. Yandere fairy is cool though.</br>  <br><br><br>/a/ in charge of having  good taste. </br></br></br>  <br> he shows up <br> albedo kills him <br> Ainz goes "what the fuck' <br> They both realize its pandora actor <br> Ainz rezzes him and give albedo a look with a face that doesn't exist but she can sense his disappointment anyways. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah. that's them having low wisdom scores that would normally tell them this is totally a bad idea.<br>It's like that tale with the various sages/scientists all trying to one up another in showing off the majesty of a dead tiger they found.<br>The first one writes a Haiku<br>The next does a drawing<br>The next does an incredibly lifelike painting<br>The next makes a model<br>The next one uses taxdermy to show off it's majesty<br>Then they all get together and decided to bring it to life as a true way to show off their skills<br>The random commoner hears this and decides to GTFO as they discuss how to do so.<br>The tiger comes to life and eats everyone but the commoner.<br>High int Low wis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He wouldn't be able to switch equipment during battle, however. <br> Cash items </br></br>  <br>No, I've seen people play dnd with both high int and wis and still make retard decisions. Cause you can't stop the player behind the character from being dumb.</br>  <br>Racial skill is enough.<br><br>Do you think in future releases, Ainz will allow PA to copy his Eclipse job and going "the goal of all life is death" together?</br></br></br>  <br>Did you really think that no one else knew about that or what?</br>  <br>That's because the player behind the character isn't actually being affected by their character's "high wisdom".</br>  <br>Oh i know. I guess i just felt like pointing out that there can be multiple sources of this.<br> I have a fellow player that I thought was absolutely brilliantly playing a low int character(couldn't be low wis since he liked to mention his high wis) due to the absolutely horrible decision making skills he displayed for months. (Not even on a low scale. Many of the BBEGs are a direct result of his bright ideas.) Then I put my foot in my mouth by mentioning his character had low int and discovered he actually had a positive int modifier.</br></br>  <br>why the fuck everyone keep calling her retard? she just simply hate human and refuse to acknowledge them. That isnt retard, its simply racist</br>  <br>Albedo should ask PA to transform to Ainz and do some kinky shit with him. It's like NTR but isnt actually NTR</br>  <br>The funny thing is he did notice her smell. He just didn't know it was from her.</br>  <br>Be unable to follow simple order is usually a sign that you're not very bright, anon.</br>  <br>nah, I can't help but think of Ainz talking like a nazi in the middle of the act. Talk about a boner killer.</br>  <br>Because he never smell a pussy before</br>  <br>Racism and being a retard usually go hand in hand.</br>  <br>She's also terminally incompetent and takes a while to accept new orders.<br><br>but that's why we love her.</br></br></br>  <br>specist*<br>She doesn't seem to think that copying the image of a human is a big deal either. <br>As for retard she can't follow momon instructions to play the part of a human or even call him by a certain name so thats where it comes from. She also tries to melee down undead dragons while being a caster.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a summon, so it's loyal.</br>  <br> summoned outsiders are loyal <br>No wonder this shit game failed.</br></br>  <br>It's retard in positive way. Retard moe.</br>  <br>Even actual retards don't think racially, many lack the mental capacity to even think in such a way.<br><br>Arrogance stupidity and indoctrination are not to be confused with being a retard, otherwise special schools would be filled with rednecks</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz's was born as an Undead. It's just like the liches he creates, they're like normal people.</br>  <br>Except human beings in reality are born and raised. NPCs are ya know literally made the way they are. No different than someone being born blind.</br>  Please fucking tell me Shalltear will be in this episode?  <br>I shalltear your hopes apart.</br>  <br>nope, well, maybe. Episode 5 is more likely.</br>  <br>From the preview, it seems she will appear in the end of episode.</br>  <br>This season will have tons of her near the end, don't worry. Though if theres a second season the best scene with her will happen then.</br>    <br>Someone translated the WN version of Ainz unleashing the Super-tier spell on the Kingdom's army.<br><br>https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bx<wbr>6CgOVk4476Uy1PdU10LXh4Rkk/view?pli=<wbr>1</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Just at the end when Ainz gives that baller speech.</br>  <br>nope. Not going to read it till we're there.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the change of flags part.</br>  <br>He has access to all of their gear.</br>  <br>It has nothing to do with traps/reverse-traps, people generally like Mare and Aura even if it's not a whole lot. It's a feud about wiki/anti-wiki usage, the reliability of information posted here sometimes, and people blindly trusting information without sources.</br>  <br> Double unblockable Wail of Banshees. <br>Sounds like they could beat all the guardians together with that kind of firepower.</br></br>  <br>That was great, I can't wait until we get there.</br>  <br>Brilliant</br>  <br> That there was a player within the Kingdom’s forces <br>nope nope nope I'm gonna wait</br></br>  Is there a picture of albedo in her armor from the LN? Tried googling it and get papa bones or porn.  <br>No, all we know is that it's spiky and you can't tell her gender while she wears it.</br>   His eyes moved from the book and rested on a young woman who was sitting behind the counter, next to the young man. He spoke to her in a gentle voice. <br><br> “Is there a problem?” <br><br> “N-nothing at all…” <br><br> The girl blushed and lowered her face. <br><br> “I just thought… that your posture was quite striking.” <br><br> “Thank you very much.” <br><br> Sebas showed a gentle smile, causing the girl to blush even deeper. <br><br> The gray-haired gentleman Sebas was someone who you would be attracted to simply by looking at him. On top of his graceful countenance, he radiated an elegance that turned the heads of nine out of ten women, regardless of age. It could not be helped that the young woman at the counter would mindlessly stare at Sebas; it was quite common, after all. <br><br>Sebas muh boi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see how Touch Me pulled in his wife.</br>  <br>That was excellent.  I guess this means that Ainz still hasn't formally chosen an ally nation, or that he might be near choosing the Empire? </br>  <br>He probably just sits there and points at his baby old ones if anyone trys to cause shit.</br>   killing vampire loli   <br>  He chose the Empire since Kindom send an idiot envoy and piss him off, would be different if they send Gazef the man  </br>  <br>In about a year?</br>  <br>if that's what it takes</br>  <br>This is the WN, the LN is completely different story-wise.  In the WN, Ainz becomes a noble of the Empire. In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> killing vampires <br><br>You can't kill what is already dead!</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;In the LN, Ainz becomes Sorceror King of his own independent country. </br>  <br> You'd have to fuck up extremely badly to make Ainz angry enough that he personally comes to slaughter your army. </br>  <br>fucking 10/10</br>  <br><br> It's goes more like this:<br> Empire and Kingdom send their representatives to meet Ainz. <br> Kingdom sends a dick who doesn't understand the power of Nazarick <br> Empire sends the Emperor who praises Ainz and wants to ally him <br> When they are all gone, Demiurge tells everyone that the Emperor probably plans to betray Ainz.  <br> Ainz then decides to ally himself with the Empire,but also show his might to them in case they want to betray him later on.  <br><br><br>In the WN Ainz buys the head-magician of the Empire, gets to a magic school, becomes a noble and the head-magician convinces the Emperor to get on Ainz's good side, just to eventually put Ainz on the lead of the Empire. <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br><br>I prefer the LN way of doing this.<br>Nazarick is strong enough to be independent.<br>Administration will be bitch, but I'm sure they can manage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or everyone could just leave the undead lich alone and everything he does will to categorize as a natural disaster</br>  <br>In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. Demiurge and Shaltear divide up her scenes. <br><br>Poor Shaltear, she had Ainz all to herself. It's hard to imagine Overlord now without Albedo though.</br></br></br>  <br>And now Albedo is hogging all the fanartists' attention. Well Akenest is still loyal to waifural.</br>  <br> In the WN, Albedo also didn't exist. </br>  <br>That's so strange to think about.<br><br>Having had no contact with the WN, it just seems like you couldn't replace her if you tried.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither does Mare or Victim.</br></br>   Ainz getting embarrassed because he accidentally shows two lizards having sex to Aura and Mare <br><br>My evil overlord can't possibly be this cute</br></br>  <br>Victim sort of half-exists. The author threw around the concept, but never went into details about the 8th floor except that the alliance raid wiped there.</br>  <br> Ainz starts thinking about sex ed to the dark elves </br>  <br> implying Mare isn't a total slut <br><br>Remember that he will try to outbid Albedo for the right to sleep with Ainz.<br><br>Aura is pure and best daughter though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Mare is just....innocent.</br>  <br>He is. The most innocent</br>  <br> Animefag here. I heard the MC is a villain, but 3 episodes in and he's just generic hero, just a skeleton instead of flashy angel-like shit. <br><br>his decent into becoming a full blown super evil lich-king is surprisingly swift and subtle. parts of it start from the very beginning at the end of book 1 (we might see it next episode)  when he captured some priests/warriors from the theocracy and had them tortured to death for information <br><br>book 2 continues this decent into amoral evil when he casually starts to order  witnesses killed, and leaves comrades to die <br><br>book 3 expands on it further when he  slaughters a whole guild of adventurers rather then let them witness his fight with Shelltear. <br><br>book 4 gets even more grizzly as  he slaughters/enslaves a whole race of lizardmen just for an experiment and to teach some of the floor guardians how to think outside of the box. Meanwhile Demiurge has built a human "farm" where people are held captive; skinned alive to make magic scrolls, then healed with magic to repeat the process for more magic scrolls. <br/> <br>book 5/6 well he's  setting himself up to be a world power, so you probably can guess where this takes us.  <br><br>at this pace the anime will probably end in book 3, so he'll be fairly evil by the point. the problem is he stops thinking of himself as human. Being a lich robs him of "feelings" and "compassion" and he's so much more powerful then the "humans" he starts to see them as "lesser" lifeforms. <br><br>in the end he still has moments where he has acts of mercy/compassion, but they're always calculated to gain something for the Tomb, or as some sort of obligatory repayment to TouchME</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will there ever be a manly bath scene with Ainz, Demiurge, Cocytus, and Mare?<br><br>While Albedo and Shalltear fight over who gets to peep, so by the time they arrive the only one there is Victim.</br></br></br>  <br>So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right?<br><br>I really want Enri to live on as a loyal servant of her savior Ainz. Especially now that we know the werewolf maido is friends with her.</br></br></br>  <br> There's one threat looming in the horizon which will probably come to the forefront after volume 9. It's not a threat that can be beaten physically so Ainz will probably have to do some fast thinking. PDL's not particularly stronger than Nazarick combined but he does have his hand on a guild and potential WC items. <br>psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br>while WC items are deadly and potentially ruinous to papa bones, that's only if they catch him unaware. if he sees it coming they have zero chance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, after they are attacked by goblins and trolls.</br>  <br> psh. you do know he has access to 20 WC items, and the guild item is WC as well. <br><br><br>He has 12, and the Guild Weapon never comes out. It is said to rival with a WC item, but it would be one of the weak-ones, not the strong 20.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank our lord and savior Papa Bones!</br>  <br> the werewolf maido is friends with her. <br>I'm not so sure about that.</br></br>  <br> Warlord  Enri  the Bloody  is considered a subject of Ainz and Nazarick. <br><br> Since the Kingdom decided to attack Carne (which I highly doubt would qualify as a village anymore), Ainz enters the Kingdom-Empire War on the Empire's side. <br><br> Enri summons a 5,000 strong Goblin army that is supposedly professionally superior to either the Kingdom and the Empire's military. <br><br> &gt;Her army of 5000 goblins includes goblin Hoplites as core troops, goblin beast riders,17 goblin paladin on white wolf, goblin longbows, goblin magic support squad, goblin magic artillery squad, goblin medic squad, goblin musician squad, goblin assasination squad, 13 lvl43 goblin red cap honour guards and a goblin tactician dress as Zhuge Liang. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So Cairne village officially joins him when he becomes a world power, right? <br>its inside the sphere of influence, yes. and unless I've completely forgotten, I'm pretty sure they trade with the tomb. However i don't think Papa bones ever considered them important enough to make them part of his growing kingdom. its such a minor place with nothing of importance i doubt it even occurred to him.</br></br>  <br>   gobbo Zhuge Liang <br> I know what I'm using my next session. </br></br>   Sasuke being deadbeat dad and almost killed his daughter <br> Naruto humiliates his son in front of whole world <br>Can we all agree that Orochimaru is Best Dad/Mom?</br></br>  looks like the spoiler with Boruto being humiliated by Naruto is true<br>what the, Kishi?</br>  <br>Is Konohamaru ok with babysitting the son of the guy who killed his grandpa?</br>  <br><br>Explain further</br></br>  <br>Don't believe everything you hear on the internet anon.</br>  You know you've fucked up really bad when even Naruto can't forgive you.

Inojin berates him for not reading the atmosphere like usual.<br><br>Naruto and Hinata talk during the chuunin exam. Naruto tells Hinata to watch Boruto's match with her Byakugan.<br><br>Naruto does a lot of publicity stuff - filming commercials, doing interviews.<br><br>There is a scene of Hinata taking care of the Uzumaki house.<br><br>The new wristwatch tech allows jutsu to be sealed in gadgets instead of scrolls, so even non-shinobi can use jutsu.<br><br>Naruto and Sasuke do the Susano'o/Kurama combo during the battle.<br><br>Naruto leaves a kagebunshin to attend Himawari's party, but he gets exhausted during the battle and it bursts, causing the cake to fall.<br><br>Sasuke and Sakura apparently do not talk much if at all during the movie.

Everything feels finished for his saga. Now it's time for his son and daughter's legacy.<br><br>9/10 from me everything makes sense.</br></br>  so appearently a summary of the movie<br>http://privatter.net/p/930354<br>my google translation skills are not good enough to decrypt this</br></br>  <br> Puppets that need years of training <br> Dogs that need years of bonding to properly work together <br> Drugs that have either immediate or short-term negative effects that may even lead to death. <br><br><br>Yeah, fuck those guys, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   How about we set up a playdate for our kids sometime?   <br> we need to ban artificial assault jutsus <br>coup by 1010 when?</br></br>  <br>means this guy is the father</br>  <br>What if the reason they couldn't prosecute him is because the real original oro that cause mass genocide is dead, and this new oro is a sinless individual born from a lump of Anko's meat? Atleast I can see that kind of logic being used in court and succeeding</br>  <br>Trips confirm Oro has the best ninja lawyers money can buy</br>  <br>I'm sure he has his ninja lawyers on speed dial over the years.</br>   Those ninja tools created by the science division in Konoha allow ppl to use ninjutsu even if they aren't ninjas. Naruto prohibited the usage of these b/c he thought that;s not real power/strength. <br> In the second round of the chunin exam, Boruto was victorious and Naruto complimented him <br> he was so happy he cried <br> In the third round he didn't want to lose and he used them  <br><br>they are shinobi, cheating is what ninjas do<br>also poor Boruto, only wanted dadruto to aknowledge him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Chouji's spice pills have the lasting negative effects. Kiba feeds a regular soldier pill to Akamaru to charge him up during his match with Naruto.</br>  <br> Sasuke and Sakura apparently do not talk much if at all during the movie.  <br>Will Kishi ever shitting on them?</br></br>  <br>Better start calling Kishi "Dante" because of all that SSShitting.</br>  <br>It's implied that soldier pills are widespread among the shinobi so it's really Naruto's fault for not using them. Still, after its effects end you drop in exhaustion, which is a negative effect that could lead to your death in the battlefield.</br>  <br> Sasuke and Hinata have more dialogue than Sasuke and Sakura <br><br>It's too sweet.</br></br></br>  <br>There are plenty of shallow relationships like that in real life, there's nothing to see here.<br><br>Sasuke has ZERO REASON to give a shit about Sakura. She's got a pussy and can give birth to his child, and all she wants is his dick. Good enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, and gadgets that hold jutsu could save your life. How does good planning make Boruto a cheater?</br>   Katasuke (the scientist guy) is has a shady personality. It seems that he was encouraging Boruto to use the device. Seems to be a glib salesperson. <br><br> 'In a place with no water, there's this degree of suiton..!?' <br><br> Has to do with that bracelet device, I believe. Might have to do with the cheating. </br></br></br></br>  What if Sasuke really loves Sakura but is too embarrassed to admit?<br><br>What if they kiss and fuck all the time but Sasuke wipes her memories?</br></br>  <br> only shinobis should get hold of jutsus <br>fucking commie freedom-hating liberal Naruto<br>see this shit?<br>you cant do anything when ANBU knocks your door and puts you on ninja FEMA camps<br>Ninja or not, one should has right to hold jutsu weapons and form militias in order to oppose tyranny, and that right shall not be infringed!</br></br></br></br></br>  Just watched first episode.<br><br>The "twist" fell flat for me considering I figured it out after the first minute. Is this going to be Madoka 2.0 or does it retain the lighthearted elements?</br></br>  <br>Explain how you found out in the first minute. Of course I assume you don't mean literally but what tipped you off.<br><br> does it retain the lighthearted elements <br>Yes up until I certain incident.</br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 he read the manga</br>  <br> Madoka 2.0 <br><br>Just stop.</br></br></br>  <br>So Yuki waking up inside the school and getting dressed was enough for you to go "Yep, zombie apocalypse"?</br>  <br> finding out after the first minute <br>Oh well, if you watched it so late after all people on fucking /a/ were saying "HOLY SHIT THAT PLOT TWIST IN FIRST EP" everywhere in OPs, after details and images were spread en masse in dozens of threads, no wonder you got the idea. You trying to look so clever and condescending towards any kind of thematical subversion/scenaristic tool is ultimately a failure.</br></br>  <br> finding out after the first minute </br>  <br>I know you're manufacturing these "So I just watched GG and..." to make it seem like we're discussing something and this isn't a general, but you don't need to try so hard.</br>  I feel like we've already had this thread before. Hm.  <br>Trying to get my friend into it almost failed because the fucking synopsis almost spoiled it while we were downloading it. Sure he found out so early because he expected something as soon as I tabbed out of the synopsis. <br><br>Who fucking does that. He ended up finding out about it at the hard-tack scene (for the most part).</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's the deconstruction of Madoka's Evangelion.</br>  Did you figure out Megu-nee was already dead in the first minute?   Madoka 2.0 <br>Nice bait thread to keep the general going friend. Sage for obvious reasons</br>  <br>What the fuck anon WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT HOW TERRIFYING</br>  <br>Sadly, we can't blame the broadcasters for doing this, they have obligations to uphold and giving a short guess of what to expect in an anime is one of those. Lying or tricking someone into watching something whereas it ends up being something else could actually be taken into court, if I'm not mistaken.</br>  <br> Just watched first episode. <br><br>Just right after the last thread died? What a coincidence.</br></br></br>  <br>Granted, first minute was hyperbole. But by halfway the episode there's been the hints of the renamed rooms, the peculiar animation differences of the nonexistant characters, and Miki completely disregarding them.<br><br>The only thing in advance I knew was that there was gonna be a plot twist of some sort. And honestly it didn't feel very subtle to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you know? dressing girls is a symbol of zombie apocalypse in anime.</br>  <br>I just got here, there was no thread up so I made one. Bite me.</br>  <br>Well, you got the idea at least. It was supposed to give you hints before the reveal. I also knew something would happen at the end, the difference is that the anime actually bored me so I jumped half of the episode, and the plot twist hit me damn hard anyway. Expecting a plot twist is something, expecting the nature of said twist is an entirely different thing</br>  <br>If you knew there was going to be a twist then of course you were looking out for it. But things like animating background characters differently is incredibly common in anime, and for all you knew they were still setting up Miki as that sort of character. I read the manga ages ago so of course I knew, but I think they pulled it off decently enough to trick anyone going in blind. It dragged out a little long though.</br>  <br>That's not quite the first minute. Yeah, there are tons and tons of hints, some obvious and some not, they obviously wanted you to know there was something going on.<br><br>If it was just out of nowhere without any possibility of figuring anything out beforehand then it would be dumb and cheap.</br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean even things like Yuyushiki were in the middle of a zombie apocalypse?</br>  <br> common in anime <br>Yeah, so much stuff can be overlooked because of that.<br>Why are they living in the school? Moe anime.<br>Why is there a dog running around in school? Moe anime.<br>Why is Miki so socially retarded? Moe anime.<br>Why aren't there teachers stopping them? Moe anime.<br>Why do background characters keep disappearing? Moe anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Shamelessly requesting the Yuyushiki puppet theory.</br>  Reminder that Miki is involved in ALL Gakkou Gurashi ships  <br>For me the overly cutesy character even for a SoL made me suspicious and then the talking to people that no one else sees made it obvious.</br>  <br>Not in my personal ship.</br>    Kangaroo isn't real, is she?  <br> Rii is the only one without one <br><br> The bear doesn't count. </br></br></br>  Let's liven up the thread.  Is the Miki guy real or just an illusion?  <br>Miki is real.  The dick is an illusion. </br>      <br>How could you think Miki is an illusion?</br>  <br>Miki a real  slut. </br>  <br>Rii/Kurumi</br>  RII A  PUTA   <br>Too perfect to be real, for example you can realise Shovel is real because she is a slut.</br>  <br>Literally when?</br>  <br>Miki is not a slut. Miki is not a slut!</br>  <br>It's way too obvious to be a tweest, I bet she's actually real.</br>  <br>Has this chapter already been translated?</br>  <br>Having a stable love interest is not being a slut.</br>  <br>I ship Yuuri X Yuki.</br>  <br> red knees <br>slut</br></br>  I want to help Hika with her cravings.  <br>I'd like to tickle her thighs in private.</br>  Why is it so hard for Japan to just make a serious anime without any stupid little girl bullshit?  <br>Literally begging for semen.</br>  Is chapter 38 already translated?<br>It came out last week IIRC.</br>  <br>The twist isn't the point of this series. It doesn't even last the entire series. People hyping it up for the twist are big dummies.</br>  <br>Because children and pedophiles comprise the vast majority of the audience.</br>  <br>This. Makes me realize that she was a zombie since the beginning and she bite sempai.</br>  <br/>    <br><br>Maybe she has knee bursitis. Don't bully the shovel.</br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #6<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  Requesting a cute Tomoko  Requesting one of three things for Fujibayashi Ryou, please:<br><br> As a cute operator doing cute operator things; outfit reference: http://imgur.com/a/et72E#0 <br><br> freestyling like Ayumu Maihama, in pictured clothing http://imgur.com/sCiHDk6 <br><br> dressed like the Medic from Team Fortress 2 wearing the Physician's Procedure Mask and either the Geisha Boy or Surgeon's Stalheim <br>Medic: https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/<wbr>Medic<br>Items: http://imgur.com/a/xsVVn<br><br>Have a nice weekend!</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting C.C. cosplaying as Tama.

Tight swimsuits preferred, but draw what you are comfortable with.<br>Lancer Refs: http://imgur.com/a/Axfod/all<br>Doutanuki Refs: http://imgur.com/a/HsPXS/all<br> Being a husbandofag is as suffering as my husbando is, thank heavens my Battle Continuation and Endurance are Rank A when it comes to him. </br></br></br>  Requesting my beloved Mizuhashi Parsee wearing a nice green bikini being tsundere and a jealously girl, please  Requesting my lovely bassist, Akiyama Mio.<br><br>I'd like to see her in a cute sundress being happy.<br>If possible, having fun at the amusement park, with cotton candy in her hand.<br><br>Thank you if you consider, and have a nice week-end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you Ochakobro, I hope the coming week is favorable for you</br>  <br>Ryou and Ryuuko sharing a bite to eat while talking about their onee-chans.</br>  <br>How about Futayo Honda  and Mai Natsume  dueling?</br>  <br>I'm not requesting. You should find someone who still needs a delivery.</br>  <br>Chronoire and Mirai playing twister</br>  <br>No problem, same to you!<br><br><br>May I please request Erwin in either cute underwear or an old man sweater like in reference picture? Thank you!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Which waifus would you NOT like to see your waifu together with? I just don't want to annoy anyone.</br>  <br>It would just be better to link to anon's post without a pairing to ask if they are willing to pair up with your waifu. I'd probably be willing to pair up with anyone.</br>  <br>They said this doesn't count as a delivery<br> and I didn't wanna do the same old Ryou/Kyou pairing </br></br>  <br>Hex and Bleach girls</br>  <br> that red underwear <br><br>anon, i ...</br></br></br>  <br>Might I say that you have very interesting underwear choices there? I would have gone full on frills and bows for the best gap moe. Your choices are very good though, very cute in a different sense. Tight underwear is the best though. My husbando agrees.</br>  <br><br>I have a suggestion. How about, after this weekend's threads are over, we move on to a new thread in which we'll discuss just that? We could throw around ideas and see who we'd like to see her paired up with, and what they could be doing.</br></br>  <br>You have no clue at all how utterly risque male underwear can get, nor how frilly.</br>  I actually would like to see my waifu  shyly kissing another waifu while holding her hand   <br>NTR fags are really the worst.</br>  <br>I like red and I like Hello Kitty haha I'm glad you like my choices, anon! Tight underwear is totally he best.</br>  <br>If Kuromeanon doesn't mind, Kurome and Maka doing Tokusatsu poses together. Poses in pic related would be neat, but if you have something else in mind that's cool too.<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127934439 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128205338 <br>If Kuromeanon doesn't want in or has another suggestion I don't mind. I just wanted to see something with them together but I haven't seen him in a week or two...<br>Either way good luck with the collage!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add, it'd be great if she was wearing an elegant dress as well.</br>  Requesting Mazaki Anzu.<br>Follow this link for a random yu-gi-oh card to associate her with.<br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Specia<wbr>l:Random/Card_Gallery<br><br>Anything dance related is also very much appreciated. (Ballet, hula, samba, belly, break, rhythmic gymnastics etc)</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I'd be up for that probably. Link to it after the weekend.</br>  Requesting Mei Hatsume! Here's a big list of request ideas:<br><br>-Reading a comicbook<br><br>-Making a superhero costume or fitting a hero costume around a mannequin<br><br>-Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop<br><br>-This one is probably really hard, but I want a picture that makes it look like she's inside the monitor, fixing the insides behind a shattered part of the background. And to make it look like there's a glass wall between the viewer and the inside<br><br>-Cleaning/doing maintenance on her goggles <br><br>-Doing/wearing anything steampunk related<br><br>-Anything with her in chibi form<br><br>Thanks for considering!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who said I was into NTR? I thought it was cute. Don't you think it's sexy that you're waifu was experimenting to see if maybe she could treat you to a threesome one day?</br>  <br>Where is she from ? She's  so cute </br>  Requesting Kyou Fujibayashi dressed as White  <br>I'm really loving it so far. Was nice to wake up and see the updated progress on it. Just take your time and have fun finishing it. Thanks a ton!</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind</br>  <br>its not NTR if its yuri.</br>  Requesting Birdy in a Sarong bikini please. BEWARE some of the refs are of 3dpd, and are only intended as reference.<br>http://imgur.com/a/oKhX8#0<br>OR hair braiding.<br>http://imgur.com/nDKglCC <br>http://imgur.com/a/cmY90#0<br>Good luck everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like something with Youko, but I don't know if any other anon would want to pair their waifu with her.</br>  Requesting Aichi lazily playing a 3DS on a couch in casual clothing. If you have any ideas of your own that is fine too.  <br><br><br>and<br><br>In a battlebot competition? Or in spy gear spying on two anons.<br><br><br>She's from the manga Boku no Hero Academia and thank you for noticing how cute she is! I'm sure your waifu is cute too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My  girlfriend  ended up really getting into my waifu too. If VR ever takes off, we both want her.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out.</br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please. If the artist wants something specific they can have her legs on a desk while she's sitting or have her tied up in a glass cylinder like in Batman Forever.  <br> my gf </br>  <br>are we allowed to request if we already got a delivery this week?</br>  <br> its a collage so its independent of other deliveries </br>  <br>yes its collage rules.<br> plus I'm probably not going to finish today </br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Yeah the guy said its separate, just be sure to add to put people who haven't been delivered over yours I guess.</br>  <br>Requesting the last two leftover waifus that no one wants to see their waifu with in a PE class desperately trying to to convince the viewer to pick them first first for his team. Or if it's just one her trying to do PE class pair activities by herself while everyone has fun around her.</br>  Happy Birthday Kurisu!  <br>Everyone but Moeka has their own ending, I think they made up for that with the Attractor Field Gamma audio drama</br>  <br>Suzuha's is an unknown, and the romance is glossed over heavily in Rukako's. Faris's is not romantic (but in a romantic situation). Only Mayuri's is an actual relationship for Okabe.</br>  <br>Wait  Aren't Okabe and Feris boyfriend and girlfriend in Feris's ending? Y'know due to Okabe ending up in Attractor Field Omega? </br>  <br>Only technically speaking. As that life was lived by a different Okabe, Faris and Okabe are now in a vaguely distressed awkward position of pretending to be boyfriend and girlfriend.</br>  <br>I'm not him, but thats probably why he said Faris route is in a romantic situation.<br><br>Anyway, is someone in thread going to mail Kevin, or are we waiting for Kurisu's death day?</br></br></br>  If we group the girls by maturity and the most complete girl for Darling, the list should be something like this (?) <br><br>1) Rachnee<br>2) Cerea<br>3) Miia-Mero<br>4) Papi-Suu<br><br>As always the playlist.<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>For the casual faggots or the people who doesn't read the last chapter of the manga go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No Polt...</br>  <br>no argument there</br>  I think all the girls are cute, and each have their own charms  <br>Just how the fuck did this happen?</br>  <br>Headcanon dictates that Rachnee secretly wants darling to take the lead. But regular answer is because of reasons</br>  Alcoholic Cakes    <br><br>She's just so soft. Everything about her looks so soft. I just want to hug this ball of softness.</br></br>  <br>From top to literal who now. What happened.</br>  <br>I usually like my idols flat and small, but it's impossible to resist Airi.</br>    MS scans up:<br><br>http://readms.com/r/akame_ga_kill/6<wbr>1/2878/1</wbr></br></br>  <br>Because she's the final boss</br>  <br><br>She has one of the few powers that are capable of creativity?<br><br>Well, there was Lubbock's, and he did a few things with it before dying, I guess. Most of the others are all too straightforward or on characters that die in 2 pages.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she has a power that allows her to be creative.<br><br>Hard to be too creative with a sword, or a suit of armour. But some hax shit that brings up Ice out of nowhere? Thats pretty malleable.</br></br></br>  <br> series shows rape <br> main characters never have sex <br>Is the main character status quo curse in all battle shonen series, doesn't matter how edgy it can get. Main heroines have to stay pure no matter what, main male characters have to try to look badass while obviously are "too busy" to get laid and usually die a heroic virgin death. Or just have a harem death, this series is obviously pointing to the first one</br></br></br>  <br>Takahiro asspulls.</br>  what's the worst mecha ever made and why is it it aldnoah.zero?  Not the worst, but G gundam is seriously fucking overhyped<br><br> Tournament style gundam <br><br>No.<br><br>Dropped that piece of shit 3 episodes in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Valvrave was aware of how stupid it was and spent most of the first season laughing at itself.</br>  <br>That's not Greco/try</br>  <br>Pure shit taste. Off yourself<br>G Gundam is great and really fun</br></br>  Cross Ange. It's absolutely dreadful and also simultaneously the best mecha in years.  So can we all agree this is the worst, most blatant wish-fulfillment mary sue fantasy to ever come out of Japan?  I'm enjoying that slime reincarnated manga  <br>The ones with the mc being a loser before are even worse</br>  <br>Yeah but it's done right. There's actual characterization, conflicts, plot, and drama and the MC is powerful but not completely broken (dragon god is though).<br><br>Can't really say that for most series in its genre.</br></br></br>  <br>with the loser one there's at least some "issues" the Mc has to deal with.<br><br>with the gary stu one it's gary stu A becomes gary stu B.</br></br></br>  <br>It's even worse when there are no actual explicit bullshit video game mechanics but everything still inexplicably works like an RPG with idiotic spells and items and shit.<br><br>Also, adventurer's guild that works with ranking system, every single fucking one.<br><br>I don't understand. Even in the worst of manga, this kind of shit is pretty uncommon, they at least try to pretend they have a world that isn't based on RPG mechanics. Yet every other one of these does this.</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
