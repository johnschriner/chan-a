[ Jonathan's stand is The World.  <br>You're so wrong it hurts. Stands are based off spirit not body.</br>  <br>You're so wrong it hurts. There's a reason why Dio would, if he lived, have the stand abilities of Jojos.</br>  <br> There's a reason why Dio would, if he lived, have the stand abilities of Jojos. <br>Counterpoints are usually more effective if you give the reason retard.</br></br>  The dub will be revealed in roughly seven hours from now.  <br>Araki already said that jon's stand is hermit purple just like joseph or similar like it</br>  <br>I just can't imagine jojo characters speaking in english <br><br>This is gonna be good</br></br></br>  Speaking of Stands, why are they so shit compared to just Hamon? I swear Araki ruined it when he introduced them.  <br>You're a faggot.<br><br>The description of The World tarot card links with Jonathan more than Dio. For example,"You will be more involved in your community or interests. You have a strong desire to contribute, to ‘give back’, or to use a special gift or talent to help make the world a better place. You are coming from a good place now of love, knowledge and experience and you are ready to share this with others." Jonathan uses the power of the ripple to stop Dio and stop the vampirification of the village. <br><br>The reversed World links more with DIO. "The reversed World can also indicate a time when you are close to reaching completion but for whatever reason, you lose focus and slack off right at the end. " Dio almost killed all the crusaders, but lost focus when he got High.<br><br>I could go on, but this is just a Chilean Mining Helpline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This whole post </br>    The World is Jotaro's stand.  <br><br>you know hamon is better, you just don't want to admit it.</br></br>  <br> implying any of that matters <br>Fuck off, Araki said you're wrong and so did common sense. Since you're so stuck to your headcanon maybe you'd like to explain how all the other tarot-card stands apply to their users?</br></br>  <br> Sparkly sun shit <br> Better than "I can give characters any fucking powers I want to make the fights interesting" </br></br>  <br><br><br>I agree. But we're probably in the minority.</br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro is Holly and Sadao Kujo's son.</br>  <br> Araki said you're wrong <br><br>No he didn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Nahh It's not. It's a mind and body super power that could only go the route of some DBZ level shit. Also Hamon was worthless against anything that wasn't a vampire so the whole Holy order vs vampire thing would get old pretty quickly.<br><br>Stands were a change that Araki needed to express his creativity. Sure they started off pretty rough but they have grown to something much more special than Hamon/ripple could ever be<br><br><br>Although Part 2 actually made Hamon a bit better with it's different way of utilizing it<br><br><br>Okay I am done.<br> GOD FUCKING DAM IT I LOVE JOJO </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He should've used both Hamon and Stands to actually make fights interesting. </br>  <br>If the World is Jonathan's stand how come another universe Diego had him?</br>  Since you need potential to get a stand, i wonder if heaven's door could write, you have potential and bam there you go.  <br>That's SBRverse. Same rules don't apply, since SBRverse Jonathan had a stand that could spin to infinity.</br>  <br>That's all I imagine them doing.<br>Except Jotaro and Josuke.</br></br>  <br> What is JOJO-A-GOGO <br> What is over heaven <br>Just stop.</br></br></br>  What would Crazy Diamond Requiem do?  <br>Over Heaven doesn't really count because Nisio Isin isn't Araki, but JOJO-A-GO-GO is by Araki and is specifically a databook so it's not even debatable.</br>  <br>Jotaro had an American grandpa and daughter, I'm sure he spoke more English than you'd expect</br>  <br>You got me there. Accent then.<br>Jojo being dubbed is something that just feels right.</br></br>  Repeating the question from the earlier thread because it was asked while it was on Page 10.<br><br>How would Erina react to all the JoJos past Joseph?</br></br>  <br> Jotaro had an American grandpa and daughter, I'm sure he spoke more English than you'd expect <br>His mother was also American and he never saw the side of his family that spoke Japanese so I would assume he spoke mostly English.</br></br>  <br>I could see her being more strict with them than Jonathan, but not to the point they'd dislike her. She was already that way with Joseph.<br><br>I think her genes are the reason for the rest of the Joestars' bad attitudes. Well, her and Lisa Lisa to add some of that Jotaro stoicism.</br></br></br>  Guise<br><br>Will pt.4 be adapted by David Productions</br></br>  <br>Most likely yes but no confirmation likely for months.</br>  I fucking love Josefumi's design.  <br>Are we seeing the dub today?</br>  <br>Erina would have none of Jotaro's bullshit. The moment he dares say shit, she's gonna slap his hat out of his head.</br>  <br>Josuke_before_Josefumi is here now.</br>  <br>She'd slap Jotaro for being a shitty son and talking back to his mother.<br>She'd be apprehensive regarding Josuke and his being an illegitimate son, but warm up to his good nature.<br>She'd want nothing to do with Giorno once she learned who his father was and what sort of business he dabbles in.<br>She'd be strict with Jolyne, though not as much as with Jotaro, and try to teach her how to be a proper lady.<br>She'd get along with Johnny, be impressed by his feats despite his condition, but dislike his spiteful nature.<br>She'd think Gappy's a nice kid and try to help him in any way she could.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's being screened. We might get reactions, but not much else likely.</br>  <br><br>SHAVE THOSE SIDEBURNS</br></br>  <br>Someone might risk recording it and post it somewhere<br><br>I just want to know that when Jonathan speaks I won't hear Yu/Adachi</br></br></br>  <br>fix people's shit taste</br>  <br> no wanting Yu to voice Jonathan <br> please no  he's a good VA but his voice just wouldn't work </br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's a priority. Just something not modern voice sounding in general.</br>  <br>It would be an automatic thing like Bites the Dust, as soon as a vitim of BtD is about to die, Crazy Diamonds Requiem repairs them until Josuke kills Kira.<br><br>Your new ability is not based on you, It's based on what you need at the time you're pierced by the arrow.<br>Kira needed a safe way to keep people from knowing who he is.<br>Giorno needed the opposite of what Diavolo could do, and ended up becoming super OP</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Josefumi is here now.</br>  <br><br>I feel like Johny Yong Bosch will botch it.<br>Or it won't sound as perfect as the jap version.<br><br>Especially Battle Tendency, no one can replicate how amazing the VA's in that were. I want to see an American VA try to copy ACDC's crying scene.</br></br></br></br></br>  Joseph was the best JoJo and you can't prove me wrong.  <br><br>Did Josefumi save Joshu from bullies and that's why he shaved his sides and looks like an even more shit version of him?</br></br>  <br>are those eyes meant to show the Crazy Diamond eyes? Nice</br>  <br>How will they even pronounce Esidisi?</br>  <br>Like you spelt it</br>  <br>Ee-see-dee-see?</br>  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>Ess-ee-dess-ee</br>  <br>essydessy</br>  <br>A C D C</br>  <br>No its not, Stands have much more variety and are interesting unlike kung fu sun powers.</br>  <br> She'd want nothing to do with Giorno once she learned who his father was and what sort of business he dabbles in. <br><br>;_;<br><br>But Giorno is most gentle jojo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I fucking love Josefumi's design. <br>you're drunk, Karera</br></br>  <br>They wouldn't risk the lawsuit</br>  <br>He's also the most powerful crime lord in Italy and son of the vampire fucker that kissed her against her will and killed her husband.</br>  <br> She'd think Gappy's a nice kid and try to help him in any way she could. <br>And Gappy would attempt to violently corner her asshole because no one can simply be nice to Gappy without an ulterior motive.</br></br>  <br>He isn't Okuyasu</br>  <br>But she saved that vampires fucking life and is ultimately the reason part 3 fucking happened</br>  <br>Looks like Killer queen.</br>  <br>Of course it is.</br>  So do we have a dub cast yet guys? Other than Diskin as Joseph and the SDC cast, I mean.  <br><br>So basically Erina is a strong independant black woman thats going to hold Giorno responsible for ancestor's actions.</br></br>    <br><br>Here's hypothetical situation.<br><br>Funny uses D4C to bring Another Josuke into his current dimension. Josuke not only having the power to fuse things, can also heal things. <br><br>What happens now /a/?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to that fuck. She's only strict with Joseph because she's her direct grandson. A grandmother's fury wanes with every generation.<br><br>By the time she gets to Jolyne she'll be super doting.</br></br></br>  What was the explanation behind stands again? From what I remember, they literally came out of no where.  <br>Arrow from a meteorite</br>  <br>The final stage of hamon/born with it/given it by getting pierced by arrows made from a meteor</br>  <br>Imagine being an army or some shit figuring that out for the first time<br><br>"Archers! Loose your arrows"<br>and then the entire enemy force gets Stands and fucks your world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for improving on my shitty paint work, meepz. Great to have you around again.</br>  <br>Josuke looks really cute with the Josefumi eyes<br><br>Mega homo</br></br></br>  <br>No problem man. Just get a little bit better with Ps or Gimp or whatever you use</br>  <br><br>/a/ is making fun of us again</br></br>  <br>Paint.net fam. I know, I know :_:</br>   tfw you watch the stream on habit <br>I hate fridays.</br>  <br><br>And Polnareff needed a way to seal himself into a turtle? Makes sense I guess.</br></br>  Any thoughts?  <br>Get on some Gimp/Photoshop, man. If you don't want to torrent i'm pretty sure Gimp is free.<br><br><br>Josephs hair looks like some One Direction shit 3/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're too cruel mang t.t</br>  <br><br>I don't want to nitpick, but it's the final stage of anything that you try your hardest at while excelling at it. This does include hamon, but also spin, and italian cooking. Or you could just be born with it, or having been pierced by the arrow, it forms from either something you're good at (like Joseph, his stand HP combo's well with his Hamon skills), or just something seemingly random (or we just don't know enough about every stand user in the series to make connections between themselves and their stand's powers).</br></br>  <br>Mariah got a magnet stand because her legs are just that damn attractive</br>  <br>The anime fucked up Joseph's face so bad.</br>  <br>So if I'm the best shitposter I could get a stand? Sounds good man. I'd name it [lol] since that gets people in a rage here.</br>  <br>The red aja also looks like a piece of candy. Fix those two things and it wouldn't be bad</br>  <br>I also just realized that I accidentally implied that Joseph had been pierced by the arrow, which isn't true. Dio/Jonathan's body had been pierced, and the curse caused the Joestars to get stands. So Joseph was indirectly affected by the arrow.<br><br><br>right on</br></br></br></br>  <br>fix his scarf up too because it's pretty great when it's green and yellow but block green is bad.</br>  <br>How do you know red aja isn't a hunk of super hardened sugar  besides the wrong chemical properties , and that Kars was essentially killed when he attacked a piece of jolly rancher joseph had been saving?<br><br><br>lol<br><br><br>what? you don't like tumor lips?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't notice that but looking at it it does look bad. Adding that in should be pretty easy at least</br>  <br>I think GATE took its slot. Not a bad manga, probably going to be QUALITY as fuck anime wise though.</br>  Here are the covers<br>http://imgur.com/a/SdA3O</br>  If Part 4  ever  gets announced<br><br>What should the ED be?</br></br>  <br>Polnareff needed to protect the arrow<br>He died but his stand lived, and switched everybody's spirits.</br></br>  <br><br>Definitely the ed edd and eddy song</br></br>  Does anyone got a png of pic related?  <br><br>not that exact one, but there's this</br></br>  post the most fabulous jojo image you have  <br>Speaking of which<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wb_<wbr>60F8kBmc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>How come there's no EE&amp;ExPart 4 parody?</br></br></br></br></br>    when pucci speaks about "the oblivion of death" during the MIH-arc, does he imply that those killed by MIH have their souls destroyed?<br><br>since there is some kind of afterlife judging by the fact that buccellati, avdol, iggy and joseph all turned into ghosts (or something), does that mean that if you get killed by MIH, not only are you unable to get to the "next" universe, your souls is destroyed?<br><br>i got that impression when pucci speaks about said "oblivion", maybe he's just being dramatic, but we didn't see any ghosts of jolyne and the gang</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  Josefumi is here now  <br>Didn't Jotaro get killed because of MiH's effects? He made it in, kind of.</br>  <br>Shit, maybe that's why they were reincarnated into different people.

Joseph would know about the stand so he would know to just run to Alessi</br>  <br>Joseph would bullshit together a plan involving light bouncing off windows onto his feet in order to find where it was.Or just end up not touching it because of how lucky he is.</br>  <br>What American grandpa?

You can see DIO use it several times, hes one of the few people to ever have two stands</br>  <br>Johnny Yong Bosch is Jonathan and Robbie Daymond is Smokey.</br>  <br>They already did the first three episodes of PArt 3 as a test, look them up. I think they got Old Joseph as spot on as they could</br>  <br> It's really fucking surprising that Dio, who was alive and not related to Johnathon in anything but rivalry, had the stand The World in SBR then, huh. </br>  <br>He would have had all the Jojo stands if he didn't die. Joseph had hermit purple, so did Dio. Jotaro had a stand with the potential to stop time, Dio got that too. It would have been a matter of time before he got the restorative abilities of Crazy Diamond.</br>  <br>...<br>Youre kidding right?<br>Since when have stands been even slightly related to the descriptions of the tarots?</br></br></br>  <br>Youre the worst kind of Devil's Advocate<br>But fuck it, go read Part 7 then, the only other part to have Harmon in it. A form of it anyway</br></br>  <br>So you're saying  it just works?  it can negate stand effects?</br>  <br>Richard Epcar is fantastic in old man roles</br>  <br>If that's what「The Rock」wishes to believe.</br>  <br>They're not hiring traditional anime voice actors<br>The guy who played Numbuh One from KND is Joseph. Jotaro is voiced by the Leon S Kennedy guy.</br></br>  <br> ... </br>  <br>Are you implying that spin is hamon?</br>  <br>Ben Diskin and Matt Mercer do anime too.</br>  <br>Isn't Abdul a completely new guy too?</br>  <br>And the reason is...?<br>He got hermit purple -&gt; Jonathan, Joseph and the mother's stand.<br>He got The World -&gt; his own stand.<br>Why does Jotaro have a time-stopping stand too? Who knows. Maybe Araki screwed up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> WeeklyTubeShow will never dub JJBA and give Dio the Piccolo/Rapeman voice </br>  <br>Diskin and Mercer have both been in a bunch of anime.</br>  <br>either read the manga or watch the anime, it has descriptions that fit them all. I may not agree completely that The World is Jonathan's stand, but you're wrong with saying the tarots have nothing to do with stands. Even the egyptian god stands are connected to their god's meanings/powers.</br>  <br>someBODY ONCE TOLD ME</br>  <br>He wrote it like that probably to have an epic ending. Probably something along the lines of "it was fated that those 2 would fight"</br>  <br>Ben Diskin has voiced in a good amount of anime, check his wiki page</br>  <br> &gt;WeeklyTubeShow <br><br>Holy fuck, I thought I was the only one who knew about him on here. The most based VA of all time. RIP ;_;</br></br></br>  <br> Dio used his version of Crazy Diamond to heal Pucci's leg </br>  Which would you work for and why.  <br>"Thats a nice watch. <br>Too bad you wont be able to read time on it once I break it<br>  Your face that is." </br></br></br>  <br>vanilla ice is the only exception, he and he alone is the only one with a stand that isn't named after an egyptian god or a card in part 3</br>  <br>no shit</br>  <br>My fucking nigga. I knew someone would recognize that name.</br>  <br>Him and Tenore Sax, who wasn't named until the databook</br>  <br>I don't remember Vanilla Ice's leotard having such a high cut in the manga</br>  <br>Only DIO, but Valentine would be a great boss to work for.</br>  <br>but he's cold  as ice <br>so it still works</br></br>  <br>good question<br>since i'm not american, valentine is out of the question, also i'm quite skeptical towards catholic priests, and kira doesn't need any underlings, kars would probably eat me or turn me into a mindless zombie<br><br>that leaves dio or diavolo<br><br>i'd probably just work for diavolo since he's a reasonable boss if you just mind your own business, i'd earn money through passione, and besides, unlike DIO, diavolo/passione are very well-connected, they have ties to the goverment and control over large parts of italy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are fucking brothers in arms now, you know that right bro?</br>  <br> Doppio and Diavolo in the same room </br>  <br>Can I join too? His HNK dub was amazing</br>  <br>DIO. If he can let people like gamer D'arby and Nukesaku hang around his mansion and give Hol Horse a bunch of chances, then I have a shot at living. <br>Kars would eat you eventually. Not Murican enough for Valentine. If Diavolo doesn't kill you for some reason then you still have to watch for assassins. Kira doesn't work with anyone and Pucci is one of the more ruthless dudes who'll kill you even if you succeed like he did with Manhattan Transfer. Plus, I might get to fuck DIO.</br></br>  <br> every jojo thread ever </br>  <br>Two stands users are a gorilla and a inanimate sword</br>  <br>I'm implying that it's probably related to it</br>  <br>THIS SON OF A BITCH TOOK HIS BODDDDDYYYYY!</br>  <br> Putting Diego with the villains </br>  <br>Just use whatever fucking definitions of the tarot araki used. it literally says on the gorilla's wiki page "As a massive ocean liner, it is the largest stand ever seen. It has absolutely no will since Forever has absolute control over it. It represents the Tarot Card Strength, which symbolizes a challenge to fight, strong will and hidden potential."</br>   When someone in a family line awakens a stand it may cause other members within the same line to also awaken their stands <br> Jotaro, Holly, Joseph, and Josuke all awakened stands after Jonathan's body awakened its stand <br> people are still so fucking dumb that they think The World is entirely DIOs <br><br>Dio, the guy who had to steal another person's stand in SBR.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dio has control over 2 stands because he has control over Jonathan's body. Can we agree that there are 2 souls in Dio/Jonathan's body, and that's why there are 2 stands? It's just that Dio is so much more dominant.</br>    <br>What about Zeppeli?</br>  <br>spin is the best ability</br>  <br>We definitely are. It's not often you find an anon that enjoys JJBA and WTS.</br>  <br>Im not agreeing with anything anyone on /a/ says because you faggots cant into JOJO.<br>Reading these threads is like watching a pit of plague rats bite and shit all over each other.</br></br>  <br><br>That's a pretty terrible argument. Hamon was powered by spirit the same way as stands and effected physical things. Araki dropped it for zero reason. They could have chosen to make ripple effective against stands just like Araki decided to have it effect Pillar men as well as vampires.<br><br>Ideas revisited later with stands were always done better when it was with the ripple. Kakyoin hiding HG underneath the plane was a lame version of Joseph's string trick and overtime they tried to do something clever with trajectories it was never as cool as when it was first done with Joseph shooting Whamu in the back. Super Fly was such a shitty fight in comparison.</br></br></br></br>  So a friend of mine is running a D&amp;D game, I've been having good fun as a rogue, however due to a small party fuck up involving a cult, my character was stabbed with a some kind of random were-form dagger.<br><br>My DM rolled and it turns out my character is now a were-raptor.

I should create and bring in said motive.</br>  <br> Can't into Jojo <br>What the fuck do you even mean? Telling us we don't understand Jojo just because you don't agree with us?<br><br>Also, I invite you to check out the SnK thread, it's literally 10x worse than these threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>show us where he said that so we can finally end this fucking bullshit</br>  <br> Implying I always post with my trip. </br>  <br>sorry to butt in what does that even imply?</br>  Why does it matter who "The World" belongs too? if its Jonathan it doesn't matter cause he's pretty dead its not he'd come back. If its Dios...good for him but to think the big old villain's real stand is "Hermit Purple" is kinda funny.  <br>What do you mean? What he is implying or what i'm implying?</br>  <br>Not sure Araki likes that kind of stuff.</br>  <br>I replied to you, of course I fucking meant to what you're implying.<br><br>Doc posted the face the anon wanted but you make it sound like the anon wanted the other face.</br></br></br>  I finally decided to chek out the italian translation of Vento Aureo, and it's way better than the english one.<br><br>On the matter of GER and the final fight it's clearly stated by Diavolo that:<br>GER power is rewinding back the deleted time, he realizes this as he notice he's saying the same things again.<br>He's sure he will win because he has foreseen Giorno getting hit.<br>At this point GER states that Diavolo's prediction is indeed correct but he will never be able to grasp that truth nor getting close to it. Notice it's always used the term "truth" and not "reality".<br>GER power is to turn action, will and power to zero. Notice the english translation doesn't explicity states "powers".<br>Lastly to be stuck in the death loop you have to get hit physically by GER.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Knees weak</br>  <br><br> Jotaro is voiced by the Leon S Kennedy guy. <br><br>Oh my god<br><br>it's perfect<br><br>it will create a shitty comeback delivery singularity<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o7B<wbr>tSPDuGJc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So older d'arby really was actually smarter than younger d'arby, right?<br><br>Younger just thought he was smarter since older never wanted to play cards with him, but I got the impression that was just because younger sperg'd out over getting his gf stolen, and older probably thought younger was a cunt.<br><br>Also, older literally had no stand abilities aiding him during his competition against the crusaders, he almost beat them just with his own wit, while younger relied on his stand and couldn't even win that way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm implying I was the guy asking for the face to use for this edit  and that doc was too late since I already made the edit I wanted. I don't always post with my trip on</br>  <br>so GER nullifies diavolo's powers? acts as a direct counter to the time skip and undoes the erasal of time?<br><br> GER power is to turn action, will and power to zero. <br>isn't that the general consensus of GER's powers?</br></br></br></br>  <br>  I don't always post with my trip on <br><br>keep it on, I want to filter you.</br></br></br>  <br> Filtering OC <br>k m8</br></br>  <br>it was stated in over heaven</br>  <br>yes, it's clearly stated in the manga by jotaro that daniel was way more clever, telence just used his stand as a crutch, he wasn't particularly intelligent, not anywhere near daniel, he relied on atum too much</br>  <br>you forgot your trip.</br>  Jonathan's soul should've gone to [ H E A V E N ] a long time ago along his potential stand, so it doesn't make sense that DIO inherited his stand regardless if it is the hermit purple copy or the world.  <br>They make it go and see what happens</br>  <br> so GER nullifies diavolo's powers? acts as a direct counter to the time skip and undoes the erasal of time? <br>Exactly.<br> isn't that the general consensus of GER's powers? <br>Yes but as I said before.<br> Notice the english translation doesn't explicity states "powers". </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kinda understand how GER works but that's the most bullshit power I've ever seen.<br><br>It's like saying "you want to attack me ? Nah your attack is already cancelled anyway"</br></br></br>  <br>Hmm? I don't use a trip</br>  <br>I swear they have to be aware of the attack</br>  <br> &gt;Notice the english translation doesn't explicity states "powers". <br>i still don't get it</br></br>   araki has probably forgotten about the bite marks Joshuu and Josuke got <br><br>There's a lot of explaining to do in part 8, it'll probably end up being the longest part</br></br>  <br>YOU FORGET BILLIE JEAN FUCKER</br>  <br>also jojo a-gogo</br>  <br>As you said before the general consensus that GER turns action and will to zero is right.<br>However for the sake of precision it's better to say that it acts as direct counter to any power in a specific way, in Diavolo's case it rewinds back the deleted time.<br>So saying that GER power is to turn action, will AND power to zero is slightly more correct.<br>It implies that is a specific counter and not a general one even if the result is the same.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  I want to cum inside DIO.  <br>That blatantly incorrect, total conjecture<br>Jonathan's stand = Hermit purple, same as Holly and Joseph. Dio can use it through Jonathans body<br>Dio's own stand = The World<br><br>End of discussion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kars would just kill you<br>Kira wouldn't want henchman who would know about his murders so he'd just kill you<br>Valentine wouldn't let you work for him unless you already had a stand but a cushy government job is tempting<br>DIO, DIavolo and Pucci would all potentially give you stands but working for Passione probably gives you the biggest life expectancy and ability to use your powers to the fullest, as DIO expects you to potentially die for him and working for Pucci means you spend your days either working or incarcerated in prison</br></br></br></br>    <br>Same universe only rebooted<br>Yeah, ok.</br></br>  <br>You're dumb, Diego's The World is like DIO's The World because it's iconic to his character, it has nothing to do with the stand being Jonathan's or not. If we're going by your argument, Johnny's stand is Jonathan's stand. You big nerd</br>  <br>Exactly. Also, in one of Led  Zeppeli n's album's they have the old hermit from the hermit tarot card in them. The Zeppeli's are the closest allies to the Joestar's. Why would Dio have a stand that has relation to the Zeppeli's?</br>  <br> 3 Joestars have the same type of Stand <br>This is retarded. The theory about DIO's Stand's being the ability to use the Joestar's Stands makes more sense, Holly's Stand was supposed to stop time, but then Araki couldn't think of a way Jotaro could defeat DIO without stopping time, so he scratched that. That's why DIO has HP and a Stand similar to Jotaro's.</br></br>  <br>Using Diego as an argument literally goes nowhere because it's either<br> Diego "Dio" Brando has the stand that DIO had <br>It must be Dio's stand in part 3<br> Diego "Dio" Brando has the stand that DIO had <br>It must just be because it's "iconic to his character" when DIO controlled Jonathan's stand.<br><br>Just fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He needs to read Vento Aureo to know that stands are based in the soul and not the body.</br>  <br>god they're gorgeous</br>  <br>That originally might have been the case, but we're in the future, not the past   except we're arguing about something written in the 80s . <br><br><br>And where was this said<br><br><br>And this is why I said that Jonathan's soul must still be inside his body but Dio had complete control over it, similar to how Diavolo could kick out Doppio from control, except DIO always held the reins</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DIO stole Jonathan's body <br> Jonathan's body has Zeppeli's life force <br>There.</br></br></br>    <br>That doesn't prove anything, if that's true, then why does DIO have two stands?<br><br> Jonathan's soul must still be inside his body <br>I think we put more thought into this than Araki himself</br></br></br></br>  <br> Jonathan's soul must still be inside his body <br>It's most likely that remains of his soul are in his body. I mean if things like tables have a soul then it doesn't sound so far fetched.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Stands are based on souls. Zeppeli didn't give Jonathan his soul, just his Hamon energy which buffed up his body. I believe this must be true because how else could Zeppeli have been talking to Jonathan after he transferred his ripple and became old? If there was no soul in Zeppeli's body, he wouldn't have been able to talk. And don't say that he transferred his soul after he gave Jonathan his ripple. That doesn't make sense, Jonathan was already buffed up at that point and wouldn't make sense to.</br>  <br>Yes we did haha. I think it's because some part of Jonathan's soul is in the body, some part of his fighting spirit  which may be why Dio still couldn't use his vampire powers <br><br>yeah I'd say this. where did it say table have souls?</br></br></br>  If The World isn't jonathan's stand, then how is Platinum Crusader so similar?  Okay I'm sure this has been asked plenty of times but I've always wondered:<br><br>If the Crusaders had to kill DIO to elimate Holly's Stand, wouldn't that ALSO remove Hermit Purple and Star Platinum? Do they keep theirs because they can control it?<br><br>Not gonna lie, would've been really interesting to keep the series going had Jotaro lost his Stand. Araki could've just ended it really, or Part 4 could've been Jotaro's search for the Arrow to get Star Platinum back to stop some DIO-related big bad. Makes you think, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When Emporio explained how he could go to the ghost room thing, I think. It's been a while.</br>  Name a cooler scene than when Josuke uses Crazy Diamond to break the motorcycle he is riding to avoid hitting a baby carriage then repair it before hitting the ground.  <br>  fate  <br><br><br>Let's talk about something else pleeeease I'm getting bored of this old shit</br></br></br></br>  I SAW IT<br>HE HAD [4] BALLS</br>  <br>In dead men questions it was show that inanimate objects have a soul and there are stands that can manipulate those souls.</br>  <br>I don't think Jotaro gives a shit about SP, he never even used timestop in between parts 3 and 4, the only thing that interests Jotaro is the ocean. He probably  fucked a dolphin. </br>  <br><br><br>Well, It is Jonathon and Zeppeii = world.<br><br>Consider that Jonathan and William fused together in order to defeat the giant knights. William spirit is in Jonathon spirit/DNA. It is like if Erina was having a three-way with them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime only here, but DIO having Za Waudo makes the most sense.<br> Stands are based off of your own spirit. <br> DIO has always wanted everything the Joestar bloodline has had/earned. <br>It's not fucking rocket science.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not only that, but Crazy Diamond looks just like The World.<br>But yeah, this is going nowhere, change the topic please.</br></br>  <br><br><br>No. We're settling this shit now once and for all. Someone get in contact with araki if we have to</br></br></br>  <br><br>Josuke might be fused with another guy or another universe josuke.</br></br>    <br>and star platinum looked kind of like kars, we are lucky golden expirence didnt look like killer queen</br>  <br>Vanilla Ice coldly killing Avdol<br>  jk  <br><br><br>Yeah we can only assume that Holly's stand rejected Holly, so when the "curse" was lifted it left her. Joseph's and Jotaro's stands gladly accepted their owners and stayed I guess. <br><br>That plot point would have been cool, but how would they have found about the arrows? Maybe in Dio's diary  Diory  then they would go back to his castle/building and shoot Jotaro. Would have been intersting if he got a different stand though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can we all agree this is the better josuke</br>  <br>hi guys anon conatacted me im araki ama</br>  <br>Now that's my room.</br>  <br> Holly's stand rejected Holly <br>It's the other way around.</br></br>  <br>They were tied by destiny. That blood's destiny.</br>  <br>This, Kakyoin, is my world.</br>  <br>Good thing he gave me his phone number, I'll text him real quick<br><br><br>I never actually thought of it like that, huh. <br>Also you should leave before you get spoiled<br><br><br>When DIO died I think that's when Josuke had his illness which gave him his stand, so I think there must be some connection.<br><br><br>SONO CHI NO SADAME<br><br><br>what are you taking<br><br><br>I don't know I kind of like Gappy's quirkiness we'll see as the part 8 continues<br><br><br>lel<br><br> Probably some combination of both? I never thought of it as the person rejecting the stand</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Diavolo finally revealing himself<br> no matter what you think about part 5, don't say that you didn't expect shit to go down when he from nowhere appeared behind the pillar</br></br>  <br>Fevers are a sign of the body rejecting viruses.</br>  <br>real hero of part 5</br>  <br>But I remember Avdol saying something about stands rejecting their users</br>  Hi I'm Hirohiko Araki.<br>The World is Jotaro's stand, and Star Platinum is DIO's, that explains why Star Platinum looks like Kars, it's because DIO has vampire blood from a mask made by Kars, that also explains why The World looks like Crazy Diamond. DIO's Hermit Purple is actually Joseph's Hermit Purple. The reason why Diego has The World and not Star Platinum is because Pucci killed Star Platinum.</br>  <br> Punished Polnareff <br>Don't you mean<br> Roly-Pol </br></br></br>  <br>Idiot everyone knows Star Platinum is the spirit of Bruford protecting Jonathan's descendent.</br>  <br> tfw Diavolo looked cooler as a dark silhouette </br>  <br>That would be cool if stands were actually deceased spirits. Shit, I can sense arguments approaching</br>  <br>That's always been my view on it, not with ALL Stands but at least with Star Platinum.<br><br>Also I've always connected Crazy Diamond looking like The World because of the DIO blood in Joseph at the end of Stardust Crusaders. Ehh.</br></br></br>  <br>The beginning of C-moon</br>  <br>One of the better moments of Part 5, yeah.<br>Where'd you get that coloured scan though?</br></br>  <br>i saved it from a thread loooooooooong ago</br>  <br>Yeah, thank god it became an alt. costume in ASB.</br>  <br>Yeah that's actually what I thought about too with the Joseph/Dio's blood Crazy Diamonds healing capabilities but there's no real way to argue for it.<br>I like thinking that Bruford's spirit aided the Joestars though</br></br>  part 3 blurays when<br><br>and will it be better QUALITY? or just uncensored</br></br>  <br>When Gappy is shown to have 4 balls because he's  twice the man you'll ever be </br>  <br><br>was the silhouette just how he appeared to look since he fought against bruno in a dark room, and the fight was from bruno's pov after all</br></br>  <br>I'd say both  I hope </br>  <br>can someone please post kiochi DIO from the anime<br><br>or just a dump of quality shots</br></br></br>  <br>But anon, Kiochi looks just like DIO</br>  Will Araki ever bring back Santana as a villian?  <br><br>isn't santana stuck in an air vent somewhere in a nazi laboratory</br></br>  <br>he was in the posession of the SPW foundation in a chamber where he is constantly being exposed to UV rays</br>  <br>Much like Kars, he's half alive in stone form to prevent himself from being killed by intense UV lights in a speedwagon lab.</br>  <br>Araki said he ran out of ideas for hamon<br><br>He had already bumped josephs power level to the max<br>With stands he could get more creative<br>I just wish joseph hadn't forgotten he was insanely powerful<br>If it had ended with him that would be fine but he was still kicking around being useledx</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The pillar men were the best antagonists.<br>Batttle tendency in general is the best arc.</br>  <br>nah, not even close.</br>  <br><br>I like the direction he took with the spin. I felt like that was an acceptable hamon replacement, and it was fun as fuck</br></br>  <br>He lived in america the rest of his life after part 2, how the fuck is he not American? Dunno what shithole you live in but that's how it works here in freedomland bruh</br>  What is your stands name /a/?  <br>Does Araki have a Josuke factory somewhere? There must be at least four of them running around at the moment.  I want to claim one for a husbando. </br>  I'm glad I started watching the anime. Currently working my way through stardust crusaders. I wish I got into this series sooner.  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I hope you read the manga cause you're gonna get a lot of spoilers now :(</br>  <br>if you're animeonly, maybe.<br><br>otherwise SBR takes the napkin by far</br></br></br>  <br>that's cool m8  but why you go read the manga? </br>  <br>I think Suburbia by the Pet Shop Boys would also seem like a good fit, but the only ED I want for any part would be Part V getting Gold by Spandau Ballet.</br>    <br>that's cool, but you should color the blood</br>  <br><br>Kira a best Jojo Antagonist</br></br>  <br>I like this page a lot more in the variant where Josuke's speech bubbles read [Call out...] [...your Killer Queen!]<br><br>It's a tiny change that adds a lot of emotion to the scene in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>i didn't color this</br>  <br>Don't worry, he will once he's finished with the anime. That's cus he knows he'll die before anything past Part 5 gets animated<br><br>I wonder if Santana stopped thinking though.<br><br>I'd like to think that the Part 8 universe had pillarmen a long while back but they bred with humans and that's how those weird rock people came about</br></br></br></br></br>   Petshop's stand is ice based because Dio had them too <br><br>Maybe I should reread PB since I keep forgetting Dio had powers other than The World once.</br></br>  <br>Ackey Dackey<br>Ese Dese, Holmes</br></br>  <br>Aisey Daisy</br>   That latest chapter released this week <br><br>JoJolion is by far the most bizarre storyline so far.</br></br>  <br>I don' think you know what you're talking about</br>  <br><br>I'm gonna finish the stardust crusaders anime first then I'm moving on to diamond is unbreakable. Natural progression pretty much.<br>Speaking of which, will there be an anime adaption of diamond is unbreakable onwards?</br></br></br>  <br>It's unsure yet, we'll get the answer in 6 months or something. You should really leave before spoilers</br>   Pucci yells words at a baby <br> Pulls a finger out of his hand and gives it to the baby <br> Baby eats his arm <br> ????? <br> Next time we see Pucci he has both arms and his facial hair got worse <br><br>How does Green Baby even work.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Green baby contained the seed of MiH and Dio's stolen joestar blood<br><br>Pucci got rebuilt with a new stand and a star birthmark<br><br>it looked like that because Araki has a weird gore fetish starting around mid part 5</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it like physical stand made out of DIO so that his loyal follower (Gay Priest) could achieve heaven (how did DIO even know the way to heaven, I mean seriously how the fuck).<br><br>Though I honestly have no recollection of what difference the green baby meant for achieving heaven if Gay Priest already had Jotaro's memories.</br></br></br>  <br>I also would like to join. "we sell rakes... only rakes."</br>  <br>How did he get rebuilt though, because later on he was talking about how green baby was inside of him. So did GB eat him entirely, did GB become his arm, did GB get sucked inside him in a Kars kinda way, etc.</br>  <br> it just works </br>  2OP    <br>He needed Jotaro's memories so he could get the secret password that would make green baby fuse with him so he could get C-Moon.</br>  <br> dib iz my wold kakyoin </br>  <br>How do people make these things?</br>  Is this canon? Like, did Araki design it like he did Midler?  how long until the dub panel  <br>Yeah but that's the thing. Fusing with green baby shouldn't give Gay Priest C-Moon. It's merely physical change, his spirit remained the same shit. Should have just used the fucking arrow instead of this gay ass DIO kabbalah.</br>  <br>But he had whitesnake even after fusing with the baby, it wasn't unil he reached the space center that he gained C-Moon</br>  <br>Nothing like the green baby has appeared in all of JJBA outside stone ocean. The arrow would have made no sense at all for this particular change (whitesnake requiem would be something very different from C-Moon.)</br>  <br>Green baby was another version of the arrow<br>  spoopy </br></br>  Was Diavolo a good parent at first?  <br>Magic</br>  <br>no, he was a deadbeat dad</br>  <br>He didn't even knew that Trish existed before Donatella's death.</br>  <br>He was basically in pain between green baby and the space center and had issues controlling his power, like with the mom and the baby, so I guess it was like someone getting their stand for the first time and he had to get used to it.</br>  Is there a chance we might see something else at the dub panel? maybe EoH gameplay or someting like that?  <br><br><br>So much for Italians being all about family.</br></br></br>  <br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W1ayLLI6LCA<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br>I've taken...some heavy damage...</br></br>  <br> 6 hours and 46 minutes ago <br>MENACING</br></br>  <br>YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH ABOUT OUR CULTURE<br>YOU COCKSUCKER</br></br>  <br>Nice nose.</br>  <br>Whoah,what's happening?</br>  <br> I swear I could see him move inside the frozen time...

I dislike the Oingo Boingo change, it's pisses me off. I'm still confused why it had to be done, after all they did say Oingo/Boingo in the show, it was just the subtitles that had to be changed.

Santana ignored Jojo and Speedwagon, Wamuu only killed people who he felt would lead to an honorable battle, he even said to Ceaser that he shouldn't try fighting Wammu, It's only going to end your short life. He even had a rule about not killing kids.<br>Kars also said he didn't like fighting women, and he only killed two innocent people, but they were drunks whoalmost hit an innocent dog.<br><br>The hamon users were just afraid of the pillar men, and thought they were evil due to how they fed and the stone masks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying video games are canon </br>  <br>We know it's Battle Tendency too, it's the entire first season which is the first 2 parts.</br>  <br>https://twitter.com/NerdGirlSabrina<wbr>/status/617074335220547584?autoplay<wbr>=true<br>habbening</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> $50 for 26 episodes <br>I really doubt it.Season could mean part.</br></br>  <br> Diego <br> SBR <br> Videogame <br>Hey there animeonly</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's season one, we already know who's voicing Joseph</br></br>  short clip <br>https://twitter.com/DemiFiendRSA/st<wbr>atus/617075771148873728</wbr></br>  <br>Yeah, it looks like they're showing the episodes first.<br><br><br>No, it means season, otherwise why are they both on the cover?

They're late today. I already started watching it on Funimation anyways.</br>  <br><br>Subs where out an hour ago faggot.<br><br><br><br> They're late today <br>No, they weren't.  You don't know where else to look apart from Nyaa. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I already started watching it on Funimation anyways. <br>Was the dub out yet</br></br>  <br>for episode 6 "over the obento" yes.<br>and it was great.</br></br>  <br>wait, they actually brought the original cast for the dub too? cause if so I smell something big coming.</br>  RIP Haruhifags. I'm sure today's episode will give you a heart attack.    <br>Yes, they got the original cast for the dub, but the dub episodes are a few episodes behind the release of the sub episodes. It's great to hear Freeman and Wendee Lee and Kari Wahlgren again. I laughed way more on today's episode of the dub than what I did watching in Japanese the first time.</br>    Hello yes this is John Smith here to save the day.    <br> Two Nagatos One Bed </br>  That overbearing melancholy in the last part  Tsunderes going full dere. Does it ruin them for you anons? Does it make them better? Do you prefer a middle ground where she still has those tsundere moments but also acts more dere?<br><br>What is the fastest you've seen this transition happen?</br></br>  Yes. The second. I guess I don't love tsundere but I don't hate them.  Worst dere transition I've seen.<br><br> badass and dependable big sister figure in Railgun <br> retarded and annoying moeblob whenever Touma is around her in Index </br></br></br>  I want this bitch to go dere so bad.  I prefer tsunderes that aren't shit.  <br>She's so cute</br>  <br> https://archive.moe/a/search/filen<wbr>ame/tsundere%20expanded.jpg/</wbr> <br><br>Never a rest huh, THK.</br></br></br>  <br>Ratio and the transition itself doesn't matter. I'm fine with anything. What's important is how cute and lovable the tsundere in relation to their overall personality and character arc.<br><br><br>That isn't a tsun to dere transition, you retard. Also fuck you Misaka is cute and a great tsundere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How else would you call it, then? Just switching back and forth between tsun and dere?</br>  There is nothing better than tsundere trying to be tsun, but MC seeing right though her.  <br>She isn't tsun to her friends, idiot. You're missing first half of the equation.</br>  <br>She sadly isn't a well developed tsundere, so she goes back to being tsun at the drop of a hat, many times just for dumb comedy. A tsundere doesn't need to regress to be funny.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter. She's only like that with Touma.</br>  <br> shitty <br> taiga <br><br>m8 r u srs<br><br>ToraDora! is a masterpiece.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma has a way of bringing out the mouth-breathing retard in everyone he comes across. Biri's not special in this regard.</br>  <br> developed <br>Wrong. She is still developing. She barely is tsun in NT. She realized her feelings in OT and knows what she wants, but she doesn't know how to express her feelings yet, and as a result we get interactions that are similar to standoffish comedy approach, but they lack a certain hostility compared to before she realized her feelings. Not able to express them doesn't equal tsun, you know, so there is a difference. <br><br><br>No shit, Sherlock. She wouldn't be tsundere if didn't act different and like a tsundere. She's a pure-minded girl with a childish heart. Getting embarrassed, flustering, and temperamental is part of her tsundere. It contrasts with her more serious and dependable side. Gap moe is one of the main appeals for a tsundere, and that is a good thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doing a 180 and turning into a stuttering and flustered moeblob when Touma is around her doesn't make for good contrast. The pool scene in Index II was so retarded it hurt.</br>  <br> pool <br>pole*</br></br>  <br>Your opinion and it isn't even close to being accurate in describing how she acts to Touma when she goes girly.</br>  <br>The greatest romantic story of our time.</br>  <br> not accurate </br>  <br>Cute flustering or embarrassment != retarded moeblob. Know the difference, it can save your life.</br>  Do you best,/a/.  <br>  Why are you making a thread for other people? you only need my posts... </br>  <br>I hope he rapes more bitches in the next timeline.</br>  <br><br>How many chapters is this currently at again?

Would you consider Yandere characters to be dead as a person?  <br>Why only 10 seconds anon? You don't believe that I Iike you? Why do I have to be yandere anyway? You think I don't like you enough? Why do you hate me so much anon? Why? Why do you make a thread to ask people to be yandere for you? Am I not enough? Why anon? Why?</br>    <br>Why would I be yandere for you? You aren't my waifu. I don't love you.</br>  <br>Yandere characters are mostly plot devices that move the story forward by giving a catalyst for other characters through their insanity.<br><br>Very rarely does an author/mangaka ever make a yandere with a personality of her own outside of "I want to fuck/kill x character" and it shows in how flat and unappealing the majority of them are when they aren't doing their yan things.<br><br>I wish there was a yandere character with wishes and aspirations and a background that didn't involve daddy raping them and then calling them a slut. A character that doesn't fall in love with the protag because "He's the first person to ever smile at me!" or some other retarded shit that makes it so that the love itself is shallow. <br><br>but they make my peepee hard and that's all that really matters anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no way that VA isn't at least a little bit crazy IRL, holy shit.<br><br> My dick is diamonds. </br></br></br>         A yandere will never stalk you home from work <br> She will never break into your house while you're away and sniff your dirty clothes while masturbating <br> She will never meticulously write and rewrite a thousand letters for you and send them on time every morning <br> She will never shower you in gifts while watching from a safe distance <br> She will never drug you and then hump your sleeping body until she cums  <br> She will never wear a disguise just to talk to you and then run away when she turns red like a turnip <br> She will never cry tears of uncontrollable joy when you ask her out  <br> She will never be a loving doting girlfriend who does anything in her power to make you happy <br> She will never suddenly turn quiet and somber when she sees a girl called your phone <br> You will never wake up tied to a chair with her tired eyes set on you like a tiger <br> She will never rape you for hours while repeatedly screaming that you belong to each other and that she'll never let you leave <br> She will never slowly revert to loving waifu form after a few days <br> You will never purposely make her jealous and watch her bury you in rape and desperation </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When did I say you could leave?  any good yanderes in anime besides Yuno and Kurumi?  <br>But anon, why would you need anyone but Yuno in your anime. Yuno is all you need, you don't need anyone else.</br>  Where are you running? I'm not letting any of those other clocks have your time. You're my food only. Now come to your wife and shower her with love. <br>GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW OR THIS RAPE WILL BECOME MURDRER!</br>  <br>Yuno a shit.

Her distinctly clumsy female writing, but the obvious effort stand out. <br><br>Around the outside, there's some of her more common animal doodles; an awkward looking giraffe, a couple of cats, and something you've always assumed was a deer. <br><br>There's some smaller writing around the outside, but you've stopped looking to take off your shoes.<br><br>Just as you finish taking them off, you sense her eyes on you.

She is unnecessary and irrelevant and should just die. <br>Why? Iroha is a side character. Complaining against her is like complaining against that Finn fujoshi or Saki.</br></br>    <br>i wish she would show expressions like that....</br>  <br>Side characters should stay out of the club room when they don't have problems. Iroha hangs around like she belongs there.</br>    <br>well mayb she did want to join but couldn't cuz she was already manager at football club and a seitou fucking kaichou!!!!</br>    <br>I think one of the reasons I like Iroha is because she inspires so much anger from faggots. It's hilarious. I think I'm German at heart.</br>  <br>Even if she wants to join, this is haremshit and she is interested in the bishounen character and not the main character. People who like Iroha are cucks, and not in the good sense like reading NTR manga/doujins.</br>      <br>It's not Iroha who inspires anger, it's Irohafags.<br><br>Most people don't mind her one bit, but the retards who constantly screech about her have driven the rest of the fanbase, including a significant portion of her own fags, up a wall.</br></br></br>      <br>You should be dumping in the other thread. This one's too much of a shithole to be worth saving.</br>  <br>didn't notice the other one<br> see ya, nerds </br></br>  <br> she is interested in the bishounen character <br>Assumptions<br> not the main character <br>again??<br> People who like Iroha are cucks, and not in the good sense. <br>There's just no limit to you autism...<br>Low IQ, jumps to conclusions, believes delusional shit, overconfidence.....You are not worthy for a discussion.<br><br>GO DIE.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>BITCH!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I sure feel like I'm missing out by not having a discussion with an Irohafag.

There's no way a volume can solve so many unresolved conflicts</br></br>  So I have these theories about Iroha an Yukino. <br><br>Iroha likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.<br><br>I suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.<br><br>Does anyone have any theories on Yui?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ie why there won't be time to develop the romance if it does end. at best yukino and hikki's problems end up coinciding.<br><br>Hopeful for more though since vol 11 afterword suggests vol 12 is the climax, not the finale.</br></br></br>  <br> Watari won't follow Yomi's path and make Hachiman fal in love with Totsuka <br> "Ah, um, okay." <br> The end <br>Moreover, this is a light novel, even if it does conclude at twelve, expect asspulls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui is secretly a lesbian and only using 8man as a pretext to get closer to Yukino.</br>  <br>This is not a Fate thread.</br>  <br>Excuse me, Yui doesn't have any problem with a harem. Yukino will be her wife and 8man her mistress.</br>  Why are you Oregairufags still around? Your poor man's Haganai is over. <br><br>Totsuka will win, like Yukimura.</br></br>  <br>so its bisexual instead of lesbian. Sasuga Yuigahara-san.</br>  <br><br> 122,607 copies Vol.11  <br> 12k BD volume 1 <br> Ending at Vol. 12 <br><br>It's like you guys don't know how this industry works</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> 8man her mistress </br>  <br>Abnormally shit taste.</br>  <br>No, I don't think you know. At best, the 13th novel is the final volume but purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes.</br>  Only way irohafags can stay relevant is spamming a thread everyday after the show ends. Pathetic.  <br>I don't know why there are so many people obsessed with their ship's more popular than others, it's a fucking taiwanese cartoon character's romance for fuck's sake; the fact that it came from Facebook isn't helping it either</br>  <br>Did they realize they are not /u/ enough to ship? Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right?</br>   have a 11/10 gorgeous long, black haired girl that loves you <br> have a very cute and very sweet girl who has a 10/10 body that loves you <br> they accept who you are <br> they are friends so no drama if you choose on over the other <br> people keep acting like this is a bad thing <br>8man has it made. There is no way this can go wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pretty sure only /a/ knows the LN spoilers right? <br>As if people care<br><br>/u/fags secured their foothold in /a/, even more than /v/ did.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people like Yui? I'm honestly asking. Is it that she sympathizes with 8man? Her tits?  <br>Why would you dislike Yui?<br>No autism, no pretense, only lack of spine at worst.</br></br>  <br> Her tits? <br><br>you just answer it yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>dumb and easier to put the penis in  theoretically  if you were self-inserting</br>  <br>If there's someone who can fuck it up, it's 8man.</br>  <br>It's not that I dislike her. I just don't see much appeal in her aside from her ti- character design. But I see so many people praising her as best girl. Which confuses me despite me being aware of this board's shit taste.</br>  <br><br><br>i'm normally one for dfc i just like how genki she is</br></br></br>  <br> purportedly Watari's contract stated 12 volumes. <br>You don't even know the exact terms of their agreement or the possibility of its extension. Saying that this ends at volume 12 is just dumb</br></br>  <br>That's why i asked the reason why their rank keep down though. Oh well i filtered most /u/ related thread anyway, it's amazing to see my catalog page looks so empty these days.</br>  <br><br>This is exactly how I feel except about Yukino.<br><br>She's just such a boring, derivative, generic character. It is utterly baffling to me that someone could  genuinely  prefer her to a more interesting girl like Iroha or even one of the side girls. And yet apparently she has multiple people who think she's the best girl. So fucking confusing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Liking Yui is not a shit taste<br><br>Liking Whoruno on the other hand, is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel the same. Which is why I prefer Iroha and Sensei.</br>  <br>She is a good girl. She is more loving and accepting than most of the heroines I have seen in chinese cartoons. <br><br><br>The only way he can screw it up is by not making a decision or rejecting both in a hurtful manner.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is a side girl </br>  <br> le meme bait </br>    Well? No Yuiposting?<br>Are the YuiBros dead?</br>  <br>Don't know about the others but I became a Yuikinofag before S1 aired because of Yukino &amp; 8man's 'Hachiman points' banter in volume 4</br>  <br>Yes, I am alive. I might be the only one.</br>  <br>I have a feeling you were baiting, but I will bite.<br><br>Normally the strong, smart, independent girl like Yukino is my type of heroine (okay, the "strong" and "independent" parts are in question for now, but that was how she was in first half). Yui only has her genki character to go with - that was my impression on the first volume.<br><br>Eventually, though, seeing her continuously chase after 8man even with all the suffering she got just kind of moved me. Effort should be rewarded - that kind of feeling. Add in the revelations how she is kind to everyone, put a lot of effort into stabilizing the club, always gently &amp; lovingly support 8man and even willing to sacrifice her chance to help her friend and I jumped on her ship. How could anyone want such a sweet girl to suffer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'm still here.</br></br></br>  <br>They were killed in the last thread</br>  <br>Sure thing m8, you keep believing that.</br>  <br>Still here.<br>Not going to fall for the low quality bait.</br></br>  <br>Speak and I shall heed the call.</br>  <br> all this normie bait <br><br>well at least Iroha is good for something</br></br></br>  Irohasu~   Yuifags <br><br> mature grown-up looking for a stable and peaceful relationship <br> sympathetic <br> pacifist - hence the least amount of shit posting <br> passive <br> attracted to a character for her personality rather than looks <br> in touch with their inner feeling - hence many Yuifags use art as a medium to express themselves.

Yet, as Hiratsuka told Hachiman<br> It really doesn’t have to be you. Someday, Yukinoshita will change and she might even meet someone that can understand her. There might be someone who can take the extra step for her. The same could be said of Yuigahama as well. <br><br>Their friendship is debatable. If you want to firmly believe the themes of Oregairu, then their friendship will remain intact. If you want to opt for something realistic, then no. Love triangles never come out unscathed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WB9<wbr>SL-mZtVY</wbr>  [ ]</br>   Iroha tells in front of the Service Club (8man) her birthday is in April 16th <br> A month later 8man remembers her birthday <br> Yui doesn't remember <br> Yukino, top student, doesn't remember either and asks 8man why did he know that <br><br>Stop trying to deny it so hard Senpai</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll still hurt, just not as much as before.<br><br><br>Some time after the "genuine" it looks Hikki was trying to be that "someone" actively trying to understand her more than before.<br><br><br>Remember Hikki has a good memory for these things, people think of it as creepy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part are his monologues during the volume.

Hopefully it turns her off completely. <br><br>If she brings it up he will feign ignorance and if she pushes it he says that it isn't his and that it is probably a prank.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no, 8man will just go on a date with her and kindly say that she is not his type.

Guys, I had a sex dream last night. The girl wasn't anyone I knew but she looked suspiciously like a 3D version of Iroha.

When she uneasily removed her boots with her hands, I could tell the fineness of her calves through her tights. <br> I ended up directing my gaze towards her seemingly immature gestures. When our eyes met, she bended her head to side with a “What is it?” But there’s no way I could tell her that I was taken in her by the unbalanced qualities between her alluring charm and her childish behavior, so I shook my head and quietly handed her a racket. <br><br>While this is probably just a bait post, as expected of Satan, it's always nice getting a chance to quote this part.

It really wouldn’t disappear. <br><br> Undoubtedly, there was always something I had mistaken and I would continue to live on with that feeling of anxiety. <br><br> That’s why regardless of what I did, the feelings of guilt would find its way back. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Guys this has become pretty sad. Just let it die out.  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51218188<br>HOnMOno</br></wbr>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Useless slut only good for her sex appeal.<br> Just like Iroha, minus the sex appeal. <br> Yukino da bess </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yukinofags, staying just as classy as always.</br></br>  Bijin  <br> “That can’t be right. Why the heck do things have to be that way? It makes no sense,” Yuigahama said, her voice trembling. Compared to the two of us who were logically satisfied, she judged it otherwise without a single reason. </br>  <br>Of coursh!</br>  <br>You wanna go?!</br>  <br> Again, Yuigahama pulled my hand along. It wasn’t as strong as the pull from earlier. It was a frailty that was trying to confirm and test something. I was sure even Yuigahama didn’t know what to do either. With our hands still together, she looked up at my face anxiously. <br><br> That’s why I gently brushed her hands away. <br><br> From that, Yuigahama’s hands dropped weakly and her face was about to burst into tears. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why even people who don't GAF about the shipping or romance subplot want Yukino to lose</br>  <br><br> it couldn't possibly be a falseflagger! </br></br>  <br> “Okay Hikki, let’s get going.” <br> “Yeah.” <br><br> We descended down the stairs and when we turned around the corner, the darkness enveloped us. When we advanced several steps, the light completely dispersed from our field of vision. <br> Regardless of whether we closed or opened our eyes, the deep darkness wasn’t going to change. This was the extent of the darkness of the abyss. As we inched forward making step by step progress, we’d make sure there was land to be walking on with our feet and if you were to look at this from the side, you’d get the impression that we were imitating penguins. <br><br> For the sense of sight that we lose, another organ would do its part and compensate for it by becoming even sharper. <br><br>Reminder that 8man was thinking of him and Yui as penguins and even gotten a boner out of it all the way back in Vol. 7.<br><br> Or so I wish ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My chest thumped from the sudden appearance of a figure and I suppressed it. The person in front of me was Yuigahama Yui and her expression was stiff as well, stumbling with her words. <br><br> “…Ah, Hikki.” </br></br></br>  <br> Yuigahama said she wanted everything <br> she just wanted to take things from me <br> I was just a proxy for Hikigaya <br> he didn't save me <br> his genuine was just yuigahama <br> nobody ever wanted me </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> flaseflagging <br><br>The go-to excuse for Yukinofags' shitty behavior. I used to buy it but over time it's become apparent that most of them really are that bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Heh.</br>    <br>I still miss the old 8man.</br>    <br>Uhuh, if this guy were an actual Yukinofag, he'd insult Yui and Iroha, but not attach Yukino's face to it. If said person actually cared about Yukino he wouldn't try to lightningrod hatred towards her, when there's already a shit ton of people that already hate her. The majority of the people remaining here are Irohafags. A good chunk of the Irohafags hate Yukino. You do the math.</br>  <br>You should know by now if It's a Yukinofag the response usually passive aggressive as fuck, only false flaggers directly insult them.</br>            <br>Is this what is gonna happen when 8man finds something genuine and it isn't her?</br>    <br><br> What, I finally became the genuine he wanted <br> Why is he looking away <br> why isn't he embracing me <br> he was lying just to get at me wasn't he <br> and so was Yuigahama <br> why did I trust those people <br> everyone just tries to get close to me to hurt me <br> mom take me away </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Ponkan8 really improved, his drawing were generic garbage back in the first volumes</br>  <br>Genuine things don't exist.</br>  <br> &gt;For the sense of sight that we lose, another organ would do its part and compensate for it by becoming even sharper. <br>He got a boner?</br></br>  <br>I think it's a double meaning there</br>  <br>Nigga 4-6 art is gorgeous</br>  <br>A double boner?

God Cloth VS God Cloth<br><br> With the 7 chambers as the stage, the all-out battle between Gold Saints and God Warriors has finally started. <br> Taurus Aldebaran goes up against the God Warrior Hercules, whom he has fought before. <br> Hercules has become extremely violent from the power of the Odin Sapphire given to him by Andreas. <br> Hercules unleashes a vicious attack, but Aldebaran, after discovering “true strength,” responds with an even greater power. <br> Meanwhile, in the Ice Chamber, a battle of Gold Saints between Shura and Camus has begun. <br> Both men hold their ground, until an extreme battle unfolds from the transformation into God Cloth. <br> Then, AFTER the battle against Miro and Shura, Camus realizes HIS TRUE FEELINGS for God Warrior Surtr, who was his friend. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will Shura die?<br><br>Also<br> Then, AFTER the battle against Miro and Shura, Camus realizes HIS TRUE FEELINGS for God Warrior Surtr, who was his friend. <br>This looks a bit gay tbh</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, <br> apparently he gives an emotive speech about Shura. According to spoilers  </br></br>  <br>Saint Seiya should be gayer than that.</br>  <br>I wonder if there will be another libra temple scene with Camus and Shura.</br>     miro isn't really kil <br>uwutm8?</br>  <br>And what is the thing Andreas has in his special room?</br>  <br> Will Shura die? <br>Yes<br>The only Gold Saints standing will be Aiolia,  Mu, Dohko and Saga :^) </br></br></br>  is this shit canon?  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>No  or yes if Utgard is really Titan </br>  <br>toei canon<br><br><br> implying DM isn't protected by the power of love </br></br></br></br>  Biweekly reminder that Utgard is really Kanon,  he  looks the same from behind.<br>Only forget the details about muh height and hair/eyes color.</br>  <br>Sounds gay but Toei is making a mistake if it's Shura the one who's going to make Camus realize his TRUE FEELINGS. <br>Fujos are very defensive of their Camus x Milo OTP.</br></br>  <br> muh hair eyes color <br>Dye and contacts.<br> muh height <br>I don't know, man.<br>Unless he's using one of his illusions all the time, I don't see it happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  Episode now available. Waiting the [HorribleSubs] version   <br>ITS  late  TIME!!<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=download&amp;t<wbr>id=707480</wbr></br></br>  <br>Toei is trying to rewrite everyone's decade old OTPs. CamusxShura, DMxMu if the spoilers about him saving him are accurate.</br>  <br>There was hand holding with Camus and Surt if that counts.</br>  Ayy<br><br> June 9th </br></br>  <br>Eh? That wasn't so bad, I'm impressed.</br>  Not sure how I feel about Camus legitimately being a traitor, his characterization in this show is all off. I got all excited too when he talked about a sword of ice, but he was just talking about Aurora Execution, and not a new move. Oh well.  Those God Warriors have no chance against the Golds, this is a pretty underwhelming.  <br>Hopefully the bit about Baldr being an actual god will make next episode's fight more interesting.</br>  <br><br>Yea, Aldebaran embarrassed Hercules without even fully awakening his God Cloth. I expected the power up and purple aura to actually do something, but I guess it was a fake out.<br><br>If we keep going at the rate of 2 GWs per episode, that will leave us time to face the real final bosses that come from Ygdrasil.</br></br></br></br>  why the fuck are god warriors so shit?<br>or are god cloths broken as fuck?</br>  <br><br>God warriors were always shit, now the gold saints can finally put them in their place with the debuff field turned off.</br></br>  <br>I thought the sapphires were going to make them OP as fuck but instead they are getting clowned left and right.</br>  <br>The one who translated probably thought that when he said "ken" he meant 剣 instead of 拳</br>  <br><br>I laughed my ass off when I saw that shit, how humiliating.</br></br>  OST track listing shows that Kiki is going to show up at some point soon? Maybe in a flashback?  <br> Milo and Camus have anime hair colors <br><br>STOP</br></br></br>  <br> tracks 32 and 33 <br>Kanon confirmed  or some Gemini drama </br></br>  <br><br>It's obvious that the masked GW is Kanon, he is even the personal guardian of Lyfia, the one who has revived the gold saints.</br></br>  <br>But he's so short, anon.</br>  <br>No.<br>His voice sounds nothing like Ryotaro Okiayu. <br>Just give up, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Toei is risking it. <br>DM x Aphro has been fujo's OTP for decades, making DM hetero was already a huge risk. <br>But making Camus gay for his other friend is too much. Fujos won't like it.</br></br></br>  what did Camus expect to happen after he defeated/he was beaten by Shura?  He is so broken by Shura getting killed   what happened to Lufia? <br><br>My poor waifu of the season.</br></br>  <br>It makes you wonder if someone at the writing desk is pushing their own OTPs.</br>  <br>Is Shijima in front of comatose Seiya?<br>Anyway, best SS news in a long time</br></br>  <br>Kanon NTR'd Aioria. <br>God make that happen</br></br>  <br>she didn't turn out to be a trap god, so we lost interest.</br>  Holy shit.<br><br>3 gorudo sainto are out of the game in one episode ?<br><br> Aldebaran's get captured was bullshit. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it appears that Shijima somehow ends up in present day sanctuary, and witnesses the gold sacrifice themselves to the wailing wall. Whether he's actually in the present or just projecting his soul remains to be seen.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure everyone will be captured as soon as they clear their respective rooms.<br><br>So there are 2 rooms left and 3 golds wandering around and one M.I.A. , but only ONE God warrior left without a pair, how the hell will this play out?</br></br></br>  <br> He didn't job at all, so thats a win. </br>  <br>Yeah, big win for the taurus fans but they had no reason to get him captured other than easy plot progression.</br>  <br>Mu and Dohko have to survive if they're going to do the Athena Exclamation like in the OP.</br>  <br>Totally agree</br>  Shaka was looking extra moe in this episode.  <br>Aldebaran was out of fucks to give this episode.</br>    Why do you keep reminding me of better things Soul of Gold? <br>Is some sort of masochism?</br>  I like the implication that Mu's been spending this entire time just continually psychic bitchsmacking Fafner.  <br>Araki-sensei ;w;</br>  <br><br> Not even the crotch shot is good <br>Sometimes I wonder why do I keep watching this.</br></br></br>  <br>can't wair for next episode when Shaka will confirm he can kill Gods no problem</br>  <br>Why? What's the traduction?<br><br>I really hope the masked GW is not kanon</br></br></br>  <br>Shura looks like as in the SoG version.</br>  <br>Meaty looking thighs there, Camus.</br>  The thing i like about this ep the most aside from Camus action<br><br> God Warriors: WE ARE STRONGER NOW CAUSE OF ODIN SAPPHIRES <br> Gold Saints: Okay <br><br>and then they proceed to knock the God Warriors into a wall</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is implied that otherwise Gold Saint wouldn't even have a problem destroying most of the God Warriors. They seem to be slightly above a Silver Saint in power, maybe in equality to a Marine.<br>On the other hand, Andreas look upset about losing the statues, isn't that part of his plan?</br></br>  <br>who is the seiyu of masked guy in hell chamber? he seems a lot like Aiolos</br>  <br>I think Andreas is just in it for the shits and giggles at this point. He probably has bets going on each fight match-up.</br>  <br>Not Aiolos, i meant to say Seiya</br>  why is this show so terrible? the original series was gay as fuck but it certainly didn't suffer this much of QUALITY  <br>nah i dont doubt that the God Warriors arent close to Gold level but it was still hilarious</br>  <br> The thing i like about this ep the most aside from Camus action <br><br> &gt;God Warriors: WE ARE STRONGER NOW CAUSE OF ODIN SAPPHIRES <br> &gt;Gold Saints: Okay <br><br> and then they proceed to knock the God Warriors into a wall <br><br>And then we got a shit episode because it ain't about having good fights but just muh constellations</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The original series quality vary depending on the studio animating that week. But it had something SoG truly lack, and that's a good director.<br>Seriously, the general directing is as so basic and plain is boring.</br></br>  <br>Because that's the future of anime.</br>  <br>Especially as the moefags take over and anime gets more and more niche. Looking forward to a future of nicovideo streaming exclusives.</br>  <br>Did you truly expect it to be anything else, anon.</br>  <br>this am just waiting for the faggot to start a drinking game that correlates with how many people die in a chamber.</br>  <br>The twist is he's been broadcasting the fights all this time to an international audience and the GW are dying for nothing. It was all a moneymaking scam.</br>   tfw Shura and Camus not working together to defeat Surtr    still no best saint kicking ass   <br> Abel movie  <br>God damn this one was amazing.<br><br>Too bad it was rendered non canon by what Camus said in this episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br> movies <br> canon </br></br>  <br>so Andreas is Toei?</br>  <br>And suddenly the pieces fall into place.</br>   Milo gets NTR'd again <br> even after he's dead <br>Suffering</br></br>  <br>I know, DM is taking his time.</br>  <br>So, Boueibu 2.0?</br>  <br>Can't wait to see the shitty adaptation of the shitty next dimension<br><br>So bad it's good</br></br></br>  <br>Shaka is on next week</br>  <br><br>Guys ...</br></br>  <br><br><br> best saint <br> not Mu <br> not even Lemurian <br><br>Plebs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>My African American brother<br><br>What happened to him in the end?</br></br></br>  <br>The original NTRer of Aioria.</br>  <br> Mu <br> the gold saint of please keep walking and kill Taurus. </br></br>   shaka has to fight an OP god warrior <br>Welp, now I'm really starting to believe the chink spoilers.<br><br><br>For those who don't know  They say Shaka is going to lose his fight </br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess Cancer has to save his ass.</br>  <br>Chinese spoilers say Fafner's going to almost take him down, then DM steps in and saves him while dying himself.</br>  <br>Preparing the tissues then<br><br>Or at least I hope it's better than this Camus bullshit. It was so boring.</br></br></br>  <br>He's the best at other things...<br><br>like capturing all of our hearts.</br></br></br>  <br>Saga is closer. And dear lord, that would the best team in the history of Saint seiya.</br>  <br> What happened to him in the end? <br>Mu is dead  or maybe not <br>But it could be a good opportunity for DM. He could to avenge Helena.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell us more about those chinese spoilers, anon! Also, today's episode was entertaining</br>  <br>You mean avenge his foreverhusband Aphrodite.</br>  <br>Baldr defeating Shaka was from the same source.</br>  <br>:3</br>  WE GOD WARRIORS NOW<br><br>SEPTEMBER 25th WORLDWIDE RELEASE<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VnT<wbr>T8eVzlw8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>    <br>yeah lookin good.<br><br>needs mermaid chick to be playable too though</br></br></br>  <br>But why another fighting game.

It was woefully cut short.</br>  <br>Of course anon, more beautiful equals more power.</br>  <br>That means he was rejected by a Cancer girl/boy.</br>  <br>Story was he dated a Pisces who left him for a Cancer. Also that Shaka was designed after an old girlfriend.</br>  <br> Just put the gold saints in dresses, half of them already look like girls. <br>Agree</br></br>  <br>He's such a nerd, also he draws worse than Oda.</br>  <br>Oda has an artstyle, he is not bad at drawing.</br>  <br> this is what piss drinkers believe </br>  <br/>  <br>Soul of Gold could have been so different.</br>  <br><br>He can draw anything he wants and knows many styles, you can see it in the artist's portrait.</br></br>    <br>http://es.onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/N<wbr>otas_del_autor<br><br>In Spanich for you spic.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>What a waste. I hate Seiya</br>  <br> You'll never see cute Gold Saints doing cute things </br>  <br> Not even Furuya as Seiya. <br>SHITSHITSHIT</br></br>    <br>The real tragedy here.

I feel empty.</br>  <br>Oh, you know<br><br>just "humor me... oh, right, same old same old"</br></br></br>  Good night sweet Prince, you were too good for this shitty anime.  <br>  nose shadow <br><br>wat</br></br></br>  <br>Take Shaka with you, please.</br>  <br>It seems that way.<br>Also, that would explain the "Gemini drama" here </br></br>  <br> this shitty anime <br>It hurts.</br></br>  <br>At least there was a little improvement on QUALITY this week.<br><br>A little improvement.</br></br></br>  So will Aioros get his own fight against Andreas or some end boss, or he'll just come back at the end for a team attack to take down Yggdrasil just like with the Wailing Wall?  <br>let's just remember the good time</br>  <br>Last week was downright terrible.</br>  <br>can't wait to not play this</br>  So my Latin american brothers, what the fuck is this? I have been out of the loop on Saint Seiya for a while, is this a new series with the classic Gold Saints?  If I wanted to get into Saint Seiya should I start from the first series or can I jump in anywhere?  <br>all you need to know is that deathmask is the only straight saint, thus the worst saint.  its toei milking the gold saints to show off their over designed god cloths with an ok story and tons of quality. </br>  I finally watched this movie today after putting it off for two years now.<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? <br><br> No seriously Bravo Gen BRAVO. I actually rather enjoyed this. Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG!  </br></br></br></br>  Go away  4th movie/2nd season fucking when?  <br>Dear diary today OP was not a faggot for once in his miserable life</br>    <br>But op i cant prove what is completely true. Based op for starting thread about best girl. Give me more homu!</br>  Homuhomu  <br><br>OP Here...I'll post more Homu.</br></br>  Best    <br>Beat girl. Best legs</br>  <br> while(rebellion happened?){ <br> printf("I watched Rebellion\n"); <br> printf("wtf was that\n"); <br> } <br><br>No wonder Homu gone mad in her loop. /a/ also gone mad either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    The fun of Rebellion is that there's a lot to read into, and nearly all of the stuff that doesn't seem to sense or comes out of nowhere actually has an explanation you can assemble.  Rebellion is the End of Evangelion of anime.  Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.  <br>You're a sick homusexual.</br>  Rebellion ruined homu a bit for me. While still my favorite, it made her actions seem a bit stupid and out of character. I'm not complaining since it still was entertaining  Homura is worst girl along with Sayaka. Madoka,Mami and Kyoko are best.  <br> liking Mami <br> liking useless characters <br>Ok dude.</br></br></br>  <br>low tier baito</br>  Stop asking stupid questions in the OP and post Homu.  <br>Or just simply my actual opinion? I'm not even saying anything so bad, or at least explain it to me</br>    <br>Also, please remember turning into a witch drives you insane.</br>  <br><br>Great pic. I will never undestand these faggots saying she was out of character in Rebellion.</br></br>  <br>I get it, but my point of view was only that I liked the sweet&amp;sour ending of the anime, and just her remembering madoka. But true, saying it was out of character was wrong of me</br>  <br>It wasn't out of character. Sill, before the movie was out, I was hoping Homura would undergo some character growth and get over her Madoka obsession, at least enough not to go down this path. In hindsight, it was naive to expect something like that from someone like Urobuchi.</br>  <br> spend nearly a decade trying to save someone and getting to know them <br><br>Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic. She felt as attached to her as she would to a family member. She did what she set out to do, protect Madoka and ensure that she can live a safe and happy life. I respect the hell out of her for that.</br></br></br>  <br> Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic <br>That depends on the execution, really. It wouldn't be unrealistic if handled properly.</br></br>  Daily reminder that Homura is preventing you from fucking Madoka.  <br>I find it really funny that almost every day someone finishes watching the movie and posts a thread in a very similar format to this.</br>  <br>Maybe. I'm perfectly fine with how it turned out though.</br>  Hom-Hom  Bleach 633  <br>You either can't read or you lack reading comprehension, which might as well be the same as not being able to read.
