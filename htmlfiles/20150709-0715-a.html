[  [Doki] Joukamachi no Dandelion - 01 (1280x720 Hi10P AAC) [5A37DFEE].mkv <br><br>Finally saved from the horrors of Funi.</br></br>  <br>Akane-chan a cute! CUTE!<br>This seems like it will be comfy as fuck the whole way through.<br>Kinda reminds me of Dog Days with all the superpowers that are used in game competitions and all the cuties.</br></br></br>   Doki   <br> Finally saved from the horrors of Funi. <br>Touche. Downloading.<br><br>Red and Yellow are best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to motorboat those</br>  <br>Sasuga Doki</br>  <br>Also, who the hell starts talking about stuff like this while eating?</br>  <br> Finally saved from the horrors of Funi. <br>By the horrors of Doki.</br></br>  <br>If it didn't have YuiKaori in main roles and singing the OP and ED (though just Yui in the ED), I'd have dropped this show harder than a nigger's baby.</br>  <br>Is this your first anime?</br>  <br>What makes you think that?<br>Isn't it considered crass and poor form to talk about shit and anything that surrounds it while eating?<br>Time and place, nigga. He can say it before or after. I don't need to be thinking about crap while I eat. Isn't he supposed to be a prince?<br>Also how does this work?<br>Is it to stop her from abusing her power and flooding the world with free stuff? Seems really weird to have your superpower tied to your bank account like this. What if she needed to create a giant mech to fight off Gojira but doesn't have enough funds?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What makes you think that? <br><br>Because talking with a mouthful is so goddamn common.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to fuck all three of them, starting with Aoi.</br>  Only watching this because the manga artist is amazing.  <br>looks generic as fuck</br>  <br> Because talking with a mouthful is so goddamn common. <br>I didn't mean that he talked with a mouthful, it was the topic of conversation.<br>When you think of toilet paper what comes to mind? Is it something you want to think about while you eat?</br></br></br>  <br> Doki <br>Their subs can be even more questionable compared to Funi and they drop things without making any announcement at all.</br></br>    <br>Someone who just remembered he barely made it.</br>           doki             <br>The subs are on par with funi on this, minus the typos.<br>There's also better typesetting.<br>I don't know much about Doki, but right now, they're the most polished of the two turds.</br></br></br>  <br>Subs aside, Funi is literal eyecancer.<br><br>Even if the script were the same, using a proper raw and a decent font would put them above Funi already.</br></br></br>   that one retarded group that got itself banned from nyaa <br><br>such a chore to use them.</br></br>  <br>What did they do to get banned?</br>  <br>Went against the cartel</br>  <br>Not being part of and not sucking dick's cartel.</br>  <br>Don't quote me, but Doki had one giant nutcase on their staff that spammed Nyaa with a bunch of fake Commie torrents so<br><br><br>pretty much this.<br><br>I think the faggot's name was ZeroYuki. The story behind his death/disappearance is hilarious though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Wow. Doki hasn't been relevant for years, even as a joke.<br>It's actually amazing how they're still alive while every other group dies to the horrors of streaming.</br>  <br>They used to have many staffs. I wonder what happened with them.</br>  http://powerlisting.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Special:Random<br>Alright, /a/ristocrats which power do you possess!?</br></wbr>  <br>One of them supposedly died, as mentioned <br>but yeah, I remember them being an insanely large group that subbed absolutely everything under the sun. I just had to check their site right now and it's like nothing's changed.</br></br>  <br>Just hope they are faster this time since Funi is delaying subs for 4 days.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  <br>Come on, faggot, lighten up.<br>Inou-Battle threads were pretty  fun  because of this.</br></br>  <br>It's not the power thing.<br><br>Is how he posted it. Also, Hatoko still a shit. A shit.</br></br></br>  <br> first son is last <br><br>Fucking really? Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Was it the " /a/ristocrats" thing?<br>Considering only the royals have powers in this I thought it would only be fitting.<br>Yes, I agree. Kur≈çzudo Kurokku is best girl next to Loli</br></br></br>  <br>Anon should've posted perfection instead.</br>  <br>green and yellow aika when?</br>  <br>Is he a siscon or just a troll?</br>  <br><br>There's a lot of Incest vibes and undertones going on in this.<br> I like it. </br></br></br>  <br>They might keep this schedule for the rest of the anime, or they could fall behind horribly after the 6th episode. Best bet is always to watch the raw, but I'll be watching Doki when/if they come out.</br>  <br>Maybe in Misuzawa's future sharkman novel series.</br>  <br> Best onii-sama <br> Best boy <br> Last in rankings <br>So the people in their town vote with their dicks as expected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shu isn't attention whore.</br>  Bravo Production IMS  <br>It doesn't explain why the boys are all at the bottom of the rankings though.</br>  <br>Older brother keeps to himself and doesn't stick out or do anything interesting much the same way the middle one does except the middle one is a loner.<br>Little brother's voters are probably all Ara~ara~ women that want a piece of that shota dick.<br>In the end the only ones actually trying to garner votes are the girls.</br></br></br>  <br>That makes sense i guess. With Shu, Aoi, and Haruka unwilling to be king, almost all the candidates with the personalities or powers that would make good leaders are gone from the race.</br>  <br>I will never look at red haired twin tailed girls the same way thanks to kasuga ayumu</br>  <br>Shuu isn't really good at people like Akane, but since Akane is a girl, it becomes her unique point.</br>  kanade is so fucking hot. Unf. Why does she not have a NBR boyfriend? Is she too much of a jew?  <br> huur duur &gt;Doki <br><br>Fuck off Commie shills.</br></br></br>  <br>I've never really understood people who get disgusted by such things while eating. It just makes you sound like a big baby.</br>  <br>I think of white rolls of paper</br>  Doki saved anime... just this once though.  <br>shut up commie is great</br>  <br>I don't get disgusted by it. I was just brought up with manners is all.<br><br>Now you're just being redundant.</br></br></br>  <br> I was just brought up with manners is all. <br>And that's why you are on /a/ instead of spending time with family. You would be closer if you drop the silly formality of mannerism.</br></br>  <br>epic, epic for the win</br>  <br>I hope Commie stalls more of their projects for dank memes like this.</br>  <br> implying they stalled it for that dank meme <br>They stalled it because the translator was playing the new Fire Emblem. And he chose the best girl, so no bad blood here.<br><br>Making a shitty SVG Batman mask and moving it across the screen in aegisub takes 5 minutes at worst.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ebin, simply ebin<br> why has god forsaken us? </br></br>  <br>Seriously? I'm just saying there are things you don't talk about with others while eating.<br>I saw a man fuck a snake, I could vividly describe it in detail while you eat. How the man spread it's cloaca and shoved his dick in there.<br>Do you actually want to hear such a thing while you eat?<br>Giving me lip for showing decency to others... Nigga, your savage ass best be joking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Continuity, what's that?</br>  <br>Are they the new ZEXCS in utterly low-budget affairs?</br>  <br>Watch 20:46 until 21:23.</br>  <br>There's nothing indecent about toilet paper unless you always make a huge mess of yourself that it's the only thing you can think of when someone mentions toilet paper</br>  <br>I guess it depends on the person.<br>Toilet paper &gt; Paper made to wipe your ass &gt; taking a shit.<br>It's not something that really needs to be said at that moment. Thats the point I'm trying to make. Some people don't care but others might, in the end it's still crass, and poor form.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you don't think about food when you eat too because <br>food &gt; made to be a slimy mushy mess in your mouth &gt; vomit like substance to be digested</br></br>  <br>What, it's still IMS?<br><br>Damnit, can't this artist ever get a decent company to animate the stuff he draws? Twintails was also IMS isn't it?</br></br></br>   Pure reliable soft king. <br>Why shouldn't Aoi be king explain it to me.</br>  Akane-chan is a miracle of the universe.  <br>We're going in circles here.<br>Just stop, you clearly miss the entire point and continuing this will do nothing but waste time.</br></br>  <br>Because she wants to be normie.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  <br><br>True perfection.</br></br>  Man it felt fucking weird hearing Hana Kana's voice again for some reason. It feels like it's been god damn years since I've last heard her as a main role character.<br><br>Fun show though.</br></br>  <br>Ten yen difference, has at least 8 miliards(if not even more). How stingy!</br>  <br/>  <br>Your point is that toilet paper can be indecent and should not be mentioned when eating. My point is that it isn't and not something anyone should feel reserved to mention during a meal.<br><br>Then you made a point about how thinking this would lead to that which would lead to this disgusting idea. And I addressed it by pointing out how your train of thought is ridiculous and just about anything can lead to a disgusting idea when you put too much thought into things. It at the fault of the person with a disgusting mind rather than the person who mentioned toilet paper.</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't get why she isn't Tadokoro.<br><br>I was expecting HanaKana ever since Tadokoro appeared.</br></br></br>   Pretty funny joke <br> In the japanese anime <br>I was surprised</br></br>   Doki <br>Picked up</br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br>Her VA is doing a great job though, especially with the dialect.</br>  <br>True dat.<br><br>But I was still surprised.</br></br></br>  <br>Commie/10</br>   doki <br>Lesser of two evils, I guess?</br>  <br>Right. Only Commie would hate Doki.</br>  How did they translate the gravity manipulation?    <br/>  <br>fake</br>  <br>Except it's not fake.<br><br>Newfag who wasn't even here when Nichijou aired detected.<br><br>There's also that one where every other group translated "geso" as "tentacle" and Doki translated it as "string". Don't know where I left it though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Been here since 05, you're the newfag here</br>  <br><br>whatisstring.rmvb</br></br>  <br><br>Two months ago doesn't really mean much mate. Just saying.</br></br>  <br>Old post but people strugged with it last thread too. It's not tied to her bank account so much as it's tied to her money I think. Like she used to be able to use her power using up the pocket money he parents gave her, and you don't give a kid pocket money to a bank account. <br><br>How much stuff costs, especially future stuff is vague</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing. Because that explains so well how you weren't here during the shitstorm after the first Doki Nichijou.<br><br>Those threads were hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>There's a good Sakura Trick example of Doki's subs as well. It's like they just stop understanding any Japanese for a line or two and make something up.</br>  <br>Not to mention how they're the same staff as Chihiro and AoShen, who were always reviled here for good reason. I kinda remember an analogy, something like them being as shit as [YOUR_MOM] but not even speedsubs. And this from back when [YOUR_MOM] still existed, in 06 or '07.<br><br>I'm still pissed at AoShen after all these years because of Birdy.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's hilarious how they indirectly bully Hikari. She's really cute, though.</br></br>  <br>2005 my friend</br>  <br><br>It's not like they have multiple translators working on different shows. <br><br>You can make the same case with commie in that certain translators like to troll sub some shows while their other releases are fine.</br></br></br></br>  So, Kanade team or Aoi one, which one has better chances to win?  <br>Troll subs !== shit subs.<br><br>Some troll translators are the best, like valerauko. They're great because they actually understand what they're translating it, and they keep the meaning while giving it flair.<br><br>And then all the trollsubs become practice for fantastic translations in difficult-to-transliterate shows, like when Vale did gg's Penguindrum, and then did a very similar Joshiraku.<br><br>Doki's translators are renown for simply not knowing japanese. Or not knowing english. Or not really knowing either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Team Akane will win<br>Others just can't compete</br></br>  <br>Akane. Shu and Aoi seems to actually support her and their support is superior so no one else has a chance.</br>  <br> King of the town <br>How's that even work with her current attitude?<br>Who will be her Knight?</br></br></br>  <br>I believe Aoi will try to make Akane a queen somehow<br>But looks like Shu sided with Kanade</br></br>  <br>In one of the chapters someone posted the other day  it looks like they might be trying to set Haruka up as a contender for kingship, instead of Misaki. He only really has Misaki and Hikari as support though. <br><br><br>Locks herself inside all year and only goes out for special visits to other countries.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like they separated into groups if I understood the raws correctly. Akane has  Aoi and Shu as support while Kanade has her own group. </br>  <br>Are we talking about who's going to catch the falcon or who's going to win the crown?<br><br> They don't even need to catch the hawk if I remember right. <br><br>For the crown:<br> The crown situations getting more complicated now. It used to be Hikari did want to be queen but now she's supporting Haruka. I don't think I've seen Kanade doing any rallies or anything so far, but I do know she wants to win.  <br><br>New volume pretty soon, looking forward to it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Shuu has every intention of marrying Hana <br>Based onii-chan.</br>  I like how some of the siblings actually want to be king, what's the point?<br>They are all royalty regardless, the princes and princess' are set for life already.</br>  <br>Sasuga Onii-sama<br><br><br>They each have their own reasons to be (or not be) king/queen. Some things they can only do as king or queen.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some things they can only do as king or queen. <br>Like make a decree that allows incest so you can marry one of your cute sisters without anything getting in the way? That's, like, the only thing worth doing.</br></br>  <br>Why stop at one? Legalize royal polygamy.</br>  <br>It's just something to do with power or money really. Although they're royalty they don't have a right to do anything just yet. <br><br><br>Is it polygamy if you fuck more than one of Misaki's clones?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even when one sister can multiply into seven? One of which will want to fuck 100%? Anon... s-sasuga.<br>You have my vote.</br></br>  <br> Is it polygamy if you fuck more than one of Misaki's clones? <br>Imagine the marriage ceremony. You and a row of 7 cute wives who are all legally just one girl. Or maybe 6 if the lazy one couldn't be bothered.</br></br>  <br> One of them wants to ditch this already and get to the "consummation" <br> One is stuffing her face with food and is eying the wedding cake. <br> One fell asleep standing up waiting for this whole thing to start. </br></br></br>  <br>One's usually off eating and another's fucking Haruka so probably 5 wives</br>  Is this the chill silly show of the season? <br><br>Also I hope Doki is faster for the next episode.</br></br>  <br>next episode in 22 hours already, thanks to the sub delay.</br>  Haruka can probably work his ability in a way that he would never experience the problems that comes with incest  <br>Woops that was the Funi version</br>  <br>He can pull a Keima if he smart enough to understand the ways of pimp.</br>  <br>It's not like first generation incest babies have any higher probabilities of defects than, say, 30 something year old woman.<br>But I can already picture him using his ability to gauge the chances of impregnation.<br> "10%!? IT'S STILL TO HIGH!" </br></br></br>  <br> implying Doki was any better <br>They missed some lines, too.</br></br>  <br> such a chore to use them <br><br>Well that's your fault for using Nyaa, faggot</br></br></br>  What did /a/ think of the first episode?  And is embarrassment of panty visibility going to be the running joke the whole anime?   <br>Hi there!<br><br>You seem to have made a bit of a mistake in your post.

Is third volume of manga out yet? What's most recent chapter number?  <br>Cant wait for that chapter, especially when she finds out in the end. Akane damn popular and probably would win if it weren't for her phobia</br>  So when do the Ultimaguil show up to threaten the planet?  why is the strongest man in the world wasting his talents studying and getting married?  He would be wasting his talents training and fighting.  <br><br>It was established already.<br><br>He does not have the tireless drive to train like Goku or Vegeta do.<br><br>If he did he would be the strongest in the series.<br><br>Also you now know if Chi Chi pushed him to train after Cell then nothing else bad would have ever happened to earth or any of the characters cause he be too damn op.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did he even do anything relevant? As a fighter he could get much more in terms of feats. What are his non fighting talents?</br></br>  <br>In Dragon Ball Online he wrote a book that taught the public how to control their ki.</br>  <br>This is actually cool, but they probably wont go near it in DBS.</br>  <br><br>Big whoop. Not even canon.<br><br>So pretty much nothing other than reading books?<br><br>Yea he should have stuck to his REAL talents</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is not the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br>he's the great Sayiaman</br>   Gohan will never have bloodlust ever again <br><br>Fuck, Videl and Pan have plot armor due to the ending of Z. He can never be pissed off as he was in the Cell and Buu saga ever again. Gohan is a fuckboi confirmed 4 gay life.</br></br>  <br><br>mystic gohan murders everything below ssj god</br></br>  toriyama wanted gohan to be a badass and be the best<br><br>but japan got mad generic goku wasn't the best, so toriyama made gohan get sucked up by super buu</br></br>  Because he doesn't want to.<br><br>There's already more than enough people to take care of all the bad things that could happen. Plus whenever an arc is over everyone's sure nobody stronger could come.</br></br>  Goku is the worst father ever, that's why...  <br>Gohan will get his own limelight later, no way Super is going to go on without Gohan doing some shit</br>  <br>That's an odd way to spell Ging</br>  better than goten. goten grew up to be weak as fuck and a man slut  <br>Yeah, he'll get another unearned powerboost, beat an enemy around a bit and then blow it just in time for the real heroes (Goku, Vegeta, &amp; Mark) to come save the day.</br>  <br>I hope that happens if for no other reason than to keep Super from becoming just the Goku show.</br>   character has other aspirations in life and wants to raise a proper family <br><br> people make fun of him for this </br></br>  <br>Yeah but that makes him 3rd place among the Sayians only beating out two kids half his age.</br>  <br>What if he just doesn't like to fight? Sure we would like to do all of that crazy stuff. But since his childhood he's been exposed to death, pain, sadness, chaos, and whole bunch of other shit. Odds are it scarred him for life and he's just sick of it.</br>  <br> Videl and Pan have plot armor due to the ending of Z <br>what is wishing loved ones back to life with the dragon balls?</br></br>  Gohan isn't that great of a character anyway, he really doesn't bring much to the table as far as personality, his most notable traits are being a whining beta mamas boy who just happens to be powerful as fuck.  <br><br>To add onto what this anon said. He has never liked fighting. He's only had to fight because he's had to. Ever since he was 3, he was taken from his home and forced to fight in the wilderness for a year. Watched all of his friends and family die in front of him multiple times. All while people scream at him "GOHAN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO IT".<br><br>Who can blame the guy for just wanting to finally settle down and enjoy himself when he thinks that there is no real present danger?</br></br></br></br>  So how long until Piccolo abducts Gohan and drops him on some desolate planet to fend for himself for a year in an attempt toughen him up again?  <br>You just proved me right.</br>  <br>the only time gohan was every a whining beta mamas boy was when he was 4. in the great saiyaman saga he enjoyed fighting for justice that was what they should have continued his character going. <br><br>not exactly the great saiyaman but at least someone who wants to fight to keep his family safe.</br></br></br>  <br>Super won't be the kinda show like the original manga was that can even allow powerups. He will get an episode for himself and Videl, that will lead to him defending Videl or just proving his worth</br>  <br>Dragon Ball's target audience is children. Expecting them to be able to empathize with other people is a bit silly of you.</br>  <br>Except that those children are now on their late 20's and early 30's.</br>  <br>as gohan got older he definitely showed that he enjoyed fighting to some extent. Not exactly goku or vegeta, but definitely enough where he probably would have trained if goku were still a live and had some encouragement. Instead he got Chi Chi telling him since he defeated cell all he had to do was study and everything would turn out ok. <br><br>I mean look at how he acted when they went into babidi's hideout they were all playing rock paper scissors to see who would fight. <br><br>when the androids were about to attack he wanted to train he wasnt forced to train at all. <br><br>he WANTED to go to namek. All these things indicate that he was willing to fight in battle to save those he cared about. the fight with cell where gohan didnt want to fight cell because he didnt want to kill anyone is bullshit written in to make it more dramatic because gohan was always willing to fight for the sake of others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku and Vegeta aren't SSG in Super dickweed.</br>    <br> blocking a roundhouse with your wrist / back of your hand </br>  <br>It wasn't that he did not wanted to fight he just didn't feel like he couldn't beat Cell.</br>  <br><br>Still though, our world and dragonball's world are very different, we don't have planet busters coming every couple of years to destroy us so its okay not to be a great fighter, but they can't afford to get soft because that could mean the end of the world. <br><br>Protecting the world &gt; Reading Books</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yea he should have stuck to his REAL talents <br><br>Fucking Videl till she can't walk?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had that talent.</br>  <br>He looked cooler with the helmet instead of the durag</br>  <br> when the androids were about to attack he wanted to train he wasnt forced to train at all. <br><br>Clear and present danger: check<br><br> he WANTED to go to namek. <br><br>he wanted to revive his dead friends not fight Space Ghengis Kahn <br><br>it's not that he likes to fight or go on adventure it's just that he's not about to ignore what's in front of him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All that is meaningless when you have Goku and the dragonballs. They are the only ones that shine at the end.</br>  That's an odd outfit to wear for studying.  <br>Gohan likes to fight, he just doesn't like obsessively training and having fights to the death.</br>  <br>Because he's already beat people asses in the streets with his fists.<br>Now he need to beat bitches in the sheets with his dick</br></br>  <br>Move aside</br>  <br>Those planet busters are unexpected every time.<br><br>I mean who the fuck would expect to face someone stronger than the strongest being in the universe ( Frieza ) ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Goku is washed up, couldn't beat the androids, couldn't beat cell, only beat buu because of Vegeta, Satan, and literally every living thing on earth, and couldn't beat Beerus even as a god himself.<br><br>Its time to pass the torch......to future Gohan.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tank you for the introduction, citizen but you should stand back. Things could get hairy</br></br>  I'm just mad he isn't cucking Videl with best girl.  <br>How's it feel to be wrong? Also, that is clearly not what that is.</br>  <br>He went to college. The only other people who ever did that are Dr. Gero and Bulma.</br>  <br><br>that red head is nice but she ain't cuter than Videl</br></br>  <br>The nips would never let that happen.</br>  <br>I just think the robot helmet was more cool. Calm your autism.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I do wonder why he never switched back to the helmet even after the tournament was over.<br><br>Why do the DBZ fighters even enter the tournament anyways? They know it's gonna come down to just them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an excuse to go all out against each other with an impartial judge to determine who's the better. Since it was first introduced in dragonball, the tournament has always been a way to see who was the strongest outside of a training environment.</br>  <br>Which should be extremely obvious to anyone who actually watched DB/Z/etc.</br>  <br>It's still a nice excuse to show some cool fights</br>  <br>videl didn't aged well</br>  Future Gohan &gt; all<br><br>Will Future Trunks appear in Super?</br></br>  <br>Because a life of fighting monsters is not anywhere near as fullfulling as having a loving family.</br>  <br>How do you know? Have you done both?</br>  <br>Because having martial artist as an occupation doesn't pay the bills.</br>  <br> Not even canon. <br>It is though.</br></br>  <br>So they just went from children to manchildren.</br>  <br><br>Exactly.<br><br> InB4 Videl is rich as fuck <br><br>I see it as that Gohan mainly wants to be a scholar because he wanst to become one, but after watching this episode, he probably also wants to provide and not being a freeloader.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon you seem to forget going to Namek was never meant to be dangerous<br><br>it was meant to be a fun space adventure</br></br></br>  <br>Because fans sent death letters to Toriyama saying stuff like "If Gohan becomes the main character we are going to find and kill you"<br>So Toriyama was like fuck that shit.</br></br>  <br><br>He could join pretty much any sports team and be a billionaire in no time, Videl is strong enough to do the same which would allow Gohan the time to train.</br></br>  Just about to download Dbs. What subs are best?  <br> why is the strongest man in the world wasting his talents studying and getting married? <br>Because that's his wish and desire? Why did every murrican suddenly forgot how much of a cry baby Gohan always was? He never wanted to fight, he ALWAYS was dragged to the fights.</br></br>  <br><br>he's so strong, he no longer needs to fight.</br></br>  <br>He loves his woman, loves the earth, loves his mom and dad, his friends, oh and his Foster dad as well. He's like Goku was when he was little and growing up, he never hated or wanted to hate anyone</br>   Wants to live a normal peaceful happy life <br> WAAAH WHY DOESN'T HE KEEP TRAINING? FUCK HIM FOR BEING HAPPY <br><br>This is why I hate DBZfags</br></br></br>  Future Gohan is the best one.  <br>He sure is.  Hand down. </br>  <br><br><br> the best <br> dead </br></br></br></br>  <br>He died like a bitch and never reached even close to his actual potential.</br>  <br><br>teen gohan from the other timeline would have whooped his ass<br><br>picollo from the other timeline would have whooped his ass</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga got his ass handed to him by shitty weak androids <br>How can he be the best?</br></br>  <br>Daily reminder</br>     gohan BTFO by Vegeta <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oVO<wbr>nm9tNcCM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Vegeta seems to be the only one taking a balanced approach, he trains relentlessly but also stays close to his family and tutors trunks, Goku takes it to the extreme and leaves for years at a time to train alone, Gohan is on the opposite side of that extreme by not training period and focusing on family life. <br><br>Oddly enough Vegeta seems to be the only one doing it right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Soon.      <br> vegeta is only saiyan living life correctly <br>Well that's something.</br></br>  gohan had the potential to be stronger than goku yes that is true but GOTEN HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE STRONGER THAN ALL THE SAIYANS LET ME REMIND YOU ALL THAT HE TURNED SUPER AT THE AGE OF LIKE 7  <br>"drops him on some desolate planet"? Did you even watch it properly</br>  <br><br> 00:20 <br> angrymanlet.jpg <br><br>should be called "Vegeta throwing a tissy at Gohan"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but unfortunately, was as thick as a brick</br>  <br>Goku is a manchild that doesn't understand the weight of the shit he does. Vegeta is the only true man on the show.</br>  <br>Future Gohan's the weakest Gohan, though. Probably the weakest Super Saiyan.</br>  <br>Yeah he's not super smart like Goku was.</br>  <br><br>I'm really digging the new Vegeta to be honest, hes definitely matured a bit since his prince of all saiyan days.</br></br>    <br>Because every time there is peace in Dragon Ball they treat is as if the peace is going to last forever.<br>"Strongest in the universe" is a completely useless title, even in times of war since the only thing it's good for is saving the world for no reward whatsoever.<br>He figures he could make something with his life instead of being dumb muscle like his father.</br></br></br>  <br>Me too. I hope he finally gets his moment this time.</br>  <br>All Goten wants to do is goof off with Trunks and not seriously train like Goku did.</br>  <br> strongest man in the world </br>  <br>Its call irony anon. Highest capability, but no interest in acheiving it. its like the pacifist who can kick ass. its been used heaps of times in alot of tv and movies<br> Aang from TLA <br>as a prime example</br></br></br>  <br>But still the badman in a pink shirt</br>  To be honest, the Japanese Goku voice is growing on me. It really makes Goku sound like the manchild he is.  <br>I wonder where that bitch is now</br>  <br>that shirt pretty much sums up his existence post cell saga</br>  <br> "Strongest in the universe" is a completely useless title <br><br>Although he could theoretically have everything for free</br></br></br>  <br>Sucking baseball bro's dick</br>  <br>Future Gohan is the best Gohan in terms of character, inheriting his father's fighting spirit like a goddamn FotNS successor. It's too bad his actual power is surpassed by fuccboi Gohan.</br>  <br>I thought he was space napoleon hitler</br>  But in the end, who will be the one with a money making job and going home to a cute, loving, non-nagging wife at the end of the day?<br><br>Not Goku or Vegeta that's for sure.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah its not that bad, I think the show will be good enough to enjoy no matter what language you hear it in anyway.</br></br>  <br>Future Gohan didn't have the luxury of the ROSAT or anybody to train with other than Trunks. Besides he usually took on both androids at once which no one else ever did.</br>  <br>He never had a similar experience to Goku when he joined Roshi. Krillan was all about training and Roshi's regimen was fucking brutal. Now look at Goten where his only training is goofing off with Trunks and the only person stronger than him that tried to train him was Goku who only had a short amount of time and isn't the most serious teacher ever. If Piccolo was stronger than Goten and was able to reign both him and Trunks in, then things would be different.</br>  <br><br> could steal anything they wanted  <br> police comes <br> goku flicks a pinto bean and kills every single cop alive </br></br></br></br>  <br>why is gohan acting like a king of fighters character?</br>  <br> was <br>The show is still going on anon</br></br>  <br><br>He is so fast though he could easily rob a bank without even being noticed.<br><br>Even without resorting to crime there really is no excuse for any of them to be broke or working a 9 to 5 when they can just go pro in pretty much any physical activity.</br></br></br></br>  I think all Gohan haters are just Jelous of his ability to have best girl every night. who i might add is top 3 strongest human in the world and probbably has matchable stamina to him  <br>He's a country hick monkey. Nozawa is perfect for the role.<br><br>Sean Schemmel makes him sound like fucking Superman.</br></br></br>  <br>I think its just the Moran mindset of nips to work hard for what they want though. For physical demi-gods its a challenge for Gohan to study. he dosent have a challenge physically.<br>Thats probbably the essence of Sayins, they seekout what challenges them.</br></br>  <br>This. Plus listening to how she changes his voice from Dragon Ball to DBZ really adds to Goku's charm since he has the same VA and sounds like he's physically grown.</br>  <br> money making job <br> needing money with all those abilities <br>I'd never even buy a fucking house.</br></br></br>   rewatching cell fight <br> goku not helping gohan when gohans getting beaten <br> says gohan''s about to unleash his true potential as cell's crushing gohan's body <br> piccolo is the one to speak out against gohan's fighting <br> says that he's just an 11 year old boy who doesn't feel like fighting <br> also says he'd rather die then let gohan get beat to death <br> even vegeta questions why goku put his son against the strongest fighter in the universe (currently) <br> goku starts feeling like shit <br><br>why is piccolo so based?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does Gohan study exactly, anyways? Do we learn about what he actually plans to major in?  <br> Gohan <br>You seemed to have misspelled Krillin.</br></br>  <br>What? Aang was literally training the entire series to fight the Firelord. Just because he didn't want to kill people doesn't mean he was a pacifist. He fought all the time.<br><br>Also Gohan isn't the highest capability fighter. Frieza was the strongest being in the entire galaxy without ever once training a minute in his life. As soon as he did a few months of training his power skyrocketed to God of the universe levels. Another month and he would have been able to beat Beerus and his master and all of the Z fighters at the same time.</br></br></br>  At the very least you have to give Chi Chi props for keeping a leash on his monkey ass, its commendable how she managed to have more of an influence on his life than Goku.  <br>You can spot that by even comparing Goten and Goku's voices in the latest episode. It's not as nuanced as people think.</br>  <br> Marine biology </br>  <br>Aang was a complete pacifist. he hated violence. i can't think of a single time when he Wanted to hurt anyone. Even in the final few epps he questiones his ability to fight Ozai as he didn't want to hurt him. just stop the evil.</br>  <br>Well it helps that Nozawa's pretty good at her job.</br>  <br>I think you could say he also had a shitty childhood, almost dying on numerous occasions because he had to fight, not because he wanted to or did it for sport.</br>  <br>Gohan never needed such hard leash to begin with. Gohan cried he wanted cooked food when all he had was an apple when at his age Goku was hunting dinosaurs.<br><br>If anything Chichi is to blame, she spoiled Gohan.</br></br></br>  <br>You know, people always bitch about Gohan being pointless or a waste, but honestly Gohan is doing what he always wanted to be, become a scholar. Even when he was younger as a child Bulma asks him "do you wanna grow up and be strong like your dad?" no, I wanna be a scholar!<br><br>Now there is a way to make Gohan relevant, and powerful, since he is becoming a scholar, he has intellect. It would be great if they wrote him in as becoming this brilliant tactician or able to create new moves that would help him out even against super strong foes. Using his knowledge and strength to his advantage.<br><br>I dunno, figure out some method to absorb a ki blast shot at him and then blast it back ten fold?<br><br>Im going to place bets that Gohan will stumble across something that tells the gang about the new big bad or whatever, or after they meet Beerus Gohan gets the chance to talk to Whis or even go to the grand kai planet to study some who knows. <br><br>Its not that far fetched, the grand kai's know him, and I could see him going to another world like his dad to train, but with his mind, and find out all kinds of super awesome techniques or history of the universe and time.<br><br>But most likley they will just make him stupid like his damn dad and power struggle weaker then the big bad and goku saves the day. Don't care, long as Super isn't like Z I am fine, I want it to be like Dragon Ball, tired of the power level raising shit. In Freeza F or whatever they state that Goku and Vegita are hitting their ceiling with power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In Freeza F or whatever they state that Goku and Vegita are hitting their ceiling with power. <br>And for the second time are shoving they must work together, Toriyama is planning ahead something this time.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127763072 <br>Maybe kamehameha has more punch.</br>  <br> Saves the world with his girlfriend on a daily basis </br>  You know what stumps me still?<br>How the fuck did Goku and Chichi conceive Goten with Chichi surviving? Is their sex literally Goku going to sleep while she rides him or something?<br><br><br> couldn't beat the androids <br>That's because he was literally crippled by a disease that kills him in a different timeline.<br> couldn't beat cell <br>I still feel that the only reason he couldn't was because of Gohan. The training seemed directed at improving Gohan above all with Goku wanting Gohan to meet his full potential or some shit.<br> only beat buu because of Vegeta, Satan, and literally every living thing on earth <br>Almost like that's the point of the spirit bomb or something, right?<br> couldn't beat Beerus even as a god himself <br>And considering the only other being confirmed for being able to beat Beerus is Whis, this is a shoddy point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Man <br> Part alien scum <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  What if Goku had fused with Gohan instead of Vegeta?  <br>No its not.<br>Game storylines are never canon, even if the original author is involved, because the nature of games means the story is only to fill gaps between gameplay.<br>War for Cybertron and fall of Cybertron were part of the "continuity" of transformers prime, but it was clearly established that the games weren't canon, just another telling of some basic events.<br>Games are like side stories.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In real life, Chi is actually used to enhance sex in order to make it pleasurable for both partners. It's possible that Goku and Vegeta being so fucking strong is actually helping their wives survive.</br>  <br>That would be fucked in the head</br>  <br>Ya that makes sense, thats prolly why Goten and Trunks could turn super sayjin. Vegita raped Trunks and Gohan raped Goten.</br>  <br>Why you niggers pretend they are destroying planets when they shit?<br>They can measure their strength, Krillin almost broke Goku skull with a rock when he was not paying attention and he was vulnerable to the laser gun because he let his guard down.</br></br>  <br>Gotta actually say I was surprised at Goku's jap voice, it was pretty damn good, but Sean Schemmel as him and Vegeta and Piccolo by Christopher_Sabat, are gosh darn fantastic</br>  <br> strongest man in the world <br> can't even beat accelerator <br>*sigh* when will dbz babbies learn</br></br></br>  <br>That would be wincest.</br>  <br>NARWHALS NARWHALS SWIMMING THROUGH THE OCEAN</br>  <br>a stronger, smarter version of Vegeto really. without the cockyness. and considdering it was Mystic Gohan could have become pretty ruthless.<br>I remember reading somehwere that the higher level of SSJ a sayin goes the more ruthless they become, also from the dub actors interview he made his voice deeper for each level. to show a more serious note. i like that, the more monkey you go, the more monkey you go</br></br>  Has it been said whether Goten have the same potential Gohan had?  <br>They have to power up you know.<br>When they have their children turned all the way down, they're only a few times stronger than a peak human.<br>And chichi had training too.</br></br></br>    <br>TFS voices will always be in my head</br>  So I'm correct that Super takes place before BotG?<br><br>Does that mean goku won't surpass beerus in it?</br></br>  <br>Mr Satan is married?</br>  <br>I don't think ki is going to prevent Chichi's pelvis from being utterly destroyed the first time Goku thrust into her<br><br><br> Goku take a shit <br> Constipated <br> Pushes so hard he goes SSGSS and shits so hard he turns the bathroom into a creator <br>I'm laughing way harder than I should be.<br> Seriously though, even without going SSJ or anything, the dude trains hard and it's a bit harder to control yourself in such a situation <br><br><br> Chichi had training <br>That has been ignored since getting preg with Gohan. Possibly even before that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does Chichi train herself to prepare for Goku's supercock?<br>Does she use one of those jackhammers I've seen where they replace the drill with a dildo?</br></br>  <br>Oh yes, let's give everyone the power to blow up the fucking planet, how smart.</br>  <br>Super will span both movies 14 and 15 and keep going. We don't how long after but it's possible that Goku may reach Beerus.</br>  <br> How the fuck did Goku and Chichi conceive Goten with Chichi surviving? <br>The same way you're able to hold a baby without crushing it to death, or open a door without slamming it off it's hinges.<br><br><br><br><br>It isn't even about being powered up or down, even though they're aliens, I'm still sure they have dexterity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ki <br>It's chi, and it'll affect her body too. Almost like a seatbelt.</br></br>  <br>who's mark</br>  <br>Future Gohan just showed how poor of a write akira is because he should have been able to beat androids. He still had his hidden power and it said he fought androids multiple times which should have give him powerups.</br>  <br> not knowing mark <br>Back to /v/</br></br>  <br> That has been ignored since getting preg with Gohan. Possibly even before that. <br>Except it wasn't. she trained with Goten. took a SSJ kick to the face. pretty sure her pussy could take a dick thats being controlled strength</br></br>  <br>Because he knows he's coming home to this</br>  <br>Muffin button!</br>  Would you date a Sayin woman Anon?<br> Always out tranning <br> Rarely comes home <br> When she is home is on Heat <br> Eats out your whole kitchen </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ki and chi are pronounced the same and used interchangeably, you fucking idiot.</br>  <br>Only gunna say this once, oh and please remember who her dad was</br>  <br>Goku isn't a manchild in the manga. It's Toei that refuses to let him grow up.</br>  <br><br>They would never get that strong. Unless you cite Roshi blowing up the moon gag as an actual feat, he's a renowned master that can only blow up a small mountain that drains him. King Piccolo could only blow up a city that drains him. The human Z Warriors are outliers.</br></br>  <br> Goten <br>Not really an impressive feat.<br>Goten and the Trunks of that time were utter jokes of characters and even Gotenks is a fucking joke.</br></br></br>  <br> ki an chi <br> pronunciation the same <br><br>No. Prior to about the 18th century, Mandarin used a heavily aspirated k sound, sort of like khi (thanks Legge, now get back in the box) or, in archaic Wade-Giles, k'i. This changed to a heavily aspirated ch sound, which is written as ch'i (W-G), chhi (Simplified Wade), or qi (hanyu pinyin). "Khi" is close to ki, but still differs in how you have to intone it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Roshi blowing up the moon gag <br><br>What the fuck are you saying? He actually did blow up the moon.</br></br></br>  <br> Had Buu on the ropes for a lil bit <br> Could 2v1 18 when using arms or legs only <br> Could arguably still Kamehameha the earth <br>Even in his base he was stronger then any DB villan.<br>I agree though, Dbz isnt very well written, but its still fun</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>18 is stronger.</br>  <br>At the end of the day none of it makes sense.<br>The first major villans could kill planets. and in comparison of where DBZ ended they would be fodder even for Krillin to take out.</br></br>  <br>Half robot, that does not count.</br>  <br> even Krillin <br> not realising that Krillin is pretty fucking strong </br></br>  <br>I wrote Yamcha first, but i doubted it myself to much</br>  <br>Roshi actually did blow up the moon, it's just that moons in the Dragon Ball universe are a lot more fragile than ours.</br>  <br>That's his charm, his strength and his shield, because Goku is Goku</br>  Who could beat Freza by the end of DBZ? like Namek 100% Freza in a 1v1  <br> Raditz takes Goku sacrificing himself to beat <br> Nappa and Vegita literally have plants stronger than Raditz <br> Freiza's powerlevel is over 500k <br> Cell's was over 10m <br>It's hilarious how much shit scales. Every new big bad is like an MMO expansion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's an outlier. Note Piccolo being wiped out after destroying a city. <br><br><br> it's just that moons in the Dragon Ball universe are a lot more fragile than ours. <br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize they were just sparring right? Goten obviously wasn't even close to going all out at all.<br>Chi-Chi probably can't hope to come even within .01 percent of Goten's power, but she can still teach him martial arts.</br></br>  <br>Its not very well thought out when you think about it. by rights the anons saying Goku having a hard shit should split the planet in half. how can your punch be strong enough to wipe out solar systems. but still have a gentle enough grip to hold onto glass cups?</br>  <br>Gohan killed him in one punch in the Gogeta movie, but that's not canon. I'd say Piccolo and 18 could for sure, not sure about Krillan or Tien but they might.</br>  <br>I don't know why everyone wants Raditz to come back, he's the most pathetic character in existence.<br> Don't train your tail, even though Goku did when he was like 10 <br> Get beaten by two people a hundred times weaker than you <br> Your own comrades deem you too shit to wish back to life <br>By the end of Z, Yamcha would literally be able to beat him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch the scene then.<br>Goten went SSJ by accident out of frustration and anger during the tranning. and the kick hardly hurt Chi Chi, i agree its shit teir writing. but im here for the yelling anyway</br></br>  <br>Krillin is actually the strongest man on earth if you think about it</br>  <br> On you silly Anon, they're not pronounced the same <br> They are merely pronounced very similarly <br><br>Nigga you for real</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet if Yamcha and Raditz somehow met they'd become great friends.</br>  <br>but he's literally not powered up</br>  <br>Just checked the manga, Piccolo shows no signs of fatigue after blowing up the city.</br>  Doc is here now. I prescribe five times the dosage for all of you.  <br>They can lower their ki to the single digits. They're not masking their ki, they're actually lowering it.</br>  <br><br><br>Wasn't Krillins destructo Disk able to cut anything? by rights he should be able to beat anyone other then Buu, as buu was not a solid. and Cell I guess. who had bullshit Regen hax. who claimed it was because of Namekian blood. yet im pretty sure they can hardly even regen organs</br></br></br>  <br>Do you think Krillin teases Tien about the Namekian boost he got?</br>  <br>Anyone that doesn't dodge when he screams out the attack name. It would've been amazing if Nappa had actually tried to tank it and died then and there.</br>  <br>You mean Tenshinhan?</br>  <br>I seem to remember perfect cell tanking a kienzan just after he transformed one of the few episodes I watched</br>  <br><br>Don't they have to Physically concentrait REALLY hard to do that?<br>E.g. When Gohan and Krillin were hiding from Freeza, Zarbon and Ddoria. they had to try really hard to lower their Ki levels<br>E.g.2 When Goku was recovered he almost threw Chichi into space didnt he?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Destructo Disk is a plot device. It cuts what the narrative needs to be cut. Nothing more.</br>  <br>Namekian boost presumably put Krillin on another level.</br>  Counting the new movies<br>1. Whis<br>2. Beerus<br>3. Golden Freeza<br>4. SSGSS Goku<br>5. SSGSS Vegeta<br><br>Counting the manga only<br>1. Super Vegetto<br>2. Super Buu (Gohan + Goten + Trunks + Piccolo)<br>3. Super Buu (Gotenks + Piccolo)<br>4.

No Mandarin speakers alive pronounce qi as khi. That was the state of affairs back in the 1700s. They use the heavily-aspirated ch instead (chee). You likely got thrown by the end note about how even in the archaic reading, you'd still have to mind your tone and aspiration (ki isn't exactly super-aspirated).</br>  <br>He was already drastically underpowered compared to Tenshinhan before Namek, so all that boost did was bring him to the same or slightly below level as him.</br>  <br>Yamcha isnt the strongest man</br>  <br>If Roshi blew up the moon, why was it still there when Gohan was growing up? They wish the moon back off stage? Piccolo then blows it up AGAIN? Guys, cut the moon a break here, it works hard maintaining the tides and you just keep blowing that shit up to suit your convenience.</br>  <br>I think so but that's really only when the plot demands it. I seem to remember when they were hiding it was Krillan telling Gohan to lower his ki because Gohan was still a babby and hadn't trained as extensively at it and the Goku thing is just him being a doof.</br>  thinking of watching dbz again. should i bother watching every episode or follow the fillerguide?  <br> gohanstruefather.jpg </br>  <br><br> trains 13 years <br> still cant beat thd androids <br><br>B L U N D E R<br>L<br>U<br>N<br>D<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ultimate gohan was stronger than the buu he fought though</br>  <br>Kami removed Goku's tail and put the moon back when Goku started training with him.</br>  <br> If Roshi blew up the moon, why was it still there when Gohan was growing up? <br>Bro, Gohan's moon was a hologram created by a fallen Saiyan spaceship.<br><br>...<br><br>I didn't realize how retarded that was until I watched myself type it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3. Golden Freeza <br> 4. SSGSS Goku <br> 5. SSGSS Vegeta <br>Maybe if you're talking a Goldie who actually trained, but SSGSS Vegeta won that fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit I think I remember that what the fuck</br>  <br>Watch every episode, but keep in mind what's filler and what isn't. Even the filler is kind of fun.</br>  <br>In terms of the peak Golden Freeza hits, it's higher than SSGSS Goku and Vegeta. He was able to outclass Goku after both of them transformed, though it didn't last.<br><br>Freeza's issue is making his Golden transformation last without consuming huge amounts of energy.</br></br></br>  So Cooler was stronger then Freza right?<br>What if he trained? here have another movie Toriyama.<br>Lets litteraly bring back eveyr single Villan, and say they just came back to life and trained for a month. and can now rival the Gods of destruction</br></br>  <br>He didn't train with Goku in the hyperbolic time chamber. Didn't get the same training.</br>  <br>Eh. He never got any decent zenkais until the one that blew off his arm, and that just undid it altogether.<br>Nobody to train with either until Trunks came around.</br></br>  <br>Right? I think it was something they did for the 90s dub? I mean shit, I think the thing about Kami putting the moon back is correctly from the manga, but I def remember the moon hologram.</br>  <br>You realize that it grew back, right?

Not very reliable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Piccolo blew up the moon while training Gohan and then the hologram happened and he was all "What the fuck I blew that shit up" and then found the saiyan pod and then blew that up. I could be wrong though.</br>  What are the chances of us seeing again Raditz or launch in super?  <br> If he did he would be the strongest in the series <br>No he wouldn't, old Kai raised his powerlevel to his limit already, he can't get stronger than mystic level since he's not a true saiyan.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but why not just activate the disc at close range or something? Why not just augment your punches and kicks with that shit?</br>  <br><br>Compare his second blast in chapter 159. Goku even notes his power was low.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but who you were not<br>I Agree. grab their wrist first. load up the disk in other hand and bam.<br>Also im pretty sure it was used in combination with Solar flair. one of the most useful techniques back in the day</br></br></br>  <br>Back to /v/</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here's how it goes<br> Roshi blows up the moon to change Goku back to normal <br> God brings it back and removes Goku's tail <br> Gohan sees the moon and transforms, and Piccolo blows it up to change him back to normal <br> FILLER EPISODE: Goku's Saiyan ship projects a hologram that transforms Gohan again, and Piccolo destroys it <br>And it ended up being a bad decision because they say that Goku's ship is used to create the ship Goku takes to Namek.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Protip: Everyone who claims to unlock your true potential in Dragon Ball are vastly over-selling their ability<br>It happened to Goku like three times, and mystic Gohan was the second time Gohan's potential was 'fully unlocked'</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x4g<wbr>HZP4xRPM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>this was such a cool moment</br></br></br>  <br>Videl's pussy is just too good, maybe...?</br>  <br>I remember when DB was more about tactics than power levels. Those were funner times.</br>  <br/>  <br>Wouldn't that be from fighting Goku?</br>  <br><br>Maybe Raditz is still alive in Universe 6</br></br>  <br> Before Goku even grew up, he was taught by Popo how to fight without sight. <br> Long into Dragon Ball Z, blinding people is a viable way to stop them <br>Little inconsistencies like this annoy me</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, like Krillin and Goku's fight<br>Oh wait...<br> Krillin uses every tactic in the book and outwits Goku at every turn <br> Goku still wins because stronk </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan only trained because trunks told them about the androids.<br>Otherwise, three years off</br></br>  <br>nice meme</br>  <br>When did anyone other than the Z Fighters ever use blinding as a fighting technique? Fucking never, that's when.</br>  <br>Remember when Trunks shattered the piccolo statue and he somehow managed to regen from that? That was some serious bullshit.</br>  Nice Buu and Piccolo fusing would be the best thing that could happen in super  <br><br>No, it's right after he just destroyed the city with a single blast. That is what drained his power, and he does the second almost immediately afterwards. Try reading it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Z fighters were able to use that shit on warriors far more advanced than them, when even Popo knew how to counter it.</br>  <br>I think its just a panic technique, sure you don't need eyes to see. but go mid fight using them very heavily to sudden blindness and you probbably don't have a clear head, not excusing the shit writing but yeah</br>  <br>You talk like they used it all the time. I recall Solar Flare being used exactly twice.</br>  <br><br>That's more of a case of you not knowing what you're talking about. Solar Flare + suppressing your ki is what Cell did to get away. Freeza and the other bad guys on Namek couldn't sense ki without scouters.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12776703 <br>Actually, Tien's fight with Drum and part of Goku's fight with PIccolo occur betweent eh two blasts<br>As well, Piccolo's second blast (the one that made him tired) wasn't made to destroy the city, but was made to destroy Goku. As such, it could be assumed it was the intensity of the blast (being such a level to kill Goku) rather than the size of it that tired Piccolo.</br></br>  <br>He's smart<br>He wants poon<br>He wants to provide for his family</br></br></br>  <br>Those are both completely different things.</br>  <br> the entire show just kept promoting how badass Gohan was going to be by showing hints of his incredible power and how he was able to keep up with people way older than him <br> then the Buu saga happened </br></br>  <br>Its used on Vegeta, Dodoria and the Z warriors.<br><br>That's nice pal, but Popo's training focused on air movement, noise etc. not ki.</br></br></br>  <br>Well excuuuuuse me, princess. I guess they used Solar Flare 3 times, not 2.</br>  <br>that lucky fuck</br>  <br> Popo's training focused on air movement, noise etc. not ki. <br><br>It was a retreating tactic, moron. And you seem to think because someone's strong means they're more skilled than the weaker.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not an inconsistency. Goku demonstrates fighting without light in the Buu Saga.<br><br>I think its real power later on is less that it blinds you and more that it's so bright it's physically painful.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't claim it was some canon-destroying plothole, just a little inconsistency that annoyed me, much like Raditz not training his tail, and Goku not thinking that he would have.</br>  <br> Tien on Roshi <br> Tien on Goku <br> Goku on Tiens <br> Goku on Vegeta <br> Krillin on Dodoria <br> Krillin on Frieza <br> Cell on Piccolo/Trunks/Krillin <br> Cell on Trunks <br><br>Off the top of my head that's every time it's used.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Its a retreating tactic <br>And the blinded person can't follow the retreating one because?<br>And can you give me an example where fighting prowess isn't directly tied to 'power levels'?<br><br>Yeah, that could be right, I'd have to go and look at the examples of when they use it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Picabuu</br>  <br> And the blinded person can't follow the retreating one because? <br> disorientation from being blinded <br> pain from being blinded <br> not being able to see from their primary mode of seeing <br> not having enough time to concentrate  <br>I swear, this series really brings out the most retarded people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Disorientation from blinding <br> Not being able to see from their primary mode of seeing <br>These all rely on the idea that YOU CAN"T 'SEE' WHEN YOUR EYES AREN'T WORKING<br>Goku at least, was specifically trained so he could, and you'd assume other top-level warriors would be the same.<br><br>The only real point you have was the pain. I can't decide if you're a braindead DBZ fan that defends everything or just one of the countless bitter citizens of /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did vegeta even get ssjg in the new movie?  <br>not him, but you seem to be completly and purposly ignoring the fact its a shock technique. meant to dissorentate someone. like getting poked in the eyes. you aren't thinking.

I finally got Battle of Gods off my checklist and apparently Beerus is in Super?  <br><br>you ever notice how chinese people don't write shit in our alphabet? It can be written chi or ki its the pronunciation that matters you autist.

To save the series he was basically kicked out of the main gang and the silly tournament arc hapened.</br>  here is a question, not trying to start a powerlevel discussion here, mostly because it doesnt matter with gods anymore<br><br>but when radditz scanned an average human farmer his powerlevel was 7<br><br>what is the unit equal to?<br><br>some shitty alien that is 7x weaker than an average old farmer?<br><br>a rather large rabbit?<br><br>a small to medium sized dog?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Equal to an average middle aged earthling male</br>  <br>It doesn't mean anything, its a silly way to gauge how scared the audience needed to be of certain villains<br><br>because when 2 characters can both shoot off ridiculously large explosions you need a new way to demonstrate who's stronger</br></br></br>  <br>so that average middle aged earthling male was actually 7 average middle aged earthling males in an average middle aged earthling male suit?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br>This<br>If someone says shit like this, it just means the plot requires you to be stronger right now.</br></br>  Becuse he doesn't want to be like his father who wasted all of his wife's fortune in food, he wants to buy his own food.  <br>Only goku that mastered that jutsu</br>  <br>Because he doesnt like fighting.<br>Are you that fucking new?</br></br>  <br>God damn, I want to enjoy these threads but I just know 89% of you are fucking uneducated Spics.</br>  <br> had his full potential unlocked, twice <br> people wonder why he doesn't train <br>He already peaked. He can't get stronger.</br></br></br>  <br>Average person's power level is 5-7.<br>Raditz is about 1200-1500, goku and piccolo at the time were about 500 each.<br>Vegeta was about 18,000 in the saiyan saga<br>Freiza and SS1 Goku were in the neighborhood of 1000000<br>After that, all the super saiyan forms ruin any sense of scale.</br></br></br></br></br>  WHERE<br><br>IS<br><br>UUB</br></br></br></br>  <br>He can do good things with his brain too like cure cancer or some shit.</br>  So what is this Super thing? Is it a reboot of some kind? I've read the manga many years ago, but I've never seen any of the anime.  <br> Where is the Flip OC character <br>Nowhere thank god.</br></br>  So which sub is not shit will continue subbing it and not dropping it 300 episode later  <br>Because the show has to be about Goku. We can't create some sense of progression by having Goku's son take over for him. Goku has to be the strongest.<br><br>It's also totally in character for Gohan not to be like Goku or Vegeta with the training and Videl is a pretty good reason to get married.</br></br></br>  <br>Uub will be 10 years old 9,5 years after DBS episode 1.</br>  I hate all the fucks who keep saying OVER 9000 like it's some strong shit.<br><br>I mean they have obviously watched the show up to Buu then why would they keep talking about Goku's power level when Vegetal first shows up as anything even close to powerful?</br></br>  <br>you are disconnected from reality, perhaps actual autism.<br><br>I don't think this needs to be spelled out, but it's a joke. <br><br>I hope you're a troll, but if you are you are a pretty shit one, because you inspire pity rather than anger.</br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Frieza was stronger than Buu and Cell and that the reason robo-Frieza jobbed so hard was clearly that they put him back together with literal garbage from a garbage can.

I am in the mood for it.</br>  <br>Manga<br> Super Vegetto <br> Super Buu (Gohan + Goten + Trunks + Piccolo) <br> Base Vegetto <br> Ultimate Gohan <br> Super Buu (Gotenks + Piccolo) <br> Super Buu (Goten + Trunks + Piccolo) <br> SSJ3 Gotenks <br> Super Buu <br> SSJ Gotenks <br> SSJ3 Goku <br> Original Majin Buu <br> Gotenks <br> Kid Buu &gt;= Evil Buu <br> Mr. Buu/Good Buu/the Buu who ends up joining the Z warriors and is Mr. Satan's life-partner at the end <br> SSJ2 Vegeta <br> SSJ2 Goku <br> Dabura <br> SSJ2 Gohan <br> Kibitokai <br><br>I see no reason to assume Kid Buu was any stronger than Evil Buu. Also, I think Gohan was a smidge above Gotenks Buu in raw power, but Gotenks Buu had regeneration and that allowed him to wear Gohan down, similar to Piss Frieza getting tired after being double-teamed by the Blue Saiyan Group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically he didn't train with Goku so he didn't get as strong. You know who could've beaten the androids though? Piccolo, if he had fused with Kami before he was killed then he would've wrecked them with ease.</br>  <br>Why is purified Buu lower than SSJ3 Goku when Goku couldn't beat him without a hueg Genki Dama?</br>  <br> Gotenks <br> Kid Buu &gt;= Evil Buu <br><br>ayy lmao<br><br>Kid Buu is stronger than any Fat Buu and on par with Super Buu because the more evil he is the stronger he is, that's how his magic works. Yes, M A G I C. Magic doesn't have to make logical sense.<br><br>Good Buu became weaker than Evil Buu because Evil Buu was, you guessed it, evil. I'm not making this up Kaioshin flat out says Buu LOST POWER when he absorbed Dai Kaiou, not just because his form became goofy for fighting, but because it got so much good in him his base power level was nerfed to all hell.<br><br><br>Even if Goku could kinda keep up with Kid Buu, SSJ3 wastes tons of ki. It's a highly impractical form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku said he could have beaten Fat Buu while he was Super Saiyan 3, but chose not to so he could give Goten and Trunks a chance. The pure Majin Buu is the weakest because he doesn't have any of the power of his absorptions. What makes him dangerous is his insane and unpredictable nature.<br><br><br> I see no reason to assume Kid Buu was any stronger than Evil Buu <br>I initially thought that, assuming that Evil Buu was basically Kid Buu in terms of evil, but that's not the case. I'm guessing that Fat Buu's power was split in half between Mr. Buu and Evil Buu, but Evil Buu could outclass Mr. Buu's innocent nature.<br>Basically<br> Fat Buu = Mr. Buu (dominant) + Evil Buu <br> Super Buu = Evil Buu (dominant) + Mr. Buu <br>Which is why Super Buu is more dangerous than Fat Buu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kid Buu <br> On par with Super Buu <br><br>Not power level wise no. The reason why Kid Buu looks powerful because he has no conscience and will just blow up planets willy nilly. Super Buu actually has cognition, so he can actually make rational decisions. Also Goku at SSJ3 was fighting on par with Kid Buu until he ran out of stamina.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because fucking idiots.<br><br>Kid/Purified Buu was so much bullshit, he was fun. Literally spent the entire time dicking around during his fight against Goku.<br><br>Why anyone assumes he's that damn low, is beyond me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rational decisions <br> Literally getting fucking stomped by Vegetto <br> Even as a fucking candy <br><br>You need to rewatch the series you retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> looks powerful because he has no conscience and will just blow up planets willy nilly. <br><br>Yeah OK. Let me guide you to your containment forum:<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/<br><br>Until we talk about stuff explicitly stated in the fucking manga, please take all of the time you need and stay there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>give me the thing</br>  <br/>  <br> If Toriyama barely could remember that SSJ3 <br>That was super saiyan 2 just like how GT forgot about that form as well.</br></br>  <br>Imagine Android 18's PTSD.<br> Having your body cut open and having every one of your bones and organs replaced with a mechanism and processors  <br> Probably while you're still conscious  <br> Probably after spending the last four weeks watching the same thing being done to your brother, knowing it'll be your turn next </br></br></br></br>  <br> All because some old guy wants revenge on some other guy you don't even know <br> And then finding out you were never even meant to fight him <br> You were just fodder to fuel an even stronger bio-organism </br></br></br>  Why don't they just consistently half-kill each other for power-ups?  <br> I initially thought that, assuming that Evil Buu was basically Kid Buu in terms of evil, but that's not the case. I'm guessing that Fat Buu's power was split in half between Mr. Buu and Evil Buu, but Evil Buu could outclass Mr. Buu's innocent nature. <br>Okay, that makes sense. I'll readjust my thoughts on the matter accordingly.</br></br>  <br>Zenkai boosts ended up having diminishing returns.</br>  <br>Being 18 is suffering. <br> And then marrying a cute short guy that loves you for who you are, not what you've become <br>But not too much suffering.</br></br></br>  <br> marrying a manlet with awful hair <br>Endless suffering.</br></br>   wasting his talent <br>Gohan never had a talent for fighting, just high powerlevel. In terms of actual martial arts skill, he was always bottom tier IMO. Goku even when he was outmatched still put up a damn good fight because of his skill, Gohan just got his ass beat because he couldn't overpower his opponent with sheer powerlevel.</br>  <br>Goku said he could've probably beaten the original Majin Buu but opted to let Trunks and Goten try to do so instead.<br><br>Goku tried to transform into SSJ3 to fight Kid Buu confident that doing so would result in him winning. He wasn't able to gather the energy needed transform because he was now alive. SSJ3 is an incredibly taxing form. Had Goku let Kid Buu kill him (since they're in the afterlife, Goku would've presumably just popped right back there, just like Old Kai when he gave Goku the rest of his life), he'd've been able to go SSJ3 and mop the floor with Kid's little pink ass.</br></br></br>  <br>well he is a prince after all</br>  <br>IN CASE YOU'RE FIGHTING IN THE DARK.</br>  <br>That's just bashing Gohan for no reason. He had good mentors and developed his skill over time. He just doesn't like fighting, that's all.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Gohan always relied on getting those sudden burst of power to fuck things up. Otherwise he's pretty shit.</br>  <br>What? Uh, Gohan was taught by two of the best fighters in the universe how to fight. First Piccolo in preparation for the Saiyans, then Goku and Piccolo in preparation for the androids, and then Goku again in preparation to fight Cell. That's on top of the actual battle experience Gohan has.<br><br>Gohan just didn't have the desire to be the strongest and it was very rare for him to even want to kill someone. Throughout all of Dragon Ball Z, I think the only two characters he wanted dead were Cell and Super Buu. Maybe Frieza too but he never outright stated it like he did to Cell and Super Buu.</br></br></br>  How many times are we getting over this?<br><br>Gohan was turned into weaksauce because due to editors clamoring and popularity polls Goku's removal would've harmed sales.<br><br>Cell saga was supposed to be passing the torch to Gohan, with Goku dying and Gohan finally manning up to defend the earth not because he likes fighting, but because he was the strongest defender left.<br><br>Go read up on this, whole Buu saga was supposed to be from Gohan's perspective</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you think she vibrates while inside her womb? :3</br>  <br> Gohan was taught by two of the best fighters in the universe how to fight. <br>Which makes it even more pathetic how garbage he is.<br><br>If you actually look back on every single one of Gohan's canonical fights, he's never displayed in actual feats of skill. He's always relied on just getting power ups to outclass the opponent, not outskill them. The saiyans, freezer, cell, buu, all the same fucking story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about the in-universe perspective.<br><br><br>Neither did Vegeta. And honestly, neither did anyone after the World Tournaments in Dragon Ball. Guldo was the last character to try to win by tactics, and he got rekt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku never fought Super Buu.<br>Goku and Vegeta fought Super Buu with 3 people absorbed, yes.<br><br>Cuckboi Gohan and Gotenks were the only fighters who fought unfused Super Buu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>N-No, Gohan is awesome..<br><br> Saiyans <br> gets his ass kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds before almost getting killed <br>H-He was just a kid..<br><br> Freiza <br> gets his kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds then almost gets killed <br>H-He was the strongest in the universe, it's unfair..<br><br> Cell <br> gets his ass kicked for 10 episodes then gets super powerup to be cool then gets his arm blow off <br>I-It was a cheap shot..<br><br> Buu <br> gets blown up and nearly killed, comes back with super ultra mega powerup then goes retard and lets buu get better powerup <br> gets his ass kicked hard <br>I-I don't know..<br><br>G-Gohan is pro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Neither did Vegeta <br>Besides that whole matching Goku blow for blow in an even fist fight.</br></br>  <br>How does that demonstrate skill rather than raw power?</br>  <br>Because the power is meaningless when both guys have the same power. Although Goku was holding back his power level, he wasn't holding back on the fighting. It comes down to actual fighting skill and Vegeta was matching Goku.</br>  <br> Saiyans <br> gets his ass kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds before almost getting killed <br><br>Yeah, and he also gave (an albeit weaker) Vegeta a tough time all by his own. Proof that when power levels are equal Gohan doesn't suck.<br><br> Freiza <br> gets his kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds then almost gets killed <br>This isn't really fair.<br><br> Cell <br> gets his ass kicked for 10 episodes then gets super powerup to be cool then gets his arm blow off <br>He DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT. He seriously thought he could convince Cell of a more peaceful alternative.<br><br> Buu <br> gets blown up and nearly killed, comes back with super ultra mega powerup then goes retard and lets buu get better powerup <br>This does not involve any lack of skill you dumbfuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A draw between two people who are equal is not a show of skill. A victory over someone stronger than you is a show of skill. Not that it matters because Goku could've one-shotted Vegeta using his real power if he had actually wanted to.</br>  <br> A draw between two people who are equal is not a show of skill. <br>Yeah, having equal fighting talent to one of the greatest martial artists in the universe is not a show of skill. Are you daft? The fact that they were equal means he's not better than Goku but it shows he's a great fighter in his own right.</br></br>  <br> Goku could've one-shotted Vegeta using his real power if he had actually wanted to. <br>And? That's just powerlevel and not fighting skill which is the whole argument against Gohan.</br></br>  <br>Goku was intentionally holding back. He was matching Vegeta blow-for-blow, not the other way around.<br><br>That fight showed how skilled and restrained Goku could be. It didn't indicate a thing about Vegeta's fighting prowess.</br></br></br>  Boo arcs magical absortion power-ups are the lowest point of the manga. Thankfully that shit was like 5 15-page manga chapters; Toei just extended that trash endlessly.  <br>Goku held back his power level and nothing else. Are you so stupid that can't differentiate between power and skill? I guess Gohan during the Raditz invasion was a more skilled fighter than Goku?</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/wlezAx74bPQ?t=407  [ ]<br><br> Gohan will NEVER be this alpha ever again </br></br>  <br>Goku intentionally going blow-to-blow with Vegeta doesn't indicate anything about Vegeta's skill. I could "fight" a 5-year-old to a draw, too, by mimicking every move they make. Doesn't mean the damned 5-year-old is a good fighter on a technical basis.<br><br>None of them had any real fighting skill when Raditz came. It was still very much amateur hour then.</br></br></br>  <br>Except it does. Goku was fighting at a SSJ2 powerlevel and so was Vegeta, the rest came down to skill. I'm beginning to think you're just a moron.<br><br> None of them had any real fighting skill when Raditz came <br>DBZ babby detected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he is beyond his max and he had more potential than anyone. goku or any other saiyan we knew at the time becoming stronger is just shit writing</br>  <br><br>Of course he is. He's a manchild that only cares about eating and fighting. He's so dumb he refused to destroy Dr.Gero's lab before he finished the androids because he wanted a good fight.<br><br>For fucks sake he even let his 10 years old son almost die against Cell because "tis gonnbe gut trust me!"</br></br></br></br>  <br> None of them had any real fighting skill when Raditz came <br>Top kek. Literally the arc after Goku became a pro martial artist from training at Kami's.</br></br>  <br>DB was all about skill you fucking invalid, it wasn't this explosion filled nonsense you call a series that it is now.</br>  <br>You're not wrong.</br>  <br>And Earthlings knew fuck all about actual combat then.</br>  Would /a/ explain pregnancy to her?  <br>Sex.</br>    <br>who needs to explain when you can do a live demonstration</br>  Did she cum in the gym?  <br>doujins fucking when</br>  <br>No, but everyone else did.</br>  tfw you have to wait for this weekly because no one is TLing the mango<br><br>Give me my pretty autistic green haired lab rat</br></br>  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Maybe not, she's already used to watching her flies fuck</br>  <br>The manga seems kind of crap compared to the anime.</br>  <br>this guy has to have a lot of self-control not to pitch a tent there</br>  <br>Japan has taught us that women can't win against cock, and she's getting a good whiff right there.<br><br>She's done for.</br></br></br>  I would thoroughly know her up, OP.  <br>Is she a student or a teacher?</br>  <br>Student.<br><br>You not watched the episode yet?</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, no one is translating the LNs either<br><br>You actually have to be an animeonlyfag unless you can read moon</br></br></br>  <br>Im bad at explaining things , so i'll just provide a live demo.</br>  <br>I would.</br>  truly, AOTS  <br>Anime Kajo makes my dick so fucking hard<br><br>And the fact that she's that lewd makes it go straight past diamond mode<br><br>I was literally half chub to full erect that entire episode</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course, such a disgusting lack of knowledge in basic biology is nothing short of sin.<br><br>The state of their education is horrifying.

The sperm can then travel up through the cervix, into the uterus, and, if an egg is present, the sperm may fertilize it.<br>It is also possible ‚Äî but less likely ‚Äî for women to become pregnant through any kind of sex play in which semen, or ejaculate, comes in contact with the vulva. The sperm can travel through the moisture on the vulva into the vagina.<br>Another way for a woman to get pregnant is through alternative insemination. During alternative insemination, sperm are inserted into a woman‚Äôs vagina or uterus using a syringe or other device. The sperm may come from a woman‚Äôs male partner, or from a donor. When a sperm donor is used, the procedure is sometimes called donor insemination. Alternative insemination is an option for single women, women who have women partners, or for couples who are dealing with infertility.<br>A woman who is dealing with infertility may also get pregnant through other fertility treatments like in vitro fertilization. To do this, a woman‚Äôs eggs are taken out of her body and combined with sperm. Then, one or more of the fertilized eggs are implanted back into the uterus.</br></br></br></br></br>   Talks about ignorance <br> Uses the word "docking" <br>Japan, JAPAN<br>GOOGLE IT FIRST JAPAN</br></br></br>    <br>They aren't actually using the word docking you sperg, they are simply using a random word as a vague euphemism for sex that the necklaces don't pick up on, and then for the sub someone translated it as 'docking'</br>  <br>So the pres is actually a closet pervert?</br>  So when are those things gonna get removed from their necks.

I could no longer delude myself into believing there would be more.<br>in fact, I once had azusa come to me in a dream.

Maybe they'll surprise us, but it's looking shaky.<br><br>OP:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UNj<wbr>HxhljAck</wbr>  [ ]<br>OP MV:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mW-<wbr>JAiZcGbU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>It's been licensed by Sentai Filmworks, so even though it doesn't say it now, it's highly likely CR will be subbing this show. We've also got DameDesuYo and Vivid as the fansub options for the show.<br><br>After a pre screening in Japan a few days ago, someone wrote up a summary of the first episode: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s577<wbr>/sh/492c9cee-25e1-46db-89ec-12b4acc<wbr>36522/46ad5a60b0971771a8aa5ed04afbd<wbr>7fa The most important piece of information to be gleaned from this appears to be that, due to the original GG author being the showrunner of the anime, it appears the anime will move events around e.g. something that happens in Volume 4 happens in the first episode. We'll see if this is a good thing or not.<br><br>Who's excited for the healing moe SoL of the season?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What do you all suggest? <br>I suggest you read the manga, then enjoy watching the anime since they're going to change some shit. It's not too hard to get up to date anyway. There's only like, 35 translated chapters right now.</br></br>  <br>Manga is always the best option.<br>We are not even sure if the anime is going to be a good one.</br></br>  Chapter 36 translated when?  <br>Read the manga.<br><br>The anime is probably going to be bad and the manga is really good. It would be a shame if a mediocre or bad adaptation would spoil a great manga for you.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Based on you all's advice I'll read the manga first after all. Thanks a bunch, anons.</br></br></br></br></br>  Come give Akari a big hug.  <br>ok *hugs akari*</br>  o-okay  <br>Don't use *action*s on /a/.</br>  <br>I'd rather hug Alicia or Akira.</br>  <br>*gives you a hug as well*</br>  What if Akari was your mother  <br><br> *action* </br></br>  <br>Akari, when will the anime going to air?</br>  <br><br>BDs soon.</br></br>  <br>Incest</br>   tfw went to Venice and got lost <br>It felt like a pilgrimage. If you ever have the chance, make the trip, preferably during the off season. <br>It is definitely worth it.</br></br>  Everyday    <br> soon <br><br>Gonna be a while until all 3 of them are out. Is there a chance that they might include english subs?</br></br></br>  <br> Push </br>  <br>Did you travel back in time?</br>  Amanchu is better.  <br>That's a plump Akari.</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>There is a lot of GER power scale arguments, but outside of Giorno's plot armor stand, is there any stand that could possibly defeat the green baby realistically?<br><br>Anyone or anything that gets close just stays the same distance as they approach it getting smaller until they are erased at the zero point. <br><br>C-moon seems light a complete downgrade from Green Grass of home.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does the effect work in stopped time?</br>  <br>Anything that doesn't require physical contact could defeat him. Green Day, Grateful Dead, probably Hanged man, Heavy Weather, Highway to Hell, Jail House Rock, Doobie Wah. <br>It's a purely defensive stand, but it's defense has a lot of holes. C-Moon at least has some offensive capabilities.</br></br>  stroheim is best brojo  <br> green day <br>Mold still has to reach him. the altitude is just where it spreads, but it'd never reach him.<br><br> Grateful dead <br>Is the baby a vampire, a tree, or human? how would that even work on him? It looks like the stand only works on humans.<br><br> hanged man <br>light still would have to travel to get to the baby. It'd hit zero. <br><br> Heavy Weather <br>This might work with the Oxygen. but rain, lightening, and poison frogs would all hit the zero point.<br><br> Highway to hell <br>does he have to make contact or does he just have to look at someone to infect them with it? If its just sight, then yeah that would work.<br><br> jail house rock <br>That has to make contact. Zero point. And even still, what is memory loss gonna do to him?<br><br> doobie wah <br>tornado and stand would shrink and hit the zero point.<br><br> purely defensive <br>If the baby had the will, he could just run at people until they shrink to be killed by large things or until they reach the zero point. <br><br><br>Well its a constant effect, and like magnet fields, those work during time stop. So SP and World would still shrink and hit zero if they moved towards the baby in time stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>D4C: Love Train?</br>  <br>That's also a definsive stand. The only offense it has is redirecting "bad" things, which would not be able to hit the baby, so no.</br>  <br>Then my only option left is Cream since it goes in a different dimension when it erases matter. GGGOH is quite the defesnsive Stand.</br>  <br> Green Day <br>The mold would just spring out of the baby as soon as he crawled downhill, it never has to approach the baby. <br><br> Hanged man <br>In order to teleport into the baby's eye, yes the light would need to hit it. But I'm pretty sure that in order to attack from a mirror no light needs to touch the baby.<br><br> Bites the Dust <br>I just thought of this, which would work to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't know why they didn't give pucci and the baby a GHA in ASB before he finished saying the heaven chant it totally could have worked if each of his stands had an individual HHA and GHA<br><br> whitesnake <br>HHA: disk steal<br>GHA: throws you at the baby, you shrink, and then green grass of home would fuck your tiny shit<br><br> C-moon <br> HHA: have pucci step on a wall or girder sticking out of the ground or something and shift the gravity and then a fuckton of projectiles fly at the enemy <br> GHA: Time for Heaven <br><br> Made in Heaven <br>HHA: speeds up time even more, making the enemy slower than even before<br><br>GHA: instawin. Slices enemies face and ends the universe. Requires 3 bars.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Supers for Made In Heaven <br>Absolutely not. The slowdown effect is just enough to wail down on your opponent.</br></br>  <br> GHA: instawin. Slices enemies face and ends the universe. Requires 3 bars. <br>never design a fighting game</br></br>  <br><br>If your opponent was stupid or bad enough to allow you to reach Heaven then that should be enough. The slowdown and easy timeout win is like adding salt to the wound. Story as Jolyne was pretty fun when you try to cheese Pucci as much as possible at that point. Playing as Pucci was ridiculous</br></br>  <br>Fuugo Stand.</br>  Risotto can beat it since he can turn the iron in its body without touching it from a distance of 10m.<br>Weather report can too since the slug power is nothing but an illusion.</br>  <br>Imagine if GGGOH was the stand of a grown person. Its be the most danger offensive stand as simply running at you enemy would kill them by bringing the zero point to them.</br>  <br> risotto <br>10 meters, which means he'd have to get in range, and he'd shrink getting in range and never actually get in range by the halved distance. Also the baby is a plant, so no iron in it like a human. So he'd have to attack it with outside iron. And bringing anything into GGGOH range will hit zero point before it can harm it.<br><br> Weather  <br>Slug power only affects animals, baby is a tree. And even if it did, that wouldn't kill the baby, it would just make it a slug. And the slug eaters that try and get it would all hit Zero in its range. But it's oxygen in a closed room could possibly kill it. <br><br><br>Purple haze's range is too short to be able to punch it. And even at night with no sunlight to stop it and the wind carrying it towards the baby, the virus would shrink and hit zero before making contact with the baby.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its not necessary touch the baby, just puch a rock or the earth for active the virus. Abouth the virus, little or big objective is not great difference.</br>  It just hit me that Green Baby's design is actually really cool. I wish we had seen it grown up.  <br>Pretty sure you can get 10m distant from him without being shrank at all. Also plants do have iron in them.</br>  <br>Nero definitely could get in range, he'd just be tiny. I don't think ten meters was anywhere near the "zero point" you keep talking about, Jolyne and Anasui got closer than that.<br><br>And plants do have iron you dumbass, ever heard of spinach?</br></br></br>  <br>But the virus hit zero before it touches the baby.</br>  I can't tell what's happening in this comic.  <br>madoka and madoka2 gets killed by made in heaven</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51300492<br><br>Just read the whole thing. I think I'm missing something because I never watched the show.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I watched the show too and I still have no idea what's going on<br><br>also I can't speak moon</br></br></br>  <br>Because you don't need them? Whitesnake and C-Moon are strong enough without them and if you manage to get to heaven and lose somehow, it's your fault.</br>  Why was white snake able to fuck up Annasui and FF so fast?  <br>Because Araki wanted Pucci to achieve Heaven.</br>  <br>He got the drop on them.</br>  <br>Fate.</br>  <br>Bohemian rhapsody and underworld</br>  <br><br>Tusk IV probably could hurt the babby since the spin will always exists ( like it exists beyond dimensional walls or stopped time ). <br>Maybe it could reach the baby, considering it is a rather OP stand.<br><br>The Sun probably could defeat the baby.<br><br>Rolling Stones. If the Stone starts to roll at the Green Baby, it would be never be able to reach it, thus breaking and damning the Baby to die a horrible death?<br><br>Death 13 might be able to, depends if Green Baby sleeps. Probably not.<br><br>Bites the Dust might work, but it might not trigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about Tusk act 4. Thing's unstoppable because it transcends gravity.</br>  <br>king crimson might work since things stop happing to it during skipped time, see how he got out of this despite being in the process of getting punched and the bullets with rissoto</br>  <br>Which of the gravity based stands is the strongest? There's surpringly a lot of them however c-moon is usually the one I think of the most.</br>   rereading part 6 <br> this appears <br>Really araki? Pretty sure 90% of part 6 stands would whoop Star Platinum's ass</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that's hyperbole.</br>  <br>Things don't stop happening during KC ability,they do happen but a considerably slower speed than KC. Remember the blood drop thing?</br>  Could Green Baby kill Demonbane  <br>even some of the part 3 and 5 stands could have beaten top form jotaro</br>  <br> the fucking meat rat. </br>  <br>What I meant was things can't harm kc but kc can harm other things. When he was getting hit he should have had something like when jotaro punches dio during stopped time since everything is still moving. However kc the hit continues and kc moves past it despite him being hit prior to skipping.</br>  <br>It wasn't really strong,it's just jotaro being retarded.<br> oh look its stand is shooting something <br> better catch the bullet mid air oh wow I'm so cool right </br></br></br>  <br>Bruno's punch just made contact, Diavolo used KC ability and in that moment Bruno's punch became considerably slower letting KC avoid it.</br>  <br>I want to argue but you're right. Fuckin' Jotaro</br>  <br>btw, is there some translation for jojo-a-go-go!?</br>  <br>blood drop works because KC keeps inertia and movement working, but nothing else<br><br>blood flow still happens, but you can't get harmed because bullshit stand rules</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eUX<wbr>nBG9nYvA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The concept of Joseph not being able to get a date is vastly amusing</br></br>  <br>I always just remember it by "time skips for everyone else BUT Diavolo". <br>Things happen, people will perform actions like eating pastry, but they will not remember it, just notice the time skip occasionally.</br></br>  <br>that implies Diavolo could kill them, but he can't, the only thing he can do is move stuff around, like moving them inside bars and over cliffs so when time gets erased they're still harmed by something that happens after time resumes</br>  <br>But he did kill narancia during time erase</br>  <br>I literally addressed that, he just moved her inside bars, so the killing happened outside the period of erased time. Erasing time only keeps movement done during the timeskip.</br>    Let's assume that Diavolo lost that fight against Risotto<br>How would Giorno's gang beat him? Unlike Diavolo,he's pretty competent at what he does.</br>  <br>snipe him with aerosmith<br>just like he did<br><br>fucking OP stands</br></br></br></br>  <br>TO BE FAIR<br><br>Joseph was probably too busy being mad Holly was leaving him to get married to one 'a them filthy Japs we fought in dubya dubya two to notice her face.<br><br> And Weird Al is great </br></br></br></br></br>  Can someone post the picture where Jotaro says read the manga?    <br>Death 13</br>  <br>explain how he breaks mista's gun and pol's binoculars? or cuts of the fortune tellers hand.</br>  <br> moved her inside bars <br> her <br>that aside, how would he move them into him without harming him?</br></br></br>  <br>he destroyed the bars and put him inside<br><br>then the damage to the bars got erased, but his position wasn't<br><br><br>I don't remember how exactly that happened, give me more details</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Hey Ya</br>  <br> yo, avoid this baby <br><br>"winning"</br></br></br>  <br>mista's gun breaks while in his pocket</br>  <br>he moved something inside the gun that made it break when fired, maybe?<br><br>the translation is terrible</br></br></br>  <br>the binoculars are broken despite being fine the page before and they aren't shown being dropped or anything</br>  <br>Maybe you can damage inanimate objects then, shit, does anyone TRULY understand how it works?</br>  <br>BUT IF YOU COULD THEN HOW DID HE GET NARANCIA INSIDE THE BARS<br><br>FUCK<br>DAMN<br>HOW DOES IT WORK?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fortune teller loses his hand and has it put in his other hand mid sentence without noticing, if that was just speed kc puts start platinum to shame.</br>  <br> then the damage to the bars got erased <br>This doesn't make any sense, if he destroyed the bars the bars should just stay destroyed after time is erased. And they did. Diavolo just pushed Giorno's body down and pierced it.</br></br>  <br>then why would the bars fix themselves like said</br>  <br><br>oh good, I just misremembered, my bad<br><br>then I guess damage to inanimate objects remains, like the effects of made in heaven</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Jotaro contact Polnareff before the events of Part 5 to tell him that Josuke could restore his body?</br>  <br>They didn't get fixed,see</br>  <br>This is time stop levels of bullshit.</br>  <br>Because Jotaro is retarded and he was also busy studying dolphins</br>  <br>Because Jotaro is a dick.</br>  <br>Wouldn't this not work since technically the Baby is a stand and sleeping with a stand would bring it inside the dream.<br><br>I don't know the limits of the dream world but im sure you can make it somewhat work.</br></br></br>  <br>it would obviously have a windup and be melee range.</br>  <br>Jotaro didn't know Polnareff got in a wheel chair</br>  <br>Why does everyone fixate on the dolphin thing? <br><br>Jotaro was said to have specialized in sharks AND whales, right? Which would include dolphins but that's not all he studied.<br><br>EXPLAIN THIS MEME</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's still a bad idea</br>  <br>NOTHING<br>MAKES<br>ANY<br>SENSE</br></br></br></br>  <br> Baby is a stand <br>no it isn't</br></br>  <br>I read the manga without /a/ influence and I still thought he was obsessed with dolphins because<br> going from having the most powerful stand in the world to putting dolphins all over your uniform or whatever the fuck that was <br><br>was just jarring</br></br></br></br>  Cheap Trick?  <br>Instant kills usually have a drawback to them. In Guilty Gear, you have to be in a certain mode to use them and you can't use any specials or supers and you will eventually lose health. Here, you're implying that Pucci still keeps his slowdown powers when he does his Galactica Phantom like super as you described it.</br>    <br>Dolphins are cool and rape people<br>Also I don't recall him saying being specialized in sharks,only being a marine biologist which could be anything from shrimps to otters</br></br>  <br>Assuming that it teleports to the baby and doesn't move to it's back then yes, theoretically cheap trick would work.</br>  <br>Josuke and Polnareff would've been buds, right?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PNw<wbr>qZsCBQkQ</wbr>  [ ]<br> start this at 1:24 <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-B<wbr>Bt29m0I8</wbr>  [ ]<br> in sync with this <br> lower the sono chi no sadame so you can hear the lines <br>I am surprised about how it syncs very well with the lines.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He specializes in starfish if we go by his dissertation.</br>  <br>because he had dolphins all over his clothes in lets go hunting</br>  Psst<br><br>Is "Kakyoin dies" still cool to say?</br></br>  <br>He became a marine biologist, and was so obsessed with his work that Joseph tricked him into impregnating and marrying a guidette.</br>  <br>The whale and shark thing was at the end of part 4 when it mentioned he stayed in Morioh to get his doctorate or whatever.

I got the edit from here, I don't think it's an actual volume.</br>  <br>why do I agree with you so much? Part 4 was the ultimate jojo format</br>  <br> It kinda sucks because the only person to legit go in Diamonds are the fatty and that stylist, both of whom are only present for what could amount to half an episode in the actual anime. </br>  <br>animated sitcom of josuke/okaysu/koichi would be so fucking good<br><br>there wouldn't be any fights, just every day slice of life shit</br></br></br>  <br>the stylist could be a full episode, the fatty even two, he was on-screen for longer than you think, Harvest arc was pretty long and his death too</br>  <br>now I have to disagree<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Wr9<wbr>ie2J2690</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Josuke will never have his own Yasuho <br><br><br>While I think SBR's plot blows all the others out of the water, I prefer DiU solely because of the comfort factor.

I though i had them but i must have forgotten to move the files or something.  <br> They are now canonically future MILFs. <br>how? what happened?</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>At least try reading the first couple of posts anon.</br>  <br>who is that?</br>  <br>Kiba</br>  <br>to bad, I was hoping i was one of Isseis daughters</br>  <br> too bad <br>nigger, Yumi is a miracle of the chichigami. and SCIENCE! </br></br>  Xenovia is love, Xenovia is life.<br>Xenovia would be best mother, and hottest mother. She'd be all tomboyish to her children, then go weak in the knee's begging for your cock at night.</br>  <br> No kids for Yumi </br>  <br>Yumi is too perfect anon, thats why she cant be part of the series.</br>  <br>how cum Kiba is a girl?</br>  <br> Which will be hottest mom? <br>Akeno<br> And which best mom? <br>Irina<br> Also on child which of them you are most curious? <br>Xenovia's, I want to know more about him/her<br> Your bets on children's genders? (Only Rias is confirmed to have son) <br>Like I said previously, Akeno will be the only other one with a son, the rest will be daughters<br> Which other unconfirmed DDs you also hope to become mothers of Issei's children? <br>Still hoping for Ravel and somehow Sona</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mah nigga your tastes. I can share Xenovia if you want.</br>  <br>SCIENCE!<br><br>Azazel creates a sex changing ray gun, in one story everyone but issei gets hit with it so you had super handsome male Rias and akeno, fem kiba, gasper who looked the same , etc. running around.<br>saddly this story is not translated and we have no illustrations of it either.<br><br><br>then in another side story issei gets sick and all the girls take care of him while wearing nurse outfits, Kiba gets jelly so he goes and gets the gun turns into Yumi and another nurse outfit to take care of issei and help him get better .<br><br><br>those pictures are from the side story, and this is one picture of the other girls as nurses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I actually want Akeno to have a daughter so we can have this scene but with issei and barakiel also sitting besides them all being a happy family.<br><br>also naming her Shuri would also be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>BASED Kiba</br>  <br>Kiba is teaching Issei's and Rias's son swordsmanship. He even call him "sensei".</br>  <br>Pretty much this. <br>Also I can imagine how delicious would have been if Akeno's daughter was huge siscon for Rias's son and constantly tried to seduce him.</br></br>  <br>And now imagine that this body will actually bear child.</br>  <br> Issei doesn't impregnate Kiba <br><br>He couldn't become the harem king.</br></br></br>   You will never get to see Issei conquer Koneko's tight loli body <br> You will never see her get split in half while trying to push out a babby from it </br>  <br> Xenovia would be best mother, and hottest mother. <br>Not would. She WILL.<br>Now is just question which gender her child is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So basically it's FE Awakening: DxD Edition</br></br>  <br>You are not first who say that.</br>  <br><br>Well it was the first I had first of this, so it's what came to mind.</br></br>  <br>had heard*</br>  Show me your creativity, /a/.  No. In order to make a "best seller" you would have to make something bad, since that's what the market demands.  Made this few days back.    Post it.    What creativity?    <br>hah!</br>  <br>Here we go.</br>  <br>Every time. Thanks.</br>  <br><br>Damn it, beat me to it.</br></br>      <br>Love this one</br>    <br> Threadly reminder that you should stop posting that because it's a thing. <br><br> https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3206<wbr>139/1/</wbr> </br></br></br>    <br>10/10</br>          <br>Who writes that? Is it any good</br>    <br>Read it yourself and make up your own mind.</br>    <br>Id watch it 10/10</br>    <br>already done with that new anime coming up</br>  <br>Read the filename of his image.</br>  <br>Coppelion was shit though.</br>  <br>This is actually a good idea for a Key animu.</br>  <br>I wish there was a copypasta of this instead of Keit-ai.</br>  <br>Utsuro no Hako much?</br>  <br>I'm not reading walls of text to find out that what I read were the ramblings of an autist</br>  <br>Love it until the last part. Such a giveaway.</br>  I feel like this would be almost impossible to pull off though    <br>It's like stopping /b/ from posting "nigger", /fit/ from posting about manlets, or /pol/ from posting about Jews.</br>  <br>You should watch the movie Chocolate</br>  Well kinda ran dry after about 5 years though.  <br>You would have to kill the person who posts it.</br>  <br>HakoMari where worst the girl who  caused timeloop in vol.1   wins?</br>  <br> person <br><br>People, anon. Like trying to kill everyone who posts FOR YOU.</br></br></br>  <br>That would be extremely difficult.</br>  <br>Anybody willing to translate that into Japanese to spread the word of it to Nihon?</br>  Soon.  I just want to hug Yuuya and tell him it'll all be okay, you're the main character  <br>Plus they finally took the concept of Duels to their logical conclusion.</br>  <br>But what if  they force Yuzu to pull a Bruno ?</br>  <br>Odd Eyes Changes<br> Mouth got smaller <br> Got an eyepatch <br> Massive ring on his back <br> Tail is longer and fatter and has a different pattern then before. <br> His arms are way different <br> He went from red to fully dark purple as a main color. <br> His hands changed design <br> His knees and feet have extra half circle stuff on them and so do his elbows. <br> His neck and head spike are really different now. <br><br>Hope Changes<br> He has extra wings <br> He is now grey <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127782304#p127787581">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would just make him feel like a bigger target</br>  LOL<br><br>WHY ARENT YOU WATCHING AOTS?</br></br>  <br>It looks like a show that would be improved by it's adaptation. <br>The manga is by Yuzuki N Dash though.<br><br><br> responding to shitposting </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>daiz not sure if you've answered already but have you seen HS rip of OverLord?<br><br>frame drops out the ass everywhere. Me and a friend watched it and they got the same issue.<br><br>Is it due to an encoding issue or did it really air like that?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've only read the first volume, and I would say not really, no, unless you're desperate to spoil the anime for people.</br>  <br>Not him. Did it do this in more than one media player?</br>  God damn she's hot  Myuugi will always be the strongest character within the medium along with Hajun.<br><br>Demonbane is NOT capable of killing omnipotents, just like everyone else.</br></br>  <br>Each Demonbane summoned by Athletha Aeternum is unique.<br>The possible explanation that Hakaishin Demonbane is able to grind all Demonbane to dust is that he was the Paradoxical Evil Demonbane that is stronger than every Demonbane ever. <br>It is not a hard stuff thinking that EGD itself is a paradox.</br></br></br>  <br>Not fresh enough.</br>  <br>Well, it's nice to be a newfag like you. <br> in the past years <br>Now you visit the archive, see for yourself when it was written for the first time and go crawl under your bed crying.<br><br><br>I've read the novel. Once again, since you haven't done it: there are 2 ways to follow in Umineko. Magic or Mystery. Initial novel doesn't give an exact answer which way is reality, so you can choose any of them. If you choose mystery, then Featherine doesn't exist. So you can't talk about her powerlevel etc. If you choose magic, she exists: this is why Featherine talk here is based on magic part of Umineko. Japs who do it just force the mystery part of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what about fresh?</br>  <br>Nothing compared to the top tier powerlevel character. She is babbys tier.<br><br><br> Look MOM I posted it again, this will surely teach those demonbanefag how my character is the strongest. <br>I am the one who felt sorry for you falling to such a shitty Featherinememem copy pasta. That copy pasta is as bad as Full Possession Shurouga made by /m/eme</br></br></br></br></br>  ITT:Redraw a famous scene on MS Paint      <br>Who is this ?</br>  <br> ayy dio whats up <br> nothing, just crossing the street </br></br>  work in progress, will finish later  Anime where the characters are adorable and nicely designed, but the anime sucks.  <br>The glitter texture and that fabric texture, a show that focuses a lot on clothing design benefits hugely from 3DCG.</br>  <br>There is too much detail for it to be 2D, I don't think any series has that level of detail in costums when it comes to dances.<br>See this and tell what kind of budget you will need to make it 2D, notice the camara movements and the clothes the characters use.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=neG<wbr>l3_4_ZLE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>CG requires a lot of budget too... <br><br>And the camera angles wouldn't exist if they weren't doing CG anyway. They'd have to do actual camera angles like Idolm@ster does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thought to be honest, THAT cg doesn't suck. I probably wouldn't mind watching that.</br>  <br>See a dress like this, it has kaleidoscope coloring that constantly changes its color when she moves, sure you could add filters on 2D dress but that would be just weird and it flows much better on 3D.<br><br><br> budget <br>Stop. Just like 2D animation, 3D animation needs someone talented working on it so it will look good.<br><br> And the camera angles wouldn't exist if they weren't doing CG anyway. <br>I don't even get your point anymore. By "actual camera angles" in Im@s you mean the face shots because then they don't have to animate the entire dance all the time, or what?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
