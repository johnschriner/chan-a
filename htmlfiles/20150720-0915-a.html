[ Mozarella<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br>    <br>Well 2006 was 2 years after part 7 started so i'm sure he has changed his mind with all the cool and interesting characters he has created now</br>  <br>None as relatable as Josuke, though.</br>  <br>I'm talking about the whole list in general and again, you never know. Part 7 has amazing writing and amazing characters. As far as his favorite JoJos I can't see Johnny replacing Josuke but Gappy MIGHT be his new favorite</br>  Jojolion 45 photo raws:<br> http://tieba.baidu.com/p/390490144<wbr>1?fr=frs</wbr> <br><br>EoH to have no paid DLC/Microtransactions.

He's a weirdo who gets into the lewdest antics.<br><br/></br></br>   karera changed her shoes <br><br>damn it araki you needed the foot practice</br></br>  What is the melody to "Pizza mozzarella"  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dy7<wbr>J9q-eWmE</wbr>  [ ]</br>         tfw no Hotpants x Johnny doujinshi <br>why live?</br>    <br>Johnny should always be fucked. He should never do the fucking. <br><br><br> Not him actually. Pastebinanon.  </br></br></br></br>  <br>That seems really subdued for some reason<br>I'd always imagined it to be more of a jingle</br></br>  <br>JoJo rule of doujins: If it's not gay, it doesn't exist.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128311999 <br>You underestimate just how little practice Joseph's had at that point.<br><br>He makes up for it by being a slut later, but at that point you would NOT want a deep kiss from him.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, all I want to see is a Hotpants and Johnny doujinshi. I'm at the point where I'd literally pay money for one.<br> Johnny deserves to not be the bottom once in his life </br></br>  <br> I'm at the point where I'd literally pay money for one. <br>What's stopping you?<br>Anything can be bought and sold for the right oil</br></br></br>   caring about Hot Pants <br>OK so it's the same thing as Yukako where she's basically the only girl so everyone acts as if she's hot shit when really their penis just doesn't have any standards.</br>  Gay Priest will be arriving soon. There was some bad weather stalling his arrival.  <br>But that's Donatello.</br>  <br> Not Heavy Weather <br>Blahblahblah one job etc etc yakity shmackity.<br><br>Also JoJo/FHFIF crossover when? the Home just gets all the Part 3 Stands dumped on their doorstep for no apparent reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, Sweet Child of the Lord. You're correct. <br>But Gay Priest will still be here.</br></br>  <br> That UJ cover </br>  <br><br>Gay Priest is here now.</br></br>  <br> Star Platinum and The World eternal prank war that gets the whole house caught up at times <br> Hermit Purple pretty much exists as just a tangle of vines so it hitches rides on the others as needed <br> Magician's Red has to try and contain its arsonistic tendencies lest it burn the house down <br> Hierophant Green angst about being abandoned and whether anyone will want to adopt it <br><br>Sign me up</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw he's here. </br>  MOZARELLA  Hey guys I'm reading part 4 right now. Give me a fitting album to listen while I'm reading.  <br>Rohan Dies by Okuyasu Dies.</br>  <br> Death 13 has an irrational fear of Chocolate pudding. <br> The Empress refuses to leave, for any reason. <br> Strength has taken a more "reasonable" shape. <br> The Fool refuses to use a litter tray. <br><br>This is getting more and more hilarious, how do we handle The Emperor and the 9 gods though?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ZA WARUDO    <br>Alright, finally, a real fight. It seems one of the twins abilities is to use and control whatever he touches with his left hand with his right so that means he might not be a rock person</br>  <br>Haha. What a trip, that's the part I'm reading right now.</br>  <br>The Dio cosplayer looks like it ended up as a new Joker cosplay somehow</br>  <br>Damaged Joker?</br>  <br>Yeah well, DIO comes back.<br><br>Take that.</br></br></br>  <br>Atum should be a NEET gamer, that's a fact</br>  <br>Strength is a little steamboat that lives in the bathtubs. The female residents have to check very carefully before they start a shower</br>  <br>Fuck, stop reminding me of this fucking asspull.  Diavolo vs. DIO was based though. </br>  <br>I'd love he communicated through the soul-speak thing.<br> "Oh cmon! I lost again! You cheated didn't you?" <br> NO NO NO NO NO </br></br></br>  <br> DIO comes back <br>Jesus, how the hell did they explain that one? I almost want to stop reading now. His head fucking exploded.</br></br>  <br>Keep reading and find out</br>  <br><br>He actually lived through Joseph, then he stole Jotaro's body and remodeled his face.</br></br>  <br>Pretty cool.</br>  <br>How else did you think he ended up in 6?</br>  <br>Tha's fucking hilarious, it's like those Joestars keep falling for that shit. I'm not even mad I got spoilered.<br><br>I heard part 6 is about Jotaro's daughter, so I figure she sets out to kill him after all that stuff?</br></br></br>  <br>I already knew about that, faggot. Try harder.</br>  <br> Star Platinum=Bloo <br> Hermit Purple= Coco <br> Silver Chariot= Eduardo <br> Hierophant Green= Wilt <br> The Fool= Cheese <br> The World= Duchess <br><br>In broad strokes of course but that's how I'd imagine it'd work, for the core cast anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   No one is discussing the new chapter raw and instead are shitposting about Dio and Gay Priest memes <br>It's becoming hard to defend this general</br>  <br>His body was still alive even without the brain, because vampire. When they started the blood transfusion to save Joseph, DIO forced his own blood into Joseph's body, leaving only Joseph's own blood behind in DIO's body.<br><br>After outrusing Jotaro, he lived a few years as Joseph to get used to the body, when Suzie Q finally died he changed his appearance to how he used to be and moved to Italy to support his son from the shadows.<br><br>With this new body he can dual wield Hermit Purples and use The World to stop time for a maximum of 27 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pucci is fine, but oh god that DIO...</br>  How do you pronounce  Pucci <br><br>A vacaroo will be greatly appreciated.</br></br>  <br>Poo-chi</br>  <br>What about stealing Jotaro's body like the other anon said?  Did he cry when Giorno died? </br>  <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s1XmcCu119eP</br>  <br>Poochie, like the dog he is.<br><br> Calling him "Pookie" is strictly reserved for Dio </br></br></br>  <br>That guy's stand(?) power immediately reminded me of Joy Division, with that hand swap thing.</br>  <br>DIO's been a meme for years. Gay Priest is just a fad though.</br>  <br>I dunno what that guy was on about, Jotaro drowns while researching the mating rituals of dolphins.<br><br>After Giorno died DIO stops caring about ruling the world and goes full NEET, with Pucci occasionally visiting him for slice of life shenanigans.</br></br></br>  <br> drowns <br>But that water is really shallow, and I can see a trail of blood...are you messing with me?</br></br>  <br>It's retarded either way when actual discussion could be happening <br><br> Gay Priest is just a fad though. <br>Yeah, a 3 or so month fad, this shit needs to stop already</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can drown in an inch or less of water you dumbass.</br>  <br>Would Pucci and Giorno get along? He was okay with DIO's other sons and made them stronger.</br>  <br>I don't think Giorno would approve of Pucci's actions. Pucci would probably like Giorno though, he's a lot like Dio and he's the least of a fuck-up among Dio's sons by a WIDE margin.</br>  <br>Priestposting starting during a memespouting contest back when Autismtrain and Heavenposting back in febuary. It's not going away since it also shows up v,vg, and co.</br>  <br>But Jotaro was a badass and he could swim as seen in the fight with the ship captain. And it doesn't explain the blood anyway. You're bullshiting me aren't you?</br>  <br> gay priest <br> also shows up v,vg, and co <br>treachery</br></br></br>  <br>He drifted ashore, that's how the found him in the first place.<br><br>The blood is from the still unknown injury that caused him to drown. I think Araki forgot about it by now so don't expect that to ever be answered.</br></br></br>  <br>Priest posting happened after a funny discovery on the wiki with the pucci_after image but people turned it into a retarded meme that's wore than autismtrain. <br><br> it also shows up v,vg, and co. <br>This general is REALLY hard to fucking defend with those kind of autists</br></br></br></br>  New chapter up soon.  I don't think there's any 'anticipation' for this shit anymore.<br> also be prepared to be flooded with /co/tards starting August. Thanks Toonami </br>  <br>GOOK SCANS WHEN</br>  <br>Niggastream &amp; the gooks are at fault for that.</br>  <br>Tashiro said on his twitter the new chapter will be exciting and interesting.</br>  <br>Who gives a shit anymore?<br><br>Sure. He wants to spark up some interest but this is already over. He'd better rush the thing and start something else.</br></br></br>  <br> implying we give a fuck about this. </br>    <br>I want to believe</br>  <br>Into the trash it goes.</br>  <br>You keep saying that but the manga killed itself.</br>    <br> AgK <br> Anticipation Thread </br></br>  nobody anticipates akg  <br> he wasn't around for the 3000 replies mega threads <br>I pity you anon</br></br>  <br> Tashiro said his manga is gonna be exciting and interesting <br>So is he trying to promote his turd because interest is utterly dead or because even him knows that previous chapters were boring shit?</br></br>  mine is kill soon I just can't wait anymore  <br>This is 2015 anon. Have you been living under a rock for the last 6 months?</br>  When will Toonami finally die? So tired of hearing how great AoT is. Just wait for the AgK love....  <br> youtube thumbnail <br> chibi reviews <br>holy shit kill yourself</br></br></br>  This series main plot was basically killing everything, funny enough it even killed itself...well, except mine because tatsumi needs a vegetable to fuck.   Toonami is airing the anime <br><br>Seriously? That was one of those "why did they even bother" adaptations. Animation? What's that?</br></br>  What happened to chapter 61? Did it have a month off, or was last month's chapter never scanned?  <br>There wasn't a chapter last month, you dickhead.</br>  <br>Gonna take more than a bit of teasing to make this hype again.</br>  <br>It was LITERALLY 2015 6 months ago you fucking retard</br>  <br>Looks like Akame IS Kill.</br>  <br><br>Literally BTFO</br></br>  <br>Don't worry anon, I still like it.<br><br>The pacing with half chapters, skipping months and nothing happens chapters, however, it's killing it.</br></br></br>  I want to be balls deep in Akame.  <br> Let's name the manga after her and then give her a bullshit move that forces us to never give her any screen time <br>Top Tashiro</br></br>  <br>This, it's a hassle to follow this shit because how wierdly the chapters are being released for an ongoing series</br>  <br>You mean Takahiro. Tashiro is the artist.</br>  <br> completely forgot AGK existed <br>Fuck it's been too long.</br></br>  <br> I watched the shitty "adaptation" that based was based on nothing but the same name as a popular manga <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>because the whole manga is being written from the viewpoint of Akame.</br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>English speak you do?</br>  <br>ようやく校了しました。今月号は面白カットいっぱい作ったから楽しみにして<wbr>て下さいね。単行本の特典関係も目一杯頑張ったので是非ともゲットして下さ<wbr>い。「夏！」って感じですよー<br>https://twitter.com/endergate01/sta<wbr>tus/620829286694436864</wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> that based was based on nothing but the same </br>  <br><br>I'm on my phone, remove the first "based" and you've got a sensible sentence you fucking turboautists</br></br>  <br>For fucks sake.<br>It was originally supposed to be "Night Raid" but that was already taken so it got changed to Akame ga Kill.<br>Fucking newfag, has been mentioned numerous times.</br></br></br>  <br>I got what you said, I just don't get what the fuck you're talking about. <br>I didn't watch the anime.</br></br>  <br> I'm on my phone <br> using a phone to post here <br>Destroy yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty based.</br>  <br>Like I give a fuck about reading some anime news network shill piece about this bullshit manga for babies.</br>  <br>looks like new vol cover</br>  <br><br> not using your phone to shitpost in bed in the morning when you're hungover <br><br>You're doing something wrong</br></br></br></br>  Hell, the last chapter was decent. Leone being awesome was something I've waited a while for  <br>At least it was better than the previous one which was easily the worst AgK chapter ever. Even meet dog was better.</br>  This months magazine cover.<br><br>https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CKLe2HG<wbr>UcAABRpF.jpg</wbr></br></br>  What was the point of Wild Hunt again?  <br> posting on phone <br> hungover </br></br>  Manga Version cumming Soon.  <br>I think anime version will look better.</br>  The anime was so bad it made me stop giving a shit. Whats happened since lubbock died and the gang went to go rescue tatsumi?  <br>To be ga Kill.</br>  <br>RIP Leone</br>  <br> being an autist </br>  <br>From whose twitter account did you get that image from?</br>  Dropped after worst girl became a vegetable.  <br>/r/akamegakill</br>  Did /a/ really collectively drop this?<br>Something cataclysmically bad must have happened for everyone to drop it.</br>  Akame a cute.  <br>Filler Rape got finally removed.</br>  <br>Pretty much  but adding unnecessarily characters deaths and Wild Hunt disappointment.</br>  <br>She became  a pumpkin </br>  <br> Wild Hunt disappointment <br>But they're gone. Forever.</br></br>  <br>its like she opens mouth for cock or food.</br>  &gt;Did /a/ really collectively drop this?<br> Mine shippers/waifufags stop caring when she turned into a vegetable <br> Esdeathfags don't care if she's not around <br> going full Naruto <br> focus on remaining WH members most don't care about and them going out like some random filler trash <br>Akames and leones can only do so much.</br></br></br></br></br>  Scans when  <br>300 seconds</br>  <br>Oh finally someone make a thread for this. Well I still interested since I wanted to know what will esdese fate be at the end of the manga.</br>  <br>5 mins</br>  <br><br><br><br>Doesn't help the anime ushered in a big crowd causing a lot of the threads to be unbearable for ages to go along with the shitflinging the manga already generates.<br><br>Now nothing remains, around the decay.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> akame ga shit anticipation <br>What th-<br> youtube manga review <br><br> redditors <br>Figures. Cancer fuck off with this garbage</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> maximum autism </br>  <br>Crawl back to your shithole site</br>  <br>you first faggot</br>  <br>This, next time post tumblr gifs too<br>I mean who gives a fuck about standards, right</br></br>  <br>Urami Koi koi is cute</br>  <br> dem tits <br> dem delicious armpits <br><br>Glorious</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, threads have been pretty dead for a while. <br><br>Will probably remain that way until we get more Esdeath/Tatsumi interaction.</br></br></br>  HAIL THE GOOKS:<br><br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>471278</wbr></br></br>  <br>Don't forget spoiler anon is gone and niggerstream killed all the hype threads, which was one of the main points of reading. The manga is pretty bland apart from the shock value, which spoiler threads did best.<br>Waifufags, like you said, all grew tired and moved on.<br>The anime killed hype for the ending because the second half was so bad. <br>Now toonami I hear? The series is fucking dead. Never has there been a case this bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  AgK is dead already  <br>OMG he is turning into a biological dragon!</br>  IT'S HAPPENING<br><br>HAIL TYRANT<br>A<br>I<br>L<br><br>T<br>Y<br>R<br>A<br>N<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well , other than start of Akame vs Wale and  nothing really happened.</br>  <br><br>We Bleach now</br></br>  <br> Akame vs Wave <br> Tats goes full dragon <br>Skimmed through that crap and I'm 10 chapters behind.<br>Literally who cares, R.I.P. Wave.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's cool.</br>  so probably gonna follow like in the anime with akame vs kurome  <br>We got to see Esdeath with her new move.</br>  <br>Super speedread that shit, no Mine, fucking shit. Re-dropped.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br><br>Replace Kurome with Wave</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Wave kills that bitch</br>  So next month we drink Wavefag tears?  <br><br>doubit because wave is the 2 MC accodiring to takahiro</br></br>  <br>was that her new special move or just one that hadn't been previously showed in the manga?</br>  Does anyone eben remember them all?  <br>Bu but he is better than Tatsumi</br>  <br>lame pun incoming..<br><br>A WAVE of tears.</br></br></br>  Wave a shit and worst girl.  <br> draw perfect and qt grills <br> have them die <br>Why is this allowed?<br><br>Time for Wave to fly again.</br></br></br></br></br>  There are people still reading this?  <br>Spear, Coro, aniki, Sayo, Tatsumi, Mine, Cordelia, Tsukushi can't remember the last one.</br>   Akame vs. Wave <br><br>fuck this shit to be honest</br></br>  <br>Tyrantsumi&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Wave&gt;&gt;Tatsumi</br>  I think he has all the right pieces he needs to fix this manga.<br><br>He needs to establish some more allies and fanservice girls to Tatsumi's team. Along with that, have Tatsumi go down a dark ascent into madness.<br><br>Have him questioning his loyalties and going up to join esdeath because of all the pain he felt being apart of night raid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good hopefully Wave fucking dies so a good girl can win.</br>  I dropped it when Akame was revealed not only to be a super-swordsman, but also Bruce Lee in naked hand combat, which chapter was that?  <br>To think that I used to hype this so much.</br>  <br> they told me I could be anything so I became Tyrant </br>  <br>the last one</br>  <br>That's stupid.</br>  <br>I still don't understand if she is supposed to be big breasted or not.</br>  Guys come on, it's not that bad, let's try and do damage control on this manga. <br><br>/a/ does it for literally EVERYTHING posted here, let's not give up. We need to try and coat the shit with paint and make things seem better.</br></br>  Meh. Re-dropping this till Tyrant fully takes over the manga and shows everyone how shit gets done  <br>Breast size in the manga and the anime fluctuates a lot</br>  <br>And we wouldn't want that, would we now?</br>  <br> 2 covers for Mein <br> 2 covers for Leone <br> 2 covers for Esdese <br> 1 cover for Akame <br><br> Akame ga KILL <br> Akame </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it is shit. Ever since Takahiro decided that no one will die anymore.</br>  he should just make AKG VN  <br>Wave is way too nice. Where all the others just murder and kill, Wave goes and captures them. Like he doesn't even know what happens to prisoners.</br>  <br>That's why I said it.<br><br><br>More like Akame ga Shafted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, budo is given the most ambiguous death in the series, he might be still alive an making a return.<br><br>tyrantsumi might mean we won't need demon mode akame<br><br>mine might die</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The coat is in the way. She is pretty stacked.</br>  <br>In many scenes yes, but not all the time.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>So I guess that's it for Wave. I highly doubt that Akame is going anywhere.</br>  <br>So they will dance around with Esdeath and PM and just become friends?</br>  <br>Akame usually gets the alternative covers. And I'm sure she will be the cover for the last volume.<br><br><br>Mine won't die. If they wanted her dead, she would have died like in the anime instead of becoming a vegetable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that because she flat on the ground?</br>  Here lies Wave, he never won.  <br>No.</br>  <br>You can also grow up and leave threads you don't like.</br>  <br>Ending will be the same as the anime, but with Tats and Mein both alive and well.</br>   wave beat akame before because she couldn't cut his armor <br><br> it is canon that good enough swordsmen can cut through tyrants armor <br><br> yfw she kills wave because she has been practicing armor piercing moves in case tatsumi gets taken over by tyrant </br></br></br></br>    <br>The perfect job to end it all.</br>  <br> Katana <br> armor piercing <br>Wouldn't it just break?</br></br></br>  <br>Not if it's folded over a thousand times.</br>  <br>Akame ga beautiful</br>    <br>It looks the same bust size as this. </br>  <br>And then we get pictures like this where she's just small and her breasts look absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>So, you think that's the canon size? There are plently of pictures like this too.</br>  <br> Akame <br> Good <br><br>HAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br>  Akame would be better off dead then getting the same terrible fate as in the manga.  Is AgK popular again?  Mein is the cutest potato.  <br>while Lubbock pimps the girls in heaven. And this being AgK, there are many of them.</br>  I will fucking burn all of my AgK books if they just kill Wave without even hearing his ideals.  <br>Will probably get a popularity boost soon due to it being on Toonami  unfortunately </br>  <br>Pretty same that scene isn't as detailed as later volumes though.</br>  <br>So now Esdeath can also fly thanks to her teigu. That's not how Ice works.</br>  <br>No happy endings now.</br>  <br>There's not way Akame is going to cut through Grand Chariot, I guess either she uses her triumph card or they'll just stop fighting, or, the most probably one, she'll win with an asspull.</br>   sheere ded <br> aniki ded <br> introduces 2 new NR <br><br> chelsea ded <br> su ded <br> raba ded <br> mine ded <br> 0 new member <br><br>Here's the problem. Takahiro new to create more Main characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, Incursio will get 2 × Pratt &amp; Whitney F119-PW-100 pitch thrust vectoring turbofans to counter that.</br>  Soon.  <br> can't remember Zero's best girl <br>That's Poney.</br></br>  <br>*need</br>  <br> mine ded <br>No.</br></br>    <br>This is the last arc. Introducing new characters now is stupid.</br>   Fucking idiots still charging in on Esdeath <br><br>Why? If you see that bitch you just run for it. I will never understand these underlings that think they can just take on the strongest the enemy has to offer. Also literally who was that giant Black guy? Looked like Budo 2.0.</br></br>  <br>Time stop isn't how ice works either. Its demon blood she ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>I hope now that wild cunts are dead we can finally have a full on Rider fight.</br>  <br>They could just give some RA teigu users better design and characterization and have them interact with NR. Not just give them 2 panel each and then dropped dead.</br>  I don't think I've ever seen a series fall off the wagon quite as hard as AgK.<br><br>Fuck, 10 chapters ago the spoiler threads got to 1000s of replies. The anime really killed this series.<br><br>I realized what having an anime series finish the story off for you really does for a manga. It removes all interest in what happens next because, even if it IS different, the story is already concluded in people's mind. <br><br>Also Budo is the worst character in the story and Mine's "coma" is a complete copout after people bitching about her anime death though it was probably intended for her to die there in both anime and manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>There is also the niggerstream fact.<br>I mean, remember what happened when jag posted here? The threads were full of people hyped for the anime and the manga.<br>Raba losing his balls was the best.</br></br></br>  <br>RA are the bad guys is pretty much confirmed at this point.</br>  <br>Welp, he's dead</br>  <br><br>If esdeath is in front of you you're either going to die running at her or running away, your only hope is somehow surviving an ice barrage and playing dead</br></br>  <br>Nigger you what?</br>  <br>Keep in mind, 10 chapters ago was almost a year ago.</br>    <br> This could've all be avoided if Tatsumi had only chose to go with Esdeath <br><br>Sasuga Tatsumi</br></br></br>  <br>I think Lubbock dying was precisely the moment when I lost all interest in this.</br>  <br><br> underage cross-siters forcing this shit on /a/ <br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  So in what bullshit way is Wave going to die? We all know that Akame can't lose.  <br>What is this Akame vs Wave match-up at the first place?</br>  <br>Better become a monster than go with a monster.</br>  Takahiro has been cleaning house more than giving meaningful deaths for a while. In the beginning it was shocking but it ended up getting tiring. We barely get any world building or character development and everything that happens goes towards some battle where someone dies. It feels like lazy writing.  <br>Akame can't hurt Wave.</br>  <br> Lets name a manga bleach when it has nothing to do with detergents <br>Top Kubo.</br></br>  <br>Dude really it's just as bad as joining a monster.</br>  <br>Not really. Even with that, Tatsumi is 1000 times more human than Esdeath.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>I really want to have her go doki doki after me.</br>   Wave promised himself he will keep away Kurome from fighting <br> Event of the actual chapter <br>Sasuga Takahiro</br></br>  <br>That's why it's going to be bullshit. Unless the two of them come under an understanding about Kurome.</br>  <br>Any gookfags around? TL is strongly needed here.</br>   Tatsumi becomes full dragon <br> Stars dating full demon Esdese <br><br>Only thing that can make this good again.</br></br></br>  Kurome will interfere in some way.  <br>So nothing really happens again the chapter.</br>  <br>And Tatsumi too. The cover spoils it.</br>  <br> mfw Tatsumi rapes Wave </br>  <br> The super acclaimed TV anime </br>  <br>Armor &gt; Murasame.<br><br>Wave managed to fuck her ribs up last time, MU wise Akame is at a huge disadvantage. But this is manga so...</br></br></br>  <br> Kurome sacrificing herself for her Husbando <br><br>Poor Wave will never be with his Waifu.</br></br></br>  <br> Esdeath can fly now <br><br>Takahiro and his asspulls, no wonder this shit is awful.</br></br></br>  <br>can't wait for the dumbass to start pew pewing into civilians.</br>  <br>Tatsumi is far beyond Wave though. This can only end in Wave getting wrecked.</br>  <br>You guys never give up.</br>  <br>The only way to have a fair match is 1 vs 1, no teigus, final destination.</br>  <br> no teigus <br>Tatsumi is already half-dragon now.</br></br>  <br>At this point they're both monsters. It just happens that Esdeath is more of a monster than him.</br>  <br>Tatsumi has fused with his Teigu now though.</br>  <br><br>Okay, Wave with his teigu vs Tatsumi with his bare hands.</br></br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  <br> The super acclaimed TV anime </br>  <br>For me it was when Syura died. Syura sama ;_; I still can't get over it ;_;</br>  i wonder which of the generic background tier character dies next bros <br>this manga is so epic.....teh feels await....... ;____;</br>  <br>lol faggot</br>  <br> lol </br>  <br> literally what he just said. </br>  <br>heres your reply.</br>  <br> .......  <br> ;____; <br/></br></br>  It surprised me that it already airs on German television.  According to logic Wave should beat Akame here. Too bad this is AgK where anything can happen.  Every passing chapter is making me hate Akame more and more. Bitch really should have died to Izou, that would have planed AgK above your average shounen, but no, bitch should be invincible for no good reason.  <br><br> mere hours before chapter spoilers <br> shitposting everywhere <br> recall the day Mine confessed to Takumi <br> shitflinging like it was no tomorrow <br> all the tension that led up to the panel that revealed Chelsea's head on a pike <br><br>Where did it all go? I missed those.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait what? Where? I was supprised to see that Pro7 actually showed Evangelion but which Channel shows this?</br>  <br> Shura  <br>probably the most pathetic death in the whole manga.</br></br>  <br>Most pathetic was Dorothea. But Syura shouldn't have died like that.</br>  <br>Sorry nobody will ever top Budo. Those threads were so fucking funny.</br>  <br>I guess now with that the series hit rock bottom, now it can't get even worst right? Right!?</br>  <br>Merry christmas!</br>  <br>Pro7 Maxx the adds are fucking embarassing.</br>  <br>Not necessary, remember Suzuka vs Tatsumi.<br><br>Akame just need to resist until Wave's armor disappear.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is this happening now? I thought he had 2 more times until this would happen</br>  <br>I DON'T GIVE A FUCK ANYMORE, BUT I SWEAR THAT IF KUROME DIE IMA GO ALLAH AKBAR ON TAKAHIRO ASS, BUYING THE FUCKING TICKETS ALREADY YOU HEAR ME MOTHERFUCKER.</br>  <br> people unironically want another one hit kill from Akame <br><br>Just no, pls Takahiro. Do something fuckin new.</br></br></br>  <br>He is probably not _that_ retarded to do this again. But this akame vs wave thing is pretty surprising. Kurome and Tatsumi will surely show up.</br>   This is just going to follow the steps of the anime with some really minor changes and with a much slower pace <br>Count me out</br>  <br>Gookfag(s) where? What they are talking about seem interesting at least.</br>  <br> Check it out <br> Fucking Stargate is playing <br><br>Welp no Anime with horrible German dub for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tatsumi new final boss?<br> Tatsumi will become such a big threat that going to obligate Esdeath and Akame work together against him. </br></br>  Why can't Tatsumi control Incursio like Esdesu did with that evil blood shit? I thought Incursio was a good boy.  <br>Don't kid yourself.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EQ1<wbr>wvsmmI-I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Oh god they are playing Eva 3.33 this Wednesday</br>  <br>That would be too good for this Manga.</br>  <br>At least the show had budget just for this. Tashiro will struggle pathetically to get it half right like he did with Budo.</br>  <br>That's great but who will be the one who can stop him.</br>  <br>Nah, the moment Wild Hunt become fodder was, at least for me, Wild Hunt was suppose to lead the manga to a new outcome, but at the end nothing happens. I lost all hope already, just waiting if Takahiro decide to give Kuromo a happy ending now.</br>  <br> "good" doujins never. </br>  <br> Sie sind Killer </br>  <br>The one with Leone is really good.</br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Incursio by his nature adapts to every situation or environment, so it makes sense to slowly dominate Tatsumi.<br><br>The demon blood was just evil, but since Esdese is pretty fucked up it doesn't matter.</br></br></br>  <br> German dubs <br>Every single time. It's like Germany never recovered from<br> SASOOKAY, HE'S REALLY COOL <br> SAKURA, DA BYOOTIFOOL </br></br></br></br>  <br>exdeath said he was done being trained or something while she said tatsumi would take years. even though he has the raw power, i think they'd make it so that wave has the skill to compensate for it somewhat. wave would still lose though</br>  <br> I lost all hope already, just waiting if Takahiro decide to give Kuromo a happy ending now. <br>Literally the same for me.<br><br>Anyway, Doya lost her arms against the fagpirate, no?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's the only good one</br>  Whoever called the revolutionaries being just as bad as the empire was right on the money. This manga is Edge incarnate.  <br> Whoever called the revolutionaries being just as bad as the empire was right on the money. <br>The Revolution/Night Raid being as bad as the empire was the intention, but the anime and manga failed hard to deliver. Despite Bulat saying that they're not fighting for justice and little more than hired killers, we factually see Night Raid operating with a quite strict code of conduct. Everyone they kill is evil in one way or another, they've never killed a genuinely good person simply because he's a detriment to the goals of the revolution. We have a few sympathetic guys on the side of the empire, but even they see the corruption of the empire. Most of its warriors (Seryuu, Dr. Stylish, Kurome, Esdeath, the three demons, all of Wild Hunt) are genuinely horrible people.<br><br>So no, Night Raid and the Revolution are nowhere near as bad as the Empire. It'd be interesting if they were as bad or even worse, but Takahiro can't write that well. I repeat: not ONE person associated with the empire we've seen die was a good person (other than maybe some faceless, nameless soldiers and even that is pure speculation).</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the pages of the revolutionaries killing civilians? Or the one where they are talking about enslaving the inhabitants once they kill the Emperor and his associates?</br>  <br> Did you miss the pages of the revolutionaries killing civilians? <br>NR confirmed to be IS.</br></br>  <br>HQ scan when?</br>  what if agk was more of a comedy but everyone still died in the usual gruesome fashion?  <br>dem cat tats</br>   Mdese is alive <br>Yes<br><br><br> Will probably remain that way until we get more Esdeath/Tatsumi interaction <br>It's not like they can any other interaction that fighting at this point, so it's pretty meh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like early Attack on Titan it's like Game of throne genre which each chapter a person is killed.</br>  <br>Yes, I miss those. Unless that happens in this new chapter, I don't remember that things happening.</br>  <br>they can have*</br>  <br>Are you retarded? Tatsumi was overpowering Budou and Esdeath. Wave couldn't come close to that.</br>    <br>and no body questions any of the deaths except Tatsumi who is the same as current manga</br>  <br>Tatsumi is like the Eren of AgK. <br>Some basic skills <br>while his black haired friend who is overly skilled etc.</br></br></br>  <br> Lubbock dying <br><br>Yep. Honestly, that was bad writing. I never gave a shit about Lubbo before his last moments, but afterwards I was interested and wanted to see him succeed.<br><br>AFTER he fucking died. That's not how you develop a story. It doesn't feel sad, it just feels like wasted potential. When I think about Lubbo that only thing I can do is wince in disappointment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anime handled his death a bit better than the manga version that's for sure.</br>  <br>do you guys remember that retarded anti-Teigu thing the PM had in the last episode?<br><br>maybe it will reverse this shit.</br></br></br>  I want Wave and Kurome to have a happy ending together.<br><br>We will at least get that, r-right?   ;_;  </br></br>  This chapter was shit, it still feels like it's going to end like the anime but it's just going at a slower pace. Maybe Mine lives but that's all.  <br>Seriously. He was one of the few people in the manga who fought smart instead of bullshitting it up. He also was pretty good as a character. And then he gets killed in a dumb way for shock value by a guy who ends up jobbing in two panels. Fuck that shit. I think even Takahiro realized how badly he fucked up his death with all the "I'm doing this for Lubbock" in the next chapters.</br>  <br>Yeah, I missed those. Did a new chapter come out already or was that implied in Zero?<br><br><br> He reproduced so he's a good person <br>Try again. Pic related is the very next page, recounting all of his sins. He wasn't a good person who just happened to be on the wrong side, not even close.</br></br></br></br></br>   VN never <br> SoL never </br>  the fucking nigger should stick to writing porn<br><br>fuck, this should've just been an edgy eroge</br></br>  <br> no harem route <br> no aniki route <br> no lubba ntr route </br></br></br>  <br><br> you'll never play the wingman between Lubba and   Syura </br></br>  The meat, anon. You said there would be meat. Where is the meat? Where is it?  <br>in  my pants </br>  <br>this actually annoys me.<br>akame would have worked well as an eroge, it's shit for a manga though.<br><br><br>*unzips stake*</br></br></br></br></br>   *unzips stake*   <br>I keep hearing he used to write VNs. Were those actually good?</br>    <br>I know they finished the translation for the first game, but S is still unfinished right?</br>  <br>S got finished like 2-3 days ago I think</br>  <br><br>S translation has been finished 2 days ago actually.</br></br>  <br>Ever since Esdese and Budho became generic medium threat enemies I stopped caring.<br><br>Last time they had their entire strike force and several trump cards they barely managed to get away from Esdes with their lives.<br><br>Now Akame is able to take her on solo and Tatsumi wiped the floor with her.<br><br>Mein also instakilled Budho who was supposed to be on par with Esdese.<br><br><br>Seriously this series lost all of it's threats, now it's just boring. They don't even have to worry about armies because as they said the revolutionary army has completely encircled the capital and has cut off all of their supply lines.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, what. I can fap to Benkeis route now?</br></br>  <br><br>First Mikayo's route and now this. I'm fucking happy. Now I only need Benkei's route and I can die.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Seriously this series lost all of it's threats <br>But the writing of the author is the greatest threat. He can kill any character with an asspull.</br></br>  <br> Last time they had their entire strike force and several trump cards they barely managed to get away from Esdes with their lives. <br>Keep in mind that back then, Esdeath was actively holding back because she had to defend her target. She couldn't let loose and wreck them.<br><br>I understand that a shonen needs powerful enemies for the MC to overcome, but it never felt like Tatsumi improved. Tyrant just gave him an upgrade and voila, Night Raid can now wreck Esdeath and Budo at the same time, killing one of them. <br><br>We never saw anyone improve. The closest thing we had to improvement was after Susanoo and Chelsea were introduced. At some point, Bossu ordered them to go into the woods to "level up". <br><br>Even Naruto, as much as /a/ may hate it, had episodes where the titular character trained and practice to perfect his Rasengan. That's more development, improvement and training than we've ever seen in Akame ga Kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Benkei´s route is in A1 actually, so you´ll have to wait for that. I have however seen some Benkei scenes while browsing the S CG gallaries but i have clue how to get acces to those.</br></br>  <br> I keep hearing he used to write VNs. <br>he still does, pic related is from his newest VN.<br> Were those actually good? <br>yes</br></br></br></br>  <br>have no clue*</br>  <br> Benkei´s route is in A1 actually, so you´ll have to wait for that. <br>So, another 2-3 years?</br></br>  <br><br>I can't believe I'm happy in an Akame thread.</br></br>  <br>Why do Finnish in visual novels and anime always get silver hair? Not that I mind.</br>   tfw I will never get a laid back girlfriend like Benkei   <br>Isn't this new one shit though?</br>   If they use the part that was already translated by Wairu translations they might finish by the end of this year with this pace.  <br>we haven't seen him fight properly yet. the best we got was when he fought 3 night raid members. budo said he underestimated tatsumi before he got critically wounded and he still outlasted tatsumi. he would've won in a 1v1 at that point if he wasn't retarded or even if mine's power wasn't plot armor shit. esdeah was also underestimating him in that fight and said she'd fight serious next time since she got him or something like that<br><br>tatsumi's stronger now though</br></br></br>  <br>happens in this chapter. <br><br><br><br><br>This looks like a doujin.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I remember, her and the maid's routes in A-1 were started but dropped, and now it's up to whoever picked up the series to finish them, might be talking out of my ass here though.</br>  <br>Show me the pages.</br>  Why doesn't Tatsumi just use Akame's sword? Are teigu supposed to be like devil fruits or something?<br><br>I'm pretty sure if Tatsumi could easily beat the shit out of Esdese with a spear then he'd be unstoppable with a 1 hit kill sword that he has actually trained with most of his life.</br></br>  <br>Didn't they lost Mine in that battle? Also Esdeath couldn't land a hit on her in the cathedral.</br>  <br> implying you will get any kind of girlfriend </br>  <br>If I ever get one, I'd like a Benkei type of girlfriend.</br>  <br>each person can only use one, no? they also said early in the manga that there was a matter of compatibility with them. i don't remember if someone can't use it or if it's just much weaker if the person isn't compatible. either way, there was some sort of explanation in the early chapters</br>  <br>Maybe they think the Finnish are like polar bears.</br>  <br>Except that her 3DPD equivalent is an alcoholic NEET.</br>  Translation when?  <br> Didn't they lost Mine in that battle? <br>Only after a one-on-one clash where she singlehandedly destroyed Mine... and ended up surviving, probably long enough to fully recover to be with Tatsumi in the end. Against Budo, who is on par with Esdeath. When earlier she struggled to defeat Seryuu and only came out victorious by the skin of her teeth, and even then needed the help of Tatsumi to survive. And we've never seen her significantly improve between those two moments.<br><br> Inb4 "b-but Budo hadn't exercise in a while" <br>Not only is that not enough to bridge the gigantic power gap between Mine and Budo, but that also doesn't explain how Esdeath got her shit pushed in as well. Also, that's fucking retarded: the empire is at constant war with enemies both on the outside and the inside, and the emperors throne is more shaky than it has ever been. Budo, if he's as devoted to the empire as he claims he is, has literally no good reason not to train his ass off. Even in times of peace it'd be inexcusble, but in times of war and chaos it's downright retarded, almost as if the author made him temporarily a complete and utter retard just so Mine could survive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I could understand that if it were an armored suit but a sword is a fucking sword. It can't fight back if you want to swing it.</br>  <br>With an amazing body and apperently one heck of a brain?</br>  <br><br> Teigus kill you if you have bad compatibility.</br></br>  Did Akune and Leone fuck Tatsumi to calm him down?  <br>who's akune</br>   there are people on /a/ who read this dogshit <br> all the cancer ITT <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/</br></br>  <br>That's bullshit. If they could kill people that easily then they would use that power to kill their enemies when compatible users use them.<br><br>Fact of the matter is that they're tools and can't fight back unless they're literally alive like Tatsumi's weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>not really. they could corrode their internal organs or give them deceases or something like that. you're being pretty stupid about this</br>  <br> Didn't you watch the first episodes or read the first chapters? Tatsumi almost got killed by the Eye-thingy Tengu because he had bad compatibility with it.<br> They don't use this to kill other people because the process is slower than just outright using your Tengu to kill the faggot and it involves you handling your Teigu to somehow who might or might not have good compatibility with it.</br></br>  <br> almost as if the author made him temporarily a complete and utter retard just so Mine could survive. <br> almost <br> "I'm using my trump card" <br> random lightning targeting no one <br> oops I didn't check my energy gauge <br>no budo lost was super fucking stupid when it came to mine</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akame being able to hold esdeath nearly on her own is just silly following her getting pushed in by wave.</br>  <br>No they are shit.</br>  <br>Esdeath was playing around. Notice how easily Budou bitchslapped Akame.</br>  <br>Anekouji? apparently for some people is a big disappointment, but I don't know if they went over hyped.</br>  who wavexakame here    <br> Esdese will never finger your butt </br>  <br>unless akame manages to talk some sense into him. and that's very big if</br>  <br>Delicious Leone</br>  <br>What. The. Fuck.</br>  <br>Akame betraying NR for Wave could be interesting, a shame is not gonna happen, that would be living the dream for Wave with the two sisters.</br>  <br>What's with the white hair?</br>  <br>Guess it's because of the fire.</br>  <br>So all this shit about his potential is now in the shitters. He literally went the fuse for power shortcut that every MC that has no potential does to beat the big bads.</br>  <br>The beast is taking over.</br>  <br> Mary sue vs Wave <br>Dropped.

It's bullshit aimed at young uninformed soon-to-not-be artists that want to draw because they just finished watching an episode of Naruto on Cartoon Network. It only confuses new artists that want to learn how to draw properly and spawns the disgusting shit we see primarily on deviantart or tumblr.<br><br>Proper methods of learning how to draw would include learning fundamentals such as figure/shape, perspective, and how light effects an object (shading). You can't learn how to stylize a drawing of something unless you know how to draw that something. There are many well-regarded books from artists that were written decades ago that are still the best resources for starting your artistic journey, "Mastering Manga" isn't one of them.</br></br></br>    <br>That's a weird pose.</br>  Hey, NYC buyfags: any place I should head besides Kinokuniya and Book-Off?

I decided to insect/dust proof my Detolfs very early in my collection career because I was occasionally finding silverfish poop on my figures =_= <br><br> The poops are little black specks that are stuck on so you can't just brush them off. When you try to remove them more forcefully, they easily smear and are hard to cleanly wash off. I thought they were specks of paint at first, but that made no sense since I inspect my figures carefully upon arrival. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What region do you guys live in?</br>  What figures are you hoping to be announced at WonFes?  its a good year to be a monogatari drone  <br>I have silverfish in my bathroom, but I haven't seen anything on my figures.</br>  <br>Ginko</br>  <br><br>Nui nendoroid, every year. Would also like to see some Koufuku Graffiti figures, especially Kirin.</br></br>  <br>I can't remember anything from the last season that I would like as a figure.</br>  <br>all I need to complete my  harem  is a decent Irisviel figure and Kuronuma Sawako, but I don't think either of them will ever happen</br>  <br>Not until I get a good donut-less Shinobu.</br>  <br>Silverfish? I've only ever had flies poop on my figures. They seem to limit themselves to certain spots on certain figures.<br><br>My 2020 Miku's panties get covered in fly poop. Just the panties, nowhere else.</br></br></br>  <br>Not /a/ but I want an Ion fig or scales of the Shallies.</br>  <br>I'd love a scale of her too.</br>      <br>A 1/6 scale of her with her sword (or something) in her loli form--or fuck, her teenage form--would be fantastic.</br>          <br> Her teenage form <br>This would bother me since I only buy figures from characters I like in their usual outfits and things like that. Shit like "yukata ver", Under-blade and such don't appeal to me.<br>Her with the sword would be cool if done correctly. Alter's and Koto's are both boring and make her look too much like a soulless moeblob. GSC is just way too tiny.</br></br></br>  <br>With Lulu to complete the pair.</br>  <br>Wrong ginko but I wouldn't mind scales of them either to be honest.</br>  <br> I only buy figures from characters I like in their usual outfits and things like that <br>That's kind of depressing, anon. Is your collection 90% school uniform figures?</br></br>  <br>Poi kai ni by gsc. If it happens then I will order their Shigure.</br>  <br>I only have 2 figs in school uniforms and they are nendos from SoL comedies.<br>My other things like Spice and Wolf, Madoka, Black Rock Shooter, Rozen Maiden, etc, don't feature school outfits at all.<br>Heck, I'd actually want a good Misaka Mikoto fig in her usual school uniform that isn't her Nendo.</br></br></br>  <br>Something of Midare-chan. Even a cute GK is fine.</br>    <br><br>Are you me? <br><br>I love how their Shigure looks, but she's far from one of my favorites, so it's kinda hard to justify the 14k~ she would cost me, but if they make a Yuudachi Kai Ni to match her then I'll get it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mostly just want things from previous WonFeses to be sculpted or painted. I wont turn down a cute scarf Saber though.<br><br>Mostly I want to see GCS's Bride Nero (please be zipped) and Tony Taka's ballerinas.</br></br></br>  <br> (please be zipped) <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Soon</br>  <br>to add to <br>I like Monogatari's school uniform, but Shinobu specifically doesn't have one, so she's free.<br>Other future purchases I have in mind include Dog Days, No Game No Life and Date a Live, three things that lack school uniform. I'm waiting for a good Gochuumon fig, and that doesn't have school uniforms as the default outfit.<br><br>I'm not going to say "watch better anime" because that would be pure irony, but at least know that not everything out there is school in anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miss Monochrome scale<br>Something Euphonium related.<br><br>Can't think of anything else off the top of my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah I want something euphonium related too! I normally dont like school uniform figures but I love the euphos winter uniforms a lot.</br>  <br>I wish. Fuck Hanzo for getting all the figures. Asuka and Ikaruga are the only two of that group that deserve them.</br>  <br>Waiting on YUI. YUI is the only one I want.</br>  <br>Komari from NNB.<br>Karen from KinMoza.<br>Syaro from Gochu.<br>Anything. I'm tired of these shows only getting token loli nendos and nothing else.</br></br></br></br>  Anyone familiar with booth.pm? Looks to be an extension of pixiv where artists can sell their work and have the production handled by them.<br><br>I need a grumpy looking Yui to hug.<br><br>https://meltypot.booth.pm/<br><br>I'm curious if anyone has used it before and what the quality is like.<br><br>Also whether they ship internationally. Its odd, parts of the site are in English, including the checkout process, but you can't enter an international address. Not sure why they'd go to the effort of translating it if foreigners can't use it. Unless they expect us to use a proxy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miss Monochrome scale <br>Me too, I'm not satisfied with the way the nendo turned out, and pic related is never getting released.</br></br>  <br>Thats a pretty feminine looking butt.</br>  <br>do I just go inside and grab one?</br>  <br>Booth.pm is used by pixiv artist to sell digital art to anyone, anywhere. You can buy doujins scans, or digital goods. <br><br>But you have to use a forwarder for physical good, like doujins and dakis. I'd recommend using 2you4 since they actually speak English and only costs $1.85 per packet. As much shit as you can stuff in that bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>One of these is 2way tricot, the other one is 2way "roika", which I've never heard about. That's all there is about quality.<br><br>Yes, you're expected to use a proxy or forwarder, they don't ship overseas. Since the checkout process is pretty simple you can just forward it. <br><br>Shipping might take a while but besides that there's nothing to worry about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it ever confirmed if this particular Poison was going to be castoffable?<br>That seam on her top and the general looseness of it makes it look like it would be cast off.</br></br>  <br>Barners and Novels' anime/manga day is today only. From 1pm to 5pm, your time. <br>They have some free prints, books, and discounts on all manga. Cosplayers have to sign a waiver to get in but can win cool prizes!<br><br>Please come see your local Barner&amp;Novels today!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to see this painted at least.</br>  I'm super confused. I bought something from amiami for $60 and they put a preauthorization charge on my card. Then they removed/canceled the preauthorization. The item showed up last week. They still havent charged me for it though.<br><br>Is this how they normally handle payments?</br></br>  <br>It's already painted and for sale for a year now. Go see the Gathering website.<br><br>If you want a mass produced one you will have to wait.</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese CC system charges you at the end of every moth.</br>    <br> not buying all five <br>You monster.</br></br>  <br><br>I would love to see some Houkago on Pleiades figures, especially Subaru.</br></br>  <br>General Sale when?</br>  <br><br>Azusa and Mio a shit. Completely out of place with the rest of the set.</br></br>  Got round to putting up my framed posters.    <br><br><br>Thanks, forwarding is fine. I'll have a think about it before jumping in on my second daki.<br><br>If you google roika there's an MFC post about it that comes up. Not something I'd heard of before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't sexualize the little bean.</br>  <br>D-doesn't count.<br>It's shit.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, that makes sense!</br>  <br>Nice posters, shitty speakers.</br>  <br>They were the best speakers I could obtain for cheap. I blew all my money on my glass cabinets.</br>  <br>Well ok then, I'll let you slide this time.</br>  <br> letting another anon slide inside you <br>filthy whore.</br></br>  <br>To make up for it, I have a tube amp for my headphone set up.</br>  <br>Nicer than mine then. I have a pair of AKG K7XX and a FiiO E09K with FiiO E17 DAC</br>  So does anyone know where you can buy a figure backdrop for taking pictures?<br><br>I see a lot of people standing them in pure white backgrounds. Do they just get white film paper?</br></br>  <br>I like the Atom puzzle and the Area 88 set. You should be ashamed for owning Robotech.</br>  <br>White clothes</br>  <br>Whats wrong with those speakers?<br>I have them too and I like them just fine.</br></br>  <br>I considered the FiiO amps, but I decided I might as well go all the way so I ended up with a pair of Sony Z7 with Woo Audio 6 tube amp and Schiit Modi DAC.</br>  <br>These figma, assuming we ever get release dates.</br>  (Pre-owned ITEM:B/BOX:B)<br>Should I?<br>It's a scale</br></br>  <br>just avoid "item:c/box:c" and you should be fine</br>  <br><br>Just avoid Item C. The box means jack shit.</br></br>  So I got banned from amiami for not being able to make some payments due to a financial emergency. I recently made a new account with a different address and e-mail, so should I be good? I've heard of people automatically having their accounts terminated if it's connected with their previous e-mail or address.  <br>Or credit card.</br>  <br>scum like you shouldn't be allowed to use amiami, I hope you get banned again</br>  <br>Get out amiami shill</br>  I wish Amiami and the GSC would just allow the option to pay upfront instead of waiting.  I can't find anything about the actual contents or any examples. Can anyone who has it tell me the kind of stuff in it?  <br>It'd be nice to be able to pay for the item itself upfront, at least.</br>  <br>They blacklisted my addresses, first middle name and last name and my family members.</br>    <br>I just wish they'd automatically charge me and ship it so I wouldn't have to wait that extra day.</br>  <br>Is the Azusa figure gonna be available on BiJ once it's released? I've never used them before, but it looks like Mugi is already available to order...<br><br>http://biginjap.com/en/pvc-figures/<wbr>11309-k-on-nakano-azusa-18-5th-anni<wbr>versary.html</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure, you can't preorder her on animaru anymore.</br>  <br> and my family members. <br>nice</br></br>  <br>Yeah sucks, also hit my roommate as well.

He just took Utena for a drive on that scene.<br><br>Holy shit, /a/ is fucking dumb.</br></br></br>  ZETTAI <br>UNMEI <br>MOKUSHIROKU</br></br>  <br><br>The car and such represented Adult Power.<br><br>He did fuck a lot of girls though, but no taking them for a ride in the car didn't symbolize sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I though the car symbolized a modern prince.<br>Instead of horses, he uses a nice car</br></br>  <br>Unless it did. In which case he fucked a pair of 13 year old twins.<br><br>Do you want to take that away from Akio?</br></br></br>  <br> kitten killing cunt <br><br>She's shit and the reason I dropped this garbage.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HTF<wbr>XzBeNosE</wbr>  [ ]<br>soshite<br> Tsuki ten  <br> Suisei ten  <br> Kinsei ten <br> Taiyou ten  <br> kasei ten  <br> Mokusei ten <br> Dosei ten  <br> Kousei ten  <br> Gendou ten <br><br> SA   RAN  <br> NA  <br> RUUU </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> spoilers of the final episode on the video <br>Why.</br></br>  <br>Becausae  everyone apart Shinji and Asuka die in the last episode </br>  <br>Asuka is also dead you fucking pleb.

She and the guy who didn't go all the way on the edgy elevator were the only good characters.</br>  <br>From Anthy's perspective.</br>  <br>Typical Ikuharafag, incapable of telling the difference between hidden message and trasparence when its right in front of your eyes.<br>if Anno wanted to tell the audience she was dead, she wouldn't had showed her<br> yes but its just a projection of bleach nadia inside his mind <br>then if his subjectivity becomes the new objectivity a projection counts as alive as the real thing<br>I know you want to quote me now but I don't want to ruin the thread, so I'll cut it here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You tell me.</br></br>  <br> then if his subjectivity becomes the new objectivity a projection counts as alive as the real thing <br>You're so wrong. I bet you believe in magic.</br></br>  <br> Do you want to take that away from Akio? <br>That would be cruel.</br></br>  <br>No, but I believe in you</br>  <br><br>You mean Miki? Poor fucker, I wonder how many pianos he had to burn after his sister got dicked on them.</br></br>  <br>That looks pretty shounen man.</br>  <br>Juri was an uncommunicative, selfish cunt. Worst girl.</br>  <br>I think it was the guy who wanted to date Wakaba.</br>  <br>He was a good boy who didn't belong in Ohtori.</br>  <br>No, he just wasn't exploitable. But that doesn't make him good.</br>  Who came up with the crazy ambient visuals? sure it wasn't Chiho Saito  <br>Wasn't it Kobayashi?</br>  <br>He was the art director, but I think its more probable that he was just putting in practice Ikuhara orders</br>  <br> anthy <br> evil </br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Anthy<br>is this normal?</br></br>    <br>Obligatory</br>  What did the surfing elephants mean?  <br>Youth</br>  <br>How</br>  <br>benis</br>  <br>Best girl indicating where Nanami can place her kiss.</br>  <br> liking nanami <br> mfw </br></br>  <br><br>If you have a love/hate relationship with her you are already on your way.</br></br>  Still pissed that Utena's VA died. Her voice kind of makes me sad now.  <br><br>Solo makes me really miss 90's grunge rock.</br></br>  <br>Since Akio is the only who's old enough to drive, the car rides are meant to symbolize him corrupting the duelists in an adult way.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Jury wasn't in love with Shiori, everything that may have hinted at it was likely just a ruse.</br>  <br><br>Can't tell if bait or dumb.</br></br>  <br><br>You could say the car symbolized one's sex drive.</br></br>  <br>Pretty close to fucking her brother during that one car ride but I don't think she did.</br>  <br>Torch that whore....</br>  <br>She'll be back though, in  ARIA ;_; <br><br><br>Too early for me to rewatch it, I think I watched it the first time like half a year ago.<br><br><br>She was a bitch in the movie too, right?<br><br>Also can someone explain the ending of the series for me?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The guy asked if she was in love with her. It's the absolute most central point of any of the Jury episodes. Like, even if you ignore all of the symbolism of the show, that fact is shown clear as day. I was giving him a sarcastic response.</br>  <br> end of the series <br>Anthy and Utena kind of switched roles from what I understand. Anthy started out on a quest to save the princess, just as Utena did for Anthy. Akio's still doing the same old same old, just perhaps with a substitute Rose Bride since Anthy's doing her own thing. Utena's MIA.</br></br>  Nanami is the worst part of Utena  <br>It's been analyzed to death and exhaustively explained in countless forums and websites.</br>  <br>Keep in mind I'm going for a rather straightforward explanation.</br>  <br>She was a bitch and a car.</br>  <br>Akio decides to remain in the realm of fantasy (the school) and endlessly repeat past tortures and tragedy. <br><br>Utena disappeared = she grew the fuck up, graduated from the school, and moved on to live in the real world as a true adult foregoing childish things. <br><br>Anthy decided that this was the best thing to do and left the school as well to "find Utena" and live her own life.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I won't rewatch until I get some weed.<br><br>Smoke a little pot and the show makes complete sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I sometimes wonder if everyone is dead in Utena and they're in some kinda purgatory.</br></br>  <br>I could see someone interpreting it like that. It's what I wondered at first after Anthy and Akio's pasts are revealed.</br>  <br>Christ, I haven't heard a reference to that Ed Edd and Eddy theory/pasta in forever.<br><br><br>It's one way to look at it. However, to me Akio wasn't really hurting and seemed more indifferent or accepting of his role. I mean, the guy's a chairman with a harem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What went so wrong in your upbringing that allowed such poor taste to surface?</br>  <br>Not everything is some copypasta, moron.</br>  Good night, anon.

That is cliche as fuck and almost every shounen does that</br></br>  <br>nah. not even those two.</br>  <br>It's not up to debate. OP and Naruto are clearly worse.</br>  Monster Musume? Papi Thread?  <br>OP you are a furry faggot</br>  <br>Oh, I missed that then. Can I ask for a link?</br>  Ha Cerea's last name is Shi-Anus. Almost shit-anus.  <br>Never mind, found it. <br><br>Dat Cerea suit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Do you think Miia or Papi might really like MC? Like maybe even more than just friends?</br></br>   tfw 8 RAWs out for the movie and still no subs yet   <br>Anons don't own subbing sweatshop</br>  <br>Because it's a movie nobody will even bother speedsubbing.</br>  Sad face.  I don't see how this could take so long? Isn't it just like subbing 3 episodes?  <br>Commie is a bunch of lazy niggers.</br>  Do you agree with the Prez?<br><br>Chapters 183 and 184 are up on yomanga for all of you slowpokes. <br><br>Japanese RAWs are out as well for 184, for those inclined.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is a cute.</br>  <br><br>It's love at first sight shit, she was the first girl to talk to him because she thought he liked sumo. <br><br>It's kinda shitty and she interrupts alot of lewd scenes plus locks him out of Mari but that's how it is, it's like the author wants us to hate her. <br><br>Hope she goes full ntr and just watches Kiyoshi fuck whoever wins the Kiyoshibowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so, who's gonna get to fondle mari's breast? my bet is on kiyoshi</br>  <br> I am a hana fag but this might be the most intimate scene in the manga <br> implying </br></br>  <br>She's a girl and she's nice to him. <br><br>Basically, Chiyo represents an idealized, pure relationship with a nice girl which is what Kiyoshi thinks he wants. This is juxtaposed with the increasingly sexualized situations in which Kiyoshi finds himself in. Idealized romance vs Awakening sex drive and different understanding of relationship.<br><br>Basically, it's about puberty. In appropriately over the top fashion.</br></br></br></br></br>  What do you guys think of DBS so far? Three episodes thus far and it has a slice-of-life feel, episode two with Vegeta's family vacation was enjoyable to me. I know this is just setup but I almost wish we could get past the BoG stuff and start progressing with new material. So far episodes follow a pattern of focusing on SoL stuff and Beerus wrecking things.   Beerus makes a joke about killing all the dinosaurs on earth <br> Even though they still exist in DB universe <br>I'm starting to think Akira isn't the only senile person on the Super staff.</br></br>  <br>Yeah it was hilarious when goten and trunks flew at the jewelry store, and then when krillin did while in traffic, WASN'T EXPECTING THAT!</br>  <br>Came to the thread just for this daily reminder.</br>  <br>It's been officially romanized as Buu by every Shueisha/TOEI source. Only Kanzenshuu fags are obsessed with "muh reference".</br>  <br>How is it better? pacing is now shit.</br></blockquote>]
