[ Seriously, do you want to marry a baka-ojousama? Considering your children will have a 50% autism chance?  <br> 50% autism chance <br>are you implying wakaba isn't autistic?</br></br>  <br>Wait... are you saying Anon is autistic?</br>  OTAKU?<br>OTAKU DESU KA?</br>  bakaba  <br>Was something lost in CR's shit translation or was wakaba just being dumb?</br>  Wakaba is just pretending inorder to become a highschool girl  <br>otaku is actually a colloquialism from archaic japanese so it probably has a novelty to an ojou-sama, but the translation was word for word</br>  <br>Otaku means you so she thought it was funny she was saying "you're an otaku" by saying "otaku otaku"</br>  Baka-ojousamas are the new best thing.  But who is actually the mother and sister  I'd do it just for the money.  <br> Not wanting to love Wakaba and make her your gyaru <br>Come on anon.</br></br>  <br>She's too precious to not marry. Not like I'll have her preggos  oh shit whoops. </br>  <br>Mao please</br>  <br>I will if she pays me.</br>  <br><br>Mao stawp.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Mao wouldn't drink Wakaba's piss for $25.</br>  <br>Mao is marrying Wakaba to go eat at French restaurants and get ice cream every day.</br>  The real question is will these two marry?!!   It's time.   <br>Prison School full of worst boys.</br>  No  So how about  It really isn't time. This season is shit.  I'm loving that bara-ness of Ushio. If Tora didn't look like he came out of a 90s comic book (and wasn't a furfag, let's be honest) I could see there being plenty of doujins where Tora forcefully 'eats' Ushio. <br><br>Does Tora have a human form and, more importantly, is it cute?</br></br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>You're just being picky, anon.</br>   Why can't Rui just be loved tenderly?    <br>We see a man orgasm on-screen and this season is supposed to be shit?</br>  Which Tenkai would you Knight?  <br>Because traps deserve to suffer</br>  <br>None. They look a little underdeveloped.</br>  <br>The only thing missing this season is a decent sport series with qt boys, but other wise we got all tastes filled.</br>  Anyone else start playing this? It's an actual rhythm idol boy game.<br>Some of them are cute.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>IB is best idols</br>  When's HQ coming bach?  <br>That was a surprise.</br>  <br> this face right after while the shower soundclip was still running </br>  <br>I don' have any devices that can play the game.<br><br>Also fuck off to<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  I like how this season continues to omnipander.  Would you let Leo be your tortoise knight?  <br>Watching haremshit for its guys is only going to break your heart, anon. <br> But I'm also enjoying GATE </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br><br>It's a good week.</br></br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Why would you assume I know what that is? <br>Is it an anime or a manga?</br></br>    <br>It's from Aichuu, a mobile rhythm game.</br>  <br>What could have been</br>  <br> that show </br>  <br>Try googling text from the card then,</br>  <br>Then fuck off to </br>   thread turning into /v/ again   <br>That author who does Oreimo doujin better deliver.</br>  <br> dat look <br> dat wet hair <br> dat everything <br>popped a boner</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for  adult characters and I love the modern military in a historical or medieval setting theme. One of my favorite anime is Zipang. </br>  <br>I wish that Ghostbusters had more than 1 cute guy in it but I'm also enjoying it.</br>  I've finally figured it out, he's just Mattsundere.  Did /a/ like K? wasn't around when it was airing but it's pretty homo. <br>Here's Green King.</br>  <br>I can't figure out which one is more dominant. He is the boss and has clearly more authority but then again sensei is older.</br>  <br> dem tiger brows </br>  I've never understood these threads.<br>It's satire right.</br>    <br>Is it on google play? I can't find it.</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> dem armpits </br></br>  <br>Just as satirical as waifu threads.<br>Which means it started out as a joke and now people mistakenly believe it's a real thing and okay.</br></br>  <br>The movie was disappointing, but I can't wait for S2. I rewatched it like 3 times.</br>  <br>Its region locked. The bitches on otome general should be able to help you get it though.</br>  <br> Shounen MC with passions outside of sports or food <br>Fucking fresh.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking off to /vg/ well help.</br>  <br>Also, nomination for having the most surprise homolust of the season?</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll try. I've been looking for a mobile rhythm game anyway.</br>  <br>Alright.<br>So is this shit limited to 2D. I have no idea how this works.<br>Like how lolicon doesn't translate to 3D at all, can anyone that participates in these threads explain themselves?</br></br></br>  <br> surprise <br>You should read the manga, it's pure bait.</br></br>  <br>The movie felt more like something that should have been an ova instead. Did you understand a lot of the stuff that went on in season 1? The manga has horrible art but reading in explained a lot more stuff by adding in details. It was the Green King that caused all that shit to happen in season 1.</br>  <br>Everyone on this show has brain problems.</br>  <br> So is this shit limited to 2D. <br>This is a given.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 reads like a BL manga.</br>  <br> surprise </br>  <br>It's hardly a surprise, though the premise might sound like it's reverse harem. But it barely focuses on the fact MC is a girl and hasn't had romance so far. It's more bros being bros shonen manga.</br>  <br>I did but I don't remember it being this homo.</br>  <br>Does it have a female mc?</br>  <br>The mc is female yes</br>  <br>He's so depraved.</br>  It's time to post your husbando!  <br>Can I post my son instead?</br>  <br>This thread is off to a good start.</br>  <br>Bl needs more diverse art styles</br>  <br>It sure is.</br>  <br>Hmm, looking back he is extremely depraved.  I hope he gets the mob doujins he deserves </br>  <br> fujos <br> watching shoujo  <br>I doubt he'll get anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer is the best time of the year, after all.</br>  <br>Technically it's shounen, but you're probably right anyway.</br>  <br>Who looks exactly like a boy 100% of the time. There are certain implicit leanings here.</br>  <br>That's not shoujo though<br>It's "neo-shonen", aka shonen that most likely still panders to girls(see Kuroshitsuji).</br></br>  <br>Tora is a qt oversized cat, do not sexualize him.</br>  <br>You need to relax. Why don't you lay down right over there.</br>  <br> neo-shonen <br>Why do you have to invent new terms if you can just call it shoujo?<br><br>Monthly GFantasy might as well call itself shoujo since by now 90% of its target audience is girls. <br><br>ffs, Switch, Saiyuki, Pandora Hearts, Nabari no Ou and Kimi to Boku ran in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show is shit though. Only watching because some anon told me that there will be shota suffering in the future.</br>  <br>Wow sounds like it's demographic is shoujo.</br>  <br><br><br>MC is so fuckin ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks roofied.</br>  <br>Okay. I just hope we at least see more of this delinquent.</br>  <br> Yes he does </br>  <br>So even if you call those shoujo, what does that have to do with  ? G Fantasy's titles are popular among fujoshi.</br>  <br> Ranpo kittan threads are somehow gayer than homothread </br>  Yo homodachi, any of you interested in some typesetting?  <br>Not really. You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos. Besides, he looks a lot cuter in the manga.</br>  <br>Ouran got some doujins back then, they were all terrible but still.</br>  <br>And he is even uglier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why are they so LONG?</br>  <br>I think he's cute</br>  <br> You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos <br><br>No man, I'm just not blind.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking LONG </br>  <br>This doujin was great.</br>  <br>I think he's really cute.</br>  <br> fujo design <br>He looked like Sousuke on manga cover.</br></br>  <br>Actually in that image he looks fine, if only the rest of the show was drawn that well.</br>  <br>Well, Sousuke is cute.</br>  <br>Wrong Sousuke though.</br>  <br>Then you should've posted who you meant, dumbass.</br>  <br>Everybody knows which Sousuke dumbass.</br>  Myreadingmanga died?  <br>No?</br>  <br>Oh god, CLAMP has a problem.</br>  <br>Because they're not 15</br>  My homo-meter was off the charts this chapter   cutest boy is gone <br><br>Suddenly there is no reason to watch it anymore.</br></br>  <br>nope.</br>   3745HOUSE new doujin out <br><br><br>Uh? Sensei still there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some weak trolling there, dumbass.</br>  <br>What are you saying, Kaitocchi is still very much present.</br>  <br> cutest boy is gone <br>Something happened to the teacher?</br></br>  <br>Why use it? Basically everything on it is on sadpanda</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus christ get some taste. No wonder everyone is laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some aren't, and I prefer the scroll down format.</br>  Sera-sensei is a tyrant teacher and probably smells like beer and oil.  <br>Still posting worse Sousuke dumbass?</br>  <br>I prefer a guy that smells of blood, sweat, and whiskey.</br>  <br>Is it going to be KarmaxNagisa or NagisaxKayano? I'm personally rooting for  OotaxNagisa .</br>  <br>What an ugly bitch.</br>  <br>Kayano is clearly the manga endgame, but that won't stop me fapping to any good KarmaxNagisa doujins.<br>I really wish we'd get NagisaxKarma sometime too.</br></br>  <br>At least someone is posting a Sousuke dumbass</br>  <br> everything on it is on sadpanda <br><br>A lot of translated manga and doujins aren't. Site is good, if you ignore the terrible layout and users.</br></br></br>  <br>He sure is. Makes him even more moe.</br>  <br> Manlets </br>  <br>You are wasting image limit dumbass.</br>  <br>They also make me smile</br>  <br>And you still haven't posted the Sousuke you were thinking of, dumbass</br>  <br>No, it makes him shit.</br>  <br>Manlets are cute</br>  <br>No need to post the obvious dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Can you faggots fuck off?</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Old post, but am I looking at this wrong? He looks like he has a bustle, or dislocated hip.</br>    <br>Thanks for agreeing that GATE MC is cute.</br>  <br>He means Sousuke from Free. Hence why he quoted the thing about fujo bait. Now both of you can shut up.</br>  <br>And there's this faggot.</br>  <br>Almost forgot about this. I thought they'd reveal Nagare's design in the anime as some sort of surprise and not earlier.</br>  <br>He's as ugly as Sousuke still better than FMP Sousuke though.</br>  Thanks to the anon that mentioned Gakuen Ouji last thread. Shit's crazy. Nobunaga a shit but he has some serious homolust.  <br>So which Sousuke were you thinking of? Because this Sousuke is pretty cute too.</br>  <br> You're welcome! </br>  <br><br>He's wearing a dress. He's just holding side of it out.</br></br>  <br>He's better as a shota.</br>  <br>Already mentioned dumbass.</br>  <br>You haven't posted him yet.</br>  <br><br>Everyone is better as shota duh</br></br>  <br>Most bad boys are.</br>  <br>I thought it was strange too. He has a really cool design though. along with his priest and shota. Sorta wish Munakata didn't beat him to the punch of making Fushimi a clansmen. He would have fit in well with the greens.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>REJOICE</br>  <br>So it WAS Aizen all along!</br>  <br>Deaf moe is cute.</br>  <br>That's some Aizen tier trolling right there.</br>  <br> Kotomine is now the same voice of another Best Priest. </br>  <br>No you're Aizen!</br>  <br>I don't think he's moe but Nic sure is hot.</br>  <br> MFW he speaks. <br><br>I never thought having a speech impediment could be so sexy.</br></br></br>  What do I say to people who think having more than one husbando is perfectly fine?  <br>Call them a slut.</br>  <br>I call them out for the sluts that they are.</br>  <br>You join them.</br>  <br>Tell them not to use words they don't understand.</br>  <br>Leave them to their delusions and then go back to feeding your husbando.</br>  <br>It's perfectly fine.</br>  <br><br>Slut</br></br>  <br><br>You cum guzzling whores.</br></br>  I didn't like this that much but the new cover is so nice I'm tempted to buyfag it.  <br><br>I love cumming in my pure husbandos.</br></br>  <br> husbandos <br>Don't use words you don't understand.</br></br>  <br>I thought I was the only one who didn't like the story. Art's nice though.</br>  <br>Tell them having more than one husbando will ruin their laifusbando.</br>  <br>I love all my husbandos.</br>  <br>Or more than one husbando is a bad endo.</br>  <br>I would've liked it better if Shun hadn't been such a shit. <br>Mio getting character development out of nowhere didn't help either. He lost a lot of charm.</br></br>  The staff really, really likes these guys. This episode had a bunch of anime-original touchy-feely shenanigans. <br>I'm dying to know what they're doing in the pot in the ED since they're facing away from the viewer.</br>  Which sword would you  polish?   <br>The on-topic one.<br><br> Fuck that's lewd. </br></br></br>  <br>Lewd swords are best swords.</br>  <br>The one that belongs in /vg--<br>oh wait your swordshit general is dead because your game fucking sucks.</br></br>  <br>Kill those abominations.</br>  I didn't expect to like this guy as much as I do now. I can't wait for his suffering to begin.  <br>I didn't expect to like any character, or even the show itself, as much as I do. Truly glad I picked it up.</br>  It was  okay.   <br>Same here. Even  imouto  is growing on me.</br>  <br>I like him too, the sol scenes with the teleportation guy and him are great. The whole cast is really nice to watch.</br>  <br>Alright, I'll bite.</br>  <br><br>What's the target audience for this show? I was expecting the two guys to get paired up with the girls but it feels more like the two guys and the two girls are getting paired up among themselves.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833992/2c2c79<wbr>6cd7/</wbr>  <br>Megane's autism is so endearing.</br>  <br>Might be omnipandering.  I know this isn't the thread for this, and I'm usually no yurifag, but I have to say that the two girls seem cute together. Kind of wish it were real rather than just ED fanservice. <br><br><br> I can't figure out which one is more dominant. <br>I think it's pretty clear, since Kaito barely acts his age and Nagisa pretty much curbstomps his enthusiasm given the slightest chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped CG but moeducer was really a gem boy there. Glad he got noticed.</br>  <br>I hope we have time for his backstory.<br><br>By the way, are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones?</br></br></br>  <br>I am, but first I need to learn how.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure, if fujoshi jump on this, Kaito will be the one on top.</br>  <br>I never saw HS for this one so I don't how they compare, but subs for every other HS show have been pretty shitty, so I'm sure these are better.</br>  i waited 3 months to see this moe face again, and i was not disappointed  <br>Is this shit still being translated?</br>  <br> are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones? <br>I haven't seen CR's script aside from the pastebin with the mistranslations from episode 1, but judging from that I'd call the other option better.</br></br>  <br>That one's the sequel, so no. <br>Someone's typesetting the old one right now, don't know if it's completed yet.</br></br>  <br>Going to buyfag it for the art. I'm probably going to buyfag all her works.</br>  <br> To be honest the suffering was the only reason I picked up the manga.</br>  Please tell me this semen demon shows up again at some point.  <br> Everyone in this story returns at some point. <br>Also Obi is best girl.</br></br>    <br>Here I thought I wouldn't feel the need to watch this show after reading the manga, but I'm almost changing my mind just because of their increased screentime.</br>  I'll post some Kyoani boys from specials who still hot no screen time but was mentioned    Why did I wait so long to start watching this?  <br>If you like the manga enough to stay current, you'll like everything JC Staff is doing with the anime. You have Shouji and Daigo's cheerleading scenes in the election, which I'm sure are going to be embellished, to look forward to as well.</br>  <br>Are any new films or pretty much anything coming out anytime soon?</br>  <br>Is he autistic? I felt really sorry for him. He'll forever exist only in this short, lacking personality, blowing at cats on his window sill. It's almost as if the viewer is a figment of his imagination.</br>  <br><br>I like KnK's designs for boys better.</br></br>  <br> Nakigitsune <br><br>Thanks for the update anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked how Kyoani colored the hair in KnK, but my favorite were Hyouka's designs.</br>  <br>You are still on time to sweat together over precious Shokugeki boys.</br>  <br>Kind of wish the series had a couple more guys in it, I still haven't gotten around to watching it because it seems like a lot of yuribait drama.<br><br><br> I think of him as being like a stoner NEET.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The bodies in Shokugeki are deliciously drawn. I had originally dropped it due to lack of time, but I've picked it back the fuck up after seeing all these screencaps.</br>  <br>So I assume you don't know about the new ending</br>  <br> fagotto </br>  <br>I still want Isshiki and Souma to fuck.</br>  <br>It's probably a toss up between the two for me when it comes to character designs. For actual character personalities, though, Hyouka wins for me.  S2 never. ;_; <br><br> "select all ice cream" <br> only gives me pictures of sorbet <br>Goddammit, Google.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best instrument</br>  <br>I liked how Soma's dad was utterly unfazed by how Isshiki walks around in nothing but an apron. I get the impression Polar Star is like a breeding ground for weirdoes.</br>  <br><br>I want to molest all Kyoani boys.</br></br>  <br>The yuribait is  great  and isolated into a couple scenes. The rest is just regular friendship. <br>The series is plot heavy and drama is always related to the brass band club, save for one episode.</br></br>  <br>Well, despite what Hibike threads said while watching this I hadn't got the feeling there is yuri there or my yuri googles wasn't strong enough to see romance between fem characters, but indeed there was friendship, idolizing and appreciating. <br>Also it is really rare for Kyoani shows but the drama was surprisingly fine and didn't felt like overreacting about stupid things.<br>It was about  having leading solo in competition's performance everybody trained really hard for. </br></br></br>  What's the homoest non homo show you've ever seen? Any Gundam does not count, or any mecha for that matter.  <br> image <br>What is this anon?</br></br>  <br>  No Gundam or any mecha <br><br>Fine then.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Evangelion technically isn't a mecha</br>  <br>I guess Texhnolyze or Shigurui. <br>The amount of genuine gay both had was pretty surprising.</br></br>    <br>Hunter x Hunter</br>  <br>I need to go watch some more shows with bromance.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>1509618<br> They're from this artist but I'm not sure if they're musician OCs or some kind of instrument gijinka.</br></wbr></br>  <br>he said non homo</br>  <br>HxH is non-homo. Togashi intended it as a pure friendship.</br>  <br> dat bari sax <br>I'd empty that guy's spit valve, if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br>You should have exclude sports series too.</br>  <br>Wanted to post it </br>    <br>Nice rec request.</br>  <br>Don't be so slut, Kise.</br>  <br>Dio the moest</br>  <br>I wonder why Araki made him look like a lesbian after drained Joseph. Regular Banana DIO looks better.</br>  What's going on here?  <br>A not-so-secret discussion over whether or not to rape Marui once he's unconscious.</br>  <br>Discussion of country grown vegetables.</br>  <br>I want to  hug_  Ceylan tenderly</br>  <br><br>Those are rather different.</br></br>  Will everything be okay in the end?  <br>With those two, their conversations can range far and wide.</br>  <br>No, because bitches will ruin anything and the omnipandering roach who created this series won't kill them off.</br>  <br>Getbackers is really fucking gay without actually being gay.</br>  <br>Someone's mad.</br>  <br>Never 4get.</br>  <br>Mika was Yuu's family first. That has to count for something, right? If Shinoa canonly won the Yuu it'd be like she slipped into Mika's yard and stole the fruit from the tree he's put all his effort into growing for all these years. It'd be too cruel.</br>  Nagisa's thighs  <br>It's not cheating if they have the same VA</br>  <br> It'd be too cruel. <br>Sounds just like Kagami. But more importantly this is a shounen magazine. If there is any actual romance it will be with the main girl.</br></br>  <br> serious homo end <br>Remind yourself how many times that has happened.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember Shinoa/Yuu being implied as hard in the manga as it was in the anime. Do I just have selective memory or did WIT up the hetero.</br>  <br>I'm not asking for a homo end, just one where Shinoa doesn't undeniably win. Something nice and open-ended and easy on the imagination is all I need.</br>  <br>Indeed, hence my nomination of it in 's post.</br>  <br>I keep putting off finishing the manga, it's a shame where the anime left off and best boy couldn't be animated.</br>  <br>I am. I'm weary of being tormented by cowardly writers and studios. After the Aldnoah Zero not-ending, I'm after full-on homo ends now. Being teased is no longer enough.</br>  <br>That hair looks so bad. Who finds that attractive?</br>  <br>But anon, best boy was animated.</br>  <br>The early '00s were a time of strange things.</br>  <br>Those are still common choices in video game hair selection, so clearly people who like them haven't been properly exterminated yet.</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I'd love a legitimately homo end, but I know it'll never happen. More than anything I just want Kagami to stop relentlessly shitting on every aspect of Mika's life and let him be cared for the most by the person he cares for the most in turn. That's the absolute least he deserves for all he's been through.</br>  <br>I think they gave her a few more scenes. And the fanbase is extremely vocal so it makes it look even more serious.</br>  <br>The official art for this show always got me.<br><br>I'm still mad with what happened with Kagami and I can't hate that 'two seconds' guy.<br><br> You will never share a body with six of your brothers. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because it's fujobait. Blatant, 90s fujobait.</br>  <br>Either way, I can't stand her and I want some vampire to suck her dry and then piss in her skull.</br>  <br>where's the raw for this? I want to translate it.</br>  <br>Slightly bigger.</br>  <br>The official art was great. It went from casual like pic related to almost shameless sluttiness.</br>  <br><br>I remember watching this anime because of the gay art and in the end I thought it wasn't even that gay<br>Same thing with Trinity Blood, damn this artist and my dumb young self</br></br></br>  <br>The art trolled a lot of people, but it wasn't like it was a boring series. Sure, the ending was ambiguous as usual but it didn't take a brain surgeon to figure out Ban and Ginji were basically a married couple.</br>  <br>Karma's ass</br>  <br>A poor married couple.<br><br> taking showers in sprinklers  <br> sleeping in a car <br> sleeping on benches  <br> begging for food <br><br>It was a lot of fun, now I want to rewatch it.<br><br>The third ed, where they moved a little closer and the fourth ed I had no idea what the hell was going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice! I wish Hamatora had been this good.</br>  <br>Mika gets only suffering from his families. This time is not exception.</br>  <br>Shared adversity is all part of the package deal. After the reams of shit they went through across the scope of the series, nothing's breaking those two up.</br>  <br>Shinoa is letting him borrow Yuu currently but we all know  he will die in the end for being an expat of the human race </br>   decide to read Reborn <br> like Yamato and Enma <br> Chrom is cute <br> don't see what people see in Hibari, prince or those other fags <br> still reading more, quality going down hill and everywhere <br> for some reason start liking Hibari and don't know why <br><br>On a different note, I have no idea what the hell is going on anymore in DGM, it's nice that Hoshino has come back but I am quite confused still after trying to re-read things here and there. <br><br>I don't get why people say it's fujo now, maybe aside the fact that Kanada's waifu was given a penis but I don't see it. Those outfits were lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I had read a little of the manga beforehand and recall it being a pretty heavy on the female fanservice, so I was a bit surprised when I eventually saw the anime's official art.</br>  <br>Titmonster Hevn was a bit of a smokescreen, but it became pretty apparent early on that she was basically just static noise and every freak and weirdo in town was trying to pry Ban and Ginji apart for their own little agendas and that was going to be the crux of the series: those two vs the world.</br>  <br>I just want to see Ceylan and Guren   hug  </br>  So, which one of the AOTY candidates will become an AOTY?  Charlotte.  I think both are pretty shit.<br>My vote goes to Classroom Crisis for being at least a tiny bit interesting.</br>   AOTY <br><br>Neither are even AOTS.</br></br>  How cucked are the nips that they can't even make a militaristic anime where their joke army fights against a real enemy?  <br> Overlord <br>We haven't seen any important scenes yet, only waifu-war fodder<br><br> GATE <br>Needs to be pick up with the politics and fast.

He even bounced off the asphalt</br>  <br> Implying the King isn't done breaking the tomato <br>He's going to make soup out of Yuya</br></br>  <br>But it's not the same!</br>  <br>Why does the KINGU like breaking people?</br>  <br> 64 episodes in already <br> still no sight of Ruri <br><br>Why is this allowed? You told me there would be flashbacks /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Where's that interdimensional cross gone wrong leading to a timeskip where Yuya never aged only to return to Standard, find everything destroyed and Zuzu with Hughgo going to happen?  <br>Because she's either dead thanks to Yuto and he didn't have the heart to tell Shun or she was always evil in the first place and sold Xyz out. <br><br>Get ready for Serena/Yuzu vs. Ruri/Rin Fusion bowl.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't want you to get hurt anymore <br>Never understood this, did he punch her in the stomach or something?</br></br>  <br>I like your taste in decks.</br>  <br> we'll have to wait until episode 78 for her to appear <br><br>This is true suffering.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuto and Ruri were dueling one day <br> Yuto beats Ruri <br> Academia invades at that moment and she is helpless from just getting beaten  <br> Gets kidnapped <br> Yuto goes EGAO mode and starts destroying people and carding them to save Ruri <br> Yuto is never the same </br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, is it weird that I'm expecting Yuri and Serena's memories have been altered by Leo so that they don't remember one another? Because I really doubt that they have no connection since all three other Yuya/Yuzu pairs are so connected.  <br>Worst boys deserve to get carded.</br>  <br><br>You could not pay me to drop a Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, no matter how radical the story changes were.</br></br>  <br>Because it entertains us.</br>  <br> Ruri is more scared of Yuto than Acedemia goons and joins them willingly </br>  <br>Yeah, though it'll probably be bad/mediocre like the 5D's manga was.<br>This Arc-V manga seems to be making the same mistake that made me dislike the 5D's manga so much, so I have no expectations here.</br></br>  <br> tfw I don't want to pay for those goddamn tokens </br>  <br>Maybe, I doubt it though. Yuri seems to be a complete oddity when it comes to the Fruits.</br>   you will never fall in their trap   <br> you will never create stupid ass card effects for Konami </br>  <br>Good. Rafflesia is smelly, she can stay in OCGland.</br>  <br>Rafflesia can use her holes on me anytime she wants.</br>  <br><br><br> Mfw I moved today hundreds of Time-Space Trap Holes, Myrmileos and the other sluts at double price because people it's stupid and buys into OCG exclusive hype </br></br></br>  <br> This card cannot be destroyed by card effects or targeted, don't even look at it either <br> If it IS destroyed, just grab another monster per its effect to special summon it again, no big deal <br> When this card does something: Destroy something or two somethings <br><br>I liked it when monsters used to have single effects.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's just hope some good cards come out of it.</br>  <br>But she smells like zombie-type monsters.</br>  <br>You forgot<br> When a card or effect is activated, negate the activation and destroy it </br></br>  <br>Looks at all those cute monster girls. They must smell like sweet flower nectar.</br>  <br><br> waaaahh why Konami prints good cards </br></br>  <br>You mean<br> When a card or effect is activated, negate the activation, tear the card in half and then punch your opponent in the face </br></br>  <br>Extra Deck Performapals are my main hope.</br>  <br>I think your looking for Aromages. Those girls are real flowers.</br>  <br>lol ehhhhhh</br>  <br> I defend bad game design purely exploited for profit </br>  <br>Dunno about that. We thought Serena was pretty bad at first too. But while she may act a little rougher than Yuzu, shes still good at heart.</br>  <br>Yuri cards people for being in his way. At least Serena thought that soldiers should fight and die honourably.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Konami is not a charity, never was, and never will be brah.<br>It's literally shitter mentality to reject good cards based on some useless moral code regarding what is fair or not. If a card is good, you use it if you can, period.<br><br>Also all the effects you guys mentioned are just standard generic "good effects", these aren't overpowered. Tellarknights are the worst deck in the current Tier 1 and got all of that. Grow a pair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Man I expected Yuya to lose to Jack but at least be able to go toe to toe with him. Like in a way to say this kid was better than expected or something.  This is out of nowhere but would anyone happen to have that shitty Zexal Olympic special lying around? I need it for animation stuff.  <br>Look at this stooge, defending those Japanese Jews.<br>Probably enjoys playing Abyss and Necloth decks.</br></br>  <br>TCG officially died when they made Minerva a prize card</br>  <br>Just because you can create a power creep does not mean you should. It's poor design and poor balancing when you're forcing yourself to create a power creep in order to dethrone current or past metas in order to sell new cards. <br><br>They could have just as easily kept it to simple effects without need for massive searches, negations, destructions, monster stealing, etc. and still had the game move at a faster and move intelligible pace than MTG. <br><br>The game is in such a bad place because of these 'good cards' that it complete and utterly eradicates older cards almost every time to the point where only a handful of older cards are even worth a damn and only because they existed in a context of brokenness when they released as well. They have gotten to the point where they aren't going to power creep any further without literally banishing half the opponent's deck per ever special summon. <br><br>The game needs to be rebooted and fixed or at the very least start trying to follow both OCG/TCG banlists and stop creating such ridiculous cards such as S0 Hope Zexal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It died way earlier than that, my friend.</br>  <br>Yuya nearly won and the only reason he lost was because Jack pulled an Action Card out of his ass at the last minute.</br>  <br>O/TCG died when Xyz were created. Even Synchros could at least have been dealt with and the banlist wasn't nowhere near as retarded. There is a reason Zexal characters are like Super Saiyan Demonbanes, because their summoning method reflects it.</br>  <br>Yuya wouldn't have had one of his monsters if he hadn't used an action card, and had Rebellion attacked, Jack would have just negated it with his trap card. <br><br>Yuya was never in control from the moment he fusioned and xyz'd.</br></br></br>  Which Yu has the best summoning chant for their DRAGON  <br>That was just baffling, Minerva wasn't even a promo card. I was expecting something like Stardust Sifr.<br>If we're lucky, it'll be released in next year's World Superstars, but considering the fact that Blood Mephist and Number 106 STILL haven't been reprinted, I'm not so sure</br></br>  <br>Yuusei</br>  <br> stop creating such ridiculous cards such as S0 Hope Zexal. <br>BUY MORE HOPE<br>BUY MORE XYZ<br>BUY MORE RANK 4</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't have any hope for Minerva unless you want to spend $500+.</br>  <br><br>reminder that if he hadn't fused astro and chrono would've negated effects, letting odd-eyes win the duel</br></br>  <br>Pretty much that. Rule of thumb is to never put over somebody new at the expense of your main star. Yuya should NOT be jobbing at this stage of the game. There's a reason you have other characters. The other characters should be doing the job so when Yuya defeats the one who defeated new character he looks stronger. The point of battle stories is to put over someone, namely the main hero. I don't understand the reasoning of making Yuya job.</br>  <br>Yuya would have won if he didn't summon Rune-eyes.</br>  <br>The sad thing is almost all of the Arc-V cards are utter garbage compared to the current meta and you need luck draws on both sides just to be able to win, even against lower decks like Noble Knights. Xyz have completely and utterly ruined the game.</br>  <br> Shounen Shit eaters </br>  <br>The game needs a lot of things but Im neither a Konami rep that can change these things or the Mother Teresa to hear your crying, I play what gives me the best % of winning. Simple as that.<br>Reasons like emotional attachment or fake sense of honor it's shitter mentality, if you think like that you're not different from the people wanting to be like Kirito, a super special Gary Stu snowflake with your petdeck.<br><br><br> Necloth  <br><br>It's Nekroz in the TCG champ, try to keep up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Noble Knights <br> winning against anything </br></br>  <br> What is character progression </br>  <br>Reminder that anime Timegazer negates traps that TARGET. Reject Reborn doesn't.</br>  <br> Xyz have completely and utterly ruined the game. <br>Not really, powercreep has ruined the game.</br></br>  <br> Nekroz <br>Just as bad as Evilswarm.</br></br>  <br> Using TCG terms <br>Why would you do this?</br></br>  <br>The sad thing is many players will never enjoy the game outside the meta.</br>  <br>Yuto snapped, went full DRAGON against Academia, accidentally hurt Ruri.<br><br>Same thing will happen to Yuzu<br><br>Moral of the story, never go full dragon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I play what wins, doesn't mean it's any less stupid or any less fair. The decks and cards have gotten stupidly out of control, and KoA has no idea what they're doing with the banlist and cards. They think just banning Djinn and L. Chain will somehow fix the over-representation of Nekroz and some of the easy combos of the other decks, but it wont fix a damn thing. <br><br>What is the point of creating new cards like D/D/D, RR, IgKnights, etc. when they can't do a damn thing to any of the decks? The purpose of new cards is to sell, not sit on the back burner because you have already created such ridiculous cards that the power creep is getting to the point where it can't top them without either a reset on the whole system or massive bans like Dragon Rulers, and it's quite clear the latter is out of the question when they can't even get the banlist out at the appropriate time and then result to basically insulting the playerbase. The only cards that come out with any sense of power creep anymore are Xyz cards and the majority of them are piss ass easy Rank 4 Xyz. <br><br>Hell you could probably fix a lot of the problems just by fixing the fucking Ranks of the cards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more that Rank 4's have given decks too much utility, especially with an extra deck at 15 cards.</br>  <br>Who is the target audience for Arc-V?<br><br>Kids.<br><br>Kids like simple stories with a relatable hero overcoming odds. If the hero does lose, it should never be done as a job. And more importantly there should be signs of foul play done by the adversary. If the hero has to lose, make him lose honorably.<br><br>For example Yugi was a good hero. He wasn't perfect by any means. But he was good at what he did and the few times he lost was because of things outside of the rules of engagement. <br><br>Yuya right now is to damn pathetic to root for. He is the complete opposite of what a hero should be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that Yuya isn't invincible is one of the best things about him. Rather than always being the ace like Yugi, Judai, and Yusei, because he isn't the best, you get a better sense of his growth.<br>They started something similar for Yuma, but it was poorly executed.<br><br>It also creates a better sense of tension. Yeah, we know as the protagonist, he'll win again, but the fact that he loses is better for storytelling.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These are the current TCG Official translations.<br>Don't tell me you actually use and say fanslations like Nephilim instead of Construct, Killer instead of Towers, Revise Dragon instead of Leviathan, etc.<br><br>That shit is weaboo "nippon banzai XD" as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd be surprised actually, their equip spells can quickly over-whelm even some of the newer archetypes.<br><br>True, but a lot of Xyz have huge powercreeps. <br><br>Not unless they play very specified formats with their own custom banlists they wont.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you start to limit the extra deck, Synchros get hurt even more, not sure about Fusion or Xyz</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure shonen heroes like Naruto, Ichigo, Luffy, etc have been defeated at some point, only to later get a rematch and win</br>  <br>"Translations"<br><br>Just like how Utopia is a translation, right?</br></br></br>  <br>why do you want go through a hell like that?</br>  <br>Where the fuck do you think you are?</br>  <br>If done right you can feel tension even if the hero always wins in the end.<br><br>For example Pegasus was shown to cheat to win. Yugi lost not because he was bad at playing cardgames but because his opponent was a cheat.<br><br>Other examples include when he lost to Kaiba because he was willing to kill himself for a duel.<br><br>Yuya simply job to Jack, clean as a fiddle. No outside interference, no cheating.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I use the official names for the OCG like Odd Eyes Pendelum Dragon and Entermate Whip Viper. Get on my level.</br>  <br>While I agree that Konami is going full retard on the competitive stage, such problem is meaningless to them because the numbers (sales) speak by themselves.<br><br>The game is selling very good in the west because they catter to kids, Konami doesn't actually try to compete with Magic, the more mature game. They know they can't, and that's why our competitive scene prize and caring wise it's a joke.<br>The game also does good enough in Japan, even versus actual competence (Bushiroad).<br><br>Essentially as many times stated by Konami reps officially and extra oficially on DGZ, Konami doesn't care for the competitive scene because the big money comes from kids that doesn't even know what is the banlist.<br><br> What is the point of creating new cards like D/D/D, RR, IgKnights, etc. when they can't do a damn thing to any of the decks?  <br><br>Again, kids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuya's d ragon  is feeling funny.  <br> even versus actual competence (Bushiroad) <br><br>Only because their card games are even more shit.</br></br></br>  <br>And thus the tension is lost.<br><br>If you can show the the main character can win against the big bad so early in your story, where's the build-up? Where's the "getting stronger"?<br><br>The whole backbone of 80% of shounen stories is, "I will get stronger... MOTO STRONGER!"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was Levice Dragon?</br>  <br>Precisely, and I get that they like catering to kids, good on them, but at some point they've got to realize that when a kid goes to a tournament only to get bodied by some fat pretentious neckbeard and then proceed to talk about how the kid's deck is bad and he's a shitter, it ruins the community and makes the kids not even want to play anymore. I've sadly seen this before at locals, it's pathetic.<br><br>At some point they're going to have to realize that they need to cater to both ends of the spectrum, you can create new cards for kids while keeping the game balanced and competitive and reducing the power creep, it's not impossible.</br></br></br>    What's the best way to livestream this time around?    <br>Do kids really buy this shit?<br><br>I see more kids playing Magic or Vanguard, majority of Yugioh seems to be people in their late teens, early 20's.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>inly in our dreams anons...only in our dreams.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not using Nosferatu Lich and Thunder Bolt <br><br>You ain't wapanese enough.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much. A character losing shouldn't be a sign of weakness, it's a sign that he has to become stronger, everyone gets that.<br>Invincible heroes kill all tension</br></br></br>  <br> At some point they're going to have to realize that they need to cater to both ends of the spectrum <br><br>Considering that people like Julia, the leader of the entire official Judge program, goes and post shit like this, basically saying "lel why don't you go outside instead of playing yugayoh", I say it's not happening.</br></br></br>  <br>Konami only cares about Japan, where kids matter even more</br>  <br>Is this a flashback?</br>  <br>Very successful shows rarely show the hero losing. It's saved for important moments in the show. But it seems that Yuya is losing to much when it matters. Other times there was some excuse behind it but this time he simply did a job to Jack.</br>  <br>He's back?  This isn't old is it. </br>  <br>That's not what she's saying, jackass, she's say WE'RE NOT RELEASING THE LIST YET, STOP ASKING.</br>  <br>It has MLP type fandom issues.<br><br>Also its rarity structure/secondary market is awful.<br><br>I've heard its 13+ in nipland but damn the art sans a couple sluts is childish beyond belief. Deskbots being the face of me not believing its 13+.<br><br><br>CCGs are easier in Japanland. Murricans "bitch too much" to be worth a damn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just finished watching this, pretty fucking boring.  <br>That whole scene with the SDF setting up and that terrorist destroying com infrastructure still makes my dick moist</br>  <br>I enjoy most dramas and don't need excessive violence and other non-sense to keep me entertained. But every character in this film has the same monotone personality and most of the scenes involved small chats (mostly metaphors of Red Riding Hood) between the girl and the protagonist like some awkward first date, and less scenes of the special unit and police discussing the political nature of the entire situation.<br><br>The rotoscope animation isn't too appealing either.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, I'll kill you.</br>  <br><br>I remember when I had taste like a child too</br></br>  <br> rotoscope <br>Shows what you know about Oshii films.</br></br>  I've just finished PMMM anime. Is it worth watching the 1st and 2nd movies or I can skip straight to the 3rd one?  None of it is worth watching, should have skipped PMMM in its entirety.  <br>series is god tier<br>movies just shit on it<br>stop now while you're ahead</br></br></br>  <br>Movies 1 and 2 are recaps. Skip to 3.</br>  <br><br> shitting on PMMM or Rebellion <br>Did you know that you're more mainstream than mainstream when you do this?</br></br></br>  <br>Third movie is shitty fanfiction, don't bother.</br>  <br>Don't watch any of the movies. The series is fine by itself, you'll just be wasting your time.</br>  Third movie is the best part of the series, proceed  <br>The first two movies are literally just a compilation of the entire TV series so no, you don't have to watch them.</br>  <br>this</br>   Rebellion is hated on Reddit <br> Rebellion is loved on MAL <br><br>Oh no, what are /a/ hipsters to do?</br></br></br>  <br>Skip straight to the 3rd one.</br>  <br>Ignore what ridiculous Rebellion haters say.<br><br>Rebellion is the TV series' sequel respectively. Proceed.</br></br></br>  <br>rebellion is visually so spectacular that it would be remiss not to watch it.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6P4<wbr>9pNzDiq0</wbr>  [ ]<br>It sure is.</br></br>  <br>It's worth watching it all.</br>  <br>more like it's a clusterfuck of meaningless visuals</br>  <br>Not rhe same anon, but you can't seriously think that right? This isn't like eva, where the Christianity just was shoved in, each and every piece of symbolism in rebellion is relevant to the story. I didn't like the story, but the symbolism was on fucking point.</br>  <br>Who told you it was alright to skip parts?</br>  <br> Being this dense <br>I didn't like the movie either but most of the visuals are very direct and easy to understand symbolism.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Agree with these guys. The series was ended perfectly, there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back.<br><br>And don't give me that meaningless "H-Homura's character development! She was left sad!!!" that's just the outcome of the story.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched up to mami's death and dropped it. Figured there was no point watching it knowing her theme song would never play again</br>  <br>It does play again though.</br>  <br><br>And Mami's theme isn't the only one that is amazing.</br></br>  <br> there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back. <br>If there's a story that can be told, that is enough reason. There's no actual logical basis to rejecting a sequel just for being a sequel. <br><br>And there's no such thing as a 'perfect ending'. Nothing is above re-examination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty though.</br>  <br>The true answer is you can ski straight. But I would rather give it time and watch the movies later.</br>  <br>This. Based Homura. Leave now before more smoilers.</br>  <br>Don't watch the Rebellion Story. Read the Different Story instead.</br>  <br>You can skip the first two movies. But don't skip straight to the third movie. Give it a week or so.</br>  <br> yandere Mami <br>Kowaii</br></br>  <br>It's Candeloro talking.</br>  <br>The movie didn't have to be as shitty as it was. Felt they only had like 45 minutes worth of plot and needed to stretch it out somehow.<br><br>I prefer the manga version of Rebellion since it doesn't feel as flabby with filler.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally implode</br>  <br>Candeloro is just Mami after she's given up all hope.</br>  <br>Are the manga canon?</br>  <br>Well, you shouldn't consider anything beyond series and movies to be canon. Manga are done by Hanokage and not by Gen.</br>  <br>Yes, except when they aren't. <br><br>Different Story is canon while Homura's Revenge isn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press released Homura's Revenge already?</br>  <br> different story is canon <br>As far as I would like, as long as there's no word from the creator of the original series, it cannot be considered canon.</br></br>  <br>What is this</br>  <br>It adapts a canon Drama CD and explicitly takes place in an alternate timeline from episode 10. It's canon enough and a good read. <br><br>Yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>The Butcher is part of the Magica Quartet, right? So if a manga says 'story by Magica Quartet' would it be considered canon?</br>   hurr canon <br>Who gives a shit, I hate you people, fuck you and the horses you respectively rode in on.</br>  <br>Fanfiction where Homura gets her revenge</br>  <br>upon whom</br>  <br>Kyubey.</br>  <br>What, again?</br>  <br>Yes. The only manga that's worse is Homura Tamura.<br><br> The life of a magical girl isn’t all fighting witches and collecting grief seeds. When they aren’t kicking butt, Homura Akemi and her friends face the same trials as normal high school girls! In this four-panel comedy, glimpse a sillier side of the girls from the bestselling Puella Magi Madoka Magica series! </br></br></br>  I Just Watched the Third Movie today and I hated it ¬¬, the anime is good itself, you don,t need the movies  <br>Why is it bad? The revenge one I mean.</br>  <br>The worst part of the movies is the replacement BG in the morning sequence. The plates clearly have cherry tomatoes on them but the BG in the movies has these big beefsteak monsters on the same vine. I can't believe someone said "We had to rush these out the first time, let's do this right and fuck up the tomatoes."</br>  <br> glimpse a sillier side of the girls from the bestselling Puella Magi Madoka Magica series! <br>They just don't give a shit anymore, do they?</br></br>  <br>The characters just feel like caricatures of themselves. Worse than the way Rebellion fucked up Kyoko and Mami. <br><br>The actual plot of the manga is that Homura and Madoka remember the end of the TV series and decide to stop any tragedies from happening. The main conflict is that Kyubey also remembers and needs bitches to become witches.</br></br></br>  <br> Not having your own opinions <br> Not knowing Rebellion is   shit <br> Only yuri fags and homu lovers could enjoy the absolute trash that is rebellion.  </br></br></br>  <br>Suzune Magica is canon.</br>  <br>how<br>does<br>her<br>spine<br>work</br></br></br></br></br>  This is all you need to know about rebellion, if you liked this; you'll like rebellion, if you didn't you won't.      <br>It's magic.</br>  <br>spooky</br>  Good bye everyone.    <br>Sayaka-chaaaaan</br>  Half of Rebellion PN scanned. <br><br>Bored out of my mind.</br></br>  <br> Worse than the way Rebellion fucked up Kyoko and Mami.  <br>Except there was nothing wrong with Mami and Kyouko. We already know that Mami's weakness came about because she was desperate not to be alone, and in Rebellion's dream world Mami has an artificial past of having been with Bebe for longer than she can remember, and having formed a team with the others. She has no reason to lose her head, in any sense of the phrase. Kyouko doesn't discuss her past but it's fair to assume that she has fake, saccharine memories like Mami up until her scenes with Homura cause her to remember her real past, and even then you have to remember that this Kyouko already had her conflict and resolution with Sayaka off-screen, before the events of the series ending. <br><br>Rebellion's characterization of the two is spot-on. <br> b-but muh despair! <br>It's like you didn't even watch the series ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Reddit</br>    <br> cause her to remember her real past <br>Did this even happen? The only other shown to recall something on her own was Mam, which presumably was followed by Nagisa dumping all the info on them as they got together to face Homulily.</br></br>  <br>Probably not entirely. Bits and pieces? This scene seems to show a Kyouko who remembers enough death in her life to be rather fed up with losing people close to her, and after this Kyouko seems more jaded and in line with her former self—her (lack of) reaction to Kyubey speaking sticks out to me.</br>      <br/>      What is the relationship between Mami and Bebe at the end of the movie? Were Bebe still living with Mami?  <br>Oriko Magica and The Different Story are definitely canon and also not shit. They also have stories that star the anime cast but focus more on Mami and Kyoko. <br> They take place in alternate timelines that Homura visited. <br><br>Madoka Magica the manga is a retelling of the series that's interesting but only crazy fans will care about it. The Rebellion Story manga can be found online and its much better than the movie that its based off of. <br><br>Kazumi Magica, Tart Magica, and Suzune Magica are side stories that don't really contradict the canon of the anime. Tart Magica is probably the best of the three. <br><br>Homura's Revenge and Homura Tamura are non-canon and are just fanservice for the most part.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> PMMM <br>It's like I'm actually on tumblr.<br><br><br>The term canon means what is true within a fictional setting. And the only way you can prove something is true is to support it with facts. There is nothing in the main story (e.g. The movies or anime) that supports the events that took place in TDS. Thus you have no proof to support the fact the events from TDS are true in the same fictional setting as the anime/movies. You can Google the word canon to confirm the definition. Canon is about story narrative, which is why stories that don't connect in some way are not part of the same canon, and why everything is canon to itself. Also, just sharing characters and location is not enough to "connect" them, because in that case fan work would be canon as well.<br><br>If you want examples of series where side content is canon look at Nanoha or Raildex. Both of those stories have events that happened in side content referenced in the main setting.<br><br>Also note that TDS or the CD drama it's based on was not written by Gen, but Masaki Hiramatsu. A person who is not on the anime production staff.<br>http://wiki.puella-magi.net/Masaki_<wbr>Hiramatsu<br><br><br><br> if I like it it's canon <br>Do you keep realize how you never actually say why it's canon you just keep stating it?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa no longer henshin into Bebe. Nagisa is now Mami's daughter.</br>  <br>What about battle pentagram   it's all homura's dream  </br>  <br> if I like it it's canon <br>Works for me. It's not like this is /co/ where comics have defined canons.</br></br>  <br>We don't exactly know her relationship with Nagisa is but Nagisa's definitely her loli.</br>  <br>I'm really happy today because Rifyu is back. He posted a Umaru~n comic on pixiv.</br>   <br>Let me restate that Kazumi, Tart, and Suzune don't directly contradict the anime's canon but aren't tied to its plot either. <br><br>The Different Story and Oriko do take place in different timelines thanks to Homura shenanigans. <br><br>Madoka and Rebellion manga are a retelling of the events that occurred in the anime and movie. <br><br>Homura's Revenge and Homura Tamura are fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is wrong with you? Apply the definition of canon to the events of Battle Pentagram and see if it comes out canon. You should be able to save this on your own.<br><br><br>I hope you realize I was making fun of you.<br>I don't know what you think canon is, but you clearly wrong. Because you seem think it's just something to shitpost about. What's canon is used when answering questions related to the series. The point of knowing what's canon is so that if a question arrives you use relevant information to answer it. Not something unrelated. Like trying to answer a question about the Book of Revelations with something that happened in Genesis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oriko did nothing wrong!</br>  <br>You're right. You sure did restate it. But you didn't add anything new or relevant.<br><br> don't directly contradict the anime's canon <br>You keep saying this like it's relevant. Did you even read what I wrong or good the word canon itself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Oriko and Different Story and so they're canon to me. Seems simple enough. Thanks anon. <br><br>You shouldn't have your panties in a bunch about what is part of the one true canon though.</br></br></br>  <br> so they're canon to me <br>It's like you can't even read.<br>What's the point of coming to a discussion board if you're not actually here to discuss anything, and only here to endless spew what you think (but can't prove) and then hope people praise you.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't think it's relevant when it comes to talking about the canon of fiction if stories set in the world directly contradict the source material or not? Please explain yourself.</br>  <br>Hope nobody else is foolish enough to actually think this is true.</br>  <br>You're discussing even less. Instead of talking about which of the manga you enjoy, you instead need 'proof' of what canonical for some reason. Seems like you have a one track mind.</br>  <br>God damn, I hate you retards. You didn't even read what is the very first post I made.<br>Something JUST not contradicting doesn't make it canon, because by that logic near everything is canon.</br></br>  <br>Not contradicting canon of the anime and being set in the same world as the anime make the manga canon enough.</br>  <br> Instead of talking about which of the manga you enjoy <br>No, you fucking idiot. Jesus, go back to tumblr. No one gives a shit what you like. You are here to discuss the series itself, you are not here to talk about what you like. This is not your blog.<br><br> for some reason <br>READ the posts in front of you. ALL the way through.<br>I already explained why you need to know what's canon. So when having discussion about the topic you answer with relevant information.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka Magica the manga is a retelling of the series that's interesting but only crazy fans will care about it. The Rebellion Story manga can be found online and its much better than the movie that its based off of. <br><br> Hope nobody else is foolish enough to actually think this is true. <br><br>Yeah, same here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to ask. Are you legitimately brain dead? No, honest question. Because what you said was already specifically addressed.<br><br>For the good of the Earth, just kill yourself. You are clearly not smart enough to ever contribute anything of worth.</br></br></br>  <br> I already explained why you need to know what's canon <br>Okay, say why you NEED to what's canon again in seven words or less.</br></br>  <br>So you don't answer with irrelevant information.</br>  <br>You should calm down. That's just how canon works when it comes to anime and spin off manga. Your lack of powerlevel is showing.</br>  <br>I mostly agree with you. And just one question. Is Rebellion canon with your opinion? <br><br>There is nothing in the main story (TVA) that supports the events that took place in Rebellion. Just like TDS, the plot of Rebellion is one possible way that doesn't contradict to the setting of TVA.<br><br>You know who the creators were not important in the definition of canon right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> your wrong because I say so <br> this is how it works because I say so <br>Again, the Earth is bad enough as it is. Do your part to clean it up. Think of the children.</br></br></br>  <br>That is seven words or less. Guess there's just nothing to discuss with a dumbass like you.</br>  <br>You have yet to prove me wrong.</br>  <br>Coming from the retard who can't even read.</br>  <br><br>samefag.</br></br>  <br> you didn't prove me wrong because I say so! <br>I recommend just over dosing on something. It's painless that way.<br><br>Because you are honestly stupid enough to think saying nothing other than "UR WRONG" proves you right. You didn't even address what I said in the first post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Insults are the crutch of the ignorant. And you're boring.</br>  <br><br>Mami is a mediocre character, every medium; I have enjoyable time reading Kyoko backstory.<br>But dropped Mami story because she´s extreme optimistic</br></br></br>  <br> blatantly claiming something is canon just because. <br><br>I want tumblr to leave.</br></br></br>  <br>What is there in your first post that even needs to be addressed?</br>  <br>I want reddit to leave.</br>  <br> opinion <br>No. Stop using words you don't understand.<br> everything is canon to itself <br>Read this part? Rebellion is a direct continuation. It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8 related to each other?"<br>Ether way. Homura's black wings state the events of Rebellion are to happen.<br><br>And TDS does contradict the anime. At multiple points.<br>First off, there is an after life even though Madoka had not contracted yet.<br>And there are more. But I have other retards to tell off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do you think you are welcome here at all, tumblr? Also, don't take my posts that are going to be deleted by a tumblr mod who doesn't belong here either as proof you belong.<br><br>And when you are literally saying nothing at all, the best thing to do is insult you. Because it's the best means to point out your faults. If you don't like that negative words can be applied to you, then don't be negative.<br><br><br>How about the whole thing, fuckwit.<br><br>Or how about this. Link a single source anywhere that states your made up definition of canon is true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rebellion is worth watching for eye candy alone.  <br> not opinion <br>Okay then what it is? Please state.<br>  <br> everything is canon to itself <br>So TDS is canon to itself, TVA also, and Rebellion. Okay. <br> direct continuation.  <br>A new concept here. What is direct continuation? Is it different to canon? Why can't you just call it canon? If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation?<br> It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8.. <br>No. You are trying to separating each episode in one completed anime. Your metaphor is wrong because if it's right, we now have to think each episodes are canon to themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The series was ended perfectly, there was absolutely not a single reason it should've been brought back. <br>The cliffhanger.</br></br>  <br>Okay. I am not trying to ask any difficult stuff. Is Rebellion canon or not? Please answer with some reasoning.</br>  <br><br> I agree with what you say expect for for everything you said is wrong <br>I love retards like this.<br> A new concept here <br>No, it's not a new concept. It's just another word. Episode two a direct continuation of episode one. This isn't some mythical idea, it's just a term that means exactly what it's stated to be.<br> If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation? <br>No. Because it's not official. It's like you failed high school math and don't get that concept that not all rectangles are squares. Same thing here. To be canon something must be official, but not everything that's official must be canon.<br><br>And the full definition of canon was given in my very first post with all of its rules. Apply that to the event of Rebellion and if it fits then it's canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebellion is canon. <br><br>It is a direct sequel to the original series, by the same writer and animation studio.</br></br></br>  <br>Madoka is American, thus she is best girl.<br><br>  She probably only wears the lewdest of American flag styled bra's and panties on the 4th of july </br></br></br>  <br>... this is a thing?<br><br>well, fuck.</br></br></br>    <br>What? Tamura is fun and a best. I think you just hate Homura focused things or something.</br>    So what's your favorite pairing? <br><br>Kyoko/Mami is my favorite.</br></br>  <br>Better question? What's your favorite past time?<br><br>Mine is treating the characters from Madoka like shit, using them to bait in Madoka threads, and being an all around asshole.<br><br>Oh wait, I just listed you're favorite past time.<br><br>Though, I could be wrong. You could be wholly innocent. If that's true you should have no issue trying to prove how you're not a scumbag who degrades and insults the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, the plot is really dull.</br>  <br>Mami / the trash</br>  <br>You sound mad, you should calm down and try to enjoy things.</br>  <br>You clearly don't like Kyouko and Mami is you like pairing them together. I mean. If you liked them why would you shit on them. You don't like them as they are in the series, you only like them for the shallow shipping you do with them. Which isn't actually the real them, obviously.</br>  <br>Ah, so I was spot on. Thank you for clarifying. I always have slight doubt each time someone posts crack shit, but it's usually the second reply that seals the deal. If it's anything along the lines of "autism" or "u mad" it's a safe bet that it's on of your standard Madoka thread shitposters.<br><br>It's good to know that you are so mentally inept you can't even pretend to prove you're not treating the characters like shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for shitposter.</br>  <br>You're assuming quite a bit about why I enjoy this pairing. <br><br>No wonder this thread is so dead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>samefag.</br></br>  <br><br>So what's your favorite pairing, anons?</br></br>  <br> I don't like a pairing for anything about it or the characters in it <br>And it's obvious you're still dodging the obvious questions made in the posts. e.g. Why you treat the characters like shit. And you are clearly dodging it because you know you can't prove you're not.<br><br>Didn't I tell you to fuck off, tumblr?</br></br></br></br>  Bare Mado legs or covered Homu legs?  <br>And you're dodging the question on what your favorite pairing is. If you answer my question, I'll answer yours.</br>  <br><br> 61 seconds apart <br>Now this is actual samefagging.<br><br>I wonder. Do you have real purpose in life or do you just wake up every day thinking of new ways to be a shallow asshole?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Covered Homu legs.</br>  <br>So what's your favorite pairing?</br>  <br>I don't see the characters as just parts in a pairing. I appreciate them as for what they are, and appreciate them all equally.<br><br>And part of appreciating them is appreciating who the characters themselves like. e.g. Madoka and Homura like each other, and Kyouko and Sayaka like each other.<br><br>But guess what?<br>This isn't your blog. You're not here to talk about your likes and dislikes you're here to discuss anime and manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All pairs that don't degrade and insult the characters involved.</br>    Did Homura do the right thing or not?  <br>I'm discussing my favorite pairing in a media franchise that includes anime and manga. You still haven't stated your favorite pairing.</br>  <br>God, you are such a fucking scumbag.<br><br>And no, you are not discussing anything anime related, you are discussing yourself. You're the same as every retard who makes a post like "XD me and friends are gonna go watch Naruto, should i take pics?"<br><br>Lastly. I did answer your question, you are just a brain dead idiot.<br><br>Your "favorite pair" shits on Kyouko and Mami's characters, and is thus low quality posting and does not belong here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   here and:<br><br><br><br>61 one seconds between posts, with same angry tone and choice of words?<br>Yeah, you're samefag is strong. Still haven't posted you're favorite pairing though. It's almost as if you don't want to discuss the series at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what's you favorite pairing, anon?</br>  <br>I wasn't pretending to samefag, you moron. The replies were to different posts.<br><br>Posting your favorite pair IS NOT discussing the series, you fucking idiot.</br></br></br>  I'd like to see black and red work together  <br>You x Suicide</br>  <br>This. Just watch wixoss if you want magic and cute girls suffering.</br>  <br><br> I agree with what you say expect for for everything you said is wrong <br> I love retards like this. <br>It was a way to make fun of you. I am relieved that you understood this.<br><br> If some pixiv artists draw a sequel of Rebellion, then it becomes a direct continuation? <br> No. Because it's not official. It's like you failed high school math and don't get that concept that not all rectangles are squares. Same thing here. To be canon something must be official, but not everything that's official must be canon. <br><br>Well? I asked the concept of direct continuation. Not canon. I asked how direct continuation is different to canon. Because you said "Rebellion is a direct continuation." not "Rebellion is canon" in the post  <br><br>So direct continuation is another word of canon? Some kind of prequel is not canon? Is it a necessary or sufficient condition to be the canon? Please answer.<br><br>If you can list the necessary and sufficient conditions to be the canon, that makes it easy.<br><br><br>So the fact that Rebellion is a direct sequel of the TVA, created by the same writer and animation studio, makes it canon? I am okay with this. Without Gen, absolutely non-canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember to stay on topic, anon. I don't think that pairing has anything to do with the series.</br>  <br> this artist draws Yuuno x Nanoha doujin <br>Man. They're scum in everything they do.<br><br><br> It was a way to make fun of you <br>Yeah, no, that' doesn't imply anything negative about anyone. So it's not making fun of them.<br><br> concept of direct continuation <br>Still not a concept. Learn to fucking read.<br>Not only that. But all your questions have already been answer IN THE VERY FIRST POST I made.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> black and red <br>You mean Homura and Kyoko, right? They did work really well together in the anime. Until someone died.</br></br>  <br> this person will never kill themselves even though they are clearly worthless to everything and everyone <br>Why?<br><br>And no. As it was already explained, you posting your favorite pair is not about the series. It's about you. Just because you keep ignoring it doesn't mean you're right.<br><br><br>Funny how obvious crack shitposters are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please make sure than the term "canon" used here means "canon to the Madoka TVA" because everything is canon to itself according to the post  that could make things confused</br>  <br> stay on topic <br>Shouldn't you take your own advice?<br>YOu're not posting on topic. Not only are oblogging, you're posting random characters that have nothing to do with the Madoka series.<br>The only characters I see in your posts are shallow knocks off with red and yellow hair.<br><br><br> begging for any excuse at all post garbage that treats the characters like shit <br><br>What's it like knowing you will never ever be a quality person?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Skip straight to the 3rd one.</br>  <br>Talking about the characters in the series is more on-topic than insulting the people posting in the thread. <br><br>Nice meta-posting. <br><br><br>I prefer to ship Homura with Sayaka, especially after Rebellion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  i love homu  <br> replying to yourself <br>Just stop.<br><br>And you are not talking about the characters, as you have been told a 1000 times before. You are talking about your own shipping.<br><br>I keep trying to get you to talk about the characters, but you keep insisting people blog.<br>In short, you need to end yourself.<br><br>And in case it's not obvious to everyone else how it's obvious you are replying yourself. Both you and your pretend persona are dodging the exact same thing; how you treat the characters like shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's very lovable.</br>  <br>I understood that you are listing the Raildex as an example of canon series to the original Series. You know that Raildex is not any kind of prequel or sequel, and any kind of "direct continuation" to the original series right?<br><br>So, it seems that direct continuation has nothing to do with canon. Because something can be the canon to its original series without being the direct continuation. Then why did you say "Rebellion is a direct continuation. It's like you're asking "How are episode 7 and 8 related to each other?" to endorse the fact that Rebellion is canon in the post ?</br></br></br>  <br>she is very perfect</br>  Hello, sorry to interrupt. <br><br>Please take back your edgelord Kyon-kun. He's that one fuck that likes to write depressed/suicidal and drunken out of character Madokas with pseudo intellectual bullshit, while having her abuse Homura and belittle her friends. It was a cross over with Civ5. After that quest died, he kept making new ones and made another recently. We're all very worried for his mental health. But mostly just disturbed.<br><br>With love, /tg/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would you mind using a tripcode? It would make filtering you and your anger out much easier.</br>  <br>It helps that she's grown and changed so much throughout the series which gives her a lot of depth.</br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with your brain that you are so hung up on the term "direct continuation?"<br><br>And again, if you had any ability to read at all you'd already know the answer to your question Because it was already said.<br><br>If something is official and direct continuation then it is canon. You're right, something doesn't have to be a direct continuation to be canon, but it is one of the default things that make it canon if official.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Such a person never posted here. He's all yours, friend.</br>  <br>Oh look, there you go dodging the actual subject again. It's almost like you are out to prove you're shitposting and nothing more.</br>  <br>seeing her character develop was one of my favorite things about the series. Also it meant that there were so many flavors of homus to love.</br>  <br>The actual subject?<br><br>Oh right, Mami and Kyoko is my favorite pairing. But I thought you knew that already?<br><br>And I agree with  in that Homura is my favorite character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not even saying anything new now. You're just repeating what you said before.<br><br>The actual subject is how you degrade and insult the characters by pairing Mami and Kyouko together.<br><br>But again, it's obvious you already know this and are just looking for "excuses" to keep posting more and shit that insults them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My favorite thing about her character development was that when rewatching the anime you understand why she acts the way she does. <br><br>Especially in that first episode, like when Madoka asked if it was alright to use Homura's first name.</br></br></br>  <br>I just don't agree with your premise that shipping characters is degrading to them because they are fictional. <br><br>Why so serious?</br></br></br>  <br>Good enough. Thank you.<br> If something is official and direct continuation then it is canon. <br>That's the answer I wanted.<br><br>He just accepted the wraith arc is canon to the Madoka TVA. Because it's a direct continuation of Madoka TVA, and official. But I am not actually very happy to this. So let's add one thing to this.<br><br> If something is official animated series by the same writer and animation studio, and direct continuation(sequel) then it is canon. <br>It returned to this post  anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Defiantly. To be honest when i first watched madoka magica i thought she was just the edgy character. All i knew, thanks to /a/ spoilers was that she somehow became the "devil". But watching the series and then rebellion multiple times, her actions and ultimate choice in the end really made sense. She was trapped in the maze called reality and she not only found a way out, but a way to become the master of the labyrinth.</br>  <br> you're serious about adding 2+2 so ur wrong! <br>Nope. Not how it works. No one "serious" you just tell yourself that you so cop out of giving actual answers. It's self delusion.<br><br>And you, I'm sure, have been told many times that just because they are fiction doesn't mean you can't degrade them.<br><br>In the canon setting of the series Madoka/Homura and Kyouko/Sayaka have strong (romantic) feelings for each other. Note, strong is a term that means something is high in value. In the state of their feelings being strong for each other they are obviously in love with each other. Seeing as how if you portray the feelings they have as stronger than in canon they will only be even more attracted to each other that means the only other directed the feelings can travel in a crack setting is lower. This means that Madoka/Homura and Kyouko/Sayaka’s feelings are being portrayed as weak in the new crack setting because if they weren't being portrayed as weak they would still be in love with each other rather than their crack setting counter part. And obviously, weak is a term that means low in value. Now, remember what it meant to degrade something? To lower it in value. This is what you have done in your crack setting. You have made their canon feelings be portrayed as weak than what they are for the sake of pairing them without someone else for the sake of amusing yourself. <br><br>Of course you as a third party can not actually effect the canon characters to degrade them. What’s being discussed here is that in your personal portrayal of them they have been weakened and degraded. The issue is not that the canon characters have been changed, but that you as a viewer are saying negative things about them. You are saying their feelings are weak in your portrayal of them, thus you are degrading them. It doesn't actually have to effect the characters, it’s similar to insulting someone behind their back. Which means to insult someone without their knowledge of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thread always reduces to shit when the crack shitposting occurs.  <br>What you said is already part of the definition of being a direct continuation. If it's not made by the same people then the same project is obviously not being continued.</br>  <br>Sure are.</br>  <br>Please take him back. It's like he's made of fedoras.</br>  <br>Silly anon, I'm not reading any of that. You need to learn how to be brief. <br><br><br>Yeah, I thought she was the stock edgy new transfer student too. Think my opinion of her changed during that scene by the fountain.<br><br>When she finally broke down and told Madoka that she wasn't worthless and that the people that care would be sad if Madoka died.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to brag about being ignorant <br>So fucking disgusting.<br><br>And guess what? That's how you actual hold discussion. Whoa, crazy, right?<br><br>Discussion doesn't consist of just making baseless claims then going back and forth saying "ur wrong" and "no nuh uh ur wrong!" until someone gets bored and leaves.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People don't like to hold conversation with those who are consistently insulting them. <br><br>Please come back when you learn how to have a discussion like an adult.</br></br></br>  <br> feelings are numbers ok <br> 2+2 I'm so right oh god I love math <br>Math religion guy pls go.<br><br><br>Are you talking about the "Madoka should turn into Gretchen and kill Homura!" spammer guy? He gets banned sometimes when he posts. He usually spams how much he hates Homura and wants Madoka to kill her, or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> waaah you're insulting me <br>Cry more, scumbag. The only thing I have done is accurately use negative words to describe you. It your own fault those negative words apply to you, not mine.<br><br>The one who needs to act like an adult is you. Because you think "waah saying meanie head words" means that whatever the other person says is wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice samefagging. But you make it too obvious who you are when you dismiss the whole post and don't actually write a reply.</br>  <br>That spammer sounds like a really boring troll.</br>  <br>I'm sorry of your feelings are being hurt by someone who is accurately stating what you are.<br><br>You should also cease the crack spamming it isn't making you look anywhere near mature as you think you are.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the series portrays breakdowns really really well. Mami going serial killer was really surprising but made sense with her character.</br>  <br><br>The way you put words together makes it obvious you're samefagging</br></br>  <br>It's this guy, http://archive.4plebs.org/tg/search<wbr>/text/Kyon-kun/. But yeah, he's probably also that spammer.</wbr></br>  <br> dodging the actual subject again <br>Nah, it's not obvious who I am. You just nit pick key words and then give those key words an identity.<br><br> posting thumbnails <br>I know you're retarded and stupid. But come on.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does it make you feel less lonely?  <br>SayakaXMadoka a best</br>  <br> replying to yourself this late <br> this despreate for damage control after you did something as stupid as save a thumb nail <br>Protip. If your typing skills were less shit and you remembered to punctuate correctly it would be less obvious you're <br><br>Not to mention you are still continuing to avoid disguising the actual subject.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> take him back <br>We can't take back what was never ours!</br></br>  <br>Really? I always preferred Sayaka with Kyoko</br>  <br> damage control post to make it look like many people type the same shitty way you do </br>  Why are Madoka threads so shit nowadays? Why are there always those 2 shitposters that shit up threads trying to tell people that they don't live their life correctly? Why can't they see that, no matter how negative they think the others are, they are more toxic than the rest of them combined? Why can't janitor-kun ban those people forever? <br><br>Life is sad. I may have to start shitposting loudly in order to have all those posts deleted alongside mine.</br></br>  <br>Red looks better with Black.</br>  <br>Sure, if it's a very light shade of red!</br>  Madoka &gt; Kyoko &gt; Mami &gt; Sayaka &gt; Homura  <br><br>Just stop. It's obvious that everyone post that dodging actually discussing the topic at hand is you.<br><br>Oddly enough. Being an obnoxious, dismissing contradictory scumbag is not a common trait for people to have. So when multiple people do it in a low population thread it's a good chance it's the same person.<br><br>You, as always, just say "ur bad cuz I say so" while everyone who tells you off points out how you actions are negative, and gives the supporting process used to reach that conclusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka = Kyoko = Mami = Sayaka = Homura &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Nagisa</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Your definition of a "shit thread" is probably (ironically) shit.</br>  <br>But muh cheese!</br>  <br>Ignore it anon—good shitposters remain anon and ban evade, so there's no mod solution. The best filter is a mental filter.</br>    <br> caring about thread quality and not insulting the characters makes you a shitposter </br>  <br>Nah, those two are total bros. Besides I ship Homura/Madoka and Kyoko/Sayaka.<br><br>I agree, Nagisa is really terrible. Does she even have a soul gem?</br></br></br>    <br>Yes, now stop shitposting.</br>  <br>Those are 2 different posters, and there's nothing to discuss about. All you're doing is coming to a Madoka thread, going full nazi on everything that strays a little from the series/movies, and you insult people, REAL people, for "degrading" characters, FICTIONAL characters. This is just sad. If I knew you guys better, I'm pretty sure you would try to sue the author of all doujin and non-canon manga collection because "IT'S NOT LIKE THAT IN THE SERIES THEY DEGRADE CHARACTERS".<br><br>This is the way of thinking and kind of action that go against liberty of expression and artistic creation. It's sad. Very sad.</br></br></br>  <br>She does, it's the palish purple.candy-looking gem in her waist.</br>  <br>Please consider ending yourself. Your damage control is painful to watch.<br><br><br> it's shitposting because I don't like it!!!!! <br>Yeah, someone of actually care about quality and don't like rolling around in shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But this is a shit thread. Like all Madoka threads have been since the one about the Joan of Arc spin-off.</br>  <br>Damn, it's almost like you don't know how to read at all.<br> and you insult people, REAL people <br>Read <br>You can't complain about being called a scumbag when you ARE a scumbag.<br> FICTIONAL characters <br>Read <br><br>Do you see how the ONLY thing you do is spew conjecture? You never actually support anything you say at all. If you don't give the details as to why you're correct then you aren't correct. Anyone can make baseless claims and present them as facts. It takes knowledge to actually prove them as facts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> caring about quality <br> on /a/ <br>Pic related.</br></br></br>  What are they saying /a/?  <br>moshi moshi? hajime's hajimes? nani?</br>  Hopes and Dreams.

He thinks he's important, but in the long run he's most likely just a minor villain.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Well Gel absorbed what "people wanted" and everyone was against VAPE and wishing to save Rui.</br></br></br>  "It's not me who will kill you but your ideals."<br><br>Is rytmth mentally challenged? He's the one stabbing the note.</br></br>  The lack of Utsutsu this season is FUCKING TERRIBLE<br><br>Instant worst show of the season</br></br>  <br>He was just trying to be DEEP about it. Stop bullying Rizumin.</br>  <br>I think he sees himself as just the reaction to the actions of the other characters.<br><br>Rui handing over his note led to his potential death, really it could have been anyone stabbing the note. <br><br>It's still fucking retarded though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's wrong. Everyone wanted him to get the fuck out in the reaction live, Gel-kun got it.</br>  <br>Are you saying she should be lacking more? well, there's no much to talk about her if it weren't for the obvious unknown information like her real name, her roots and such but no one in gatchaman has a full backstory yet</br>  Gelsadra is going to be the one who kills Rizumu because of Public Opinion.

Did it get a English dub remux in addition   Jim deserved to tap that  <br>Yes. Download the [EG] release on Nyaa.</br>  <br>You are a piece of shit character in what was otherwise a good series, and you have no worth.</br>  <br>I didn't think you could try that hard and be that wrong.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Aisha was best girl by far.<br>Also this: </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in what was otherwise a good series </br>  <br> 79GBs </br>  <br> not having 20TB of storage for your chinese cartoons <br>You're waifu would be so disappoint.</br></br>    <br> Does One Piece have brown catgirls? <br>Given the variety of Zoan Devil Fruits it's almost a guarantee that they have them in triplicate.</br></br>  <br>I admit I'm shit at managing storage. I only have like 5GBs to work with. And I have shitty 3rd world tier internet bandwith.</br>  <br> 5GB <br>Jesus fuck. I have more than three times that much RAM.<br>The last time I had a computer with that little storage space was before fucking Y2K.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 5GBs <br><br>Fuck, I meant 5TB. Holy shit I'm retarded. Good thing I used Cirno.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That should still leave you plenty of room to hold a measly 79gigs of top quality encoding.<br>It's just a torrent, so even if you have shit speed, just let the torrent client run while you're out at work or school or sleeping and not using the bandwidth for anything else.</br></br>  <br>Shit, meant to quote </br>  <br>That's true. I don't mind the length of time it takes me to download stuff. I just have to work around the mysterious bandwith limit my ISP provides. They don't tell me what it is, but when I go past it then my internet speed gets throttled so bad I can't even use /a/ properly. I really need to move.<br><br>Anyway that's enough blogging for me. I'll start downloading at the end of the month so even if I do go past the limit, it won't last long.</br></br></br>  <br>and to think i just finish downloading the normal version few weeks ago. so whats in the BD aside from better quality animation?</br>  <br>HUGELY improved video quality. Here's what the old DVDs look like.</br>  <br>And this is what the BD looks like.</br>  <br>Guess I have to download this now</br>  <br>Check out all that upscale artifacting, not to mention the overly bright filter. Original DVDs are objectively the better option.</br>  Waiting for Japanese release (tomorrow) and get proper scans or at least decent ones.
