Adjective, I meant adjective.</br></br>  <br>Really? might try this.</br>  So if Yuki is the only one who lives in a delusion, why did Mii-kun go around announcing they'd come to fetch their dog in a classroom that should be empty? Was it just to appease her?  <br>Watch Ushio and Tora,You'll thank me later.</br>  <br>I remember that, wasn't much we didn't already know though.<br>It was interesting to see why the girls were on the roof at the time though.</br></br>  <br>Miikun need more gold in her hair.</br>  <br>To uphold the delusion. Everyone is.</br>  <br>whoa how did I miss that?</br>  <br> Didn't you notice how she opened doors and shouted into classrooms with no care? It wasn't until Yuki told her they were "in class" that she quieted down and apologized. </br>  <br>Yes.<br>It's also why Miki barges into their classes and yuki has to tell her "MIKI WE'RE IN CLASS WHAT THE FUCK CLOSE THE DOOR"<br><br> mfw I thought they were just autistic <br> mfw I read the entire manga afterwards <br><br>Anime-only friends are in for a trip</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So the four of them are the only ones who aren't zombies?  <br>Think of it as Haruhi :  even more  Delusional edition.<br> They need to entertain her so she doesn't realize what's happening and go berserk. </br></br>  <br>You didn't notice her giving 0 shits in the first two classrooms until CatHat told her?<br><br> &gt;teacher had no presence </br></br></br>  We were right<br>These threads went to shit real quick</br>  <br>So fare we've seen 5 other people who are still alive.

I forgot how much I like the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>They certainly got a lot more fast paced, other than that nothing much has changed.<br><br><br>They're changing it up in the anime for a more original approach.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;teacher had no presence <br> I liked the scene with teacher blinking when switching POV </br></br>    <br>  </br>   draw a boy <br> call is a girl </br>  <br>I was wondering why as well.

I always thought she  died during the restroom trip.   <br>^(Patented double spoiler protection!)<br> The anime had me suspicious since everyone bar CatHat seemed to ignore her. Something I never noticed before. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga<br><br>no, it's moeshit but truthfully it's one of those good psychological survival manga whereas characters are literally going batshit insane after being showered with horrible reality...<br><br> one of the main character just snapped in the latest chapters </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too "epic" for my tastes.</br>  <br>I've read and typed the word "shovel" so many times in these last two or three threads that the word effectively is gibberish to me now.<br><br>Shovel.

I'm disappointed.</br>  <br>They get them from the school store.<br><br> They also go to a shopping mall later on, where they find Mii-kun in the manga. </br></br></br>  <br>S-sorry.<br><br><br>They grow vegetable on the roof and collect stuff from the small canteen on the first floor.<br><br>Other than that i have no idea how they get their food.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Avatarfagging is against the rules.  <br>fucking lewd</br>  <br>Kurumi makes runs to the school store.<br>Kurumi stronk. They all go together on one trip because Yuki wants to do a "test of bravery"<br><br><br> Yes.

I should read the manga before watching the anime huh?  <br>forgot your pic</br>  <br>TIME TO BUY SHOVEL</br>  <br>Now that you've seen the episode, read the manga before episode 2.</br>  <br>Seems that reporting is not enough to ban that guy.</br>  My secondary friend was wowed by the episode and didn't even notice all of the subtle things, like this scene right before the eyecatch.<br><br>Actually, I haven't seen more people comment on this scene. It's a shame, really. It's nice and subtle and serves as establishing  "that" scene where the sun ALSO shone and forced Yuki to face reality, which will happen in episode 12. </br></br>  <br><br>you people are pretty much no fun allowed, why are you even here if you hate  fun? </br></br>  <br> Stephen King <br>So this is worst girl, right?</br></br>  <br> Actually, I haven't seen more people comment on this scene <br><br>I did yesterday https://archive.moe/a/thread/127826<wbr>609/#127830654</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>What does this shot reveal? I don't see shit.</br>  <br> Avatarfagging <br>They're reaction images anon.<br>What ever are you on about?</br></br></br>  <br>Avatarfaggin is against the rules, that has nothing to do with fun. <br>Protip: use a tripcode</br></br>  <br>The windows are broken.</br>  <br> I haven't seen more people comment on this scene <br>Were you not in the past two/three threads?<br>Everyone noticed that bit, there isn't anything interesting about that broken window.<br><br><br>The Stand is one of his better books honestly.<br>If you're going to read from a shit author, you'd better read the best he has. Plus it's post-apocalyptic so it fits.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Broken glass</br>  <br><br>Oh, borken windows.</br></br>  So, this is it, huh? This is going to be the joke that sticks with this franchise? Like with Akarin being invisible or Goku being a terrible father?<br><br>Well, at least I'm here to see the making of it.</br></br>  <br>It symbolize emotional state of the girls; broken beyond repair.</br>  <br>It's the subtle setup, noname.<br><br>I wish I could filter you.<br>I really do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello to you too.<br>Been awhile since we've crossed paths outside of a Berserk thread.</br></br>  Everything's fine !  <br> Actually she faces reality for real at that point. Anything past that is just her keeping up the act to keep morale up. </br>  <br> tripcode <br>Do you seriously want me to become one of those annoying tripfags that are ALWAYS in a series threads?</br></br>  <br>He's posting them for us to save. I don't see the problem here.<br><br><br>I noticed it but I wasn't in any threads yesterday.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be easier to filter.</br>  <br>Shovel keeps good care of her shovels.</br>  <br>You're already that annoying, anon.</br>  <br>I don't think glass can broke in any other way than beyond repair.</br>  <br>For a series like this anime is the only way to go, it's pretty obvious where this series is going so spoilers are no big deal.</br>  <br>calm down anon. your new is showing</br>  <br>I thought that was the one hint/scene that wasn't subtle at all. I don't think that's a bad thing, though. Having something you can't miss that makes you go "something's not right here" makes it easier to pick up on some later hints. Maybe. It's really hard to evaluate all this when you know exactly what's going on beforehand.</br>     <br> All is in the darkness in the past. <br> Please don't throw me away. <br> Help me. <br/></br></br></br>   <br>Tape can't fix everything sometimes.</br>  <br>DIEJOBU</br>  <br>Watching the anime without knowing what to expect would probably be fun, but to achieve that you'd have to drop out of /a/'s threads until it's done airing, because it's just not feasible to expect the manga's readers to spoiler half their discussion.<br>With those considerations I went ahead and read it after watching ep1, and don't regret it.</br></br>  <br>Nothing is diejoubu, nothing.<br><br><br>Clearly you don't use duct tape often enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Siscon</br>  <br>The anime will be completely different than the manga, just watch it and read the manga after it's done.</br>  <br>Tape can't fix Yuki.</br>  <br> H-manga <br> Not SICP </br></br>  <br>But anon,  Yuki has been fixed since Chapter 29. </br>  Wait, so the short haired boy is an anime original character?  <br>Well shit.</br>  <br>Clearly you weren't in the airing thread.</br>  <br>It's called /a/ not /ma/</br>  <br>If you can't fix Yuki with tape, you're not using tape correctly.</br>  <br>No, she is a girl that appears later.</br>  <br>Cathat is crazy cute</br>  Isn't this basically the Madoka of zombie anime?  <br>Oh, okay.</br>  <br>She's "crazy" cute alright.</br>  <br>And how do you propose to fix Yuki with tape?</br>  <br>So we need WD40?</br>  <br>Boobs is insanely sexy.</br>  <br> the Madoka of zombie anime <br> not the Madoka of SoL <br>You had one thing to do autist</br></br></br>  I hope the dog doesn't die ;_;  <br>What did lerche do to fix their studio?

Her days are numbered. </br>  <br> I hope vaccines become their primary ressource and they start running around trying to keep her almost alive </br>  <br><br>Is it too much to hope for  Kurumi to be special and the vaccine putting her in a halfway state permanently? </br></br>   school store equipped with products and food for the daily life  <br><br>Is this really a thing in japan?</br></br>  <br>It'll be the usual trick of trying to get the audience attached to a character that doesn't matter so they don't have to kill of one that does.</br>  <br>It was a thing in my high school too.</br>  <br>(´・ω・`)</br>  Why did Yuki have to  continue the cycle of enabling mental illnesses?<br>Megu-nee realized she fucked up, but then refused to do anything about it.<br>Yuki realized she fucked up by encouraging Yuuri and helping her flesh out Ruu-chan, but just keeps letting her get away with it.</br></br>   <br>It's going to be like the helicopter pilot.<br>She's still be able to do things but she'll start to twitch involuntarily to the point where she will be a detriment to the group.<br>The intervals will progressively become smaller and smaller with repeated use until they become hourly as it likely was for the helicopter pilot.<br><br><br> No, the school was prepared beforehand in case of a zombie apocalypse.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just don't want Shovel-chan to suffer.</br>     implying anyone is going to die. <br><br>Look! They're all alive. Even Taroumaru!</br></br>  <br> implying there will not be any plot armor for shovel. </br>  <br> What significance does the helicopter pilot and his syringe have with this?<br>I'd guess he shows that you need the medicine with increasing frequency until it becomes impossible to maintain?</br> </br>  Talk about heart wrenching. Yuki is such a lovable retard  <br>Looks like Rii's sister is alive and well in that picture too!</br>  <br>Wait, then why is everybody else in the school dead? Did the teachers forget to read the instructions?</br>  <br>She won't die anon, trust me.<br>She's a big girl!   ;_;  </br></br>  <br>She is only pretending.</br>  <br> Did the teachers forget to read the instructions? <br> Yes. </br></br>  I just caught up to the latest chapter.  Ri-chan's sister a cute.   <br>I Am Legend reference?</br>  <br>Man, is there even any point in living once you reach the hourly dose?<br>I mean, you couldn't even get a full night's sleep. Might as well end yourself after getting infected.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, teddy bears really are adorable.</br>  <br>For you?</br>  <br>Yeah. Ruu's pretty cute, isn't she? Shy, but she eats like a bear. That contrast is adorable!</br>  I just marathon'd the manga, fuck this gay earth.  <br> Implying she won't cut her arm off when the time comes. </br>  <br>The weekly wait is gonna be torture.</br>  <br>Of course!<br>  I knew this was coming  </br></br>  <br>Probably way too late for that.</br>  <br>You'd think that a school would actually be one of the easier places to survive in, with the whole "Lockdown" thing they can do. I mean, if all of the doors are locked, can Zombies bust them open? <br><br>Then again, this is a school, with Teenagers in it, so Mass Panic was probably a thing.</br></br></br>  <br> You're kidding right? That's a joke. </br>  <br>Have a colored version.</br>  <br>Her scars were cute. I wish she had kept them.</br>  <br>Her skin going back to normal is promising. She even lost the face bandage.</br>  <br> Yuki was so quick to play along for a reason. She saw the bear and put two and two together instantly. </br>  <br>Don't think about it. Just accept everything and it will be okay.</br>  <br>damn love this meme</br>  <br> I'm sorry, anon. </br>  <br><br>Not him, but I don't know whether avoiding being a filthy secondary/being able to participate in the thread discussion will be worth spoiling what happens in the series.<br><br>I mean, I knew there were zombies involved, and I could tell that something had already gone wrong, but the end scene still hit like a truck. I don't know if the manga will have the same impact.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That won't work. Bacteria doesn't work that way at all. Once it's in you, you're fucked. The only cure is a fast-moving lead or iron projectile through the brain.</br>  <br>Wait, it's weekly? The scans are posted in batches from what I saw.</br>  <br>He means the episode.</br>  <br>We had a little "store" too, but just with a few shelves for sweets, buns or some toiletries. Not a whole fucking supermarket.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's monthly and the scanlator does volumes, not magazine scans.</br>  <br><br><br>God damn fuck this shit, man.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't even read spoilers for future chapters or anything I just thought it was obvious.</br>  <br>I was talking about the anime adaption. I can't wait to hear the actresses get their suffering on.</br>  <br>I think the reveal in the manga is pretty good.</br>  <br>Welp, guess I'm thick then. I need to pay more attention from now on.</br>  <br>I thought it was handled better in the anime. More buildup and better tension.</br>  <br>Its okay anon, all you have to do is pretend nothing is wrong. they're all just high school students happily studying their day away.<br>Just with lots of zombies as classmates.</br></br>  Which scanlation should I go with for the manga and where can I find it? Also how many chapters are there so far?  <br>The teachers were told to not read the files until shit has hit the fan. too bad it is too late by then.</br>  <br>yeah no</br>    <br> Don't read this file on how to save yourself from this highly lethal, infectious disease until it's already been released! <br>That's dumb on soooo many levels.</br></br>  <br> I think she always knew on some level that everything she was seeing was a delusion, that living in that delusion helped keep her friends sane. IIRC, when they first went to the mall and rescued Mii-kun, Yuki seemed to react like she knew those were zombies. She may not have consciously acknowledged it though until that point though. </br>  <br>WHY THE FUCK IS EVERY SINGLE WINDOW BROKEN</br>  <br>Unfortunately, I want to see Shovel suffer.<br>I want to see her suffer horribly.<br>I want to watch her try and save her friends and stumble constantly as she loses energy, needing a new shot before feeling energetic.<br>I want to see the gang desperate as they use their last dosage on Shovel.<br>I want to see Shovel on her deathbed, gargling zombie sounds before dying as Mii-kun uses Shovel's own shovel to kill her.<br><br><br> plot armor <br> after being bitten by a zombie <br> after acknowledging that the serium doesn't cure but only slows down the process <br>Why do you think the helicopter pilot had three sedatives in his backpack for a single trip. The trip should have lasted less than a hour at most yet he brought that many.<br><br><br> cut off her arm <br>Hahahaha. As if that'll help now. They should have cut it off the moment she was bitten.<br>Though it would be hilarious if they cut off her arms using the shovel.<br><br>Then Shovel would swing around that shovel with her teeth.<br><br><br>I know there's a zombie movie or game (can't remember) and they chop the arm the moment that person is bitten. I really wish I could remember where it's from.<br>In the Walking Dead Game, it doesn't work because the black guy was bitten for a decent amount of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Initial panic.<br>Or maybe there was a zombie who REALLY hated windows.</br></br>  <br>Because apparently, Zombies hate glass, and sand-derivatives. <br> No, it's a good question. The windows on the top as well. Why? </br></br>  <br>35 chapters have been english translated.</br>  <br> which scanlation <br>Manga isn't as lucky as anime anon, you're pretty much stuck with only 1 scanlation. <br>The usual 2 sites for manga are okay, and the download site option has it too.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone needs to break the illussion of the pink girl, at this rate they will die if she fucks up.</br>  <br>There probably were some students who tried to kill zombies by throwing things at them through the higher windows.</br>  <br>In the post-apocalypse, everything is broken.<br><br>I mean, really if the windows weren't broken, all there would be is chairs and desks on the floor with a bit of blood.<br>Broken windows give a direct impression EVERYTHING is fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like that the zombies go back to the place they were happiest and shit.</br>  <br>They are alive because she exists.</br>  <br><br> Let me believe everything will be daijobu, Anons.  ;-;  </br></br>  <br>They couldn't have just opened the windows instead of breaking them?</br>  <br>Which sites are best for non-bullshit manga reading?</br>  <br> Did you really think they would evacuate the corpses by dragging them trough the stairs ? They just throw them through the windows. </br>  <br> She also knew something was wrong when she went out to look for Kurumi and Mii-kun. She was ready to bash some heads in. <br><br> That said, Chapter 29 is when she really started facing reality. She became competent and she stopped being as active with her delusions after that. </br></br></br>  <br>No, everything will be fire and death.<br>You must suffer alongside the girls.</br></br>  <br>go back to reddit</br>  <br> it's better that way though... apparently one of the girls is on the verge of snapping and she literally pampers yuki and her delusion to stay mentally healthy <br> her brain problems actually made her an effective morale booster for the club in early chapters </br></br>  <br> Also, I love how she drops her hat whenever she gets serious. It's a nice touch. <br><br> She's pretty damn beautiful without the hat too. </br></br></br>  <br>No, I meant the windows on the top. WHy are THOSE broken?<br><br>I mean, I'd throw the bodies out of the window too, but probably try to restrict my window-breaking.</br></br></br>  <br> The trip should have lasted less than a hour at most yet he brought that many. <br>For reserve? Since its your life saving tool you don't want it to have one shot only ?</br></br>   watch Vivid's release <br> OP and ED lyrics </br>  <br>You are a terrible person bern.<br>A very bad person. My Shovel will be fine and we all know she will! She'll kill the virus with sheer awesomeness.</br></br>  <br> But she IS a bit on the slow side, that part isn't an act. </br>  <br>but that wouldn't be fun would it?</br>  <br><br>In the Walking Dead comic they save a guy by cutting off his leg. Well, in that verse every single human is infected and they turn when they die, zombie bite got some kind of super bacteria that makes your wound fester and kill you in a matter of days.</br></br>  <br>THERE'S NO TIME!</br>  <br>full of memes i believe</br>  <br>Summer is harsh in Japan, they needed some fresh air.</br>  <br> Why do you think the helicopter pilot had three sedatives in his backpack for a single trip. <br>Three girls, as far as he knew.</br></br>  <br>What did they do about the double meanings?</br>  <br>That doesn't explain it being every single window.<br><br>Maybe the concussion of an explosion?</br></br></br>  <br>They've had consistent plot armor for over thirty chapters now of just-barely-averted disaster. I don't see how pointing out that they're in a situation where it would be necessary makes it LESS likely.</br>  <br>B-But the bottom windows were already broken!<br> Don't you lie to me, Anon </br></br>  <br>people struggling against the zombies and making sure not to back up against an already broken window so they don't get stabbed on the shards, maybe?<br>Fuckin' who knows, man</br></br>  <br><br>Alright. By the usual sites you mean Batoto and Mangahere, right?</br></br>  <br> They didn't want to see the dog's corpse ever again so they stuffed him with explosives and threw him out the window </br>  <br>well, she's  dead, Jim. We know it </br>  <br>If you are going to break windows, may as well break all of them.</br>  <br> I like the part where she shouted 'She's in danger!' or something along that line before everyone rescued Mii-kun. She also ignored her friend when they thought the voice she heard was another of her delusion and went straight for Mii-kun.<br><br>I think she kinda realized about the apocalypse but really in hard denial about Megu-nee, that's why she sometimes act like zombies actually roaming about but always deluding herself about Megu-nee until later chapters.</br></br> </br>    <br>By that logic, if Shovel is turning into a zombie, everyone should!</br>  A reminder that Lala has already won.  <br> implying Ms. smith is not the endgame </br>  I was surprised the anime didn't suck.<br>I expected it to but hoped it wouldn't. <br>I knew GATE and Overlord were going to suck and they did. <br>Now all I got to brood on is One Punch Man. <br><br>How long into the series will the anime get before S2 never?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> endgame <br><br>Lala is just chillin' at the afterlife while the others fight for kurusu kimihito, the best girl of all.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to protect that smile.</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is best Girl.   Reminder that Miia already won and is used goods.  <br> Blue skin <br><br>WHY<br><br>That will make people believe that she's part of a subrace of Demons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lala wins when and after darling's dead.</br></br>   AN A KE   <br>Time for an exorcist.<br><br><br>But Darling is too small to fit in her.<br><br><br>Hold your breath for a long time then die and look at your skin.<br>NIGGA ITS BLUE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When renovating the house, did they just tell the contractors "just build it like an American expat will be living here."?  <br> American expat <br>If the said American expat's from say virgin island and weighs about 400lb, then sure.</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE RACHNEE  <br><br>Maybe they told them to build it for Texan/American Samoan.</br></br>  <br> When renovating the house, did they just tell the contractors "just build it like an American expat will be living here."? <br>Realistically you can just say "build it for a disabled person who had to use a wheelchair everywhere".<br><br>Granted, in real life Japan has really bad disabled access in buildings. So if you need to use a wheelchair your life would be hell. And this explains why the larger monstergirls have problem going to places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a cripple is literally worse than death in Japan, they might as well kill themselves</br>  <br>Japan cannot unto accessibility. <br>Nope, can't have common sense ruin shits and giggles. Large and deep pool is a-ok, but reinforced roofs with proper escalator? Forget about it.</br></br>  Suu?<br>Suu</br>  <br>How fucking cute is she?</br>  <br>It was pretty ok. The animation was distracting because of how static it was. I found that little video game styled bit quiet charming, I'd like to see more of it.</br>  <br>They don't want smelly cripples stinking up their country, so they force them to flee by making everything require stairs.</br>  <br><br>Best girls</br></br>  <br>Rachnee is ultimately responsible for the house collapsing, due to dragging Honey to her rape attic without first disabling everyone else.</br>  <br>This round about deflection of blame from horse pussy</br>  How would Rachnera act during the full moon? She's already the most unambiguous rapist member  Snakes are the cutest.  <br>She'd turn her legs into penises.</br>  <br>Whose fault is it that all the girls in the house went to the attic to protect his virginity?</br>  Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling?<br><br>It's so easy.</br></br>  <br>Because no one will save her from Suu.</br>  <br>not with that pig voice</br>  <br>That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck.</br>  P O L T<br>O<br>L<br>T</br></br></br>  <br>Chuuni ass-fuck doujin when?</br>  <br> Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling? <br>Unlike the other girls, it seems she needs to be in the mood to feel like it. So she doesn't really plan to rape Darling unless the situation presents itself. And in general we know she can't actually fight off ALL the girls in the house.<br><br> Because no one will save her from Suu. <br>Especially Suu, who is essentially her nemesis. Suu is not affected by silk.<br><br><br> That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck. <br>The Lala bio is written by a sceptic who assumes that magic doesn't exist. Note the section that talked about unexplained connections between Dullahan sightings and deaths.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Scene cracks me up every time.</br>  <br>Lala already told darling that she'll be there for him once he's dead for good.</br>  Do you think the VAs are thinking about how weird this shit is to them?    <br>She doesn't have to fight them.<br><br>She simply has to tie them up in her web</br></br></br>  <br>Dat body</br>  <br> that Smith <br>unf</br></br>  <br> She simply has to tie them up in her web <br>Tie up Suu? With spider silk? She is good, but she isn't THAT good.</br></br>  <br>This is the result of that.</br>  <br>Slime best girl.<br>Imagine her covering your dick and churning her slime.</br></br>  <br>Waitafuckingsecond. The anime's airing?<br><br>Fuck, where did the time go!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think  means this, but still the same thing in the end. Everyone else are the only things standing between her and Goo victory.</br></br>  <br>That's like saying Bond was responsible for the firing of Goldeneye because he didn't go back to make sure Alec was dead.</br>  <br>That is why she is not in the anime.</br>  <br>He is. He's a government-sponsored assassin. Failure to kill=poor job performance.</br>  <br>This confuses me to no end. Episode one covered the first two chapters of the manga. However, at that pace, the anime would go straight through to Lala's introduction, yet she doesn't appear in the opening theme. Plus, minor characters like Port and Kii don't show up in any of the themes either, so I have no idea what to think.</br>  <br>They'll be there. Lala's not showing up until the second half of the season at any rate.</br>  <br>Because the entire D arc is a huge spoiler if you're anime-only.</br>  Can somebody explain what are the D's all snakes wear on their heads? <br> inb4 hur durr D worship </br>  <br>I think it's just supposed to be cute hairclips, part of their  D sign.</br>  <br>They're hair clips that resemble snake eyes I think</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he can protect it himself, faggot</br>  <br>It makes them look like snake eyes anon.</br>    Okiku-Mushi when  <br> protect it himself <br>You clearly don't love this decent, earnest and long-suffering fellow.

Bieng the uterus in the horse half would be much more reasonable. <br>It would be imposible for a centaur child to go through such a slim waist as Cereas</br></br>  If only everyone didn't have disgusting cow tits in this series.  <br>Miia is acceptable in this regard, making her top pick once again.</br>  <br>That's why we have best girl!</br>  <br>People like this</br>  <br>Cerea's Dominant Dandy Darling is way better than Miia's Puckish Punk.</br>  <br>This manga got me into giant tits.

Did I try to fuck her several times before them, even though I knew perfectly well that was rape and forbidden under some very specific circumstances? And was she really my girlfriend and not some nice stranger I'd met just a few days ago and was just spending some time in her house to visit a different country?</br>  <br>At the moment I'm around 62 kg (136 pounds), which is actually under the ideal weight for my 185-ishcm body (around 6' 1")</br>  <br>No it isn't<br><br>Manako is best girl</br></br></br>  <br>Apart from the question of how Cerea would wear a loincloth, that's actually kinda hot. And the fact that it's kinda hot confuses me because sumo wrestling isn't sexy.</br>  <br>It's different when the genders are reversed, because for most life-forms, each female can only hold one male's offspring at a time.</br>  <br>Drink a butter sandwich smoothie, spooky Skeleton-chan!</br>  <br>Jesus, eat a fucking burger <br>how are you not dead yet?<br>weighing 62 kg while being 185 is inhuman</br></br></br>  <br>Crybaby</br>  <br>fug off JT</br>  <br>Ok, i laughed.</br>    have boobs <br>  have pretty eye <br>  beautiful face <br>  have nice booty <br>  perfect body and skin <br><br>Manako is the best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> literally no argument: the post <br><br> And that's objectively false, with "objectively" being used correctly <br>Yeah, remember when Papi was crazy jealous and went on a hissing fit every time a new girl joined his harem?

Tsubasa and Maria were standing on a beach after escaping Phara and then a submarine landed and lots of robot girls and different scientists voiced by the same person came out of it. Also there were Noise but they were friendly and disintegrated themselves before hitting humans.</br>  <br> they were friendly and disintegrated themselves before hitting humans <br>Being noise is suffering</br></br>  <br>Noise-chan ;_;</br>  <br>i can't wait for the aufwachen form.

The change this Elfnein is "key" <br> For radiant force the girls recorded in front of mic together, not separately <br> The "charity rock festival" was in remembrance and in honor of those that died (presumably during the frontier incident) <br> Agematsu envisioned the concert and chose the phrase "stardust" because he wanted the stars and heavens to reflect in the stage's water <br> The live scene featuring a sunset was an homage to the concert from season 1 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fighting as they have up until now the gear users will not be able to stand up to the auto-scorers. The change this Elfnein is "key" <br><br> The elemental dolls are dancers that dance to symphogeah users' songs, matching they rhythm and attack pattrent while dancing.  </br></br></br>  <br> Agematsu said that "songs" don't belong to "justice" rather they are simple something that is "pure." <br> This means they can be used to create "pure justice" or "pure evil." This comment came from question about the "song to destroy the world." <br> "Say you heard a song right after you've had your heart broken. Then you never want to hear it again for the rest of your life, right?" <br> The last thing he says is GX might end up being a story that answers the question "what exactly is a song?" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Either that or they fight in a manner to deliberately fuck up the rhtythm of the songs</br>  <br><br> For the dolls to not be able to predict the songs they deliberately have to mess up their own songs <br>Berserker song time</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animate.co.jp/special/ch<wbr>araby_tv/pc/charabyebook/_SWF_Windo<wbr>w.html<br>Who is going to rip it?</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> &gt;The last thing he says is GX might end up being a story that answers the question "what exactly is a song?" <br>Man, I might reflect on my life hard that I might enter a church and pray when GX ends.</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, it's only p34.</br>  <br>It's not Exterminate.

And Miku was also 16 years old in G's finale according to official site data, which means G's story started From September 14th(or more later) and ended after November 7th. If Chris was younger than Hibiki, it will be a little strange that Chris was already 16 years old in G's finale( official data) unless G's finale happened after December 28th. But since in season 3 she is the oldest senpai in Lydian, there is a little chance that Chris is younger than Hibiki.</br>      <br> Shirabe's back </br>  <br> Kaneko said Hibiki was already 16 years old in G's prologue. <br>Hibiki was what in S1? 14?</br></br>  The concert was shit.<br><br>SHIT.</br></br>  <br>Damn, dat senpai.<br>Thank you based anon.<br><br>15, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>15<br>Also Hibiki and Miku are 2nd years in Lydian now. Chris is 3rd and DMJii are 1st.</br></br>  Less than 11 hours now.  <br>Gotta say, I really appreciate how the gears have become increasingly more mechanical looking every season while still remaining slick, stylish and sexy.</br>  <br> Shirabe will never call me senpai </br>  <br>NO PREVIEWS</br>  <br>Incorrect. Hibiki and Mika are 13, Chris is 19 and DMJii are 8. How they managed to all infiltrate the same school is far beyond me.</br>  <br>inb4 to keep suspension high they've decided to stop releasing previews and letting the viewers die in speculah</br>    <br>Mechgical Girl Armor is best power armor</br>  <br><br>I'm not asking for a kiss or anything, just some cute or meaningful interaction between these two. Their whole duel in G was fantastic and really cemented the bond between them, this season needs to expand on that sometime.</br></br>  <br> we will never see Tsubasa in uniform again. </br>  <br>I just want more of Chris being flustered, I don't care who she does it with.</br>  <br>I felt that was more just Chris getting character development rather than them being gay for each other.</br>  I want to see something happen that makes the FIS girls start calling Genjuuro  Papa <br><br>So they can have a Mammu and a Daddu<br><br> And they can all become batmen Geahs when Genjuuro inevitably dies </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I cherished the moment she still wore her uniform.<br>I never really thought they'll make her graduate from Lydian.</br></br>  <br>I am sorry friend.

Might be cool especially if she welcomes the geahs back after a mission (with a focus on taking care of Shirabe/Kirika like a mother welcoming the kids back from school).</br>  <br> legs <br> breasts <br> eyes <br> hairstyle <br> color combination of eyes and hair <br> face <br> smile <br> body height <br><br>Maria is perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to bully Minamean.</br>  <br>Yeah, for breeding.</br>  <br>Where did they said Tsubasa graduates from Lydian? I guess I missed it.</br>  Will best doll make an appearance yet?  <br><br>Ver please.</br></br>  <br> Athleticism <br> Genki <br> thighs <br> breasts <br> butt <br> eye/hair color <br> citrus-y <br> smile <br> height <br>   appetite <br><br>Hey what d'ya know, Hibiki's perfect too!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They'll probably finish up Tsubasa vs Green, Hibiki vs Carol and Chris vs Yellow so that's already a lot. Maybe the 2 remaining dolls will jump into one of the fights to outnumber the enemy or attack Shirabe/Kirika.</br>  <br>She also strikes me as the most... human of the characters? Like, at the risk of sounding like a flaming retard, the main three girls have victory literally written for them. Maria doesn't have plot armor for her success and seeing her try so hard and then FAIL and just... break down and start crying. It felt a lot more real to me than "Heroes save the day." I don't know if I'm just cynical or what, but her efforts alone simply being inadequate and being unable to rationalize that with her own mentality felt so much more like reality than Hibiki's "Surpass the impossible and kick reason to the curb" outlook on life that lets her be Bikki.<br><br>I had this more coherently in my head, I swear.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Lines indicating the shirt is falling loosely from her chest <br> Lines outlining her breasts <br><br>So is that shirt tight or loose?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Sword more than Maria.</br>    <br>It's  seethrough </br>  <br> most human <br> they are all cyborgu <br>get out of this thread human scum</br></br></br>  <br>custodians pls</br>  <br> Cute breasts <br> Beautiful green eyes <br> Cute tomboyish hairtstyle <br> Genki <br> Nice fashion sense <br><br><br>I think Kirika is fine, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's  seethrough , anon.</br>  I think we all need something to help pass the time for next episode. Draw your own noise.   In both S1 and S2 when the girls enter X-Drive mode they gain telepathy <br>What chance is there that the "unified language" that the Moon is blocking out is telepathy, and by entering X-Drive the girls are exceeding the control of the moon and gaining temporary access to the unified language?</br>  <br> that <br> nice fashion sense <br><br>Kirika please get off the computer, trying to boost your ego on an anonymous image board is pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still wonder what the fuck went over Nana's head that she drew a fucking Samurai when they are told to draw a fucking noise.</br>  <br><br>I know what you mean, and I'd like to concur.<br><br>However if you remember S1 Hibiki wasn't always that bright and radiant. She was trying to befriend Tsubasa like a puppy begging for attention. She had a hard time dealing with her dark side that got amplified by the shards in her body. In the end Fine had almost crushed her will to fight.<br><br>Tsubasa was rather edgy because muh Kanade in the beginning and almost killed herself. S1 showed her as a weak human who is unable to even keep her own room in order.<br><br>Chris is more of a Mary Sue actually. Given that she has the shittiest background story of them all it's weird how much power she has and how easy she just switches over to the good guys. A real human being in her situation would probably suffer horrible flashbacks, need long time counseling and maybe even medication.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I'm not the only one that thought that</br>  <br> songs unite people </br>  <br> songs unite people <br>Reminds of a certain story of a Nanafag who successfully married the girl he loves because of Nana's lives. <br>Songs can be miraculous things sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Yuuki-senpai likes it</br>  <br>NANA WILLS IT</br>  why is Tsubasa so kakoii?  <br>Because Swords are inevitably cool.</br>  <br>We were only given a very narrow view of her relationship with Fine. For all the shit she did to Chris, Fine needed her functional and loyal; she would have had to support her somehow.</br>  <br>Well, I can understand your feelings about the "characters having victory written all over them" since that's the aura the main trio give off lately and Maria really doesn't have that.<br><br>It's like every happy moment she has is tied with a sad moment that lingers afterwards so she has to suffer the effects and can't just brush it off. Mom dies as she finally gets to sing a song that connected the world. Sister's relic gets broken after the fight she finally learns to hold hands. Gets to sing again as an idol but has limited freedom since it was only part of a deal so that Kirika and Shirabe are free. Got to take part in saving the world but is considered a tainted hero. Finally has friends but is forced to helplessly watch them fight to defend her when that's her biggest trauma (Serena died protecting her).<br><br>It's normal when she was still a "confused villain" that has yet to be converted but she kept suffering for her efforts even afterwards and from the looks of it, will continue. It's good to have variety after the main trio got over their problems though so that's a good thing. Punching through impossible situations and suffering for your efforts make it more interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No   tentacles <br>Shit</br></br>  <br>I wish Maria would use a broad sword instead.</br>  Target captured.  <br>I want Tsubasa to hug me from behind.</br>  <br> deadfish </br>   Geah Miku will never be a thing again   <br>I call it a  Kanade  noise.</br>  <br> Instead of Hibiki taking Maria's gear it's Miku this time </br>  <br>Why did these parts of the archive never got scanned?</br>  <br> a design this arousing <br> not appearing again <br>satelite pls</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't in there. The archive was only part of every bit of settings material, and a lot went on auction. I scanned the whole book, anything else you see is most likely from auctions.</br>  <br> You will never turn a defensive geah into a dommsday device because your feelings for a girl is so strong. </br>  <br>Oh, I see.<br>That's a shame, those parts are the parts I really wanted to see, especially Tsubasa's because her concept art is always better than the animated.</br></br>  <br>To be fair no one really draw a noise except Ayahi. Then she actually regret it.</br>  <br>The staff and cast is literally full of people with fucked up minds.<br>Maybe she is one of the few decent people there.</br></br>  <br>That's so in-character</br>  <br>How is there no 'why is everyone so gay' image of Chris yet?</br>  <br> old hag <br> used goods <br> western whore <br> murderer <br> stupid hair ears <br> useless <br><br>No thank you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The perfect wallpaper</br>  <br>looks like a beetle</br>  <br> used goods <br>She's pure</br></br>   commie are doing Aquarion <br>Thank you in advance, based H&amp;D.</br>  <br>It's a shirt and a vest</br>  <br>That one would be really dangerous though, no bigger than a bee and touching it would be instant death</br>  <br>As if she didn't have to whore herself out to Ver to get him to treat Mamu.</br>  <br>Maria is the purest girl in the main cast.</br>  <br><br> grew up amongst Euro degeneracy <br> impregnated by Ver </br></br></br>  <br>Ver is gay anyway, he reacted disgusted and scared when Chris attacked him naked.</br>   <br>You forgot to post the Beyond All Tiers Tier which is understandable because there's only one entry<br><br> Chris's Smile </br></br></br>  <br>But Bikki's butt outranks everything else no matter what.<br><br>The butt is life. Praise the butt.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Add her fluffytsun to the list.</br></br>  <br>Chris' Smile is a miracle. So is Bikkis.<br>But Tsubasa's smile is such a rare miracle that it should be a national treasure.</br></br>  I want to FUCK Grape-kun.   no previews <br>See you later.</br>  <br> faggot <br> weakling <br> loser <br>nope<br><br><br> sweet <br> loyal <br> determination <br>   MC <br>yup</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> is weak <br> overcomes her weakness and becomes strong <br><br>That's more than you ever achieved, anon, you are still here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was going to make the argument that Chris had a hard life, but still manages to smile through all those stored up negative feeling. But then I realized all the gears have had hard lives. Thus I've come to the conclusion that all gears smiles deserve a rank in the Above All Tiers Tier. <br><br>Thank you anon. My eyes have been opened. Today my love and appreciation for the has deepened because you.</br></br></br>  EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS<br><br>NO FUCKING PREVIEW PICS</br></br>  So how long before the budget for this season of Symphogear just Marianas trenches itself into oblivion? I think the last season got about 2 or 3 episodes before just plffffffffffffft. Honestly I'd be willing to give it a try if the show didn't just have that awful pattern for the garls factor, but I'd rather not see the show get inventive with what the character models are supposed to look like again.  <br>If you think Symphogear is bad, go watch Chaos Dragon.</br>  <br> Implying that Bikkie didn't overcome her weakness <br><br>Action movies nigga</br></br></br>  <br> garls factor <br>What?</br></br>  <br>They've animated up to episode 5 already one week ago so I'm hopeful they've organized the workload pretty well this time.</br>  <br><br>Maria being a weakling was actually a good thing as her lack of determination hindered their group and Ver's plans, she basically sabotaging them.</br></br>  <br>Well shit, we've finally figured out what Maria is good for.<br>Now we just need her to go turncoat and start working for Carol and the world should be fine.</br></br>  <br>You can wait for the BD's i f you can't handle the QUALITY, I hope there won't be a drop in quality though.<br><br>Looks good, I hope it stays consistent.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Too late, she has guts now.<br>Also it only worked because Ver was a retard. Carol is much more dangerous, she's Fine-level dangerous, maybe even worse.</br></br></br>  <br> Chaos Dragon <br> Bad <br>Nice meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you confusing the Design Archive with the Key Animation Note? Because that design sheet of Miku is straight from the Design Archive.</br>  <br>Those thighs should be illegal. Also, I wonder how Phara's breasts would feel like. It's advanced enough to have a life of its own so it should be lifelike too right?</br>  <br>That kick is just begging for an edit showing her  lack of   panties</br>  <br>But they do act like sisters when they have a bond that goes beyond friendship.</br>  <br>Her hair is all jointed up so I'm guessing she's not very soft.</br>  I will marry Tsubasa and every morning she will wake me up looking like this!  <br>I think he implied Chaos Dragon is a good show m8.</br>  <br>Can you even marry a sword?</br>  <br>Legal in Massachusetts.</br>  <br><br>The thumbnail looks creepy.</br></br>  <br>With love, nothing is impossible!</br>    <br>hey, at least she doesn't have a  tumblr </br>  Will there be a livestream other that chinese one from last thread that showed, like, 5 frames per minute?  <br>Am it he only one who didn't have a single lag with douyu?</br>  <br> I can see Tsubasa joining the otherkin club </br>  <br> not liking Tsubasa <br>pleb taste</br></br>  <br>How's your internet? 80Mbps?</br>  <br><br>I'm using australian shiternet, and I didn't have any lag during the episode itself.<br>The G intro beforehand was lagging though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>my internet is complete shit, but the G intro was also lagging for me</br></br>  <br><br>Try now, is douyu lagging now?</br></br>  How do I set the comments to be invisible?  <br>The cupcake woman?<br>Yeah, but I think that's because it's broadcasting a niconico stream.</br></br>  <br>no, running fluently  even though it takes forever to start the actual stream </br>  <br> marry Tsubasa <br>Not on my watch.</br></br>  <br>click the pen inside the square next to the volume</br>  <br>sorry, actually click the orange thing right to the volume<br>but this is from a niconico stream so you cannot get rid of them right now</br></br>  <br>No, I watched it fine too.</br>  <br>I want scans of the design archive more than the key animations.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon, you're also invited!</br>  <br>neetball?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127869712 <br><br>So this is the stream for this season?<br><br>I managed to wait for raws last week, but I'm not so sure I can be quite as patient this week.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> On all levels except physical, I am a wolf <br> speaking to people in English and knowing what a camera is </br></br>  <br> That nickname <br>Are you a Nanafag perhaps?</br></br>  <br>Videos were uploaded in less than an hour last week.</br>  <br><br>I know.

She is not from their world, just like Ea.</br>  <br> not knowing that since   Kung Fu Chaos </br>  http://symphogear-gx.com/next/  <br>Fucking finally.</br>  <br>The 2hu looks angry.</br>  WHY DOES THIS SHAKE WHEN I HOVER OVER THE THUMBNAIL<br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN</br>  <br>Oh, it's that scene. Shirabe Kirika getting involved and Maria in a straitjacket (shaking). I thought the Phara fight would be the one shaking picture.</br>  <br>That body is lewd</br>  <br>Why is Maria in jail? Have they finally made being useless a crime?</br>  <br>Looks like they aren't moving things along too quickly, which is good.</br>  <br>Every preview has a shaking image for some reason, the website administrator loves that shit.</br>  Channel name?    <br> Im still hype for the YOYOS <br><br>She better go all Sukeban Deka on it.</br></br></br>  I have a question bros and I figure you guys, the biggest Nanafags I know, would be able to answer it.<br><br>In all the performances of Innocent Starter (my favourite song) I've seen, at the end Nana says something without the mic that is almost always caught on camera. What does she say? I figure it's some sort of thank you or something but not saying it into the mic might mean it is extremely personal. Since the lyrics are a straight up love song for Nanoha and Fate could she be saying something to the most important person in her life? I'm genuinely curious and I can't lipread Jap.</br></br>  <br>flashback probably</br>  <br> Maria picture is shaking <br>Is she finally doing something or is her flashback really that exciting?</br></br>  New keywords, other updates too. Hard for me to check them all on my phone.  <br>Looks like Michael Jackson.</br>  <br>I said body, not face</br>  <br>Hibiki you should probably transform if someone is actively trying to murder you. Even if it is a cute little girl.</br>  <br>Would probably explain what happened after G, how DMJii are where they are now, what they did with Mamu's corpse and how she ended up doing a concert with Tsubasa.</br>   ch_kirika_school_kawaii <br>This is the actual god damn filename from the official website.<br>DESS confirmed cutest gear.</br></br>  <br>When did Shirabe learn web design?</br>  <br>I missed seeing the previews, trying to make sense of the intentionally vague shots and wondering why this one is shaking. Good times.</br>  <br> wobbling thumbnails <br> those filenames <br>Those web designers have way too much fun</br></br></br>  <br>Shirabe got the same treatment too.</br>  <br>http://symphogear-gx.com/characters<wbr>/ch_kirika_school_kawaii.png<br>http://symphogear-gx.com/characters<wbr>/ch_shirabe_school_kawaii.png<br>Both DMJii's are like this actually, but still. Also those wristbands.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>She says "ARIGATOU!" off mic sometimes, she shouts it but maybe her voice isn't that strong enough to be heard by the cameras.<br>Nana likes shouting thank you, because she always feels the urge to thank the people around her, and since Innocent Starter is a beginning of everything for Nana its only natural for her to do that. <br>Also the most important person to her is dead. The closest one she treasures the most next to her father is her family including her dog, then her job and staff, then her fans.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking Kirika's incredibly cute and girly fashion taste </br>  <br> 77 <br>Is this a test given by Nana?</br></br>  So we need to wait fucking BS11 airs GX every weeks.  <br> Marisa? Is dat you?</br>  <br>Maria pls just go home.</br>  Kirika and Shirabe a cute. CUTE.  The important question is will we see these gentlemen again?  <br>On the plus side, it means the few hours before the new episode will be non-stop hype every week, with the preview, new keywords, and Iguchi radio all hitting at once.</br>  <br>We are so dead.</br>  <br>Maybe Tsubasa's gonna get wrecked hard that they don't want to hype the scene.<br>Or the webdevs are FISfags.</br></br>   get home from work <br> previews <br>We made it</br></br>  <br>Just think of it as a resting period, so that our hearts will be at least twenty percent ready when they drop the universe on us in episode 7.</br>   Destroy the world---but before that   <br>http://www.symphogear-g.com/story/n<wbr>ext01.php<br><br>Looking at the previous shaking pictures of G, it ranged from Genjuro reacting to Gungnir to Maria VS Tsubasa to Chris eating sloppily. Don't mind the shaking pictures, part of the fun is guessing why it is and being completely wrong.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I can just feel the bikizerker coming.</br>  <br>Nana has a dog?</br>  <br><br>That's what I assumed at first but she definitely isn't shouting and she gets all teary-eyed. It also looks like she says more than just a thank you, but you're probably right.

Hee.. </br>  <br> 88 <br>Well done OP, 8man will be proud of you.</br></br>  Iroha has no feelings for 8man.<br><br>Yui's feelings are not genuine.<br><br> Long time no see, /a/! </br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Oregairu will end with this scene.  <br> Those look strikingly similar to the glasses 8man bought her. </br>  <br> “Did you say pointless!? I-Is not! Actually, I’m not the one being sly, it’s you, senpai!” <br><br>Well if anything, I'm glad we got the full context of this scene. This line kind of confused me in the anime since the progression of the conversation didn't give me the impression of 8man acting "sly" in anyway; so I just assumed it was Iroha doing making a comeback. <br><br>But after reading the chapter it actual does kind of give the impression of 8man being sly; at least from Iroha's perspective. Denying the fact that he has a preference for younger girls, but bringing up her birthday and commenting that he doesn't consider her younger than him (in other words it could be interpreted by her as him saying she is still in his hit zone), does actually sound like he's being tsundere about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Watari sabotage her character like that?<br>I'm very depressed.<br>Does she have any chance of of development?<br>It looks like a never ending night for her.<br>I'm not so sure anymore about what will happen to her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouhou, is that you?</br>  <br> Yukino <br> character </br></br>  <br>  not ZR <br>8/10<br><br><br>  being this much of a faggot </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yuki <br> no </br></br></br>  <br> Why did Watari sabotage her character like that? <br>It's not so much sabataging as it is setup. All of her defenses are down around 8man. She wants to be herself but doesn't know who that is. Yukino will be a much stronger character once her issues have been resolved.<br> I'm very depressed. <br>Fuck off with your blogshit.<br> Does she have any chance of of development? <br>She has the highest chance of character development out of any character in the series right now.<br> It looks like a never ending night for her. <br> I'm not so sure anymore about what will happen to her. <br>Quit being so pessimistic. Remember that this is literature. Every time a problem is introduce it's so that it can be resolved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukinofags <br> taste <br><br>Go back to animesuki and circlejerk with that Spyro tripfag.</br></br></br></br>  rip sexy yukino<br><br>fuck FEEL</br></br>   She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt.

And I'm not going to bother find that part because you would keep insisting she has her hymen intact unless WW states she got a dick in her womb</br>  <br>Well, yeah.

Occasionally, I’d learn from the masses, take in the mood, and play it off. Then, I’d just brush it all off with a simple “it’s what everyone’s doing.” Doing that made you want to have expectations, be spoiled, lose yourself, and wait. <br><br> But I don’t think that’s something you should do. <br><br> It’d be insincere if all you did was wait. Regardless of the answer and conclusion awaiting you at the end of the tunnel, you should make sure to take that step forward without deception and incredulity and leave the regrets for afterwards. <br><br> That’s why, I took in the mood and decided to ask now. <br><br> “By the way…” <br><br> I squeezed out those words with a hoarse voice and Yuigahama turned around. Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br><br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br><br>The fact in this scene that 8man genuinely take initiative by himself to step forward his relationship with Yui is something rare to seen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gigolo: a young man paid or financially supported by an older woman to be her escort or lover. <br>Not that anon, but she specifically mentioned that guy was a gigolo, who left and took the furniture with him when he was done with her.

U-Um, yeah, I do… I think, “ Yuigahama said, prattling on and moving her hands in surprise. She fidgeted as she frantically took out her cellphone. But then, her movements abruptly stopped. <br> She shot a glance to the door of the club. After that, she had trouble bringing out her voice. And unlike earlier, her expression sank. <br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again? I just wasn’t confident in any of those. <br> Unable to exchange any more words, I glanced at her face, my back still slumped and my eyes downcast. The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. <br> To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying he didn't invite her just because he feel guilty about delay it too long (and gone with Iroha in the mean time also) </br>  <br>Thanks anon, been waiting to grab this for a while now. <br><br><br>I was thinking that might have been what motivated him to ask her. In the anime it feels like it almost comes out of nowhere, but considering that pang of guilt he felt at the end of the Iroha date, it seems likely that he asked her because of that.</br></br></br></br>  The producer of the anime said that the ending of episode 13 will be gut wrenching and very painful.<br><br> Where was the pain? </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I thought he feels guilty because he already doing date with another woman(Iroha) before fulfilling his promise with Yui.</br></br></br></br>  TL-Irohafag,<br>Can you give a summary of this?</br>  What is this face<br><br>trying to convey?</br></br>     8man can't make up his mind <br>   he gets won over by Yui during someday <br>   they start dating <br>   Yukino very supportive, but sad inside <br>   8man talks to Yukino alone about his relationship with Yui <br>   Yukino confesses her feelings one last time and cries into his chest <br>   she sneaks a kiss and they give into their primal desires <br>   8man starts ignoring Yui more and more while meeting Yukino on the side <br>   Yukino and Yui's friendship causes drama, 8man just avoids them both for a while <br>   not sure what to do, he decides to hang out with Iroha <br>   this time she's more sly than ever and 8man reciprocates, they fuck like rabbits <br>   8man, brimming with confidence, starts putting the moves on everyone <br>   he goes after Saki, Sensei, Haruno, and even Miura at one point <br>   word gets out that 8man is a manslut, he gets shunned by everyone in the school <br>   Yui says she still loves him after all this time, 8man is happy and they start dating again <br>   Yukino invites 8man over to officially end things between them <br>   8man recieves a textmessage <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aQ3<wbr>Xs86Io00</wbr>  [ ] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It says  fuck you EOP, you girl is a slut </br>  <br>What's this face trying to convey?</br>  <br>Even so he is eager to fulfill his promise with Yui properly as his monolog in this scene.<br><br> I understood what Komachi meant when she said “next time”. The “promise”, though I wasn’t sure if I could really call it that, was something I did make tentatively. The problem was when, where, and how to ask about it. Having no semblance of experience with going out with others had me at a loss at a time like this. Just how did everyone invite each other when going out? <br><br>Which is actually weird where he could just try to half assed it like he did in iroha's date(movie scene, scoring scene) if he doesn't have any feeling for her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's too alpha.</br>  <br>Is that so?</br>  Why does no one care about the translations? I haven't seen a single person comment on 8man asking Yui out other than myself. I feel like such a significant scene in terms of romance should have more attention.  <br>It has been brought multiple times, specifically, episode 12 and 13 tone down 8man's myriads of emotions.</br>  <br>Not a date, much less as a romantic gesture. Maybe until Hachiman starts praising Yui as the ideal and real thing he seeks, then maybe things will change. Until then though.</br>  <br>Yukinofags and Irohafags are trying to pretend this scene didn't happen.</br>  <br>I don't get why the anime staff would do that.</br>  <br>You missed SORE ARU</br>  <br>Because no one knows 8man intention to invite Yui to a date.<br><br> May be he will ask her out, may be he will reject her by confess he has feeling for another girl (this is what Yui thought, too) </br></br></br>  <br>Komachi x Saki no otouto</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's why he deliberately ask her out in the valentine mood. <br><br>That's also why he felt slightly upset when Yui rejected him.<br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? </br></br></br></br>  <br>At very least it implied in that scene he did it without intention to hurt her.<br><br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br><br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again?

The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. <br><br> To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br><br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br><br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? <br><br>So I think he didn't do it to reject her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Or maybe because this wasn't anything we didn't know about and they've been promising each other to go on a date since volume 6? <br><br>While it is significant that 8man was the one who asked, there's no point in talking about it. Much like every other time they've promised to go out before, it'll be pushed back, most likely because of Yukino's request.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that's also why he felt slightly upset when Yui rejected him. <br>Really? I thought he is feel hurt when he see her in that state.<br> The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. </br></br></br>  <br>I'm chalking they don't want to make him look unnaturally emotional... because he always look deadbeat outside genuine scene<br><br>Because all his frustration were monologue, and monologues are hard a shit to do properly</br></br></br>  <br>Yui's date been pushed back so many times it'll probably only succeed on the 8th try. cos 8 allegory and all that shit.</br>  <br>I was being sarcastic</br>  <br>I am a Yukinofag though, and even the Yuifags weren't discussing it.</br>  <br>Indeed he didn't want to hurt her, but that doesn't mean his intention wasn't to reject her.<br><br>Maybe he wanted to let her down in the smoothest way possible. Or maybe he was interesting in going out with her and was afraid he asked at the wrong time. It's really unclear.</br></br></br>  <br>Same old ambiguous approach kills it for me. Not wanting regrets but taking in the mood at the same time probably makes sense for 8man since he still needs an external reason to push him but eh it's so wishy-washy from WW. <br><br>Wouldn't hurt to make things stronger with the endgame in sight. Make things more high-stake for Hikki and us is all I'm asking.</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe he wanted to let her down in the smoothest way possible <br><br>I doubt it is his intention. The fact 8man himself know how fearful rejection are, and he did ask her out around valentine day out of any day just for reject her in the smoothest way possible is totally out character for me especially for someone inexperience in human relationship like he is.</br></br></br>  <br>At this point  pretty much sums up my feelings on the whole thing. There's an argument to be made for just about every possible intention imaginable<br><br>Watari has this nasty habit of progressing the story while somehow managing to never make it clear what exactly is going on.<br><br>For a story told from 8man's perspective we know almost nothing about how he feels.<br><br>Even his "something genuine" is something he explains he's not even sure exists and can't describe properly. Gee, thanks Watari, that helped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly Yahari would be better as third person narration<br><br>With absolutely zero bias, Watari can fully control the amount of information given to the readers at any given time.<br><br>Then again<br>  High school harem comedy <br>  3rd neutral POV <br>  Not first person self insert <br><br>Market demands</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monologues and introspection helps to make the individual scenes great imo and WW does it well. I don't mind ambiguity in those since it helps establish the gap the characters are facing but guddammit if my earlier point about WW being wishy washy doesn't tick me off time to time since it's clear he's playing coy too much about 8man's feelings.</br>  <br><br> 147,055　Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.

May you all live long and fulfilling lives.</br></br></br>  <br>Well that's why i need proper translation of this page to conclude how 8man actually feel about Yui after seeing her "nasty" side.<br><br>Here my bizzare conclusion( i don't really confident about it though) from this page: <br>-In his monologue there is line that show 8man doesn't want to lie to someone important to him.(I think it refering how he reject Yui proposal because he thinks it is wrong thing to do and he truly think Yukino should solve her own problem by herself.)<br><br>-After Yui said" I thought hikki would say that...". <br>8man's face become like "copper"(red?/embrassed?) when seeing her face smiling with flowing tears in her cheek. and he said in his monologue he doesn't want to seeing her Zama-like face(sad face?/"not nice girl"face?)anymore.<br><br>-Another 8man and Yui broken eye contact(8man avert his face because embrassment i guess?).<br><br>- In his monologue 8man said something like<br>even i(8man) and her(Yui) had different answer for now. it doesn't really matter as long as they continue seeking right answer together.<br><br>-Yui seeing 8man with straight face, bla-bla-bla something cut off to next page.<br><br>source: google translate with some research for each word.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>forgot the image.</br>  <br>The weird thing is with Yui its all about taking steps over lines and shit. If you take into account his asking her out, I dont get the feeling there were romantic overtones in why he asked her out (as not Vol 11). Its just him yet again trying to gauge the distance between them and him taking into account the mood and shit<br><br>Meanwhile, when he asks Yukino to be his friend (twice mind you), he monologues about how his heart starts fluttering and how he feels passion swelling up in him. Im not saying that this points to a Yuki end but these emotions feels are closer to "romance" <br><br>Compare: <br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? <br><br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Haruno x truck-kun <br>don't bully Haruno</br></br>  <br>The whole "He and She have yet to reach the conclusion" is a theme that has been recurring with Yui and Yukino since the series began. <br><br>I remember in Vol 6, the final chapter was titled "At last, he and she find the correct answer" but in this case the she was referring to Yukino since that chapter wraped up the Yukino never lies subplot and HachixYuki's relationship was finally mended (at the time)</br></br></br>  <br> even i(8man) and her(Yui) had different answer for now. it doesn't really matter as long as they continue seeking right answer together <br><br>Seems similar to what he monologued to Yukino about the colors of the sky in Vol 10.5</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to believe this but at this point after seeing flag after flag raised for every single ending imaginable I've pretty much resigned to accept the fact that Watari is going to do everything in his power to confuse us.<br><br>I take solace in knowing the anime favored Yukino but it's not source material so as with everything else in the series you just have to accept that it's not clear evidence.</br></br></br>  <br>I like what you pointed out here but the bigger takeaway for me was this:<br><br> Yuigahama is a kind person, that was how I decided baselessly. <br><br> Yukinoshita is a strong person, that was how I forced my ideals onto her. <br><br> Thinking like that was how I kept relying on them. For that exact reason, I couldn't rely on them anymore. I can't run away from her kindness, neither could I answer that kindness with lies. <br><br> Because, Yuigahama is a kind person, and Yukinoshit is a strong person. <br><br>The characters for "kind" and "kindness" were kept the same throughout this part and it's pretty obvious it's referencing Yui right here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to this anime? Is the studio on a hiatus?<br>And also while I'm here, is the LN worth picking up if the best girl obviously isn't going to be the end game?</br>  <br>godammit I missed an a. sorry yukinofags ;_;</br>  Watari has an annoying habit of furthering the plot without actually advancing it (if that makes sense)<br><br>Take his relationship with Yui and whatever it may entail. He made progress this chapter but in the end he is still after Volumes and Volumes still trying to gauge the distance with her. <br><br>Yukino is slight different than Yui in that the gauging of distance has never been the focial point of their relationship (barring him asking about the career path). Its pretty clear that everytime shit happens between YukixHachi, they get closer to each other only for another problem to arise between them that leads to more conflict (though I suspect that wont be the case anymore)<br><br> Yukino never lies/Culture Festival Arc <br> Ebina Confession/Stuco Election Arc <br><br>Shit hit the fan between them and they grew closer by the end of the arc<br><br> Yukino's Identity/Dependency Issues <br>The current and I believe final problem that will arise in their relationship whatever it may be and I suspect that they will grow closer by the end of it as well. <br><br>If you're a Yukinofag, I guess you can take solace in knowing that the overarching plot has always been about Yukino and Hachiman since Volume 1 (though this does not mean they are endgame, Yui can still win)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is EOP speaking, but from what I get, Hachiman is thinking about the sheer difference of 'nice girl' and nice girl.<br><br>You know that stereotype about nice guys being secret assholes? The old Hachiman think Yui is the same, because he's not rejected and ridiculed not once, but twice by that type of girl.<br><br>But with Yui, he realized that her kindness and love for him is genuine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All it means is that he is over "nice girls" which everyone expected he would have to get over by the time the series ends.<br><br>It also means that he can either accept or reject Yui without regrets/baggage surrounding his decision. Because if he rejects Yui without ever fully being over "nice girls", then it wont be a genuine rejection (he rejects her because he hates nice girls and not for Reason X)<br><br>Same vein, he would never accept Yui's confession if he mistakens Yui's love for something else (nice girls being well nice)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> best girl obviously isn't going to be the end game? <br>But Iroha is clearly on track to winning</br></br>  <br>  clearly on track of winning <br>Did you miss the exact post where 8man flat out said her action didn't affect him much?<br/></br></br>  The very last volume, the epilogue, is going to be exactly like Ben-To's last volume.<br><br>Every girl will win<br><br> and when every girl wins, no one does </br></br></br></br>  <br>If nothing else I expect 8man and Yukino to have the strongest relationship by the end of the series, even if they aren't interested in each other romantically.<br><br>Like I've said before, at this point in the series it's clear they're likely to be lifelong friends at the very least.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop linking your shitty bait post</br>  <br>Stop getting baited</br>  <br>You could simply say that Watari is a hack author and can only advance the plot by using continued drama.</br>  <br>  Bait <br>Right, anon. Of course it's a bait.<br><br>Tell me why is Iroha never involved with main plot and the drama that entails?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now this is more clever. Well done anon.<br><br>Practice more and you can master the art of baiting.</br></br></br>  <br>Here is your reply</br>  <br>And what else would you suggest he use to advance the plot of his character drama? comedy? maybe a few fight scenes?</br>  <br>He could use more fluff to stop the fucking dramatrain and give them development all the same<br><br>But noooo, Watari gave literally everything to Iroha because he had such a big boner for his kouhai.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see your answer anon.</br>  <br>Here is your reply</br>  <br>ʎldǝɹ ɹnoʎ sᴉ ǝɹǝH</br>  <br><br>Ⓗⓔⓡⓔ ⓘⓢ ⓨⓞⓤⓡ ⓡⓔⓟⓛⓨ</br></br>  <br>Anon you're coming off as a frustrated YYfag who's envious of Irohafags.<br><br>Watar's writing is questionable and by no means perfect. If you really want to discuss this can you be more specific in what you take issue with? All you're giving us is vague statements.</br></br></br>  <br>He's an Irohafag, logic doesn't dictate their thoughts or actions. They just can't handle how far ahead Yui and Yukino are.</br>  I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?  <br>By using unexpected events. Like  Komachi failed the exam  for example.</br>  <br> against her will </br>  <br>It's confirmed to be 100% friendship<br><br>She's just confused since she has never had a genuine friendship before.</br></br></br>  You guys have been circlejerking too much, don't you get tired? Most of the replies have been recycled to oblivion.  <br>I like Iroha, but I wish Watari can balance things out instead of giving rom com to one side and full on drama to the others.<br><br>I mean, Iroha doesn't even see anything resembles conflict since V9. How the hell that's considered good storytelling? Or is Iroha really third wheel to YY like YYfags and Irohaters believe?</br></br></br>  <br>I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is Yukino acting like a schoolgirl around her crush?</br>  <br>She already is a school girl so she can't not act like one.</br>  <br>Self inserters like school gurls that act virginal</br>  <br>Not him, but I do prefer those kind of stories that plot doesn't just happen conveniently to make the characters growing closer or solving recent popped up problems.<br><br>Also, I will be more pissed off if he introduce Iroha just to be a plot device. Like her existence is just for 8man to grow out of his fear for nice girl, change his perspective towards girls, make the other heroines realize their feelings towards 8man... or some of those cases.<br><br>WW must be better than that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875473 <br> nobody is actually stupid enough to believe _____ <br>you would be surprised</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875473 <br> mfw this is almost word for word the reply I expected. <br>4 months of BTBs and you know each and every kind of answer, bait, falseflag or reverse falseflag</br></br>  <br>deleted mfw because you've actually clarified your point much better here, sorry for implying you were just trying to bait.</br>  <br> I mean, Iroha doesn't even see anything resembles conflict since V9. <br>Because she's done.</br></br>  YYfag here<br><br>I think Iroha should win because she has the best chemistry with 8man, likes him the most without having issues, and has made his life better so far. He has shown that he has a much more healthy relationship with him than YY. YYx2 will be developed but I can no longer think of them as legit romantic interests.</br></br>  ^ DON'T REPLY TO BAIT  At this point I'm sure we're all aware that the anime highlighted Yukino's scenes and downplayed or cut out the other girls' scenes.<br><br>Is it naive to think that this was done because they know that Yukino will win?</br></br>    yfw V12 wrapped up all the drama <br>  V13 have Yahari returns to the roots of case per episode but with post-development character </br>  <br> At this point I'm sure we're all aware that the anime highlighted Yukino's scenes and downplayed or cut out the other girls' scenes. <br> Yui and Iroha got all the budget while Yukino scenes always look off. <br>Gee, I wonder if that's true.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>They did it this way because WW wants Iroha end to be a surprise. Yukino flags are red herrings.</br>  <br> mfw after stories almost never happen </br>  <br> Or is Iroha really third wheel to YY like YYfags and Irohaters believe? <br>I hate to say "yes" to a reasonable Irohafag but probably, yes. Yahari is drama now, and Iroha appears to quite literally be the comedy relief (as in comedic elements included in a serious work to relieve dramatic tension).<br><br>I'm a die hard Yuifag, but I have no issues with Yukino winning because of the direction the story has gone, and if Watari manages to actually bring Iroha into the central conflict as you suggest, I'd have no problem with her winning either.<br><br><br>I would love a full epilogue volume of "classic" Yahari shenanigans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention Kawasaki and Orimoto, too.<br><br>And Zaimokuza and Totsuka almost disappeared in volume 11.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just the director being Yukinofag. Watari wouldn't reveal the ending to anybody but his editor because it would be leaked<br><br><br>And then the series continues for 12 more volumes of drama-free SoL,  nandatte and best friends </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you anon I'm laughing so hard</br>  <br>You know what I mean. They basically cut out every hint that 8man has feelings for Yui. Meanwhile they made the infirmary scene a much bigger deal than it was in the LN.<br><br>And just look at pic related. If that isn't favoritism I don't know what is.</br></br></br>  <br> look at these dumb goys, they actually think there will be a resolution or a plot point during the next arc <br>I wonder how much he laughs about all the shekels he makes?</br></br>  Right now, if the feelings they have are really love then there's almost no way for 8man to answer one isn't there? I mean, seeing your bestfriend spend the rest of her life with someone that you wanted to do the same with, is just painful and would surely make their relationship crumble. I've always wanted Yukino to win but it seems like there's null chance of that happening.<br><br>One way I can see this getting resolved where someone wins is that:<br> they all realize their feelings <br> it isn't love, but friendship <br> Iroha wins at the end <br> YY happy <br> 8man happy <br> Iroha happy <br><br>All conflicts resolved, all characters happy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they want to put emphasis on Yui being underdog, seriously, all her suffering were beautifully animated while Yukino just meh.<br><br>The train scene was the worst offender. Iroha's 'take responsibility' was pretty touching while Yukino lost her socks for some reason (?) despite being very important to put emphasis to her budding romance and growing reliance to 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>  Yui lost <br>  Friendship <br>You serious M8?</br></br></br>  Discuss spoilers.  <br>Souma is the cutest MC. I want to marry Souma!</br>  First for best girls.  What was the fucking point of register a place if he can move freely later.  Phase 2 of Operation Defrost the Dairy Queen is underway.  <br><br><br> pic related <br>How much until she falls for Souman?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm guessing Souma plans to build up hype for the cart, then park in front of Yugi at the end for a head to head. He basically can't win in total sales, so he has to win for one day and of course, it'll be the last day.<br><br>Having said that, selling outside of your designated area seems like the kind of thing they wouldn't really allow.<br><br> Inb4 the school counts that against Souma and disqualifies any sales he made outside his area. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm still waiting for someone to add some car headlights to one of the pages where Erina does that face.  Waiting another week (or more) to find out who the mystery person is will be killer.  <br>Im guessing he's going to walk the cart around cooking them and using the site/smell to get people interested and advertise, but won't actually sell any until he returns to his own area.</br>  <br>It wouldnt surprise me if it was Marui.</br>  <br> is Ryou going to punch Hayama <br>I don't think so. His tone was more bored/exasperated and you could see him sigh in the spoiler image. A more accurate TL would've been<br> "Look who's talking" <br> "Oh, that's rich" <br>but it's hard to say taken out of context.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Thank you, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone who says Souma is dumb or asexual or whatever isn't paying attention. He just has a goal and is really focused on it. He acts airheaded but there are always panels  that show that he's thinking about things he doesn't want to discuss out loud.  <br>They do need to advertise their spot if they want to attract people.</br>  <br>How does that prove he isn't asexual though?</br>  <br>So its listed on the map/newspaper/flyers? <br><br>It definitely seemed that with going with a cart his entire thing was moving around.</br></br></br>  <br>Tsukuda is finally putting Erina into more scenes with the main cast than ever before this past month or so.</br>  <br>If he's smart enough to read social cues then he's clearly aware of sexuality. Plus he remembered his dad's quote.</br>  <br>Until he shows some sexual attraction he doesn't have any sexual attraction</br>  <br>Because we're basically moving into E10 territory, Captain Obvious.</br>  <br>Nah. He's like the med student who studies all the time and doesn't go out with his friends.<br><br>Do you expect him to be some drooling doofus like Issei? The other boys could be called asexual too if we're going by that standard.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some retarded logic you got there.</br>  Soma is impressive in the way that he get almost every single girl in this manga trying to slobber all over his cock, but he never shows them anything other than friendship. I believe if he asked any girl in this manga for a date, they would probably accept.<br><br>Except Erina, but she'll come later.</br></br>  <br> almost every single girl in this manga trying to slobber all over his cock <br> almost every single </br></br>  <br> Almost every girl <br>As far as I remember the only one who has feeling for him is Nikumi, Mehgoo is starting to realize and Erina falling for him in the future is just the logical outcome.<br>So you have three girls out of what? 10?</br></br></br>  <br>The only girls interested in souma are nikumi and childhood friend.</br>  <br> Almost every girl <br>Just 2 girls, Erina and Megumi havent fall yet,</br></br>  <br>Megumi, Meat, Childhood friend. Slobbering on his dick might have been a little exaggerated, but I stand by the date comment.</br>  <br>You forget childhood friend.</br>  <br>Well Megumi has not fallen for him yet.<br> Childhood friend <br>Shit I didn't even remember she existed.</br></br></br>  I WANT TO FUCK ALICE  <br>She'll probably end up not being important again.</br>  <br>Seems like he'll use the smell and curiosity as his trump card. After everyone has seen and eaten just about everything, they'll be dying to know what that "mysterious" thing is.</br>  i want to cum in erina  <br> Well Megumi has not fallen for him yet. <br>After her and Soma finished teaching that one loli with Isshiki, I think she might have fallen a little bit. Or maybe I need to reread the manga.</br></br>  <br> Erina unknowingly opening up to Souma <br>I love this. I LOVE THIS.</br></br>  <br>You sure you will get past Mad Dog?</br>  <br>she had a doki moment, then forgot about it. Tsukuda confirmed not yet, so I imagine we'll know it when we see it.

And Soma has done none of them.</br>  <br> Erina: ...anyway, this is hardly the time to be worried about the other areas. // You have to concentrate on beating Kuga-san in the Central Area– <br>I like how she subtly shifted into wanting him to stay.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it just because she's annoyed Yugi disrespected the first years like the rest of them?</br>  <br>awww she actually wants him to stay. <br><br>I must say that I really like this arc right now because of the Souma and Erina conversations</br></br></br>  <br>Do any of the guys show interest?</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>IIRC she didn't really care, her and Megumi were the only ones that weren't fired up after the tea party</br>  <br>Megumi was a little peeved.</br>  <br>yeah she didn't. Unlike the rest of them, she must be used to him anyway. Although I guess Hisako has had some exposure to him before too, given that flashback we saw recently.<br><br><br>Honestly, this caught me by surprise though. I knew Erina was past wanting him to get kicked out, but I thought at most she'd lecture him to give up on trying to beat Kuga and just focus on getting a profit so he doesn't get expelled. Instead she's basically telling him get his shit together and beat Kuga.</br></br></br></br>   Megumi: W-We're... <br> Megumi: We're so sorry...! <br> Erina: I-I wasn't addressing you, Tadokoro-san... <br><br> Never mind the Soumabowl, these two should just win each other's bowl. </br></br></br></br>  <br> 111 push ups with a single arm <br>What is he, Thor?</br></br>  <br>I want them to become friends already.</br>  <br> Hisako has a soft spot for Souma <br> Erina has a soft spot for Megumi <br><br>This is nice.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They should eat each other's bowls. <br><br>Fuckin' parallels, man.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> 111 push-ups with a single arm <br> 15 years old <br><br>is that even possible irl even with injections and shit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, you fatty.</br>  <br>he probably doesn't even go all the way down</br>  <br>It's because we've finally met the Elite Ten, and Erina is part of the new generation of first years looking to break into the Elite Ten. The idea of taking down Kuga appeals to her.</br>  <br>I really want to see them mix things up again for another arc or two.</br>  <br>She's already inside, you knucklehead.</br>  <br> people actually think Ryou is attractive </br>  <br>They should trade sidekicks, Souma and Erina.</br>  <br>they should</br>  <br>Nobody mentioned he's attractive though.</br>  <br>Ryou is cute.</br>  <br>It was more of a general statement.<br><br>Zombies are not cute.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah he's ugly as hell</br>  <br>I don't remember this page exist.</br>  <br>Alice's introduction chapter.<br><br><br>The Jewels Generation absolutely sucks.

I don't find the chapter in their website.</br></br>  <br>I ship them.<br> I think it's fun to imagine them fucking while still obsessing over Soma in their minds. </br></br>  <br>In case you're wondering what they said <br><br>Previous page:<br> Hey Kurokiba, what's wrong with your master <br> Up to a day before she was constantly switching menus, that's why we made this huge blunder!! <br> What are you talking about <br>Next Page:<br> Tomorrow will probably be like this too <br> Hayamareaction.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>come on son<br>dont you know how this is done by now</br></br>  <br>I hope so too. Takumi deserves a win after the Election  and maybe people will finally stop calling him a jobber. </br>  She has the best reactions, so cute.  <br>Even if the shop loses its first place in the last couple of days, they should have a good lead over everyone else, so I'm betting on them winning the overall 1st place.<br><br>Kuga is visibly worried though.</br></br></br>  <br>Did people really call him a jobber after one lose?</br>  <br>The Italian Jobber.</br>  <br>Are you new to these threads?</br>  I kinda get what happened.<br><br>That Souma we saw in last page and Nao saw too isn't Souma, but the mysterious person whom Souma gave the key, and is doing the sellings for night while Souma prepares more of that chinese dishes (same way, when Souma was selling and failing in day, that person was cooking more dishes).<br><br>I dunno who that person could be. Wild guess will be Elite Ten #2 slut. But that's a very wild guess of mine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nao is so cute.</br>   Tsukasa 5th <br>So is he spilling his spaghetti all over the place?<br> Momo 1st and beating Erina in the high class area <br>Now I'm really curious about what Momo is doing.</br></br></br>  WHO IS THE HAND?  <br>if it isn't a new character, it will be Subaru, shota reporter or a guy in PSD (Smoke, Glasses, Buttbros).<br><br>All of them are unlikely though, Subaru is too big to dress up like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Houjou?<br>It's a pretty great plan that lets her beat Yugi while bearing no risk because it's not her booth.</br></br>  <br>What if it's one of Kuga's baldies.</br>  <br>It's really a male. Might be the one who is selling at night.</br>  <br>  Subaru, shota reporter <br>My first thoughts, but hand is too small for Giganigga and too big for the shota.</br></br>  <br>Isshiki?</br>  <br>Gonna bet reporter-kun or a new character.</br>  <br>actually Souma doesn't need to meet any guy in PSD in the main door.</br>  After analyzing the pic for second time, yes, it could perfectly be Hojou. Still, she told Megumi she was going to help other booth (never said what booth it was).<br><br>Still, I'm 100% sure last page Souma isn't Souma but a mysterious helper.</br></br>  is nao shippable with anyone?  <br>Hisoko-oneesama</br>    <br>Rindou.<br>Here me out. If Souma wanted someone's help, he'd go to them and not ask them to come to him.<br>Here it seems like someone got out of their way to see Souma and propose some sort of agreement.</br></br></br>  <br>Donguy always wanted to fuck some meat</br>  <br>Wouldn't it sooner be Eizan or Nene then? Since they also seem to hate Yugi it's plausible.</br>  I think is Rindou or Hojou. Still, why to hide that from Megumi?  <br>Makes sense, she'd probably want to sabotage whatever agreement Yugi has with the autist.</br>  We finally gonna get the new ED today, fucking HYPE!   Souma <br> manga, "black" hair and eyes <br> anime, red hair, yellow eyes <br>It's like I kind of have to readjust for each.</br></br></br>  I'm watching the anime and I'm curious, did the girls make any moves on Souma or vice versa?  <br>nope - no moves</br>  <br>Souma and  Tak umi slept together. Truly best girl.</br>  Why does everyone think there's going to be a new character?  <br>Rindou is weird because she's not showing anywhere on the ranks</br>  <br>She (and Eizan) are involved in managing the event (and hence not participating).</br>  <br>How do you know?</br>  <br>Erina says so.</br>  <br>Houjou is basically the only person who has reasons to help Souma that way.<br>Shota journo doesn't really fit the bill.</br></br>  <br>Page/Panel?</br>  <br>It was in the spoilers when the first pages leaked.</br>  <br>fuck you anon. I read it like that,too.</br>  <br>She says so anon, he isn't lying.</br>  <br>Sure, but Nene hasn't shown any curiosity about Souma, while Eizan hates Souma.<br>Rindou however is hinted to be interested in the interaction between Souma and Kuga.<br>It's admittedly flimsy, but I standby the possibility that the other person sought Souma out.<br>That, or Souma talked to someone in the PSD earlier and is now just seeing them off. The only thing wrong with this is his expression when the other person leaves. If it was someone he trusted, wouldn't he be less wary?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just to let you know, nowhere in the chapter did it mention they were part of management.</br>  <br>He's wary because he doesn't want anyone else to notice about it.<br>And the person doesn't look like Rindo anyway.</br></br>  <br>Page/Panel?</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Also.<br><br>2nd page, top middle panel, Souma is asking about 2nd seat.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm not gonna care about inaccurate translations.<br><br>I just read the actual chapter, &amp; I want to know where did it mention they were part of management.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you even understand Chink?</br>  <br><br>Well if you just read the actual chapter, then you would know where 2nd seat is actually mentioned.<br>I just pointed to you a panel where 2nd seat is referenced (just compare the character for seat between that page and the ranking). <br>How about you read that page in your actual chapter and find out for yourself whether it says 2nd seat is helping to run the thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that anon was sprouting out of his ass, nowhere in the chapter did they say Eizan was part of the management. Souma asked why aren't they on the list, didn't they participate? And Megumi replied that she saw him preparing something during the tea party.</br>  <br>Ditto.<br><br>These faggots actually fell for the inaccurate translations, &amp; actually had the cheek to verify that fake info when they don't even know a lick of Chink.</br></br></br>  <br> that anon was sprouting out of his ass <br> sprouting <br> out of his ass </br></br></br>  <br>His tail bone became functional and grew</br>  So is the festival on day 3 now?  <br>day 2 anon.</br>  <br>If new tanks are out at the end of the chapter it means a day passed, no?</br>  I really loved it how the top 8 hang out together now. But why the fuck meat has to be there? Goddammit.  <br>She's Souma's friend and one of the top competitors for one of the areas.</br>   Erina's slow defrosting <br><br>So perfect. I hope Tsukuda doesn't fuck this up somewhere along the line, because so far this is the best example of this kind of classic tsundere progression I've ever seen.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with this shit. These threads have been getting unbearable with this pointless Meat hate. Why do you guys insist on keeping this stupid shit up?</br>  <br>Yeah, I really hope he doesn't try to speed up the process unnecessarily. The only factor that should play into this is Soma's talents, not his relationship with his dad.</br>  Tsukuda a shit, this chapter looks boring as hell.  <br><br>Watch it end in this.</br></br>  <br>How is he even fucking this up? He already pointed out Souma's performance in the Elections changed Erina's opinion on him, quite considerably, as we've observed so far. And just to let you know, he'd be visiting Erina's booth, so that will be another thing for the Megumifags to dread about.</br>  <br>Fuck off, summer.<br><br><br>Fuck off with your overused meme.<br><br>Seriously, just fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best thing about this two arcs is that she is finally hanging out with the kids in her year. Guess all those complains about Erina being neglectable in the past arcs came through</br>  <br><br><br><br>Tsukuda said in one of his tweets last year that one of his favorite methods of preparing food is slow cooking it in a slow fire. Slow cooking tends to result to a very tender and flavorable dish that no other method can replicate.<br><br>We're not witnessing Erina's defrosting, anon, we're seeing her simmering for hours on end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like how she lusts over Soma's dick for some reason<br><br>Dunno, she would be a better character if there are some development between her and the don guy</br></br></br>  <br><br> overused meme <br><br>the pic was only made last thread, anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its still 'defrosting', no matter how you look at it.</br>  <br>For some reason? Your explanation sounds pretty retarded.<br><br><br>Just fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br> takumi ever ending with a girl <br> ending with the best girl <br> not becoming Giga´s fuck boytoy <br><br>Takumi stop its sad to see you even try anymore, you got a taste of that black cock and we all know you loved it.</br></br></br></br></br>  That face when you realise mehgoomyfags are going to be walking on eggshells in these threads and are always going to be defensive going forward.<br><br>That face when you realise mehgoomyfags are are going to become knights of the told republic.<br><br>That face when mehgoomyfags are going to be in the same situation as Kuronekofags</br></br></br></br>  So we getting recap today or not  Who are worst cancer - Rindoufags or Erinafags?  <br> overused meme <br><br>You're fucking retarded those pictures were made in the last thread<br><br>Stop accusing people of being summerfags when you're obviously one of them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your oreimo incest shit.<br><br><br>Yes, we are. Maybe you'd want to lurk more before spouting redundant crap.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah but considering the manga's subject matter, slow cooking is pretty apt.<br><br>Anyhow, I wonder when we'll see a full length Shokugeki with her. We've seen her pull results like her Eggs Benedict and her beating that sumo wrestling dude in the early chapters but I always wanted to see her technique and the way she cooks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>day 3 anon</br>  <br> Yes, we are. Maybe you'd want to lurk more before spouting redundant crap. <br><br>No.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Samefag<br><br>Stop being so upset anon, it's a chinese cartoon</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the cancer, anon. Fuck off with your best girl bait.<br><br><br>Does it really fucking matter? Very soon, it'll become the 'reading FT w/o food meme'.<br><br>So just fuck off &amp; stop contaminating this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2 same opinions <br> samefagging <br>Fuck off, summer.</br></br></br>  <br> reading FT w/o food meme <br> the meme is reading fairy tail with food <br><br>Don't cut yourself on that edge, boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Literal cancer. Fuck off samefag.</br></br></br></br></br>  Great, the thread become shit because some fag.  <br>Why are you so confrontational, anon? Did something happen in your life to upset you? Are you having a bad day?<br><br>We're all having a good time in this thread, there's no need to be telling everyone to fuck off over such small, insignificant things</br></br></br>  <br>lmao xd</br>  <br>hell during the election it self there were hints of Erina changing her mind about him, always showing up for his matches, also showing interest or at least intrigue in his "loosing is winning" ideals when ishiki pointed out to her that even when he looses he manages to learn and grow and never sees it as just loosing.<br><br>that will probably play a big part for her when she eventually loses to him or to some one else, and its souma who helps her understand that its not the end of the world, etc.<br><br><br>so yeah, slow cooked roasts are the best and we are starting to see the results.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like he doesn't realise it's obvious he's samefagging by saying fuck off in every post and being standoffish<br><br>Probably a mehgoomyfag feeling vulnerable after the chapter</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rindoufags due to their delusion. Erinafags can get annoying bringing up Megumi every damn time but hey, they have a leg to stand on compared to Rindoufags who, since her introduction, are already hyping up to be the winner of the Somabowl because they think she was interested in him in that one panel that doesn't even look like she's looking directly at him. She could be seeing at Kuga for all we know. That and they start cooking up greentext fanfiction of a heartfelt Shokugeki between her and Soma where Soma trades his entire victory for her or some shit. <br><br>It has died down though so thank god for that. Erinafags are now climbing out now that she's getting more screentime so they have to gloat. I ponder what the threads will be like when Rindou comes into play.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish there was an alumna or teacher who focuses on dairy, and of course she would have cowtits.</br>  <br>Yeah but that doesn't necessarily translate to what we're seeing with Erina right now. What we're witnessing now is more of 'defrosting', rather than 'simmering'.<br><br>Who knows? We'd just have to wait &amp; see what happens after this festival, &amp; before the school year comes to a close.</br></br></br>  <br>Where is this smile from?</br>  <br> Rindou never comes into play </br>  <br> people are talking about characters with big involvement in the current arc <br> <br>no shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I think that was just one guy, most Rindoufags think she's Souma's cousin or something.</br>  <br> that will probably play a big part for her when she eventually loses to him or to some one else, and its souma who helps her understand that its not the end of the world, etc. <br><br>I doubt Soma will be the one who will beat her. It has to be someone despicable that readers can't get behind. Eizan does have that going for him and I can imagine him stomping her so much that it'll break her leading to her losing everything eventually going into a healing/inspirational character arc (maybe her getting involved with the PSD crew.) Then going back to beating him but with a different flair about her.<br><br>I dunno, anything can go really but Soma vs Erina feels like an endgame thing and I feel when we get to that point that's when the two have finally revitalized their craft as cooks when they go in that fateful shokugeki. What they'll throw down in the line, that's up to Tsukuda.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thoughr those people were joking</br>  <br>No idea anon, just got them from another thread.<br>not sure if they are random sketches from the cooking book, or the side novels things.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck do people jump to rindou winning the soumabowl? At best she's going to be a small flirtatious ally that turns out to have more sinister alter motives to help soma based on what her character archetype looks like.</br>  <br>Not one guy, but quite a substantial number of anons. You can't look past the color of her hair &amp; eyes, &amp; the apparent interest she showed in Souma. Tsukuda's definitely cock-teasing the readers with her. <br><br>And voila! She doesn't appear in the rankings. Tsukuda has some big plans for her, the way things are going.</br></br></br>  <br>I want Isshiki to rape her in a shokugeki, then force her to live in the dorm. Hisako follows.<br>Alice, seeing this, decides to follow Erina to the dorm, with Kurokiba.<br>Then Jun, seen all of Akira's friends are in the dorm, forces him to go there.<br>Takumi, feeling left out since all of Souma's rivals are there, decides to move too.<br><br>Perfect domino effect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's pretty <br> They like her <br> They self insert into Souma <br><br>Gee, I don't know why they'd want her to win the soumabowl either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep posting them anon. I need more Erina's smiles.</br>  <br> every garbage harem anime ever </br>  <br>I want to protect that smile</br>  <br>Delusional aren't a reason they're an excuse.</br>  <br>Do people actually think that she's going to win? Has she even ever said anything?</br>  <br>Happy Aldinis are a miracle of the universe.</br>  How would a redemption arc for Takumi go at this point? It seems rather lame that it seems to boil down to a predictable Soma vs Takumi fight that we know Takumi will win in. Then again, I suppose in shounen manga we can always expect something like that. I'm just a little bothered that it would feel like Soma will make Takumi win or some shit for his Mezza-Luna.<br><br>Taking it away from Giganigga would be a more satisfying redemption for Takumi and not let that be the backdrop of his inevitable shokugeki with Soma.</br></br>  Don't forget to praise Aldini bros with their first place.    <br>I expect him to beat a formidable opponent and have Souma give him back his mezzluna and tell him he earned it, and he doesn't want to face him when he doesn't have signature knife or something like that.</br>  <br>I mean there's just one guy I've seen seriously pushing for Soumabowl as a "first love" kind of thing, while the cousin theory is more popular.</br>  <br><br>No, anon, you see, this panel clearly shows she's interested in him. Just look closer. Don't be blind, bro she's totally into him.</br></br>  <br> she's totally into him <br> she can't be looking at him because of the retardations he says </br></br>  <br>tosh should go easy on her clothes. They look uncomfortable.</br>  <br><br>or because they are both of the Saiba bloodline.</br></br>  What if he's selling his food to all the cooks after the day is done?  <br><br>Was it ever mentioned why he took up Yukihira? I can't recall.</br></br>  <br>doki doki</br>  <br>No, but it seems obvious. He didn't want famous people showing up and badgering him when he was just trying to run a normal diner.</br>  <br>famous food people, I mean.</br>    <br>God, i like spirals pupils s much.</br>  Anime sure likes to hype Takumi.   All these shipperfaggot <br> Souman literally don't give a fuck about Love in a bit <br><br> ErinaJama will win SoumanBowl foe sure just you wait, you shit head retard. Hail ErinaJama, She is truly best girl. <br>She's literally a rival.<br><br> MuhMehgloomy~ will win a SoumaBowl just you wait you masochism ErinaFag. Oh, and Muh Meh-chan is best girl, remember that faggot. <br>She's just a good friend.<br><br> Rindou-Nee best girl and will win a SoumanD for sure, EirinaBitch and Mehgloomy's fag better fuck off <br>Literally has no word come out of her mouth yet, she's pretty much a background character right now. <br><br>Man, I hope the author just ship Souman off with somebody else or married off to some random girl or a side character like a childhood friend-chan in the end so that these faggot will shut the fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's literally a rival. <br>And the main heroine, the two are not mutually exclusive, retard.</br></br>  <br>You fake neutral faggots are worse than all of them.</br>  <br> romance is foreshadowed and set up to be a major theme multiple times <br> hurr it doesn't matter <br>You're a dumb idiot.</br></br></br>  <br>Fake neutral is a thing? Not him but I genuinely don't give a shit when the protag is borderline asexual and doesn't even show interest. Seems fucking boring.</br>  <br>Right now, she's nothing more than that.<br><br><br>  fake neutral faggots <br>Sorry for not being a shipper or a retard like you.</br></br></br></br></br>  Look at all these angry shipperfags.    <br>wait, if it's summer in that pic, why isn't isami in slim mode</br>  <br>Did not said it does not matter but as of now dude just don't give a fuck about it.</br>    <br>i want to give erina some good NTR manga to read. <br><br>Do you think she may like velvet kiss</br></br></br>  <br><br>The anon is somewhat true, SnS is not even tagged as romance just plain slice of life cooking, It's like every anime /a/ straight away rants about waifu wars</br></br>      <br> just plain slice of life <br>For some reason it doesn't feel like slice of life at all. I hate SoL but love SnS (probably because I'm fan of battle shonens).</br></br>  <br> SnS <br> slice of life <br>Jesus Christ who tags these.</br></br></br>  <br>You're somewhat fucking retarded.<br><br>Romance was introduced as a main theme in chapter 2.<br><br>Secondary ignorant fag please go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's got a bit of slice of life with things like the Polar Star hijinks and the karaage and cooking school arcs. They're mostly used as a breather between major arcs though.</br></br>  Is /a/ the only board that likes Erina?  <br>Megumi isn't that stacked</br>  <br>Japan does too.</br>  <br><br>Megumi is all about the hips and ass anyway.</br></br>  <br>As a reader you may find him attractive that doesn't mean he is in-world. It makes sense he is the opposite of Alice in both cooking and looks.</br>  <br>Fucking fanservice shit.<br><br>Megumi will never ever wear that in-universe.</br></br></br>  <br>I am starting to see the light with this ship. I might do the same too.</br>  <br>Only normalfag beta hate erina.</br>  <br>Only bata cucks like you love Erina.</br>  <br>It's from a extra chapter.<br>http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd/<br>It's on Batoto too.</br></br></br>  <br><br> beta <br> cuck <br>So yeah, you two fags can fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  Romance was definitely introduced as a theme, but it's not the focus. I like how the relationships between characters have developed so far, it is a very slow approach, other than Souma and Megumi who were constantly a duo early in the series. With most series I get impatient with romantic developments because the hints are too strong (to the point where you just want it to be over) but with this series, there's just slow relationship development here and there.<br><br>I think it's pretty obvious that an Erina ending is planned for the series. However, Megumi is a sweet girl. Alice is really fun. Meat needs a bit more depth but isn't terrible. Yuki is my favorite but will be forever a side character. People need to stop being mean. The girls are all good in their own ways.</br></br>  <br>I like these two so much. I want more friendly moments between them (like that side chapter where they hang out with Meat).<br><br><br>Meat outfit looks weird, what is it supposed to be?</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that we will never find out what this was.  <br>Its Kaido.</br>  <br>It was just some shit in the background to make the whole scene look creepier, nothing more nothing less</br>  Blackbeard is the literal definition of edgy<br><br>He was treated like shit like a kid and now he wants to kill innocents with his earthquake powers because he's butthurt about being a fat piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>nah, you just have no clue how to use buzzwords correctly</br>  <br> an eternally smiling guy who talks about dreams <br> edgy </br></br>  <br>the florian triangle monster was around for hundreds of years before Kaido</br>  <br>Correction.

Also she looks like shit with long hair. <br><br>But Nami is old and busted anyway and the next girl to join will be the new hotness</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But she still is, before FI, during FI, during PH and just before the Sanjihats where last seen. Are you fucks even reading this manga?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127868493 <br><br>what about those weather wizards?<br><br>Even if you're suggesting shes weak. We've not seen her fight properly yet, but we will soon once we catch up with sanji et al</br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br> Also she looks like shit with long hair. <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Rebecca will join and many people hate her already.</br>  <br>this was just to show how vast the One Piece world is.</br>  <br><br>please, just stop trying</br></br>  <br>Robin beats her out now because of her jew greed</br>  <br>Why should she join? What is her dream? What does she wants to find?</br>  <br> I don't understand Nami's new design <br>It's okay. Just come out and say it. Fuck you probably don't understand most of the reasons behind the timeskip redesigns</br></br>    <br>clothes<br>and a place to be useful</br></br>   there are literally people who say her new design looks shit <br>Nostalgiafags and queers have shit taste and are as cancerous as always</br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br> good design <br>Tell us more about your shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br>just let them be and let them whine about losing their boobless, short-haired stick-girl forever</br>  At least we can all agree that Brook is useless  <br> implying there's a deep reason for any of them beside Luffy's vest getting longer <br>Please stop. Oda only wanted Nami to look like a slut..</br></br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br>She had them since Skypia though. Someone post that one comparison pic please.</br></br>  <br> saved Nami &amp; Co from dying by beating Jora <br> saved Zoro &amp; Co from being shot while vulnarable and being easy targets at the lake in PH <br>nope</br></br></br>  <br>Is there a resin for luffy's vest getting longer? Really?</br>  <br> to look like a slut <br> look <br><br>Nami is a slut. It's one of the few cases in anime when you can't call her a slut to just to insult her, that's exactly what she is.<br><br>Nami doesn't feel romantic love for anyone, she would sell her body to fat old men just to have some money</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*reason</br>  <br>Nice head canon you got there.</br>  <br><br>You shouldnt use the figurine as a critique of her design<br><br> 0 gravity tits <br> 0 gravity neck </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She flashed people for money and as a kid offered to pay for things with her body. That's pretty slutty.</br>  <br>Those pirates who took on Arlong Park?<br>A bunch of kids. Kid's with promise but kids all the same.<br><br>The pirates who left Sabaody and took on the New Fishmen Pirates? A crew fit for the Pirate King. Designs that imply determination and confidence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is supposed to be on a journey from an ordinary boy to a pirate. So along the course of the series, his clothes will become more and more piratey. Longer jacket, sash, pants, boots, tricorn hat, and probably, by the end of the series, the famed eyepatch.<br>On pic related you can clearly see Oda wasn't quite sure at first of exactly how much more piratey Luffy should be after the timeskip. He made multiple variations and settled for the tamest one.</br></br>  <br> Implying any redesign happens for any reason other than to sell more merchandise </br>  <br>Here. The tits are literally the same size.</br>  <br>Entities which lurked the Florian Triangle long before Moriah arrived, and were the cause of the ships disappearing within. Whatever they are, they absolutely dwarf the likes of Oars/Sanjuan Wolf, as well as Thriller Bark itself which is probably similar size to Dressrosa.</br>  <br>my brain. it hurts.<br><br>how can anyone that has followed One Piece this far be so fucking dense??<br><br>Awesome  gets it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We saw Bonney just before Dressrosa started, eating pizza and reading the newspaper about Law and Luffy's alliance.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127869131 <br>long hair makes every woman a lot prettier</br>  <br>That's neat, I like it. I hope by the end of the journey he'll get a coat to, in strong world was amazing</br>  <br>To slowly weaken Blackbeard's forces from the inside, or use Blackbeard's additional force to make his task of taking out the remaining 6th level prisoners in the world somewhat easier.</br>  <br> post-skip Namis tits are a lot bigger than pre-skip <br>Another myth busted, nice</br></br>  So Im on episode 7, when does this show start to get better? This begging is weak, but there have been cool moments.  <br>My favourite was "Why doesn't Zoro smile anymore?!"</br>  <br>A few arcs in.<br><br>Some will say during Kuro, some will say during Baratie. If your not in by the end of Arlong Park then you wont be at all</br></br></br>  <br>People who hate on post-ts Nami are mostly tumblrinas who hate the fact that her outfit is more revealing because of muh sexism</br>  <br>After the dressrosa arc</br>  <br>Read it.</br>  <br>Stop watching the anime and read the manga, its for your own good</br>  <br><br>Why lads?</br></br>  <br> back facing one of Luffy <br> it's the pirate symbol he drew for the flag <br>I hope he has that shirt lying around.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda isn't exactly consistent when it comes to breast size.</br>  <br>Fight me irl faggot</br>  <br>Around episode 300 the pacing gets utterly horrible and a bit later the drawings and animation are extremely low budget most of the time</br>  <br>Quality's better, less filler and around episode 300-400 the pacing drops to the floor.<br>It's basically a slideshow now.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OF0<wbr>MZ6FH67g</wbr>  [ ]<br>Shouldn't be many spoilers (if at all).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The manga is the original material, you dont have to put up with shit animation, shit art and filler.<br><br>Same reason in you wanted to judge a sng you'd listen to the original version, not a version produced by underpaid sweatshop animators.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook has actually been useful in every arc since he joined. It was just not as spectacular as some stuff other chracters did.</br>  <br>I want more badass Brook moments</br>  <br>You can read the first 700 chapters in glorious color on Batoto</br>  <br><br>But the anime has a God Tier OST<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sYK<wbr>owP0WEIc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then listen to it while reading the manga.</br>  <br>Already complaining 7 eps in? You should be hooked by now.</br>  <br>He still gets them some times. More for sure though.</br>  <br><br>Well get used to it because you're going to hear a lot of it while background characters gasp and tremble for 5 seconds to every line from the manga</br></br>  <br>Its okay I guess, Luffy is a mad cunt which regularly destroys my sides.</br>  why doesn't his power also knock out all his opponents? wouldn't his fruit technically slow all blood circulation?  <br>Have you encountered our Lord and Saviour Buggy-sama yet?</br>  <br> Luffy is a mad cunt <br><br>You don't even know.</br></br></br>  <br>Magic nigga.<br>How is Luffy alive when he's made of rubber?</br></br>  <br>Buggy just got rekt for fucking with the hat, also a side terminator.</br>  <br>Zoro's dimple is so kawaii</br>  <br> no captain's coat for Luffy post TS <br>That bummed me out a little.</br></br>  So by know we've all realized that Kaido isn't human<br>What animal is he and what fruit does he have?</br>  <br> What animal is he and what fruit does he have? <br>It really is still anyone's guess.<br>You'll get nothing but wild speculation.<br><br>Anyone who claims near certainty on this issue is a fool.</br></br></br></br></br>  I bet Drake will end up in alliance with Law and Luffy as a thanks for defeating Doflamingo, who he probably hates a lot more than he admits.<br>(Oda wouldn't place him in Law's flashback for no reason.)</br>  <br>He's a human with a zoan who prefers to remain in his hybrid form, thus being called a "beast/creature". I don't believe that was his silhouette we saw this chapter.</br>   Works for Mam now <br>Goddamn it I had hopes for him.<br><br>What's left for Drake &amp; Capone now they've both sold out.</br></br></br>  <br>He seems perfectly content working under Kaido though.</br>  <br>It doesn seem very strange he doesn't have a grudge against Doffy...unless his father was an asshole.</br>  <br>He's one of the few recurring "villains".<br>You'll start loving his shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait until he's revealed and there's suddenly a wave of:<br> I knew that <br> It was so obvious <br> You'd have to be a retard to think otherwise <br> Really obvious there Oda, getting lazy are you? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> well-designed <br>yes<br> interesting <br>meh<br> useful <br>not yet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't seem to like Barrels much though; he even ditched him before he died.</br>  <br><br>Just makes the eventual payoff sweeter</br></br>  <br> Works for Mam now <br><br>Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br>All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> concerned <br>*confirmed, obviously</br></br>  <br>I hate retards like you.</br>  <br>She's the navigator, they'd be dead several times over without her. <br><br>I agree her design is shit now, her boobs may not have gotten bigger but she shows them way more so they appear that way. Completely removes the uniqueness of her character. Same with Robin in my opinion, both their new hairstyles turned Robin (my favourite character) to below Zoro and Luffy, and Nami who I appreciated for being Nami not looks like a random slut. Fucking hate it. Oh well, at least Franky got a badass Robot.</br></br></br>  <br>Aw, how cute. <br>I hate shitposters like you too.  ;^) </br></br>  So Urouge met Enel right?  <br>Was Arlong Park the last time Nami had a proper clothes?</br>  <br>Enel is probably still on the moon. If he were to come back though, I see him going down to the blue sea.<br><br>Perhaps this is how he's reintroduced through. I just can't see him being "rational" and wanting to meet someone in such a way.</br></br></br>  <br>It's this guy.</br>  <br>What makes you think he's wanting to meet someone?<br>They said somebody's here not somebody wants to meet you</br></br>  <br>I don't remember having problems with her until post-time skip, but now that I think about it she was probably wearing a bra after most of Arlong yeah. What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service?? I assure you, Nami's breasts aren't what I'm fucking watching it for.</br>  <br>Oh right, I must have read it with someone being there to see them.</br>  <br> google image search <br> Nami water 7 <br> Nami enies lobby <br> Nami sabaody <br> all have shirts on </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>interesting idea<br>proof?</br></br>  <br>Probably stems from the fact he has wings and is likely from the sky islands (or has some angel zoan).</br>  <br>Blackbeard's crew is after pirates for their powers and Lafitte has shown to have the ability to fly.<br>Urouge in particular has a power to convert damage into power. Since he's a Skypeian, Lafitte is the only one able to track him reliably.</br></br>  <br> is likely from the sky islands <br><br>Wasnt he a cop in some blue? And those wings dont look like those stubby little things sky islanders have on their back, even the ones on the moon hieroglyphs in the cover story had different wings.<br>It has to be a DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br> All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar. <br><br> he's after Ceasar on his own <br> doesn't work for Mam at all <br> wants to make a killing on the black market with Ceasar's drugs and other shit <br> Capone has gone full Broker during the timeskip <br> Wants to be the kingpin of the underworld, harking back to his namesake <br><br>Holy fucking shit please god yes.<br>I believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Luffy has been in the New World for 3 FUCKING DAYS and he already captured the second most famous scientist in the world, defeated a Shichibukai an one of the most influential person in the New World, formed alliance with countless rookies and managed to piss off the whole fucking world<br><br>Why haven't you accepted Luffy as your lord and saviour</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Lafitte already has a devil fruit and it's Rosinante's. He was able to enter a room with VA's and Shichibukai's without any of them noticing after all.</br>  <br>Just because he lived there doesn't mean he's from there.</br>  <br>Luffy becoming Pirate King in two weeks confirmed.</br>  <br>Not sure, seems like Oda has something in store for him though.<br><br>What worries me more now is Bonney.<br>She's stealing food in the street like a homeless person...she's still pirate right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, pirates do steal shit.</br>  <br>He's also declared War on two yonkou, basically.<br><br>I love Luffy sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably on the run from the marines.</br>  <br>Oda sent a skypeian to a lightning island<br><br>It has to be enel</br></br></br>  <br>It slows the rate their bodies use oxygen and nutrition as well.</br>   Apoo/Hawkins/Kidd confirmed ded   Guesses on why Shanks? Will luffy stop this if he learns i wonder  <br>I'm sure he will.<br><br>Not that Luffy would want to protect Shanks.<br>More that Luffy would consider Shanks "his to beat".<br><br>Either way this sets up the Kidd/Hawkins/Apoo alliance is official Strawhat enemies now.<br>Things could get fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who was Ace's first mate before he joined WB pirates  <br> Guesses on why Shanks? <br><br>they probably think he's the most calm and laid back while the other threes are out of their fucking minds. I guess they really didn't think that through if that's their reasoning.<br><br>Luffy knows Shanks can handle it by himself, but I'm sure he would get against Kidd and co because he wants to defeat Shanks himself and cannot allow them to try before him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Same hair, scar and lost an arm <br>Daddy issues obviously</br></br>  <br>It's unconfirmed, but I actually think Urogue might be Birkan like Enel. That's make things more interesting if he went down to the blue sea before Enel blew Birka out of existence.</br>  <br>Why does everyone forget Killer?<br><br>Also, I wonder if Shanks laughed at Kid?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because messing with Shanks would piss off less people than in comparison to Kaidou and Big Mom. Big Mom and Kaidou probably have more allies and connections in the new world than Shanks does.</br>  <br>Poor killer, can never eat meat.</br>  <br>These are really cool looking. Got any other images depicting the other crew members with different TS designs?</br>  yfw shanks convinces apoo/basil/Kidd to join him on an alliance to take out Blackbeard, the remnants of the WB pirates are also in it too  <br> kidd and the others arrive to shanks and decide to go full out on him <br> yfw he doesn't even move and simply releases his conqueror's haki power to bring them to their knees <br><br>it's unlikely because Kidd, Hawkins and co would seem like total retards but god it would be great</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br>Lucky Roo is gonna blow Kidd's brains out and kill every single supernova crew member by himself.<br><br>Lucky Roo ain't a nice guy and extremely brutal and efficient,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard is so hot right now.<br>Shanks called this years ago so I can see him marshaling forces against him.<br><br>Then again, I think all the yonkou save BB will fall.<br>New era and all that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Big Mom was having a sea battle with Urouge and Capone.<br>Urouge went in the clouds that just happen to be a sky island to recup.<br>Then Sanji gave Caesar to big mom and talked to Capone to tell him he wants his help getting Caesar back.<br>And he's now in the sky getting Urouge to help him.<br><br><br>So basically it's Sanji that's in the clouds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>would be too powerlevely</br>  <br><br>Blackbeard is a literal pirate. He's in it for booty, plunder and fun, unlike pretty much anyone else in the cast.</br></br>  <br>That is a lot of stuff to happen offscreen.</br>  <br>He's not a captain.</br>  <br> Sanji jobbed and has to ask side characters solve his issues. <br><br>Believable.</br></br></br>  <br>He's in it for dreams.</br>  <br>Neither is Zoro, but they're both Supernovas who are more powerful than Urouge, Bonney and Capone.</br>  <br>Enies Lobby Nami barely had a shirt on. Remember how she changed into her "bra uniform" on the train.</br>  Luffy didn't get involved when he heard Ace got rekt.<br>He did want to get involved once the marines announced they were going to kill him.<br><br>So it's going to be the same with Shanks. He's gonna be like meh it's his problem until BB shows up rapes the kidhawpoo alliance and kidnaps shanks takes him to Raftel to execute him and videosnails his execution to the world. Until Luffy shows up and shit.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll get a flashback that shows it all eventually.</br>  will sanji defeat big mum?  <br>Had a vest on though iirc.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't hit women. He'll beat the shit out of her crew though.</br>  <br>yeah but the alliance is named after the captains. If Kid/Apoo/Hawkins go down it means Killer is going down too because he's part of Kid's crew.</br>  <br>Yes, the guy who had his leg almost broken by Vergo and got fodderized by Doflamingo will defeat a fucking Emperor, you fucking retard</br>  <br><br>This is true.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> Next weeks big reveal is Sanji in the clouds <br><br>I'd be okay with that. He'd finally get a chance to do something.</br></br></br>  <br>My point is that if you're listing supernovas, you can't exclude Killer and Zoro because they are also two of the eleven.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>he wasn't using his full power</br>  So what's so fucked up with killer's face that he has to wear a mask all the time. I mean it would be hard as fuck to eat spaghetti through small holes in a mask and nobody would go through that if they didn't need to.  <br>Oh damn. A vest?! Well nevermind then.</br>  <br>We are 100% going to find out what it was, Oda always delivers</br>  <br>He's Shiki's son so he has to keep the mask on to remain anonymous.</br>  <br>Point is that Sanji was going to die if Law didn't save his ass</br>  its good that oda is bringing all the supernovas back. best characters  <br> What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service? <br>Nothing about Namis personality changed, she is still the same character she always was. People like you seem to miss that since you focus too much on her tits and clothing now.</br></br>  <br>If you take it off he'll die.</br>  <br>It's his plot armor</br>  <br>Would it be extremely painful?</br>  <br>Doffy was just caught him off guard. He'</br>  <br>you don't get to bitch about characters going to shit after their introduction when they are in the same series as sanji</br>  <br>gtfo tumblr fag</br>  Did Luffy just forget about Sabo?<br>So far for Oda's masterful planning.</br>  <br>Sabo was dead.</br>  <br>he thought sabo is dead</br>  <br>no, you are just retarded</br>  <br>I don't use tumblr</br>  <br><br><br>forgot about that, nvm</br></br></br>  Duffy said that he wanted 10 members to join his crew<br><br>So far we have 8 and Jinbei is pretty much confirmed.<br><br>I guess the last member will be another girl? What do you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I hate it when every girl is NEXT STRAWHAT NEXT STRAWHAT CONFIRMED GUYS GONNA JOIN.</br>  <br>I think another female is pretty much guaranteed.The twist will be that she will be almost as retarded as Luffy and will often hang out with Chopper and Usopp instead of Nami and Robin.</br>  <br>The anime is fine for at least half of the series but yes it gets like this eventually.</br>  <br>I honestly hope it's Rebecca. Her little sister dynamic with Robin is cute.</br>  <br><br>I'm hoping Koala. She could be the bridge to the revolution army or something.</br></br>  <br>If it's Rebecca I'll stop reading One Piece. She ruined Dressrosa, she would ruin the rest of the manga. <br><br>I would thank Oda for the creation of great arcs and emotional moments but I would just fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Violet, or as another anon mentions from time to time, a fox woman from wano.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>This is what I'm talking about.<br>None of these characters are interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anyway, it was weird that he wasn't even mentioned once (like luffy saying: "i don't want to lose another brother". I think the chapter about the childhood should have been before marine ford.</br>  <br> Violet isn't interesting <br> A dancer to go with Brook's music <br> An amazing lookout, better than Usopp could ever hope to be <br> somewhat useful in a fight <br>Probably the most useful "new nakama" from this arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>barto is much more fun though</br>  <br><br> Koala <br> not interesting <br><br>Yeah man, you're opinion is shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>god please no</br>  <br>What use is he for the crew other than a cabin boy and some defense from cannon fire (which they do well enough on their own)?</br>  <br>yeah i think he's better as a allied crew or division captain instead of actual crewmember</br>  <br>Likely. I don't get why people are against a beautiful lady swordsman with meat. They really don't pay attention to God Usopp's wisdom. Case in point:<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He tried on the mask and then it stuck. Or maybe the tan-line embarrasses him.<br><br>The real mystery is how he got so big and muscley on a diet of pasta.</br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe his face is disgusting? that could make anybody appetite to lose.</br>   yfw luffy will die at the end of the last battle,and will never live in the new world that will be created   <br>This dumb deserve that .</br>  <br>He's not dumb, he's the literal definition of a superhuman. He declared war on the entire world and survived</br>  <br>Maybe he could take it off, but he just never thinks of it.</br>  <br>What the fuck did you say?</br>  <br>This is why I think Blackbeard is gonna win in the end. Or at the very least, he will die with the title of "King of Pirates"<br> Blackbeard is a famous pirate name, not Luffy or Monkey <br> Blackbeard's attitude "influences" the way future pirates act (ie. like a typical real world pirate) </br></br></br>  <br>If anything Sanji caught Doffy off gaurd, flying in out of nowhere to kick him in mid air.</br>  <br>Man Doffy was so based from the moment he flew through the clouds. Cant believe he lost to a simple punch. Felt alot like the shitty Soul Eater anime ending.</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that literal though.<br><br>The real Blackbeard was killed by a guy named Maynard.<br>I don't see that happening in OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cant believe he lost to a simple punch <br><br>Did you actually read the fight? He got his insides roasted by Red Hawk, his organs destroyed by gamma knife, and still managed to keep up and was going to win if the Gladiators didn't protect Luffy</br></br></br>  <br>that's what I'd like too but we both know it's not going to happen.</br>  <br> Nami drinking too much <br> zoro passed out <br>they had sex</br></br></br>  He seemed legit mad at the gorosei for making a fool of him.<br>How will he respond to the dragon's treachery?<br><br>What's he gonna do with Fujitora? <br>Yell at him some more?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope he chases Fuji down and beats the everliving shit out of him. Poor Sakazuki.</br>  <br>None of them read the manga. They're too stupid to comprehend anything, look at their grammar and you'll see.</br>  <br> She ruined Dressrosa <br>stop being autistic</br></br>  <br>Nah, Kaido is just a faggot with a Sea King Zoan</br>   Good odds Sanji &amp; Co are now facing down fellow supernova Capone Bege's crew along with Mam's <br><br>They're gonna need help.<br><br>Who's gonna give it to them?<br>Law's crew?<br>Jinbei?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Captain Buggy </br>  <br>Based Uncle, of course. Why else does he have that Poneglyph?</br>  <br>Shadows from a random sky island. Just like Wiper's and Luffy's shadows.</br>  Doflamingo is the glasses.<br><br>Vegapunk made them eat the Ito Ito no Mi.</br></br>  <br> even Sogeking <br>Nice play, but take away your fake chapter page, m8!</br></br>  <br> Laboon is Kaido </br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br>She always had big tits.</br></br>  <br>as retarded as it might sound it's not as stupid as some theories regarding sabo that came up in the past two years</br>  <br>interesting</br>  <br>Would be great. Too bad Doffy changed his glasses many times.</br>  <br>Come on man, you can't deny that Nami's chest started out at a more reasonable size<br> in b4 people say that she was just naturally growing as time progressed <br>I know it's just Oda's art style changing but all of his women characters just seem to get bigger and bigger breasts as the series progresses.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo is a complete asshole.<br>If the promise that they made with Ace and Luffy was the reason of why he didn't go to Marineford, I can accept it.<br>But that fucking asshole threw that promise away when he stated to Fuji, regardless his position he will always be at Luffy's side if it's needed.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>then stop posting shitty and ugly tumblr fanart is it that hard, holy shit</br></br></br>  Who's ready for this bad motherfucker to join and be on more cover pages?  <br>I don't want to deny and of course they are bigger now. But be honest she had pretty good tits before too. Just look back Arabasta or even earlier.<br>We saw those tits' shape in her jumper too.<br><br>I know it's hard to belive that they naurally grew during timeskip due Nami's age, but it isn't inpossible.<br><br><br>Same with Tashigi. I really dislike the dum theory that she gave birth to a child duting ts, thats why her breasts grew and that's why she's so great mother figure for PH's giant kids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's not goofy enough<br><br>even zoro looks silly when he's pissed off</br></br></br>  <br>That's not really hard when you have Plot-armor ,and that's why he suck , luffy can do anything he wants , he'll never be punished for his action . This is a generic shounen MC , boring and immortal.</br>  Why did it have to end like that? I just finished re-watching this anime, and it could've been one of my favorite, if only they ended it the way the author wanted it to end. <br><br>Fuck it, I'm so pissed</br></br>  <br>Blame nekofags.</br>  <br>I blame everyone</br>  <br>You have to appreciate how terrible the anime's ending is. Much like Nisekoi, it somehow manages to piss everyone off no matter which girl you like. The emotional response intended to be elicited isn't happiness or adoration, rather anger. If you look at it that way, it is actually an incredible work of art. Like a comedy, but with anger instead of laughter.</br>  <br>At least you're not the only one who felt like that.<br><br>Also Ayase is the miracle of the universe</br></br></br>  <br>so its good because of how bad it is? makes sense.</br>  Should have been like yoauga no sora where every girl got a chance to win.  <br>Basically, yeah. Being butthurt is fun sometimes.</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br>I don't mind Kirino winning, I mind the fact they broke up after the marriage, so fucking stupid.</br>  <br>Nah, just nekofags. The anime was shit because of them.</br>  <br>That's not what they did, anon.<br><br>You are stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this</br>  There was implied Lewdness between them<br>In fact its even implied that after the series finishes the might even   Hold hands  </br>  Is this a Kirino thread? Or just a good ol' bitching thread?  Play the VN then  <br>And the fact that they fucked on Christmas.</br>  <br>They both probably didn't even know what they were doing. Kyousuke likely lasted only 30 secs. It doesn't even count.</br>  <br> it could've been one of my favorite <br>when you're this shit you've really got no right to blame anyone but yourself for your disappointment</br></br>  thats why i havent even watched this show  <br> Hasn't watched one of the greatest love stories ever told. <br>You're missing out on life.</br></br>  They ended together but then they said they were going to break up after a year or some bullshit like that, right?  <br>You should read the LN for that. Then if you really want you can watch the anime to see Kirino being cute when she gets something she ordered online.<br><br>They got together until graduation, broke up, and then got back together. The anime did a horrible job of showing that they got back together.</br></br></br>  <br> again thread this <br><br>Pastebin the read</br></br></br>  <br>Heh.</br>  <br> only watches the anime <br> blames the author <br><br>Secondary logic</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nisekoi ain't over though anon.</br>  <br>I want to lick Kirno thighs</br>  <br>I'd be happy to just be between them. The smell  Pre-Kyousuke fucking her  would be amazing.</br>  <br>I loved how Kyousuke instinctively protected her from hurting her head in that part in the LN.</br>  <br>Anime just made it a dumb MISUNDERSTANDING scene for the sake of pandering.</br>  I bet she's breeding with her brother every day.<br><br>They probably have their 5th child by now.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad I only read the LN then. Maybe someday I'll get the nerve to swallow it.</br>  <br>I'm gonna be completely honest: I loved her panties in that scene.</br>  <br>I'd watch it just so you can better participate in the discussions. No matter how bad the anime is, you'll always have the LNs that gave you your permanent knowledge of the series.</br>  <br>The only thing this show has done is make quality doujins.</br>  <br>Between the lovey dovey incest ones and the horrible rape and mind break doujins?</br>  <br>Most of the stuff by Hyocorou, and Takuji.</br>  <br>Henkuma's yandere Ayase is solid too.</br>  Kirino is a miracle of the universe.<br><br>Also, please do not sexualize Kirino. Thank you.</br></br>  Kirino is still the best imouto.    <br>Kirino was made to be sexualized.</br>  <br>If the anime staff had any sort of integrity, the scene would have been handled like that.</br>  <br>No. Kirino was made to be loved and protected by her onii-chan.</br>  <br>And sexualized.</br>  <br>Kuroneko date was the single best episode in this shitty anime.</br>  <br>You are literally the cancer that almost killed the anime.</br>  <br> almost </br>  <br>How does supporting best girl result in worst girl winning? You make no sense.</br>  <br>The anime staff were mostly nekofags that changed around things that had a negative impact on the series/anime. Nekofags also forced harem shit in the LNs cause they wanted their shitty cat to be more relevant.</br>  <br>It's awful, Kyousuke should've been on his way to plowing his sister after going to america and bringing her back.</br>  I want to marry her!  <br>I doubt it'd go easily even without the neko but yes. The detour was retarded. Even Ayase would have made more sense.<br><br><br>And Volume 5 was a mistake. It's almost all trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Improved Kirino.</br>  <br><br> They didn't </br></br>  <br>Because incest hurts the societal harmony of Japan.</br>  <br>Why any of you made an update of the seps, there was another 30 replies of it.</br>  <br>This. I haven't even watched this yet I've never masturbated more to a girl than Kirino.</br>  <br>A whore, in other words.</br>  Kuroneko should have been picked. End of story. Those who disagree have the right to their opinion, given it is a very very VERY wrong opinion.  <br>Funny, because this is one of the few times where "objectively wrong" actually applies. Keep being delusional though, it's quite amusing at times.</br>  <br> muh neko </br>  <br>The butthurt will never fade it seems.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/781149/853046<wbr>90eb/</wbr>  <br> yaoi  <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop pretending Kirino isn't a breeding girl, it's how her brother is using her every single day.</br></br>  <br>Are you Kyousuke? No? Then you are not allowed to sexualize her.</br>  <br>What if I fantasize about being Kyousuke while sexualizing her?</br>  <br>Anon, her purity is long gone, she already made 5 children by now and Kyousuke is pumping his penis into her every day.<br><br>And that's for the better.</br></br></br>  <br>You are allowed to fantasize but not to write about it here.<br><br><br>I'm pretty sure they would wait at least until Kyousuke finishes his studies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish this artist used his talents like this more often, adapting scenes that were omitted or mishandled in the anime. Instead of making those cringe-worthy, saccharine, 'what-if' scenarios featuring Kirino acting completely out of character.</br>  <br>They're not completely out of character and definitely not cringe-worthy.</br>  <br>Holy shit, this actually makes so much sense.</br>  <br>Kirino was never the shy, sickly-sweet demure girl portrayed in those comics. Not even in the last volume.<br><br>That's more like relationship Kuroneko.</br></br></br>  <br>I can see most of these scenes happening later in their relationship. Of course it's not canon and only focuses on her dere side but it's not completely unreasonable.</br>  <br>It's just too much dere for me to buy. <br>Even in the afterstory where it's implied they've been fucking Kirino is still insecure about showing her feelings toward Kyousuke.</br></br>  <br>True but she definitely develops towards being more dere and confident. Maybe you could see these comics as the end of that process. I just really enjoy them even if they're exaggerating her dere side, we did not get enough of that in the LNs.</br>  <br> Oreimo <br> not just fapping to Takuji and Hyocoroad works <br>Your loss.</br></br></br>  <br> we did not get enough of that in the LNs <br>And the occasional dere moments that were in the LN were mostly omitted from the anime. <br>Fucking nekofag scum. I'm still bitter that we'll never get a decent adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>A shame the manga is shit too. At least the 2 special episodes made it a little bit better.</br>  Is the ending any good in the visual novel (with Kirino)  <br>No part of the VN is good, unless one of the not-Kirinos is your waifu and you want to self insert.</br>  <br>This again?</br>  <br>So the Anime ending is shit, the manga ending is shit, the VN ending is shit, fuck it.</br>  <br>Gotta read the novels I guess.</br>  <br>As someone who muscled my way through all twelve, the novels are pretty god damned boring, if you're reading for Kirino / cat, be prepared for hundreds and hundreds of pages about side characters.</br>  i wonder if he ever got to feel those sister boobs  <br>Only when you don't care about anyone but your favorite character. I only disliked volume 5/8 for the Ruri romance and parts of volume 10 for the harem elements.</br>  <br>what about the ending.. is it any good?</br>  <br>And if you're hoping for hot imouto lovin, you're going to be disappointed.</br>  <br>This is pretty much the ending in visual form:<br/></br>  Brother sperm doesn't mix with sister eggs.  <br> I only disliked volume 5/8 for the Ruri romance and parts of volume 10 for the harem elements. <br> only <br>Ayase and Ruri were as far as I can say I'd tolerate. But how many other girls were there, that got full development? Like 4? 5? 6? I don't even remember their names. Book 11 is 90% flashbacks about some c character girl.<br><br>And, in addition to that, the plot development between Kirino and Kyouske is redundant to an extreme that pushes my limits. You can't say there wasn't alot of backtracking to justify rewriting the same development in a different way, to pad content and sell another book.<br><br>It was a good story. It needed to be god damn half as long, if that.<br><br><br>See<br><br>The ending isn't bad. But I was so burnt out on literally 1000+ pages of filler that I didn't really care. I just wanted it over with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They mix perfectly well, they were made for each other.</br>  <br> denial <br>I didn't want to love drinking tears, it's all your fault I enjoy them so much.</br></br>  <br> You can't say there wasn't alot of backtracking to justify rewriting the same development in a different way, to pad content and sell another book. <br>That was so frustrating. Every time you think their relationship has progressed and they've reached a new level of understanding and intimacy it just gets wiped back to square one and they go through it all again.<br><br>I don't understand how it could even be justified after Kyousuke flies to another country to retrieve Kirino while telling her that he'll die without her. <br><br>But then afterwards it's just back to normal as if nothing happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But that's wrong.</br>  <br>I disagree, the story clearly focused on the siblings and "full development for 4 5" characters is a huge exaggeration. Volume 11 is the most important one and is about Kirino/Kyousuke/Manami. There was not that much filler and it wasn't even boring.</br>  <br>Not him, but almost all of volume 5 was straight up filler. The series is full of boring Manami scenes. Saori's and Kanako's backstories felt pointless. Pointless flashback to Ayase and Kyousuke taking care of a baby for no reason. Probably even more that I can't recall.</br>  <br>Don't forget all that fucking mind numbing drool inducing filler with Serena, or whatever the Fujoshi's name was. <br><br><br>I might have exaggerated a little bit, but still. Holy shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also said I disliked volume 5, it's by far the most boring and useless one. 5 and 8 are the 2 worst volumes.</br>  The anime needed more of this imouto-master.<br><br>If they were going to include so much non-pertinent content, they could have at least went with the funny stuff.</br></br>  <br>Sena really was useless, at least the scenes with Akagi were hilarious, that glorious siscon bastard.</br>  <br>No it isn't. Kyousuke flying to America is one of the key turning points and Kirino is much less Tsun afterwards.</br>  <br> Ayase and Kyousuke taking care of a baby for no reason <br>You take that back, Ayase and Kyousuke would have been the cutest couple.</br></br>  <br>My memery might be affected by the fact that I watched the anime after reading the LN, which included none of the character development.</br>  <br>Read the after story<br><br>That's the true end.<br><br>They're still together, and Kirino/Kuroneko imply they've been fucking regularly</br></br></br></br></br>  People honestly expected Kuronkeo to win?<br><br>Did they even read the title of the show?</br></br>  <br> muh neko </br>  yea,i hope he accept kuroneko as his gf.stupid with Siscon!  <br>The problem with post-volume 5 is that the audience knows that Kyousuke and Kirino love each other but they don't realize it, accept it, or go for it themselves. It's a back and forth until they do and the progress seemingly looks like it stalls. It doesn't. It's just all internal.<br><br><br>Most of it came back to the siblings in some way. But yeah, it did have scenes that had no business existing. Most, if not all scenes with Kanako and Saori for example.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the title, it was obvious Kirino would win.<br><br>Just deal with the fact that they are fucking every day.</br></br></br>  <br>Please Anon, I must have this source ;_;</br>  <br>I wanted Kirino to win, the part of becoming normal siblings pissing me off</br>  <br>they are still dating, you really didn't pay attention to the ending, huh</br>  <br>It's really unclear, especially the anime ending. <br>I don't blame anyone for assuming it was a cop out where the siblings end their relationship.<br>Kyousuke even says it was only temporary in his final monologue, despite the fact that we're apparently supposed to interpret his actions differently.</br></br></br>  I want to fuck Kirino.  <br>No, she has quite a few moments like in those comics. Listening to her iPod with Kyousuke and falling asleep, walking him home from his entrance exams, going shopping with him on their Christmas date and picking out clothes.</br>  <br> That was so frustrating. Every time you think their relationship has progressed and they've reached a new level of understanding and intimacy it just gets wiped back to square one and they go through it all again. <br><br>You are too naive. That's what Kyousuke wants you to think, and he spins the story to convince you nothing has changed. If you pay attention, their relationship progresses significantly in every volume.</br></br></br>  Ayase best girl  <br>I don't remember him saying it was temporary. LN or anime.</br>  Best oreimo.  <br> palette swap <br> best anything </br></br>  <br>She is pretty much made for breeding</br>  <br>The ending of volume 11 from their meeting down to the last word is my favorite.<br><br> And so. <br> The story from three years ago between me and Sakurai finally came to an end. <br> On the other hand… my story with Kirino continues. <br> If I had to give it a title, um…… <br> Let's call it 'My little sister can't be this cute' — what do you guys think? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw I'll never live in an alternate universe where Oreimo is fujobait AND incest <br>I hate my life</br></br>  I find Kirino to be cute.<br>But she's not pure.</br>  Kirino is my waifu and I don't care who calls me an idiot for it.  <br>How the fuck am I supposed to react when someone has your waifu as their waifu?</br>  <br>We're at least 3 here, I personally don't care that much.</br>  Do you guys fight or get into arguments with other waifufags who have imouto waifus other than Kirino when they enter these threads?<br><br>Pic somewhat related. <br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't even happen that often in purely Oreimo related threads like this one.
