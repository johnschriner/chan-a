[ How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She can't really do that, she's not here physically after all, only in soul.  But my Yunocchi isn't a very technical person, that's for sure, but it's not like she's never used a computer! So Yuno would most likely ask for my help with anything technical around the house.      Makoto has a lot of technical stuff in his room like a TV, game consoles and a computer but he doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about it in general, maybe above average. His strong fields are physical activities after all.   deder than bread up in here   She could use it just fine.    I don't really think she would be especially savvy. She shouldn't have much problems with just using computers or other devices, but she rather wouldn't be able to repair them.   It's not the best time to start thread.        Mai doesn't use computers and the type of weapon she uses was invented in the Bronze Age. So it could be argued that she isn't particularly proficient with technology.    She's got skills, can do the best programming, especially vidya. Well if it gets a virus or something, she can help me too.  Pretty much.  It's 1:45 am here, i think i will sleep and post again later   And at least leaving one question: Do you have something in common with your waifu?          Does your waifu ever have sleepovers with her friends? What does she do in them or what do you imagine she'd do if she doesn't have any?  (Mai does appear to do so based on this image. From what we can see, she and her friends appear to be trying on cosmetics such as nailpolish, styling their hair differently and putting on different clothes.)    I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127107959  What is the point of this post?    He's an underage spammer/shitposter.   Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  (Mai as a teenager does appear to resemble her mother. She's never shown clearly but they both have long hair of the same color and hair antennae. Beyond that she doesn't have any siblings and no other relatives of her other than her parent are shown.)     Well, with all the high-tech gear she uses, I'm guessing either she built them herself or she at least knows how to maintain them.  That is, she's much more technically inclined than I could ever be.    She's ronerier than I am.          We both are introvert and we both enjoy romantic setting/activities, I guess.   I dunno, she would probably just do usual activities in them like talking, having fun by styling each other hair.  She would be really embarrassed if someone asked her about relationship with me~    I want to kiss my waifu on everywhere. Especially on the lips.   No idea. There is no info about her parents.             We share a bunch of minor personality traits, but other than that we're not that alike, it's more that Yunocchi and I make a good match.   Usually when they have a little tea party in one of their apartments, it's easier and more fun to stay over.  Just normal teenage girl stuff, nothing particularly out of the ordinary.   She does, they are her parents after all.             Seeing as her very existence was erased/cursed by the most badass of overlords, nobody really knows if she even HAS parents.    In almost every way possible, we're exact opposites. She's incredibly determined, passionate, unyielding and has pretty damn good hand-eye-coordination. The only thing we have in common is probably the fact that we're both pretty shameless.   There isn't a single part of her body I wouldn't want to put my lips on.  What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  If I could somehow make it happen, I'd give my waifu  Makai Wars 2 .              She's really good with tech.   Not too much, I guess love for robots.   One ending in the game.   Looks somewhat similar to her sister.             She's probably adept at casual browsing but nothing of the programming sorts! She can most definitely handle most things on her end as long as it isn't too complex. She's definitely the leading pioneer in my heart's fields!  As for making or repairing, my dreams and my heart. She's made many of my nights wondrous, and a lot of my days bearable.   We've both had bad moments in our childhood and have trust issues.   She has! She either hogs the pools or stays away from all the ruckus and trouble.   She looks like a less mature and certainly less volatile version of her mother, and she'd probably get annoyed at me if I said that. She does share a lot of traits from both parents, but didn't really show much resemblance to them as a young child.   I wish I could keep giving her the same smiles and happiness that I often see her in. I wish I could keep giving every time, every day just to see her smile, but the times are a bit tough and I haven't had the ability to in the past eight months. It feels bad, but I hope that one day that it'll all even out and everyone goes home happy.                  Something she has lately showed interest in, eg. a dress she said that looks nice or jewelry she find nice. Otherwise, something related to her hobbies, like new microphone, headphones or something. And I would also take her on a really nice date to the place she really like, of course.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?        Never. I don't want children now or in the future.    I'd love it if she makes a song for me.  We're both weird and we like music.  I think she sleeps with her friend before her friend died. They were close and always stick together because of work, after all.  She doesn't resemble her uncle which is the only shown relative so far.  I'd give her a sword because she likes those.  I'd wait till we get married. Of course I want us to have a stable life first, we're married and has her family's approval before making kids, I don't want her family to get angry to her.              She's never used one before, so she'd need some help with it.  She makes my day.    Nothing major.   No, and i don't think they're really her kind of thing.   She shares some traits with her sister.   Something she's shown interest in, along with what i bake for her.   I'd wait until she'd be in good health.                    Very technologically inclined, for obvious reasons. Can't really say she's the leading pioneer though, as she's one of the mass-production models. Then again, she's the only remaining one, can't really say in that case. She aced all the engineering classes, so I'm betting she could fix most kinds of machinery. I'd want her to teach me some too.  A few things. We both like machines, have no patience for indirect approaches, say what's on our mind without holding back. She's a lot more positive and hopeful though.  Haven't seen her do sleepovers. But if she did, probably the same things girls do on such occasions. Talk a lot, be made to wear cute outfits, play those silly truth or dare games.  Just hope they don't decide to do a pillow fight, because if so, say goodbye to the bed.   I want to kiss her everywhere. But today, I'm inclined to forehead, in a loving praise sort of way.  Not in a physical sense. Despite mass production, they all differ from each other in small but significant ways. As for her 'mother', she resembles her very little.  I wish I could give her eternal happiness. But if you mean like an object, then I'd commission  Robocop's gun arm  for her. She might like it.  A trip to a science fair or an escapade to travel around and see the world are good options too.  Wait until we've accomplished all our dreams, so that we can finally settle down with no regrets. Then we can  construct  offspring, maybe adopt too.                    Hello!  He seems talented enough. Most pillar men are so intelligent that they tend to refer to the latest human technology as mere toys. Then again, I'm sure if he actually tried to use something like a computer, he might find himself surprised!   Something tells me that we'd repair things together or hand the job to whichever one of us has the time to do it. I do come from a family that likes to tinker with things after all, so it's not like I'm totally helpless when it comes to things like plumbing or mechanics. There's nothing we wouldn't be able to fix, I don't think.    We love niceu fightos!    A manly sleepover? Sounds interesting. Then again, considering his series, I wouldn't be surprised if a sleepover he'd go to played out much the same way.  I want to have a private sleepover with my husbando and do each other's nails!     We never see his parents and he has no siblings. I do have some pictures that someone made of what his parents could possibly look like, however! Naturally, his father resembles him quite a lot.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.    Whenever we're both ready. There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to having sonfus, of course.                          Is your waifu self-conscious about the size of her breasts?  Do you like your waifu's VA? How popular is she?   Mai is very polite, which is something I think I share with her, at least to an extent.  Perhaps she would like an antique blade.  Some greater stability would be good.  No, she's pretty well endowed and doesn't seem to concern herself with her chest size. If anything, she makes her less endowed friends feel jealous.  I hadn't really paid attention to Saori Hayami before she started voicing Mai, but since then I have been paying attention to her roles. She's very popular and cam third in this VA poll: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-04-06/kana-hanazawa-hiro<wbr>shi-kamiya-lead-in-favorite-voice-a<wbr>ctor-poll/.86759</wbr></wbr></wbr>             Probably average levels of tech understanding for a Japanese high schooler, maybe a little less because she's clumsy   We're clumsy   Don't know but I hope so given she lives alone and is probably lonely.   Who doesn't?   She doesn't seem to resemble her brother and you never see her parents   A comb or hair clips for her beautiful hair   Financial and emotional stability should be a prerequisite for having children. Age and marital status are less important so long as the woman isn't too young or old to have children meaning anywhere outside 15-40 years old.   She's self conscious of her weight which is maybe related to the size of her breasts.                        How would you respond if you discovered that your waifu used to be a man?   Well, she piloted a Mecha once so she knows enough about technology. All in all she is pretty intelligent.   We're both kinda lazy and we both love pizza. I also like teasing my friends like she sometimes does.  I really would love to have a children with her but I don't think I would be a good parent.  She slept really long in Lelouchs room do you could count that as sleepover, but if it's a sleepover with her friends and stuff, they would probably eat fast-food, talk all night long and sleep till noon.          I'm sure we would really like to have children sooner, but we would wait until we got house with enough space for kids and until we would be financially stable. I want to be sure our kids will have good living conditions.   Probably. However I would remind her that her bust size is perfect for me and that it looks really cute and arousing with her petite body multiple times.   I don't care about her at all. She doesn't even sound like Miku.          Not really, but sometimes it is shown that she hides her breasts. I hope she gets more confident about her perfect chest.  She's the most popular seiyuu of this age, and she's named as "The Queen of Anison". Fuck yes, I like her. I admire her a lot.  I won't be that shocked, since she's manly anyway, she gets more bitches than I do.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Fuck off, retard. No one cares if your feelings are genuine.  The correct term for loving multiple 2D girls is harem and there are dedicated threads for people like you. Waifu threads are meant only for people who are in love with only one girl so you will never be welcomed here. Leave this place and go to harem threads.     Not really, no. She helped out with water damage, at least.   Brown hair and eyes.   There was that OVA released a few days ago where she's at one with the other fairies, so it's not out of the question. They'd most likely drink and have food, maybe talk about the day.   Never say her parents.   That one BL doujin that'll most likely get burned if TPP passes today.   Until we are both ready for a child and at marriage. The 25 range seems most suitable.   Shocked at the fact that she was a man, then shocked that she might actually be gay.  I'd still keep her, though.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Get out.  Does your waifu ever read any doujins? What kind, if she does, and what kind do you think she'd read if she didn't? Non-H works are acceptable answers.                           Unfortunately, yes. I want to alleviate her of her insecurity by reassuring her that they're gorgeous  or just repeatedly impregnating her until they're a few sizes larger .    She replaced the battery in my F 91-W  Hardly  I doubt it  The world may never know  A Nixie clock. Or maybe a snowglobe, snowglobes are cool  Maybe in the late 20's. Sounds like a much better age to start. Better to wait until one is finished with education and has a career  They're not badly sized, I doubt it.  Oh my, the voice. The VOICE. It might be the most sexy thing about her  My dong only expands further <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  In my particular case it's inevitable. For other waifus, absolutely haram                      That wouldn't change anything about her, so I don't see why one should focus on the past. I think that the reaction of Mai's friends when they discovered about her past (illustrated here) is a good one.  I'm pretty sure that Mai has never read any doujinshi, since most of the world's nuclear armaments were dropped on Japan and wiped that country off the face of the Earth close to a century before she was born. She's pretty innocent.and easily embarrassed though, so I imagine that she'd prefer to read light-hearted humorous non-H doujinshi.      She lives in Soul Society which is essentially feudal Japan, the only people using advanced technology belong to the Technological Development Department which she is not a part of. She has spent a lot of time on earth and knows about our technology I.E computers but I doubt she is well versed in utilizing them.  I'd say we're both bold and heavily supportive of our friends.  She sleeps in MC's closet whenever she comes to earth. She doesn't partake in any activities outside of the usual drawing and reading. I don't think she has actually ever had a traditional sleepover.  Don't we all?  She looks almost identical to her late sister and looks eerily similar to her adoptive brother despite no blood relation.  Something chappy related, probably a plush toy. Perhaps a brand new set of high quality drawing utensils, she loves to draw after all.  Not the largest fan of kids, but with her there is a possibility. I'd want to take proper responsibility and thus wait until we're both financially able to support a child as well be being both physically and mentally ready to support the child.  Her breast size is rather small, especially compared to other characters in the same series  not that I'm complaining of course  but she never mentions or even implies she is bothered by it at all. She doesn't care one bit, which is great.  Fumiko Orikasa is great, she's the perfect voice for Rukia. She's voice acted quite a few characters but she's mainly known for her role of Rukia.  Hey, friend.  Orihime a cute.   We talking magical transformation or post operation? I'm surprised to say the least.                                she's pretty good with technology, and can figure anything out if there's a manual to skim through   we're pretty similar, especially in terms of sleepiness and personality.    Most likely. They have a camping trip, in which she spends the entire time asleep - waking up when it's time for food.    Her Grandmother is her only living relative, and they look incredibly similar.    a book, or something cute.   probably never   not really, but she's certainly aware in the difference between her breast size and that of her well endowed friends.   Yep,the voice is perfect. She's not very well known though.   I don't think so.  you're waifu a cute, by the way  If money wasn't an option, where would you take you're waifu on holiday? What would you do?                            Don't derail the thread.  Ded tred. Are waifus finally obscure again?    Basic as fuck, watches idol videos on YouTube. Yes. Nope, she's dumb as fuck but is a natural leader (which I like).  She gave me sweets, different each time.    We are both hyperactive, klutz, disorganized usually, air-headed and one-track minded. Also very stubborn.   Yes. Practices, swims (if pools or at the beach), and eats for days; pillow fights are possible and tends to wander around while asleep.   More on her mother. Slight resemblance to her little sis.   Bread with strawberry jams. Varied imports.   Need a house or two so she can be at ease.   Not really.   Yes! Quite a bit, I suppose.                           Not in the near future.  Maybe once (if) she manages to syujinko it up.    She's not flat, and she never seems to have any trouble with them. With her recent Idol escapades, I'm sure she's pretty satisfied with her own body.    tfw different VAs for every game    Wouldn't really change much. The past is the past afterall.   Unfaithful manwhore.                I'm quite sure she's the type to use Doujinshi as "research material".    Until we're financially stable and emotionally ready.  But definitely not before Yunocchi had a chance to explore and further her artistic path!   Only a tiny bit, it doesn't come up all that often. Though she generally tends to be a little insecure.   She's pretty popular, mainly thanks to the role in which she voiced my wife. A good voice actress all around.            Oh shit   is meant to be<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200       My waifus   Her VA is in everything this season. It's great to hear her voice in so many roles.    I'm pretty sure she doesn't. She probably wouldn't watch any pornography at all.   Rented house near sea. We would go to beach a lot, explore nature around, watch sunsets etc.   Why would they? It's normal for a thread to be slow at this time of a day.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115413  It doesn't matter. How would you feel if your waifu had another man? It's the same as NTR-ing your waifu.  Falling in love with multiple people comes off as never truly falling in love with a single one of them.  Harems a shit       Who made it law that someone can only "truly" fall in love with one person? Seems arbitrary to me.     law  Do you have reading comprehension issues?     6 pm isn't a slow time here    My point in saying that is that everybody acts as if it's law, when it's not. Love knows no man-made arbitrary rules. Who is anyone to deny you your love because THEY deem it unfit?    It's not about your feelings, dipshit, but about the girl's.   Enough about polygamy! Question time!  What couple activity would you like to do with your waifu? Yes, watching vietnamese pictographs count as a couple activity if you're doing it together.  We'd probably play vidyas together and she would probably rant about how the RNG hates her.        How retarded do you have to be to not understand what people are saying to you? <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113477  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115002      People like that are just egotistical scum, they don't even stop for a second to thing about the girls' feelings. It's despicable.   I doubt she would, unless maybe for artistic references. She'd rather read the original work to begin with, though.     I'm not much for travelling, but for my Yunocchi's sake, we'd most likely to any location with a rich art history. If she's having fun, then I will be too!          I understand what they're saying. I just think they're wrong.   Why? Isn't having actual discussion more interesting than playing questionnaire?      Stop taking the bait.   She seems somewhat computer literate. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but nothing minor either.  We both have a thing for good music, plus we're pretty similar in terms of personality.  Quite often. She's pretty closely knit with her friends, though what exactly happens during these sleepovers is beyond me. As long as it doesn't involve leek sticks being stuck in awkward places...  Hard to answer. There's no info on her parents, and she isn't the type to talk about them.  The best platter of tuna sushi that I can prepare.  Definitely the latter. She still has a career to think about, and I don't want to do anything that might bring that to an end.  Wouldn't mind trying, though...   She can be, but only because of the attention they bring her... She might not be the biggest, but they are big enough to draw the eyes of the jealous and lecherous.  She's got a nice sultry voice. Can't say anything too bad about Yuu. Though a high point would be hearing her squee as Sakaki in a certain scene from Azumanga Daioh.  Well, nobody's perfect.  Highly doubtful. Then again, her mind can be particularly lewd when she wants.  A nice stroll through a park sounds nice. Just have to find a nice park in my area.  A nice sea cruise to the tropics. She's always loved being out on the water.                          Having a stroll while holding hands and talking together, cuddling under blanket in front of fireplace at winter evening, kissing while watching stars or sunset and much more.   Not in USA.       Don't tell me what to do.    Obligatory    she would download ALL the dolphin screensavers. those free toolbars also sound useful   most of the related group-trip is off camera, but its one of the few times shes shown interacting with just other girls aside from that her sister also stays with them so it's sort of like every night is a sleep over   her hair colour is similar in the second season but aside from that they don't look much like their younger sister and her parents are never shown.   my stance on it has flip flopped a lot back and forth but I think I'd really just have to ween her character into it I might start her off with a puppy so she gets used to having responsibility, I also like dogs myself so its not that big a deal if I end up taking care of it on my own or something  I'd love to have a daughter with her, just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit, but there is so much to think about before then.    no, she's incredibly non-self-conscious about just about anything   they're both great her jap isn't that popular, and also voiced one of the most hated characters on /a/, but her dub has a massive history of roles with some of the most popular dubs on /a/, notably bebop   given her abilities I suppose it's not exactly impossible, but it also would be by magic instead of snapping a dick off and making a flesh hole so I'm down.   she's read regular manga, so I'd think she'd have no issues reading non-h it'd be interesting walking in on her reading an h-doujin not hearing me come in with her face blushing  I'm not sure whether I'd sneak out so I don't get bludgeoned for spooking her or sneak in further and try to initiate by kissing her neck while shes concentrating    gardening seems nice, though I'd be a little afraid if she got too enthusiastic she might somehow acquire some sort of giant venus fly trap that keeps us at bay from the garden until it dies                                  Does your waifu know how to please a man?   Shinobu's pretty smart. She's one of the more talented biopsychologists in Academy City although not the best, and she's pretty proud of it. She's also confident with machines and computers.  I don't think she can help me with my psychology, my biology, maybe.   I don't believe she has sleepovers, since she previously used to live alone and didn't have any friends. She probably does with Janie and Febrie now though.   I couldn't say, since her relatives and such were never shown.   Spend time with her. She likes reassurance that she's doing good.    Probably would prefer to wait until we had a house. However, a lot of that stuff can be excuses, and she's shown that she's partial to kids so the answer would be 'as soon as possible'.   She never mentions anything like that, so she probably thinks that it's silly. Or maybe she does privately.   Hayama Ikumi? She's okay, not super popular. I haven't gone out of the way to check her roles out, and none of them that I've heard are anything like Shinobu.   I'd be surprised at how advanced science has come.   A relaxing resort or the like.   We could visit cafes often, does that count? OR take Janie and Febrie around to play and shit.   Boy, reading the word 'couple activities' used to make me mad.   Blogshit warning: I've recently been questioning myself a lot because 80 - 90% of my thoughts regarding her have been of wanting to do lewd stuff, which does betray a certain shallowness. I'm not quite sure how to overcome this, I probably need to give more thought to her personality.                                    Not at all.   Amusing ones.   That's a cute outfit.   Sex.             She's really good with Technology, she's always on her laptop and she's great with tinkering electronic devices  She made some headphones once as a gift, they are described as "revolutionary" which shows off her amazing skill     Quick, share one sexual fantasy you have with your waifu  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117509  The waifufags are the worst.    We both love technology and music, i mostly like calm and relaxing environments and so does she, and we both like sharing random trivia   She has a really close friend but she moved away, i don't think she has any sleepovers   I'd give her a brand new laptop, hers must be pretty old That and a piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace           I want to  make love to her  in the  missionary position  while I  hold  her soft, warm  hands  and then  cuddle  afterwards    Fuck her cute butt.    Making love in formal wear comes to mind.   Alternatively omorashi      The fanbase considers her a queen in that regard.  In the shower or on a billiard table.      I wanna give her a slow pleasurable oral while she wraps her thighs around my head and i massage different parts of her   She's a Super Class A hacker   Ahh, but how is she when she doesn't surf?    But I thought she was incredible math    Rather not, but I would lead her to make us both feel good. Her pleasure would be more important to me though.   Romantic, passionate sex in lotus position while embracing tightly and looking into each other eyes, I guess.        Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   How can she? She's not real.      Chihiro prefers to read books on paper, but she's accepted the growing influence of the internet and its effects on people.   We're both huge nerds who love art   Book covers.  And books to put those covers on    Until we're in a stable life situation and after we're married.   No   Yes, but not that popular. It's good, since i don't have to think of her in other roles much.   It's Chihiro I care about, but this scenario is neither here or there since she's cis  love    Probably, she loves Shoujo manga so despite fandom claims I don't think she'd read yaoi.   We'd watch movies. Chihiro doesn't like reading together since she'd want to talk if we're around, so movies sound like they would work.  How would you greet her after you've had a long day of work? I'd give her a hug and kiss and if she weren't too busy I'd invite her to lay down and watch something with me.                              Thanks.   Sex with her on my lap  while interlocking our fingers    L-Lewd!          I'd wait until we both have a stable situation, a home and a good income   She doesn't seem to be too worried about it, she seems happy with herself as she is, which is great   I do, Mamiko Noto does a great job showing Fuuka as the gentle and caring person she is   I'd probably take her sightseeing, there's not much to do in port Island but I'm sure we could just walk around and make a picnic under a three or watch some movies   We'd go sightseeing and taking photographs, we could also watch some live music shows and concerts                That's too private to say!    But it's not like I hadn't mentioned face sitting and spanking her cute butt before.    A long and tight hug, then pick her up for a kiss, and carry her right to bed for some quality cuddling time.        I'm going to impregnate Nero! I love my emperor!   I think that New Zealand would be an interesting country to visit.  I used to do fencing. Maybe we could try that out and see what I remember, though she would trounce me quite effortlessly. (I did foil while her fighting style resembles the sabre but I don't think she'd have any problems adapting.)  She's a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but I'll wager that she knows what she'd need to do for that.  A hug and kiss sounds like a good way to proceed.          I'd hug her and ask how her day went, serve her some tea, give her a massage to relieve her stress, and make sure she's satisfied and relaxed  Question What would be your waifu's ideal vacation?  (Fuuka seems the type of girl who'd love a nice landscape, i imagine taking her some place with lot's of wilderness)         If she's home when I am, I'd greet her with a warm hug and some tender words. Usually depends on how exhausting my day has been.   She seems fond of any place with nice scenery, though she seems especially lively near the ocean. It's part of the reason I'd like to take her on an ocean cruise one of these days.  I've only been on one, and I wouldn't mind giving that same experience to someone close to me.        The size, not really. She may feel bad that they aren't soft though.  Haven't really seen a lot of other stuff she's done, but I like what I've seen. Unsure how popular she is, but she doesn't seem to get many roles.  Not very surprised. She may look like and identify as a girl, but she has turned out to be rather flexible in that regard.  I would hope she wouldn't read them at all. Otherwise I may get really clumsy flirting or awful jokes thrown at me.  Actually, that sounds kinda nice .  I don't think she's ever been to the mountains. Let's go there.  So many things: Playing games. Cuddling. Going out holding hands. Take her to a fancy party and dance. Sparring. Go shopping.  Fighting evil back to back against impossible odds, and propose there and then. It's the most romantic setting of all.   You lost me.  Well, the most sexual thing we could possibly do would be  hugging .  Hello Chihiroman!  Say "I'm back", receive "Welcome back".  But that's not enough, gotta wrap an arm around her waist and pull her in for a kiss. Or nuzzle her neck with my nose, that's fine too.   She enjoys learning and seeing new things, so the best thing for her would be a trip around the world. 80 days might not be enough though.                                She at least knows how to use a computer but I doubt she's tech savvy. Well she could give herself the necessary skills to be.  Pretty opposite except for a love of things that are artistic.  Seen pics of her and Casko sleeping together so I guess that counts.  She does resemble her mother and if you buy into the theory that she and Arturia are related then of course they resemble each other.  Almost like clones or something.<br/>   I always have trouble thinking of something for this but maybe a party and a trip to the theater.  I don't really want any and she seems like she'd be too busy but if she wanted it then I would wait till things settled down.  Naw. She knows she looks great.  Sakura Tange is great and I would think she would be popular for voicing Sakura Kinomoto.  Not surprised. I guess that's how she really got away with being recorded as a man.  She hasn't been shown to but I can see her reading yuri ones. Also ones about herself.  Perhaps a trip to the most beautiful cities in Europe.  I'd like to work on an art piece with her and take part in one of her plays.  Man and/or woman, her technique is the best.  Steamy sex in the bath.   Looks like she's popular.                                 Almost our entire relationship is based upon things we have in common, it's what attracted me to her so much in the first place. We are lazy, daydreamers, prone to hoarding, dislike bureaucracy, love potatoes, enjoy inebriation, navigate life at our own slow and steady tempo, and a lot more to boot!  Talking, fun, teasing, drinking, playing and sleeping.  Her twin sister Ursula looks precisely the same as her, just with glasses.  I'll think about that next April.  As long as we need. I really want to, but realistically, we're still too lazy as of now.  Not usually. She looked a bit miffed in S2/E10 when Francesca groped Hanna but aside from that one time, she seems fine with her petite bust, even when surrounded by larger girls. In any case, I prefer slim girls. Built for speed!  I think Sakura Nogawa is somewhat underrated, although that could just be my own bias.  If money isn't an option, then we'll have to make do with camping in the forest nearby.  She pleases me regularly but I prefer to please her.  Ignore those who would attack that as blogshit, as they'll only be crying about the questions and lack of interaction later. Anyway, what you describe may not be shallowness as much as becoming carried away with lewdness, which is something that can happen to many of us (including me). At any rate, you seem to be able to answer the questions well.  Being handcuffed as she sits on my face while lovingly applying a pleasure/pain combo of oral and CBT! Well, you did ask...  Standard-issue hug and kiss, quickly wash my face and hands, followed by a makeout session on the couch/bed. This may lead to either cuddling, lewd, or both!  Anywhere with sun and good ice-cream, so she can just eat and relax in the shade.                            Changing waifus is degeneracy, right?    Same here     Not necessarily, it wholly depends on the specific circumstances.  But most excuses are scummy.      She is never seen using computers. I think she may need some assistance in using a computer.  We have a couple of things in common like fighting for our friends.  Yes she definitely does. She is the one who make cake and stuff to eat and she is the lewdest around them.  Oh yea Akeno looks exactly like her mother  I would give her lingerie  She would want me to get settled into a house then have our child  Biggest bust in the series she doesn't care  I love her VA. She is pretty popular http://myanimelist.net/people/93/It<wbr>ou_Shizuka  Why should that matter I dont think she would change if she was a he  She does not read doujins though she does watch   porn   on her free time  I would take her to   Go to the movies then go to my home and relax  If you mean massages and finger licking   SAndM with her which turns to passtionate sex to make children            </wbr>                   Vidya, naps, and the aforementioned pictographs.    kissu and cuddles, and a cup of tea.    somewhere quiet, like a nice forest lodge.          Chihiro's ideal vacation is sort of like Kyoto: Lots of stuff to see and a relaxing area. Distant, yet familiar at the same time.  The Fushimi shrine is also in Kyoto but that has not much to do with it and is likely coincidence    Hello, Aigisfriend! Chihibro is fine, really. I do wish there was a way I could get to know you more, I like getting to know my fellow Personafriends.        She's average at it, she knows how to use her computer/phone, she have no problems with these kind of things.  She made  me happy.    Minor personality traits, we love cute stuff, and both afraid of heights.   She had a few of them. They did a lot of stuff in them, played games, girls talk, she really enjoyed them.   I want to headpat the bassist.   Her parents are never shown, and she's the only kid of the family, so I have no answer to this question.   A new amp.  That's what she was thinking about what she would buy if she had extra money  But also a nice gateau au chocolat, flowers, and a few other things.   Until we have our own place, and a stable situation.   She is. Her best friend is also jealous of them at the beach.   I like her and she's kinda popular.   I would wonder what kind of technology was used, because there's not a single trace of her previous self, she can even be pregnant, that's amazing.   Never.   A tropical island, where we could be alone on the beach, relax, play in the water, sunbathe, and do lewd things. Or maybe a nice cabin in the Alps, mountains are lovely, I've always loved them  and the word Mountain is also in her name, that's a sign    Taking bass lessons with her as the teacher. Biking together. Cuddles.  I love her.                                                 she is better than that    J-Jellycatz? You are still alive?     She does use magitech a lot and doesn't need help with those computers, but she's not exactly an expert with that stuff.   We both care about justice.   I can see a resemblance to her mother, and she looks like Alicia for obvious reasons.   Not any specific age, just when we both fell like we're ready.   She seems fine with their size.   She's extremely popular, and I really like her. Can't wait for that Live Acoustic BD.   Someplace on a lake where we could spend time together.   Build Gunpla together.   A hug and kiss, and ask her how it went.                             If Yomiko reads a book on the subject I think she can master the computer     Something in common  Our love of literature    I imagine Nene sleeping over whenever she would come to do the cleaning    Her parents are never seen so I have no idea    A bunch of books or try to track down a signed edition of one of her favourite her novels    A couple years, that's if we really want too.    I think she's pretty oblivious to how big they are    Yomiko's VA has only voiced her    Probably not doujins but I imagine her reading good old lewd literature    Probably Paris for literary reasons     Reading together, going to bookshops and just buying what we can find, going to book festivals.    Making love to Yomiko against a book case in a library, trying to be as quiet as possible as we undress one another, next would be bending her over a table and doing doggy.     A hug then kiss and I'd tell her I would prepare some tea, maybe a shoulder rub or foot rub to go along with it.  What have you done for your waifu lately? I've bought about 16 or so books lately which I hope Yomiko would enjoy.                                                        I've been exercising and arranging my folders a lot i need to have it all nice and tidy    Apart from the an eager hug, a long relaxing dinner and getting shit about our respective days off our chest, if she wants.    Mentioned it earlier - nothing too stimulating, something chill like a cruise or resort. I'd like that too.   Thanks again.   I made a new reference pic for WWD, eh, and wrote some stuff. I 'went out' with her a few times. Saw a Railgun LN in the bookstore which made for a strange experience.  How do you guys feel 'close' to her - following a routine, doing stuff, looking at merch?               Rather than going to a single location a luxury cruise with just the two of us sounds pretty great.  Couple activity? Now I'm no romantic but things like; Video games, watching movies, cooking and just generally hanging out with her would be a lot of fun.  She knows how to please me. Thats enough.  Bondage sounds like something worth trying out. If only once.   Welcome home! Shall I run you a bath? Or perhaps you'd like something to eat? Or maybe...you want me?   My geography is bad, I can't name a single place. But Rukia really likes high places, so someplace with mountains, maybe cliffs.                <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  It's a thing with squares that you eat for breakfast, but that's not important right now.   she is a gamer   I think Kagura knows the basics. She wouldn't accidentally download a load of viruses on a computer or anything like that.  She repaired  my soul.    We both like videogames and swimming.   Her parents have never been seen, so I can't say for certain.   I bought her a necklace for her birthday last year. Nothing too fancy, just something she can wear all the time. I haven't thought about what to do for this year.   We'd definitely need some financial stability;  there's no way I could afford having a child on a part time wage.  A house/apartment to ourselves with plenty of space would also be a good idea.   Not really,  she's pretty endowed as is.    Kuwashima's one of the best, in my opinion. She has great range and has done a lot of work since the mid-90's, and still going.   It wouldn't change a thing between the two of us.   I don't think she does, but if she did I could see her being into shounen/sports manga.                             absolutely none at all   Working on my outer appearance. Trying to look good for her.  Come next week, I'll be training to become an instructor.    Listening to her songs is usually the way to go when I'm home. Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side; it's a feeling that flares up even more when I come across merch of her. Mostly, though, I feel close to her during my training. Thinking of her gives me the drive to intensify my efforts and keep pushing forward.        Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side  amen to that     I stare at her photos all the time and i play Persona 3 a lot and speak with her in-game    Road trip across the coast of France and along southern Europe.   There's so much I could think of! Spending the day at the beach or a water park is pretty high up on my list though.   Wanting to do lewd things with your partner is a natural part of the relationship. As long as the two of you are fine with it, there shouldn't be any need to worry.   I want to  2lewd4u  her in the  censored.    Lift her up as we hug eachother, and give her a peck on the cheek.   She'd love to visit America sometime, but she's a little concerned about flying.   Depends on the circumstances.   I did a pretty intense workout with her the other day.  No, not that kind of workout.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893   A wonderful little pile of love!    Going out jogging, exercising, looking at pictures of her, and the daki.                               I think it would be her greeting me first. She would hug and kiss me. Then I would probably go rest somewhere with her so we could talk about our day and maybe plan how we will spend the rest of the day.   Any warm, nice place where we could spend lot's of time outside, I guess.   Nothing more than usual things, like listening to her songs, cuddling and talking to her in bed etc.    How do you guys feel 'close' to her  Well, the closest I feel to her is when I cuddle and talk to her daki while pretending its her, daydreaming while being high and fantasizing about having sex with her during masturbation.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  The girl that made me feel thing I've never felt before.                 Hug, kiss, even more kissing.   I think she'd really enjoy just relaxing on the beach.   Trying to stay happy.   Wake up to her, think about her during the day, go to sleep looking at her and other things.             Fate a cute.    I'd like that as well.  Getting more pics. So many pages to go.  Her fig stands to the side of the monitor, always watching. That's as close as it can be, I think. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  Love in its purest, undistilled form. Not for the faint of heart.           Keep up a steady work rate. No real days off with internship and job but I'm working harder for her!   Kissing her daily.   I'm looking forward to it! Just where could we talk, though?          Thank you, she is.    No, not really. I don't think she's ever shown anything like that.   Yui Horie has a really cute and wonderful voice. I'd imagine she's pretty popular.   Severely creeped out and feel very odd at first, but if she's 100% girl now by whatever reasons, I don't think I'd have really much to say. If she's 100% the same as she is now even after, then it's just a short awkward while of strange.   Some cute doujins I'd imagine, robot fanworks,  Erotic Butler BL doujins perhaps    Anime, videogames, questing and work. A lot more things, too.   Severely doubt it.    1boy 1girl cum cum_on_body cum_on_breasts cum_on_clothes cum_on_hair cum_on_lower_body cum_on_upper_body cumdrip facial cum_in_mouth cum_in_pussy lingerie sex happy_sex missionary_position doggystyle cowgirl reverse_cowgirl thighhighs                       Super lewd all night    I'd give her some hugs and kisses, then I'd just sit down in the couch or chair and laze around for a while.   Not much, apart from trying to lose some weight, at least ease into something.   Daki.                               I love Ai so so much!    I don't know, but if she doesn't, teaching her how to use computers and maybe even program sounds really fun.   A quiet, but fierce determination when it comes to doing things, whether it be academic or recreational. I have to admit though, that she is better at actually getting started than I am.    She is pretty popular, but I don't really pay attention to her. I thought it was funny that she had to have a conversation with herself while working on Cross Ange on more than one occasion.    Money is no object  Space. I'd love to see the stars with her, but up close, which is something I could only manage if I had near unlimited resources. That or Cancun.   Help her improve her swim times, learn something together such as a dance, language or other skill. I'd like to do some unorthodox things that might be fun too like urban exploration. Really, I'd love to do quite a few things with her.    This sums it up quite nicely: http://pastebin.com/Z5v70Z19l    I'd hug her from behind and stay like that for a while, then I'd kiss her and tell her I love her.    I don't do it intentionally like "Oh I need to think about Ai today", but every so often I'll get this really bubbly feeling of being in love and do something as an outlet for that: drawing, writing, listen to romantic songs, some of them sad, and they remind me of her.  Especially the songs it's something I find myself doing a lot lately. Man, if I close my eyes and lip sync while pretending I'm singing to her, I feel like my chest is going to burst from emotion and I feel like crying    OHHH MYY LOVEEEE, MY DARLIIING                                 this pastebin has been deleted  Fuck you too Pastebin. Good thing I saved it. Giving it another shot:  http://pastebin.com/CamHEYG7      Yeah, good thing you saved it.    We don't share many traits but we're a good match and complement each other.   He does. Judging by some official pictures, a lot of plush animals, cute pajamas and sweets are involved. I'm sure they have a lot of fun together.   I want to kiss Makoto on the nape.   He looks like a perfect mix of his parents.   Pets, tickets for amusement parks/zoos/aquariums and my love.   I'd honestly let Makoto decide. I trust him to be reasonable enough and he loves children so I want him to be happy.   Not only the chest but his whole body actually. Makoto popped a shirt button off his shirt because he's so well endowed and got really embarrassed about it, it was so adorable.   His VA does an incredible job with Makoto's sweet, gentle and warm voice, I love it. I think his VA is semi popular but I'm not that knowledgeable about seiyuu.   I wouldn't care. I love Makoto the way he is now.   Makoto wouldn't read lewd stuff so light-hearted non-H works only if anything.   Travel to various places around the world.   We'd pet cats, play vidya, cuddle and eat sweets together.   No, Makoto is purer than fresh snow.  I'll teach him though.    Let him sit on my face and please him orally in various places.   Hug and a kiss on the foreahead, cheek and mouth in this order while caressing his back.   Makoto would love beautiful landscapes and impressive places so I'd do a tour around the world with him.   Look at pictures, imagine various scenarios to please him and hug my Makoto pillow. Post a picture of your waifu when she was young.                                                     Pretty competent with machines. Her phone above all things is pretty advanced considering it's a phablet and bluetooth at the same time.  You can say she fixed my heart, if that counts.  Even if it upsets people on a personal level, we will do what is right.  Doesn't care.  Satomi isn't that popular. That said, she was definitely a contributor in getting me to really notice what I had been missing in my life. She truly brought Kuroko to life in the adaptations, and I respect her greatly.  I would not be surprised.  Lewd thinking is pretty natural when it's for the one you love. Thanks, brain.  The merch search is never over.   how  Exactly what you said, and daki in the morning, or when I go to sleep.                     She's pretty well inclined. She never had one of her own, due to growing up in an orphanage, but she's interested. She hasn't repaired anything for me, no.  Several things, actually. We're both shy, have problems with self esteem and self worth, and both have a stutter. My problems aren't nearly as bad as hers.  She spends a lot of time with her friend Lilly, but no mention of a sleepover.  We don't see her parents, seeing as how they died when she was young.  Something small and heartfelt. She never liked her birthday much, but I'd use the day to tell her how much she really means to me and how much I love her.  A little while. I don't think we would rush into it, but we wouldn't wait too long.  No, she's much more self-conscious about other things.  She doesn't have one.  If she isn't anymore, I don't see the problem. I fell in love with her as she is now, and I wouldn't stop loving her.  Unknown. She loves reading books, though.  Somewhere quiet and peaceful. I think a trip into nature somewhere would be lovely.  Watch movies, play vidya, cuddle.  Give her a big hug and kiss, and tell her how much I missed her.  Someplace where your troubles could just melt away, and you could be on your own.  I think about her every day, and always keep her close to my heart.                                Wasn't there an IRC or a Steam group? I'm unsure.    We can make an IRC channel for just us if you wanna talk one-on-one.    Does your waifu have a blood sister?  Can she defeat gojira?      They never died: they just faded away.     How technologically inclined is your waifu?   Not much.  Does she need help using computers?  Maybe a little but she is the type who can learn fast.   Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   No way.  Yes, we share similar traits in personality, other than that not much.  Yes, in an ideal world she does. They play games like old maid, watch TV, eat snacks, tea and keki, talk about their lives, have pillow fights, etc.  I wish I knew, I soppused it's the same as Yuno. Her warmt comes from her parents.  To be happy.  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127106709#p127124718">Click here</a> to view the full text.                    Miku would be the closest thing to one, though the fanbase feels that they are closer than blood sisters.   And suddenly I remember a song from the second Project Diva game where your chosen character can grow kaiju size and fight a Gojira expy. She could probably handle the King of the Monsters quite fine, though I doubt her chances against the likes of Destroyah.

The point is the first OP sounds better, even if it's unfitting to the actual show. Besides, the second OP just reuses most of the art from the first so it's more unfitting to the actual OP.     I think the second one sounds better   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tpq<wbr>wY7tsZS4</wbr>  [ ]  TURN A...GUNDAM     couldn't imagine any other OP for this show   Fukken fagets I swear. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZeD<wbr>JLME8N3Y</wbr>  [ ]   The best thing about that entire show was the first and last 2 minutes pretty much hands down.

ED is amazing.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5Ef<wbr>0XEttdO4</wbr>  [ ]  Literally the best Gintama opening     That's because she's popular for Nitro+ VNs/anime OPs.

Also:   Glad that BONES didn´t make S2 even Eureka 7 went to shit          Best OP/ED combo of the season I thought. Though there were a lot of good OPs and EDs this season. Houkago no Pleiades was probably the runner up for best combo OP and ED together, but I think Punchline comes otu on top.     Have you heard the Shokugeki ED, it's incredible.    das it mane     tfw you will never have a group of aidoru's asking you, "NANDE NANDE NANDE NANDE NANDE DA?!"     cant go wrong with bleach   gatchamaaaaaaaan    Houkago no Pleiades was probably the runner up for best combo OP and ED together  How? I love the show but the OP is so boring      I don't know, I like it. The visuals especially.

If you're calling me dumb because I said it's not talked about, and you're about to use the &gt;newfag or "it was talked about plenty when it aired" argument, then you're a fucking retard who's probably new as shit and should shut the fuck up.

I like feet, especially Hestia feet.     cle masashiro doing hestia   oh baby, can't wait for the book      Better than the Sakura fish threads already.    why dont you post actual good hestia feet?      it's not by a Japanese artist so it's automatically shit  They look more like feet than the other two pictures posted in the thread. Fuckin' weeaboos (the actual meaning), I swear.      sorry    Just look at the fucking picture, it looks like utter shit. Even a screenshot from the anime would be better.   Feet are fucking disgusting.      it looks like utter shit  And by that you mean has the best use of color and shading by far of any of the Hestia images in the thread? Admit it: you don't like it because the feet aren't Japanese-stylized.     This is lewd    I don't understand my interest in feet. Sucking on them or a footjob doesn't seem all that appealing to me, but I find feet aesthetically pleasing when drawn right. This gif is probably the only instance where feet turn me on.   Anyone else feel this way?      I'm extremely aroused. You can stop now.   Footfags should be rounded up and put in death camps.   feet    Oh and this picture as well.

Because Eva is a waifu-bait show.   Well he was better in the manga.   Shit writing.  Only sane person to pilot an EVA?  Wouldn't work, but I would love to see how he fights an Angel.    The hell was this?   He wasn't bishounen so Anno couldn't make any money off of him.    He did fight one. He got wrecked in like three seconds.     He had no prior experience. Unfair fight.    Most likely because he was originally established as a bully to Shinji. By seeing Toji develop, it's illustrated to the audience (who are presumably otakus who have had experience with and hold contempt for bullies) that those who commit cruel acts against them are just as human as they are; meaning they have some justification for third actions.  This plays into the idea of the Hedgehog's Dilemma introduced in the same episode as Toji himself.     Holy shit, I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good. /a/ truly has major shittaste. I mean first they say that it will be a recap episode and then it's only like two minutes recap and the rest plot. We got that fucking Satsuki rape scene and the new OP is cash as hell. And cutest girl even got her on ED. This anime is truly gold, so let's discuss who best girl is and why it is Ryuko~    /a/ truly has major shittaste   But the majority of /a/ loved it, what people got tired of was the mass amount of shitposting followed with KLK. The show itself is okay, but no where near the savior of anime.     kill la kill yourself   that's pretty rich coming from a weeboo    but no where near the savior of anime.   implying we need a saviour         Congrats on your patrician taste, OP.       implying we need a saviour  You're right, Inferno Cop already saved it and Ninja Slayer is helping rebuild the damages          &gt;implying we need a savior  Well, that's what everyone was implying when it was airing, and that Kill la Kill would be it. Many were let down because they let the immense hype get to them too much.     it sucks   no it doesn't   it sucks   no it doesn't   autistic ryukofags   autistic nononfags   image dump  Saved you a thread, OP.         It sucks. You have shit tastes. Watch more anime.     Go back to your plebeian anime threads.    Exactly. All you're going to get here is shitposting, anon. /a/ loved the shit out of it when it aired, there were huge and constant threads for every little thing at all times. Now, that it's over the majority will call it shit.    what /a/ hates the most is the autistic fanbase and that it became popular in tumblr     /v/ occupation is now /a/     That's nice, OP. Because in about 2 episodes it's going to become complete and utter shit.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127080158    I feel the same way   It was a shit version of TTGL with the main theme literally being that nothing makes sense. The finale was crap,  Nui anti-climactically offs herself and is forgotten, while Senketsu dies like the writers remembered at the last minute that they promised a bittersweet ending and had to shoehorn it in . Terrible way to send off such crucial characters. Not to mention all the other plotlines that were dropped, pointless, or otherwise felt like shit was being made up as it went along.   Ryuuko being stronger than Satsuki because she had friends was such bullshit when she kept ignoring Mako and Senketsu, while Satsuki's bond with the deva's was one of the most entertaining parts of the show. Satsuki in general was a much more compelling protagonist. The show's powerlevels were all over the place; Ryuuko is on par with Satsuki by the third episode but suddenly we have to slog through club of the week bullshit for half the show. And post-timeskip everything was a mess.   It was a fun ride, but it was full of holes. On the plus side the soundtrack was fantastic, in spite of some dodgy animation it was overflowing with style, and some of the side characters were really fun to watch. I can't say I regret watching it but it's no masterpiece.      Why do people even reply to these threads? Just ignore this shit.    I come for the waifus     Satsuki in general was a much more compelling protagonist.   It was a fun ride, but it was full of holes. On the plus side the soundtrack was fantastic, in spite of some dodgy animation it was overflowing with style, and some of the side characters were really fun to watch. I can't say I regret watching it but it's no masterpiece.   Agreed   Every fucking thread. There were crossboarders around when KLK aired that's for sure, but implying they were all from /v/ is foolish.         I just finished episode 19 and I can slowly understand were the hate is coming from. Out of literally nowhere best girl turned the edge on and hated on Senketsu who she pitied like two episodes ago, literally why.   Nice blog OP, enjoy your casual pleb taste. I bet you love Clannad and K-On too.    It was good in the first 8 or so episodes, at most until episode 12.   Nothing was interesting anymore, the animation shit itself and took the fight scenes with it thanks to "lol moving still images" animation becoming too commonplace. It was a boring mess of a show at the halfway point and it didn't even redeem itself in the end.   Overall it was a good show in the first half that become less than mediocre in the second half.        You're basically on the cusp of where the show turns into useless irredeemable shit.    Don't forget to watch the part after the ED     Clannad and K-On  No I saw neither and don't plan to  yet.    Yeah Satsuki seems to have a plan, so I'm hyped   I can already taste it           She didn't pity Senketsu. She was talking about herself, but using Senketsu as a proxy. Senketsu didn't really give a fuck about fighting Life Fibers, but Ryuko hated the idea that she was being forced to fight a battle she didn't care about, like in episode 13.     Yeah Satsuki seems to have a plan     Her character gets smashed after 18 but she's still awesome     implying that was serious  You are aware that "saving anime" was a years-old meme at that point, right?      but she's still awesome     Autismo please go back to your board     Okay the cliffhanger from episode 19 was really shit, but episode 20 made up for it really really good   It's not even that /a/ hates it. It's that a vocal minority hates it or otherwise loves to shit on it and that the people who actually liked it don't feel strongly enough to post in the threads or are turned off by the constant shit-flinging around the topic that we have all come to expect.    How do you think Satsuki is going to perform with Senketsu?    see   You're missing the entire crux of Ryuko's character if you think that's what went down and why it did so.         Also, it should be mentioned that one of the drama CDs revealed that Nui had been invading Ryuko's mind and tormenting her during the entire period she was comatose.      True.    She did pity Senketsu, Senketsu said it himself, Ryuko was both using herself as a proxy and genuinely feeling bad for him.   But also to  she didn't hate Senketsu, she even says it herself she hated herself and she didn't blame him, but Senketsu is both her mirror and her counterpart so she took it out on him, which was wrong. But she does literally spill her guts apologizing to him later and they come out stronger than ever for it so it's fine isn't it?      Same situation when Code Geass and Gurren Lagann were released.   People were going batshit insane with those series back then and calling them the GOATS at that time period.  Then a few years later people start yelling that Code Geass is the biggest trainwreck in Anime history and started hating it, because trainwreck.  And with Gurren Lagann. YEARS and I mean YEARS people said it was the most casualized anime ever made. It became unanimous that everyone knew about it as much as EVA and still call it shit.  You should of seen when Madoka came out as well. Everyone made it into a meme and now everyone calls it overrated shit.  Masaki Yuasa is well liked, Shinbo is well hated, and Ikuhara is well liked.   Which makes no sense since their film styles are similar, but focused on different places. Masaki (Art and Direction), Shinbo (Art), and Ikuhara (Direction).  But people just go insane with any of these series.  And just wait until people start hating on Jojo, Berserk and HxH.   Because it already has happened.                     Why did I cry at here and at the sister part, this is just getting too cute   the fight was good even if she got rekt   yeah I'm at episode 22 and the edge was turned off, so it's pretty cool again    quality post on /a/  oh shit              the fight was good  The animation sucked. Anyway, here comes the real shit. 23 is probably the worst episode of the entire series, and the best part is that it's completely useless. You'll see why soon enough.     You can feel the love    Wow so you found something you enjoy eventhough /a/ says it's shit and instead of enjoying it like a normal person you make a Thread where you state your bullshit opinion.  How fucking autistic are you? Nobody cares if you like it or not. Go back to tumblr shithead.      Best harem    Well /a/ needed to be put into its place since people are retarded.   /a/ needs to learn to accept popular series sometimes, because there is a place for why they became popular.Because all the directors I've talked about still gets 100% hate even though they are at least the most interesting Directors around in the anime biz.  I could also add in the Director Tetsurou Araki and Imaishi, but we already know their situation.  Imaishi in /a/'s eyes is an overrated hack, but actually knows how to key frame better or equal to Bones good stuff.   And Araki is unabashedly hated universally on /a/ because he made 2 of the most popular anime series on the face of this Earth.           Anyone who considers KLK anything more than a weak 6/10 has watched less than 60 shows, this is irrefutable fact.  Anyone who defends KLK on /a/ is without a doubt completely new and mostly came here from tumblr, and again has watched less than 60 shows, this is also irrefutable fact.      don't post anime you like on /a/  Get out     let me guess: you've watched a total of 61 shows? :^)    I've watched at least 120 series in my lifetime. And KLK is at best 8/10, since it is only truly bogged down on pacing and some dumb story moments, but entertainment wise it is high up their with Imaishi's high octane action.    /a/ is not one person you fucking retard, you're not putting anyone in their place, maybe you should learn to not take everything so seriously since spouting retarded opinions without any backlash is the main appeal of 4chan.    /thread     I've watched at least 120 series in my lifetime   Sure is summer in here.     Ironic that KLK has some subtle levels of 2deep4u about some classic feminism ideas but it goes over everyone's heads because it's shonen and it seems absolutely nonsensical. I don't blame anybody though, shit is fucking whack.   dat destruction of the original life fiber   dat teamwork bringing down the transmitter   Felt like something out of Gurren Lagann  I say that in a good way        Dude. I've seen those 3x3 threads and 100% it always has the same shit everyone puts at the top.  At least 1 Imaishi show, 1-2 Hidaeki Anno shows, 1-3 Masaki shows, 1-3 Ikuhara shows, 1-3 Shinbo shows, 1-3 Butcher shows, Oshii in general, fuck ton of Ishihara shows, and 1-3 Abe Shows, Aria in general, Naoki Urasawa, 1-3 Watanabe shows, AND ALWAYS Fukumoto in the manga section.  These are so overdone and I've seen too many 3x3 that have them.  They aren't bad anime creators, but it is true that /a/ is filled with a bunch of hypocrites tha make fun of series that have these directors, writers, and manga creators 24/7.           it got better and went to space   everyone jobbed to a barrier and the transmitter was useless      Too much Gurren Lagann.   Kill la Kill was right up my alley. I didn't mind the fanservice, but Ryuko was an amazing protagonist and every fight was amazing. The first three episodes were probably some of the best episodes of anime I have ever seen.     But why does the smile chart suck so much?     ryuko truly best girl      I need to watch more shit to say something is shit   kill yoruself      Nice quads   Satsuki x Ryuuko is OTP   No.    Greatest Love Story Ever Told    It has great opening and closing episodes but the story sags towards the latter half. I think it would have improved if the whole invading other schools thing was cut out, maybe down to 20 episodes.    Oh god      I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good   Funny, KLK had me hooked pretty hard around said episode (from the ending of the school raid trip along Japan to the first few episodes with everyone fighting naked, post timeskip) but it would end up dying rather quickly in the following ones. By episode 20 the show as a whole began to feel really unsatisfying for me; kept watching it to the end but turns out it ultimately failed to deliver.  Still a decent watch overall, although the last third definitely does not hold up nearly as well.        Yeah, it definitely could be a lot shorter. That was my main gripe with the series. Everything between episode 3 and 17 were pretty much unnecessary.     For KLK to have been AOTY it should have been 13 episodes only    Actually the complaints were more or less simultaneous, but that's also why they were inherently narrow-minded and irrelevant as fuck because the show ended extremely well. A lot of shows would envy having an ending half as good as that of Code Geass      Feminism  No, it just has strong female characters, not for the sake of politics, but because that's just how it should be. The big messages of KLK are about individuality (Ryuko) vs conformity (Satsuki, Ragyou, her father, Life Fibers, destiny), and the middle ground between them.  Some of the execution could have been better, but those messages were definitely there.       Gateway anime of the worst kind. New age gateway.    But KLK went downhill after Episode 14.   Just posting.  Sadly doesn't work well with three monitors.   There's some other shit. Individuality vs comformity is what you and every other person in the world thinks is the only theme of that show.      Yes? Why would anyone care about the opinion of someone who's clearly not involved in the medium he's shitposting about, stop being a fucking retard.      Don't you mean the empowerment of the female body or whatever shit that was?    You don't still believe that crap, do you?   The second half was utter shit, and not even in an entertaining way. I had to force myself to finish it.   Never did to begin with     Not Gamagoori x Mako     Meh, only the first 4 episodes did it for me. Satsuka vs Ryuko #1 was the only legit good fight in the entirety of their battles/whole show.    I only watched KLK because they're so B E S T E S T         Kill La Kill was a fun show to watch with /a/ while it was airing with a few memorable characters but not without its own problems. The pacing and resolution in the second half in particular. The ending was incredibly rushed.   It's definitely worth a watch but its not something I'll probably ever watch again.    It's babby's first anime and one of those anime that normie's claim to like to seem "legit" and "with it" like Shingeki. It's ok.  Only good thing to come out of this show   My nigga    tfw no big beautiful brown boy to love and make little moccachino children with    Why is so perfection? Is it the shark teeth?     Your taste is so shit, please die    you will never have fun in KLK threads ever again   I will never be the same again     This will never be you  JUST     Shit taste   Please die   It sure is summer.       Its her  everything        tfw no klk2 set in an alternate universe where ragyo has to save the world from her evil incestuous lesbian daughters        straight out of /v/   with 10 anime unders his bealt    he shitposts on /a/      Kill la kill is my favorite anime  the following are other shows that I have watched.  -pokemon -Yu gi oh -digimon -dragon ball z -evangelion -gurren lagan  how does me posting on /a/ make you feel?                no more electric shamisen intensifies       no naruto    no one piece   1/10 for making me reply       a man can dream    I prefer a season 2 where the crew has to go to space on the Naked Soul Space Battleship Yamato style. They go to fight the life fiber infected aliens preparing an invasion of the solar system. Ryuuko fights wearing a revealing spacesuit because she can breathe in space, and does this while slowly piecing together Senketsu before realizing the power of friendship was inside her all along, and learning to control her massive tits in 0 G. Satsuke controls the bridge of the ship while Tsumugu and Gamagoori fight off boarding parties. No less than two of the aliens will be suggestively shaped tentacle monsters. Sanageyama and Nonon get to play space fighter pilot until they unite the ships into a giant robot. Mako steals the enemy's spaceship and pilots it into a new primordial life fiber asteroid, knocking it into the sun and releasing the aliens. Everyone hugs.    muh niggu    why are satsukifags the most normal of the bunch?     KLK threads   le ebin summer boogeyman  double hue, just for you anon just for you        I like KLK and I like shitposting. does that make me a bad person?  During Ryuuko's free fall she was really just gonna hit the ground and die wasn't she? It seemed like she accepted death until that Satsuki light started flickering. I'm sure many /a/ posts were about the show ending in an orgy due to the naked pile up      tfw ragyou didn't mind control satsuki and ryuko at the same damn time *future voice* and force them to have lesbian sex with each other.    tfw   they end up breaking ragyou's mind control halfway through but the scissor sisters still eat each other out till they come      Pervert. Through there is a doujin where she does just that.    I can't post it because I'm at work, but pretend I posted the "circle of purification" diagram. You know the one.    yooo Japs read my mind and shit. I need that fam.  also I have a feeling future synced up with klk would be godlike.     meant to post to<br/>    wrong post again fuck my shit up meant<br/>    Does it end consentually?    it better    hook us up if you got it please   I hate it when people say that someone acted upon my dreams and shit and when I say can I get some of that they ignore me ;_; like my childhood man ;_;  Ragyo grows two dicks, fucks Satsuki and Ryuuko so hard they get so embrassed their goku uniforms fall off into the sea, Nui joins in pegging Ryuuko while Ragyo takes Satsuki with both life fiber cocks, the sisters pass out from the double rape and wake up in a cage a month later, the worlds dominated by clothing but neither care as they're mind broken from the dickings Ragyo gave them and go right back to double cock mom, the end as Ragyo makes them cum once more.   Nui is the same as Ryuuko yet she is treated like complete shit. It's not her fault she was raised by a batshit crazy molester.    Nui is a retarded test tube baby not even human.     She's not a monster, just a confused little girl.     Ragyo queefed on some life fibres and Nui is what grew out of it.    We got that fucking Satsuki rape scene   cutest girl even got her on ED   let's discuss who best girl is   I can already tell you are the type of person with the absolute most bottom tier of taste and judgement  Opinion invalid  KLKfags live up to their name, the show itself is mediocre and sloppy in execution            It doesn't matter how she was born, she is still has a soul.     The problem with Kill la Kill was it was too bipolar. It started off whacky and absurd but then started hashing in random bits that were way too serious for the atmosphere it started with. This combined with the off pacing made the show hard to watch if you tried to actually take it seriously and by the time the life fiber plot fully unfolded many weren't sure what to think.   Also there were a lot of parts that could've been skipped over or where neglected. Nudist beach was a mess, the field trip arc was mostly pointless, and Senketsu didn't have a good reason to die other than Trigger wanting to force a bittersweet ending.        she is still has a soul   Fuck me. You know what I mean.       She has no soul. She's a life fiber golem.     That's bullshit and you know it. She is obviously affected by how Ryuuko is able to integrate into society.       b-but it was fun! you just hate fun!       I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good  Wait until you finish episode 17. The ride never ends.          late fag   probably watching dub version   not  even  once         Never fails to make me smile    You could watch 60 shitty shows and it would look like a 9/10 though. Quality over quantity man.     Implying Takarada alone makes the dub worth watching  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N26<wbr>wnyWmg5M</wbr>  [ ]       Kek la Kek   good       It's pretty amazing how this show can go from 'as good as TV anime can get' to 'an absolute fucking trainwreck' in such a short amount of time.    I truly need an anime version of this.    Anime is fukcking dying.  Nobody watches it in japan, weebs watch it in west but never pay for it.  The industry is going under, and shit like KLK and space dandy, good as they are are plummeting in favor of kawaii garbage that doesn't do well to begin with.        was a shit version of TTGL with the main theme literally being that nothing makes sense  It was TTGL about girls growing up.  A lot of it made a lot of sense if you had a realistic view and contact with females and a sex life      Scrapper shitposts across multiple boards I see.  I guess cancer spreads.     How can I marry Ryuko /a/?   You have to be a 2D sailor uniform and bleed all over her. You might have to become a star too.     so let's discuss who best girl is and why it is Ryuko~   /a/ truly has major shittaste       kill la kill was good in the first half   I love this meme.      It was very entertaining with the hype and streaming it with /a/. But there is no rewatch value, and not even something to talk about.     holy shit my brain is broken because I just smelled weed when I saw your pic even though I haven't smoked in a year.    KLK was ENJOYABLE but it wasnt GOOD or QUALITY anime    Who said anything about the first half?    0/10     Satsuki   rape scene   Thank you for giving me the impetus to finally watch it.       It's not worth it the rape scene is exaggerated.     mfw people watch KLK unironically      watching something ironically  I'm slowly getting there, I'm slowly getting  TRIGGERed  by all these autists      60 shows  That's enough for a lifetime, what the fuck is wrong with you?    OP here, just finished episode 24 and the whole Super Saiyan Ryuko fighting in space and senketsu dying-shit was really off. It felt like they never new how ro end it and wrote this shit after prodcing episode 23. But still overall watching this series was worth it, clearly a 8/10, could be better, but they just fucked up too much of it, Still the epilogue was really cute just like Satsuki's new haircut. This really wasn't half as bad as people suggest it would be in KlK threads.   Sister cuddle and scissor attack were the best parts of that lame finale.    OP, do yourself a favour and don't watch special episode '25', just take 24 as the ending even though it was lackluster.     special episode '25'  wait what? Is there more, isn't 24 the last episode?     Satsuki x Resolve is OTP, fag.    Yeah but I found it incredibly unnecessary. The shows quality is like a sin graph fluctuating all over the place, the last few episodes were around the peak but episode 25 just feels really out of place.    It's a special. Unecessary like that other anon said.       Pretty much this. A fun watch (especially with /a/) but that's it. Also below standards production values, save for one of the best Sawano's OSTs in recent years.       I just watched it and it really was unecessary, thank god that they didn't use it as a regular episode. But there's one thing triggering me  that senketsu was confirmed to be alive in space and at the same time in ryuko's heart, senketsu's death was shit-tier, but with this they made it even worse.  And pic related was a disgusting design.       Best boy and best girl still together.   bad end   It's princess tutu end, it's one step away from the good end.      *holds up spork*  it was a good retelling of TTGL from a female perspective. also, the ending was pretty solid by anime standards.    TTGL from a female perspective  I'd personally give that award to Diebuster, KLK was too ham-handed in its depiction of, well, everything.  On the other hand, it's not like TTGL was ever known for its use of nuance so I guess it is an apt comparison. I just thought Diebuster handled the more somber and morose aspects of the female perspective better. I mean, the last couple episodes were downright depressing at times.       Satsuki will never star in her own better anime  There is no justice in this shit world     field trip arc  When was that? I think I might have repressed it.     Rescue Senketsu arc    I really wish to see continuation to their sisterly love.      Scrapper has a different opinion   H-h-he most be shitposting!   Bugger off         but its not something I'll probably ever watch again.  Because you only get to watch it with /a/ once in your lifetime, and you can never go back to the past and relive that which was good.   ;_;       hahaha things will never get better and just continue to deteriorate until you finally end it    It is what it is.    I'd watch it    8/10 right off the bat, probably be a 10/10 after seeing it for myself     But the majority of /a/ loved it  Where the fuck are you idiots coming from?      Code Geass  /a/ still overwhelmingly likes Code Geass.   And with Gurren Lagann  /a/ still likes Gurren Lagann.   Madoka  /a/ still overwhelmingly likes Madoka.  I think you're a retard that doesn't have a reliable overview of the majority opinion on /a/. You see a hate thread, and several responses agreeing with the OP, and suddenly "/a/ hates X".             late 2013, early 2014 when there were multiple watch threads every Thursday    Do you remember what those threads were full of? It was a hype train. People were excited about it.   By the end, very few actually thought it was good.      Nah, people were enjoying the show for what it was. Even after, it had a reputation as a fun show. But then some autists decided it was popular and therefore terrible    I remember seeing a lot of negativity in the airing threads. It felt like a majority of the impressions were negative, too.    They were. I don't know what he's on about.    No more than normal imo. This is /a/ we're talking about, never happy with anything     /a/   enjoying  Yeah, that never happened.       /a/ is one person     Anon, it's just you, me, and the Ft. Bragg NSA botposting program. We're all there is. I thought you knew this.    It's a strong 4/10 for me    What makes it good, please explain? A decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene do not make a series good, by the way.      A decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene do not make a series good  for you      be different anon browsing thread   see this    realizes now why I could never get past the 'I'm not a robot' checkbox without help       I've seen about 340 and my rating for it shifts between a 7 and a 8?    Was getting baited a part of your plan?   This show had a lot of potential at first the beginnign episodes had good animation and the semblance of what could be a good story if put together well.  All that goes out the window around episode 12 or 13 and it becomes a shit show shoveling weeb bait into the mouths of the lowest demoninator of anime watcher mouthbreathing autist fans. The side characters become useless, and lesbian naked yelling girls are the predominant force to what in the end is the most retarded plot ending I've ever seen. The animation becomes lazy, the fights even lazier, and everyone gets stupid powerups and transformations with no thought whatsoever.  It had potential, but at the end I felt like I was duped into sticking around until the end and it was a total waste of time. You should be ashamed you're on episode 19 and still like it you retard        I was only pretending to be retarded, it was all an act  okay anon    make way for best boy  after Gama of course     You should be ashamed you're on episode 19 and still like it you retard   you should be ashamed of liking something that I don't like  Are you an actual autist? Like a legit one?      Gama might be best boy, but best MAN is unquestionably pic related    impressive resolution  and dubs     Remind me what is retarded about ? Is it the amazing repeating digits?     And now available in non-thumbnail, too!   <br/>    ruining the bane post    thinking I was the other guy   Fine then I'll just go sit in the corner        There is no shortage of shows with those three things. Its nothing new.   Mako is best girl, discuss    Godrobe   erry time      Are you some sort of idiot? Can you read that post again, maybe? There's a question and a statement in that post. The question is simple "why is Kill La Kill good?", I'm sure you understand that part. The statement is also very simple. It states that "a decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene" are not enough to consider a show "good". This ties in with the question and serves to limit the possible answers by disregarding certain points right away.           It states that "a decent opening, cute girls and a rape scene" are not enough to consider a show "good".  for you     Anon pls. I'm fucking agreeing with you, sperglord.    It's summer. What are you expecting, you fucker?    =(   It was ok but the ending was awful.    liking Imaishit ever   Confirmed garbage taste.       Using emoticons on an image board  I hate you, with all of my hate.      calling anime a medium   If something is good, it's good. If it sucks, it sucks.      It has already been 7 years, when is this summer gonna end?   Ryuuko's and Satsuki's VA's are great at screaming, Especially Ryuuka's with her final attack in the OVA.    being on /a/ while having some sort of taste  you are doing it wrong, there is a reason why people call 4chan a shithole and it's not for meme purposes     Can confirm. I loved the shit out of KlK but after the show ended and the hatebase hit fever pitch I didn't see much point in participating in the inane shitflinging.    Why hasn't anyone uploaded the BD version with dubs? That's been out for a month.    237 posts   117 poster  I'm genuinly impressed     You could say the exact same thing about the early episodes, kill la kill was never good.      Shame he's a useless cunt.       Useless   the only one to defeat life-fiber having fuckers while none of his own, including Ryuuko   one of the only fighters who doesn't rely on super powered clothing   Actually succeeds in engaging Nui alone without getting absolutely rekt   drives a cool ass motorcycle           https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=siA<wbr>biwPyccg</wbr>  [ ]   Best guy coming through  The only good thing to come from Kill la Kill was the porn,and anyone who insists otherwise is wrong.    tfw Ryuko is bi  Man she blushed a lot around this nigga while going on a date with mako and teasing Satsuki, I don't even know who the OTP is anymore     If it's so good then why is there so little porn of Disco hair turning her daughters into lesbian sluts?    Because Disco hair is the worst girl.     blushing means you're sexually attracted to someone     Because that was pretty thoroughly covered by the actual show    he was "naked" and approached her several times, making her blush everytime, which means that she saw him as someone attractive. That's simple anime logic. Why are you this autistic?    Glad you're enjoying it.      I just finished episode 16 and this series is so fucking good.  Except it isn't? Try watching more than 20 anime.    i liked it   blurays where     ok pls post the anime that you think are good and I judge your shittaste   <br/>   It's Senketsu, he's her one true love and soulmate. Ryuko's, Senketsu's, and Satsuki's seiyuus all ship it.    Boku no Pico is really good, you should check it out.    Nice punctuation and capitalization.  pls  Fuck off back to whatever shithole you came from.       &gt;what     Shit taste.    a bunch of offboarders incessantly shitposting is indicative of /a/  No you fucking moron. "I post on/a/ twice a year for some seasonal shitposting epic anime." Doesn't mean you're part of /a/. It's the same fucking thing that happened with TTGL.        I feel like you watch English dubs because "it's easier for me to follow".    You're worst girl   Plastic Memories: elevens are coming to crush and destroy our hearts.  While I WANT TO BELIEVE like all the diarytheoryfags, I think they may be going for the "they confirmed their feelings, were parted and never saw each other again" nipponese romance ending.  So, what are your bets? Here's mine:  sad goodbye 75% tsukasa suffering 10% diary-recall 10% michiru steps in 5%           Tears in rain ending   BDrip of volume 1: http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>04628</wbr>     Thumbnail makes it look like she's crying blood.   You can only hope ;_;  It'll probably be a tear jerking ending.   Don't worry. I'm sure Isla will still be watering her plants.   Yeah. Silly Isla will be watering her plants like usual...  With all our tears in the afterlife    We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     I was about to make the thread. I'm looking forward to it too. Chapter 5 hopefully will be good.    It does sound good but it's sad this could be the last summary thread   Good news, the translator is going to translate volume because the summary isn't that detailed this time. I guess that's the end for this drama.   You know, that pisses me off. It's a childlish behavior. But well, I don't wanna cause any more trouble than there is now.    I know but at least we are getting a translation and considering he is the only translator working in DAL we are lucky.    Well I can understand why. Too detailed kind of kills your motivation due to it being pretty much already done. It's why we asked the guy summarizing this to keep it concise. The only part I want in real detail anyways is the Mana section.    but a summary it's no the same as a fully translated novel. Summary anon summaries are good but they still lack some details    and we still need a translator for the short stories.   Waiting.   Gotta day, Kotori's date was great. Yoshino and Natsumi's date are a close second best. Other dates were alright. My least favorite is Miku so far though.     I thought it was better than twin, she actually behaved somewhat normal and didn't go gull retard over Shiori as usual.    Free translations are a bit like the game cracking scene. It's not entirely about providing a service or making a statement, it's about being the first person to do something. Threatening not to translate over too-complete summaries (among other things) is a way of staking a claim.   time for action   Why not translate something else then? Like side stories.    We still have to wait for summary anon  retard     Could be lack of access, but more likely it's lack of interest. If there's other stuff a free translator would rather share, they'll work on that. It's not like they're getting paid.    There is another translator in that forum but he only translates side stories about Kurumi.    I'm ready for the Tohko bullying   OVA any day now.   After season 3.   Yoshino and Kotori dates are the best so far, Miku and the twins dates were weak, Natsumi date was alright.   I don't mind yuri rapist, I rather like that sort of thing. Main issue I always have with Miku is the lack of connection to Shidou. Their interactions rarely click together.    Well that's the problem, the twins who are supposed to be closer to Shidou especially Yuzuru didn't interact with Shidou at all whereas Miku did a decent job.    2 threads  fug, which one    This one has more replies and no waifu wars so far.     no Origami     Fuck, forgot about her. Origami date was also good and her interaction with her other self was interesting.    Still dreaming, anon. It's better than expecting nothing.    Wasn't that the joke? They assumed that their way of attracting Shido had to involve one another when it did not. It wound up being Shido's kink, though.   I can't believe how ass season 2 looked. Especially now that I'm looking at the LN art. Jesus christ   No, they just misunderstood what Reine said.    LEARN TO USE THE CATALOG YOU FUCKING NEWFAG      <br/>          and you realized that just now? You don't even have to read novels for that, just compare S2 art to S1.    Origami is the best date by far anon.  No, Kotori is the worst next to Miku  We need more tohko raep         linking to your dead thread  We are actually discussing stuff in this one.      waifu wars   you fucked that m8       discussing stuff    Posting without even reading the LN   KEK, fuck off secondary also get reported.       Holy shit anon, you are slow.     Waifu war bait topic  Even if I would agree with it, that is a bad topic.     Sorry, we thought it was a bait thread for our sake    or it still is?       Just ignore the shitposter guys      Samefagging OP trying to save his secondary thread.       "no"    That's what I mean. They assumed "ice cream kiss" meant to appeal via twincest power. They were wrong, but they were right at the same time.    You better be trolling. Top 3 dates are Kotori, Yoshino, and Origami. The order doesn't matter so long as they are in the top 3.     samefagging  Look at the posting times and stop shitposting     You're trying too hard and your butthurt is showing because people like this thread over yours.    but that wasn't the point. They were supposed to interact with Shidou like the other girls did.   DAILY REMINDER ELLEN IS A CHEAP WHORE WHO GET BUCKETS OF WESCOTT SEMEN ON HER WOMB EVERY DAY.  So out of curiosity, what do people think the last two Spirits are going to be like? Personality/powers.    Kotori is the worst next to Miku  What? Why? It was short yeah but she showed good chemistry with Shidou     Here we go again, shitpost thread.    Strictly speaking, they're supposed to get him excited. The other girls are using date tactics (except Origami, lol drugs) while Yamai went straight for the dick.   Reminder to ignore the bait posters.    Same 12 IP's   Samefagging with the same IP number trying to save this shit too hard      Hoping the new Spirit from the upcoming movie will be canon and make it to the main story in the LN. She's too much of a seemingly kuudere loli qt to pass up.    This    Just ignore him    Now the thread is shit, thanks to OP who doesn't even read the LN.    by interacting with him. I don't know why you think it was a just when it's clear they just misunderstood everything and Yoshino is the one who was straight for dick.    I thought it was maybe the best, it was the only one who "won" by following her strategy from the start to the end and wasn't help by hazard and luck.   Natsumi was the funniest and cutest after that.      She isn't canon m8.    Now you can't prove that    Phantom = Rinne, Mio = who knows    Check the main cast in the official site, Natsumi is nowhere to be found and this Mayuri girl didn't appear in her arc.    Nah, Shido even agrees that he's already in a state where kisses would seal him. The challenge he made is for the girls to excite him, he never specified how, so long as it's exciting. That's why Origami succeeded by drugging herself and being honest, and why Natsumi could succeed via wardrobe malfunction.  Yoshino wasn't even aiming for a win via eros, she just prepared to have her swimsuit stripped off.    the only one who "won" by following her strategy from the start to the end  This is a good point. Miku had it together, smart girl.          Her name doesn't fit in the main plot.         Samefagging talking to himself   12 same IP    66 post of the same person           but both Origami and Natsumi still interated with Shidou, see the difference? The twins dates was bad because Shidou got excited by just looking at them and that was all, at least Miku was prepared. It's like winning a contest by luck.    OP from the other thread being asspained enough to try to the ruin this thread by shitposting and calling everything samefag   Friendly advice. Ignore this guy.     Yoshino did the same and unlike the other girl she had a trump card.    Nice b8 m8, keep trying OP.    They ALL have won by luck, except Miku. Origami drugging Shido wouldn't have excited him in the same way her drugged honesty did. Natsumi losing her clothes made Shido excited more than her act did. And seeing the twins make out over ice cream... actually wait, they won when they offered to let him lick the melted cream off of their bodies, didn't they?    We're trying to ignore him outright.        That's what we are doing.      Now I am saddened. What a waste of god tier design.       god tier   just a mishmash of animal body parts   What good is that?       Not really, Yoshino had a plan and Reine did say Shidou's exitement was close to 90 then DEM attacked. Kotori managed to win Shidou with that one line.    Her spirit form is a clusterfuck of wings though.    She looks good in uniform, but I do think she looks retarded with all those wings.    She just looks generic without her AstralDress. More specifically, a bleached Kotori.    by that logic then almost every Tsunako must look generic.    Glad you pointed it out.    and Natsumi looks like a green haired Yoshino, this is not new with Tsunako designs.    Well, they all share the sameface after all.    Chapter 5: Spirits' Dance  - The flash of swords fight are seen in the sky. Ellen is using her high-powered laser blade &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; to block an attack from Mana's &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt;. Ellen used the opening after blocking Mana's attack. Mana quickly evaded and countered Ellen's attack before she could release her next one. - They have been continuing this exchange for a while. While Mana's &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt; that covered a real blade with Magic Power is not as powerful as Ellen's &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; which manifested the blade using Magic Power alone, but its lower Magic Power consumption allow Mana to better engage in a long battle.  - Since nobody in this world could match Ellen's Magic Power output, Mana decided to fight with Ellen with her techniques instead. Mana keep attacking Ellen without break. However, even now there is not a single wound on Ellen's body. - However Mana's objective since the beginning is not to defeat Ellen, but to buy some time until Kotori and others succeed in saving Shidou. - When Mana is thinking that she could buy enough time for them if she keep this pace, that moment, the &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s facility below her started illuminating and a ray of light is released to the sky. Mana feel a shock wave from her back.  "…What!?"  - Mana widen her eyes. Even though the shock wave did not blown her away thanks to Territory, her attention diverted to her back for a second. And spit moment is enough for Ellen to give her a fatal attack.   "You're full of openings." "Ku —"  - Mana blocked the attack but she couldn't completely cancel the power of it and got thrown to the ground. She quickly use her Territory as a buffer to absorb the impact. The ground is then wrapped like there is an invisible ball pushed onto it.  "Ku… you've done me. …But what was the earlier?"  - Mana said that and looked around her surroundings. She then choked at Shidou who is floating on the air, covered by the light of Spirit Power.                       It's time    Is he going to Kamehameha again?    Oh shit.    Alright here we go    Where the fuck is the Fraxinas? fighting those robot things? Also it's happening!     wrapped  warped?    Miku is worst girl   Please, plase!!!! Shidou, show some strenght now!    Welcum back    Fuck off.    Read the LN.    Being repaired, isn't it?    I hope, or even better a spirit bomb.    I guess Ellen is too strong even for Mana and where are the jobbers anyway?    but Reine said she and the crew are going to stop DEM attack I was expecting a comeback or something.    I don't want it to end    How about the SPECIAL BEAM CANNON?   okay I'm done now. How bad is Shido about to get wrecked?       He's going berserk so I doubt he will do the speam light beam, not even Ellen can stop him now.    I think you mean  how bad is Ellen's pussy about to get wrecked?      She said they had a plan for if DEM interfered, and it's Mana. Who was buying time for girls to suck their Spirit power out of Shido's mouth one by one.  Who instead came out to flirt with Ellen. Aggressively.      Oh well, maybe I expected too much from these guys but Mana is in danger now    Hopefully, Ellen is getting rekt this chapter.    Yeah, fuck ellen     It's pathetic how such a big organization as Ratatsokr only has one battleship.     It's an all-volunteer staff of perverts, there's no way they're going to have a magitek battleship fixed in a month.    Mana can't die, she is too important and must be saved.    I would imagine that it's also a chore to build such a large Realizer, let alone an airship to accommodate it.    Why not just get another ship? It seems like DEM has more than one but what about Ratatoskr.   I hope Ellen dies.   or maybe the lack resources and funds. DEM has an army of wizard and those robots while Ratatoskr only has Mana and the Fraxinas.     final boss   dying this early      Please tell me she isn't the final boss. that's pretty pathetic if so    DEM also has the AST but no one remembers them.    She isn't, I'm just saying she is the right hand of the final boss so I doubt she will die.    DEM is a large multinational corporation run by an eccentric evil genius. Ratatoskr is a secret organization with quarreling private backers. Huge difference in the relative available resources.     Westcott is the final boss or Phantom if it turns out she is actually evil.     Except Wescott isn't the only high ranked member in DEM and it doesn't look like he shares the same ideologies.    Good, doujins when?    I do.    No, but he is the highest ranking, and when his people get out of line he has the means to force them to follow him again.  Elliot has nowhere near as much control over his own people, and is more dependent on them, which is why they can make plans to attack Shido and he can't shut it down.       Probably never t.t     I thought Elliot was only one of the funders of Ratatoskr but not the main boss.    Could be, I assumed he was the founder/Chairman.    Rape doujins    I think it was also stated Ratatoskr has corrupt member as well in the first 4 volumes.   Kotori is a traitor   I hope next arc has more Mana    Is that Reason they thought a plan to kill Shidou knowing he is the only one who can seal spirit?    You're still forcing that?    She accepted the mission to kill Shidou, that's an act of treason to me.    "Nii-sama!?"  - Shidou then turned his eyes toward Mana. Shidou looked absent-minded, his conscious is vague, as if he has been drugged with something. Shidou then open his mouth while looking at Mana,  "Ah — Mana. *I'm glad. So you were fine.*"  - Shidou said that to her with a gentle voice. Mana knitted her eyebrows feeling something is off at what he just said. On the surface it sounds like Shidou is worrying about her body. - That is understandable, since at this very moment, Mana is still fighting with Ellen and got a serious blow from her just earlier. - However — for some reason, Mana thought that what Shidou said just now is not only that. Shidou then unconsciously continue his words,  "I was… worried about you. Ever since you've been kidnapped by those DEM guys… but I'm glad… I'm really glad…" "Kidnapped? Nii-sama, what do you mean?" "— Where… is *Mio*? Didn't she helped you out?" "What are you talking about, Nii-sa —"  - Mana stopped her words. Mana suddenly feel a pain in her head. She push her forehead with her hand and frown. She knew this is not just a headache. — The moment Shidou said "Mio" a scene she never seen before started flashing up in her head.  "T…This is…"  - Mana saw a scene in her head changing like a camera shutter. The park where she play with her friend. The teacher teaching in the class. Her birthday where Shidou celebrate for her.   And — the back of a girl with long hair.  "Ah…"  - The moment Mana saw that in her head, she feel her view is flashing on and off. For some reason, Mana couldn't remembered the girl's face. She knew she know her, but —                             - And that was when something interrupted her thought. Mana heard Ellen's voice from above her,  "— Lost in your thought in front of me? You underestimated me a bit too much."  - But that was already too late. Ellen already swing up her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; next to Mana. Mana quickly tried to concentrate, but she can't make it in time. She prepared for the pain from Ellen's laser blade. - Before the laser blade could reach Mana, the Spirit Power that covered Shidou swelled up and stopped the Magic Power blade. Ellen make a dubious looks at stare at Shidou irritatedly.   "— Itsuka Shidou. Don't you looks wonderful now. Even though I don't know what happened, I can see why Ike is wanting you that much."  - Ellen lift up the tip of her lips. However, in contrast to her, Shidou only make a grim looks,  "D—E…M…!"  - Shidou started breathing heavily and howled like a beast.   "U — Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"  - The next moment, the Spirit Power that curled around Shidou increased its intensity and blown away both Ellen and Mana who were nearby.   "…!" "What!?"  - Mana used her Territory to absorb the impact and stopped mid-air. She raise up her voice,  "Nii-sama! What is this! And what was earlier — who is Mio-san!?"  - However, Shidou didn't replied back to her. He only continued growling like a beast. Even though Mana wanted to ask him more about it, the person confronting her right now is the world's strongest Wizard. She can't let down her guard even for a second. Mana grind her teeth and averted her eyes away from Shidou.                              Oh shit, he remembers?     Ellen getting rekt soon      Shiiiit      At least this confirms Mana does have a past.     BASAKA!     long hair  So Phantom's name is Mio, huh?     SHOCKING TRUTH    Prolly? it might be about something like the case when Origami during the world that what changed like, her memories on hating spirits appearing if she senses a spirit power. I guess in Shidou's case it triggers with DEM?.... There might be a case where we get a changing of the past that lead Shidou's memory and Mana's memory to be wiped out. Luckily Mana had that photo of her to remember Shidou.   I guess this Mio is phantom? or might not be.       Holy shit!      Fuck, now we have even more questions than before.      Different girls m8s. Phantom is free but this girl is captured.     That also works with the "this time I'll get shit right" stuff phantom was saying.     &gt;And — the back of a girl with long hair.    &gt;Nii-sama! What is this! And what was earlier — who is Mio-san!?"    Plot Detected. I repeat, Plot Detected!          Either Phantom or the second Spirit. If Mio was supposed to help Mana, it makes sense that they'd both have been captured.     Where did it say Mio was the captured spirit?     First Phantom and now this, are they the same or just a coincidence we can't see the faces?     That's "Rio" no "Mio"     The spoilers     The fact that they took the effort to point out the long hair thing both here and with Toobitchy makes me lean more towards Phantom.    Their names are not even similar and Rio is Shidou daugther in that game.    Yeah, it might be that she used zafkiel that time, thus the reason having a connection with Kurumi, and why Kurumi knows phantom. LEL I just thought of this. Mana wants Kurumi Kurumi wants Shidou Shidou wants Phantom some crazy love rectangle we have here.         WAIT REALLY?!   Could Mio be Shidou's  another little sister?      I know. I just wanted to post a Spirit with Long Hair.      So it seems that before Shidou was adopted by the Itsukas, Shidou and Mana had an encounter with DEM which ended up with Mana being captured and kidnapped and both knew a Mio who probably is a spirit means that Shidou and Mana probably both could use spirit power. At least the both of them are NOT normals.    He didn't remember anything in volume 7, it must be the the high fever and the spirits power going berserk breaking the memory wipe.     Maybe      implying phantom was free   implying phantom wasn't manipulating kurumi with projection powers to break her out of DEM's rape dungeon.      At least Shidou can but there is no implication that Mana can use spirit powers so far considering her condition.   it's that time of day again and remember kids  Kaguya a cutie     Oh. I'm the one who suggested it in the last thread, so I was thinking this was confirmation.   Wouldn't have had the sephira crystals then.       Phantom was also in the past and she has been turning girls into spirits.    Yeah. I was just pointing it out after he sealed Origami, after all he sealed Origami while inversed. It's the first time Shidou sealed a spirit inversed first. (What I meant was, the time he sealed inverse Tohka, that was the second time.) in Origami's case, it's the first time, and it was inversed, might be the reason why the spirit's power is wrecking havoc inside Shidou. Not to mention he sealed Tohka for the third time during the fight with Origami in her Angel form. I guess it has something to do with why the spirit's power is malfunctioning inside him.    No, she is  Shidou's real childhood friend     No, but if you think about it, Mana survived an operation that only shortened her life span to 10 years while Jessica had that same operation and would only live to see the next day. Mana is strange for a human since I see Jessica is more of a norm with this type of operation.     Mission given to her by the higher ups   to me  Glad the retardation starts and stops with you.       (What I meant was, the time he sealed inverse Tohka, that was the second time.)  What?     Jessica's operation was worse, Mana noticed this during their fight she was also using inferior equipment compared to Mana's but the magic energy inside Jessica allowed her to fight Mana in equal terms for a time.    Uhh. I think I explained it less? Sorry about that. First. Shidou met Tohka,(normal mode). She sealed Tohka (normal mode). Second. Tohka getting kidnapped, Tohka went inverse. Shidou sealed inverse Tohka.  Origami's case. Shidou met Origami as &lt;Angel&gt;. Failed to seal, even went inverse. -World Change Shidou met Origami. &lt;Devil&gt; manifested, sealed Origami while inversed.  ..Did I explained it less again? Sorry if I am not good at explaining what I had in mind.               That would be Kotori's nightmare.    Said mission was only if he got to the same point as inverse Origami. IE completely beserk with no way to regain his sanity. He wouldn't be Shidou any more at that point.    I understand but what does that have to do with Shidou losing control over his powers? This was going to happen sooner or later and Ratatoskr knew it.    Sighs*************** Shidou can't seal inverse types... what he has to do is return them back to being normal. The kiss with Tohka is te one which made her come back. In Oriagmi's case, she came back by herself and then Shidou kissed her to seal her powers.   If Mio is Phantom then who the fuck is Material A?   Wait an d see     Sighs***************  Fuck off     That's just a speculation. I think Mio is most likely &lt;Material A&gt; leaving phantom's identity unknown. I think that fits better.     Sighs***************  Faggot.  What Shidou did in both Origami and Tohka cases was trying to get their old personalities back because the kiss doesn't work if the girls is not compatible with Shidou.       It was already established that Kotori's nightmare is Shidou as a full female. Why do you think that she literally went all white eyed when she groped Shiori's breasts and found them to be real?    It's just a dumb speculation, It's clearly stated Mio was captured yet Phantom is free and turning girls into spirits.    And people claim that summer isn't real *facepalm*    What the fuck is wrong with you?    You can have more than one fear anon.    That's what I was implying lol! "Return them back to being normal", how did you translate that?   Miku is worst girl   It's gonna happen sooner or later, I just thought that it might be the reason for it happening. I didn't say it wouldn't happen. I just thought it's the reason why it happened.    Given her locket it was after he was adopted for at least a year.    that Shidou can't seal inverse spirit when he can, the only thing he has to do is to free the girls from the dark energy control or despair in Origami's case. The dark energy doesn't disappear just like that.    True, but that one I described there would be her biggest one. The only other nightmare would be to actually have to kill Shidou.   Anyone remembered that bit about Shidou was in despair the first year he is taken into Itsuka family in volume 1? What if it connects with all these Mio stuff somehow?  They got their personalities back, but they were still as inverse powers, and it's just my speculations, and do remind me cuz I don't know which part they said that Shidou can't seal inverse types.  Cuz if I remember correctly when Tohka was on inverse and she saw Shidou falling to her, she became conscious and she's still wearing that inverse astral dress. There wasn't a point where I remember that it was stated her inverse astral dress grew back to her normal one.     I doubt that's reason, Kotori and the fraxinas were surprised back then in volume 7 when Tohka turned inverse. I suppose they didn't expect to deal with dark spirits.    Alright, understood. But there's no need to insult me. (I say it to the others)    He also was abandoned and separated from Mana.    You're really not from here aren't you?     Rio better be canon or else I'll be upset.     literally who cares though     Yeah, I guess his despair would be about Mana's kidnapping and whatever happened to Mio and that he was powerless to do anything about it.     yeah I guess, they weren't expecting to deal with inverse types.   I can pinpoint the moment a thread will turn to shit, am I a wizard /a/?   Rinne    No, why?    Well, his mind was wiped right after he saw his sister kidnapped and lost his childhood friend, and then he was left behind with the Itsukas.  He probably doesn't remember most of the reason he was sad.  That said I will die laughing if he knew Tohka before.       Yeah, I'm a newbie just been here for 7-8 days. I was the one who made the thread of yesterday and everybody was arguing that I made it too early. I learned my lesson.    and what if Shidou ends up getting all his memories back and decides to spend time with Mana?    Wasn't Tohka confirmed yonger than 1 year?     lol  Literally kill yourself.     Actually I fucked up, thing aren't going well, disregard my post. I hold on the next time.    Nope, you are right. The sword and inverse dress only disappeared after Shidou kissed Tohka in volume 7.    Go fuck yourself. And stay in that shithole where you're from.    Tohka knows nothing of herself except that she suddenly existed. and when she existed the AST attacked her. iirc.    Databook stuff? Because her mind is completely empty of prior knowledge.    What do you mean? I don't see any shitposting in this conversation.    Oh that thread worked out fine though  There's no arbitrary rules about threads. Sometimes they just will be dead and no one posts depending on hours.      I do.    Are you a girl?    Kotori doesn't mind that too much, so long as he spends time with her as well. Mana already treats Kotori as the youngest sibling of the 3(though the reason for that is kinda funny).     woah, you guys sure are edgy and hardcore XD      Toha didn't know about the workd iirc, even Yoshino was familiar with it.     Do you think I'm from Animetsuki, saw the discussion yesterday thruthfully speaking, didn't even know there was a website like that. Alright, not gonna argue with you. I'm leaving already.    Because her chest is bigger, right? but I what I meant is what if Shidou changes after getting her memories and spends more time with Mana than the girls.    Retard    Oh, I see. Well all of what I'm saying is just what a speculation. Unless we really know it from the author, I don't have any right to say it's accuracy.    Because the only thing she remembers about herself is she just came into existence randomly. Every time she appeared there was a spacequake and the AST attacked her. That was her life    world**   Flatori a shit   Mana's locket says otherwise. The Shidou in the picture is 10 he was adopted when he was younger then 9.     Are you a girl?     I wanted to write "thread is going well" but since I have the sun reflexion on my screen I didn't saw shit and didn't correct my sentence.  I'm pretty much the one shitposting now so I will keep quiet for the rest of the thread.    Please guys, avoid getting mad over trivial things and keep discussing the summary.   Yup, you hit the nail on that one. Shidou would most likely split his time evenly with all of the girls though he might insist on Mana staying at the Itsuka house though.  At least in this volume Kotori got to experience not being flat for once, though it was in the form of Shiori to do so.      Was he that age for sure? I thought the locket pic was taken the same year, and then the tragedy happened, and there really isn't much difference between looking nine and looking ten.    What about Mana's picture?     It's very relevant stuff dude.     Kotori said by that time Shidou was already in the Itsuka house.    That's nice wallpaper.    Time travel and the Kaleidostick.  I'd forgotten that.    Needs more Miku pure love    This confirms Shidou and the boy in the picture are the same but doesn't explain why he was with Mana and Kotori.     Wasn't it the same for Yoshino?   Kaguya a cutie  Does Da'at have an inverse form?      namefag  You are getting more autistic. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering Kaguya is also autistic.

Where is Mana living in this timeline?   she still a cutie  When is Shidou going inverse?   Not a spirit    I don't think he can    Play the second game.    Which one? I have so many versions just in case.     Nope.       Retarded slut    Are you sure? Even if he is only half spirit, something should happen if he feels despair while having all that power.    - In the party hall where it is now destroyed by the light of Spirit Power, Kotori raise up her voice asking if everyone is okay while couching at the cloud of dust. The attack earlier opened a large hole in the ceiling and the wall. - Kotori looked around. The Spirits and &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; staff are all safe. The Spirits raise up their voices, "Are you okay~!?" "…W-what was that". Kotori then heard an unexpected voice,  "— Kotori-san!" "This voice… Mana!? What are you doing…!"  - In front of Mana there is Ellen in CR-Unit confronting her, holding a sword. Mana fixed her stares at her and wave her hand to Kotori a little to reply to her. Mana expand her &lt;Wolf's Talk&gt; on her right hand and raise up a voice,  "I'll tell you the story later! For now… I'm leaving Nii-sama to you!"  - Mana then kicked the air and continue her fight with Ellen. Kotori then realized that she was the 'countermeasure' Reine talked about.   "That girl… and she disappeared without even telling me her address…!"  - However Kotori is thankful that Mana deal with Ellen for her. Kotori decided to fulfill Mana's request and looked at Shidou,  "Ah…"  - Kotori unconsciously let out that voice. Over there is not the usual gentle Shidou nor the playboy Shidou from earlier. Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  - The dense Spirit Power that whirled around Shidou is blinking on and off like a pulse. The ground, the air, everything is vibrating in the same rhythm as that pulse. Kotori feel as if everything is resonating to Shidou's power. - Not only that, some part of the Spirit Power around him has been transformed into a screen of light or a piece of metal. It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.                        The normal and inverse one     no white pupils     Nice try     It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.  HAPPENING.     No date for Tohko     "That girl… and she disappeared without even telling me her address…!"  What? Is Mana hiding from Kotori or something?     Slutty retards don't get dates    It's time     Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  Fuck, I want a colored illustration for this.     Nah, looks like even Kotori doesn't know where Mana's living.    He is getting his equivalent to an astral dress but there is no illustration? This is a crime.    but Reine does? That's weird.    Only shiori can be seen in a astral dress    Retard.    Phantom confirmed    The twins got one.    moron.    Reine knows everything there is to know. Can't wait for her arc    Kaguya did nothing wrong    Ellen getting rekt when?    Thats not Natsumi or Ellen     Shidou has unleashed ZA BEASTO mode and called upon his Astral Dress/Armor upon sighting DEM. He wants to rekt Ellen presumably for what DEM did to him in his past.     He's getting an armour or something?    Given Da'at would have the same dress as Kurumi be glad (or not) there is no picture.    We don't how he looks right now but at least we can assume her suit/dress is more than just clothes.    Best twin imo.    Kurumi's dress doesn't have pieces of metal.    The latest version of normal and inverse please     Implying loli Natsumi isn't at least high tier  I'll cut you.     Actually his would be similar to in name as Kurumi's(Elohim vs YHVH Elohim) but the designs would be more like Origami's, Miku's, or Tohka's since Da'at lies on the same branch of the tree that Keter, Yesod, and Malkuth resides on(presumably No. 6 Tipharet would have a similar design as the other 3 spirits in that it would have light emitting from the dress).    She is a bitch, still better than Miku.    This one?    Natsumi is mediocre as hell. Someone the series could honestly just remove and nothing would change     wrecked Shidou's reputation   high tier   Wat       Waiting for Phantom    Close I was thinking the one with the spirits picture on them   Miku is worst girl   Well, you could use that, I guess. Just needs a bit of cleaning.  Actually, screw that. No one besides Tohko and Paper are inversed. There's no reason for everyone else to.      I don't think we have a version with the inverse spirits.   I wonder if Shidou will destroy Ellen now   Natsumi pls    Okay could you still post the angel tree    It seems like Mana is still fighting Ellen but I wonder if Shidou is able to think rationally with all that power.    This is the latest version, right?     no Origmami  No it fucking isnt     Fuck, wrong one.    I saw one with Origami in the crown position.    Someone posted the checklist you can search the pic here     Though we might need to place Shidou into the tree soon into the spot that connects Origami, No.2, and Kurumi.    Makes me wonder whose number six    the 2 should be the same Kurumi's should be YHYH Elohim as well they have shortened a few of the astral dresses names    We need to know his position first and I mean a real confirmation.    Not going to lie, I always thought that was Shido himself.    Phantom    There's indirect confirmation that he is Number 11 with his first name containing the number 11 in it.    Why? The yellow eyes, Shidou being Da'at is still just speculation but he has 11 in his name and the fact he can seal spirits fits with Da'at.    Reine    Rinne    I thought this theory was discarded a long time ago.    Shidou is 2 Mio is Shiori aka Shidou's other half.    If Mio is blonde then it should be her. So far all spirits hair color has match up to their sephirot. The 2 unknown colors are 2 gray and 6 yellow    My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong As I Expected     what does 8man's dick taste like?   Coma cheese   Denialfags not allowed below this line ________________________________    ask saika     It seems like the most positive exchange they've had in the entire series is when Yukino asks Haruno for help during the culture festival when they need to buy time for Hachiman to find Meguri, Haruno refuses because she's confident Yukino won't be able to stand up for herself, but Yukino does just that and takes her by surprise. Haruno even complements her on how it looks like she's changed.   And we went from that to where we are in vol 11.  I don't think Yukino really needs years of self-reflection away from Hachiman and Yui to overcome her problems like some say. She has that found that answer already. She just needs to rediscover it.        Reminder that the code got cracked.    I meant Sagami not Meguri.    Friendly reminder that Yukino has had absolutely no romantic development with the 8man.   Right on man, Iroha's feelings aren't genuine   Where is my Legion?   Genuine    8man is her god. She would give herself to him if he simply asks for it.    Gay isnt wrong at all    Yui's feelings are not romantic    saying "you don't even have your will" is the most cruel thing you can do to your sister.  Can't blame her though, must be frustrated seeing her sister acting that way for more than ten years and just couldn't do shit about it must feel horrible for Haruno, too.      Max coffee    8cum tastes sweet because he drinks MAX coffee    bags of sandy milk and salty coins     continuing from last thread:     because friends never take pictures       lol deluded     But seriously though. If you think that she would go to romantic end and put all of the things she was trying to build up from the start to the trash, then YOU guys are the deluded ones.                   She just needs to rediscover it.  My thoughts exactly. Funny that the right answer had been at the middle point of the series all along. Though I am pretty excited we might go back to that in the last volume or two.     <br/>     because friends never take pictures  They took a lot of pictures in Destinyland but she went out of her way to buy that one expensive picture of just her and Hachiman alone.     I missed this pic.    Do you have a lot of girls who want to be your friend all the time? If so you might be the main character for an anime    Taking a break.    2spoopy      the only one that would know     all the things she was building up to the trash  There are people who actually believe this     Too much denialfags right now, better wait until they get bored    Yukino   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KVk<wbr>ziuwXif0</wbr>  [ ]      Rewinding from my earlier post:    Also, her attempts of romance is clouded by her dependency.   If you want her romantic feeling to stay, her problem stays.    You forgot we are talking about a MAIN CHARACTER OF AN ANIME.     there are people who doesn't read                   You must have missed the notice<br/>    How far are you trying to go to troll, you already got us dude congrats we fell for it    Alright everyone it has come to my attention that this club is tied up in some unspeakable drama that we're all just conveniently ignoring.   That ends now.   We are going to discuss everything on our mind under the following condition:   We will speak honestly, and after all is said and done we will all remain friends.   You may deny this proposal, but if you do then I'll have no choice but to leave this club.   I will no longer allow things to go on this way, so no matter what happens things are going to change.   Make your decisions.           Why do people continue to ship 8man and Yukino if Yukino still loves Hayama?    this guy is still posting      Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's. I know this seems very narrow minded (since its largely a coming age novel) but even though Hachiman is the MC, the overall plot and interactions of the series all boil down to Yukino   Its her problems, her interactions (or lack of) with the characters that fuel the story so that the characters can grow  Hachiman has pretty much rounded out development wise I feel like (what is left for him? getting 100% over nice girls and ending up with a chick?). Yui has a little development left to go but her characterization has never been as pivotal compared to our two loner autists. Meanwhile, Yukino has to undergo the most changes since the series began and we have yet to reach her final growth. And the final volumes are (and the ending of the series) pretty much revolve her development and what she wants to do in her life       Filthy pleb, that's what yui said in the end of Vol 11. 8man consider that's a LIE! not GENUINE, and he CRIED. Learn some moonrunes      Remember she's playing the "tyrant", so even if she said that to Yukino, she might be suffering a hell inside of her for saying it to her own sister. It's like anon said too, she's watching her sister wasting the chance Haruno never had.  To the other anon asking how I "fixed" her, I didn't. She fixed herself. I only gave her a huge push after forcing her to remove her mask and telling everything I thought and then walked away. Next day she opened up with me. It's a process, like a damn rehab.      Why do people continue to ship Yui with 8man when Yui still loves cookie man?   I can't wait for Irohafags to get BTFO so they finally shut up like Yuifags.  It'll be like OreImo all over again.  Ayase best girl ;_;      Nobody has feelings for 8man, he's creepy. Happy?      I will post too      I agree, her past and her relationship with hayama, her mother and haruno are still a mystery.     Are you kidding me. Yui gave 8man a bag of cookie in Vol11.  But 8man call that some kind of "payback gift" and she's nearly going to cry.      Just because people get BTFO doesn't mean they shut up.   Great taste.   I preferred Manami though.        Because she is the main heroine obviously. She needs to be taken care of by EVERYONE.    I was actually okay with the Oreimo end.  Kyousuke admitted he was fucking up his entire life and that he was making a horrible decision. Love isn't rational so admitting that is really all it takes.       yukino   growth or character development  All she does is copying other people. She herself didn't change at all. Her "drama" is bullshit too, since she's just a spoiled kid, who got bullied once. Shit character overall.       Is it just me or does Oregairu now feel more like its Yukino's story more than anyone else's  That's the main point.  It's about a high school Batman saving someone. Everything that happened to him in the past is to prepare him mentally so that he could save her.   That someone is our Ice Queen.        Good Irohasu, everyone!   I thought Manami was alright in the anime but LNfags told me she was literally Satan himself and the reason for all evil in the universe.     liking yuckyno   liking oreimo      The problem was that he rejected all other girls just to fuck his sister once.     Spent most of his time saving the independency autism.   While non-stop flirting with his kouhai.   NTR queen        Ice Queen  More like cold fish.     You got meme'd m9    In love with the dead fish.     Neptuniafag   Shitting on OreImo       once   he really believes this       Even as someone who likes Yukino the most, I am telling you right now that vol 11 slammed the door on Hachiman swooping in wearing the bat suit and saving Yukino. He has explicitly rejected it.  That isn't to say he won't provide peripheral help to her, through emotional support or advice or whatever, but Yukino is going to be the one to stand up for herself. It absolutely has to happen. Or else we're really going to get a 'sour grapes' ending.        saving a picture means watching shit show  Kill yourself oreimoshitter.     It's Vol11 m8, learn some moonrunes, and your meme is trash now.    Not sure if falseflagging or just a retarded yukinofag    And he recognized that he was alienating himself from the others. He still valued it higher than everything else.  Of course it's implied he went on to have a secret relationship with her but he never could have known that would have worked when he started. He took the philosophy of "The flame that burns half as long burns twice as bright"        lol u a troll   That level of delusion.      Do you think Yukino is good at sex?    booty blasted worstgirl fag     Bad on day 1. You'll be cumming faster than her on day 3.     Probably a dead fish first, but then warms up and ends up going at it like a rabbit.  Perfect for 8man       No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Although for some reason I feel her 'stamina' issue is psychological somehow.       Yeah this is true. But he is going to "save" her not doing the hard work for her. He'll probably become to Yukino what Hiratsuka is for him, someone that cares deeply for the other person and gives advice/wisdom  Ultimately, after Yukino tells the other two what her problems are and listening to what the other two (mostly Hachiman think), she'll do what she wants to do and not copy/shadow anyone      Oh great, as if being autistic wasn't enough    She's a virgin, of course not.  Sensei on the other hand,       I was referring to the "8man != cookie man" meme in case you missed it     Damn, that was cute.    You got it backwards. Yukino is not a virgin, while Hiratsuka is still a maiden.    Like a dead fish.    I can't believe you're arguing about the virginity of a 30-something bombshell desperate for marriage. It's not a bad thing that she's experienced you know. It means more fun, few nights cut short.     She was a great character but...     perfect for a man with dead fish eyes.    You are retarded if you think Hiratsuka would spread her legs in desperation.    fewer*    Why does everyone say this as an expression for bad sex. I bet you haven't even had sex with a dead fish.    8man fucks a panda infront of yukino   Yukino gets fucked by the panda   Happy end       you will never marry a hot obsessive sensei      8man fucks a 8man fucking Yukino     people change a lot after go through university. And saying sensei sill a virgin is just ridiculous. She must have serious problems if it's true.  It's a different case with Haruno when she isn't allowed to be in a relationship though.     Reminder that Yukino and Hiratsuka are as pure as snow.   The Aristocrats.    Isn't 8man the panda? So he's fucking himself then the himself he fucked fucks Yukino?     not posting the superior webm version     She's amazing at it.    It can happen.    Does that mean he's getting cucked by the himself that he fucked?    Yahari has the  DEEPEST LORE     Hachiman would suck in bed so they go perfectly together     No best version     Who would have the most sexual chemistry? 8man and Yukino, Iroha or Yui?     Iroha has blown Tobe more times than I can count.    Iroha is for sex Yui is for cuddling Yukino is for cuddling Pan-san      Girls don't need stamina to have good sex    Yukino or Iroha Dead fish and dead fish eyes synergy vs. experienced in sex Yui is too dumb to have sex correctly      Karen replaces Yui in the Service Club, how does the series change?   Guys I kinda liked first season besides the episode where the shitty bitch cried on stage in front of the entire school. Is the second season even worth picking up or does it become Oreimo S2 tier waifu wars?     For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  I don't get this logic. Do people suddenly drop dead after feeling worn out from running? That's basically what you're saying here.     8man fuck hayama infront of yumiko   yumiko fuck yuis dog infront of yukinos car      No. For one thing she has no stamina. She'll be worn out in ten minutes.  Why does everyone assume you just stop going after she's tired?     They didn't read the doujin where even when she ran out of stamina she could still do something  Kinda shows how much these kids know about sex       What?    This is worse. This has /pol/ level hate.         Best ending    You don't need to read a doujin to know that you don't stop functioning as soon as your stamina bar depletes to 0 which is what every faggot with their dead fish meme is apparently advocating here.     too dumb to sex  right, because fucking like an animal requires a literary bent.      Yahallo no more.   Ain't gonna watch it.     Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?    118 / 29 / 39   You guys need to calm down.         Eh? They both like Hikitani-kun!?      NTRing Yumiko  What kind of a sick fuck would do that to such a kind girl?     hnnnnggggggg IROHA OR DEATH     She gets to NTR Yukino's car so it's ok     This has /pol/ level hate  What does that mean?      She must have serious problems if it's true.  No shit? she's still unmarried.    So what do you guys think is Yukimom and Yukino's disagreement/conflict?  1. Yukino studying abroad 2. arranged marriage with Hayato 3. stop education and be a "perfect bride" 4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat 5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  Also, who will reveal it? Hayato? Haruno? Yukino?            Nice, Hikitani-kun! Two hot chicks are after you, lucky dog.     He must be a bit new around these parts    Don't ask, you don't want to start another nuclear bomb shitposting    Still better than waifu wars.    Probably going to same college and following same career path as Haruno.    That's pretty normal for a general. Several threads ago we hit bump limit with only 98 posters.    Yui isn't capable of boiling water, what makes you think she's capable of having sex correctly?    Yukino will be studying abroad, she's in the International Curriculum.     1. Yukino studying abroad  cop out  2. arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  3. stop education and be a "perfect bride"  unrealistic and stupid  4. they don't want Yukino to have a cat  realistic  5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  she wouldn't dare                5. Yukimom wants to throw away all the pan-san merchandise  They say she has schizophrenic delusions because of Pan-san, but she knows what she saw that night.     Why is Yukimom so daft? Does she not realize that everyone has strengths and weaknesses? Likes and dislikes? She should find out what Yukino is actually capable of, what she is suited to do, before trying to control her life.  Once you figure out what her talents are and where they can be best be applied, then you can begin engineering her future and convincing her that it's "what she always wanted to do."        But if its about her career? What do they want for her? Be a politician? And also, why would she disagree to this to the point of moving out?      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2 . arranged marriage with Hayato  will come out of nowhere and cause unnecessary drama and this LN will continue for 5 more novels  Hallo, I'm WW Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand       I think it was mentioned at some point that Yukimom wanted Yukinon to study science like Haruno? This would separate her from her friends so I can see where the disagreement comes from.    Given all the flags we've gotten, I definitely think Yukino is going abroad by the time the series ends  Currently, she is on the same path as Hachi/Yui and before she was just following Haruno's science track. But by going abroad (since shes in international curriculum) she is going down her own path and not copying/chasing anyone. It makes the most sense given what we know  She leaves either in Year 3 (end of the series most likely) or some timeskip ending where she studies in an overseas college        From what I've gathered skimming the LNs, Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college, probably so they can become doctors.  It's just typical Tiger Mom shit. I think Yukimom is actually smart and playing the long con on Yukino, convincing her that the rebellious thing for Yukino to do would be to become a prestigious lawyer.  It's all part of the keikaku.       Now that's alpha.   Certainly fits in with the larger theme of Yukino wanting to escape the shadow of Haruno.   There was some faggotry about Hachiman rejecting Iroha last thread. Is there some truth to it?    My fetish is when a low stamina girl is all tired out but the guy just keeps fucking her because she's too exhausted to make him stop and he just keeps doing it until she's cum like a dozen times and is just a quivering mess lying in a puddle of her own fluids.      B-but that's not possible! You are a guy!      yfw 8man could have done this in the infirmary but didn't because he wasn't assertive enough     What do you think? Just your usual damage control    It's just over-enthusiastic people reading way too much into the writing. If he was gonna reject her it would definitely be way more pronounced and you would know when it happened.     Why would he? Iroha has no feelings for 8man!    He responded to her in a way that was not genuine. Make your own judgement    Is it wrong want to kill a cunt?     That's it? And why doctors? They are a family of politicians right?     Yukino   friends             Yukimom wants both her daughters to pursue science majors in college  Chapter?    YAHALLO  Why is she wearing ropes under her clothes? Is she a pervert?  Now that 8man told Yui to be genuine with her feelings and for Yukino to do things for herself what is to stop a love triangle from forming?    Actually, I want to add another entry:  6. Yukimom wants Yukino to go to a better school but she chose Sobu because  Hayato was there.   Also, about the arranged marriage thing. There are some points that I could support it:   Haruno doesn't want Yukino to get married to Hayato, so she ships her to 8man   8man's monologue of rich people marrying their children for family ties   Yukino gets depressed when she mentioned her mom wants a lasting relationship with the Hayama family              Not that anon but you can reason it out  Vol 6 during fireworks Haruno learned from Yui that Yukinon was going science track and she seemed upset by that (following footsteps). Vol 11 when Yukimom learns that Yuki is going on the lib arts path she starts going on about she is worried about whether Yukino is going on the right path for her future  We also know from Vol 10 that her career path ties in directly with Hayama's. Hayama as we know is going lib arts when he told Hachiman during the marathon. And Yuki even said to Yui/Hachiman that their mother wants a lasting relationship between the two families and one such way was to have both Hayama and Yukino go on different career tracks  That's my best guess and its also why I think Yukino is ultimately going to go abroad when the series is over          She's a slut.    Oh my.     over-enthusiastic people  you spelt denialfags wrong though.     Yukino's feelings for Hayama.     That's why it's trash now, Outdated meme, you live under a rock?     It's probably a fancy camisole.     Yukino   friends  Epic.       I've never known the touch of a woman since leaving my mother's breast  ftfy      Isn't she out of the house before the three even met?     Haruno could have just been disappointed about Yukino copying her choice. And I think Yukinomom would have reacted like that regardless of what she said.     implying that a girl who put on a dog collar without hesitation when given one isn't into kink   implying that if she win she's not gonna have genuine BDSM sessions with 8man      Yui probably. 8man doesn't seem the proactive type at all, so a lover who will just climb all the hell up on him and not quit until they're both sore is going to be the best bet.  Iroha comes in second because she'd be able to tease him into action eventually. With Yukino I just can't see the two of them having a super-active sex life, but by the same token I doubt it'll bother them much either.     I'm just here to say how much I love yumiko    チーン　チーン   Subtle.      based ponkan    How correct should it be when she's about to unleash her 2+ years of sexual frustration on the 8inch?    In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago. But it's just some fancy bra with extra support for her Yuis.     Why does she look like Honk?     Thank you for your idea, now I can pay Eguchi a trip to Thailand   implying WataWata would want to ruin his beloved's perfect body   You're dumber than a denialfag.        normal shirts behaving like latex bodysuits  Gets me everytime     8man fucks komachi infront of taishi   taishi fucks kamakura infront of yukino     8man's reaction to the spoon exchange can be read as a tacit rejection on his part, yes. At the very least it's more plausible than the assertion that 8man was intentionally making a pass at her.       anon fucks logic infront of other posters      yfw, originally WW used childhood promise with key + locket to bind the main trio together.   Then he switched to suicidal dog because Komi knocked his front door.     Iroha is not even a virgin. Why do people like her_   Don't know about sex, but damn the teasing would be NNNGGGHHHH   IROHA OR DEATH btw         In the first LN it was said it was some kind of pendant or locket she was given 10 years ago.   o u        a cat is fine too     Exactly. Just take one look at the outfit she was wearing for their shopping date; she may as well hang a sign around her neck that says "collar me, train me, make me your breeding bitch"   And that's reason #88 why she's Best Girl      SORE ARU!    I already ate Sensei's hymen, along with virtually 80% of Japan's virgins.    more like this?   Mugi-chan is best girl     i wish       Saw this in an /fa/ anime thread. Seems like a poor imitation.    So why is the subject of magic and the supernatural disappearing depicted as sad so prevalent in Japanese anime/manga? I'm no expert in Japanese folklore, but the relationship between the supernatural and humanity is strongly antagonistic, and it's just odd that stories try to make us feel sorry for flesh eating monsters getting bulldozed by human progress.   Destroying nature is bad.  Do you understand yet?     Its nippon boku haram.     I'm no expert in Japanese folklore    the relationship between the supernatural and humanity is strongly antagonistic  The relationship between the supernatural and humanity is strongly fictional and therefore can be antagonistic or not depending on what sort of folklore you have.      It's crazy, it's almost like nature worship was a prevalent thing at some point. Like a different culture or some shit.   Biodiversity is something that we should take axiomatically as valuable.  Biodiversity is our heritage as members of this planet.    Dumping Historie c90 and Vinland Saga c117 raws. Might post something else alongside them, still looking through the issue.  http://www.mediafire.com/folder/4tq<wbr>gm1g0a2qvy</wbr>              What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?   What a lewd loli   Don't open it.   Someone stole your loli and replaced it with an evil twin   What do, /a/?     Fendom, what else?    gross   We're less than two weeks away from the new anime season, which means it's time again to take a good look at what we're getting next season.  Although the regular anime preview charts work as a decent quick look at the season, they don't tell you all the information you need to know. Obviously a lot of this information is readily available if you look for it, but most people are understandably lazy when it comes to getting all the info on every single one of the 30+ anime coming out, so I've done it for you.     This is will most likely end up AOTS if the anime follows the manga faithfully. Plus it will be better than all those garbage ecchi shows.  I can't wait for my deaf baddass, Gigolo, legit Loli, and Brown Semon Demon.             and   Durarara, Gatchaman Crowds insight   Watching these. I expect to actually enjoy maybe half of them.               QUALITY coupled with a style that already looks like game cut ins? I didn't think that I could lose even more faith in that adaption.    Web novels are the worst in tetms of NIPPON BANZAI. The novels are considerably tone down along sidebthe manga but the elements from the novels rear its ugly head from time to time. The LNs are the most sterilized of all removing all of the right wing politics and making it a straight up fantasy story which the anime seems to be following because it already changed the fantasy setting from the novels.     You know how people got mad about how nationalist Mahouka seemed?  More like /pol/ trying to start shit that no one thinks is true. Not even China think it's anything /pol/ claimed to even consider banning in their manga/anime purge campaign.  </blockquote>]
