[ Best Meido Edition.  <br> Best Meido Edition. <br> post worst Maid <br>the least you could do is get things right and post our Outer God maid, or Robot Sniper Maid, instead of the retarded battle mage</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the Adventures of Momo and Narbel, hopefully with lots of Fanart</br>  The only thing that makes me upset about this last episode is that they didn't include the scene where Enri punches the knight that's attacking her in the fucking helmet.<br><br>The scene would be no more than 5 seconds and it sets up Enri's character way better than what they did.</br></br>  <br>just like how her boytoy has the talent to use any magic item, she obviously got Tactical Genius™ if how fast she got levels in general and commander are anything to go by.</br>  Papa Heinz Ketchup makes a Pleiades Event.<br>Meido Fightan round robin just bare knuckles wearing lingerie chosen by Heinz sama, no offensive spells just buffs.<br>Winner gets complimented and becomes Momongas new companion, Narbel needs to win to maintain companion status. <br><br>Who'll be the wiener?<br> <br> inb4 this becomes a doujin </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no contest Solution(Shoggoth/Ubbo-Sathla) is immune to melee combat</br>  <br><br>if one ignores Solution then Lupusregina Beta or Yuri Alpha would win as both are spec'd melee to Narbel's mage</br></br>  I want to live inside Solution.  So, any moonrune fags want to spoil volumes 6-9?  <br><br> albedo lusts for dick <br> demiurge misinterprets bones and vice versa <br> shellchair chairs <br> people die <br> some other people don't <br> war <br> magic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm concerned with how far they plan to get within the 13 episodes of the TV show. The OP shows off a bit of the climactic battles of both Volume 3 and 4, however 13 episodes isn't really enough to do more than 2 volumes if they want to do the books justice. The problem is that book 3 is when the series starts to get really interesting. Thoughts, /a/nons?  <br>3, nothing makes sense otherwise. Author writes every 3rd novel as climax for reason.</br>  <br>4 episodes per volume with episode 13 being either the end of volume 3 or an epilogue? Seems kind of rushed.</br>  <br><br>It's going to end after the Shelltear fight, right when Bones decides to stomp the Lizards.</br></br>  <br>Welcome to the world of adaptations.</br>  <br>I also would say at the end of Volume 3.<br><br>I hope that we will also see the resurrection of Shalltear</br></br></br>  Stalker, are you here?<br>Can I request stitches for Death Knight and Gazef? Also, webm when Death Knight is rampaging too if possible.</br>  <br>You mean physical damage, I assume? how are you immune to melee combat? as long as you have joints, you can be grappled. As long as you have a body, you can be pushed down, pinned, trapped, or otherwise immobilized<br><br>Uhmm... I think slime maid would win. She is also immune to physical damage but you cant joint lock her or render her helpless through any of those means, I think?<br><br>Grapple/joint lock her and she will just "flow" or squish herself free, and since punches do no damage... yeah, slime maid wins</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And ironically, they are going at a snail's pace</br>  <br>And they still cut out small scenes. Lemegeton's Demon, the simple Fireballs, Albedo considering stealing chair's bath, Ainz's experiments with the perimeter guards, eight-legged spiderblade assassin's intro and orders, and few others I might have missed.</br>  <br>That's what I'm concerned about. I hope they don't cut anything too major.</br>  <br><br>This too .</br></br>  <br>yeah, just waking up, I totally meant physical damage. and Solution as much a slime as Albedo is still an Imp, or Ainz is still a skeleton mage.<br>Slime is just Solution's original race, I like to refer to her more advanced ones because Shoggoths and Ubbo-Sathla are way more badass than a simple slime.</br></br>  <br> eight-legged spiderblade assassin's intro and orders, <br>they still got ordered this ep, just not introduced</br></br>  <br>so far I like the pacing, sure it's slow, but the novel is slow at this part, and going faster would seem rushed</br>  <br>I dont think they will be animated because animating something with 8 legs with sort of coordination its hard as fuck</br>  <br>I meant their new orders from Ainz during the funeral.</br>  <br><br>Plus they are invisible, it definitely won't be animated.</br></br>  I thought Overlord was just a fotm LN, then I beheld Lord Momonga's greatness and I was converted.  <br>Solution is the slime mage.</br>  <br>Yeah, at least the script writer learned for Papa Bones learned from Mahouka (he was junior in the script team there with aniplex) what NOT to do.<br><br>Mainly keep all the internal monologue/narration intact, lest the intended result turning out to be unintentional comedy.<br><br>Onii-sama wasn't called The Answering Machine for nothing during the 9SC arc where he only replied "There is a way", no matter what the problem was.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Op doesnt mean they will animate it all. They could end at vol 2. The anime was made for advertising the LN so just wetting the anime only viewers with op "trailers" is enough. And its working. Overlord LN has been ranking lately.</br>  <br>The thing about it is, there's something for everyone to enjoy unless you really don't like the story's base.<br><br>Like OP MCs? Present<br>Like MCs who aren't moralfags? Present.<br>Like MCs who are intelligent and rational and not prone to having bursts of hotheadedness? Got it.<br>Like MCs who have to fight sometimes with strategy? Got it.<br>Like MCs who are a bit naive but not enough to piss you off? Present.<br>What are you looking for? I bet I can spin it so Overlord has it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well 6+6+1 would be really scretching it. 4+4+4 would work better with 1 ep extra.</br>  <br>This?</br>  <br>I hate gary stu shit.<br>spin it so that it's not.<br>I'll be using that response to explain to friends why this is good.</br></br></br>  <br>And this?</br>  <br><br>for reference Solution is an mind wrecking abomination outside of her human form<br>http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Ubb<wbr>o-Sathla<br>http://lovecraft.wikia.com/wiki/Sho<wbr>ggoth</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Once she loses control of herself her facial features start to wander, at least from what I remember of her appearance in the 3rd volume.</br>  Before I continue reading.

It'll be glorious.</br>  <br>[Spoiler]She lives<br>[Spoiler]and got laid[/spoiler][/spoiler]</br></br>  Still waiting on those volume 9 chapter 2 spoilers.<br><br>Still waiting.<br><br>Still waiting.</br></br></br></br>   mfw I realize the title Overlord probably comes from Ainz being the Overlord of   Death , like the Lizardmen called him.  Anyone know if that sentient orb of death has a larger role in the later books?  <br><br>Thanks.<br>Do you also happen made stitch for Touch Me too?</br></br></br>  <br>All hail Skeletor, Lord of Hamhams!<br> Anime pacing is shit. <br> Log Horizon had more happenings per episode. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit that entire war.</br></br>  <br>I-I can touch you anon?</br>  <br>Early levels are easy to grind out. The curve only gets steeper from here.</br>  post cute albedo  <br> edition <br>Please don't.</br></br>  <br>I think one of the major things that makes it not Gary Stu is the fact the mc realizes that all the guardians worship him and that he can literally do no wrong in their eyes. It seriously disturbs him being held up in such high regard, as well as the role he has a leader and fulfilling his obligation to everyone.<br><br>Not only that, but there is that corrossion of morality and humanity, where his innate lichness is overtaking his former human heart, where he starts scaling up the atrocities he commits, where he only does good acts because his sense of nostalgia of the good old days stirs.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure anon.</br>  <br> pacing is shit <br><br>I wish you ADD faggots that can't stand an anime that doesn't have a fight scene very week would stick to your garbage and leave the rest of us alone already</br></br></br>  <br>if it was stat simple in the New World 30+ wouldn't be legendary.<br>also she was a level 1 farmer(she's 16 in a medieval setting so she's probably been farming in excess of 7 years) until Ainz gave her the goblin horns, after which she gains 5 levels in a very show period of time</br></br>  <br>It's important for each instance of a general to have its own theme.</br>  <br>And that the MC keeps this false image by lies most of the time, while being huge paranoid and tries to plan his movements as meticuously as possible. And tries secures said worries with trusting his monster/demon servants to do their jobs and his own occasional meddling. If not, then just remove the witnesses.<br><br>All the while trying to act like Overlord and proper master (and later a father figure for real).</br></br></br>  Please tell me the next chapter of V5 won't focus on Climb. I'm really getting tired of this little shit. Literally anyone else would be more interesting, but I'd prefer more Ainz or the woman team.  <br>As someone with ADD is resent that. I have absolutely no issues following interesting Anime like Overlord.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure is about Sebas and his waifu</br>  <br>The rest of V5 and V6 will focus on Sebas and  Eight Fingers .</br>  I finally understood the whole chair thing. I don't know If I should laugh or feel sorry  <br>Well chapter cover image features Sebas so he will make his entry at least.</br>  <br>You should feel sorry for  Ainz. </br>  If you were Momonga and Albedo asked you to shit on her, would you?  <br>Yes I do feel sorry for him.</br>  <br>No, because I wouldn't have a digestive tract.</br>  How the strong is Touchme he just 1 hit 4 players in a sec that bullshit MMO right there  <br>Gagaran was fun at least.</br>  <br>no pvp level limits</br>  <br>You can still be able to smell, I would ask to sniff her asshole</br>  <br>Strongest player in the game.</br>  <br>They probably weren't very high level.<br><br>He already had the world tournament armor on so he was level capped and had some OP as fuck gear</br></br></br>  <br> general <br>That is the problem.</br></br>  <br>I love her, and most of the female team really.<br><br>A chuuni, a pair of twins, an old loli and a man in boob plate? Best adventurer team.<br><br>Also is it this novel or the next that Ivileye falls for Ainz?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>6th I believe but not sure.</br>  <br>Volume 6.</br>  <br>I wonder how she'd react if she knew Ainz was a lich.</br>  <br>Obviously that just makes it hotter.</br>  <br>She probably won't care.</br>  <br>Underwear crisis.</br>      <br>His build was so horribly overpowered the devs made it impossible to copy.</br>  <br>take a look at his signature skill.<br>World Break: Attacks target by slashing the space. This skill is superior to the 10th Rank Magic, "Reality Slash". <br>he's a warrior that could break reality with his sword harder than a 10 rank spell</br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me is the winner of World Championship tournament. You can guess the rest.</br>  So, did Ainz revive those two other lizard men?  <br>Apparently he does in the web novel, but they aren't important enough to be focused on again in the regular novels so far.<br><br>Also there are some major turns from the web novel so that doesn't mean they come back.</br></br></br>  It could happen to you!  <br>The enemy players were talking about leveling. Touch Me was all specced out in end-game gear. Once you put in item level, maximum level characters get really ahead of lower level and new max level players in most MMOs.</br>  Anyone here know which volume Ainz  resurrects Clementine?   <br>Here.<br><br>Is that another loli?</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't have her body, the Theocracy does. They have the proper resources for resurrection so maybe she'll be back.</br>  <br>Correction, someone has her body, but it isn't Ainz.</br>  Some spoilers from Vol.9 Chapter 2 and Intermission came out. <br> In the WN, Ainz has about 300 Death knights. In the Vol. 9 LN, he brings out 500 Death Knights. </br>  <br>She seemed to be a lunatic so I wonder who would even bother bringing her back.</br>  <br>spooky!</br>  <br>Thanks Stalker!</br>  <br>We already know that. It came out a while ago.</br>  Questions for those who can read moon.<br> Was there anyone else who actually put up a fight besides Shalltear? <br> Just how strong is Sebas? </br></br>  You know, I just realized that, with how different the WN and the LN are, we will never get to see the maids using 20 Death Knights to move around tables, chairs, and pour down tea,now.<br><br>This makes me a little sad.<br><br>I heard someone said that the rulers from both the empire and the kingdom go to nazarick when papa bones tries to set up a small nation, right? do they get treated to tea at the time?<br><br>I just want to see a Death Knight wearing a maid apron and pouring tea, it's that so wrong?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her former employer or anyone who would want information she she has. Ainz would want to question her as well I'm sure.</br>  <br><br>She's a  vampire that is a few hundred years old. She fought with the 13 heroes. </br></br>  <br>   vampire that is a few hundred years old <br>That's wonderful, thanks.</br></br>  <br><br>It will never get animated anyway. No need to feel bad, just use your imagination.</br></br>  <br> I just want to see a Death Knight wearing a maid apron and pouring tea. <br> Not want to see the Plediaes pouring the tea. </br></br>  <br>Now that we're getting into the political intrigue the show has some potential, but Momonga's vassals arguing about whose pussy got wetter was getting old.</br>  <br>to fight Ainz? all lvl 100 NPC can<br>that include all the floor guardians, the treasure keeper, sebas and they said there's that dragon god in a foreign country<br><br>sebas is a 100 lvl dragon disguised as human just need to give him some gears</br></br></br></br>  <br>No I meant in the other volumes. Did someone else fight him that managed to make him put some effort. Also holy shit Sebas is cool.</br>  <br>No, Shalltear's rebellion was unique.</br>  KOTAE WA<br>DOKO<br>EIEIEIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br><br>SAGASHITE<br>EEEEEEEEEEEEEIEIEEEEEEEEEEEE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone stole his Ainz-approved human waifu, so he needed to put down some niggas.<br><br>Also Climb wanted him to train him after they meet in a cave.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, so he curbstomps everything? <br><br><br> so he needed to put down some niggas <br>This will never be animated. Please tell me it isn't so</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can someone make a version of this but with Papa Bones?</br>  <br>If you believe in the chinks and Papa Bones hard enough, your dream may come true.</br>  <br><br>Here's another one for reference, and Albedo can even be edited in this as well.</br></br>  <br>I actually meant of the He-Man thing but you've opened my eyes to a whole new level of spook.</br>  <br>Well they're only invisible to those that fail the roll to spot them.</br>  <br>He doesn't get a chance to treat a worthwhile opponent until  much later on, stuff that author has only hinted at for now . But now that he came out open and formed  the independent nation of Nazarick by stealing the lands from Kingdom basically,  he might get some "guests", either directly or those that are  sent by the scheming Platinum Dragon Lord .</br>  <br> Who is the Platinum Dragon Lord? An original Yggdrasil player or something? Did he have something to do with the World class item that was able to take control of Shalltear? </br>  <br>I understand the concept of Once Bitten Twice Shy but shouldn't the  Platinum Dragon be confirming that the alien Player Characters are evil before getting rid of them?   He seems more butthurt to me about the fact that the  Six Gods rendered his magic less useful than any desire to protect the New World from these invaders. </br>  <br>Yeah, it strikes as odd choice to be automatically assblasted about everything new.  Who knows, maybe he will come around as better guy if he ever sits down with Papa Bones for a tea .</br>  <br>We can only hope. The author's pretty good at subverting our expectations so it should be possible for an alliance over there, considering the possibility that Ainz  is probably going to create a kingdom for non human races. </br>  <br>Dragons in these sorts of fantasy settings tend to be dicks. Very selfish lot.</br>  So let's say his entire guild said "Fuck it I'm waiting for the servers to shut down" and stayed. How fucked would the entire world be?  <br>As the name implies,  he is unique named Dragon Lord . And he has a  guild weapon sticking on his back  and he has his "hand" in scheming  against the players ever since Six Great Gods .</br>  <br>There's no guarantee anyone else would have been transported anyway</br>  <br> There's no guarantee anyone else would have been transported anyway <br>The players got teleported away from each other?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>Except for the part where they actually are in a real fantasy world.</br>  <br>It's pretty much shocking me how much people are missing this even though it's been spelled out numerous numerous times. <br><br>Like, could you fucking pay attention to the episode you're watching before spewing a bunch of retarded words?</br></br></br>  <br>There are already kingdoms with  non-human races, and it is stated in the recent chapter by Ivileye that they get more common the farther away you get from the Theocracy. <br><br>The Theocracy may be dicks,  but they're no different from non-human nations that use humans as slave labor; there are also places where humans are seen as a literal food source. <br><br>The residents of Nazarick may be sinister and insidious, but they treat everyone not of Nazarick about as evenly (as in tools to use.)</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>They are in a actual fantasy world though.</br>  <br>At least you maybe, just slightly, can trust them. Unlike AI's in cyberpunk settings.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>The anime cuts out the part where he freaks out when he finds out that the world he's in has absolutely nothing to do with his old MMO world, which is supposedly heavily based on Norse themes. There's nothing remotely Norse about the New World he and Nazarick got sent in.</br>  <br>Shocking truth: some people post in those threads just to shitpost, not even watching the shows.</br>  <br>You could always trust Shodan to be a cunt and the AIs in Marathon were okay dudes for a relative value of "okay".</br>  <br>Is this the girl from Volume 4 ch2 intermission?</br>  <br>Dropped at first episode</br>  <br>No. Mage for the adamantium adventurer team Blue Rose. Ivileye.</br>  <br>What are you even doing here then?</br>  <br>He wants to be converted and bask in the glory of Ainz obviously. Who wouldn't want to follow this guy?</br>  the guild Ainz Ooal Gown was quite the powerhouse.<br>11 out of the 200 world class items<br>Best warrior (Touch Me)<br>Best Mage (Ulbert Alain Odle)<br>Ranked 9th on points with only 41 players(all of whom have jobs)<br>Ten floor dungeon that repelled a 6 guild coalition consisting of 1500 players</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To get attention and reply. Which obviously work</br>  <br> Also Climb wanted him to train him after they meet in a cave. <br>Truly, the traditional place to meet good masters</br></br>  <br><br>That's weird. Most of them should still be alive then. The stronger you are the longer you live and all</br></br>  whats Ainz original servant out of these? I didnt catch it. I think its the old buttler but i am not sure  <br> pay attention <br> /a/ </br></br>  <br><br>They were sent to different time periods. So everyone but ainz could have been TPed but arrived 5000 years before him</br></br>  <br><br>Implying Papa Bones wouldnt be fucking awesome here:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Y3Q<wbr>BeRCKnE0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not if you have a goodly-two shoes  Dragon Lord that has been for centuries, out to exterminate players for the "good" of the world. </br>  <br>Depends on your race. Even Ainz can't extend the lifespan of mortals even with enhanced spell list and knowing the highest tiers of magic.</br>  <br> Best Meido <br> posts worst retard meido <br><br>Accept Sebas as the best already, mongrel</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean which npc did he make? If so that's Pandora's Actor.</br>  <br>   nation of Nazarick <br>not the land of Ainz Oal Gown? wtf</br></br>  <br>It's the  Nazi. </br>  <br> wtf <br/></br>  <br>Ainz has never had that much of a ego. He only acts like a supreme overlord, because he thinks his subordinates want him to behave as such. He has always cared about Nazarick as a whole, the guild is important,  but no one can join Ainz Ool Gown (the organization) without majority approval from members. </br>  <br><br>Oh you are right this guy. Seems cool but he hasnt been in the anime yet. He looks like a Haniwa in a suit  good taste Ainz </br></br>  <br> He looks like a Haniwa in a suit <br>that's how Doppelgangers look naturally, Narbel would also looks like that if she dropped her Maid form.</br></br>  <br>He will appear at least before the end.<br><br>And we will get to see his zany poses embarrassing the fuck out of Ainz.<br><br><br>Well most of them would probably be immortal like Ainz. Touch Me was a dragon kin like Sebas wasn't he? If Touch Me appeared in the world he would have probably become some kind of god emperor and thrown Ainz a welcoming party after 5000 years of waiting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>But, they're in real fantasy world, though?</br>  <br>Now i get that Ainz is just Nazi scrambled</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437452 <br>or you could have paid attention on hoe he remarks how his turning into a lich not just physically but mentally too.</br>  <br> still be alive <br><br>I think only 1-2 of the 13 heroes were actually from YGGDRASIL. The others were probably human and to weak for it to really matter</br></br></br>  <br>What spell level does she reach? is she a player?</br>  <br><br>The two Yggdrasil players of that group literally killed each other. It seems to be a reoccurring thing outside of the 6 gods</br></br>  Best boy  <br><br>Reminder that AInz is embarassed as fuck for creating Pandora's Actor.</br></br>  <br>Reminder that Pandora's Actor is still best NPC</br>  <br><br>shake shake!</br></br>  Is Ivileye a player or a local vampire? with that name, Im leaning towards player  <br>Yggdrasil was absolutely a generic medieval fantasy MMO. There was nothing Norse about it other than the same reuse of Norse names that we see elsewhere in SAO and Elder Tales.</br>  <br>Local vampire.She sold her soul for power to fight alongside the 13 heroes.</br>  <br><br>Also, her real name is  Landfall .</br></br>  <br>Well it did have the 9 realms/worlds of norse mythology but that was about as far as it got with it.</br>  <br>It had a bunch of different worlds, Norse worlds, in its lore if I recall correctly.</br>  <br>Not known but the talk of her rest of team paints her to be vastly above them so she should at least be an even match against Pleiades (disregarding hard counters like her anti-bug spell for Entoma).</br>  <br>Im guessing they would have ended killing each other like another certain group before them</br>  <br>Pretty sure these are the same people complaining about the "slow" pacing.</br>  <br>not really, im a fan of the LN and still think the anime is "running late". I dont think its slow, I just think each episode is too short by 3 minutes so they are accumulating a "time debt" that will have to be filled by the last episode in its entirety</br>  <br> At the beginning, Ainz constantly imagined that this world was based on the lore of YGGDRASIL. Since you could use YGGDRASIL magic in this world, perhaps it was somewhat related to YGGDRASIL. However, the names he heard had absolutely no relation to it. <br> The neighboring countries were the Kingdom of Re-Estize, the Baharuth Empire and the Silian Theocracy. In the Nordic mythology and lore of YGGDRASIL, these names didn’t appear. <br>The LN hinted that Yggdrasil was pretty Norse-ly.</br></br></br>  <br>The world would be fucking screwed.<br><br>We don't the relationship between the previous heroes but lets assume that they were all friends from the same guild AT BEST and human or demihuman (I'm sure they could also hide if they were a blob or skelly but non human/demihuman was uncommon and prone to PKing). At some point many managed to get turned against each other despite being apparently "human" enough. With that in mind those were still comparatively small amounts of players at once too.<br><br>Okay every Ainz Ooal Gown member shows up. That's 41 godly strong players with three of them being even more godly than the rest to the point where I do not think I can even imagine what Touch Me could do to the world. <br><br>Now Ainz (our Ainz not the guild) was clearly the most NEET of all and love his guildmates dearly to the point where even after becoming a rattle me bones he still wants nothing more than to be with him friends. However we know nothing of how the rest of the guild really felt. Were they true friends and would they stick together after coming to the new world? Did everyone besides Momonga treat the game as just a game and coming to the new world would they just fuck off and do their own thing? We only know how people acted in the game and an MMO is way different than real life. Maybe Teapot would immediately freak the fuck out and kill themself, maybe Touch Me was actually a horrible person and just used the game as a means of RPing someone else and upon actually being in control goes off as a giant anti paladin, or maybe half the guild secretly hated the other half and bam civil war with beings who can destroy entire armies with the flick of their wrist. <br><br>There's also the fact that turning into your race effects you mentally. Ainz got off "easy" in that his change just meant he can think more level headed and a lack of empathy. What the fuck does turning into a dragon man or a vampire or a slime or a weird Cthulhu head do?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh yeah, for those wondering in the earlier threads about "how the fuck would something like DnD's Time Stop work in New World?", you're in for a treat on the last tracks of 1st drama cd.<br><br>Ainz uses it.

No idea about 2nd.<br><br>Grab the 1st cd from either imoutoliciouslnt blog or from the mega folder.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yet he treasures him because he can see his friends through him.</br></br>  <br> Now, to answer the big question you have in your minds in regards to the second volume... <br> You will have to wait until 1) Kuro gets around it, 2) We get a new TL, 3) Other group picks it up. <br> From this point on, Four Lovers will be the priority for Kurono Smith. <br><br>So we'll probably have to wait a few months unless someone else picks it up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They would die of old age unless they were demihumans (elves) or non-humans.</br>  <br>He brought out like 5000 undead with magical armor and shields and weapons against the lizards. 300 or 500 death knights. No problem.</br>  <br>Well, that was one of the rules to join the guild....</br>  <br> What the fuck does turning into a dragon man <br><br>Libido x 1000<br>Love of Gold x 1000</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not every non-human is immortal, though.</br>  <br> Love of Gold x 1000 <br>is there a scaly merchant.png?</br></br>  <br>Most heteromorphic races on the other hand either seem to be either extremely long lived or outright immortal though.<br> Skellingtons <br> Vampires <br> Demons (including Imps, Succubi etc.) <br> Slimes <br> Eldritch Abominations <br> Dragons/Dragonkin </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Slimes <br>I have never seen a single piece of fiction that described a slimes natural lifespan.</br></br>  <br>I got you covered.</br>   13.　*6,118　*46,846　Overlord Vol.1 <br> 18.　*4,862　*38,076　Overlord Vol.2 <br> 22.　*4,122　*34,935　Overlord Vol.3 <br> 25.　*3,441　*32,816　Overlord Vol.9 <br><br>PRAISE MADHOUSE<br>PRAISE PAPA BONES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I seem to remember a /tg/ thread about that topic.</br>  <br>Do you have a skellington merchant as well?</br>  <br>I'll double check.</br>  <br>This is a common misconception. Dragons dont love gold, they love the fact that gold basically works like chocolate. Its delicious, and an aphrodisiac, so its more like "must have gold to get laid" when visiting a love interest.<br><br>Thus, its more like Libido x 1000000. Gold just happens to be included inside that</br></br></br>  <br>Closest thing I have is pic related, sorry.</br>  <br>He made the head maid Yuri Alpha and Pandora's actor.</br>  <br>This right here is what will get us a second season if anything will</br>  <br>Yuri isn't the head maid and he didn't make her*</br>  <br>Impressive.<br><br>Though I wonder how much better it would have done if Madhouse didn't have to resort to CG.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh you're right.</br>  i must be the only person on /a/ to not be head over heels with overlord<br><br>It's really, boring and uninspired to me.</br></br>  <br>Jesus</br>  <br>I actually liked the death knight</br>  <br>Did you read the novel?</br>  <br>She's more like the second in command, or fourth if you count Sebas and the penguin.<br><br>But yeah, the only ones we know Ainz made are Pandora Actor and that throwaway Lich (though probably through necromancy instead of the game systems)</br></br></br>  <br>Well, we all have different tastes, I guess.</br>  All praise the user who created Albedo<br><br>This guy knows how to create good semen demons</br></br>  <br> Edition <br>that's really annoying tbh</br></br>  <br>Tell me your not this faggot<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/Ycv2bauLJh8  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>So is this essentially Low Fantasy meets High Fantasy? I do like it when anime has more low fantasy themes.</br>  <br>So is Albedo's youngest sister the miko?<br><br>I remember her mentioning it when talking to her other sister,the faceless horror one. Also I'm really looking forward to seeing the flashback of Tabula's creation scarring Ainz and all his friends shitless.</br></br></br>  <br> So is this essentially Low Fantasy meets High Fantasy? <br><br> It's high fantasy meets high fantasy </br></br></br>  Who made Victim?  <br>I admit, I felt a little bad for Khajit. I blame it on the author for slipping in the backstory of the characters  he kills off.   Never forget, Arche ;_; </br>  <br>  More like High Fantasy meets Higher Fantasy. </br>  So is Albedo bad because I heard that in volume 7 she trying to kill the 41 guild members except for ainz  <br>She is a yandere</br>  <br>Remember that the author's readers chose to kill her off. He had a poll.</br>  <br>Well fuck, I was hoping it wouldn't come to that.</br>  <br>Her creator with their huge setting obsession wrote her like that, but because Ainz changed that last line she still wants to kill but not Ainz.. At least that's what anon told me.</br>  <br>Where that spoiler coming from?</br>  <br>It's not like her Fate Worse Than Death alternative was any better. The readers actually did good the way they voted.</br>  <br>Ainz and co. are capable of magic and skill three times beyond the highest levels of the new worlders, and that doesn't even include Ainz's treasury and his 13 game breaking World-class items.</br>  <br>Implying you dont want to become Shalltear sex slave</br>  <br>What is this from?</br>  <br>Pretty sure the poll options were tragic end or not.</br>  <br>I really don't. She's a sadist.</br>  <br>The Guild would split, remember Touch Me hand over the Leader position to Momonga over some sort of discussion with Ulbert? Nonetheless what Momonga thought of it, it remarks a division on them</br>  <br>Faggot.<br><br> Her suffering ended with the best possible end for her. </br></br></br>  <br> In the web novel, she became Shalltear's sex toy while in the light novel she died in absolute despair in Shalltear's hands. <br> Her dead body was cut into pieces: Entoma uses Arche's voice to replace her old voice, Demiurge takes her skin, several undead take her arms and legs, her head is used as decoration for the devils and the leftovers become food. <br> In the web novel, she teaches Ainz how to dance. <br>At least her jive will live on in Papa Bones during Nazaricks raves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the WN, she ends up as Shalltear's sextoy. In the LN, the author had a vote on whether to keep it the same or tragic end.</br>  <br>How exactly, does she want to kill them?<br>Didn't they Quit even before Ainz was transported where he is now?<br>Or does she want to eradicate, that they ever existed?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Man, Ainz must have been mad at fuck. I blame the girl's faggot teammate for how things ended up. Is he the one who was unfortunate enough to meet the Lord of Terror?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was probably something added in her gigantic description written by Tabula, like how the penguin was designed to want to overthrow Ainz.<br><br>Tabula had weird tastes like that and Ainz didn't read it all because it was like a fucking book in length.</br></br></br>  <br>Well no, I know that. I was just hoping that the world they got into wasn't high fantasy, since from what we've seen in the show so far it looks fairly low fantasy.</br>  <br> In the web novel, Albedo does not exist. <br>Clearly added for waifufags.<br>WN is superior, shalltear wins by default</br></br></br>  Anyone got episode names past 5?<br><br>I'm wondering where you guys got the first five names in the first place.</br></br>  <br>I don't know how you got that impression after the first episode with all the demi-humans. Anyways, next episode there's going to be an angel spammer.</br>  <br>In the WN, Shalltear has most of the scenes associated with Albedo.</br>  <br>To be fair though, he's using an item that mimics stuff from the game.<br><br>And most of the setting beyond the Blue Rose girls and some other powerful people is pretty low fantasy.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean the world they arrived in, not Ainz and his posse. All we've seen of that world in these episodes are villages, soldiers and knights with the slight implication of scarce magic users.</br>  <br> penguin <br><br>Who?</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't know </br>  Best girl coming through<br><br> fuck off with your chair comments </br></br>    <br>Sebas' second in command. You meet him right before Pandora Actor IIRC. He's also in the bar scene with Shalltear and mushroom bartender in Book 4.<br><br>So we should see him in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br>his first appearance is when Demiurge finds albedo rolling in Ainz's bed.<br>His 'background' is that he's the only one in nazarick planning to usurp the supreme beings save Albedo</br></br>  <br>They showed Unglaus in the OP so they better show her going full vampire.</br>  <br>She's a drunk  chair. </br>  Where do I find the WB translated?  <br>But she's a beautiful chair, anon.</br>  <br>She's a shitty chair, Bones had a terrible time when he sat on her.</br>  <br>in dreams and fantasies, anon.</br>  <br>B-But I need to know more about Gazef &amp; Brain</br>  The real important question is:<br><br> Which character would you rape? </br></br>  <br>Brain gets fucking rekt by shalltear who wasn't even trying<br><br>That's all you need to know about brain</br></br></br>  <br>Mare.</br>  <br>But he's found mind broken by Gazef, what happens then?</br>  <br>Ainz.</br>  <br>He fucks his  brains  out.</br>  <br>healing and friendship of course</br>  <br>Sebas-chan</br>  <br>[x] The Maids</br>  <br>Based Gazef heals him</br>  <br><br>The Golden Princess, in front of a chained Climb.<br><br>Holy shit, I want to break that whore so much.

Now why don't you fuck off?</br>    <br> Demiurge pretending to be a little girl. <br> Pretending to implement social reform. <br> Pretending to be a little girl pretending to be implementing social reform. <br><br>Just how deep does this scheming run?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No anon, you have to use the jap name</br>  Does Ainz ever have anything bad happen to him that isn't purely a result of his own bad decision-making?  <br>Well, I guess volume three could be considered one</br>  <br>It's normally Ainz lays the ground work for failure, and then his subordinate just makes the issue worse.<br><br> He completely fucks up at getting the corpses from the grave though, so whatever happens with that is his fault. </br></br></br>  <br>Wait, no. That was his fault too.</br>  <br> implying that was the same person <br><br>Also,<br> everyone has to fit in and conform to what I think is normal <br><br>The diagnosis is autism</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So who was the girl at the beginning of volume three?  Seriously we need to clean /a/ from this shit  <br><br>Monogatari and Madoka are perfectly legitimate examples of anime.</br></br>  Madoka isn't anime, it's life changing.  <br>get the fuck out you post 2006 neo-/a/ piece of shit</br>  The manga for Cory in the House is much better.  <br>What chapter does Raven turns evil?</br>  <br>Add SAO to that and I'm in.</br>  <br>Fuck you, 3/4 of those are good. Monogatari, JoJo, and Cory in the House.</br>  <br>OP what are you talking about these are top tier anime especially cory in the house cory in the house is the epitome of japanese animation I honestly can't think of a better show with such great animation, plot, and characters as cory in the house cory in the house literally ruined me for anime because no anime will ever be as good as cory in the house</br>  <br><br>JoJo is shit. Madoka and Monogatari are good. Cory in the House is undefined.</br></br>  <br>Madoka is mediocre. Cory in the House is GOAT though, that's for sure.</br>  What's wrong with Jojo?<br>Keep in mind I've only read the manga, and haven't seen the anime.</br>  Cory in the House is the only one on that list that can be called a true masterpiece.  <br><br>It's gay porn. Anime characters should look like little girls, not disgusting sacks of muscular definition.</br></br>  I feel you, OP. JoJofags are the only ones that actively chap my ass though. No matter where I go, I cannot escape from epic JoJo references and animemes, shit's getting out of hand. If it continues to be adapted, this nightmare isn't going to end anytime soon and that's fucking scary.<br><br>also this thread's probably gonna be deleted within 5 minutes.</br></br>  <br>The fanbase. But I mean, the fanbase is maybe as bad as the Monogatari fanbase, but no where near as cancerous as the Madoka fanbase.</br>  <br>Madotards&gt;Jojofags&gt;Monogatarys<br>In terms of autism</br></br>  <br>At least visually, JoJo is a good break from common modern anime styles</br>  <br>You do realize all decent-sized fanbases are cancer, right?<br><br>Small groups can police themselves better to remove the shitters. Once you reach a certain size then the amount of people who shitpost for the sake of shitposting reaches critical mass and that's it. Game over. <br><br>All the good conversation which can/does happen gets drowned out and heavily outnumbered by memes and waifushitting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All things typemoon not on the list <br>absolute faggot confirmed</br></br>  <br>Those aren't even close to the reason people say that.<br>Put it only harems in there and you have a deal.</br></br>  <br>type moon threads have good discussion aside from the unending best girl war and the secondaries</br>  <br>Aren't these starter pack thingies supposed to be funny?</br>  <br> type moon threads are good if we ignore 101% of the posts </br>  <br><br> These anime are cancerous <br> But not me <br> I'm a hero, trying to save the board  <br><br>This is OP</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hasn't posted any real shit </br>  Replace Cory in the House with Cowboy Bebop and I will agree.  <br> we <br>fuck off</br></br>  <br>tsukihime threads are good, prisma illya threads are good</br>  <br> 6 minutes later. </br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with the CB fanbase that puts them anywhere near the cancer of Monogatari, Madoka, Type-Moon , Kyoani and Eva.</br>  <br>it makes /pol/ have funny pants feelings and they dont like that</br>  Please, give me an example an example of any moderate to large fanbases that aren't dogshit.  <br>evangelion</br>  This may be bait.  Was this the shitiest writing in the entire One Piece bibliography?  first for robin  <br>How the fight against Diamante turned out.</br>  <br><br>But he had spiky balls. Who wouldn't that one shot</br></br>  <br>Its definitely in the top 10</br>  <br>go read it and find out?</br>  I will never understand cunts like you, OP.  <br> oda cocksucker <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Diamante killed Rebecca's father, who was also Kyros' wife. Therefore, we could have expected Rebecca and her father to unite their respective strengths in order to avenge the mother of their family. However, such thing didn't happen. Instead of making a 2 v 1 fight, who would have been legitimate considering that Diamante has a DF power whereas Kyros is weakened since he has only one leg and that Rebecca is already tired from fighting, Oda chose to make Kyros fight Diamante on his own. Why? For a propaganda reason, I dare say. Oda is from a country with a patriarchical and misogynist culture and he wants to spread it all over the world using his manga as a medium since there are ten of millions of people reading One Piece. It's shameful of him. He tries to make people think subconsciously that men should do the fight while women stay back, it's something that should be obvious to even the average reader. However, since many readers are young, they don't realize that and actually believe Oda is right without wondering whether he really is or not, and thus, Oda has achieved his misogynist objective. It's very sad considering that this is coming from the same author who fought racism with the FIshman Island arc.</br>  <br>No, not that. Just the way you start the thread with bait. For what purpose ? None. Simply for shitposting.</br>  <br>No, I meant that this fight had the worst writing ever. Not that I didn't know what happened with this fight. However I wouldn't even have mentionned it.<br><br><br>He had spiky balls, threw them in the air, they fell on Kyros, and he stood up as if he was perfectly fine. Isn't that strange?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just the way you start the thread with bait. <br> calling shit out is bait <br>are you mentally challenged?</br></br></br>  What happens when Law cuts Buggy inside his room?  <br>Kuina.</br>  <br>Perhaps he is just giving his opinion and want people to discuss it with him. If you don't agree with him, then speak, tell him your opinion. You don't have to be afraid. 4chan is a place where people disagree all the time and no one will criticize you just because you think a chapter had better writing then someone else believes. Why do you think OP used a question mark? It's because he wanted to discuss with you.<br><br><br>He was mistaken, let him regret it.<br>As for your opinion about this chapter, I also think it was quite forced. It wasn't horrible, though, but Oda could have made it much more natural.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess you can fuck off and not buy his manga then though I doubt you do anyway.</br>  <br> Diamante killed Rebecca's father, who was also Kyros' wife. <br><br>almost hurt myself trying to process that for a second</br></br></br>  What are the lengths and girths of the male characters?  <br>When Law cuts Buggy inside his room, Buggy is cut and there is no damage.<br><br><br>You shouldn't tell people to "fuck off" just because you disagree. Talk with me and we will discuss what you disagree about.<br>I'll keep buying One Piece because I like it.<br><br><br>I meant mother, sorry. I wrote too quickly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You think it's shit writing. That's your opinion. No need to bait people in to an argument. Obviously there are going to be 10s of people defending this, just like every other thread this discussion came up. "Calling out shit" as you say it serves no real purpose other create a 100 shitposts.</br>  <br>So if that's the case, what other variations of 2 and 9 are there to go through?</br>  <br> That's your opinion. <br> pls don't post your opinion of 4chinks k thx <br>Hang yourself you newfagging cancer</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know since Oda never made that official.<br>You shouldn't talk about this kind of pointless thing anyway. <br><br><br>He didn't bait. He gave his opinion and I agree with him to some extent. Don't call something bait just because you don't like it. It's very disrespectful of you. This Sabo chapter was a little forced. Tell me why you don't think so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand your anger, but you're going too far with these insults. I agree with you about Sabo. What do you think about Sabo's entire character?</br>  <br><br>Alright, I think your opinion is shit and you should kill yourself. There is literally no shit story writing in One Piece at all. Not even Rebecca.</br></br>  Everything Sabo story related is cheap and shit  <br>see? Write your shittaste from now on right away instead of being such a dramaqueen all the time you little bitch.</br>  what would have been a reasonable explanation for sabo to not show up for over 10 years?  <br>I didn't think this chapter was "shit". I think it was a bit forced. And no I won't kill myself just because you disagree with me. Even if we have different opinions, we have to respect each other.</br>  <br><br> we could have expected Rebecca and her father to unite  <br>You mean you expected<br><br> who would have been legitimate <br>Who's to say what's legitimate or not..if not the author himself right?<br><br> he wants to spread it all over the world using his manga <br>Now this is some assumption, he's a popular artist. What part of his art exactly isn't meant to be spread around the world? <br><br> It's shameful of him <br>..And he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it, are you?<br><br> He tries to make people think subconsciously <br>If you thought it subconsciously, that's fine. It's sad to try to find "hidden meanings" where there is none. You either understand what he's saying or you don't, you either agree with him or you don't, anything else is just making it more complicated... there's not much of a point in that, don't you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Amnesia.</br>  <br>Even koala?</br>  <br>Having his own life and trusting ace just like luffy did back at thriller bark when he said that Ace has to go through his adventure with his own friends. After all luffy only rushed to ace AFTER losing his friends and therefore his primary goal for the time. If Sabo would have fought against a big shot who went against the revs during the happenings of the marineford arc, it would have shown that Sabo is an actual character and not just a plot devise/memeboy that Oda uses to have Ace in the manga after killing him off.</br>  <br>We can think up of some ideas together.<br><br><br> You mean you expected <br>No, we could have expected, but you didn't expect because you happen to share Oda's patriarchical mentality.<br><br> Who's to say what's legitimate or not..if not the author himself right? <br>I was talking about whether the fight would have been fair or not, since a lot of misogynists would have used this excuse to claim a 2 v 1 would have been unfair.<br><br> Now this is some assumption, he's a popular artist. What part of his art exactly isn't meant to be spread around the world?  <br>I didn't say it was wrong to want to spread his art. I said it's wrong to want to spread his patriarchical and misogynist culture. You are assuming something I never said. Assuming something wrong is very bad because it's what misogynists do all the time about women. You should change yourself because otherwise, your future will be very worrying. I can guess that many people will affected by you and the way you think. It's never too late to change.<br><br> ..And he doesn't seem to be ashamed of it, are you? <br>Unfortunately he isn't, this is the problem. Don't you get it? And I have nothing to be ashamed of since I am not the one drawing this manga. I am saying what's wrong with it. You are defending it subconsciously because you agree with the patriarchical it's spreading. Stop it right now.<br><br> If you thought it subconsciously, that's fine. It's sad to try to find "hidden meanings" where there is none. You either understand what he's saying or you don't, you either agree with him or you don't, anything else is just making it more complicated... there's not much of a point in that, don't you think? <br>You don't understand anything. I explained what Oda tried to do, but you dismissed everything without addressing the point. Please think. Thinking if the first step to becoming more mature as a human being who wants to be respectful of everyone. I'll let you think on your own for some minutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, only the amnesia part. And not because it doesn't make any sense, but because it's way more convenient than it could've easily been</br>  <br>Doing revolutionaries stuff while keeping tabs on both Luffy and Ace.<br>Also, he got badly wrecked during a mission before the summit war so he couldnt be there.</br></br>    <br>Koala isn't. She is an example of how a human who was victim of racism can be respectful of the group of people who were racist toward her.</br>  Which shoes are best? I'm going with crocodile's  <br>You do know that the fishman saved her little ass and helped her more than the humans did?</br>  <br>Kyros' flashback was much worse</br>  <br>This is a nice idea.<br><br><br>13<br><br><br>She was a victim of two groups and forgave both of them. She is a very great person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would have gone with Ace's if it wasn't for that little skull thing.</br>  <br>Brook or Sanji for males. Robin for females.</br>   new thread <br> Rebeccafag right from the start </br>  <br>Sanji, Brook and Crocodile. Those nigga have taste</br>  <br>Be careful, intolerant people will accuse you of replying to me.</br>  <br>At the least the tripfags fucked off, thanks allah</br>  <br>Man, again? Robin's, Vivi's, Kid's. Would wear them all.<br> as a former lolita I'm laughing at 11, those are really awful </br></br>  <br> After all luffy only rushed to ace AFTER losing his friends and therefore his primary goal for the time. <br>Even after losing his friends, his primary goal was to go back to his crewmates. <br><br>It wasn't until he found out Ace was going to be executed that he wanted to join the war. If he found out about the severity of the situation at Thriller Bark instead of at Amazon Lily, chances are he would've still wanted to go save Ace.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't have to separate your tastes according to genders as if men and women should always be separated. What's your favorite shoes overall?<br><br><br>No wonder considering how much you insulted them. You should be ashamed of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> you happen to share Oda's patriarchical mentality. <br>ayy lmao<br><br> I was talking about whether the fight would have been fair or not <br>"Fair"? Really?....<br><br> You are assuming something I never said. <br>I asked you a question, buddy. And you didn't answer it.<br><br> You should change yourself  <br> It's never too late to change. <br>Fuck you.<br><br>  I am saying what's wrong with it. <br>  You are defending it subconsciously  <br>  you agree with the patriarchical it's spreading. <br>Seriously, I never once said that I agree with him, that's just you.. I don't even know what to say. You're demanding things, you're saying you know better... This isn't much of a discussion is it? But hey, I think I kind of don't care :) So all is good.<br><br>  I'll let you think on your own for some minutes. <br>*cringe*</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't really mind this at all. I mean, if within the space of 794 chapters an author uses amnesia as a plot device once, I think it's nothing worth getting upset over. It's a passable explanation.<br><br>That said, I would've been completely fine if it was never explained at all and just left as a minor plothole, because that's all it was in the first place. I would've preferred it if this chapter had continued on from the last one with a few more glimpses at other characters around the world rather than it be entirely focused on Sabo.

This is very lame of you.<br><br> "Fair"? Really?.... <br>I never said it was my opinion. Why don't you read things properly? I gave you a lot of time. Use it correctly instead of speedreading things and making wrong assumptions, it's not the first time you do it. You have to think.<br><br> Fuck you. <br>No.<br><br> Seriously, I never once said that I agree with him, that's just you.. I don't even know what to say. You're demanding things, you're saying you know better... This isn't much of a discussion is it? But hey, I think I kind of don't care :) So all is good. <br>You clearly agree with him, as a matter of fact, you try to deny my points without even trying to use proper arguments, which prove you are hopeless to prove me wrong even if you are unable to. All is good for me because it allows me to shows how wrong you are, but all is bad for you because you won't change. And I want you to change because I am worried for your future.<br><br> *cringe* <br>Cringing about yourself is a good thing but the next step is to think about why you were wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Oda definitely has their dong sizes written down somewhere, right?</br>  IGNORE THE REBECCA FAG YOU IDIOTS  <br> Even after losing his friends, his primary goal was to go back to his crewmates. <br>nope that's the point: If he had his friends with him, he would have done the same as he did in Thriller bark. He would believe in Ace. He didn't because Kuma raped his crew beforehand. That connection is obvious, because in thriller bark lola outright told them that the vivre card suggests death, but luffy didn't go, because he wasn't raped by Kuma back then. Because he did belive in Ace's fate and FRIENDS. He literally found out about Ace's fate at thriller bark. He didn't belive anymore after the chaos on sabaody.<br><br><br> you <br>anon pls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kokonotsu <br><br>as in the fashion</br></br></br>  <br>I admit it might have been better if dragon just didnt let him go to marineford for the sake of revolutionaries not getting involved, although it would be hard to believe you could stop sabo.

Why don't you understand that? If Rebecca was a man, she would have beaten Diamante with her father and Oda would have called that a marvelous family combination. But he didn't because Rebecca is a girl and he doesn't want to make girls fight because he thinks they should stay aside and let men do the fighting.<br><br><br>Okay.

As much as he loved Ace and Luffy, he was no longer aiming to become a pirate. He no longer had the same goal as them. And besides, when he left to be a pirate and was gunned down, he had already decided to leave them for an undetermined amount of time. After Ace and Shanks left Luffy they didn't do anything to contact him either for years. As for being a revolutionary, it's not like they can just send regular-ass mail and hope it's not traced, and how would you send mail to Ace and Luffy anyway? They lived out in a fucking jungle, no address or anything.</br>  <br><br> You are not even trying to answer properly. This is very lame of you. <br>But there is nothing to answer.

It's quite different you know... Trying to deny it would be saying <br>You didn't. I already explained everything. However you keep trying to deny my posts without making a point because you know that I am right and are frustrated at this thought. It's not right. If you disagree, then you must think and say what you disagree about. Then we'll discuss. It's alright for you to be wrong, I won't blame you, but try to help you.<br><br> this stuff ^. This is denying someone. <br>I never said what was wrong was to deny someone. It's to deny someone without giving proper arguments. You seem to have bad reading comprehension skills because you keep twisting my words. I will assume you aren't english and don't master the english language well enough yet. Try to think a little so that you won't make any bad interpretation anymore. Take your time.<br><br> Well mate.. :^) That's a waste of time. I don't care the slightest for you, you shouldn't care for me either. Don't lie to yourself pretending that you care, because you don't ;) <br>Even if you don't care about me, I care for you. Don't be pessimistic about yourself, there are people who care for you in this world even if you don't think so. Are you often alone? Well, you have me now.

I'm fighting for your future. If you don't understand that, you will never change. When IRL shut-ins are told to change, they try to get away and to be alone, so it's not surprising that you do the same online. You are afraid of changing, so you run away from reality. It's too bad if you don't come back but your life won't become better like this. Instead of staying close-minded, you must try to think properly in order to become a mature adult respectful of other people. Believe me, as I am probably older than you.</br>  <br>Yeah. It's all kids arguing against kids. Fucking stupid. 4chan is a goddamn shithole because of this immature underage faggotry. Makes me mad.</br>  Let's just post a link to the Rebecca porn and stop replying.  <br>I don't care about not being liked. Anyway, let's talk about One Piece. What do you think about this chapter. Don't you think it was kind of forced, like I and another person said earlier?<br><br><br>Hello, it's been a long time.

And please talk about One Piece. I got banned last time for being off-topic even though it was all the misogynists who derailed the thread by insulting me.

At Thriller Bark, Luffy assumed that Ace was probably in some kind of fight and he believed he'd be fine eventually, because A: Pirates fight and B: Ace was a really fucking strong pirate. Whether he had his crew or not, had little to do with his decision to go to Marineford, it was the fact that he found out Ace got captured with no chance to escape that made Luffy want to go. Luffy also flat out said that he wouldn't be able to be of much good if Ace was in trouble and that Ace hated getting looked down upon. <br><br>He felt the same when he found out about everything, but still went because the threat to Ace's life was that much greater that he didn't care about all of that anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello. I am trolling you right now with this very post.<br><br>Can you handle the crushing mysoginism? How are you dealing with the absolutely disrespectful display of male, white imperialism conveyed within my words? Does it annoy you? Does it make you angry? Good. I have dedicated all of my existence to the Patriarchy. Within this very post, you catch a glimpse of your worst enemy. I was trained from birth in secret compounds, where we learned how to harness and use our powers as heterosexual cis caucasian men in the oppression of women, homosexuals, trans, black, and any person unlike us you can think of. Only a few chosen ones, who show the highest concentrated Patriarchal power (PP) are let into those compounds. My sole goal in life is to carry out the will of my masters, and I have learned to take enjoyment from it, as have all the others who grew with me. We were nurtured in prejudice, and released back into society, where we now hunt for minorities to oppress, with normal, everyday lives serving as a disguise. And we are not few. We are many. One of the advantages of working for those in power is the ease to blend into any everyday societal role. Anyone around you could be one of us. Your father. Your brother. Your neighbor. The shop owners, the gardeners, the cab drivers, the cops, every man around you could be one of us, and you'll never know, for we are taught to keep our training a secret and take it to the grave. But still we work, in the shadows, to maintain the power of the Patriarchs. You are but one of many victims, one I have chosen to illuminate, to forcefully shove my thick hard redpill into, but worry not, I am high enough in rank within this organization that I can do it with no repercussions (I am Order of the High Fedora, by the way, with a PP of over 10000). I just thought it amusing. And no one will believe you if you tell them, anyway.<br><br>I hope you enjoy your uphill, meaningless battle. We have already won it long ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>excellent taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>shit taste</br>  <br>Since it's a copy/pasta then there's no point in me replying to this. I've already read many things like this, it's not very interesting even as trolling. Sorry.</br>  <br> Luffy also flat out said that he wouldn't be able to be of much good if Ace was in trouble and that Ace hated getting looked down upon. <br>That's the point, he ignored his principles, because he tasted comlete defeat by Kuma right beforehand. maling him turn 180 and helping ace</br></br>  <br>Buggy? Croc? Daz? Is that really you?<br>also top ship</br></br>  <br> Law x Kyros could be nice. <br><br>i'm...</br></br></br>  <br>The lowest of the low was Zoro refusing to fight Monet because she's a woman. Like what the fick, Zoro is a badass that doesn't give a shit about anything, he cracked a bitch's skull in Weasky Peak and now he can't hit women?<br><br>That shits all his promise to Kuina, since he basically admitted that women can't fight men and that her despair was justified.<br><br>I'm not even a feminist or anything but Oda's misogyny is embarrassing even be Shonen standards. At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers, Nnoitra was pretty much humiliated bu Nel for being a misogynist prick, but no, Oda has to make sure that women know their place and don't even get involved with male affairs.<br><br>The text of the Genderswapped Supernovas are just sickening. Are you seriously fucking telling me that just because them changed sex all their ambitions and hopes vanished in the void? Seriously, this is laughable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As in pic related. It's what Perona's design was inspired by. <br><br>Which of the girls won?</br></br></br>  <br> Racism is really bad. <br>nope</br></br>  Weirder than usual meaning Sabo is fking weird  <br>Law would teach the dominating father how it feels to be submissive.<br><br><br>If you think racism is good then you are racist.<br>Talk about One Piece, you are derailing the thread.<br><br><br>Thank you for your marvelous post, comrade!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Which of the girls won? <br>Hanock has 157,000 I think while 2nd place is currently Nami with 67,000 or something</br></br>  <br> Perhaps he just wanted to make a surprise.  <br>you're suggesting sabo wouldn't have contacted ace and luffy for 10 whole years just to surprise them? seriously? that's an even shittier reason than amnesia.</br></br>  <br>Jesus, his defeat had nothing to do with it, Ace getting executed was the big difference in this equation, how are you not getting this? He was running around trying to get Hancock to give him a ship to go back to Sabaody until he saw the newspaper and that is what changed his whole attitude to the burning Vivre Card because he now knew the reason and how severe it was.</br>  <br>that's what makes him hot</br>  <br>No you're right, I am not the one who made the original suggestion.</br>  <br> At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers <br><br>Right, Kishimoto just makes sure they never get involved in action ever or fail miserably when they do.<br><br>Even fucking Kaguya fell for the fucking Harem jutsu</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that haki is planned, even if it might not be from chapter one.   talks about how racism is the worst thing <br> fujoshit spam  <br> posting shit washed characters  <br>this thread really is turning into SnK 2.0</br></br></br>  <br>Carue has CoO. Holy sheet!</br>  <br><br>I just figured that Kyros had already lost so much, he didn't want to risk letting his own daughter get hurt in a fight against a DF user. Even if he was short a leg, he'd rather defend his remaining loved one.</br></br>  <br>Not posting the superior foreshadow.</br>  <br> Miss Monday <br> a bitch <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> Jesus, his defeat had nothing to do with it, Ace getting executed was the big difference in this equation <br>you literally misunderstood luffy's character. He helped ace, because he, after losing his friends like that, realised what ace is probably going through as he was in that situation since thriller bark as the news confirmed. without his people ace was all alone - just like luffy. If luffy would have read the news during thriller bark, he would have believed in ace an wouln't try savin him. thriller bark and impol down luffy are not the same.</br></br>  <br>conqueror's Haki has been there since Chapter 1, Shanks used it on the sea king</br>  No chapter this week?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KQJ<wbr>y0Q-td10</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>MMD Time</br></br>  <br>It's Luffy, holy sheet.</br>  <br>No.  You should read the entire chapter from now on because it usually tells us on the last page when we're not getting a chapter for the next week. </br>  <br>I love his crazy eyes</br>  <br>What am I supposed to look at here?</br>  <br>i think even sanji wouldn't bother to fight that 'women'</br>  <br>By the way, you are probably , got frustrated about not being able to answer since you implied you wouldn't anymore, and had no other choice to use a copy/pasta to reply without revealing your identity. People usually never suddenly use a random copy pasta, especially a very bad one like this, so it makes me think that you are a young teenager who discovered 4chan recently and is convinced that bad copy pastas like this are effective. It would explain why you behaved in a way as stubborn as a young shut-in refusing to listen to his parents. I understand the way you think because I studied psychology. You should try to grow up before trying to act like an adult because it's bad for your self-development.<br><br><br>I understand your point. However, Rebecca also wanted to protect her father, who was deeply injured. Kyros couldn't even stand, but Oda made him stand because he wanted to show how men and fathers are stronger than women according to his patriarchical ideology.<br><br><br>Oda takes a break from time to time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At least Kubo and Kishimoto don't spare women from brutal fights and treat them like little flowers <br>fuck off. I'd rather have women be spared from brutal fights (though there are clearly counter examples but whatever. since people like you ignore counter examples anyway) and be able to pursue their own dreams and ambitions than have their whole life and actions revolve around male characters. <br><br>If Oda doesn't want to fuck up his female characters that's on him, but at least his female characters can hold and act on their own. They're not tied down by some male love interest and their dreams/goals have nothing to do with one too. I'd take Nami and Robin any day over shits like Sakura, Hinata, or Orihime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a disgusting page. It's as if the author implied that women can't do anything physically even if they are well-built.</br>  <br>oh shit that picture is perfect<br><br>I cant get enough of Sabo looking like a nutjob</br></br></br>  <br>Zoro's for comfortable active lifestyle.</br>  <br> You shouldn't talk about this kind of pointless thing anyway.  <br><br>Oda made a point of stating that Luffy's dick stretches so eat shit</br></br></br>  <br>Oda hadn't decided he was going to revive him yet</br>  <br>ty anon. I hadn't had a good laugh like that in a few minutes. You are truly here to refresh our livelihood.</br>  <br> I studied psychology <br>I'm sorry guys, I was ignoring it so far, but I couldn't resist after seeing this.<br>Fucking 10/10, man, you're a fucking master at this.</br></br></br>  This week's chapter was shit, to be honest. And adding to that, Oda is also taking a break... FUCK<br><br>Felt like a goddamn filler chapter after all the shit Fujitora had to handle last week, even the Gorousei showing up</br></br>  <br>On one side One Piece is one of the few shonen manga where women are actually strong and get to fight, and aren't just there to fall in love with the MC. On the other side there's the fanservice, a lot of shitty perverted characters and shit like the Monet thing. <br>I don't understand Oda on this, never have.</br></br>  <br><br>here's the first one for comparison</br></br>  <br>Just to joke with his readers. But it's still pointless.<br><br><br>His female characters are very restrained.<br>Sakura is a good character. She is a strong woman who can fight for herself and cares for her daughter. Too bad Kishimoto made her into a housewife despite her being so strong. Same for Hinata.<br><br>Orihime is stuck with the support role, but Rukia is fine. Bleach isn't that bad. Yoruichi is also very strong.<br><br><br>Either you prove my point about you being a young teenager who discovered 4chan recently, or you are another person who discovered One Peace threads recently.<br><br>Also, calling bait and using a reaction picture when you don't agree with something is what every person without argument does.

That is when he panics. You can see him immediately reacting to that news, stressed out because of it. Claiming it's because of the Kuma-thing is nothing more than a wild guess. Luffy is the type that will leave you to do your own thing and fight your own battles, but when there is absolutely no way out, that is when he comes in to rescue you, whether you like it or not. They even had a little argument over it at Marineford, about how it's an unwritten pirate rule not to go save people of completely different crews just because of a personal connection, because it's humiliating.<br><br>He helped Ace because Ace was going to die and had zero chance of escaping on his own. He couldn't rely on his own power, Luffy fully knew that and Luffy didn't care about leaving it to the Whitebeards with him doing nothing. Had he been told about it on Thriller Bark, he would've gone to Marineford. Had he been told about it on Sabaody, he would've dropped the New World to go to Marineford. That is the type of person Luffy is and according to Ivankov, it's a trait he inherited from his father. The only difference is that his crew would've wanted to go with him. If you still think Luffy would've stayed out of it if he had obtained complete intel of what was going on with Ace before the seperation, then by all means, carry on, but I'm done.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128447781 <br> I like you <br> It's hilarious, please proceed. <br>These words are extremely similar to<br> You're an amusing person, you really are. <br>from <br>You completely proved my point : you are indeed the same person.<br><br> If you call it REVERSEtrolling, aren't you admitting to being a troll yourself. <br>You are indeed the same new teenager who doesn't understand 4chan' vocabulary and keeps misunderstanding on your own everything I write without trying to make a point. Try to think more, I told you.<br><br> I can just smell the restrained anger from your pretend soggy knees. <br>You implied you wouldn't answer and tried not to, but you were so angered that you ended up replying and are now projecting yourself onto me by using a meme that is usually never used on 4chan other than by shitposters.<br><br>Now that your identity has been proved, what do you have to say? Didn't you say you were going to leave me alone or whatever? 4chan is for adults. I understand that you want to speak with adults, but take things slowly. It's too early for you.<br><br><br>No, it's even worse. I would have preferred Oda not to give her any muscle at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> slashing a logia <br>oh no no no sir, go reread it.

Do you know that people often act this way when they are helpless?</br></br></br>  <br>I found something. <br> Hawkins: "What's your sign? Today, your "love luck" is..." <br> Law: "How many people did you kill, Drake-ya-san?" <br> Capone: "Military force and cosmetics are totally different!!" <br> Kidd: "Won't you form an alliance and have a joshikai?" [literally "girl meeting"- basically a get together among girl friends/female colleagues. Usually out at a restaurant/cafe.] <br> Drake: "I don't understand what's so interesting about Pacifistas" (this is the girls-don't-get-robots "joke") <br> Killer: "I'm back, and I brought pancakes and macaroons. We're all such good friends, huh" <br> Bonney: "Donburi!! Bring the next donburi" [donburi is a rice bowl with fish or meat] <br> Apoo: "Apyapya- So you don't know of my cuteness!?" <br> Urouge: "Wahh it's a Tenryuubito dassa" [not sure if that final, odd copula has some sort of joke behind it] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is good for my heart. Thanks bro.</br>  <br>I am helpless!<br>Why do you think I'm acting like this?<br>Don't be heartless, please! I want to change my ways and help women overthrow the dirty pig male government! I want men to suffer like women did for so long! We have wronged them for too long!</br></br></br>  <br>What does 'intercrural' mean ? Apparently the spelling is off cause I've got the red squiggly under the word.</br>  <br>Okay I have to admit that's kind of gross. There's nothing left of their personalities.</br>  <br>Fuuck, Kidd and Drake are the best! Killer too. For some reason, the mask adds to the hotness.</br>  <br><br>I should add the fact that you overreact as if you felt directly offended, which is strange for someone who implied he wasn't the one who replied to my posts.<br><br><br>Do you realize that in real life, upset people speak exactly the way you write? You're basically telling me that you are desperate and are trying to damage control. As a proof, you're not even addressing the point and are showing that you really got offended by something that everyone is unfortunately already used to in One Piece threads. I can read you like I'd read through a book.<br><br><br>Those are some stereotypes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura is a good character <br>Man, Sakura's whole character and actions were dictated by her interest in Sasuke. Even til the fucking epilogue. Yeah, she was 'physically' strong but is that what matters to you guys when it comes to female characters? Physical strength/good fights = good female characters? I don't care if she got to pulverize a puppet master or some shit. Her character is shit and what dictates her actions are even shitter. Same with Hinata and Orihime. <br><br>Robin is strong and cares for her crewmates too. But so what? That's not the reason why I like her. Besides her personality and looks, I like Robin because her ambitions are pretty damn important to the history and lore of the One Piece world. Nami's not my most favorite female character but even she has ambitions that I find admirable and she can hold her own too with her wits alone when it comes down to it. I don't care if they act like 'typical girls' or don't get to 'fight' (though they have, just not as much). They have their own shit they're pursuing that doesn't revolve around fighting, and you sure as hell don't have to worry about them giving that shit up because of some guy. <br> <br>If anything, it's the fact that Oda doesn't put them in situations where they have to fight or get brutally beaten is what might be upsetting. We already know Nami and Robin can and will if it comes down to it. And it's because I know that and I LIKE these characters, I just wish they'd get more spot light. (because honestly in battle shounen manga, fights = screen time). But again, I would rather have good female characters that I can respect, but have them be jipped of fights, than have shitty female characters that do.<br><br> Too bad Kishimoto made her into a housewife despite her being so strong. Same for Hinata. <br>That's the thing. Oda is pretty much the opposite and I would MUCH rather have the opposite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bonus</br></br>  <br>Wow, fuck you, I'm asking for help here and you just act like a big meanie.<br>Screw this, I'm done talking to you. Have a nice day.</br></br>   no chapter this week   <br>Any Femapoo lewd pics?</br>  <br>That is adorable and kinda hot at the same time. <br><br>Do you think we'll ever get to see Killer's face and do you think he's going to be related to some other character ?</br></br></br>  <br>As someone said a week ago, this was just unnecessary, even with no amnesia getting to MH in time was a difficult feat to pull. Sabo could just have been too far away.</br>  <br> best manga ever <br>That's a bit of an exaggeration right there.</br></br>  <br>Capone reminds me a lot of my grandmother, warmed my heart. Very cute overall but I don't see why Hawkins should be smiling if male Hawkins is usually poker faced, right? Killer is the most bland one here to me, literally stuck his mask to a Nami clone.  Genderbend arc fucking when. </br>  <br>Except he was presumed dead for 10 years. Even if he thought Ace and Luffy didn't see it, someone from the town surely would and word would travel.</br>  <br> memory loss doesn't occur as a result of blunt and repercussive explosive head trauma. <br>It's really common in incidents like what happened to Sabo.<br>If Sabo had no memory loss, like Pell, that would be bad writing.</br></br></br>  <br>nah, she too cute man</br>  <br>btw your constant misuse of the word misogyny is laughable. please go to tumblr where your attitude and fucked up sense of reality is welcomed and encouraged</br>  <br>Did you not read what the characters are saying ? Hawkins is talking about love and shit. Not % of death.</br>  <br>well, he's able to fly with the crows apparently, i think Luffy got the news 7 days before the execution, so that's not really a good excuse.</br>  <br>Nigga, but that Drake tho.</br>  <br> Apparently the spelling is off <br><br>literally google the word</br></br></br>  <br> but Rukia is fine <br>wasn't her whole thing about her captain too? what's her ambitions anyway? But yeah, she's much better than Orihime, though I don't really know what dictates her actions besides Ichigo.<br><br> Yoruichi is also very strong. <br>I was mainly talking about the main female cast. But you're right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura wasn't just interested by Sasuke, she also showed many good traits. For example, she wanted to show to her childhood friend how much she had grown up, and she risked her life fighting against a dangerous terrorist. She also confessed to Naruto basically to help him. It's true that she is obsessed with Sasuke, and it's a very bad thing, but it overshadows her qualities.<br><br>Robin is a great character, I completely agree with you about that. It would be better if she wasn't portrayed as weak during battles. For example, she got easily "beaten" by Diamante's spikes despite that she had her full strength. Kind of strange.<br><br> If anything, it's the fact that Oda doesn't put them in situations where they have to fight or get brutally beaten is what might be upsetting. <br>I completely agree with you. I don't like women getting beaten up and violence overall, but they should be as involved in fights like men.<br><br><br>I verbally crushed you, so you had no choice than to put on a persona like you don't care. It's the best way to hide your anger, and also the worst way because it's obvious to people who studied psychology. Not acting seriously helps you to pretend your serious self doesn't feel offended, and now that you began to do so, you are forced to keep doing it because if suddenly go back to writing seriously, you will feel even more ashamed of yourself.<br><br>If I were wrong about you being the same person, you would have just said so, but instead, you kept replying in a naive way that I perfectly read through. You basically confirmed once again my point, and after realizing that putting a face to damage control wouldn't work, you decided to leave once again so that you wouldn't be even more humiliated.<br> Screw this, I'm done talking to you. Have a nice day. <br> So I'm going to leave you alone, as I'd have done IRL, had we met. So goodbye ~ <br>Don't pretend to be two different people on a thread next time, since this time you failed very hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's using someone else's crows which may not have been accessible 2 years ago. The problem is him not contacting either of them even though he blew up about 50 metres in front of the town.</br>  <br>The whole village was burned alive at the end of the flashback. The only way a villager would find out is if they joined the revolutionary army.<br><br>Amnesia after being blown up is reasonable.</br></br></br>  <br>Intercrural sex is dick between thighs, not going in the vagina</br>  <br>that's disgusting<br><br>but Apoo is still cute</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and he looks exactly like Sanjis next wanted poster.</br>  <br>No thanks.<br><br><br>I think she admired him as a person, not as a man.<br><br> I was mainly talking about the main female cast. But you're right <br>Unfortunately, the female main cast isn't very big, I would have liked Kubo to add one girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Intercrural  <br>Why the fuck am I getting red squiggleys ?I'm not spelling it wrong, am I ? <br><br> It would feel like heaven with Kalifa though. Although, I'm not an expert on what would happen to your dick with that much soap </br></br></br></br>  <br>A U T I S M</br>  <br> Why the fuck am I getting red squiggleys <br><br>I dont get them, are you using a brit-based spellcheck?</br></br></br>  <br>well it's Kalifa, so any kind of sex with her where she uses her powers would basically be forced withdrawal</br>  <br>Intelligence and psychology.</br>  <br>probably never, but hopefully Bonney arc will give us some cute pic related hijinks. <br><br>I really need to know Apoos tragic past. Did his parents not approve of him becoming a DJ or something?</br></br></br>  <br> yfw new bounties appear before Kidd Co vs Shanks <br> Killer starts sweating <br> Kidd, there's something I have to do before this <br> I need to find the damn Strawhats, right now <br> Cue Kidd Co vs StrawHeart </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Does the British not like fake doing it ?<br><br><br> forced withdrawal <br>Is this another sex thing I don't understand ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you just write your own story?<br>You can't use the patriarchy as an excuse because the most successful author of all time is both alive right now and a female.<br><br>Not even the anon you were arguing with.<br><br>You have a better mastery of literature than Oda, surely, after all he is a misogynist and you are culturally aware.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oda made it up recently, because the only purpose of this amnesia is to fill this hole. It will never be of any use or explanation in the future ever.</br></br>  <br> autistic SJW armchair psychologist <br>ok sure</br></br>  <br>you know what withdrawal is right? well if Kalifa was using her powers it would basically force your dick to leave whatever hole you had it in, she'd basically be forcing you to withdraw</br>  <br>do you think fodder actually die? like im pretty sure a shit ton of fodder died in the alabsta war, but what about later arcs? did people die from enel electroctuting them, did anyone die from the birdcage, the buster call, etc. or did oda literally throw what he wrote out the window?</br>  <br>Apoo looks happy as shit, what are you on about ? His parents were nice enough to buy him a bloody piano. And he actually has a comb, so he was probably in a normal family.</br>  <br> Not even the anon you were arguing with. <br>Really? Yet you are using the same childish irony that is usually never used on 4chan. Either you're the same person who came back once again or you're another person, but either way, know that such irony is pointless because it's basically just an empty attack that I've seen hundreds of time out of 4chan.<br><br><br>Thank you.<br><br><br>It would be a fun past. His parents would be proud of him now since he's a good DJ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I know what withdrawal means in terms of banks and drugs but I wad not aware you could use it in this context. <br><br>Also, we're talking about Kalifa, not Alvida. I mean, soap is slippery and all but it's not That bad. And it's between the thighs so you need some major grip to even do it normally.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo was shown at Logue Town looking at Luffy but not remembering him.<br>Dragon was shown rescuing him when ace died.<br><br>So all the way back at East Blue it was foreshadowed Sabo had amnesia, so I have to assume you are trolling or anime only.<br>Pic unrelated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> poor people don't have combs </br>  <br>  It would be better if she wasn't portrayed as weak during battles.  <br>When is Robin ever portrayed as weak? If anything, it's more of a consensus that her powers are too OP that it makes her fights boring. She just rarely gets long 1v1 fights because of this. Her last 1v1 fight on FI ended pretty quickly cause all she had to do was double clutch the guy. <br> she got easily "beaten" by Diamante's spikes despite that she had her full strength. <br>She wasn't really "beaten" by Diamante since she didn't even fight him? She just got injured from his spike balls because she was there to protect Rebecca since Luffy told her to. She pretty much sacrificed her well being to do so. Even with her being injured she didn't seem too worn out by the end of the day.<br><br> It's true that she is obsessed with Sasuke, and it's a very bad thing, but it overshadows her qualities. <br>That's the thing. It overshadows her other qualities because every goddamn time you think she can grow out of it, she goes back to square one with her Sasuke obsession. And why couldn't she become a medic ninja like Tsunade in the end instead of just a housewife? Do both? I don't know, it just made it seem like her character's end goal was to become Sasuke's wife and she achieved that in the end, yay. Good for her but that's not that admirable in my eyes. Same with Hinata, though at least she was gunning for a decent guy throughout the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, exactly, so why did he become a pirate?</br>  <br>Withdrawal in the sex term is when you take out your dick prior to cumming, and Kalifa's power is retardedly slippy, like how she actually cleaned Sanji's strength off</br>  <br>I wasn't attacking you, I was serious. Freedom of Speech suggests Oda can write his story however he wants, and you can write yours how you want.<br>So would not that course of action be more productive?</br></br>  <br>I did read what they were saying. So? Why the hell would lady Hawkins be talking about love when that's not male Hawkins' style at all. Just because it's a typical girly girl thing to do? That's how you do genderbend wrong. Personality and attitude should stay the same entirely imo.<br><br>Man Kuzan and Teach were such ugly ducklings. Who would you bully, /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Bonney looks like the only person who'd have a tragic past. Look at her. She's all fucked up.

What's up?</br>  <br>Oh, come on. Who's the one person besides Apoo to have used a comb ?</br>  <br>You asked why she was smiling. I answered why she was smiling.

The weaker braves would lose and the world would be plunged into darkness.  Oh yeah she is also a half human/half fiend </br></br></br>  <br>Did she NTR some guy?</br>  <br><br>Too soon, anon, too soon</br></br>  <br>Sounds like kind of a bitchy thing to do.</br>  <br>Let me guess, and due to her lineage she was ostracized and worse by people?<br><br>That's why she tries to do this kind of stuff?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's an edgemaster in a trench coat, what, did you expect so quality backstory?</br></br>  <br>Because  trench coats make my dick diamonds. Especially if a girl wears them .</br>  STOP SPOILERING ME REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  <br>Chill out Pepe.</br>  <br> &gt;coming to /a/ and not expecting spoilers </br>  <br>Stop hovering on the  black boxes  you retard.</br>  <br>More spoilers<br><br> Basically the Majin created a qt humanoid to go and rape a male. When she got pregnant she killed the guy and gave birth to Fremy. Fremy wanted to prove herself to the Majin and her mother and went to go kill the powerful saints. Then she got blown the fuck out by a powerful saint and the Majin and his bitch is like "should have aborted you." So now Fremy is trying to regain loyalty blah blah blah you'll figure it out sooner in the anime if the pace ever picks up </br></br></br>  <br>But the spoiler is in the unspoiled start of the thread</br>  <br>Well, that much has already been posted since episode 1 aired.</br>  <br><br>So now the strongest man in the world is going to turn her with the power of his dick.</br></br>  <br> She's not trying to regain her loyalty, her mom and the rest of the fiends she chilled with tried to kill her after failing, and now she's sworn revenge against them </br>  Why is Goldoofus such a chump?  <br> I read something about the first saint still being alive and being in love with a demon, how true is this? Does the first saint gag on demon dog cock like bunny? </br>  <br> This is not true   however, the saint of time after the third purge of the majin went crazy and started to hang out with the fiends to discover the origins of the majin <br> <br>Also adlet's sensei is the unknown warrior from 700 years ago</br> </br></br>  <br>He's 16 and was suckered by  BIG FAT BUNNY TATS .</br>  <br>Why did bunny have to take the demonic knot? Literal whore.</br>  <br>Because he's THE STRONGEST CUCK IN THE WORLD</br>  <br>I see, thanks. <br><br> Also bunny being fucked by demon dogs turns me on immensely, where is this revealed? I downloaded vols 1-3 of the translation just to read up on it. </br></br></br>  <br>Dude, he's 16. She's stupidly hot. Plus, she's a saint. And a princess. She's blatant waifubait until you get to know her. Not like he could be expected to know she was a filthy traitor and a cum-guzzling whore. Maybe her exhibitionism should have tipped him off, but the "less is more" dress code seems to not be all that unusual in their world.</br>  <br><br> it's not true, you got meme'd </br></br>  <br>Except even when it's shown that she lied to him his entire life and was also a traitor, he was still the biggest cuck to her</br>  <br><br>When was this? I want to read about bitch tears.</br></br>  <br>Vol3</br>  Daily reminder Bunny literally sucks dog penis  <br><br>Goddamn it. This is why I won't trust anything you guys say until someone provides a passage.</br></br>  <br>Not my first pick but yea</br>  <br>She hasn't betrayed my dick yet.</br>  <br>Could Goldolf beat Adlet?</br>  <br>In a one on one standard fight? Yes. Otherwise Adlet stands a good chance at just whittling him down</br>  <br>Even in his berserk MAH HIME mode?</br>  <br>Fucking Adlet. He is just the strongest cheater in the world.</br>  <br>I can't wait for the doujins of her pulling a train of demons after she gets fucked by Adlet and Goldof.</br>  <br>Using every method available to your advantage is not cheating, it's being strong</br>  <br>Goldof NTR doujins when</br>  <br>Grenadier Mushibugyo best girl.</br>  <br>So its Goldolf=Chamo&gt;Hans</br>  <br>More like Chamo&gt;Hans=Goldolf</br>  <br>She gets crippled later on, wouldn't fuck.</br>  How do you feel about this now being a thing?  <br>This is probably from a game, which are non canon.<br>Unless you show me a 30 min-1 hour long special of Bardock fighting Freiza's OTHER descendant who also sounds like him and going SSJ3 this is as Canon as LSSJ3 and LSSJ4 Broly.</br></br>  SSJ3 sucks anyway. It had a cool musical theme but that was it.  <br>Never said it was canon. But it does officially exist.</br>  <br>If it's not canon, why would I really care?</br>  <br>It's as official as any fan art on Deviant art.</br>  <br><br>Well that's nice, I like seeing whatifs as long as they're just transformations. <br><br>This isn't Venom beating Superman tier, I actually want to see Nappa and Raditz done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You cared enough to post about it</br>  <br>Heroes does a lot of what if transformations</br>  <br> officially exist <br>You know, there 'officially exist' gay hentai doujins of Goku and Vegeta.</br></br>  <br><br>Cool, always happy to see a what could have been.</br></br>  <br>Video Games in Japan.</br>  <br>Not ones that are officially licensed by the companies and are endorsed as official products.<br><br>Heroes is about as canon as GT. Official products, but not canon.</br></br></br>  <br>If it isn't canon then it doesn't matter. No reason to feel any strong opinions on it.</br>  <br>Heroes is good about that, like giving us stuff that should have happened.</br>  SSJ3 is something only goku should do. Anyway its a pretty worthless unstable form  <br>Why did he use it against Beerus anyway?</br>  Not really relevant, but since this is basically a DB franchise thread, anyone have the gif where we see flashes of Goku going SSJG? I saw it once when I was on my phone  Didn't Akira help make which Heros and Xenoverse which got him interested in dragonball again in the first place?  Who's ready for episode 3 of this season's obligatory battle academy harem LN adaptation? Airing in about 3 hours.   obligatory battle academy harem LN adaptation <br>Why do I have to be reminded about these</br>  Red a shit. A SHIT  Reminder that Misora is buttfuck material. (Like all tsun qts honestly.)  <br> whos ready to drop this series after the three episode rule <br><br>Man I didnt have any expectations for this show but I atleast though they'd play the traitor thing<br> out with some cool self-sacrificing backstory which resulted in the MC being shunned as his<br> actions were misunderstood. MC-kun would then be forced to walk his fated path alone <br>bearing the burden of his past, shunned by those around him.<br><br>Instead we just got some shitty "lol nope he just dropped out his team", seriously fuck this show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah the reason is pretty stupid but MC being based as fuck lets me get past this easily</br>  <br>Honestly what do you expect from light novels</br>  <br>Mind break dere transformation when?</br>  <br>Still better than Classroom Crisis.</br>  How long till it airs?  <br>The whole traitor thing is an excuse to have the MC be rejected by everyone and thus, a better self insert for the target audience</br>  This show makes me miss World Break, this is too pale in comparison.  <br>I dropped that. Is it still Ted Talks: The Anime?</br>  <br>Now I REMEMBER</br>  it's time for THK weekly thread  <br>How can a OP mc be rejected. He rejected them is more logical. How is OP mc needed other, They need him instead. He seens the strongest warrior in the dangerous teritory. You're not making any sense. Your hatred blinded you.</br>  5 mins<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  Blonde &gt; Black &gt; Red<br>No opinion on the other girls yet.<br>Normally I like tsunderes, but Red hasn't really shown any sort of unique personality or reasons to like her yet. Hopefully all of the girls will get better, her included, because so far none of them are really memorable.</br></br>  <br>Is there a stream?</br>  <br>What are you even saying? I don't even hate this, but it's a fact what the target audience for this kind of thing is and how it panders to them<br>It's been done in other similar shows before<br>You have an OP harem lead, who is rejected by everyone for being apparently useless or something (in this case, a traitor), but the truth is different, and MC-kun doesn't deserve the hate.</br></br></br>  <br>neetball</br>    <br>Many thanks!</br>          Why is the music for this series so unfitting?      <br>  enermius <br>So lists me all harem title that has similar setting like this one. Mr harem expertise?</br></br>    <br>  enermous <br>  have <br>Fck touchscreen.</br></br></br>        what a nerd    <br>Best fucking girl.</br>  red a shit     MC just whored her out all day   <br>But there was none like this during the spring</br>  I lost my shit at that ice cream man. That was just great.  <br>Such a pimp</br>        <br>My heart.</br>        muh shitty drama  <br>looks like the tip of a cock entering her mouth from below the screen</br>      <br>There is no battle yet? Not even an ecchi scene? Are we watching playing vn the animation now ?</br>  <br>Not enough budget for that much action. The opening scene of the first episode already drained a lot.</br>  Misora a shit. A SHIT.  <br>No u</br>  friendly reminder that target audience for this show is<br>kids going through puberty and not little girls that /a/ is generally occupied by.</br>  <br>Aw this post reeks so much of an anal devastation.</br>  <br>Muh obingo swordsman.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437584 <br>Senketsu has released the softsub for this series.</br>   that ice cream man <br>A true bro.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128437584 <br><br> ayy lmao <br> 3DPD <br> movieshit <br><br><br><br><br>Fuck off summerfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's actually shit &gt; every girl in the story</br>  <br>It's still Funi subs</br>  I quite like the red tsundere but the last part ruined a real comfy episode.  Why does she want to use the sword so badly?  <br>How fucking autistic are you to be bothered by a japanese girl low note crying?<br> Le comfy <br>You already know what to fix. You are living. Work hard to fix that by killing yourself</br></br></br>  <br>What is it with harems and them ruining episodes with shitty drama.</br>  <br>Damn, dude. Calm down. I just could have done without that part, that is all.<br><br>Not sure what provoked that aggressive response.</br></br></br>  <br> Honestly what do you expect from generic battle harem light novels <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>Hyperbolistic claims bring about hyperbolistic responses</br>  Mangafags spoilers please. Why did red get so mad at being told to switch classes? Guessing it was something like muh sister was this type and died now I have to be this type.  <br>Yeah I was actually somewhat enjoying it until the end. MUH DRAMA. MUH SWORD. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND MY DEEP CHARACTER.<br><br>Misora a shit and just when I thought she got better this episode. Typical woman expecting everyone to just read her mind and know all her problems.</br></br></br>  Red made poor ice-cream man cry, unforgivable  <br><br><br>That was just too much. Ice-cream man and the ice-cream didn't deserve that ;_;</br></br></br>  MC's bro is going to get the blonde. Thats nice.  Hey.<br><br>HEY!<br><br>I like red.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I really liked her this episode up until the retarded last part.<br><br>Same with the blonde who I really didnt like before. She was cute as fuck this ep.</br></br></br>  Yuri a slut  Holy goooddd the red haired bitch again holy shiiiit she makes me so angry. How can a human being be such a fucking bitch <br> OH MY GOD I HAVE MY PROBLEMS  <br> OH MY GOD YOU DON'T KNOW MY PROBLEMS <br> OH MY GOD I HATE YOU <br>Well, looks like YOU DON'T HAVE A GOD YOU GODLESS PIECE OF SHIT FUCK OFFFFFFF</br></br></br></br>  Someone make a icecream webm  <br/>  <br>THK pls.</br>  <br>TLK pls.</br>    <br>Most touching moment of the series.<br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Despite typping like a faggot, he makes a fair point</br>  <br>What's technical name for that shitty effect?</br>  <br>Slow motion + motion blur.</br>  <br>I just say the Matrix.</br>  <br>I'm ready for more of best girl.</br>  <br>I thought she was going to turn out to be Claire 2.0 but she's surprisingly not that big of a bitch.</br>  <br>Yeah. As much of a shitty tsundere she is, she's leagues better than Claire.</br>  <br>I just made ice cream to honor his great service in the line of duty.<br><br>;_;7</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh piss off, THK. You already said that last time and the week before that. Claire and MIsora are both cute and good. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br> Claire is cute and good </br>  <br> Claire is cute and good </br>  <br><br>Fuck off THK.</br></br>  Blue &gt; Yellow &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Red  where is the narcissist girl? I like her the best.  <br><br>Stop samefagging. Your hate was always worthless and can never argue, THK. Claire is easily top 3 cutest and is a adorable tsundere that develops by warming up to the MC. She's also docile at times and easily succumbs to pressure, so she is more bark than her bite, and that makes her cuter considering the fact she behaves like a small animal who clings to the MC out of ownership that is affectionate and not overbearing.</br></br>  <br>Red &gt; Blue &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yellow</br>  Is she autistic?  Misora is the only reason I'm watching this crap show.  <br><br>I only posted b8 pic, but I'm not gonna bother with screenshoot because you'll just say "nice shoop"</br></br>  <br>Why is she so cute?<br><br><br>Mein nigga.</br></br></br></br>  Daily THK lore thread?  <br>What does THK stand for?</br>  So if I hate the red bitch I'm THK now?  <br>Turbo homosexuals konspiracy.</br>   Look, you suck at A but would be pretty good at B. As your instructor (you know, the guy who is supposed to guide your potential in the proper direction) I think you should switch to B. <br> WAAAAH I DON'T WANT TO <br>  Why? You would be way better if you switched to B. <br> WAAAH YOU DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS I NEVER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT WHICH YOU WOULDN'T KNOW UNLESS YOU WERE A CREPPY STALKER. WAAAH I'M GOING HOME. <br> I don't know what I expected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's how retards in denial operate here</br>  <br><br><br>Tsundere hating Kike</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't cute. She's a shit.</br>  <br>I take it you're new here. It's stands for tsunhater-kun. You know, like LRD is for LolisRDead. Both are autistic shitposters to the highest degree possible.</br>  <br>This so fucking much, people like only becayse "muh zr, small tits and red hair so kawai"</br>  Who /THK/ here?  <br> I don't really hate her or have anything against tsunderes, I just thought that scene was fucking retarded.</br>  <br>Depends if you can justify your shit taste without sounding like THK. It's not like THK never played the pretend card before.</br>  Rico is for manlet masochists who fantasize getting their dicks crushed by her but never will.  <br>Me<br><br>Claire and Misora are poop</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I can sorta sympathize. People trying to tell you you're shit at what you're trying to be better at and making you do this instead would not lead to a good reaction.</br>  <br> shit taste <br><br>This Shitsorafag is already mad as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Maybe, but the guy wasn't being a dick about it or anything.<br> How hard would be it to properly explain why she wants to stay in her class no matter what?</br></br>  <br><br>How was this retarded? Your greentext that shits over the context of the scene and making it sound retarded is what's retarded here. Misora is obviously attached to her sword canon for personal reasons, and she is trying her best. She wants to keep at it. The MC thinks something else is better for her, but that's his opinion as an instructor. He might know better, but he doesn't know Misora's personal reasons to stick to the sword canon. She got upset because from her PoV, he's acting like he understands, but he obviously doesn't.</br></br>  <br>She wasn't being a bitch about it either, so what's your point. She got emotional and was hurt by his thoughtless comment.</br>  <br>That wasn't the issue. She wanted to keep using her outdated cannon sword, but instructor didn't and just went, "you're not cut out for this so try that instead." Yeah, he wasn't a dick, but certain expectations clashed which led to this.</br>  <br>This scene is how an American girl would react to her teacher. Sasuga half howaitto piggu.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128445894 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128445972 <br>You're not even being subtle, THK. Third week and you're still doing this kind of shit. Go do something else.</br></br>  <br><br>So why didn't she tell him?<br>She even could have said there's just a special reason without getting into details</br></br></br>  <br> He isn't acting like A GODDAMN INSTRUCTOR should.<br> He's a coach, not a fucking life advisor, he's not supposed to know your life soty and your traumas.<br> That's like a football player getting mad at his coach for telling him to switch from playing in a different position just because his father played in that position.<br> If she has a personal reason to stick to her shitty class, then she should have explained it instead of expecting a dude she was known for a few days to know about it.<br><br><br> She wasn't being a bitch about it <br> Getting mad at someone who was just trying to help you and running out of the classroom instead of facing him is a bitch thing to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   you will never receive handjob from, whatever is her name <br><br>On the side note: stop this shitposting against tsundere(s). Till MC isn't beated by her like it happened with Louise clones, etc, it's completely bearable.</br></br>  <br>We're not overemotional hormone-ridden high school girls so we'll never know.</br>  <br>*He is acting like<br>*life story</br></br>  <br> muh THK boogeyman </br>  <br>This guy's gonna try to rape her huh?</br>  <br>Read my post again untill you understand it you dumbfuck. If you don't understand it call your mom so she can explain it to you. She isn't even a tsundere you idiot. Taiga is a tsundere. Kirino is a tsundere. Redbitch is not a tsundere. She is. a. fucking. bitch.</br>  <br>Why doesn't a highly emotional and temperamental 14-year-old girl who got upset just tell him? I wonder why.<br><br><br>She didn't get mad at him for trying to help her, idiot. She got mad at him for thinking he understands and knows her enough to make her give up the person she sticks to for personal reasons. Either way, this can't even be defined as a tantrum. She didn't lashed out or outburst, she got emotional and upset in a low-key manner. Simple as that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rias?</br></br>  <br>Did he appeared before?</br>  <br> But he never thought he understood her, he just knew her strenghts and was trying to exploit her potential. How would he know about her personal shit anyway? He isn't even supposed to give two fucks about it.<br><br> And crying, shouting at someone and running is considered a fucking tantrum pretty much everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying tsundere usually have dere at the beginning <br>0/10</br></br>  <br> Why doesn't a highly emotional and temperamental 14-year-old girl  <br>So you agree that she's a bitch?</br></br>  <br>Tsunderes usually aren't complete bitches at the beginning.</br>  <br>Who voiced that nerd?</br>  /THK/ here. Fuck youre're waifu she is shit  Surprised no one has brought up the fact Chloe just decided to come into the MC's room at night like it's no big deal making herself comfortable.<br><br>Fucking slut.</br></br>  <br>Yes they are, you fucking newshit. Why would they be dere for someone they don't know yet.</br>  Why do magic academies have the best uniforms?  <br> I only know of the shitty modern tsunderes guise </br>  <br>Osanajimmie<br>Isn't Kanata in love with her?</br></br>  <br>Well since she is modern then obviously I was talking about her type.</br>  <br> he never thought  <br>That's what she sees from her perspective, idiot. Do you know what empathy is? Surely as an adult you acquire the ability to understand what empathy is. Apply it.<br><br>You obviously never have witnessed a real tantrum before. She's not in distress or is ranting angrily or being overly resistance to getting pacified. The fact she can leave because she can't deal with her emotional anger means she has some control, nigga.<br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I thinks it's time we give a name to the bitchy tsundere loving faggot<br>How do we call him?</br>  <br>Mate, that's their defining trait. They're always bitches at first.</br>  <br> nope <br>And why's that?<br>Someone who can't keep their emotions in check is a bitch, it's a common knowledge</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah because the whole point of "classic" tsundere isn't that they're hostile, mean, abrasive, combative, or whatever you define as bitch at the start. Nope. <br><br>No, you fucking shitposter.</br></br></br></br>  <br> How dare she visit a friend she knew since they were little kids. Such a slut, that Chloe! <br><br>Fucking Christ, this thread is terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>We already did it. It's TLK.</br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  <br> And her perspective is retarded.<br> And that was the typical "I HATE YOU MOM, I WILL LOCK MYSELF IN MY BEDROOM AND CRY FOR TWO HOURS" tantrum.</br></br>   manchildren disconnected to how teenagers think. <br><br>Every time.</br></br>  THK will never leave us.  <br> THK and obnoxious anti-tsunfags still trying hard <br>Yellow is still objectively worst girl no matter how hard they try.</br></br>  <br>Red is objectively the best girl no matter how hard you deny it.</br>  Can we all agree Rico is best grl?  <br> every teenager is agressive, loud and highly emotional <br>Every time</br></br>  <br> deny it <br>Why would anyone do that when it is true?</br></br>  <br> Not thinking about the majority <br><br>Sasuga, /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off TLK</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>You must live in some 3 world shithole, because here bitches were the minority, though they were the most popular kids</br>  <br> the majority of teenagers you encountered were whiny little shits that threw tantrums and couldn't speak their mind clearly <br>I pity you. Puberty must have been a nightmare.</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? That's not what the term bitch means as a slang that is reserved for malicious, vindictive, cold-heart, cruel, and for more American culture comparison: mean girls. <br><br><br>Getting emotional over personal attachment that is deeply rooted in you isn't retarded, especially if someone who sounds adamant tries to take that away from you. <br><br>The way she got upset and left is nothing like that. You might want to try again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tell me of this Valhalla where teenagers act like mature and well adjusted people.</br></br>  <br>Well, for me, in  denbtistan  they were really okay, but I did go to a very fancy school</br>  <br> if they don't act like x, so they must act like y <br>There's more than just 2 models of behaviour, you know</br></br>  <br>Nah, teens are the closest you can get to 2D caricatures.</br>  <br>You forgot you are on /a/, retards here think that only two biggest extreemes exist.</br>  <br>Ok, there was a the third model, where they din't act like complete assholes, but also didn't pretend to be mature.</br>  <br><br><br>Can you fags exaggerate harder? In the first place, Chinese cartoons don't even depict teenagers in the way you guys are implying here. Secondly, most teens do in fact go through some form of rebellion or immature phases in some way that can be attributed to acting out. The range of behavior and emotions that falls under acting out is numerous. Getting into arguments with parents is definitely the most common act, and it can get heated. <br><br>That aside, most are manchildren here, so don't act like how most here behaves isn't generally the same anyways.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all that projection <br>anon, we're just saying if you are mad about something, say why you're mad instead of leaving</br></br>  Misora's mom is best girl.<br> mfw we are getting a milf </br>  So does Red turn dere or does she remain hotheaded?  <br>Those fags thoughtlessly screaming bitch this and that behave like the teens they complain about. They lack empirical understanding as adults too. Hilarious irony, I would say.</br>  Well Kanata's problem is that he didnt know that misora have attachments with her sword and well since he knows nothing and she wont say anything right from the start about her past that made her attached with the sword no one can actually blame him for what happened.  Why are you guys fighting?  <br>Is she alive? She's probably the reason for Red wanting to use that weapon.</br>  <br>It's a battle harem after all</br>  <br>I bet that was you in your mind.</br>  <br> Is she alive? <br>Probably not.<br> She's probably the reason for Red wanting to use that weapon. <br>That's probably it. I'm gonna call this too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsundere apologists at its finest.</br>  <br> One side says Misora was a bitch for screaming at Kanata and running.<br> The other side says she was justified and this is normal for a teenager.<br> And then a bunch of faggots are claiming the other two girls are best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, by the way this is best girl</br>  <br>fuck off</br>   People asking why won't Misora tell him why she's mad <br><br>Because drama. And it was the end of the episode so we needed a cliffhanger. That's really all there is to it. Seeing as how next episode is called The Unforgettable Past and we see what looks like Misora's sister in the preview, there's little doubt she'll explain herself next week and this situation would resolve quickly.<br><br>And I don't get the whole she's a bitch thing. She got emotional but I wouldn't say "bitch," at least not in the definition I'm thinking of. She's actually a bit mellow for a tsundere archetype; I was expecting some high-flying kick when Kanata accidentally touched her tits and &gt;implied something about her chest size.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan thread <br> THK sperging because of his muh tsundere hate <br>Every thread THK enters ever.</br></br></br>  <br>Careful with that edge bro</br>  <br>See<br/></br>  <br>So let just say that everyone is right and wrong at the same time.</br>  <br>Misora is superior though, but okay.</br>  <br>Wouldnt really call it a claim, more of an objective fact.</br>  <br>Everyone making a fuss over her yelling and running, its not like she is trying kill him or something like that</br>  <br> Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan thread <br> TLK sperging because of his muh tsundere best girl <br>Every thread TLK enters ever.</br></br></br>  <br>Joke post.</br>  <br> Maybe when she learns to talk with people, because so far she is as insufferable as tsunderebitch and the other slut.<br> Fuck them, MC is best girl.</br></br>  subtle  <br>Nah, she is too selfabsorbed narcissist so far</br>  <br>Honestly all of their personalities suck ass. Black hair is just a narcissistic retard, Red acts<br> like the biggest bitch since Kirino and Blonde just has some weird strain of social anxiety <br>mixed with autism</br></br></br>  <br>It's annoying that retards here can't understand typical clichés of storytiming in battle harems.</br>  <br> Red acts like the biggest bitch since Kirino <br>That's exaggeration, she didn't hit MC at all (and probably never will because he's vastly better than them)</br></br>  <br> it's cliche so it's ok </br>  Why is Misora such a shit?  <br>What the fuck, man? Red is tame and rather mellow. That's far from being biggest bitch. She's actually hardly even a bitch.</br>  <br> Fuck them, MC is best girl. <br>This. I like it when the MC is composed enough to not overreact or hold a grudge when the girls overreact. It makes them look like the three stooges rather than the three megabitches.</br></br>  Why is Rico such a shit?  <br>The only thing shit here is your taste.</br>  <br>Its ok because everybody's already tagged this as "that seasonal battle harem", there are no expectations therefore anything is acceptable</br>  <br>Because shitty redhead tsundere.</br>  <br>Don't respond, it's the same people who don't think Claire was the most tame tsundere ever</br>  Why is Lecty such a shit?  <br> Clairefag </br>  <br> who don't think Claire was the most tame tsundere ever <br>what<br>I watched only anime but she was a colossal bitch, this red head is much better</br></br></br>  <br>If you can't stand it then why are you forcing yourself to watch it? It's watching mecha and complaing why MC got OP or unique machine.</br>  <br> defending your 'best girl' <br> isnt even actual best girl </br></br>  <br>She's faking narcissism to hide her turbo M side.<br><br><br>She's the typical shy girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br> same people <br>You mean THK.</br></br>  <br> TLK at it again </br>  <br>Is this genderswapped Kanye?</br>  <br> typical shy girl <br>I feel like they really overexhaggerated her shyness to the point where it gets repetitive and annoying</br></br>  <br> THK <br>Epic.</br></br>  <br><br>Forget everything else. The ice cream did nothing wrong damnit.</br></br>  Osananajimi and MC OTP.  <br> She's faking narcissism to hide her turbo M side. <br>This is relevant to my interests.</br></br>  What are they pulling here? In next episode Nerd will confess and she will reject him?  <br> they really overexhaggerated  <br>I feel the same about narcissistic girl, but I don't find that annoying</br></br>  <br>Both Claire and Misora are adorable and quite tame, the latter more so but I wouldn't call either one most tame. Those retarded haters are still wrong though.</br>  <br> confess <br> He will rape her</br></br>  <br><br> THK is at it again <br>Keep proving it with your typical response and denial</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga what? That came out of nowhere.</br>  <br>Says the one who uses THK as stock response to anything negative towards tsundere.</br>  <br>Partly why Yellow is the worst girl. Out of all the girls, she acts and behaves in a way that is least human. She's like a creature, a very annoying creature.</br>  <br>Idk, Claire was just like a cute animal, sort of lost and confused. Honestly was very tame</br>  <br>I love how these threads blow up instantly whenever Red gets any negative comments.</br>  <br> Did you miss the part when he got a boner and suddenly everything turned flowerish?</br>  <br> Claire  <br> tame <br>Yeah, "hurr durr I'll burn you to tinders" and "hurr durr you're my salve spirit" every episode is really cute and adorable</br></br></br>  <br>yeah what the fuck happened in this scene are they trying too ruin the harem</br>  <br> boner = rapist <br>Nigga please, how can you possibly conclude this?</br></br>  <br>As spoilers anon said, he isn't interestend in any of the main girls</br>  <br> He enjoyed his flower-boner and the pseudo-handjob and he will come back for more.</br>  <br> Which one is the one he is interested in from his previous team? Yuri or the other one?</br>  <br>Is this a spoiler from the LNs?</br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br><br>Those are done very cutesy and not serious to do harm or out of contempt, so yeah, it is. The fact she gradually warms up and become less abrasive to the point she can be docile creates a strong impression of being tame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Maybe. </br>  <br>Supposedly his osanajimmie, Chloe</br>  <br> <br>Childhood friend</br></br>  <br><br><br>More spoilers  Red a shit </br></br></br>  <br> ctrl+f a shit <br> 9 are from same person spamming like a retard <br>THK keeps being autistic shitposter, of course people will react. Better than what he did in here, but it's still no excuse for shitposting and forcing hate.</br></br></br>  <br> i perceived it as cute and I'm objectively right <br>Claire is still a bitch.</br></br>  How do I know if I'm THK or not?  <br> Isn't Yuri his chilhood friend too?</br>  <br> Those are done very cutesy and not serious to do harm or out of contempt, so yeah, it is <br>It's annoying and overdone. <br>She was basically "huh you aren't acting like I want you to? fuck you I'm gonna kick you because of that", in other words, bitch</br></br></br>  <br>If you don't shitpost, you aren't.</br>  <br> whos ready to drop this series after the three episode rule <br> 3 episode rule <br> Believing in such raw autism <br>You deserve every bit of disappointment you got out of this</br></br></br></br>  <br> she gradually warms up <br> her element is fire </br></br>  <br> persecution complex <br><br><br>THK doesn't exist. It's a boogeyman retards made.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Novel anon said that girl he likes isn't "hurr traitor" towards him so Yuri doesn't fit.</br>  All the 3 girls give me cancer. Overly dere girl, extremely shy pussy, and the one who thinks she's hot shit.<br><br>Anyhow the one that pisses me off is the one who's shy, fucking crying cunt.</br></br>  <br>How do I know you're not THK pretending you don't exist and samefagging like you're just a meme?<br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/12752<wbr>2832/#127536238</wbr> <br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>  <br> Misora <br> overly dere <br> Where?</br></br></br>  <br> THK, or more like, any-negative-tsundere-poster stalker is here <br><br>Seek help.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>THK pls</br></br></br>  I would trade this crappy ass shit for 2 episodes of monster musume a week.  <br>TLK pls</br>  <br>TLK pls.</br>  <br>Monster Musume is shit, the MC of Kuusen is miles ahead of that faggot</br>  I don't get it. I see the same shitty one liners from anons about tsundere girls in other threads but they don't get the THK treatment. What makes this thread special?  <br><br>Wow, there are two shitposters doing their typical THKshit routine here?<br>Aren't you ashamed of yourself wasting time on such unpopular show while you could shitpost two other?</br></br></br>  <br> Tsunderefags get butthurt if you don't like the cliche red-haired tsudenre of the battle harem anime of the season.</br>  <br> i perceived it as bitch and I'm objectively right <br>Nice argument.<br><br><br>She caused no lasting harm and is too much of a pure child with selfish, but pure intentions to be viewed as annoying or overdone. She acts a bit haughty, thinking she is the master, but that is just a front that easily crumbles away, so it's not even serious. MC takes charge and handles Claire, in turn her docile nature starts to act up. The interaction between them is literally painted with the attribute of moe-ness. To perceive it as negative or bitch is literally not what the author intended, so you're reading it incorrectly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's actually more than two, but keep denying it</br>  <br>This shitposter(s) is only in certain thread, like raildex, inou-bato, saekano</br>  <br>It depends. The THK spouting retards only reside in threads like Raildex, StB, BD and a specific seasonal harem like this one. <br><br>You can easily tell because threads like IS and Oreimo don't have this retardation even though the tsundere hate is just as apparent.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean the THK memers right? Because those series have natural hatred towards the tsundere girls.</br>  <br>Deflect harder at provided evidence of your samefagging and shitposts. As if the the deleted posts seeped in autism and perbuating tsundere hate wasn't enough, daily posts * a shit. A SHIT posts 24/7 and even leaving them at the end of a thread you spammed in at page 10 (sage post if not at bump limit) has become your damn signature.</br>  <br> inou-bato <br>I didn't really see any of this. The only thing I remember was everyone blowing up over Hatoko's anti-chuni rant.</br></br>  <br> paranoia <br><br>Deleted posts also don't prove shit. Mods can ban several people simultaneously.</br></br></br>  <br> more than two <br>You and your phone doesn't count as two, much less three. Only THK has ever been the one to create and force "TLK" out of spite because of the shit THK gets over the years. Logic stands you're samefagging as usual.</br></br>  <br> memers <br>Kill yourself<br> those series have natural hatred towards the tsundere girls <br>How does "series" have hatred towards anything? They aren't human beings</br></br></br></br>  <br>Quit your tinfoil hat.</br>  <br>That scene was only memorable thing in anime. Beside that threads were/are just cancerous waifuwar shitposting.</br>  Teach me the THK lore pls  <br>First thread with the ban was caused by global 8 ban. All posts from that IP got deleted, including unconnected posts. Second thread has the same shit going on. Try again.</br>  <br>THK has pretty much reached meme status. People will call you THK as a knee-jerk response if you express your hate for a tsundere.<br><br> How does "series" have hatred towards anything? They aren't human beings <br>I meant the series' threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>THK posting is easy to imitate to b8 retards like you</br>  <br>google</br>  Someone update me, what does TLK stand for?  <br>Well if you treat her as some pet instead of human then ok</br>  <br>Tsundere Lover-kun because retarded shitstain THK thinks that being annoyed by his constant shitposting automatically means loving tsunderes</br>  As someone who used to lurk in BD threads I'm tired of this THK shit, people should just ignore or report the shitposters<br>No need to take the bait</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128396<wbr>330/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  なるべく諦めない！<br>なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

It's pretty silly. My advice still stands though.</br>  <br>To me it looks like a they're trying to compare the appearance hiragana to the katakana...</br>  <br>Which is stupid, because there's no direct relationship.

I'm personally not using anki with a timer, because it's not rare for me to do other things while I do my reps and anyway I don't see the appeal of stressing myself over a timer, the goal is to get what I need to learn into my skulls.<br><br>Is it anki deciding I'm too dumb for a particular card and "deleting" it from my deck? How can I prevent this? It's true sometimes there are cards that are fairly hard for me to remember but that doesn't mean I want to give up. Usually I can recognize myself if I don't care about a card and I simply delete it myself, I don't want anki to do that behind my back.<br><br>tl;dr : how can I prevent anki from doing this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is it anki deciding I'm too dumb for a particular card and "deleting" it from my deck? <br>It's not deleting it, it's suspending it. You can unsuspend it manually by going into Browser and filtering by suspended cards. Then you can pick which cards to unsuspend or keep suspended.<br><br> tl;dr : how can I prevent anki from doing this? <br>You don't. Anki is your bro.</br></br></br></br></br>   the particle wa (は) is a subject-particle - similiar to the first or fourth case <br><br>These fuckers think I know my own language.</br></br>  <br>Go into the options and look around. You can switch the Leech action from "Suspend card" to "Tag only"<br><br>It doesn't "delete" your cards, it suspends them. You can find them easily in the deck browser. It doesn't "do it behind your back", it tells you straight up with a prominent message. It's not about being "dumb", it's about not wasting time in Anki.</br></br></br>  <br>Google it none of us really know grammar like that not even japs know their own grammar, grammar is bullshit.</br>  <br>Pretty stupid advice for someone who has started Core2k/6k and Tae Kim/Genki grammar. If you aren't capable of doing anything aside spewing platitudes, don't post.</br>  Are 以上 and 以下 inclusive? I mean, if I say<br><br>このゲームをやるには４人以上のプレイヤーが必要です<br><br>do I mean that the game requires four players or more? Or do I mean that it requires more than four players?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, inclusive always.</br>  <br> Pretty stupid advice for someone who has started Core2k/6k and Tae Kim/Genki grammar. <br>Not really. If anything, before you get halfway through TK, reading is more important than Core. And after that then reading is still just as important as Core, and TK takes a backseat to those two as a trickle of information.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for the replies, got it.</br></br>  <br>I can (partially) vouch for this. I hadn't even gone through half of Tae Kim and knew something like 600 kanji plus 1 or 2 words for each of those kanji when I decided to try my hand at actual reading and I was greatly rewarded for it. My first reading experience was with LN's by the way. It was hard and demanding but I managed to read an LN front to back and by the end of it I felt like I had learned more Japanese from the LN than the totality of the Japanese I knew before I started it. I know that's not quantifiable, I just mean to say it was probably the biggest leap in learning Japanese I ever took. <br><br>Of course, the amount guesswork I had to do was huge, but my personal experience has taught me that there is no long term harm in making wrong guesses as you read. The benefits far outweigh the problems. The important thing is to press on and try to learn as much as you can from the text, as if it were a huge collection of example sentences in a learners book. Full of juicy information to be obtained.<br><br>Also, I said partially because I didn't try reading before I had acquired at least a minimal vocabulary. I can only confidently say it pad off for me and I knew at a good amount of really basic words, the kind that come up dozens of times each time you sit down to read something. Still, I personally believe that even without knowing many of those you can still work your way through, since you'll be forced to learn them early while reading anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What LN did you read?</br>  <br>変態王子と笑わない猫<br><br>Not hard, but not too easy on a beginner either. It uses a harder voabulary than something like oreimo in my opinion, but that can be my biased view at work because I read it when I was only just starting.</br></br></br>  What's the deal with adverbs followed by は? <br><br>私は、前ほど高い所が恐ろしくはない。 <br><br>Surely the second は isn't needed? What purpose does it serve here?</br></br></br></br>  <br>....が</br>  <br>The way I have always interpret it is as<br>それ、食べたくはない = I don't particularly feel like eating that.<br><br>I read it somewhere, for example, when asked to go out with a group of friends.<br>行きたくはない = I don't want to go (but feel free to tell me all about it once you come back)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>afaik it's equivalent to 恐ろしくない</br>  <br>It's the conjunctive form of the adjective.<br><br>I'm going to assume that it's using は before the ない because ない&lt;-ある and the copula is a bitch about abnormal nuanced uses of particles.</br></br></br>  Is this website <br>http://kitsunekko.net/<br>with incorrectly timed subtitles really the best and only resource for watching Japanese media with Japanese subtitles.

If you can't be bothered to even learn katakana how will you ever learn kanji?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah definitely. In the beginning I'd get hung up on every little thing I didn't understand. I still do that kind of but I try to finish whatever I'm reading first as long as I understand it and come back to the small stuff later.</br></br>  <br>To be fair I rather agree that it might be best to simply learn Katakana as you go. Of course writing them all 50 times or so like you did for Hiragana is necessary but afterwards there's no need to force it I think.

Please blog about it, I'm genuinely interested to see how far this insane experiment goes.</br>  <br>you can't learn Japanese</br>  <br>I did RTK before the Yokohama book but I found the method very strange, reading Kanji with English words felt weird to me, like... "Food Action Mouth House Before"... and so on, it was rather hard you see? Though I respect if people like the method!

I'll do that.</br>  <br>No, you need to spend at least a month practicing hiragana before moving on to anything else. After that spend two months doing katakana because it's twice as hard. After that you should about a year learning grade 1 jouyou kanji and working through Genki I (this is the same pace they go at in universities so you may find it a little intense, but ganbaru!!!).</br>    こんちには みさなん おんげき ですか？ わしたは げんき です。<br>この ぶんょしう は いりぎす の ケブンッリジ だがいく の けゅきんう の けっか<br>にげんん は もじ を にしんき する とき その さしいょ と さいご の もさじえ あいてっれば<br>じばんゅん は めくちちゃゃ でも ちんゃと よめる という けゅきんう に もづいとて<br>わざと もじの じんばゅん を いかれえて あまりす。 <br>どでうす？　ちんゃと よゃちめう でしょ？</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me why I love Kanji.</br>  <br>It's not even legible.</br>  <br>Doing custom study --&gt; review forgotten cards to review the cards you failed earlier that day can be helpful.<br><br>Using "Review ahead" or "Study by card state or tag" to is a bad idea though. <br>You review cards before they're due, which means you might pass the next review even if you would've failed it otherwise...then then you pay the price a few weeks/months down the road when you've stopped cramming and all those artificially inflated cards come back.<br><br>The only time you should use it is when you're cramming for a test.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Study more.</br>  <br><br>Second.

Hell, it's not even clear how Giorno got that picture of Dio he has, or if Dio was aware of the fact he'd knocked some women up.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thank you.

You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let's be fair, half of the shit him and Misaka joked/commented on would've never came to surface with a different girl.  Purple is my way of life.  <br>No. Don't listen to Misakafags either.</br>  <br>Just reminding you guys that in NT9 he admitted he just bullshit's what he says so the enemy lowers his guard.</br>  <br>  <br> Quit downplaying Touma's speech just because you can't accept it for what it is. Touma has made many speeches before, but hardly the kind we saw in NT13. He got seriously mad at High Priest for badmouthing Misaka, who Touma defends and praises and acknowledges as the person who saved him. <br>This post sounds so much like tumblr holy shit</br></br></br>  Killed in production.<br>We can all relax.<br><br>http://screenrant.com/scarlett-joha<wbr>nsson-ghost-in-shell-financing-atte<wbr>mpts-falter/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> bring back Oshii <br>Hell no.<br>Just stop galvanizing body, it was dead long ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Ghost in the Shell doesn't need to be Japanese to be a good story. It's about technology and loss of identity in the future.<br><br>Psycho Pass does, because the collective society shit is deliberately contrasted with western values.<br><br>But Ghost in the Shell? Please, you just need a director worth a damn i.e. not the fucking guy who did Snow White and the Huntsman</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> giving a fuck about hollyguud productions. </br>  <br><br>If I didn't have a pedestrian fixed chari, I would be doing this.</br></br>  Ghost in the Shell is shit anyway and a movie with Scarlet would be its saving grace. Faggots. All of you.  ITT Overhated anime.<br><br>I'll start with the obvious.</br></br>  <br>Take out DBZ on the list. Real deal fags and manime tards think that's the Magnus Opus of anime.</br>  <br>In other words, fuck off back to /m/</br>  <br>Some, yes. 90% no. <br><br>I'd agree with 90% of harem or LN protagonists though. Still doesn't make it better.</br></br></br>  <br>His PTSD seemed to both come up and hinder him in the GG arc (from what I've seen of it, anyway).<br><br>Again, Tatsuya fits that descriptor so much better because his weakness are 'average' looks (all the women still want him) andmagic enhancing surgery making him unable to feel strong emotion (i.e. he's your typical 'badass' stoic). Also, he's supposed to be bad at normal magic, but still outperforms almost everyone else at it.</br></br></br>  <br>You're gonna have to throw a bone to those arguing "Gary Stu" by showing something he's not good at. It's like those character bios you see. Besides, why waste time covering said flaws? Unless they're relevant to the plot, it doesn't have to be in the spotlight.</br>  This watered down, censored butchering, is why the anime industry sucks so bad now days.<br><br>I can deal with 95% of the new animes every season consisting of moe/ecci/shounen/mild shounen-ai pandering for female otakus, usually devoid of any depth whatsoever. That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make animes out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everything takes place in a video game, so technically it is not real <br>Actually everything takes place in a real fantasy world that had a ton of videogame characters made real dropped into it.</br></br>  <br> IT IS A VIDEO GAME SO IT DOESN'T COUNT <br> IT HAS TO TAKE PLACE IN A REAL WORLD SETTING <br><br>There is no pleasing people.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Your reading comprehension is splendid.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, just drop it and watch the two good fantasy anime of the season instead.</br>  <br> Everything takes place in a video game, so technically it is not real. <br><br>Actually...</br></br></br>  CAUSE I FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL~  I<br>WOULD LIKE TO SHOW</br>  JIBUN WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO</wbr>  SOME DAYS<br>SOME NIGHTS</br>  <br>CUT OPEN MY SKULL</br>  <br>LOOK INTO MY HEAD</br></blockquote>]
