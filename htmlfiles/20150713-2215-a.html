[ Can we talk about how they fucked up the first episode?  No because the first episode was pretty good.  <br>There's 4 girls at the start of the anime.<br>3 in the manga.<br>Do the math.</br></br></br>  <br> Hurr <br>They'll just do the pre-Miki stuff as a flashback arc. Nothing she did in the first episode affects the story in any way.</br></br>  <br>Because most of the first episode is told from the perspective of the crazy chick who sees dead people dumbass, notice how that 4th girl only ever spoke to her, wasn't acknowledged by the other two, wasn't seen when it showed what was really going on and had her fucking gravestone on the roof?</br>  This chapter was horrible, they ruined Miki with the dog bullshit.  <br> wasn't acknowledged by the other two <br>Shovel acknowledged her<br>"Ooh-ra?", remember?<br><br>Also the dog was dead before they met Mii-kun</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to repopulate the earth with shovel.  If you want to blame someone, blame the manga's author  <br>It was a good episode. Yeah, it was different from the manga but it was still good.</br>  <br>Are you implying Miki's dead? Because if so, pic related.</br>  <br> 4girl  <br> death <br>anime fag pls go</br></br></br>  that shit was amusing<br><br>at first i thought these girls were a bunch of orphan hobos because they lived at school, but then the Shymalan Twist kicked in</br></br>  <br><br>Eh next episode is called memories so they are probably going to revisit pre-Mii life when Megune was still around. Albeit a bit rushed. The only part they really fucked up on though was the dog.</br></br>  Did anyone else notice this?  First episode got more than 720k views on niconico. That's even more than the first UBW episode.  <br> didn't even have a mention of the presence line </br>  Manga spoiler incoming. I just ate up all the current chapters (if there's no more than 36, at least) and I'm wondering:<br> Is the new girl Rii-chan's delusion? Considering Yuki isn't in the imouto spot anymore, she has really started losing it lately.<br>They go into the building, nothing but zombies, Yuki leaves a Teddy bear. Later at night, she goes in alone and comes out coincidentally with a young girl they somehow hadn't seen at first but also features some strange "bear ears". Also, notice the girls' reaction. The only thing that's making me doubt is Yuki seeing the girl immediately.</br> </br>  <br><br>It's not her grave though.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Megu is a good christian girl</br>  <br> She's most likely a delusion, yes.<br>It's way too convenient for her to find her like that, and only Yuki, who we know is bullshitting her own delusion for reasons, is interacting with the imouto<br>In chapter 37 and 38, the other two girls don't actually interact with her, either, and they seem to be discussing her, most likely because they're wondering how to go about things now that Rii's fucking psycho too</br></br> </br>  <br>If you please, can I get a link to the latest chapters. I don't care if it's raw.</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336<br>Here you go</br></br>  <br>He said raw not gook scans.</br>  <br> he thinks there are raws </br>  <br><br>What's the fucking difference?</br></br>  <br>I can read glorious Nippongese but not shitty ugly dogeater scribbles.</br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br> Imouto is also specifically omitted in the scene where the three girls are watching them climbing back over the wall, and there's part of the window blocking the exact sliver of the panel where she would be standing when she's playing with Rii and Yuka <br><br>I accidentally typed "Yura" who would be entertaining in a zombie apocalypse too.</br></br></br>  Best girl coming through.  <br> those comments <br> "is that Komoe-sensei" </br></br>  <br>I'll say it again but all girls are best girls.</br>  <br>Yes is it. It is Megu-nee's grave in the manga. Megu-nee is dead, not Miki.</br>  <br>Will it sell?</br>  <br>If they fix the shit that was episode 1 sure.<br>I hope sells well.</br></br>  <br>If they are going to end it with graduation, they will skip a buttload of content. First episode was a single manga chapter.<br><br>Thing is, if there is a second season soon because good sales, they can't really go back to adapt those bits if the graduation already happened.</br></br></br>  <br> end it with graduation <br>I think they'll end it on the episode of Yuki's breakdown, where it says the same things the first chapter said, like "Lately, I love school"<br>Do we know if this is just going to be 12 eps or if it's going to be more?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's a perfect ending. Crying on Mii-kun's bosom after the same monologue.<br><br>Most likely 12, they would never take chances with a series like this.</br></br></br>  <br> perfect ending <br>Eh. Perfect way to end the penultimate episode, yes, but the graduation would make for a much better ending.</br></br>  <br> Most likely 12, they would never take chances with a series like this. <br>and is fucking sad<br>the industry will do countless of moeshit but they don't give a fuck about this.</br></br></br>  Who the fuck thought the dog was a good idea?  <br>I think it already got people's interest in the manga so the adaptation did its job. Sales of the anime depend if the quality of the show stays consistent.</br>  <br>I fucking hate goofy dogs and bratty kids with the main cast in every show ever.</br>  <br> It was different from the manga therefore it's shit. <br>It was a really good episode. One of the best 1st episodes in a while even. I heard even the mangaka is working with them to fix the earlier chapters mistakes.</br></br>  <br>He didn't say it was shit, can you read? He just said they fucked it up, and I'd be inclined to agree. 20 minutes of boring shit so you can reveal the twist in the last two minutes isn't that great. With the manga I was interested enough to keep reading through chapter one, but when I watched the anime, even though I knew what was going to happen, I considered just stopping and waiting until next weeks, because holy fuck was it boring.</br>  There are like 4 threads up, which one is the main one?  <br>Abusive tsunderes that complete the cycle of tsun to dere within the first few episodes are worse.</br>  <br>But going straight away into the thick of it isn't great either. Having you care a bit more for everyone before hitting you with the twist was a great decision in my books. If anything that can be said negativily about the episode is the lack of animation. It showed that they can't animate anything with the kind of the heads popping to talk.</br>  <br>Main threads don't exist. Post in the thread or threads you want to.</br>  <br><br>By main thread, I mean thread where the majority of people who want to discuss the show are discussing it. Not "officially ordained thread"</br></br>  <br><br>There probably won't be a season 2, so they are jamming everything into 12 episodes just to sell the manga.</br></br>  <br> But going straight away into the thick of it isn't great either. <br>The manga didn't do that either, and I feel like the pacing of the manga was better.<br> Having you care a bit more <br>It did a terrible job of making the viewer care, in my opinion. The entirety of the episode was based around Taroumaru, so unless they plan to make him heroically die or something, I don't see the point, because he was already DOA in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a problem when OP doesn't use Gakkou Gurashi in his post. Most people use CTRL+F.</br>  <br>you forgot this one.</br>  <br>The pacing was so much better in the manga.<br>Also they are going to use the dog for shocking or something.<br>When the dog was only a little flashback.</br></br></br>  <br> is <br><br>Also, considering how much those faggots who post their reaction to the episode miss so much, I'm not surprised how a lot of people didn't start suspecting something was off before the reveal.</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of the manga. How the hell did the  pilot get infected? </br>  <br> Also they are going to use the dog for shocking or something. <br>I really hope they don't do that. The manga lacked shock value, rather, it keeps you on the edge all the time, which I believe is better.</br></br>  <br>May have been infected prior to flying if Randall Corp/the elevens' government is severely undermanned as a result of the infection. May have been bitten by someone who was on the chopper as well who turned. It's implied that he was infected, was trying to take the medicine before he turned, failed, lost control, and crashed.</br>  <br>He probably was infected for a while, but the government is lacking manpower and has the medicine.<br><br>He probably lost control when it was time for his next shot of the medicine.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If he was infected all along and he needed another shot, that means that the vaccine probably works only temporarily on people, who are infected. Which would mean that Kurumi will probably need another shot soon.</br></br>  <br><br>Did they take any syringes from Radio-chan's place? I can't recall.</br></br>  That fucking dog.  <br>The same thing happened to Radio-chan. Shovel already has one foot in the grave.</br>  <br>It was never mentioned what they took except for the car keys.<br> RIP Radio-chan. ;_; </br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br> The same thing happened to Radio-chan. <br>I guess that would also imply that she ran out of shots to stop the infection from spreading.<br> Shovel already has one foot in the grave. <br>I'll be hoping for a miracle.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Don't remember the episode but one girl told Shovel chan that his skin is cold  <br>get ready for more despair.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Radio-chan probably died because she ran out of medicine.<br>She was infected for a while and if I remember correctly she was coughing in the last broadcast the girls heard from the car.<br><br> Did they take any syringes from Radio-chan's place?  <br>There probably weren't any left, but even if there still were some - The girls probably don't know that the medicine is a temporary suppressant and that Kurumi is going to need another shot of the medicine soon.<br><br>The point when Kurumi realizes that she isn't healed and will need regular shots of the medicine to not turn into a zombie might be the time we'll see the first mental breakdown from Kurumi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you forgot the top right image in your post <br>What dude</br></br>  <br>What are the odds this gets something similar to haruhi broadcast order?</br>  <br> episode <br>dam , chapter<br>the point is<br> she's ded </br></br></br></br>  <br> episode <br>Anon, you silly goose, you.</br></br>  Friendly reminder that radio girl being dead is a red herring.  <br> his <br>Words can not express how OK I would be with this</br></br>  <br>   his skin is cold <br>Anon, these boy jokes are going too far.</br></br>  <br><br> Implying she won't become a zombie hybrid <br><br>She was shown testing her abilities, the zombies notice her less now.<br><br>Also, nice trips.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This guy draws thighs as good as fatalpulse. Is fatalpulse working as his assistant?</br></br>  Why wasn't the helicopter pilot a zombie when they got his map?  <br>Died in the crash, properly died<br>Probably crushed skull</br></br>  <br>The helicopter crashed and then fucking exploded.<br>The corpse was probably torn to shreds.<br><br>The map and pistol Kurumi brought were intact because they were in a metal case if I remember correctly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he was wearing a helmet</br>  <br>Yuki was the zombie all along.</br>  <br>They're all sex goddesses, especially craycray.</br>  <br>His fully intact body is shown over the case with the gun/map in it. I don't have the manga on my laptop so I can't post the page.</br>  <br>Wearing a helmet protects you if your helicoter explodes</br>  <br>Do you got the rest of these?</br>  <br>for you? no.</br>  <br> the zombies notice her less now. <br>I went back and looked at that page and fuck, I didn't notice that back when I was reading. Time to panic.</br></br>  <br>I didn't remember that. <br>In that case it might be possible that he didn't turn yet and died in the crash.<br>If corpses still turn he might have turned at a later time, after Kurumi took the case.</br></br></br>  <br>Her CQC tactical espionage skills are being developed, she just lowered her body temperature so infrared won't pick her.</br>  http://swiffarchive.com/swf/Yare%20<wbr>Yare%20Daze.swf</wbr>  <br>Her body is cold and the zombies don't attack her unless she shouts at them. That probably means that ethe zombies see her as one of them.<br>She's half-undead at this point.</br></br>  <br> fatalpulse could be working on GG doujins as we speak </br>  <br>There's one of each girl except Yuki, I think.</br>  the dog was a mistake  <br>see </br>  <br>Scratch that, Yuki's would probably be volume 1's special cover, which no one has scanned yet.</br>  <br>Damn it, I knew I was missing one aside from zombie-sensei.</br>  Do the inverted uniform colors actually mean anything or is it just some bored person?  <br>Use your head.</br>  <br>Yuki's their senpai, Ledouche.</br>  <br>He isn't Ippo.</br>  <br>I done have told you guys she's gonna end up like  Murphy in Z Nation </br>  <br>I can't wait to see Yuki abused<br>All of them, really, but especially Yuki<br><br>And I want to see Shovel loved tenderly, because I like her a lot, and not just for cute</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's half-undead at this point. <br>Well shit, my optimism's pretty low now, though I still hope for some ass pull that there will be a cure or something, that will turn her back to normal again.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? That was really THE focus point of the chapter. Walking by zombies unnoticed is really something. It's obvious Kurumi has only stopped the transformation process. She's going to need another shot soon. Do they actually have another syringe in the case?</br>  <br> but especially Yuki <br> Doesn't know the purpose of Yuki <br>Read the manga.<br>She's just pretending.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Why the fuck did he even crash in the first place? He pulled out a syringe then it crashed? I didn't understand that.</br></br></br>  <br>I know<br>But she's super cute and trying her best to be optimistic and smiling a lot<br>I want to see her break down completely, because she's cute</br></br></br>  I assumed Kurumi was taking doses of it regularly  <br>I asked the same, and this anon's response was pretty good</br>  <br> just pretending <br>Why do people keep saying this?<br>You really think she had been merely pretending to be delusional for everyone's sake?</br></br></br>  <br>Transformation got the better of him the moment he tried to take the shot. That's why he crumpled the map, crushed the syringe he wanted to inject himself with and went full zombie.</br>  <br><br>Didnt you notice how his retard zombie spasms had him crushing everything, including the syringe? He was fucked at that point.</br></br>  <br>Mikifags shitting up the threads</br>  <br><br>How did he even become infected though?</br></br>  <br>She's clearly pretending at this point<br>She wasn't at the start, but ever since they took shelter in the disaster room, she's been fairly lucid</br></br>  <br>At that point, she's no longer fully delusional. You can see that by how grown up she acts, which is the reason why Rii is going insane due to her memories of her real imouto.</br>  <br> That was really THE focus point of the chapter. <br>Yeah, I kinda understand it now. I guess I should re-read the manga, just in case I missed anything else.  My lack of sleep is really gets to me sometimes. <br><br><br>He crushed the syringe in his hand. The infection was getting to him, so he started to lose control over his actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My amazing deduction skills tell me that he probably got bit</br>  <br>Holy shit read the thread fucking thread, this was already asked and discussed.</br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>I did read the manga. She wasn't pretending before chapter 29. Afterwards, yes, but not before.</br>  <br>How did he get fucking bit while in a helicopter? If he got bit before getting in the helicopter, why didn't he use the syringe before FUCKING GETTING IN A VEHICLE WHILE INFECTED FOR FUCK'S SAKE.</br>  <br>That's not necessarily pretending<br>They could have sold that to her as some sort of ritual the club does for reasons<br>I don't know what those reasons would be, but that thing's been there for a long time, and it would be weird for them not to have sugarcoated the explanation of it to her</br></br></br>  <br>You are a special kind of stupid.</br>  <br>That's where the theory that the medicine becomes less effective over time. For all we know, their last helicopter pilot could have been on the juice for so long that he needed to shoot up every twenty minutes.</br>  <br><br>The syringe was loaded with sedatives, that might be why he crashed too.</br></br>  <br>So we're still left in the dark and we don't really know the circumstances that led him to crash. Okay, I can accept that. Doesn't explain why fuckers like  are acting so colon crucified if it's supposed to be an ambiguous situation in the first place though.</br>  <br>This is why we can't have nice threads on /a/. Read </br>  <br> Doesn't explain why fuckers like (You) are acting so colon crucified if it's supposed to be an ambiguous situation in the first place though. <br>Because everything you've asked has already be discussed in this short thread you blind nigger.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't help when you/ are so fucking dense that you have to have the same thing repeated to you several times over just so you can get it through your/their thick skull.</br>  <br><br>Wow, looks like the memers are getting angry for some reason. Are you guys having problems? Face it, it was poorly conveyed in the manga so you're probably going to get more questions about it as more and more people read the manga. If you can't handle that then maybe you should just fuck off back to reddit.</br></br>  Pilot-san wasn't spoonfed to you in the manga because you're supposed to figure out together with the girls how the serum and z virus works<br>Dang, people</br>  <br> wants to be spoonfed answers <br> can't be bothered to read the thread to find the answers <br> calls other people reddit <br>I rarely get mad, but god damn anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, you're one of those. Carry on then.</br>  <br> poorly conveyed <br>Sure, but if you had half a brain, you could make deductions by yourself, like a grown man. Instead you come and ask anons about circumstances that only the mangaka knows about. You really must be dumb. You should follow your own advice and go back to reddit yourself.</br></br>  <br> can't be bothered to read the thread to find the answers <br>I found the answers in this thread to unsatisfactorily answer the question, which is why I pressed you for more. On reddit, you'll never have to answer any questions since all the answers will be upvoted and you apparently hate discussion as well, which is why you belong there. <br><br>Given how this is apparently a point of contension, it was obviously a poorly conveyed scene.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was pink hair mentally ill, or pretending to be a retard a part of her master plan?</br>  <br>And why the hell do you think random anons over the fucking world would know secret details about the very same thing that you've read with no difference? Do you perhaps believe one of them is friend with the uncle of the cousin of the mangaka? USE. YOUR. BRAIN.</br>  <br><br> The answers I want are not pushed to the top for me. <br> You should go back to reddit <br><br>That's a pretty good one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not like this </br>  <br> korean </br>  REMOVE DOG  <br>Both probably. She has/had DID, but there were times when she definitely knew what was going on, but kept up the act to benefit her and the groups morale.</br>    <br>He probably got bitten checking out someplace like the elementary school or Radio-chan's shelter.<br>Then got back in the chopper without realizing the bite had punctured his suit, and only realized he needed the syringe when it was too late.</br></br>  <br>Worst "character" of the season.</br>  <br>In a few episodes</br>  <br>Which is why Yuki best girl. I'm going to believe there's a secret anime algorithm that automatically makes all pink-haired girls the best.</br>  Show would be better if the "mad" girl was actually the only somewhat sane one. Everything is actually normal and alright, there are just some psychotic girls who think there's been a zombie apocalypse.

They're not gonna listen to you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Footprints only last a few hours at best, anon.</br>  <br>She<br>is<br>literally<br>alive.<br>I'll bet my fucking DOTA 2 items.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>The fact that the door's damn hard to open indicates it hasn't been used at all for a long time.</br>    <br>She's dead and there's nothing you can do about it. Get over it.</br>  <br> I'll bet my fucking DOTA 2 items. <br>Can't tell if you are serious or want to make people with this opinion look bad.</br></br>  <br><br>Nope, not going to say it. You can just go get blue balls or click the link back there yourself.</br></br>  <br>Why would Radio-girl keep opening the door with a zombie inside?</br>  Shovel-chan is extremely cute. She's definitely my favorite, I hope nothing bad happens to her.  Though from my smattering of knowledge I know every girl gets mindbroken by stress at some point or something.   <br>I was expecting a lewder spread like the others, but a one-page nopan China dress is lewd enough to be acceptable.</br>    <br>I'd shovel my shovel in that shovel</br>  <br>Oh god, there's already figs of Kurumi, Miki, and Kii-san. Where's Yuki's?</br>   silly faces I want to protect   <br><br> You will never walk into the store and see this </br></br>  <br>I want it. I want them all. But I'm too embarrassed to display them in my room.</br>  The Walking Dead: The Anime  <br>I will, starting October. And I'm gonna think of you when I do it.</br>  <br><br>Make us proud, anon. If you don't purchase the whole fucking thing I'm gonna be real disappointed.</br></br>  <br>I want to protect cathatless-cathat.</br>  <br>Please god don't let GG have a well-arc</br>  <br><br>Well-arc? Did someone spend half of the series trapped in a well? <br><br>Sasuga American comics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch season 2 of that horrible abortion of a zombie show, I take it</br>  <br>The one and only you missed. It's a sign.</br>  <br><br>No, and I'd like to keep it that way.</br></br>  <br>I really liked this part. Yuki was amazing.</br>  <br>What's wrong with dota?</br>  <br>Her gomen was cutest thing I heard this season.</br>  <br>Trust me, you're making the right choice<br> They spent an episode, or maybe 2 I can't remember, dragging a fat, bloated zombie out of a well because "If we leave it there, we can't drink the water, it'll be infected and bad", which would somehow be solved by just removing the zombie.<br>Anyway, this all ends in them ripping the zombie in half over the well, with the lower half falling back into the well, and the top half being alive and well on the ground next to them, so they kill it.<br><br>The whole second season is trash<br>Actually, the entire show after the first season is trash<br>Season 1 is pretty good though</br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> the industry will do countless of moeshit but they don't give a fuck about this. <br> using moeshit unironically <br>This is a fucking manga time kirara manga</br></br></br>  <br>first episode was very good, the only thing that I would have changed was something in the beginning to show that the world was fucked up, instead of leaving it at the end as a surprise<br><br>I went in completely blind, and I still thought the reveal was unnecessary, even if it wasnt the intent, it felt like they really wanted it to be shocking, and I think if you're just going to reveal something like that in the first episode, you're better off just putting everyone on the same page right off the bat, even if it was just a quick shot of some fucked up shit, just leave it as something for the audience to keep in mind until the end when you can use it and the reveal together to cement your setting.<br><br> &gt;opinions </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey now, Shovel is too strong to get mind broken.<br>  She just gets turned into a zombie <br><br>I also still love how her reaction to seeing a guy kill himself is to call him a fucking coward and move on completely unphased.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Actually, the entire show after the first season is trash <br><br> The last season was solid </br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh god, who thought that was a good idea? I'm suddenly glad GG is only one cour, because if it isn't a good adaptation, at least we don't have to suffer for years like TWD comicfags</br></br>  <br>I was talking to someone who hasn't read the manga and they said.<br> this will be anime OF THE SEASON. For sure. I know it. The first episode BLEW MY MIND.  <br>I don't ever want to talk to them again.</br></br></br>  <br>shoveled definitely getting zomb'd, it's unavoidable<br><br>but not until her own mini-arc and some character development, to really hit it home when the time comes</br></br></br>  <br><br>That was one episode. Call it a farm arc if you must.</br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say definitely. There's a pretty high chance that there'll just be some asspull and she'll be fine.<br><br> Or at least I hope </br></br></br></br>  <br>Good point, I just wanted to specify the well part, and wasn't entirely sure how to<br>Episode would imply anime, and a chapter or a volume would both be too short to really be the same amount of content</br></br>  <br><br>If I have to deal with people expecting "epik twists" all season I'm going to shoot myself.</br></br>  <br>I hope so to, sure I'd be ashamed because ass pull and all but if she ends up find I would be very happy</br>  <br> I also still love how her reaction to seeing a guy kill himself is to call him a fucking coward and move on completely unphased. <br>That was before she realized the medicine didn't worked and started contemplating the same thing, if only for different reasons.<br><br> The guy killed himself because he was infected. </br></br></br></br>  Why won't you love me, Taroumaru?!  <br> she doesn't exist when they found him <br> this is why he doesn't like her. <br>DP</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, he wasn't alive at the beginning of the mango either.</br></br>  <br><br> Graduation <br> Miki sees the dog walking back to the school rather than her friend </br></br></br>  The last shot of the show is gonna be   Miki's note to Kei, right?    <br><br>It was also really cute.</br></br>  <br>In the end, it was really daijoubu.</br>  I'm gonna have to either read the manga or avoid these threads, aren't I?  <br>Or wait until it finishes airing.</br>  <br>She is pretty much done for.</br>  I'm pretty interested in how this series does its zombies. They seem to simply be people who are afflicted by a mind-controlling bacteria/virus which heavily rots the skin. People who die before the infection gets to them tend to simply die then and there. Plus the zombies die from various things which would kill a regular human, and probably not a zombie. Not to mention that Megu-nee was going through really deep levels of infection and wandering the school with a  albeit horribly deteriorated  focused mind while heading towards a specific location in order to get away from her beloved students. <br><br>They don't seem like they are actual walking dead, but rather just infected people who are wandering around until they can infect other people.</br></br>  <br>The faggot was implying Miki was dead you dumb shit.</br>  <br>It's just a flesh wound.</br>   Wanting a shot for shot remake of the manga, basically using the panels as the storyboard <br><br>Pants on head retarded. It'd be dull as fuck.</br></br>  <br>The manga art is a thousand times better.</br>  <br>How would it be dull? The manga is great.</br>  What's the most brutal ending you guys can think of? <br><br> Miki never left her compound, all her "friends" are just a hallucination as she spends her days swinging at shadows from her imagination and pretending she has friends who themselves are actually deluded <br><br> Shovel Knight goes full-zambie, bites Miki with Miki committing murder-suicide to protect her friends. Yuuri is still in a state of mental-shielding delusion, while Yuki has to protect her from now on <br><br> Shovel becomes a zombie and they are forced to kill her. Just as they finish her off and enter a government facility, they are told that there was always a miracle cure, they were just being watched for the sake of an experiment, which would conclude as soon as they found the facility <br><br> Everybody dies, holding hands with one another, crying but happy.   It's revealed at the end that the virus is cured by radio frequencies and sound amplifiers, explaining why zombies were drawn to speakers and megaphones moreso than human flesh.  <br> Final chapter is simply Radio-chan cracking a joke over the radio that she thought she was a zombie, but was seemingly mistaken. She continues to talk about how she would keep playing music for any survivors who were hurting, and would stay waiting for anybody who would come to her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, after watching it, it was alright, the scene where it shows the ruined classroom was pretty good, music was decent too. Miki being introduced in this episode felt natural, anime adaptations tend to do this a lot, skip ahead in the story then explain shit in flashbacks. I don't really care about the dog<br><br>Shovel is still the best girl.</br></br></br>   mfw I got my imouto to read the manga after the episode, and she's now furiously texting me because shovel got bit   <br>How do I unsubscribe?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the outbreak is confined to this one city and it's all just a experiment by the government/corporation. <br>Still have no idea what the pilot's purpose was though.<br><br>It'll end with  all the cast sacrificing themselves to get Yuki a little closer to their goal and the government will find Yuki imagining her friends like nothing happened </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>By fisting yourself</br></br>  <br> showing yuri shows to your little sister <br>Unless you're a grill yourself you're an ultra faggot.</br></br>  <br><br>Yuri shitposter, you don't seem like you really have anything special in your shitposts. Please go back to the threads from friday and saturday and try to learn.</br></br>  <br> brutal <br>They were all zombies all along and they get hacked to death by an ordinary Japanese schoolboy with a chainsaw.</br></br>  <br>Your sister has good taste in girls.</br>  Why is she so sexual?

How can one girl be so best?</br>  <br><br>I was pretty anti-yuki until that part</br></br>  <br> People who die before the infection gets to them tend to simply die then and there <br>Did they ever show someone die without infection?<br><br> zombies die from various things which would kill a regular human <br>I don't find that particularly surprising, unless I'm missing the point you're trying to make. It's not like their bodies suddenly become tougher because they are zombies.<br><br> Megu-nee  <br>While I really want to write off her resistance to the infection as an exception, I'll agree with you on that one.<br><br> just infected people who are wandering around until they can infect other people <br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone's going to be translating 36 and 37 from the gook scans soon in the other thread:<br/>  <br>They went full moe to make the reveal more dramatic, and imo it was for the best. How else are you going to fill the first episode if the twist can't happen until minute 18?</br>  <br>What chapter is that? I don't remember it at all.</br>  <br>Mall chapter, before they find Miki.<br><br>I wonder how much of the SoL scenes we'll get.<br>Will the entire sports festival make it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty boring, so I hope not.<br><br>I hope they just keep the contrast between the SoL and the survival and suffering, because that's what makes the series interesitng, if they just show a lot of SoL it'll end up being boring.</br></br></br>  <br> yuri <br>Fuck off to </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009963 <br>anon take this series in your mind as a deconstruction of the SoL genre and you can enjoy this.</br>  <br>I am not mentally prepared for what's going to happen to the shovel girl</br>  <br>This whole scene really made me think. To what extent does Yuki know whats going on? Shes clearly aware of the immediate danger while simultaneously holding onto her delusions.<br><br>How long do you guys suppose until shes face to face with a zombie and has to actually deal with it?</br></br></br>  <br>No shit sherlock!</br>  <br><br>I think she's pretty lucid by now. She was forgetting to ask Megu-nee's permission for things.</br></br>  <br>I wonder how long until we see the outside world from her eyes.</br>  <br>Literally the chapter after that happened<br><br>She's been coming back to reality since Kurumi was bit, and after the fire she's pretty much sane. The latest chapters even imply that she doesn't see Megu-nee anymore, while Yuri is starting too.</br></br></br>  <br> Only School-Live and Highschool of the dead have done Romero style zombies right </br>  Chapter 36 in the other thread, if anyone is still here.  <br>I dont think that really counts since it was a crawler. She could've walked away as easily ash she bashed it's head in with a mop. I'm talking more like shes alone with 1 other person whos passed out and suddenly zombies come out of no where or something like that.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>link</br>  <br><br>Literally look above you</br></br>  <br> you will never mate with Yuki </br>  <br>These are not romero style zombies. You have to be alive and bit to be infected and turn.</br>  <br>We actually don't know that for sure since we haven't see a dead person who isn't a zombie.</br>  <br>The guy who hanged himself.</br>  <br><br>Also, Romero zombies have to die before they can turn, but, as we've seen with the existence of the medicine and being able to change back, GG zombies have to be alive.</br></br>  <br>Of course it counts. You gotta trust the author's storytelling capacity a bit here, but the way that whole sequence was done was clearly meant to be a major point in her character arc. Couple the situation itself with Yuki's reaction, including the repeat of the initial monologue that introduced us to the delusions in the first place and her running through the school while seeing its actual state and then breaking down. If this manga wants to have good writing that part -has- to be the point where she changes, perhaps not 100% but majorly. At the very least I'm pretty sure she can act normal now, she just keeps the delusion facade up because reasons and also that's her personality anyway.</br>  If Shovel dies I'll go and get a job.  <br>You realize that your neck snaps when you hang yourself right?</br>  <br>Yeah, but the brain is intact.</br>  <br>But it's not attached to the rest of body. It's the same as decapitation.</br>  <br>Can you point out where does Yuuri start to see Megu-nee? So far I have been seeing the girls asking Yuki to 'confirm' with Megu-nee as part of their usual practice.</br>  <br>Rii saw megu's silhouette in the smoke</br>  <br>I thought the one who saw Megu-nee was Yuki? If I remember right, Yuki was the one who pointed the right direction and 'thanked' Megu-nee later.</br>  What do you see in her eye?  <br><br>Death</br></br>  <br>In chapter 32 I think, Yuuri talks about Megu-nee as if she's still alive. And again later she asks if it's okay to take the RV without asking Megu-nee about abandoning her car.</br>  <br>salvation</br>    <br>She never sees Megu-nee. Yuuris just using the fact that Yuki acts as if she can see Megu to get Yuki out of the room.</br>  I can't wait until we hear Yuki say, "Megu-nee is dead!" directly from her mouth. Probably to Yuuri.  Time for dank meme.<br><br>"Megu-nee is dead. She's not here anymore! But on my back, and in my heart, she lives on in me! "<br><br>"Digging a hole to piece the zombies! Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I'm Kurumi ! I'm not my teacher Megu-nee! I am myself! Kurumi the digger!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>What I don't get is, at least in the manga, sometimes she has really long hair and other times it's just shoulder-length. Why is that?</br>  <br/>  Reminder<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805</wbr></br></br>  <br><br><br>Continuing from the other thread.</br></br></br>  When does chapter 38 come out?  <br>Two weeks, 24th to be precise.</br>    <br>Just looked back and found this.</br>    <br>I want to punch that face.</br>  <br>I want to irrumate that face.</br>  <br>Yuki and Yuuri have similar symptoms but opposite causes.<br>Yuki was in a familiar and relatively safe place, so when she broke she could go 'safe-mode'. In her heart she knows what's happening but her mind could just block everything out and feed her happy thoughts. Now that things are happening and they're moving, new things are forcing her to come out of her comfort zone and make her shell really thin. She's relying less on delusions and has stopped making as many excuses. Moving forward will eventually break her shell, and there's going to need to be a lot of support for her when it happens.<br><br>Yuuri was handling it when it was stable, but everything's just piling up now they're moving, uncertainty, fear, responsibility, etc. Her mind can't handle it and her heart is searching for comfort. She'll stabilise after she gets back to a calm environment, cry her eyes out for a while and pull her shit together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, time to polish the previous pages that were done. I'll upload the rest to MEGA or some shit and maybe try to get rid of the watermark on the left of these but no promises on that.</br>  <br>I wouldn't bother with the watermark, this version's going to be replaced next month when Deel comes out with his version anyway.</br>  <br>Alright then, nice to know. I didn't see that update.</br>  <br>Ah I see, it was Yuki who was pointing to the correct path and Yuuri who saw Megu-nee.</br>  <br>The intention is what counts, thanks for you work. Although now that you have the intention, can you do the same, but with chapter 36? Typesetting done in paint is not that pleasant to read.</br>   just caught up with the manga <br> got to read newly translated chapters with /a/  <br>This has been fun. Mii-kun is best girl by the way.</br></br>  <br>Sure, I have time to waste. I might not dump it like this though, it'll probably be apart of the MEGA upload link.</br>  <br>She's competent all round. Has shovel's prowess and Rii's levelheadedness.<br>Truly best grill</br></br>  <br>How do you figure that? All they have to do is stop at where   they leave the school  They can just pick later when there's more chapters.</br>  <br>Good enough. Thanks in advance, much appreciated.</br>  <br>She'll go down the insanity-hole once something happens, just like Rii.</br>  <br>That's when she has to bash shovel's head with her shovel.</br>  <br><br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/11/japanese-fan-discover<wbr>s-interesting-fact-about-school-liv<wbr>e-uniforms</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> back to normal again. <br>Please don't get my hopes up.</br></br>  <br> She's naturally resistant and will encounter no symptoms other than cold body temperature <br> Randall Corporation has invented a more advanced cure in the past couple of weeks <br><br>What other possibilities, no matter how small, are there?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mii-kun is best boy <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br> Mii-kun is actually a trap <br> He throws away his crossdressing hobby in order to keep the group of girls sane with his manly aura  <br> they all become part of his harem </br></br></br>  <br> builds a resistance to the infection <br> they can make a vaccine from her and cure people who have already turned into zombies <br>But then they realize they can't save the people that they killed like their teacher and shovel-chan feels immense guilt for killing so many people.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying   this series won't end with Yuki being the only sane one of the group, as the rest lose their minds to various stimulus <br>   Yuuri has already gone off the deep end, and is carrying around a teddy bear she calls her sister <br>   Miki is a trap who is under the distinct impression he's a girl, and as such forgets who he truly is beyond "one of the girls of the Life Club" <br>   Kurumi has been cured, but her deep fears and paranoia lead to her body being clammy and cold, and she will mentally regress to the point where she will become a zombie psychologically rather than biologically, and the infection won't even matter </br></br></br></br>  <br>They were living in agony, near-mindless, but still barely there.

As far as we know those guys wanted to warn them about the university sluts.</br>  <br>Yeah, warning them with spiked bat in hand.</br>  <br>The problem is we don't know the context for the chase. Miki and Kuru just sprint right back with them on their tail, so while they may've just been pursued, there may've been an exchange of words for all we know.</br>  <br>Can be misunderstanding or they thought they were with uni sluts and wanted to chase them away.</br>  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51374131<br> Hot <br><br><br>Do you want them to go outside their camp without protection?</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>W-what is that pink thing below her tail</br>  <br>Well, it's a possibility I guess. <br><br>a) Those uni girls are super pure nice individuals that got expelled by crossbow guy's group <br>b) The bike people are trying to warn the gakkou that the uni girls are evil (Why chase them around with bat anyway? What happen between them and Kurumi and Miki?)<br>c) The bike gang and uni sluts are in cahoot (they immediately leave when the gate is closed, really guys, you can't handle bunch of uni sluts?)<br><br>So see, option c is the most probably choice. I think crossboy gonna save the gakkou in the future. <br><br><br>What else but rape?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those uni sluts can be more dangerous than it seems.</br>  <br>Option d) Both groups are evil, but aren't working with each other.</br>  <br>e) Both groups are good samaritans but misunderstanding each other</br>  <br>Her second tail</br>  <br>It's the deconstruction of Madoka's Evangelion.</br>  <br>Generic porn dialogue.</br>  <br>I know merely a little bit of moon. Obviously, Yuki is being proposed to have sex in the school, she bats around the bush saying she loves school and it would be embarassing to do it here. And that her breasts are small but the guy answers it's alright. There's a kanji I don't know in the third bubble but she's refering to the other members of the club so I cannot understand it.</br>  <br><br>thanks</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128017508 <br>No. Find your own gore porn.</br>  <br>ほ、ほら・・・<br>部活のみんなも<br>探してるみたいだし・・・<br>またこんど・・・ね？</br></br></br></br>  Is it bad to still believe in good ending?  <br>No. Believe whatever you want.<br>The rest of the world is fine... maybe.</br></br>  <br> 探してる <br>Good thing computer translation exists. Yeah, she's saying that it looks like the club members are searching for her.</br></br>  I had never heard of this series before deciding to watch the anime, during the whole first episode it felt uneasy AS FUCK, and at the end I found out why, it was great.<br><br>But seriously, I never had such an uneasy feeling like this, I did notice some things throughout the episode that suggested something was very wrong, like the desks barricade, there was a grave near on the rooftop, at some point in the middle of the episode, it looked like the windows were broken as well.<br><br>Very good first episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan is an island country so maybe it was contained there. America will come and save them for sure.</br>  <br>reddit or youtube?</br>  <br>As the manga progresses, the girls are going to lose their humanity little by little, I think. It has started with Kurumi becoming a little more zombie, now Rii is becoming crazed (in a much more unstable manner than Yuki) and Miki might end up paying too. Yuki is going to remain the pillar of the group and the others will become more and more dependable on her as time passes, revealing her inner turmoil and forcing herself to fully accept reality.<br><br> Climax is going to have Yuki injured in a car accident and stuck. The girls will have no choice but to leave her in order to find shelter.

The worlds and people that you will never experience and meet; the stories you will never share, that will never be your own.

No. But sometimes it distracts me from feeling sad.  <br>I watch anime because some of it is beautiful.<br>I'm not happy with my life, in fact, I am not happy with existence itself.<br>I do not use beauty as a way to escape this, rather, beauty reminds me that this life is not all there is.</br></br></br>  <br> I haven't watch any anime in years <br>Why the fuck are you here?</br></br>  <br>The elitism is unparalleled.</br>   troll OP <br>Anime is like any other side dish in life.

It's not much improvement cuz I'm still depressed and sociophobic, but it's something. When I get home, I have something to look forward to, not just wallow in my deep shit. I met some cool niggas thru it, and that includes you faggots.<br><br> I love you, motherfuckers!<br> blushes </br></br></br></br>  <br>welp, better fit a oculus into my budget.</br>  <br>Based Harada is making anime real.

That and video games or a bit of hiking across forests and mountains. Things might not be perfect but I'd be lying to myself if I said that I wasn't happy with my life.  Happy with a part of it. That's fair enough.  <br>If you like all of that, you should go on deployment!<br>it's real swell!</br></br>  Not like it used to. I drop most shows midway through and never pick them up again. At least this season will be different. Maybe.<br><br>Lifting is the only time I'm really happy anymore.</br></br>  <br> Wait a sec, Recruiter-kun, are you trying to cheat me again?  </br>  Only KyoAni shows cheer me up anymore. <br><br> Where did everything go so wrong?  </br></br>   spend almost $600 on combined vet bills <br> found out cats now have roundworm which will probably cost more <br> I might get it <br> worms are literally my biggest fear <br> can't get a fucking job around the area, even in manual labor <br> Mom dying of cancer <br> brother is a tranny SJW now  <br> sister threw her education away before highschool to do drugs and now is a whore <br> best friend has Huntington's  <br> rapidly looking like I won't be able to support myself <br> can't even join the military because I lost a nut in a construction accident <br> dog is getting old and dying <br> can't kill myself because my grandparents rely on me almost entirely now <br> at least I have video games <br> nope, some fresh-into-college liberal arts major says those are sexist and for some reason the industry is listening to a hyper-minority rather than money and dying <br> at least I have anime now <br> TPP is going to get passed and they're going to crack down on torrenting anime and doujins will be fucking gone  <br> well at least I can enjoy this shitty moe show full of cute girls  <br> all anime being made now is shitty adaptions from shittier light novels  <br><br>Well at least One Punch Man might be<br> madhouse </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes because its the only thing that reminds me of my brother and father and the good memories watching. <br><br>Everyone has their own slice of happiness anon.</br></br></br>  Sometimes, it feels like some anime and manga are crystalizations of the author's otherwise unexpressable feelings.<br><br>In that light, all the waifus of the world are the lost bits of love, joy and kindness that couldn't exist in reality.</br></br>  naruto is the only good anime<br>sasuke is a bad ass</br>  <br>Somehow it makes me occupied<br><br>It distracts me from most of the stress since im too busy thinking whats gonna happen to a series im looking forward to or thinking what new series im watching.</br></br></br>  I would be happy if current anime wasn't pandering to the otaku.  <br>This.</br>  <br>Miyazaki pls</br>  <br>Hello jaded veteran anime watcher</br>  <br><br>At the end of every single story I feel like shit, like I want to kill myself, no purpose in life<br>Because its like being awoken from a very happy dream<br><br>I should quit anime while I still can, its dangerous shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably what happens when you "race mix?" 2D and 3D.</br>  <br>Better keep on eye on you anon, you sound like you may become a super villain.</br>  <br>This.<br>Getting faded and watching your favorite shows is the shit.</br></br>  <br>No you are sharing an experience with the creators, even if you don't know who they are, you're enjoying a work they created which reflects to some extent reality. The escaping reality problem arises when a person gets caught up in works where reality is warped and enables them to escape from their problems. This is the basis of addiction and is an unhealthy coping mechanism that plagues the anime community. They're called otakus and its really sad.</br>  <br>It's a chore and I hate it.</br>  <br>Reality is absolute garbage and 3D is PD on a purely aesthetic level, though. Can you understand where I'm from here?</br>  <br>Not really, all it does is give me something to look forward to every now and then. The feeling that if I get bored, I have anime to fall back on with a decent sized backlog and several shows a season. Same with manga - one piece for instance is something I look forward to each week.</br>  <br> asmr esque nature of some voice acting <br>Explain further</br></br>  <br>Getting faded?  Smoking and watching anime is amazing, also reading manga while listening to music </br>  <br>I just really find some voices calming, George Nakata and Mamiko Noto etc.</br>  <br>Sometimes a cute animu girl says something and their soft, innocent voice sends a shiver down your spine and into your dick.</br>  <br>I mean faded as in getting drunk but I agree with everything you said.</br>  No.<br>It makes it tolerable.</br>  <br> reading manga while listening to music <br>How can you even focus and understand what you're reading while listening to music</br></br>  <br> By not being a casual. <br>For real though I actually prefer it, I feel like it engages your brain more so you don't get bored of reading. You can also think of it as reading at the tempo of the song that's playing. I dunno.</br></br>    <br>I'm sorry anon, but you might be literally retarded.</br>   This whole thread   <br>Watching anime is like entering a happy dream world<br> you immersed yourself but yet when that dream world ends all you get is one harsh reality and the depression on how your life will never be like that<br><br>i think for awhile Barakamon hit me hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> bored of reading <br>Maybe you should read more interesting things. Alternatively, read the boring shit faster.</br></br>  <br>Yes, but the most terrible thing is the post anime depression</br>  <br>By having more brain cells than you.</br>  <br><br>Stop bullying me</br></br>  <br>I already read fast as a motherfucker.<br>I'm not saying I do it all the time but I do enjoy it, and it does help when you have to study  biochem. <br>I guess it enhances my reading experience?</br></br></br>  <br>Now watching it just reminds me the joy a my youth is gone. All anime is about young people and their opportunities and here I am feel old and like I have wasted the best, most important years of my life.</br>  Yes, but every time I finish a series I feel like killing myself.  <br>The cute, squeaky, innocent voices in anime. Normalfags often hate them, but it's all music to my ears.</br>  <br>It's actually quite enjoyable, for certain series a certain album makes a pretty good soundtrack. Even a specific song for when a new chapter out is good. <br>I listened to Part 1-3 of JoJo while listening to Madvillainy and  listen to Channel Orange when reading Nisekoi, usually "Thinking bout you" for the new chapter each week.  For an individual song on repeat for new chapters usually listen to Wet Dreamz by J. Cole for Domestic no Kanajo.<br>I highly suggest music to go along with your manga experience  That was a good play on words right? </br></br></br>  <br><br>Wow, that is the most retarded thing i've read in the last month. Kill yourself faggot</br></br>  <br>I only listened Berserk OST (especially Hai Yai Forces) while reading Berserk and you're i had a better manga experience compare to every other manga i've read</br>  <br>Why wouldn't it?<br>Its a hobby that can be enjoyed with friends, watching GuP and Love lab with friends is fun. Same as watching running series on weekends,playing divegrass or vidya after a week of being busy.<br>The more the merrier.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah listening to the OST for the series is good too, I especially liked Legend of the Martial Artist when reading HxH, even though it was kinda spammed during the show at times. It allows you to be the director for your own experience.</br>  <br>More like it makes the sting of real life harsher.</br>  Not really. It's mostly a distraction.  Yea, it made my life great. Before my life was all about was grades and making money in high school. That being said, i didnt really get to appreciate high school. Or even college. I did hang out a lot, but i felt like i did it just to keep my network big. A year ago I was stressed from work and tried some anime series and omg. I fell in love with it. It destresses me and helps me appreciate life more. I watched and read a lot of slice of life anime/manga such as nisekoi, non non biyori, koe no katachi, nichijou, daily lives of hs boys.. list goes on. Made me realize what i missed out on. I recently went to my friend's party at a park in san francisco and i was only able to appreciate it because anime made me realize how much fun i can be having irl also. The golden gate bridge was more beautiful that the thousand times ive seen it before. Anime made me appreciate life more ^____^. <br><br>Also, other anime such as shokugeki, one piece, naruto, kuroko.... The competitive ones where they try to be number 1, try to be the best makes me want to work harder in my life goals! so much better than western cartoons where "trying your best" is enough. and we should just have fun... winning is fun. and working on what you love is fun! (IMO)</br></br>  <br><br><br>Faded = Drunk &amp; High<br><br> Learn your terminology, anon. </br></br></br></br></br>  Yeah, especially now that all American entertainment is just thinly veiled RACIAL TENSION.  <br><br>Side note: I guess its use is a bit geographical, but originally I think it meant a mix between drunk and high, makes more sense in my mind at least.</br></br>  <br>In NY at least that's considered cross-faded</br>  <br><br>I can only speak for Sweden and parts of the UK. I've heard cross-faded before, but as far as I can tell faded is simply a shorthand for cross-faded. Doesn't matter in the end, viewing anime whilst heavily intoxicated is a premise we all can adhere to.</br></br>  Yes, it makes me happy as I can escape from my shitty life  <br>If the dubs doth proclaim, then it shall be so.<br><br>Around my neck of the woods faded means drunk and twisted means drunk and high.</br></br></br>  <br>shit post</br>  <br>Indeed it is. <br>Question for everyone, what's the most entertaining series while you're intoxicated on your substance of choice? Space Dandy was fun and Shokugeki no Soma has been really cool to watch due to the munchies</br></br>  <br>no but it makes it bearable<br><br>gives me something to look forward too</br></br></br>  It used to, now it's just sadness and disappointment every season.  <br><br>I stopped smoking weed some time ago but here's what I think.<br><br>Stoned =  Sora No Otoshimono, Steins;Gate and Rosario to Vampire <br><br>Drunk =  Seitokai Yakuindomo and Cromartie High School </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what's the most entertaining series while you're intoxicated on your substance of choice? <br>Hard question.<br>I feel like the ones I liked watching sober would be twice as good. <br>For me it'd be a toss up between D-frag, Upotte, Chaika, and Plastic Memories.</br></br></br></br>  <br>   R+V <br>I remember drinking before that every once in a while, made all the shenanigans a lot funnier<br><br>I think watching Plastic Memories would be a buzzkill drunk, would just get sad</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course not. I get even more depressed while I watch anime.</br>  <br>I thought that was crossfaded</br>  It makes me feel sad, empty and like I'll never find my lot in life.  <br>Absolutely. I love the medium for storytelling.</br>  <br>It is. This faggot has no idea what he's talking about</br>  <br>This really. I don't get so depressed but I feel like I don't want to be here anymore.</br>  <br>He might've meant the word can represent being drunk and also represent being high, not both at the same time</br>  <br><br><br><br>We weeded it out (haha PUNS-GALORE xD) later on in the thread. It's geographical, it means different things in different places.</br></br></br></br>  <br> would just get sad. <br>Oh trust me, the tears were flowing. <br>But it made me feel. Happy, sad, angry, optimistic, desperate, hopeful, fearful, joyful, sorrow, amongst others.<br>The balance between light and dark was good in this show.<br>The romantic side of the show really warmed the cockles of my heart though, and made the ending that much more powerful.<br>I haven't shown that much emotion towards something in years.<br>The suffering is real but it's the reason why I'll remember the show years from now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's too 3DPD for me.</br>  <br>every day i'm getting closer to taking that last plunge<br>pulling that trigger<br><br>i'll be there soon iwata</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn, I guess your ship has sailed a long time ago.</br></br>  <br>No skin problems, perfect proportions and just the right amount of chinese cartoon in the face, she passes my test at least</br>  <br> Because its like being awoken from a very happy dream <br>Go back to sleep and watch more anime. Enjoy the ride.<br><br> feel like I don't want to be here anymore. <br>Hang on, anon. Maybe someday you can go to the 2D world. Believe in miracle. <br> HAHAHAHAHA. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> xD <br>Get fucked.</br></br>  <br> suddenly hot guy appears <br>She's already got a boyfriend. Am I going to get NTR'd in games too?</br></br>  <br>upcoming anime is the only reason why I haven't killed myself<br><br>there's always something fun or interesting just around the corner, unlike the complete failure that is my life</br></br></br>  <br>Why shitpost-kun?</br>  <br> shitpost <br>What? Something's wrong with my post?</br></br>  <br>It makes me forget.</br>  <br><br>  Get fucked <br><br>Maybe next time I'll add a note at the bottom pointing out that it was in sarcasm.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same.<br>Maybe if it was the cutie from the first demo, but this slut looks and dresses like some blonde generic whore.</br></br>  I lift<br><br>I watch anime<br><br>I play vidya<br><br>These things makes me happy. Whether it's escapism or not, I don't care. Everyone is living in their own bubbles anyways. Being around people makes me feel more lonely than being alone. I prefer life this way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Every time the season changes, I have to flip the page to the next batch of shows, and somehow, that makes me feel incredibly melancholy. 'Goody bye, Fall season. I guess we'll never meet again.' That's how it makes me feel. And then I *flip*, and think, 'Wow, Winter's not bad either!", and that makes me think of how I'm already betraying the Fall... So, what I'm trying to say here is, that a year goes by really quickly."  <br>Maybe you'll be able to customize her? They won't give us waifus without the option to (un)dress them and make slight changes to their appearance.</br>  <br>Contrary to what other anons might have told you, your waifu is not waiting for you on the other side.<br>She is already in this realm. You and her both exist at the same time. You found her and she found you in this lifetime. So why would you take your own life, rather, why would you take away from her that which she loves, her "anon".<br>Not to get all existential but there is literally no excuse to kill yourself because nothing you'll do will matter anyways.<br>So try to be happy. Try to live the life your waifu would want you to live, after all, you do it for her.<br> tl;dr hang in there anon. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tl;dr hang in there anon. <br><br>In the noose or just figuratively?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Top kek I meant it in a Ganbare sort of thing.<br>I feel like an idiot now.</br></br>    I don't understand the negativity. I just want to live forever and consume japanese media for eternity.  <br><br>I need to know more characters that fits this description</br></br>  <br>This is 2.5D <br><br>Because she exist in the 2D world that produces 3D. Thus, 2.5D, which still, should be in the boundaries and not crossing the line of 3DPD.<br><br>Pray for haste on our devbros</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Somewhat and very temporarily, but anime also gave me my waifu and that has pretty much broken me these past few months</br>  <br> gave me my waifu and that has pretty much broken me <br>Wait what? Isn't that a contradiction?</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's  his wallet  that's got raped.</br>  <br>It was nice at first and I still and will always love her with all my being but knowing she will never be real has started to take its toll, it feels like that's all I think about anymore</br>  <br>I wanna die.</br>  <br><br>Why should I ever leave the house again after getting this?</br></br>  Well since this is a blog thread here is your reply:<br><br>I was fucked a 3dpd the other day near blackout drunk and when I closed my eyes all I could imagine was my waifu bouncing on top of me.<br><br>It was a pretty great feeling, you should try it some time op.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never give up anon ! <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tYz<wbr>MYcUty6s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Its kinda a hobby of mine so yes<br>I dont know why but even i socialize with people i feel more lonely but yet while i watch anime i feel happy and home.</br></br>  If you want to die, you don't belong here. Because you can't watch Anime when you're dead.  <br> scamco <br>Fuck, I want this with  im@s  mod.</br></br>  <br>Yes. it keeps me happy and makes me forgot.<br><br>I really wish i didnt join the army. It wasnt worth it.</br></br></br>  <br> 3DPD <br>Ewww. Nope nope nope. If I want 3DPD my hand is more than enough.</br></br>  <br>Is your life like Gate?</br>  <br>No its hell</br>  <br><br><br>God fucking damn it, I thought that I could let go of that fucking show after I finished it. Now all I can do is wait for the dubs.</br></br></br>  <br>To get food? Unless they make "Eat with your waifu" delivery service that will make exactly the same food your waifu has just cooked for you.</br>  <br>You can't really share an experience with the creators unless you communicate with them directly your thoughts on their art.<br><br>Creating something and putting it out for the world to see without really knowing what the audience's relative experience is isn't a shared experience IMO.<br><br>You're actually sharing an experience with fellow audience members through discussion on this board.</br></br></br></br></br>  No.<br>I have Touhou for that.</br>  <br>I used to honestly enjoy anime but now I'm worried that I just watch it for escapism.<br><br>Knowing that I watch for escapism makes me enjoy it less but crave it more because sometimes I actually can get immersed. But, once I snap back into reality all my anxiety kicks back in.</br></br></br>  <br>All style and no substance<br>And that might have been okay if the style was actually good</br></br>  <br>Well yeah I'd have to say that I do. Watching anime and listening to music are what keep me going in life. I can actually get more pleasure from it by drinking alcohol.

Renka is literally Yuu with more Edgy looks. both of them is a shit if you ask me.<br><br> Why would they like him? <br>Apparently, in Nip Bandai Namco release many <br>manga and LN about these two and add romance theme in it and make it canon. <br><br>So, it's Shipper and Otaku's rant, I guess?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which Fairy would you Tail?<br><br>Anime stuff:<br>Kyouka bondage,Mira and Erza in Demon coats,DF Wendy in 2-3 weeks<br><br>Manga stuff:<br> The emperor of the Mavisfag army is the greatest Mavisfag of all,Zeref. <br><br>Twitter stuff:<br>Tennis Erza.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to stick it inside Lucy's ass and ejaculate prematurely as she makes fun of me  Cana all day every day.  <br>MJ about to get molested by a hermit crab.</br>  <br><br>She's blushing, so obviously she's waiting for it.</br></br>  <br>all that all</br>  <br>Erza all day and every day. <br><br>And Anon-kun you should've just waited till the chapter drops, as FT threads barely have any staying power on their own.</br></br></br>  Erza is best girl    What would you do in this situation?  <br>Genuflect<br><br>Has there been a popularity poll for this manga in a while?</br></br></br>  Who is this cum drum?  <br>Can somebody find picture on left in full res?</br>  There's this from vol 44 last year.

Haven't seen a proper scan, unfortunately.</br>    series that needs doujins  <br>Dozo</br>  <br>Too bad it's overcropped, now that I look at it.</br>  <br>Is there a place for all of them?</br>  <br>No, wrong I was thinking that next of this one.</br>  <br>Someone on Minitokyo scans them. I think their uploads aren't visible unless you make an account. Also, Planeptune has posted scans of volume covers/extras on  Narutoforums  in the past. Not sure if s/he's done the last few volumes though.<br><br>Ooh, this is new. Now that I think about it, Mangastream hasn't been scanning the FT mag guest art in a while, so we might've missed several of these.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I meant that one where it looks that Erza and Lucy are making symmetrical docking with other girls around.</br></br>  <br>This?<br><br>There's also an alternate scan that's over the filesize limit.</br></br></br>  <br>You are god. Just too bad that they actually don't make symmetrical docking.<br>Is there some official picture where Erza and Lucy really make symmetrical docking?</br></br>  <br>Not that I recall, unfortunately. Lucy and Yukino do it a few times in the anime though. There's even a three-way with Hisui.</br>  fucking mashima man.      <br>Damn, we need Erza x Lucy docking.</br>  <br> There's even a three-way with Hisui. <br>Post that.</br></br>    <br><br><br>Those titties are dead.

Fuck that. Mashima you have one big job.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Perfectly symmetrical docking  <br>I don't remember this<br>Chapter?</br></br>  Anyone got Lisanna's huge ass?  <br><br>Edolas arc, it's the scene where knightwalker erza and normal erza go at it full tilt. She even ran out of magic power at the end of it.</br></br>  <br>Look at that fucking ass, dude.</br>  <br>I have a mediafir account. Is there a link?</br>  look at Erza's she's hyper-focused on building that sandcastle. she's in the fucking zone<br><br>meanwhile lucy is like, 'you like what you see?" and doesn't even care how dangerous close her knees are to damaging the structure</br></br>  <br>https://www.sendspace.com/file/c0as<wbr>ym<br><br>(Missing  since it came out later)</br></br></wbr></br>    <br>Is there any solo scan of Lucy with the red bikini?</br>  <br>Not of the version previewed in , I don't think.</br>  <br>There's a figure though.</br>  <br>A giant figure.</br>    <br>With a giant ass.</br>  <br>I wished there was official fan art with Kyoka and Sayla instead of her with Minerva.</br>      <br>Oh neat, somebody else did a bigger stitch.</br>  So,anyone have a link to the old GMG scribbles?The ones with Zeref and Lucy.Seems like they'll be relevant soon.  <br>Does bikini come off?</br>  <br>Have you not been reading the thread? People read FT for its intricate PLOT</br>  <br>I think there was a translated version of this somewhere.<br><br><br>Does it look like you could pry those panties out of that ass crack?</br></br></br></br>  Waiting for that shadow guy to come back from the first arc. I think he's the gin of fairy tail.  <br>Found it.<br><br>Lucy will kneel down in front of Zeref.<br>The picture says, "Follow the king's order, Lucy"<br>"A song to yearn, I will never meet Natsu again"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>   The emperor of the Mavisfag army is the greatest Mavisfag of all,Zeref. <br>I thought it was  Makarov ?</br></br>  <br>Iffy translations.One says  Makarov ,other says  Zeref. <br><br>Nipponese is hard.</br></br></br>  <br> implying they aren't the same person </br>  <br><br><br>It actually looks like the leg rotates, there's a gap. It may be screw-attached.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying he'd leave that behind if that was true </br>  <br>There's also one of Mirajane and Lisanna</br>  Lisanna best gril.<br>Wendy best daughteru.<br>Lucy best cum slut just like her VA.</br></br>  <br>Wendy best housewaifu too.</br>  <br>He can just teleport. Or xerox it. Magic baby.</br>  <br>Goddamn. I'd fuck those two all night</br>  <br>Don't be greedy. I'll take Cheria and you take Wendy. We'll share midway.</br>  Huh, I just found out that someone did do a stitch of the DVD version of Wendy's ending.  <br>Is there a DVD version of Lucy?</br>  <br>Pretty compressed, but I'll take it!<br><br><br>Obligatory Erza request</br></br></br></br>  <br>How do i get to fuck her?</br>  <br><br>There are DVD versions for Lucy and Erza. Unfortunately no one seems to have done a stitch for them. We're stuck with previews like this. The Japanese DVD_ISO that would have the relevant episodes isn't anywhere to be found with a casual search, and the official English DVDs that might have it aren't out yet.</br></br>    Has there been anymore Flare?  <br>See </br>  Does anyone have a HQ raw from the pic In the op?        Flare is lovely. I kinda wish that she'd remained completely off her rocker, but I'd still be happy to see her back.  <br>She does seem pretty cute with her non-crazy mode.</br>    I don't normally care for this shade of hair, either. I don't know that I've ever beaten it to Erza.<br><br>But Flare? Unf.</br></br>          <br>What this series about?</br>    <br>I dropped the manga in Nov. so I have no idea, I just post all the girls from here.</br>  <br>The adventures/mis-adventures of a wizard guild named Fairy Tail.</br>  <br><br>I hate to break it to you, but that translation is wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>Long running "beat up the bad guy who's going to hurt people" shounen fighting manga. The premise is "the adventures of a magician's guild", but it really doesn't utilize that premise very much.<br><br>The storytelling is really cliche and lazy, fights included (nakama powerup: the manga), but the character antics are kinda fun, and the girls are hot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think scans of those last two are available in higher quality than has been already posted.</br>  <br><br>She really shouldn't have been redeemed.</br></br>   tfw, you will never get a hairjob from Flare. <br>Why even live?</br>    will she get tetanus?<br><br><br>also<br> didn't progress at all in one year </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>mashima's a closet footfag<br><br>I can sense these things</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> you will never shove your face in Flare's boobs during one of her crazed tilty poses or while she's freaking out over something </br></br>  <br>See bottom question</br>  <br>What a fucking faggot.</br>  <br> actually crying for fairy tail <br>how? the problem get resolved literally the next chapter.</br></br>  <br>Lucy's father died and stayed dead.</br>  <br>that made you cry? it was sad yeah but the way it happened so suddenly was like"oh, welp there goes any chance of him coming back" like there was no build up, it just happened.</br>  <br>Here, read this. It's from the end of a one-shot Mashima wrote named Christmas Hearts. Since you apparently missed the memo, it should give you an idea of why Mashima would tear up a bit while writing about some character's father suddenly passing away.</br>      I would put my cock inside wendy and leave it there for days. Follow her everywhere with my dick inside her.  <br>based Gaston, I'm so glad that he likes this garbage.</br>  <br>Fairy tail is shounen for the cancer masses. <br>feetfags = cancer<br><br>It's only obvious he would do that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck you, she just had a huge ladyboner for Erza and was too autistic to express it like a normal person</br>    <br><br>She tortured Lucy and Millianna. It wasn't for a mission, or out of a sense of loyalty; it was because she wanted to. As far as female Fairy Tail characters are concerned, she might be the most evil.<br><br>And perhaps more importantly, she's not very likable, and by Fairy Tail standards, she's not horribly attractive, either. There's no reason for her take up screentime or panel time when just about every other reoccurring member of the female cast is better. She should have simply died as a villain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>maxfile.ro Pomf's clone</br>  Sheesh, sometimes I miss this manga, if only for the delicious girls.<br><br>I dropped it around 20 volumes in because the stories felt repetitive, but every time I see these threads I feel like reading it again.</br></br>  <br><br>That's funny, because I dropped it about 20 chapters back.</br></br>  I want to rape Lucy.  <br><br>That tennis Erza drawing is a god send<br><br><br>I know how you feel. You'd think with previews like that people would be more motivated to get them but for some reason no one has.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't wait for her eventual side change and Mashima drawing her in other sexy outfits.</br>  <br>GSC ERZA WHEN</br>  <br>He just cant stop making best girls.</br>    <br>Why cant Gray just fuck her?</br>    <br>He's gay.</br>  <br>Why doesn't he just draw porn?</br>  <br>And make a lot less money? Fairy Tail is like a top 5 selling manga in Japan, why stop?</br>  <br>she might catch a cold</br>  <br>He already does, anon.<br><br>He draws it, then hides it. He's hidden it all in one place, and on his deathbed he will tell us that it's out there, and we just have to find it.</br></br></br>   this thread   Anyone got a screen of that KyoukaButt from the most recent ep?  <br>Because he is drawing Fairy Tail with food on the side.</br>  <br>This.</br>  Lucy dat ass<br>Mj<br>Lisanna<br>Juvia</br></br></br>   Tfw no high res image of the pic In the op.   Is there a hotter FT picture than this?<br>I doubt it.</br>  <br> Implying he doesn't </br>  <br>What did Gray see?</br>  <br>A puffy vulva.</br>  <br> How puffy? </br>  <br>Landing strip?</br>  <br>It's a shame she has a flat ass.</br>  <br>A tasteful puff of downy hair covering her mons, and veal smooth vulva. With a hint of dew</br>  <br>Those bottoms are doing a Herculean effort to contain that azz</br>    <br>No really, or at least she isn't supposed to have one. Her leotard basically disappears into her ass.</br>      <br>what chapter was this?</br>  <br>Natsu vs Mavis omake.</br>    <br>She has stolen my heart</br>  <br>The order goes:<br><br>Lucy<br>Erza<br>Wendy<br><br>None of the other girls matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How he manages to make one or more perfect semen demons per arc is a mystery to me.</br>  <br><br> all these wild guesses in lieu of official colors </br></br>  <br>I kind of liked purple Mavis.</br>      <br> Doesn't matter <br> had sex </br></br>  <br><br><br>It's pink, white or blonde. I just want mashima posters soon.</br></br></br>  <br>Or blue.</br>  <br>That's a color I actually dont want.</br>    <br>My gut feeling is that it's gonna be white</br>    <br>Cute</br>  <br>She's wonderful.</br>  Fairy Tail isnt great but it's just great for fanservice and best girls. Mashima clearly just loves drawing titties.  <br>Well for sure, if I could draw girls like he does, i'd draw titties all day.</br>  <br><br>Is this official art? Because if it is why doesn't he just do porn already</br></br>  <br>Tits are life.</br>  <br><br>Because the doujin industry is underground and he will never make as much money if he did porn. Instead he gives a generic shounen plot and teases Jap teen cock with all of these qts. It just works that much better.</br></br>  Mirajane and Mavis are the best FT girls<br>Would Mirajane be a sweet tender lover or a femdom?</br>  <br>both<br><br> Mavis <br><br>taste discarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Mavis</br>  <br>I dont want to go to jail.</br>  <br>But anon, she's hundreds of years old</br>  <br><br>Magician girls that will lose their powers if they wear a bra.</br></br>   no more Lemy <br>No way she'll come back now so wasted</br>  I hope the day comes, that mavis is revived and has delicious lesbian sex with wendy.  <br>It moved. <br><br>Juvia best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't she just do that anyway?</br>  <br>she can`t touch shit.</br>  <br>I swear I remember Laxus grabbing her from the swimming pool at one point. But I may be mistaken.</br>  <br>filler shit.</br>  <br>Ah okay.</br>  What does a tight ghost vagina feel like?  <br>tight</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  I wish Flare came back  <br>so she did shrink the island, boner yes</br>   Dat Makarov Beard <br> Zeref was the emperor <br><br>Mashima you bastard you bought yourself some more chapters</br></br></br>  Makarov sure has gotten old. Zeref is the emperor after all which means this could be the final arc for fairy tail.  So does this make Natsu an arch duke since he's the emperor's only living relative, his brother?   Makarov was chilling the whole time <br><br>Them fuckers almost literally got killed over nothing.</br></br>   Emperor of Spriggan, Zeref, walks back home <br><br>So, what happened to Acnologia? killed off screen?</br></br>     Zeref was the emperor <br>Wat<br><br>Well, that bumps up the schedule quite a bit.<br><br>Dem Erzas tho</br></br></br></br></br>  And dat  Angel       <br>uncensored when?</br>  Whelp Guess natsu is royalty    Will we ever get a Yukino and Angel reunion?   Zeref is the Emperor   <br> Why wasn't it Cobra <br><br>i'm pretty sure he is stalking Kinana.</br></br></br>  <br> She's actually killed someone <br>Bonus points</br></br>   Zeref <br>Someone fucking kill this guy already.</br>   Zeref is emperor <br> Natsu is the emperor's brother <br> Natsu is next in line  <br> Natsu for Emperor 2016. </br></br></br>  So Zeref NTR'd the shit out of Tartaros.  <br>Yeah, I grew tired of him. Too much nagging about wanting to die.</br>  <br>Jellal meeting Kagura when?</br>  Lucky nigga.  <br>nopan</br>  <br><br>So damn delicious.</br></br>  <br>I have the feeling Mashima finally realized what we're all here for and stops beating around the bush. Cast is going overseas? Better put all female characters in bikinis.<br>New female character introduced? Put her in a bikini. Old female character reintroduced? Bikini.<br><br>That man speaks my language. And might I also emphasize that he really put some thought into the design of the swimsuits? Those feathers on her breasts, neck and shoes look just gorgeous.</br></br></br></br>  Is Erza to this day undefeated in battle?  <br>Didn't Jose fuck her up back in the Phantom Lord arc?</br>  <br>Yep. Jose defeated her pretty handily back in the Phantom Lord arc. <br><br>And Hoteye, Racer, and Cobra left her on the ground poisoned and more or less helpless back in the Oracion Seis arc.</br></br></br>  <br> Lucky <br> for just a look <br><br>I'd beat the shit out of Zeref and Acgnoglia just to get in that Juicy Lucy Booty.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like Erza has become useless in basically anything that is not a 1 on 1, aside from that 100 monster bullshit back in the GmG.</br>  <br>Azuma won a round with prep to give himself field advantage. That's probably the closest to her losing a fair fight.<br><br>Oh, and Midnight briefly KO'd her with Spiral Pain, but she figured out the tricks to beating him from that round.<br><br><br>Yes, but she was already beat up from blocking Jupiter.<br><br><br>Yes, but it took 3 on 1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, and Marin Hollow just hard-countered her by shutting off her requip and porting her to another dimension.</br>  <br>Amen.</br>  zeref walking through a city is a strange image, considering that if his emotions shift a little, there will be corpses everywhere.  <br>What are you doing there, Nefertari Vivi?</br>  <br>Its probably just his imagination like that one Fairy Girl's power</br>  <br>Well he looks pretty pissed so (ironically) they're safe.</br>  Natsu vs Zeref vs Arcnologia when?  <br>Now it's looking an arc sooner than expected.</br>  If you joined Fairy Tail would Mavis greet you with a hug?   actual unexpected plot twist <br><br>well shit me, tits and plot all in one chapter sasuga Mashima</br></br>  <br> he actually reads fairy tits </br>  <br>yup, I really enjoy it</br>   Carla falling on her ass <br><br>How.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>I'm glad that the Oracion Seis arc was popular enough to make them into reoccurring characters.<br><br>How long until she meets Yukino?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn I was trying to remember where this chick was from.<br><br>Oracion fucking Seis didn't they have that big fat guy who cried a lot and also oneshotted Marko?</br></br></br>  <br>She was leaning back and lost her support.</br>  <br>You're thinking of Aria from Phantom Lord.</br>  <br>Kek'd hard at this panel.</br>  I want to impregnate Wendy and watch her small frame struggle with labour.  <br><br>I want to impregnate you.</br></br>  Has Makarov seen Zeref before this? I don't remember.<br><br> Next chapter: Hideous Fairy <br>What could it mean?</br></br></br>  <br> more Angel <br>Really needs more doujins</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is Karen?</br>  <br>Spriggans are ugly fairies.</br>  <br>Where's Carue?<br><br>Jellal coming...</br></br></br>  <br>Chick who was Loki's original wizard chick. Was a bitch but as fuck.  More doujins with her and Angel. </br>  <br>A celestial spirit user that was in Blue Pegasus. She constantly abused one of her spirits that had Leo/Loki take a stand and stay in the spirit world for months which was draining her magic but she needed work so she extended herself ran into Angel and got killed.</br>  <br>Karen Lilica, the Blue Pegasus bitch who was formerly Leo and Aries's master.</br>  Why hasn't this been page been posted yet?  <br>Who the fuck wants to look at this Sausgay clone thats why.</br>  <br>But he stopped wanting to die after the Timeskip.<br><br>Now he wants to kill everyone else!</br></br></br>  <br> long live the emperor <br>It's not like anyone can do anything about that</br></br>  Will Angel join Saber Tooth before the epilogue?  <br>Sasuke never wanted to kill himself. For all his edge he had yet to master the art of the truly edgy of attempted immortal suicide by creating a demon that is also his otouto.<br><br> Along with all them other True Dragon Slayers considering there were four other eggs hatched. </br></br></br>  <br>I want to consensually make love to Angel.</br>  <br>But that's what makes him so great. There's no need to worry about the following ruler being a despot or a baby eater since he is immortal!<br><br>Long live the emperor!<br><br><br>I'm still surprised they haven't met yet. Even Cobra met his girl during that canon filler arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> That's Yukino, her younger sister. Neither is aware of what the other is doing right now. <br><br><br><br><br>That'll be her true face turn. She won't be keeping up the bad guy act for long after that. The question is whether she'll stay with her sister at Saber Tooth or remain in Crime Sorciere after it happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crime Sorciere <br><br>Kek is that really the name of Jelal's crew?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh then yeah I went Yukino. Angel's too much of a slut for me.<br><br><br>It's meant to sound exotic and French, you uncultured swine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> wants a shy retard instead of assertive sexy <br> you uncultured swine <br><br>u so gay anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino is love.</br>  <br><br><br><br> not liking both <br><br>I'm looking forward to a sexy team up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Waifu: MJ<br>  housewife skills over 9000 <br>  beautiful, kind, sexy, graceful, compassionate <br>  can go demon bad if loved ones are in trouble <br>  most probably also a demon in bed <br><br>Waifu (if not MJ): Erza<br>Mistress: CS Ultear<br>Wincest: Kagura<br>If simply for banging: Lucy<br>Royal bang: Hisui</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  That chapter was sad panda tier.  <br>Hidden Mashima's FT porn is the One Piece</br>  <br><br>Reminder that Kirito rolled as a spriggan in ALO.</br></br>  What if Zeref just wants to join Fairy Tail?  <br> mfw I just fucking realized that <br> mfw all this ovation is fucking pissing Zeref <br> mfw every time they say "long live emperor" he feels like they're mocking of him <br> mfw this is the reason they're safe around him and the more mad he is the more safe they're <br>Dammit, this cracks me up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably already is a member. A secret fifth founder of the guild, personally invited by Mavis.</br>  <br>Forgot pic</br>  <br>Poor Zeref</br>   Acnologia is going to side with FT <br> Last battle will be END vs Zeref vs Acnologia </br>  <br>Will he demand a Fairy Dragon Loli as payment,to one up Zeref's Fairy Ghost/Granny Loli?</br>  More Wendy is needed. That is all.  <br>he's going to demand a fucking cat</br>  <br>So how come his magic isn't killing everyone ?<br><br>Anyway, that transforms what we expected to be a huge filler arc into one that might as well be the last.</br></br></br>  <br>He only kills things if he cares abot their lives.<br><br>Which means he does not give a single fuck for them.</br></br></br>    bikini Wendy became the joke duo with Natsu <br><br>I'm totally fine with that.</br></br>  You ever had a dream about an anime character?  I dreamed about ZOE3 once  <br>Yes, because I'm living the dream.</br>  <br>How do you dream about something that doesn't and will never exist?</br>  <br>Just take a look at your life.</br>   I was walking through a mall, decided to take the stairs in a musty old clothes stoor to get to a higher floor <br> Come out onto this old victorian village in the dead of night, tightly packed buildings all with glowing yellow windows <br> Walk through the town, marvelling at how beautiful it is <br> Eventually end up on a road outside the main town and bump into a girl who looks like pic related <br> We talk about something I can't remember, but later on down the road we end up kissing <br> We walk and somehow end up in like this well lit underground room with smaller rooms leading off it <br> It's her home, we end up making out in her bunk bed <br> I whisper to her "I'll come back for you" and then I flash forward to fighting soldiers with spears and swords and shields invading her home <br> There's half a dozen pink circles about 2ft wide on the floor, once you step on them they disappear <br> Once they all disappear a door with a black void contained within opens on one of the walls <br> We hesitate then she walks through and I follow <br> We fall through space and then through one of those diagrams of a wormhole while I shout a bunch of science mumbo jumbo to make her feel safe <br> We fall through the hole at the bottom and end up in front of a pin coloured, roman style temple <br> We're running up the steps together <br><br>Then I woke up. <br><br>The softness of her lips, the smell of her hair...it was all so real. And now it's gone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When I was 8 I had a dream that I forcibly raped Ryuko. No lie. The fact that she was so unwilling really had me depressed, I still haven't been able to watch Tenchi Muyo since.  <br>Ryoko*<br><br>I don't even fucking like Kill La Kill.</br></br></br>  No, but I've had dreams of  buying  rare manga and hanging out with various mangaka.  I had a dream of myself fucking Madoka Kaname while Homura knelt naked by us and got cuckqueaned.  <br><br>when i was 13 i had my first wet dream to being "raped" by ryuko, when all it really was was her forcibly making me release my seed in pleasure.<br><br>For some reason though before waking up i kind of remember seeing sasami's face zoom in and out on a black background, sort of like the old batman TV show did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had a dream that I was getting a blow job from the angel boy from Evangelion.</br>  <br><br><br>it's 2:30 am and i typo'd it too.<br><br> i liked klk </br></br></br></br></br>  One time I dreamt about watching some episode of sailor moon back in the day.<br>That was pretty neat.</br>  Dear diary,<br><br>Today I had a dream where I posted blogshit on an anonymous imageboard.<br><br>Reminder to report op.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being depresed <br> watches EoE <br> dreaming I'm Shinji </br></br></br>  I once had a dream where I had vanilla sex with Yuno Gasai. I fucking hate Mirai Nikki, though.  <br>#rekt</br>    <br>Never at all.<br><br>I actually find that weird. I don't think I've had a dream about any work of fiction before. I wonder why that is.</br></br></br>  <br>Not exactly an anime character, but just last night for some odd reason I had a dream where I met Noriko Shitaya.</br>   [Doki] Joukamachi no Dandelion - 02 (1280x720 Hi10P AAC) [59CD22C8].mkv   People use Doki?  <br><br>Only thing worse than HS eyecancer is Commie trollsubs.</br></br>  <br>No. Most likely it was a bot that posted this.</br>  <br>The only other option is funimation cancer which isn't even out yet.</br>  <br>Bots have good taste then.</br>  stupid superpower thread?  <br>It wasn't explained in the anime, but in the manga the wall was some stupidly high tech wall that wasn't invented yet, which was why it took 40 million yen. <br><br>Anyways an OP power like that without any limitations would be stupid. I still remember brain in a jar kid from Bleach</br></br></br>  Fucking childhood friend ruining incest once again.  <br>Why didnt she just sell it ? I bet a lot of rich people would want a wall impossible to destroy for safety reasons</br>  <br> brain in a jar kid from Bleach <br>There was nobody like that in Bleach.</br></br>  <br>I want to believe.</br>  Fuck this show. Why doesn't she just wear spats?  <br>Is this worth picking up? The first 5 minutes made the premise seem dorky as fuck</br>  <br><br>She's not a tomboy. Only tomboys are allowed to wear spats.</br></br>  <br><br>No it's moeshit.</br></br>  <br>But I like moeshit.</br>  How does it feel knowing the end of the hiatus is coming soon?  <br>Why was 2011 so mediocre?</br>   implying the hiatus is ever going to end    2016 <br> WSJ announces that HxH will resume with a brand new chapter <br> Japan goes batshit, the Prime Minister declares a National holiday so people can go buy their WSJ fix <br> The fate day finally comes <br> People flock over stores for a copy, endless lines of faithful fans <br> They get to read it <br> The ''chapter'' is a 5 page epilogue saying that Gon and Killua had much more adventures and even married different women in the future, then it ends with a big ''THANK YOU!'' while Gon and Killua are walking towards the sunset. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that there was nothing wrong with Pouf's motivations and no one was truly in the wrong, therefore supporting either side is retarded.  WHENNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN<br><br>TOGASHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>III</wbr></br></br>  <br>He was a much better character than Meruem and his brothers.</br>  <br>Because of what its based on.</br>  <br>the best anime since FMA brotherhood is mediocre?</br>  <br>Togashi wouldn't do this, right?<br>Togashi is on the shotacons' side, right?<br>Right?</br></br></br>  <br>honestly if he had just ended the phantom troupe arc with Kurapika getting his revenge, then the manga stopping at Gon meeting Ging would have been perfect. I don't even feel the need to have the dark world exploration arc.</br>  Togashi is busy with Tokyo Ghoul Re right now so I don't see him having time to start up HxH right nowm  <br>How come? I thought they were all great.<br>Almost everything about Meruem was empirical, except for his innate instinct to subjugate other species. It made him interesting to me because instead of having a pre-determined set of morals and values, he explored every new emotion he was feeling. He also was a genuinely kind person, which makes him very likeable. <br><br>I agree there wasn't much to Pitou, but the way she was loyal to the King while also caring deeply for his growing empathy was something really unexpected, i believe it's part of why Gon lost his shit so much. In the end it was a shame Pitou had to go, because all that situation was based on misunderstandings and past actions. It really was an unfinished character.<br><br>Yupi was also really interesting, because before the invasion we didn't know anything about him except that he perfectly fit the enhancer archetype. Even against Shoot, he didn't rely on any sort of strategy. But like Meruem, he started exploring all the new emotions he felt during the course of his sparring with Knuckle/Morel or Killua. I think he was a good person too, after seeing what happened to Meruem i believe even Pitou would have been on Pouf's side.<br><br>They weren't bad characters at all, they just had so much more potential for change, and that's a bit sad considering they all died prematurely.<br> Sorry if anything of the above doesn't make sense, i'm pretty drunk. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shit director who didnt understand the material</br>  <br> I don't even feel the need to have the dark world exploration arc. <br><br>Of course it's necessary. Togashi's end game is to kill Jump. He's obviously going to continue siphoning money out of them for doing nothing as long as he possibly can.</br></br></br>    <br>Nah he understood it alright, it was a very faithful adaptation. That being said I prefer 99 because of its atmosphere and cel shaded animation. Really gives an old classic adventure kind of feel, but there's also a lingering darkness in the back that you just can't shake off and it grows and grows until you reach the Yorknew City arc where you realize you're not really watching the same anime anymore. 99 impacted me in so many ways.</br>  <br> there's nothing wrong with manipulating your loved one's life if they aren't the kind of person you'd prefer them to be <br><br>Okay anon</br></br></br>  <br>killua is such a qt, id go gay for him any day of the week</br>  At least we have Black Clover, right guys?  <br> projecting human values onto literal bugs <br>Okay anon<br><br>In a way it was great, because it really blurred the line between human and ant nature. He wanted what would be best for the king of the ants, but jealousy and selfishness also are very human emotions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>I think the Hanzo "fight" scene really marked me as a kid, because i remembered it perfectly even before rewatching it.<br> I also thought the battleship filler episode was canon for the longest time. </br></br></br>  <br> Nah he understood it alright, it was a very faithful adaptation </br>  <br>2011 had terrible directing, what made it so good was the story aka the source material. Brotherhood was a similar situation.</br>  <br>He understood it so well that he failed to properly depict the MC's personality. Honestly it seemed more like the director believed that he was adapting a straight-forward shounen series. <br><br>2011 also isn't as faithful as people like to believe, it adds in things in weird places, removes things, as well as interprets others in it's own way.</br></br></br>  ITT: Citations needed  <br>I don't know, it had a few scenes with pretty decent directing, like Gon's flashback about the Pitou/Kite events, fading into a vision of Kite's mutilated corpse into his eye. It made it perfectly clear that it was a traumatic experience for him.<br>There was also episode 134. I think they had one good set of directors, which is a shame because it could have been a fucking excellent adaptation if they were in charge of everything.</br></br>  <br>Why would citations be needed for an observation?</br>  <br>A few scenes that have decent directing out of over 100 episodes doesn't change the fact that the series has shit directing overall.</br>  <br>Very few. So few it's pathetic.<br><br>Episode 134 was definitely the stand-out episode though, good taste there anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Name a show that's over 100 episodes long with god tier directing all throughout then. <br><br>Protip: no such show exists.</br></br></br>  <br>Urusei Yatsura</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Fuck you I almost cried during this scene when I realized I have been with my little sister for 22 years and I hated her guts ever since she was born but alluka and killua were together for like what 3-4 years and they could tell each other they love them like wtf this shit isn't real but why does it make me realize I'm such a trash of a person and I should kill myself<br><br> thanks for reading my blog </br></br></br>  <br>Feel free to try again.</br>  <br>How is that changing the fact that 2011 has shit directing?</br>  <br>Feel free to stay wrong.</br>  <br>Chimera Ant arc adaptation was very good. <br><br>Maybe it was because I read skimmed the manga because the art back then was so bad, but I didn't truly understand the rift between Killua and Gon until I saw the adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, i agree, that's not the point i was trying to make at all. I just wanted to point out that that it had much more potential.</br></br>  <br>The CA arc had terrible pacing.<br><br>Out of curiosity what do you believe caused that rift?</br></br></br>  <br> shit director who didnt understand the material <br>Nether did Togashi.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but did it? I don't really remember because it's been a while since i watched it, but the only parts i remember having shit pacing are episodes 115, 130 and the first half of 125.<br><br>What</br></br></br>  <br>Togashi is the one who wrote the series dipshit.</br>  <br>I remember looking for these scenes in the manga and I was surprised to find out they were anime original, it really was much needed creativity.</br>  <br> I think that's the joke. </br>  <br>Im not disagreeing with you but i think most sports anime i've seen do a good job, Diamond no ace, hajime no ippo</br>  <br>It's not hard to get a sports anime wrong.</br>  <br>Believe it or not I've actually come across people who genuinely believe it.</br>  <br>beacause never had a father figure in his life so he was a selfish brat from the start. Mito can't even handle gon as it's mentioned that she puts up with gon's faults.<br><br>During CA arc though gon meets Kite who he sees for the first time as a father figure even related to his real father so when pitou fucked up kite gon as the selfish brat he is puts kite as his priority and everyone know that when gon makes up his mind no one else can change it. Now when Killua picks up something is unusual about pitou he wanted to stop gon and confirm but gon is focused only on kite and killua realizes that gon will disregard everything and everyone else if he had set his mind on something<br><br>every arc before AC proves this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah hate to break it to you but that's wrong, you should probably go read the manga. Starting from chapter 1.</br>  <br> what do you believe caused that rift? <br><br>I think even after Killua removed the needle he was insecure about himself. His assassin upbringing did some permanent damage, making him more apathetic. He can still make friends but I don't think he'll ever connect with someone as deeply as with Gon. <br><br><br>On the other hand Gon is completely on the opposite spectrum. He can feel strong emotions for anyone, not just Killua. Which is why he went through all that for Kite, who he met just once before. <br><br>So when Gon told him to stay out of the fight with Pitou because it didn't concern him that really hurt. Remember when Killua told him to calm down, Gon said "it's easy for you"? that's the key moment</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Took me 10 hours but It finally finished, can't wait to watch it all over again  <br>Same as this person <br>Go read the series from chapter 1. Because hate to break it to you but that's wrong.</br></br>  <br> FLAC <br><br>for what purpose</br></br></br>  <br>if you're talking about how gon meets kite for the first time or the bear then I don't see where I'm wrong</br>  <br> level 1 reader <br><br>Hate to break it to you but you need to fuck off back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>a /g/ meme</br>  <br>You are. Again go read chapter 1. <br><br><br> says the person who admitted to not really reading the manga <br>Never been on there, never going to . Also not changing the fact that you're wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you even speak english you illiterate retard?<br><br> Which is why he went through all that for Kite, who he met just once before.  <br><br>Yeah, I implied they've met before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> During CA arc though gon meets Kite who he sees for the first time as a father figure <br>I don't know if you're implying that Gon met Kite for the first time during the CA arc, but you're wrong if that's the case.<br><br>Also i don't have the same interpretation as you. Gon felt guilty and weak for being a liability to Kite and playing a role in his death, two things he didn't know how to handle (see the exam arc after Hisoka's punch and the scene after he cries when he fails to defeat Knuckle). When he was denied of his revenge, he felt even weaker and powerless. I think Gon-san was a manifestation of his desire to "be strong", but even he knew it wasn't solving anything and was solely for revenge and self-punishment.<br><br>About what he said to Killua, i'm still having a hard time understanding. I think it's related to the fact that Killua changed his course to help Ikalgo a few moments before that scene, but there's definitely more to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you actually read the series or did you just wiki the summary?</br>  <br>First off, I don't know why you keep repeating "chapter 1" like it's some obscure nugget of information tucked away that nobody knows about but you.<br><br>They've recapped the fact that Kite met Gon way back even at the beginning of the ant arc.<br><br>Secondly, do you honestly think Killua would go crazy and sacrifice everything for revenge for anyone else besides Gon?<br><br> They have two fundamentally different personalities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess Gon noticed Killua didn't really care about Kite? Killua even confirmed it in his thoughts.</br>  <br>I've read the series, that's why I said that you're wrong. Again you yourself admitted to merely skimming the manga and not paying attention, if you did then you'd know what really caused the rift.</br>  <br>It's not that Killua didn't care about Kite, it's that he's just incapable of feeling strong enough motions to sacrifice himself like that, needle or no needle. <br><br>Replace Kite with Kurapika or Leorio and you'd get the same thing. Gon would sacrifice himself. Killua would be angry and want revenge but still be able to think things through collectedly.</br></br></br>  <br>You're not talking to same anon, also this may come as a surprise to you but the 2011 adaptation actually changed Gon and Kite's first meeting, and then every scene afterwards when Gon talks about Kite, that's why I say to go read the first chapter.</br>  <br> I've read the series <br><br>Then go back and read it again. And when you're finished, get a dictionary, find a couple of people who aren't retarded, and ask them to help you read it once more. <br><br>After that you may retire back to reddit and kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mention chapter 1 anywhere anon. I even suggested that i might have misunderstood what that anon meant. Calm down. <br>Also they didn't "recap", they changed the story.<br><br>Also i don't see how what you said about Killua has anything to do with my post.</br></br></br></br>  Who is the best character and why is it Leorio?  <br>He outright admits to not caring in the manga.</br>   end of the hiatus <br>Bullshit.</br>  <br>No anon, you gotta believe we're getting SIX whole chapters this year before Togashi-sensei needs another rest.</br>  <br> Being this retarded </br>  <br> says the person who outright admits to not reading the arc in the manga <br><br>Is it really too much to handle the fact that anime just didn't adapt it correctly or changed things which is why I say to actually go read the manga?</br></br></br>  <br>First of all, my point wasn't based on 2011's adaptation of Gon and Kite's first meeting. You're attacking a strawman. <br><br>It sounds like you're implying that Gon wouldn't risk his life for anyone besides Kite because they have some special connection.<br><br>Gon would have done the same for just about any other character he has spent time with. The meeting with Kite doesn't matter. That's just how he is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't remind anon. That way it doesn't hurt as much when it ends.</br>  <br>No idiot. You keep implying that Killua's mad because Gon and Kite met at the beginning of the series without him? Do you have any idea how retarded you sound?</br>  <br>  would have done the same for just about any other character he has spent time with. <br>Are you sure? I doubt he'd react the same way if he hadn't played a role in their death. If Pitou just killed Kite in a way that had nothing to do with Gon, i don't think he'd have flipped out nearly as much.</br></br>  <br>where was I wrong I've read the manga and seen the original up to GI final, just elaborate yourself instead of pointing out suggestion so we can have an actual discussion</br>  <br><br>Gon would've blamed himself no matter what the scenario was. That's just survivor's guilt.</br></br>  <br>Except you're the one who brings up the episode recap of the 2011 anime, also you're attempting to change the subject. <br><br>Your idea on why he's mad is wrong.<br><br><br>Never once implied that though, is you're reading comprehension that bad?<br><br>All I said was that Killua admits to not caring about Kite, which is true he doesn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is literally how retarded if things went according to your interpration<br><br> Killua: Wow I can't believe Gon met Kite before. I'm so jealous! I can't believe he has this special connection with Kite that I didn't know about. I'm so cross with him! <br><br>You have the reading comprehension of a 5 year old seriously</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Except I never once said that. Nice reading comprehension.</br>  <br>Alluka is a boy though</br>    <br>No.</br>  <br>ebin</br>  <br>only Illumi calls alluka as otouto while everyone else including servants treats alluka as a girl</br>  It's what this person said,<br><br>Something to remember is that 2011 Gon is actually different from manga Gon. 2011 also did a bad job of showing Killua's mindset during the arc. It wasn't the removed needle causing the insecurity, it was there before Killua removed it. The insecurity was caused by Killua himself overthinking things.<br><br>Also over the course of the CA arc we do see that Killua is quite capable connecting with others, he just chooses not to.<br><br>To Gon, Kite was an important person, the manga nails this point home by constantly having Gon talk about him over and over again (which 2011 cuts out). Kite was Gon's mentor.<br><br>What made Killua so upset during the arc was that he genuinely didn't care about Kite, but just wanted Gon to be at the center of Gon's attention, to the point that he ignored and even enabled Gon's traumatized state. Then when shit hit the fan, and Gon was broken, Killua finally told Gon to stop, but by then it was too late. Killua even admits that he's tantrum at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually everyone else calls Alluka an it. They don't use male or female pronouns to describe Alluka, because they don't think think of Alluka as human.</br>  <br>Only her parents do that.</br>  So what happens if a Zoldyck woman births a female child?  <br>Actually the whole family does, also if they all really treat Alluka like an it, not a person. Killua is the only one who does that.</br>  <br>It grows a penis</br>  <br>What do they actually refer to Alluka as? I'd sooner believe they're saying この子 than anything</br>  <br>Illumi, Milluki, and the butlers use male words for Alluka.</br>  <br> while everyone else including servants treats alluka as a girl <br>That's fucking wrong you stupid tripfag.<br><br>Servants in the flashbacks were all referring to Alluka as "bocchan"</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was incorrect as anon points out they use male words for Alluka</br>  so should I read the manga or what anime adaptation should I watch?  <br>yeah I just checked butlers referred to alluka as bocchan</br>  <br> so should I read the manga <br>yes</br></br>  <br>Oops sorry for some reason I thought you were speaking of the parents, would you happen to know what Kikyo and Silva refer to Alluka as?</br>  <br>Yes go read the manga, lessen your confusion that way.</br>  <br>It, they call Alluka an it. Everyone else except for Killua calls Alluka a boy.</br>  <br>Kikyo and Silva use it/neutral.</br>  <br><br>what do they say in Japanese? この子?</br></br>  <br>The butlers call Alluka young master, and the parents use gender neutral pronouns.</br>  <br>so they're not referring to Alluka as "it", then.</br>  Killua specifically refers to Alluka as his imouto and he's the closest to her by far.  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=axI<wbr>cJVNdddA</wbr>  [ ]<br>9:15 he says あれ<br>I don't have the raws for the manga to know how they call alluka in japanese <br><br>The butlers call alluka as bocchan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the manga Mito lied to Gon about Ging being alive and told Gon that he was dead. Gon had to be told by Kite that Ging was alive and what a Hunter was. Also in the first chapter despite the fact that he himself admits that it's selfish of him to chase after his father (and even has reservations against it), and apologizes to Mito constantly, which Mito tries to guilt trip him into staying.<br><br>When he leaves for ship, Mito finally admits to Gon that she lied to him about Ging abandoning Gon, and that she won custody over Gon in court. We even find out later on that Gon has a social worker and has to keep up with his schooling.</br></br></br>  <br> failed to properly depict the MC's personality <br> as well as interprets others in it's own way <br>Are we still talking about the 2011 version? because that sounds like the 99 one.</br></br></br>  <br>anon you're dead inside,that's the only plausible explanation.</br>  <br>2011 changed MCs back story to suit itself. Also take a good look at the thread.</br>  <br>Alright, are there any examples of how they refer to Alluka in casual conversation? Because in that scene he could be interpreted as referring to Nanika as well.</br>  <br> The CA arc had terrible pacing. <br>I just finished it, and jesus christ is it as bad as people say. <br><br>There were a lot of cool moments interrupted by EPISODES of side characters I couldn't give a fuck about.</br></br></br></br>  <br> i don't care some of those characters so it's bad <br>I actually enjoyed the fact that there were no small roles. The Ikalgo/Welfin situation eventually led to the Pitou/Gon-san confrontation and Meruem's last moments with Komugi.</br></br>  <br>You personally not caring about well written characters who got plenty of development, had interesting characterization and played important roles in the arc =/= bad.<br><br>And I don't know where you get the idea people always say it's bad, it's highly regarded by most. The word masterpiece gets thrown around a lot.</br></br></br>  <br> i don't care some of those characters so it's bad <br>Nothing is objectively bad or good. I'm only agreeing with the viewers who dislike the literal episodes disrupting pivotal Gon, Netero, or Meru moments. <br><br> The Ikalgo/Welfin situation eventually led to the Pitou/Gon-san confrontation  <br>It obviously didn't have to happen that way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And I don't know where you get the idea people always say it's bad <br>I see plenty of people who praise CA while admitting that the pacing is bad.<br><br> The word masterpiece gets thrown around a lot. <br>And I don't think they're wrong. Why you felt the need to say that, I'll never know.</br></br></br></br></br>  All the build up leading to this scene and when they get spotted I literally shat bricks.  <br>Oh ignore that, I didn't see the quote so I thought you meant bad in general rather than badly paced.<br><br>The manga is better paced in my opinion but it wasn't bad in the anime either. It's less of a pacing issue and more of a structural one, though it's not necessarily bad either. It just follows multiple perspectives.</br></br></br>  <br> episodes <br>Oh, i understand now. In the manga, the pivotal scenes weren't disrupted, see the beginning of the Meruem/Netero confrontation. In the anime, there are 2 and a half episodes between the time where Netero tells Meruem to make him admit defeat and the actual fight, whereas in the manga these two chapters followed each other (290 if you want to check).<br>In short, you have an issue with the adaptation, not the arc itself.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing compares to Pokkle hiding under the bones in the ant hive.</br>  <br><br>Why the fuck wouldn't people read the post chain for context.

He fucked up badly and got ambushed after bringing a non nen user into a dangerous mission.<br>I think he didn't deserve such an end though, he seemed like a humble guy when he apologized to Pika.</br></br>  <br> hiatus <br><br>Feels like a Millennial Torpor.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't hiatuses always end for like 4 weeks, and then it's back to months and months of nothing?</br>  <br>Ponzu ;_;</br>  <br>https://hiatus-hiatus.rhcloud.com/</br>  <br>Someone should send this everyday to Togashi or send him a red 'X' for every day he doesn't do anything.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he even gets death threats.</br>  <br>Did I miss something or are you trying to ruse me?</br>  <br>Probably from his editors</br>  <br>I'm gonna set this as my homepage.

You mark my words.</br>  <br>Jealous, but I don't know if HxH could keep the same level of quality with that sort of output. It was clever of Araki to do the generational thing to keep it fresh but that wouldn't work for HxH. <br><br>Actually I guess that's what will happen if Ging is the mc in dc arc. Not a bad way to do it.</br></br></br>  <br> the generational thing <br>To those who are also JoJo readers, is the quality of writing consistently good? If I were to pick it up, should I take it as seriously as HxH?</br></br>  PLEASE TOGASHI. I WANT NEW CHAPTERS. I WANT MY SHOTAS.  <br>The new chapters won't have any shotas.</br>  <br>The writing is okay.You have to be in the right mindset to read JoJo.Don't take everything seriously,but don't treat it like a parody either.Just enjoy what's happening as it's happening.Also,if plot holes and dropped plot lines trigger you,just avoid it altogether.</br>  <br>no, because when you read arc 7,everything you knew is no longer relevant</br>  <br>I'd say JoJo is similar to HxH as in the parts differ a lot from each other, just like HxH arcs, and has really creative abilities. It's definitely worth reading.</br>  <br>It's really nothing like HxH and isn't supposed to be taken seriously in the same way. It's creative and entertaining but it's pretty much just shallow fun and quality varies between parts.</br>  <br>You read JoJo for superficially ridiculous situations with crazy and great art past part 3, not for good writing.</br>  <br> You have to be in the right mindset to read JoJo.Don't take everything seriously,but don't treat it like a parody either. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hey these are some really neat insights. thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now the real question is,  who's the best shota? </br>  <br>The ones that look like lolis.</br>  <br>Easy answer. He is very cute, you know.</br>  <br>Damn, i knew you had shit taste, but i thought it was in some sort of ironical way.</br>  i want to watch another anime like hunter x hunter <br><br>but they're all shit</br></br>  <br>Excuse me?</br>    <br>Don't tell me this monstrosity is supposed to look cute. It looks worse than the earlier designs of Pitou, which are supposed to look unsettling.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br> muh atmosphere </br></br></br></br></br></br>  i love how clean and colourful the anime is  <br>Where was atmosphere mentionned in these posts?</br>  <br><br>When 1999 fags start dissing the 2011 version it's their main argument for 1999's supposed superiority.</br></br>  <br>No one mentionned the 99 version either. Stop being autistic.</br>  If 1999 is so good, why did it end after Greed Island? Checkmate, 1999fags.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128008734 <br>SEE YOU IN 30 DAYS</br>  Right now Togashi is on a beach, thinking of how to move forward with character progression, and plot. He's not rushing things, because he knows that his work is something special. <br><br>You should be thankful.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128008734    Options for best girl: Dead, Gorilla, Evil, Lying Cunt, Meganeshit, Jewnose AND dead, Dog, Irrelevant <br>Why doesn't Hunter x Hunter have any good girls?</br>  <br>Thank god Palm and Kite exist</br>  <br>Ah yes, I forgot.<br> Creepy yandere <br> Was a man </br></br></br>  <br>that's a lovely piece of fanart. saved.</br>  <br>They have plenty unless your idea of good is conventionally attractive and boring enough to make you romantically attracted to them</br>  <br> unless your idea of good is conventionally attractive <br>I dislike the fact that my idea of what's attractive in a mate has been conditioned by literally hundreds of millions of years of evolution too man, but there's no reason to pretend that isn't the case.</br></br>  <br>palm is a slut<br><br>Kite's pretty good though</br></br></br>  <br>Who are Evil, Lying Cunt and Irrelevant?</br>  <br><br>When did anyone ever mention '99?<br>Conversely why are 2011fags always feel the need to bring it up anytime someone criticizes 2011?</br></br></br>  <br> Evil <br>Machi<br> Lying Cunt <br>Mito<br> Irrelevant <br>Everyone else</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Palm is good because she's a ripoff of Yukako,and Yukako is the best girl in anything ever.</br></br>  <br>then thank god best girls (especially in hxh's case) aren't solely determined by what you yourself deems fuckable.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with that, it's just nice that HxH doesn't try to cater to it like you'd usually expect</br>  <br>Oh wow, i never realized they were so similar. The hair abilities should have been a sign.<br>I think Palm really shines after the yandere shenanigans though, and that's where she's less like Yukako.</br></br>  <br>Evolution affects you too.</br>  <br> implying Machi being evil doesn't make her better </br>  <br> Wanting a girl who will kill you if you talk shit about Chrollo </br>  <br> Talking shit about Chrollo </br>  <br> Shitting about Chrollo </br>  <br>Considering HxH threads are full of men who want to fuck 12 year old 2D boys I wouldn't be so sure</br>  <br>Chrollo is a creepy motherfucker, just look at his face and weird cross on his forehead. Nigga doesn't even know why he kills people, he's some kind of psychopath just like the rest of the Troupe.</br>  <br> Shitting on Chrollo </br>  Gon, Hisoka, Kite, Neferpitou. Who will else lose their arm in the future? I'm currently on the Chimera Ant arc  <br>Netero, Meruem, Gon again</br>  <br>Netero loses an arm and a leg and dies. Gon loses his arm to pitou during his hulkout but he uses his severed arm to fist her right in the chestpussy</br>  <br>never said that it doesn't, if you couldn't already gather that. Best girls criteria aren't wholly dependent on how much of a cock cocktease they are conceived to be, especially in hxh's case as stated before.</br>  <br>Thanks for the spoilers anon.</br>  <br>Komugi dies too</br>  <br> asks for spoilers <br> get them <br>What did you expect? It's a dick move but do yourself a favour and finish before reading threads</br></br></br>  <br>i feel for you but you seriously weren't expecting spoilers in a thread about this series?</br>  Gon's fight with Pitou spoils the fact that Gon is going to grow up to at least equal Meruem (looked to be in his 20's or 30's and probably exceeds this power later), so what's the point in reading HxH past that point? <br><br>Game's over boys. That's like revealing that Luffy finds One Piece and becomes king of the pirates.</br></br>  <br>He won't and if that's what you got out of it then you weren't paying attention.</br>  <br>It was stated by multiple people that he forced himself to mature to an age where he was capable of beating Pitou.</br>  <br>Well you might as well have stopped at heaven's arena because that's where we learn he has incredible potential<br>Also Gon-san was more of an hypotical "what if Gon reached his absolute best", i doubt it's a realistic version of what he'll grow up to be<br>Anyway i don't see him getting his powers back anytime soon</br></br></br>  <br> that's where we learn he has incredible potential <br>It was speculation though. In the Pitou fight we were shown empirically that Gon could reach that height if he aimed for it.</br></br>  <br> It was speculation though <br>No, it wasn't.<br> if he aimed for it <br>That's pretty irrelevant considering it never was his objective.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, it wasn't. <br>Why do I even have to explain this to you? Seeing some kid do something spectacular doesn't mean they're going to rival Meruem or Netero. Try harder man. <br><br> considering it was never his objective <br>Who cares? The fact is, he can. So there's no point in reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He still an annoying faggot</br>  <br> Seeing some kid do something spectacular <br>Zeno said Killua had the most talent out of any Zoldyck, which meant he could grow up to be stronger than him and Silva. Gon is the same as Killua. It never was a surprise they could grow up to be ridiculously strong. <br> So there's no point in reading. <br>There's no point in reading because something irrelevant to the character's motivations has been revealed? What? It's like saying there's no point in reading it because Gon became a hunter.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shitting Chrollo </br>  <br>He didn't equal Meruem in anything but aura and Gon san was his absolute potential, if he trained perfectly for decades. That won't happen, and being the strongest has never been Gon's goal anyway. Being strong has always been a means to an end for him, unlike Luffy wanting to be pirate king.</br>  content yourselves with this in the meantime  <br>And this</br>  <br><br> madhouse isn't pandering to the homos you guise </br></br>    <br>The characters don't call it an adult form of Gon but rather a nen contract.</br>  <br>JoJo is probably one of the most entertaining manga to read. The art is great, and there are situations that you never expect. It can go from lighthearted comedic situations to really dark places, it is also really good a hyping the villains and writing charismatic characters. It's definitely worth reading, but as some anons said, you have to enjoy it as it is.</br>  <br>They don't call it an adult form of Gon, but rather it looks like an adult form of Gon, and they imply it's a state he could have gotten to with ten!? twenty!? years of training.</br>  <br>Togashi likes to fuck with people</br>  <br><br>best part of the adaptation</br></br>  Chimera Arc had some of the best moments of the series, but there's a charm present in all other arcs that was absent and I don't know what. Maybe someone else knows.  <br>happiness</br>  <br>Strong possibility.</br>  <br>It also somehow lacked the exploration and "learning" that the other arcs had.</br>  <br>Fun, adventure, healthy friendships, </br>  <br>Chimera Arc had great moments, but it lacks Hisoka. The best Arc for me would be Yorknew, it has fun moments, friendship, shenanigans, good fights, gritty stuff and charismatic characters all over it. Also, it's not dragged to an extreme like CA is.</br>  <br>Legend of the Galatic Heroes<br><br>Checkmate, pleb.</br></br></br>  <br>LoGH's directing is nothing special, definitely not one of the things that make it so good and well respected. The visuals pretty much just amount to talking heads most of the time.</br>  The To Love Ru Darkness Chapter 57 is out  New Nana chapter fucking when  <br>No. Risa chapter fucking where</br>  So do you guys like Gardens?  <br>They can share the next chapter.</br>  <br>editor kun would never allow it, not sure writer wants to do it, "purity" backlash?, loss of money from cock teasing?</br>  The face just got revealed.<br><br>This nigga bizarre as fuck /a/</br></br>  <br><br>It'd save budget spent on backgrounds!</br></br>  <br>Wing is  fucking boooooooooooooring but it gets better around 30 <br>X is weak but had a nice romance, too much  battle of the week  and  not charismatic at all badguys .</br></br>  We raxpron naw.  <br>okada mari is a great writer and definitely better than urinebullshit.</br>  <br>X had decent villains, they were just overshadowed by those two idiots who wanted to be the strongest newtypes ever.</br>  Way to undo Vegeta's character development.  <br>We all know that. They won't go past the end of the manga</br>  <br> How do you know that? I don't remember their exact age ever being mentioned.  <br>We know Pan is 4 because that's what was told to us<br><br> We know that Pan is in Videl's stomach when Beerus arrives on earth and he will arrive soon. <br> So you're saying that Goku will transform into a SSG without Pan? <br>It's possible that they are changing the timeline around. If the ritual takes place the same way, that means Pan will be in Videl's stomach now instead of 4 years later when BoG took place indicating the timeline is being changed around</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's really sad though. No Pan, no Bra, no teen Goten and Trunks, nothing can happen that contradicts the ending of the manga, i.e. no relevant characters can die, break up or change their attitude and/or appearance too much.</br></br>  <br> - Gohan's Mystic Form <br>When was that forgotten? It was in the movie and in the OP for the new series<br> - You cannot reach the lookout with a plane <br>I believe it was that God would not let you reach the temple by plane but since Dende knows Goku and crew, he lets it happen</br></br></br></br>  <br>there were animal people in Z, but they were a lot less common and most of them showed up early on.</br>  is kill la kill any good ? is it even worth watching ?  <br>Sub only</br>  <br>Best anime for a 16 year old indipendant wymyn to watch.</br>  Its not as good as people are making it out to be. They're just deluding themselves that its good since they bought in to the hype.  <br>It's kinda shit.<br><br>The only thing that made it decent was discussion during it's airing, immediately after it ended all threads were burned to ash by /u/. It's shit, but to be fair it has a much worse reputation than it's worthy of.</br></br></br>  <br>Sub  dub for based Takarada pimp voice </br>  With legs like these, who needs boobs?    <br>please let's make threads every 2, 3 days</br>  feet  I'm still upset at how KyoAni shafted Hazuki.  <br>Obligatory.</br></blockquote>]
