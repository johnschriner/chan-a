If you get outraged about idiots posting it's ok but don't bring that shit here. There's enough of retardation on /a/ without it.</br></br></br></br>  Why do you care what some 14 year old retard says?  <br>Pretty sure he's being satirical/sarcastic and we just don't get it. Nobody can be THAT retarded right, have faith in the human race for once.</br>  This guy's American?<br><br>Is this the next stage in the English language, because I can't understand half the shit he's saying.</br></br>  <br>Not your personal army.<br><br>I don't care about animeaddict2014's opinion.</br></br></br>   build a wall around japan and isolate itself from the world and stop all forms of communication in and out of the country <br>I see nothing wrong with this. What could possibly go wrong?</br>  Fansub meme scene is pretty shit these days though.  funi videos are shittier than camrips. being forced to watching shit like that because fansubbing is dead is painful.   it's the digital age.. everything is streaming now..   <br>Looks like ANN</br>   browsing anything other then 4chan <br><br>How can people do that?</br></br>  <br> is he fucking deluded? <br>Yeah. So? What do you want /a/ to do about it? Fuck off back to the forum, you shouldn't have been browsing there to begin with.</br></br>  <br> What could possibly go wrong? <br>There could be trouble when later some ship arrives and crew tries to play baseball with natives.<br><br><br>You think HS and other non BD/DVD releases aren't streaming?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I sometimes lurk cancer-ridden places like HS comment section and the like to remind myself that the shitposting and post quality here isn't that bad and that our retards are at least better than their retards</br>  <br>Try taking a trip to Batoto's comments threads, they make this place look like a gathering of sages.</br>  <br>they're still normies who don't find normal people repulsive</br>  <br>It's to protect from the titans, obviously.<br><br><br>It is ANN.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying /a/ isn't full of normies nowadays </br>  <br><br>Now it makes sense.</br></br>  <br><br>Retard, Animeaddict2014 knows whats up.</br></br>  <br>That's impossibke , why is anime in 10bit if it has bad quality?<br><br> He's RIGHT </br></br></br>  <br>I don't trust people who leave out apostrophes.</br>  <br>Did he downvoted your precious post?<br>Why do you bring this garbage here?</br></br>  <br>I'm going to search for his account and look at the rest of his "golden" posts.</br>  Shit like this just makes you appreciate /a/ even more.  <br> back then no one cared about fansub <br> but as anime gaining popularity again in the states they are trying to make it illegal <br><br>These two sentences.

This shit goes to /v/, not here.  <br> back then no one cared about fansubs.. <br> animeaddict2014 <br> "2014" <br><br>I really hope he's fucking joking.

This season is shit.  I'm loving that bara-ness of Ushio. If Tora didn't look like he came out of a 90s comic book (and wasn't a furfag, let's be honest) I could see there being plenty of doujins where Tora forcefully 'eats' Ushio. <br><br>Does Tora have a human form and, more importantly, is it cute?</br></br>  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>You're just being picky, anon.</br>   Why can't Rui just be loved tenderly?    <br>We see a man orgasm on-screen and this season is supposed to be shit?</br>  Which Tenkai would you Knight?  <br>Because traps deserve to suffer</br>  <br>None. They look a little underdeveloped.</br>  <br>The only thing missing this season is a decent sport series with qt boys, but other wise we got all tastes filled.</br>  Anyone else start playing this? It's an actual rhythm idol boy game.<br>Some of them are cute.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>IB is best idols</br>  When's HQ coming bach?  <br>That was a surprise.</br>  <br> this face right after while the shower soundclip was still running </br>  <br>I don' have any devices that can play the game.<br><br>Also fuck off to<br/></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  I like how this season continues to omnipander.  Would you let Leo be your tortoise knight?  <br>Watching haremshit for its guys is only going to break your heart, anon. <br> But I'm also enjoying GATE </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br><br>It's a good week.</br></br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Why would you assume I know what that is? <br>Is it an anime or a manga?</br></br>    <br>It's from Aichuu, a mobile rhythm game.</br>  <br>What could have been</br>  <br> that show </br>  <br>Try googling text from the card then,</br>  <br>Then fuck off to </br>   thread turning into /v/ again   <br>That author who does Oreimo doujin better deliver.</br>  <br> dat look <br> dat wet hair <br> dat everything <br>popped a boner</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching it for  adult characters and I love the modern military in a historical or medieval setting theme. One of my favorite anime is Zipang. </br>  <br>I wish that Ghostbusters had more than 1 cute guy in it but I'm also enjoying it.</br>  I've finally figured it out, he's just Mattsundere.  Did /a/ like K? wasn't around when it was airing but it's pretty homo. <br>Here's Green King.</br>  <br>I can't figure out which one is more dominant. He is the boss and has clearly more authority but then again sensei is older.</br>  <br> dem tiger brows </br>  I've never understood these threads.<br>It's satire right.</br>    <br>Is it on google play? I can't find it.</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> dem armpits </br></br>  <br>Just as satirical as waifu threads.<br>Which means it started out as a joke and now people mistakenly believe it's a real thing and okay.</br></br>  <br>The movie was disappointing, but I can't wait for S2. I rewatched it like 3 times.</br>  <br>Its region locked. The bitches on otome general should be able to help you get it though.</br>  <br> Shounen MC with passions outside of sports or food <br>Fucking fresh.</br></br>  <br>Maybe fucking off to /vg/ well help.</br>  <br>Also, nomination for having the most surprise homolust of the season?</br>  <br>Thanks, I'll try. I've been looking for a mobile rhythm game anyway.</br>  <br>Alright.<br>So is this shit limited to 2D. I have no idea how this works.<br>Like how lolicon doesn't translate to 3D at all, can anyone that participates in these threads explain themselves?</br></br></br>  <br> surprise <br>You should read the manga, it's pure bait.</br></br>  <br>The movie felt more like something that should have been an ova instead. Did you understand a lot of the stuff that went on in season 1? The manga has horrible art but reading in explained a lot more stuff by adding in details. It was the Green King that caused all that shit to happen in season 1.</br>  <br>Everyone on this show has brain problems.</br>  <br> So is this shit limited to 2D. <br>This is a given.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 1 reads like a BL manga.</br>  <br> surprise </br>  <br>It's hardly a surprise, though the premise might sound like it's reverse harem. But it barely focuses on the fact MC is a girl and hasn't had romance so far. It's more bros being bros shonen manga.</br>  <br>I did but I don't remember it being this homo.</br>  <br>Does it have a female mc?</br>  <br>The mc is female yes</br>  <br>He's so depraved.</br>  It's time to post your husbando!  <br>Can I post my son instead?</br>  <br>This thread is off to a good start.</br>  <br>Bl needs more diverse art styles</br>  <br>It sure is.</br>  <br>Hmm, looking back he is extremely depraved.  I hope he gets the mob doujins he deserves </br>  <br> fujos <br> watching shoujo  <br>I doubt he'll get anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer is the best time of the year, after all.</br>  <br>Technically it's shounen, but you're probably right anyway.</br>  <br>Who looks exactly like a boy 100% of the time. There are certain implicit leanings here.</br>  <br>That's not shoujo though<br>It's "neo-shonen", aka shonen that most likely still panders to girls(see Kuroshitsuji).</br></br>  <br>Tora is a qt oversized cat, do not sexualize him.</br>  <br>You need to relax. Why don't you lay down right over there.</br>  <br> neo-shonen <br>Why do you have to invent new terms if you can just call it shoujo?<br><br>Monthly GFantasy might as well call itself shoujo since by now 90% of its target audience is girls. <br><br>ffs, Switch, Saiyuki, Pandora Hearts, Nabari no Ou and Kimi to Boku ran in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This show is shit though. Only watching because some anon told me that there will be shota suffering in the future.</br>  <br>Wow sounds like it's demographic is shoujo.</br>  <br><br><br>MC is so fuckin ugly.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks roofied.</br>  <br>Okay. I just hope we at least see more of this delinquent.</br>  <br> Yes he does </br>  <br>So even if you call those shoujo, what does that have to do with  ? G Fantasy's titles are popular among fujoshi.</br>  <br> Ranpo kittan threads are somehow gayer than homothread </br>  Yo homodachi, any of you interested in some typesetting?  <br>Not really. You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos. Besides, he looks a lot cuter in the manga.</br>  <br>Ouran got some doujins back then, they were all terrible but still.</br>  <br>And he is even uglier in the manga.</br>  <br>Why are they so LONG?</br>  <br>I think he's cute</br>  <br> You're just too used to character designs that pander to fujos <br><br>No man, I'm just not blind.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking LONG </br>  <br>This doujin was great.</br>  <br>I think he's really cute.</br>  <br> fujo design <br>He looked like Sousuke on manga cover.</br></br>  <br>Actually in that image he looks fine, if only the rest of the show was drawn that well.</br>  <br>Well, Sousuke is cute.</br>  <br>Wrong Sousuke though.</br>  <br>Then you should've posted who you meant, dumbass.</br>  <br>Everybody knows which Sousuke dumbass.</br>  Myreadingmanga died?  <br>No?</br>  <br>Oh god, CLAMP has a problem.</br>  <br>Because they're not 15</br>  My homo-meter was off the charts this chapter   cutest boy is gone <br><br>Suddenly there is no reason to watch it anymore.</br></br>  <br>nope.</br>   3745HOUSE new doujin out <br><br><br>Uh? Sensei still there.</br></br></br>  <br>That's some weak trolling there, dumbass.</br>  <br>What are you saying, Kaitocchi is still very much present.</br>  <br> cutest boy is gone <br>Something happened to the teacher?</br></br>  <br>Why use it? Basically everything on it is on sadpanda</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus christ get some taste. No wonder everyone is laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some aren't, and I prefer the scroll down format.</br>  Sera-sensei is a tyrant teacher and probably smells like beer and oil.  <br>Still posting worse Sousuke dumbass?</br>  <br>I prefer a guy that smells of blood, sweat, and whiskey.</br>  <br>Is it going to be KarmaxNagisa or NagisaxKayano? I'm personally rooting for  OotaxNagisa .</br>  <br>What an ugly bitch.</br>  <br>Kayano is clearly the manga endgame, but that won't stop me fapping to any good KarmaxNagisa doujins.<br>I really wish we'd get NagisaxKarma sometime too.</br></br>  <br>At least someone is posting a Sousuke dumbass</br>  <br> everything on it is on sadpanda <br><br>A lot of translated manga and doujins aren't. Site is good, if you ignore the terrible layout and users.</br></br></br>  <br>He sure is. Makes him even more moe.</br>  <br> Manlets </br>  <br>You are wasting image limit dumbass.</br>  <br>They also make me smile</br>  <br>And you still haven't posted the Sousuke you were thinking of, dumbass</br>  <br>No, it makes him shit.</br>  <br>Manlets are cute</br>  <br>No need to post the obvious dumbass.</br>  <br><br>Can you faggots fuck off?</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Old post, but am I looking at this wrong? He looks like he has a bustle, or dislocated hip.</br>    <br>Thanks for agreeing that GATE MC is cute.</br>  <br>He means Sousuke from Free. Hence why he quoted the thing about fujo bait. Now both of you can shut up.</br>  <br>And there's this faggot.</br>  <br>Almost forgot about this. I thought they'd reveal Nagare's design in the anime as some sort of surprise and not earlier.</br>  <br>He's as ugly as Sousuke still better than FMP Sousuke though.</br>  Thanks to the anon that mentioned Gakuen Ouji last thread. Shit's crazy. Nobunaga a shit but he has some serious homolust.  <br>So which Sousuke were you thinking of? Because this Sousuke is pretty cute too.</br>  <br> You're welcome! </br>  <br><br>He's wearing a dress. He's just holding side of it out.</br></br>  <br>He's better as a shota.</br>  <br>Already mentioned dumbass.</br>  <br>You haven't posted him yet.</br>  <br><br>Everyone is better as shota duh</br></br>  <br>Most bad boys are.</br>  <br>I thought it was strange too. He has a really cool design though. along with his priest and shota. Sorta wish Munakata didn't beat him to the punch of making Fushimi a clansmen. He would have fit in well with the greens.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>REJOICE</br>  <br>So it WAS Aizen all along!</br>  <br>Deaf moe is cute.</br>  <br>That's some Aizen tier trolling right there.</br>  <br> Kotomine is now the same voice of another Best Priest. </br>  <br>No you're Aizen!</br>  <br>I don't think he's moe but Nic sure is hot.</br>  <br> MFW he speaks. <br><br>I never thought having a speech impediment could be so sexy.</br></br></br>  What do I say to people who think having more than one husbando is perfectly fine?  <br>Call them a slut.</br>  <br>I call them out for the sluts that they are.</br>  <br>You join them.</br>  <br>Tell them not to use words they don't understand.</br>  <br>Leave them to their delusions and then go back to feeding your husbando.</br>  <br>It's perfectly fine.</br>  <br><br>Slut</br></br>  <br><br>You cum guzzling whores.</br></br>  I didn't like this that much but the new cover is so nice I'm tempted to buyfag it.  <br><br>I love cumming in my pure husbandos.</br></br>  <br> husbandos <br>Don't use words you don't understand.</br></br>  <br>I thought I was the only one who didn't like the story. Art's nice though.</br>  <br>Tell them having more than one husbando will ruin their laifusbando.</br>  <br>I love all my husbandos.</br>  <br>Or more than one husbando is a bad endo.</br>  <br>I would've liked it better if Shun hadn't been such a shit. <br>Mio getting character development out of nowhere didn't help either. He lost a lot of charm.</br></br>  The staff really, really likes these guys. This episode had a bunch of anime-original touchy-feely shenanigans. <br>I'm dying to know what they're doing in the pot in the ED since they're facing away from the viewer.</br>  Which sword would you  polish?   <br>The on-topic one.<br><br> Fuck that's lewd. </br></br></br>  <br>Lewd swords are best swords.</br>  <br>The one that belongs in /vg--<br>oh wait your swordshit general is dead because your game fucking sucks.</br></br>  <br>Kill those abominations.</br>  I didn't expect to like this guy as much as I do now. I can't wait for his suffering to begin.  <br>I didn't expect to like any character, or even the show itself, as much as I do. Truly glad I picked it up.</br>  It was  okay.   <br>Same here. Even  imouto  is growing on me.</br>  <br>I like him too, the sol scenes with the teleportation guy and him are great. The whole cast is really nice to watch.</br>  <br>Alright, I'll bite.</br>  <br><br>What's the target audience for this show? I was expecting the two guys to get paired up with the girls but it feels more like the two guys and the two girls are getting paired up among themselves.</br></br>  http://exhentai.org/g/833992/2c2c79<wbr>6cd7/</wbr>  <br>Megane's autism is so endearing.</br>  <br>Might be omnipandering.  I know this isn't the thread for this, and I'm usually no yurifag, but I have to say that the two girls seem cute together. Kind of wish it were real rather than just ED fanservice. <br><br><br> I can't figure out which one is more dominant. <br>I think it's pretty clear, since Kaito barely acts his age and Nagisa pretty much curbstomps his enthusiasm given the slightest chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dropped CG but moeducer was really a gem boy there. Glad he got noticed.</br>  <br>I hope we have time for his backstory.<br><br>By the way, are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones?</br></br></br>  <br>I am, but first I need to learn how.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure, if fujoshi jump on this, Kaito will be the one on top.</br>  <br>I never saw HS for this one so I don't how they compare, but subs for every other HS show have been pretty shitty, so I'm sure these are better.</br>  i waited 3 months to see this moe face again, and i was not disappointed  <br>Is this shit still being translated?</br>  <br> are those subs a marked improvement over the HS ones? <br>I haven't seen CR's script aside from the pastebin with the mistranslations from episode 1, but judging from that I'd call the other option better.</br></br>  <br>That one's the sequel, so no. <br>Someone's typesetting the old one right now, don't know if it's completed yet.</br></br>  <br>Going to buyfag it for the art. I'm probably going to buyfag all her works.</br>  <br> To be honest the suffering was the only reason I picked up the manga.</br>  Please tell me this semen demon shows up again at some point.  <br> Everyone in this story returns at some point. <br>Also Obi is best girl.</br></br>    <br>Here I thought I wouldn't feel the need to watch this show after reading the manga, but I'm almost changing my mind just because of their increased screentime.</br>  I'll post some Kyoani boys from specials who still hot no screen time but was mentioned    Why did I wait so long to start watching this?  <br>If you like the manga enough to stay current, you'll like everything JC Staff is doing with the anime. You have Shouji and Daigo's cheerleading scenes in the election, which I'm sure are going to be embellished, to look forward to as well.</br>  <br>Are any new films or pretty much anything coming out anytime soon?</br>  <br>Is he autistic? I felt really sorry for him. He'll forever exist only in this short, lacking personality, blowing at cats on his window sill. It's almost as if the viewer is a figment of his imagination.</br>  <br><br>I like KnK's designs for boys better.</br></br>  <br> Nakigitsune <br><br>Thanks for the update anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I liked how Kyoani colored the hair in KnK, but my favorite were Hyouka's designs.</br>  <br>You are still on time to sweat together over precious Shokugeki boys.</br>  <br>Kind of wish the series had a couple more guys in it, I still haven't gotten around to watching it because it seems like a lot of yuribait drama.<br><br><br> I think of him as being like a stoner NEET.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The bodies in Shokugeki are deliciously drawn. I had originally dropped it due to lack of time, but I've picked it back the fuck up after seeing all these screencaps.</br>  <br>So I assume you don't know about the new ending</br>  <br> fagotto </br>  <br>I still want Isshiki and Souma to fuck.</br>  <br>It's probably a toss up between the two for me when it comes to character designs. For actual character personalities, though, Hyouka wins for me.  S2 never. ;_; <br><br> "select all ice cream" <br> only gives me pictures of sorbet <br>Goddammit, Google.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>best instrument</br>  <br>I liked how Soma's dad was utterly unfazed by how Isshiki walks around in nothing but an apron. I get the impression Polar Star is like a breeding ground for weirdoes.</br>  <br><br>I want to molest all Kyoani boys.</br></br>  <br>The yuribait is  great  and isolated into a couple scenes. The rest is just regular friendship. <br>The series is plot heavy and drama is always related to the brass band club, save for one episode.</br></br>  <br>Well, despite what Hibike threads said while watching this I hadn't got the feeling there is yuri there or my yuri googles wasn't strong enough to see romance between fem characters, but indeed there was friendship, idolizing and appreciating. <br>Also it is really rare for Kyoani shows but the drama was surprisingly fine and didn't felt like overreacting about stupid things.<br>It was about  having leading solo in competition's performance everybody trained really hard for. </br></br></br>  What's the homoest non homo show you've ever seen?

Something nice and open-ended and easy on the imagination is all I need.</br>  <br>Indeed, hence my nomination of it in 's post.</br>  <br>I keep putting off finishing the manga, it's a shame where the anime left off and best boy couldn't be animated.</br>  <br>I am. I'm weary of being tormented by cowardly writers and studios. After the Aldnoah Zero not-ending, I'm after full-on homo ends now. Being teased is no longer enough.</br>  <br>That hair looks so bad.

More than anything I just want Kagami to stop relentlessly shitting on every aspect of Mika's life and let him be cared for the most by the person he cares for the most in turn. That's the absolute least he deserves for all he's been through.</br>  <br>I think they gave her a few more scenes.

Those outfits were lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I had read a little of the manga beforehand and recall it being a pretty heavy on the female fanservice, so I was a bit surprised when I eventually saw the anime's official art.</br>  <br>Titmonster Hevn was a bit of a smokescreen, but it became pretty apparent early on that she was basically just static noise and every freak and weirdo in town was trying to pry Ban and Ginji apart for their own little agendas and that was going to be the crux of the series: those two vs the world.</br>  <br>I just want to see Ceylan and Guren   hug  </br>  Soon  <br> a microman in a power suit <br>Somehow this triggered my fetish sensors.

If you're looking to meet pretty young women it's a huge advantage. If you're trying to find an apartment or start a business you might be at a disadvantage.</br></br></br>  Someone posted this in the previous thread. Does anyone know where it's from?  <br>Yes. The Japanese are incredibly racist, and they purposefully ostracize anyone whom they believe may be a foreigner. Being white in Japan is to be oppressed, and the Japanese are oppressors.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br>  For those of you that learned Japanese for a manga/LN/VN/anime, did you immediately jump into it after finishing Tae Kim and Core2k or did you start with other materials until you felt you could read fluidly?  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/view/bizq3<wbr>79k4oeig2d/fora.pdf<br><br>Here you go my freund.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>ありがとうございました!</br>  <br>Started reading Yotsuba and playing Wizardry Summoner with 500 words into 2k, before finishing tae kim, didn't have much problems with them. <br>Problems with the language, I mean, Wizardry is hard as fuck to beat.<br><br>I don't see how it's even possible to become able to read fluidly without spending some time reading first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this how it feels to be a nigger going to Europe?</br>  <br>I haven't finished reading Tae Kim and I'm only about 700 cards into my anki deck yet I'm slowly reading an  otome game . Reading at this low level can become time-consuming for sure. There's plenty of vocab I don't know but I think the real frustrating part is my lack of grammar knowledge. I don't believe in waiting to read though. Even if it's only a little bit of reading a day, seeing kanji and vocab outside of anki does better for my memory than spending an additional hour with it.</br>  みんな、突然だけど<br>うんこが出たんだぞ</br>  <br>乙</br>  <br>How many lines are you reading a day?</br>  <br>This is what we call true shitto posutingu</br>  What does エッチそうだと噂されている mean when talking about a person?  Is it a good idea to learn Japanese in university? Anyone of you guys have a Japanese class?  <br><br>The prevailing opinion is that they go far too slow</br></br>  <br> From what I'm hearing, he seems like a perverted individual </br>  <br>Learning in class usually goes at the same pace the stupidest/laziest person can go, so unless the stupidest student is you it's a bad idea.</br>  <br>I was looking at some of the modules in a University near me and what they teach in a full semester you could learn much quicker by yourself. Advantage is having a wide variety of people to practice with and lots of feedback though.</br>  <br>What people have already said plus the fact that first semester Japanese classes are full of insufferable weeaboos.</br>  <br> what they teach in a full semester you could learn much quicker by yourself <br> quicker by yourself <br>That is, if you're motivated enough.<br><br>You can learn all you want by yourself, but you need to means of retaining what is self-taught.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to add to this question<br><br>I've been studying for a year and once I get my two year would majoring in Japanese be a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>It's inconsistent, but usually between 50 and 200 lines. I space them throughout the day because otherwise it quickly becomes mentally exhausting.</br>  <br>What are you talking about?<br>How are the means to retain something that was self taught different than the means to retain something taught in class?</br></br>  Holy fuck VNR is a piece of shit. Why can't ITH hook light games?  <br> 200 lines <br>That's nothing. Do you look up every unfamiliar word or something? Consider reading manga with furigana until you know enough kanji to read VNs without constantly looking shit up, improves reading without putting much strain on you.</br></br>  <br>Is majoring in drama a good idea?</br>  <br>Its a good way to start off or for getting some practice with speaking/writing. If you need language credits or electives then it might be a good idea since its time you can dedicate to learning Japanese instead of some other thing. The pace will mostly depend on how many class hours there are in a week.</br>  <br>Not him, but is reading something  super interesting with furigana like To Love-Ru  as a first manga a good idea? Or are there any simple manga that don't have much slang/abbreviations?</br>  <br>Every manga has slang/abbreviations but there really aren't that many of them and they are pretty intuitive if you know your Tae Kim.</br>  <br>It isn't even the kanji. There are probably two per line on average that I don't recognize. When I don't recognize them, image recognition can pull them up in a second. What I struggle with wrapping my head around is grammar. <br><br>Thanks, though. I will take your advice and read some manga for the next few days and see if that suits me better.</br></br></br>  <br>Good idea for what? <br>If you expect your major to impress 3DPD girls, make your parents proud and make you rich then nope.<br><br><br>Most shonen jump manga is pretty simple, but people recommend よつばと！as a first for a reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What I struggle with wrapping my head around is grammar.  <br>Are you struggling with understanding the meaning of sentences? Or just understanding why X structure was used and other more detailed things?<br><br>Because if it's the latter, you should really just loosen up and focus on reading more. Nothing good will come from spending hours trying to figure out why the moe girl sticks なのよねです at the end of every sentences.</br></br></br></br>  is there any hope for people who read 3 lines a day?  <br>No.</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>It's a little of both. I said earlier that I haven't finished reading Tae Kim and I know that's a big part of why I struggle with grammar. However, I don't feel like I'm doing enough if I don't read a little. I don't think I'll reap any real benefits by speed-reading Tae Kim and I already know what my anki limits are, so after I've met my daily goals for those I feel like I should be doing something else.</br>  <br>The university near me teaches Genki practically throughout the whole Japanese course.</br>  <br>You can try to hope that reincarnation exists and you'll be reborn as a Japanese girl in your next life. But even then you'll have to read more than 3 lines a day as a Japanese girl.</br>  N5 - beginner<br>N4 - intermediate<br>N3 - advanced, but not quite fluent<br>N2 - fluent<br>N1 - beyond fluent</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only hope is that you stop being someone who reads 3 lines a day.</br>  Where do I go download raws for manga that aren't in the CoR?<br>I assume there isn't any big site that hosts everything like we have for translations</br>  <br>how many should i read then?</br>  <br><br>Uh... N1 is more like "almost fluent." So your whole chart is fucked up.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>I've passed N1 years ago, learned a lot since then, and I don't consider myself anywhere near fluent.</br></br>  <br>Even anime have more than 200 lines</br>  Are there situations where the imperfective forms of verbs are used like nouns?  <br>That's because you learned autistically and didn't talk to anyone. Normal people are fluent by the time they reach N2</br>  <br><br>Nyaa? http://raw-zip.com/? http://raw.senmanga.com/? Just google whatever you're looking for and see what you can find.</br></br>  <br>so should i just read 200 lines per day?</br>  <br><br>Just stop. Even the JLPT considers N1 "near fluent."</br></br>  <br> Even the JLPT considers N1 "near fluent." <br>Just making stuff up now, eh?</br></br>  <br>I guess if you could actually speak at N1 level you could consider yourself somewhat fluent. Of course just passing the test means nothing.<br>N2 is a joke though.</br></br>  <br>Did that guy post that here?<br>What a dumbass.</br></br>  <br><br>How's the weather on Mt.

He's fluent, too.<br><br>Fluency isn't the point where you're on par with an educated adult. It's the point where you can express yourself in a conversation freely and coherently. This means that if you don't know the word, you can still describe the concept, or understand the concept when it's described to you.<br><br>6K words is probably just about the breaking point, assuming that they're the right 6K.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes. What most people refer to as "fluency" is actually called "proficiency".</br>  <br>Get lazy. Looking shit up is such a pain I never do it, unless I see an unfamiliar kanji.</br>  <br> That poster gave you very good advice, how about you listen to it? <br>Not him but how?

There's also variation in which approximant it is (retroflex vs alveolar vs postalveolar).</br></br>  <br><br>They speak that way because of their Scottish accent. If you've ever heard Scottish Gaelic, you'd know they roll their Rs.<br><br>Also, fuck your bullshit. You know damn well Rs are the same in Australia as they are in New Hampshire, you're just being a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically speaking, we don't make し, ち, and じ either. Linguistically, they are a different type of sh, ch, j than English's.</br>  <br> You know damn well Rs are the same in Australia as they are in New Hampshire, you're just being a retard. <br>The new hampshire accent doesn't labialize, so no, they're not the same.</br></br>  <br>I never said to outright skip things, just don't waste time looking things up. Infer parts you didn't get from context.</br>  <br>but what if youre wrong? and you miss out on something really important/cool?</br>  Guys, what does もっと知識を身につけていずれは... mean?  <br>You need to fail in order to learn.</br>  <br> but what if youre wrong? <br>Then you're wrong. Happens all the time and doesn't matter much.<br> and you miss out on something really important/cool? <br>That is very unlikely, especially with manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what kind of shitty advice is that? I need to not understand to understand? im just reinforcing bad habits</br>  <br>He just said to learn from your mistakes.</br>  <br> im just reinforcing bad habits <br>Yeah, just like when you were a kid and never understood what people were saying, right?<br><br>(no)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea it is really useful.</br>  <br><br> the "this is how kids learn" bullshit <br><br>So, five years to be on par with a five year old, and 12-15 years to reach an adolescent's ability with the language? Sounds great.<br><br>Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. Piggy piggy ohio arimas.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you are that good like the imabi guy why would you feel intimidated at all?</br>  <br> Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. Piggy piggy ohio arimas. <br><br>Then you're not going to get any bad habits that a kid doesn't get either.<br><br>Matter of fact is that looking up everything you don't understand is going to waste time. It's more effective to continue and only acquire the things you barely understand (as opposed to not understand at all). There's no harm in studying grammar separately, but looking up things you don't understand while you're reading cuts into your reading time, and consuming things that you barely understand is how language learning works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. <br>Yeah, it's even better because kids are dumb, lack experience and can't read.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh my, piggy jiggy jig.</br></br>  <br>Actually, language is acquired by consuming things that you pretty much understand. There can only be a few missing parts; otherwise, you can't infer anything, and it might as well be gibberish, so if there's too little content for you to be able to infer, then you've got to be looking things up.</br>  <br><br>What the other anon said.<br><br>In your native tongue, you've been building up massive amounts of knowledge and intuition since you came out of the womb. That's why you don't need a dictionary for those ten words in the novel that you don't recognize. You know enough about the language already to fully understand from context.<br><br>Hell, even in your own language, if you're entering something completely unfamiliar (for example, a scientific study in a field that you know nothing about), you might need a dictionary open if you don't want the author's writings to be half gibberish.<br><br>Until you've gained this knowledge base that enables intuition in the language for Japanese, it's stupid to not look up each and every word that you don't know.<br><br>Thankfully, we have plenty of tools that make looking up Japanese words pretty easy. Text hookers, rikai, kanjitomo, etc. And failing that, we still have traditional dictionaries and means to draw the kanji or search by radical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Droidfags do you use the hiragana numpad or the QWERTY keyboard?  <br> In your native tongue, you've been building up massive amounts of knowledge and intuition since you came out of the womb. <br>That intuition doesn't just vanish when you read something in another language, though, and you can use most of it to figure things out. Of course with Japanese things are a bit harder and you have to know your kanji, but once you know them you need a dictionary even less since they give you even more hints about the meaning of the word. <br>If you just look up every unfamiliar word you encounter you wouldn't get much reading, and forget most of the words you looked up right away.</br></br></br>  I was doing RTK, and I got to 説, which Heisig marked as "explanation". But the anki deck I'm using shows 釈 as "explanation. I checked and 釈 does mean explanation, and 説 means opinon/theoryrumor. Heisig calls 釈 "interpretation" later in the book. <br>Should study the definitions as they are in RTK or should I change something?</br>  <br>That's why you should drop Heisig earlier on.</br>    <br> stories are worthless shit <br> only teaches you the meaning, not even how to fucking read the kanji <br> and the meanings are wrong <br> mfw people actually went through the entirety of this book <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should study the definitions as they are in RTK or should I change something? <br>The goal is learning the idea behind the kanji, not the english word that represents that idea.<br>It's easier to tie meanings to readings, though, shame RTK doesn't do that,</br></br></br>    <br> definitions <br> in RTK <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>But meanings don't tie to readings, radicals do.</br>  <br> But meanings don't tie to readings <br>Who said that? In my head I can tie whatever the fuck I want.</br></br>  <br>Explanation can be a valid idea/meaning associated with 説. See 説明</br>  <br><br>Look up some of the words they are in to get a feel for them. 解説 and 解釈 might be good since they share a Kanji. 説明 and 演説 are also key words. That said if you don't know those Kanji/words this gets a hell of a lot harder, which I don't really have a solution for. It's hellish at the start.<br><br>The closest to explain I can think of for 釈 is 釈明. Much like "explain how this works" and "explain your conduct", they're different kinds of "explain".<br><br>Sorry if I get anything wrong/seem like I'm just dumping shit on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unnatural as helll but if it helps you remember the kanji, be my guest.</br>  <br><br>Sure, it does transfer to some degree. You don't lose all human communication skills. That's probably around half of why you learn so much quicker as an adult.<br><br>However, a large piece of this intuition comes from a deep understanding of the grammar and knowing all of the nuances of each of the other words around the unknown word. When you first begin studying a new language, the language will be in a haze.<br><br> Huh? That doesn't match what I was expecting at all. <br> What is this even supposed to be? <br> Did I just understand that right? <br> Is this a slurring of a word that I don't know? <br> Is this some kind of weird phrase? <br><br>Your knowledge of human communication gets the cogs turning, but it's not enough to compensate for a poor base in the hard skills (such as vocabulary) of the language. This haze continues to exist for a long time.<br><br>Looking up the words makes it exponentially quicker to grasp vocabulary. The sooner you get your vocabulary up to snuff, the sooner you can make it easier to access, and subsequently, the sooner you can remove this haze in more cases than not. This goes double if you're at a point where looking things up would slow you down significantly.<br><br>Also, you mentioned kids learning the language earlier. Do you honestly not remember the days of "What's a 'radio mast', dad?", "What's an 'ICU'?", "What's a 'manhole'?" Also, have you never seen kids ask such questions? Kids are also always looking to greater sources of knowledge to explain the language to them. Actually, this behavior doesn't even completely stop as adults, as in the example of science studies that I mentioned before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 釈明 <br>"justify", "vindicate", "elucidate"</br></br>  <br><br> 釈明 <br>"(an) explanation", "(an) apology (わび)", (a) vindication (弁明)"<br><br>Well, yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  I understand the conversation but I'm having trouble figuring out what the 帰ろっか、てくー、and ないっけー　are doing in this panel.

Gives you a lot of freedom in terms of career between marketing/diplomacy/political but more importantly translating/interpreting (job opportunity, I think the most important part of a degree). It will be useful even if you don't want to work in Japanese and it is just an informative degree. I had more relevant classes in IR than I did in CIS.<br><br>Also realistically you can expect 45K starting with no experience as an interpreter.<br> Get your degree <br> Pass the JLPT N1 <br> Consider passing the BJT (it should help but I haven't felt any benefits from it and literally not a single job has put it down in their requirements [JLPT N2/N1 is more common]) <br> Pass the interpreter test <br> Apply <br><br>If you can apply for a position that flies you around the word that is ideal.

Think of how many people in Japan speak both English and Japanese, and likewise with Asian neighborhoods in the west.

Do people really believe it takes even 3000 hours to reach N1, let alone, 8000? According to the US government reaching fluency (which is more than N1, obviously) in Japanese requires about 2400 hours of study, and I think they would know best.</br>  <br>They are trying to trick you into thinking you can learn Japanese.</br>  <br>Kanji's relationship with words is much like latin to english words<br>If you see anti-dis-esta-blish-ment-arian-ism,<wbr> you don't learn the whole word, you learn the parts that make up the word and recognize the word as a set of parts. Kanji are equivalent to those parts.<br><br>But it's not worth learning what 20 different bound stems mean every day, especially because they mean slightly different things depending on context and have different semantic properties.<br><br>So, when you see a word that's made of one kanji, you memorize the word. And when you see a word that's made of multiple kanji, you split it up into parts. If you see 英国国教会, you don't memorize 英国国教会, you memorize "英国 = britain" "国 = country" "教会 = church" "英国＋国＋教会 = &lt;britain&gt; &lt;national&gt; &lt;church&gt;"</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>The US government uses intensive combination-teaching-method teaching programs in the context of those values.</br>  <br>Are there any cases where kanji are used purely for their phonetic value, or where one unanalyzable word is written with multiple kanji?</br>  <br>At first I read this as<br> intensive combat-teaching-methods <br>which might be really effective.</br></br></br>  <br>  According to the US government reaching fluency (which is more than N1, obviously) in Japanese requires about 2400 hours of study <br><br>No, it is not more than N1. Despite the original post being a troll, this post  is correct. Most people who go to Japan are fluent long before they are N1, often before they are N2. N1 is certainly well below native level in terms of the skills it tests, but the skills it tests are also fairly removed from actual fluency.</br></br></br>  <br>Also, the US government tests "proficiency" so I don't know where you got fluency from.</br>  <br> Are there any cases where kanji are used purely for their phonetic value <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ateji<wbr></wbr></br></br>  How difficult is steins gate for a novice? <br>I really want to solidify my grammar.</br>  <br>Define "novice."

A good reader knows his particles, will have a decent amount of active vocabulary, and will be able to recall his relatively impressive library of passive vocabulary with a bit of patience. Incidentally, writing is probably the perfect place to handle this conversion, since you don't have someone standing in front of you waiting for you to speak.<br><br>If you think that you're good at reading but can't even begin to form coherent sentences, you either have a very low standard for what qualifies as "good", or you're overestimating your abilities.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but I have the same problem. <br>I sometimes think up random sentences in Japanese, but I'm never sure if they're correct.

It's cute and all that everything went fine with sprinkles on top but it sure as shit wasn't a good idea. <br><br> Her daughter is best girl in LN </br></br></br>  Adlet Mayer looks like a genderbent monotailed Tailred.  <br>You need to be from a known studio/author and actually advertised if you want to sell</br>  <br> genderbent </br>  <br> it sure as shit wasn't a good idea. <br>I'm not implying the opposite, I'd even go to call it an asspull, but it worked in the end.</br></br>  So, this show is basically the prequel to BlazBlue, right?  <br>The CG outsourced to Orange, go blame them.</br>  Episode 3 15 mins to go<br>Douyu.</br>  5 mins <br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  http://dec.2chan.net/b/res/12004920<wbr>.htm</wbr>  <br>So what happens today? Is it fighting or love antics or exploration or</br>        what rune is this      <br>That puzzle game</br>    <br>Because the first episode was pretty terrible and the second was just alright. People will buy it if its good, but its not at least so far.</br>    Aoi Yuuki makes my ears happy.  <br>The first episode was quite better than the second.</br>  So, how much QUALITY was there?  <br>Shame she's voicing a shit.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>Hey, my bad if you're a fan of hers.<br><br>I just find her very annoying</br></br></br>  <br>Way better than episode 2</br>  <br>That's general consensus but I don't really agree.</br>  <br>Mata Nui runes.</br>  <br>Shit voice for shit girl</br>  This pacing man<br><br>I can't imagine how slow the investigating part would be</br></br>  Please do not bully Fremy.  <br>I bet they will spend whole episode 5 for the first time discussion of seventh.</br>  <br>People complain when adaptation is going too fast, then they complain its going too slow. Okay.</br>  <br>Yeah there were quite a few wideshots of characters that looked really bad in episode 2, I hope the art quality stabilizes but it's not a good sign.</br>  <br>People have no idea what they're talking about, anon. All of this is bullshit nonsense. It's just electrical impulses uploading noise into the global consciousness.</br>  This is animation director list of episode 2  <br>And this is episode 3's list<br>I guess episode 2 had some huge delay compare to episode 1 and 3, so have big quality drop</br></br>  <br>I know who the traitor is  Rabbit <br>I know who the married woman is (obviously Blue)<br><br>What about the other two? For some reason I thought Green was a shota.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Damn, Shirobako pretty much nailed this shit show of an industry didn't they</br></br>  This week episode ended in chapter 1, subchapter 4 of volume 1.<br>After eyepatch and strongest hero meet he convices her and decide to join the others.<br>They meet a fellow soldier that tells them that some heroes are up ahead and that theres a barrier they can summon that impedes the monsters from coming inside.<br>For some reason while on their way monsters start dropping grenades and the party of bunny, goldaf, fremmy, and adlet have to fight and somehow check if the barrier activator is intact.<br>Someone suddenly activates the by itself (its a sword, if you move it it activates) and they are all locked inside the barrier. <br>They all think adlet is the traitor since he was the only one there.<br>Bunny doesnt believe it because she was the one who moved it with her shit sword powers (theory) and seems to like adlet.<br>Bunny is collaborating with a kyoma called dozzu who tells her that he wants to shapr the world to his liking, and she agrees as long as shes part of it.<br>While locked hans and adlet fight and then became bros.<br>Chamo is a bitch and decided to fight both pf them after bonding but later gets owned.<br>Theres another girl that has big tits and a cow armor called rolenia, she has blood powers.<br>So far in the ln there are 4 possible traitors , there are 2 voluntary and 2 involuntary. The two working for dozzu are bummy and goldolf (hes just in because he loves bunny), and the other party is tgurneu, the real evil guy who destroyed adlet village and killed everyone, hes manipulating mora with a hostsge and nips are implying that the other one is adlet because theres a scene when they meet and theres some implied brainwashing (but thats only subjective since adlet wants to avenge his people), also another theory is rolonia the new girl. Also Dozzu is a demon girl that sometimes possesses bunny if she lets him too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> adaptation fast as fuck and thus people complain because rush <br> slow as fuck adaptation and people complain because slow <br><br>could this mean that a good pacing can neither bee too fast or too slow? who could have imagined?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Can we just, just pull that thin strip on her chest. Just one pull.<br>JUST<br>ONE<br>FUCKING<br>PULL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Last week's episode*</br></br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about spoilers. Get rekt anon.</br>  <br>I'm not sure volume 2's ending is a good ending point for this show.<br><br>Actually, seems none of any volumes have a good ending point for anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, because the problems aren't even half way solved yet, too much stalling.<br>This are the people who created rail wars, so expect this to be a novel advertisement.</br></br>  <br>tell me this is a troll post plz</br>  Subs are out  I think this will end at the part when Bunny leaves the team, anyone agree?  Big spoiler:  Adlet is later controlled by one of the kyoma commanders with the help of a spell without him realizing it. <br><br> The person controlling him is <br> ___________________________________<wbr>___________________________________<wbr>___________________________________<wbr>________________________________the<wbr> one who killed his village____________________________<wbr>______</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br></br>  I don't understand her motivations to betray everyone in the novel. I don't know if she was sweet talked into joining by the kyoma or what, it never explains it. Also I don't understand if she likes or doesn't give a fuck about adlet, shit is very ambiguos, or just shit translations.  NOTHING HAPPENED - THE EPISODE  <br>That megen kekkai thing is very important part for later episodes.</br>  Why is HS simply ignoring their official names?<br>Seriously, Flamie is so fucking retarded.</br>  <br>You mean  Nashetania /Dozzu?<br> She betrayed them and the demons as well because she wants to make peace instead of this repeated killing circle. And for that purpose, the heroes aren't supposed to kill the boss. </br></br>  <br>Jesus, did he spent 30 minutes writing this letter?</br>   Phlegmy Speedraw   <br>Maybe they are translating from the script and not look at the official sources on the names the nipps uses?</br>  <br>Implying demon dog won't give her ideas and disappoint her, and try to create a chaotic world that pleases him, and isn't just using bunny because she's a retard.</br>  <br>She doesn't give a fuck about Adlet. Only one she gives a fuck about is Goldof and with him it's more using and abusing him.</br>  <br>Does Goldolf ever stop being beta?</br>  <br>Better question is why do people keeping thinking HS sub things? They rip from CR, Funi and Daisuki. <br><br>So your question should actually be:<br>Why is Crunchyroll simply ignoring their official names?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole anime will be talking, talking talking, trying to kill each other while talking, running, a bit of trying to kill each other while talking again, then, guess what, talking, and finally, talking.</br>  So when does guns get the strongest dick?  <br>No, enjoy him and his muh hime-sama personality all the way</br>  <br>I don't mind talking, but fuck, at least make it interesting.<br>I enjoyed stuff like Liar's Game, and that's mostly talk, but they make the talk interesting, not this bland.</br></br>  <br>Well after saving her in volume 3 and the discussion afterwards when the heroes made an alliance with Nasch and the dog, he made it clear he doesn't give a fuck about her ambition and is on the heroes side.<br><br>But her life is most important.</br></br></br>  This is selling well in Japan, why the dead thread though?  <br>Thats not true. He's only "muh hime's safety". He's against her and Dozzu's ambitions as he stated in volume 4 and is on the heroes side.</br>  <br>May be for the best. The action choreography can look somewhat lame at times.<br><br>And Nashetania is apparently only competent off-screen, and jobs to grunts at any other time.</br></br></br>  You know, I was really judgemental of the first episode and made some pretty harsh critique of the show. However, two episodes later, I think this is actually pretty good, forgetting the terrible CGI for a moment. I thought it's going to be a generic fantasy shounen story, but it turned out way better than I expected. It's a bit discouraging that the sales are not doing great at the moment, but hopefully that changes in the future.  <br>Well hopefully the Adlet vs Hans and Hans + Adlet vs Chamo would have good choreography. Most of the episodes would definitely be talk talk talk though</br>  <br>Fremy best girl so far</br>  Okay, I'll admit I laughed.  https://d.maxfile.ro/jwjkfomdlv.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>This man is too fucking based.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I'm really not used to my kuuderes being this lewd.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br>Infinitely better than bunny whore. This is not debatable.</br>   Nachentanya almost killed both of them <br><br>She really doesnt give a fuck does she?</br></br>  <br>Yep. She plays with people then discards them.</br>  <br>Based director or whoever storyboarded that. It got a good giggle out of me.</br>    OP is mediocre but fuck is the ED for this show is great.   they haven't separated the peninsula with a canal for good   We all know who Adlet would choose.  <br>They'd probably be swarmed with flying fiends or something. Then they'd be sitting around their continent like chumps with no way to counter-attack unless they build up a sizable navy.</br>  <br> I enjoyed stuff like Liar's Game <br>the problem is just your shit taste.</br></br>  <br>But Fremy's a splendid conversationalist. She has at least three variations of "Leave me alone" and "The other heroes will try to kill me."</br>  Certainly a prolonged episode this time, yeah.  Remember when Adlet and Fremie are talking about Tgurneu and Adlet mentions that Tgurneu is only recorded in one chronicle of the first war and he's only recorded as a mook there. I still wonder whether this is going to be relevant. It sounds too specific to be unimportant.  <br> liars game  <br> shit-taste <br><br>You're wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the more the tsun gets highlighted, the better the dere will be.</br>  <br>Grenadier Mushibugyo is best girl.</br>  <br>Spoiler your text  If I remember correctly Tgurnu can control monsters, that Tgurnu the past heroes saw wasn't the real one </br>  Dark blue = waifu  <br>I know that,  the problem is that the knowledge of him being recorded by only one chronicle was irrelevant to Adlet realizing the truth about his power. Another problem is that fiends which are being controlled are supposed to be very strong, so wouldn't the fiend he controlled be strong enough to be mentioned? It certainly doesn't sound like he would just be a common mook that posed no problem and went ignored by everyone.   These things make me believe that the information was simply a red herring or it will be relevant in the future. I doubt it was a red herring though, as the problems I posed still remain.</br>  <br>Did you even read the LN? It's not that hard to compare considering what the rest have done. Also Aoi.Y.</br>  <br>don't post such a lovely face without warning</br>    <br>That won't stop the majin from raping humanity but yeah the Kyouma should have separated it and isolated the island for maximum fuck you</br>  Are her bunny ears real, are they fleshy? Or is it her hair? Or hair accessory?  Adlet and Fremy love when!?    <br> hair accessory </br>   haven't read the source material <br>Is it just me, or is Nashetania fake as hell? She seems like she could be a traitor just because she's the most blatantly two-faced character. <br> that OP  <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>you know what i mean</br>  <br>I wasn't mocking you, I was quoting the correct answer.</br>    <br>that is a lot of hair</br>  Im reading volume 3 and holy fucking shit is Goldof OP in his "save/protect muh hime" mode. This is just fucking ridiculous, he is way too strong.<br><br>Am I the only one who was weirded out by how strong the writer made him in this volume? <br><br>Don't get me wrong, I actually like Goldof.</br></br></br></br>  The best anime always have dead threads, fuck /a/ and their shit taste.  <br>So only Fremy.<br>What about bunny.I've seen some ppl talking that even tho she's a traitor she still likes him??</br></br>  Do people still think this show is slow? I don't understand their complaints at all. This episode had two fight scenes. It feels like a really solid pace.  <br>bunny never liked him romantically.</br>  Bun isn't a virgin is she?  <br>I don't see why she wouldn't be one.</br>  I's there even gonna be some romance things at all in the ln or what?  <br>We'll never find out unless we read the ln.</br>  <br><br>Those character designs look like they came straight from the OC Donotsteel section of Deviantart</br></br>  <br>Akagami is a generic self-insert shoujo show.</br>  <br>You're on the right track</br>  <br>It is a tad on the slow side. Generally we'd have been introduced to all the characters by now in any other show. I'm not saying it's bad though. I like that they're not racing through a volume in 2 or 3 eps.</br>  <br> Does /a/ not like this anime? <br>ESL LNfags shitposting spoilers that are half incorrect from animesuki tends to put some people off from joining in on threads.</br></br>  How old is Mora? 36?  <br>something like that.</br>  <br>Akagami isn't reeinventing anything but it looks lovely and the characters are all enjoyable. Sometimes a very well executed rendition of standard elements can be fun.</br>  <br>I have heard no.</br>  how is she aiming...?  <br>Problem?</br>  <br>He's basically the warrior of the party, high physical stats and low mental while the other 2 guys are more balanced out</br>  <br>I'm convinced she's using her powers to guide her bullets. Guns thirty years after their creation weren't precise enough to aim at all.</br>  <br>It was also funny for me anon.</br>  <br>He's not the strongest cuck in the world for nothing.</br>  <br>Jesus christ.<br><br>Mods ban your cancer and you go around posting that shit in every thread.<br>Nobody cares about your stalker shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thin cloth?<br>Many cosplayers who have eyepatches as part of the character will have it made of thin fabric so they can see. Could be used to protect her aiming eye if someone threw dirt at it.</br></br>  <br> She sees your dick </br>  <br>That's implying he had a chance with Bunny.</br>  <br>But the ones complaining about pacing are kids that prefer SnK and cool fightan anime. <br><br>The pacing is perfect, if they don't explain the barrier now or they don't give a fuck about characters like Fremy then it will suck later on</br></br></br>  <br>If we went by that logic, then SAO is a good anime. Sure, is about masturbating over a power fantasy, being the best and drowning in chicks. Sure there will not be anything noteworthy, nothing to be gained, but it looks good...............<br><br>Please, no. Is more pollution to the already polluted industry. Is mass produced generic work, is okay as long as you do not pretend it to be anything more.</br></br></br>  <br>Can anyone tell me if this is going to be split cour?<br><br>There are TWO openings and THREE endings announced. <br>I mean I'm not a genius but three endings unless you're going for split cour is kinda excessive isn't it? <br><br>Even more considering Passione is not a rich studio and i'm sure they can't aford to spend that much on useless shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with SAO isn't that it didn't invent anything new or that it was generic, it's that the plot is terrible, the pacing makes no sense, and the characters are retarded.</br>  <br>Shirayukihime is really a basic self-insert Shojo like the other anon said. <br>I mean I read 20 chapters of the manga and it's just... Not what /a/ said it was. There's nothing new in it, the MCs are boring and as generic as possible, there's no comedy or if there is it's just terrible. <br>You could finish it in 1 volume and nothing of value would be lost. <br><br> inb4 ... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Goldof <br> Beta <br>What? Goldof is manly as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>   on heros side <br>   tells them flat out that he will kill them if they do anything to muh traitorus hime <br><br>Retard goldof apologists need to go</br></br></br></br>  This episode felt like it lasted for only 10 minutes.  <br>More like<br>Akagami No Shirayukihime = Extremely overrated</br></br>  <br>It airs at the same time with Shimoneta so not even. Also, spoilers and fedora fags made it terrible to even thought of picking this up.<br><br>Maybe when the season is over I will watch it and maybe read the LN, too.</br></br></br>  <br>He has always been that strong though. In terms of pure strength he is the third strongest behind Chamo and Hans, if Nash is in danger he is prolly stronger than Hans.</br>  <br>The opening is all about the heroes heroically heroing. A switch in the opening once the show becomes a whodunnit is to be expected.<br><br>One change in the ending would therefore also make sense. Two changes is stranger, but a one-off special ending could be used.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I only know that Aoi Yuuki/Fremy will sing one of the EDs.</br></br>  <br> tsk, the shit i put up with </br>  <br>This sperm specialist is the only reason this show is worth watching, just like that gothic lolita is the only reason to watch GATE (elves don't count).<br><br>I wish I could pick all the best characters and put them all in the same show.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you take that show if the catch was a harem show with the shittest male MC ever created?</br>  <br>So that's who she reminded me of.<br>Those white bushy eyelashes looked so damn familiar.</br></br>  <br>There are already plenty of pathetic mc in harem shows. This one at least is full of himself which can also be annoying but I take that over the other which already saw a lot.</br>  <br>With all the best girls? Probably. Best to have one bad show than five.</br>  <br>Definitely, except I'd take Kobayashi Yuu from CC and the goth loli from Gate. I love haremshit so I'd be much happier watching that than Gate and CC, especially if Diomedia was making it.</br>  So does MC finally get beat or is he going to be a bigger Gary Stu than Blank?  holy SHIT this episode was slow. Also I don't know how Adlet resists molesting her.  <br>Well obviously, Nash's safety is most important. Which is what I said in the post you quoted.<br><br>He straight up said that he's against her and Dozzu in volume 4 in the discussion where they were forming an alliance.<br><br>Goldof haters are the worst in these threads. By far.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck Nashetania.  <br><br>bunny a best</br></br>  <br>I wanna  kill  Bunny and  fuck  Fremy</br>  <br>Correct.</br>  <br>Fuck, all it would take is just one tug.</br>  <br>To see her eye?</br>   random action scene in the first 5 minutes <br> 15 minutes of exposition <br> set up for next episode's random action scene <br> repeat <br><br>every single episode<br><br>I honestly don't know why I didn't drop this yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because of Fremy</br>  <br>Webm plz?</br>  <br>Y-yeah her eye.</br>  <br>Just drop it anon. <br><br>ADHD can't into not fightan anime</br></br></br>  <br>I will finish this for her.</br>  <br>If episode 4 has 15 minutes of exposition after they finish this fight I will. I think this show could be quite enjoyable if stuff happened.<br><br>Kinda weird seeing a 12 episode show being this slow.</br></br></br>  <br>They'll fight a bit against some monsters and then the other Heroes will be introduced.<br><br>It will probably end when Hans arrives and they realize there's 7</br></br></br>  <br>And then the next two episodes will be nothing but action and the strongest man being the strongest man</br>  <br>Will the episodes stop being 75% exposition + random action scene then? Also, is the source material like that as well?<br><br> I want to enjoy this for some reason </br></br></br>  <br>It has fights of course, there's the Adlet open season coming up.<br><br>But mostly is about mistery and shenanigans. It's not a fightan series</br></br></br>  Does the MC ever stop commenting on how he's THE STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD at some point? It was just a barely tolerable thing at first, but it's swiftly declined from that into unbearable levels.  <br>But he is.</br>  <br>No. He will keep on saying it. The same way he will keep on laughing.<br><br>I honestly don't get why fags get mad about him saying it</br></br></br>  <br>Just fuck off</br>  <br>I'm not a fan of catchphrases and people being repetitive.</br>  <br>Because they can't deal with not being the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br><br>Do you really not realize he says it because he needs to keep believing in himself?</br></br>  How shit are the LN translations?  <br>There's so much exposition during the episodes that my brain just shuts off after a while.</br>  <br>They're  Why don't you find out for yourself  tier</br>  <br>That bad, huh?</br>  Well that was fast. I like her more than the bunny princess too.  <br> And anons say ADHD is just a meme on /a/ </br>  Why is she so perfect?  <br>The first thing he says when he sees her is that she's beautiful</br>  <br>If it was good worldbuilding I'd be all eyes and ears for what's going on, but that's not what I'm getting with this, anon. If you think long, boring explanations in regards to what's occurring is preferable to showing us shit then I've no idea what you like.<br><br> I'm aware they've decided to take the slow route, but this is molasses. </br></br></br>  <br>You realize this is all about those little things right? The fact that it's hot, how the barrier works, the saints they mentioned and all the other things.<br>If they fuck that up everything crumbles and the end sounds like an asspull.</br></br>  <br>Really I said it several times. <br>THis is not a fightan anime, you should see something else this season if you want fights and short dialogue<br>God Eater or something like that</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if that pack smells.</br>  <br>Most of the anime we get is mindless action I don't get why this one has to be too. I'm enjoying it so far, anyway.</br>  So who of the 7 is the traitor?<br><br>Please tell me it's Bunny. She's qt as hell but she feels like a traitor.</br></br>  <br> It's bunny <br> Then after she's found out, a new 7th appears <br> Then the other 7th is Adlet, but he doesn't know it. </br></br></br>  <br>Is the last part true? I caught up with the current translations and nothing suggested that.</br>  <br>I don't think my kokoro will be daijoubu if I watch another Clannad</br>  <br> He was brainwashed by the demon that attack his village to love the shit out of fremmy.  </br>  <br>You can explain stuff like that without being painfully slow or without just having 2 characters walking and talking for 3/4 of the episode, though. Lots of anime have done it before...</br>  <br>I'm guessing that's explained in Volume 5 or later in Volume 4?</br>  <br>Revealed at the end of 5.</br>  <br>why do that when he can believe in the me that believes in him?</br>  <br>No, she never liked him. If she ends up with anyone, it'll be her dog.</br>  Soon.  <br> Chamo is a girl and ends up with Hans.</br>  <br> o-oh no I have to love a cute girl <br>is this supposed to be bad?</br></br>  This episode was rather boring  <br>Yes, for reasons.</br>  <br><br><br>She's S to Goldof's M. You people don't understand relationships.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's really not the same without the audio. Her little yelp is a cute.<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/ciwiah.webm</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hes beta for Hime</br>  <br>DO DO DO</br>  <br>STOP HORSE<br>DO DO DO</br></br>  I currently think bunny is best girl<br><br>Do I brace for disappointment?</br></br>    <br>Quite</br>  <br>SHES THE TRAITAH ADLET AHHH</br>  <br>Yes. Still worth giving a good dicking to though.</br>  <br>what does this even mean</br>  <br>I love when tough girls have girly moments like that</br>  <br>So basically you like a whore who sucks Dozzu's dick and get fucked by dogs and a fucking asshole from other country who cums inside her vagina just because she wants some attention and allies to kill everyone?</br>  <br>Back to tumblr.</br>  <br>Bunny's best form was her outfit in episode one when she talked to adlet for the first time.</br>  Daily reminder Bunny literally sucks dog penis  <br>She had no ears though anon</br>  <br>I thought it was prince penis?</br>  Bunny a shit.  is there any porn of this shit or what  I keep thinking she's gonna bite her tail.  <br>I kind of suspected this reading books 1 and 2. But how does this master plan make any sense?!</br>  <br>Looks like she's already cucked by the faggy ginger MC.<br><br>What a joke</br></br></br>  <br>Explain what you think cucked means. None of the definitions I know fit.</br>  <br>You know, cucked. She's just fucking cucked. Look at her face, look at how she is unsure of herself, look how she gets run around in circles.<br><br>Cucked</br></br></br>  <br>None of that is being cucked. Please expand your vocabulary to consist of more than meme words.</br>  I'm more than pleased with this show so far.<br><br>But in an odd way I'm pleased that a second season seems unlikely. It's a lot harder to see volume 2 translating well to an anime.Getting off the mountain would be the new getting off the boat.</br></br>  <br>He cucked her combat skills and heart.</br>  <br>Need to buy this  demon  a beer.</br>  So is Nachtenalolillola secretly a sadist or something?  <br>She's an innocent bunny.</br>  <br>who cucks goldof</br>  <br> innocent <br><br>yeah right</br></br></br>  <br>Thats a cattail, the plant and i can tell you for sure, shes not gonna bite it~</br>  <br>She looks completely trustworthy.</br>   Sub it as Fremy in ep 2 <br> Sub it as Flamie in ep 3 <br>What will her name be next ep?</br></br>  <br>Fill me</br>  <br><br>Fuckmie</br></br>  <br> like bunny's design and personality the most <br> turns out she's the bad guy <br><br>Why ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoops, didn't mean to link</br>  <br>There aren't enough cute bad guys in anime.</br>  <br> get to like bunny over episode 1 and first half of 2 <br> she gets weird when separated from Adlet <br> Fremy's tsun is a miracle of the universe <br>Guess I can say goodbye to those buns with no regret.</br></br></br></br>  We know he's gonna get cuck'd. So whats there to watch?    <br>You're one of the firsts to be culled by the bloody blade of treachery, I despise thee</br>  <br>I want to spawn litters with bunny princess.</br>  <br>My brother of different mother.</br>  So anyone can tell me if me Adlet's mark was real?  <br>NO HE'S A FAKE JUST LIKE NASHETANYA.<br><br>THERE ARE 2 FAKES.</br></br></br>  <br>Fakers gonna fake. The 6th real hero hasn't came out yet.</br>  <br>Thanks, anon. It was bugging me earlier.</br>  I think I'm in love with Fremy. Why is her character design so good?  <br>But we saw him getting the mark.</br>  <br><br>same</br></br>  <br>She looks ridiculous and your taste is ridiculous.</br>  <br>Goddess on Earth.</br>  <br><br>Try to recall whole scene, he first saw demon lord and other shit, and then pain in his hand and this mark appeared.<br>You didnt feel strange about it ?</br></br></br>  Does Bunny princess get raped by demons at any point?  <br>She got fucked by a god.</br>  Is bunny doomed to be killed for being a traitor? She's too cute to die  <br>Is this just shitpostig or can someone post pics?</br>  Doujins when?  <br>I hope she os used as a symbol of peace between humans and demons as a birthing vessel for heirs</br>  <br>Wrong</br>  <br>The song is great, like from aztec culture</br>  Idk about this anime but I want to smother my face inbetween white girl's thighs hnnnnghhhh  I'm really enjoying the adventures of Aztec Batman.  Well, the first episode looked pretty good, but after this huge load of spoilers, that bunny girl (who at first I thought would become Adlet's main love interest) being the  traitor  and realizing  Adlet isn't a hero (on top of that not even being strong enough to be on pair with the six heroes ) I think I'll stop watching this series altogether and wait till the final chapter to see if Adlet became relevant to the story and if the ending is worth watching 12 shitty episodes. Honestly I'm expecting this series to end like Aldnoah Zero, where the MC becomes practically irrelevant at the end and his supposed love interest goes to fuck another guy.   /a/ still discusses Fateshit non-stop even when there's nothing related airing <br><br>Fucking why.</br></br>   /a/ is discussing anime <br><br>I know, THE HORROR!</br></br>  If you think that's bad, you should see the Yahari threads.  I remember the time when people wouldnt shut up about Tsukihime.   miuna monday is still a thing <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with these people?</br></br>  <br>of course they would<br><br>VNs belong on /jp/ after all</br></br></br>  <br>Because /a/ has been talking about TM non-stop for as long as /a/ has been around.</br>  We should make more Non Non Biyori threads instead  <br> what if x happened instead of y <br> why didn't x just do this? <br> what if x master had y servant? </br></br></br>  <br><br>4chan is like a chatroom to them. It's all the same people, every thread. Terrible.</br></br>  There's always something new happening with the fate franchise, they just won't stop milking it. It's HXH threads you should be complaining about.  <br>as expected from prison school fags who joined the board yesterday.</br>  <br> What is manga <br>Not even the OP, but are you even trying?</br></br>  <br>Why haven't mods banned that shit yet then?</br>  <br><br>Soon. <br><br>https://archive.moe/tv/thread/58657<wbr>835/#58657873</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>What, do you want me to "discuss" Umaru-chan or some shit?</br>  They are still better than Evafags to be honest, walking into one of those threads is like having a tour of Tumblr.  <br>Because the mods post in, and babysit, the threads.<br><br><br>There was a similar post on /a/ a while back. Nothing happened. Mods just circlejerk their shit threads and make a false flag public ban rec thread every week so retards fellate them and think they're doing something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari threads are fucking disgustin yet I don't see you crying about them fuckface.<br>At least fatefags ran out of things after a decade, Yaharifags have been here for a couple months and they already repeat the same posts every thread.</br></br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/capcod<wbr>e/mod/<br><br> this retard who bans random generals and forgets 2 days later <br><br>worst was when wixoss got banned while it was airing</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Monstergirls and homu threads are back.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br> At least fatefags ran out of things after a decade, <br>Not even, it's more that every thread get targeted by shitposters so nobody that actually likes Fate is creating or participating in threads regularly.</br></br>  <br> OP wants /a/ only to discuss currently airing shit <br> people still wonder why their old anime isn't discussed here </br></br>  <br><br>There's a difference between good, occasional discussion about old anime and the generalshit we currently have.</br></br>  <br>It's what they get for convincing every newfag they have to read the VN or bitch about english only primaries.<br><br>Well, now everyone read the VN, it was shit, and we're making good on that investment by participating in the cheap shitposting or dank maymays they invented last decade. They have themselves to blame.</br></br></br>  Yuru Yuri threads right now are pretty bad. It's essentially a general in all but name. Atleast Fate fags have a different OP text for their threads.  <br> TALK ABOUT MORE ANIME <br> NICE ANIME THREAD OP <br> WHAT ANIME IS THIS ABOUT <br><br> AHHH GENERALFAGS WHY DO YOU KEEP MAKING GENERALS <br><br>I blame moot and mods for this mentality mostly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   /a/ still discusses shit like oreimo that is below average at best   <br> Justifying shitposting <br>You are cancer and the world would be better if you killed yourself.</br></br>  <br>It's just my assumption, but I think fatefags are mostly just edgelords on the opposite end of the spectrum from moefags. Both are cancerous as fuck, but don't seem to realize it.</br>  <br><br>No one gives a shit about LOGH discussion every couple of days, it's when you have 24/7 threads like Yaharifags that it's a problem.</br></br>  I want to put a finger inside the girl in the OP image.  <br>TMfags are not on a spectrum, or if they are they are kind of on the middle. There are too many who jerk off to their sabah or their rin or their akiha or their ilya.</br>  Forget about powerlevels and decade old visual novels, I can't even stand being in airing anime threads a day or two after the episode aired.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> &gt;&gt;&gt; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not going to stop. All it takes is one faggot to start a thread.</br></br>  <br>I don't get how this particular anime is so popular.<br><br>It gets 400 replies 300 images omitted all the time, and for the longest time perpetual oreimo threads.<br><br>All to discuss literally the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br>  Ever since mods started encouraging Naruto threads /a/ has really let itself go and it introduced a new breed of general posters who only care about one show and have no interest in ever doing anything else.  List of shit that needs to be purged from the board but the mods are too much of pussy fags to actually do it:<br><br>Jojo generals<br>HxH generals<br>Yuru Yuri generals<br>Yuyushiki generals<br>Madoka tripfag circlejerks<br>Hibike generals<br>Yahari generals<br>Fujoshit circlejerks<br>Miuna Monday<br><br>Why the fuck can't all fanbases of popular stuff be as well behaved as Monogatari or EVA fans are about this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Monogatari </br>  <br>Yahari is just too much of a good bait for shitposters<br>Like you have everything right there just waiting to be taken</br></br>  <br>They don't have a general. Only occasional threads focusing on a specific topic most of the time. Same thing with EVA. Everyone should follow their examples.</br>  <br>the moment they start going all out, IRC crews will start leaking shit like names and chat rooms<br>its a bloody power play of neets and fatties</br></br>  <br>OreImo is as integral to /a/ as Evangelion. Prove me wrong.</br>  <br><br>kinda always the case really<br><br>people keep trying to get /a/nons to expand their horizons but they are usually "hurr moeshit durr edgy herpderp anime is shit"<br><br>under that train of thought is it really surprising that people only stick to the anime they know?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I try to report every Yahari general I find but mods don't give a fuck.<br><br>Naruto threads are better than Yahari, Yahari is full of tumblr and reddit. And they have no fucking shame of admitting they are from tumblr and reddit</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ doesn't even like Oreimo (worst girl won after all). <br><br>they don't like Eva either but Eva is integral to anime period, not just /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Mods did delete one of the yahari generals <br>10, and i shit you not, 10 threads popped in less of 50 seconds.</br></br>  <br>Also, forgot about that "Idle Activities" shit and Love Live.</br>  <br> light novels go on /jp/ <br>I thought they could be discussed here if they have an anime/manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHA. YOU'LL NEVER BE FREE FROM FATE THREADS.</br>  <br> Monogatari or EVA fans <br><br>I like Type moon and jojo better.</br></br></br>  <br>that's usually what happens when you delete generals.<br><br>deleting a general is like popping a pimple.</br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  50 bucks we get /ag/ in less of a year<br>Do it rapeape, i know you are reading this you sjw fuck</br>  <br>Aikatsu is constantly getting new episodes, also is a catch all for other little girl shows. Not really comparable to love live which is more starved for discussion. Ironically aikatsu people are less elitist than other popular shit even thiugh they have more of a right to for a 100+ episode show.</br>  <br>It's not like deleting a thread gets them tired.<br><br>If they delete one and 10 pop out then delete those 10. <br>It will be little while but threads will start disappearing.<br><br>Mods just don't give a fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Apparently, the reason was that it was NSFW. A later thread with that picture but cropped showed up and didn't get deleted.</br></br>  <br> &gt;/a/ still discusses Fateshit non-stop even when there's nothing related airing <br>Fate currently has 2 manga series and 2 LN series with new chapters and volumes being released every couple of months or so and with translations of all four projects coming all the time. There is plenty of new content to discuss.</br></br>  <br>Ya you're either new or retarded. <br>There's a site that EVA fags are from and it sure as shit isn't tumblr.</br></br>  <br>You can't say rapeape, troid or redwood without being caller a gamercancer fuckhead these days.</br>  <br>why not?<br>/a/ is /v/ anyway<br><br>I mean we even got threads like these</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not a part of any of these generals, hell I rarely ever post anymore, but what's the issue people have with them? It seems like a good idea to keep all talk in a single thread as opposed to possibly numerous threads.</br>  <br>there's more than that anon, a number of blacklisted tripfags have been doing wet work on high profile animes so the fanbase gets shit on.<br><br>Fuck em too, all bark no bite</br></br></br>  <br>evageeks is basically tumblr<br><br><br>And does /a/ discuss them?<br><br>average fate thread<br><br> shirou is the red man <br> what would {x servant} {class} look like <br> rin so kawaii <br> unlimited jets </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> generals are good <br>fucking kike</br></br>   people discussing fateshit should be banned  <br> pre-2000 manga/anime discussion is allowed </br>  <br> but what's the issue people have with them? It seems like a good idea to keep all talk in a single thread as opposed to possibly numerous threads. <br>Because moot and rapeape call them cancer, so you're supposed to hate generals and call them cancer, even though the moderation is what encourages them anyway<br><br>There's really nothing inherently wrong with generals unless it's a a yahari/love live situation where you've dried up new content to discuss. For the most part it's just shit mods claim to care about for support like a politician saying he'll cut middle class taxes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Plenty of people complain about Redwood without /v/edditors calling them GGers</br>  <br> And does /a/ discuss them? <br>maybe they start out that way, but they don't stay that way for long. There's a fate thread in the catologue right now that started out about homolusting over Lancer and quickly became about the Fate/Strange Fake manga and LN and the recent translations for both. <br>Also I just realized that there are actually three Fate LNs coming out if you count Lord El-Melloi II Case Files.</br></br></br>  /vg/ was made to contain cancer, and it worked<br>/a/ could use the same treatment.</br>  <br>As an ex HxH fan, any mention of that show makes me angry. I don't hate it, I just hate Togashi.</br>  <br>No it isn't. <br>Generals drive down the over all quality of the board by bring in low quality posters who dilute the good content with fucking shitty ass repetitive threads with barely any effort put forth. <br>Threads that are inherently decreasing the over all content of the board should be removed for the sake of the community and if you don't give a fuck about the community here then honestly we don't fucking want you around. <br>Naruto is toxic and it is killing this board and if we all just sit around it's going to take it from us. <br>Balls in our court boys.<br>The staff's hands are either tied or they are refusing to do anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you looked at Eva threads recently? Nothing but page long tl;dr bickerings to defend the integrity of their favorite characters, all of which reads like somebody insulted their mother. Tell me with a straight face that's not tmblr.</br>  <br>But /vg/ is way better than /v/ in every sense, /v/ is shitposting general all the way down and tumblr reigns over there.<br><br>I mean jesus christ there's people telling they're from tumblr in that place. Also they're all a bunch of underage faggots and newfag enablers</br></br></br>  Why do you guys even care anyway?<br><br>you don't like the anime/manga that the generals are about nor do you like them talking about said anime so having them squared away in one general should be a good thing for you. <br><br>If you autistic fucks had your way there would be even less anime/manga talked about on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/vg/ seems pretty decent if you actually care about video games<br><br>/m/ is basically an /ag/ for mecha toku stuff, and for most stuff it doesnt seem to have a negative impact that it has a lot of general threads</br></br></br>   Yahari this yahari that. <br><br>Blimey,last time i saw one of those threads, they only had a dude translating the LN and died out peacefully.</br></br>  <br>/vg/ is IRC-tier circlejerking.</br>  ITT: /v/ermin that don't want anime on the fucking anime board.  <br>Because lazy uncreative people who are just going to squat and repost the same god damn content are not welcome here. <br>Take it to one of the many shit forums if that's what you're looking for.</br></br>  <br> low quality posters <br>Define low quality<br> good content <br>Define good<br><br> we don't fucking want you around <br> speaking on behalf of everyone as if all of /a/ are liked minded </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>vg is decent.<br><br>Try and make a thread about something(that's not nintendo related) on /v/ you'll get shitposted to death, i've been checking. <br>In /vg/ I see people actually discussing the shit they like with people that like it, no shitposting</br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto is toxic and it is killing this board and if we all just sit around it's going to take it from us <br>/thread</br></br>  <br> Generals drive down the over all quality of the board by bring in low quality posters who dilute the good content with fucking shitty ass repetitive threads with barely any effort put forth.  <br>I don't see any evidence of that, the famous generals have a bad rep because they are cancer, but for the rest of them are just normal threads more highly organized. I see absolutely difference between having 3 shitty meme threads while UBW aired instead of one single /fate/ general.<br><br> Threads that are inherently decreasing the over all content of the board should be removed for the sake of the community and if you don't give a fuck about the community here then honestly we don't fucking want you around <br>That is true, but as I will explain the current policies encouraged this situation.<br><br> The staff's hands are either tied or they are refusing to do anything. <br>They have an agenda to keep the general stuff in place <br><br>Imagine if you had another code geass show today, it wouldn't exist since mods would only see "shitposting" and delete them to keep in one thread. Yet the next week they'll ban another show for general threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto is toxic <br><br>Are you dumb? There's 1 Naruto thread when new content comes out(anime or movie spoilers). <br><br>Stop parroting shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hows about you leave the board since you don't even want to talk about anime.<br><br>Why the hell are you here anyway. Just to bad mouth other anime fans and discourage anime threads from even being made?</br></br></br>  <br>/vg/ is pure shitposting. I used to post in Arcsys general and that was shitposting 24/7</br>  <br>It's still important to /a/ though. We get threads all the time asking about the ending much the same way as Eva.</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  I like to blame the whole "doing ironically" mentality myself.  <br>Do you see the fucking autist that shit posts on ghost and in every thread and the reposted threads that happen when a shit thread gets deleted. These people are dictating how this board is run, do you agree that that much power should lie with a single group of users? Why is it fair to protect these people from the community that would eat them whole if the mods weren't standing between us and them?</br>  <br>Explain then. <br><br>Check how many Naruto threads are in the catalogue. <br>Check how many Fate thread are there.<br>Check the quality of Yahari generals that are on 24/7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't play video games, but it seemed like /vg/ didn't have a culture of its own, there could be threads with high quality content or other threads that are pure shit.<br><br>this is similar to  point about negative effects on the community but it seems to work fine besides that</br></br></br>  <br>A number of semi dead generals are decent<br>ddg and armored core general comes to mind.<br>Now if you go for the shitpost central that are lolgen and dotagen, then yeah.</br></br></br>  Why is this thread still up? Why hasn't /v/ left?<br>I'm not defending generalshit but metathreads are just as bad.</br>  <br>The fuck are you quoting me for? That has nothing to do with Niggywood and his buttbuddies.</br>  Why do you guys hate reddit and tumblr so much anyway?<br><br>They are just other websites that both discuss anime and yes it is okay to have a facebook too.<br><br>Go to   if you are afraid of the feminists watching you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Get out</br>  <br><br>Look at /tv/, something that is literally Reddit: the board, and tell me why I shouldn't hate it.</br></br>  <br>tumblr is /pol/ but on the other end of the spectrum.<br><br>don't know about reddit</br></br></br>  <br>back to the gas chamber with you</br>  <br>I think you made a wrong turn at reddit, you were supposed to go to gaia.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I watched a general for a game I used to love succumb to shitposting to the point where nobody even bothers making threads anymore.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw gaia is dead and all its users flooded to /a/ </br>  All you have to do to realize how bad generals are, go to /vg/ and spend the day in the star craft thread.  <br>Because I HAVE THE RIGHT TO TALK AND THE FREEDOM TO DEAL WITH THE<br>CONSEQUENCES</br></br>  <br>He likely can't handle the naruto banter. It's anime and he doesn't understand why it isn't liked.</br>  <br>Or the Katawa Shitjou and Mass Effect generals</br>  <br>sc is dead, go to lolgen if you want the real deal<br><br>Hotline miami?<br>Drakenguard 3?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hotline miami? <br> Drakenguard 3? <br>A weeaboo MMORPG published by Nexon that you probably haven't heard of.</br></br></br>  <br>These will do as well. <br>bit the bullet and delete /vg/ and then ban them when they flood back to /v/ and we might come out of this as a site better than before. This will never happen though.</br></br>  <br> waiting /cog/ , /ag/ for years <br> still nothing <br> /v/ get another fucking board for retro <br>there's no justice in this world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those the multiple Fate threads are the alternative to generals<br><br> Want to make a thread for all discussions of a certain anime  <br> waahhh GENERALS ARE SHIT DON'T MAKE THEM <br> Make threads of each discussion  <br> WAAAAHHH THERE'S TOO MANY THREADS KEEP IT IN ONE THREAD <br><br>the only other option is to stop discussing the anime altogether which is why your criticism always come off as "stop liking what I don't like!"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>meg is deader than evils</br>  <br>You're not getting /ag/. <br>I know it for a fact. <br>A FACT. <br>I can't elaborate more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mass Effect generals <br>I used that as a support group when mass effect 3 sucked, little while later and I was on the korra train as well.<br><br>It was those experiences that taught me to never expect anything to be good again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spill the beans jannyman, i know it has to do with the deal the mods broke with Crunchyroll and fakku</br>  <br>Sssssss $s</br>  <br>Oreimo has BLOOD RELATED incest.<br><br>That's a rarity in anime nowadays. The characters are also much more human that your average harem anime.</br></br></br>  <br>No it isn't. <br>Just put fucking effort into your topics and if you can't think of anything talk about something else. Major shocker I know but there is other anime. And better ways than posting a fucking pastebin link or the same god damn one liner for the 6 month in a row. <br>And that's not to say that lesser threads like the fish are a problem but to say that actual threads of topical worth should not be subjected to this level of repetitiveness.</br></br></br>  <br> want to treat /a/ like /v/ <br> want to marginalize anime discussion from /a/ <br> want to extend the life of anime that probably would be forgotten naturally in a few years tops <br> want to galvanize the /v/ermin that constantly tries to shove anime they don't like off the board <br><br>this thread is cancer and so are you<br>I want the mods to ban OP more than any general on here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you only like fish because it's old the oldfags are the most pretentious shitposters</br>  <br>Yotsuga no Sora had blood-related incest too and it was MUCH better.</br>  <br>Nice line of BS. <br>Also not staff. <br>But I know people and I will not say more because nothing is for sure except /ag/ will never exist.</br></br></br>  <br>It was a joke you tight ass, i know you won't say no more, and /ag/ ain't happening for a number of good reasons that wouldn't take a genius to figure it out.</br>  <br> implying 4chan just won't get deleted and all boards replaced with /generals/ with 150 pages  <br><br>0 moderation for average threads, and moderation will be replaced with scanning the catalog for /pol/, occutard anonymous, CP, loli, IRC leaks or gamergate stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd really be great if the eva and madokafags would quit hiding their generals behind<br> hurr I just finished ____. What does /a/ think of it? <br/></br></br>  <br>Is there a rule that says that you can't discuss anime that has finished airing?</br>  <br>Because they're openly shitty people about their power levels.<br><br>They wear fucking AoT t-shirts everywhere and shout about their Aspergers in public. If I even mention I enjoy any sort of anime, I get roped into that group. Fuck tumblr and fuck reddit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> taking the bait </br></br></br></br>  <br>just return the damn board to the days of anime/random and /l/</br>  <br>man gg stuff never stops amusing me<br>i mean, you could leak a fucking nuke code and the mods wouldn't give 2 shits, but if you even mention gg, its ban on SIGHT.</br></br>  <br> <br>Nobody here gives a fuck</br></br>  <br>Except the mods, I give the thread 5 minute lifespan after now.</br>  <br>nigga read the damn post i replyed</br>  <br>Only because someone might have reported your post for being an off topic /v/ post and for it being annoying as hell when we're all talking about /a/. <br><br>The mods might be a little over zealous right now but can you blame them? you do realize those celebs almost killed the site right? <br>Regardless these are things that have little to do with /a/ and our current problem of sliding to /v/'s &amp; /vg/'s level. <br>You all know from the logs the reason the moderation is so bad right now, they are down a major mod. What did you think would happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br><br>You're actually too retarded to post. Nobody gave a shit about whats her face or video games until you gave it national attention. Go lie in your grave shitdick.</br></br></br>  <br> The mods might be a little over zealous right now but <br> &gt;&gt;&gt; </br></br>  <br>They go against the very purpose of fucking imageboards. If you want generals, go to a forum.</br>  <br> down a major mod <br>mind giving a tl dr?</br></br>  <br>nigga please, read<br>READ</br></br>  Why are Jojo generals still allowed when all there is is monthly chapters and the occasionally (/v/ related) game news? Literally half the threads are just reposts, and the stuff that isn't is mostly tumblrinas schlicking to their otp husbando ships, or "le hat would your stand be guys XD" shit.<br><br>I assume the other content-starved generals like Yahari and (to a lesser extent) Fate and Berserk are just as bad with the same regurgitated shit being posted over and over ad nauseum. The worst part is that if you try to bring it up in the threads the fuckers just brush it off or reply to your post with those fucking cancerous bait image macros.<br><br>It fucking amazes me that people defend 24/7 generals for shit that doesn't have significant news or content being released. If they want to sit in a shitty circlejerk for years it would be easier just to find an actual forum, but no, they have to stay there because m-muh board culture.<br><br>Fuck this gay earth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kino mod is kill</br>  <br>I'm reading some guy getting butthurt about his GG posts getting him banned. <br><br>Saying "nigga" doesn't make you a special snowflake either. It just means you're unemployed.</br></br></br>  <br>No he isn't. Kusanagi is kill.</br>  <br>why would I read /v/ shit?</br>   /a/ will never get a autism like /soc/ and break the site code just so he could track down a tripfag <br>;-;</br>  <br>If you talk too much you'll be banned. <br>You can find the logs through the archive.</br></br>   yfw /ag/ existed <br> yfw it was /b/ </br>  <br>That was /int/ you fuck.</br>  <br>same shit, different name</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br><br>No one will EVER out-shitpost 2011-2013 /scv/. No one.</br></br>  <br>You realize this is what we fear though right. These people start to get trips and then threads aren't about anime anymore, they are about them and their identity to the thread. You see this with the key thread here already.</br>  <br>Actually, it does related to to my central point.  was kind of a joke, but it relates back to my main point   where the mods see themselves as these secret agents enforcing these top secret agendas against GG and fappening and other shitstorms, they think they are badasses of troll, inc., defending the secret club, when they are fat losers who let the ego go to their head.<br><br>This constitutes 90% of the effort, the other 10% goes to deleting "shitposting" at random, and then sometimes banning a general but only for a few days. So what this means, is a thread off topic or baiting like this, will sometimes get you a 1 or 3 day ban, usually it will just archive and nothing happens to it.<br><br>So this inconsistency in the "shitposting" moderation, the "I know it when I see it" style moderation, encourages more general threads because the only way your thread won't get in trouble is if it is clearly labeled as about one specific series. So Subject: Fate or Subject: JoJo's or Subject: G-Reco won't get deleted, but a thread comparing 2 shows might, a thread trolling some fanbase or studio might, but even that is inconsistent.<br><br>tl;dr: Mods are obsessed with the wrong things, and the remaining moderation is inconsistent and encourages generals. Banning game of thrones or steven universe general is a temporary solution they forget about immediately. Steven universe was banned last month I saw on the archive, but I bet it's back  oh yup it's back, also  and .<br><br>So what are they doing with most of their time. Trolling /v/tards and /pol/. Quality moderation.<br><br> using unemployed as an insult </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br/>  <br>Ain't that something</br>  <br>tell me more</br>  Stop engaging him.  <br>Oh, and one last thing, I do put my money where my mouth is, I make a lot of anime threads that aren't related to a general, that are just one-off threads, and all of them can always get deleted for shitposting and I would accept it as fair. But at least I'm not making le next general because I do not support that style of posting, so decide which you want, stuff that can be "shitposting" or more general threads. I don't see a third choice.</br>  <br>Look faggot, you're complaining about /v/ shit and NONE OF US GIVE A FUCK, SERIOUSLY. YOU'RE THE MINORITY ON THAT SUBJECT IN THIS BOARD. <br>The rest of what you said I don't give a god damn fuck what thread you post as long as you put effort forth and neither do the mods.</br></br>  <br>some dude on int cracked the code, had admin status, nobody noticed and what he does?, posts the fucking street the tripfag lived on a thread and how he got it, moot did a full clean house shortly after.</br>  <br> Fate <br> content-starved <br>There are a lot of things you can accuse the Fate franchise and Fate threads of being , but content starved is not one of them.<br> biannual Strange Fake LN  <br> biannual Lord El-Melloi II Case Files LN <br> Strange Fake Manga <br> monthly HF manga  <br> monthly Prototype LN and it's spinoff <br> Prisma Illya 3rei manga <br> Prisma Illya 2wei starts anime next week <br> weekly character releases for Grand Order </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't /b/, the mods do delete shitposting and no one can explain what they consider shitposting is. I'm pointing out this mentality is what led to the general situation.</br>  <br>Have you ever been to [s4s]?</br>  <br> to a lesser extent </br>  <br>Also, I was pointing out mods act like /v/tards is part of the issue, or look at this thread where people were debating over their favorite /vg/ groups, why should anyone care about the nuances of your favorite /vg/ threads? This isn't /v/ or /vg/, it's not related here.<br><br><br>No, that board should be deleted. A joke that overstayed its welcome.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Between the neet anime avatarfags who would blog about their shitty lives and the kpop spammers(before their exodus to /mu/, where you can see them STILL posting the same shit they did 3-5 years ago), /scv/ is the prime example of what happens when 24/7 threads happen.</br>  <br>No it shouldn't. That board is operating on high irony and is a great example of shit posting. go visit it.</br>  kuso thread  <br>It just got stale, from lack of content and the ironic meme stuff only has so much you could do with it. It should have been generalized into a 2d/random board or something else with more to post about.</br>  <br>If they kept to their own board I wouldn't care.</br>  <br>Even ylilauta does ironic shitposting funnier than [s4s]</br>  Reposting from a thread I made some days ago about a similar subject: /a/ DOES NOT FUCKING NEED a bump limit so high. It should be just 250 or 300. I hate seeing threads staying for days here and never leaving the damn board because autistic general fags never let them die even it's clear nobody is interesting in posting in them. I believe it would lower the occurrence of the generals as well if this measure was taken since most of the pseudo-generals aren't posted consecutively like on /vg/.  <br> *even if it's clear nobody is interested in posting in them <br><br>Fix'd.</br></br></br>  <br> We get threads all the time asking about the ending much the same way as Eva. <br>No it's not the same. If the faggot author wasn't a pussy with all the implications and wrote a proper incest ending (you know like YnS had) there would be no such threads.<br>Also it's on completely different leve. New Eva babies are lost but new Oreimo babies are disappointed and old Oreimofags must post walls of text to explain author's pussyness.</br></br></br>  Mods need to stop deleting Imouto and Loli threads.  <br> Fateshit non-stop even when there's nothing related airing <br><br>Fate fags a retards</br></br></br>  <br>mods are a myth</br>  I just want the fucking mods to be more active.<br><br>Stop having 2 hours hot-pockets break every 5 minutes.</br></br>   TM and Fate have been on /a/ for basically a decade <br> newfags hate it because it's not whatever faggy show they started watching 2 years ago </br>  <br>The nicest thing I can say about them is it isn't Naruto.</br>  <br> Fateshit non-stop even when there's nothing related airing <br>It's been pointed out several times in this thread that there are a number of Fate franchise manga and Light Novels coming out and being translated all the time.</br></br>  <br>Fateshit is cancer.</br>  <br>You need to fix your standards and lurk moar if you think anything TM is naruto tier.</br>  <br>/v/ is filled with shitposters, newfags and underage.<br>/vg/ is filled with autism.<br>That said, /vg/ is still much better if you want to discuss vidya</br></br></br>  <br>The series seems very mediocre considering how the hype that surrounds it.</br>  <br>Not him but it's pretty good for its genre.</br>  <br><br>It depends on the video game, really.</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck those faggots need serious help.</br>  <br> /vg/ is filled with autism. <br>Depends on the game.<br>Threads with single platform games with not too many participants are comfiest.</br></br></br>  Madokafag here, and I would love very much if people stopped making Madoka threads. Or at least, ban the shitposters that are spoiling threads about their "character degradation" bullshit. This has lasted for too long.  <br> seems <br>So you haven't actually read or watched any of it, and just hate it because it's popular.</br></br>  <br> literally butthurt because you think it doesn't deserve to be popular <br>Tell me which series you think is better than Fate, but can't find anybody to care about. Will it make your asspain less severe?</br></br>  <br>That's fine if you think that, but there are tons of people who disagree, and will happily discuss shit for hours or even days because they just like it that much. I mean, I get the fact that the assholes who constantly shitpost about JETS and Whore of Babylon are fucking autistic, but there's a lot of genuine interest there, and it's just a stupid idea to complain about generals where all of that can be discussed with people who enjoy the same thing as you, especially since this board is filled with people who constantly shit on anything Type-MOON, so the people who want the discussion will inevitably make their own threads so people who don't like it don't constantly shitpost and keep calling them cancer.</br>  <br> /a/ could use the same treatment. <br>There was a discussion about /ag/ during the big /a/ general purge days and the result was that splitting /a/ wouldn't be good idea because there's not that many people and everything would slow down to hell.</br></br>  <br>I watched zero once cause I was curious but I have not read the VN or watched the anime. I wasn't very impressed. Only thing to pique my interest was that magical girl spinoff of the series.</br>  <br>Let me guess, people kept saying that Prisma Illya was the best thing Fate related to ever come out, and you took their word for it? Shitters are real, and when memes get out of hand everything starts going to shit.</br>  <br>Not really, even games that are/were universally beloved by the board get the shitposting treatment, it became an echochamber for memes/shitposting and there's really no difference between /v/ and r/gaming now.<br><br>/vg/ may be full of autistic and salty faggots but at least they actually discuss video games like people who don't have a massive case of tourettes</br></br></br>  <br>Because fateshit has been a pillar of the /a/ community ever since the first p0n0s went into a vag000</br>  <br>I kind of feel the same way about Fate threads and I'm a Fatefag. I like discussing Strange Fake and Case files as they are new and exciting content, I even like the HF manga threads even though they have an abundance of the wormslut meme, but two thirds of Fate threads are just Zero secondaries and and Zero haters shitposting about how much they hate each other and how terrible the other is. It's the same stupid argument over and over again.</br>  <br>I don't know how this illya meme became a thing, /a/ is truly hipster</br>  <br>Zero will always be a poor introduction to the franchise. Spoiler issues aside, it gives the wrong impression for what the general tone and content of Fate stories is like. <br><br>Also, you don't really know anything about Fate's setting if you only watched Zero.</br></br></br>  <br>Madoka threads are shit for other reasons.Tripfags dominance being one of the them</br>  <br>Imouto threads are full of bullies and autismal blood elitists. They deserve whatever comes their way.</br>  <br>It's a fine manga, don't get me wrong, but it's far from being the best Fate material, at least in my opinion. Hollow Ataraxia is just really hard to beat in my books.</br>  <br>Zero is the best thing to ever come out of Fate though. at least anime wise</br>   f/a/ggots hate generals because they're repetitive <br> implying everyone lurks /a/ 24/7 like them <br> implying new posters don't cycle through often meaning they only stop by a general once or a few times a week <br> implying giving mods even more carte blanche to erase topics from the board is a good idea </br></br></br>  <br>Lemme guess, You're one of those "oneesan" faggots or don't understand the difference between blood related and NBR.</br>  So what would be good chemo to end the general menace assuming moderation and a new board are both out of the question?  <br>I just like cute girls doing violent actiony things.</br>  <br> bullies </br>  <br>Nobody implied any of those things.</br>  <br>Welcome to the mindset of the faggots at ANN.</br>  <br>I don't understand why all the butthurt in this thread, just ignore the content of threads that you don't like, it's not that hard.</br>  <br>Zero is like having this incredibly constructed world campaign made by a DM, and then the PCs just decide to dick around one area and ignore backstory prompts and lore-related events to murder each other. And any attempt to bring attention to the amazing setting is just completely ignored in favor of PCs trying to one up each other. So the DM eventually gets fed up and has them all killed by one of the lore-related things they refused to learn about.</br>  <br>Nice guess, but I just hate oriemo and YnS with a passion (and the threads consist of nothing but these fanbases).<br><br><br>Nice meme</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I ignore the threads that doesn't mean that anyone else is. Cancer spreads.</br>  It's actually impossible for people to ignore something they dislike round here isn't it.  <br> f/a/ggots hate generals because they're repetitive <br>F/a/ggots hate generals because they often devolve into tripfag circlejerking and image dumps with close to zero discussion very soon after the new source material stops appearing.<br>Also anons are very bad deciding what should and what shouldn't have a general so when they were common you had like first 2 maybe 3 pages full of basically dead threads artificially bumped by image spam because of I-LIKE-THIS-ANIME-SO-IT-MUST-HAVE-A<wbr>-GENERAL attitude.</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's still Carnival Phantasm. Which Zero had no part of.</br>  <br> So the DM eventually gets fed up and has them all killed by one of the lore-related things they refused to learn about. <br>Gay right campaign /tg/ pasta?</br></br>  <br> that image <br><br>OP your taste is far worse than the Fatefags. In anycase nobody cares about your opinion, fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>So you don't like Incest but come to /a/? You're an odd fellow.</br>  <br>Anime always favors character banter/interaction over lore, world-building and atmosphere.Just see how Shinsekai Yori turned out, anime fandom doesn't care about these things.</br>  <br>Not gonna disagree about fandoms, since the reception for F/Z anime vs every other Fate anime speaks for itself, but point remains F/Z is the shallowest story in the franchise.</br>  <br> what is 12 kingdoms? </br>  <br>Why is it so popular?</br>  <br>Do you really think that FSN is any better?</br>  <br>Extremely obscure anime with a passionate but small fandom, just like SSY.</br>  <br>Urobucchi's name brought along his fanboys for the ride. As for the rest, it's just a straight up action/drama fantasy with an ensemble cast. It's very accessible to normies.</br>  <br>Not him but you're saying that as it incest content made a significant portion of /a/'s threads. I don't think daily 'Reminder' thread that dies with &lt;50 posts counts as that.</br>  <br>People lowered their standards after F/SN.</br>  Time for your weekly dose of tomato suffering.

He even bounced off the asphalt</br>  <br> Implying the King isn't done breaking the tomato <br>He's going to make soup out of Yuya</br></br>  <br>But it's not the same!</br>  <br>Why does the KINGU like breaking people?</br>  <br> 64 episodes in already <br> still no sight of Ruri <br><br>Why is this allowed? You told me there would be flashbacks /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Where's that interdimensional cross gone wrong leading to a timeskip where Yuya never aged only to return to Standard, find everything destroyed and Zuzu with Hughgo going to happen?  <br>Because she's either dead thanks to Yuto and he didn't have the heart to tell Shun or she was always evil in the first place and sold Xyz out. <br><br>Get ready for Serena/Yuzu vs. Ruri/Rin Fusion bowl.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't want you to get hurt anymore <br>Never understood this, did he punch her in the stomach or something?</br></br>  <br>I like your taste in decks.</br>  <br> we'll have to wait until episode 78 for her to appear <br><br>This is true suffering.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuto and Ruri were dueling one day <br> Yuto beats Ruri <br> Academia invades at that moment and she is helpless from just getting beaten  <br> Gets kidnapped <br> Yuto goes EGAO mode and starts destroying people and carding them to save Ruri <br> Yuto is never the same </br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, is it weird that I'm expecting Yuri and Serena's memories have been altered by Leo so that they don't remember one another? Because I really doubt that they have no connection since all three other Yuya/Yuzu pairs are so connected.  <br>Worst boys deserve to get carded.</br>  <br><br>You could not pay me to drop a Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, no matter how radical the story changes were.</br></br>  <br>Because it entertains us.</br>  <br> Ruri is more scared of Yuto than Acedemia goons and joins them willingly </br>  <br>Yeah, though it'll probably be bad/mediocre like the 5D's manga was.<br>This Arc-V manga seems to be making the same mistake that made me dislike the 5D's manga so much, so I have no expectations here.</br></br>  <br> tfw I don't want to pay for those goddamn tokens </br>  <br>Maybe, I doubt it though. Yuri seems to be a complete oddity when it comes to the Fruits.</br>   you will never fall in their trap   <br> you will never create stupid ass card effects for Konami </br>  <br>Good. Rafflesia is smelly, she can stay in OCGland.</br>  <br>Rafflesia can use her holes on me anytime she wants.</br>  <br><br><br> Mfw I moved today hundreds of Time-Space Trap Holes, Myrmileos and the other sluts at double price because people it's stupid and buys into OCG exclusive hype </br></br></br>  <br> This card cannot be destroyed by card effects or targeted, don't even look at it either <br> If it IS destroyed, just grab another monster per its effect to special summon it again, no big deal <br> When this card does something: Destroy something or two somethings <br><br>I liked it when monsters used to have single effects.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's just hope some good cards come out of it.</br>  <br>But she smells like zombie-type monsters.</br>  <br>You forgot<br> When a card or effect is activated, negate the activation and destroy it </br></br>  <br>Looks at all those cute monster girls. They must smell like sweet flower nectar.</br>  <br><br> waaaahh why Konami prints good cards </br></br>  <br>You mean<br> When a card or effect is activated, negate the activation, tear the card in half and then punch your opponent in the face </br></br>  <br>Extra Deck Performapals are my main hope.</br>  <br>I think your looking for Aromages. Those girls are real flowers.</br>  <br>lol ehhhhhh</br>  <br> I defend bad game design purely exploited for profit </br>  <br>Dunno about that. We thought Serena was pretty bad at first too. But while she may act a little rougher than Yuzu, shes still good at heart.</br>  <br>Yuri cards people for being in his way. At least Serena thought that soldiers should fight and die honourably.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Konami is not a charity, never was, and never will be brah.<br>It's literally shitter mentality to reject good cards based on some useless moral code regarding what is fair or not. If a card is good, you use it if you can, period.<br><br>Also all the effects you guys mentioned are just standard generic "good effects", these aren't overpowered. Tellarknights are the worst deck in the current Tier 1 and got all of that. Grow a pair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Man I expected Yuya to lose to Jack but at least be able to go toe to toe with him. Like in a way to say this kid was better than expected or something.  This is out of nowhere but would anyone happen to have that shitty Zexal Olympic special lying around? I need it for animation stuff.  <br>Look at this stooge, defending those Japanese Jews.<br>Probably enjoys playing Abyss and Necloth decks.</br></br>  <br>TCG officially died when they made Minerva a prize card</br>  <br>Just because you can create a power creep does not mean you should. It's poor design and poor balancing when you're forcing yourself to create a power creep in order to dethrone current or past metas in order to sell new cards. <br><br>They could have just as easily kept it to simple effects without need for massive searches, negations, destructions, monster stealing, etc. and still had the game move at a faster and move intelligible pace than MTG. <br><br>The game is in such a bad place because of these 'good cards' that it complete and utterly eradicates older cards almost every time to the point where only a handful of older cards are even worth a damn and only because they existed in a context of brokenness when they released as well. They have gotten to the point where they aren't going to power creep any further without literally banishing half the opponent's deck per ever special summon. <br><br>The game needs to be rebooted and fixed or at the very least start trying to follow both OCG/TCG banlists and stop creating such ridiculous cards such as S0 Hope Zexal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It died way earlier than that, my friend.</br>  <br>Yuya nearly won and the only reason he lost was because Jack pulled an Action Card out of his ass at the last minute.</br>  <br>O/TCG died when Xyz were created. Even Synchros could at least have been dealt with and the banlist wasn't nowhere near as retarded. There is a reason Zexal characters are like Super Saiyan Demonbanes, because their summoning method reflects it.</br>  <br>Yuya wouldn't have had one of his monsters if he hadn't used an action card, and had Rebellion attacked, Jack would have just negated it with his trap card. <br><br>Yuya was never in control from the moment he fusioned and xyz'd.</br></br></br>  Which Yu has the best summoning chant for their DRAGON  <br>That was just baffling, Minerva wasn't even a promo card. I was expecting something like Stardust Sifr.<br>If we're lucky, it'll be released in next year's World Superstars, but considering the fact that Blood Mephist and Number 106 STILL haven't been reprinted, I'm not so sure</br></br>  <br>Yuusei</br>  <br> stop creating such ridiculous cards such as S0 Hope Zexal. <br>BUY MORE HOPE<br>BUY MORE XYZ<br>BUY MORE RANK 4</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't have any hope for Minerva unless you want to spend $500+.</br>  <br><br>reminder that if he hadn't fused astro and chrono would've negated effects, letting odd-eyes win the duel</br></br>  <br>Pretty much that. Rule of thumb is to never put over somebody new at the expense of your main star. Yuya should NOT be jobbing at this stage of the game. There's a reason you have other characters. The other characters should be doing the job so when Yuya defeats the one who defeated new character he looks stronger. The point of battle stories is to put over someone, namely the main hero. I don't understand the reasoning of making Yuya job.</br>  <br>Yuya would have won if he didn't summon Rune-eyes.</br>  <br>The sad thing is almost all of the Arc-V cards are utter garbage compared to the current meta and you need luck draws on both sides just to be able to win, even against lower decks like Noble Knights. Xyz have completely and utterly ruined the game.</br>  <br> Shounen Shit eaters </br>  <br>The game needs a lot of things but Im neither a Konami rep that can change these things or the Mother Teresa to hear your crying, I play what gives me the best % of winning. Simple as that.<br>Reasons like emotional attachment or fake sense of honor it's shitter mentality, if you think like that you're not different from the people wanting to be like Kirito, a super special Gary Stu snowflake with your petdeck.<br><br><br> Necloth  <br><br>It's Nekroz in the TCG champ, try to keep up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Noble Knights <br> winning against anything </br></br>  <br> What is character progression </br>  <br>Reminder that anime Timegazer negates traps that TARGET. Reject Reborn doesn't.</br>  <br> Xyz have completely and utterly ruined the game. <br>Not really, powercreep has ruined the game.</br></br>  <br> Nekroz <br>Just as bad as Evilswarm.</br></br>  <br> Using TCG terms <br>Why would you do this?</br></br>  <br>The sad thing is many players will never enjoy the game outside the meta.</br>  <br>Yuto snapped, went full DRAGON against Academia, accidentally hurt Ruri.<br><br>Same thing will happen to Yuzu<br><br>Moral of the story, never go full dragon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I play what wins, doesn't mean it's any less stupid or any less fair. The decks and cards have gotten stupidly out of control, and KoA has no idea what they're doing with the banlist and cards. They think just banning Djinn and L. Chain will somehow fix the over-representation of Nekroz and some of the easy combos of the other decks, but it wont fix a damn thing. <br><br>What is the point of creating new cards like D/D/D, RR, IgKnights, etc. when they can't do a damn thing to any of the decks? The purpose of new cards is to sell, not sit on the back burner because you have already created such ridiculous cards that the power creep is getting to the point where it can't top them without either a reset on the whole system or massive bans like Dragon Rulers, and it's quite clear the latter is out of the question when they can't even get the banlist out at the appropriate time and then result to basically insulting the playerbase. The only cards that come out with any sense of power creep anymore are Xyz cards and the majority of them are piss ass easy Rank 4 Xyz. <br><br>Hell you could probably fix a lot of the problems just by fixing the fucking Ranks of the cards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's more that Rank 4's have given decks too much utility, especially with an extra deck at 15 cards.</br>  <br>Who is the target audience for Arc-V?<br><br>Kids.<br><br>Kids like simple stories with a relatable hero overcoming odds. If the hero does lose, it should never be done as a job. And more importantly there should be signs of foul play done by the adversary. If the hero has to lose, make him lose honorably.<br><br>For example Yugi was a good hero. He wasn't perfect by any means. But he was good at what he did and the few times he lost was because of things outside of the rules of engagement. <br><br>Yuya right now is to damn pathetic to root for. He is the complete opposite of what a hero should be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that Yuya isn't invincible is one of the best things about him. Rather than always being the ace like Yugi, Judai, and Yusei, because he isn't the best, you get a better sense of his growth.<br>They started something similar for Yuma, but it was poorly executed.<br><br>It also creates a better sense of tension. Yeah, we know as the protagonist, he'll win again, but the fact that he loses is better for storytelling.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These are the current TCG Official translations.<br>Don't tell me you actually use and say fanslations like Nephilim instead of Construct, Killer instead of Towers, Revise Dragon instead of Leviathan, etc.<br><br>That shit is weaboo "nippon banzai XD" as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'd be surprised actually, their equip spells can quickly over-whelm even some of the newer archetypes.<br><br>True, but a lot of Xyz have huge powercreeps. <br><br>Not unless they play very specified formats with their own custom banlists they wont.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you start to limit the extra deck, Synchros get hurt even more, not sure about Fusion or Xyz</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure shonen heroes like Naruto, Ichigo, Luffy, etc have been defeated at some point, only to later get a rematch and win</br>  <br>"Translations"<br><br>Just like how Utopia is a translation, right?</br></br></br>  <br>why do you want go through a hell like that?</br>  <br>Where the fuck do you think you are?</br>  <br>If done right you can feel tension even if the hero always wins in the end.<br><br>For example Pegasus was shown to cheat to win. Yugi lost not because he was bad at playing cardgames but because his opponent was a cheat.<br><br>Other examples include when he lost to Kaiba because he was willing to kill himself for a duel.<br><br>Yuya simply job to Jack, clean as a fiddle. No outside interference, no cheating.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I use the official names for the OCG like Odd Eyes Pendelum Dragon and Entermate Whip Viper. Get on my level.</br>  <br>While I agree that Konami is going full retard on the competitive stage, such problem is meaningless to them because the numbers (sales) speak by themselves.<br><br>The game is selling very good in the west because they catter to kids, Konami doesn't actually try to compete with Magic, the more mature game. They know they can't, and that's why our competitive scene prize and caring wise it's a joke.<br>The game also does good enough in Japan, even versus actual competence (Bushiroad).<br><br>Essentially as many times stated by Konami reps officially and extra oficially on DGZ, Konami doesn't care for the competitive scene because the big money comes from kids that doesn't even know what is the banlist.<br><br> What is the point of creating new cards like D/D/D, RR, IgKnights, etc. when they can't do a damn thing to any of the decks?  <br><br>Again, kids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuya's d ragon  is feeling funny.  <br> even versus actual competence (Bushiroad) <br><br>Only because their card games are even more shit.</br></br></br>  <br>And thus the tension is lost.<br><br>If you can show the the main character can win against the big bad so early in your story, where's the build-up? Where's the "getting stronger"?<br><br>The whole backbone of 80% of shounen stories is, "I will get stronger... MOTO STRONGER!"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was Levice Dragon?</br>  <br>Precisely, and I get that they like catering to kids, good on them, but at some point they've got to realize that when a kid goes to a tournament only to get bodied by some fat pretentious neckbeard and then proceed to talk about how the kid's deck is bad and he's a shitter, it ruins the community and makes the kids not even want to play anymore. I've sadly seen this before at locals, it's pathetic.<br><br>At some point they're going to have to realize that they need to cater to both ends of the spectrum, you can create new cards for kids while keeping the game balanced and competitive and reducing the power creep, it's not impossible.</br></br></br>    What's the best way to livestream this time around?    <br>Do kids really buy this shit?<br><br>I see more kids playing Magic or Vanguard, majority of Yugioh seems to be people in their late teens, early 20's.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>inly in our dreams anons...only in our dreams.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not using Nosferatu Lich and Thunder Bolt <br><br>You ain't wapanese enough.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much. A character losing shouldn't be a sign of weakness, it's a sign that he has to become stronger, everyone gets that.<br>Invincible heroes kill all tension</br></br></br>  <br> At some point they're going to have to realize that they need to cater to both ends of the spectrum <br><br>Considering that people like Julia, the leader of the entire official Judge program, goes and post shit like this, basically saying "lel why don't you go outside instead of playing yugayoh", I say it's not happening.</br></br></br>  <br>Konami only cares about Japan, where kids matter even more</br>  <br>Is this a flashback?</br>  <br>Very successful shows rarely show the hero losing. It's saved for important moments in the show. But it seems that Yuya is losing to much when it matters. Other times there was some excuse behind it but this time he simply did a job to Jack.</br>  <br>He's back?  This isn't old is it. </br>  <br>That's not what she's saying, jackass, she's say WE'RE NOT RELEASING THE LIST YET, STOP ASKING.</br>  <br>It has MLP type fandom issues.<br><br>Also its rarity structure/secondary market is awful.<br><br>I've heard its 13+ in nipland but damn the art sans a couple sluts is childish beyond belief. Deskbots being the face of me not believing its 13+.<br><br><br>CCGs are easier in Japanland. Murricans "bitch too much" to be worth a damn.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, kids make around 80% of the market, it's not a joke, even if you see neckbeards waste hundreds of $$$ getting their playset of Pink Dolphins and Brionacs from the Secret Forces, it's nothing compared to the actual money that comes from literally millons of kids asking their parents for boxes and shit after they see an episode.</br>  <br><br>Yes, flashback from episode 37 I think.</br></br>  Is the usual stream lagging like crazy?  <br> the actual money that comes from literally millons of kids asking their parents for boxes and shit after they see an episode. <br>And yet the Arc-V dub still hasn't been released despite most of the episodes being done already. GREAT BUSINESS MOVE KONAMI</br></br>  <br>It looks more choppy</br>  <br>You mean doyoutv?</br>  <br>Kids don't buy from the secondary market, and Konami doesn't get any profit from the secondary market, so they don't care that Brionac was $200 at one point.</br>  <br><br>Did someone says, noble knights?</br></br>  <br>Its kinda funny how much the card art has changed compared to how they looked early on.</br>  <br>I like the TCG art for the most part.</br>  <br> millions of kids asking their parents for boxes  <br> implying parents know what a yugioh is <br>I got these as a kid. Stacks of these stupid things are laying in a shoebox shoved in a dark corner.</br></br></br>  <br> Starter deck is out <br> Kids don't even know who Declan or Yuya are <br> Will have to find sets a year old for their favourite cards <br><br>Are the people at Konami literal retards?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since then, Konami has utterly shut down the black market. I haven't seen any counterfeit cards since the GX era</br>  <br>Sorry, I didn't mean kids that live in third world countries or in poorfags families like you anon.</br>  <br>I don't get it. Did he quit because you took his monster?</br>  <br> Are the people at Konami literal retards? <br>Yes, yes they are. Just look at what hapened with their console gaming department</br></br>  <br>It was a different time.<br><br>I still think GX was the right mix of DM's edgy shit and "modern" appeal art-wise.<br><br><br>Korea art is pretty nice too. I still wish TCG premieres were slightly more generic and good while OCG premieres for "weaker" decks didn't get hijacked.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Miracalous Feather Tower </br>  <br>The backs of packs say 12 and older, but there are loads of grade schoolers playing like any other game.</br>  <br>He drew no monster, opponent had a guaranteed summon with tuning.<br>Enough damage for kill.</br></br>  <br>I bet you think his Japanese name is actually "Aspiring Emperor."</br>  <br>Yes. He gave up instantly after drawing.</br>  <br>Well, I know enough Japanese to know it's literally "Hope Emperor Hope", which is a whole lot fucking different than Utopia.</br>  <br>It's literally "Hope King 'Hope'".<br><br>And we have the nerve to complain about Thunder King Thunder King.</br></br></br>  <br>As an aspiring translator, I wonder why counterfeiters don't put any effort whatsoever in these translations. Couldn't they just look up the names and th effects of the real cards and copy them?</br>  <br><br>King, not Emperor, fuck it's late</br></br>  <br>It just feels they put more effort in the designs. OCG designs are really lazy and basic most of the time.</br>  <br> Declan <br><br>I have something to confess. I fucking hate that name, Declan is such a fucking faggot name. I cannot stand it, I cannot accept it. Reiji it's a neutral non-faggot name, some may even say a badass name.<br>You can buy someone saying &gt;Reiji's made his rape face, shit is going down.<br>But Declan, you can't mix that name with anything good.<br><br>Even more, constantly I have this recurring dream where Reiji on America was named Rexy and everyone on the thread made shops non stop of the Jurassic World t-rex (rexy) on his face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there any working stream?  <br> Declan <br> Zuzu <br> Skip <br> Shay <br>What the fuck is up with the Dub and changing names</br></br></br></br></br>  So do you guys play YuGiOh or just watch it?
