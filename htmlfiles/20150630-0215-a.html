[ Bravo  Oh fuck, I didn't even catch that.<br><br>Literally bravo.</br></br>  <br>Ufo just loves those</br>  <br>True, some are easier to pick out than others though. Saber shots are from 19, and Shirou shots are from 20.</br>  <br>This shit though isn't even referencing anything Ufo's animated in the first place.</br>  <br>It's loveable</br>  <br> Bonfire Lit </br>  <br>Well done.</br>  <br>Goddammit that sloth mushroom playing vidya instead of keep up giving up good stories, at least he delivered.</br>  <br>Did F/Z have this amount of pottery?</br>    <br>I hate this one. They're not even remotely similar, what comparison are you trying to draw here?</br>  <br>is that archa and rin on the 2nd panel ?</br>  <br>dunno...</br>  <br>Dude, the intent of the scene is that they are similar. Saber outright says Shirou's copying Archer's style.</br>  <br>No, it's Archer and Bin; Rin's cousin.</br>  <br><br><br>Parry and then horizontal slash?<br> Kind of stretching it though </br></br></br></br>  <br>no, maybe, I don't know</br>  <br> Rin failed <br><br>Wow, I never interpreted the end of UBW this way.</br></br></br>  <br>couldn't really remember Rin wearing a white outfit and Archer having wraps on his arm.</br>  <br><br><br>Because Shirou = Saber parallel was official since the VN. That OP makes it even clearer, he's pulling fucking Caliburn.</br></br></br>    <br>First two images are from episode 5, where Rin and Shirou first become partners.<br><br>Last image is from some of the last shots of episode 25 where they say they'll have a happily ever after.</br></br></br>  they had sex off screen after holding hands. Camera panned out and sky darken  <br>Rin being the worst character is nothing new.</br>  <br>And we got this.</br>  <br> not the educated prostitute </br>  <br>Ahh thanks anon, So it was Shirou with the wraps.</br>  <br>She didn't fail. The after credits scene was symbolism.</br>  <br>Shit, wrong webm.</br>  <br> The after credits scene was symbolism. <br>who the fuck was talking about the after credits? Goddamn this autism triggers mine</br></br>  <br>Listen. Just because a rainbow tart decides to summon the best servant there is doesn't mean that she gets supreme executive authority over the throne of heroes. That is why Shirou broke her couch.</br>  <br>He grew some balls.</br>  <br> Lancer didn't crack the ground when he went fast <br><br>Is he slower than Archer?</br></br></br>  <br> sticking your dick into a can of worms </br>  <br>You should probably watch after the credits one more time.</br>  <br>People just tend to bring it up when people interpret the scene as Shirou still becoming Archer.</br>  <br>Better be something in the BDs.</br>  <br>Well there is no defending him there.</br>  <br>did Archer ever lose memory of his past in ep 00. Or was he pretending not to know</br>  <br>Canonically the second fastest after Achilles. But vn only fags will tell you servants outside of F/SN and HA don't count.</br>  <br>Shirou still becomes a hero, but he doesn't become Archer or anything like that. Nasu's notes for the scene confirm this.</br>  <br>It was a mistranslation.</br>  <br>drama cds</br>  <br>But Shirou from Fate and UBW will become Archer. Not a bitter jerk-Counter Guardian but still.</br>  <br>Pretending. It had been so long that he barely remembered Rin until that moment though. It was just by regular fading of long ago memories rather than failed summoning.</br>    <br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope. <br> Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait. <br> The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance. <br> (To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)" <br><br> He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point. <br><br>This?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer is a copy of the CG Emiya Shirou summoned into an Archer class container in the Grail War. Neither Fate Shirou or UBW Shirou are this person. Neither of them even make a contract with Alaya.</br>  <br>About speed does somebody has this ever been updated?</br>  <br>he maybe was somehow cloudy, but he seems to had recognized Rin, but apparently didn't remember her name. Everything was clear for him when he saw saber</br>  <br>So Nasu is retconning Shirou's fate then?</br>  <br> Tokiomi can maximize Gilgamesh's stats <br> Rin can't even maximize Emiya's <br>Rin BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>No, none of the Shirous in FSN become Archer. UBW in particular goes on to surpass Archer.</br>  <br>No shit, what else do you do with a sword? Play Catch?</br>  <br>Maybe she's inherently shit at being a master despite being a super magus. Like the opposite of Kariya.</br>  <br>Archer just tells half truths, he wasn't lying to her. He didn't remember her name, or the city at first, He had forgotten many things of his live in Fuyuki because of his time as a CG, he said that during his fight with shirou. He only remembers those things that marked him, the fire and Saber</br>  <br>He was lying to her. What she asked him was who he was and he said he didn't know. She didn't even ask him if he remembered stuff like that because she didn't know he was even from the modern age.</br>  <br>The QUALITY jesus</br>  <br>Ask Gilgamesh.</br>  <br>That's due to the fame bonus. Sort of.<br><br>Rin summoned Emiya prior to his ''kickass' time. Hakuno summoned him DURING that time so his stats get a boost as that was when he was 'famous' as it were.</br></br></br>  <br>People seems to constantly use the term "he'll become Archer" wrongly. I think what people are trying to say most of the time is that Shirou WILL become Heroic Spirit Emiya somehow. which makes more sense</br>  <br>He remembers Illya too.</br>  <br>Ok. So we know he goes to the middle east to escape from the clock tower because muh secreit reality marble. And he cooks there. Is he excelling in cooking? Last time I checked Shirou beat archer in cooking during UBW.</br>  <br>He doesn't so to speak. Whoever Shirou really is died in the fire.</br>  <br>Yeah from now on I'll probably use your wording.</br>  <br>He doesn't really remember who he was even as Shirou, so he wasn't lying that much, he's just a smug fucker.</br>  <br> Ok. So we know he goes to the middle east to escape from the clock tower because muh secreit reality marble <br><br>What? No. In fact he's staying in London for the next three years, it's just he's not going to become an official part of the Association. They don't have any beef with him. The desert scene was symbolism to show his determination and how he will go farther than Archer.<br><br>Alternatively it really is a future version of him and he's just wandering around the desert looking for people to beat up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He always said that UBW shirou wasn't going to be Archer.</br>  <br><br><br><br>failing in the hardest way possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's always only said that F/sn Shirou doesn't become Archer</br>  <br> I'm not content with the current state of my life </br>  <br>at the point he sees Illya I think he remember everything already. Also how can you froget about such a cute little big sister?</br>  <br>Right, so Fate, UBW, and HF Shirou don't become him.<br><br>Are you saying the anime version could?</br></br></br>  Rin's only charm is her morning mood. And compared to Luvia Rin is just a twin tailed old hag.  <br><br>Old Men<br><br>Money</br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't understand why Achilles isn't A++ in agility. They literally call him the fastest Servant there is with his noble phantasms.</br>  <br>I doubt any version of UBW can turn him into EMIYA. No matter how minor or big the change is, it's still UBW.<br><br>It all leads to the same thing.<br><br>Shirou vs Archer<br>Shirou vs Gilgamesh</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>DEEN fate Shirou is archer. That would explain why he's such a failure</br>  <br>Her real charm is<br> her anus <br>And the real reason she goes full dere years later.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin just ends up being Maiah mage edition.</br>  <br>Nah, they're gonna have a happy ending.</br>  <br><br><br><br>The paralel is just that both of them are salty because they are being delayed of their goal of becoming a seigi no mikata</br></br></br></br>  <br>And where is Rin?</br>  <br>dead</br>  <br>kidnapped by desert pirates.</br>  <br>She says outright she won't be following him constantly, so probably back at their house.</br>  <br>Killing Sakura and the Greater Grail with Waver</br>  <br>Who would've won between Deermud and Sasaki?</br>  <br><br>Why would she kill her own sister? It's not like HF, with the shadow as an imminent danger?</br></br>  <br>Sasaki if it in the temple. Deermud spears can't do shit against him since he's just a swordsman.</br>  <br>Sasaki he literally very dangerous up close.</br>  <br>Deermud can just poke him to death the Jap doesn't even have armor.</br>  Out of curiosity, does anyone have an image of Shirou at Sabers grave?  So if Illya is just a cup what makes it so that she can't resurrect if she gets enough mana?<br><br>pic unrelated</br></br>  <br>That's not how Sorcery works you dumbass. You'd have to invoke the third Sorcery, Heaven's Feel, in order to do something like that. You can't just power through it.</br>  <br>Well, in UBW the greater grail is still around</br>  <br>Luvia won that fight though</br>  In F/Z what was assassins NP?  <br>Sasaki is ridiculous in 1v1 melee combat through his combo of skills, geography and temple buffs, and TG. Cu gave no fucks about fighting full power Archer and Saber at the same time so long as he was on the defensive, but was nervous about taking on Sasaki 1v1. He's that good at dueling. The only way to beat him is either raw power, or sticking to ranged combat. Saber was also able to hax through him because Instinct is OP, without it she would have been killed in their first battle.<br><br>tl;dr Deermud would get rolled.</br></br></br>  <br>Same one in HF right?</br>  <br>I havent gotten into Fate, just watched F/Z and F/SN for enjoyment sake. didn't understand why assassin had alot of bodies, just assumed they were mana coppies or illusions of some sort</br>  <br>It was Zabaniya: Delusional Illusion which was the ability to give all of it's multiple personalities their own separate bodies.</br>  <br>If only Caster bothered buffing the fucker, although she probably would if Berserker came for a visit.</br>  <br>Can Ilya save her from the curse of Emiya?</br>  <br>Why does Ufotable think the human face is a trapezoid?</br>  <br>They really didn't explain it all that well in the animation or VN. Honestly its a question for LN and material notes fags alike. <br><br>Who is Miyu? Is she really Shirou's long lost little sister?</br></br></br>  <br> Miyu <br>You'll know when she gets Angry</br></br>  <br>If you look closely, you can see that the distance between Saber's chin and the tip of her nose has increased between the HGWs</br>  <br><br>We'll know for sure next month. My money's on her being the sister who died in the fire in normal F/SN.</br></br>  <br><br>She's angra mainyu incarnation</br></br>  <br>For some reason I thought the fire still happened a long with everything else in F/Z. Why is she homeless if Shirou is with Illya and friends? Why are all the Eizenberns dead?<br><br> Miyu <br> You'll know when she gets Angry <br>That is funny anon. Your a funny guy. Goddam that was good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who is Miyu? <br>In Prisma Illya, she is  the Lesser Grail (like Ilya and Irisveil) of an alternate universe's Holy Grail War. Unlike Ilya and Iri, she isn't a homunculus, but was naturally born with the prana capacity of a Lesser Grail (this prana capacity is what makes her and Ilya most suitable for the Kaleidosticks). She was somehow sent to Ilya's universe, along with the Class Cards, by Miyu's brother who sent her away to protect her from the Ainsworths (their universe's much more competent and active equivalent of the Einzberns). After some heavy foreshadowing in 2wei, we find out in 3rei that Miyu's brother is in fact an alternate Emiya Shirou. <br> Is she really Shirou's long lost little sister? <br> Everything indicates she really is Shirou's little sister by blood. We don't really know the details since Miyu's world is very different from the F/SN-esque world of Prisma Illya (it's closer to how Earth was described in Fate/Extra, and will eventually become something like the world of Notes), but the next chapter is actually supposed to be about their backstory. <br>As far as other continuities, I believe Shirou only ever mentions remembering his mother's face in F/SN, nothing about the rest of his family (if he had anyone else at all). It's not impossible that he had a baby sister who died in the fire, but there's nothing suggesting he did either.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought he mentioned walking where his house used to be and mentioned that he'd had a baby sister somewhere in the VN.</br></br>  <br>The fire never happened in Prisma; Kiritsugu and Irisveil aborted the Fourth (First, in Prisma's continuity) Holy Grail War long before it started to protect Ilya. Though, the Greater Grail still exists.<br> Why is she homeless if Shirou is with Illya and friends? <br>She's  from an alternate universe , which is somewhat foreshadowed when they mention things like  Luvia forging identity records for her .<br> Why are all the Eizenberns dead? <br>It's very strongly implied that Kerry and Irisveil flat-out killed them all. Which leaves questions like "why do Sella and Liz still even exist" in the air, but you can chalk stuff like that up to alternate timeline shenanigans, just like everyone except Ilya being their F/SN age while Ilya is actually only as old as she looks.<br><br><br>I'm almost certain he doesn't mention a sister.<br>Do you remember if that scene was from Fate route or Heaven's Feel?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Which leaves questions like "why do Sella and Liz still even exist" in the air <br>Go read F/HA. Great stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>It was either Fate or UBW. I remember very clearly he mentioned a sister. Maybe someone can clarfy either way.</br></br>  <br>EAT<br>SLEEP<br>PLEASE OLD MEN FOR MONEY<br>REPEAT</br></br></br></br>   just found out various fate franchises are on manga that I didn't know about previously     <br>I know what they are, the issue is that in F/SN they're only two years old and were created specifically to facilitate Ilya's role as a Master.<br>Obviously the circumstances of their creation must have been different in Prisma, but it's not such a major issue, there's no reason they couldn't have just been created earlier.</br></br>  <br>Rider is can run faster.<br><br>Lancer isn't actually as fast as the real GOTTA GO FAST servant's top speed, hes just got fucking amazing acceleration and reaches his top speed damn near instantly.</br></br></br>  <br>You're blowing my mind here man. So your questioning why they were made in the first place? Illya was supposed to be a supreme master/cup combo before Kiritsugu and Irisviel killed all the Einzberns off. And I'm pretty sure Liz supports illya in some magical way so that is the reason why she exists. What if they find out the truth?</br>  <br><br>He's also not the same Emiya as the one from Stay Night.</br></br>  <br>MOTHERFUCKER SUPLEX A TRAIN</br>  <br> Cu gave no fucks about fighting full power Archer and Saber at the same time so long as he was on the defensive, but was nervous about taking on Sasaki 1v1. <br><br>What when was this</br></br></br>  <br><br>But the gif shows absolutely nothing even remotely similar.</br></br>  <br>He didn't approach the temple to scout out caster.</br>  <br>Could be for a number of reasons (he got too caught up in Archer/Saber or Kotomine already pre-scouted them). He didn't scout out Rider nor Herc either. That's an extrapolation at best.</br>  <br>You'd think Kirei would have just okay'd him to throw a javalin and dip, not like he could dodge it or had anywhere to go oherwise.</br>  <br> He didn't approach the temple to scout out caster. <br>But that's exactly what he's doing before  he gets wrecked by the Shadow  in Heaven's Feel</br></br>  <br>He said as much just prior to the church fight in UBW. Episode 16 if I recall is the anime episode if you wanna quickly check.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Is this all the Pottery?<br><br>That can't be all the Pottery.<br><br>Is there more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 16 had the church where the three-way happened in Fate.</br>  <br> Fate adaption confirmed? </br>  <br>You mean where Sakura tore Kriei a new one?</br>  <br> this prana capacity is what makes her and Ilya most suitable for the Kaleidosticks <br>What's that supposed to mean? You don't need an excessive amount of prana, since Kaleidosticks provide you with it.</br></br>  <br>Don't they provide you with an infinite amount?<br><br>How is it even possible to lose?</br></br></br>    How is there not a comparison with Berserker's fight against Gil and Shirou vs Gil?  <br>Because Bazett and Dariuses skill sets are good against mages and card-Servants are still Servants?</br>   <br>Except Rin didn't join in on the fun.</br>  <br>His burst speed is higher than Rider's.<br>He's called "the fastest heroic spirit" multiple times in the VN.<br>Apocrypha retconned that with Achilles</br></br></br>  <br>Rin's a spoilsport.</br>    Is Shirou getting cucked while doing hero things in the Middle East?  <br>I demand more Pottery/Parallels.</br>  <br>Rin literaly says that she'll come with him</br>  <br>No, Rin lusts only for The Shirou.</br>  <br>But he was alone in the desert?</br>  <br>Why is Rin getting mad at the fact that she won the Shirou and gets to kiss him?</br>  <br>Rin walking towards Shirou at the end of ep24<br>Shirou walking towards Rin in the ED.</br></br>  <br>That spinning around in Zero was kinda cool the first time i saw it. But now that i see it again it looks like they were bullying Kirei.</br>  <br><br>She hates that personality. A such a woman is dangerous for Shirou.</br></br>  <br>That was symbolism you fucking imbecile</br>  <br>Because that's future Dere Rin talking to her younger self and teasing her.</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br><br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head.

It's Rin we are on about.</br></br>  <br>That bottom pic is lewder than the top one.</br>  <br>I wonder how Sakura would react to talking to Future Rin.</br>  <br>There's also the question of why Shirou is still adopted by Kerry and Iri. Why Taiga is still an english teacher with a crush on Kerry, Why Sakura is a Matou when both of Rin's parents are still alive, Why Caren and Kotomine both exist, Why Bazett still has Lancer's earrings and why Shirou has the hero complex still. It's just a fanfic that made money by selling loli ass.</br>  <br> We don't know yet <br> implying Waver won't seduce her in time when he checks on how Rin and Luvia are doing <br> implying we know if Rin's parents are alive <br><br>Was Caren confirmed to be from the Miyuverse?<br><br>Isn't Bazett a descendant of his?<br><br> implying Shirou will ever stop being a hero of justice </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That scene needs drilling noises.</br>  <br> Studio WIT reuses drawings for SnK until oblivion <br> Levi Hitler meimei <br> Ufotable reuses absolutely everything, from scenario to le light effects <br> "Pottery" <br>Epic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://data.archive.moe/board/gif/<wbr>image/1435/49/1435492063164.webm</wbr></br>  <br>Nigger you blind?

Really could've used more exaggeration on Rin's end.  <br> &gt;implying Shirou will ever stop being a hero of justice <br><br>But he only became that because his old self died in the fire.

Do they mean a CG or do they mean a magic using hero of justice?  <br>Unhappy sad ending Magic using Hero of Justice.</br>  <br>Here is a parrelel and pottery within itself. Literally the same model being flung over and over again across the gap in the door.</br>  <br> Shirou <br> white hair <br> desert <br>Yeah rewatch the episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, to become "Archer" he must make a pack with Alaya.</br>  Hes going to need a lot of bones for all those swords. Tohsaka Rin's anus is a nightmare.  <br>The former, he becomes Archer 2.0 and surpasses Archer that was kinda the point of the route. But people will ignore that to shitpost.</br>  <br>How are Saber's and Sakura's anus?</br>    <br>That's Archer.</br>  <br>That's Archer.<br><br>This is Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>:^) Nice bait, I got caught.</br>  <br>We never saw Saber's anus. Sakura "honey pot" Matou however.</br>  <br>This is archer. That is Shirou.</br>  For someone with an unrealistically strong case of survivor's guilt, Shirou never thinks of his birth family or any other people who died in the fire. He's upset over him surviving the fire but he never connects it to the victims in his speeches and monologues  WHERE THE FUCK IS THE FATE ROUTE UFOTABLE<br>PLEASE</br>    <br>After the Tsukihime anime adaptation.</br>  <br>So Archer remembering is a pure retcon right?</br>  <br> He's upset over him surviving the fire <br>Huh?</br></br>  <br>What if UBW Shirou became a Heroic Spirit without the contract?<br><br>Would it just be a different form of EMIYA?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She has seen that maneater personality because Shirou is weak to straight affection with seductive tones. She has seen her sister employ it.<br><br>It's why she starts the conversation asking if it's Sakura playing a prank. You notice how many scenes Sakura just sweeps him off his feet, like the one where she has her kouhai take a couple self while they are out shopping.<br><br>Rin knows such a woman bags the Shirou easily when she goes all out. It's why Nasu says Sakura has the highest seduction quotient of the three heroines, and will "ruin" her man with her charms.<br><br>Rin knows. It just took her other self longer to get to that point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you want it from UFO? Everyone hated this adaptation, better if another studio does it.</br>  <br>So, in 3-4 years if we're lucky Nasu releases the remake after Dark Souls 3?</br>  <br> Shirou has survivors guilt <br><br>No he wants to become a hero of justice just like his old grand pappy.</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaptation <br><br>Good meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes he would be called Heroic Spirit Shirou.</br>  <br>Give it to DEEN</br>  <br>Rewatch the conversation about Kiritsugu he had with Rin or any of his flashbacks to the fire<br>Or, you know,  read the VN </br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaptation <br>No.</br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaption <br> UFO is still doing Heaven's Feel <br> Only one route would be left and it'd make the most money </br></br></br>  <br>Notice the differences in skin and hair.</br>  <br>Nice projecting nigger</br>  <br> everyone <br>Dayum I got that empty feel after finishing this again.<br>And I havent had that in a loong time</br></br></br>  <br>Rin barely has any Tsun to begin with it only comes out when she is shy and getting comfortable with each other fixes that. Episode 25 showed her full dere side.</br>  <br>The only point in the VN when he has survivor guilt is when he finds the children under the church. And it only happens at that moment because he realises who these people are, it's not longstanding.</br>  <br>Well meme'd</br>  <br><br> Fate adaptation <br><br>Not happening</br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone hated this adaption <br><br>Finally. Someone who agrees with me. They fucked Emiya up. And the fight between Shirou with Redman was completely retarded at one point Shirou's feet doesn't even touch the ground and he FLYS over Archers head with broken bones everywhere. And the art style was pretty terrible. Every character has the same facial structure most apparent was the nose. This being said I have to give UFO props for being completely dead on in everything else. They really could have fucked it up.</br></br></br>  <br>People said Ufo could never adapt fate even to begin with.<br>What says they wont do it all?</br></br>  <br>Archer and Hakuno adventures in the Middle East when?</br>  Volume 12 is going to be released  someday . Don't give up hope!  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Volume 10,5 OVA fucking when.<br><br><br>The ride just won't end huh?<br/></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br>pls shaa~ sound webm</br>  <br>http://a.uguu.se/aqmguq_shaaa.webm</br>  Anyone else wanna see this series extend by about two volumes or so? I think WW can add a half chapter somehow, then finish off the series with Volume 12.  Yukino is at her weakest point right now.<br>This is going to be a very long wait.<br>Watari, don't fuck us on this one. You've been building up to this for over half the series. This had better pay off.</br></br>  so is volume 12 confirmed to be the last one?  <br>Learn from Irohafags' example: Expect the worst but hope for the best.<br><br><br>Confirmed? Nah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>where does the light novel pick up after this?</br>  <br>My heart</br>  <br>I am dumb and this isn't working for me.</br>  <br> Learn from Irohafags' example: Expect the worst but hope for the best. <br>There is wisdom in those words but this is an entirely different matter.<br>Yukino is the main heroine of this series. If Watari doesn't handle her character development correctly then he has failed as a writer.</br></br></br>   just finish watching ep 13 <br> No idea what was happening <br>AM I A FUCKING RETARD? I don't even know what was their problem</br></br>  <br>We need a movie for vol 10.5</br>  Irohasu!  <br>Volume 12, 6 months from now.<br>The anime covered everything.<br>If you want more content reread the entire series from the start. The anime skips over A LOT.</br></br></br>  At least I got to see her one last time  <br> The anime covered everything. <br> The anime skips over A LOT. <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. The whole "hurting eachother is part of genuine" thing set up both the main heroines an gigantic window to fail.<br><br>It would be trivial for Watari to sink either one of them and it wouldn't negative the writing whatsoever.</br></br></br>   pls help one day, i'm autistic,spoilt and rich but i got problems okay ;_; t-his isn't forced drama or anything just GENUINE problems, btw i want ur dick   How can 8man be genuine with Yukino when Sensei forced him into the club with her to solve her problems?  <br> Volume 10,5 OVA fucking when. <br>Hopefully soon, capt'n.<br><br>Irohasu~</br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that vol11 and 12 translation never because spyro is an autistic yukinofag who even deleted some iroha parts in novel 10</br>  <br>One of them getting hurt =/= Yukino's character development being thrown out the window for drama<br><br>I don't see where you made that connection.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> even deleted some iroha parts in novel 10 <br>Prove it.</br></br>  <br>That's not the point of genuine. Genuine isn't just being able to accept eachother's feelings, it's being able to accept them being rejected as well.<br><br>What made the Tobe/Ebina situation non-genuine wasn't that he couldn't confess, it's that he couldn't confess without the group falling apart. "Not that close" and all that.<br><br>Watari could easily sink the main heroines, with them being able to accept that and preserve their group as the resolution of their efforts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can't tell the difference between ships and character development then there's no reason to keep talking. This conversation is over.</br>  <br> that pic <br>Fucking why. Literally why.</br></br>  <br>Yukinon's cookies defy logic.<br>Don't question them.</br></br>  <br>And why is that bait?<br>am I bait too for asking?</br></br>  <br> romance isn't character development <br>At least you tried.</br></br>  <br><br>Yukino a shit.<br>She has been nothing but a pile of dramas since volume 6. <br><br>Even if she manage to fix herself in the final volume, she will still be remembered as the damsel in distress who have done nothing but having others save her ass every volume. <br><br>I can't even think of a way for her to redeem her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's why you aren't the one in charge of writing her character.</br>  So is there a  fanfic somewhere where Haruno shits on Hayato in front of his friends and they all try to white-knight for him but Haruno proceeds to tear them apart by exposing to them just how shit Hayato really is? <br><br>Because I just realized that I like Hayato's friends less than I like Haruno.</br></br>  <br>Hayama is a good guy</br>  <br>we need a movie or two to wrap things up, hopefully in 2-3 years</br>  <br>fuck off with your memes</br>  Ok, so who the fuck do I have to kidnap to get a 10,5 OVA?  <br> nearly an hour of newspaper-making <br>Please god no.</br></br>  <br>More like 40 minutes of Iroha date being adapted wonderfully, the rest would be the newspaper and it's comedy moments.<br>But I must say that an OVA is much better for that.</br></br>  <br>The date probably wouldn't need all that much time to adapt at all. 8man spends an entire day with Iroha yet they only do like 4 things.</br>  <br>Not confirmed, but very likely. Although I fear with Oregairu's popularity and success at the moment WW will turn into a shilling hack and needlessly extend the series more than it should be.</br>  <br> The date probably wouldn't need all that much time to adapt at all. <br>Yeah I know, don't mind me. That was just my Irohafaggotry showing.</br></br>  I am convinced Watari hates Yukino and will end her with Hayama.  <br> 8man spends an entire day with Iroha yet they only do like 4 things. <br> mfw Watari writes a script to extend the date </br></br>  <br><br>Nothing whatsoever has been said about it being the last. Not sure why you'd assume it is. There's still a hefty amount of plot to get through.</br></br>  Why does irohafags always tries to make her seem more relevant than she actually is? She just replace komachi because komachi is busy with exams and shit. It's getting annoying to be honest.  What will you guys be expecting from the new Yahari VN?<br><br>Hopes and dreams that will be shattered by Vol .12?</br></br>  <br>People think there will only be 12 volumes because that's what Watari's contract says, he can still write more but 12 volumes is a requirement.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> What will you guys be expecting from the new Yahari VN? <br> An English translation. <br> And Miura route. </br></br></br>  <br>Please go back to your containment thread.</br>  <br>He better fucking write more than 12.</br>   Want to get Yui Windows 7 theme. <br> Its all pink. <br><br>Decisions, Decisions.</br></br></br>  <br>The .5 books don't count as part of the contract?</br>    <br> it's not Saturday yet, anon </br>  <br>Most likely since they are more like side stories.</br>  <br> she just replaces the character that 8man loves more than anyone else <br><br>She sounds pretty relevant to me.</br></br></br>  <br> she replaces komachi <br>That is why she will always have my hatred.</br></br>  <br>I like the new deredere Yukino but she'll be better when she sorts her problems out. At least 8man has told her to basically get a grip now.</br>  <br> she just replaces the character that 8man loves more than anyone else <br><br>Nah, the one that 8man ever say love to are Zaimokuza, Komachi, SakiWho, saika. Guess how relevant they are.</br></br></br>  <br> liking moeblob Yukino compared to the s1 Goddess <br><br>I'm sorry, we can't be friends.</br></br></br>  <br> someday </br>  <br>The date seems really weirdly written. Is it normal in Japan to spend like 5 hours chatting in a cafe? Because they eat lunch, go to the cafe, and then it's dark. Watari doesn't even do a "we walked around some more looking at stores" handwave to explain where the time went.</br>   Yukinofags think Yukino is a different character now. <br><br>She's the same useless girl guys.</br></br>  <br> 8man loves Komachi more than anyone else <br> Komachi is irrelevant <br> Iroha is irrelevant. she just replaced Komachi, who 8man loves mores than anyone else </br></br></br>  <br>You really need to read that chapter again.</br>  <br>I liked the Ice Queen from S1 but it's nice to see her like this if only for a while, after that it's painful to see her this way.<br><br>Hopefully she does get passed this.</br></br></br>  <br>What were they talking about?</br>  <br><br>To be revealed.<br><br> But The LN. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Were they going to  Saize ?</br>  <br>He planned to go there</br>  <br>It can't be helped.<br><br>His favorite heroine is totally useless in this volume compared how she is in previous volumes.<br><br>No wonder he has no motivation to do translation anymore.<br><br> tfw you realise your waifu is shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless Spyro omitted something, it's true. 8man finishes kicking Iroha's ass at ping pong at 11 o clock, they go to lunch, and then go to the cafe. There was a bit of walking, but 8man mentions being warm from the ramen just as they get to the cafe, so it couldn't have been that long.<br><br>He does also mention they were chatting inside the cafe too long, and it's getting dark when they leave.<br><br>Really not sure how that could be interpreted as anything other than them being in the cafe for a long-ass time unless winter in Japan makes it get dark at like 2 PM.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> We pondered over places we could eat at as we walked around. <br><br> “If you’re okay with anything, then… Saizeriya sounds good.” <br><br> Isshiki shook her head in rejection. Come on, didn’t you just say you were fine with anything…? In the end, I had to take into consideration some of Isshiki’s needs when I answer. <br><br>She had the class not to laugh in his face over it. Not bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't that long, that was during winter when the daylight lasts a lot less than usual.</br>  <br><br><br> Saize </br></br></br>  <br> teaching him how to deal with girls <br>Based Iroha.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Alright.Whats with this Saize ridicule going on? Is there some deep Chiba culture at work here?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> His favorite heroine is totally useless in this volume compared how she is in previous volumes. <br><br>She has been useless since dayone.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm fine with anywhere <br> Okay, how about this place? <br> Are you kidding me? I'm not fine with that. <br><br>I don't have any experience with women but this sounds incredibly annoying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SORE ARU</br>  <br>it gets completely dark by 5pm in japan's winter. so getting dark by 3~4ish when they leave the cafe sounds about right.</br>  <br>Iroha CGs.</br>  <br> Since dayone. <br><br>I love you for your puns.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, me too. More Haruno pls.</br>  Don't mind me, just dropping some Iroha foreshadowing.  At this point I'll be happy if anyone but Yukinoshit wins.  <br> He does also mention they were chatting inside the cafe too long, and it's getting dark when they leave. <br> chatting <br> too long <br><br>I smell something here.  Did they also go to a love hotel "for practice"? <br><br>Joke aside, now I understand why he was scared to the recipe blackmail, spending 5+ hours with a girl alone in a cafe is nowhere near "safe"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man fell for the exact same thing when he brought up Saize with Orimoto.<br><br>Iroha's just teaching him about girls, in his monologue he even feels like he got more out of the date than Iroha did.</br></br></br>  <br> CR </br>  <br>That still leaves them in the cafe for a really long time. The LN makes it sound like they literally go straight from the ramen place to the cafe.</br>  <br>No wonder he wants something genuine.</br>  <br><br>Why is 5 hours too long? I always thought chatting on dates would go for longer than that. Heck, just loitering and walking around is the usual stuff.</br></br>  <br>Now that you mention it, FFF has that episode out.<br><br>Still, they don't really butcher the meaning. Though just saying "type" rather than "your type" is a mistake. (Hayama specifically says 好きのタイプ in that line)</br></br></br>  Got the image from another thread.<br><br>Can't believe I wasted three month on btb.</br></br>  <br>they spent that days to know more about each other. Haven't you notice that after the date 8man seeing Iroha differently (to the point he stopped talking picture in the library, which never happen before)?</br>  <br>I can only speak for myself, but the thought of spending several hours on small talk makes me want to kill myself.<br><br>Also it would imply that the cafe makes up the majority of the date, yet they basically timeskip through it. I guess it's for the sake of keeping the reader from knowing more than they need to about 8man/Iroha's relationship at this point in time.<br><br>That said, 8man has a negative narrative bias, so the fact he didn't have much of anything to say about their time in the cafe implies it was productive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*scratches head*<br>not that impt to me but walking around does take more time than people usually realize it takes. maybe the trip from ping pong centre to ramen place took longer than it seemed? likewise from ramen place to cafe.</br></br>  <br>well, i'm not surprised if Spyro will be down becus his fav character is in the lowest condition but I don't think he should be disappointed forever becus watari will write her growth for us to see (Haruno mentioned growth to 8man before, so I think that will be the moment Yukino will reach too).<br><br>vol 11 will be dark arc of Yukino , vol 12 will be gray arc of Yukinoshita siblings. and the final will be her geniune form.<br><br>so , I want to give some courage to Spyro a bit but I don't know he will read my comment or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is the author's way of saying that she doesn't win, isn't it?  <br>Not 5 hours, but a couple of hours. Remember that after eating ramen, they changed places and went to that cafe in another district, so they spend time walking<br><br> While we were lethargically chatting over pointless things and enjoying our sweets, we were apparently sitting inside for too long. <br><br>Now that I have read the date chapter again, I realized 8man mentioned "glossy lips" twice.<br><br>Also,the theory about her being a poorfag isn't that off, since it's mentioned she was wearing knitted sweater and kept receipts (yeah, I know she used those to blackmail him, but still she looks very familiar with asking for receipts)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She won't win, but she has won over my heart</br>  <br><br>Well with 8man, he does engage in conversations properly with Iroha. He would always be comfortable and proper.</br></br>  <br> “There’s like a lot of nice stores if we go that way,” Isshiki said, hastily walking on. The direction she headed in veered slightly away from the town center and led to a subdued street with a park, offices, and apartments. <br><br> We passed the front of the central station and walked down a street that had gone through maintenance relatively recently. This area, unlike the crowded “pick-up” street, was sparse with buildings. <br><br> Having had my fill of ramen, I was feeling nice and warm—and I wouldn’t say I wanted to go home at this instant—but I wasn’t very fond of walking for long periods of time. <br><br> I looked at Isshiki wondering how much longer this was going to take and she pointed ahead with a smile. “You see that? It’s that store over there.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she knits her own sweaters that's hella kawaii</br>  <br><br><br><br>All this talk about genuine gives me a good laugh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The recurring "sugar, spice, everything nice" theme, as well as occasional dialogues/monologues about what girls are like, suggest that the date is when 8man starts to see Iroha as a girl. It's also about him getting a better understanding of girls in general, as he ultimately relates some of his experience to Yukino and Yui toward the end.<br><br>It's no surprise that he both seems more conscious of the club members, and his interactions with Iroha start escalating pretty quickly, after the date. Iroha's a driving force behind Yahari's romantic plot.<br><br><br>The receipts weren't just to blackmail him, they were so she could deduct the costs from the student council fund. (Remember, one of the reasons for the date was to put the stores in the newspaper)<br><br>That said I wouldn't be surprised in the least if she's a poorfag. She's really, really good at using her time and money efficiently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  these threads got me thingken<br><br>thingken of<br><br>thingken of genuine</br></br></br></br>  <br>top kek</br>  If Yukino was just a cynical icequeen who wins/loses the 8bowl within 7-8 volumes, this could've been a good anime.  <br> Iroha's a driving force behind Yahari's romantic plot. <br>sore aru!</br></br>  <br>Moonfag here, 8man stares at and mentions her lips on multiple occasions on volume 11.<br>I wonder why.</br></br>   Control + F "genuine" <br> 9 results <br> Out of 113 posts <br>You disappoint me, yahari.</br></br></br>  <br> Alright, now that we’re done eating, let’s go home! <br> At least, that’s what I wanted to say, but we were still walking around the town of Chiba. <br> 7 lines later <br> Having had my fill of ramen, I was feeling nice and warm—and I wouldn’t say I wanted to go home at this instant—but I wasn’t very fond of walking for long periods of time. <br><br> Scoring after the cafe <br><br> “Why the heck is it so low…?” <br> I thought I tried pretty hard, you know? Yeah? Aren’t you being just a little unfair? I gave Isshiki a discontent look and she raised both of her hands that were covered with mittens. <br><br> “And if we include your behavior and conduct, that’s a total of minus forty points, okay?” <br> “I guess that’s fair.” I nodded back naturally. If anything, the fact that I lost only that much points meant I did well. Though it might’ve been more due to Isshiki’s lenience than my hard work. <br> “So you were aware of it…” <br><br>Jesus 8man could you be any more tsundere?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe Wataru wanted to kiss his kouhai.<br><br>Btw, is volume 11 any good? I can read moon but not that fluent so I tend to avoid the trouble. But since english translation isn't deliver anytime soon, I might have the motivation to read the raw. So is it any good?</br></br></br>  <br>In Watari's twitter he mentions 艶めいた唇, which is glossy and enigmatic lips (google TL). Does he use the same words in the LN?</br>  <br>He's almost out of tsun tsun in volume 11.<br>I really hate Watari for doing this shit, they have ridiculously good chemistry and yet won't end up together.</br></br>  <br>She's his type, it'll happen.</br>  <br>I don't hate Iroha but I hate when this shit happens.<br><br>"The last girl to appear has the fastest advancement and greater compatibility with the MC, leaving the other heroines in the dust."<br><br>This only leave everyone bitter and salty for the fans of the older heroines whether they win or lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Btw, is volume 11 any good? <br>It's good unless you really don't want to see Yukino's character plummet.<br><br><br>Literally TLs into 'glossy lips' or 'alluring lips' and if you want to force it into an even less common TL, it could be taken as 'sexy looking lips' or something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a cunt, that's what he is.</br>  <br>So Watari used the same words to describe his kouhai and Iroha lips? Someone should teach him not to be so obvious</br>  <br> Does he use the same words in the LN? <br>Sorry for taking this long, I had to grab my volume 10,5 real quick.<br>And yes, he uses the same fucking words twice.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not only watari, it's pretty much almost universal for haremshit SoL</br>  <br>Not that anon, but I actually agree and I personally jumped on the Irohaship very early. <br><br>Most of the time it is done very poorly, and usually only so that the author can shove in some comedic jealously moment. But while Watari definately uses that aspect quite a great deal, I say he does a really good job of making Iroha stand on her two feet. <br><br>The late game girl usually has minimal actual character, and is literally there solely to bring about new shades of other characters. Placed alone and she wouldn't be compelling whatsoever.<br><br>Iroha on the other-hand, at least in my opinion, is interesting in of herself, and she doesn't need the other heroines around her to make her moments shine.<br><br><br>It wouldn't surprise me personally, she definitely seems to have the mentality of "I'm going to marry a rich dude and have an easy life". Poor families usually instill that kind of thought process into their kids intentionally or not; so she might have fostered her "cute girl" appeal with that intent in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember, she wants to marry an editor who could make large money</br>  <br>Iroha confirmed for poorfag</br>  What went wrong?  <br>It's realistic though. If two people have great compatibility they'll lock into place so quick it'll make everyone else's heads spin. Chemistry is often considered the strongest thing in romance.<br><br>If you think about it, "love at first sight" is simply what happens when a writer tries to turn chemistry up to the highest level possible.<br><br>That said even if it's realistic, doesn't mean it's always handled well. I think Yahari is a pretty good example of it being handled well. Two people don't need to go through mountainous amounts of bullshit to fall in love, it's a very natural thing that can happen easily between the right people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well i am Yuifag but i am with <br> "The last girl to appear has the fastest advancement and greater compatibility with the MC, leaving the other heroines in the dust." <br><br>It was completely opposite compared Yui x Hikki development<br><br>For me I like how Yui keep loving 8man more despite every odds is against her.<br><br>It's like She want to obtain something impossible and yet she can't be helped herself to keep trying obtain it.<br><br>I guess try hard girl is totally my type.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both she and 8man want to marry a rich person and just stay home all day, and yet both of them can actually do work just fine when required.</br>  <br>So does 8man. Those two just have the same mindset, part of their chemistry</br>  <br>She also wants 8man to become an editor.</br>  <br><br>Best couple.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127338718 <br> author <br>It's editor</br></br>  <br>Oh I know, and I'm a Yuifag too. <br><br>Yui's action increase the possibility of either her or Yukino end by not insignificant margin.<br><br>I just hate how "Iroha appears, instant healing you fuckers!". Literally exist there to cocktease the faggots.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lazy people works harder.</br>  <br>I don't think any threads have made me irrationally angrier than these.</br>  <br>Lazy people work smarter*</br>  <br> not getting the reference <br>I am disappoint.</br></br>  <br>Wat reference?</br>  <br><br>Well as an Irohafag I admit you do have a point, but that's kind of a hallmark part of Yui and 8man's relationship. She tries really hard to understand him but really can't, which makes it really hard for her to interact with him more since she can't get past his barriar. Which, again, makes it harder for her to understand him.<br><br>Then comes someone like Iroha who pretty much instantly comes to an understanding with 8man. So if Yui ever comes to learn the full details of their date aside from just the cafe, I imagine her reaction would be far more negative than her pretty passive one in reaction to the picture. <br><br>Basically being Yui is pretty fucking terrible, and I really do sympathize with you guys. At least volume 11 bumped up your chances instead of sinking it like we thought it would.<br><br><br>I know right? This was literally the first season where I closed threads out of sheer frustration with the shitposting to actual posts ratio.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There, Isshiki tapped my shoulder. When I turned around, her eyes sparkled and as if to talk in secret, she placed her hand to her mouth and whispered near my ears. “Senpai, I recommend becoming an editor.” <br> “I won’t become one, I won’t work, and I won’t look for a job.” I answered, while twisting my body to get away from the fluffy smell of Anna Sui and her ticklish breaths. <br><br> Anna Sui <br><br>What does it smell like and is it  expensive ? Teiuka, how does 8man tell its Anna Sui?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Anna Sui <br>Holy shit, poorfag nothing.<br><br>If she's actually poor, she probably starved herself trying to buy it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw she starved herself to buy it just for that date with 8man </br>  <br><br>triple dubs.</br></br>  <br>I don't know man.<br><br>I got a feeling that Yui actually understand 8man more than you imagine but she herself is not confident of it.<br>Just look how she expect 8man would to do another genuine speech by doing her action in volume 11.<br>Even in LN there's so many scene where she is reading his mind like text book especially in volume 10,5. <br>I think her understanding of him come from how she keep watching him in class and used together with him for a long time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She tries really hard to understand him but really can't <br><br>What are you even talking about.<br><br>If anything, volume 11 just shown us that out of all the girls Yui is the one who understand 8man the most.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's foreshadowing her winning.<br><br>If she won out of no where all the butthurt would be immense from people with lesser taste. This scene was setting up a massive flag so people can reference it after she wins.</br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Same moonfag here.<br>So I did some checking and 艶めいた can only take the 'glossy' translation when referring to an object. <br>Since Iroha is a woman, the correct translation for 艶めいた唇 is 'alluring lips' as in a sexy way.<br>I wonder if Spyro's translated it that way on purpose or not, probably not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Threatening to turn the club into a facade and expecting that 8man would object doesn't show any exceptional understanding. It's one of the things he's most vocal about his distaste for.<br><br>All Yui did was play the bad guy, and the running theme of the series is that while playing the bad guy might bring results, it's not good in the long run.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you're misinterpreting the series pretty fucking massively if you think Yui is supposed to be the person who understands him the most. The fact that it is the complete opposite is pounded in volume after volume. Volume 11 just further plunged that nail in even harder. Volume 10 made it really fucking obvious when 8man said in his monologue that he doesn't want to be understood, he wants to understand (i.e his relationship with Yui and Yukino respectively).<br><br> And volume 10.5 had several scenes to show how a character like Iroha who actually understands him interacts with him. <br><br>I'm not saying that Yui has no romantic chemistry with 8man, I'm saying it's a pretty fundamental fact and recurring theme throughout the story that she doesn't understand him. Seriously, your shipping goggles must be on pretty bloody tight to miss a theme that fucking obvious and integral to your character's development. <br><br><br>Mind citing a scene from volume 10.5 that was along the lines? I'm not doubting you or anything, but I seriously can't recall any scene like that except for maybe the Totsuka one. <br><br><br>I'm sorry anon, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way. <br><br> At least you have the VN I guess? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kanon is going to win and Yui will be crying. The series isn't even slightly subtle about this.  <br> VN <br> Sensei end is bad end </br></br>  <br>Welp, Watari really is being obvious then.<br>Jesus..</br></br>  <br>Not strictly true<br><br>Sensei end is consolation prize for wasting your time doing nothing productive.</br></br></br>   not!nice girl <br> pasta girl <br> actually perfect girl with cute sly attitude and kouhai status <br><br>How can anyone like any other girl other than Iroha? <br>I'll concede some other girls are good too, but not from the main ones that is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really the fact that 8man's always staring at her lips is pretty obvious on it's own.<br><br>Specified as alluring or not, you don't just look at them because they look nice.</br></br></br>  Nobody wins ending   Yuigahama is not a nice girl <br>Is this supposed to mean that 8man is supposed to think that she is a bitch or that all the times he thought she was nice to him was because she was in love with him?</br>  <br> dat lips </br>  <br>A lot of people confuse liking a character for thinking they're a good romantic interest.</br>  <br> If I keep shitposting this every thread, it'll catch on! </br>  <br>Or maybe that's just his take on it.</br>  <br><br>She's too manipulative and insincere. And her rapid transfer of affections from Hayato to Hachiman is strange, even if the latter is where they were really targeted all along. And 'kouhai' is neither a positive nor a negative in my book.<br><br>That being said I don't dislike her as a character. I just think it'd be bizarre if she ended up with Hachiman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's /a/, if you don't want to fuck or be fucked by a character, it's not a good character.<br><br> But still, the current circumstances for both of the main girls needs a bit more of development. <br><br><br> not liking younger girls </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It means Yui isn't always nice, that's all. There are times when she can be mean, selfish, or flawed, even if they're rare.<br><br>It's not like a drastic image change, more like acknowledging her as a person rather than an archetype.</br></br></br>  <br>  cute sly attitude <br>Not genuine</br></br>   艶めいた唇  <br> to be shiny; to be glossy; (for a woman) to be alluring, to look sexy <br>Literally self insert fapfiction.<br>Let me guess, Iroha appearance started the same time with his kouhai tweets?</br></br></br>  <br> best chemistry with the MC <br> bizarre ending <br>That makes no sense.<br>And she's only manipulative toward those she either doesn't care about or has interest in. The whole Hayama excuse is blown in volume 11, at which point 8man knows what's going on and accepts it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mind citing a scene from volume 10.5 that was along the lines? I'm not doubting you or anything, but I seriously can't recall any scene like that except for maybe the Totsuka one. <br><br>As far as I remember the scene is :<br>- When Hikki feeling's cold in the club room. Yui asking him to reconfirm that fact and want to share Yukino blanket with him, only for Yukino cockblock her before she is done saying it.<br><br>-Yui worried about Hikki in when stumbled in his work(deadline part). Instead she place her expectation like other two/pressure him, she comfort him and make sure he will be fine even he doesn't make it in deadline.<br><br>-This scene :<br><br> Then, Yukinoshita glanced at me. “As for Hikigaya-kun…” <br><br> “Cameraman, got it.” <br><br> Cameraman, that is, to take pictures of every club. That basically means I had a legal way of procuring photos of Totsuka. I was so motivated that I’d exclaim, “Leave the cameraman role to me! Scratch scratch!” but Yukinoshita’s reply was callous. <br> “You will handle the writing, coverage, photography, planning, production, proofreading, public relations, accounting, and all routine duties.” <br><br> Talk about a lot… There are even unnecessary jobs in there, too. I made a vexed look and Yukinoshita glared at me. <br><br> “Are you unsatisfied with something?” <br><br> Not something, but everything. I thought. Then, Yuigahama patted Yukinoshita’s shoulders. <br><br> “O-Okay, okay, Yukinon. We’re already done with the coverage for the stores, so…” <br><br> When Yuigahama tried to intervene, Yukinoshita had a slightly objecting face. She then sighed and brushed aside her hair. <br><br> “…That’s true. In that case, Hikigaya-kun will be in charge of the writing and routine tasks.” <br><br> “…Roger.”  <br><br>I think most of them You can say she just being considerate. But for me she understand him enough to make him feel as comfortable as she can.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Yukinoshita family problem isn't the endgame, the option for Iroha end is opened, anon. It's just that Yukino family is probably the endgame</br>  <br> he doesn't want to be understood <br><br>He doesn't care if he's being misunderstood. <br><br> volume 10.5 <br><br>Yui ditto but actually:<br><br> he doesn't want to be understood <br> Iroha who actually understands him interacts with him. <br><br>I don't know whether or not you're doing it on purpose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Triple dubs. Iroha get it again</br>  <br>Nah, Iroha showed up much earlier than that tweet.<br>Also, nice triple dubs in Iroha's name.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I misread the post in question and ended up saying the opposite thing by mistake.<br><br>Yukino and Yui have a lot of good traits, but they have among the worst protagonist chemistry I've ever seen in a romantic series. Retarded harems notwithstanding, of course.</br></br></br></br>  Umm.. has this show ended? or is there another cour?  <br>8man could be a complete stranger and you'd be able to recognize he's getting screwed by Yukino in that scene. It really doesn't say much of anything at all.</br>  <br><br>She's manipulative towards 8man. She puts on a fake front in her dealings with him and pretends something that isn't true, that she knows herself isn't true. Furthermore she has done so over and over and over again. I just don't think that's what Hachiman is going for or what he really wants.<br><br>I dunno. I'm not really a shipper. I assure I have zero emotional investment in any particular girl getting with Hachiman. If I were his friend and Hachiman asked me right now (end of vol 11) which girl he should go for (and assuming he personally can't express a preference), I would say Yui without hesitation. Earlier in the series I would have said Yukino and I might go back to that depending on how the rest of the series plays out, but until her issues get dealt with I couldn't in good conscious tell anyone to be with her.<br><br>The only way I could really see an Iroha end is in an epilogue type situation that takes place after the events of the main story. This would assume that Hachiman and Iroha are both different people to some extent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This ending right?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah yeah. The master troll Wataru never hesitates to needle his shippers.<br><br>I'm not saying it's impossible, but acting like a twitter post is some holy gospel of truth the way a lot of posters like to do so is silly.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Because</br>  <br>Not from volume 10,5.<br><br>This scene in LN still counted as Yui understand 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha's chance is so slim that their fans cling onto every good mention of her</br>  <br>Why are people saying she isn't a girl?<br>The stunt she pulled toward the last ep is literally mother teresa tier.<br>Any other girls would leave Yukinon to rot by herself.</br></br></br>  <br> She's manipulative towards 8man. She puts on a fake front in her dealings with him and pretends something that isn't true, that she knows herself isn't true. Furthermore she has done so over and over and over again. I just don't think that's what Hachiman is going for or what he really wants. <br><br> I want a genuine too <br> take responsability for making me realize this <br> "hurr durr she's not genuine" <br>Are you a moron or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She gave me an invitation to her wedding party. </br>  <br> manipulative and insincere <br>[citation needed]<br><br> And her rapid transfer of affections from Hayato to Hachiman is strange <br>It makes perfect sense if you have paid literally any attention to the story whatsoever.<br><br> I just think it'd be bizarre if she ended up with Hachiman. <br>Considering you find her development from Hayama strange, that doesn't mean much.<br><br><br>Iroha doesn't put on fake fronts, she operates on several fronts at once. There's a big difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are people saying she isn't a girl? <br>Are you confirmed Yui to be a futa?</br></br>  <br> Iroha's fans actually pay attention to details in the narrative <br><br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Why are people saying she isn't a nice girl? <br>Fucking typo</br></br></br>  <br>Son you are the one who need to take off the shipper google.<br><br>I'm not saying that Yui understand 8man 100% completely, but relatively speaking, out of three girls Yui is the person who understands him the most.<br><br>Iroha knows how to deal with 8man only because of their similar personality.<br>Unlike Yukino/Yui, she never connects with 8man on a deeper level. <br><br>While Yui is fundamentally different from 8man,<br>Yui learns about 8man by years of observing and spending time together. <br>What make her different from Yukino is the fact that Yukino only saw the idealized image of 8man, but Yui always looking at the real 8man. <br><br>If you really think that Iroha knows 8man better than anyone else then you are seriously delusional, <br>taking this episode for example, Iroha doesn't even know that 8man likes sweet things.<br><br><br>Also<br><br> he doesn't want to be understood, he wants to understand (i.e his relationship with Yui and Yukino respectively). <br><br> implying 8man doesn't want to understand Yui <br><br>He literally said that he wants to know everything about Yui in  <br><br><br><br>Whatever you say,<br>but this scene provided that she knows 8man from the inside out, <br>she knew that 8man will stop her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people claim Iroha puts up a front? Let's use the date as an example.<br><br>Iroha says that it's for work, but she also tells 8man it's a date, and it's reference for Hayama.<br><br>There is literally no reason why all of the above can't be true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also know that if I punch some random guy at the bar he's probably going to punch me back.<br><br>Does that mean I have a deep understanding of bar guy?</br></br></br>  <br> said it is reference for Hayama <br> actually go to places that Hayama will never go <br><br>How do you use that as reference?</br></br></br></br>  Every thread<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N0<wbr>YoUh0SjWc</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>The tweet was from December 13th 2014, between vol 10 and 10.5 releases</br>  <br>It's not like she specifically said she'd want to take him somewhere he'd find different and interesting or anything.</br>  <br>That just like saying Slaine gonna end up with Asshime in Aldnoah zero despite staff keep shipping them outside anime itself.<br><br>*prepare shield before <br> how dare you compared Aldnoah shit with Oregairu. </br></br></br></br>  <br> A.Z babies </br>  <br> file name <br><br>I always missed that part, why 8man reacted to that sentence.</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga<br><br><br>Hachiman pretend that he's immune to pain<br><br>He's not</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I only watch mature anime like oregairu </br>  <br> He literally said that he wants to know everything about Yui in  →  <br>No proof. He could be lying!</br></br>  <br>Everyone in this series is a nice girl.<br><br>Including Miura.</br></br></br>  <br> "艶めいた唇で彼女は文字数制限" <br> 艶めいた唇 <br>Fucking motherfucker.</br></br></br>  <br>Even  Hayama? </br>  <br> have leftover stuco funds <br> formulate a project to use them, so your budget doesn't get cut <br> as a part of that project get to take your #2 on a date on stuco funds <br> it's also reference to help you win with #1 <br> have a good date, and the project turns out well <br> also get some bragging rights for #2's competition <br><br>10.5 Iroha gave me the biggest utilitarian boner</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> #2 <br> #1 <br>Falseflag someplace else.</br></br></br>  <br> oregairu <br> mature  <br>Kektop</br></br></br>  <br>She didn't just stop caring about Hayama when she got rejected, you know. The train scene is proof of that.<br><br>Her growing/acknowledging her feelings for 8man and waning feelings for Hayama is a gradual process just like 8man warming up to her is a gradual process. It wouldn't be unusual if she still, consciously at the very least, thinks of Hayama as her #1 when she takes 8man out on the date.</br></br></br>  <br> Even if I thought I knew something, there were still a lot of things that I just didn’t know. Like how Yuigahama who normally didn’t wear glasses would surprisingly look good with them. <br><br> At some point long ago, there was something that Yukinoshita had once said as if out of regret. That she didn’t know about Yuigahama at all. <br><br> I was the same. <br><br> The way I was before, I truly didn’t even try to know. <br><br> Not just about Yukinoshita, but also about Yuigahama. <br><br> However, right now, it was just a tiny bit. It was far from understanding and I couldn’t even say it was ideal, but even so, the three of us had definitely spent and accumulated time together. Slightly over half a year wasn’t really all that long. But even so, compared to back then, I most certainly did know just a little more about her. <br><br>Also, I just noticed:<br><br> “You’re already funny in the head if you’re equating glasses to intelligence, you know…” <br><br>Later:<br><br> Like how Yuigahama who normally didn’t wear glasses would surprisingly look good with them. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  genuine hair color <br>Should be orange, like her mama</br></br>  <br>He was hiding his inner feeling for her.<br><br>That why he almost never write sonnet for Yui in his mind except at early novel.</br></br></br>  <br> platonic friendship monologues (no seriously, he even specifically says Yukino shares the same sentiments)  <br> also she looks good in glasses <br><br>Small pickings for yuifriends, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was basically shipping Miura with Hayama by the end of volume 10.<br>There's no way anyone would know what she thinks, we only get to see things from 8man's perspective. She had 8man decide where to go and what to do, even though he's like the antithesis of Hayama and whenever he messed up, she pressed him on to keep up with the date.<br>There's really no point in doing any of that and admitting that she had fun if she's trying to get reference for Hayama like you stated.</br></br></br>  I converted volume 11 to txt format. Anyone want it? (bear it mind that this one isn't edited so it contains some errors here and there)  <br>I do, please.</br>  <br>Please share. Someone will thank you.  I do too </br>  <br> tfw she spent all her allowance in wool balls to knit a sweater for the date, and she did that under the light of a candle </br>  <br>There's no reason why it can't be both. Iroha likes to overlap her goals.</br>  <br>Calm down, m8. I was refuting this  claim which said that what 8man said in this  was fake/lying whereas 8man implied that he does (even if it's a little bit) want to know Yukino and (by extension) Yui.</br>  <br>I'm just saying that there's no point in doing that. And I'm sure she knows that too.<br>The same shit happens in volume 11 with the whole choco and cookie story, except that this time she completely blew her hayama excuse for good.</br></br>  <br>Literally a crime if she doesn't win.</br>  <br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/pftxhpwras.txt<wbr> <br><br>also, I'm pretty good at ruby and html/css, so if you really want it I'd try to slight parse the text (remove chapter title, merge line break (page split), split to paragraph etc) and put it in a nice looking html format (proper line height, limit character to 40 etc.)</br></br></wbr></br></br>  YuixYukino<br>HarunoxCunt<br>8manxIroha<br>EbinaxTobe<br>MiuraxCookies</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw she just smiled impishly when 8man asked about that <br> "what are you talking about, Senpai? Could it be that you 're making passes at me?" </br></br></br>  <br>Can you say that again, but with grammar?</br>  <br>Hachiman x Yui<br>Hayato x Yukino<br>Tobe x Iroha</br></br></br>  <br>Really appreciate this, thanks anon.<br><br> also, I'm pretty good at ruby and html/css, so if you really want it I'd try to slight parse the text (remove chapter title, merge line break (page split), split to paragraph etc) and put it in a nice looking html format (proper line height, limit character to 40 etc.) <br>If you really want to go autistic on that, I can't stop you and I'd love it. Just don't tire yourself with that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>10/10<br> MiuraxCookies <br>9/10</br></br></br>  <br>8man wants to know Yukino and Yui too</br>  <br>Did Hayama name even come up?<br>She literally ask 8man if he likes sweet without even using Hayama as a pretense.</br></br>   127339122 <br> 127341204  <br>You guys are enjoying this poorfag thing too much</br></br>  <br>But there is a point. She literally states the point when they bring it up. Read 10.5 again if you have to.<br><br>For the choco scene I'm pretty sure that's her confirming 8man's feelings one last time, and that she's going to confirm her own feelings and make an earnest go at him in the next volume. Her disappearing for the rest of the volume is the "calm before the storm" of sorts.</br></br></br>  <br> Tobe x Iroha <br>Top fucking kek</br></br>  <br>Okay, I don't disagree. I was just pointing out how painfully friendzoned that particular quote sounded.</br>    <br>Is someone still doubting?<br> Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing　in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making. So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it. <br> 8man: You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now. <br> Yukino: Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad. <br> Yui: I wouldn't be happy with it... <br> Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai... So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Hayama's name doesn't come up at all.<br>It only shows up when Iroha is leaving with the chocos.</br></br>  <br> So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer? <br>Very subtle there, Isshiki-san.</br></br>  https://gifsound.com/?gif=i.imgur.c<wbr>om/XqMuhN5.gif&amp;v=qhqnvaq6BwA</wbr>  I think I finally figured out why Yukino and Yui never talked about 8man when they're alone.<br><br> Yui didn't want to let on she liked him and was always kind of afraid that Yukino liked him too. Yukino had weird girl feelings for him that she could never really explain so she never brought them up. </br></br>  <br>So the reason 8man asking her out that time because he is thinking that was good time when it had valentine day atmosphere at that time.<br> <br>not bad 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>*8man asking Yui out</br>  <br>8man, she's not your grill.  Yet. </br>  <br>Translate the indirect kiss scene please</br>  <br>After Yukino's problem, we need an Iroha poorfag arc<br> Birthday party <br> 8man happens to know where she lives <br> They end up kissing   in her 1LDK </br></br></br></br>  <br> I just tried to imitates Senpai... <br><br>What does this imply? Did she explained something that was supposed to be understandable but actually is biased by her own view just like 8man always do? How the hell could she understand 8man to that extent in only like 3-4 months?</br></br></br>  <br>I think she was just afraid that Yukino will think that Yui used "friendship with Yukino" as pretext to join the club and get close to 8man.</br>  <br><br>I was thinking though, when they were making that cup for him, they had to have talked about him at least a bit. Admittedly they'd probably just talk filler at each other about hachiman anyway, but its always made me wonder what the cup making was like.</br></br>  <br>Translate when 8man mentioned her birthday please. Is there anything skipped?</br>  <br>Most of it's already been translated.</br>  ITT: Irohafags  <br>It's not that hard. I did the same thing before when I started reading LN.<br><br>Btw, already remove chapter titles, working on merge unfinished line.</br></br></br>  <br>methinks Yui was considering her promise to Haruno and not inflict Yukino with all the terrible and pointless girl-drama by sharing her thoughts about 8man.</br>  <br><br>She's similar to Komachi, so she understands him well and realizes that he's mercantile and also, right about that dialogue, 8man says how you can get MAX coffee for cost lower than usual.<br><br><br>It was somewhere in the archive<br><br><br>Just a little bit. At the very start she said that Yukino was angry that she came into the club until Yui and 8man. Then Yui said that she can't into chocolate making . 8man took out of the bag MAX coffee, saying that he likes it's level of sweetness and Iroha said that buying MAX coffee as ingredient would be tough for her budged.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> buying MAX coffee as ingredient would be tough for her budged. <br>Holy shit, she's a poorfag.<br>Just marry her already, 8man.</br></br></br>  <br> tough for her budget <br>She really is a poorfag?</br></br>  Trying to force myself to watch episode 13, but the dialogue is so fucking garbage. Surprise SakiSaki ending or I give I rate this anime a shit/10 and go read the light novel for my SakiSaki feels.  <br>I want to fuck this killing cunt</br>  So I have this theory about Iroha. <br><br>She likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No fucking shit.</br>  <br>iroha is so irrelevant</br>  <br>Spoonfeeding you just this time.<br><br> - So you really good at cooking <br> - Do you not believe my words, Senpai? <br> - No, not really... I just thought you're incredible. <br> - *Are you making passes on me?* <br> Shove the spoon into his mouth <br> - Do you hate that level of sweetness? <br> - ...I don't. <br> - Ah. I wasn't talking about the flavor though <br> She was almost touching her lips and sligtly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for. <br> - Even so, answer is the same <br> - ...Is that so.  <br> Isshiki started thinking of something and her gaze dropped inside the bowl. She then hastily lifted her head <br> - Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~ <br> - Too sweet... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wasn't being able to stand this shitty melodrama anymore, fuck problematic girls, Sakisaki should win this shit to give 8man some peace of mind instead of more problems to worry about.  <br><br>POORFAG CONFIRMED</br></br>  <br>I think you're stressing Hayama too much. He doesn't come up nearly as much as, say, her getting 8man to assist her duties.</br>  <br>Yeah, what was with that? Why were these two together?</br>  Who is SakiSaki?  So did the girls telepathically declare war or was the end of EP13 aborting the love triangle?  <br>Yeah, sure, keep telling you that, anon.<br>I will laugh so hard at your face when Iroha wins.</br></br>  If Iroha wins I'll eat my own shit  <br> Iroha  <br> winning <br>I'll shoot my own foot if that happens.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't even admit their feelings.

Do you think Saki has a crush on 8man?</br>  <br><br>Need more details.</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Definitely. Just from anime alone it is obvious.

Whats so dangerous about Souma's hujiao bing?  So Souma's making steamed buns?  <br>JIBUN WOO</br>  <br>man this looks delicious</br>  <br>I can't cook shit .<br><br>To lazy to learn.</br></br></br>  Spread reminded that Risa Taneda sounds like an angel and I want to hear her do a falsetto again as Erina.  So I just noticed, the flashback is to Souma in his first year of primary school, and he doesn't have the scar. Did we already know he didn't get it until after he was old enough for elementary school?  <br>It's never that hard. I just made a bowl of ice cream</br>  <br>This. What exactly does hujiao bing have that dispels mabo tofu?<br><br>Relief against the spiciness?</br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Why cook when you can have other people do it for you?</br>  So what is rooster planning?<br><br>Sabotage?</br></br>  <br>He has it here.

According to tradition, the presents are delivered by a kind ugly witch called Befana on a broomstick. It was said that she was told by the three kings that the baby Jesus was born, she was busy and delayed visiting the baby. <br> She missed the Star lost her way and has been flying around ever since, leaving presents at every house with children in case he is there. She slides down chimneys, and fills stockings and shoes with good things for good children and it is said leaves coal for children who are not so good. <br>Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>Primary 1 Souma is the cutest.

There was just too much of it. <br><br>We're on ch 124 right now, for now the arc has literally been half of the manga's serialization. That's insane.<br><br> Depending on who you ask, many will also blame this on why Erina's screen time and development has been so lackluster. It's hard for her to be involved in the arc when she's relegated to an observer role for the entirety of it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nigger <br>Was there any reason to have that word in your post?</br></br>  <br>Season 2 is going to kill Season 3 in the womb if it's all tournament.</br>  <br>Go back to tumblr</br>  <br>Anon, we are all niggers on 4chan.<br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/ </br></br>  <br>why'd you spoiler that?</br>  <br>Ehh it depends on how they do it<br><br>As long as they space out the battles with stuff like erina and alice's swimathon and only have 1 episode each for the first round battles it should be fine</br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't offend me in anyway it just makes you look like a child.</br></br>  <br> J.C.

With the absence of his mom and that scar I have a feeling that she and Souma met Truck-kun somewhere.</br>  <br>Yes, Shokugeki no Soma is the only WSJ manga that has a color chapter each week by Jump+ staff.<br>But it's not the only WSJ manga that has a color version.

GUNDAMMIT</br>  <br>He means your mother.</br>  <br>I hope this doesn't preclude the manga from doing field trip arcs.</br>  I always thought Erina's attraction to Souma made no sense.<br><br>But after giving it some thought, she's very competitive, and the fact that he made a dish that made her wet her panties shows that she refuses to accept someone who can surpass the expectations of her God's Tongue. She's childish at heart, but she knows deep down Souma's talent is extraordinary, to the point it impresses her, but she'll keep stubbornly denying it and act all oujo-sama towards him because of her superiority complex. <br><br>I can't wait for their eventual shokugeki and when she admits defeat, it will be   delicious  .</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooked the eggs benedict with salmon roe, it was surprisingly good. That one addition makes it taste like an entirely different meal, like a fishy seafood version. I served it to someone who had never tried it or seen the anime beside a plain version, he really liked the roe more.<br><br>I have almost never cooked in my life, youtube gordon ramsay and you can really do some amazing shit. If the hollandaise sauce starts to thicken or chunk, mix in a teaspoon of hot water to fix it.</br></br></br>  <br>Your sauce ruins it. Otherwise it looks pretty good.</br>  <br>So extra saltiness makes eggs benedict taste real good? I've had regular buffet eggs benedict and it was the most impressive meal I had in that one buffet I can't remember where.</br>  <br>Shit looks budget as fuck bro.</br>  <br>What  said. Looks like the eggs were cooked when making the hollandaise sauce.</br>  <br>I thought Yukihira wasn't talented, but just had the drive and tenacity to keep pushing forward and win it all. And that personality complements his inherited cooking style of pulling ideas from any source he can find</br>  Oh hey, the Chanko guy's still around.  <br>And I just finished eating the chaliapan steak, which a friend and I tried tonight. Its deceptively hard, so we didn't exactly nail it. We couldnt find pickled plum sauce and tried with regular plum sauce, it was moderately refreshing rice but didnt have the kick it needed.Our steak also turned out shit and tough because of a poor tenderizing process and forgetting to cut slits in the meat. But now that I have said everyone that has gone wrong, let me be blunt.<br><br>This recipe is fucking AMAZING.<br><br>The anime reactions are 100% accurate with literally no exaggeration, we were fucking shoveling these onions down and the dish just kept begging us to eat faster and faster. I just ate literally the best onions in my entire life. If you can nail the plum sauce rice, and even make a quarter decent steak, this can easily be your big guns showoff recipe. Like holy shit, I can't even express how accurate the anime taster reactions are. The refreshing rice balances out what would normally be a heavy handed taste.<br><br>If I had one major tip for anyone trying this dish yourself: DONT MAKE ENOUGH. Next time I will half the steaks I buy. It's the kind of food that will have you crawling back for more, but if you make a fuck ton and eat it all at once until you cant eat anymore, it loses its appeal and can even get dissatisfying pretty quickly. Treat it like oil and only let people have it in small amounts, then promise them some more next time.<br>timestamp 11:52 for our reaction while eating the onion sauce also smells fucking delicious <br>https://<span>youtu.be/4j202mFMGAA?t=711  [ ]</br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Especially naked apron sempai putting his all into the song. I wish I had a sempai like him in high school, not even gay.</br>  <br>He is talented in the sense that he worked hard and gained a good level of mastery in the kitchen, but he's nor naturally gifted (like erina or currynigger) nor has an outstanding talent for cooking.</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br> The reactions are 100% accurate <br>So you and your friend let out 20+ years wort of semen while eating it?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thats because it is budget as fuck bro. Like I said earlier, the sauce was perfect but as we cooked the eggs it really started to clump up and turn to shit, we thought all was ruined until we discovered the adding hot water trick. So it's not perfect, but it still tastes amazing and for my first eggs benny in history I think a little thick sauce is ok. The other thing I would improve is more pork, thin ham slices werent enough you need a real chunk of meat to get the most out of it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rice looks terrible. Meat and onions look all right.<br><br>You're right about having too much meat. That thick slab looks like a fucking monster. compared to everything else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yes we did. Shit was unreal.</br>  <br>It's not just saltiness, it gives it a fishy taste. It's almost like seafood eggs benny.</br>  <br>I need to try this at some point.<br>While it isn't going to look like the animu counterpart, is it possible to make the onions maintain their golden colour after frying them in wine. It'd look much nicer.<br>Also, you added too much water to the rice</br></br></br>  <br>Also when she finds out who Souma's dad is.</br>  <br>Yeah I suck at rice. As for the onions, I really think that would be a challenge and that they exaggerated in the anime. Keep in mind the sauce consists of meat juice, red wine, and burnt soy sauce. No matter how you cook the onions those are pretty dark ingredients. I could be wrong, but i think you'd have to add something to color it. The spring onions on top might make it look nicer though.</br>  <br> Yeah I suck at rice. <br>4:5 rice-to-water ratio in a rice cooker always seems to work for me.</br></br>  Bro I just want the dad making a surprise appearance and saving souma in a drastic situation. Everyone would be flipping out by the sight of him and everything and his father would probably have make some plain af dish but would make the people tasting it jizz more than souma could make them  <br>Ah yeah, the soy sauce. I forgot about that.<br>It'd probably be doable if you put the soy sauce in with the rice instead. If you then caramelised the onions and didn't go too mad with the red wine, I think you could make those onions have a bit of gold in them. It'd be good to try it out, though properly caramelising onions takes a lot longer.<br><br>For the rice, just try to get the water ratio right. Apparently, you should have around 1.5-1.75 times as much water as rice volume wise when cooking. The longer the grain, the more water you'll need. But you also need to make sure you don't cook it for too long. 10 minutes I find is a good length of time. Around 15mins and you start getting mushy crap.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think moving the soy sauce would work. The soy sauce is part of what makes the onions godlike, you dont wanna fuck with those onions anon. Putting it in the rice also removes the refreshing zest that they give to balance out the dish, and would make the entire thing heavy like nikumis dish was.<br><br>Also I want to reiterate, don't settle for plum sauce. It has to be pickled plum.</br></br></br>  <br>That actually sounds tasty.</br>  <br>Does the zest from the soy sauce come from frying it? if so, then yeah, I can understand not wanting to put it on the rice alone.<br><br>you really want to maintain a salty kick from the onions, then the only other thing I could think of to improve the colour and also buff the onions is frying it with hoisin instead. It's nowhere near as darkening and also has a great sweetness which both boosts the caramelised onion's sweetness and also pairs with the steak brilliantly</br></br></br>  <br>Would frying the onions with honey work?</br>  <br>Nononono, the zest is in the rice. Thats the refreshing kick. The soy sauce deepens and makes the flavor heavy and... umami. Watch the original clip, its exactly like the judges describe it. I recommend trying to make it once before tweaking, the hoisin really sounds like a good way to try on your second cook though.</br>  <br>You don't know until you try :) Post the result tomorrow.</br>  <br> italy  <br> no custom about Santa <br>Lies!</br></br></br>  <br>Prelims were fun as fuck</br>  <br>Have a try. It would certainly make the dish very sweet. Just make sure you add it late, or it'll caramelise and burn</br>  <br>Ah of course. Good point. Rice really is a different beast when it's got soy sauce mixed in.</br>  <br><br>Megumi is too precious</br></br>  What's with Yugi's scary look on Souma this chapter? Do you think that he realized what he's doing and thought of countermeasures?  <br>He recognized the oven. Also, reasonably, he's not going to be an idiot. So it's certainly likely that he's already though up plans.</br>  <br>truly a besy</br>  <br>best*</br>  Translation never  Nikumi a Shit  <br> You a shit </br>  <br>truth</br>  <br><br>You is best girl. Don't hate.</br></br>  <br>Index? Oh wait.</br>  <br>inb4 its revealed there was a childhood rivalry with Souma, about attaining recognition from Jouichirou surpassing him as a chef but she has since forgotten his face.<br><br>Gonna get Nisekoi'ed.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow, the girls are practically Hinako and Fuyumi.</br>  <br><br> loli hair mandibles <br><br>what happens if you pull loli Erina's hair mandibles?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's too cliche and it's not gonna happen. Erina looks a bit too old in the pic and if she could remember Jouichiro back then she would remember a childhood friend. She remembers her squabbles with Alice when they were 5 years old. So nope.</br>  <br>Although Souma can be just a guy served an impressive entry dish, could grandpa know Souma already since Jouichirou was hired?</br>  <br>Shell probably try to hit and kick at you.</br>  <br><br>her wig will fag</br></br>  <br>Her bodyguards jump you.</br>  <br><br>*fall</br></br>  <br><br> Joichiro says the secret to being a great cook is having a woman to devote all your cooking to <br> Soma declares he will exhaust all of his cooking skills to make sure Erina says it's "delicious" <br><br>sasuga tsukuda<br>like poetry</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Tsukuda still remembers these scenes and hasn't forgotten because of the looooooong pacing.</br>  <br> Implying Erina is whom Souma will end up with and not the whom she'll get her ass handed in cooking </br>  <br> in italy there's no custom about santa <br>Do they even Italy?</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it the first chapter? That would be easy to remember for him. I can imagine things in the middle can be forgettable but I don't think he'll have a problem with that plot point.<br><br>But then again, mangaka tend to forget many plot points as time, fanbase and society influences him/her to change shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>instant best girl</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> you will never be her onii-chan and bully her by pulling her god's tongue out making her cry  <br> you will never play with her hair mandibles and tease that she has a mustache now as you pull them under her nose <br> you will never feel her frail kicking and punching as you chuckle at her <br> you will never drive her to the supermarket to buy ingredients so you can cook together <br> you will never go into a fatal car accident and she'll survive but lose her onii-chan <br> your death will never be the reason she's such a bitch in the future <br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Future or Past  You?</br>  say have we ever seen souma hug anyone?  <br>Fumio</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  I like Meat, she's cute.<br>I wish she had a chance to win the Soumabowl.<br>I hope she doesn't end up with Don-senpai.</br></br>  <br><br> Past, though future is great, too. </br></br>    <br>I guess the only girls Souma is comfortable with getting in his personal space is old ladies</br>  <br> it's not an onii-chan <br> it's an onee-chan <br> it will be Souma's mom <br> employed as a maid <br> dies in the car crash <br> Souma's dad left the Nakiri employ shortly after his wife's death. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  How much trouble would have Erina got if others found out about her dropping Souma without being fair about his food?<br>Seriously, she was acting behalf of the school/Nakiri clan, and like the others said her words have weight - can trash one's career completely.

Bias faggotry at its finest</br></br>  <br>Now I imagine shaved bara Takumi. Oh god.</br>  <br>Anon that's a disgusting mental image.</br>  <br><br>I don't find Soma as amazing as most and I'd rather see him fight his way up cause it's more interesting ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ <br><br>Things will of course change between now and year 3 but as it is, current rankings have Erina &gt; Hayama &gt; Soma = Ryo &gt; Alice &gt; Takumi so the predictions follow that.

Hayama could have his nose kicked in by Ryo and lose his smelling and drop to rank 9.<br><br>Erina is rank 10 now but she could very well be "better" than 8 and 9. The ranks are a ballpark but people treat them like absolutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hayama could have his nose kicked in by Ryo and lose his smelling <br>That could easily get him expelled. But obviously Ryou isn't the type to do that anyway. I honestly don't think you'd simply lose your rank simply because your special talent is lost or impaired. With that logic Erina could drop as well if she couldn't use her God's tongue.</br></br>  <br>Erina has near "perfect" technique on top of her tongue. All of them are highly competent but their specialties are what got them so high. Hayama without his nose would still have his knowledge of spices but he won't be able to pull out their potential entirely.<br><br>He'll still be good but he'll lose the edge that won him the finals. But maybe he'll learn to stop relying on his nose so much.<br><br>Hayama vs stinky sadatsuka might be an interesting match if her stinky stuff overwhelms his nose</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Erina has near "perfect" technique on top of her tongue. <br>We honestly don't know that. Her skill and technique could also be complemented by her God's Tongue. Chefs still need to rely on their sense of taste more than anything else. She pretty much has been dependent on it all her life. The only time we can say she's still as good without it if she cooks without having a single taste of her dish.</br></br>  <br>Oh my bad if it sounds like I'm disagreeing with your assessment on Erina. I'm not. Without her tongue I think she'd be making food that's textbook good but nothing special or unique. Her whole thing is about perfection.</br>  Made a Fresh Orange and Cream Tart.<br><br>1.

Just kidding. Shit's pretty cash. </br></br>  I want to do many bad and lewd things to komari senpai.  Do you like it when straight girls are raped by lesbians in anime/manga?  I like it when lesbians are cured by dicks.  <br>Life must suck for you if you're a lesbian and into this. All the girls around you are into dick, and no matter how hard you try you don't understand. All the people you have romantic feelings for are more than likely going to be straight, and if you find another lesbian, they're most likely so confused about their gender identity they might want to look male physically thus ruining your attraction in the first place.<br><br>Can't really have kids that share your genetic traits without relying on expensive third parties, and your family has no expectations of you anymore. They bother your siblings for grandchildren and just ignore you.</br></br></br>  <br>Times are changing. Give it another 20.</br>  <br>I always found it weird that lesbos make themselves as unfeminine as humanly possible.<br>Granted they don't tend to be oil paintings in the first place and tend to have mental illnesses other than being a homosexual, but it is strange nonetheless.</br></br>  <br>You are my gene-sharing colour-saturated human.</br>  Is it weird that I wish I was born as a pretty girl so I could be gently dominated by a loving mistress?  <br>I'm confused. <br>How will time change the ratio of homosexuality?<br>How will being attracted to the same gender not result in using a third party to obtain an offspring?<br><br>The problems weren't problems of social acceptance but the literal ramifications of... damn. Don't want to explain. This shit's too obvious. L8r, hopefully the thread gets archived soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Tbh I also like it when straight guys are raped by gay guys, just for the humiliation factor. Anime/manga only please, not real life</br>  <br>I like it when those dicks are attached to other lesbians.</br>  <br> How will time change the ratio of homosexuality? <br>Not that anon but hopefully with the decline of the West many of its bullshit ideological doctrines will fall as well, chasing homosexuals right back to the closet, then setting fire to it.</br></br>  <br>Yes. But I prefer it when girls get raped by men, because I can self insert as a girl getting pounded with cocks against her will</br>  <br>So you're a lesbian in a straight man's body?<br>Well, they always did say sexuality was confusing.<br><br><br>Don't quote me and add on stuff like seeing homosexuality as a mental illness. I don't agree with you.<br><br>Also, some guys like tomboys but aren't sexually confused, so it's probably the same with lesbians.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Am I a terrible person. It seems like only terrible people are quoting me XD.<br><br>Instead of wanting to kill homosexuals you should just feel a little sorry for them and that's it. Let them go about their lives and don't treat them any differently than you would another person. Just by being they way they are they have to face adversities heterosexual people just don't face. Starting a family is so much easier if you're heterosexual, so just give them a break.</br></br></br>  <br>i really dont get why girls like dicks either. Obviously its going to feel better if you have sex with another woman.<br><br>Why hasnt science invented realistic dildos yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Guess so, but I would never get rid of my dick or do a sex change. Just gotta roll with the cards we are dealt.</br>  <br>Pfffft hahahahaha...<br>Look..<br>God I can't stop laughing.<br><br>Ok seriously gotta keep a straight face. Ok. You don't understand heterosexuality. That's fine. Those girls don't understand homosexuality.<br><br>Boom<br><br>Obvious answer. It's like saying why don't guys like having sex with other guys. It'll obviously feel better since male asses are tighter (that was the most disgusting sentence I've ever written.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What isn't to like about dicks? I'm a 2D only guy, but I'd still loved to get dicked, or suck on one</br>  <br> never get rid of my dick <br>But you wrote <br> I wish I was born as a pretty girl <br><br>Dude.

It shows dedication of the girl.  It's official, Ash still can't win the league.  <br><br>and he has only himself to blame with that trash team</br></br>  in the anime, is a fully evolved pokemon like a rare thing? Could it potentially cause mass extinctions if used by the wrong person? <br><br><br>Does it matter to evolve? I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br>You lose out on the POWER OF FRIENDSHIP</br>   releases Goodra <br><br>He deserves it.</br></br>  Why is he standing on the podium with four Pokemon looking like an autist while the other two are by themselves?  At least it isn't Tobias<br><br>Cheating motherfucker</br></br>  Ash being in the top 4 of pretty much every pokemon league should have gained him some fame by now. He should be a world renowned top trainer.   losing while having hawlucha in your team <br>How bad of a trainer someone needs to be to accomplish that?</br>  <br> unevolved shitmons <br> not even eviolite <br>gee I wonder why?</br></br></br>  <br>He deserved to lose. Three of his pokemon are flying types. <br>Any Electric attack would fuck up 3/4ths of his party.</br></br>  <br>What is this? A random tournament or the real league?</br>  <br>It was a fucking flying league<br>Not the big one<br><br>Fuck, they didn't even really battle, It was a race</br></br></br></br>  If he had Pidgeot things would be different  <br>He has never even managed to beat a single pokemon of any of the like 30 elite four. He's not a top trainer.</br>  We will all die of old age before Ash wins the league  <br>Then my mistake, I apologize. <br><br>He could have still chosen better flying types however. Last I checked, his Charizard was still alive.</br></br></br>  Wait, did they actually have the league tournament already?  <br> implying Ash will get into the podium <br>That's not the league OP. He hasn't even completed the 8 gyms</br></br>  <br>Read the thread.</br>  Wonder what Gary's doing.  <br>Subs out?</br>  At least he has a Hawlucha on his team, so he has decent taste  <br>Isn't it off boning all the female charizards on charizard island or something?<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127321 </br>  <br>It better be. Either that, or Oak's been studying it for the past 18 years</br>    <br>They're like the national team members, though. He's top sixteen in multiple championships. He's also ten. This is also the fucking Pokémon anime, so obviously I'm being overly autistic here.</br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>We will die of old age before ash turns<br>20</br></br>  <br>manlets ass nigga on the second place podium and is still the shortest</br>  <br>That's because he's a grade schooler.</br>  <br> Manlet <br>He's 10</br></br>  <br>Like what said<br>  10 yrs old <br>  constantly in top rank of every league he's in <br>  did win orange islands <br>  anime for whatever stupid reason progressed, at most, two years <br>  Had an adventure with practically every legendary pokemon, including the fuggin god of their universe, Arceus <br><br>He's a walking PR machine considering every adventure is visiting another podunk town and being their posterboy darling by the end of the episode. Ash should be swimming in worldwide accolade considering how much he gets done</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or whom</br>  <br>If you're going to complain about this, you might as well complain about the fact that somehow he has difficulty with every gym leader.</br>  <br>so aside from being shit, how did he fuck up this time? what did the Pokemon producers have the guy who beat him pull against him, more legendaries?</br>  <br>Fuck you, onbat was awesome.</br>  <br>Ash gets cucked out of a win every time, it's been like this for years. Nintendo or whoever the fuck owns pokemon is just trying to drag it out as long as possible with as little effort possible. If they made Ash win they'd have to come up with a new MC every season.</br>  <br>Or they could make him win the tournament, lose to the E4 (so he doesn't have to stay there) and keep training, as happens with every actual sportsman who wins a tournament. But fuck that, kids don't know how shit really works.</br>  <br>He's busy catching new seasonal crap and testing their limits in relevant scenarios. Considering gym battles are free to any challenger, what trainer who wants to know the ins and outs of every pokemon wouldn't actually put their latest catches to the test in these sort of scenarios?</br>  <br><br>anime power levels aren't linear.<br><br>pikachu fucks up megas and legendaries and loses to dickass babymons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not enough to be famous in a sport. He's way worse than every Elite Four member so thats 30 people above him plus all the people who beat him in tourneys there's like at the very very least 50 people who are above him. Do you know the top 50 basketball players or football players? No you only know like the top 5 such as Kobe Bryant and Lebron James. Ash isn't even top 50 pokemon trainers in the world so why would anyone know of him.</br>  <br><br>because he's 10 years old. everyone better than him is way older. ritchie was the exception but ash has long surpassed him.</br></br>  <br><br>What kind of message is that sending to kids?</br></br>  <br>Sometimes you win sometimes you lose?</br>  <br>We also know people like Kris Jenner who's crap at the sport but because he tapped a Kardashian he ends up being in the news. Ash doesn't just go into leagues, he beats the shit out of an international criminal organization daily, globetrots to every goddamn place in the world, and pulls off local newsworthy endeavors every town he visits.<br><br>As an athlete, sure, he's pretty crap, but saying a kid of 10 meeting up with another legendary pokemon, who also is the same guy that saved town X from a fire, town Y from a a huge theft attempt, and town Z from a natural disaster within the same area somehow doesn't get nationally known?</br></br></br>  <br>Where's this from anon?</br>  <br> Filler bird tournament <br><br>Nice one, rusemaster</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of loser gets on the podium with his losing team.<br>Has he no shame?</br></br>  <br>I just found out who Kris (is it actually with a "K"? Holy shit, I wish I hadn't found out about this faggot) Jenner was about an hour ago, but I was told he was an Olympic champion, which sounds pretty far above crap.<br><br><br>Let's say he's like top-fifty in the world in an individual sport or something. Sure, my mom probably won't know him, but if the guy who placed fourth or whatever in the Canadian championships shows up at the American ones, you bet people there will know his name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's over already?<br><br>Was the last battle good?</br></br></br>  <br>he lost<br><br>so no</br></br></br>  <br>My bad, Kris Humphries. Either or, agreed Ash should show up on someone's blip when he goes somewhere</br>  <br>This. Only a few names in a sport have massive recognition, but athletes or big fans will know them. It's like how we act as though everyone knows what Madoka is, except in the real world only a tiny fraction of people do.</br>    <br>Kid needs to start finding new careers shit is clearly not working for him. If this things continue his future will only lead to him being a drunkard and impregnating some whore and being forced to raise a kid while being a deadbeat dad. Now i want a sequel</br>  <br>Of course he's going to stick with the Pokemon he's currently traveling with. Got to train them up.<br><br><br>Nah. Ash called it back during Unova after the league, and dropped it off at Oak's lab when he got back to Pallet Town.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like you'll always fails when it matters.</br>  <br> Ash Ketchum was 10yo in 1997 <br>He's 32 you ignoramus</br></br>  <br> Ash places 2nd <br> He looks like he's 3rd <br>Fucking manlets.</br></br></br>  <br> 17 fucking years <br> still hasn't done shit with his life <br> still hasn't even done anything with his NEET experience <br> has met gods and saved the world many times over but can't win a small tournament of amateur trainers </br></br></br></br>  <br>he lost...a fucking fly race competition you retarded mothefucker</br>   this competition is boring <br> my feet hurt <br> are they using NFEs? plebs <br> I wish I was riding my altaria through the skies <br> tfw superior taste in pokemon <br> oh god why are they so fucking short, manlets <br> tfw best looking guy in the competition <br> wanting first place, its about the sport kid <br> OH GOD WHY AM I BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this guy was actually in the lead when Team Rocket pulled their shit on him. <br> he'd have won if not for them </br></br>  <br>he was actually offered to be turned pokemon master by Hoopa (leading legendary pokemon in the next movie),  but he declined the offer </br>  <br>No, Hoopa thought a Pokemon Master was an object it could summon for him and he had to explain it wasn't.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, had Mega Fug.</br>  <br>Hoopa is actually the dumbest pokemon design I've ever seen</br>  <br>what's that pokemon in the left?</br>  <br>Fucking Tobias, holy shit.</br>  <br>Yeah? The actual set of fucking keys doesn't do it for you?</br>  <br> Can't win a single tournament <br> But ends up saving the world multiple times over while meeting legendary pokemon and Gods that people thought were legends <br><br>Honestly, I wouldn't be disappointed if I was his dad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"you tried"</br>  <br>You think I'm watching this kiddy shit nerd?</br>  <br>What is the Orange League, and the Battle Frontier?</br>  Reminder that pokemon movies are not canon  <br> Hoopa is stronger than Pokemon that created the universe and Mega Fug <br><br>I still can't believe it.</br></br></br>  <br> hating based klefki </br>  <br>OL was filler.<br>He didn't win BF.</br></br>  <br>The cutest little fucker imaginable.</br>  <br> He didn't win BF. <br>He did.<br>He was offered position as a frontier brain but turned it down.<br><br><br>I don't like him much. I'm still salty about Sylveon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that they are.</br>  <br>you win you die</br>  <br>Is Hoopa the strongest Pokemon?</br>  <br>Hoopa is the master of all universes though.<br>Maybe. I didn't read the manga.</br></br>  <br>You would think creating a generic MC every 3 seasons or so wouldn't be THAT hard, just pick the next generation MC from the damn game. You could have loads of cameos from established world characters too. I'm really waiting for the entire show to end and a revival being done (better than the recent attempt) in a few years.</br>  <br>Hoopa did this.<br>Half as a joke.</br></br>  <br>Is that actually the league? He actually lost again? Ayyy and you faggots thought he would win and date that short haired girl</br>  <br> falling for a shitty ruse and not even reading the thread <br>Ayyy</br></br>  <br> Ash <br> pokemon anime <br> ever getting anything done <br>We'll be dead by the time the writers actually do something innovative or just discontinue the abomination.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lame. Red sucked in Origins.<br>I thank God that they knew what they were doing and didn't try making a new MC, we all know he would have been worse than Ash. <br><br>Plus Rica isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</br></br></br></br>  Sure is /v/ here today.  <br>This. Seriously the fuck are these autists doing here instead of on their actual board. No self respecting /a/non should be watching this garbage or taking it seriously.</br>  <br>I mean you, /v/tard. Go back there.</br>  <br>This might surprise you but much like Pokemon, much of the shit you watch is aimed at children.</br>  <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting.</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be /vp/rather</br>  <br>WHAT? He actually fucking did that?<br><br>The fucking people over on TTP really do make better decisions than Ash in the anime.</br></br></br>   Ash will never retire <br><br>defend this bullshit<br><br>they can't develop his character any further he is stale and at this point he is in the show mostly for shipping purposes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He had to. It wanted to stay to protect its family.<br>It's not like he just said "Well, I don't want you anymore, goodbye."</br></br>  <br>No, /vp/ isn't dumb enough to fall for OP's ruse.</br>  <br>Ash is a good character. He doesn't exist for character development. The show doesn't exist for character development. It exists for fun adventures and advertising. Not everything needs or exists for character development.<br><br>Not to mention they actually could develop his character further.</br></br></br>  <br>the writters hate Ash<br><br> the last thing of worth he actually won was almost 10 yrs ago <br> they gave him a pseudo just to release it <br><br><br>it was poor writing <br><br> ash has no good pokemon to fight clemont <br> hurr durr here is a pseudo legendary <br> press win button to win gimmick <br><br>ruined the gym match for me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the anime would be slightly better if it had a main character that could develop alongside its travelling partners. <br><br>Ash is stale.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because Ash isn't supposed to develop. He's just here to demonstrate the pokemon from the current game.</br>  <br><br>The nice thing about Ash is that his performance is actually consistent with his skill level. He did poorly in season 1 because he was new and naive, then progressed gradually in each season and league (except BW).<br><br>Meanwhile Origins Red is a complete fucking idiot but just plot armors his way to victory.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Electric pokemon defeated by electricity </br>  <br>I want to know why the grass-type didn't do anything to the ground type.</br>  <br><br> Cheater <br><br>You can bring your legendaries if you want, Ash has befriended so many of them that he could call them for the leagues, but he is a casual.</br></br></br></br>  Is he still waiting?  <br><br><br>I'm really hoping Ash swaps his Pokemon around in the XY League, like he did in Sinnoh.</br></br></br>  <br><br>of course he will, they need him to market megas.</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck the hell on off. The show has no fucking concept of character growth, every season they pull the whole "ash loses to low level gym leader so he has to train and learn a valuable lesson!" bullshit, and everyone involved in making that show has no fucking idea how the game works.<br> fucking rhyhorn OHKOing a jolteon with thunderbolt <br>That not the character sucking, thats the writers having no idea/not giving a fuck about how the ingame mechanics work</br></br></br>  <br>ash gave it away, he's not coming back</br>  Good thread imo  <br>Did Ash's Primeape ever come back?</br>  <br><br> anime has to adhere directly to the games <br><br>found the retard</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ash sucks, but Red doesn't suck, it's just the writer's fault! </br>  <br> <br>I don't know what game accuracy has to do with character growth, but I hope you're not implying Origins is better in either regard than the ashnime.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off. They're both steaming piles of shit, and I never said otherwise<br><br>It doesnt have to, but whenever i see something like hyperbeam being spammed with no consequences one episode, but then requiring the standard recharge the next I stroke out a little</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I don't even remember it liking him or him really liking it.</br>  <br><br>Remind me which episodes this inconsistency is in?</br></br>  So my brother is rewatching Pokemon on  Netflix  and Misty is cute as fuck.  <br>HAHAHA WHAT A FAGGOT</br>  At this point it feels like people are trying hard looking for reasons to hate ash<br> hurr hurr he doesn't catch'em all <br>dub exclusive tagline<br> durr he doesn't know type matchups <br>even though the anime makes it pretty clear that he does know about type advantages and disadvantages, but he is a trainer who thinks outside of the box and his battle style consists of doing unpredictable shit. Relying on types would be predictable<br> hurr he loses all his battles, he rarely wins <br>more like he rarely fucking loses. He might lose at the pokemon league but before that he's almost unstoppable<br> he's an idiot for releasing his strong pokemon <br>being a good trainer doesn't mean just having a bunch of strong pokemon, it means loving them, understanding them. Ash loves his pokemon and their happiness is more important to him than his dream of becoming a master.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any idea how many episodes there are?</br>  <br> tfw he will probably evolve <br>;_;</br></br>  <br><br>So they were expending less energy in one? Who gives a shit?<br><br>The game has stupid fucking rules too, like ground moves hitting flying pokemon that aren't flying types. Game mechanics are simplified abstractions of combat for the sake of playability, while the anime is more dynamic and not bound by arbitrary rules. It makes for more interesting fights.<br><br>tldr you're a faggot</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ash is pretty based this time around.<br> Maybe a little too based, unless they seriously plan to end it. <br>I think he could benefit from having a strategy sometimes though. He's getting too cocky.</br></br></br>  <br> ashnime </br>  <br> being a good trainer doesn't mean just having a bunch of strong pokemon <br>Yes it does, /vp/ agrees, don't bother them about it</br></br>  <br> like ground moves hitting flying pokemon that aren't flying types. <br>Stopped reading there<br> Thousand arrows doesnt fucking exist.jpg </br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember Pikachu doing this shit back in Kanto.</br>  I sometimes wish this show went the manga route and got new main characters for every season.  <br>He learns new moves every once in a while.</br>  <br><br>It didn't have iron tail in Kanto.</br></br>  <br>If anyone's in need of character development, it's fucking Pikachu. After it's complete 180 in the first episode, it's been essentially the same since.</br>  <br><br>I think you stopped even earlier because you clearly didn't fucking understand the sentence. Read it again.</br></br>  <br><br>are the manga MCs any different from each other? <br><br>they're blank slates in the games and i don't see the anime doing anything but generic hotblooded shonen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Remind me again how Ash loses the leagues when his Pokemon are capable pulling off this stuff.</br>  <br>He faces some faggot who has a team of legendaries</br>  <br>Ash really comes close to winning it during Sinnoh. His team was at his best. The writers had to introduce tobias with legendaries in order to stop him from winning the league. And he even manage to defeat 2 of tobias legendaries.</br>  <br>:( This always happens. At least Ash won the Battle Frontier.</br>  <br><br>Well you are comparing a 4-ep ova used to promote a megas over a multi season anime(which can show more on the character's journey)</br></br>  <br>Ash didn't use Infernape or Charizard against Tobias<br><br>always pissed me off<br>he had a 3-6 pokemon team that could fight Tobias but he didn't use them</br></br></br></br>  <br>noice 8th gen confirmed</br>  <br>It doesn't matter what team he used since they intended ash to lose against him.</br>  <br>And the orange island league.</br>  <br> NFE non-gimmick pokemon in a national tournament <br>Retard alert.</br></br>  is he still 10? haven't watched this shit since I literally was 10.   mfw I stopped watching somewhere in the middle of DP. <br><br>I heard that the XY series is good. Can I skip Unova? Should I watch the first XY movie with my imouto for nostalgia's sake?</br></br>  <br>BW is shit so it's better if you skip it.</br>  <br>I didn't watch Unova so yeah, you can skip that shit.</br>  <br><br> Stealth Rock <br> walk into a closet and masturbate for 30 minutes <br> come back, oh I beat Ash </br></br></br></br>  How is Pikachu not level 100 and fucking up everybody?  <br> level 100 pikachu <br> fucking up everybody </br></br>  <br> not getting fucking lazy with the random encounters <br> Not just putting a high ish level mon in front and spamming their strongest move <br> Giving a shit about type advantage when you end up 10+ levels higher than them </br></br></br>    Wait what the fuck, I first watched this shit when I was in kindergarten, how is this nigger still 10 or whatever?  Wait he beat the league already? Does that mean he has to split up with Serena? Fuck.  <br>I think you missed his point<br>Pikachu is a shitmon</br></br>  <br><br>Infernape was exhausted from its fight with Paul. Not sure what happened to Charizard, but the fact he didn't beat Darkrai with a Guts boosted STAB megahorn means the whole fight was bullshit, so it didn't matter.</br></br>  <br> implying Ash can even win the league </br>    <br> Stealth Rock <br> Hawlucha <br>Ya goofed</br></br></br>   Ash   For a show with the premise of mc wanting to become a pokemon master, the mc sure fucking sucks at everything.  <br>You mean<br> Yes it does, smogon agrees, don't bother them about it </br></br>  It's a good thing that /a/ has regular Pokemon threads now. The anime threads at /vp/ have become cancerous due to their excessive love for Serena. I haven't been there in a few weeks, since the shipping posts there got really bad.<br><br><br>The show is trying to give a message that winning isn't always everything.</br></br></br>  <br> The show is trying to give a message that winning isn't always everything. <br><br>what bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>Is Kirito your favourite character?</br>  <br>No but Kintaro is</br>  <br>His name is not ash ketchum damnit, fuken EFL</br>  shouldnt pikachu be fucking level 3000 at this point<br>why is he so weak</br>  For every moron here who clearly hasn't watched the anime in the last few years no that is not the League. Ash only recently beat the 6th Gym and and that's episode 77 that's a Sky Relay basically a race between Flying types the guy Ash lost to was it's Champion the last year and Ash nearly tied with him he only lost because his Noibat was born only a fucking episode ago (Episode 76) Can you fucks at least try with your hatred of Ash? Seriously for fucks sake.  <br>because the writters want Ash weak so he can easily lose the league and move on.</br>  <br>Didn't you know that the lifespan of one Pikachu is only one season? Right now he should be Pikachu #19.</br>  <br> being this ass blasted of an Ashfag </br>  <br>What i am ass blasted about are people who haven't watched the anime in years and somehow think they can talk shit about the Anime despite that and faggots like OP stirring up bullshit. Seriously how does Ash getting 2nd place only barely losing to the Champion of the previous year in a race mean he will lose the league?</br>  <br>And before anyone replies going 'hurr durr you think Ash will win the league XD' No i don't think that but i don't see how Ash losing a race to the previous Champion means he sucks dick and will lose the league. He WILL lose the league but i don't see why this means he absolutely will.</br>  <br><br> OL was filler. <br><br>The entire show is fucking filler</br></br></br></br>  <br>take a chill pill, Ash is definitely going to lose the league as seen in the previous 18 years. <br><br><br>you see you are being butt hurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that what i said? I know Ash is going to lose the league. My issue is that people somehow think a race means Ash sucks and will lose the league for sure. Instead they should base that upon the previous leagues where Ash has lost. I am headed to bed now goodnight you faggots</br>  <br>thanks for the blog</br>  <br>28 ?</br>  <br>Very little of what the average anon watches is targeted at kids.</br>  This actual league shit? Thought he still had badges to get.  <br> potential team filled with OU mons <br> trash </br></br>  <br>That shitty birb probably doesn't even have Gale Wings.<br> unironically using a Flame Body Talonflame </br></br>  Ash still has badges to get you fucking morons.  <br>Bravest bird doesn't need it</br>  <br>Faggots require so much<br> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts?tag<wbr>s=maydrawfag</wbr> </br></br>  <br>Sinnoh League was Ash at his strongest, so much so that the writers had to throw legendaries at him to justify him losing (he was also the only person to actually beat Darkrai in the entire tournament, and Tobias mentioned that Gible probably could've wrecked the rest of his team or something). XY is looking to be a return to that, especially now that they have a budget.<br><br>We don't talk about Unova.</br></br></br>  What bothers me so much is that Ash can't even grow up and be a mentor character to the next protagonist. <br><br>It would be easy as fuck. Have Cynthia be wowed by his performance and invite him into the Elite 4. Ten years later, a new trainer getting his first Pokemon meets him, and Ash offers to teach him the ropes. <br><br>But that status quo amirite<br><br><br>They are. For instance, while Red is obviously the most Ash-like and Green the most Gary-like, Blue is a con woman, Yellow is an ambiously-gendered newbie, Ruby is a clean freak contest nut, Sapphire is a gym expert raised in the wild, and Platinum is a rich girl with Diamond and Pearl as her wisecracking bodyguards. For starters. <br><br>Not to mention every protagonist has one part of Pokemon they excel at (Red for battling, Gold for raising Pokemon, etc). Crystal, for example, is known as the Pokemon Catcher because she has at least one copy of every non-legendary Pokemon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tell me again when ash wins kanto league</br>    Pikachu can defeat legendaries <br>  Loose against a fucking snivy on BW <br><br>I wish they could just throw this serie and start over with a true MC</br></br></br>   people reading nothing but the first post <br> falling for OP's ruse <br> shitposting about other people being retarded <br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>Black is hyper obsessed with beating the E4 to the point he needs a munna to clear his brain or he kinda blows a fuse.<br>White is obsessed with stage shows from what I recall<br><br>B2/W2 has Black being a detective and White being part of Plasma from what I remember as well<br><br>And then XY has Calem being a good trainer but hyper shut in because of paparazzi and Serena was flying co-ordinator I think? I honestly forgot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ash will kill himself before he turns 20</br>  Ash will progress in development the moment Misty and Brock come back. So never.  <br><br>We dont talk about BW</br></br>  <br>I wonder if they wanted a new protagonist in best wishes but then the idea was shot down and instead he was reset to moron for no real reason.</br>  Thanks Obama.  <br><br>What's also bullshit is that Darkrai could take a Megahorn from Heracross.<br>Should've OTK'd him right there</br></br></br>  <br><br>So what happened to Serena? Did Ash drown the soul of another virgin to stay forever young?</br></br>  <br>I think he had a Charizard at some point and always pulled it out of his ass to win gyms. That must've been the first season of the anime or something.</br>  <br>I'm have to give ash credit for coming in 2nd with his team not even being fully evolved.</br>   110 posters <br> at least 50 of them are retards falling for OP's ruse and making a single shitpost in response </br>  <br>not yet</br>  <br> serena <br> virgin <br>fahnny joek</br></br></br>  Based Murata strikes again.<br><br>Also, Onepunch Man thread.</br></br>  <br> saitama eating a baguette and pissing off that fucking cat in the background <br>based.</br></br>  On the topic of OPM, does anyone have the first version of the first Murata chapter?  any difference between the Web version and the paper version?  <br>he's feeding it, no?</br>  How high are the chances that we get a new chapter of OPM by ONE this July 1?  <br>mostly the same, but sometimes he redraws a few pages(like for the "animated" scenes) or designs and such, and of course sometimes he redraws some things to make them look a bit cooler<br><br><br>isn't it on the japanese online reader in the extra section?</br></br></br></br>    <br>When will they fix the "Draw by"?</br>  Find a flaw  <br>is that a trick question?</br>  So is anyone here a fan of oldschool anime? I would really like to make some friends here and exchange MAL, facebook or whatever.<br><br>I like "Mainstream" oldschools like Saint Seiya, but also more unfamous ones like Time Bokan, Wonder Three, Ghost Sweeper Mikami etc.<br><br>I would like to make your acquaintances ^-^</br></br></br></br>  No. <br><br>Get the fuck out, summerfag.</br></br>  Carried by the Wind: Tsukikage Ran is pretty good, its about 2 vagabonds, one, a wandering ronin, the other a chinese martial artists who wander from town to town doing various odd jobs to secure money for the ronins sake addiction.
