Funny how a "first world country" that is above the US has less restrictions on certain firearm related things where in the States you have to pay a tax stamp to the ATF for. We can have short barreled firearms here but in the states you have to pay. Here they won't let you obtain a license without having you put into a training class for around a year. Keep talking about a subject you are not educated on somewhere else.</br>  <br>Don't forget less gun related crimes here. The US has a very large population so expect a larger crime rate.

The first volume technically covers the main story arc of the first season. The difference being the park needed to get 100,000 visitors in 2 weeks in the LN.

I keep hoping. <br><br><br>You kidding, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>IRC's moved on other shows</br>  <br>People will always shit on KyoAni; it's only settled down now because Sound Euphonium is airing.</br>  <br>its just that the small minority who shits on everything popular to feel cool and do so so obnoxious it appears there are more of them then there actually are aren't around anymore because its not a currently airing show</br>  <br> Chuujou never got a service shot <br>KyoAni hating on small girls as usual.</br></br>   run after gave him the present <br>Fucking beta</br>  <br>?</br>  <br> &gt;watching anime exclusively if it has a girl you're attracted to </br>  Was "Nest" supposed to be translated as kindergarten instead?  <br>You don't need a "?".<br>That's exactly what I'M talking about. They didn't put any details into her midriff unlike the others, and to be safe they panned the camera so that her crotch doesn't show for more than a millisecond. <br>The difference between her and the others are ridiculously obvious, as is Kyoani's preference.</br></br></br>  <br> watching anime </br>  <br>FUCK YES YES YES CHRISTMAS HAS COME EARLY</br>  <br><br>You are a sad pathetic lonely little man</br></br>  <br> you're a squid now </br>  <br>She wasn't hunched over like the other 2 of course there wouldn't be any folds in her midriff <br><br>All 3 of them got pretty much the exact same screentime, lines and scene, but like most lolifags you're too caught up in your endless persecution complex to see anything</br></br></br>  <br>her dainty, wrist-out run was such a delight to see</br>  <br><br>Uh, why else would anyone watch anime? For the "plot"?</br></br>  <br>Uhh, fuck off to tumblr?</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up</br>   that's the whole episode <br><br>I need more</br></br>  <br>Others got details. Also they went out of their way to cut the camera always above her crotch/butt when possible.<br>It's no persecution complex. Just a different treatment and the usual "can't sexualize small girls".</br></br>  <br>Red Mage is my KyoAni background waifu.</br>  <br>Actually you are the one who should go back to MAL because you seem really new.</br>  How did it even sell? Season 2 might be a bit too hopeful anyways, but just to know.  Is Salama excited about Sento doing her part, or is she aroused by wearing Muse's outfit?  <br>You know, just spouting something like that might work in your anime club, my little landwhale, but is just shitposting here.</br>  <br>Uh, back the fuck off?!?!</br>  <br>Yes we get <br>You've made you're point now shut up</br></br>  <br>The later.</br>  <br> Red Mage <br> not the mermaids </br></br>  <br> this hot ass <br> their hot body </br></br>  <br> your substandard brain </br>  <br> All this qt girls  <br><br>Is it a requirement to be a cute to work at Amaburi Park?</br></br></br>  Jesus, it was only subs get released that IRC scum degenerates are coming. Life is sad indeed.  man would i love a 2nd season of this show, however far off the horizon that idea really is. show was truly enjoyable  <br> preSento <br><br>Glorious name.</br></br></br>  <br>I always love KyoAni for this. So many qt background girls. We still haven't gotten anything as great as the school festival arc in Hyouka, but this is still good.</br>   Just subbing his name as Kanye <br>I can dig it.</br>  <br>Sad for YOU!!!</br>  <br>underrated post</br>  <br>What are you talking about? <br>The anon who complaing about KyoAni mistreating the lolis were in every thread since the OVA raw was up.</br></br>  <br>Until now.</br>  <br> shortest girl is lower on the camera than the rest <br><br>Every scene was virtually the same. The camera didn't pan differently just to avoid showing her crotch. The entire kyoani studio is NOT conspiring to deny you in particular the opportunity to see more fan service. Get the fuck over it and stop posting.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, there's the club members in Hibike, but still not as great as Hyouka.</br>  Are there no Amagi x Kanye West mashups or am I just really bad at youtube?  <br>Boo fucking hoo. Go see a psychiatrist</br>  <br> school festival arc in Hyouka <br> <br>That was beyond amazing, anon. We will still be talking about It ten years from now.</br></br></br>  <br>No being cute is a requirement for anime characters in general. <br><br>Or the females at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

We can say the same thing about Latifa too. Not even a single butt shot or something that Sento had right away when she changed back to her old clothes.<br>But Chuujou's was just too obvious, enough to make me mad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was just fanservice and comedy. <br>It's was a great show, but it wasn't very special.<br><br>Still better than the shit we've got for the last 2 season tho, so I'll give you that. <br>I would actually kill for a season 2.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to convince anyone that I'm a rational person whatsoever. I'm obsessed with this. It just stings that your favorite characters never get a good shot you can be proud of.<br><br>Porn is completely different thing for me than fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait i thought Tamako Market was an adaptation too?</br>  <br>They've been working there for little under half a year, according to Latifa. Did the Oldementario wear the same outfits?</br>  <br>hopefully hang himself</br>  <br>Nope, Tamako Market was anime original. It has a LN or a manga I think, but they came after.</br>  <br>They published a Light Novel adaption of the anime a month after it ended. I guess KyoAni gets nervous if there isn't a Light Novel.</br>  <br>And? I see nothing done wrong here. If you don't like it go fulfill your sick fantasies elsewhere you degenerate</br>  <br>DAMN! LOOK AT DEM TITTIES!</br>  <br> did purposefully not <br>Just take a look at the kind of terminology you have to use to try and convince yourself of this.</br></br>  <br>Or you know,  Latifa doesn't remember anything over a year ago. </br>  <br>I don't need to try anything when it's so obvious.<br>KyoAni is doing this for a long time when it comes to small girls.</br></br>  <br>Yeah your life is really, really pathetic.</br>  <br>Spending time with /a/ are always magical hours for me.</br>  <br>She had 10 months worth of memories at the time she said that though. There were 4 months where those girls weren't working there.</br>  <br>You type like an ape and clearly lack judgement skills therefore you are just a random normalfag so your opinion is pretty much shit and irrelevant.</br>   mfw I've been seeding the OVA at 800kbps for almost four hours <br>I-I've never seeded so much before.</br>  came in this thread to bitch about moffle who just about ruined the show for me  <br><br> Someone who gets off to drawings of little girls is calling random people on the internet pathetic for calling him out on his pathetic shit <br>Examine your life and how it all lead up to this moment.</br></br></br>  <br>You know who else has been purposely intentionally not not avoiding sexualizing young girls for a really long time?<br><br>Most of the world. Are you convinced all that is a conspiracy too?</br></br></br>  <br>I will now type an argument that presents and intelligence level equivalent to yours. <br><br>Fuck off, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea I've never seeded all over the place so much before. This OVA has been killer.</br>  <br>I bet you didn't know the kyoani secret council actually only purposelessly didn't not intentionally put Moffle in the show just to ruin it for you. <br><br>Don't listen to people who would call me or you crazy it's so obviously true. .</br></br></br>   people on /a/ arguing about whose life is sadder <br>Really guys?</br>  <br>Conspiracy? No. <br>Doesn't mean I have to be glad that KyoAni is riding the globalization train hard.</br></br>  <br>I used a cat's thighs to masturbate. I won.</br>  <br>Just another day really</br>  <br>Did she hiss at penis?</br>   mfw Kanye was sitting in the toilet and all you could hear next to him <br> mii mii mii MII MII <br><br>Fucking kek.</br></br></br>  <br> lel everyone on /a/ is a loser amirite guys? <br>No you're not right.</br></br>  <br> not continously shoving it to the vagina of an almost newborn pony just to release as you push hard against it <br>You can't win this.</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying everyone is, but I'm willing to bet the people who argue about it are.</br>  <br> riding the globalization train hard <br><br><br>Phrase it however you want it won't change the fact that you paranoidly believe everything that doesn't pander to you is a conspiracy. <br>Kyoani has never been a loli porn studio as you seem to believe they were, and they aren't "intentionally not" drawing extra lines on a small girls stomach because of a "globalization train".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they should honestly just release the novels in america I'm sure there's plenty of autistic weeabo middleschoolers who'd be all over that <br><br>Start begging Yen Press</br></br></br>  <br>It's a fact that they purposefully cut down on drawing Chuujou, and only giving awkward shots instead of anything like the other two.<br>There's nothing paranoid in this. It was obvious, and it's no accident it happened to Chuujou, not the other 2.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, Anon, Magic Hour's up. It has pretty good rewatch value, though.</br>  <br>KUMIKO VA</br>  <br>Well anon I'm sure at least half the walls in your parents house where you live are covered in pictures and strings like this, but you need to remember that you're crazy, so what might seem obvious and "no accident" in your distorted eyes has a good chance of not even existing in the real world.</br>  <br>Looking kinda mindbroken there blood-chan</br>  <br> Those narrow hips <br> Those tiny eyes <br> The smallest piece of cake <br>She's bumming me out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The facts are there.<br>It's only Chuujou that didn't get a service shot.</br></br>  I want for every year KyoAni to make an OVA for Kanyes birthday. Let's promise to meet back here in a year from now to discuss the next OVA.  <br>Every character got the same shots. <br><br>Just because it didn't pander to you as hard as you want doesn't mean it didn't happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice hairclip<br><br>Shinka approves</br></br></br>  <br> every character got the same shots <br>If that were true, I wouldn't be pointing out how it isn't, would I?</br></br>  <br>Fan service doesn't melt steel beams</br>  <br>This anon speaks the truth</br>  <br>Is it normal to have a butt that juts out so much while running?</br>  <br>It reminded me of this.</br>  <br>Go back to 9Gag</br>  <br>You'd be "pointing things out" no matter what happened because you have a persecution complex so nothing will ever be good enough for you and you'll always be convinced it must be that way because of some conspiracy</br>  <br>Why so genki?</br>  <br>She nearly dies or is murdered almost every day so she has to enjoy every moment to its fullest.</br>  is this really the end?<br>i want more latifa</br>   kyoani never draws fan service of young girls omg the illuminati must be behind this!   <br> more Latifa <br>Kyoani hates her, so you are screwed either ways.</br></br>  <br>so perfect</br>  <br>Nothing about illuminati, but otherwise you are basically right.</br>  The outfit swap was glorious<br><br>Do you have the other stitches?</br></br>  Read the guide: buyfag.moe  <br><br>God. Damn! That is delicious. Skipped the first two, but that is looking seriously tempting.</br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>she's perfect anon, go for it</br></br>  Are there any Luvia figures anywhere? the UBW epilogue made me realize i need one  <br><br><br> no tan lines <br><br>disgusting, might as well oil up the previous version</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fucking Christ anon, why are you doing this to me?</br>  <br> tan lines <br>Worst fetish.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127267404 <br>Precisely because you own those creepy wax dolls</br>  <br><br>Holy shit you are gay as fuck.</br></br>  <br>wrong, that's because 3DPD isn't even close to the hotness level of PVC</br>  <br> Precisely because you own those creepy wax dolls <br>How would you know? Also how would you know about cause and effect in this hypothetical correlation?</br></br>  Give me my plastic already Uncle Sam.  <br> wrong, that's because 3DPD isn't even close to the hotness level of PVC <br>Last I checked PVC wasn't life-sized, didn't move and think on its own and wasn't warm to touch (via self-heating).</br></br>  <br>Have you checked with your post office?</br>  <br><br>get over yourself, any fag can throw themselves at a 5/10 3DPD and get laid. PVC is for those who won't be satisfied with that, they want the unreachable 10/10, and instead turn "beauty" into an unattainable ideal in the form of a figure. Something to admire, but never reach.</br></br>  <br>I haven't gone over there, but I haven't received any notice from them asking me to either. All my other shit has been delivered to my apartment so I'm not sure why they're holding it.</br>  <br><br>Pick it up then.</br></br>  <br>That's some deep shit anon.</br>  <br>You won't know until you ask (them, not /a).</br>  <br><br>your loli got jacked</br></br>  <br><br>Thank you raita</br></br>  <br>I hope not.</br>  <br>It's beautiful anon.</br>  <br>I don't know about you, but I've never tied this hobby with real life. One can perfectly handle collecting figures of girls without having to draw comparisons. It's the same for gaming, people don't play games because they want realism.</br>  Did you order her, /a/?  The face on this fig seems not accurate  <br>No, why would I do that?</br>  <br>Yes but only to fund S3. Alice a shit.</br>  <br>Will we get Karen?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Hell no, Alice is by far the worst kinmosa</br>  <br>I hope so. I want a set of all the Kinmozas.</br>  <br>Nah, I'll wait for the nendo. I don't need a scale of Alice.</br>  <br>Torsos that short always look like crap to me.</br>  <br>Fosse farm teaparty set.<br>They could sell it in the gift shop.</br></br>    When?  <br>When?</br>  <br>When?</br>    <br><br>a little unrelated to /buy/ fagging but i was wondering weather i should stay in a traditional Ryokan in Tokyo or go full modern nip. <br><br>Are Ryokans over-rated?</br></br></br></br>  <br>When?</br>  <br>she looks great, but<br> no tail </br></br>  <br>When?</br>  <br>Cute!</br>  <br>maybe ask /jp/?</br>  <br>It's sort of funny how even japanese people pretending to not be overly weeb are annoying.<br><br>And the full blown weeb Karen is the more popular one.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to one today in hakone. They actually look really good and comfy as fuck.</br>  Fuck I'm getting addicted to key frame artwork  <br>Why is it when someone new to anime asks why all the Japanese girls have round eye and hair that isn't black every one responds with<br> hurr durr you don't understand the history and culture they are not trying to look western. <br><br>Then why the fuck to they have pink nipples every time they are shown nude. Nips do not have pink nipples they're brown.</br></br></br></br>  I have an extra ticket for the FS/N event at AX, 6 rows from the front unrestricted view, because I bought it with premiere. Anyone want it or know where a good place to sell it is?  <br>They have just as much nipple diversity as the western world.<br>http://i.imgur.com/bwbdxo7.jpg</br></br>  <br>Nips do not even find each other attractive. Thus the population decline.</br>  <br><br>thanks anon</br></br>  <br> Nips do not have pink nipples <br>Watch more JAV</br></br>  <br>When?</br>  <br>Finally someone posted something I actually care about</br>  <br><br>So it's a darker repaint of this ?</br></br>   Best animated episode of anything fate related airs today <br> Preorder opens <br><br>Fuck you Aniplex<br>That is dirty and you know it.<br>Manipulating people to spend money.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes because she's cute</br>  <br>Wish I could get into Fate because it seems to have a lot of good figures. I tried the first episode of Fate/Zero but it was so goddamn pretentious and dense I nearly fainted.</br>  <br> Starting with F/Z  <br> Prequel meant to be read/watched after the main story <br><br>You already fucked up</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hairy ears <br>It just don't work on 3D.</br></br>  <br><br>I want Cocoa.</br></br>  <br>i WANT TO DEEPTHROAT THAT STOMACH</br>  <br>Yeah I made the mistake of chancing upon it on Netflix, because for some reason that's the only one they have on there. Then I realized my mistake but was already put off.<br><br>Maybe one day.</br></br></br>  <br> Best animated episode of anything fate related airs today <br>You mean aired last week</br></br>  <br>Last week was 2nd to best.<br><br>Epilogue was beyond perfection</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, not feeling it. I like Rin but I can't get past the costume to make me want to own it. Since it's limited release, I can see scalpers making a quick buck on it.</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't know what would I recommend to anyone wanting to start with F/SN. <br><br>The first route is a borefest, yet you need to read it to get UBW, F/Z not so much, since it's a prequel you can watch it without knowing almost anything and still enjoy it, you're only going to get some minor references that honestly aren't that important. <br><br>F/SN original anime is a fucking train wreck that no one should even attempt to watch.<br><br>That pretty much leaves only F/Z as a good quick starting point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but it was so goddamn pretentious <br>The whole series is pretentious, each route in F/SN is 15 hours of pure written bullshit that tries to be smart or complex.<br><br>The most memorable parts of the writing are all the mollusk metaphors in the sex scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You have them read it in the order it is meant to be. That is it. It is not a hard concept, it may not be the easy way but it is the best way.</br>  <br>Fate/Zero spoils some parts of Fate/Stay Night. I think the UBW anime does a pretty good job of making itself friendly to secondaries, so I'd say start there.</br>  <br>When did READ THE VN stop being the automatic response? Fate route isn't anywhere near as bad as it's made out it be, nor are UBW or HF anywhere near as good as they're made out to be.</br>  <br>second worst girl</br>  <br>and a shiny finish</br>  <br>When animeonlyfags jumped on the bandwagon at UBW pre-airing then speed ran the VN so they could shitpost.</br>  <br> speed ran the VN <br> not watching others do it on YT at 1.5x speed </br></br>  Soon, hopefully everyone of you Americans have preordered this babe for 4th of July.  <br>That's fucking disgusting for so many reasons.</br>   Friendly reminder that Good Smile Company has a re-release request form. <br><br>http://partner.goodsmile.info/suppo<wbr>rt/eng/inquiry/</wbr></br></br>  <br>1,5x is not enough</br>  <br>I just want a Rin in her long red coat.<br>My dick likes that outfit</br></br>  <br> not preordering the best Pochaco </br>  Can some kind anons help e-mail TOM requesting the new Tohsaka Rin fig so we don't have to proxy her.

So I'm not going to sell them below retail. I'd rather just give them away to a friend if that's the case.</br></br>  <br> I'd rather give it to a friend in that case <br>If you make friends with the inquiring anon and sell at retail or under to him, you could consider it a profit.

She got a botched boob job I believe, after she quit porn, then she tried to bleach her nipples and they look neon pink and fake now. Then she went back into porn with those hideous mangled tits. Before she left porn her last movie was of her getting her head completely shaved and guys jizzing on her skinhead. So that's the kind of girl that makes decisions like bleaching her nipples.<br><br>Bleaching your ass and pussy is far more common and less prone to disaster.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Aniplex/Stronger give us this <br> Alter does this <br><br>Fucking Altair and their hatred of muscles.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>non PD 3D is getting better</br></br>  <br>cute. who is it though?<br><br><br>more clothes the better. i don't want half naked male or female figures.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Except his arms looks like twigs</br>  never ever  <br><br>That's not the point, but how far off he looks from any of the source material, either original or the new UFO version.

Obviously that's a big difference.<br><br>The only reason you say shit like this is because most of your preorders aren't paid in full, or you don't have that many preorders.<br><br>Anyone else is just high life-ing it or delusional, because 4k in entertainment funds is a lot even for me that works for 80k a year.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So do I, and thankfully now with the TV Series and the GEB Remake the chances of more figures are high.</br>  <br>Of course not. Do you know how archaic MMD code is?</br>  <br> Absolutely no one wants to pay in full. <br><br><br>Actually I'd be glad to pay upfront for all my preorders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are just wrong, anon, there are plenty of videos done with MMD and directly ported to different engines such as Cryengine, actually most of the good videos do it with different engines</br>  <br>Doesn't even matter for me in the end its the same amount. Its not like they release all preorders in one month....They do preorders every month too.</br>  <br>You think GE-chan will get a scale?</br>  <br>Sadly I don't think so, previous Neptunia collab characters have gotten jackshit for the most part, hell even the main cast is mostly untouched by the PVC industry.</br>  <br> I would have $4k less in my entertainment fund <br>no you wouldn't. you already have 4k$ in your entertainment fund earmarked for your preorders anyway. It makes no fucking difference.<br><br>It's not liquid money because it's already allocated for purchases. Just sending it their way would make very little difference.</br></br></br></br>  So, what are some statues/figures that you didn't get when had the chance, and you now regret not getting?<br><br>Let's suffer together.</br></br>  <br>Just buy her? There are always a few copies of her being sold at Mandarake.</br>  <br>Oh, that was just a statue I thought about getting. Just needed a pic to grab attention.</br>  <br>I don't know how I feel about paying over 9k for a nendo.</br>  <br>I've only been in the hobby for about 6 months, so pretty much fucking everything.</br>  <br><br>One of my favirite 3D Hentai</br></br>  <br>This figure. It's not something I trust to not be glued second hand either.<br><br>I'm just going to keep praying they make a futa Kitami in the future.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking what is that figure body? I MUST own it.....also where do you buy those collars separate?</br>  <br>Is she smuggling some oreos under her top?</br>  <br>That makes me sad.</br>  <br>Filename please.</br>  <br> Akuma no Oshigoto </br>  <br> Thanks </br>  <br>&lt;- Body<br><br><br>Also , the collar should be from a different figure</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>I'd suggest  Affect3D - Girl Friend Forever  and anything from  umemaro  best 3D porn ever made<br><br>also, question: has your fetish ever been made into a PVC figure? pic related, its mine too bad its a GK, but I've got potato demon on pre-order</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's some sick fetish you have, anon</br>  <br>Kudos to you for your nice taste. these are favorites of mine too</br>  <br> Absolutely no one wants to pay in full. <br>I prefer to pay for my figures in full ahead of time. Getting that shit out of the way ahead of time is nice on the nerves. The option to pay ahead of time, as well as better discounts, is why I usually go with Big in Japan for my orders.</br></br>  <br>Why does she look like she belongs on the front page?</br>  <br>Cash is cash. Situations change and unless you're being made to it's not a good idea to pay before you have to, as a general financial principle. For something this (relatively) small, I get it, but on a conceptual level  has it right.</br>  <br>She's pops up on Mandarake all the time, but she's pretty expensive now.</br>  <br>As a practical principle you should only buy things when you already have the money, so paying upfront should represent no issue if you are not a retard who is living day by day and only with your latest paycheck.<br><br>You should have separate funds for emergencies .</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.psychologytoday.com/blo<wbr>g/the-edge-choice/201207/the-way-we<wbr>-spend-impacts-how-we-spend</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> you should only buy things when you already have the money <br>Not the guy you responded to, and in general I agree with this, but for large purchases (a car, a house) that can prove extremely difficult. I know some might consider those normalfag things, but having my own place free of landlords, noisy neighbors, and rental agreements would be nice.</br></br>  Hi, guy who was making the MFC Ads site here.

Most of what you have should be going into investments, and your checking should be kept relatively small. The longer your money stays in your hands, the more profit it makes for you. Money's value decays over time, so paying the same dollar amount later means you have effectively paid less, so long as you've put that money to work in the mean time. <br><br>As I said, this is small shit, and even a few thousand won't really make a difference for this kind of talk, but again, keep your money with you when you can. Why give it away sooner?<br><br><br>I guess it varies per person, but most of what I purchase is something I'm going to buy regardless. I buy maybe a figure every other month and it's something I really want. Pre-orders in general exist for the reasons that you're describing (to suck the purchaser in), but if you're smart about it and think about what you're buying that effect can be mitigated.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree that's a set of rules that differs from big purchases like the ones you mentioned, I was talking about money spent on stuff that is part of your hobby or mere recreational.</br>  <br> Why give it away sooner? <br>Ordering things without paying for them feels like buying things on credit. It's not something I like to do.</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127281114 <br> Affect3D - Girl Friend Forever </br></br>  <br> Ordering things without paying for them feels like buying things on credit <br>I guess. Money is money to me.</br></br>  <br> The longer your money stays in your hands, the more profit it makes for you. <br><br><br>Not at all and you even mention it, that money should be invested and flowing to create dome profit, otherwise is pointless. <br><br>Also, that only works in a monetary system where parity and exchange rates are not an issue. In reality the tiniest fluctuation would counter the whole profit that tiny fund might have created.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you want to derive more enjoyment out of what you consume (think about going on vacation but being stressed about how much various things cost) then pay for the experience in advance. Doing so decouples the pain of paying from the consumption of the experience.  <br>It explains so much. Prepaying for something takes money away immediately, which can feel bad, but then when the item ships and you don't have to deal with the email/payment, you can fully enjoy the figure without associating it with the deduction from your bank account.<br><br><br>In that case, I agree with you fully. As a rule, I don't like to preorder something I don't already have the money for. If I can pay in advance, it's even better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127281114 <br>see   Affect3D - Girl Friend Forever </br>  <br><br> title was already mentioned in the thread <br> you spoonfeed the retard who didn't read <br><br>Why are you doing this?<br>Why do you support stupid people who shit up the board?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Spoonfeeding retards <br>I barely skimmed past your conversation and I was able to figure it out within a second.</br></br></br>  <br> Not at all and you even mention it, that money should be invested and flowing to create dome profit, otherwise is pointless. <br>That's exactly what I'm saying, though. Keep your money with you as long as possible and only give it away when necessary. Plus emergencies could happen, other purchases could come up, any number of things could change and in that case it would be to your benefit to have your money in your hands.<br><br> Also, that only works in a monetary system where parity and exchange rates are not an issue.  <br>Uncertainty means it's even better to have your money with you. Unless you're anticipating changes to happen, that's just noise that can't be accounted for anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Plus emergencies could happen <br>if figure purchases make a dent into your finances maybe you should cut back on figures</br></br>  <br> that's just noise that can't be accounted for anyway. <br><br><br>Actually it can, people make profit out of the natural behaviour of the exchange rates. That's how Forex is profitable If it was uncertain nobody would consider it a safe investment.<br><br><br>For example, is natural for the yen to go down around april, which is the close of the fiscal year for Japan and when Abe has been injecting printed money.<br><br><br>Also, , if you need a fund for emergencies that is by nature not money you will have working to make a profit for you. You are just avoiding to pay to keep it within your hands which is retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never saw crymore1, was it any good?</br>   went from 0 scales to 3 <br>This is pretty fun all I had before were nendos</br>  <br>Cry of the Year.</br>  <br>Fuck off, these are the types of people you help when you spoonfeed: </br>  <br> Keep your money with you as long as possible <br><br><br>Again, that's not how it works, for money to be kept alive you should invest and get returns as fast as possible. Otherwise is stagnant money and is just naturally depreciating.</br></br></br></br>  <br>pleb</br>  <br>Not that dude but I earn $800 a month while in school. I cannot work more hours because that time is devoted to school work.<br><br>$450 for rent<br>$150 for utilities<br>$75 for car insurance<br>$45 for gas<br>leaving me exactly $80 a month for food<br><br>For some of us, especially those of us in school, living paycheck to paycheck is a necessity. I am only able to spare money for figs rarely. So please don't make assumptions on what anons finances are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nothing ever confirmed that his suggestion in the spoiler was going to be what he posted in succession. It's reasonable to assume that the two are unrelated at first</br></br>  <br>4chan is changing. Afraid?</br>  <br>You don't like being thanked when you behave like a samaritan?</br>  I want /biz/ to wrap it up or leave.  <br>Yeah, same as stock markets, but it's inherently highly fluctuational and you don't have any clue which way it's going to go. If you do, go invest. It goes both ways, too. Paying later would be more beneficial if the yen is going to weaken between the purchase date and the preorder date.<br><br><br> Otherwise is stagnant money and is just naturally depreciating. <br>No more so than if you paid it immediately.<br><br>The people arguing against me here seem to have a lot of reasons why I'm wrong, but very few arguments as to why they're right. The best I've seen is "it's annoying" and "I don't like pre-ordering, it feels like credit". If that's the reasons, then I think we'll just have to agree to disagree.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Grabbing this mikubutt for very cheap, this will be my first scale of her, I like the 2010 racing miku's design a lot too. I was gonna just grab the prize figure because she's pretty cheap but I found a seller selling her scale for 10 dollars more, and what's more he's reputable.  <br><br>i personally spoonfeed to trigger people like you</br></br>  <br>I still rank higher than you, child of sin.<br>Don't mess with me I've killed before</br></br>  <br>no it isn't. it's just retards who try to justify their existence.</br>  <br>Not surprised, seeing how you type.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>you're missing the point, you're making the board worse by being welcoming to people who are entitled little shitheads that want everything presented on a silver platter to them.</br>  <br>It has been pointed several times before, your logic is flawed when you mention that you should keep your money with you.<br><br>By nature, the money you keep is money that wont make a profit. Which is the exact same as paying in advance. And you have mentioned a fund for emergencies, which is the exact same as having the money not flowing and would yield the exact same result as if you paid for something in advance.<br><br>If you invest it then the money is not with you anymore, nor in your hands.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey at least over all figure quality is only going up.</br>  <br> your logic is flawed when you mention that you should keep your money with you. <br>I meant it in the sense of "keep it with your investments and current holdings". I'm not literally suggesting you hold onto cash, that's both dumb and contradictory to what I'm saying myself.</br></br>  <br> Implying they actually care about that <br>There's a reason why he's spoonfeeding and replying with "lol u mad".</br></br>  <br>Far more annoyed by the bitching that always results from spoon-feeding and ends up derailing threads.</br>  <br><br>triggered<br><br><br><br>i don't browse /a/ enough to care, and the reactions simply spoonfeeding a random anon here and there get from autismos is well worth it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you don't have any clue which way it's going to go <br><br><br>Read above, if that was true nobody would be profiting constantly from those. You can actually find patterns and analyze to have a stable source of profits by mere thinking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you would be far more annoyed if those entitled babies became the norm because they come to expect being given a source.</br>  <br>I don't think you get what I'm saying here. You're saying paying later "only works in a monetary system where parity and exchange rates are not an issue". I'm saying it's a two way street that you (you, personally, anon that I am talking to) are not generally capable of predicting. Even if you are capable of predicting, that would mean that in some situations you'd prefer to pay immediately (when the yen will get stronger) and in other situations you'd prefer to pay later (when the yen will get weaker). This is really neither here nor there, though.</br>  <br>I don't understand why they come here if they don't care about /a/. Unless they're just crossboarding shitposters.</br>  <br>Then don't spoonfeed in the first place, problem solved.</br>  <br> is the exact same as having the money not flowing and would yield the exact same result as if you paid for something in advance. <br><br>Yeah, exactly the same, except you'd have the money if an emergency came up. Seriously, if the only downside is "oh no, I have to click a button and pay money from my bank account right before it ships instead of 6 months before", then fuck it, I'll keep my $100 for those six months.</br></br></br>  How about them figs?  think we'll see a painted proto at wonfes?  <br>I really wouldn't.<br>A source or a name is absolutely nothing. <br>If they were asking "where to buy" or something that's clearly stated in the guide or common sense, then sure I'd be a little annoyed.<br><br><br>Got the wrong guy there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> except you'd have the money if an emergency came up. <br>you should have that either way.</br></br>  <br>There must be something horribly wrong with you finances if the money spent on PVC asses is enough to back you up in an emergency.</br>  <br>What? Asking for source is the same shit as asking where to buy. <br><br>finding a store -&gt; skill required on buyfag threads<br><br>finding source -&gt; skill required on 4chan<br><br>We have a plethora of reverse search options, file names and what-not at our disposal for that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And what do you think comes after "tell me whats dis"? It's an actual slippery slope from there.</br>  What is the best miku?  <br>They asked for source when it was in the damn conversation. It's the same shit, stop defending it.</br>  <br><br><br>Then call it a change of plans, whatever. Point is, money you have in your hands is in your power. If I have a budget of $200/mo to spend on whatever I like, then I spend it on figures, I'll be fucked if my friend invites me to go to AWA in September (unless I want to break my budget, which is bad). But if it's pre-order, I can just cancel. No problem.</br></br></br>    <br><br>I only lurk these threads because most of the time it has faster and better info than most places. Could care less about the overall board, /a/ good times ended for me after Steins;Gate, those were the last enjoyable threads, basically because people wasn't as autistic and retarded as they are now, shitposters would get ignored and discussion of the anime actually happened, not just muh waifu, my taste&gt;your taste and other retarded things.</br></br>  <br>And that's exactly why your finances are fucked, you don't have an extra hundred dollars to spend on other things?</br>  <br> But if it's pre-order, I can just cancel. <br>sure, if you want to get banned from shops. maybe some of us don't want that?</br></br>  <br>They can't even fucking google, you goddamn fucking newfag. Almost all of /a/ is more than fucking happy to provide the source if it's obscure shit that you can't find. You're justifying faggots being lazy shits because "you don't mind"? Fuck off, you don't even browse here. People like you should be crucified.</br>  <br>Some of us don't take back what we decide on. How about you think twice before ordering if just 200 dollars put you in such a tight spot?</br>  <br>So scary.</br>  <br>You can cancel pre-orders without problems. I've canceled half a dozen things from hobbysearch over the last 2 years (mostly stuff I ended up ordering somewhere else). It's when you don't pay after they've received the item that it's a problem.<br><br><br><br>I don't know what to say to you guys. I'm not sure what bothers you so much about paying later or why you can't see that it's better to have money you can use rather than money you can't, but I'm done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why are you ignoring reasonable arguments and just spout empty responses?</br>  <br> Long black hair <br> Armor <br> Tony <br>I'm buying this without playing the source.</br></br></br></br>  <br> skill required </br>  <br>Good argument.</br>  <br>Except thats not money I can use, once I order I plan to actually get it and I set aside that much. I don't like to keep around stupid scapegoats when my finances already can handle any potential "emergencies"</br>  <br>Not part of the argument. Just funny to me how angry he is.</br>  <br> Crossboarder who spews "hurr durr autist", thinks the board should accommodate him, and likes S;G <br>This fits the stereotype so perfectly that I can't even get angry. Please tell me you're from /v/, that would be the cherry on top of the cake.</br></br>  <br>And that's the problem, you are thinking that your money is unallocated when you already decided AND pretty much signed to buy something.</br>  <br> i can post smug faces guys, i love shitposting on /a/ <br>You only come to ruin our board because Reddit and /v/ are the biggest festering shitholes around. I literally don't understand why newfags like you don't even bother lurking and just post your retarded fucking shit all over boards that clearly don't want you. But no, you'll continue to post another smug reaction imagine and reply with ':^)' or 'you mad?? xd' because you've got nothing that warrants you to actually be here, because you're not actually, y'know, one of us.</br></br>  <br>pretty good, if I had real money I could see myself getting into dollshit</br>  <br>I need more figures of smug girls.</br>  <br> Smugposter <br>So you also ruin one of the few other threads I go into outside of the buyfag threads. Fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should get a figure of  ___me___ </br>  <br>You are american, right?</br>  <br>Yes. Does that make a difference?</br>  <br>Anoon-chan, ahegao is not a smug face.</br>  <br> can't post smug nowadays without being likened to newfags like the fag in this thread. <br>Neat.</br></br>  <br>so are the prices 12k figures everywhere ;_;</br>   nohr strap box outranking hoshitdo strap box on ami <br><br>Yes.</br></br>    <br>just don't use a smug face as some sort of "argument" in a discussion and you're fine.</br>  <br>O-oh.. gomen.</br>  <br> i only came here for Reddit's favorite anime <br> but i act like i'm such a hardened oldfag while shitting all over threads and spoonfeeding newfags like me <br>Fuck right off.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, just makes obvious the reason for your tactics and entitlement, most countries actually don't have the option t o be a faggot and back off from your purchases decisions.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Shinoa specifically, her fanbase is a bunch of drooling retards.</br>  http://a.uguu.se/lhydin_asukacum2.w<wbr>ebm</wbr>  <br>I'm not sure why you're trying to characterize me as some kind of evil person manipulating the poor Japanese companies for my own financial gain, or something. I'm just saying if something came up I'd rather do with the money, I'd like to have the money in my hand. The only argument I've heard to the contrary is that it's less annoying, which I don't agree with.</br>  <br>I wasn't the one arguing for spoonfeeding and I hardly watch anything currently airing, but thanks for that needless reactionary boogieman. Stop trying so hard to fit in, it's obvious as fuck.<br><br><br>Alright then. I thought you meant in general.</br></br></br></br>  <br>opening doors also is a skill. pretty much required in modern society.<br>didn't say it's an advanced skill</br></br>  <br> And I hardly watch anything currently airing <br>Steins;Gate isn't airing you fucking retard. Go back to /v/, you're the only one trying to fit in.</br></br>  <br>I guess, it just sounds silly i suppose.</br>  <br>The point is that there's something questionable about your finances when your "emergency money" is the same as the one you already spent on figures.</br>  Mamma mia  <br>It's not. Can we stop with the ad hominem attacks, please? All I'm saying is that if something came up, that money could be useful. It's not of any use to you once you've paid it.</br>  <br>Go back to posting pepe and calling people cucks, /v/</br>  <br>How am I supposed to know what Reddit's favorite anime is you flagrant dicksucker?

I don't understand your logic: as soon as you've preordered, that money is already spent. It's not of use to you in any way, regardless of whether or not you've already paid for it. Spending the money you've already dedicated toward buying something is just silly, anon. In fact, I think you're exactly the kind of person who should pay for things in advance. Dedicating those funds ahead of time keeps you from wasting your money on random stuff and then suddenly being shocked when the release date comes around and you don't have the money anymore.</br>  <br>Her and the Muramasa Nisei.

As long as you still have it, you have the power to do something different with it. You can cancel, you can take your money and use it on something else. No, this isn't something you'd want to do frequently, but it's an option you have and it's a positive over the alternative (i.e., not having that option) no matter how you look at it.<br><br> wasting your money on random stuff and then suddenly being shocked when the release date comes around and you don't have the money anymore. <br>This has never happened to me. I pay my credit card off every month, and I only buy what I have budgeted for myself. Liquidity is still a plus.<br><br>The thing is, I don't see a negative to paying later. I do see a positive to it (liquidity). The only arguments I've seen are  "I don't like it" and  "I want to get it out of the way". If this is important to you, whatever, I don't get why it matters but it's your money to give. I don't mind paying for something later, that money was there for it the whole time and it's not like it's any more of a hassle to pay for it when the release date comes up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Been waiting on color of this one myself.<br>Maybe WonderFest?</br></br>    <br> you've already said you don't go on /a/ <br> How am I supposed to know what Reddit's favorite anime is you flagrant dicksucker?

I still disagree with you, but I also realize that it's stupid to get worked up over how other people manage their own money. Someone actually bitched at me earlier this week for putting rent money away in advance, if you can believe that. So if it works for you, then keep doing it, I guess.

Season 1, and season 2.  <br>Ah, welcome back, captain!</br>  <br>Thanks, I drink too much at the end of a season that I enjoyed.</br>  <br><br>What is affluenza for 500?</br></br>  <br><br> ride is over <br> anime ended on a cliff hanger <br><br>Ride has just begun anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br><br>We're missing too much information to know exactly what the deal is with that family. How healthy or unhealthy they are remains to be seen.<br><br>All we know is that they produced one warped but very capable daughter and one warped but extremely incapable daughter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it's not been covered properly yet, they've just been dropping hints (In the LN mostly, anime cut a bunch). We'll have to wait on the volume 11 translations (In which Yukino will hopefully finally explain it to Yui and Hachiman).</br>  <br>No, it's a shitty show where basically nothing is ever explained so it makes little sense unless you've read the source material and the fact that it is so objectively vague encourages conversation about it all the time because everyone interprets it differently. But not because it's a rich piece of art with many interesting things to discuss. Rather because it's just kind of a bad show but /a/ is invested because the self-insert as 8inch.</br>  <br>This whole show is fucking awkward drama. <br>Jesus christ it is physically hurting me to watch right now. <br>Why is everyone socially retarded in this.<br><br>Why can't it just be fun like the first season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure but she's been doing that effectively the entire series. I mean the first GENUINE scene would not have happened without her.<br><br>Viewing it all as a scheme by her just to help her friends suggests no actual growth on her part.<br><br>At least to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to that anon that insisted Yukino would never like 8man and that there would never be a love triangle? He also said that Yui wouldn't be hurt by losing 8man and was falling out of love with him.  <br> The ride is over <br><br>I want to believe so but for some reason I just keep coming back.</br></br></br>  <br><br>fucking this it doesn't even make sense any more its just awkward moments and bizarre passive aggressive conversations that are never explained</br></br>  <br><br>It suffers heavily from "read the LN for context" syndrome.</br></br>  <br>continuing fro last thread.<br><br><br>From LN vol 9 ch 3<br><br> “…Are you going to do it by yourself again?” <br><br> Even in this encroaching darkness, I could see her face very clearly. Her sorrowful cast down eyes and the weakly biting of her lips. I even thought that I did all this just so she didn’t have to make that kind of face. <br><br> As I tried to push away the squeezing feeling in my chest, I quickly moved my feet forward. <br><br>by your definition 8man loves Yui, isn't it?<br><br>Oh something more to add from Vol 10,5 ch 3 :<br><br> With a feeling of bewilderment, I found myself turning around to see Yuigahama wearing a frail smile. <br><br> “…I don’t really like seeing you in pain, Hikki.” <br><br>So their love is Mutual isn't it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is the worst girl.  <br>Her issues and love are two different things.<br>She already had an interest in 8man before those issues even began to surface, by the time she fell in love with him he did the Ebina confession which caused her "unexplainable feelings" that she hated.<br>After the whole StuCo thing he betrayed her expectations again, kinda contrasting the same way she betrayed his, at this point she was trying to fall out of love telling him to stop forcing himself to show up if he didn't want to, and to not be considerate of her and Yui.<br>Once "genuine" happened, the Ice Queen was already melting away, instead of falling out of love she fell even harder for him.<br>None of this was her being dependent on him.<br><br><br>I want to believe that Hachiman is in love with her but he needs to realize it first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   gay marriage is legal now <br> no one posting that shitty trap <br><br>Senseifags where are you? you guys are more tolerable than these iroha/yui queers</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that there isn't a love triangle and Yukino isn't in love with 8man (read her memorandum) <br><br>Houly reminder that there is only one girl who loves her Hikki.</br></br>  <br>Yuifag, the LN is written to be a cash cow. The fictitious girls all have a good stake for a damn good reason: moolah.<br><br>The anime's ending reflects this, and the director's inability to work past it. The possibility for spinoff material remains open, if the LN closes sometime soon, and nobody is terribly inflamed with this ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Typical k-drama rich family.</br>  <br><br>8man has very unreliable narration when it comes to Iroha. Take their date for instance.<br><br> Our walking pace must’ve dropped due to the both of us thinking how much trouble we were. <br><br>Do you think someone would walk slower with someone they're irritated by? 8man goes as far as making an oxymoron because he won't admit to the narrative that he had fun. In fact in general he only really has poor things about the date, but by the end it's clear he enjoyed himself.<br><br>8man is tsun as fuck for Iroha and it's clear he wouldn't internally admit it even if he did love her. Granted, that doesn't mean we can just assume every love where he says he's not in love with her, that he actually is. However, it does at least mean we have to account for the possibility of unreliable narration.<br><br>I think the chocolate scene was a bigger deal because it's the closest he's come to actually, honestly admitting his feelings for any girl. However, that doesn't mean the cookie scene can be written off as nothing. 8man was clearly very excited to get something baked by Iroha, especially when you compare his reaction to later for instance. He's emotionally touched by getting Yui's cookies, however he's not frozen, blushing, and thinking about love in his own roundabout fashion when he gets them from her. (Granted the mood is different as well, but there's still a clearly observable difference.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is 8man still your dark knight, /a/?  <br>Reporting for duty. Marriage inbound.</br>  <br>But that doesn't involve roundabout conversations. Also, no bitchy mother in laws or Kimchi throwing</br>    <br>It's not Yui because she likes Tobe.</br>  <br>Yui end confirmed.</br>  After watching EP 13 I get the impression Yui isn't actually in love with 8man.  What volume is the anime at?     If only the girls had a reliable man like Shirou Emiya.  <br>No, what happened at the aquarium is very different from what happened during Genuine and before that.<br><br>Yui was working from two directions at once- the part of her that was afraid of losing her friends actually wanted them to accept her proposal so they could just go into superficial friendship stasis and wouldn't have to be hurt<br><br>Another part of her knew they (or at least 8man) would never accept it, because that part of her knew as well that her proposal was wrong. She put it out there knowing that, but hoping that somehow 8man could come up with something that could let her finally reject it and get her moving towards a new answer.</br></br></br></br></br>      So we'll be getting OVAs next?  <br>Anon, no matter what you say, Yuifags and Yukinofags will always dismiss Iroha as nonexistent.<br><br>Irohabros are just sitting back furiously masturbating to those spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably with the VN or sometime after the BDs release.</br>  <br>SENSEI WINS</br>  <br>We've already established that the anime director is a biased Yukinofag.<br><br>He basically removed every 8man monologue/scene/reactions that suggest he MAY has feeling for Yui.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the name of this?</br>  <br><br><br>Because 8man won't genuine any one girl by the time he graduates, he'll end up marrying sensei and feeling feels.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, that makes Sensei the most realistic choice to 8man.<br><br><br>Ahoy!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino isn't in love with 8man (read her memorandum) <br>Really? Wouldn't more people be talking about it if it was true?</br></br>  <br><br>It was effectively the same thing. There are arguments about Yui's motivations in that ending scene and whether she really wanted her proposal to be accepted or not, but regardless what she did was bring the two loners together yet again.<br><br>I'd like to think that she wanted her proposal to be accepted and this was actually an aggressive move on her part to "take a step" and finally get what she's wanted all this time. But it's hard to reconcile with a few other details of that 'date'.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  I think he's a good Onii-chan.<br>I wouldn't mind being his imouto. I've even let people know we were related.</br>  Can someone describe all the main characters motivations in a single sentence or    <br><br>Obviously Yui likes Hikki and Yukino likes the elusive cookie man. But the cookie man only has eyes for Yui.<br><br>So it's not a love triangle, it's a love quadrilateral.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay so I'm actually pretty retarded and I always forget the name of this every fucking time before I actually watch it. Totsuka should win Hikky's heart btw.</br>  <br>They all want to have sex with their mom.<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that they're all ignoring your post proves this anon right. <br><br>Somebody else said that these threads are accurate depictions of what's going on in the novel, Yui and Yukino are too busy having at each other and causing drama while Iroha is getting flag after flag after flag under their radar.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't want to accept it.</br>  <br>But cookieman is 8man.<br>So 8man loves Yui.<br><br>YUI END CONFIRMED</br></br></br></br>    <br>I didn't understand any of their plotting at the end of 13... can you elaborate?</br>  Does Hachiman actually have feelings for Yui? People keep spouting that Vol 11 suggests this. <br><br>People posted spoiles and kanji that supposedly were flags but all I saw were instances of him showing a code of honor. <br><br>Please post snippets that show he has feelings for Yui</br></br></br></br>  <br>this picture reminds me how good S1 was compared to all the angsty drama that s2 was, also that band scene was pretty cool</br>  <br><br>Nah cookie man is on sesame street. 8man is reaching and misinterpreting Yui in thinking it's him.</br></br>  <br>le influential powerful traditional nihongo family trope</br>  <br><br><br>From the LN, it's already been posted. However, it is clearest that 8man has feelings for Sensei -- he unabashedly explains this because he is most comfortable with dynamic personalities.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone will post the long wall of text shortly I'm sure. I dunno if it's actually right though. People tend to think long wall of text must be true.</br></br>  <br>8man jelly scene in volume 6,5 is the biggest indicator of it.</br>   There’s something I want. <br> No matter how much I rack my head over it, I could arrive at only one, permissible answer. But mysteriously enough, it’s accompanied by an echo of ambiguity. <br> That’s why, I actually don’t have a tangible understanding of what it really is. <br> However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. <br><br>What does she want if it the thing that it isn't are companionship, friendship, or love?</br></br></br></br></br>  This season needed more Shizuka.  <br>Yukino's issues and her love for 8man are connected, no matter how much you seem to want to believe they aren't. The thing you're completely missing is that their connection doesn't necessarily mean she will fall out of love with him.<br><br>Only you and maybe a few of my more single-minded Yuifag brethren think it's a death flag for Yukino end.<br><br>At the very most, it's good business sense (because I won't go so far to call it good writing) on Watari's part- a means to keep the whole harem more "in play" by giving the main girl a potential out condition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Something something sophistry something rationalizing an abstract concept something monster of logic something</br></br>  <br>Alas, S2 was great because 8man is bound to graduate girl-less and he'll end up marrying Sensei for maximum overgenuine.<br><br>The line is already set up: "Shizuka, you said looking back on things can be more disappointing than you expect, but that time we spent together is going to be something we'll both smile back on."<br><br><br>Alas, indeed.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This should be obvious by now.</br>  sex with rumi  <br>That picture never fails to make me sad.</br>  <br> mfw sensei end </br>    <br>An identity.</br>  <br><br><br>misclick, anon?</br></br></br>  Why are you still here?

As it stands though, circumstances prevent any kind of action from him with regards to her.  And he seems to have developed some feelings for Yukino along the way.

Some of them are delusional, yes, but I can't see anyone being that  genuinely  obvious to the scene and still having the language skills to post in a Vietnamese pottery carving amphitheater.</br>  <br><br>Sensei wins the 8bowl -- SEASON 2 END CONFIRMS -- Sensei wins the 8bowl after the IROHASU fails to deliver; YUIGAHAMA MAMA confirmed next-best route</br></br>  <br>Did he actually mention why he felt that way (relationship) or is this merely guesswork</br>  <br> Watari will basically always set up scenes to have double meanings. <br>Iroha's entire character is like that, every single thing she does seems to both be "for Hayama" and "For 8man" at the same time, as well as random other objectives such as StuCo duties and self-indulgence. When you think about it, she's actually shockingly efficient.</br></br>    <br><br>If sensei route unlocks, what would /a/ prefer?<br><br> Tsundere sensei ?<br><br> Smugdere sensei ?<br><br> deredere sensei ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's a breath of fresh air to see senseifags return. They were far more prominent before season 2 started airing.  <br>There is he said in his monologue.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why not all? She is one of the only dynamic characters anyway (aside from 8man, that is), so why bring her down to the others' level?</br></br></br></br>      <br>Cool thanks. <br><br>Honestly, with the way he reacts with Yui/Yukino, he should just have a 3way with them. Forget the penguins.</br></br></br>  <br>After seeing this for some reason i get a feeling why 8man keep looking Hayama group talk in class for knowing what actually Yui do within group(Keeping eye on her).</br>  <br>Anything from S1 returning is a breath of fresh air from all the Yukinoshit drama, honestly.</br>  <br><br><br>Sensei is best option</br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing as a secondary that Haruno got the full dose of Yukinomom's shit early on and really doesn't want her imouto becoming Yukinomom jr. and is doing her best to steer Yukino off that path. The problem is that Haruno is fairly warped herself and can't really do shit without being heavy handed about it, causing Yukinon to flinch away from anything Haruno says. <br><br>Yukinon is well aware of how manipulative her mother is, but is not as aware of how she is manifesting the same traits herself. She went on an imitation spree with Haruno as her way of thumbing at her mother, but outside of that doesn't know how to operate outside of that. Or something like that.<br><br>Can Freud-anon psychoanalyze this family please?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>pic related</br></br></br>  <br>Is it obvious that there is still a love triangle? It was kinda vague.</br>  <br>So now what? wait for OVA? And what about Volumen 11?</br>  <br><br>And with that, I leave for the day. STAY STRONG, SENSEIFAGS.</br></br>  <br>GARdere sensei. Which I guess would be sort of what we've seen so far- sometimes sweet, sometimes offering hot-blooded advice and/or violence for encouragement.</br>    <br>Well when he looks at Yui and the Hayama group there's always another motivation for Hachiman to do so<br><br>Forgot the volume, but in stuco election, he looked at her because he was comparing the Hayama group to the situation they were in<br><br>10 had him looking at the group to figure out how to get closer to Hayama. Also he looked at the group when Ooka spurted that Yukino was dating Hayama <br><br>11 had him looking at her because of their conversation about homemade treats (and he made connection between Yui's cookies and him)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So who else didn't see the love triangle coming?</br>  <br><br>Wait, it's dangerous;  take her with you, for SCIENCE reasons of course. </br></br>  <br><br>That's not best girl though</br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't surprise me, <br>in volume 10.5 he also dissuaded Yui to join the college social club out of the exact same reason.</br></br></br>    <br> We'll be honest about our feelings no matter how scary it might be <br> no more love triangle. </br></br>  <br>It could be that Haruno really cares for Yukino, but at the same time seeing OP's screencap it seems like she's bitter she had to get all her life arranged by her family while Yukino made all her choices herself, even if she ended up following her sister quite closely. I don't know anymore.</br>  <br>Have they say something about any OVAs guys?</br>    <br>Wait where in 10.5 was that? I don't remember anything like that come up but I am thirsty as hell for some more 8man being possessive of Yui.</br>  Do you think Yuimom knows Yui is in love with Hikki-kun? What do you think Yui says about Hikki? Maybe she talks about how he is gross.  <br> 8man being possessive of Yui. <br>How does Yui think about all this?</br></br>  <br>Interesting.<br><br>So Haruno is forced to live a life she doesn't want and begrudges Yukino for having freedom but not utilizing it.<br><br> Maybe Yukino's request is to help Haruno and Hayama escape the influence of their families. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably is frustrated that her sister having all that liberty is doing the same things as her, and in a mix of trying to help but also some resentment is what make her act so bitchy.</br>  If 8man wins the club contest at the end, I hope his wish is for him to be with sensei.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  Is vol 11 out?  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br> “That’s your reason!? I got happy for nothing…” Yuigahama dropped her shoulders and looked away. No, no, it’s not like I said you weren’t cute or anything, yes. I was just saying that if it’s you, you could easily fit in with these enthusiastic, go-go university students, yes. It’s just, you know, I don’t think it’s a good thing if you let those people drag you into their pace! </br>  <br>She would call him gross but blush furiously and be really happy about it. She might act more dere to him for it.</br>  <br>If there is still a love triangle how well will it play out if they are honest about them?</br>  Anyone thiknk Hachiman looks stupid the way ponkan drew him in Vol 11. His face and hair is derpier than usual.<br><br>Anime 8man &gt;LN</br></br>  <br>Getting mad at the only one taking initiative in the entire season.</br>  <br>Gamama definitely knows Yui is in love with Hikki-kun. Yui probably only talks about stuff they've done in club and brings him up that way rather than him being the direct topic of conversation, but that's enough for a mom to know.<br><br><br>Pretty sure he didn't give anything away about how he was feeling in 6.5, and from  (thanks by the way, I remember that bit now) it looks like she was hoping he was jealous but he managed to play it off. Don't know exactly how the scene in interlude A will play out but I'm excited for it now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fairly well from the look of things. Someone's feelings are going to get hurt, but they all care enough about each other that it's not going to create any sort of permanent rift between them.</br>  <br>To be fair, I'd be pretty bitchy too if I had a sibling as autistic as Yukino who was always trying to one-up my past accomplishments.</br>  <br> Yui probably only talks about stuff they've done in club and brings him up that way rather than him being the direct topic of conversation, but that's enough for a mom to know. <br>How would she figure? By Yui's body language or the fact that he is the only boy she brings up. I am sure Yui has made some sort of comment about him.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Gahamama know that he is the boy who saved their dog?</br>  <br><br>What is this.<br><br>I need to feed my sensei fetish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's that demon king harem show that aired in Winter. Don't remember the name. <br><br>He fucks her by the way.</br></br></br>  Which is more feasible? An OVA, a movie, or another season?  <br><br>Why was I born too early?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JlC<wbr>k6Z2HZxY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>OVA not enough content for a new season, unless he somehow pumps out 4 volumes within 2 years and they somehow drag out the episodes.</br>  <br> He fucks her by the way. <br>BOTH CANONICALLY VIRGINS TO THIS DAY</br></br>  <br>They had to resort to being vague because they were running out of source material</br>  <br>As much as I'd like a season 3, this would be more practical. I would like to see a movie though, because they could spoil us with glorious animation and 4k suffering.</br>  <br>Shinmai something something?</br>  It's just simply shit anime  girls probability of winning the 8bowl as of vol 11<br><br>yukino: 50%<br>yui: 45%<br>iroha: 3%<br>harem/friendship end: 1.9%<br>any other: 0.1%</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OVA. not enough material for another season unless it stretches out to volume 14 or volume 15, by which point it would be too much of a good thing.</br>  <br>Yeah, that one. <br><br>Pretty sure I fapped to the official manga adaptation chapter that has them fucking. Maybe it wasn't full on benis in vagina, I don't remember, but there was definitely paizuri.</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>ALL IN ON SAKI</br>  Vol 1:<br> As I watched her, a strange feeling suddenly overcame me. <br> She and I are certainly alike in some way. I found myself thinking that in spite of myself. <br> The silence in that moment somehow felt nice. <br> I felt my heart beat a little faster. It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond.  <br><br><br>Vol 6:<br> Maybe that’s why. Maybe that’s why, whenever we exchange words like this, it always feels refreshing and pleasant. <br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. <br> So maybe. <br> So maybe she and I. <br><br>Will he ask her the same question again in Vol12?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Tsukihime remake news in Type-Moon Ace in a few days  <br>Your arguments are getting dumber<br><br>It's easier to see yourself as a slacker high school student that does his own thing than it is to see yourself as "Paragon of virtue Mr.Hero". No not all VN MCs are self insert, no Shirou isn't more of a self insert than Shiki, no Superman isn't a self insert. Just in general a lot of what you said was pretty off.<br><br>Comic book writers originally created boy side kicks like Robin so kids would have a self insert to imagine would go on adventures with batman. You're more inclined to see yourself as someone normal, rather than someone amazing who can fly and shoot lasers. Even if that someone normal, a lazy guy that doesn't live up to his potential that embodies us all, really is a self gratifying mirror at the end of the day rather than being exact. The point is to get it within a ballpark, rather than "Greatest hero ever, Mr.morals and heroism".<br><br>Most stories tend to have that normal guy that's meant to embody the readers perspective, who reacts to the crazy things that happen around to give the reader an indication what their reaction should be among other things as well. That might be considered a type of insert as well.<br><br>Like Manta in Shaman King, or Shinpachi in Gintama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty wrong<br><br>Most people don't really have real dreams or ambition in that sense, and are actually pretty listless or lost underneath it. They aren't super motivated, and often wind up in small time jobs since they didn't know what they were doing in life, while they were enjoying it per moment.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't seem to understand. People identify with delinquents because it's something a lot of people wished they could do, but don't actually want to do. I mean you must be stunted or something if you can't understand that someone doesn't have to be exactly like you to be a self-insert. Hell, they could be a murdering sociopath and still be a self-insert as long as it appeals to some intrinsic sense that most people have.<br><br>A self-insert is someone with generalized traits and a non-fully realized character as a way for people to project themselves onto a character even if said character differs from your own sense of self. Shirou differs a bit because while he is a self-insert that's both his character and intention, while the story is meant to challenge both your self-insertion and Shirou. It may or may not succeed depending on your opinion but that's a big difference between the two characters.</br></br></br>  <br> Most people have ambition, have dreams, have something to aim for. You identify with that far more easily than lol don't care. <br>You are wrong.</br></br>  <br> that second spoiler <br>All is forgiven  if it means Nanaya gets more screentime in the Kouma route </br></br>  Who is this?  he's a big guy  Butch Deadlift  taguro  Frieza but with Perfect Cell's personality  Dave Johnson  Really Really Big Man  Big McLargehuge  Duke Nukem  Tranc Breaker  Dirk Hardpeck  Gristle McThornbody  Crunch Buttsteak  Ichigo Uzumaki  Smoke Manmuscle  <br>terminator</br>  Madara Uchiha  GOAT shonen villain  Punch Side-Iron  Sarude Dandystorm  Mark Rippletits  Isang-daang porsyento  Trianglehead  The Big Guy Who Cant Leap through Time.

He shot an arrow between the eyes of Gilgamesh and sent him alone into the darkness. The arrow shot at that time was a regular arrow, and from the fact that Emiya gradually began to disappear after this attack, this is probably the limit of Emiya’s materialisation. <br><br>Dunno why people think he was a CG there, a CG can only act after everyone has been killed basically. He just survived due to IA, and he was at the absolute limit of his mana at the end which is why he looked so fucked.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All Around Type Moon</br></br>  <br>Oh, yes, thanks.</br>  <br>Wait, what the fuck is this? I thought the animu was finished.</br>  <br>filename.</br>  <br>Is that Luvia victory a one time occurrence or is she consistently demonstrated to be Rin's superior in combat through a large series of wins?</br>  <br> or is she consistently demonstrated to be Rin's superior in combat through a large series of wins? <br><br>They"re noted to be about equal in everything, and are both hyper comeptitive assholes who can't help but compete since there can't be two Suns in the sky.<br><br>Whatever Rin has, Luvia has some equivalent towards it by chance.

It was the whole point of Archer letting Shirou win.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why is Rin getting petted so cute?</br></br>  I think I'm gonna remember the live thread for this episode for a long-ass time. That collective mind up everyone went through when they realized the epilogue /started/ in London was amazing.  <br>mind fuck*</br>  <br>I was at work watching it from my phone and I literally blown the fuck out.<br><br>I couldn't believe we were actually getting that.</br></br></br>  Okay, so I can kind of understand it in Prisma or HA setting, but in this epilogue, where does Luvia get off hitting on someone else's boyfriend? She obviously knows they're shacking up yet flirts brazenly. Who does that?  <br>When did Rin become Karin from Monogatari?</br>  <br>A trollop, that's who.</br>  <br>Whores</br>  <br>There's an interview where Nasu says that Shirou's chances in all routes is infinitely close to zero. Anything else was just fanwank.</br>  <br> Who does that? <br>THE MOTHERFUCKING EDELFETS.</br></br>  <br>The Throne being outside of time doesn't actually mean changes to the hero would be done immediately. This is hinted at by the fact Archer isn't aware of every single one of his summons despite the information already existing there.</br>  <br>She's a slut</br>  <br>finns</br>  <br>I was in the thread on some Japanese forum, wasn't even watching the episode, refreshed the page, and Luvia was there with a bunch of freaking out. Blew my mind that we were actually getting London right there and then. Shame HF can't do something to top that scene for an epilogue.</br>  <br>It does confirm that he won't ever remember his summonings, as the answer is already written.<br><br>All of his summonings have happened, he compares it to a library full of books he has the choice of reading or not. The result is that even if the answer is there, he will not read it, since 99.999 percent of all books in the library are just him being summoned and killing everything which he gets tired of reading.<br><br>Its Archived Time, not Observed Time, time cannot move forward in a 1, 2, 3 type manner since all things are on the same scale. It's like a book, the end and beginning are on the same scale in terms of time per the reader.<br><br>If the Throne has not already replaced Archer, then it never did, since the end and beginning are on the same scale. Time cannot move forward or backwards, its the same from the start, everything has already been reached.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder to everyone that Archer FALSE FLAGGED Nero and was the actual person responsible for burning down Rome.<br><br>Nero's fantasies were becoming too dangerous and overwriting reality that Archer was sent to burn down Rome and have the blame put on Nero.</br></br></br>  <br> Rome is burning before Acha appears <br>You can't trick me, Whore of Babylon.</br></br>  <br>Aniplex fucked up with the subs but Shirou works part time as Luvia's maid.<br><br>Also, Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino riverboat owned by a DAA.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer?</br>  <br> Only summoned to prevent apocalypse-level events <br> Kills a bunch of ragheads with AKs <br><br>What</br></br></br></br>  <br>How could Archer do such a thing. Why must Alaya stomp on best girl.<br><br><br>Obviously it was a multi guardian conspiracy</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Archer isn't teleporting to various places around Rome to commit arson. </br>  <br>Maybe they were setting off a nuclear bomb somewhere that would start World War 11</br>  <br>finnish girls are disgusting...i got stuck in helsinki for 2 days and nearly every woman i saw was either fat or ugly, but usually both<br><br>it's no wonder why the men are constantly drunk, they have to fuck those beasts</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that Mooncell copies of Heroic Spirits are exactly the same as the ones in the Throne right? Yet Archer in Extra is aware of the events that occur in F/SN despite his "younger" self being hopelessly unaware. Only confirmed difference is that Mooncell Archer is not bound to the Counterforce which is why he's less of a jackass.</br>  <br>cuckold brittistani?</br>  <br>Neither of those things make it okay to hit on someone else's boyfriend, much less in front of them. I'll have to agree that it's because of  slut </br>  <br>Mooncell updates heroic spirits info based on shit that's happened on Earth.<br><br>The fifth war happened on Earth, it was recorded, info was updated on Archer. You're arguing that all servants retain information based on previous summonings, which is wrong.<br><br>Cu also remembered Archer from the fifth war in Extra, he's not a guardian.</br></br></br></br></br>  Luvia's anus is probably blander than Rin's.  <br>what would yous search for in the archive for the live threads in the subject line or post?</br>  <br>Luvia probably bleaches her anus. Rin probably has hair on hers.</br>  <br>Nope. <br> Yes, that's right. To be more precise, they are perfectly reproduced from the Moon Cell's records of human history. However, that human history is connected to the throne of heroes in multiple ways, so they can't be called copies as a rule. In short, the Moon Cell consciously creates its own history of humanity, but that history is the exact same as the throne of heroes, so it's like they overlap in multiple ways as the same existences. <br>Mooncell copies = Throne copies.</br></br></br>  http://www.fate-sn.com/bdbox/<br><br>Drama CD for the BDs is gonna be about the Clock Tower.<br><br>Also it seems like they're setting things straight somewhat with the amount of extra animation. They're pinning it at a little over 10 minutes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look for the thread with 900+ posts.</br>  <br>Just so you know Archer always talks about himself in 3rd person before he became guardian.</br>  <br>My hair is naturally curly to the point it forms drills, its possible anon, if your genes allow it.</br>  <br> bleached anus <br> spending obscene amounts of money to look like a whore  <br>Sasuga Luvia.</br></br></br>  <br> Supposed to be summoned as part of the CG to stop humanity ending catastrophes <br> Always summoned to kill random sand niggers, small-time militias, and children who couldn't possibly do anything big <br><br>Bravo ufotable, Bravo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's just Aniplex fucking up. They made the same mistake in episode 20 and UTW had to fix it.</br>  <br>you never know man, butterfly effect and so</br>  <br> Rin probably has hair on hers <br>That's a good thing. The hair traps the feces, dirtying her anus to the point where you can taste Shirou's cooking in it.</br></br>  <br>I just find it hard to believe, is all. Was hoping he'd deal with more interesting disasters like the manga portrayed (participating in wars and large scale conflicts) instead of killing sand niggers for a living.</br>  <br>never read the manga, who does he kill in that, mecha hitler?</br>  <br/>  Why is Rin so jealous Luvia? She has tons of things that Luvia doesnt have like her uh ZR yeah that works that's something Luvia definitely doesnt have.  Hopefully, this episode will inspire someone to finally write the Rin/Luvia hatesex doujin everyone wants.  <br>No idea. But we see some flashbacks of him in the middle of a warzone screaming like a madman with dead bodies all around him.</br>  <br>I dont know what are you talking about. Archer clearly says shounen wa shounen ga.<br>Translation is correct. He talks about ubw Emiya and himself when he was alive at the same time. And he got his answer.</br></br>  <br>Luvia is rich as fuck, has a body that makes Rin realize she was always just a big fish in a small pond who was less than she realized, has as much ability as Rin but even more going on outside of that.<br><br>She's someone that makes even school idol Rin feel a little self conscious.<br><br>Although you might say the same about Saber.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luvia has money. Rin doesn't.</br>  <br>And she has a route</br>  I just cant believe we got a satisfactory pretty good end with some fan service.  Luvia is Blue<br>a Red's natural rival</br>  <br>do you have big tits and childbearing hips too?</br>  <br> And she gets plowed by dirty ginger and is impure, while Luvia is always pure and prime <br><br>Wow, real accomplishment</br></br></br>  <br>She's not jealous? She's just annoyed Luvia keeps trying to make moves on her sentient sword.</br>  <br>The Counter Force acts through subtle means usually by empowering and leading a living person to neutralize the thread. Counter Guardians are only send when the situation is already beyond fucked and they will literally kill anything in the vicinity.<br><br>Maybe they send more than one guardian and Archer just got stuck with cleaning out the place?</br></br></br>  <br>Even in the routes where Luvia never meets Shirou, Rin still gets jealous and goes after her just the same.<br><br>Saying Shirou is the core of this problem is stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Luvia constantly lusts after the Shero dick, but she'll never get it, not even in Prisma.</br>  <br>There's probably more than one CG, yeah.<br><br>Still kind of weird how all we saw were Archer dealing with small-fry. I'd be pretty bored even if I was looking forward to all the killing.</br></br></br>  <br>Luvia's not even good enough for the ginger, she tries to get his attention but can't even do that</br>  Ara  <br>It's a multiverse.<br><br>There's guaranteed to be an infinite number of possibilities where Luvia wins  or NTRs Rin .</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about that particular scene with Rin clearly trying to get Luvia the fuck off Shirou.</br>  <br>She'll always be pure and noble, while Rin is gaping and dirty anus. An unreachable but always pure Aristocrat, while Rin is a gorilla that can be talked into sex in less than two weeks.<br><br>As said before, Luvia never meets Shirou in Fate or HF, so its definitely not constantly anything. <br><br> He denied "putting others before himself", however that was obviously self-deception. His goal was to be a house-husband. <br> However, his butler-spirit had already awakened. After the True End of Rin route, he was working part-time at the mansion of Rin's rival. What the heck is this? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Saber is also blue.<br><br>The natural conclusion is for blue three-way to occur as red is left out in the cold.</br></br></br></br>  Did Shirou ever realise avalon is inside him?  <br>Infinite universes don't mean everything can happen<br><br>Kotomine will never survive past the 5th war<br>Luvia will never win shirou</br></br></br></br>  <br>Going off that mindset there's also an infinite number of possibilities where Rin has Luvia watch her in the middle of baby-making, or more importantly,  they turn full-on bi and have the Clocktower's wildest threesome .</br>  <br>In Fate he does</br>  <br>Luvia saw Shirou try to jump just like Rin and Sakura. and we all know bitches love the jump</br>  <br>Rin shouldn't talk with cock in her mouth</br>  <br>He might have, but it doesn't really matter in UBW or HF.</br>  <br>People seem to not get despite it being said by Nasu a few times, at their core Sakura and Rin are almost entirely the same. Main difference is one is unlucky and the other is lucky.<br><br> Basically, she is a worrisome girl that never resents others (not even Shinji or Zouken), and always blames herself for everything. <br> The solitary exception to this rule is Rin, because the two of them are so similar. I guess she's only capable of being honest with herself, or someone almost exactly like herself, yeah. <br> As everybody knows, she seems passive, but when she does do something she devotes herself to it completely. <br><br>Rin and Sakura are entirely in sync when they try to kick Bazett out of the house in Ataraxia when they perceive her as a threat.<br><br>They're both the jealous type underneath it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, I only have my drills.</br>  <br> Infinite universes don't mean everything can happen <br>Is that you, Ken Levine?</br></br>  <br>wot</br>  <br>Wrong, Aniplex fucked up the script once again. Actually, you can find more mistakes in the script of ep25.</br>  <br>Where do you come from anon?</br>  <br>The head guy of Bioshock Infinite.
