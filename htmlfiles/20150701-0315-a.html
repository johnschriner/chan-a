I'll go to the 24hrs store for him, he can pay me back later. Who wants ginger ale?  I completely forgot he said that.  Double thread plz. 68 wasn't looking very exciting, so I hope we get some happenings with 69.   Possible double translation tonight <br> Have to wake up early for class tomorrow <br><br>It's all worth it  for the soft </br></br></br>  Muh D is ready   Double feature <br> Internet's down <br>I didn't want to use my phone's data but deserate times</br></br>  Post soft to lure Aereus.  <br>Come back in about 2 hours. Save your data for now.<br><br><br>Pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>if you insist</br>    She's too perfect.      Let's play a game friends. Everyone guess the chapter when the first fully consensual kiss happens between Mizuki and Takeru. This means no booze, no drugs, or nothing. I'll start. <br><br>78.</br></br>  <br>Does the forest not count?</br>  <br>Chapter 19 ish? That was not consensual.</br>  <br>chapter 69</br>  I was thinking about this today for some reason:<br><br>What if this ends with Mizuki being turned back into a boy and Takeru, being the bro he is, saying he doesn't care and he loves her anyway.<br><br>And then  Mizuki turns him down, because hormones aren't making her want the D anymore. </br></br></br></br>  I'm the cashier at the 24 hour convinience store. Aereus has been in the bathroom for the past 2 hours now. I think he's going to stay there for the whole night again.  So has he translated any chapters since the 19th?  <br>Then Takeru will make a sissy out of him. Simple.</br>      <br><br>Takeru goes full thailand on him.</br></br>  I want to put my penis in MIzuki's vagina.    LETS SUMMON AEREUS<br><br>OH DEAR AEREUS<br>YOU WHO ARE THE BIGGEST FAGGOT<br>BRING YOUR RAPED ASS HERE</br></br></br></br>          Should I post more of dis?  <br>I wish someone would fix that right breast. It looks very unnatural and ruins that  deliciousness </br>  <br>2soft2luxurious</br>  i guess its the 24 hr store after all        so i picked this thing thanks last week and while marathoning it i saw divine inspiration and conceived this gem for you guys.   She wants the D         <br>I wish i was the Boku Girl</br>   no post on the site <br> no sign of aereus <br>I'm worried.</br></br>  <br>I have only read up to chapter 5. How lewd does this get?</br>  Seems like Aereus broke his promise with us.  <br> Not even spoilering it <br><br>Remove this.</br></br></br>  <br>Whoever colored this needs to do it again, I can see the different color brush on her mouth area</br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>Maximum Over Vanilla</br>    <br> not posting the english </br>      I love dis one <br><br>Also how do I delete certain image? </br></br>    <br>Ch. 17</br>  <br>ALL HOPE IS LOST<br>aereus went to the 48hour store instead of the 24</br></br>  <br>READ IT FAGGOT</br>  <br>Well there is nothing on bokunomanga and we haven't see him for a while so...</br>  <br>more like the 336 hour store at this point</br>  <br>Seems like is another monday without Boku Girl, Aereus is getting a load on his ass.</br>  <br>Is one of these 2 options:<br><br>1) Aereus is at the 49000 hours store sucking dicks<br>2) He was kidnaped by some gay Ovni and now he's getting an anal examination with a probe.</br></br></br></br>  It's midnight and no post on the site. I'm beginning to lose hope.  Shame. LiveTL mondays are always a lot of fun. I usually look forward to them.  Consider the following:<br><br>Aereus had some personal matter to attend to which was more important than a live TL so he's off doing that.</br></br>  <br> more important than a live TL <br>I don't understand.</br></br>  <br>WHAT'S MORE PERSONAL THAN TRANSLATING A CHINESE COMIC ON A CAMBODIAN CARTOON IMAGE BOARD FOR A BUNCH OF NEETS?</br>  This has been like the third week in a row. What's up with him?  <br>So, do they ever fuck? or do ecchi stuff? <br><br>I'm not chapter 20 or 30 can't remember and they never do ultra lewd things, it's just MC acting cute and stuff like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep reading.</br>  <br>you will probably catch up to where we are before the LiveTL happens</br>  <br><br>Chronic 24-hour store syndrome.<br><br>It's  terminal. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I will hunt you down if I don't see MC sucking cock when I reach current chapter.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  Aereus quit doing LT now working at the 24 hour store.  <br>I think it's a mixture of bad timing/people taking his Live TLs. There are many weeks where he hasn't met the Monday livetl, only to do it Tuesday, Thursday or Saturday. Also, since that dude ripped his livetls and shittily scanned them, he probably is a bit anxious that he is enabling a dude to fuck up the series he likes.<br><br>Either way, we just gotta wait and see if he wants to do them again. I doubt anyone else is going to step up to bokunomanga's quality in the foreseeable future, so for now we are SOL.</br></br></br>  <br>This is why I can never have nice things.</br>  <br>It's a shame really. If Aereus doesn't do it this week, my guess is that he won't do it until bokunomanga has passed the dude ripping their translations (which could easily be months from now, given that it takes about 2 weeks for them to complete a chapter, times 19 chapters). I just checked, and the ripping dude just posted 2 chapters last week, so he's going to take at least till the end of the summer until he finished all the livetl translations.<br><br>Anyway it happens, someone gets fucked. I just hope it's not /a/ this time.</br></br></br>  <br>Do we know if he's tried reaching out to the person or people responsible?</br>  <br>He's called him out publicly on a few occasions. Never seen the guy respond.</br>  <br>That must be frustrating.</br>  So, I should get the newest chapters of Borderless in a few days. This time it'll finally be new stuff beyond what was released initially on manga box.<br>There was also a nice little one shot story in this month's dragon ace that had best/yuri end</br>  <br>I don't know why nobody else has acknowledged this yet, but thank you, anon. You are good people and you have good taste.</br>  <br>What's stopping someone else taking over the LiveTLs? I'm sure there's someone here who knows Japanese and would like the attention it would bring.</br>  Lazy manager is lazy and copypasted last week's vacation schedule of mine to this week, so I had to work tonight 5-close again. I have off Wed-Fri this week because of that, so 68 will be Wed night and 69 will be Thurs night.  <br>TBH, you can say that about a lot of series. I'd freaking love if Birdy:Decode had been fully translated by now, but even after two seasons nobody has finished that damn manga (or put up translations/raws as with Boku Girl). It takes a lot for anyone to do something as consistently and as organized as Aereus has, and I bet most people just don't care enough.</br>  <br>Thanks for the heads up Aereus.</br>  <br>Try the original Patlabor manga. 27 fucking years and nothing. You'd think that /m/ would've done something about this eventually.</br>  <br>Sweet. doomsayers (including myself) be damned!</br>  <br>Damn, that's rough. I'd think that would even be translated officially, didn't the movies win awards?<br><br>(Although, we are both pinning our desires on other peoples work, inc. Boku Girl). I should just hurry up and learn japanese already.</br></br></br>  <br>There was an official English release that lasted about a volume, and a later fan attempt from a couple of years ago that lasted a little longer. Patlabor was the absolute shit 15 years ago and is still pretty much the best thing ever.<br>Far as I can tell, the main issue is how the TV series and OVAs were handled for their English-language releases. They ended up with Central Park Media, who were pants on head retarded. It's super popular in a bunch of other markets and you can get it in virtually every language that isn't English.</br></br>  <br>You know, I think it would be interesting if  Crunchyroll  pulled a Netflix on old manga. I'm sure they could get a lot of good IP for the cheap, and wouldn't have to worry about the eventual quality (since it would already be reviewed/finished). I love the current system, but it would be great if various never-to-be-translated works got translated.</br>  So when Takeru's about to put it inside Mizuki's pussy will he say:<br><br> I-im a boy... so you should put it in my b-b in my butt!!!  <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you Aereus. We love you.</br>  <br>I hope not.</br>  <br>That would be quite interesting, as well as giving the site some actual value.</br>    <br>Go back to reddit, newshit</br>  <br>She just needs to articulate it at this point.</br>  Can I get an archive of the live TLs or anything of the sort?  <br>For science!</br>  <br>is this an h-manga or something?</br>  How long till night time/regular Boku Girl thread time in America? It's already night time where I am.  <br><br>You can use this for when Aereus sets a time on bokunomanga (Usually 9 pm CDT)<br><br>http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclo<wbr>ck/converter.html</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is going on? I'm up to the 50th chapter and I understood nothing about this live translations thing</br>  <br>It's the perfect combination of lewd, heartwarming, 10/10 softness and top notch writing.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure there are laws against what this is doing to my dick.</br>  <br>200, bitch. I know how the world works.</br>  Here is the post for the Ch 68 LiveTL then etc:<br><br>http://seizonscans.actionprinny.com<wbr>/?p=15</wbr></br></br>  <br>Is this your site/blog?</br>  <br>I'm sure people will know what you mean anyway but you put June instead of July.</br>  <br>Long live seizonscans!</br>  <br><br>Are you not using the bokunomanga site anymore? Has there been more drama?</br></br>  <br>Just posting there for now. I assume BnM releases will come like normal.</br>  <br>Yes no maybe? No idea.</br>  Does /a/ like loli?  No,/a/ hates loli.  That's not even a real ice cream flavor.  We pretend.    <br>who is this semen yokai?</br>  Shota is better  <br>/a/ is full of normies, why?</br>  <br>This guy knows what's up</br>  What type of facial expression is this /a/?  <br> wait your turn, boys, everyone will get some~ </br>  any facial expression in anime at any time, taken out of context, can be seen as an expression made by the character when they are stressing their desire to protect their friends. this notion is expressed primarily in shonen, but the variety of facial expressions that represent this notion can be assumed by any face in anime  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-06-30/valkyrie-drive-mermaid<wbr>-reveals-more-characters-october-pr<wbr>emiere/.89879<br><br>So is this a guy or a reverse trap?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>I see tits.<br><br>Reverse trap, it is.</br></br></br>  <br>you see what</br>  <br>The entire cast is female. Why would that be a guy?</br>  <br>Genuine womyn.</br>  <br> So is this a guy or a reverse trap? <br>The bio say "he" is the only guy on the island. I find that unlikely as if he actually look like that he must have impregnated all the local lonely women by now. So reverse trap.</br></br>  <br> The entire cast is female. Why would that be a guy? <br>Because they SAY he is a guy... at least to throw us off. They are not fooling anyone.</br></br>  <br>Actually to make it more obvious, they actually gave out "his" three sizes. So the game is up.</br>  <br>the image has "her" 3 sizes.<br>it's a girl</br></br>  Those look like "his" three sizes to me, anon.  Anybody else hyped up for the upcoming anime series? I've been riding this bandwagon since 2012 and this is the best thing ever. <br><br> We MonMusu now </br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZAl<wbr>0lJKJaSg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Show us the birth certificate.</br>  <br>Oh joy, found it two threads ago.<br><br>Now we only need Fish/Snake/Bird and this set will be completed.</br></br></br>  <br>Ms smith can handle it</br>    So a simple summary of this scan.<br><br>[About the keyword of the project - 新生 - rebirth/second birth]<br> They want to reintroduce Tsukihime to player and they thought about what to do. <br> Nasu feels lot like when the worked on Mahoyo. Making graphics better, taking the scenartio to another level, but the base stays the same. <br> They want to make the player think "nostalgic but fresh" about some things they see in the game, move his feelings by some things, suprise him, and to give it all Type-Moon has. <br><br>[About the setting change]<br> The setting now change from a city that resembled "vaguely Tokyo suburbs" to pretty clearly "Tokyo metropolitan area". The scale of the incidents doesn't change, but the new scale of the setting might affect the story in some way, pls look forward to it. <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br> Takeuchi says a big city is more fit for modern vampire stories.  <br> They're talking about how they did location scounting around Tokyo, but won't say which specific places are inspired by. They don't want the players to know what to specifically look forwatd ro yet. <br> The Toono mansion and the school are being remade in details. The mansion will still be Western style and will feel like the best place for murder incidents to happen.  <br> They're talking about the 3D image of the mansion that's on a different page. Takeuchi is making a 3D model of it, which makes drawing easier, but it's also hard, since he needs to create all the details and mind object collisions.  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror etc. and is really happy to be making a hype of game he likes. <br> Talk about how the mansion doesn't really look scary at night, but gets ominous at night, like Resi 1 mansion. <br>(cont.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  (cont.)<br> They're asked if there'll be elements of local folklore/traditions - basically what people talk about between themselves and pass it. Since the scale of the setting has changed, it might be about how Toonos got the mansion and th lands around.  <br><br>[About the character design change]<br> Takeuchi says he created a more modern designs while for example keeping the image of Arcueid as "pure white" vampire.  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already.  <br> Nasu asks if because of the change of setting he gave Arcueif a miniskirt.  <br> Not really, but... [End of the page] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>These almost alleviate some of my fears but I'm not sure on the reasoning behind the setting change.</br></br>  <br>You need the next page? I think it was scanned too.</br>  <br> &gt;Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br><br>This caught my attention.This can be really good as scenes like the hotel can be even more intense.<br><br>Also<br><br> &gt;Also pls get used to the new designs already. <br>Nasu pretty much saying fuck you to people bitching about the miniskirt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Red-Eyed Seibah <br>Cool.</br></br>  <br> Nasu pretty much saying fuck you to people bitching about the miniskirt. <br><br>Takeuchi says that. I should have tagged.</br></br></br>  <br> Also pls get used to the new designs already. <br>Fuck you, Nasu.<br>At least bring back the air intakes.</br></br></br>  <br>You should keep your nip knowledge for yourself and let EOPs rot in hell for being retards.</br>  Going to be interesting how they keep the 90's feel of it.  <br>God fucking dammit Takeuchi</br>    <br>Of course he says it in more Japanese-y way.<br> I was thinking people could maybe have already gotten used to the new designs... </br></br>  <br>where you get this? j</br>  So basically this story is going to take place in 2015?  <br>Nope it will always be the 90's<br><br>Any other time would fuck up the Nasuverse. Same way Mahoyo is set in the 80's.</br></br></br>  <br>Beast's Lair and Mobius Space.<br><br>http://z13.invisionfree.com/Mobius_<wbr>Space/index.php?showtopic=248&amp;st=13<wbr>5</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  Why are you posting old interview?<br><br>This is not from TM10</br></br>  <br>Didn't he say he was going to have it take place around 2005 with Fate? But seeing as they are copying modern day Tokyo then my guess is they upped the date.</br>  <br>Sorry Nasu, the miniskirt is horrible.</br>  <br>That's indeed from TM Ace 10.</br>    <br>Holly shit. Dat Tohno mansion</br>  <br>But it is?</br>  <br>It still has to be the 90's for the events that happen. It may at very end of it though as modern Tokyo was similar to it then.</br>  last thread   <br>Fluffy Shiki?</br>  <br><br>And he doesn't care what people think.<br><br>Nasu is growing up, he used to fold all the time when people got mad about something. Good for him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was just people misunderstanding a complete material line.</br>  OP if you are still around mind translating this?<br><br>Got the HF manga the other day and it came with this guest comments page.</br></br>  This man is your friend.  <br>It's mostly a talk about the designs, sorry.<br><br>But the last part with about how the game developement is proceeding. Basically everyone in Type-Moon is working on FGO, sorry but pls wait a little more. Also Nasu says he would like to return to Tsukihime and also work on something new (新作 - doesn't really have to refer to completely new IP, it's simply the newest thing a company is making, for TM it might be Mahoyo 2 too).</br></br></br>  I'll never get over new designs.  <br>Better quality.</br>  <br>Nice<br><br>Didn't want to bend the fuck out my book to scan it</br></br></br>  <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br><br>Fuck I literally thought that this could be done better while playing the VN. That hotel scene was amazing.</br></br></br>  <br><br> still waiting for my copy <br>Jelly as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Ctrl F <br> Search "Satsuki" <br> 0 results <br>This is the definition of suffering</br></br></br></br>  <br>what if they go higurashi on us?</br>  <br>Why do bitches like Shiki when Arihiko is looking sexy as fuck?</br>  <br>Who are you talking about?</br>  <br>Oh god he is wearing my glasses.</br>  <br> Basically everyone in Type-Moon is working on FGO, sorry but pls wait a little more. </br>  <br><br>Dammit Takeuchi, don't spread your ahoge fetish to Sakura. And keep her curves, you bum.</br></br>  <br>At least she lived in the manga.</br>  <br>She was cut out completely to make room for the teacher route.</br>  <br>He draws her with that small ahoge since years ago from some reason.</br>  <br>nothing wrong with that maybe wormslut improved with that</br>  <br>Sacchin is old and busted. <br>Have you seen the new sensei and Arihiko? I bet they're getting their own routes instead.</br></br>  <br><br> from <br>for</br></br></br>  From BL about Grand Order:<br><br> Alright. One turn is divided into a tactical phase, command phase, and enemy reaction. <br><br> In the command phase, you draw five random cards made up of a random selection of quick, arts, and buster, with the corresponding Servant illustration on them. Picking cards from among these is basically the equivalent of commanding the Servant illustrated on that card to perform the corresponding action.  <br><br> Tactical phase is when you make some preparations, for example, using skills, or Master skills as back up and healing, and Command Spells.  <br><br><br> Now there are five cards per Servant for a total of 15 cards in a deck. And you can basically chain types of attacks together.  <br>But I don't really care about the specifics. <br><br> Now the Ascension thing we saw in the earlier images was basically some form of Servant evolution. If we can some certain items, we'll be able to ascend them to a higher level of existence, and there are apparently four stages of that, with the visuals changing. <br><br> So we have the normal Nero, and then by ascending her we get the Nero with the special arm armor she had on in one of those cards. That's apparently her final evolution also. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was one of the first fucking things I noticed on the HF poster. Now I see it everywhere. It's stil cute though.</br>  <br>Sounds shitty as hell</br>  Any news on Nrvnqsr?<br>I want my Professor Chaos route</br>  <br>Arihiko is a BRUTE</br>  <br> No region lock pls <br> No region lock pls </br></br>  <br>Then there is the multiple classes thing.</br>  <br> gangsta Shirou <br>Damn, I love his new design.</br></br>  <br>Lies. <br>He's a gentleman and a top tier bro. <br>He's hot now too. <br>Perfect husbando material.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's here too</br>  <br>Sounds like pretty standard mobage stuff.</br>  <br> Shirou <br>Nigga Arihiko looks completely different, his swag level is off the charts.</br></br>  <br><br>At least he recognizes she has curves now. Take what you can get.</br></br>  <br>It's a phone game, can't expect much.</br>  <br><br>Someone show this guy that script cover of adult Shirou macking Rin.<br><br>Shirou is swole now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Typical mobile shit. Only gonna be interesting if there's a heavy story emphasis.</br>  <br>I've seen it, Arihiko is better. His face is better and hes a bro.</br>  <br>If Shiki looks so sexy in his "normal" mode, my body won't be ready for Nanaya mode</br>  <br>They already said that the main story has more than one million lines of text.<br><br>And then there is also the individual Servant stories.</br></br></br>    <br>So you command multiple Servants? I love card games but a 15 card deck doesn't seem like the kind I like. Sounds more like a Kingdom Hearts kind of "card" game than an actual card game. I hope it will be fun, but it doesn't sound like there will be active pvp or co-op.</br>  <br>Maybe someone could rip it and make a PC port with no boring gameplay.</br>  <br>We still don't really know how the gameplay is in action.<br><br>And it will be probably more fun than Extra too.</br></br></br>  Who is this?  <br> New Sensei gets a route and Sacchin doesn't  <br>Isn't it sad?</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone make a PC port when you can use Genymotion?</br>  <br>Looks like Archer.</br>  <br>She looks too much like Satsuki. Boring.</br>  <br> 褐色の肌と生気に満ちた瞳、そして深紅の大弓を携えた。伝説にうたわれる<wbr>弓の名手。かつて彼は、戦いのなか で数千人にも及ぶ人民の命を救うという偉業を成し遂げたという。</wbr> </br>  <br> Arihiko <br>He's a homosexual.</br></br>  <br>Where's that Shiki's shack supposed to be?</br>  <br>Because he looks like a retard.</br>  <br> tfw you will never play Mahjong with Shiki and Arihiko </br>  It seems there will be more stuff about the Association in the remake too.  <br> Air intakes <br>It's back to its rightful owner.<br>Your hair alreadylooks nice &amp; fluffy like that, Arc. You also looks more cat-ish now. Back then I don't understand how Shiki-kun can say that you looks like a cat.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's starting to look like Archer two years down the line.</br>  <br> friend <br> implying Arihiko isn't in love with Shiki just like Issei is in love with Shirou </br></br>  <br>I wish that would mean the improvement of the battle quality.</br>  <br> Sacchin <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> secondary <br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tLf9<wbr>oWUe2fc</wbr>  [ ]<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U7n0<wbr>e5XMV-Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>And the partial bangs are back with their rightful owner. All is good.</br>  15 years later and Takeuchi still can't draw man's body properly.  <br>I don't even care about this petty shit, my problem with the new designs is that everyone has the same rounded eyes and face structure now. Say what you will about his old style, but at least them the same face syndrome wasn't this severe. Now they are just a palette and hair swap away from each other. <br><br>Arc and Curry are the worst offenders, coupled with the new hairdo they don't even look like the same character anymore. They revamped the style before for Kagetsu Tohya and the Melty blood games and it looked fine. There was no reason to change their looks this much.</br></br></br>  <br>Here maybe? Somewhere in the forest anyway, it supposed to be hard to find</br>  <br>It's his style.</br>  At this point I think geting rid of Takeuchi would be a good thing.  how's your japanese learning going, anons? if you want to read this when it comes out you better not falter, because 100% serious, this won't be translated for at least 5 years after its release, or it may even follow Mahoyo's path and never be translated at all.  <br>Nasu would never fire her husbando.</br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>I'll start  tomorrow </br>  <br>5 years in, pretty good.</br>  <br> his won't be translated for at least 5 years after its release <br>Don't remind me please.<br>Guess I'll start tomorrow</br></br></br>  <br>Damn you're good. I didn't notice it at first.</br>  <br>I am just going to wait.</br>  <br>He's pretty useless. But Koyama lacks style. Hiroyama progresses much better than Takeuchi, but his faces also lack expressivity and 2uguu4me.</br>  <br>I haven't done my anki reps in a few weeks.</br>  Takeuchi has REGRESSED so hard.<br>His best art was truly back in MBAACC.</br>  <br>Maybe something about the Sea of Astray with Nero?</br>  <br>You mean MBAA.</br>  <br>I-I'm sure it won't take that long! Maybe even an official one since VNs are becoming more popular over here!</br>  <br>so we are really getting a tsukihime remake right?this time for real?</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Let's say that they'll release it this Christmas and everybody already knows that. How many fansub groups are gonna take it?</br>   Basically everyone in Type-Moon is working on FGO <br>STOP!</br>  What is a self producer anyway?  <br>An alias of "top tier girl", obviously.</br>  Hermaphroditic sperm werm.  <br>Every girl. Are you watching OniAi without subs or something?</br>  I'm still mad at that retarded ending.  <br>So we all agree Anastasia is best girl?</br>  <br>That doesn't answer the question though.</br>  <br>Close.<br>Ginbei is best girl.</br></br>  QUALITY thread          bump  Gotta love it  <br>this made me chortle heartily</br>     It's technically an animation error, but instead of it making the overall image worse, it actually makes it better.     <br>Im not seeing it</br>  <br>what am I looking for</br>  <br>All I see is a shitty anime</br>  <br><br> Shion (the purple-haired girl) doesn't wear thigh-highs, but she has them in this one frame. </br></br>  <br>Naruto Adventure Time</br>  <br>ahhh i see</br>  <br>this one killed me<br><br><br>where is this from</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's from Cross Ange. They did that to all tombstones that weren't relevant.</br>      <br>I feel bad for Sakura.</br>  <br>Sfhhhjg CthJkg was a good man, and he will be sorely missed.</br>  <br>Fuck you man, that was my grandpa.</br>  <br>jesus christ</br>  <br> 666 <br><br>ahhh</br></br></br>  <br>jesus that scared the shit outta me</br>  No twintails?  <br><br>cute</br></br>  <br>that's actually kind of funny</br>  <br>Hey man you try making an anime and living of minimum wage. Some Korean in-between animator probably committed fan suicide because this thread assbag</br>  <br> 666 </br>      <br>That is fucking horrifying. I think I might actually get nightmares from this</br>  <br>shit's like a fucking Mobius Strip.<br>it just keeps looping in on itself</br></br>  Do QUALITY subs count?  <br>No.</br>    <br>:V<br>what is that even supposed to convey?</br></br>  <br>:V obviously.</br>  <br>I always hear it as a penguin wenk when I read it for some reason.</br>    <br>ha you little cunt im a fast reader</br>  <br>Cheeky</br>  <br>Holy shit</br>    <br>You could fill this whole thread with it.</br>  <br>I kind of want to save this for future use but goddamn, it creeps me out to much to keep on my hard drive.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>You could fill the whole board with Sailor Moon Crystal.</br>  <br><br>Sailor Moon Crystal Meth</br></br>  Chie no...  <br>for u</br>  <br>If you're posting QUALITY Chie then why not DoubleChie?</br>  <br> QUALITY thread <br>Otherwise known as a "let's cherry pick bad in-between frames that you need to be watching things in slow motion to ever notice" thread.</br></br>  <br>When it's being animated at what feels like 8 frames/second, a frame like this stands out like a sore thumb.</br>  <br> He doesn't watch anime at 3 FPS. </br>  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING  <br><br>   </br></br>  <br>Is he okay?</br>  <br>Most likely something like "fuck it good enough, the deadline's tomorrow".<br><br><br>Okay fine, there's some actual shit animation. But these threads are mostly still shots of in-between frames.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, that fight was actually horrible.</br>  <br>you're right</br>  <br>How is it that toei is in charge of some of the most popular anime ever?</br>  <br>Because they can get it done cheap.</br>  <br><br>Nevermind a TV series, their work on MOVIES is fucking disgusting nowadays.</br></br>  I love Durarara but boy does it ever have a ton of QUALITY.  <br>dear god the eyes are like a dead fish</br>    <br> guy with the newspaper <br><br> "whyboner?" </br></br></br>  <br>That's not QUALITY, she's just Lupin V</br>  anyone have the drawing of the girl running track with an extra joint in her leg  <br>Holy fuck.<br>Glad I dropped this early.</br></br>      <br>Mother of GOD</br>  <br>Lost.</br>  Quality in manga?    <br>Nice trips.</br>  <br><br/></br>    <br>We need more images like this.</br>  <br>Yea, but is QUALITY.</br>  <br>What is even wrong here? I don't see anything.</br>  <br><br/></br>      <br>Need to see this in action. slo-mo gif?</br>  Hahaha, good thing the idolamaster doesnt have any of this kind of stuff  <br>Legitimately spooked. Stop possessing people to make your art, Satan.</br>  I'm disappointed at the lack of 'am I kawaii uguu~' in here.<br><br>The bird. Not its sound but its actual head.<br><br>At least post the page with the roast chicken.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that actually what her face looked like?</br>    Does anyone have that one pic where the perspective is hilariously fucked up, resulting in a city street looking vertical?      <br>Thanks for the nightmare, Satan.</br>    <br><br>Is this supposed to be legitimately terrifying?</br></br>  <br>The best thing in Another is the images made from it.</br>  <br>i think cthulhu art is more obedient of euclidean geometry than that abomination</br>    <br>Alright, now i've seen everything.

Dumping a 3-volume superhero manga by Takao Saito (Golgo 13). Crunchyroll published this a while back, along with a few other Takao series. A kind anon ripped them.<br><br> Takeshi and Kentaro are two friends who have been together since they were infants. They were born in the same hospital on the same day, have shared every class in school and even vie over the same girl. However, soon the two friends become closer than they'd like when they discover they are the Chosen Ones that will defeat the powers of an evil being and his minions who are currently wreaking havoc on mankind. Together, the two merge and become a super fighter known as Barom One, capable of taking down monsters with ease. Can Takeshi and Kentaro band together to save the world? </br></br>  Is it actually any good? I never got around to it and after Doll, I didn't think there was much else to see.

Everyone's waiting for Kubo to finish so they could fight over who gets to animate the Quincy arc.</br>  <br>This right here<br><br>I mean how can we know how Obito who is literally a clone of Naruto with some defect genes really felt about something that happened years ago unless we have it explained to us 30 times from every other character's viewpoint in flashback after flashback to the point where sometimes we need a flashback from a flashback in order to fully comprehend how Obito feels RIGHT NOW.<br><br>Some might call this filler or shitty writing, but I call it character development.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right now, none. Maybe when the manga is done, in 4 years, it will be adapted into a 25 episode OVA.</br>  Reminder that LNs are the cancer that's killing anime.  <br>We don't need a reminder. We can see the seasonal charts and the idiots that populate LN threads.</br>  <br> bait <br>There are lot's of LN series that are about things like murdering, drugs, or even adults.<br>Every media has their genres but that doesn't make LNs or manga bad.<br><br>There are some that had shit adaptations too.
