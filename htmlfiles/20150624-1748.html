[ can you name a better movie than this?  I watched some shitty B movie on Netflix like this a long time ago.  You can watch this movie twice!  Fuck this hipster shit film        The trick is to turn your monitor upside down when watching it.      I liked it but there are many better animated films IMO  Let me bring up the ol' MAL and post movies I rated higher while triggering everyone  End of Evangelion Lupin III: Cagliostro no Shiro Byousoku 5 Centimeter Akira Mononoke Hime Kurenai no Buta Perfect Blue Shoujo Kakumei Utena: Adolescence Tenkuu no Shiro Laputa Tokyo Godfathers Omoide Poroporo Ouritsu Uchuugun: Honneamise no Tsubasa Macross: Do You Remember Love? Paprika Densetsu Kyojin Ideon: Hatsudou-hen Kappa no Coo to Natsuyasumi Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance Redline Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu Eve no Jikan (Movie)  Theres like another 50ish movies down the way before Patema but you get the point                            yes, a good deal. It was an enjoyable movie, had its flaws but was fun.       Yes, I can.  I won't, since this is a fucking rec thread and you're not pretending very well; but I can.       eve no jikan  shit forgot it was a movie, how is it compared to the OVA     Why are anime movies so shit?      Eve no Jikan was great Redline was fun but the ending sucked Paprika was fun Akira and Princess Mononoke are, well, Akira and Princess Mononoke          I thought it was condensed really well, didn't really miss out on any of the important scenes. It wasn't worse by any means, if you want to rewatch it the movie does the job.    They aren't, you are just some pleb newfaggot shit taste trip trying to get attention. Filtered          I didn't think Eve no Jikan was better than Patema Inverted.  i cant even name that movie...    Woah another one!  Double filtered       Because they aren't able to condense the plot and character development enough to make them appealing for such a short time like a movie. That's why most of them end up looking uninteresting.      he thinks all anime movies are recaps of tv series       I finished Rebellion. ...So Madoka Thread. Reaction Images or general disscusion.   no   why can't Homura travel back in time to meet herself?  The only thing Homu did wrong was doubt the power of love and hope.     Homura did everything right.   Why must Homu sacrifice her happiness to make everyone happy? When will she get to be happy?   She gets to spend her life with her waifu. She is very much happy.    Helping thread reach image cap by posting best girl  Fluff   Best fluff of all     so when homu said she loved madoka what did she mean? is it a friendship love or a fug love?  Will sayaka continue to get rekt by hitummy in the next movie?    Legitimately happy Homu looks awkward.  Isn't it sad.       Forgot my gif    Happy homu is best homu. With the homu smile so rare it is second only to her legs.     I finished Rebellion  Haha, NO. Rebellion finished you.     I want to finish inside of homu    Oh it finished me alright.    The NTR is real   Hello autism general.   You tell me anon    Hey, how's it going?    Homufunposting general  Other magical girls welcome     There is literally not a more attractive woman in anime.   Every girl in one piece   WHAT THE FUCK IS THE NAME OF THAT HAIRSTYLE   3 naruto threads  what happend /a/?   Summer, summer never changes    not enjoying the cucking   But three is a bit much indeed     This board is fucking dead.  I don't even know why im still trying to defend it. Im getting mad seeing how awful /a/ have become.  I need to fucking leave this place.        It was like this before summer. Short long story is DURR HURR NARUTO'S ENDING PLS LET US HAS SOME BREADS PLS NO BULLY   fe if happened we had to return home   manga in the Anime &amp; Manga board   what happened   Vocal hipsters being deprived of the false authority faggot mootkins gave them.     Is Nurudu the threat anymore? Hell, do casuals even care about it anymore? SNK is far more cancerous and casual than Naruto is now.   There are a number of reasons why it's more tolerated, but if you want the main reason, it's because Kishimoto has momentarily decided to stop being a completely worthless pile of shit.  There's little doubt that he'll fall off the wagon again, but for now people are enjoying the series again. For the first time in a long fucking while.     So begins, a new age of shitposting.     newfags spotted      don't worry guys, coolest janitor will be around sooner or later to spare you your feelings and free up those precious first page slots for truly important things like UBW and loli discussions.     The whiny faggots are being put in their place. I for one welcome the change.   But wasn't moot the one who stood up for Naruto in the first place? I remember him making a sticky about it once.      Its not summer. Its the Narutards.  Since Naruto ended last year this board have become worst and worst everyday.   its ok guys Naruto just ended let them have their thread for 2 week only!   Yeah it is now june 24 2015 and they have a general thread on /a/.         Blame modcat for quiting.   narutu git gud   If you don't like the narutard threads why don't you just hide them? Are you really that autistic that someone discussing an anime you dislike is too much for you to handle? If so, you'd better get used to it.    He did but he was not energic enough and ultimately let the vocal hipsters have their way. Good thing those times are over now.    Because it's impossible to ignore you flooding the board with shitposts.    ITT:"Don't talk about animes I don't like."   There were three fucking threads about the Disappearence or Nagoto Yuki and no one said anything about it.  There are multiple threads of the same thing, shit memes, lolis, trollbait, worst anime, best anime, "would you", etc. People talk about the same popular animes every day. If people had some actually worth discussing, then the shitposting would stop.       hide the cancer wonÂ´t make it go away     there's literally nothing good to discuss at /a/  I guess it really is time to leave 4chan, huh...     Accidentally quoted. My bad.    There's nothing loli relevant to discuss anymore, the season is over.    I hope he moves his fucking ass. I don't want you fucking normalfag mongrels in here.     what happend /a/?  did you forget about that kike already     telling me to leave   Good argument, m8.       animes  Sasuga newfag narutard. Fuck off.     Report them.   Wait a bit. The /a/ successor is coming soon.       Just look at this thread. This place is awful and so are we.    Both you and me brother, both you and me    Sure it is, just like how it's easy to ignore you whiny faggots spamming "fuck off" in the Naruto threads (as if that's honestly going to accomplish anything anyways)   Neither will shitting up the threads in true autistic fashion.        no one  But we did.     Abusing reports is against the rules, unlike Naruto threads.    I don't even like this place anymore, I just refresh the catalog eery now and then to see if there's a thread about lewd loli to save the images dumped.  I fucking hate every single one of you, but I hate the normalfags even more.      normalfag     Your newfag is showing m8. I never even said that I hated lolis. Stay butthurt.        But what comes next now may be even worse.    Yeah, too bad you fucks keep going to other threads with your tumblr shit.    http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/com<wbr>ments/370x40/please_fuck_off_of_a/</wbr>   being this butthurt     Hownew.ru   Better than "le shh lolo is sleeping xD", "what does rins butt smeel like?" and "which k wood you on loool?" shit, such a holy and sacred board full of intelligent and informed chinese cartoon discussion you autists are protecting from le eveel narutards there   Yeah, "m8".    I've never been to tumblr though.    reddit   You guys are fucking desperate.         can't talk about manga and anime on the manga and anime board    All of you are whiny fucking children, jesus christ get a hold of your lives.     Itt: Lets see who can shitpost and bait the most   Yes, that's /a/ now, if you don't like it you can go to one of the millions of naruto forums out there.   Naruto threads are not alowed, do not post them. moot agreed, don't bother him about it.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YgH<wbr>NtzxO0y8</wbr>  [ ]   The bigger problem is that generals are coming back, again.  Why can't these fucking threads stay dead holy shit.     Why doesn't the new admin just make an /ag/ board or some shit then?     Narutard   LOL! SERIOUSLY? I don't even like Naruto, you faggot. And went I meant popular animes, I meant Naruto, too. Are you that fucking retarded?     Can you tell your normalfriends to fuck off?  They can't even check the catalog. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127102393  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127099317       We realized naruto is objectively better than other shonen and anime like vn adaptations, sol, and yuri.     lol   fuck off to leddit      *when     LOL   animes  Please stop it Nagi, you are hurting my feelings with your post.      faggots think they own this board and its content   turns out they dont   bawwwwwww      Yes I agree, these metashit threads are infinitely worse than the threads they're whining about.     LOL!  You're not helping your case, narutard.       Fuck off you autists.     Legitimely can't tell who's baiting and who's getting baited right now   HAHAHAH  BUTT.BLASTED U T T . B L  A S T E D                The last monument to the piece of shit that was /q/.    It's a meta thread, why do you care in the first place?    Did you just call me an autist? Do you want to taste the edge of my ancient katana?   /a/ is dead. Thanks moot for fucking up /a/ before leaving    people actually think I like Naruto   Autism, the thread.      Are you me? I only hang around loli threads and yet even these threads are getting shitposted by buttmad crossboarder normalfags.  /a/ was like a second home for me but now I don't recognize anyone anymore.      It's weird how everyone is talking about how /a/ used to be, but apparently only a few people like yourself actually remember what it was like.    Just enjoy the show. Here's have a loli.   /a/ died when kinomod died. This is just the rotting corpse filled with worms and shit.   There are millions of forums and websites for you fucks to talk about naruto yet you just have to talk about it on /a/. please just fuck off onegai!   The thing is, loli threads literally don't discuss anything. They're pretty shit and consist of "i want to drink this loli's pee" or "what is this loli doing" and eventually lead to 3DPD child talk. That's why 'normalfags' get buttmad.    Loli spam?    spam naruto threads, not this one   Most of the vocal anti-naruto userbase has migrated out and the shit that fills most large 4chan boards has migrated in.    Fate lolis a shit.     Yes because welcoming normalfags on /a/ is such a good idea right.  Look at what happened to many boards here on 4chan all of them are just full of cancerous normalfags.  Do you seriously want /a/ to become like this? Of course you you're just a piece of shit Narutard.        Fuck off no one of /a/ moved to your shitty 8gag.    If I want to drink sweet 2D loli piss is none of their concern.    I think I'm still here forever, it's just impossible to leave. There isn't a single thread worth visiting /a/ anymore and I still come here every single minute to lurk.     using lol and animes   Autism, the person.      Your right, Bake have better lolis.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5Dm<wbr>YLrxR0Y8</wbr>  [ ]   Check 'em   Quick someone false flag spam some more Naruto threads and then bitch about how we've allowed the board to go to shit. Hurry!   No don't. Do you like to be like these autistic mankids?   Personally I have no problem with Naruto threads. I also don't believe in the reddit boogieman as Reddit too has an /l/ section, meaning anyone screaming "PEDOPHILES" isn't from /a/, /l/ or Reddit(which leaves the last place that they can possibly came from would be tumblr).   Try to love all lolis, anon.         Didn't Naruto end? I remember a lot of people saying just let the faggots have their threads until it ends. Why are there still like 4-5 general threads 24/7 now?   attempt to remove moe from /a/   get flooded with battle shounen threads   we warned ya, enjoy your DB and Naruto      Naruto GT happened    I wasn't talking about that one but okay, the influx of other boards and degradation of /a/'s once toxic wall of 'board culture' us undeniable. /a/ is no longer the biggest board the normies stay away from, it is falling back into the cesspool of low quality posts. Which is natural for a board of this size.   I'm glad. I don't even like Naruto, but it's funny seeing you nerds have an aneurysm over it.   muh /a/ culture      By the way, where does all those DBZ threads come from? I notice the increase of DB thread in winter. What happened?     It's getting a bit annoying with all the narutofags shitposting in other threads with their shitty memes.   /a/ is not the moe board anymore.  Its the battle shounen kids board.      NOOOO U R!!!111!!!   Faggot.      Now they're talking about its sequel.    It's not even a sequel, just a time skip.     Is that you barny? Are you gonna call me a mongoloid next?     DBZ decided to raise from the dead and release movies and a new anime out of fucking nowhere. Kind of like how /a/ had Digimon general for months after they announced the movies.    Generals are the cancer killing all of 4chan, not just /a/, sadly.  And what's up with this posting the fish thing every day? It'a the definition of spamming, yet it's allowed to continue.       I'm not bamy  So, no.    What shocks me the most is how long this thread has gone while it's obvious bait and counterbait. Nice job mods   No I'm not you fucking mongoloid.   I bringed popcorn to watch this absolutly hilarous thread.   Because everyone else are newfags.       newfriends  Fuck off       We have threads like this one once in a while.     mods   Are those fucks even active anymore?      Everyone with a brain stay away from this kind of thread. Its just retards and shitposter.  Just watch and enjoy the shitfest.     all these dead threads   only general and bait/shitposting get replies   more and more people hating on loli   blogging shit everywhere   Naruto and One Piece are currently the most popular thing on /a/   20 bait recs thread everyday   Normalfags everywhere   Its over for /a/ just like how it happened to /v/ and /co/.  The last bastion of 4chan have now fallen.               /a/ just has to accept this is the battle shounen board.    Make me.    /ag/ would be a terrible idea. Splits the community too much, fosters cancerous general communities.    Generals weren't a thing till like 2012. How is 2012 considered oldfag?  Fuck off, nurutufag.        You are still on the same level of cancer as them so you might as well fuck off    /ag/ board would probably work but, still would be shit happening like now but less of it maybe        It was an odd choice of words. I swear I'm not crazy.   You should have inspected your post quality while you were at it.        Because muh board culture.    Ever think maybe there wouldn't be so many bait threads if you morons didn't always fall for them?    /k/ is good    Board culture bitch But it's honestly the least of the problems here.     /k/ is small.    I suspect the anti-loli shit is cancer spilling over from /b/. Combination of a year or so of 24-7 loli general faggoty plus confusion over the increasing amount of child character Source Filmmaker porn.  I noticed that /co/ is shutting down Steven Universe general threads during the hiatus. Those are some smart motherfuckers.    Generals weren't a thing till like 2012.          Given how shit the community is now I doubt we'd be losing much value.   There's only one way to know for sure.       Board culture isn't even that bad compared to literally everything else going on in this board and in this very thread.     I suspect the anti-loli shit is cancer spilling over from /b/.   I'd say it's most likely from normie sites like leddit and dumblr.       because then we are admitting that /a/ is just /v/ but with anime.  and it won't fix the problem of "anime you don't like being talked about"       /a/ have good mods   Where?     Not only are there many Naruto threads, if you sort NEET catalog by activity, you can see that one is always among the most active threads on /a/.    /a/ has many mods.   It's just that this time of the day is one of the worst times to be on /a/. Low traffic means the only posting gets done in shitty generals.  Moot once said something along the lines of /a/''s toxic 'culture' being the reason why it has higher post quality than comparable boards.   inb4 moot who?     Isn't GT supposed to be really short? Implying Naruto will ever end, of course.    This truly is post moot 4chan.    When the new dragon ball comes out it will be hell.     animes   Nagoto  Why don't you kill yourself instead?      I'll take fucking Dragonball over 15 Fateshit/Yahari threads that all start the same way any day.   Being elitist is a dying culture.  Newfags don't want to lurk anymore.     You guys complain about Battle shounen threads, threads about SoLs, Harem threads, VN adaption threads  But you know what we have lack of? Threads of things that have nothing to do with anime.  Mods are doing alright.         Shut the fuck up fucking faggot you must be 30 y.o. fat fuck who still lives with his mom and masturbates to CP    For how much /a/ hates /v/, you guys sure act just like them   wah, /a/ is dead!    [insert fanbase I hate] shouldn't be allowed here! It's my own private club!        from normie sites like leddit  Reddit has an /l/. It can't be them even if they have the equivalent of our anti-loli shitters from /b/ because they'll be busy shitting up posts in /l/eddit.   I don't think tumblr has any lolicons.        This. Dragon Ball at least is influential unlike eroge powerlevel harem shounen and generic harem light novel    Very true, if you go to /v/ they have anime threads.    Generals started with their cancer during K-ON and Strike Witches. They were temporarily purged, but made their comeback in 2013. Now we have at least 20 plaguing the board. You can see the terrible culture they brought along with them. If someone ever makes a second thread for something, they go  check the catalog newfag   there's already a thread, idiot  Even though they had a catalog much later than anyone else, the vanilla 4chan retards.        Yeah, we have a brony mod that doesn't even watch anime. How about that? Do you remember kinomod? Well, he's gone too. /a/ died a long time ago, deal with it.      And how would you know that, crossboarder scum?    Just take a look at the catalog. It's not that hard.     Who care about your shitty opinion on an anoymous website? Nobody.      s-surely nobody goes on m-m-multiple boards!     /a/ died with Kinomod     implying /a/ and /v/ don't share a large userbase     /a/ is the only board I browse.   Where are my NEET bros at?     condoning crossboarding  /a/ truly is dead      That's the problem.    This isn't 2010.    I love you too anon.   Mods have always been shit, self moderation on the other hand is highly effective.      I'd take Naruto over Fate, Monogatari, or Kyoani shit.   Looking for jobs because being NEET sucks.    Holy shit what's wrong with his neck does he have scoliosis    TruNEET up in here   I want old /a/ back.    Summer, and Reddit refugees fleeing Chairman Pao's purges.     I'd rather take Fate, Monogatari, or Kyoani shit over Jojo cancer and Aldnoah tumblr.     people cannot have multiple hobbies   This is the problem with the elitist: they think people should only have one hobby.      Then get out.    IRC ran out of fuel for baiting Hibikek threads because the yuri stuff stopped happening every episode. so they had to switch back to an old tried and true bait, like forcing crossboarder favorite series with multiple threads. this OP is actually probably IRC as well.      Too bad. This is the new shit, stand up and admit.     There were two threads here but they're both gone now.    I think /a/ died with n/a/ruto.    Who?    I would too, yet /a/ seems more content on attacking a /v/ boogeyman or Naruto than purging Jojo.   Dear oldfags,  You say now that /a/ has gone to shit.  Can you please explain or describe the quality or type of threads 'old' /a/ had?  Thanks.          There is literally nothing wrong with visiting multiple boards. moot even said boards should promote crossboarding more      mod/janny woke up    /v/ isn't video games.    And I want old /v/ back, but that ain't gonna happen.    Good times.   Let's say we find a new /a/. Which shows would you not allow to have threads? I'll pick naruto, madoka, and jojo.    people don't want me to browse other boards   but then they get mad when I post off-topic stuff on here since I can't go to other boards to do it  Interesting stuff...     moe loli and    50 Fate threads   including this    muh board culture  They need to go ahead and change the name board to /a/utism.         /v/ isn't video games  Doubtful. They were complaining about how a game for invaded by SJW and allowed same sex marriage.    The only good threads are airing day threads of average shows to shows that people generally avoid and its been like that for as long as I can remember. Why can't people make interesting OPs? I liked that guy who made those cinematography threads. Sure, it always devolved into shitflinging but that's just /a/ culture but it does spark interesting discussion.    this will never happen again     2010 counts as old  Pffft.     yahari, fate, snk     Don't forget to isolate Type-moon shit somewhere else    Why are you there if you don't like /a/ at all. Do you just shitpost?    Jojo, Madoka and Yahari. As bad as Naruto and Fate threads are, at least they are discussing the shows.    Your complaining isn't helping OP.  /a/ acts like a bunch of spoiled brats. Christ this place is worse than /b/, /v/, or even fucking /tv/. At least those places, amidst the shitposting, have decent discussion. This place is all whining. No wonder it's a dead board.   We have constant Naruto threads learn to respect us we belong on /a/ now.    We didn't have Naruto threads or shounen powerlevel threads.   Not posting is always an option.      Time for a WEG thread.  Post WEGs.      Freshly made OC  Is there one for LOGH?   Make it yourself  Here, I'm even giving you the template           The last one barely died a few hours ago.  ITT: describe /a/ with a screenshot            which one /a/?  Kiss-shot because every other Shinobu is weaksauce in comparison and no-one is afraid of a defanged vampire.  All of them.  Zatch Bell General  Favorite Momodo? Favorite Spell? Arc?  Lets talk,   anime was shit, manga was better    Wonrei best momodo           YOU KNOW WHO'S GOT THE POWER  Tia Baou (though Kanchome had the best selection) Faudo arc    Ted &gt; all  Is this a horse?  I WANT TO KILL THIS FUCKING CUNT. SRSLY :(  I want to kill this fucking cunt.    tfw you don't know if your ship has sunk for good or is looking great, because translators have different takes on that spoon scene.  Also, one more day until the BTB threads days are numbered.  Shitposting OP, stop it.               No, that's a shit and worst girl. Yuckyno A SHIT.    why the fuck do you post this in every thread?    Fuck you man     So, Yui is the hero the Service Club deserves.    Brothers?   Spyro finally started, yay!     1/3   All this proves is that Yui is a selfish cunt.    2/3     All this proves is that you are a complete idiot.     Now that's alpha.    Fuck of falseflagger    Yukino loves 8man   Yui loves 8man   Yui and Yukino are best friends   8man is romantically stunted  This sounds like a huge plot point going forward. This will impact their relationship a lot.       3/3     you will never have your own coma cheese       Try to hog too many things at once and they all fall off from your grasp.     Yui   character who's chronically unable to assert her own wants over those of the group   finally decides to stand up for herself   selfish cunt   We've been through this dance already with Yukino between the election and genuine speech, so how about you get          She is the hero they need.    Komachi is scary, too scary. Yui and Yukino look more concerned than taken aback.       Yeah, that fish is big   - If there would be no refuge, it wouldn't find its own place... Always hiding, going with the flow, sticking with something... And hitting an invisible wall   - Which fish?   - It's about myself   I like this bit a lot. Seems like Yukino is finally coming to terms with what she wants to do; she was a lost fish but now that she has Hachiman and Yui, it seems like she finally found a home of some sort and will stop going with the flow   Makes me think Yukino is going away for a period of time; if so, then it means that she is not going to follow anybody's footsteps.             MAX 300 coffee  I would drink the shit out of that DDR used to be my fucking game.       Yukino is going away for a period of time   Literally White album 2 Watari is a hack      No Iroha allowed below this line   -----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------</wbr>      So will Yui get cucked?    That's not nice.   Good Irohasu, everyone!  How do I stop this underclassman from being so sly?     kinda surprising she admitted it. I figured that was going to be a big source of conflict later on.       Responsibility  [ ] Take [ ] Leave      Not if Watari doesn't want his best friend to sue him for plagiarism.    Do you want a boring thread? Because that's how you get one.   Now that we know that Yukino/Yui are going to go for the 8 how would they respond to another girl going for him?     cockblock.   We dont care about losing/winning.  She has enough points. She will just NTR 8man, when he meet his kouhai again, after the time skip     You're not alone brother.    I wouldn't do anything that I'd have to take responsibility for. Not when I've got to hurry home to my gorgeous bun-headed ray of sunshine and cook dinner for her.    Best girl is best    What kind of life do you live that leads you to fantasize about living a normal life?   All girls other than Komachi are complete shit.   This is a well known fact within both the scientific and literary communities.   You cannot debate me on this. It is indisputable.       He's just come home after banged his kouhai    Irohabro shop owner says no.   Irohasu~   Thanks, brethren.    80% of pixiv is Yui     Is she softer than Yukino?  I want to use cocytus on Iroha   Spoilers for borderline blogshit  One where I wasted most of a decade of my life dicking around, so now what's most appealing to me is peace, stability, and the love of a kind and beautiful wife.     Fuck Iroha, Yukinon 4 life.  Why are Hiratsuka and Sensei the only ones that look like actual brides.   Probably more bouncy. Soft is hard to say.   Yui deserves to win and should, iroha is pretty fun, saki is great, Yumiko a best and yukino is a bitch. Have a nice thread guys   use that on your Onisama. Dont touch our goddess or she will NTR you     get home and cook dinner for her.   anon what is wrong with you, is it happy marrying a  vase ?       Hiratsuka and Sensei   You need to sleep, m8.     Alpha &amp; Beta    Made for titty-fucking     Iroha is the second biggest 8+Y shipper after Komachi though, no way she'd ruin all her hard work baiting one of them into finally taking the 8bowl.   Who would be a great trophy wife?   I wish she had heels on during the series instead of boots. Heels look a lot better on her anyways.     two right feet  Jesus Christ.     Give us your definition of "trophy wife" first.    Haruno. She certainly wouldn't be a good wife in any other respect.     yumiko has 2 left feet  Why, just why.    Irohasu!  8man should 8 both the girls against their will and see which one he likes better.   that's why Hayama won't fuck her    I'm gonna miss you captain. IROHA OR DEATH    What sort of position is 8?     I never noticed that, wow. Artist fuck up I guess      You have eccentric taste.      can't fucking unsee  Th-thanks anons.          I want the Irohafags to leave, you got your romantic moment translated already so please leave us alone to discuss the drama.   They wear a strap-on and fuck him in the ass.    In Japan? Yumiko. She's blonde. And very, very cute.    Sticking his 8 in them, typically via behing or missionary.    Eccentric how?    I fucking love cooking, Alton Brown is one of my idols. Yui's meme-flaw is a flat out win for me, since I don't mind the extra work and I'd get to play teacher in her efforts to not be a failure in the kitchen.    I'm trying to imagine a blonde Japanese woman being sexier than simple black hair. I just can't see it.  The only reason Yumiko looks cute with blonde hair is because she looks white.     At this point I'm okay with anyone but the spoiled rich brat bitch winning.   And the kind of girl who will be nothing outside of highschool. Her days are numbered, soon she'll just be some random pretty girl.     what the hell does a vase have to do with marrying Yui?     You underestimate how far in life being pretty will get you   éæ¥ã­ã¹!     I can't help it, she's on my mind.    Go watch Japanes Propaganda : The anime You'd like it.

Crocodile &gt; Oars    A lot of the shit involving family matches should have been dealt with in a compressed format; none of that villain backstory bullshit and haki recovery.  I'm willing to bet even some of the shit leading up to that chapter could have been cut down.     Doffy thread? Doffy thread.   Daily reminder that Oda is a god.   Hello fujo!    Is this just a translation thing or does the original text use the word gears?    You can clearly see a gear that was drawn anon....    Can we get a non-cancer shit edition?     alluding to gears turning and shit is nothing new or groundbreaking  im fairly certain there's even a word for it     Dressrosa is the worst arc in One Piece. In the last 3 years the story has not gone anywhere. It's just been fights, fights, fights and fights. Boring.   I definitely wouldn't describe it as boring. I think it's just stressful to read when you have the climax stretched out for about a whole year.  Binge reading the arc would probably be really fun.      The final fight is definitely a lot better with the fat cut out.  http://imgur.com/a/pjYoN#0      Sorry, I mean for the first one with the Blackbeard pirates.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127054173  Can you switched to Blue Gilly? He needs the advertising more      finger in front of his mouth   well that ruined the picture     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127054173  Remember the good days? https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZzD_<wbr>HP0KRI?autoplay=1&amp;FORM=VIRE5</wbr>     Well I guess that really shows how much time they wasted towards the beginning of the fight, because gear fourth comes at around the 2/3 mark, and that was only a month or so ago.    That's because they had to make room for the flashback and executive fights.   Doflamingo is dead. He was using his strings to keep his organs together. Luffy fucking killed him.   I'll never complain about flashbacks in One Piece, but yeah the exec fights in general could have been a lot shorter, especially the ones without Strawhats involved directly.   I can't imagine losing consciousness for Doffy would be very good for his survival at this point.        He's not dead. The Dressrosa arc is everything going against Doflamingo. He's going to live just so he can deal with Kaidou splitting his ass open.    Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!   This.   doffy goes unconcious   birdcage comes apart   the strings holding his insides together come undone  He's done         People still think Oda kills off villains after all these years     but yeah the exec fights in general could have been a lot shorter   Disagree, all of them should have been 2 chapters each. Kyros vs Diamante suffered horribly from the 1 chapter fomat, but at least the anime can extend it a bit.         Maybe I'm wrong about anything needing to be cut. I just know that I won't even get the nice relaxing post-arc section to relieve tension any time soon because of all the unresolved elements of the plot. It's frustrating.    Hody doesn't even belong with the rest of them.     He can't be. His presence is still necessary (unfortunately). For one, he still has that "secret" about the government. Why would Oda mention it and the just kill off the only reasonable link to actually finding out what it is. Plus, there's still the CP0 unaccounted for. I am betting they will intervene somehow. Or some other asspull logical by the standards of One Piece.     Oh god this is priceless. I am not even judging you, but rather thanking you for the laugh.    This nigga gets it     You sweet summer children never learn.      One piece thread   OFFICIAL ONE PIECE THREAD   Doffy   Doffyfags   epic   btfo          Hopefully that means you got the joke.  I was getting concerned that /a/ was the dumbest board for a little bit.     Am I the only one who came oceans with the whole Red Hawk / Radio Knife combo animation?  Toei finally delivered    If there is no twist to this ending we riot. Doffy was such an underwhelming fighter when push came to shove. Zoro, Fujitora, and Luffy all could've annihilated Doffy.  I guess it fits that Doffy was so weak when his crew was so pathetic.     They do seem to be pretty spot on for the major moments of the arc, even if they skimp on everything else.   So if Ace took over as Whitebeard's second in command, who was the original?  I like to think it was  Crocoboy      No some parts of it still looked iffy to me, not as clean as the manga.    There's also this.    Marco was 2nd in command when Ace joined Whitebeard's crew, all the way to Whitebeard's death.  I don't know and don't think it has been said who was 2nd division commander before Ace.      Doffy had a strong jaw, and even stronger glasses. I'll give him that.    wut     The only person tankier than Doffy was Whitebeard.     Doffy was more than adequate. It's just that he got rightfully worn out by all the shit happening all around him. Fuji might have been able to take him on. No assistance, Luffy or Zoro would be a stretch (but still possible by one piece standards). I think his fruit power would overwhelm them if he was in prime condition.    He had been pulling all the strings, and he overextended. Got cocky, got taken out. It's impressive that he lasted as long as he did with how many plates he was spinning against such heavy resistance.   I wish Luffy would have defeated Doflamingo with Gomu Gomu no Nakama, a technique where Luffy remembers all the nakama he met on his journy and uses a storm gear four attack   It's just world development so when the world gov. pull out some terrible thing later it isn't entirely an ass pull.    They'll probably put that shit in the anime.    Yes and he morphs into a giant smiley face (plus his straw hat).     losing against non-haki Luffy   Crocfags  topkek      It IS fun. I'm doing that now while anticipating the next chapter and it's shocking how many breaks/hiatuses OP has gotten during the arc.  Two years, man.      what the fuck am i looking at    Quality     That's over nine months.  And that's terrible.    Best translator?  DOFFY DON'T LET YOUR KNEES TOUCH THE GROUND   Viz translations, google Vizanons imgur album he uploaded their translations.    thanks     seems to be missing caesar and foxy, and the east blue villans where pretty memorable, kuro, don krieg and buggy.      I blame the corazon flashback, rebecca flashback, entire chapters of people running, colloseum dudes making comebacks and screaming I WILL HOLD HIM YOU GO AHEAD LUFFY, tontattas being tontattas and the entire goddamn arc re-starting all over again when the collosseum ended.

Was Kyros ever good for anything beside providing his fanboys digusted reaction images ?   why do japanese VAs refuse to learn how to pronounce foreign words?  why do they think this sounds good?  reto hok    rachio naifu         There is literally no intention to pronounce it as if it were English and not a loanword.     That's how they learn to pronounce them. They aren't responsible, the japanese english learning system is. To them this is the correct prononciation. Take Final Fantasy for instance  ãã¡ã¤ãã«ãã¡ã³ã¿ã¸ã¼   Fainaru FantajÄ«  How do you expect them to pronounce anything right when they use katakanas as a crutch instead of trying to learn foreign prononciation ?        how about reading the manga?    I did, I just don't like him.    nah, for me he is one of the more likable sidecharacters in this arc   Is One Piece a manlet fantasy?  Look at Manlet D. Luffy vs. Doffy Long Legs .. guess who won?   Fuck Oda.      In 10 chapters it's chapter 800. What does Oda have in store for us?  How is he going to drag the Kaido reveal or the Big mum reveal for 10 chapters?     You think we'll ever have a scene where someone (Akainu or BB) will reck Luffy and Oda will show us the Straw Hat shattered and on the floor?    is goliath sum sort of manlet fanatee?    luffy is 19     people actually think Oda plans something special for this chapter just because of the chapter number     Chapter 100: Dragon reveal and escape from Logue Town Chapter 200: Luffy lands ROCKET PUNCH on croc Chapter 300: Skypeia party Chapter 400: The SH break into Ennies Lobies with the train Chapter 500: SILVER FUCKING RAYLEIGHT is revealed Chapter 600: The return of everyone on Shapondy.

No.   She's too old.   Luffy is destined to die a virgin.         I want to breed Hancock     Well,the whole "let's beat fucking Kaido" was just a ruse to trick Doflamingo and Law's character has been already exploited to death,there's a possibility he will fuck off when Dressrosa is over.    Water Seven wasn't boring. With Garp and revelations and all.    You wouldn't han a cock, would you?    Except for the fact that the next destination is Zou, where Law's crewmates are  did you read any of this arc      I'd let her han my cock boa.     no more Doffy   implying thats a good thing      Flamingo is literally the most over hyped villain with the shittiest crew in the manga so far    Just look at this thread    You're entitled to your opinions, but you're still wrong and shall be mocked for it.     No more copy pasted Crocodile with copy pasted crew    Good      I look and all I see are retarded faggots with the mindset of a 12 year old     implying copy paste   implying Doffy is not the better Croc      Move the mirror out of the way first.    defending this shitbag of a thread  <br/>   Yes and half of them are sucking Doffy's cock. No more Doffy is a good thing.    kill yourself    Can someone post the image from the anime where the entire crew is shown on the ship looking utterly retarded?    Never, because I think the Hat represents Luffy's being. Kinda like a Vivre Card, I guess. The Hat getting destroyed would be like Luffy's will being broken and that 99% won't happen.   Manlet refers to height, I think. Not age.       You mean Akainu.    Holy shit, all these years and I never realised that was supposed to be a Smiley. I just saw the thumbnail and my brain starting ticking, gears churning and it clicked. Then I read your post and felt even more retarded. Goddamn.   How to defeat Zoro: Put him inside THE most difficult maze or labyrinth ever created by an architect.  And the most difficult one currently made is the one made by a particular recently deceased Janitor.   Still can't find a full version of that pic anywhere, only a few prints were ordered I think.          Just have him fight  Buggy  D. God    Won't work. If you try to defeat him, that means he's your opponent. And Zoro always finds his enemy, no matter how retarded he is. Also   THE most difficult maze or labyrinth   He can't even navigate a straight road. A maze would be a waste of time and he can just cut through it.       What does it do?    Gives you powerups over and over again until you win the duel.    http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Symbol<wbr>_of_Friendship</wbr>   Post YFW Kaido is never actually seen and stays in the shadows for the rest of the manga.           We never see Kaido   We just get to see dark silhouettes of him that look different every time they appear because Oda can't decide on his final design.            Trafalgar kills Kaido off screen.          Anyone have that chart with Donquixote family and names of who beat them? With Doffy updated?     Awesome, thanks!     Violet    Usopp     Wut        It refers to her going from wanting Sanji's D to wanting Usopp's D.      Saga is not the same thing as arc, Punk Hazard is part of the same arc as Dressrosa, Long Ring Long Island was just a warm-up for Water 7 (it started the whole Aokiji thing and the crew not being strong enough thing), the East Blue was all one saga.   I've been trying to find the angelic music that plays when sanji sees the mermaids for the first time (and a few other parts where he sees beautiful women).  Does anyone know what it's called?     Epic or not, it's about damn time. Fucking finally.    Alright, let's talk about Doc Q.   always eating apples   apparently has this thing about "luck" since he's always mentioning it   Did he eat the Luck Luck fruit? Previously owned by the Pirate King, Au Roger?        Is haki getting too out of hand or can Oda manage to control it so that every character doesn't have to have haki in order to be relevant?   Lucky Roo is more likely to eat the Luck Luck fruit for me, there was a panel of him and him alone just watching Luffy escape in the submarine.    is Oda refusing to have women fight anymore,or was this because they mentioned how Dressrosa women are very romanticly passionate    Sugar and Jora are women. They did pretty decent too, considering they're opponents.     Sai and Usopp have the most confirmed kills in this storyline  Usopp i can deal with, but Sai is a fucking filler.     Dellinger counts for girl.   Alright everyone, post your favorite volume cover.   I think that Doc Q's powers would be something that would cause death, like a sickness or a curse. His nickname is Shinigami, he carries a scythe, he dresses like a western undertaker. He rides a horse like Death does, and is very sickly. I'm predicting that Oda will give him a plague or sickness fruit, and have him do the opposite of what he's supposed to do as a doctor, making people sick instead of helping them.      40 and 61 are big contenders.  I dunno I like most of them.       Sai is a fucking filler   filler  he is pretty much a confirmed future ally at this point      always good without luffy    Nami looks like she's about to deceive everyone again. Did she even wear that dress in TB ?     There are babies out there right now who were conceived right as the battle with Doffy began     Or buggy. He's the only one that's damaged it so far      What's her name again?   We Brad Neely now.    So his power is to give luck to everything he's looking at?    Literal P. Erfection.     Law vs. Doc Q confirmed   Law joins Straw Hats confirmed      Hand On Cock    now i'm thinking of luffy being rekt and every strawhat on the lfoor like luffy at saboby before the timeskipe     Implying the Surgeon of Death would fight Doc Q.   Implying Law won't be the first in Doc Q's harem.      Id like it to imply robin was raped    You quoting the right person ?      If luffy gets rekt so does some or all of the crew which means rape time    No, stop asking, Hammock    Hammock    Boa Constrictor     Sai   filler   what are you talking about?      Daily reminder that no chapter this week.   Not necessarily. Luffy got rekt by Crocodile, Lucci, Moria and he was pretty fucked at the end of Dressrosa. His screw mates were relatively fine and dandy.    can't wait to soil this on christmas     implying they won't go "there can be only one"     Liar.    It's a new meme to call anything you don't like filler.     Implying Usopp won't tie Chopper to both of their heads and the horse's too.     Really?    So, God Usopp solos both?    You're goddamn right. You can't beat the afro, anon.   can we agree that this arc has been fucking garbage minus the Dofla/Law plot and Barto/Cavendish?  Who's ready for this bad motherfucker to join the crew in Zou?   He probably saved the others from the attack by Big Mom, too.      Can we agree to stop rating things in black and white?    He will never join. He will be just an ally.     enel   a villain   yeah sure....       I have nothing against him joining and all, I just can't see him past an Adviser role or Mentor role, you know ? But, it would be cool to see him throw the Ponyglyph and at someone's face just when Robin and team are coming back.     There is an autistic fan theory about Doc Q that I actually like: he has eaten the Death Death Fruit, where he can take a (cause of) death and put it into an object. Like, when he gave some guy an apple and the guy who are it exploded: Doc Q took a "death by explosion" from some other guy and put it into the apple, causing the one eating the apple to suffer the death. Of course you would only suffer the death Doc Q gave you if you were about as weak/strong as the guy who was originally supposed to die that death. Like, just because some weakling dies with one punch doesn't mean his death could be taken and then given to Luffy, who would survive the punch.  Something like that. And he appears so sick because he has so many deaths collected that they start to affect him. He is the ship doctor because he can simply take the deaths of his crew members and put them somewhere else.        It was too rushed.    nope.     relatively fine and dandy  Usopp would disagree, Zoro wouldn't but Chopper would say he got hurt badly, then Nami would but thats because she's a bitch.     That sounds like the worst fucking fruit. Luffy is literally the only person who can get defeated by that and that's because he's 100% retarded. Like, shit, he goes around looking for dead people and draws their deaths or something ? And in a fight, he just punches his enemy but he has no idea what kinda Death Punch it's gonna be ? Admittedly, the last one would fit the whole fate bollocks.     Why? Penguin doesn't seem to appreciate Bepo.    people don't want to accet this arc being garbage because that would mean 1/8 of the manga would be garbage without counting arcs like Fishman Island and Punk Hazard. So they pretend this arc is good so they can sleep well.    OFFICIAL ONE PIECE THREAD   OFFICIAL   all caps  this is why you piratefags are cancer       Hamcock    He will obviously die just before asking Luffy to join the crew. That's what usually happens with some announcement of the distant future: something bad happens to prevent it.    The arc was decent, the best parts were the flashbacks funnily enough.  Getting insight on Kyros and Law and understanding their plight and motives really carried the arc for me and made it fun to reread.      Well, not every crew member is supposed to be a fighter. Also, we know that he fights with a scthe anyway. And it's not like he couldn't be creative with his devil fruit, for example by shooting bullets that have a death of poison in them or shit like that.     Usopp can disagree all he wants but truth is, his body was just fine after all those fights. He was kinda out of it after fighting Mr. 4 but could run around and do shit almost immediately afterwards. Same in Little Garden, Skypiea, Enies Lobby and Dressrosa. Same with Chopper. Hell, the only time I remember him getting rekt is because of his own damn Rumble Balls.   Of course, everyone did get messed up in TB and Sabaody but that was kinda different to what I was saying.      Boa Mancock   Post the best One Piece laugh NOW.   please don't fuck my chart, sanji was the one who made ger switch sides not usopp.    Ahh, right, okay, that makes sense. I immediately figured he could only cause death by Apples for some weird reason. I'm sorry Anon. I do like the idea of it being somewhat random though. Like if he could imbue his Scythe with his ability like Whitebeard but he couldn't control which death he can imbue. That would make for an interesting fight against  Chopper       piropiropiropiro    Pikkyapikkyapikkyalala! Finnish laugh best laugh!      YOHOHOHOHOOOO!! Or, ZE HA HA HA HA HA!!!       Chopper   not Brook   riding on Chopper       Dellinger    girl   He's a femboy.       nope actually she didn't switch sides because she never considered herself as a member of the Doffy family     Zehahahaha     Arguably healthy Skeleton dude riding on perfectly healthy animal vs Terribly sick Death guy riding on a dying horse.   Fucking poetry.      Still she stopped pretending after seeing Sanji's guts. Writing usopp at violet's panel on the chart makes no sense considering the rest of it.    If Hody gets on that list then Foxy deserves to be on their too.    Don't worry about it bro.

Even foxy and don krieg have more rights to be here than him.      I want to know how they were during Fishmen Island. When there is already this much shitposting about a good arc like Dressrosa I don't want to imagine how it was during a actually bad arc.    OPfags defending this trainwreck in 3...2...1...  Wait! They're already here!      What are you even doing here?    I knew he was getting increasingly moe, but I forgot how much of more character he had earlier in the series. Reluctant to fight, insecure about his fighting ability, socially awkward, strong sense of duty, both the smartest and most naive person on the crew. Now he just does "cute" things and has cartoonish forms to fight with        Saga villains         people disagree with my opinion so they must be fanboys  grow up     I fucking hated how during the fight between tashigi/Zoro and Monet, Nami was carrying Chopper rather than the other way around.    I actually used to be an op fanboy so I can recognize bad taste by my own experience, luckily I grew out of it when the manga turned to shit.  Just having a laugh at the fags who have yet to open their eyes (:      sure son, whatever floats your boat    I'm not at all surprised there's people who defend this fuckin trainwreck, we had these types during the Fishman Island arc too and nowdays is generally agreed to be a piece of shit by pretty much everyone.   inb4 autistic "but fishman island was great!"        Arlong was the SJW not Otohime  Otohime = Martain Luther King Jr   Arlong = Malcom X (aka the first SJW)         Wouldn't Jinbe be Malcolm X? Militantly racial at first, makes his name off it, then becomes more tolerant which ruins his crew/life    possibly    Yes, this is a kiki/goku kind of situation and Oda can't skip the opportunity to suck more of that Toryiama dick     kiki  u w0t?      Kaido never being seen is his comic thing   we have an entire arc against him, complete with fight   when he is not in the shadows he's hidden behind a tree, another guy blocks the visual, a random seagull flies in front of him  10/10 would laugh      Imagine if law and luffy had taken up doffy ' offer for a tea party, and the last nine months detailed that tea party.    that face   that petition bullshit   that entire flashback  Worst character in One Piece? Worst character in One Piece.      Tomorrow we get to see Doffy's eyes whose excited?   and age correlates with height     Tomorrow  Are you sure?     Tomorrows wednesday  We get the spoilers tomorrow night      I don't go to sleep till after spoilers are out, so its tomorrow    Like that fucker in Gintama who kept getting absolutely shat on, on his face.   Not in One Piece it fookin' don't.       It's Rebecca    We all used to be or are currently opfags. Plenty of people have grown out of it like you, and plenty of people still like it. Difference is, we can recognize its flaws but still enjoy it. You're not a special snowflake faggot.   Threadly reminder    Reminder that Bonney is Big Mom's daughter too      New World is a very dangerous place   Lola and her fodder crew survived it without any harm  inb4 noone attacked them because of Big mom iplying any random but dangerous and ruthless pirate would know about that fact        Bibli card     She's Whitebeard's duaghter.    It was a rougher time, give them a break.    Holy fuck how did i not see this before  I'm so dumb  I didn't even think about luffy being able to negate Enel until it happened either   I've probably not noticed so much shit           (:  pretentious little nigger. fuck off.      Holy fuck how did i not see this before  maybe becuase you joined during Marineford arc?    I dropped this arc around law's past, how far is it to the current chapter guys?   Nah i remember Lola talking about her mom on Thriller Bark, i just didn't even think it could have been Big Mom     I dropped this arc around law's past     Can anyone else think of other nice foreshadowing in One Piece?    Shanks vs Sea King       Dropping at the best part of the arc     Bonney is Big Mom and Lola's mother.     Look's like you're both doing well, that's good  Why is Doffy such a good boy?     interesting     I dropped this arc around law's past   bruh      gr8 b8 m8      Why would you notice it first time? At that point Big Mom hadn't even been named and she wouldn't be named for about another 100 chapters, so around 2 years later. Unless you reread One Piece or are actively reading and posting in One Piece communities why would you remember fucking minor-character Lola possibly being Big Moms daughter?     That bit with Croco thinking Luffy had armament haki for a split second during the Alabasta fight.    When did he think that? Did Croc even know about haki? And if he did, why didn't he use it then?     Bonney is Big Mom's mother.    because his will was weakened, he didn't intended to use his own strength to achieve his goals, same with moria, their wills were on the floor    Big Mom is the three-eyed girl.    It's pretty obvious Nami grabbed Big Mom's card instead of Bepo's and sailed straight towards her. They're probably nowhere near Zou, or as far from as it as you can get in a couple hours    That crazy    big mom was at dressrosa, they didn't moved with the ship    I don't think she'd move her flagship into Kaido's territory just to maybe catch Caesar. If she didn't find them way off the coast was she going to launch an invasion? The risks are way bigger than the rewards   aint kid and his allies the ones who've been messing up with BM?    It's pretty obvious    bump     someone post the tumblr version   Lucci is a good boy  is this foreshadowing?   do we have an official flag list?    He will die saving the Pirate Empress.    God can only hope   Speaking of Sanji theres a good chance we'll get a glimpse of Team Sunny next chapter   hopefully Sanji aka worst character in all of One Piece will be lying in a pool of blood      Keep hoping. The despair of losing that hope will be delicious.   Sanji is one of the best Characters in One Piece   i like people like u    that and it was already explained that if they did somehow manage to beat Doflamingo at this point, Kaido would just shift his anger back to him and Luffy since they were the ones that ruined his whole operation in the first place   imo Sanji was a pretty nice character pre-timeskip    Since the CP9 are based on animals, will they be a part of Kaido's furry army?   Ok fair enough, you win. But I reread the Usopp vs Mr 4, and he got hit in the skull straight on by a FOUR TONNE BAT. Like what the hell?!    *Pre-Enies Lobby FTYF The whole deal with him still refusing to hit Kalifa even though Robin's life depended on it left a really bad taste in my mouth.       not Colombia Flag why fucking live?    Daily reminder that Usopp is the best crew member   Threw up on* That would be perfect and I would love it.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127083656  Oops, sorry, wrong thread!    Nami and Robin are going to sex him to death    The fuck? Why you hating on Sanji?  Degenerates.     Axe hand Morgan is literally yonko tier, single handedly took out Garp and escaped from a fleet of marines.  Post yfw Monet joins the Strawhats        Makes fancy custom thrones for his seats  I think it would be totally embarrassing to ask a carpenter for those weird seats.     But they already have an undead member?    I originally asked it to be edited since Usopp was the one to make her panties soaked, cucking sanji.    Fuck yeah   Lucci is a good boy   the sad thing is there's actually monetfags out there who thinks she's going to join the strawhats  how can one be so delusional? At least bartfags had some chance      It's like WSJ realized that no one likes Toriko so they have to resort to extending arcs of manga that are really popular in order for them to have time to find a suitable replacement.   Oh, wait.       he's weak as a fuck and got no powerup over the time skip    do you think doffy's chair is comfortable?    Bart has no chance ever since it was known he had his own crew.  I don't know how people can still believe Monet will join though.      You mean like when Buggy did that at the very beginning?     got no powerup over the time skip   wut      ussop cucked sanji    He can fly in the air and water and can also spontaneously burst into flames    I hope you waifufags choke on dirt     you will never be hugged by a hot, big-titted snow harpy   just fucking kill me      Thats how you build tension and give the victory impact, would you rather a linear fight&gt;fight&gt;fight structure? cause then you're pretty much reading bleach. A lot of plot points have been resolved/developed since then. Just not the major arc defining one.    Human fruit. If you're human.     Chopper seems to be able to turn into a giant moose just fine.  Also, Son Goku ate a human fruit and look where it got him.       if you are human     NO FUCK YOU LUCCI IS A BAD KITTY    Chopper is not a moose, and still he can turn into a giant one.  So with a human fruit you could still turn into a giant no problem.      he is a reindeer    It's official, the glasses are shattered!!!    Yes. He is not a moose. Are you retarded?    and what makes you think he turns into a moose?    Jinbe first being mentioned in chapter 69, but not actually appearing until chapter 528 is fucking insane.    His monster form is obviously a moose and not a reindeer.    Franky can do all of that with technology.What's your point?   They are going to have one hell of a party after this   It's starting to feel like there won't be any sort of real tension relief for a while now.    where though? dressrosa is not even worth rebuilding by this point    The only important difference is the antlers, which are still clearly reindeer antlers.    Point still stands, you could turn into a giant human with a human fruit.    This. They'd be better off finding a new island to build on instead of removing all of the rubble before building.    Didn't Oda say if a human ate chopper's fruit nothing would happen?     Monet AND Sugar joins     only if you awake it and someone with a fruit so useless like that would never learn how     turns Sanji into a toy and throws him overboard  Yes please     The arc is currently naruto-style shit in general though. I can't wait until it's over.    no    Rayleigh appearing in the Buggy arc (volume 53) and not again until volume 52.  Current favourites are Corazon hidden in the Film Z color spread, about a year and a half before his introduction and Baby 5 mentioning "the skewering treatment" in 762, 23 chapters before we see Doflamingo's awakening in 785     What do you think will happen on chapter 800?    naruto-style   oh wow      Kaido reveal or start of Wano arc. Possibly both.   Definitely coincidence, but I love Luffy doing the Gear Second pose all the way back in chapter 64   forgot pic    Oda's suicide    No joke, right now I'm looking forward to the next naruto chapter more than OP. This arc kinda sucks.    As much as Dessora is a 3/5 at best  Naruto is really shit right now  Gaiden was great at the beginning but it took a nose dive kida like a sped up version of the origignal  I hope this is the first and last mini-series that kishi does and stops milking the franchise and actually does something new          Rayleigh appeared that early on?   Who is Luffy's mother?   It was a flashback when buggy was thinking about shanks and they were talking about what was colder the north or south pole    Just realised I said 53 instead of 3 but here you go!  Chapter 19.       2015   Not knowing Crocomom    Summer time sure is here        croco is luffy's mom   [citation needed]      And just for reference, he next appears in chapter 500.  The 481 chapter gap puts him just ahead of Jinbe's 459 chapter gap like        literally Oda's own mouth   I want summer to end       Needing citation for a basic fact   Do you need a citation for that you need air to breath?      Now I'm wondering what the North/South pole are like in the One Piece world.   Would you a female Doflamingo /a/?   absolutely    Dunno she seems pretty crazy    Is she 10ft tall?     He probably saved the others from the attack by Big Mom, too.  His personality is too plain to join, Robin have that role.     yfw doffy and luffy still need to have a conqueror's haki battle   yfw it's not over yet     they already did that    Of course. fufufu~     If they prolong the fight and decide not to release a chapter the week after, I will join ISIS and lead the towelheads straight to Japan.    Animals on Rusakaina can shrug off Gear 4 attacks     yfw Kaidou is an animal from Rusakaina who ate a hito hito no mi variation     http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo<wbr>-way/2015/06/23/416819751/man-who-c<wbr>reated-the-pink-plastic-lawn-flamin<wbr>go-dies</wbr></wbr></wbr>   flamingo-dies     When your hoping that Oda doesn't delay the next chapter but calls in sick today.    Doflamingo confirmed for not being dead.    Beheheheheh    Well for me the card thing just stuck around my head and when Big Mom started to be mention it just kind of clicked. I didn't remember Lola's name so I had to google for a bit but yeah.    crazy for muh dik    male doffy &gt; male croco female doffy &lt; female croco      An Armada is going to come after Luffy  He's defeated three shichibukai. The gorosei are probably fuming     Duh he dies next chapter    But they already have   DOFFYFAGS BTFO  B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T L O W N  T H E  F U C K  O U  T  DESTROYED  DEMOLISED  ANNIILATED                            Or perhaps he has done them a favor of deposing Doffy. Also, technically he mucked around with the status of 4, if you count the fact that if Luffy is working with (and not under) Law then Law's status as a shichibukai comes into question.    and this panel too    Do they honestly think that'll work? Luffy and Law along with the SH are both on Kaido's and Big Mom's shit list. The govt won't dare try to interrupt a Yonko, especially if it's those two psychopaths. Their best option is to sit back and watch as Luffy and crew get rekt by Kaido and then swoop in after Kaido leaves.           wanze is his father   it all makes sense      http://strawpoll.me/4723144   gooooooddddddddaaaaaaaa      Holy Shit   Early spoilers.  By Redon on AP   Chapter 791: Ito Ito no Mi -Law removes Doflamingo's heart -Shoots it with Doflamingo's gun -Burgess steals the Ito Ito no Mi               Geez, you guys are so easily impressed. It doesn't take a genius to reuse a concept.      When you remembered that Sabo survived the Canon blast in the Ocean, and, suddenly realize that Monkey D. Dragon saw his drifting body and took him aboard the crew.    No, Bellamy is just a shit head and not creative enough to use his fruit properly.   Not learning to reflexively creating springs out of your face when punched to bounce safely out of attacks.        when you realize zoro probably met dragon as a child   when you realize zoro asked to see his strength   tfw all of zoro's tatsumaki techniques are based off of Dragons wind-like powers      Law better fucking kill doffy  I told you I could pull the trigger      yfw the ice island Ace met him on is the North Pole and he really did set out to prove Buggy wrong     No. They gain nirvana.   I'm really just too much of an impatient spaz to watch the anime, or really any tv show at all. But i did see a few clips on youtube, (Brook's song, Hachi stopping Luffy from punching celestial dragon) where I felt like it actually nuance that wasn't there in the manga. I'm not gonna watch the whole thing, but what scenes would you guys recommend for me to watch that you think are better in the anime?   Just literally pick any one piece video and most of the related videos will lead you to the good scenes. Manga + watching highlights on youtube is the way to go, there's way to much filler shit with each episode being 1 chapter.    MUHFUGEN BIX NOOD #FISHLIVESMATTER     This  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9Xt<wbr>vRAUgdQg</wbr>  [ ]   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mY8<wbr>U-0vZUy8</wbr>  [ ]        https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N-U<wbr>TMrbo6vw</wbr>  [ ]  MMV of Law &amp; Luffy vs Doffy, it's pretty good.     Whats your opinion on Doffy and Doffyfags being epic and permanently btfo?   I liked Doffy's concept and powers, the fight itself was dogshit and disappointing though.   As for the second thing, i find Doffyfags and AntiDoffyfags to be fucking annoying.        Wouldn't Jinbe be Malcolm X? Militantly racial at first, makes his name off it, then becomes more tolerant which ruins his crew/life  That's pretty accurate.   joins militant hate group   becomes famous   has change of heart, leaves hate group   people pissed that he left the hate group try to kill him (Hody)           he couldn't move because he used monster point i think    Kizaru kicks luffy and says "too slow"  Luffy dodges the pacifistas beam which is based off of kizarus beam and says 'too slow'       implying anyone will let him     Kicked by kizaru press timeskip. Dodges beams post timeskip.  speedreading        Idk, did Malcom X know Fishman Karate?      Wait, I thought Luffy was supposed to represent Brazil, Ussop was South Africa, Zoro was Japan &amp; Franky was America?     Nope, SBS was just Oda random guess to what nationality suit the SH better, and this is just a color spread, people should stop taking Oda serious on this stuff.    IF they were real people    Holy shit, what    After the kalifa's dad shit I expect plenty of this stuff to be all over the place but we only find 1 out of 3 each chapter    What's the Kalifas dad thing?    Top kek     I second this. Please decipher you incoherent spasm of a thought.     Whew.   Should I watch the anime from the beginning or read the anime from the beginning?   Beasts that can't be tamed must be put down    Depends on your taste, the voice acting is good and the anime is mostly good at the start. However nowadays the anime quality is horrendous and only adapts half a manga chapter per episode so they have to padd it out with bullshit filler scenes, walking scenes that can last up to two minutes and disgusting still shots that last hours.    Don't forget about the op that is always a full version and the weekly recap with adds like 6 minutes of nothing.    That's why you should've Marathon the show instead. XD     read the anime   anime   read  time for bed kid        XD  Get the fuck out.     You should definitely read the anime instead.    True story nigga. The moral of the story is, go back to the beginning, watch the show in little bits of pieces and try not to get butthurt about it. XD     XD  Do you have some tick or something, just kill yourself, I refuse to believe there are people like you on /a/.     Shit, I haven't notice that error. Fuck it I'm going to marathon the manga this summer.    Your right... I shouldn't say those bad words to you? ;)       Your right... I shouldn't say those bad words to you?  No, you shouldn't, glad you understood.     Eh, when the anime is good it's a lot of fun. When it's not, you'll definitely wish you had just stuck with reading the manga.  I'd say read it first all the way to current, then watch your favorite parts.     Post your favorite reaction images this season.                  moshi moshi.      Smug anime girls scare me               When I worked on that same image I was wondering if I should go with her full body or just the face. I chose the latter because it's easier to recognize in the thumbnail. But I admit that it doesn't really look as nice.           bruh          Cyan's faces.          this season     How difficult is it to understand "this season"?     <br/>   They are a good source of reaction pics.                She's got good reason to be smug.            Don't ask for whom the Bellri tolls, he tolls for you.     Isla is a reaction face goldmine.               The entire show is.          please do not bully moe      You mean Zack.   The face of rape  someone post sore aru          mfw finally understanding it       Taaki?    but moe is made for bully                 /u/.jpg     Why does white come off as crazy but she's actually the opposite        She is a gold mine.          Hestia will never beat the meme queen.        literally who    Figuratively you    Did you just try to crash my Firefox? Too bad, my Surface Pro is to gud for that.         what part of this season do you not understand?      Who is this fluid druid    reiko hakamori                      If Shinoa had a cat...      It's impossible to pick just one.   n-nice filename          <br/>    <br/>   I want to fuck that cat.    Is that meant to imply that Chaika is  a boy?         As a waifufag, I can confirm this is true      what the fuck      Anon pls     She didn't react that way inside Yamada's body   Miyamura, Destroyer of the Cunt.      but Miyamura is gay    I fucking knew this would be the second post!       HIBIKEK IS A REACTION GOLDMINE             Hah! Try again.        Please explain... I am clearly too stupid for this.        This thread and  are doing me wonders.  It's kinda from this season      Made this one myself.  And Commeme subs just made it even better   kek       Hestia's Zapp face  My fucking side.    Get to it, Genius.  I'd rather not, it's hard to stay awake at work if I don't get a good night's sleep.   You now realize that you became old, but you still watch cartoons.   I have to wake up at 7 am to make housewife chores.   You're not old until you have kids.    That sounds cute.    Dragonball creator Akira Toriyama stated that Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is weaker than a Super Saiyan God. It seems that a Super saiyan God Super Saiyan is just a super saiyan that absorbed some of the god power, sort of like what Goku did in Battle of gods when he couldn't handle the transformation.   WTF http://kotaku.com/its-official-goku<wbr>-has-blue-hair-in-dragon-ball-z-169<wbr>6943056</wbr></wbr>     Why is Toriyama so stupid? Why are Toriyama's fans so stupid?   The only thing keeping this shit alive is the nostalgia.    Interesting. I like the idea but if SSJGSSJ isn't a SSJG power up why is SSJG part of the title?  Toriyama is just a goofball with a fondness for puns and poop jokes. Expecting DB to make any sort of sense ever is a mistake.    I can't wait for english dub plebs to disown Super because it's not the bowdlerized HARDCORE DRAGON BAWL ZEE from muh childhood      Does Toriyama even know what he's doing anymore, I think he's senile.    ...kikoho    No idea, I guess it's because it's absorbed the god power.   Who gives a shit?   kotaku     I cant wait for SUPER SAIYAN GOD 3 SUPER SAIYAN 3    because his fans are suppose to be 10 year olds who scream a lot and you know....can not understand complex stuff.    Like... Super Saiyan God sounds like a "thing", like there are things out there that are them that aren't Goku... but SS God SS is a mode you can power up to, which is reminiscent of those beings. Just judging from how the sentence is phrased...  Ok, so in DBS there will be a new transformation called Super Saiyan Super Saiyan God that is actually a Super Saiyan and Super Saiyan God and not just a Super Saiyan using the borrowed power of a Super Saiyan God, because every new arc needs that shit.   And video games.  Actually, if you think about it, every industry seems to be on nostalgia mode nowadays.  Anime  More DBZ, Sailor Moon Crystal, Parasyte, Digimon Tri, etc  Video Games  Doom 4, Carmageddon, Final Fantasy 7, etc  Movies  Jurasic World, Ghostbusters, a shit ton of remakes (Poltergeist, for example)             only watch dragon ball because stupid   can't understand the complex waifu drama of other anime     Makes sense, I mean, he need the seven chaos- I mean seven other saiyans to lend him aid to transform the first time, If he wants the red state again he'll have to do that again, This is just what's left over from that. Toya should of named it Super Sayian Pseudo God but I guess that doesn't sound cool enough.  Is all this confusing bullshit necessary.  What was even the point of SS3 now that I think about it.      Seven chaos- I mean seven other saiyans  Kek      Final Fantasy 7  The only thing I think about this is that square is really desperate for FF bux since 15 is never going to happen.      the point of SSJ3  It was the next step up from SSJ2 and he fought Majin Boo in that form. So yes, 20 years later and there's some new stuff happening, doesn't discredit SSJ3 being the be-all end-all back in 1995.    Why is this shit even happening. Why can't you just let the dead sleep? It all should have ended with Buu Saga and fine, let GT exist too.  Other then the naming this actually makes some sense, but god damn the naming scheme is terrible.  So basically the original transformation to SSG is more or less equal to Bills, but because he ascended to God hood, Goku dramatically increased the power of his base stats to the point where he could still fight on Bills level. Blue Berry Goku is a attempt to gain back some of that god power since Goku would need to do the ritual again to achieve SSG.   Calling God form SSG is biting them on the ass hard, its just going to cause confusion.      Goku just needs to lose his God powers in some weird ass way and all gods of destruction die, so that Akira can end dragonball super early and GT can remain   This     Bills  stahp   Because money. And more DB is always welcome, especially if Toriyama is behind it and not whatever derpers at Toei wrote GT.        Yeah, and Toriyama also said that Goku realized that SS2 and 3 is just an inefficient way to draw his power, and he's not transforming in those forms ever again.     Beerus is a terrible name and you should feel bad about it.    The only way that DBS won't be a retarded &gt;defend the earth from x y and z again Is if the Z fighters leave and go to other universes with stronger enemies    Tell that to the guys who named him. Bills is a pisspoor pseudo-romanization that doesn't retain the pun.    clickbait  not today shill    Welp     kotaku   I ain't clicking that shit, learn to pastebin nigga.      Not the same anon but...  I've been offline for weeks, don't tell me that Square-Enix finally pressed the FFVII remake button?      Nothing   bait  About it      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kzn<wbr>ek1uNVsg</wbr>  [ ]    SSJG looks better than SSJGSSJ I'm glad it's more powerful    so basically, SSGSS was taping in to the god power, where as SSG is stronger with the full power of SSG. So what if he went super sayain with the god powers on?     I guess the blue hair is how it would look, Goku isn't able to fully tap into his God powers so the SSGSS allows him to tap into some of it. So its currently not as strong as SSG form but has the potential to get stronger.    This was an obvious thing to me since i knew about the transformation.   SSG is a transformation on itÂ´s own. So it canÂ´t turn into SS while on it, kind of like "Mystic Gohan".     Bills confirmed for stronger than Golden Frieza   Wow, what the fuck.  I can imagine that E3 and internet reactions.       Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan   fuck this shit, im just calling him blue hair goku     Oh boy    Punctuation on a separate line   Literally worse than Hitler.      He should learn to shut bitches in a middle of a emo swing with a kiss.    nice     I wouldn't be surprised if they were not clones but test tube babies   Yeah, I thought it was pretty clear that they're different blends, since they don't look like Negi and are called his grandkids. I figure Touta's parents really are his parents - as in, they really did provide the base genetics. Leaning on the way they call him Negi's grandson, I'd guess he's at most 1/4 Negi-derived, and at most 1/4 Asuna-derived.   If they Konoe clan is trying to make an anti-Lifemaker weapon, trying to get Asuna's magic cancel, Negi's magic talent, and Konoka's magic capacity all in one might have sounded like a good idea at the time. The problem is that there are a bunch of possible results that won't work (Touta, apparently), or might become dangerous in general (Touta becoming a mindless magia erebea monster), or would be an excellent new host body for Lifemaker to hijack (Negi's magic and Konoka's mana capacity).  I would also assume that this is plan B. A team based around Negi and Asuna themselves, plus support, should be able to beat Lifemaker - and DID, in one of the Negima ending timelines - but they're not available in this timeline.          thanks anon.
