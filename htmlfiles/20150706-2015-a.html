How did it end? <br>I know the manga is still ongoing or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, how can you say the Jap government in Gate is more friendly when they already killed thousands of people <br>So the nips should have let the imperial army raze to the ground Tokyo and kill all their soldiers in Alnus?<br>In Outbreak no one died only because the tsundere loli queen didn't sent the army agaist nips.</br></br></br>  I am at manga chapter 47.  Did the rabbit successfully kill Japanese senators?   <br> japanese government caused <br> implying the japanese were the aggressors </br></br>  <br> How did it end? <br><br>the gate is closed</br></br></br>  <br>What happened to the guy and the girls?</br>  <br>Most JSDF evacuates.<br>Itami stays behind and becomes badass knight.<br>Leilei manages to open the gate after 4 years.<br>First thing Itami does is visit Comiket.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He fucked them all into pregnancy, had a bunch of kids in another world, then everyone died of super aids.</br>  I can wait until he ends up boning that knight.  <br>He didn't choose anyway as well if I remember it correctly. Don't know why he didn't though.</br>  <br>He's definitely gay.</br>  <br>All of the couples in this are adorable.</br>  <br>What happen to the Empire? I may suppose the old emperor is forced to abdication in favor of her daughter after what happened with the nips</br>  <br>and what you mean by "that", exactly?</br>  <br>I do like the whole "MC gets a Harem, but pretty much every other dude also scores" approach.</br>  <br>JSDF lead full-on invasion into imperial capital. The emperor gets killed but Zorzal escapes and start running guerrila war against JSDF.<br>Not sure what happens afterwards.</br></br>  I haven't downloaded/watched the first episode yet but can someone please explain to me what the fuck they did to Rory?  <br>They made her better.</br>  <br>No more Goth loli</br>  <br>They made her more appealing to the masses.</br>  <br>The girls? Harem?</br>  <br>diplomacy failed than, unless Pina Colada go agaist the JSDF too it should her job to rebuild a more moderate country but the old empire is good as dead.</br>  <br> better <br>literal shit</br></br>  Be honest, you really think there will be a second season? why?  <br>Tumblr demands it.</br>  <br>But tumblr hopes and dreams got crushed by Reina's takisexual tendencies</br>  <br>Buchou's got rack</br>  <br> sample </br>  <br>Why are they sexualizing Kaori like that?</br>  Trombros  <br>They both play the trombone and are the love interest of the main girls of this season. Everything is so beautiful.</br>  <br>A good chance of it, going by levels of discussion created by the first one. Sales are above recent averages all points to working in favour of a continued production.</br>  It's funny meme, like Amagi second season<br>(but Keionium was sold even worse)</br>  <br>The story arc between Kumiko and Reina was Kumiko outgrowing Reina and leaving her behind.<br><br>At the start of the anime, Kumiko is a spineless follower who does whatever people tell her and keeps her real opinions to herself.<br>She's fascinated by Reina because Reina is different.<br>The two befriend each other, and Kumiko becomes captivated by Reina during the festival.<br>At this point, Kumiko becomes Reina's follower, if not a worshiper.<br>The two develop a strong friendship and Reina even admits to Kumiko her innermost secret, that she loves Taki.<br>A while later, due to the pressure, Reina starts showing cracks, she doubts herself and this time it's up to Kumiko to comfort Reina.<br>Then Kumiko's problems with playing start. Kumiko starts practicing hard, so hard that even her nose starts bleeding. She's under a lot of stress and is exhausted. At this point, Kumiko truly starts questioning the world around her. She tells Reina she also wants to become special. She starts bringing her instrument home and playing there. She gets into a shouting match win Shuichi despite the awkward situation between them. And finally, she realizes she loves playing her instrument, that she loves music, that she isn't doing it just because people around her do it.<br><br>Look the final scene of episode 12 - Kumiko is happy and excitedly talking about music to her best friend. Reina is stressed and freaking out because Kumiko talked about Taki. Kumiko wants to be special for herself. Reina wants to be special for Taki.<br><br>Then there's episode 13. Here, Kumiko is no longer Reina's follower. They're equals. Kumiko no longer acts in awe of Reina, or looks up to her for guidance. Reina isn't even the one to comfort Kumiko before they play, while Kumiko is the one who helps out Reina with the ponytail, at her request. Their dynamic changed.<br><br>I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if season 2 Reina stays the same way volume 2 Reina was. It would only show how Kumiko surpassed Reina.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if season 2 Reina stays the same way volume 2 Reina was. It would only show how Kumiko surpassed Reina. <br>Kuiko will only surpass Reina if she's capable of loving someone as much as Reina does. Otherwise, she's just a fucking normie.</br></br>  <br>I'd like to see the continuation.</br>  <br>Second years are the focus, so yeah me too.</br>  <br>Kumiko and Asuka are gonna be friends in the future, so of course she's gonna surpass Reina.</br>  <br>post this in animesuki. See the whole world burn.</br>  Um because Nationals? <br><br>Plus the piece goes on not saying its confirmed S2 but it's something to hold on to.<br><br>Plus with the director or whoever said at Anime Expo that he wants to do S2 helps as well.<br><br>I hope we get one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like a dream.</br></br>  <br><br>You dont need too, I'm sure those degenerates in lurk these threads.</br></br>  <br> animesuki <br> worried about what niche forums think </br></br>  <br> Plus with the director or whoever said at Anime Expo that he wants to do S2 helps as well. <br>Means nothing. <br><br>No-one involved with the show is going to deny the possibility of a S2, not when it might negatively affect sales of S1.</br></br></br></br>  How many children?  <br>The only degenerate here is Reina for liking a guy 20 years older and the people who are okay with that.</br>  <br>Why don't you tell us why there won't be one?</br>  <br>It sold like shit. SHIIIIIIIIIIIIT.</br>  I want to see Kumiko struggle with her newfound passion of music and the strong social stigmas she deals with from her family as they try to get her back on the path towards normalcy. They could also explore Kumiko discovering her own musical potential away from simply performing in a group as she goes on to become a magical euphonium girl.  <br>It didn't, I'll give you one more chance.</br>   you will never be knuckle senpai   <br><br>Kinematics / Kazu pls go</br></br>  <br>It did. Less than 10k is shit by kyoani standards.</br>  <br> TFW I did that edit <br>feels good to see someone using it.

Such a shitty post.</br>  THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN  <br>Cute meddling demon?</br>    <br>Eventually. They set themselves up for it by showing Mizore, Nozomi and even Azusa. <br><br>They also have to settle Asuka's issues which came to a head just before the comp too.</br></br></br>  What would make each character faint?    <br>Seeing those 6s.</br>  I'm drawing somethng...hopefully, you'll like it.    <br> 3DPD <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  I don't know how the sales were, but it would make for an ideal split 2cour show with the nationals upcoming and plenty of loose ends.  <br>https://twitter.com/erkin_kawabata/<wbr>status/589384655796731904<br> KyoAni shows aren't very high-budget and in fact below average <br>You = REKT AND BTFO</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>FUWAFUWA HAIR A CUTE</br>  <br>These digits have been wasted on you</br>  <br>SO WHAT? Free! was made with the lowest budget and it sold like hot cakes. They got a second season + a movie.</br>    How many more weeks before these threads die again like the rest of KyoAni shows?  <br>Am I the only one who automatically reads this as<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EtQ<wbr>bmtHe9lo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I'll make sure to make at least a daily thread. So as long as there are anons who like this show it shouldn't die.</br>  <br> SO WHAT? <br>Obviously the point was if KyoAni's budgets are generally below average then Hibike's 5-7.5k sales are not "shit" but rather "profitable."</br></br>  <br> 5-7.5k <br><br>They aren't shit either way. Unless we're talking about a big movie.</br></br></br>  I want Kumiko to blow me.    <br>What? That's natural since males are at their pride at that age, while women at Reina's age..</br>  <br>Reina is 15, she's a fucking child. Taki will be 40 once she's out of uni.<br>It's disgusting to say the least.</br></br>  <br>15 is the prime age for a woman you retard.<br>And Taki is 30's, which is prime age for men.<br>It's anything BUT degenerate.</br></br></br>  <br>Male athletic peak is ~29. Don't know if that correlates to mating.</br>  <br>In the times we live in, yes, it's fucking degenerate.</br>    <br>immoral, not degenerate</br>  <br> Being this much gay <br>Why do you hate living the dream?</br></br>  <br>Taki is very athletic though</br>  <br>He said his wife was the athletic one.</br>  <br><br>noise</br></br>  <br>What we've learned today kids is that don't be a faggot or else Double Satan will come after you</br>  <br>SHIT</br>  <br>OK guys let's keep the shitposting down...<br>Holyshit it's the third satan</br></br>  <br>The shitposting will never stop, especially with these retards.</br>  <br>shitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshi<wbr>tshitshitshitshitshitshitshitshitsh<wbr>itshitshitshitshitshitshit</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Guess the ride's still not ending</br>  <br>Hi satan.</br>  <br>I'm not gay. But supporting Reina and Taki is just wrong.</br>    <br><br><br>Samefagging Satan.</br></br></br>  <br>You certainly sound gay.<br>And I'm not supporting them, since I'd like Kumiko more, but Taki is a perfectly fine target to go for a girl like her.</br></br>  <br> and even Azusa <br>How is she even relevant? Her school loses.</br></br>  <br><br>Azusa x Shuichi OTP</br></br>  <br>The truth is, only insecure young men and homosexuals are opposed to age gap relationships.<br><br>Younger women prefer older men.<br>Men prefer younger women.<br><br>A woman peaks between 15 and 25. A man peaks between 35 and 45.<br>They're literally the ideal pair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where's the faggot who was working on that kaori doujin?  <br>ARE YOU NOT SUPPOSED TO?</br>  Do these girls wear any pantsu  <br>Reina will grow out of her crush and find a fine man or girl of her age where the power dynamic doesn't play a huge role in the relationship.</br>  <br>I want to talk about anything but anime but  Taaki-sensei wouldn't be using anything but GNU plus Linux or at least only freesoftware on his smarthphone, right? </br>  <br>He's apple's bitch, like most artists and musicians</br>  <br>Reina will either win Taki, or end her life by stabbing up the school.</br>  <br>but professionals use  GIMP and Audacity </br>  <br>Not really,<br>His phone is clearly not an iphone, and he has vaio-ish laptop</br></br>  <br> 15 is the prime age for a woman you retard. <br> my opinions are facts, you'd have to be retarded to not know that, baka! <br><br>woman aren't completely physically matured at 15 so I don't know what you're talking about<br><br>15 isn't that gracious an age for most girls</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So she's a spinless girl with self hatred issues.</br>  <br>My classmate had huge cow tits when she was 15, she hasn't changed now that she's 20.  I was so jealous of her. </br>  <br>Yes i think. Because theres plenty of material to adapt, and in fact, 2nd and 3rd season promise to be even better than first one.<br><br>Plus, least one of producers told he`d like to make an S2. Its rare chance for KyoAni, since for once they got a novel (not published by them, but they got all rights for adaptation) that is not total shit.</br></br></br>  Implying Taki wouldn't wait until Reina has graduated higher education at the very least. <br><br> On the assumption he would ever accept Reina </br></br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki.   <br>I'm not saying girls can't look matured at 15.<br>I'm saying that there's definitely still some ways to go for that girl before she peaks. <br>The difference between a girl at 15 and the same girl at 18 is fairly noticeable.<br><br>It's not massive but my argument was that 15 isn't the peak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But once the girl finished her puberty, she's ready. Girls are not like boys, who age slower than them. A girl is at her prime at 15 or 16.</br>  Look at this fucking loser  <br> prime is at 15 or 16 <br><br>I feel like this is just an excuse for you to favour girls of this age because I assure you, girls grow until 18 and in some cases into their early 20's<br><br>total maturity at 15 is damn rare and pretty much every girl I've known long enough looked better at 18 than 15</br></br></br></br></br>  Post rare takis  <br>Seeing him with his wife is pretty rare if anyone has that.</br>  <br>Unfortunately biology disagrees with your personal taste.</br>  <br><br>You have some very stupid case of brainwash.<br>Anyways, 14-15 is legal in many (most european) countries, and for a reason.<br>The average age when a girl is ready is now 12-13 years, but give them a few age, and at 15-16 they are almost always out of puberty.<br>After that, everything is just downhill, biologically speaking, though until around 22 there is only a little chance of genetic flaw.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's funny how all pedophiles can do is talk about muh biology when they get called out....</br></br>  Anime.  I'm going to marry Kumiko!  <br>So taki x reina is not only a delicious pairing, but it's also your best bet biologically?<br>sasuga</br></br>  <br>What? No, that has nothing to do with being pedo or not.<br>I only care about younger girls than Reina.<br><br><br>Not delicious, but noting inherently wrong, aside from him being her teacher.</br></br></br></br></br>  Still best girls.  <br>What are you talking about? That was the topic of argument in the first place, since you called the relationship "degenerate", so you addressed a problem with it from a biological viewpoint.<br>I just pointed out while there might be numerous problems of that relationship, degeneracy is not one of them.</br></br>  <br>Where are you motherfucker?</br>  <br> pedophiles <br>Reina is 15.</br></br>  What did Taki ask her?  <br>Get in the line faggot<br>I'm here first since we ever know her name</br></br>  <br>Left fagott &gt; Right fagott</br>  <br>16.</br>  <br>I hate pedos as much as you do, but there's no need to be the SJW on /a/</br>  <br>Why do you hate them?</br>  <br><br>It's going to be a long time. /a is pretty much the only place really still absolutely obsessing over this anime at this point at least.</br></br>  Tomoyo Kurosawa on Kumiko and Reina’s Relationship:<br>Transcript: An audience member asked about Kumiko and Reina’s relationship being very romantic (not recorded) and then Tomoyo Kurosawa replies “maybe” (audience laughs). Question: “Kumiko seems enraptured by Reina’s talent, passion, and even her beauty, and you have very intense scenes where your character’s attraction to her is almost all-consuming. So my question is: How do you get in the mood to (inaudible) with Reina.” At this point, the translator is asking the question to Kurosawa in Japanese. Translator: “Reina and Kumiko obviously have a special relationship and very special friendship. They are like magnets to each other, and seem like they were in a relationship in a past life maybe, but I could only express that in my voice because of voice acting, so to try to show that feeling as it is, you might have heard of “chuunibyou”, middle school girls in big love, so we tried to show that feeling.“</br>  <br><br>Random people on the internet that think Kyoani is some huge studio in Japan that expects massive amounts of revenue from everything. Like fuck they aren't even their own publisher, Pony Canyon is the middle man and the leader on their production committees these days with Lantis on music so let them worry about that shit. Lantis stands to make way more money off of Love Live singles than they do Sound Euphonium ones I can say that much. Pony Canyon also has way bigger concerns than some anime in the niche anime market selling over 10K or not.</br></br>  <br>I was thinking about It some days ago. <br><br>I think he asked how many time people practiced on the band, which would explain Ribbons reaction, but, then again, she is just a mad bitch so I really don't know. <br> <br><br>Please make It happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will marry Kaori!  Because the show was fucking great and in a just world, a great show gets a second season when it makes sense.  <br>KyoAni doesn't give much shit about Hibike though, they are probably preparing to go all out for their next big project, which will be probably something like Free's shota prequel.</br>  <br>Nah, I'm pretty sure these threads are going to stop being a general by the end of the week. The month at most. There's already been several periods with not a single H!E up for hours.<br><br>Mods finally started deleting those rolling images and replies and "if you see this on page one" garbage, so the threads won't stay artificially alive by these worthless bumps anymore.<br><br>Other than that, what do people even talk about in this thread anymore? All the spoilers are out, a few people argue about TakixReina, and like once every 12 hours a shitposter shows up spamming KumikoxReina fan art only to get ignored by 99% of the people in the thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We still need more Taki x Reina fanart and novelanon's cute translations.</br>    Was there a finished version of the Kumiko sounds webm?  <br> dat last pic <br>Ayyyy</br></br>  I literally just finished marathoning this for the first time (as in finished a few minutes ago). As someone who was in concert bands and chamber orchestras  playing flute and piccolo  all my life until I entered university, I found this comfy and nostalgic as fuck. I'm now so tempted to start practicing again and try and make my university's bands/orchestras. Anyone else in a similar situation?  <br>you're cute. Play something and post it.</br>  <br>B-but I don't have a microphone... I'll see if I can track down one of my old performances.</br>  <br>do your best!</br>  <br>What is it with Japs and "Haah?" I can't even think of an English equivalent, it's like a sound version of "...the fuck you say?"</br>  <br>Japanese communicate far more with voices.</br>  Best couple.  Why does Kyoani designs so goddamn sexual  <br>Fucking KyoAni man, now I want a whole 13 episode series about them.</br>  <br><br>www.animesuki.com</br></br>  <br><br> chuuni <br><br>b-but she's gay!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Never underestimate the dedication of shitposters, especially Kyoani fags. Their entire existence is basically defined around making shit up to praise Kyoani for. As they are forever insisting they'll find a way, but it's nothing to be proud of.</br></br>  <br>See top of pic related.<br><br>Also holy shit I was just finishing a dialogue of them right on band practice on Festival Time.</br></br></br>  <br>Are these characters named?<br>Do they exist in the novels?<br>Do they have their own short story?</br></br></br>  <br> specifying a single show with no evidence <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Free! was a special case. They used little money on it because it was Utsumi first project as directr. They were testing the waters.</br>  <br>I think they're on a HD at my parents' place, but instead here's probably one of my favourite songs that I ever played in a concert orchestra. Try to guess the time signature :^) https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_S2<wbr>2XO_zvG0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  i hope they completely get rid of that pointless shoe faggot with a second season. Taki-sensei and Tuba-kun are all the guys we need, and trombone contributes basically nothing besides blowing off a cute genki tomboy so he can go play with his horn. alone.  What did you think of LWA 2?  I was a little worried because it started a bit slow with all the introductions, but I ended up liking it as much as if not a little more than the first one in the end. Animation quality was superb. <br><br>I actually just showed my nine-year old cousin the first episode this morning and he really enjoyed it despite there only being subtitles. I was pleasantly surprised.</br></br>  I liked it more than the first, It was fucking cute. Like shit this was good.  managed to give me that same magical experience as the original, sat grinning through the whole thing. Bout to open a case and watch it again. Akko's grunts and (genki inhales?) was a really cute scene. Also liked how shiny rod took a back seat, and I was actually suprised when it came back as Shiny Ballista, was expecting the Luna Lana and the power of friendship to save the day.  Truly amazing, so amazing it made me feel like the scummiest douche for pirating it.  It did have a slow start and at first I wasn't expecting it to meet my sky-high expectations going in, but I'd say I liked it more than the first. I had a stupid grin on my face for the entire third act.<br><br>My only worry is how the franchise could translate to a series, if Trigger decides to go that route.</br></br>  So what flower is her hair based on?  Honestly, I've either become a hard cunt over the years, or I went in with the wrong mentality, because I left thinking "either the first one was better or LWA has lost its magic on me".  <br> &gt;rape<br>seed</br> </br>  <br>Don't know, but I really do pity you.</br>  <br>Bellflower.</br>  <br>It's not rape if she's on top anon.</br>  Amazing. Would buy merchandise.  <br>Yes! You rock.<br><br>Botany knowledge obtained.</br></br></br>  It was cute! CUTE!  How would one, hypothetically, go about giving Yoshinari a sloppy blow job and bask in the glory of his semen? Hypothetically how would one do that?  It was great, but some scenes were a bit slide-showy, like they couldn't be bothered to do in betweens.  Could be better animated. Decent overall, but could not watch it to end stopping halfway, something about it just not appealing and generic making me yawn.<br><br>Maybe i unconciously compare it to Pratchett books, find it not fun, and feel disappointed.</br></br>  I'm out of the loop.<br>Was this backed by kickstarter as well? Did I miss out on the chance to get amazing yoshinari art again?</br>  Did anyone feel like the construction worker guy didn't match the other character designs?   school issued rec polo's and shorts   Nah.<br>They tried to make it same as first one, but failed. Repeated joke is no longer joke. .. something like that.</br>  <br>It was cute, and inspiring. Was smiling like an idiot and tearing up through the entire thing.<br><br>I've always had an affinity for witches, wizards, and magic type stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>The first half an hour or so was weak, at least in comparison to the first LWA, but the entire parade sequence was 10/10<br><br>Overall the slow start was disappointing but it was still amazing and even the slow parts were more fun to to watch than the average TV anime because of the colorful cast of characters. I'm glad that I put money towards it</br></br></br>  <br>he and the mayor felt very /co/ ...those beady cold eyes</br>  Amazing.<br><br><br>Yes, but kickstarter wasn't the place they got money from. They already had funding but kickstarter gave them enough to make it almost an hour long.</br></br></br>  <br>Woops, I meant kickstarter wasn't the ONLY place they got money from.</br>  Trigger still got that magic. Hope I get a good genga with the BD.  <br>The mayor felt a little weird to me too, but unlike the construction worker, the mayor fit the style the more I looked at him.</br>  <br><br>What the fuck are you even on about, nigger.</br></br>  I was one of the people that put down $300 in the Kickstarter, and I think it was well worth the money. Generally amazing animation (especially the parade scene), all characters old and new likeable on some level (except for the bratty boys, but I'm sure that was the intention), and overall a very pleasant watch for me.  <br>I mean. Nothing really changed.<br>Akko is still idealistic.<br>Diana is still a bitch.<br>Sensei still helping from the shadows.<br>Power of friendship still wins.<br>Etc..<br><br>I would like to see characters learn from their mistakes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in that same vein all the uniforms were great.<br>cloaks<br>hoods<br>Shiny Chariot garb<br>branded shorts<br>sweatpants<br>polos<br>tshirt/pajamas<br><br>just another thing to appreciate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was really enjoyable. Definitely worth the wait  BD rip when?  <br>Are you sure you just don't want to admit you spent 300$ on something average, that doesn't bring anything new?</br>  <br>Nope, I'm honestly happy with it.</br>  It was pretty cool. I didn't think that the new 3 girls, especially Amanda who I thought was going to be a total bitch when she was first introduced, were going to be so agreeable with Akko and her plan. Hope they make a 3rd part eventually, whether it's Kickstarted or they get the money themselves.  Enchanted Parade - 01<br>Am I retarded that I thought there will be episode 2?</br>  <br> Akko is still idealistic. <br>Nothing really happened in LW1 that would make it absolutely necessary for Akko to stop being idealistic. That DID happen in LW2, so you can go ahead and make that argument if and when LW3 or the series(as long as it takes place after LW2) comes out and if Akko is still as bad as she was in LW2.<br><br> Diana is still a bitch. <br>Diana really isn't a bitch. She's more of a realistic person who isn't too great at showing sympathy. And again, nothing happened in the original that would make it absolutely necessary for her to stop acting so cold.<br><br>Anyway. Characters don't need to pull a full 180 at every point in the series to continue to be interesting. <br><br>They continue to act a certain way because that's their personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First LWA didn't bring "anything new" either, and people were trowing money at Trigger expecting to get exactly the same experience. And they obviously get it.</br>  <br>Delinquent witch thief is something I can get behind either way.<br><br><br>I remember reading somewhere that if the second OVA got a good reception they would consider a full series. It's always possible, anon.<br>Afterall,  believing is magic! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Diana is still a bitch. <br><br>Of all the things you mentioned this is the only one that actually bothers me.<br><br>They played it safe and placed their efforts on other aspects, the plot was certainly different and entertaining for whole new reasons, I especially enjoyed the way they got the citizen to join the story. Also the new characters were really cool.<br><br>Your criticism is very half-assed if I may say so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was kind of underwhelmed.<br><br>I mean, it was super cute at times, but god damn did it feel generic as hell compared to the first. It felt like I was watching a mediocre episode in a good series. It was completely predictable, the city felt lifeless, silent, and populated by maybe 20 people, I don't know why they even bothered introducing the stupid mayor character or why Diana was even in this movie. Nothing seemed to really flow, everything felt forced from the inner-girl drama to the bully kids. Not to mention how utterly lame the final "fight" was, if you could call it that.<br><br>And maybe I can blame it on really shitty subtitles, but fuck, the writing fell flat for me. Especially Diana's last line.<br><br>I fucking loved the first one. I need to rewatchit and see if I'm just blinded by nostalgia for something I watched a year ago.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>see<br><br>This anon said it properly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And maybe I can blame it on really shitty subtitles <br>They were funi-tier at least, so...</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Eh. I like liking things.<br><br>None of these criticisms really change the way I look at LW2.</br></br></br>  <br>I was kinda worried for the first half but the second half delivered. Really liked how they put focus on Lotte. Hope Diana gets to do more though except the occasional observations and "minor" assistance.</br>  <br> it feel generic as hell compared to the first <br> It was completely predictable <br>And how exactly is this second one not as generic and predictable as the first? The first wasn't exactly outstanding in both of those regards.<br><br>I liked both because they were refreshing in the sense that this type of anime is rare nowadays and it was simply fun. I actually liked the final fight too. I was excepting a Akko gets her staff, powers up and does everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you, I like liking things too. I didn't go into a sequel to something I loved just to not like it.<br><br><br>As you said, the first was refreshing since this type of anime is rare nowadays. And now that we have a sequel to expand on that universe, they didn't do much except offer us a completely limp city that's supposed to be particularly cruel to witches, except no one but five punk kids seem to care. The second one upped the genericness with run-of-the-mill friend-drama that's so incredibly common in children's cartoons over something that felt incredibly forced. <br><br>There wasn't even a final fight. The big bad mega-witch golem got up, put its armor on, and then stood there doing nothing until the power of friendship put him to sleep. At the very least, I remember Akko having to like, run and dodge things in the first short like there was actually an action scene going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>AOTS<br>Sucy is still the best</br></br>  <br>I think you have some decent points but in my eyes the good outweighs them by far.</br>  You know who's gay in this anime.<br>(Almost everyone except the males in case you're a bit slow.)</br>  <br>At the very least, it gave us some nice webms.</br>  <br>Well i like to think of the final fight as the previous accumulation of events with the whole spirit things and what not too.</br>  <br>Akko x Lotte makes much more sense</br>  <br>Then sucy x who?<br>Remember, Akko is her guinea pig.</br></br>  <br> the city felt lifeless, silent, <br><br>I can't help but agree with this. In addition to some panning over stills, there just didn't seem to me as much love poured into crafting the world outside the school, almost phoned in. I'm comparing this to Majokko Shimai no Yoyo to Nene, which by contrast had a lovingly created city, that really did feel vibrant and vivacious.<br><br>I'm essentially complaining that it "wasn't 10/10 enough" but it did have a lot to live up to. The parade itself brought back the magic, no doubt.</br></br></br></br></br>  Amazing animated, visually stunning, but they should have cared a bit more for the background human characters.<br>I didn't like the design of the German girl nor how the Slav one talked.<br>The story was basically a precure episode, everyone happy everyone ok, nothing say about that but it confirms my idea that Trigger shouldn't be originals, they are much better at adapting stuff.<br>My only real problem is that  and the German girl were presented as serious evil doers (thief, someone who sell technology) and yet they never did something bad or even shown those traits, they were nice girls. I get their young girls, everyone is friendly and happy, but shit, at least make them act like cunts for 5 minutes, show me they are bad, don't just tell me they are.</br></br></br>   here<br>Oh, and the first one was better.</br>  <br>Just because she stole something doesn't make her bad. Akko causes plenty of trouble but she isn't bad. I think the point was that they aren't bad just because they do things like that.</br>  I think they are fine animations but I really don't get the hype at all. I really can't get that excited over small episodes like this. If they made a full season or an actual feature length movie I'd care more.  The first one was better because it was new and fresh, but LWA 2 was still worth watching just for the animation alone. <br><br>Sadly if KlK and LWA are any indicator, Trigger can't seem to write a non-mediocre plot, but at least the characters are good.</br></br>  <br>It was basically a feature-length movie.</br>  <br>Being a thief is a serious crime, it's different from what Akko was doing. But in hindsight it was my fault, I should have realized they weren't serious when they put the Slav girl together with the other two when her crime was simply stealing food and it was shown in a comedy way.<br><br><br>I've been saying this from the first LWA, I honestly don't see what people see in this that made them throw money at a kickstarter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sucy x mushrooms, duh</br>  <br> Kill la Kill reference <br> TTGL reference <br>It made my day. LWA2&gt;LWA</br></br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill reference <br>where?</br></br>  <br>Thoroughly enjoyed it.<br>The animation wasn't as good as the first movie, but everything else about it was everything I could have hoped for honestly. <br><br>Trigger said they may or may not do a full blown series of LWA. That shit would be so dope, so I hope they do. <br>They'd be saving anime for the third time in the last 2 years.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really like Sucy's dance, it makes me think of a 1930s Disney short</br>  <br>mako light and gamagoori</br>  <br>you're reaching.</br>  <br>Both are almost in the same scene. The thing holding the shiny rod is Ryuuko's scissor. And tech girl uses her magic like a drill on the parade the same way Simon uses his to activate lagan</br>  <br>I can't help but feel like LWA quality will suffer in show format.</br>  <br>Of course it will, they wouldn't have the time and money, not to say with 13 episodes there would be a plot and Trigger are bad at that.</br>  <br>It was pretty good. Healthy-chan was best girl.</br>  <br>I still want them to prove that they can do a full length show and keep it together for the whole thing.</br>  <br> I would like to see characters learn from their mistakes <br>But they did do that.<br>Akko almost fucked up her friendships by being too over-zealous about something ultimately unnecesasary. however good-spirited.<br>By the end, she learned to treat her friends and their feelings with better care, and that it takes a lot more strength to face the dangers that they face than she could ever face on her own. <br><br>Being Idealistic is not a fault, and if you really think that, then i feel sorry for you.<br><br>And Diana is arguable the best and most developed character in this show. <br>In the first movie she unleashed a massive dragon, but immediately after she realized her mistake she went out of her way to try and fix it, even when she needed help from others.<br>Just because she holds herself and others to a Noble standard doesn't make her a bitch. She's capable, she's a prodigy, she obviously studies and works hard and is very responsible. She's really 1 of the only 3 people in this show I'd want as a waifu. (Sucy and Sensei are the other two)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have more OVA or movies. KLK was fun but awful in my opinion. Had to force myself to watch each episode.</br>  <br> , she learned to treat her friends and their feelings with better care <br>No. She didn't learn anything. Its Sucy and the other one who forgave her. Akko just went on doing everything alone.<br><br> And Diana is arguable the best and most developed character in this show.  <br>Maybe. But the show doesn't show it. Also, like the other anon said, she didn't even have to be in this episode. She was there just to be bitch to Akko.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does Diana still hate Akko though?</br>  <br> No. She didn't learn anything. Its Sucy and the other one who forgave her. Akko just went on doing everything alone. <br><br>Were you even watching? She had to do everything on her own because they were not there, she learned that she was being selfish. And her friends were able to accept her faults as well. They already knew she was sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>She wishes Akko was more consistent in being competent. She doesn't hate her, she just wants her to do better and not fuck around with magic as much as she usually does.</br>  <br>From what I watched she dislikes Akko for being magic secondary(like magic shows) and not being a Noble.</br>  <br>That's just her tsundere personality confusing you. She likes Akko, but she's harsh because she wants her to be a little bit more mature.</br>  <br>The first one was much better. Also wanted to punch Akko for most of the OVA.</br>  <br> wanted to punch Akko <br>This is another reason why I wouldn't watch a tv anime of LWA, I couldn't stand her for 13 episodes.</br></br>  <br><br>Rather flat.</br></br>  <br>Worse than I was expecting, glad it was on nyaa as soon as it was distributed.</br>  It was great!  Stumbled upon the first awhile ago, found out this one came out today from /co/ and so I decided to watch it.<br><br>I mean I don't really like anime movies or ovas or whatever but this one was nice. Lotte drama felt completely forced. Extra minor characters were fun but unneeded. The giant was not threatening at all considering all he did was shoot black magic lasers that did fuck all. The first half didn't flow very well because it was just a bunch of plot set-ups. We don't really see the characters grow out of what was set in the first LWA.<br><br>It was fun though. Like it was basically a cape movie to me in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  I want to cum inside Sucy.  <br> Lotte drama felt completely forced. <br>Don't worry about that stuff, the whole thing is a pisstake anyway.</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Sushi.</br>  <br>Well, obviously that comes first.</br>  <br>But it wasn't funny.</br>  <br><br>I hate Trigger now. I hope each member of the team dies in a painful accident.</br></br>  I enjoyed it so much that I had some flashbacks to my childhood and got minor ptsd realizing how innocent and not fucked up i was back then.  <br> You will never be Sucy's guinea pig </br>  <br>This makes me very sad. But what if I was someone else this would make me definitely be her guinea pig. All I have to do is transcend existence and put myself into another reality! That's it!</br>   01 <br>Wait this is a series now?

I showed some casual friends the first ED of GoPri and they didn't believe me when I said it was CG.</br>  <br>They can afford to put more budget into the CGI because it's stock footage they reuse every episode. If the whole show was in CGI it wouldn't be on the same level.<br><br>2D is still superior anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>shit</br>  <br>It was atsui.</br>  <br> showing your friends precure </br>  <br><br>As someone who also missed the live stream is the show down another villain ?</br></br>  <br>twilight is gone</br>  Happy 4th of July everybody. I hope you're enjoying the fireworks. It's too bad this lovely cat doesn't seem to enjoy her fireworks show. They do look kind of weird though, almost psychedelic. You didn't do anything bad, did you /pc/?  <br>I want to not salt-nagisa's licky eyebrows.</br>  GoPri subs when?  <br>This has to be one of the prettiest shots in GoPri so far.</br>  <br>Why is Twilight/Towa fanart so cute?</br>  <br>gap</br>  <br><br>Well I don't consider that a loss really. <br><br>I thought Shut or Lock were going to be taken out or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I finally looked up what that was. Now I understand.<br><br>Iona was the same way though and I don't remember her getting art/comics like this.</br></br></br>  Cutest Red.  <br>There are some big TVs in the an open area at school and I watch precure on those everyone knows I watch precure. I've even had some people come see it out of curiosity and they liked it.   Seems like my pic of me watching precure on those TVs is gone so no photo. <br><br>When I showed the ED to my friends was for my 3D modelling class was showing them what I wanted to accomplish for my project.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you live in some third world country? If you were in the US you'd become the school's rapemonkey.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  This week's action was definitely awesome, even if it wasn't visually ridiculous. That whole sequence with the out-of-stock attacks got me so hype. One echoed voice after another, feeling like they were really pulling out all the stops for it.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KNE<wbr>_aC0R5uU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>There was also less QUALITY than I would expect from an action-oriented episode. Toei seems to actually be trying to make up for HaCha.</br>  <br>I'm on her post-transform fight with Dyspear right now and it's nothing completely jawdropping but the whole sequence of her parrying the shadows was definitely cool.</br>  http://himado.in/279406  <br><br><br><br>Marry me, Towa!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  I figured Nao's spotlight episode would be about her family but I definitely wasn't expecting that to happen.  So is it likely they're going to un-corrupt someone else ?  Daww, geez. This is actually kind of cute, in a semi-suicidal kind of way. But then I suppose it's only a giant apple monster.  This shit is 2utsukushii4me.  <br><br>I love Japanese comments.</br></br>  <br>heh</br>  <br><br>So she got beat down by the Koolaid Man's cousin ?</br></br>  <br>That walk was way yasashiku</br>  Good gravy, they really ratcheted up the pain for March, didn't they. The others didn't go through anything nearly this agonizing.<br><br><br>Oh yeah!</br></br></br>  This makes the regular Precure Kick look pretty pathetic. She's not wall-to-wall superpowered or anything, but I guess she gets to have her badassed moment just like everyone else.  <br>I don't want to be edgy or anything, but Smile has some of the best despair moments in the franchise.</br>  I'm going to marry Haruharu!  <br>Oh hey I found them.</br>  I'm not sure this is a winning plan, but okay.<br><br><br>Oh yeah, Joker has largely been responsible for turning up the despair, but the leadup to midseason, his big evil episode (in that mirror world) and this were all pretty vicious.</br></br></br>   that crazy animation on cure scarlet's fight <br><br>Are the fights on this one like that all the time? Last PreCure I even tried to watch was Smile and it was awful. I watched the entirety of Fresh too and that left me with brain damage from how bad it was.</br></br>  <br><br>She looks oddly similar to Nui Harime from Kill La Kill at times.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say ALL the time, but pretty damn often.</br>  <br>I'm going to pafu Pafu's pafus!</br>  <br>GoPri has had the best fights of Precure</br>    The one who attracted more random viewers was Smile well before they remodeled the building with the new TVs so they watched from my laptop.<br><br>HaCha didn't do that well and I haven't had a chance to watch GoPri on those screens yet.</br></br>  <br><br>You don't watch Fresh for the animation.</br></br>  <br><br>Who is that ?</br></br>  <br><br>Our lord and savior.</br></br>  <br>FUCK<br><br><br>I was gonna ask if the generic monster fights were also that much exciting.<br><br>HOW THE FUCK IS THE ANIMATION SO GOOD?? Woah, I really feel like watching this. The thing with the other shows is that they barely even fought and just used their stock footage finishing move to one-hit everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't watch it for the animation, most certainly. It was just boring tbh, outside a few Cure Passion episodes. The monster of the week stuff on it was pretty bland, the villains where also not good. <br><br>I know "complaining about MOTW on precure" and all but HeartCatch was really fun.</br></br></br>  <br> HOW THE FUCK IS THE ANIMATION SO GOOD?? <br>They saved up budget from simple HaCha art and animation.</br></br>  <br> Smile! <br> awful <br>Shit taste detected.</br></br></br>  Isn't this just like Reika. Her episode, but everyone else gets upset, mindbroken, beat up and embarrassed.<br><br>I'm just kidding, of course, he's being plenty mean to her. But they definitely worked hard at playing up this psychological angle with Joker, some times are definitely better than others though.<br><br><br>Par for the course is good, there have only been a few truly unremarkable fights. But as you can probably see, when it's good, it's really, really good.<br><br><br>You watch it for the boobies?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I know "complaining about MOTW on precure" and all but HeartCatch was really fun. <br>I'll never get you people. HC had more victim of the week filler shit than any other Precure.</br></br>    <br>For the humor, story, characters, villains, and everything else.</br>  <br>The thing is that HC did it right. It was just a better show overall. The characters where all very interesting and had more unique personalities so watching them in all kinds of situations was fun. Heck, you had a girl who dresses like a boy on that. Fresh for example was extremely boring, everything on it was cliche.</br>      <br>I feel like the artstyle has a big part in why everyone sees it like that.</br>  <br>So just to give you an idea, this is the prettiest shot from an otherwise pretty typical episode. The fighting isn't always over the top, it's often quite simple, but they've done a good job of sexing up little moments. I'd say there's a webm-worthy shot like this in about half of the episodes, maybe slightly more.<br><br>The truly amazing sequences come from more important episodes. That motw looking one was the premier, the 3-on-1 was the introduction of that villain, and today was the end of the midseason climax.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So let me get this straight they're being menaced by a Death Note reject, Wallace and the thin version of Porky Minch who all summon the Koolaid Man's extended family as familiars to do their bidding ?</br></br>  <br> erika <br> itsuki <br> yuri <br> interesting </br></br></br></br>  <br> just because I don't like it, it means it's shit <br>When you can get people that usually dislike magical grl anime since they're "all the same" to watch HC and enjoy it, you know it's something special.<br><br>There's a lot of stuff in there that breaks conventions.</br></br></br></br>  This is such a distinctive style for the close-ups, with the big thick outlines (just like the earlier shot with Happy) and it seems to come up very rarely, but I remember seeing it once or twice in Suite as well. Is that the trademark of a particular director or animator or something?<br><br><br>Did we mention this was a kid's show?</br></br></br>  <br>Aside from the animation GoPri's fight choreography has been really neat too, they do a lot of little teamwork moments in most fights.</br>  <br>Anyone has the full version of this Minamin fight?</br>  <br><br><br>This is really unbelieavable. Like I can't believe it's Toei doing this, what the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Did we mention this was a kid's show? <br><br>Oh I Know that. <br><br>But I heard someone recommend the show because their antics can be extremely funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She actually holds her skirt for a few frames <br><br>They didn't even need to do that but they did anyway. This is quite something.</br></br></br>  <br> you had a girl who dresses like a boy <br><br> fuck off with your tumblr bullshit</br></br></br>  <br>That's adorable, head canon established</br>  <br> Fresh <br> Boring <br>Clearly you don't belong here.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off retard.</br>  Wow, she even got an insert song. Or did I just not notice the ones in the other spotlights? One way or the other, this whole fight was awesome and incredibly long... I clipped her dramatic transformation, the pre-fight and her finisher in favour of just the meaty parts but the whole thing is probably close to 5-6 minutes long. They really like her, don't they.<br><br><br>Heh, this is one of the fights I purposely never webm'ed because the way her tumbling looked bothered me so much. If you absolutely must have it, though, I can go back later and do it.<br><br><br>Smile in particular? This season's villains are pretty fun, actually. The three generals are goofy and fun in their own ways, and Joker provides the sombre, darker side. Kind of like Yes!5, only a little better, I'd say. It's not every year that the villains are quite this amusing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck off retard. <br><br> uh-oh so edgy</br></br></br>  <br>A girl who dresses like a boy. On a show made for little girls, you know, where the characters are supposed to be role models for them.<br><br>This is taking risks into actually making a character, not just for the franchise's sake. At that point you're making the show you want to make, not the one the company wants you to.<br><br><br>I'm not a 4 year old girl, so I need more than dumb girls eating pretzels to keep me entertained.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're looking at cherry-picked scenes. While GoPri is above average (for now), you pretty much do this for every other season and have the same effect.</br>  <br>Amen to that. We're never getting despair faces like that again.</br>  <br> wearing pants makes you less of a role model </br>  <br>I certainly wouldn't be able to do that for Fresh, it looks like shit all across the board.</br>  <br> leave for having a different opinion </br>  <br>I remember the full webm being poster before and I thought I had saved it but apparently not.<br><br><br> I'm not a 4 year old girl <br>Then why the hell are you watching a series for little girls? You can't enjoy precure without at least being a little girl at heart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's right though, Fresh is a masterpiece.</br>  <br> being a little girl at heart. <br>My sides.</br></br>   Kanata no longer in the OP   <br><br>I find the one Lock who is playing video games all the time is funny. <br><br>It seems like he does not take his job seriously at times or does not care one way or another if they're winning.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Here's the full version.</br>  <br>We're all little girls here. Please stay out of the theater during normal hours, creepy Oji-san.</br>  I realize he's desperate, but Wolfrun took a very sudden turn to angryville.<br><br><br>Donuts, actually.<br><br><br>Agreed. I'd probably just show that stupid waterpark ride shot over and over. Or the hair monster. There are a couple of general fights that are better than average, but they wouldn't wow the way the best of HC or FW would do, that's for sure.<br><br><br>Eh whoops, I think I only said "this season" because Smile is what I'm watching now. GoPri's generals are... odder. Some people like them, but I think Close was the only one I really liked. Because he was brash and funny... and had an accent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    See? Even she noticed. Maybe she'll redeem him and they can have curepuppies together.  <br><br>Are those the "I saw what was coming at E3 this year" faces ?</br></br>  I just realized I spent the entire 4th of July watching children's cartoons on the internet.  <br>Rejoice, for you have fulfilled your destiny.</br>    <br>Oh shit he wasn't, Close is still there though.<br><br>When do they usually switch OPs?</br></br></br>  <br>never</br>  <br>They don't.</br>  I'm wondering, how does his sight work exactly ? <br><br>And if you cover the eyes on his hood would he be totally blind ?</br></br>  <br><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</br></br>  I'm surprised that Happy's bit wasn't anything special compared to the other four, though that's not to say it wasn't pretty at all.<br><br>On a completely unrelated note, I need to decide what to watch next. Figure it's probably between Splash Star, GoGo or Doki.<br><br><br>Yeah no, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I'm a little nauseous myself now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My gosh. Towa is amazing.</br>  <br><br>That's Itaoka's work. Ever since he started working on the series in Smile, he's been Toei's go-to guy for Precure. That role used to belong to Shida but now he's too busy being whore'd out by the rest of the studio's projects.</br></br>  <br>That episode gave me serious goosebumps<br>It caught me completely off guard</br></br>  <br>This, oh my god, this.<br>So fucking amazing. This is a true princess elegant mode.</br></br>  <br>Happy with a serious expression makes my heart go  dokidoki </br>  <br><br> Yeah no, sorry, I shouldn't have said that. I'm a little nauseous myself now. <br><br>It's okay. Wolfrun is known for doing things to people who aren't even furfags. Kinda like how Wester does things to people who aren't even gay.</br></br></br></br>   tfw eating pleb food   <br>Ah, awesome thanks. It's strange to see it cropping up here and there, particularly when it clashes with the art style they've been using.<br><br><br>Wait, Westar is a man?!</br></br></br></br>  <br> that cleavage window  <br><br>How unPrecure.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the red Precure deserves.</br>  <br>A shitty rehash? Makes sense.</br>    <br>F L A T</br>  <br>Any progress between these two?</br>  <br>I can't wait to see Scarlet included in the group roll call, I wonder what her line is going to be.</br>  Has any recent Precure come close to being as good as Heartcatch yet?  <br>No.</br>  <br>perflat?</br>      GoPri makes me feel like Heartcatch again. Everyone says it good but it just bores me to tears, like W.  <br> I wonder what her line is going to be <br><br>Iroppoi.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop watching then, it's that simple.</br>  I want to lick that back.   真紅の炎のプリンセス！ <br><br><br>I'm holding out for "atsuku" but that's not very exciting. I had no idea that "tsuyoku yasashiku utsukushiku" was actually a figure of speech.</br></br></br>   judging Cures by their leaked art <br><br>When will you learn?</br></br>  <br><br>That fight wasn't done by Itaoka, it was someone else. It's been almost four years and we still don't know who it was.</br></br>  Do we know if Scarlet is going to have multiple Mode Elegant forms like the others?<br><br>I'm not completely sure, but it looked like she used all her current keys for different things this episode, one to henshin, one to Mode Elegant, and one for the violin.</br></br>  <br>I love how her hair moves in this.</br>  <br> she kept Twilight's ears and eye make up </br>  <br>Her design is still shitty even outside the art though.</br>  <br>Oh, okay. I suppose that's Precure's best kept secret or something. I'll have to look a little more carefully for the scenes where that thick-lined style stood out for me, that was the only one that I could remember.</br>   summer Kirara in the PV <br><br>THE TIME HAS COME AND SO HAVE I</br></br>  <br>Haru2 and Yui look like Tamagotchis or something.</br>  <br> Kirara's navel is visible. <br>Unprecure!</br></br>  <br>I love these new outfits. Yui and Kirara look cute as fug.</br>  Man, I really hate this scene.<br><br>Other than Close mocking her in the beginning. I had forgotten about that and it totally made my day.</br></br>  I liked the new BGMs in this episode, but it seemed like the volume was a little too low.  This is not the sexual organ  <br>They were in the toy leaks<br> Mode Elegant Sun, Phoenix and Hanabi </br></br>  I honestly believe Kirara's new outfit is 2lewd4precure.<br>This is basically what slutty girls wear to give all the boys a boner  and it's working </br>  <br>I wonder how sensitive Towa's glans are.</br>  <br> she sees this year's comiket's Precure doujin lineup </br>    <br>I have a feeling Haruharu isn't all that hard to please sexually.</br>  <br>I bet holding hand would make her Suteki Sugiru in seconds.</br>    <br>Kettei~!</br>  <br>At least she is wearing panties? I went to a shitty poor school and a few of the girls dressed that way in skirts with no panties.</br>  <br>GoPri once again proven to be a better anniversary season than HaCha.</br>  Minamean looks troubled.  <br><br>What is with this show and doughnuts ? <br><br>That's one of the things I noticed it promotes harder than friendship at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Great another bitch to steal the spotlight <br> That uniform is outrageous <br> Why am I the only one whoring my navel out  <br> I have no breasts </br></br></br></br>  <br> I have no breasts </br>    <br>they sell them</br>    <br><br><br>So this is a truth then ?</br></br></br>  <br/>  Goodnight /pc/<br><br>Tomorrow I have to visit a theater.</br></br>  <br>What's goin' on here?</br>  <br><br>Apparently they are envious of how well endowed the yellow one is.</br></br>  <br> The thing with the other shows is that they barely even fought and just used their stock footage finishing move to one-hit everything. <br>Compared to Smile, sure. But you said you watched Fresh, and Fresh had pretty much the same ratio of fisticuffs to stock footage that GoPri has. Of course GoPri looks much, much better, but as far as ratio goes, it's pretty much the same. Don't expect long fights every episode.<br>Also purely animation-wise, Smile wasn't bad at all, especially during the climax and the the ending stretch.<br>That said, I do think GoPri has the overall best fights in the franchise, and I hated Smile overall, so I'm definitely not arguing about the shows themselves being good/bad.</br></br></br></br>  So shes just walked in on you playing video games and wants to know more. <br><br>What do you tell her ?</br></br>  <br>Tell her that my favorite game series will never have a crossover with Precure.  ;_; </br>  <br><br>To be honest I'm surprised there is no "Super Robt Wars" type game for Magical Girls involving Precure and the dozen other Magical Girl franchises out there.</br></br>  <br>Seriously this needs to be done. And not with fake voice actors and like 10 characters. How difficult can it be? It would surely sell like hotcakes the more stuff you pack in it.</br>  So how tall is Towa, is Haruharu still the shortest GoPri?  <br>There's this<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AYb<wbr>mZGXiO7k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> No Nanoha <br> No Madoka <br>Do they actively hate money? Not that it isn't missing lots of others mahou shoujo, but those should be the first to include just to secure the sales.<br> Sonico made it in <br>Fuck Sonico and fuck Nitroplus for trainwrecking their own company.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Fuck Sonico and fuck Nitroplus for trainwrecking their own company. <br><br>What ? <br><br>What happened, I am not familiar with that franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if Towa is actually Yandere and discovered the love-love act between Haru-haru and his Kanata onii-sama?  <br>They went from being a solid eroge company which churned out quite a few good/great games for years to pushing their mascot into relevancy for no apparent reason, literally creating tons of merchandize, games and even managed to get her an anime even though the character itself has nothing to do with anything the company had ever done before, and it's objectively shit. They haven't released an original full-scale eroge that isn't Sonico since 2010. The increase in popularity (people just buying the mascot-related stuff because it's cute, most don't even know what kind of character she is or what is Nitroplus) meant they had to stop doing the stuff they did before and went full "family friendly".<br>They will finally release a new eroge near the end of 2015/beginning 2016, I guess the Sonico popularity wave is dwindling, but still Sonico effectively ruined this company for good.</br></br>  <br> his Kanata onii-sama? <br>Towa violates Haruharu with his princess penis.</br></br>  <br>Sonico is Nitroplus mascot?<br><br>I thought she was a Vocaloid or something.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I...don't know if I like this or her Twilight form better. Not even Eas/Setsuna had me this conflicted.</br></br>  <br>Can't blame you for that. She fits her company as Funassyi fits precure. At first she was an ironic moeblob looking character representing a grimdark chuuni company, but then it became a real thing.</br>  <br>I'm not sure I understand your post. Is that at your workplace?</br>  <br><br><br>It'd be interesting if they did a game like that and added Black Rock Shooter as a fringe character. <br><br>I've heard she and her friends are considered Magical Girls but I am unsure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That is a lovely rock on your desk.</br></br>  <br>Looks like waxed paper to me.</br>  Happy birthday, anons!

I can live with that.</br></br>  Sure sure, but is this really their final form?<br><br>All kidding aside, I was really looking forward to the final 1v1 matchups. If it's going to end with a big group fight, here's hoping it's a crazy one.</br></br>  <br>Well, not their final form.

But this probably isn't their final form either, is it.<br><br><br>Ha! Well this episodes has had a few QUALITY moments so far, but yeah, there's nothing in particular that screams awful ending just yet. In fact, if anything there's a giant hype train for MegaPierrot's big reveal and him hopefully finally doing something. That's probably not helping their case if the ending is going to be that disappointing, though.</br></br></br></br>  Oh christ, it's Ultimate Mugen Happy.  <br>The final form of that aquarium guy in Futari Wa Precure was hilarious</br>  Every time someone gets to the end of a Smile watch  I always start to feel a bit sad and wait for the disappointment.

If there's a chance it's going to be completely awful, fair warning is generally okay. I suppose some people would like to be able to go in with a completely open mind but I'm not sure hearing all this is going to dramatically reduce my enjoyment of this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show would've been a lot shorter if he had just done this 40 episodes ago. Toy sales aside, I'm not sure why he didn't.<br><br><br>Yeah, it generally seems to be pretty rage inducing. I totally understand. Stumbled on this gem a second ago, for instance <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;121617028 </br></br></br>  <br> God, I hope Doki is a lot more enjoyable than this. No matter how much /pc/ rips on it, it absolutely can't be worse than Smile. <br>Hah. Smile was great though, really.</br></br>  So how have the Go Princess ratings been doing so far?

Well then. I suppose that's one way to avoid the big JokerxBeauty finish. And I was so looking forward to that.<br><br><br>Ohh, okay. Well then, on your way then.</br></br></br>  Well that was unexpectedly neat. The first might've made more sense in Nao &amp; Akane's rivalry episode but fine.   &gt;beamspam destroys his physical form and army<br> promptly generates black hole to swallow earth </br> <br>I didn't mention this earlier, but Smile really is the most arms race-y of all the series I've seen so far. Every power-up on each side seems to be in direct response to the other getting a new weapon.<br><br>And I guess this is where it leaves us.</br></br></br>  wut  <br><br>It's okay, everyone's fine.</br></br>  Oh my goodness there's a lot of crying in this episode. Crying because they're losing, crying because they love each other, crying while attacking. I can't wait for them to win and cry some more.<br><br><br>Yeah, I love how they're looking up at a huge chunk of the earth floating away surrounded in flames but they're just scratched up.</br></br></br>  Oh for gods sakes, I was JOKING.<br><br>Damn you, Smile.</br></br>  <br><br>CRY CRY CRY CRY CRY<br><br>PURIKYUA</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I was JOKING <br><br>We told you, dog. We told you about crying.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This guy was right<br><br>I liked the finale.<br>But That last episode sucks ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  God that was agonizing. It's not that it didn't make sense or anything, but I'm not sure how all that crying is supposed to be the fun/satisfying conclusion to this whole story.<br><br>I actually enjoyed the series as a whole, though. It was so consistently well-drawn, which is incredibly refreshing. I imagine how well done the characters is up for debate, I've heard people going violently both ways, but I think they did an excellent job of showing you who they all were, even if they didn't change much throughout the year (other than Yayoi). The villain suite was definitely better than usual, aside from Pierrot, who was even more disconnected than the usual end bosses; he might as well have been Satan, for all that it mattered. I still feel like this is what Yes!5 would've been with all its wrinkles ironed out (particularly the animation and bitchy drama), though things like the spotlights were just super well handled in Smile.<br><br>So I guess the year's theme really was friendship, even more so than most years? They all went to bat for each other over and over and got to be incredibly close, though they're all so different that they felt a bit crammed together. But at least they seemed like genuine friends, the same way Fresh was, if only a bit of a younger feel. They always got through it together, and the true hope for their future was each other. I know that's every year, but other series' themes come up every time as well.<br><br><br>Yeaaaah, that about sums it up.<br><br><br>To be honest, I had totally forgotten but once the crying first started I did get that nagging feeling it wasn't ever going to stop. Now I know why.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're crying because they used up all their budget and couldn't afford a real finale.</br>  Pro wrestling? What the hell am I in for this episode.  <br>Good thing you liked the series , personally I think it had like some god-tier episodes, while the rest were okay and a terrible finale.<br>Still, it is one of the more funny seasons with Fresh and Suite.<br>Also, it is funny that your mayor complain is crying, because that is the thing that pissed most people along with candy.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that why they had to reuse the Allstars DX3 finale, beat for emotional beat?</br>  last 4 or 5 episodes of Smile to watch at work tonight.  <br>Candy actually didn't bother me all that much, not because it was an awesome idea, though. It felt really asspully and just generally poorly set up, and Candy isn't exactly someone I wanted to see take up more place.<br><br>The crying is only bothersome because there wasn't much else going on. There were no big revelations, no important turning points, nothing that hadn't really been said before, just lots and lots of crying. It just kind of gets old after a while, and contrast with the character that cries once after many moments where they "should've", where that breakdown becomes the pivotal moment. It's all good, it's not like it wasn't sad for them, or that it was exaggerated, but it wasn't really much of a ride, just a long, low straightaway. I suppose that's my real issue with it.<br><br><br>Godspeed. Let us know what you thought.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By Candy he meant  "that's a little implausible" and her coming back for no reason at the end, basically spitting on the little semblance of finality or consequence it could have had. </br>  <br>Oh, at the very, very end? Yeah, that's total crap, I guess I just don't find it unexpected is all.  No one ever stays gone.   Except for Cologne. </br>   Nooo! Unhand me!

You're gonna watch this shit like the rest of us</br>    I want Hanazawa Kana to shout at me more.  <br>Mah nigga<br>You and I, Anon</br></br>  <br>Then you should probably kill yourself<br><br>The voice does not fit Hana</br></br></br>  <br>Your dick doesn't fit Hana.</br>  Chiyo CM when?  <br>It's kanazawa hana, nerd</br>  animation look like shit  <br>God the art looks terrible<br><br>Dropped</br></br></br>  <br>Something's off here. But I do love me some Hana. Waterworks when?</br>  <br> Chiyo CM when? <br>tomorrow<br><br><br> The voice does not fit Hana <br>i think too, but they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' in one sentence.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I love Kanahana and think she would fit the roll better if she wasn't making her voice sound like nadeko. I was really excited for the mad hana scenes because i love kanahana's angry voice. The art looks good, its probably the best they could do given the manga art being on par with Onepunch Man in terms of beauty. I still have faith for the adaption being enjoyable but i know it wont compare with the anime; as long as the anime spawns new hentai Ill be happy.  <br>She was good in AgK as a batshit insane cyborg.</br>  <br>Compare with the manga* too early for me to be making coherent sentences.</br>  I kinda wish this was 3D instead. Sidonia looks good and JC staff never draws nipples. So shokugeki flopped.  <br>It will spawn porn, which will be the only good thing the anime ends up doing</br>  all these niwakashitters mad about their niwaka manga series being adapted not to their liking, fuckin comedy :)  I cant help but to keep image hanazawa peeing in my face.  <br>It's not such a bad image.</br>  <br>She... doesn't look like Hana.</br>  <br>I was kinda hoping differently, but that doesn't make any sense unless they are forcing the company to censor it? Yet, of the license agreement is with distributor/company there's no reason to give Funi a censored copy to broadcast.<br><br>Hell, Funi could even advertise having the uncensored one to entice more customers. If the show is, genuinely, good people will buy it anyways.</br></br></br>  <br>The reference design looks like her early chapter appearance but the artists couldn't remotely match that with how low the budget must be, ontop of not being able to animate this to any degree. Might aswell be Inferno Cop tier shit</br>  <br> Sidonia looks good <br> liking low framerate ugly CGshit <br><br>Opinion discarded.</br></br></br></br>  Kanahana sounds too far from what I had in mind. Lately anime adaptations are killing enjoyment from manga for me. I'm giving it 5 minutes max. Skipped SnS, probably gonna skip this too.  <br> that voice <br>Glad she isn't my favorite character anyway.</br></br>  <br>Cause all these cocksuckers want the plot spoon fed to them.</br>  <br>Lets be honest, noone's art work will do this man any justice.<br>I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either<br><br><br> hana kana has done only one lewd role(Tokyo Ghoul)  <br>FML<br><br>Hopefully Chaos Dragon delivers with lewd seiyuus. I need sex in my ears</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   JC Staff <br><br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br>  <br> hana <br> hanakana <br><br>Japanese humour knows no boundaries!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kiyoshi <br> Hiroshi <br><br>Sasuga</br></br></br></br>  she looks fine<br><br>you niggers whine too much</br></br>  So that's how you choose a V.A. for your anime these days!  <br> &gt;/out/ </br>  jesus fuck that voice.. kill me pls  <br>Of course not anon she isnt real</br>  I remember a lot of people wanting Hanakana as Hana long before the anime was anounced.<br><br>Now nobody wants her.</br></br>  I like HanaKana but that moe voice don't suit Hana at all!!<br><br>I imagined her voice would be deeper tho.</br></br>  <br>I absolutely love it, first she sounds sweet and fluffy, then she sounds scary.<br>Is this gap-moe?</br></br>  Doesn't look that bad  <br> first she sounds sweet and fluffy, then she sounds scary. <br>That's how it was supposed to be but it sounds too forced here. I really liked Nadeko's batshit insane voice, but apparently she forgot how to act since then.</br></br>  <br>Because she, along with everyone that likes her, is an insufferable autist.</br>  <br>He also can do the edgemaster Izaya\Levi voice.</br>  <br>VA is shit. Goddamn, it doesn't fit her at all.</br>  I can see the problem that everyone is having here as it's a bit off putting, but I imagine that, after a bit, we'll get used to it.  JC staff , please learn to lip synch. That shit is cringeworthy.  <br>SONANOKA OHOHAHAHAHA~</br>  <br>That's how she's supposed to sound. She acts like a nice girl at first.<br><br>People who say HanaKana's voice is unfitting have no idea what they're talking about. It sounds fucking perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>It sounds like shit.</br>  <br>This.Her insane rage voice &gt; her moe shit.</br>  <br>It's better animated than I expected. Hope it stays like that while airing.</br>  why does she have boobs  <br>is this from those digital magazine?</br>  Meh.<br>I like Hana Kana but I don't think her voice fits for this role.</br>  Meh, I'm not feeling it. I like HanaKana, but it's not exactly the voice I had in mind for Hana.  <br>HAI HAI HAI DICKITAL MAGAJIN DA YOO NEEEE~</br>  <br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br>  <br>Just a bro who obviously has good taste.</br>  <br> posts 9 seconds apart <br> samefag </br></br>  <br> 11:28:27 <br> 11:28:36 </br></br>  <br> Hana Kana has done only one lewd role <br> What is Neptunia and Iris Heart? </br></br>  <br>Why is the art so bad? Also her voice doesn't fit. This is going to be a disaster.</br>  <br> JC staff never draws nipples <br>You need to watch more JC staff anime if you think that. I bet you think they never draw toddlers in bondage too.</br></br>  <br>I think the problem is with the color palette. I don't know, it just feels off. Everything else actually looks OK.<br>I also find it amusing how everyone was saying HanaKana was perfect for this role, now we have plenty of people who don't agree.</br></br>  Dropped  <br><br>Oh wow</br></br>  <br><br>newfag</br></br>  <br>So cool onee-saaaan droppinga a show is soooo manlyyy</br>  <br><br> hanazawa voice didnt give you a boner </br></br>  <br> Nine fucking seconds <br> Samefagging </br></br>  <br>Better luck next time, kid.</br>  <br>The art looks good to me. I mean, it's impossible for animation to be faithful to such high quality manga art, but they got close enough.</br>  <br>Is Kate getting animated?</br>  <br>Not unless there a season 2. God i hope not.</br>  <br>no, they couldve done an ova covering certain chapters. The good chapters of course, but the japs chose quantity over quality</br>  She sounds too much like Mayuri and her angry voice isn't as good as her angry Nadeko.<br><br>Kinda disappointing.</br></br>  I guess because the manga is black and white but I feel everything looks a little too bright.  <br><br>Tuturu~ <br>Hanachan-desu~<br>Okarin~ did you get my metal umpa?</br></br></br></br>  <br>An OVA wouldn't necessarily have better art.</br>  <br>It's JC staff. They try to be faithful,but their adaptations are mediocre. The animation is subpar and the anime will have shit pacing. Don't expect it to reach the prison break out.</br>  <br>where the hell would it even end?</br>  Meh. Not a fan of hanakana for this role tbh.  <br> I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either <br>Like you even need to worry about that.</br></br>  <br>I'll screen cap this for laughs when PS anime reach break out arc</br>  <br>Tuturu, motherfucker.</br>  <br>Anon, 540p is your friend</br>  <br>1080p!!!!60fps</br>   that blazer shading <br><br>They should fire the coloring staff, it looks like it was a baby's first time shading using photoshop.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's the shading that makes this look off. Should have just painted shit black.</br>   Mari PV...maybe 40 posts <br> Meiko PV...no more than 30 posts <br> Hana PV...already 130+ posts <br><br>Is it because of Hana's voice or is it because it's Hana? Is this going to be a case of everyone just bitching about the anime in these threads, because too many people read the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>People love Hana, Vice-Prez was pretty meh in the entire manga. Mari and Chiyo are more liked than her, even Risa might be more liked here than Meiko. <br>The complaining in any adaption thread always comes from people who want to see something they like done well, not done terribly. <br><br>I felt the same way for Sidonia no Kishi being ugly as fuck 3DCG.</br></br></br></br>  My god, JC staff made Hana look like the bland bitch from bakuman, but blonde.  <br>fucking disgusting</br>  Holy fuck this show looks ugly. Might actually drop it.<br>Snakefags will love angry Kanahana though and she seems to pull it off pretty well.</br>  <br> They try to be faithful,but their adaptations are mediocre <br>What the fuck are you smoking?</br></br>  <br> Watching Bakuman. </br>  <br>voice doesn't fit at all</br>  the show would be better if it was adapted by shaft or deen  <br>Are you high? Meiko was the cover and face of promotional material for the series before Hana's popularity soared.</br>  Hana doesn't deserve this much of love from /a/  <br>Hana's shit. Praise Mari, Chiyo and Meiko. cough</br>    <br>Talking about here, and Hana was always more liked than Vice-Prez.</br>  <br> the show would be better if it was adapted by (...) deen </br>  <br>the voice isn't in sync.......</br>  <br>Oh you.</br>  <br>The lines said are separate from the images shown, they are never in sync because they aren't from the same scene.</br>  I think it fits her initial appearance when the boys thought she was nice and cute before she started killing them. But I can't imagine hana sounding like that after that, especially with the more recent chapters.  <br>only for disgusting tsunderefags<br>the only time hana was even a little likeable is when she cried because kiyoshi wouldn't ourboros with her</br></br>  Meiko is horribly underrated on /a/.  <br>which makes no sense, she's the only usc who seems to be have the potential to become loyal and caring wife</br>  <br>Whats the name of that pv music?</br>  <br>Snore.</br>  <br>Even if we accept your point, snore &gt; kicked in the face.<br>For the same reason that 0 &gt; -15</br></br>  <br>It's the OP of the show</br>  <br>Yes because sweating cows are disgusting.</br>  <br>If we accept your point, since Chiyo is the most peaceful girl in the series, Chiyo &gt; Meiko.</br>  <br>If we judge girls based on their worst possible chiyo &gt; meiko<br>If we judge girls based on their best possible meiko &gt; chiyo<br>In both cases chiyo&gt;hana and meiko&gt;hana.<br>Hana a shit.<br>Only mari is worse than her and that's not saying much.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With shows like this you always run into the problem that the porn tends to be boring.</br>  Are they even trying? The voice acting is so exaggerated it makes me cringe. <br><br>When she's nice, she sounds 5 octaves too high and when she's mad she's 5 too low along with the stupid guttural tone. Anime itself is generally an exaggerated fantasy, but this is a bit much.</br></br>  <br> they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' <br>Chiwa Saito is always there.</br></br>  <br>Chiwa Saito wouldn't have fit Hana. Besides HanaKana (which works, you fags are too whiney) I can only see Ayane Sakura or Aoi Yuuki working for her.</br>  <br>Somebody needs to go back to Logic 101. I've been told that won't cover achieving a refined taste, but maybe you'll learn something in the road.</br>  <br>Out of curiosity, with which of the 4 lines, -exclude the hana a shit one- do you want to try to disagree with?</br>  <br><br>What makes HIramoto's art distinctive is his attention to shadows and shading. <br><br>All of today's anime are done digitially so it is nearly impossible to do shading and shadows unless it is physically painted and shaded for specific shots in like pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was always liked tard. Clearly you forget the hand holding scene.</br>  <br> hana kana has done only one lewd role(Tokyo Ghoul)  <br>That and binbougami. Rize y Sakura the best for me the rest it's a big meh</br></br>  <br> she was always liked <br>yes. <br>by tsunderefags.</br></br></br>  <br>And the kiss scene, and literally every scene shes in. People love unresolved sexual tension, hana and the MC are the only ones with ridiculous amounts of it.</br>  <br> I'm not even sure if I want Devil's Blues to be animated either <br>You don't. You really, really don't.</br></br>  <br> People like a character i don't. I better start shitposting their threads! </br>  Tuturu!  <br>I hate tsundere but like Hana. What now, faggot?</br>  <br>Not fond of tsundere but hana is great. You can eat shit.</br>  <br>ughhh.. too cutesy default voice</br>  Yuu Kobayashi would have been great.  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>She's not in enough things. <br><br><br>I think Hana is one of the better female characters in the story and it has nothing to do with her being an tsundere, at all. She's really unique.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is though.</br>  <br> not omigawa chiaki <br>shit<br><br> all that QUALITY <br>dropped</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it isn't, PS is unique</br>  <br>Her VA sucks balls</br>   artwork is shit  <br>Its the same artwork as the first chapters of the manga. However, PS manga artwork does progressively get better quality.<br><br> Voice is shit <br>Really? You should just drop it and move on, <br> Shitposting <br>Fucking Christ. In Every damn thread</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you defending it so hard?</br>  I figured HanaKana would be better suited Chiyo  <br> for Chiyo </br>  <br>I thought I was being neutral<br>I have a request<br>Can you compare the PV and Manga in the same scene where Hana introduced herself. I really like to see the comparison<br>Im on my phone, so I can't do shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sir, Would you kindly...... EAT SHIT</br>  Am I the only one thinking the viz prez tits are too FUCKING big? <br>They look awesomely glorious in the manga, here they are gargantuan air balloons, they break her form and aren't remotely attractive.</br>  <br>What the fuck is this<br><br>Hana is not this big<br><br>Why</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is true with all anime adaptations.</br>  I don't really think the angry voice HanaKana does fits her too much, we will just have to wait and see  <br>Where the fuck are you when Meiko's PV was released?</br>  <br> tfw she has the least likes </br>  <br>The anime made her look ridiculous</br>  <br> First musume <br> Now this <br><br>What else is poor anime going to ruin?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Though I really liked her voice.<br> Mari was also spot on. </br></br>  <br>Is that HanaKana?</br>  <br>You can't do any shading at all digitally?</br>  <br>Yes, it's the Psycho Pass chick</br>  <br>and mainstream</br>  <br>I dont get why people say this is poorly animated? That kick looked great. Are you all just finding something to complain about?</br>  <br>The art style. Can't ever expect it to look like the mangaka's work, but it's way too bland compared to it.</br>  <br>[url]https://<span>youtu.be/KE9WCa6MFk0[/<wbr>url]</wbr>  [ ] Meiko</br>  <br> [url] </br>  <br>That spit.<br>I'm not a Meiko fan but damn, that was hot as fuck.</br></br>  <br> let's make her boobs bigger than her head <br> the nerds will love that <br><br>Who the fuck thought it was a good idea?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's anti-fanservice, her boobs are way too big and she sweats so much no matter what she does she never looks particularly attractive, compared to the rest of the cast.<br>Unless you have those specific fetishes.</br></br>  <br><br>Those out-shape lard bags are ridicolous, they don't even look like fake assess...<br>Also, the "IT'S HER FUCKING NIPPLE" scene is going to look atrocious instead of boner inducing because of that.</br></br></br>  I don't think they could've picked a worse cast for this.  <br> She's anti-fanservice, her boobs are way too big and she sweats so much no matter what she does she never looks particularly attractive, compared to the rest of the cast. <br>You saying you didn't want to lick the sweat running along her inner thigh, following its trail all the way up to her drenched cunt?</br></br>  <br>It's the anime that sucks design-wise, in the manga she's a sex bomb.<br> On a side note... u gay, nigga? </br></br>  <br>Fuck, I thought her voice would have been better, it's shit though.</br>  Can't wait to hear Kamiya cookie cutter voice and ruin this show even more.  <br>don't know how this works, so I put it like this</br>  <br>The fuck are those cowtits?</br>   HanaKana fans will defend this   <br>Your new is showing, go back to lurking.</br>  <br>Maybe you're the faggot.</br>  <br><br>Yeah that was silly to say, any effect/shading can be achieved nowadays, that stuff simply isn't in vogue.</br></br>  <br> [url] </br>  <br> they probably needed someone who could switch from 'nice moe girl' to 'gonna kick your fucking ass' in one sentence <br>So every seiyuu with actual talent?<br>Fucking burgers knowing shit about dubbing as usual.</br></br></br>  I havent read Prison School in what feels like forever<br><br>Which chapter is the one where the President says "No one has so much as put a finger inside me" ?</br></br>  <br>yeah, url... <br>I just said a while ago</br></br>  <br>I've tried to find what the fuck niwaka means for some time now without any success.</br>  <br>Who knows, It's probably around chapter 100 or even later.

Look at their economy. Almost two decades of neverending recession, but as long as they don't starve...</br></br></br>  <br> Getting news from blogs <br> To shitpost on /a/ </br></br>  <br>This WAS partly true for video game industry. Not anymore really aside from mobile platforms. Industry needs specialists nowadays and not enthusiasts.<br><br>With animation, less and less people get into it since its litteral slavery - at begining you get barely paid at all and worked to death, and then still worked to death to just be able to buy food.<br><br>There simply is not enougth animators willing to work on those conditions in industry - even the young talented ones rather still work on video games and or porn than that.<br><br>So there are two options<br>1) Animation outsources almost completely to poor countries (partially true now).<br>2) CGI - inevitable trend already happening</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There is literally nothing wrong with yaraon.</br></br>  BASED KYOANI<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>K<br>Y<br>O<br>A<br>N<br>I</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Shirobako propaganda didn't work huh?</br>  <br> shows that CG is inevitable and makes a lot more money <br><br>Nice propaganda.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked insofar as it made a killing, which was its job. <br><br>Seems like something is always about to kill the industry. If it's not the "Unfeasible" business model based on bd sales, overworked animators, or what it'll be something else we'll be worrying about mean while they're still making stuff as they always have.</br></br></br>  <br> CGI <br>Maybe it won't be so terrible in the future? I hate CGI, but I've seen some cute vocaloid dance videos.</br></br>  One thing mentioned in article - is that now, productivity is actually lower than in 80th,90th. Because anime became HD, and it takes just lot more work to draw all the small details and maintain high definition imagery - both in animation and post processing and editing.  <br> Nips instant noodles price = decent chink's meal <br>Chinese cartoon would find a way.</br></br>  <br><br> Why can't the other Jap studios figure out that happier workers = more productive workers? <br><br>Why can't every company on the planet figure that out?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, let's blame resolution in a medium that:<br>a. has an analogue source (remastered Gunbuster BDs have more detail than your average shit nowadays) or<br>b. is using tablets to draw on (how the fuck does using a bigger canvas make it harder to work is beyond me)<br><br>Only thing that COULD slow down production is computing power, but that is a technical issue that can be solved by tossing money at it. Now, if the companies really can't afford to invest a few tens of thousands of dollars into hardware once in a while then the medium is truly fucked.<br><br>CG ain't gonna solve anything in this regard either if that is the case - you still need high-res textures for it to look good and you still need to render shit, which still uses massive amounts of computing power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I keep meaning to watch this but I always forget about it. Just like how I never finished the first episode and I didn't even drop the show, I just forget about its existence which is apparently a good thing.</br>  <br>Aside being yaraon.</br>  KyoAni's staff only get payed 90,000 yen a month, I know Kyoto is cheaper then Tokyo but Ghibli pays more.<br><br>Rough Draft pays 18,000 won a hour.<br><br>But in the end, TMS is TMBest paying at 1,320,000 yen a month at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 700 USD a month <br> in Japan </br></br>  <br><br>It's pretty much a clickbait site. Also the OP is completely making shit up as the article it quotes never once mentions any studio by name, but people will believe it because it's what they want to believe. That's what I hate about dumb anime fans.</br></br>  <br>Why can't the all Japs figure out that happier workers = more productive workers?<br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>Because capitalism. Measure your worth as a person by how much money you make.</br>  <br><br>Cause the whole insinuation is complete bullshit and something people just made up based on heresay and what's convenient. The OP just picked two studios that sound good to dumb anime fans and inserted them into the topic even though the only studio mentioned in the article is Disney/Pixar to which the answer of whether Japan could ever attain that level is pretty much no.</br></br>  Thank god not all Japanese studios are like this, TMS is one of the most highest payed studios in the country with directors getting payed at least 6600 yen a hour, KyoAni &amp; Ghibli also payed high as well but then budget cuts happen and when KyoAni down sized as well as give pay cuts, Ghibli rebuild it self.  <br><br>Literally. Never. Said. In. Article. Stop being so gullible.</br></br>  Apparently Japan has a lot of "black companies"? Companies where they don't pay their employees for working over-time.<br>I'm all for preserving culture but working in nippon is fucked. It's arguably the only thing where some things should be changed.</br>  <br><br>Sad but pretty much inevitable.</br></br>  <br>Can't you translate it?</br>  <br>It's the same thing here in America, just look at CalArts and Disney.</br>  <br>More like<br> alive workers = more productive workers <br>When a country is introducing more holidays to keep people from keeling over and is considering "death from overwork" an actual issue that needs to be addressed you know shit is fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>TMS also has working conditions as well.<br><br>Excellent really.<br><br><br>This. I did not post those posts however as the info about Ghibli &amp; KyoAni are outdated on the later post.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off famicom you autistic fuck. Stop spreading unsourced misinformation and pretending a dead shitty studio that barely even makes its own anime and is mostly just subcontracting is even slightly relevant or important anymore just because of your deluded fanboy nature.</br>  <br> TMS also has working conditions as well. <br>Then why is their show`s quality so shit?</br></br>  <br><br>Just use google chrome and the auto translate plugin.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure Toei are poor bitches too.</br>  <br>I did not post that, someone copied what TMSGuy did months ago.<br><br>But What I get is not misinformation and is from 2ch.<br><br>TMS is not dead.<br>http://www.tms-e.co.jp/<br>http://www.telecom-anime.com/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reboot when? Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter got a new anime so why can't this?  If it does happen, I'll cum so hard I won't be able to fap for a month.  Don't we already have Boku Girl?  <br>The fans seem to hate the new Sailor Moon series, so be careful what you wish for.</br>  <br><br>Rumiko never stopped working. All the other mangaka more or less stopped, and then a few decades later decide to milk their popular franchises. <br><br>Rumiko is still making new manga and hasn't stopped at all. And also, while Ranma was popular at the time, it didn't really have the lasting power. Heck, I'm not sure it's even the most popular Rumiko manga. (That'd probably be Inuyasha.)</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I suppose if there's anything to respect about Rumiko Takahashi, it's that she doesn't really linger on past successes once she's finally done with them.</br></br>  Mutation, it is the key to our evolution it has enabled us to evolve from a single celled organism into the dominant species of the planet, this process is slow normally taking thousands and thousands of years, but every few hundred millennia evolution leaps forward.  Power user registration act when?   humans <br> dominant species <br> laughingbacteria.png </br></br>  We already have Quicksilver (or would Nightcrawler be a better comparison) and Professor X to a certain extent.  <br> humans develop ways to kill bacteria </br>  <br> humans try their hardest to kill bacteria and can barely put a scratch in its global population <br> bacteria doesn't even know humans exist and still manages to be one of the deadliest things in human history <br><br>Keep embarrassing yourself human.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;humans try their hardest to kill bacteria and can barely put a scratch in its global population <br>Because population means it's the dominant species on the planet, right? That's why ants are so much more dominant than people, right? That's why animals alter the terrain of their planet to suit their needs rather than adapting to it, right? That's why animals have gone outside of the planet on their own, right? <br> &gt;one of the deadliest things in human history <br>So is childbirth</br></br></br></br>  <br>but hes not blue</br>  <br> Because population means it's the dominant species on the planet, right? That's why ants are so much more dominant than people, right? <br>Yes that's exactly what it means. Humans aren't more plentiful nor do they inhabit more places on earth. <br><br>The only reason humans think they're dominant is because they're the only animal that even knows the concept of "dominant" to begin with so there's nobody to challenge the claim.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Animals adapt to suit their environment, while humans change the environment to suit them. Humans are the only species to change climates on a large scale. That makes them by far the most dominant thing on this planet. A single species has caused a mass extinction event.</br>  <br>And yet they could never do anything that would wipe out all bacteria on the planet. Humans are obviously going to go extinct far before bacteria do (if they ever do at all). That makes them dominant. Making a big mess in your short stay of existence doesn't mean your dominant over the side thats been there long before you and will remain long after you.</br>  <br><br> Only humans change their environment <br>tfw bacteria in your gut makes you eat sugary foods</br></br></br>  <br>Call me when bacteria singlehandedly cause extinction events and alter the climate of a planet</br>  <br> "dominant" means you kill lots of things <br><br>Tell me something. There are 2 nations at war. Nation 1 goes around shooting bombs everywhere for no reason and causing lots of destruction, while nation 2 just has an impregnable wall. Nation 2 just sits there until eventually nation 1 winds up wiping themselves out, and now only nation 2 exists.<br><br>You would honestly still consider nation 1 the winner of the war just because they caused a big mess before dying out?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You realize this atmosphere full of oxygen is created by bacteria right?</br></br>  Will there be a Magneto character in this?  <br>And maintained by eukaryotic plants</br>  <br>If the wall is impenetrable, who are they killing? If they only kill themselves then obviously that's not dominating. Modern humans have wiped out plenty of species, including other human ones (although this is probably due to assimilation of populations)</br>  <br>probably be some moe shit character</br>  <br><br>After about 2 billion years and even then it's only one part out of many.</br></br>  <br> If the wall is impenetrable, who are they killing? <br>Why the hell can you not get it through your head that you don't have to be actively killing other things to be dominant?<br><br>Are you some call of duty kiddie who can't think about anything but their KDA and even tries to apply it to real life?<br><br>The only goal in the game of life is to survive.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You said they were causing destruction, which I assumed to mean death. Were they only destroying forests and animals?</br>  <br>Nation 1 was causing destruction you dipshit. Learn to read.</br>  <br>I asked WHAT they were destroying?</br>  <br>Buildings of lots of other random nations (including lots of their own), the landscape, and a tiny tiny amount of nation 2s population.</br>  <br>Well they certainly dominated those other nations. However bacteria is not magically impervious to humans and it only survives antibiotics and shit thanks to a high mutation rate. Bacteria has a far less intense impact on the planet than humans.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. Surviving is winning, and bacteria survive better than anything.</br>  <br>Surviving is not dominating. Just because arthropods have been around longer than mammals doesn't mean that mammals don't constantly prey on them and that they survive through short life spans and massive amounts of offspring.</br>  <br><br>What is silver nigger.<br><br>Just wait until we arm nanomachines with silver machine guns shooting nano scale silver bullets.<br><br>Bacteria won't know what hit them in this new arms race.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>survival of the species as a whole trumps survival of a few individual members</br>  <br>But it's not just a few individual members, there are billions of humans, the only warm blooded animals with a higher population than humans are domesticated by humans. Humans have created new species and wiped out their wild counterparts.</br>  <br>still doesn't make them THE dominant species.</br>  Just watched the first episode, was pretty good.<br><br>They even copied over the Takamatsu guy from AB here, too. Similar personality and looks, too.</br></br>  <br>The dominant species is the species that has the greatest effect on the planet. Nothing has had as significant an effect on the planet humans have. CO2 levels have skyrocketed in the atmosphere and the oceans, enormous areas of forest have been cleared that would've only gone naturally due to a major climate shift, and a single species has caused the earths sixth major extinction event. Bacteria's only significant effect was oxygenating the atmosphere, which took billions of years and humans are already fucking that up over a course of hundreds. Humans have developed ways to locate and kill bacteria that no other species can, and nanotechnology is only going to further that.</br>  <br>You list all that shit and yet NONE of it will ever actually impact more than a tiny fraction of bacterias global population. <br><br>you really are stupid if you think being really flashy for a couple thousand years somehow makes 1 species more dominant than another that's billions of years old already, will still be around billions more years from now, is more widespread, and more plentiful.</br></br></br>  Bacteria are not even animal nor plant, why would you say they are dominant species, at least compare humans to bears or shark like every kind of normal retard.  <br>So you're basing dominance on population and length it's been existing? Because you can't really compare the length bacteria has existed to humans due simply to complexity. Humans are vastly more complex than a single celled organism.</br>  <br>Bacteria aren't even a species, they're an entire domain of life. It would make more sense to compare bacteria to eukaryotes in general than to a specific species.</br>  <br> being really flashy for a couple thousand years <br>And effecting the planet more than bacteria has over billions? Yeah, I'd say that pretty fucking major.</br></br>  <br> A single species has caused a mass extinction event. <br>Yeah, Bacteria.</br></br>  <br> bacteria <br> single species </br></br>  The Black Death couldn't even touch the Polish<br>Nazis confirmed better than bacteria</br>  <br> an entire domain <br> dominant species </br></br>  <br>He teleports. Good enough.</br>  <br>This is Magneto.</br>  <br> what is the Oxygen Catastrophe </br>  Did this show sell well? It's amazing. I'm really surprised it was made as late as 2006. I was expecting it more to be early 00s when Japan was still making daring stuff like this. <br><br>That said, RIP to anyone who tried to follow this series per week.

The exposition is incredibly scant. It takes a few eps for you to piece things together enough for you to care about the characters.</br>  I got through the entire show and was fairly disappointed by the end. A lot of depressing atmosphere that felt like build-up only to explain most of the plot in that one quiz show episode. And the ending felt like "Raisin detre: Wow, it's fucking nothing."  <br>To be fair it was enjoyable enough to watch once, and I liked the bit where Iggy went rampant. Other than that I felt like Pino and Raul were the only characters I cared about.</br>  <br>Fuck you and whatever you're on. You've made no points relevant to the topic and just trying hard to be sarcastic. <br><br>Literally the type of shitposting ruining /a/.</br></br></br>  I'm curious to know what kind of people think that braindead garbage like Ergo Proxy is amazing and 'daring'.<br><br>I really hope you are still in high-school and it's just adolescent stupidity, OP.</br></br>  <br>See </br>  10/10 it's one of my favourite animes of all time.

It's irrelevant, moreso, made by how sarcastic you're trying to me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> me <br>be*</br></br>  How big is too big?  Depends on the body type, body size, body proportions, character, and what they're wearing if anything.<br>Just like any part of the body, boobs are no good just on their own. The body is like a finely made clock. The hands can be small works of art, but they're nothing without the face which compliments them, and the face feels bare without its frame. <br><br>Lets say you like tomboys and hate sticky sluts. A sticky slut will look like shit to you regardless of how well they're drawn or their breast size, however a tomboy will appeal even if it's poorly drawn - although there's a limit with most people to how badly drawn this can be. However, while you could love the tomboy and their breasts the artist could have a weird nipple fetish too and insert that and it clashes with your preference and ruins it, or maybe their hips are too small so it makes the tits look weird in proportion to the rest of the body. <br><br>The human body is a work of art and has its contrasts and compliments just like drawing, painting, or writing. Focusing on only just one part of it without taking into consideration of the rest is like appreciating only the pigment of a landscape by itself with nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone have source for this? On mobile and reverse gives nothing</br>      <br><br>Now this just looks silly.</br></br>  Does any anime have a better first episode then AOT? 10/10. Watched it 3 times now and it always moves me.  <br>First episode was pretty neat. The rest not so much.</br>  ,  <br>This tbh<br>Asteroid Blues really encapsulated the whole feel of the series.</br></br>  <br>A lot of people say how they hated how SSY was slow in the beginning, but that actually is part of the reason I loved it so much. I can't really fault the show on anything -- it's really great.</br>  First and only episode was best episode.  Who on earth would want to lick lolibutt? That just sounds really gross.
