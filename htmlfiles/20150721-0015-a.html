[ What did /a/ think of Nagi no Asukara?  <br>The setting and OST was great, not to mention the backgrounds and pretty colors. The second cour angst was way too dense but it's the best they could do with the show since only one cour wouldn't have worked neither.<br><br>That said, the first cour was a lot of fun to watch with /a/ once the NTR shitposters left, shame a lot of crossboarders, what we know now as "miunafags," joined after the timeskip and turned the threads into pseudo shitposting generals.</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't cucked, he was just being stupid<br>Chisaki didn't like him in the first place</br></br>  Really great show.<br><br>P. A. Works make some pretty amazing things. Uchouten Kazoku, Angel Beats, and this season Charlotte...</br></br>  Manaka was an awful character. The show was so much better while she was asleep.  <br>wrong beta, anon</br>  Why hasn't there been a furniture-based harem/romcom anime yet?<br><br>How long will it be until I can look forward to the anthropomorphic home-deco hijinks of "My House is Falling in Love With Me!", airing in the next season?</br></br>  <br>while we're at it<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/53885/d893763<wbr>323/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/515074/311438<wbr>df0b/</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>when some garbage web novel author decides to steal the chinks ideas.<br><br> Yes the chinks wrote several WN using this theme </br></br></br>  <br><br>By Rustle.</br></br>  Character design by R-<br><br>Aaaaah fuck you.</br></br>  <br>wat</br>  Kill it with ____  <br><br>High-Fructose Corn Syrup</br></br>  <br> you can always upvote he's post</br>  <br>Diabeetus</br>  Piss.<br><br>Blast it with piss.</br></br>  <br>GAMU</br>  Does anybody have a compilation pic of Hiroshi's style/art evolution?<br>I remember the earlier manga arcs being really rough visually, mostly the faces.<br>Prima Illya thread too I guess.</br></br>  <br><br>Four days for the next cour.</br></br>  <br>Is Illya the most sexualised Fate girl?</br>  <br>Tempted to do a nopan filter but it'll undoubtedly come out really shitty.</br>  <br>No, that would be Tohsaka and her dirty, dirty anus.</br>  <br>I'm digging this art style. Ilya is so fucking sexual with it.</br>  This is a cruel, murderous, 500 year old blood lusting vampire.  <br>My only complaint is no chara songs</br>  <br>Because donuts are fucking delicious obviously you faggot.<br><br>The only thing that Shinobu is doing wrong is that she only eats those donuts with a hole in them. The cream filled ones are the best.</br></br></br>  <br> Complains about donuts that aren't cream-filled <br> Posts Ararararagi cream-filling Shinobu's donut </br></br>  <br> Sundress not at the top <br> Hoodie not at the bottom <br><br>Shit taste confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually it's post Owari Shinobu that is most stable, Kanbaru gives her a Kamijou certified lecture in Shinobu Mail, which is why she seems so pensive lecturing Nadeko on taking advantage of Araragi, because she does too.<br><br>She also doesn't care in Tsuki should he become full vamp, despite how that would ruin his life.<br><br>So no, she hasn't changed much post Kabuki.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How is this allowed?  <br>It's not even that hot tbh</br>  <br>It's a very good ass, I don't know what you are talking about.</br>  <br>I agree with the other anon, his ass looks a bit shrunken, like he's malnourish just around the ass or something</br>   draw a 30-year old <br> call it a 12-year old <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128340939 <br>This is what I've been saying, /sp/ is full of fucking newfaggots. <br><br><br>More like you got bullied out of /sp/ by Matt and thought you could shelter yourself on /a/. <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you think posts are getting deleted like this, with the content they have, and he's not getting banned and is now ban evading, I don't know what to tell you.</br>  <br>I've been here for years m8. I spend more time on /a/ than anywhere else, people here are just more sensitive and quick to anger.</br>  <br>Or /b/, they love loli as well.</br>  <br>Mods have said time and time again that lolis are allowed on /a/ unless it's nsfw. But that applies to all nsfw stuff, so it's completely fair.</br>  We'll be getting a new PV tomorrow, right? What are you hoping for?  How impressed is Riina?    <br>I wish I had your eyesight.</br>    Where can I buy this hat?  Can we take a moment to appreciate the fact that this guy took the time during a chaotic operation with lives at stake to edit the Wikipedia article of K2 to maintain factual accuracy.  <br><br>I think I like the commie line more. What did H and D translate it to?</br></br>  <br> The peak elevation of the mountain has dropped to the 3rd highest in the world! </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Commie translated it as "K2 is now the third highest mountain in the world".</br>  <br><br>If so, HS is better.</br></br>  <br>Crunchy might be more amusing but there's no way in hell it's more accurate.</br>  Mikan's episode in 5 hours<br><br>Episode 03:<br>Part of the chapter 02<br>Chapter 03<br>Chapter 04<br>Part of the chapter 08</br></br></br></br></br></br>    Tanning problem related pic  <br><br>Let's visit the sick related pics</br></br>  Mikan's ahegao face is failed  <br>Like your English.</br>  Let us discuss the greatest SoL anime there is and ever will be.<br><br>What is your favourite episode of K-ON?<br>What is your favourite HTT song?<br>And, most importantly: what is it that makes Azusa so perfect?</br></br></br></br>  <br>  posting this in every thread <br>First time I've mentioned it.<br> "Slice of life for mech police" contradicts the very nature of slice of life. Conceptually it cannot be one. <br>"Slice of life" is very broad. It has meaning beyond 'cute schoolgirls doing cute things'. I'm not objecting to cute schoolgirls doing cute things, mind you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2, 10, 20</br>  <br>Funny, you managed to stumble upon two of the three main dramatic arcs in the show as well as an introductory one.</br>  <br>Filler doesn't make an anime a SoL<br>Naruto, an anime that is 90% filler, is obviously not a SoL</br></br>  <br> Filler <br>Alright, it's clear that you still don't quite get it.</br></br>  Watching second episode of 3rd season right now. I never thought I'd say this, but Souma is actually a true bro. I didn't have any disliking towards him in previous seasons, but I always thought he was a weird character. But now he's actually being an awesome dude.<br><br>btw, third season plot about the staff relatonship is promissing so far. I'm fucking hyped</br></br>  <br>That's just because most harems don't sell enough to adapt their source materials to the end. Most of them do have resolutions and moments like this or even more, but they don't get animated. Working wouldn't have had too if it didn't get 3 (three) seasons.</br>  Inami's pretty cute and I'd  date  her.  Yamada is seriously my fav girl. I have an entire folder only for her. I can dump some here maybe.  My dick, I want Kozue to fuck me.  Is s2 aired in 1080p or is my 720p download the best you get?<br><br>also fuck the naming conventions - most software passes over apostrophes</br></br>  I'll start.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YBh<wbr>sDtFUgdM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Didn't this guy die?</br>  <br>Yup.<br>Have another OP by the same band.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ij-<wbr>QzADZ5YY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Not liking Jinn <br>Fag</br></br>  <br>I like opening in a so bad it's good sorta way.

They just don't want to live in abject poverty so that a few exploitative fucks can live in luxury at their expense. It's fun that you think that people don't deserve to be treated like human beings when they are born into unavoidable social circumstances, while lazy fucks who inherited all their money apparently have the right to have a profligate lifestyle regardless of the consequences.<br><br> What goes around comes around, and it's time to pay up. <br><br>They have paid more than was originally burrowed. They paid and keep paying for the decisions others made on their behalf. <br><br><br><br>And the politicians didn't keep their word, like usual. Just looka the recent referendum. The democratic decision was completely ignored.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a scam. The same scam Western corporations use to exploit third world countries. <br>Explain furhter.</br></br></blockquote>]
