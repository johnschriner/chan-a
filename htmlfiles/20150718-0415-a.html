I can't wait to see Nao and her antics. Fluffy nerd idol is cutest idol</br>   I can’t tell you what is happening with Cinderella Girls, but I do know that hopefully it’ll be done. That’s all I can say really.   <br><br>ENJO KOSAI<br>N<br>J<br>O<br><br>K<br>O<br>S<br>A<br>I</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop it.</br>  <br>I want to shave her eyebrows off.</br>  <br>Enjo kudasai?</br>  <br><br>Stop being in denial. They are swimming in shopping money from their various sugar daddies.</br></br>  <br>Stop it.</br>  <br>Karen has to pay for her hospital bills somehow.</br>  <br>Japan has universal health coverage like every other first world nation.</br>  <br>It's not universal, though.</br>  <br> Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health care insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance programme administered by local governments. Patients are free to select physicians or facilities of their choice and cannot be denied coverage. Hospitals, by law, must be run as non-profit and be managed by physicians. For-profit corporations are not allowed to own or operate hospitals. Clinics must be owned and operated by physicians. <br><br> This healthcare is provided by both the local and the national governments. Payments for personal medical services are offered through an insurance system called universal healthcare. This system provides equality of access, along with fees that are set by a particular government committee. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, Karen is still done for regardless. It would be hilarious if she dies in the middle of a live. Imagine Rin and Nao running over to her body after she collapses and thinking she just fainted, only to find out she has no heartbeat. Now that would be a show to remember.</br>  <br> anon feels threatened that his idol is no longer pure <br>anon please.</br></br>  <br>Endometriosis isn't going to kill her, anon.</br>    <br>So Nao pleases old men for money? I thought that was Rin's line of work though.</br>  <br>No. Ugly is a word better used to describe Nao's face.</br>  <br>Did someone say Kaede?</br>  <br>hey fuck you mate that was completely uncalled for.</br>  <br>The truth hurts. She's an ugly, hairy nerd with a terrible singing voice.</br>    S2 will end up being more Rin bias and focusing on the forced drama between NG and TP  <br> Ugly is a word better used to describe Nao's face. <br> Nao's face. <br>I believe there was a mistake in your statement. Here I fixed it for you:<br><br>Ugly is a word better used to describe MY face.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be an amicable split since Mio has Positive Passion and Uzuki will form a group with Sachiko and Sae.</br>  <br>Uzuki will form a group with  loneliness and despair. </br>  <br> amicable split <br>not before Awakened Uzuki happens, until then <br> Dookie's Gambarimasu levels are dangerously low, goes into silent Despair(TM) </br></br></br>  <br>Sachiko has Koume/Syoko, and Sae has Syuko. <br>Dookie will be left all alone like she should be.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Shut up, I want more Sae.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We can get more Sae, just don't let it interfere with dookie suffering.</br>  <br>Doesn't everyone?</br>    <br>what's that Lassie?<br>Timmy's stuck in a well?<br><br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Yukiho exists.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nX3<wbr>f7bIZT4E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Exists as my slave.</br>  <br>why is she crying on the toilet?</br>  <br>Because you are watching her so she can't go.</br>  <br>Constipated.</br>  <br>Now this is just plain wrong to do such a bad thing to such a sweet girl<br><br> but it feels so right. </br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2ZI<wbr>odsmeMyE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8QT<wbr>hrcHNG1E</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jlf<wbr>4-lOHrLM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=icn<wbr>7sZDF7Ao</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IiL<wbr>K089l37U</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0b2<wbr>8j4B0aTA</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XLv<wbr>q7GmqX98</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7G1<wbr>YAPX5YNo</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4vs<wbr>8GE2dT5E</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qWP<wbr>c5I2qMnw</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=unk<wbr>zPXFRWJE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EOR<wbr>QOlG7BwE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And hemorrhoids.</br>  <br> tfw miscarriage </br>  <br>Is this that same Yukihofag from yesterday?</br>  <br>No, I'm not actually a Yukihofag.</br>  <br>I won't let her.

Damn it, they made Kirari's face too damn adorable this even.  <br>One does not simply hate on the Kirari. Kirari is love and her heart and intentions are wholesomely pure. To hate her is to hate love and all that is good on this planet.</br>      I can hardly wait  <br>23:02 yeah cinderella is on</br>  It appears neetball isn't going to be the one streaming at this rate.

Pffft, bait and switch. <br><br>Well-played, A-1.</br></br>   this whole episode <br>Flop, you piece of shit.</br>  I feel trolled.  So a whole episode of silly idol hijinks<br><br> I'm perfectly okay with this. <br><br>Not as grand as expected but it's a fine way to start.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It could've been worse. It could've jsut been a rehash of what the last anime did which was pretty boring and very cookie cutter.</br>  Kaede time?  I'm laughing at all of you fuckers that expected TP to become a thing, at least immediately from the start.  Fucking A-1 why no Kaede?  Fuck you niggers.<br><br>Karin got voiced. I'm jumping with joy right now.</br></br>   When the Spell is Broken <br><br>Welp, it's time for Cinderella to stop being Cinderella.</br></br>  who hype for TP drama here  <br>Too early for suffering.</br>  I thought it was a great episode.  No Momoka/10  RIP everythinh  <br> expecting loli <br> ever </br></br>  Miku has returned-nya.  <br>Are you guys ready for the suffering?</br>  Fucking stream lagged out at the end. Anyone hear what evil step mother said about idol division?  5K sales confirmed.  This is episode was nice.<br><br>CG is great when it's just silly idols doing silly idol things. Natsuki being ROCK not to mention they got Mayu's character down quite well. I look forward to the next episo-<br><br> When the Spell is Broken <br><br>OH SHIT NIGGER. HERE WE GO.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded.</br>  Damn, watching that Love Live AD after CG ended was like eating a really fancy and delicious cake after eating shit.  <br><br>Nice.</br></br>  <br> All of the top ranking idols in the 200-idol Akihabara storefront now have voices <br>I seriously thought Karin's high placement in that was a joke. Where the fuck had the Karinfags been hiding all this time?<br>Maybe now she and Aiko can be friends again.</br></br></br>  Up on Daisuki  <br>this episode ended with that evil step mom announcing 'all current idol projects will soon be disbanded.'<br><br>well, next week should be fun.</br></br></br>  <br>nya! nya!</br>  <br>Yeah, whatever, bring in new idols when they still don't do shit with half the cast.</br>  Can we expect more BEST CHUUNI this season?   mfw stream is kill on me after P read Mayu's letter in his office.   <br>Don't really care for the drama unless it's Karen passing out and ending up in the hospital.</br>  <br>I'm in a good mood after this episode, so heres your reply. Enjoy your stay shitposting these threads.<br><br><br>Seeing Mayu's crazy animated was great even if it's not in the way you'd expected.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It did get me hooked. Then there's the resolution to the episode. Could've expected that to happen, but I got baited.<br><br>About the end of the episode.  Lady boss is saying she wants to reorganize the Cinderella project or something? Am I hearing it wrong? <br><br><br>Didn't really catch on to that. Pretty sure she said something about reorganization. Meaning we'll get to see P sent to another set of idols. And the drama revolving around it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's the status on cakes, from 0 to lex luthor?  <br> I'm in a good mood after this episode <br>Fuck you too NG fag.<br><br><br>In short, they are getting rid of the girls who they didn't do anything with either ways. At least that's smart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There were no cakes this episode.

The prince will choose her even after the magic runs out.</br>  Natsuki CV : 安野希世乃<br>Karin CV: 新田ひより</br>  About Mayu, keep in mind that TakeP isn't even her producer. So why would she have affectations for him? Well aside from that he's tall, dark and handsome...okay, nevermind the question, just understand the first point.  <br>I'd go gay for TakeP. No Homo.<br><br>But the reason why she stalked TakeP this episode isn't because she wants to fuck him.</br></br></br>  If you want middle school girl fanservice, you are better off with Aikatsu than this.    <br> No Homo. <br><br>Keep telling yourself that.</br></br></br>  <br>She ended up stalking another P for that instead. I can't understand moonspeak so I don't know why she went to TakeP first, but I guess it was some intermediate kind of thing.<br><br><br>Considering I don't want that, I'm okay, you can go on ahead though.<br><br>Huh, rewatching this episode, at the beginning where Rin turns to look to our left, it reminded me of the cameo she had in the Im@s movie end credits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I was half-expecting for the stalker to not be Mayu for obvious reasons (one being that he's not her producer).<br><br>But if they're going to play up the stalking plot that way is there going to be any other character for that, even?</br></br></br></br></br>    For people too lazy to google for shit in Moon.<br><br>Natsuki's VA<br>http://myanimelist.net/people/12711<wbr>/Yasuno_Kiyono<br><br>Karin's VA<br>No other notable role other than /sci/ from Jinsei.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Still developing preferences on the Cinderella Girls</br>    <br>I was tricked, too, at first. I'm happy with the results either way, because Mayu didn't even act like Mayu at all in the first cour. It's just silly  creepy  fun at that.

Why is Saber so weak?<br>I though she was suppose to be the strongest servant</br>    Shirou can't provide the sperm for her maximun power  Saber is Wolverine, the dude they hype up as the biggest badass so that when someone else shows up and they break him over their knee, it's proof of how extremely powerful they are.  <br>Correction. Shirou is a shit mage and has to provide sperm for max power.</br>  Girugameshu is the strongest Servant.  <br>If a broken Shirou can defeat Saber Alter, then Archer can defeat a proper Saber.<br><br>Every King jobs in stay night. If you're a king, you'll job.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou is a shit mage, so of course his Saber will have shit stats.</br>  <br>So you're saying that a Rin-backed Saber would have destroyed Soichirou?</br>  <br><br><br>I see, is it also true that Saber is a cuck?</br></br></br>  <br>Arthur is a confirmed cuck, but Guinevere and Lancelot felt bad about cucking him when he was actually dead, so stopped seeing each other.</br>  Here. <br>Dark Sakura&gt;Rin&gt;Kerry&gt;Shirou<br><br>With Dark Sakura <br>cons:<br> she loses the ability to ride things <br> her agility is crap  <br>pros:<br>can spam exacliblasts all day long <br> gains a greater power in her life  <br> has a short of force field that can cope with her low agility  <br>Rin: <br>cons: <br> is rin her self she can use a servant to the fullest will through away her servant if needed <br>Pros:<br> reviled at her max power when she was alive in the good old days  <br> good luck i guess <br>Kerry<br>cons <br> shit luck no capability whatsoever  <br>pros:<br> decent stats  <br>Shirou:<br>cons: <br> shit stats and luck <br>pros:<br>Avalon</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because  NASU IS A HACK </br>  <br>Wait so Dairmud could canonically defeat Cu? Or is that just because Kayneth is a better magus than Bazett?</br>  S E C O N D A R I E S  <br>Her charm is that the plot hype her as fuck and have shinny toys so you think of her as a badass but is also cute and dependable and gets trounced with easy quite a number of times so you feel bad for her and wish to take care of her. Works for many anons but for others like me is really frustrating and dissapointing. <br><br><br>Except they abuse that so much it gets old real fast and it gets hard to believe that defeating Saber is that big of an achievement. If anything I now always look out at her fights half-expecting her to screw up at some point. Her victories are the rare ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou a shit master.<br>Or, rather, because otherwise there wouldn't be much of a plot.<br>In short, she gets reduced to a plot device, especially outside of her route and whenever battles are involved.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually Nasu stated in a interview that in a Lancing duel with no NP just a regular fight between Cu and Dairmud. Dairmud would be the victor.</br>  <br>To think there people doubting based Zero Lancer.</br>  <br> i am disconnected from reality and thus i dislike your post and to stop people from agreeing with you I shall deem thee a baiter </br>  <br>All of the Servants have that moment<br><br> Why is [SERVANT] so weak? <br> I thought [SERVANT] was supposed to be the strongest servant </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this some sort of re-bait/counter-bait?</br>  <br>Saber was too confident. She screwed up.</br>  <br>What? He said with the conditions that each had in their respective wars that Deermud would win because he had the better conditions. At optimal power for both, like in Ireland, Cu wins.</br>  <br>Zero Lancer &gt; EMIYA<br>Zero Lancer &gt; Lancelot</br></br>  <br> it cause shirou is a shit master  <br>what is fate/zero?</br></br>  <br>No. Only Saber and Gil are told to be the strongest. At least Gil had solid achievements to sustain it and even at his shittiest he remains a legitimate threat. Saber is more of a storytelling exaggeration.</br>  <br> buying Saber shit <br> liking Bleach/Stay Night  <br>ISHYGDDT</br></br></br>  <br>we've never seen Cu bazett, and<br> stats <br> meaning anything <br>Cu could use Gay bulge on saber and it would still hit diarmuid because E rank luck</br></br></br></br>  How come most of Fate's Magi are so bad in fights? When on the Kara no Kyoukai/Tsukihime side, you have Araya Souren, Elesia, Nrvnqsr, TATARI, Roa. And even that ridiculous monster Yumizuka who became a Dead Apostle in a single night and awoke to her Reality Marble a very short while after.  <br>because nasu is an inconsistent hack</br>  <br> like in Ireland, Cu wins <br>No home land advantages no bullshit. In a regular Lance duel between them Zero Lancer would win.</br></br>  <br>I tought Lancelot was the baddest motherfucker skill-wise. Shouldn't he be the strongest in a fight without magic and Servant stat bullcrap?</br>  <br>One of Dairmud's spears negates Knight of Honer. However to get past this Lancelot should start of with arondight to end it quickly.</br>  <br><br>This anon gets it <br><br><br>one servant knows how to play vidya,but another doesn't know how to baseball<br> japan </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it a tradition that the Saber class is always beaten by the Lancer class at the start of the story?  Show me a more infuriating scene in anime/manga than this. Go ahead, I'll wait.    <br>Ha ha stay mad.</br>    <br>Still mad. Will the rage ever leaver me, /a/?</br>  <br>At least post the right page.</br>      <br>what's the context ?<br><br><br>Infuriating at first then it went full retard with spending a huge amount of chapters with nothing more than rape/mindbreak. Author looked like he just wanted to prolong the "story" a little further.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Show me a more infuriating scene in anime/manga than this. <br> Guts on a boat. </br></br>  <br>I didn't mind the manga i liked it but god damn medeka or whatever her is name was such a stupid cunt. Zenkichi was my bro but i have no idea why he put up with her and didn't move on with a much better girl</br>  <br>suzuka</br>  <br>at least post the right page</br>  <br>Give me a single reason to care about romance manga</br>  <br>What's a rage thread without some Medaka.</br>  <br>It's not manga, but damn, there has never been a scene that infuriated me more than this. I honestly had to stop and walk away when I got to this part. Even now, it still pisses me off.</br>  <br>oh come on OP<br><br>it's a SEOOOOO manga. if you were reading that expecting anything but MC being a wishy-washy whinny asexual indecisive beta fagot, who strings along women, then changes his mind because another girl is crying, while best girls get run over by trucks, or dumped by the peice of shit MC in favor of awful selfish bitches, then you went into a SEOOOOO manga with the wrong expectations.</br></br></br>    <br>you just had to stab and twist that dagger didn't you?<br><br>fuck<br><br>you know i think this story arc made me dislike her so much it sorta ruined the rest of the manga as i simply couldn't get over my displeasure for that bitch. Zen could have done so much better with ANYONE else. There were so many best girls in this series.</br></br></br></br></br>          <br> whats the context <br>Main heroine stops giving shit about main dude since he's ordinary and can't do shit right and gets forgotten like in pic which like a punch in the gut since anons can self insert</br></br>        <br>I don't have it, but the last few pages of Rotte no Omocha pissed me off.<br><br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking remember what I feel when I read this.<br> Fuuka is best girl <br> MC is not being an indecisive bitch <br> MC and best girl are honest about what they feel <br> No misunderstandings <br> No "All aboard the rage train" <br> Happy and comfy relationship <br> Let's kill the main girl <br>Shit, I know that things would be stalled if that continued, but it still hurt like hell. Fucking Seo. This was your best ruse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont see how this is infuriating to so many, this is how you properly shatter an ideal.</br>  <br>How did that end? I know, I know.  Pls spoonfeedme. </br>  <br>eh, it's fine. best girl won in the end so fuck that mary sue</br>  <br>Medaka is and will be worst waifu.<br><br>Prove me wrong faggets.</br></br></br>  I literally yelled dropped out loud<br><br> I still read it like the otter I am </br></br>  <br>Hardcore NTR I take it?</br>  <br>She might come back from the dead</br>  <br>Manwha? Names are Korean</br>  <br>Haha, this fucking asshole.</br>     best-friends.png   <br> I didn't even know how to feel after watching this. I was mentally confused for a month straight. </br>  Every chapter of Nisekoi  <br>Legendary ending. Saving grace is the manga is still alive</br>  <br> Where did I go wrong? </br>  <br><br>I'm okay with it. I just want a Season 2.</br></br>  <br>how new are you jesus christ, go back to tumblr, this shit happens all the time.</br>  <br>Holy Shit, been planning on reading the manga after finishing the anime but GOD DAMN, I'll pass please tell me Main Dude gets with someone else than that cunt. And what arc was this kind anon ?</br>  <br>meh, it was overdone. Really plays it down when you remember those are supposed to be fucking middleschoolers</br>  <br>People usually just say DROPPED and don't actually drop it, but I actually dropped this series at this exact moment. Fuck it made me mad like never before.</br>  <br>Well i dont blame you. That MC is one of the worst ive ever fucking seen.</br>  <br>LITERALLY WHY</br>  <br>Seems fine to me, raising your own waifu.</br>  <br>I've seen this around, can someone explain to me why it's so bad?<br><br>I'm never going to read it.</br></br></br>  <br>You dont even need to read it to see in that exact panel why the MC is the biggest pile of dog shit ever.</br>  <br> this shit happens all the time. <br>Meh, I had extra resentment for this than any other manga or anime because it was actually good.</br></br>  <br>I feel sorry for people who read this manga for years and only got this.</br>  <br>Glad i dropped it.</br>  <br>I'd suggest reading it, but only read the first quarter. Like 68 chapters or so. Disregard everything after that.</br>  <br>The part in Monster Musume where Darling chose  Smith </br>  <br>I'm positive the arc after the minus one which the arc itself isn't that bad and is worth a read. It though it gets worse later on.</br>    <br>I don't get why people get so frustrated at this one. Yes, there's quite a bit of miscommunication, confusion, misunderstandings, etc., but it's not any worse than your normal romance.</br>  <br> Everything after the attempted suicide was garbage. </br>  It goes without saying<br><br><br>This anon knows.<br><br>The ending wasn't that bad in itself, but everything after volume 5 was significantly less well done with volume 6 being just awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>also dropped the manga, started reading fuuka hoping for a fresh start. Seo kills best girl. FUCKING DROPPED. thus he is blacklisted</br>  <br>It is a h-manga NTR so it is not that infuriating to me, I can not take NTR seriously.</br>  <br>good plan</br>  <br>Idiots who identify more with the asshole who sexually harasses women than the nice guy who actually deserved the good girl.<br><br>It makes no sense because I'm sure /a/ is full of the type who hate women picking assholes over nice guys.</br></br></br>  <br> expecting a romantic conclusion in a gag series <br>Only have yourself to blame.</br></br>  <br>Mahh nugga, i think im the only one who read this piece of shit heart wrecker. Fuck the ending ;_; also was the boy is his son?<br><br>Sad Love Song</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I can, I honestly can't think of a more unlikeable pair of nob-ends to serve as the main couple in any series I've read. <br>They totally invert the emotional response you're supposed to get from them, so that their moments of strife are gratifying, and their happy scenes are infuriating.</br></br>  Still mad now.     I have faith in Yoshikazu, but this still hurt   <br>The one thing doesn't necessarily exclude the other.</br>  <br>FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>God fucking dammit Araki</br>  <br> /a/ <br> not assholes </br></br>  <br>I don't even remember that scene, so I'm pretty sure it's not in Seo's top ten most infuriating scenes.</br>    <br>thanks mr skeletal</br>  <br>He's living it, I'm reading about it in a Chinese comic with a day in between translations, and he still fucking got over it before I did.<br><br>I'm slightly afraid those are the Kanaka genes at work.</br></br></br>  this almost killed me  <br>it's no joke fuck this manga</br>  <br>fuck this to</br>  <br>the fact that he dumped best girl for the peping one triggered me the most after this bitch did this to him</br>  <br>nice im another otter</br>  <br><br><br><br>Well technically he was her side boyfriend. The dude was her first partner. She's still a massive cunt who needs to get gangbanged by niggers and impregnated taking care of her triplets alone in a fucking burnt down house while being a crack whore. <br><br>The most infuriating part is she was able to go abroad and seemed to be successful at sucking international dicks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I will never understand how this infuriated people so much. I mean, you were waiting for it to happen for a few dozen chapters, and it's not like she was a particularly likable character anyway. It just sort of made sense, didn't it?<br><br><br>She was a cunt, but she basically got her just desserts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck that part where she ask him months leater for doing oral to him again FUCK HER</br>  The whole last part was shit, but this right here was too cruel and infuriating.  <br>she seemed so nice at least for myself i found this painfull to watch since i was rooting hard for her because she was a "nice girl" and the next one who was best girl got dumped for the shitty blong one</br>  <br>is this GANTZ ?</br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>jajajajajaja fuck those aliens we never got to see what happened to their lives after that and thats what triggered me the most</br>  <br>She slept with him on a whim and then started dating him but kept disappearing because of "her parents". She was clearly never a nice girl (honestly, her reactions after he found out made me like her more than I did before that).<br><br>Madoka was really nice and she didn't deserve that, but she wasn't very interesting and wouldn't have made much sense as the winner even if peephole hadn't been destined to win from the start.</br></br></br>  <br>the bullshit with his brother didnt make sense at all</br>  Something a little recent from earlier in april  <br>It scares me how much he looks like his mom in the last panel</br>    <br>Wait, you mean hers - peephole's? I don't remember MC's being relevant.<br><br>If you mean hers, yeah, that was really poorly done. I suspect the author could have made the whole thing a lot better but chose to write a longer and more "dramatized" story because sales.</br></br></br>  Does 2015 /a/ even remember this manga? I doubt it.  If only for the reactions here    <br>Everyone do everything wrong: the manga</br>  <br>My nigga, has the afterstory novel thing been translated yet?</br>    <br>Rage? Far from it. <br><br>I marathon read that arc and despite me liking Zenkichi so much I had completely forgotten about him, so this page was fucking excellent for me.</br></br></br>  <br>The poll at the time showed 60% of /a/ was satisfied and/or enjoyed the ending.<br><br>I agree the reaction from the anti-Chihiro club who didn't see this ending coming a mile off was fucking hilarious though.</br></br></br>  Not sure if it was "rage", but it was definitely some kind of anger.  <br>fuck this gay earth</br>  <br>At this point I think the rage about the manga itself is eclipsed by the threads that result from it.<br><br>People get fucking angry as shit at each other in those.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is chapter 21  <br>I felt more angry about him not showing his face again.</br>  <br>I was sad, I wasn't mad till later on</br>  <br>I see this all the fucking time.<br><br>The girl was in the wrong, but she's fucking ten and infinitely less to blame than the friend or the dad. Fight me.</br></br></br>   Best girl gets shot in an alley by a nobody <br> actually dies <br>I used to see it posted a lot in these type of threads but I can't remember the name of the manga<br>Anyone know what I'm talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>It gives you what you'll never be able to get in real life.</br>    <br>i never got this.<br><br>The "best friend" dude fucked a ten year old.<br><br>the solution is to go to the police.<br><br>THE END!<br><br>I dropped it instantly after the brother just became an angry bitch instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Huh. I only recognize three of these series, mostly because I have no interest in drama manga with beta male MCs. I don't know how you anons tolerate the rage and how things always get drawn out by misunderstandings.<br>The only time I've ever been pissed at an anime is Kimi no Todoke season 2, when after a whole season of slow but forward development, MC takes 50 steps backwards by refusing to give main dude her damn chocolates.</br>  <br>you were still able to feel anything at that point? <br><br>MC just fucked up to much, i didnt really care anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me this, faggot.<br>Fuck you.</br></br>  <br>ridiculous drama involving characters that dont act like real humans?</br>  <br> mostly because I have no interest in drama manga with beta male MC <br> pissed at Kimi no Todoke  <br>you are not making any sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that he shouldn't have gone to the police, but that wouldn't really have ended the manga. Most of the drama was between him and his sister.</br>  the fact Takumi forgave her...  <br> Well, that's what romance is, so yeah.</br>  <br>I like this guy already. Picked up.</br>  <br>Not even mad, it fit the series.</br>  <br>I didn't even read this and it makes me mad.</br>  <br><br><br><br> people being pissed off because of that <br> not with the cute brown childhood friend coming into the game for couple chapters and then disappearing </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck that whore.I wanted to see her and the cheating bitch to suffer in regret of the whore decisions they made a lot more</br>  <br> my face she came to MC just to tell him she was gonna marry someone <br> my face that flashback <br>Holy fucking shit man, you are in love with MC but yet you go fuck around like it's no ones business, then you actually manage to stop being a slut for a second and get into MC's pants when suddenly his fratboys run in and pretend that she was just playing you for a fool, which she played along with.<br><br>In general the drama could have been a little bit longer though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are not wrong. she's universally hated.</br>  <br>Did MC at least learn from the experience and walked away from this unproductive situation?</br>  <br>did a 360 and walked away</br>  <br>/thread on the first post.</br>  <br>Following that event the main dude becomes MC of the arc, which is the best arc in the manga. It is worthy to read every shitty chapter before minus arc just to reach that.</br>  <br>so whats so bad about that? Is she talking about another guys child?</br>  <br>very time I see this guy it reminds me of a manga where this dude lives in the city and his sister and her friend run away of something and live in his apartment and turns out it is his sister and the girl are lover and eventually the lover lives with him and he fucks her while he is dating someone else and get caught and end not having either and he figured out he truly likes the lesbian,but she moved on and he ends up a lonely fuck I wish I could remember the name.Any ways I hoped kimi iru machi shit mc got caught and they girl became lesbian lover and he becomes lonely,but he didn't and appear in the other author's work</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>not even mad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>poor master baits QQ</br>  <br>Plus it was so obvious.</br>  <br> everyone says their waifu is perfect medaka truly is so much that you will get outclassed and left behind it impossible to keep up with perfection </br>  <br>It was obvious from the start, of course you have to go through tons of bullshit to get to it, thats how these work.</br>  that's not even Seo Kouji's best hit  <br> best hit </br>  <br>And it's not even the first time truck happens in a Seo manga.</br>  <br> Seo <br>worst author ever how does this shit keep getting published</br></br>    <br> Seo Kouji's best hit <br>kek</br></br>    <br> There are a lot of parallels with my life so I self insert as the guy. <br> Guy has it rough but we're all going to make it, he has come to terms with his stress now the healing can begin. <br> Raises the death flag and then proceeds to speed through a red light with his eyes closed <br><br>At the time I was furious but now I don't know how to feel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck fuck fuck. I think I recognize this but nothing comes to mind. what manga is this guys?</br>  <br>Tsugumomo.</br>  <br>No.<br>He fucking raised her and then in the end, she wants his kid??<br>Why? Literally NOTHING to insinuate this would happen until the very last few chapters.<br>So shoehorned and fucking creepy too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I admit it I first saw this scene in the Anime. Literally stopped the video after this scene went for a smoke and seriously considert throwing my PC out of the window.</br>  There's absolutely no way anyone could stay calm after reading it.  <br>GODDAMNIT</br>  <br>oh, thats Usagi Drop right? Yeah i heard the ending is shit so i didnt bother reading it.</br>  Whatever is currently the last scene in historie, cause i have to wait for new chapters  <br><br>Rin wants her own child to experience all the love and care she experienced growing up with whatshisface. So what better way to have the child experience all that love than to have the man himself raise another one, rather than get some cheap imitation of him? Rin only wants what's best for her childrens.</br></br>  <br> expect porn <br> DESPAIR <br>Why does this always happen with original stories in H-manga?</br></br></br>  <br>The most infuriating scenes were whenever the mc behaved like an edgy misanthropist, jesus this manga was bad</br>  <br><br>how do you get involved in a 20 page story thats usually 15 pages sex? I dont get it, H-manga never touches me emotionally.</br></br>  <br>I  don't  want to see it again</br>  <br>Suu's new manga? I ain't giving that asshole another chance.</br>  <br>Because not every NTR manga is 20 pages long.<br><br>I dare you not get invested in Musa or Fork in the Road.</br></br></br>    <br><br>I have yet to see an anon that didn't rage at least once to Nozoki Ana.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty good so far.</br>  <br>and good riddance fucking whore</br>  <br>That was pathetic rather than pathetic. A nice twist on the Jump hero determination thing. Can't make it past the qualifiers and gets angry when all the contestants who passed come back.</br>  Anything and everything involving Good Ending.<br><br>I cannot believe a man can go through all of that and not end up as a misogynistic murderer.</br></br>  <br>Pathetic rather than infuriating, I mean. Zenkichi was disappointing there.</br>  <br>pretty sure thats not an H-manga</br>  <br><br>because it's not the girl's fault</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it is not their fault over half of them are terminally retarded holy shit.<br><br>And the MC isn't any better.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless I'm mistaken I don't remember GE being that infuriating, aside from the shifty and clearly rushed last arc and ending</br>  <br>It was satisfying enough seeing her getting blown the fuck out.</br>  <br>Only on technicality.</br>  <br><br>It would turn you misanthropic, I guess .. sbut I'd think thrice before joining the MRA</br></br>  <br>Is that a truck for Godzilla? How does it fit on the road?</br>  <br>I assume it takes place in America.</br>  <br>Are trucks really a problem in Japan? I find it impossible for a truck to go at that speed in the middle of a city.</br>  <br>this image really drove home the rage of the chapters the were before it....</br>  <br>It's a trope that creatively bankrupt mangaka use like pretty much every single writer until someone deviates from the formula and then that gets copied, ad infinitum. <br><br>For some reason, truck-san is still played straight but I suppose that's what the braindead nip romance manga audience wants,</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why they don't use a car. You will get the same end (Killing a character without thinking) and it's far more realistic.</br>  <br>What a fuck up little shit the sister was.</br>  <br><br> time skip nothing really changes time skip was a waste of a final chapter literally you could added a page to previous chapter making the last chapter's time skip unnecessary as it brought nothing to the table.They do not even look all that different it was a worthless final chapter it was the final chapter,but it felt more like an anime filler </br></br>  <br>At this point I feel it's pretty disrespectful to kill the character via truck.</br>  <br>because a fuckhuge truck likely has more impact? It's been done to death but a character getting killed off by a little shitty car (pic related) is pretty sad compared to getting run down by a metal behemoth.<br><br>But that's overestimating most of the writers who use the truck trope and is likely just used because of tradition or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br>Truck killing is shit. At least if one car like that kills someone you can get a laugh.</br>  <br>Is this from Elfen Lied or something by the same guy?

So which episode will we get GUNGNIR DATTO this time around? I'm betting 9.  <br>Episode 5</br>  <br>Better than Miku, frankly.  Or even Hibiki. <br><br>Some character development for a character that hasn't had the chance to even remotely finalize her conflict from G would be good, especially as it would help her finally get rid of her uselessness.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they already subverted it with the NOISE DEWA NAI.<br>Don't hold your breath.</br></br>    <br>If Zombie Kanade ends up being a thing, then it'll happen when she gets revealed. Otherwise I don't really expect it - us getting it twice was already enough.</br>  <br> rumor <br>In all seriousness though. They wouldn't have had that "you must become idoru to mamoru the girls' future" scene, unless it would come into play later.<br>Chekhov's gun, etc.</br></br></br>  <br>She must have died a little bit in the interior when the whole world saw her naked.</br>  <br>It'll be ALCHEGUNGNIR DATTO.</br>  <br>That's pretty normal for western music stars.</br>  <br>I know they said all images were removed from all networked computers, but if I had images of a once in a lifetime event like naked Maria on TV I'd sure as hell make backups on a USB stick or DVD or something.</br>  <br> come into play later <br>But it's already come into play as an explanation for why Maria still performs and appears in public.<br><br>It's part of her characterization, but it's not nearly innocuous enough to be a Chekov's Gun (not even the right term) for sacrificing herself.  If anything, it foreshadows her breaking away from the deceit forced on her by the gubbamints, and publicising the details of the Frontier Incident so she can really atone for what she did. </br></br></br></br>  I want to bully her.  Thoughts on the OP  <br> After Hibiki gets her gear back. </br>  <br>Are you implying  Hibiki will get impaled with Gungnir again </br>  <br> that getup <br> those heels on those legs <br>   the hat <br>Be still my heart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's nice. The intro's a bit long, but I suspect they'll change that segment later on.</br>  <br>I want to invade her privacy  with my dick </br>  <br><br>Doesn't mean it's not embarrassing or painful.</br></br>   Song by Tubasa   <br>Will it be about swords, and feature Phara?</br>  <br>Can Tsubasa speak english well?</br>  <br>I like it, but I want to see what they do with it over the next few episodes. Was that what it'll be or do they have the budget to actually mix up the animation that goes with it a bit given that apparently the gears are getting fucked up? Maybe we'll get a somewhat different length too.</br>  <br>There's no way in hell they're going to change the gear designs again.</br>   Noise aren't actually Noise <br>I was actually somewhat wondering whether that would be the case or not until the end and it was made clear it was. The "blood" spray was a really damn obvious difference vs the old charcoal effect, but overall Sympgear has had such an improvement in animation and budget that I wasn't 100% positive that the animators hadn't just changed it around for the hell of it to look cooler. I've seen that happen in other series before, where some magic effect FX gets redone.<br><br>Actually that's my single disappointment so far: that neither of the girls mentioned that. Sure they were under pressure but they were combat vets who had fought countless numbers of those things, they should have instantly noticed that something was off. I'm not saying that it should have changed the ultimate result, they could have just said "hey these Noise are a little weird, but the die just fine anyway" and gotten a "good keep fighting", but some acknowledgement of it would have been nice and emphasized their experience. I'm guessing the studio just plain didn't think about it/forgot about it.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they'll actually get resurrected or anything as zombies if they return at all. Kanade is dust, remember? If anything, they will create dolls in their image or illusions and Tsubasa and Maria will have to prove they got over their deaths.</br>  <br>They just got destroyed though and they're apparently about to get a power up with some new Black tech. The entire scenario just screams "costume upgrade time". It's Nanoha A's again.</br>  <br>You don't upgrade the costumes literally one episode after introducing them, that's fucking retarded.<br>If they'd kept the G designs at first then yeah sure, but they didn't.</br></br>  <br>Agreed. I'd be surprised if the show engaged in any genuine "back from ze ded" level magic, but some sort of "trapped in your own memories"/illusion/dolls implanted with images from memories or whatever would fit in.</br>  <br>They already got their costume change. And the upgrade will only change their pendant designs. Look at the official website character designs and the opening. They will get pendants with wings.</br>  <br> only chlist_00 and chlist_01 are a thing <br>Aren't those pics just from before the new characters were revealed? There's no filename with the dolls and the existence of a static picture implies the list wasn't clickable yet.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the costume upgrade just consists of differently shaped pendants.</br>  <br>I think we're close enough to A's as it is without actually taking scenes from it.</br>  <br>There is no major difference from the G designs though, I didn't even notice anything at all at first. Face it:<br><br>1) New enemy wielding mysterious new power renders previous magic costume obsolete<br>2) In show of dominance new enemy stages surprise attack and destroys magic cores of previous costumes<br>3) New ally shows up to offer an entirely new power to defeat new enemy<br><br>Anon, that spells upgrade time no matter how you look at it. Maybe not a major upgrade but they're getting Cartridge System and Alternate Modes and will Surprise The Enemy in a rematch with their New Power. That's how it works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chris might be going full Mahou Shoujo, and Tsubasa might be going full Bike Massacre, but the Gear designs are not going to change at all. The only thing that's going to different is  and you're deluded to think otherwise.</br>  <br> Nana <br> good English </br></br>  <br> Look at the official website character designs and the opening <br>Would not be the first or last series to not reveal everything right off in either initial materials or OP. That's particularly true if the upgrade is an alt mode rather then an upgrade to their base look. Go rewatch the A's OP, no Sonic Form or Excelion there.</br></br>  <br> The only thing that's going to different is  and you're deluded to think otherwise. <br> what anime could do 10 years ago cannot be done at all let alone surpassed in 2015 <br>OK anon, guess we'll see then.</br></br></br>  <br>I want Phara to play with Zesshoushinai Sword.</br>  <br> there's no filename with the dolls <br>But there is.</br></br>  <br>It's not about whether they can do it, but whether they can be bothered.<br>Look at all the fucking promo materials they have for the current designs, why would they throw that all out with new ones?</br></br>  <br> There is no major difference from the G designs though, I didn't even notice anything at all at first. <br>There's more difference between G and GX designs than G and S1 designs.<br>They'll get Dainsleif upgrades but there won't be any visual overhaul besides the pendants.</br></br></br>  <br> why would they throw that all out with new ones <br>Again, see A's. They didn't throw out anything, but they did add alt-modes. Importantly they were genuine alt-modes, not straight upgrades, they had downsides because they were more focused so they didn't actually replace the old forms merely complement. Fate's Sonic Mode was needed to give her a chance against Signum through pure speed, but the lack of protection made it worthless against anything where speed didn't matter (like a massive bombardment attack). They also got a very minor visual tweak to their normal costumes too (cartridge system on their staffs). And only that tweak featured in the OP.<br><br>Not that we can ever be 100% sure but I don't see why you consider it impossible either given the exact same thing has happened before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AI FHEER YUU</br>  <br>I LOVE YOU</br>  TEN HOURS<br><br> ZERO PREVIEW PICS </br></br>  Will Hibiki fight this episode?  <br>Unlikely.<br>Why hasn't that pic been shopped into OPTIC BLAST?</br></br>  <br>miku's scream is arousing</br>  <br>I TRUST YOU</br>  If the Symphogear is bound to the relic, does that mean you could in theory have Tsubasa in Gungnir?  <br>HIKARI DEMO YAMI DEMO</br>  <br>We'll probably have to wait for something traumatic before her fist and life will be Symphogear again. Like if they attack her school or something. Or if they really want to set her off they could  kill Miku. </br>  <br>It also needs compatibility <br>Unless your a druggies</br></br>  <br>I can't remember exactly, but I don't think any diva can necessarily use any Symphogear, they have ones they resonate with specifically. If they can use another at all it'd probably be with much reduced effectiveness. Chris wasn't as good with Neshutan as Ichibal.</br>  <br>Oh right. LiNKER is the entire reason the FIS girls can't into correct Symphogear usage. <br><br>Damn, here I was hoping we'd get a costume switch at some point so that we could see Tsubasa with Gungnir, Yukine with Ame and Bikkie with Ichiaval.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't the druggies semi-compatible to begin with, just not to the level necessary to safely use their Gears?</br>  <br>Kanade had literally zero compatibility.</br>  <br>Nehushtan was an activated full relic though, its effectiveness had nothing to do with compatibility.<br><br>She sucked in it because it wasn't enough dakka.</br></br></br>  <br>Pls don't bully Nana, she tries hard to learn English.</br>  <br>No, they may or may not be. If they have some compatibility then the drugs will let them go farther (required for ultimate song), if they have none and it's 100% the drugs and GUTS then see Kanade for what happens eventually.</br>  <br>They do according to the keywords.<br>You can't just pick some random person off the streets and pump them full of Linker and hope they can wear a gear without dying.<br><br><br>Harmonizers:<br><br>Individuals whose songs resonate with a sacrist are capable of producing the "Chant" necessary to activate the Symphogear - they are called "Harmonizers."<br><br>Currently there are three categories of Harmonizers.<br><br>The first type are individuals like Tsubasa, Chris and Serena. They are born with an inherent aptitude which can become stable through proper training.<br><br>The second type are individuals like Kanade, Maria, Shirabe and Kirika. Although they are born with an inherent aptitude, training alone is not enough and they require doses of drugs in order to temporarily raise their link coefficient.<br><br>The third type is unique to a single individual, Hibiki. At first she became an Adaptor as a result of her body fusing with her sacrist after an accident. However, in Earth's eleventh hour, she became a true Harmonizer not through training or drugs, but by forcibly taking the necessary amount of link coefficiency.<br><br>Her transformation from a Sacrist Fusion to a Harmonizer is still a complete mystery. Despite attempts to research it, there has been little progress, and currently it is simply considered a miracle.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a miracle </br>  <br>This is why you don't get praised!</br>  <br>How I wish there were a symphogear x &lt;something&gt; fighting game on pc.</br>  <br> then see Kanade for what happens eventually. <br>But that was because Fine withheld LiNKER prior to the concert in a deliberate effort to get her killed.</br></br>  <br> tfw imagining I was playing as Tsubasa during the entirety of MGR </br>  <br>Her new song's lyrics would fit right in with MGR's.<br><br> Commander, release my voice inhibitors! </br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that the Rules Of Nature shuttle suplex video got DMCA'd off youtube and nobody has a webm of it.</br></br>  Symphogear GX just announced 20 minute episode 3 delay<br> Countdown in here http://pastebin.com/EeTkSpKa </br>  <br> 20 minute delay <br>I can live with that.</br></br>  <br>Didn't we already know that though?

Or whoever made it will reupload somewhere.<br><br><br>Depends. They were probably holding back during the whole NIS thing due to worries about the future and HARD LIFE so they're probably in their honeymoon phase right and thus going at it like rabbits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they're kids.

Can I choose Hibari instead?</br>  Thanks to the anon that made those Symphogear icons, finally got around to using them.  What is it about Symphogear villains that makes them so annoying? It's been 2 episodes and I already want to punch Carol into a brick wall.  <br>Why are their summer uniforms so slutty</br>  <br>If they killed Miku, I would not be able to continue watching. It would be a far too painful experience. With the other gear users, the possibility has always been there so I've come to accept it. But not with Miku. She doesn't deserve such a cruel fate.</br>  <br>Because authors are Street Fighter fans.</br>  <br>Those two should be in prision all the time not going to school. They don't deserve that happyness.</br>  <br>do they go to school on daytime and are in prison at night?</br>  Will anything ever top the hype and insanity that was Mikugear?    <br>It seems that's the case. I can understan they let them go to school but I don't know who is the idiot who let them go out with their armors</br>  What is a symphogear?    <br>probably an intern or someone who's fucking retarded</br>  <br>Alchemist Miku, Dáinsleif Miku, ninja Miku, or track star Miku, pick your poison.</br>  <br>Why? They helped save the world and get rid of the Noise for good. They deserve nothing but happiness together.</br>  <br>They're pretty harmless without linker though.</br>  <br>gay powered armor.</br>  <br>I guess they forgot what Genjuro told Shirabe in S2E11.</br>  <br>Genjuro knows they're better off somewhere they can keep track of things and hop in as last-minute-heroes should shit go down.<br><br>I want them to have a training montage, led by Miku as Genjuro's busy holding down the fort.</br></br></br>  <br> training montage <br> led by Miku <br>I'm not sure that's a good idea, Kirika's a bit dim and might not realise that scythes can't be thrown like javelins.</br></br></br>  Is Chris a slav? What race is she supposed to be?  <br>Miku knows how to deal with dense geahs.</br>  Only 4 more hours until the preview is out.  <br>Maria is, Chris was born in Japan, even though her parrents seem to have been gaijins</br>  <br>I want to adopt Chris.</br>    <br>Chris' dad was japanese.</br>  <br>Her last name means she must at least have part japanese lineage from her father's side.</br>  <br>Steam-kun not earning his pay here.</br>  <br>MODS MODS</br>  I'm enjoying this as much as the previous seasons, but honestly, the songs are bad, and badly placed. Maybe I'm spoiled from Ar Tonelico, but they just detract from the experience for me.  <br>Ar tonelico is pretty much a completely different beast though. Much more mythical with all the conlang songs.<br>I think the cheesy pop songs fit Symphogear perfectly.</br></br>  <br>Chris' mother's name is Sonnet•M•Yukine.</br>  <br> Maria dies. <br> PLEASE GIVE ME THE STRENGHT FOR ONE LAST SWING. <br> THE REASON WHY, I CAN FIIIIGHT. <br><br>It needs to happen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're married, she took on his last name.

They feel mass-produced, so to speak.</br>  <br>It seems to me that DMJii are StS NanoFate gay where they're are so blatantly gay that nobody even has to question it anymore. HibiMiku are just getting into the stage of their relationship where they can blindly trust each other. By the end of the season they'll certainly reach DMJii's level and maybe even surpass it  if Bikki doesn't die for her trying. </br>  <br>Because they colaborated in putting it in danger also, no one evere remembers all those random people, cops and dead kids. And they had the resolve to kill people if necessary to fulfill their plans.<br><br>Sure crazy scientist was more responsable than anyone else, but they had their part of responsability too.</br></br></br>  <br> no one evere remembers all those random people, cops and dead kids <br>Not only does that also fully apply to Chris (much more in fact), but we don't even know the full details of the internal and external negotiations that happened after the end of G. It's not like Maria and DMJii aren't being punished for their actions, far from it in fact.<br><br> And they had the resolve to kill people if necessary to fulfill their plans. <br>Only other Gears in the case of DMJii. If anything, Maria's the only one of the 3 who does any actual human killing, and even that is out of desperation or accidentally via simply not getting a hold of herself (like in the Noise simulation, which in itself is an argument in favor of the two idiots).<br><br> but they had their part of responsability too <br>You can thank Maria and especially Mom for that. Kirika in particular was absolutely ready to rebel around episode 4, but that would've brought them absolutely nowhere while also endangering Mom and the world. If anything, this leads to some interesting ideas with regards to Kirika's and Shirabe's polar opposite types of desperation in the final episodes of G.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not only does that also fully apply to Chris (much more in fact) <br>Chris never used the Cane to set Noise on civilians, or even soldiers. Fine did all of that.</br></br>  What happened to based Ver again?<br>Did they put him in Symphoprison?</br>  <br>He's serving his time for now. We haven't heard anything about him since he was captured.</br>  <br>He escaped and started plotting with an angry little girl who dresses like a witch.</br>  <br><br>If his VA is going to lives there's no way he wont get a word in this season.</br></br>  They will need Ver to fix the gears with alchemy.  <br>Chris would make an excellent daughter.</br>    <br>Do we have confirmation that Sugita is going to be there?</br>  <br>he was amazing 2013 so they would be stupid not to invite him</br>  <br><br>He isn't casted at all this season, Sugita is working on other stuff so no Ver for you.</br></br>  One hour until preview  <br>Inb4 suffering.</br>  <br>Inb4 episode of cute SoL.</br>  Inb4 the first screenshot is Genjuro and Chris in a classroom  <br>in whichever episode the Parent day will be, I hope Tsubasa's also present at Lydian</br>  She's so damn angry all the time.

They don't do it any more.</br>  <br>I'm afraid she's going to be  EXTERMINATEd .</br>  <br>That's the  song to destroy the world  though, so unfortunately that alone makes me think she'll be befriended and help everyone else fight off whoever ends up being the 'real' villain.</br>  <br>I don't believe your lies.</br>  <br>No cuddling allowed in hospital beds though.</br>    <br>such a shitty picture</br>  <br> Chris' foot <br>Not even a footfag, but it looks really rushed.</br></br>  <br>Tsubasa' hip look stupid.<br>No charm point.<br>Christ's leg<br><br>1/10.</br></br></br></br></br>  We need a collage with every Carol face, similar to the Shirabe one.<br><br>It shall be used for Carol-bullying purposes.</br></br>  <br>I don't think dolls can eat<br> I can never feed Garie and Micha <br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br> similar to the Shirabe one. <br>post pls</br></br>    <br>It's glorious</br>  I want to fuck Garie.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128210389 <br>Fuck off.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128210389 <br>1/10.

His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called "Titans" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted "Titan Survey Corps" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what "freedom" means to him in a new world ruled by fear.<br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br> Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead <br> It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life <br> During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack <br> It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on <br> Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him <br> At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly <br><br><br>Is there more?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mikasa:the movie  <br>Also new reaction images for us.<br><br><br>I think it's so delusional it's funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br>no</br></br>  <br>Nice shitposting general.</br>  <br>http://special.movies.yahoo.co.jp/d<wbr>etail/20150716387704/<br><br>New full trailer on Yahoo Japan</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Can't open it at the moment, Is there anything worth mentioning?</br>  <br>Who gives a shit, any news on the 2nd recap movie?</br>  <br>it looks awful<br>oh dear god</br></br>  <br>Armin and Mikasa run with goats<br><br>New giants cartoon animation <br><br>fuller look at titans running<br><br>Mikasa holding a baby and crying <br><br>Hanji teaching<br><br>New name intros<br><br>New RT scene <br><br>Mikasa and Shikishima kissing full scene</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.

Mikasa got butthurt and fucked notLevi.</br>  EM WINS AGAIN  <br>What would real Mikasa do if manlet tried to kiss her?</br>  <br>Seeing that manlet is too short to reach her lips, she'd probably kick the stool he's standing on.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128172763 <br>what the actual fuck</br>  <br>She'd rip off his micropenis and shove it down his throat.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128175407 <br>They fucked and she's pregnant. Get over it. NotLevi will sacrifice himself for her like a true husbando and Eren will help her raise a baby that isn't his like the master cuck he is. Every night when Eren inserts his flaccid penis inside Mikasa a single tear will roll down her cheek as she reflects about her one and only true lover.</br>  <br> Mikasa goes tsundere </br>  God I want to ship EM but i just cant ughh  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128176193 <br>Everyone will sing praise about LM's romantic performance. It will surpass Titanic and The Notebook and go down in history as the best romance story ever told.</br>  Manlet and Mikasa are the worst shingekis of all time  <br>hetscum pls. Mikasa licks Eren's pussy every night.</br>  so did any of the titans from the invasion of Trost become shifters when they ate those pieces of Eren?<br>Maybe not the arm because it got lost, but a leg definitely got gone</br>  <br>No because they have to eat and digest the spine.</br>  <br>You have to eat the shifter not the titan body.</br>  <br>You have to eat the spine in order to be a shifter</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128176721 <br>I know it's reverse shitposting, but I still threw up in my mouth after reading this post.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128176721 <br>Separately they are still terrible characters</br>  <br>I can see it coming<br><br> the new red shirts get introduced <br> Survey Corps arrive at Shiganshina  <br> BR and MT show up <br> a bunch of red shirts + maybe Keith and/or Marlo die <br> Eren puts up a decent fight but ends up getting kidnapped <br> Mikasa goes crazy <br> Manlet tells her to calm down <br> Erwin says that saving Eren is the most important thing to do for mankind <br> end of chapter </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget<br> introduce like 10 new characters that are barely named <br> kill them all within a chapter while redshirts look scared <br> pretend like this is novel and interesting </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you Nifa's death still haunts me</br>  <br>literally who<br>there's like dozens of throwaway characters I don't remember</br></br>    <br>How can you not remember Armin's  good  twin?</br>  <br><br>Best imouto.</br></br>  <br> Armin's good twin? <br><br>Wasn't that Historia?</br></br></br>  <br>Next season is going to suck</br>  <br>She's just fodder and wasn't even that cute.</br>  I still wonder why manlet opened up to Nifa. It seemed out of character for him to tell someone something specific about his past. He could've just had an inner-monologue to fill the reader in on his relationship with Kenny, but him opening up to her still feels kind of odd to me.  <br>Oh yeah, Petra 2.0<br>but seriously why are there so many short light haired white girls gettin wasted</br></br>  <br>There was no relationship. He later told everyone about Kenny and that he was an Ackerman like Mikasa.<br><br>Manlet only cares about Erwin and pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Hanjo the banjo.</br>  <br>What? He clearly said he lived with him as a kid, that's called describing a relationship to someone else. I never said they had a caring relationship. I just said him bringing up Kenny and telling Nifa that he knows him is strange. <br><br>And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. The first time he actually referred to himself as an Ackerman was when Kenny was dying. It's doubtful Isayama would pass up illustrating Mikasa's reaction when she finds out.</br></br></br>  <br>Hinting at his troubled past is how Levi flirts.</br>  <br>It's possible he was going to follow that up with<br> yeah, so I know he's pretty dangerous and might try to blow people's heads off <br>but didn't quite get it out in time</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about Levi's relationship with Nifa, that she was nothing really special to him.</br>  So, I was considering why Grisha went after the Reiss family and I began to wonder whether MT is really the bad guy. If we consider that Grisha himself was the coordinate (i.e. The end goal of a mission) then it opens up a few possibilities. That MT was after Grisha because he was dangerous and that Grisha seized the Reiss power to further his goals. I think Grisha attempted to pass his ideology to Eren in the same way that the First King passed his to the Reiss family.  <br> And I don't think he told anyone in his squad that he's an Ackerman yet. <br>I think he already had his suspicions about it. He did say that he had the same Ackerman power Kenny and Mikasa had.</br></br>  <br>Why would Mikasa care? It's only if it affects Eren in some way. I think the Ackerman line is done and Isayama is going to focus on Mikasa's Asian side next.</br>  <br>Kek.</br>  <br>Grisha implied to Eren that life outside the walls was utter shit and it seemed he wanted to change that, so I think he was an ends justify the means type of good guy. <br><br>With MT's casual disregard to life though I can't see him as a good guy.</br></br></br>  <br>What did Ymir and Historia rank?</br>  <br>Yeah he had a hunch but now he knows for sure. <br><br><br>She spent half the series having a one sided grudge against Levi. Isayama would probably get a kick out of illustrating her reaction to finding out they're related. I do agree he's going to focus on the Asian clan, hopefully, but I do think Levi will properly tell his squad about it when it becomes relevant again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>69</br>  <br>That would make sense though. Grisha wants to destroy all the people outside the walls. When he saw how well life worked within the walls he reaffirmed his position and is going to try to set Eren up as the new King, after giving him the ability to control titans<br><br>MT on the other hand only has shown a casual disregard for the people within the walls, which he considers similar to animals in a pen.</br></br></br>  <br>Lewd.</br>  <br><br>1) Eren<br>2) Manlet<br>3) Erwin<br>4) Hanji<br>5) Mikasa<br>6) Jean<br>7) Nanaba<br>8) Armin<br>9) Bert <br>10) Historia<br>11) Reiner<br>12) Annie<br>13) Mike<br>14) Marco<br>15) Erd<br>16) Sasha<br>17) Connie<br>18) Ymir<br>19) Moblit<br>20) Gunter</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isayama would probably get a kick out of illustrating her reaction to finding out they're related <br>I guess it does have the potential to make her reaction amusing, but I'm not sure she would be that shocked, especially if she already has a hunch about their connection. Then there's the fact that Mikasa has been developing little by little, and she shows more respect and trust towards the manlet.</br></br>  <br>Good to see Historia in the top ten. Is she getting more popular again?</br>  <br> Nanaba <br> Bert <br> Mike <br> Marco <br> Erd <br> Moblit <br> Gunter <br>The troll votes are stronk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The pole was full of proxyfags and let each person vote 5 times besides, so it's pretty worthless as a judge of anything. <br><br>Also the top 3 all had tens of thousands of votes, while those below that only had a few thousand at most.</br></br></br>  <br>She just had an entire nearly all about her. Of course she's going to be more popular.</br>  <br>Bert has ranked in the top ten in every poll since Clash.</br>  <br>Eren, Manlet, Hange, Erwin and Mikasa usually always make the top 5.</br>  <br> she shows more respect and trust towards the manlet <br>That's true, but she did smile when he got punched so I think a little grudge remains. I find her reactions funny and it's ironic how someone she initially hated is now connected to her. It could be pretty funny if Isayama decides to bring it up. Levi figured out he was an Ackerman, but I'm not sure if Mikasa caught on yet. It could still come as a shock to have their connection confirmed.</br></br>  will BRA ever be together again  <br>They were never together to begin with. Annie was a lone wolf who clearly thought little of Reiner and Bert outside the job.</br>  <br>I'm betting no. It seems like Isayama's setting them up as semi-sympathetic characters, so you feel bad for them when they never meet up again</br>  <br>I think even with that considered, aside from Nanaba the positions are pretty believable.</br>  <br>I hope they will reunite somehow</br>  <br>They are literally made for each other.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128184404   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128184404 <br>Not on my watch.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128184787 <br>Historia wants Eren's dick. Accept the canon truth.</br>  <br> Eren <br> having a dick <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Historia wants her</br>  <br><br>EH will give us Freedom from the tyranny of the EM and YH fags.</br></br>  <br>Does anyone honestly think EH has any chance of happening with given how much the anime, the spoof and even the chibi spinoff push for EM?</br>  <br>I think Eren's going to die, so it doesn't matter who he gets paired off with.</br>  <br>I think Isayama is going for a sibling-like relationship for EH considering Eren pretty much carries Frieda's memories with him.</br>  <br>The spoofs and spinoffs are made for laughs and EM being mutually canon is the biggest joke of all.</br>  <br>anti-bert fags btfo</br>  <br>They also show that Mikasa would pretty much kill herself if Eren ends up with someone else.</br>  Is Mikasa regarded as best girl here?  <br>She's the worst, actually.</br>  <br>Didanwhisperer pls</br>  <br>seriously speaking it's probably either hange or historia, leaning on hange</br>  <br>Hange &gt; Annie &gt; Sasha &gt; Mikasa &gt; Ymir &gt; Historia</br>  <br>Manlet pls.</br>  <br> Mange <br> girl <br>pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I find her the most attractive one but she really needs something going on for her character besides "MUH EREN"<br><br>Best female character is definitely Hange.</br></br></br>  I can see YH happening, but I cannot for the life of me see Eren returning Mikasa's feelings. It's canon that Mikasa has a crush on Eren, but their relationship isn't romantically canon and I don't think it ever will be and that's why EMfags are just as delusional as the rest of the shippers. Eren never showed romantic interest in her, he never really showed much interest in her at all. He cares about her and wants to protect her because they have history together and they've been through a lot, but I don't think this equals to romantic love on his part. Eren will either die or the series will end without any romantic development for them. <br><br>Isayama said time and time again that he doesn't want to disappoint his fans. Do you really think he'd pair up fujobait like Eren up with a woman? Never. He's going to keep them all single.</br></br>  <br>Manlet is the one calling her shit glasses and smelly tranny. Moblit is triggered so he shitposts against manlet.</br>  <br>It doesn't matter because all the characters are fucking dying in the end.</br>  <br>I wanna pork Carla</br>  <br> Isayama said time and time again that he doesn't want to disappoint his fans <br>Then let us hope he browses these threads and knows how much Annie is loved (and life and a miracle of the universe) and doesn't kill her off horribly.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128186397 <br>We should start an official EMYH alliance</br>  <br>Eren is just a generic clueless shonen MC. He cannot return her feelings until the very end because nobody really wants to see the two of them dating in a series about killing titans.<br><br>Besides, Mikasa's dick is already too thirsty for Eren for her to develop romantic feelings towards somebody else.</br></br></br>  Since LM fucked in the live action movie i'm taking it as implied endgame.  <br>Fuck I feel bad for him, normally I hate charaters who are edgy and brooding for no reason but if I was Levi I would be bitter as well.</br>  <br>You could if that were manlet and not some OC.</br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>I'm not saying Mikasa will develop feelings for anyone else. I'm just saying her love will likely remain unrequited. If you hadn't noticed by now, Isayama loves that crap. Mikasa got a thing for Eren, I'm not denying that, but I just don't see him returning her feelings. It would be strange if they kept up the relationship they have now and then suddenly became official last minute. There needs to be some build up, so I don't think he's going to abruptly return her feelings at the very end. It would feel forced and random to make something like that official when Eren didn't show any straight-forward signs of liking her romantically throughout the entire series.</br>  <br> They called Levi an OC so it wouldn't spoil the manga audience. </br>  <br>So they made the most popular character of the series an OC just for the sake of shipfaggotry?</br>  <br>nah<br>It's Petra</br></br>  <br> red shirt  <br> best girl </br></br>  <br>Haven't you noticed by now that all Japanese directors are shipperfags?</br>  <br>She was so brave.</br>  <br>Just think of that broken spine and crushed organs. Her death is one of the best in the series.</br>  <br>noble to the end</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks, Annie</br></br></br>    <br>I love you Petra<br>good night sweet princess</br></br>  <br>You say that as if it's shocking or something.</br>  <br>Mikasa is shit. Every other girl is better than her, Mikasa's only advantage is that she's the most attractive but that's it. She might even be the worst character overall.</br>  Best looking females<br>Historia &gt; Frieda &gt; Carla &gt;&gt; Mikasa &gt; Sasha &gt; Not-Annie &gt; Annie &gt; Anka &gt; Mina &gt; Petra &gt;&gt;&gt; Hanji &gt; Ymir=Ilse</br>  <br>I never realized how much the guy in the second panel looks like a titan there.

Armin and Eren look more like females than male.</br>  <br>Thank you Annie</br>  <br>I hope by "brooding for no reason" you're not referring to Levi, because then I'd have to question whether or not you missed the entirety of his backstory. I'd say he has more reason than anyone to be brooding.</br>  <br>Yeah because he's fujobait and we all know the popular fujobaits must suffer the most.</br>  <br>I thought he was sad because of his landwhale following.</br>  <br>That anon said he felt bad for him and would be bitter too if he were him, meaning he understands manlet has his reasons for being the way he is. He just worded it weirdly.</br>  <br>I woudn't say Levi is edgy.</br>  Young grisha reminds me of that dude from MT's chapter  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128185585 <br> Falling for this bait <br>No wonder they say Ymirfags are dumb.

Or was she already confirmed?</br></br>  <br>She was confirmed a while ago.</br>  Best cover story aside from From the Decks of the World.  Do you guys think bellamy will actually become a crew member? he seems like the most likely out of dressrosa at the least.  <br>at this point yes he is the strongest candidate<br><br>but<br> redundant power set <br> may wind up with Law because tattoo <br> Viola still a strong contender <br> he's kind of a fucking loser </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More likely to join Laws crew because<br><br>1. His chest tattoo can easily be changed to Laws.<br><br>2. He originally joined Doffy for being the pride of the North Blue, Law is also from the North Blue.<br><br>3. He wants to survive the great wave mentioned in pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be no-one from Dressrosa.</br>  <br><br>That and I can't imagine Nami being comfortable with it. Though Luffy wouldn't listen to protests anyway.</br></br>  <br>Second best you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>He's going to go an adventure alone to find his true self.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Oda paired Jinbei and Sanji up in FMI to convey them as equals. While I feel like Jinbei is stronger, I pair them together still because they're similar and close in general.<br> <br>Jinbei's body is naturally better at handling something like that. He's much larger and possibly has organs spaced out more/differently. Like with Ace, Sakazuki's magmafist is large in comparison to the torso and therefore is much more likely to kill Zoro/Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> Viola still a strong contender <br>Anon you could have made sense if you just didn't add this.</br></br>  <br> was a consenting member of the pirate crew the marines are arresting <br> first girl to actually like sanji back <br> unique and practical powerset <br> unique group dynamic (isn't a slut) <br> Rebecca can be princess in her stead </br></br></br></br></br>  so is sabo strong, or is burger weak?<br><br>is sabo possibly as strong as doffy? stronger?<br><br>do you think sabo is stronger than g4 luffy? (obviously he would win a 1v1 either way, he'd outlast like doffy did most likely)</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd be better off with Law.</br>  <br>All of that is irrelevant. And Rebecca can't become the queen, legally she isn't allowed to. Honestly, Rebecca has a more likely chance of joining than Viola.</br>  <br> legally <br><br>they JUST overthrew the government...</br></br></br>  <br>If he's the second strongest member of the revolutionaries it would make sense that he can beat somebody who's only like the 5th or 6th strongest member of a yonkou crew. <br><br>Sabo is probably around Marcos lever.</br></br></br>  <br> Has a fruit that ruins every part of adventure and exploration. <br><br>You can't honestly think Sanji will finally get what he wants right?</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter. She may be blood to Riku, but her mother abandoned the throne. She wasn't born into royalty. She's just a regular woman. And I really don't see her becoming the princess. Viola's powers are more suited for keeping the kingdom under a watchful eye, which would fit with One Piece's way of doing things after an arc or with cover stories. Plus, why do you want someone who can see what's coming ahead before it happens? That's not what Luffy would want.</br>  <br>Viola is so similar to Robin though. Monet/Perona would have been a nice change-up.</br>  <br> lever </br>  <br>They're pulling each others levers all day anon. You can't deny it.</br>  <br>Agreed, not saying she's the best most interesting possible new female nakama, just that she has a good chance.</br>   people still think Straw Hats are getting a new crewmember out of this <br>nobody in Dressrosa stood out except Law and he's not joining</br>  <br>Brook was the first one to sacrifice himself.</br>  <br>Honestly, after the Paulie feint, I don't even pretend to know who Oda's going to have join or not.</br>  <br>You mean after Robin, right?</br>  <br>Actually, regardless of who did what and when, in the end the order of royalty will go by bloodline. I don't remember who was older, Viola or Rebecca's mom, but whoever was older would rule next. I believe Viola. If Rebecca's mom was older then at the moment next in line is Rebecca (followed by Viola of Rebecca dies before birthing kids).</br>  <br>it was rebeccas mom, she's next in line.<br><br>I wish that kyros became king though, hes able to protect his country with strengh if he has to, and hes nice like king riku. just seems ideal</br></br></br>  <br>He can't. Not a drop of royal blood. But, he can rule by proxie, more or less, as an advisor to his daughter.<br><br>I agree he is strong, but is he wise enough yet? It's true that we see a transition of him going from hooligan to an actual asset to the crown. And while that does take scruples to be picked up or developed, I doubt he's fully there yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Jango's Dance Paradise a  underrated but still not better than Miss Goldenweek's </br>  <br>Ha! That was one of those Oda stunts that left a deep impression on me. I felt so confused when it first happened.</br>  <br>I like how those two overlapped through coverstories. The bromance formed between Jango and Fullbody and the fun of it makes it my favourite. Baroque Works one was also enjoyable though.</br>  <br>I want him to join up with Barto and Cavendish as a Strawhat fanboy</br>  what will be sanjis new secret technique that puts him back in the top 3 strongest strawhat? <br><br>Honestly though the monster trio has become very broken, zorro is miles ahead of sanji and luffy is on a whole level entirely compared to the rest of crew ( just like every other captain)<br><br>I think the new monster trio is going to be ussop zorro sanji once ussop and sanji get their shit together</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I can't really pick a favourite.</br>  <br> not Zoro, Franky and Sanji <br>they're the heavy hitters that aren't Luffy. Chopper could also be up there if he was better at actually fighting.</br></br>  <br> x=26+x <br><br>Iva taught him how to wink REALLY hard<br><br>or him being able to fly is really handy for Godzilla sized bosses</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daz is the most underrated cutie<br><br>Does ANYONE have a more adorable dream?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks, Law and Kuzan suddenly got really hot<br><br>Honorable mention to Helmeppo</br></br></br>  <br>Sarkies was the one that Doflamingo controlled to cut down (and presumably kill at that time) Bellamy.</br>  <br> 1. The first timeskip that occurred was when luffy was 10 and higuma was the first named character to be killed and the next named character was Lacuba at the slave house who bit his tongue. <br>Pretty sure it was Roshio actually.</br></br>  Aokiji isn't actually allied with Blackbeard is he? He must have some sort of scheme.  <br>probably</br>  <br>There must be something else, however I don't see Kuzan betraying BB, because BB is not the kind of guy one would be truly be surprised to see outsmarted, imho Kuzan will try to use BB to destroy the WG.</br>  <br>He is, but not for the purpose of supporting him.</br>  <br>I know Luffy is stronger than the others but I can't see Zoro being too entirely far behind. He's scary when he wants to be.</br>  I'm looking for a new anime but I'm hesitant to watch one piece as I watched it as a child and I didn't like it.<br><br>I've only just got into anime and my favourite so far is fairy tail. I like childish humor and strong emotion, fairy tail made me cry and cheer and I'm hoping one piece will do the same what do you guys think are they similar?</br></br>  <br>I think you're a faggot for liking Fairy Tail.</br>    <br>I'm a girl.</br>  <br>I'm a prettier girl.</br>  <br>If you really are an animeonlyfag then watch the first 310 episodes but then switch to the manga. But beware that you will quickly come to realize that Fairy Tail is utter shit compared to One Piece.</br>  <br>Why didn't you like it?</br>  <br>Doubtful. Since you're so boastful I'll let you post a timestamped picture of yourself first.<br><br>9/10 average on /soc/ let's see you.</br></br></br>  <br>After watching and reading One Piece for years I started watching Fairy Tail and it really is inferior to One Piece in pretty much every category.</br>  <br>It creeped me out, the main character how he stretched his body, I was 10 or 11.</br>  <br>So you didn't like One Piece because of a rubber boy's ability to stretch? I mean if you're half mature now, then that wont even matter. Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece.</br>  <br>And you've probably seen the dub right?</br>  <br> Fairy Tail Shanks is pre-timeskip Shanks <br>Deep.</br></br>  <br>4kids dub undoubtedly.</br>  <br>Yes, it left a sour taste. That picture is interesting. I'll take your advice than and give it a chance.<br><br><br>Yes, does that matter? I can't really watch subs unless I mute it which makes it unwatchable the language puts me off.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep thinking there's gonna be another crew member? Luffy said he only wanted 10 people in his crew at the start:<br><br>1. Luffy<br>2. Zoro<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Sanji<br>6. Chopper<br>7. Robin<br>8. Franky<br>9. Brook<br>10.  Thousand Sunny </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dub is the reason you didnt liked it in the first place, that wasnt one piece, go and watch the sub now and see you in 2 or 3 weeks after finished, go and search some page who show you what chapters are fillers and what you can see so yo can watch like 100 less chapters</br>  <br>luffy doesnt count</br>  <br>As much as I really like the idea of Bellamy joining after all these years and becoming a good guy, he's going to end going with Law. The whole 'dark past with Doflamingo' and the tattoo just kind of seal the deal.<br><br>Either that, or he's going to go off on his own and make his own crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Burgess is strong as shit. Sabo is just stronger, and that whole scene was just Burgess being a jobber to hype up Sabo.</br>  <br>Luffy said that he wanted 10 nakama/crewmates. That doesn't include himself.<br>1. Zoro<br>2. Sanji<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Chopper<br>6. Robin<br>7. Franky<br>8. Brook<br><br>That leaves two spots.<br>Jinbei is pretty much confirmed, leaving just one more opening. Oda also said some time post timeskip that there would be more members joining the crew (so likely the two final ones), and he said they'd show up successively.<br><br>Jinbei is highly likely to actually connect and properly join at Zou (next arc), and it'd be likely that we get someone from the following arc based on what Oda said, meaning Wano. I personally think it'll either be Kinemon, some samurai or  Monet if she's somehow alive </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure Jimbei all but confirmed joining the crew, he only had "something to do" which prevented him from joining at that point.<br><br>Now that he has the Poneglyph he'll probably join up the next time they meet.</br></br></br></br>  Oda said there would be more crewmates coming.<br><br>I think that there will be 12 of them at the very, very max at the end of OP.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I was saying.<br><br>Luffy asked him to join and he accepted, and especially now with the poneglyph, I don't know how anyone could deny it.</br></br></br>  <br>Jimbe refused to go simply because his presence in the crew would make future fights extremely trvial for quite some time. Oda obviously wants Jimbe to be in the crew but cannot allow it until the Strawhats and their enemies reach Jimbe's level. That way, his sudden power introduction wouldn't be so jarring.</br>  <br>Good thing we're about to reach the Yonkous now isn't it.</br>  <br>The stalling was pretty smart. Jinbei's current bounty exceeds Luffy's, so atleast post-Dressrosa will raise Luffy's to 550 million or so, giving Jinbei's some room without encroaching Luffy's too much.</br>  <br>Luffy and zoro are already shown to be stronger than jimbei already. He is stronger than sanji but weaker than zoro.</br>  <br>No, they aren't. Jimbe is still in a league of his own and is a former Shichibukai. I doubt that Zoro can bat Doflamingo on his own, and Luffy was barely able to do it.</br>  <br>And I don't see jinbei beating doffy either.</br>  <br>Xusasu Basasu got his ass kicked by Ace earlier, and then got his ass kicked by Sabo. He's supposed to be strong, but definitely isn't as strong as the number 2 of the Revolutionaries. <br><br>Sabo is likely around Admiral tier, and Xusasu is likely somewhere below that, though probably a bit higher than Luffy.</br></br></br>  Jimbei did mention "things", so maybe there's something other than the Poneglyph.  <br>Robin used to be so hot.</br>  I understand some hype around Monet given personal preferences and taste. Im not particularly fond of her character in any way but hey. <br><br>However, I fail to understand how, not being driven by one's own doujin wishes, would somebody think she is anywhere near being a new crewmember.</br></br>  <br>Had to go help that kitten.</br>  <br> not living a life being driven by one's own doujin wishes </br>  <br><br>In/near water Jinbei is more than likely to win.</br></br>  <br>Ace was a deadly logia who was the second division commander of a yonkou, while Blackbeard's crewmates were just newish recruits of Blackbeard who were probably strong back in the blues/early GL. Of course they'd have nothing on Ace back then, same goes for the SHs including Luffy. <br><br>Sabo is under admiral level; around Doflamingo I'd say. Jesus is strong, yes, but I'd put him equal to or a bit below Luffy now that he has G4.<br><br>Still though; Burgess isn't weak. Losing to a very strong character =/= weak, despite what many people seem to think.<br><br><br>That's the ties to Big Mom he's got to cut, but where is Big Mom right now? Dressrosa/Zou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> used to be <br>she is even hotter now</br></br>  <br>Robin's in her hotness prime currently.</br>  <br>She used to be the prettiest and most unique-looking woman in all anime and manga. Now she's just a generic hottie. I miss those bangs.</br>  How strong was Roger really?<br><br>He could hear sea kings, rivaled WB without any known devil fruit and commanded a legend like Rayleigh.<br><br>Still, I'd find it hilarious if it all turned out to be some red herring and Roger was extremely weak winning all his fights by pure luck.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Roger recruited Buggy because he reminded him of himself. Buggy will be the next Pirate King </br></br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope.</br></br>  <br>What's up with Luffy's left arm? (His left, our right)</br>  <br>Buggy vs God Usopp<br><br>Who wins?</br></br></br>  <br>It's just shrouded by the stream produced by Gear Second.</br>  <br><br>Usopp and all the dolls he rescued in Dressrosa<br><br>Vs.<br><br>Buggy and all the criminals from Impel down</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one true god.</br>  <br>I miss her too. She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br><br>Big boobs don't always make things better.</br></br></br>  <br> She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br>eeeeeh, sorry but when she first appeared she looked awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br>You like a little Miss All-Sunday hey?</br>  <br>Yeah but how is he holding it? Is it bent or is cut off from our view? There's also a weird bulge near the armpit.</br>  <br>On paper Buggy seems like an incredibly powerful pirate.<br> is a Shichibukai <br> was on Gol Rodgers crew <br> long time childhood friends with a Yonkou <br> part of one of the only successful escapes from Impel Down <br> leads tons of powerful pirates <br> was part of the Whitebeard War of the Greatest <br>The man's resume packs a punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Chopper and Robin are the only Straw Hats left that don't have a Number chapter. Chopper's The Sixth seems to be related to some sort of Vegapunk arc, but Robin's The Seventh is ambiguous. You'd think her chapter would have been during Enies Lobby, but it wasn't. So what's left for her? Her guilt about Vivi? Something about the Poneglyphs regarding the Will of D.?  <br>And then you realize he's just like Zonge.</br>  <br> Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece. <br>That's a severe overstatement<br>Fairy tail is repetitive titty bait and a poor man's dbz (muh courage, muh resolution, muh friends, muh powerlevels)<br>One piece has actually got plot and interesting characters with reasons behind their actions</br></br></br></br>  <br>I started reading before Water Seven, stopped due to circumstances, and then came back after Enies Lobby. I honestly don't understand how people thought Paulie would join, I never got that vibe from him at all.</br>  <br>This cover always reminded me of a cover from death note where this leather wearing chick had her fiance killed by Yagami<br>Anyway, yes, I do miss that Robin<br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Paulie was cool and all, but Franky was so obvious and much more prominent. I wonder if Oda made this coverpage as a joke about all the Pauliefags.</br>  <br>Didn't this fat fuck Zombe get fucked by a monkey?</br>  <br>poor guy</br>  <br>Sure did.</br>  <br>Numerous times, he literally passed out from all the hot monkey king sex</br>  <br><br><br>I feel sick.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I'm sure he enjoyed every second of it<br><br>Oh fuck off already</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Need the good doctor to make you feel better?</br>  So Law's sacrificial immortality power confirms his death before the end of the series right? Or will he 'die' and come back?  <br>Likely die and come back. People always dying and coming back. Still half expecting Ace to come back.</br>  <br> 550 million <br><br>that's waaaay too high. Like holy shit, compare the shit he did at Impel Down and the Tenryuubito Punch and think about the fact that it's supposedly very hard to raise your bounty once you get over 300m, there's no way his bounty is going to be raised like that right after Dressrosa  assuming that's what you were saying </br></br></br>  <br>If they're going to even raise it, it's going to be 450.</br>  <br>Probably do one more arc wrapping up the other crew members then raise it.</br>  <br>i think you can argue that Luffy's bounty was low if you consider the shit he has done. Pre-timeskip luffy was dangerous due to his recklessness but still wasn't seen as that much of threat because he was kinda weak (compared to strongest wg forces). Now though, he's also really strong, so i think a really high bounty would be acceptable.</br>   Monet will never poop on your car   <br>I do think a very high bounty would fit him, I'm arguing whether or not raising it suddenly like that would make sense, and in my opinion it will take AT LEAST one other arc to get close to 550 mln</br>  <br><br>Also the WG covered up the Alabasta/Enies Lobby incidents pretty well.</br></br>  <br>And this time they can't cover it up really cause of ole crazy eyes.</br>  <br>She will be someone to Sanji like Kaya is to Usopp. She will stay.</br>  <br>Why? He's more of a threat as of now to the WG than Ace ever was. <br> Come back two years later and is a fuckton stronger (acknowledged by Sentoumaru) <br> Now has another two kingdoms allied to him <br> Entered a highly restricted WG island and kidnapped a wanted man who is only second to Vegapunk <br> Allied with a Shichibukai and now he's gone rogue also <br> Has the whole of Dressrosa (and likely people of neighbouring countries) admiring and praising him as a saviour <br> Has got an underling who could somewhat stand against an admiral <br> Has shown his true strength in front of an admiral <br> Fought and defeated one of the stronger Shichibukais, and has thus thrown out the world's balance yet again <br>Etc, he's worthy of 550 million, especially when you stack everything he's also done before the timeskip on top of that.<br><br>He's got to trump Kid's again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh right, how could I forget. Luffy's threat posed and defeating of Doflamingo is known to the world and unable to be covered up. Moriah, Crocodile and Enies Lobby were all covered up to an extent which would have played a role.</br></br>  <br> Find at least 10 <br> Oda confirmed there'll be more Nakama showing up successively. </br></br>  <br><br>I completely forgot about Moriah, wasn't Doffy supposed to kill him and he escaped?<br><br>Has there been anything else mentioned about him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo thought that Moriah had escaped from his execution using his shadow powers, but it was in fact Absalom who turned him invisible and rescued him. Since then, there have been reports of Moriah being sighted in the New World, and we know for a fact that Absalom is still sailing around on the Mini-Thriller Bark.<br><br>Since Absalom and Hogback remained loyal to Moriah and took him from Thriller Bark in the same ship, it could be assumed that Moriah is still travelling on it. He'll likely have a comeback in the Kaido arc and ally with Luffy to take him down.<br><br>Pic related. It's the Mini Thriller Bark and if you look extremely closely at it, the two large figures standing on the deck somewhat resemble Moriah and his shadow clone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll likely have a comeback in the Kaido arc and ally with Luffy <br>If Moria comes back and allies with Luffy with him, Crocodile, Law, Hancock, Buggy and Jinbe, that'll make 6 at some point Shichibukai that are Luffy allies to various degrees. 7 if you count Mihawk and his being a mentor to Zoro.</br></br>  <br>what about Kuma?</br>  tfw they animate this scene   Final chapter of One Piece. <br> Chapter 2000: To the Next Generation  <br> Group of people whispering near the port of some island. <br> "You know what today is, right? It's the 10th anniversary of the day they killed... that man...!" <br> "Goodness! That fearsome pirate!? It's really been 10 years!?" <br> "Yes! They executed him atop the gallows in Loguetown! And we thought we would be rid of that terror forever but... he had to say that thing and... start a whole new age of pirates!" <br> "And I heard that his crew members are still lurking about somewhere!" <br> Man in a cloak comes out of the shadows. <br> "Don't spread rumors like that. You're gonna scare the kids." says the cloaked man, covering his face with a turned-down straw hat. <br> "Oh! You're back from your journey! Did you find anything interesting?" <br> "Yeah. I found an old momento from a dear, departed friend." the cloaked man says, as he holds up a devil fruit. <br> "Woah! That fruit looks super yummy! Gimme a bite!" says a snot-nosed kid running by, who snatches the fruit from the cloaked man and digs in, only to spit it out right after. <br> "Ew! That fruit tastes like garbage! Where did you get that junk!?" shouts the kid. <br> At first, the cloaked man has a slightly shocked face, only to turn it into a knowing grin. <br> "Hey kid. What do you wanna be when you grow up?" <br> "Me? I'm gonna be the pirate king! Just like Straw Hat Lucy was!" <br> All the townsfolk nearby look on in shock at him uttering the name of that man. <br> The cloaked man bends down in front of the kid and reaches into his pocket. <br> Pulls out a pair of goggles. <br> "Do me a favor. When you become the pirate king, return these to me, and not a second sooner, got it?" <br> The kid smiles and his cheeks somehow expand to twice their normal size, as if he were made of rubber. "Got it, Captain Usopp!" <br> "Well, I've gotta go on another journey. I have a lot of islands I need to protect, you know." the man named Usopp says, as he walks up onto his ship. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Are you ready, sir?" asks one of his crewmates. <br> "Yeah. I just had to ensure that my friend's dream reached the next generation." <br> The ship begins to pull out of the docks. <br> "You know, captain. We got another declaration of war." <br>"Ha!" says Usopp "Let them declare all they want. I promised my friend that I'd keep this area of the sea safe, and that's what I'll do. Nobody messes with the Emperor of the Sea, Captain Usopp!"<br> The ship moves further out to sea, and everyone in town waves goodbye to their trusted protector, including one little boy with a pair of goggles once worn by a close friend of the pirate king himself, as he struggles to figure out why his arm is so wiggly all of the sudden. <br> END OF ONE PIECE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>too clichè but I like it because of Usopp.<br><br>For a second there I thought you were about to throw out a 'it was buggy who was executed' plot twist</br></br></br>  <br> He's got to trump Kid's again <br>He never trumped it to begin with though. I can see him getting 455 or something, between Law and Kidd.</br></br>  <br>Aw I forgot about him. Although he's kind of no longer himself or in a state to be an ally. All the others could potentially show up to help.</br>  <br>Chapter 439 is named The 3rd and 7th Person, referring to Usopp and Robin.</br>  <br>Kid was 315 at sabaody, after marine ford luffy was 400.</br>  <br> implying kuma didn't use his repel shenanigans to move his consciousness into another body before getting vegapunk'd <br><br>step it up</br></br></br>  <br> Straw Hat Lucy <br>Why. Just why. It was all nice and heartwarming and all and then this. Just fucking why.</br></br>  <br> Implying that name won't stick just like Gold Roger did. </br>  <br>Well damn. Now I want an arc where the straw hats take on someone with 8 current and former Shichibukai backing them up.</br>  <br>Please Lord, why. Why can't be just known as Straw hat Luffy ?</br>  <br>This might actually happen.<br><br>I mean Oda did set up Kuma and made his backstory pretty ominous, he wouldn't just get rid of a major story element character like that.</br></br></br>  <br> asks one of his crewmates <br> It's actually Zoro <br> ''You ready Usopp ?'' </br></br></br>  <br> Screenshot from the Toriko anime </br>  <br>720p bruh</br>  <br>Its still the Toriko anime, which is shit compared to the manga</br>  <br>Same could be said about One Piece.</br>  <br>Yeah, but OP's anime hasnt always been shit</br>  Reminder of best song sung by one Sieyuu<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E-8<wbr>mFnN2pWk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> implying Zoro won't be doing an Afro Samurai Number 1 on a mountain training his successors. </br>  I really love Akainu's justice. It's tall, hard and linear as fuck.  <br>You do know its pretty much exactly the same as Lucci's "Dark Justice"? and Aokiji and Fujitora's types of Justice are way better</br>  <br>He's talking about the bonsai smartass.</br>  <br>I know, just felt like being a smartass</br>  I think Akainu get's more hate than he deserves tbh.  <br>What hate ?</br>  <br>Why is he likely? He spent the entire arc jobbing. He wasn't even relevant in any way, as opposed to every single Straw Hat in their respective arc.</br>  <br> Traitors justice are the best </br>  <br> akainu has a tiny sword tat on his right arm  <br><br>What does it mean</br></br></br>  <br>that you need to stop being such a faggot</br>  <br>How can a no name loser be calling me a faggot</br>  <br>He's gay for Mihawk.</br>  <br>It means he likes to rape good boys every night. In order to be a good cipherpol agent, you have to sleep with admirals. Lucci was like a cheetah in Akainu's love shack (both literally and figuratively).</br>  <br>He was obviously sending a secret message to Mihawk<br> ''lel Shanks lost an arm, you fancy fuck'' </br></br>  <br>Because, not only are you a dirty namefag but also you seem to support the shit posting</br>  <br>You're the one shit posting tho</br>  <br>Says the one namefagging with "Lucci a gud boy"</br>  <br>Sanji is in love with adventure, not women</br>  <br>That's debatable.</br>  <br>He's in love with women related adventures</br>  <br>since Oda is stalling this whole thing out like shit it's save to say we'll see a chapter all about Bellamy, maybe even already the next one. He's sleeping in that comfy house with all the other guys and I always saw him as the only logical option of a new crew member this arc and also his powers would kind of fit in really well in my opinion, in the powerscale he'd be somewhere between Robin and Franky. But yeah as many have stated he might join Law instead. <br><br><br> Viola still a strong contender <br>she really isn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He also looks nothing like the other Strawhats, which is a plus. Viola kinda resembles Robin.</br>  THERE WILL BE NO FUCKING NEW CREWMEMBER AFTER THIS ARC YOU FUCKING RETARDS   Bellamy joins <br> They fight Kaido <br> Luffy use Gear 4th: Bound Man <br> Bellamy awakens the Bane Bane No Mi <br> Turns room into springs <br>  Increases Gear 4th's constant bouncing <br> Luffy travels at 5 times the speed he was in Gear 4th <br> Gomu Gomu No Bane Leo Bazooka <br> Kaidou gets knocked into the springs and bounces about the room <br> Luffy has eaten meat right before the fight <br> Intense amounts of stamina means 2nd Leo Bazooka <br> Kaidou bounces in to Luffy's boosted Leo Bazooka and it does even more damage because Kaidou is bouncing towards it <br> Kaidou BTFO <br> Bellamy replaces Sanji as blonde member of the monster trio </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think g4 will do that much against kaido, he needs g5 at the very least and it will still be like when he fought lucci</br>  <br>The room probably has to be made out of Seastone or Wapometal to withstand that shit. Unless Law shows up and figures out how to make Solid Rooms.</br>  <br>It could be made of Wapometal, given it has no negative effects on DF and it looks like Kaidou has one</br>  <br>How is Viola a contender? She disappeared from the story for a huge amount of time and only served to give exposition to the audience and tell other characters about Dressrosa<br>What motivation does she have to join?</br></br>  One Piece official arc ranking straight from Oda:<br><br>Water 7/Enies Lobby &gt; Impel Down/Marineford &gt; Alabasta &gt; Punk Hazard/Dressrosa &gt; East Blue &gt; Skypiea &gt; Thriller Park &gt; Fishman Island</br></br>  <br> but muh Robin lookalike </br>  <br>Wouldn't that be another reason against her joining ? None of the Strawhats look alike at all.</br>  <br>'Twas ironic</br>  <br>My bad.</br>  <br>np</br>  <br>What about Gatz ?</br>  <br> only wanted 10 people <br>Inaccurate, he went out and said "let's see if I can atleast get 10 people to join my crew."<br>We might get well over 10.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I've seen as well. The words ''at least''.</br>  would you accept one piece going on hiatus for a year so Oda can rest?  <br>Absolutely. I'd be restless for about 2 weeks but the time will pass quickly.</br>  <br><br>Rebecca wasn't born into royalty, once again. She cannot be the princess. Just like with Vegeta being the Saiyan Prince, he cannot be the king, just like Trunks can't be the successor when his father dies. I know she IS technically viable for that role, but I don't see her suddenly becoming a princess out of the blue.</br></br>  <br>A year is a little too long, something like six months for rest and then getting SJ to allow him to release chapters every two weeks, something similar to the schedule of One Punch Man.<br><br>This would allow him to improve his art and keep the art at a high quality and maybe even have longer chapters, keeping everyone happy.<br><br> This would probably screw over the anime even more, but nobody watches the anime anymore. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Definetely, Oda works non-stop so we can enjoy One Piece, also it would benefit TOEI because they'd have to take a break and hopefully when OP returns, it starts looking good</br>  <br>Nah, the anime should take a break too. They didn't have to wait 4 bloody weeks for the timeskip. It's unfair.</br>  Can someone explain why bellamy joining is bad? I'm just curious why so many people think so. And please don't say it's because his power isn't strong enough to be in the crew. I understand that the crewmen have to be strong but I want to know if his personality can fit well with the crew.  <br>The anime should just make a filler arc or two, cover stories are a great material for that.</br>  <br>Yea, but, the last filler was absolute shit too but at least it's for a good cause. <br><br><br>It's nothing like that. People just think Bellamy is a bitch because of how he cried and kissed Doffy's ass. I personally don't mind at all since it was just as pathetic as Usopp coming back to the crew. And I fucking love Usopp. I don't think Bellamy is weak either. I think he's as strong, maybe a little weaker than Franky. I think having Bellamy would be cool as fuck because he can be blown away by all the crazy shit the Strawhats get to see. Mainly, I just want him to get to Emerald City with the others. Could be a Skypiea 2.0.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would be better if both Monet and Bellamy joined. Why not two at once?</br>  <br>Absolutely.<br>He's killing himself with that work schedule of his. Guy needs to rest and clear his mind.</br></br>  One Strawhat can unlock either Observation or Armament Haki, which Straw Hat is it and which Haki do they learn?  <br>Now that he has grown as a person, Bellamy could potentially have great dynamic with SHs, but there are a few reasons why he isn't SH material. The most prominent one is, he wasn't important in this arc. Compare him to anyone else: Zoro's intro arc was centered around him, Arlong Park was mostly about Nami, same goes for Sanji and Usopp in their intro arcs. Chopper was relevant in Drum Island as a doctor and Hiluluk's apprentice, Robin was Croc's right hand woman and the one who introduced to the readers the True History, Franky was targeted by CP9 and built Sunny, Brook was the reason SHs went to Thriller Bark. Jinbe played a key role in Fishman Island. What can we say about Bellamy in Dressrosa? He defeated some fodders and then jobbed. Remove him from the arc, and it actually improves. That's why he is a bad option: irrelevant characters shouldn't suddenly be given a huge role of Luffy's nakama.<br>The best candidate is Kyros (the one who led a rebellion against Doffy), but he wants to be with his daughter, so it's not happening.</br></br>  <br>Well luffy might not fight kaido alone he will probably have help like doffy. Also if moriah helps the strawhats take on kaido then we might see nightmare luffy or maybe a stronger version.</br>  <br>I get the feeling that for a lot of people it's<br> Bawww it's not Law! <br>or<br> Bawww it's not a girl! <br><br>Or, more legitimately, they plain don't like the character.<br><br>Me, I like the idea of his joining. After 'mingo, Luffy is probably the man he respects the most right now, and I can see that leading to him joining the crew since he has nowhere to belong to anymore. I think his powers also fit well with the rest. Not OP bullshit, but still pretty strong.<br><br>What I wonder is what would be his occupation within the crew. Lookout?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> showed Luffy how to exit the arena so Sabo could switch places with him and win mera mera vs Burgess <br>I think Luffy would have beat Burgess but he'd be exhausted and unable to fight Doffy afterward.<br>Remove him from the arc and Luffy loses to Doffy.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the fight against him helped strengthen Luffy's resolve too. He was super fucking pissed at Doffy after that fight and that shit made me so hyped.</br>  <br>But why would Monet even join???????<br>Her lil sister hates the strawhats (mainly ussop), zoro made her look like a bitch and she's hella loyal to doffy. Bellamy might not like doffy anymore because doffy was a dick to him but doffy was never a dick to Monet. Plus she has to be able to find the stawhats. And she's not even alive.</br></br>  <br>The only reason I want her to join is to get more doujins. Is that so much to ask for ?!</br>  <br>Luffy could've climbed the Colosseum's seating and jumped down.</br>  <br>Nami was first introduced in buggys arc and her importance wasn't that high. Until arlong park did she have an important role that was higher than the other strawhats at the time. Same with robin. She just joined out of nowhere in alabasta and until enies lobby did she have have an important part in an arc. So if bellamy joins he might receive his important arc later</br>  I still haven't heard a compelling argument against Barto, if Dressrosa gets a nakama at all.  <br>E M E R A L D C I T Y<br>M<br>E<br>R<br>A<br>L<br>D<br><br>C<br>I<br>T<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I want more doujins of Nathan the navigator and Robert the archaeologist but not a single one is out</br>  I know it's common in nippon animu that scientists are pure evil, but this is just retarded. <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  This anime would be good if the MC weren't such a gigantic, unlikable prick.<br><br>Then again, this is Maeda.
