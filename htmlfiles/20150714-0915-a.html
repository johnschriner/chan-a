[ Here's your new thread.<br> Still no news on vol.11 ch.2 </br>  You know, the funny thing is 8man has always put Yukino on pedestal and relies on Yui more than anyone.<br><br>Yui has it in her bag this time. Even her sinking ship attempt has been rejected by 8man. Now finally, it will be 8man's turn to reciprocate her feeling and being responsible at what he's done by proposing her in-hand marriage. He doesn't like superficial relationship, right?</br></br>  <br> Nee-san go home </br>  <br> relies on Yui more than anyone </br>  <br>Teenagers are stupid and have raging hormones. They usually aren't too self aware</br>  <br>Come on, you should know by now that any statement about someone having the strongest/most of anything positive in their relationship with 8man comes with the rider "other than Komachi"</br>  How's it feel seeing your husbando for the first time in like weeks and then he gets raped by the KINGU, Yuzu?  <br>Well crow did call Jack a traitorous bastard, pushed Yuya around when Yuya wanted to break out with them, and is a member of a gang with criminal marks</br>  <br> Yes, as a final boss-like place. I don't want the story to be 1:1 Arc-V </br>  <br> Disgusting self-inserter </br>  I'm pretty sure the Council pit Crow and Shinji against Gongenzaka and Tsukikage in order to show them what happens when a duelist loses. You know? To put some fear in the Lancers' hearts and make sure they don't take things lightly.  im the only one who wants akaba leo using lovecraft.dek?

When will they play tennis again?  What I'd like to know is how anime works, or rather what decides when an anime is made and how many seasons it will have.<br><br>Very, very few tv anime are original creations, almost all of them seem to be based on manga (or a manga adaptation of a light novel). More often than not, these shows get only one season, and this season often has a highly unsatisfying conclusion.<br><br>I'd like to know what's behind it. I know that often an anime doesn't get more seasons for the same reason western cartoons often don't get another season: not enough viewers and not enough funds. However, there are many anime that more than earn back their costs and still don't get a second season. Why is that, is it because it was planned to last one season? Then why do they often end on such an unsatisfying note rather than having an anime only conclusion? Do these anime just exist as advertisement for the manga? And is this planned ahead of time, because some anime end up telling the entire story of the manga, with filler if needed.<br><br>tl;dr: How does anime work?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With how small of an audience typical late night anime get it wouldn't be a good deal for the brand name company. Also, a lot of companies wouldn't want their product associated with otaku.</br>  <br>People can watch animu for free on nico. Japan only though.</br>  <br>and isn't it only at set airing times once off rather than being a static growing catalogue like crunchyroll? So it is more like another way of doing a television show than a streaming service.</br>  <br>I think there's still hope for manga(although I can probably mention only 1 thing that I'm reading that came out in the las 2 years)About anime,the profits keep getting higher and higher so I doubt it,but as a for quality,originality or good stuff in general it's dying.<br>I can't even get excited to watch anything of what is airing right now and I'm all day in front of my pc since I'm unemployed at the moment.</br></br>  <br>Remember that anime volumes of Naruto or whatever stack up, you may sell not much per volume, but if you add up all of them, it probably is not that bad sales wise.</br>  Hey guys do you have that post where rin's arm is long?
