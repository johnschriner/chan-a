Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far more bitter, cynical sense of humor. In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is "Hip to be Square", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.  <br>you're retarded af fml</br>  <br><br><br>Did you even read my post? <br> Beating the dead horse. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I do when they're done right, but now everyone uses fedora wrong.

Considering he's impotent?<br>Well, maybe he used a strap-on.</br>  This pairing has more chances of happening than Kamikoto if nt13 spoilers are to be believed. And I'm totally okay with it.  <br>To add to this thought, even if it isn't romantic or even a good end (ie Accelerator dies protecting her/the clones) I see Accelerator being far more involved with ALL of the Misakas' conclusion than Touma.</br>  <br> chances of happening <br>It already happened</br></br>  <br>I guess you could say that but I'm talking outside Othinus fucking with the world. It honestly makes more sense than her ending up with Touma</br>  Can we start officially supporting this pairing without being called a crack shipper or troll now? Can that happen if the NT13 spoilers are confirmed true?  <br>AccelxLO OTP</br>  <br>That's cute too but I also like this pairing</br>  <br>Forgot everything about that volume what exactly happened in one of the worlds with them?</br>  <br> What spoilers? </br>  <br>[spoilers] Mikoto gets depressed because she was called a burden to Touma and feels an incredible sense of distance fro him. She goes back to her dorm quietly. Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma</br>  <br>Accelerator saved all the clones and they were seen close together and assumed to be close friends or lovers</br>  <br>mayonegg edit?</br>  <br>Accel was basically her Touma in the perfect world since he was the one that saved the clones</br>   yfw this pairing would make Touma happy because it would ease some of his Othinus trauma   <br> Accel says something cheeky towards misaka  <br> misaka gets annoyed and fires a railgun out of reflex <br> this time her railgun gets reflected right back at her and she dies </br></br></br>  <br> Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma <br>With just this? People sure like to troll</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no. The comedy scenes would turn into Accelerator reflecting her attacks away and destroying shit, making the joke "That damn Level 5 couple is a property liability"</br>  <br>But it really does seem that way, unless the spoilers are wrong but the illustrations and photos of text seem to confirm them as legit</br>  <br>But this is the real OTP.</br>  <br> i-it is not like I wanted to hit you or anything BAKA  <br> tsk. D-don't think I was trying to protect you, next time I'll reflect those back at you </br></br>  <br>If there's no way Accelerator can't have one of the Misakas I'd accept this, too. Although I'm sure she prefers Hamazura</br>  <br>Nah they are bros</br>  Accelerator x Mikoto best hate sex.  <br>Not gonna lie him dealing with misaka's bs would be amusing.</br>  <br>Yes. At some point it'd stop being hate sex because they'd enjoy it so much.</br>  <br>Team up again fucking when?</br>  <br>Crazy don't go well with crazy</br>  <br>Accel is probably already sick of all these misaka's.</br>  <br> implying he hasn't developed feelings for all the Misakas and he doesn't know what it means or what to do with it </br>  Still waiting for that moment where Accelerator saves Mikoto, Kamachi.   mikoto is a narutard <br>truly worst misaka</br>  <br>This. <br><br> she gets gravely injured <br> Accelerator is nearby, sees it, flips his shit because it reminds him of the Sisters Project and saves her <br> Mikoto's worldview is flipped upside down  <br><br>Make it happen Kamachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto's worldview is flipped upside down <br>More like we get two tsundere tsuntsun at each other</br></br>  <br><br> She goes back to her dorm quietly. <br><br>Is this near the end? It sounds ridiculous to have it happen in the middle but when Magic Gods you never know.<br><br>I mean even scrub magicians have a spell to get people like her away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But misaka too strong to get harmed in AC.</br>  <br> I mean even scrub magicians have a spell to get people like her away <br><br>If they're quick enough to cast it m8.</br></br></br>  <br>They make the cutest couple</br>  <br>Well he already had a taste of her meat so anything is possible.</br>  Am I the only one?<br>To be honest the manga hints this alot.</br>  <br>She's probably dead in the current index timeline.</br>  Wouldn't Misaka working her way into Accel's life sorta make fucked up sense?<br><br>He's already got Last Order and Worst. At this point he may as well complete the set and get the OG.</br></br>  <br>Considering Accelerator's powers would make him amazing in bed, probably not.<br><br>She still shows interest in other people.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, it just feels like she's gonna die, probably sacrifice herself for some bullshit.<br>I really like her though, and she may be the first girl other than LO to actually worry for Accelerator's well being, and their interactions are cute.</br></br>  <br><br>Taped a popsicle sticks to his dick.</br></br>  <br><br>Sure, it's not like Touma will complain.</br></br>  Zero.  <br>Touma's harem is already big enough He doesn't need Misaka up in his shit. <br><br>It would also spread the Level 5's around the protagonists with Meltdowner/HAMAZUUUURRRAAAA, Mental Out/Touma and Accel/Misaka and Guts/Supremacy of the military court.</br></br></br>  <br>Her powers would make her pretty good in bed too. The two of them fucking would be out of this world sex</br>  <br>That's pretty much what everyone is saying. It would make more sense than her getting with Touma. I have a feeling Touma would cheer them on.</br>  <br> mikoto  <br> losing a fight </br></br>  <br> Mental Out/Touma </br>  <br>let's be real here we don't know where that would have gone had the mind wipe thing hadn't happened</br>   shipping shitsaka with accel <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>It would make her a better character. Even Touma would agree</br>  <br> but the illustrations <br>Which one?<br> She goes back to her dorm quietly. Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma <br> Most people think  <br>Seems legit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what would their children look like?</br>  <br>Still mad.</br>    <br>Is Haimura ever going to learn to draw legs?</br>  <br>He seemed happy for them back in omega world</br>  <br>He draws fine legs and fucks up the others in the same illustration.</br>  <br>He has his priorities straight</br>  <br><br> popsicle  <br><br>Cold on the cob*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope that was foreshadowing she'll   help save everyone from Demon Lord Touma by completely erasing Othinus and her death from his mind.   How mad would everyone be</br>  <br>*tips tophat*</br>  <br>Skinny ass brown haired nigga.</br>  <br>Would be 10/10.</br>  <br><br>They would have a white streak in their mostly brown hair.</br></br>  <br>It really and truly would.</br>  <br>Accel's hair is not white</br>  <br>You've gotten me on board</br>  <br> Accel's hair is not white <br><br>How is it not?</br></br></br>  <br>Good</br>  <br><br>Their son would be a nice guy who, like his mom, can use electricity. His nickname is Thunder Rod and he will spend a week training with Thor and Uncle Touma in the harsh lands of northern Sweden. <br><br>Their daughter would be a chuuni edgelord. She'd be Terrorist Outfit Biribiri with Accelerator's mad kekekekekeke'ing and plasma generating. Also she wears spats beneath her skirt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute as fuck</br>  <br><br>We don't know what his actual hair color is. His ability has just made it lacking any pigment (just like it's made his balls spermless).</br></br>  <br>It is not, he is albino because of his powers <br>His hair was probably black considering that he thinks that he looks obviously japanese</br></br>  <br> His nickname is Thunder Rod and he will spend a week training with Thor and Uncle Touma in the harsh lands of northern Sweden. <br>FUND IT</br></br>  High quality scans where  <br>Misaka x Accelerator confirmed</br>  <br>I wouldn't say that but I'd say it's more viable than Mikoto and Touma at this point</br>  Reminder that Worst and LO's feelings for Accel are fake.  I'm late but fuck this shit getting good.<br><br>New chapter when?</br></br>  <br>end of the month</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Stop shipping accel with this piece of shit you bunch of faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. It makes sense and would make her character a million times better. You seem tsundere for this.</br>  <br>Touma looks so gone in the first pic</br>  <br> He doesn't ship Accelerator/Misaka's </br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about her character.</br>  <br>So tsuntsun.</br>  OTP.  <br>It's canon he touches Misaka clones inappropriately</br>    <br/>  <br>Right.</br>  So when is someone going to feed the JS06bot his book?  <br>Nda is best girl. Fre a shit. A SHIT</br>  <br>Why is Stiyl such a cuck?</br>  <br><br> implying that's Fre or Nda <br><br>Stiyl x Fre/nda would be a weird pairing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there really such thing as hate sex?</br>  <br> Snitches get stiches <br>I remember when that sperglord Frendafag got his panties in a bunch when someone said this and spent the whole thread crying about it.</br></br>  Will Misaka have tits bigger than her mothers?  <br>I knew, I just needed a reason to remind the world that Nda is best.</br>  <br>She will get Worst's size at best.</br>  <br>This was only good because that duraraa author wrote it right?</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Accelerator is one lucky motherfucker. WORST is the best fucking girl.</br>  <br>Real talk.</br>  <br> WORST <br> not LO </br></br>  <br>Don't steal her man, Misaka</br>  <br>Both of them are best.  WORST is just more best. </br>  <br><br><br>Kamikuro is the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Kuroko is shit.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  <br>Kuroko a big fat shit.</br>  So how long do we think this "NT13 kills Kamikoto" troll wave is going to last?  <br>When it gets translated and is confirmed to not be a troll</br>  <br>Also, not everyone who thinks NT13 confirms Kamikoto isn't happening hates Misaka and is out to troll or harass the shippers. Some people think it because it makes logical sense given the spoilers and will take back said opinion if the spoilers are false, which it is doubtful</br>  <br>When it gets translated and people can't just base their entire knowledge of the novel on spoilers.</br>  Season 3 when? I ain't bothered to read 20+ of these books.  <br>Read the LN's. There will never be an S3 most likely.</br>  <br>You won't regret it, regardless of what character is your favorite</br>  <br> some probably accurate spoilers say that she goes home depressed because she feels useless <br> obviously the ship is dead and I should go post about how this means Accelerator-Misaka is a better possibility than it is! <br>No, I'm pretty sure those are trolls out to harass people.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless it's Himegami.</br>  <br>How can Kamikoto happen when ToumaxSuffering is a thing?</br>  <br>So stating an opinion that isn't "she will end up with Touma" is harassing her Touma shippers? Yes, people in this thread did say Misaka/Accelerator makes more sense than Misaka/Touma, but no one here said "Fuck off Touma shippers! Your shitty ship is dead!" or anything inflammatory</br>  <br>But isn't this popular in Japan or something and didn't the anime sell well so like why wouldn't they be?<br><br><br>Maybe when I've cleared some shit in my backlog.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It sold very well in Japan but that doesn't matter. The anime was used to advertise for the LN's, and since the LN's are selling well there's no reason to licence another season.</br>  Isn't both the anime and manga based on some light novels?  <br>Why is shit like sao getting another season then?</br>  <br>Because it's far more popular than Index overall.</br>  <br>Index yes, Railgun is just a manga with a few LN side stories.<br><br><br>Doesn't it sell a lot better than raildex? Both in animated and LN form?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Misaka/Accelerator makes more sense <br>You mean those characters that have talked like twice? And have expressed no desire to have anything to do with one another?<br><br>Honestly Mikoto will probably end up with no one, just like Touma and Accelerator and probably everyone but Hamazura. Romance isn't important in this series. Hamazura only gets a pass because romance is his reason for action.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To add to this, even Hamazura's relationship with Rikou, pretty much the only relationship in the series, has been out of focus basically since it started.<br><br>Kamachi just doesn't like to write about relationships.</br></br></br>  . <br>just because she's spent the entire series chasing Touma doesn't mean it makes sense for her to end up with him. In fact her ending up with someone she doesn't know would make sense thematically. A sort of "you can't always get what you but you can end up with what you need"</br>  <br>She's not going to get anyone because this isn't that kind of series. Kamachi can't write romance and he knows it, poor Rikou barely exists anymore. Hamazura has barely thought about her since NT started, he just thinks of ITEM as a group. <br><br>Which is actually really sad when you reread the whole "don't leave me" scene they had in the plane.</br></br></br>  Filthy delusional Kamikotofags are at it again.  <br>True it's completely possible this series will end with no romantic conclusions at all. Misaka and Accelerator having a non romantic partnership over Misaka and Touma having one would make even MORE sense than the romantic pairs</br>  I like Gunha for Mikoto. He's stupid enough that he'll piss her off all the time but he's strong enough to withstand the shocks. And really that's all Misaka wants in a man.  <br>Alright buddy. Not my place to get in the way of people's head canon I guess.<br><br> You do realize this series is almost certainly going to end with a whole "The Adventure Continues" as Touma yells Fukou Da as loud as he can while his pseudo-harem calls him an idiot in unison, right? It's an awful series when it comes down to it. </br></br></br>  <br>I just want Index to be relevant.</br>  <br> Index <br>Who?</br></br>  Where's my Delta Force trio bros at?  <br>Dead people can't yell.</br>  <br>WW3 shows that Kamachi could write a damn good ending if he wanted to, we just need to hope that he can pull something like that out of the bag again for NT  and then again for part after NT </br>  <br>Speaking of these magic gods why the fuck would Touma ever be a threat to them? Literally any idiot with a gun could kill Touma with ease.</br>  <br>Plot armour</br>  <br>The novel says Touma's not a threat to them.</br>  <br>Because they can't kill him without getting rid of imagine breaker, he's a very convenient container.</br>  <br> they can't kill him <br>Literally just fucking shoot him. His power is the ability to not be able to use any powers. A normal human is the easiest thing to kill.</br></br>  <br>Ssh, you'll summon the "durr durr TouMan can punch bullets" retards</br>  <br>He means in the sense that if you kill Touma, Imagine Breaker will go somewhere else, and they have no idea where it will end up. It's easier to keep it locked down in Touma.<br><br>Also Touma isn't a threat to Magic Gods, not sure what gave you that impression.</br></br></br>  When will touma stop being a faggot?  <br>Never. Thor will win the Toumab owl.</br>  <br>When Accelerator stop being edgy</br>  <br>That happened a while ago. He just puts it on now.</br>  Mikoto x Kuroko<br>Touma x Index x Othinus<br>Tatemiya x Itsuwa<br>Knight Leader x Kanzaki<br>Aogami x Himegami<br><br>Perfect ends.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto x Kuroko <br>Sickening.</br></br>  <br>But he's not edgy no more anon.</br>  <br>So touma ends up with worst girls? He may as well kill himself.</br>  <br> Knight Leader x Kanzaki <br>my nigga</br></br>  <br>But he isn't ending up with Mikoto.</br>  <br> people call Accelerator/Mikoto a crack ship when Mikoto/Kuroko and Kuroko/Touma exist </br>  <br><br>They belong together.</br></br>    <br><br>Harassing Fukiyose. Touma is throwing stones at her window to get her attention and Tsuchi, Aogami, Accel, and Shiage are playing in his band, doing a power ballad to try to get Fukiyose to fall for Touma. But she's just getting more pissed.</br></br>   mfw niggas actually taking the accel x misaka joke seriously   <br>The clones aren't that much different from the original biologically so we can say that he knows the original's body. And yes, there's implied rape.</br>  <br> Tsuchi, Aogami, Accel, and Shiage are playing in his band <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=98R<wbr>FrzTQQEc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>They're just so good together. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UUB<wbr>Q4qvtLlc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Misaka is shit but those two are worse.</br>  <br>They've definitely had butt sex.</br>  At least the people who actually ship Accelerator and Misaka seem chill.  <br>That fucking MAD is too good. The amount of effort put in must have been staggering.</br>  <br>If he fucked a clone, Last Order would know.</br>  <br>What happens in NT13?</br>  <br>Read the thread or search the archives</br>  <br>Fund it!</br>    <br>She is going to when Takeru ntr Index from Touma.</br>  Are people trying to shit up what started as a civil and chill thread because it said something they didn't like or  <br>Mikoto/Kuroko isn't really a crack ship. It's still not happening though.</br>  <br>They want him to join them.<br><br> TatemiyaxItsuwa <br> knight leaderxKanzaki <br><br>Accelerator xMikoto sounds like canon in comparison to those 2 shits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying LO doesn't </br>  <br>anon, it's nothing but a literal joke</br>  <br>That's because he did the original.</br>  Why is Accel so attractive  <br>He's actually pretty repulsive. Nothing likes to get near him</br>  <br>Crack ships are pairings that have almost no interactions like accel and mikoto. Kuroko has a crush on mikoto so there's a reason to ship it. It won't happen because mikoto is straight. The fact that kuroko is a joke character isn't relevant.</br>   tfw no more GROUP   <br> albino <br> attractive <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> being a homosexual <br> any year </br></br>  <br>You fucking what m8<br>the only reason anyone would think that is because he purposely tried to act repulsive so people wouldn't get close to him, as he was scared of hurting people if they did. His behaviour really doesn't affect his appearance, so you just have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>No, a crack pairing is a pairing that is a literal joke and has no possible way of happening ever.</br>  <br> not being homosexual in the year of our 'bama 2015 </br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br>Are you faggots really this dumb or what?<br>I seriously ask, are index readers on /a/ really this stupid? <br><br> lel she gets told she's not for Touma so shipping is dead xD <br><br>She'll just powerup and help Touma or Touma will just tell her that she's not useless. It's fucking clear it's a goddamn "after we're through his we'll improve our relationship"<br>Unless Touma or she herself say that they won't be together it's just falseflagging.<br><br> Jesus christ you people are so dumb it hurts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then stuff like TWGOK happens and you fags lose your shit and act like it came out of nowhere.</br>  <br> tfw i actually miss kanzaki <br><br>Return to England arc when?</br></br></br>  <br>Except Touma was the one to mention her being a burden. The high priest jeered at Mikoto and made his comment worse</br>  <br>Accelerator is the most repulsive person on the show. The only people who don't find Accel repulsive are Touma and Kihara.</br>  <br>Next issue r-right?<br> ;_: </br></br>  <br>anon he's making a joke about his powers</br>  <br> Bad dude tries to stir shit up  <br> Totally not happening guise! ship is dedd lel </br></br>  <br>can't he just reverse the blood flow in the veins in his dick till he's erect?</br>  <br> ignoring the fact Touma said what made her depressed in the first place </br>  <br> Kamachi can't write romance <br>I mean most often sure, but the non fighting parts of NT10 were pretty good I thought. I think Kamachi more just doesn't feel like writing it more than he can't</br></br>  <br>You can't stop knight leader's love anon</br>  <br><br> Touma intentionally putting someone down. <br>I'm not even a shipperfag. Mikoto is still the most popular girl, kamachi isn't going shink the ship until the end.</br></br></br>  <br> Totally ignoring the 2024 volumes of Touma being a dense motherfucker  <br> Totally ignoring the 2024 volumes of Touma worrying about people <br> Totally ignoring the fact that bad guy is the one to deliver the blow  <br><br>I mean are you seriously this retarded? I just can't believe you are so dumb.<br><br>Bad dude does something. MISUNDERSTANDING happens, then Touma says he was just worrying about her getting rekt.<br>Misaka believes him but gets the fact that she actually IS weak. She gets power up in a few volumes and proves to Touma he doesn't need to worry about her.<br>It's so fucking cliche it hurts my fingers of typing it.<br><br>tl;dr Touma's dense and bad guy shenanigans never amount to anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto <br> powering up <br><br>That's as likely to happen as Touma recovering his memories of Misaki.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's still the least boring character in the entire show especially when he goes angel mode.</br></br>  <br>The joke has already been explained you have no excuse for continuing to be dense</br>  <br>I ship Touma with Mikoto. YOLO niggers, come at me!</br>  <br>I just don't see this happening. From the spoilers, it's all vague as hell which leads me to believe Kamachi is sinking the ship without outright saying it so people like you won't give up hope.</br>  <br> She gets power up <br>oh that is very unlikely and she would need a huge power up to carry herself among high tier magicians.</br></br>  <br> go for a walk <br> come back <br>Damn it. Aww man.</br></br></br>  Accelerator will be a single father fuck you faggots.  <br>Even as a nonMikotofag it's not unlikely at all, but certainly for the near future it is. Endgame I expect at least Accel Mikoto and Index will get power ups if not more of the cast</br>  <br>Level 69 breh...</br>  <br>More like this.</br>  I'd rather have Accelerator/Mikoto fans instead of endless<br><br> Othinus a best!!!111!!! <br> No Misaka a best!!!111!!! <br> Fuck you both, this random girl a best!!!11!! <br><br>Don't shit on them</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Endgame will be Demon Lord Touma, Angelerator and Hamazura in one of those godkiller robots <br>I don't think the heroines will play a role, at least not in the battle</br></br>  <br>Yes shipperfags are better than waifufags. <br><br>You might not have noticed but the thread is filled with endless shipperfighting.</br></br></br>  <br> A lolicon and shotacon dating <br>As poetic as it would be I don't see it</br></br>  <br>No, not in the main battle. There might be smaller battles going on elsewhere that the girls are handling. I see Index being around somewhere</br>  <br>Index will at least go Pendex at some point and since Mikoto has already shown the start of Level 6 in Railgun I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we saw more of it and what the hell being Aleister's favorite means.</br>  <br>Not at first. It was just people being kinda chill and discussing theories</br>  <br>I just don't see it.</br>  <br><br>Both Pendex and level 6 Misaka are less than failed gods and whatever Aleister and Laura are cooking is far beyond god-tier, unless both get a massive boost Othinus and Accel are better suited for those roles <br>at least in my opinion</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if they're not Magic God tier, there will almost definitely be some giant team up in the end game to beat the final boss, heck I'd be more surprised if it was just Touma and Accel to be honest. (We all know Othinus is going to die either next arc or just prior to the finale, neither she or LO are making it)</br>  so have we gotten any translations for NT 13 yet or is this gonna be a thing where we wait a week before anything happens and rampant speculation errywhere?  <br>I'd be a weird mix of both surprised and "Well I saw this coming" if Last Order dies before the finale</br>  <br> LO and Othinus dying <br><br><br>We got some, check the archives.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Othi and LO don't make it neither Touma nor Accel are making it<br>Something I see happening is both Accel and Beetle transcending humanity, magic and science, leaving Misaka as the strongest esper</br></br>  <br>mah nigga</br>  <br>Othinus yes but I don't see why he included Last Order. If she dies it will in the finale not before</br>  <br>That would leave Gunha as the strongest esper.</br>  <br> LO dying </br>  <br>I see all the level 5s transcending humanity, magic and science and being the next set of gods.</br>  What if Index dies and that's the finale?  <br>Yeah I'll retract that, either to kick off it or during the finale is probably where it'll happen, either way they're not making it out of the series was the main point</br>  <br> you will never have your own personal QT necromancer GF. </br>  <br>You can't be less than magic god tier and expect to make it in the final fight, hell fiamma wouldn't make it in the final fight. That level of reality control can only be combated by someone immune to it. Otherwise it would be just like the end of NT8 where everyone except touma was swept aside.</br>  <br> Misaki <br> Mugino <br> Transcending humanity </br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it's possible she dies but I didn't this it's as guaranteed as you're saying. Not as guaranteed as Othinus</br>  <br> implying misaki won't get off her fat ass to get gud if touma ever bothers to try getting his memories back <br> implying mugino won't get forced into lv 6 by sheer bullshit via the gary stu that is hamazura. </br></br>  <br>I guess you'll see when the time comes. Consider this for example, Hamazura at least will be there, and there's no chance he'll ever be anything more than a Level 0</br>  <br> leaving Misaka as the strongest esper </br>  <br>Why live</br>  <br>Mugino could become an energy being in the same way Kakine became DM</br>  <br>different anon but i bet othinus will live, primarily because her dying seems to be too easy and lazy on kamachis part, in addition, i doubt she will get away with only that amount of suffering.</br>  <br>Unless his waifu turns him into a level 7 with the power of love</br>  <br>I suppose there's the outside possibility that Accelerator will die and she'll live. I just think it's going to happen much for the same reason many think Othinus will die, as a way to push Accel/Touma over the edge.</br>  <br>We can't hold them to hamazura's standard, his bullshit is canon. The world bends to save even crowley who planned his way around the gods can't even manage to kill him.</br>  <br>Not to mention that she's the second most popular girl right now. Kamachi would never remove a fanfavorite from the story.</br>  <br>I don't see her living long at all. I think she was just a plot device to introduce whatever is really in his right hand</br>  <br>Why is Kamachi such a pushover?</br>  <br>:The world bends to save him</br>  <br><br>I see Gunha dying heroically in the last battle to protect the other 5s, finally understanding his ability on his last moments</br></br>  <br>He's not. People are deluded</br>  <br>nah the thing is she still has too much set up to not really die, and if i were everybody, i'd actually worry more about index suddenly dying off because she would probably have the same damn effect with touma and shes doing less then jack shit right now plot wise.</br>  <br>Please don't kill the loli, Kamachi</br>  <br> not straight up ascending to lv 6 right then and there and proceeding to kick everyones ass around. <br>its like you don't even guts.</br></br>  <br>i want estelle to mind-probe me</br>  <br>So that's why Railgun is about Kuroko, right?</br>  <br>Set up to do what? Be a damsel in distress?</br>  <br>He doesn't give a shit about lolis.</br>  <br> Worry <br> About Index dying </br></br>  <br>Is Kamachi some sort of machine?</br>  <br>Kuroko a shit</br>  <br>nah she will probably get her powers back and probably proceed to get her shit kicked in by laura to make some brand of point later, thats my guess.<br>she will get the lead jobber role once that mess happens.</br></br>  <br>Yes. A machine programmed to make loli fans suffer and mature girls fans rejoice.</br>  <br>Wait a minute, she has a mole in the thigh?</br>  <br>I see her dying to cause Touma's hand to unlock</br>  <br>Having the best hat in there series, and her powers are likely not gone. There also no one on touma's side with her level of magic knowledge.but that changed if the stuff about nephy being a new freeloader is true</br>  <br>and on her back too.<br>inner thigh mole is sexier, though</br></br>  <br>nephy is clearly only temp at best, i think she will bite the bullet for othinus next volume.</br>  <br>I'd much rather Accel die than LO. The guy's main trauma is over killing ten thousand clones - not being able to save the loli head clone would be too cruel.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>If you haven't noticed Kamachi is perfectly fine with throwing lots of suffering at his characters</br>  <br> finally gains the power to protect <br> fails to protect the one thing he cared the most in the world <br>pls no</br></br></br>  <br>I could see him trying to kick Crowleys shit in over something to do with the clones and Last Order doing something similar to Heavens Feel Illya to save him from dying</br>  Mikoto should just give up on Touma and join with Misaki as fellow Tokiwadai level 5 buddy cop.  <br><br>Such a cutie<br>Fuck now I want her to survive<br>I hope Kamachi doesn't break my illusions</br></br></br></br>   Touma will never be the same again   <br>Speaking of Beetle, could he create new life now if he combines Residual Thought with disconnection from the network?</br>  <br>I'm so glad I wasn't around to read the spoilers for NT9 even if I missed the threads, I have never been so unready for a novel as I was that one</br>  <br>Gunha lost to a women so he's the weakest.</br>  <br>He probably could but after what happened to Kakine he is not a fan of creating shit <br>He wouldn't dare</br></br>  I'm still fucking mad at kakine bs loss in NT6. <br><br>Why is kamachi such a faggot?</br></br>  <br>Not even the people who read the spoiler were ready <br><br><br> lost <br>He got up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You did this last thread and it has already been pointed out he got right back up. Honestly the whole fight was a big point in his favor for being one of the strongest espers, he was almost even with what should have been leagues past him</br>  <br>Kakine was fixated on surviving anything like a roach.<br>Beetle just needs to learn how to "lock out" admin access of DM.</br></br>  <br>She values other people's lives more than she values her own, so she's probably gonna pull a sacrifice again (for corpse girl) and tell Accel its okay so he wont feel like shit not being able to help her.</br>  Kakine killing beetle, fremea and othinus when?  I wanna see Touma gaining one of his dragons powers and fuck shit up.  <br> Sacrifice yourself for a corpse that will die when you die anyways <br>I'd kek</br></br>  <br>Is accel using his powers to stick to the wall and appear taller?<br>What a poser</br></br>  <br> kakine doing shit as a volleyball <br> implying </br></br>  <br> Implying the one othinus turned in to a volleyball wasn't a clone  <br><br> Implying the original isn't currently plotting his next move </br></br></br>  <br>I personally think she'll sacrifice herself to save LO, its her mission to protect her in the first place. <br><br><br>Apparently she knew the corpse girl before she died.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying he won't fail </br>  <br>If she's going to be killed, it'll be without Accelerator's knowledge.<br><br>He'll think she's living life in some remote corner of the world.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>It would be useless killing her if it doesnt contribute to the story somehow.</br>  <br>The spread where Accel sees Hasami's memories could go either way in terms of Estelle's relationship with her. The details on the faces shown don't help the discernment.</br>  How destructive are kakine's attacks?  <br>Yeah but it's not like you can let filler affect Accel in a major way either, especially since he'd show up in the novels acting the same as ever, by definition it wouldn't contribute to the story</br>  <br>We saw nameless Anti-Skills get slaughtered wholesale by DA/the Scavengers, which hasn't been shown so gruesomely in any of the other mediums. I think Estelle isn't immune from narrative death.</br>  <br>What's this from anyway?<br>I dont remember it in the railgun manga</br></br>  <br>It was.</br>  <br>As destructive as he wants to, imagination is his only limit</br>  <br>I think of it as more of a waste to her character than affecting Accel if she just dies off-screen somewhere, though her whole outlook on death has already shown to affect him somehow.<br><br><br>You cant compare her to nameless Anti-Skills, c'mon.</br></br></br></br>  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_1</wbr></wbr>  <br>Apparently Touma has this minimum requirement to be his gf that you must be able to kill magic gods and slap the shit out of saints. Apparently Mikoto is the only character in the entire series that cannot do this. This is how delusional /a/ is. These are the mental gymnastics that come from all this blind hatred of a fictional entity.</br>  <br>First you show bystanders dying.<br>Then characters tangentially related to the protagonist.<br>Work your way closer to the core, and your reader will soon realize that no one's safe.</br></br></br>  <br>I also didn't say her death will be offscreen. Accel just won't be aware of it.</br>  <br>Just when i was about to go bed fuck.</br>  <br> high priest trying to cause mindfucks everywhere <br>god damn it.<br>also i think that observer bullshit might actually be the case but hes trying to brush it off.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they're that delusional, I think most people saying that are just saying it because it gets you mad. <br><br><br>Yeah, but you still can't jump from "nameless side characters died" to "the female lead can die."</br></br></br></br>  <br> you will never be as mad as Mikotofags </br>  <br> Sucesfullyhid the manga magazine but left Touma thinking you're not soft <br>Truly winning the battle but losing the war there Seria</br></br>  <br>She might not die this arc, but near the end of the the manga's run.</br>  <br>Aogami is the observer<br>Think about it, he fits the description perfectly</br></br>   “Her… That girl with the short brown hair and the headband… Come to think of it, who is she!? I feel like she’s been nonchalantly showing up everywhere I go!!” <br><br>Who's the high priest referring?</br></br>  <br>I think it's very possible that she'll die, mainly because that's an easy way to deal with her absence from the main series, but I don't buy the logic about this manga showing more gruesome stuff and therefore being more violent with its characters, since her dying would be much more major than anything it's shown so far.</br>  <br> he doesn't know about Touma's stalker </br>  <br>Hmm never noticed.<br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Her http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.co<wbr>m/wiki/Headband_girl</wbr></br>  <br>Headband girl<br>she appears in most AC illustrations</br></br>  Post more headband girl    <br>To be honest I'm somewhat surprised Touma is excited about getting a love letter, I figured he had decided to not get a gf because fukou da would reach to her as well. This also means he really doesn't notice everyone's advances somehow or another, typical harem mc I suppose</br>  <br> All Lessar had to do was send a letter </br>  <br>This alone might disprove the whole "shippers btfo" thing. It also means he's not madly in love with Othinus</br>  <br>Touma would still reject her because he hates lolis.</br>  <br>He is a "normal" boy, he would date anyone who isn't a threat to his life<br>He had no problem going out with Saten for example</br></br>  <br>I want to know what if feels like, just for a little bit</br>  Touma getting trolled by that magic god was amusing .  <br>It doesn't actually mean anything about his feelings towards other girls. He specifically said those were another matter but getting confessed to was a lifetime achievement. What it does mean however is he seriously doesn't know that Index, Mikoto, etc like him</br>  <br>Shippers will still get BTFO, don't worry.</br>  So High priest is the best magic god right?  <br>So he's actually not a faggot but just a dense piece of shit?</br>  <br> “B-but don’t you have someone you like, a girl you’re interested in, or an older girl you’re always thinking about? Like a nearby upperclassman?” <br><br> “Thaaaat is a completely different issue!! Getting a love letter and having a girl be the one who confesses her love to you is enough to earn one of life’s trophiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss<wbr>ssssssss!!” </wbr> <br><br>Touma is a slut</br></br></br></br></br>   Touma denying he's the main man of this shit after everything   <br>What's better, a Natsuru or a Kodaka?</br>  <br> Touma happy about getting a random love letter <br><br>Othinusfags BTFO.</br></br></br>  <br>But it does. He would be an asshole to get excited over a love letter he's going to reject because he loves another girl because "he wants the experience"</br>  <br>It is not like breaking illusions is what he does or anything</br>  <br>See <br>He really is just an asshole/it's a comedic scene. To be fair though it's always nicer to hear people like you and would want to go out with you than hear that no one cares.</br></br>  Hopefully this volume isn't shit like the last 3.  Why does Kamachi hate lolis?  <br>kamachi.exe is truly a machine of monstrous proportions</br>  <br>Get excited over a love letter he KNOWS he's going to reject for a selfish reason like wanting the experience is a shitty thing to do and unrelated to breaking illusions.<br><br>He's either a massive, selfish dick or not in love with Othinus or Index</br></br></br>  <br>Because his editor told him he already has like 8 and should probably slow down and let someone like Nephyts survive for once</br>  <br>Because loli's are shit.</br>  <br><br><br>Whatever romantic feelings he may have had for Othinus disappeared the moment she got turned into a fairy.</br></br></br>   The six or seven billion people living here do not all support it equally. <br>Why can't High Priest confirm how many people are in Touma's world?</br>  <br>Seek treatment for shit taste</br>  <br>Phases and perspectives anon<br>The only reason people think he is righteous and not a massive, selfish dick is because of the point of view of the observer</br></br>  <br>Because it's somewhere in the middle?</br>  <br>There's also the possibility he's not in love with Othinus or Index</br>  <br>To be fair a lot of people die and are born all the time, any number he gives would be immediately outdated</br>  <br>Eh, I don't know, I could see plenty of people in real life getting excited that someone sees them romantically (for the first time, as far as Touma the neutron star knows).<br><br>Also, based on what he says and what the narrator says, he's basically going on autopilot and not really thinking about what he'll do about it. Because it's a joke scene.</br></br></br>  <br>Index was petzoned long time ago.</br>  <br>Why would i need treatment when my taste is exceptionally good?<br><br>Clearly there is something wrong in that head of yours if you think loli's are anything but shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking this.</br>  <br>B-but I like Index</br>  Why no one likes her?  Who's that?  Her mercs are selling like hot cakes, she´s super iconic for anime fans, she´s likable if you discount the latest movie. Majority likes her and still do till the end of ages. <br><br>Why don´t you like her?</br></br>  <br>Soulless doll</br>  I really, really like Rei.  <br><br>I love her.</br></br>  B-but I love her, she is my waifu.  <br>0.0000000147/10</br>  Everyone likes her and it is driving Anno insane.  <br> Why no one likes her? <br>I like her, also why did you use a pic for ants?</br></br>  <br>she has no style</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128075232 <br>except Anno was simply predicting the future and taking the next logical step, not constructing a new model and forcing the market's hand<br><br>his only mistakes were being too perspicacious of anime culture and too gifted when it comes to crafting false idols meant for ironic ridicule (irony lost if not identified)<br><br>but now he's getting to skewer NGE otaku with Rebuild, re-purposing EVA as something to comment on NGE fans specifically in lieu of a general commentary on the anime otaku mindset<br><br>a real matryoshka of self-analysis, something every anime viewer should dutifully attempt</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  there's literally nothing to like about her in nge. She only starts to become likeable in the rebuilds, but by then we were all fapping it to Asuka's ass  <br>She's a miracle of the universe, I love her</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128076638 <br>What tropes did it start? The quiet grill with no emotions?</br>  <br>Her character is literally that she has no character, which works well within the context of the show, but outside of it it's just fucking boring.</br>   evangelion invented anime cliches   <br><br> Evangelion deconstructs entire mecha genre <br> only remembered because it flooded anime with <br> Blue haired 0-personality silent types <br> Red haired tsunderes <br> And incredibly generic looking pussy male MCs </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Blue haired 0-personality silent types <br>name another that fits this type<br><br> Red haired tsunderes <br>misty was from around the same time. is she the first asuka clone?<br><br> And incredibly generic looking pussy male MCs <br>there arent really that many that are as uselessly crippled like he is</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128074888 <br>good trips<br><br><br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128075232 <br> that Evangelion has created </br>  <br>why not</br>  <br>Robin Williams did. What does that tell you about Reifags?</br>  <br>Reifags are kill.</br>   there are people that actual like this vegetable   I will always like Rei     soulless doll that seems somewhat chill to be with near the end <br> annoying bitch that is just a pathetic sobbing heap of despair at the end that just wanted a pat on her back <br> drunk pure slut with daddy issues <br>Only option is not to play</br></br></br>  <br>they are so sad with their own taste that they end up committing suicide?</br>  So what's the big deal with Rei? I never understood why she's supposedly the best girl ever. <br><br> Are you faggots not man enough for Misato? </br></br>  Fred Durst likes Rei  <br> wanting a degenerate like misato </br>  Best girl  <br>Because when I jerk off to her all I end up seeing is my mom.</br>  <br>nice dubs, shinji kun</br>  <br>Noice...<br><br>I bet he likes to get really fucked up nightly.</br></br></br>  I like her.  <br> I never understood why she's supposedly the best girl ever <br><br>That's because she isn't.</br></br></br>  I'd imagine that when you realise theres no best girl, you get your own CONGRATULATIONS scene.<br><br> I refuse to accept that Asuka isn't best grill. </br></br>  <br>But Shinji likes her.</br>  <br> not choosing homo route </br>  <br>Is NGE now a Mecha Bisexual Harem anime?</br>    <br>Rei is the best girl ever.<br><br>Some people think she isn't because for the past ten-15 years now, there hasn't been any good material out for her but plenty for other characters in the Evangelion franchise.<br><br>They don't know any better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At its core that's all it ever was.</br>  I like her and every single one of her clones.  <br> Good  end.</br>  <br>That's what the game says at least.</br>  So I just finished the anime (a bit late, I know).<br>Am I supposed to watch EoE to get it all ?</br>  <br>Yep</br>  <br>Yeah basically</br>  <br><br>You do know they don't end up together in that way, right? They hold hands in a platonic sibling manner if anything. To get the good route, Shinji has to confess his love to a certain person.</br></br>  <br>Well it's a little late now to go spend another 1h30 before going to sleep.<br>But does the movie manage to give a sense to ep 25/26 beside it being Shinji finally getting what was his problem ? Or does it only tie the loose ends ?</br></br>  <br>I never played the game, just like that picture.</br>  <br> tfw nobody to ride my baloney pony </br>  <br>I like the part where he thanks his parents.</br>  <br>It's okay anon sex is overrated anyway</br>  <br><br>To get any good route in NGE2, you're required to confess your love to   Kaworu  , which prevents his death and therefore third impact and instrumentality. At the end of the route everyone lives and is fine, and Rei and Shinji talk about the hope and possibility of coexistence while holding hands.</br></br>  <br>I would at least like to confirm that for myself.</br>  <br>Fair enough</br>  <br>Sounds fun.</br>  I really love her.  <br>What book could she be reading?</br>  There's no other character in the history of anime or fiction (that I know of at least, please inform me if there is) that takes as many insults from the original creator and follow up spinoffs that remain this popular as Rei Ayanami.<br><br>The "new" Evangelion crowd might not like Rei because of how Rebuild and the spinoffs portray her, and because of Anno's and other creators statements on the character lead to a community that constantly dehumanizes and devalues Rei Ayanami as a character.<br><br>The whole "Anno forgot about Rei after ep 6" thing for instance actually makes a lot of people believe Rei is without value after that episode, that you're supposed to "forget" about Rei. This puts the crowd who believes that against the crowd who saw Evangelion in it's full.<br><br>Then there's the fans of other characters who Rei overshadowed completly, and that means everyone except maybe Shinji. So there's a lot of jealousy in the fanbase already, and in the early 2000's I remember a portion of the fanbase attacking Rei because "she wasn't supposed to be popular" and that the character's popularity was unjustified and whatnot.<br><br>That still persists today, meaning whatever you see now isn't something new.<br><br>Suffice to say, it shouldn't be like this, and I have trouble seeing the trend reversing. It would require an eye-for-an-eye sort of treatment for all the other characters to stabilize things to a fair level where characters only are considered rather than superficial moments and fan hatred.<br><br>Have a modified version of your pic related OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How to Win Friends and Influence People.</br>  <br>That's sort of bullshit because Rebuild as of 3.0 has descended into complete anime-otaku pandering territory.<br><br>You recognize the last Rebuild as being garbage, and because you yourself are an otaku, you don't want to accept that perhaps Anno can do wrong or actually show how much of an otaku he really is, you pretend it's somehow criticism.<br><br>It's not criticism, it's just bad otaku pandering. You won't let go of the mythos surrounding the man you've created in your mind.<br><br>You anon, are the otaku.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love her, she is my waifu.</br>  Because she's a massive slut and fucks even his brother and father when he's away.  I want to brush her hair.  <br>Don't you fuck up her hair or im gonna kill you</br>  <br>Widely spread shit taste.</br>  I love Rei so much<br>I like the calm and silent type</br>    Why is Rei so lovely that i just want to be with her?<br>I can't stop loving her.</br>  <br><br>Rei is cool because Nanto Suicho Ken is just fucking majestic.<br><br> Kaioh a slut </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how it feels?</br>  <br>I'm sure that it feels lovely and comfy.</br>  <br>How can you love a monster pretending to be a human?</br>  <br>Did you just call my waifu a monster?</br>  <br> if it's not human it's not okay to love it. </br>  <br>Are you the kind of person who thinks his pets love him?</br>  <br>Because if Rei is a monster, then monsters are superior to what you consider human in Evangelion.<br><br>Rei is the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Rei is the only one worth loving.</br>  <br>I don't know what else to call an eldritch abomination FROM SPACE.</br>  I love Rei!  <br>Not that guy, but the "pets" in Evangelion are the Lilin, Rei is the superior.</br>  <br>Don't they?<br>I mean, of course I don't think my motorcycle loves me.</br></br>  <br>Hey, she is not a monster.<br>Stop being a dick.</br></br>  <br>Bigger res, but not whole iamge</br>  <br>Awesome?<br><br>Plus Rei isn't an abomination. Nothing abominable about her.</br></br></br>  <br> not wanting wizardhood </br>  <br>That's rude.</br>  <br>Rei is by far the most popular Eva in Japan.

Current Evangelion has changed to move Rei out of the way and Kaworu into the front.<br><br><br>They seem to hate Rei even more, and there's more than just Evageeks when it comes to western otaku fandom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay, here's an fixed one:<br><br>1.

They blacklisted all translations for any interview relating to Kaworu because they hated him that much. Only know we get shit like the drafts and such because tumblr jumped on the Eva bandwagon thanks to 3.0. But before that they would actually bully you and force you to take your fanfics and artwork down if you didn't hate Kaworu's guts.</br></br>  <br>There's a lot of Reifags on Evageeks, there's always been. Kaworu has always been universally hated there though thanks to the gay panic scare.</br>  <br><br>I know enough to tell you that's nonsense concerning the translations/interview part, those have been available for me to check on the net since long before Rebuild 1.0 came out.<br>They did the same for Rei as well, you couldn't really post anything on Rei without having it pointed out that this was a "red" site.<br><br>There are a lot of Reifags everywhere, even on Evageeks but they're more subdued now due to movements in the franchise and in the community.<br><br>Kaworufags were scarce not because of anything Evageeks did, but because the character itself isn't appealing to masses without serious backing in terms of story. Unlike the other "big" characters of Evangelion, Kaworu doesn't have a good character with depth or development, it's got the BL/Shipping hook with Shinji and that's more or less that.<br><br>A community has formed around the latter with hopes for more, and it's really got nothing to do with any gay panic scare. That's just a rationalization for Kaworu's lack of character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gay panic scare <br>Just because people don't care about a one-episode character and would rather focus on the real character doesn't mean there's a gay scare.<br><br>If anything the only thing keeping Kaworu afloat as a character, it's love for fictional gay fantasy relationships. Because you know, it sure as hell isn't the character.<br><br>There's no gay panic scare as much as there's the opposite, a high interest in same-sex male relationships, something that has been since the earliest day of popular fiction.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally figuratively who??</br></br>  <br> I know enough to tell you that's nonsense concerning the translations/interview part <br>Nope. All Kaworu interviews including the June one mostly came from 4chan during the 3.0-era, some like the drafts around 2.0 but never beforehand. Before Rebuild, those interviews and supplemental materials were intentionally ignored and any discussion on episode 24 and Kaworu was summed up to "he was evil and Shinji hated him" next question sort of deal. <br>Although Evageeks has always been predominantly Asuka, as has the West as a whole, Reifags were definitely not scared off or threatened in anyway whatsoever as you like to pretend to fit your conspiracy bullshit. The Ayanami Rei Raising Project started as early as 2006 for example with lots of support. The only fighting really began with the shipping wars between LRS and LASfans, because Evageeks is retarded. <br>Before Rebuild the Western Eva fandom was pretty much a sausagefest so little to no Kaworu following makes sense, however the fact that any Kaworufan was directly scared off the board and all fanwork and fanfiction were bullied to deletion is what I'm talking about. The very presence of him made Evafans uncomfortable, and so they intentionally worked to never bring anything over that would suggest his popularity in Japan or truth as a positive character.<br><br><br>It's a gay panic scare because Kaworu made people uncomfortable. Take Touji and Kensuke as a counter example. No wonder cared if they were in a game or fanfic or not, they were indifferent to them. However if Kaworu was in that same work, they'd be subject to scrutiny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a gay panic scare because Kaworu made people uncomfortable.

However if Kaworu was in that same work, they'd be subject to scrutiny. <br><br>That's nonsense and you know it. There's no gay panic, because affection for gay characters and relationships is the almost the entire source for the characters popularity to begin with.</br></br></br>  What makes you think that? I like, just because I like the other female pilot more doesn't mean I don't like Rei.  <br>You can ignore my points all you want to make irrelevant statements. It won't change the truth on what the western Eva fandom was before Rebuild: pretty much controlled by Evageeks and their dictator-esque propaganda bullshit. Even the fact that official translations of the spin off manga s have afterwards and preface statements by people from Evageeks, shilling their shitty site is mere proof. You're clearly from the Rebuild era as you seem completely unaware and ignorant of what the fanbase was like beforehand, so I see no point in continuing this conversation with you. I'm not a fan of fighting fact with someone's accusatory bullshit just to fit his autistic conspiracies that no one takes seriously, especially when said person just tries to change the topic with strawmen when things don't go his way and he's discovered to not know what he's talking about like you're doing now. Have a good rest of your day, faggot.</br>  <br>Just because you didn't see anything, doesn't mean it wasn't there. Evageeks isn't the only source for material out there either.<br>While I'll agree they generally don't favor Kaworu, what you're saying is outright paranoid and seems to me wrong. Where's your proof?<br><br> Reifags were definitely not scared off or threatened in anyway whatsoever as you like to pretend to fit your conspiracy bullshit. <br>On Evageeks, they were, in particular Rei-relationship talk of any kind. While I didn't say "scared off", I said that it would be pointed out that it's a "red" site. Quite the difference; don't put words in my mouth like that.<br><br> Before Rebuild the Western Eva fandom was pretty much a sausagefest so little to no Kaworu following makes sense, however the fact that any Kaworufan was directly scared off the board and all fanwork and fanfiction were bullied to deletion is what I'm talking about. The very presence of him made Evafans uncomfortable, and so they intentionally worked to never bring anything over that would suggest his popularity in Japan or truth as a positive character. <br><br>This is paranoia, and outright wrong.<br><br>I want you to answer this:<br><br>Does Kaworu have anything even remotely close to the character development or depth any of the other has, or a position in the universe as strong as the rest in the original NGE?<br><br>If you're reasonable, you'll say the truth: no. He does not. <br><br>Kaworu in the original is a plot-device-ish character who actually thrives on the love and interest fans have in male/male relationships. What you say is a disadvantage is actually Kaworu's only and strongest advantage in those days.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>I have better things to do than argue with a manchild who pretends he knew what Eva and its fanbase was before Rebuild.</br></br></br>  <br>You're crazy. I was here before you (since the 1999-2000 era) and I know what I am talking about. You can't talk to anyone about conspiracy when you're actually saying there's a conspiracy against Kaworu/Kaworu fans. Where's your proof?<br><br>I'm not ignoring anything you've said, because what you've said is unsubstantiated nonsense and at best a childish bluff. <br><br>Let me repeat:<br>That's nonsense and you know it. There's no gay panic, because affection for gay characters and relationships is the almost the entire source for the characters popularity to begin with.<br><br>You know as well as I do that gay characters or characters with gay potential have a fandom surrounding them by just existing, and this fanbase is the exact fanbase and niche that popularizes Kaworu today.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br>Also blatant samefagging won't work in your favor. Also lying about the fact that you're a newfag to the Eva fanbase won't help much either. At least be honest that you're a Rebuildbabby instead of in denial.</br></br>  <br>Okay, so you have no proof, nothing, nothing even a reference and you want people to believe in your autist conspiracy theories.<br><br>I'm sorry for not letting you live out your victim-complex fantasy. Any idea, thought or belief can be argued for and defended if they hold any water. <br><br>Let me ask you again, and if you don't answer this simple question you really are just running away<br> Does Kaworu have anything even remotely close to the character development or depth any of the other has, or a position in the universe as strong as the rest in the original NGE? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br> can't respond in an adult manner <br> accuses everyone else instead of discussing the matter at hand <br><br>Try again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I adore her</br>  <br>See <br><br>How are those strawmen and topic changes coming along? Don't forget to use other anon's critisims against you and reflect it back at them for bonus points on sounding cool and crafty!</br></br></br>  <br>We can actually solve this you and I, this sounds like a really simple thing to discuss and clear up but you won't even provide any proof when asked and just attack me.<br><br>You're a coward. You know you're wrong and can't handle getting your fantasy challenged.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qV5<wbr>lzRHrGeg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>See <br><br>The only coward is the one who ignores the other's posts from the getgo and changes the topic to suit his meta and conspiracy theory interests. Must be nice having autism this intense.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do all her songs sound the same</br>  <br>You're the one ignoring posts not me.</br>  <br>Welcome to pop music anon.</br>  <br>You were literally asked to provide some evidence and you throw a tantrum? You don't have the right to call anyone autistic.<br><br>Do you seriously think you can come here and accuse an entire fanbase of conspiring against you and think that everyone will accept your word for it? <br>Not how the real world works.<br><br>I don't believe you and I doubt anyone else will either, but you could try being constructive and help along building your idea. That'll help, because right now you're being the WORST PR-demonstration for Kaworu fans. There's no wonder people hate you stormfront Kaworufag guys.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   it's impossible to have an intelligent, civil conversation with Kaworu fans <br><br>Nothing new.</br></br>  <br><br><br>See <br><br>Samefagging is not the way to go. I direct you to these posts for a reason, anon. In hopes you will read the original post before whining about evidence and making up a completely different topic than the one that was presented to you. Only you can choose to ignore it to further your meta conspiracy bullshit.<br><br>There's a reason why everyone ignored you in the comfy Evangelion merchandise thread. You're mentally insane, and noone wants part of your waifuwarring bullshit any longer. Now go back to /c/ with the rest of your shallow lack of discussion buddies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  da qtst  <br> can't defend himself <br> comes up with more conspiracy theories <br>Tell us all about how the USA is conspiring against Kaworu.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah yes, please bring up a topic that was never so much as mentioned from the beginning so you can waifuwar once again.<br>Tell me, how much does it hurt that everyone ignored you in the comfy Eva merch thread the other day? We're sick of you, and it's a good thing others are taking the hint in filtering you from their screens.</br></br>  <br>see <br>Go on.<br><br>No, seriously, don't. Stop projecting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are insane. Even if people try to reach out to you you still reject them, even when they basically tell you to elaborate.<br><br>First Evageeks conspired against Kaworu, then its the entire EVA fanbase, now it is /a/?<br><br>Take the hint. Stop being so delusional.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You were the one that began the fucking conspiracy bullshit to begin with you goddamned shitposter. You have a brain so fucking thick you don't get it's you everyone is sick of with your waifuwar/kaworufaggotry that derails every thread.<br><br>DOES THIS LOOK LIKE A KAWORU THREAD TO YOU?!</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>See <br><br>Is there a reason why you're so intent on samefagging? Also nice no-response on the merch thread and the shallow /c/ thread thing. Again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people point out he is retarded <br> must be samefag <br><br>The dreaded kaworufag shitposter everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> more conspiracy theories <br>You couldn't back up your previous one, why should I give a shit about the BS you're spouting now?<br><br>I wanted to have a conversation with you, turned out ugly fast once I asked for some proof.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>Please stop using another device to samefag only when after you're called out. It's unseemly. There's a reason everyone ignored you in the merch thread, you know.<br>Also, a the evidence you need was presented to you  and <br>All you presented is more meta waifufag bullshit, and then moved the topic once you knew you didn't know anything about the Eva fanbase pre-Rebuild. I worry for your mental health.</br></br></br></br></br>  Because if moot didn't like her then no one did.  <br> waah waaah muh conspiracy theory </br>  <br> tfw can't have eva thread without the kaworufag autist getting triggered </br>  <br>That's okay. I didn't expect you to provide any real argument or fact from the get-go anyway. See you later, Rebuildbabby.</br>  <br> hurr mech thread <br>Literally wasn't in it, which just makes your conspiracies seem worse.<br><br> evidence <br>That's not evidence, that's just statements without rational or logical backing.<br><br>It's just you soapboxing like you've done earlier. Give me proof. Give me evidence.<br>You are accusing an entire fanbase of something that sounds like you made it up entirely.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Evidence != you making up your own narrative.<br><br>Evidence is like a citation from a poster, or a link to a place where said behavior is shown. You don't have that.<br><br>Also, why the hell do you think people hate Kaworu for the gayness for? It's the only thing that makes the character popular to begin with. Imagine if there was no homo-erotic overtones or undertones with Kaworu at all, would the character even be a blip on the radar?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're going to just greentext and ignore entire posts to push a completely unrelated topic in the first place, then I see no reason to continue this conversation with you. Nonetheless blatant lying and constant samefagging tends to always be the case with you, which is more hints that I should back the fuck out of here before I waste anymore of my precious life and time interacting with someone as mentally idiotic as yourself.<br>My first mistake was responding to you beyond those evidence posts in the first place, you live off of the attention your parents and lack of friends never gave you after all.<br>I was never much of a children kind of guy, they're all pretty much whiny brats in my opinion and you sure prove that right. I suggest you eat your supper and go to sleep, it's past your bedtime and I've got shit to do. Can't wait for you to ruin another Eva thread with your victim-complexing bullshit once more. Hopefully everyone will ignore you like they did in the merch thread and like I should have done in this thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Threads on /c/ are usually just imagedumping.<br><br>The only threads with any discussion pertaining to the Eva characters are the Rei threads, which are often more text than images.<br><br>Not all threads but there is a pastebin of threads for you to check out if you are curious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, get a life. If every Kaworu fan is as horrid as you then itd no wonder you are loathed outside your containment areas.</br>  <br>Holy hell, no wonder you like such a shitty character. Can't handle adult conversation, can you? Go back to your /cm/ hugbox.<br><br> I don't have to give you evidence at all! No links, citations, HABEEEB IT </br></br></br>  Correct list for all you fags<br>1. Rei<br>2. Kaworu<br>3.Asuka<br>-999,999,999: Mari</br></br></br></br>  It's been 20 years. Can we stop pretending to like NGE already?<br><br>It's an extremely generic show that threw in some religious symbolism for the sake of having symbolism. None of it actually means anything. The only reason it went down the psychological conflict path is because they ran out of animation budget. And "deconstruction" is just a meme.<br>EoE was great, but there's no reason why it should retroactively make a 6/10 show into a 10/10 one.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128091824 <br> /cm/ tells me otherwise. There's more discussing going on there than anything in the shallow Reifag threads and the shitflinging ones here. No one shitflings or waifufags there. <br><br>But /cm/ isn't /c/. You might be right about there being more discussion, but I don't see what that has to do with /c/. <br>Picked a random thread from the pastbin they have:<br>https://archive.moe/c/thread/232409<wbr>6/<br><br>and that's discussion if you ask me. The rest of the /c/ threads are just imagedumps mostly, it's got some of the most discussion on the board outside maybe cross-board soccer threads.<br><br>Also, let me quote something by Megumi Hayashibara, Rei Ayanami's VA:<br><br>"There's no point in discussing Rei Ayanami."<br><br>That was said after Q came out in the booklet. There just isn't anything to discuss about Rei in Evangelion unless you want to stick to the past forever, while /cm/ threads have loads of more new stuff to speculate. Not really a big surprise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not Rei &gt; Asuka &gt; shit &gt; Kaworu &gt; Mari </br>  <br>Is Evangelion 2deep4u?</br>  <br>On the contrary. It's one of the easiest works to understand out there.<br>I don't get how there are entire wikis dedicated to some autist director telling his audience to stop using cartoons as escapism.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128091824 <br><br>It's also worth pointing out that Kaworu fans do invade Rei threads on /c/ to brag about it on /a/, and there's been some trolling by them in the Asuka thread too.<br><br>The lack of discussion in the last thread and just images has more to do with a Kaworufag spamming Kaworu-images in the thread, which doesn't exactly foster discussion and just pushes the image limit.<br><br>Kaworufags are a weird bunch. First they attack others and then have the gall to say they're the victims of some ancient Evangelion conspiracy?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I like you, Nagato.  Why does no one like her?  <br><br>Literally who?</br></br>  <br>/c/ only discusses Rei, because Reifags only like Rei and couldn't care less about any other Eva character.<br>/cm/ discusses all Eva characters and Eva in general. In fact two threads ago almost the entire thread was dedicated towards a fight between two anons where one was defending Asuka and saying she was justified in her actions towards Shinji; despite being a Kaworu/Shinji/homolust/whateverthef<wbr>uckfag. That's not shallow. <br><br><br><br><br><br>Don't accuse one shitposter and then pretend like the shitposters on your side don't even exist. Again proving my point that you hate the posting and existence of other characters in your hugbox threads and couldn't care less about discussing or acknowledging them. You're a very, very shallow waifufag. You don't even like Eva, you just like Rei. You're the worst absolute cancer there is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>dont be reitarded. Rei is one of the most popular characters in anime</br></br>  <br>It's shallow as fuck because Kaworufags even in those discussions never go in depth.</br>  <br>If you read the conversation, you'd see yes, they do. Much more than shallow fucking Reifags ever both to do. All they care about is jerking eachother off over how kawaii and uguu she is. <br>They don't even really care about her, if she was a male they wouldn't even give two shits about her from the beginning. It's the fact that she's a girl that they can whiteknight proves how fucking shallow and disgusting they are.</br></br>  <br>What you just said about Kaworufans being nice is totally overshadowed by your hatred for Rei and Rei fans.<br><br>Rei fans dont invade other peoples threads like you do.</br></br></br>  <br> Kaworufans being nice <br>Please point me to where exactly in my post I said that. Thanks.</br></br>  <br>/c/'s Rei thread is for Rei, I don't see any problem in talking about Rei there, and only Rei. Unlike /cm/, there's a thread dedicated to each character instead of having one mega-thread.<br><br>Rei fans, like most fans who aren't in a containment zone, discuss other characters on /a/. As it should be.<br><br>I was only talking about /c/ threads, the culture is different from /cm/ threads.<br><br>Also, from what I see Kaworu fans generally hate other characters. Post from /cm/ related.<br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>2960757</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Talking shipping isn't really going in-depth, and fantasizing/fanwanking isn't very indepth discussion either.<br>That whole thread you had is just people jerking each other off.</br></br>  <br>What is like?</br>  <br>you're the living proof that homosexuals should all be gassed</br>  <br> https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/<wbr>#2960757</wbr> <br>So posting one post that is completely drowned out by the thousands of threads where other characters are celebrated counts? Oh anon, you're too cute.<br>What's hilarious is your shitty /c/ threads don't even have you discussing Rei. And you have to pull out that Hayashibara quote to defend your shallowness. By the way, Hayashibara is also a Kaworufag.<br><br><br> Talking shipping isn't really going in-depth <br>Then it's a good thing no one in that conversation was doing that. Nice reading comprehension.<br><br><br>Starting with you, I'm assuming. Biggest faggot in this thread by far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I cried when Kaworu died.</br>  <br>Those post are just blanket statements and opinions. "I really like everyone except I'll go on a tirade about how this character is shit and evil."</br>  Ritsuko a disgusting slut. Worst character in the series with no redeeming qualities. Worse than her mother.  Asuka &gt; Kaworu &gt; Misato<br><br>Rei isn't even on my list.</br></br>  <br>Are all Reifags incapable of reading like you?<br/></br>  <br>do humanity a favour and kill yourself already, you cancerous faggot<br>your worthless scum and nobody will ever like you</br></br>  <br>Why are those red things always in her hair?</br>  <br> So posting one post that is completely drowned out by the thousands of threads where other characters are celebrated counts? Oh anon, you're too cute. <br><br>Have another.<br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>q2960528<br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>q2960620<br><br>plenty more from that thread alone.<br><br> What's hilarious is your shitty /c/ threads don't even have you discussing Rei. <br>The thread I linked you had discussion on Rei.<br>I told you the /cm/ might have more discussion, and explained why.<br><br> And you have to pull out that Hayashibara quote to defend your shallowness. <br>Can't you at least consider the quote before you attack?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're just berets in this picture. Usually, it's just a part of her plugsuit.</br>  <br>It's sort of reading a post about how eating fatty foods are bad, and then ending it with "brb gonna eat lots of cake now".<br><br>That thread idolizes the characters a lot, so it just makes it seem like empty words.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Kaworufag gets BTFO earlier <br> comes limping back attacking other fans for no reason <br><br>Why don't you answer the question you couldn't answer before: <br> Does Kaworu have anything even remotely close to the character development or depth any of the other has, or a position in the universe as strong as the rest in the original NGE? <br><br>or try to give us the "evidence" of your shitty conspiracy theory?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I thought they were part of the suit but she still always seems to have them on.</br>  <br>Refusing to pay in a manchild's immature games is not getting 'BTFO'. Especially considering you have made not one attempt at engaging in the conversation rationally and maturely from the start.</br>  <br>Why don't you answer it? Where's the evidence?</br>  <br>Take a shower, you virgin autist. You're just a burden to your parents at this point and all the girls at school consider you a creep and talk shit about you behind your back.</br>  <br> plenty more from that thread alone <br>No, those are literally the only ones from that thread. Among there being posts pro-Rei as well. Nice to see that there's a diverse hivemind instead of a bunch of fat neckbeards jerking it to their uguu submissive waifu princess like in your shit infestations. <br><br> The thread I linked you had discussion on Rei <br>Meta about Rei Q is not discussion. It's just more complaining about Rebuild because that's all you retarded faggots can muster.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a difference between the thread you link and any other /c/ thread. These are:<br><br>- /cm/ thread is a general thread<br>This means the topic at hand is a lot broader, it's an Evangelion general not a Kaworu general or any other character general. The Rei /c/ thread is a thread for Rei, just like the Asuka one is on /c/. The discussion in those threads should stay on topic of Rei.<br>/a/ is used for general discussion of all characters and the story/plot.<br><br>To quote the sticky:<br> Finally, as much as /a/ is a discussion board, /c/ is a board for sharing images. <br><br>It's not really a discussion board, but there's plenty of discussion to begin with.<br><br>- There is currently nothing to discuss concerning Rei Ayanami in Rebuilds or spinoffs<br>Unless you want to drone on about how everything is pointless, simply being appreciative of Rei is the less turbulent way to go. I'm sure we can agree here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a reason why you ignored the very beginning posts of my case, the very beginning of the argument? Is there a reason why I linked back to it in every other response to you? Is there a reason why I still have yet to receive a reply?<br><br>The answer to all these questions is an unfortunate yes, you mentally deficient manchild.</br></br></br>  <br>the /c/ OPs always say there is an encouragement of Rei discussion. And yet there never is any. Reifags don't care about discussing her, or any other part of Eva or its characters. They only care about fapping to how kawaii she is and complaining about meta shit. Pathetic.<br><br>The fact that your entire 'love' and obsession for her relies on something simple like her gender and ability to whiteknight her only proves you don't even really love or care for her in the first place. Get rekt, autist.</br></br></br>  <br> No, those are literally the only ones from that thread. <br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>q2960761<br><br>Have another one. There's plenty more.<br><br>Just pick any thread.<br>https://fgts.jp/cm/thread/2959138/#<wbr>2960579<br><br>There's bound to come up something in every one of them, it's the same sort of victim-complex about EVA-geeks. Wouldn't be surprised if that poster is you, although I'm not saying it is.<br><br> Meta about Rei Q is not discussion. It's just more complaining about Rebuild because that's all you retarded faggots can muster. <br>It's discussing the original Rei in the context of the new, that is discussion.<br><br>It IS complaining, but if you can take away your hateboner a little bit, isn't the complaining justified?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Because she loves being an Eva pilot and wants everyone to recognize she is one. Wearing the headset is her way of flaunting it. She still takes them off when showering and sleeping.</br>  <br>Aren't you just projecting now? The whole "gender" thing is more up your own alley, being BL fetishists and all.</br>  <br> being this mad <br> being this much of an autistic retard <br> being this pathetic <br><br>Kaworufags everyone, they're a joke that never gets old</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And in the same thread there's<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/cm/2959515 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/cm/2960631 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/cm/2960668  <br>Sorry that not everyone in this fanbase likes to act like a hivemind with the same exact opinion and austim as yourself, Reifag. Again, I don't really have to take this shit from someone as shallow as yourself who doesn't even really like Rei; you just like the fantasy idea of her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And yet there never is any <br>There was plenty in the thread linked earlier.<br><br>Reifags do plenty of discussing on /a/ along with others. Rei threads are for Rei, Asuka threads are for Asuka. <br><br>If anything you're the odd one out because you have to do "your" discussion away from everyone else. Also the whole "you wouldn't like her if she was male!" is dumb because that's more true for you guys. Reifags or Asuka fans don't like any character because they are female, and take REi Q as the example. Cute, waifu-like, but nobody likes that character.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> There was plenty in the thread linked earlier <br>When will you learn that meta isn't discussion?<br><br> Reifags do plenty of discussing on /a/ along with others <br>No, all you do is complain and be annoying nowadays. Before 3.0 all you did was ship and be annoying, alternatively. <br> is dumb because that's more true for you guys <br>How so? There's so much genderbent Kaworu and Kawoshin art it's not even fucking funny. Do I need to point you to the countless Eva doujins of Kaworu x female Shinji? That's not BL, retard. It's hetshipping and Kaworufags still ship enjoy it anyway. Dynamic &gt; gender. Unlike Reifags, of course. Which is why they prefer a inferior character over someone as great as Shinji, who they are ultimately indifferent towards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, the stuff you linked wasn't very good.<br><br> Shinji was a dick and deserved it in my opinion. <br><br>How is this really "nice" ? Also <br> The only person who doesn't deserve endless suffering in the show is Touji, Kensuke, Misato, and Rei. <br> And Yui or whatever. <br>is sort of hateful. Everyone except those deserve endless suffering? REALLY?<br><br>and the rest is the complaints about thinking stuff is cute:<br> I love seeing cute art of the boys (and the girls too! I think Rei and Asuka are cute too) <br><br>The middle one is insane fanwank that not very deep or interesting at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "nice" <br>No one ever fucking said anything about nice. Stop making up bullshit no one ever even implied you goddamn autist. Your stupidity is revolting and disgusting.<br><br>Also, nice downplaying of posts. At least it's not meta and bitching about m-muh Rei! Fuck every other Eva character that isn't muh Rei!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't you just proving my point? It's all about shipping.<br><br>You don't care about the character, because it's all a fantasy game to you.</br></br></br>  <br> please pay attention to us Reifags! <br> we need attention! <br> pls ;-; </br></br></br>  <br>It is bitching about Rei. In a Kaworu thread. You guys come here to attack Rei, to /c/ and meddle with the threads there, and you can't stop talking about Rei in even your own threads.<br><br>I point out that it's not nice because you are fake, false and hateful.</br></br></br>  <br> Kaworuags don't care about discussing him, or any other part of Eva or its characters. They only care about fapping to how gay he is and complaining about conspiracy shit. Pathetic. <br><br> The fact that your entire 'love' and obsession for him relies on something simple like his sexuality and ability to ship him with Shinji only proves you don't even really love or care for him in the first place. Get rekt, autist. <br><br>Notice something about the baseless accusations you spout yet?  And ironically enough the flipped version is probably actually true. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You bring up BL so of course I'm going to respond. How hilarious you have to ignore every single other of my points because you can't argue. Just like with the earlier conversation. <br>BTFO once again.<br><br><br> m-muh ebin conspiracies <br> please believe them pl0x <br><br><br> And ironically enough the flipped version is probably actually true <br>The genderbent shit proves it isn't. The popularity of LAK and even LRK proves it isn't. Yet Reifags only care about Rei because she's a girl to whiteknight into. Sick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rei fans have always been a force for solid discussion on /a/ since way before you even found your way here. You on the other hand, haven't, the only input you have is attacking others like you've done in this thread or defend your ship, the latter which leads to discussions that should have ended if both parts were reasonable - you aren't the reasonable part by the way.<br><br>If you call the discussion on /c/ "meta", then so is the /cm/ discussion because it discusses Kaworu/etc in a metafictional context, character relations outside the work and so on. Why are you ragging on Rei fans for doing it as well?<br><br>And the last bit is nonsensical, there are genderbent versions of every EVA-character, but what you wrote just points out something interesting - Kaworu isn't female, neither is Shinji. So it's just about shipping with you, isn't it? The fantasy "dynamic" as opposed to the meat and story of the show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just linked to a post on /cm/ complaining about Rei. Here: <br>that is your post, and if not it's still proof that gets done.<br><br>It's not really a conspiracy theory when you yourself provided the evidence. Then what about all of your savage attacks ITT?<br>This is getting archived. <br><br>All everyone has to do is to link this thread to show how much of a problem some Kaworu fans are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sick. <br><br>Where do ridiculous moralfags like you escape from just to find their way to /a/ of all places</br></br></br>  <br> Rei fans have always been a force for solid discussion on /a/ <br>Yeah, that ebin "Rei won the Eva!" 2.0 cherade was really great discussion. Truly the best. Reifags parts in the Red vs Blue waifuwars were also great and solid discussion. Really goes to show just how intricate this series is for its fans :^)<br><br> he only input you have is attacking others <br>Says the Reifag who was so concerned on meta and Kaworufags a shit rhetoric she couldn't even bother to respond to the very first post in the conversation. Change your tampon. <br> Why are you ragging on Rei fans for doing it as well? <br>Because that's ALL you do. And you even do it by attacking other characterfans as well, downplaying Asuka Misato and Kaworu any chance you get.<br><br><br> Kaworu isn't female <br>He's not male either. In fact, he's more female because he's the mother of the angels than anything. <br> The fantasy "dynamic" <br>The point is that Kaworu would love Shinji no matter what gender he was, because who he is as a person doesn't change. Likewise fans wouldn't care what gender either of them was because the love and dynamic wouldn't change. For Reifags it's different. Even though Rei as a person and character wouldn't change, they wouldn't give two shits about her anymore if she was male.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I ignored your points, I sort of sunk your entire argument. When it's about shipping dynamics and not character, then you can hardly call your investment into Evangelion worthwhile.<br>It's the total and complete idolization, the "genderbent" thing is really just an expansion of uke/seme dynamics and genderbending in itself is a fetish you know.<br><br>If you ask me, it seems that none of you do respect Kaworu's character. Because otherwise you'd actually feel offended by the portrayal, since Kaworu is on paper a ridiculously bad character except for the aforementioned purpose.<br><br>You'd take shallow shipping over actual character, and Rei fans and most Asuka fans or other regular "Eva fans" won't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since when was /a/ your hugbox for being an ugly autist outcast? Go fuck off to tumblr if you want that shit.<br><br><br> all of your savage attacks ITT? <br>The savage attacks started with the Reifag going on about how Kaworufags are the worst, how they're animals, blah blah more metashit showing what a hateful disgusting person you are. I'm glad the thread is getting archived, it shows how you're incapable of kindness and respect, you just like to insult others to feel better about yourself. It's very unbecoming Reifag, and it shows here and in the /c/ threads. You're selfish and shallow and couldn't give a damn about Eva or the other Eva characters. /cm/ proves that we are otherwise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, that ebin "Rei won the Eva!" 2.0 cherade was really great discussion. Truly the best. Reifags parts in the Red vs Blue waifuwars were also great and solid discussion. Really goes to show just how intricate this series is for its fans :^) <br><br>As if that was the only discussion, and even then it's not even a fraction as bad as it is now. /a/ and Evangelion existed far before 2009 and Rebuild.<br><br> Says the Reifag who was so concerned on meta and Kaworufags a shit rhetoric she couldn't even bother to respond to the very first post in the conversation. <br>What first post?<br><br> Because that's ALL you do. And you even do it by attacking other characterfans as well, downplaying Asuka Misato and Kaworu any chance you get. <br>That has been your entire role this thread and presumably you're the hater-part in the /cm/ threads linked as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit, you're insane. Literally none of that happened ITT.</br>  <br> I don't think I ignored your points, I sort of sunk your entire argument <br>Then by all means go back to the very first post and notice how you only responded to the very last line of it.<br> rest of your post <br>The original argument had nothing to do with that and you know it.<br>You continue to show how much of a hateful being you are, rotten with jealousy and anger.<br><br><br> lying on the internet <br>Well, that's what you did from the beginning. Can't say I'm surprised.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it make you feel better to lie and continue acting full of hatred and bitterness? Does it feel nice? Do you feel a lot better about yourself now that you've put another one down, anon?</br>  <br> He's not male either. In fact, he's more female because he's the mother of the angels than anything.  <br>He's presented as male and is discussed as male in the series. Your fanwank doesn't really show anything here.<br><br> The point is that Kaworu would love Shinji no matter what gender he was, because who he is as a person doesn't change. <br>Because that is also all he is, a non-developing character who is more like a plot device.<br><br>Kaworu doesn't switch genders or suddenly grow boobs or wider hips, so this is just an extension of your shipping logic. Kaworu isn't anything more than a fantasy-enabler, so that allows you to more or less ignore character and everything else.<br><br>I also think your conjecture regarding Rei is nonsensical, people like Rei for who she is, not for who she isn't. That's the difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im referring to your defense of Kaworu fans.<br><br>Pointing out some discussion doesnt get rid off your apalling behavior ITT.</br></br></br>  <br> Then by all means go back to the very first post and notice how you only responded to the very last line of it. <br>Which post?<br><br> The original argument had nothing to do with that and you know it. <br>Sure it did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're entitled to spout all the bullshit you want, but don't pretend to be surprised when people call you a moralfag for using a moralfag's language. You're only a few uses of "Ugh." or "creepy" away from fitting into tumblr very well yourself, mate.</br>  <br>Projecting much?</br>  <br> He's presented as male and is discussed as male in the series <br>Just like Ryo was presented as male and discussed as male in the beginning. Kaworu calls Adam the mother, and EoE shows him with boobs for one frame.<br> a non-developing character who is more like a plot device <br>Whatever he is, the fact that fans like him because of that more than his gender is where the difference between me and you is shown.<br>You like Rei because she's a girl first and foremost, no what she is inside; which wouldn't change no matter the gender or outside appearance mind you. A fantasy for the sadistic otaku who wish to whiteknight her.</br></br></br></br></br>   this thread   <br>Right now, Kaworu fag?<br><br>You're proving them right. You're proving not just the Reifags you fear so much right, but every Evangelion fan that has said something bad about your fandom ever. How can you justify this thread? I'm starting to wonder if you made it just to create a shitstorm.</br></br></br>  <br> Which post? <br>The very first post of our original discussion. Your a big boy, I'm sure you can find it by scrolling up, can't you? You don't need daddy's help, I'm sure.<br><br><br>Construing and making up meaning from posts that were never there in the first place just supports how barbaric you are in crafting your conspiracy theories. More 'evidence' so you can bash other Eva characters and the fans that so happen to like them other than you're waifu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Just like Ryo was presented as male and discussed as male in the beginning. Kaworu calls Adam the mother, and EoE shows him with boobs for one frame. <br>Doesn't exactly make him female, the trippy images of EoE show many things.<br><br>The character itself is officially male, as shown in the Evangelion TV-series as well as the official description.<br><br> Whatever he is, the fact that fans like him because of that more than his gender is where the difference between me and you is shown. <br>Well, here's the thing, the fans like Kaworu because he's an BL device. That can easily get twisted into genderbending, which is a fetish in itself. You know this.<br><br> You like Rei because she's a girl first and foremost, no what she is inside; which wouldn't change no matter the gender or outside appearance mind you. <br>Speaking for myself, I know that's not true.<br><br>If we look at Rei fans world wide, they don't like characters like Rei Q or the poor spinoff versions which fail to portray Rei, which would prove you quite wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thinking 4chan was made for you to feel wanted and anything other the retarded monkey that you are proves you'd be more fit on someplace like tumblr. Maybe even /r9k/. There are hugboxes for disgusting trash like yourself, so fuck off there if you want to feel validated.<br><br>Yes, I know you are. So please fuck off to the appropriate place where that kind of thinking is accepted. I suggest tumblr.<br><br><br> You're proving not just the Reifags you fear so much right <br>Anon, there is no fear. Only distaste for your tendency to cause strife and shitflinging between members of the Evafanbase out of your own jealousy and bitterness. It's barbaric and disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But you are the conspiracy theory guy.<br>The whole western fandom vs kaworu was your string of posts wasnt it?</br></br>  <br>You actually have to point it out. This thread is really long and I'm guessing you're referring to another anon.</br>  <br> Doesn't exactly make him female <br>He's an angel, it's not either either. Just like Rei isn't either.<br> the trippy images of EoE show many things. <br>For a reason.<br><br> the fans like Kaworu because he's an BL device <br>LAK and LRK are things, Genderbent Kaworu is a thing, and it all the more proves something like gender or yaoishipping does not take the priority in liking Kaworu. However for Reifags like yourself, it does.<br> Speaking for myself, I know that's not true <br>It is. You wouldn't care about Rei if she was a guy and you know it. Stop lying. You're shallow.<br> the poor spinoff versions which fail to portray Rei <br>Wrong. They liked Angelic Days Rei and GoS Rei a lot. Even SIRP Rei is very genki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You've just revealed your own shallowness.<br><br>You worship a ship, not a character or a set of characters. Because you literally don't care about the plot, the setting or the characters as long as it feeds your ship.<br>That explains why you tend to defend 3.0 and even ANIMA as well as other bad fanfiction.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The whole western fandom vs kaworu was your string of posts  <br>Nope, and it never was. I'd love for you to read the original post and understand what the topic was, anon. I'm afraid you don't know how to read.<br><br><br>If you can't point out where the beginning of a conversation starts, then I'm sorry for you on multiple levels anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's quite funny how quick you are at jumping to the wildest conclusions, but just for the record: I certainly don't need validation from someone like you. Well, one might argue that getting heat from a moron like you is its own kind of validation, but let us not be nitpicky. Anyway I'm perfectly fine right here on /a/, why thank you.</br>  <br>this picture has single-handedly called my entire world into question</br>  <br> He's an angel, it's not either either. Just like Rei isn't either. <br>Rei would be a female by any standard, biologically speaking. In both presentation and form, Rei is female, as presented by the original author both in-universe and story.<br>If we start pretending she's somehow male, then we'd be going against what Rei actually is. While it's a fun thing to imagine, it's not really Rei as she is in the canon.<br><br>The same goes for Kaworu.<br><br> For a reason. <br>But no reason that actually gives you the right here.<br><br> LAK and LRK are things, Genderbent Kaworu is a thing, and it all the more proves something like gender or yaoishipping does not take the priority in liking Kaworu. However for Reifags like yourself, it does. <br>Doesn't those involve both Asuka and Rei? Your argument is at best a standstill, and there are more crackships than you can count.<br><br>Yaoishipping is the overwhelming portion of Kaworu fandom, that's undeniable.<br><br> It is. You wouldn't care about Rei if she was a guy and you know it. Stop lying. You're shallow. <br>I'm fairly sure I would. Most of my favorite characters in fiction are male, and Shinji is one of them for instance.<br>Also this is conjecture, I might as well say the same for you and Kaworu. I don't do that because I prefer arguments that can be evidenced.<br><br> Wrong. They liked Angelic Days Rei and GoS Rei a lot. Even SIRP Rei is very genki. <br>I don't see much fanart coming out from that, nor much real discussion. So that's a no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You've just revealed your own shallowness. <br>How so? By proving I'd still care about Kaworu and Shinji regardless of their gender? Same as with any other Eva character? I didn't watch it for cute girls doing cute things unlike yourself.<br> You worship a ship <br>Never said, and I point out LAK and LRK are things as well.<br> not a character or a set of characters Because you literally don't care about the plot, the setting or the characters <br>I point out my love for other characters in this very thread, as well as my love for Eva as a whole. Unlike you, who point out again and again you only care about Rei.<br> That explains why you tend to defend 3.0 and even ANIMA as well as other bad fanfiction <br>Something I never did once in this thread? Thanks for proving your paranoia and more baseless hatred on your end. I see this conversation ending in the same way the last one did. You backing out and resorting to ad hominem like usual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ao you arent the idiot who thinks the western fanbase conspired against Kaworu?</br>  <br> If you can't point out where the beginning of a conversation starts, then I'm sorry for you on multiple levels anon. <br>The burden of proof is on you. You have been shitposting this thread to death.</br></br>  <br>If you're so petty that you actual get enjoyment out of attacking other anons then I know all I need right there. Say on /a/ and continue to vent your insecurities and self-hatred, it's all the same to me.</br>  <br>Spoonfeeding is looked down around here, newfriend. If you can't read then all the more power to you, I guess.<br><br><br>You do realize I can see your IP, right? Would you like me to point out all the different times you've samefagged this thread for everyone? I'd post your IP as well so anons can have at it, but I don't want to get banned.</br></br></br></br>  <br> How so? By proving I'd still care about Kaworu and Shinji regardless of their gender?  <br>You can't really prove it, since they are male and male respectively. If you genderbend them, that's just you taking liberties with their character that also fetishists do. It just makes it worse really.<br><br> Never said, and I point out LAK and LRK are things as well. <br>So? Those include Asuka and Rei so that scuttles your argument anyway.<br><br> I point out my love for other characters in this very thread, as well as my love for Eva as a whole. Unlike you, who point out again and again you only care about Rei. <br>Your hatred for other people and characters tell a different story.<br><br>You won't sell the lie that you like other characerts after your display here today.<br><br> Something I never did once in this thread?  <br>"You" as in plural you referring to the /cm/ thread you linked. Yeah, I read it. I was not imperssed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You do realize I can see your IP, right? <br>Wait, how?</br></br>  <br>By all means post it. <br><br>Im not samefagging and you didnt answer my question.<br><br>Are you the conspiracytheory kaworufag earlier in this thread?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you're so petty that you actual get enjoyment out of attacking other anons then I know all I need right there. Say on /a/ and continue to vent your insecurities and self-hatred <br> All this projection <br><br>Does the ride ever end?  I certainly hope not, shit's too funny. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If you won't link me the post I'm supposed to see, then I guess there is no post. Spoonfeeding isn't used in situations like these either.</br>  <br>Rei doesn't change who she is as a character or her arc, actions, and role by something as insignificant as gender. Arguing otherwise proves your shallow. Your otaku desire to whiteknight and fantasize about her in a sexual manner shows that you never loved her for her from the start.<br> I'm fairly sure I would.  <br>I'm fairly certain I can see your lying jew nose peeking from under that post. Funny how you pretend to care about Shinji and are so indifferent to him it's hilarious.<br> I don't see much fanart coming out from that, nor much real discussion. <br>The fact that the same genki Rei is present in all these spinoffs that are financially successful shows that Reifags like her, even though she acts nothing like Rei. Figures of Rei genki smiling with cat ears sell like hotcakes and prove the otaku fetishism from her fans. They don't care about her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't see other people's IP. You can count IP's but not see them. I guess only mods can do so, or janitors possibly.<br><br> The Kaworufag has gone insane. </br></br></br>  <br> Name another that fits this type <br>Yin from DTB</br></br>  <br>I could post yours if you really want me too. Hope you don't have any credit card information saved on your computer, anon-kun. I've been looking for some cash to spend on a really nice Kaworu figure lately.</br>  <br> something as insignificant as gender <br>That's some grade-A tumblr shit right there. But I guess it's to be expected from a literal faggot.</br></br>  <br> Rei doesn't change who she is as a character or her arc, actions, and role by something as insignificant as gender. Arguing otherwise proves your shallow. <br>The simple retort is that Rei doesn't change her gender in the TV-series from male to female. I mean, forcing genderbending on a character is something you can do for fun, but you're taking it to comical levels of nonsense.<br><br>You'd also have to change all sorts of things, don't you know Rei is based on Yui? Yui is female.<br><br> The fact that the same genki Rei is present in all these spinoffs that are financially successful shows that Reifags like her, even though she acts nothing like Rei. Figures of Rei genki smiling with cat ears sell like hotcakes and prove the otaku fetishism from her fans. They don't care about her. <br>Rei acts "genki" in the original series, doesn't she? Cute stuff sells well also, and Rei's attraction points is that she is cute. Most anime characters are.<br><br>But character in Rei's case reign supreme, otherwise you can have characters like Rei Q. A simple figure of Rei selling well only tells you people like Rei.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Post mine.</br>  <br>Disable your anti-virus program.</br>  <br>Is this really how low you're going to go?

Nobody likes the abusive steak dinner.</br>  You just got captured by one of the Nazarick guardian and you have 3 options:<br><br>1. Get kill and become undead <br>2. Become an experiment for Demiurge<br>3. Become meats for the maids</br></br></br></br>  <br>Define " Become meats for the maids"</br>  <br>I think it's pretty obvious</br>  <br>Entoma is eating a human arm that was fried as if it were shrimp, what do you think it means?<br><br> I would like to become food for CZ2128. </br></br></br>  <br>Are we talking about sex or you becoming their literal food?</br>  <br>The image isn't clear enough?</br>  How exactly does Albedo plan to  bone  Momonga if he's got no benis? He doesn't appear to have an interest in obtaining one, either.  <br>If there's a crazy will there is an extremely fucked up way.</br>  <br>stop looking at me like that donut</br>  <br>Albedo is likely in for the long term, if she reserts herself as the top female in Nazarick she's in a good position for when Ainz does think about an heir, the issue of Ding can be resolved then.</br>  <br>You want to become machine oil?</br>  From previous thread.<br>Funi sub rip: http://pastebin.com/43X55q7x<br>Raws: http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>11746</wbr></br></br>  <br>Everyone in Nazarick believes the supreme beings to be gods, so they don't bother trying to apply logic with them.<br><br>Plus Ainz could always just wish for one with a spell.</br></br></br>  <br>Majyyck pOnOs<br><br>Secret 20th rank magic</br></br></br>  <br>well he could technically just become regular oil and then go through whatever crafting methods they have in Nazarick to become machine oil. How about anon, do you know a good swamp you want to die in?</br>  <br>I'll oil her up, alright.<br><br> But seriously, it's probably the option with the least amount of pain if we're assuming slavery after death is unending torment. You don't want to be one of Demiurge's "two-legged sheep", or eaten by Solution. <br> Yuri is the other safe option, but she'd probably eat you out of loyalty. </br></br></br></br>  <br>in order of safety by maids it would likely go<br>Shizu&gt;Yuri&gt;Nabel&gt;Lupus&gt;Entoma&gt;Solut<wbr>ion</wbr></br></br>  I really like how they are doing Albedo's reactions.  <br>I thought Lupus was supposed to be extremely cruel? I also heard that while Entoma's favorite food is humans, she doesn't really care enough to harm humans if she's full and they don't bother her.</br>  <br>What is Albedo exactly? I think I may have zoned out if he did say what she is or not.</br>  <br>Imp</br>    <br><br>Not going to lie I thought she was like a human dragon hybrid or something. Didn't expect and imp.</br></br>  <br>Well she's got 20 levels in some other things too.</br>  <br>From what I can tell, Imp is sort of like the "base" for the other demonic races. If I'm, remembering right she also has levels in succubus and other stuff.</br>  <br>imp's likely one of her lower racial levels, the shown levels aren't all of them. She has mentioned having succubus blood so there's a least another 10 there. Anybody recall what the higher tier for a sucubutt would be?</br>  <br>What do humans taste like? I've always wondered because despite the moralfaggotry with eating a human it should be no different since humans are different from animals.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=21R<wbr>WUIFHD_s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Similar to Pork iirc</br>  <br>If I remember it's similar to pig</br>  <br>IIRC some scientist guys documented on the taste of human flesh, don't remember any of the details for it though.</br>   all these people debating who Momonga will fug <br>He put his first ring on the best  boy_  already.</br>  <br>He won't fuck anyone. He is a skeleton. He has no penis.</br>  <br>Oh he has a penis alright.<br><br>Mare's. Right through here.</br></br></br>  So after gauging people's reactions here and there, I think it's almost to safe to say that the only people who didn't complain about the pacing are light novel readers.<br><br>Why do people want to see meaningless action so badly?</br></br>  <br>She's a Succubutt Blackguard.</br>  <br>He has 8 fingers and two thumbs as well as an large pool of magical powers. Trust me, a penis isn't needed.</br>  <br>A magic caster's staff has a knob on the end<br><br>This should be thread theme of Overlord generals</br></br></br>  <br>Stop being so lewd guys.</br>  <br>All D&amp;D fags know that Create Penis is only a 5th lvl spell so he can most likely even do Create Greater Dragon Penis by now.</br>  So how come vampire was engaging in airborne magical fisticuffs with papabones in the OP?  <br>It's a thing that creates a lot of division.<br>Some people prefer world building, character development, interactions, etc.<br>Others prefer fast paced action.<br><br>For me it's all about world building, I just want to know more about the characters and their motivations, the world they inhabit, etc.<br>Kinda how log horizon (anime) has shit battles, and the raids are pretty fucking boring unless there's some exposition going on, but the world and characters are pretty cool.<br><br><br>He could cast a penor, why not.<br>Or use some spell to change appearance for a while. It's not unheard of.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the vampire.</br>  <br>I want to become Shalltear's sex slave.</br>  <br>Either read the LN, or wait on the Anime. I'm not going to spoil anything.</br>  <br>Look at the blushing gorilla</br>  <br>Well, since Arche  is no longer there , she has an opening.</br>  Will we be seeing lots of Shalltear in the future as well?<br><br>Will the maids be big side characters as well? I have a soft spot for "elite squads" of characters.</br></br>  Wait, it just occurred to me. is Ninya's sister  Toile ?  <br>Yes to both.</br>  <br>Checked the archives, some anons say it's more similar to veal than pork. Nobody says it tastes bad though.</br>  <br> slowbonek.jpg </br>      <br>It's a failing of mine.</br>  <br> Will we be seeing lots of Shalltear in the future as well? <br>Haha you have no idea.</br></br>  <br>But only two of them eat humans.</br>  i dont like how the oversexualize albedo in the OP  <br> Will the maids be big side characters as well? <br><br>Only best maid Narberal.</br></br></br>  <br>Momonga is a good role player.</br>  <br> Sense of Justice -500 <br>But he saves people all the time, Touch Me must have had a heck of an influence on him</br></br>  <br>so, the funimation version is still shit?</br>  <br> literally retarded <br> best anything </br></br>  <br> But he saves people all the time <br>Only when it suits him. He saves people for a reason, not just to be nice. I think the only non-calculated impulse decision he made to save people was the very first time he did it.</br></br>  <br>Even then, that was only because of Sebas.</br>  <br>Even then it was kind of justified because he needed information.</br>  <br>Ah right. Sebas was like "if you won't, I will" so he decided to do it himself. And then ended up turning the situation to his advantage anyway.</br>  <br>a cute retard.</br>  <br>He's also a former human and proper member of society, so while the -500 and being a Lich influences him hella hard, he's very open to sparing anyone if they have even a remote semblance of value to Nazarick.</br>  Threadly reminder that Shalltear is the best girl  <br>No that wasn't the case. Sebas was going to leave them be, but his expression and face reminded Ainz of Touch Me, and nostalgia was what influenced Ainz to take action.<br><br>Sebas wouldn't dare do shit once his master says fuck em.</br></br></br>  <br>Part of that is also him being very shrewd and thinking in the long term. Like the deal with the herbalist lady. He foresaw the need of developing new potions since his existing stock will eventually run out and they might not be able to replace them, so he jumped on the chance to snag an herbalist and put her entirely in his control.</br>  <br> Traitor </br>  <br><br> He sent in 5000 troops to kill hundreds of lizard men so Cyoctus could learn how to think. </br></br>  <br>Haven't read the books but wasn't that magically influenced</br>  Why on earth would Funi not translate "Otoko no ko" into trap? They've never even shown a willingness to leave things in their original language so why now?  <br>Ah, this just reminds me  WN Arche . If only her stupid group member in the LN hadn't angered Ainz.</br>  <br>Maybe they have some new translator who spergs out about MUH ORIGINAL MEANING, MUH CULTURE. The last episode had the whole bitch=slut screw up too.</br>  <br> Not Solution Epsilon. <br>Discarded taste.</br></br>  Alright do y'all nigga enjoy this episode? <br> I do </br>  <br>Look at this faggot, can't appreciate the greatness of Narbel</br>  I'll take the undead over being slowly melted by slime bitch or flayed forever by demiurge. I'll at least be mercifully slain when used as fodder against lizardmen or something.  <br>Really. Looks like the best deal you can get in this story is to be right quick.  Gazef  had it pretty good then.</br>  <br>CUTE<br>U<br>T<br>E</br></br></br></br>  <br>Funi always has that one instance where they make really weird choices.</br>  I want to befriend the maids and stay alive somehow. What do?  <br><br>I don't understand funi, shows more weeb than this get localized more, but in overlord they partially leave honorifics.</br></br>  <br>That's because they are lizardmen, not humans. He still has attachments to his old life as a human.<br><br>That said, those things dry up real fucking quick once he's exposed to the humanity of this new world. While people like the village elder and Enri are favorable in his eyes, the vast majority of shitlords that mess with him take away whatever sliver of consideration he has when it's already negligible to begin with. He could have easily just knocked out Iguva's group and taken only Iguva for a corpse and leave the other innocents out, but just by being in the same group as the faggot they are dead. In contrast he saves the girls at the village when he could have just asked his questions then left them for dead and taken their corpses later. It's not like he was gonna get exposed and objectively there was no merit to saving Enri at that point. It was even written that he felt something for her protecting her sister.</br></br></br>  If I opened up sadpanda how many doujins will I see have momonga shoving up his boner in best girl?  <br>They put effort into being terrible, it's their trademark.</br>  <br><br>Stop being human. <br><br><br><br>None, right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> calls her a traitor <br> was controlled by a world class item <br><br>How long is this shit argument against Shalltear going to go on</br></br></br></br>   Momonga practicing Overload poses in the mirror. <br>What a moe villain.</br>  <br>It's the logic of the industry.<br><br> Weeb shit? LOCALIZE HARD  <br> Western shit/ Well it's already localized enough by being western stuff, so let's be lazy! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Till Shalltear drinks herself into oblivion for going against Ainz-sama.</br>  <br>fuck,any pixiv ones?</br>  <br><br>He even rolls on his beds when he is tired, just to find Albedo's smell all over the place.</br></br>  <br>There's a few naughty pics, mostly of Albedo and one poor Mare.</br>  <br> In contrast he saves the girls at the village when he could have just asked his questions then left them for dead and taken their corpses later. <br>He could have but didn't because Touch Me's giant ass ballsacks were smacking him in the head.</br></br>  <br>Well yes, but  the magic behind it got fucked up due to Shalltear killing the caster at the time it was cast. The end result was that her behavior got reset to that of an MMO mob in that she aggroes on things that attack her. Ainz initiated combat and she was compelled to fight back to the best of her ability even if no one was actually controlling her. <br>Something like that, if memory serves.</br></br>  <br> people thinking he gave Mare and Albedo the teleportation rings just out of the goodness of his heart. <br>Sure but it wasn't the main reason. Has he even done something with no strings attached or no benefits at all?</br></br>  <br><br> Just throwing a bone at you. <br> http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51416884</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br> Caster aint dead. She's critically injured </br>  <br> Has he even done something with no strings attached or no benefits at all? <br>Pat Mare's head.</br></br>  <br>Demiurge will help him figure it out.<br><br>As well, maybe Ainz will have to temporarily take on a more fleshy humanoid form and bone Albedo.<br><br>He did have a few monsters that at least have muscle-mass on their otherwise skeletal frames, so he could possibly give himself some magic muscle and skin and go all out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was under the influence of a world class item<br><br>Fucking get over it<br><br>She wouldn't betray him of her own accord unless her creator came back and for some retarded reason wanted to stand against bones</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> special potion to give momonga a dick <br> special potion to turn momonga into a   generic faceless hentai MC <br> special potion to give momonga a tentacle dicks to impregnate everyone   including cocytus <br>This is not hard</br></br></br></br>    <br>What does pure-virgin succubus pussy juice smell like?</br>  <br>what about a potion that turns him into a grill with a dick?</br>  <br><br>All I can think about it, is how will the child turn out? Will the baby carry the genetic material of the once Human overlord?<br><br>Also I would very much like if Albedo were to have a girl she ends up turning completely different from her mother, as in a calm gentle girl who even likes humans and plays with them.<br><br><br><br>Like flowers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Does Ainz ever find out and take the World Item from her cold, dead corpse? </br>  <br>How does bones smell? He doesn't have a nose.</br>  <br> To busy with Blood Emperor to invade the South yet but he knows they're alive. </br>  <br>He's in an anime</br>  I've had the OP on repeat all day <br><br>Help</br></br>  <br>Why does he even have a bed? You'd think it would be a coffin or something.</br>  KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEIIEEEEEIIIEEEE  <br>It's relaxing for him, but I do think he has a coffin.<br>Anyone remembers where did they put  his skull after the big fight </br></br>  <br>Because Touch Me wanted a bed.</br>  <br>Why?<br><br>He doesn't get tired</br></br></br>  <br>Because shut up</br>  <br>To set his respawn point, silly.</br>   the cute twin is a trap <br>dropped</br>  <br>He doesn't even know they are from the Theocracy.</br>  <br>Maybe due to magic, the child will take after the flesh parent, in this case Albedo, Shaltear, and Aura (someday she'll be the 3rd member), maybe some of the maids as well, but inherit his or her father's higher magic power.<br><br>In fact, I'd guess that the child would always be female, given that the only flesh parents available are female, but the degree of magic they would inherit from Ainz would vary.<br><br>Albedo's child might become an incredible tank (able to use immense magic to boost her own abilities inherited from Albedo).<br><br>Shaltear's child might either become well-balanced or hilariously overpowered (her parents' strengths and few weaknesses, given Shaltear having been proficient in the few things that could actually harm Ainz).<br><br>Aura's child will definitely be a powerful summoner and tamer. Even if her beast pets die, she could resummon them as undead. She'd probably also have the highest magic pool if assuming that Aura's Dark Elf race sticks to RPG convention and has naturally high mana reserves.<br><br>I do wonder if he'd also be permitted or would bother to screw some of the maids and impregnate them as well (the ones that are likely to be able to reproduce, that is. After all, the Guardians themselves said it'd be odd for Ainz to only have one or two wives).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The girlish one is a trap <br> The boyish one is a reverse trap <br>How can you not love this</br></br></br>  <br>I certainly do</br>  <br>Wait the other one actually is a girl? Wow.</br>  <br>Shalltear can tank too</br>  <br> reverse trap <br>You meant tomboy.</br></br>  <br> I do wonder if he'd also be permitted <br> permitted <br><br>Is not like anyone would oppose Ainz. But maybe his future daughters would get jealous of her father being with several woman. <br><br>That's it if he can get his libido back in the forst place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aura is a girl though<br><br>The ugly one, Mare, is the trap silly</br></br></br>  <br>the only reason she can do that is because of spiut Lance, she takes damage way too fast.</br>    Excuse me, best girl coming through<br><br> This picture makes me want to die in a corner because shalltear will never be my true vampire girlfriend and give me undead children and be the best thing ever </br></br>  I want to join them and play with Aura and Mare all day.  <br>But you're a Humie.</br>  <br>You don't play with mare and aura<br><br>Mare and Aura play with you</br></br></br>  <br>That's due to her magic lance though; otherwise, she has limited magic reserves and has the issue of not being able to use most weapons. Her child however, would likely be able to offset that weakness with some level of magic item creation, on top of a larger magic reserve.<br><br>Speaking of, I do wonder if the children would end up being loyal only to Ainz, or Ainz first, or to their mother's and their mother's creators, in the priority list.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure a human from Ainz' world would get an exception</br>  <br>Ainz doesn't let any humies into Naz outside of the one human NPC</br>  <br>Moe as fuck.</br>  <br>Why would the prioritize one parent over the other unless they just started favouring one along the way?</br>  N-Nice face...  <br><br> Implying Ainz's little girls wont be all over his bones. </br></br>  <br>A fake shit</br>  <br>You could be right; there probably would only be maybe 3 heirs (2 for sure).<br><br>I can see it: Albedo's daughter, both best sister and at the same time worst rival to Shaltear's daughter, while Aura's daughter (who's not going to be around for so many more years until Aura matures), is spoiled and treated well by both older sisters (although they might use her to try and say who's the better older sister at times).<br><br>Still it would be funny if Ainz also took a maid or two; because the younger sister didn't want to be lonely in her age bracket.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>[Craziness Intensifies]</br>  <br><br>Man I can see those little runts making uncle Cocytus's life hell.</br></br>  <br>Best expression so far.</br>  why is the framerate of this show so bad?  <br><br>Your GPU is not powerful to render Ainz properly.</br></br>  <br>All he needs is the dick for purely practical purposes. The characters that want to fuck him want to fuck the big skeleton him. They think he's sexy.</br>  Why is Cocytus so best?  <br>He'd probably do the whole maid squad.<br><br><br>It's a bad port.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cocytus will have a hell of a time dealing with both Albedo's and Shaltear's children, while Aura's child is pretty much spoiled by everyone for being younger.</br>  Help a secondary become a primary?

It's always interesting to read what normies think.</br>  <br> Some people seem to think Ainz is going to go good guy and "save the word". <br><br>Poor delusional faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>Tier 7 or Rank 4, not like it matters against Ainz.</br>  <br><br>IGN?</br></br>  <br>the gaming website?</br>  <br>They are called normies because you don't need to read their shit to know what they think.</br>  <br><br>Yes. They gave it a 5/10.</br></br>  <br>I am still pondering <br>manga or read the novel?</br></br>  <br>It's really weird reading people being positive about a new show. So used to the negativity here. <br><br><br>LN then manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>LN, the manga are just complimentary pics to the novel.</br></br>  <br>Both I'd say. The manga skips some stuff but has nice art.</br>  Why is manga considered an okay pasttime hobby in Japan when comics have a "nerd" stigma in America?  <br>Cuz all japs are nerds<br><br>duh</br></br></br>  <br> secondary </br>  <br> Why is manga considered an okay pasttime hobby <br>It's not if you're a grown ass man<br> when comics have a "nerd" stigma in America? <br>Are you ignorant or non-American?</br></br></br></br>    <br> It's not if you're a grown ass man <br>It is.<br>To answer OP's question, it's probably because manga actually grew out of its juvenile beginnings, unlike American comics.</br></br></br>  <br>not really cause comics are more or less mainstream in America now, due to movie and TV adaptations</br>  <br>Same reason dressing 8-year-old boys in drag and fucking in the streets are okay pass time hobbies in the USA, and running children over with trucks is an okay pass time hobby in China. Just the way things are, culture and stuff.</br>  <br>Manga is cheaper and mainstream in Japan.</br>  They're just a mainstream form of media. There's probably some legit explanation about the economy and how cheap manga is or something like that but there's so much variety it wouldn't make sense to be a niche hobby.  Because there are tons of mature and adult manga that has gone popular. While in american comics, the ones which popular are mostly hero stuff that cater children.  Because there are manga about fucking everything, whereas american comics are 99% capeshit and 1% hipsters trying to be taken seriously simply because they aren't capeshit.  <br><br> the ones which popular are mostly hero stuff that cater children. <br><br>No, they cater to a (largely adult) niche fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Comics are strange, they have been hyping blockbuster movies for a while now and making billions, but the original comics are still niche?</br>  <br>Is there a good comic without hero stuff that quite popular?</br>  <br>My understanding is they are trying to turn every superhero into some sort of social justice icon. Who the people are buying these comics I have no idea</br>  <br>Not quite, reading a manga on the train is okay in Japan, while you are made fun of if you read a comic on the bus.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say mainstream. The movies definitely are but the source material is still sorta viewed as something for kids.</br>  <br>It's because you're a retarded dipshit that cares what people think of you</br>  <br>Don't be a sarcastic ass when you don't know what your talking about. Late night anime is teenager and otaku shut in nerd tier in japan, but manga is absolutely mainstream as fuck.</br>  <br> Who the people are buying these comics I have no idea <br>No one is buying them.</br></br>  NEXT G<br>http://g-tekketsu.com/</br>  cool  Hope it will be better than the last few Gundam series.

No question. One that will be remembered as one of the "greats". Easily!</br>  <br> We just had masterpiece(G-Reco) </br>  <br><br>I paint and mod them if necessary so i can make them better.<br>Sadly it has been sold out everywhere for a long time.<br>I just like to cherish the mecha series i like by buying at least a model or two for it and sometimes creating a diorama.</br></br></br></br>  <br>More like your brain capabilities is shit.<br>Even the second most important newspaper in Japs agreed that G-Reco is masterpiece.</br></br>  <br> hurr, only retards didn't like g-reco <br/></br>  <br> I am speaking using my round asshole. <br>You are already proven wrong because there are guys on /m/ and /a/ who watched G-Reco with their nephew / child and the result is that they can follow and understand the story better than the likes of you brain deficiencies subhuman.

Only retards liked it.</br></br>  <br>When I think about gundam recoguista in g I immediately think of what I love about hilariously bad anime. Its all there, at about episode 12 or so 30 characters get introduced and really none of them have any impact at all on the story ever. Lots of exposition starts here to nearly every other episode.<br><br>But you can tell that a lot of thought went into the characters and the detail of the mobile suits and the little things the characters do when their in space or on the ground. The story execution is bad but its still very watchable and not really boring.<br><br>Once you get past the mind numbing middle of the season when shit actually starts to happen it was fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>G-Reco wasn't confusing. It was boring and asinine.</br>  <br> next g <br>Hype.</br></br>  <br>call me?</br>  <br>You already had your G show</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Why are Recofags a bunch of liars?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A kuntala indeed.</br></br>  cool guy  <br>I'm still mad at how much of a shit they made him in season 2.</br>  <br>Having Domon actually show up at the end of Try was unexpected. I thought they were going to end up skirting around who Sekai's master was, regardless of the figure in the OP.</br>  <br>It was for G's anniversary, it had been exactly 20 years since G's final episode when that episode aired.</br>  god hoping it wouldn't be like Age and Rec. Terribad  best Heroine is gundom w<br><br>Some objection　？</br></br>  Who do you want to write this, pick one:<br> Urobuchi <br> Guilty Crown dude <br> Mari Okada </br></br></br>  <br>Hajime Yatate</br>  <br>Yamada</br>  <br>Are these like the only writers /a/ knows about</br>  <br>They're the ones that had rumors about being the next G writer. I think the one about Okada was a troll though.</br>  Just make more built fighter plz, better then most "serious gendem" they came up with for the pass 15 year.  <br>They already blew it with Try, better give it a rest</br>  <br>Try blew it<br><br>Also fuck you falseflagger</br></br></br>  <br>Okada. Maximum suffering.<br> I wish I had the picture of Okada at the press event where she was asked about Wixoss and she said it was a very tragic/suffering story and then laughs </br></br>  <br>Its probably just a troll.<br><br>I mean hell even Tomino has gone down on record stating that it was a disaster. I did like how it felt rather old school though in its cinematography though. When I sat down to watch the first episode I wasn't expecting that at all.</br></br></br>    <br>Oh hey, found it.</br>  <br> Tomino has gone down on record stating that it was a disaster. <br>He has said that about practically every damn Gundam he made, even the ones that actually money for Bandai.</br></br>  <br>Citation needed.</br>  <br> I mean hell even Tomino has gone down on record stating that it was a disaster <br>Are you new to Tomino? Everything is a disaster to him.</br></br>  <br>The only one who is rumored is yoshino as in the guilty crown dude</br>  <br>they made him cool again in the movie but everyone knows it's too late. it's always too late.</br>  <br> he doesn't know about the infamous 'please don't buy this anime' said by Tomino himself and having it printed on the dics themselves <br> he hasn't read all the interviews about Tomino saying his own works are terrible </br></br>  Have I ruined Gundam for myself by watching Turn A first?  <br> http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/in<wbr>terest/2015-04-24/yoshiyuki-tomino-<wbr>admits-story-problems-in-gundam-rec<wbr>onguista/.87449</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  Why is its torso so empty like that? I like my gendums bulky, not skellingtons.  <br>It looks like it is being put together and not complete.</br>  <br>in one of the Victory gundam CD cover, "don't buy this anime video" -Tomino Yoshiyuki is printed</br>  <br>Admitting it's not flawless work seems kinda tame how he has treated V Gundam. And that still got BD release.<br> I want to completely reject this work. These kind of results are the full responsibility of the director. If you should by some mistake watch this Blu-ray, try looking for what’s bad in ‘Mobile Suit V Gundam’. If even one person notices, then I believe that there will have been meaning in releasing this Blu-ray. </br></br>  <br> fat lady <br>Please don't bully her</br></br>  <br>Mari Okada and Nagai confirmed. Will best Gundam so far.</br>  <br>No, it can only go up from there.</br>  <br>nice bait</br>  <br>You've already seen the best the franchise has to offer.</br>  <br>Except ZZ.</br>  <br>M3 was made out of Okada-brand suffering, Jesus Christ.<br>"You want ress suffeling? Fuk yu! Have mole!"</br></br>  <br>Isn't Yoshino too busy to write for Gundam though?<br>Okada is garbage and we've had Destiny already. <br><br>I'm sure it won't be butcher though since Makoto Ishiwata tweeted yesterday:<br><br> 新ガンダム、色々ギミックが隠してありそうで楽しみ。全身を早く見てみた<wbr>い。</wbr> <br>This new Gundam seems to be hiding a lot of fun gimmicks. I can't wait to see the whole body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only masterpiece was 00 Gundam Season 1.</br>  <br> female pilot as the MC <br> Gundam <br><br>laughingproducers.webm</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're more likely to get a gay MC.</br>  <br>Oh boy backpacks, 2 pilot system, waist split into two gundams confirmed, amazing gimmicks, so much fun!</br>  Please no Tomino anymore.  <br>We already had Gundam Wing.</br>  <br>  Dissing Gundam Bawoo <br>Fuck you</br></br>  <br>Well it is an AU, they need to differentiate from UC while still keeping the image of Gundam.</br>  G gundam was boring as hell I dropped it on 3 episodes<br><br> Tournament Gundam <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Will it have a female pilot as the MC? <br><br>Pray hard</br></br></br>  Gundam Gegongisga confirmed.  <br>Bandai reportedly tried and made a prototype of mg kshatriya. The wing binders were apparently so heavy it needed diecast parts for support and that combined with the overall size and bulk put the design at pg level estimated price which they didn't feel was worth the risk.</br>  who is directing? If it's Fukuda, I will watch  <br>OVAs are on the way and please no new series for at least a year. Rushed production is what killed Try.</br>  wating for age 2 season  <br><br>To be honest that'd be cool.</br></br>  <br> Implying they will ever actually acknowledge AGE was a thing ever again. <br><br>AGE is the new G Savior.</br></br></br>  <br>look at soccer a boy</br>  http://bandai-hobby.net/GBWC/japan/<wbr>history2014.html<br><br>very cool</br></br></wbr>  Mech looks like absolute shit. I'm glad it isn't Urobuchi after all.  <br>Here's the most of the US entries so far this year. <br><br>http://www.bluefincorp.com/catalog/<wbr>gbwc2015-winners#</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Next 00<br>HYPE</br></br>  Why do they keep making new Gundam series when they already made the best possible one?  <br>For the same reason they kept making new mobile suit designs and factions when they already reached perfection with the OZ MS. They want to taste that perfection again.</br>  <br>It's not though. MSG is still the best. And that was ages ago. We need something new.</br>  <br> implying UC is the poster child for good anime. </br>  <br>We already had Gundam SEED.</br>  <br> We need something new. <br>That was what G-Reco was for and everyone hated it. This will most like be yet another UC (specifically OYW) knockoff.</br></br>  <br>We get it, you hate us, /m/. So why are you here? Are you a retard who enjoys hanging out with people you hate? Fuck off to your irrelevant containment board.</br>  <br> The only one who is rumored is yoshino as in the guilty crown dude <br><br>It's not too bad</br></br></br>  I want competent adult pilots as main characttresr, and KIDS SHUT FUCK UP YOU ARE NOT SPACE JESUSES!  <br>Looks edgy. Hopefully they'll have a core block to cover up that middle</br>  <br><br>Yeah I still don't understand what people have against Try. It wasn't as well rounded as the first Build Fighters and had to split it's animation budget a bit with G-Reco clearly but it was still a ton of good fun and gave us some amusing characters as well like Gyanko, Shia, Sakai, Suga and Yomi (who are sure to be engaged in a hatesex relationship) and the two ever hammy Kawaguchis.</br></br>  <br>Ark Performance</br>  <br><br>Speaking as a Gundam fan of about 20 years now the only Gundam works I haven't really enjoyed were Seed Destiny with all the omni-pandering and distractions after the first quarter (obviously it worked on baiting otaku since it's still and probably always will be the highest grossing TV anime series ever since you're unlikely to ever see a 50 episode series again let alone one that does numbers like it did), the last act of AGE where the story and Kio's character motivations kind of fell apart and didn't really make sense and really that's about it. You talk to some other Gundam fans these days though and it's like they've never enjoyed any of it. I'm pretty sure people will be burying G-Tekketsu whatever it is before long, possibly as early as tomorrow when it's actually unveiled and we probably get our first key art which is usually when the angry Gundam cycle starts and people start picking it apart before it even airs it's first trailer.</br></br>  what time is it now japan  <br>2:42 AM I believe.</br>  <br> implying Mai-HiME/Otome is going to become the female Gundam franchise <br><br> Mai Tokiha will still become the main character </br></br></br>  <br> sequel to Gundam Wing <br> all the female love interests are conveniently gone </br></br>  <br>Not going to happen (unless it's a Movie or OVA). Gundam TV series have always targeted kids/teenagers first and foremost because they're the ones Bandai wants to buy (or nag their parents to buy) the model kits.<br><br>Open your eyes: the franchise can't survive off fat otaku NEETS forever.</br></br></br>  <br>All of the 00 pilots sans Setsuna were adults, all of them were in the 2nd season.</br>  <br>Okada when?</br>  Sunrise has a bunch of cool robot shows from the 80s. I'd wish they'd revisit those series instead of making another Gundam... AGAIN.<br><br>Every new Gundam series they make diminish the impact and importance of every single one of them.</br></br>  <br>People tend to severely exaggerate how they really feel about something here</br>  <br>dead franchise is dead</br>  <br> Sunrise has a bunch of cool robot shows from the 80s <br>So you'd rather they diminish the impact and importance of those instead</br></br>  <br><br>We already had Gundam 00</br></br>  <br>wait a minute,that's going to become the franchise for female Gundams</br>  <br>He's not gay, he's robosexual</br>  <br>Sunrise has always been keeping dead franchises in limbo to fuck with the fans. <br><br>What's your point really?</br></br></br>  <br>Look at those legs, Exia is a girl.</br>  <br>Mai-anything will never happen again, period.</br>  <br>Was G-Reco any good? I backlogged it after episode 4.</br>  <br><br> SEED <br> the one protagonist who canonically had sex onscreen with a female character <br> gay </br></br></br></br>  <br>It's alright. Pacing is a mess at times, due to the fact it has only 25 episodes to get its point across. It's a blink, and you'll miss it, kind of series.</br>  <br> implying he wasn't thinking of Athrun the whole time </br>  <br>OK I'll give it another shot. By the looks of things though it seems even Tomino was disappointed with it though.</br>  <br><br>Is their an amplifier rule if its Gundam Kyoani or Type Moon?</br></br>  <br> Mai-anything will never happen again, period <br>Keep believing that,kapeesh</br></br>  <br>This is why mechas should stop pandering to fujos. You can pander to hetfags instead and fujos will just ignore it. All they need is a couple of bishounen and they'll buy it.</br>  Things im looking forward to here Lulz wise :<br><br>-Pictures of the cast doing that stupid hand out pose they always have them doing thats in the Turn A OP.<br>- How many Muse voice actresses they'll manage to cram into the show. Yoshino Nanjo might as well be a lock. Emi Nitta is likely too.<br><br>Seriously though looking forward to more Gundam .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pictures of the cast doing that stupid hand out pose <br><br>I don't think Tomino is working on this.</br></br></br>  <br> Ark Performance writing a Gundam <br>It already exists and it has Yazan in it. Fucking Yazan Gable.<br><br>The girls in it are extremely like the ones in Arpeggio  would you trust Yazan with them? </br></br></br></br>  <br> ANN <br> source is from yaraon  <br><br>And they atill managed to botch his words.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I need to read this solely for Ingrid 0.<br><br>Yazan too.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean UC gundams are still being targeted at little kids?</br>  <br>It has excellent art, OST (as expected from any Gundam series), and mechanical designs. The characters were pretty good too. The plot gets a little fucky, watching one episode after the other in comparison to weekly when it was airing would probably help with that. Here's a chart if you get confused, it's pretty funny these were made. It isn't a show you can just watched passively while jerking off or gaming, it requires full attention. <br>I liked it a lot except I felt the ending was too rushed, and the story would of have benefited exponentially if it was 50 episodes of course.</br></br>  <br>I don't recommend it, the narrative/dialogue bends over backwards and jumps around in an attempt to deliberately confuse the viewer as to what's going on and what do the characters want, but when it does answer most (not all) of the questions you have, you realize the plot is very bland, uninteresting, and offers almost no payoff, and the characters are just regular archetypes.</br>  <br>To be fair, i'd totally go gay for Exia<br>That thing is the embodiment of perfection</br></br>  <br> &gt;Sports Gundam and this is the football model <br>Fund it</br></br>  <br> G-Reco <br> masterpiece <br>I enjoyed the hell out of it, but it's far from a masterpiece.<br><br> forgetting that AGE exists </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All first character design key visuals for the last few Gundam series have had them doing that pose</br></br>  <br>How about none of those</br>  <br> implying Mai-HiME/Otome is going to become the female Gundam franchise <br><br>I can agree with this</br></br></br>  <br><br>Best lead Gundam design since Exia.<br><br>Don't fuck it up by lazily announcing a second season a year later and ruin the design work, Sunrise/Bandai.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They need new IP's to push with LoveLive and Gundam making impact.I'm sure Mai Hime and older IP's can make some ground.Gundam still remains the best IP's out there for Sunrise and Bamco.</br>  So what's the consensus on Unicorn?<br><br>I just watched the first 2 episodes and I thought it was pretty good for a gundam series. <br><br>Did you guys like it or hate it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zeon fanwank with a mess of an ending but dat fucking animation and OST holy shit<br>Overall i'd say "sure, go for it"</br></br>  <br><br>the animations are 10/10, and I'm a zeon-fanboy so I'm fine with fanwank. The music is amazing too, i got goose-bumps at the end of the first episode<br><br>what about the ending is a mess? was it just written badly, or did it not make sense?</br></br></br></br>  I can't wait for more hot G ladies  <br>Both.<br>The laplace's box reveal was pretty eh and  FF dies from bad tripping too hard .<br>It had some great moments like the fights and Bright being based yet again.</br></br></br>  <br>I trust you guys to keep this thread up until 11:00 PM EST, when the broadcast starts.</br>  <br>Awesome for mecha porn, ehh everything else. Also the Unicorn is too invincible , I don't think it even got its paint scratched during the entire series.</br>  <br>Well, it got a crystal treatment instead.</br>  So if we dont focus on the mecha part of gundam, which gundam has the best story/characters/development?  <br>Turn-A.</br>  <br>Dianna is better</br>  <br>Zeta.<br><br>Fight me</br></br></br>  <br>He is but take anything he says with a grain of salt, he hates everything, its just this time he was fairly right about alot of the flaws with G-reco but again with him hating EVERYTHING it loses impact. I hate it and so do alot of others but you might as well watch it and see for yourself if you get a unpopular opinion, just dont be a dick about it if you do and youll be cool, the gundam fandom is kind of hostile so any diplomatic fans we get is appreciated. hopefully you enjoy it more than I</br>  <br>The story is fucking awful.<br><br>Watch it for the elder god tier OST and fight scenes.</br></br></br>  Reconquista had its moments.  <br>didn't Athrun also fuck Meer<br><br>or am I remembering wrong</br></br></br>    <br>Exia and Qant are sexy, fuck off</br>  <br><br>I had been looking for this for months.<br>Thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>Great reaction material no doubt.</br>  <br>Qan[T] was too lewd.</br>  <br> that design <br>Too edgy for me</br></br>  <br> some dumb bitch with 6 minutes of screentime dies  <br><br>g-reco was terrible at handling its large cast</br></br></br>  <br>Qan[T] strips only to understand you better.<br>Best waifu.</br></br>    <br>Stupid sexy Qan[t].

The only Gundam anime he actually hates is Victory and he talks shit about all his works even the ones that are universally acclaimed.</br></br>  <br>I never thought of it that way.</br>  <br>Just remake parts 2 and 3 so Flint is the MC and he doesn't revert back to a beta bitch.</br>  <br> unpopular opinion, <br>Hard not to be a dick about something when the detractors constantly post bullshit.</br></br>  <br>Compare her total screentime to raraiya's or noredo's and it feels like even less.</br>  <br>What's with the V-Fin</br>  Reminder that the website was coded by a retard and the timer assumes that you're on JST.

You can stop trying so hard now.</br>  <br>Shitpost all you want it's not gonna make her any more interesting or fleshed out. 60% of her screentime was "muh rockpie!", then she went nuts and died. And this is supposed to be the second-most important leading face of one the key factions.</br>  <br><br> "The story is fucking awful" <br><br>in what ways? Seems like the same old political drama as always.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh its this retard again. Nevermind.</br>  <br>Bait.</br>  <br> Gundam remains incomplete until it's destroyed in the final episode <br>That would be neat.</br></br>  <br>You watch it for the OST and banana-kun crying about how he doesn't want to kill people as he kills people</br>  sawano sound and aimer<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Swl<wbr>8Q57t8YA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Have the Japanese ever coded a good website? As a website developer, I am usually appalled when checking the source on a nip site.</br>  <br>I was surprised that none of the fuckers from the G-Institute or Mask's crew died at the end. The way they kept coming after Bellri did not demonstrate a survival instinct.</br>  <br>Jokes on you faglord. I'm on JST because I play Kancolle.</br>  <br> crying about how he doesn't want to kill people as he kills people <br><br>I really hate when people say this kinda shit about characters in gundam. <br><br>Just because you're forced to kill people doesn't mean you want to do it. Murder is wrong, anon. It's not like he's killing beast-men from the depths of hell, he's killing people with ideals and agendas and lives to go back home to. <br><br>If you think crying about killing someone makes you a pussy, then I want you to go next door right now and murder everyone brutally, you're not a pussy, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope it's the Geass director but not the Geass writer. Taniguchi is good.  <br>Or he could not get in the fucking robot that only he can pilot and leave the whole box thing alone.</br>  <br> I really hate when people say this kinda shit about characters in gundam. <br>The only characters who had qualms about killing people were Kira, Banagher and Loran (the latter didn't break down crying about taking lives he just did it when he had no choice) every other protagonists had no problem with it.</br></br>  <br>The anime fucked up that episode. In the novels Banagher actually took the shot and Loni wasn't a psychopath.</br>  <br> go next door right now and murder everyone brutally, <br>It'd be more like enlisting in the military and refusing to kill someone when they're shooting at you.</br></br>  sawano ost is good <br>killlakill ,Attack on Titan</br>  <br> Attack on Titan <br>Ya blew it</br></br>  Recall　gundom x,v<br>Black history？</br>  <br>X was great</br>  <br>Is that shadow the hedgehog?</br>  　＼Π／<br> ・_▼_・<br>∥ 〓 ∥<br>　　▲<br><br> 　　　　Mk-II<br><br>http://www.geocities.co.jp/Playtown<wbr>-Denei/2111/gface.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no <br>Kill la Kill<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M93<wbr>xdABB2dw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>amuro and kamille had qualms about killing people.</br>  <br><br>Wait what, we're getting the lowdown at midnight EST then?

Especially when many of them ended with the characters relying on Sekai to bring out the ass whooping. The strategies throughout Try were also extremely unorthodox but not in a positive way, which is lame because they had 3 gunpla that could have been used effectively.<br><br>Too many characters, too little focus due to that format.

Any of the girls could end up getting rejected. If we take Yukino, Yui, and Iroha all as possibilities then for sure two girls are going to get rejected at a minimum.
