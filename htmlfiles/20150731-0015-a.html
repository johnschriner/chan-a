[ Dangerously close enough.     yfw you realize Kaido is Oda's way of making fun of people telling him to kill himself because they don't like his manga   <br><br>Fanart by etc. etc</br></br>  <br>So if weapons break on Big K then Moria might've tried to go for a cheap win by cutting big Ks shadow off only to have his scissors snap apart and slice himself up.</br>  Glad I didn't read the spoilers, this was a great wake-up this morning.  Holy shit, is this real? My dick is harder than stone. This is way better than anything I imagined.  <br>too much boobs</br>  Great chapter. Why is ther no talking about it here?  <br>There was already a huge thread when the issue came out hours ago. This is the late comer after party where everyone is asleep/at work.</br>   reveal Kaido <br> he wants to make a greatest war in a world <br><br>If that aint hype I dont know what is.<br>Also funny how Apoo and Basil are scared but Kidd only seems angry.</br></br></br></br>  So Kaido is a shitter who has only gotten to where he is by being a lucker dog.<br><br>DISGUSTING.</br></br>  So, I don't get it. Does he WANT to kill himself? Or does he just do it for fun because he knows he will live?  So… apparently the rest of the crew managed to escape, and the 3 eyed girl went with them??? Are they fighting Kaidos crew in Zou?<br><br>Why is Kaido going after the Kidd Alliance? Did Urouge become his ally?<br><br>Holy shit I have a lot of questions.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why is Kaido going after the Kidd Alliance? <br>He doesn't. He just happened to fall next to them. Urouge just happened to meet him.</br></br>  <br> too much boobs </br>  So does this mean Kaido, the king of beasts, doesn't have a devil fruit?<br><br>Because jumping from there would be pretty stupid if he ended up falling in the water.</br></br>  <br>He was trying to commit suicide.</br>  So, since the guy who attacked Brook and Nami is a sheep man, it's probably save to say they are Kaido's men. (Plus there was an elephant, but an elephant fruit is alread in use.) Why are they searching for Kinemon? (Assuming that Kinemon is the samurai they talked about, who they assumed would be with the strawhats.)<br><br><br>He probably just jumped when he saw land. Or he tried to kill himself but was just "lucky".<br><br>Quick, what animals are said to be immortal/have multiple lifes?<br><br>Cats, obviously. Or snakes. But Kaido does not look really cat'ish to me. And snake zoans are already in use.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nemean lion</br>  Do you think Kaido goes on /fit/? I mean look at him.  <br>Stop posting this, the top one looks nothing like him aside from maybe hair, and the only similarities with the bottom is they have a left arm tattoo.</br>  <br> the only similarities with the bottom is they have a left arm tattoo <br>Are you implying that's not enough?</br></br>  <br>Yes, the tattoos don't even look similar. The Rock seems to have a tribal tattoo where Kaido seems to have a japanese tattoo.</br>  There has to be a reason for all of the yonkou to not go straight for the One Piece.<br><br>Shanks knows what it is, I guess, and doesn't want it.<br>Whitebeard knows it exists, but his goal in life was to have a family, not treasure.<br>Kaido just wants to an hero apparently?<br>Big Mom is only in it for the sweets.<br>And Blackbeard is still busy building his territory.<br><br>Come to think of it, the "One Piece" is getting less and less important the closer we get to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun.

So she apparently kept working even after that.</br>  <br>Nah he's too much of workaholic to retire.</br>  So... I guess the true reason for the Uchiha massacre was never made public.<br><br>Oh, and who is Shizune I guess.</br></br>  <br>Shizune was a subordinate, not a pupil.</br>  All these people arguing about when Kishimoto's retiring.<br><br>Nobody seems to have actually noticed he only drew 4 pages</br></br>  <br> niggastream </br>  <br> only student the fifth hokage ever accepted </br>  <br> Sakura <br> elite by birth <br><br>What the fuck?

I like how he's the anti thesis of edgy bishounen.  <br>Meh, sort of. She naturally had perfect chakra control, which is the key to Tsunade's super strength. And Tsunade even commented that she was learning techniques as fast or faster than Shizune.</br>  <br> seductive 4 <br> 1010 <br> no temari <br>What are you doing, Boruto?</br></br></br></br>  <br>sakura looks... off, this looks like fanart, also elite from birth?</br>  <br> Kishi shits on his former hardwork team to make Sakura the long lost heir of some deceased clan adopted by the Harunos </br>  <br>Stop making it sound like you care about Sakura.</br>  <br>I don't know why he keeps releasing this crap, is not like is putting any effort in the art, it looks as bland as everything post time skip looks.</br>  <br>That doesn't make her elite by birth.</br>  <br>We need raws, no idea how accurate these translations are</br>    <br>I care for more R34 of her adult form.</br>  <br>I don't. I just hate Kishi shitting on his themes.</br>  <br>Hah, Boruto has a hilarious tough guy face.</br>  <br> Way to shit on your previous moral lessons about not being tied to birth and hardwork <br>At least he's not lying this time. Genetics are everything in this series.</br></br>  <br><br>She was born very smart and very studious, I guess? <br><br>I guess we know where Kishi falls on Nature vs. Nurture, huh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have stopped caring a long time ago about that stuff.</br>  <br>inb4 someone posts this to stop narutofags to talk about the manga. <br><br>I'm curious about mitsuki though. He seems to be the only one not born from the main cast of characters.</br></br></br>   Hinata <br> shaken the world with her powers <br><br>My sides. Maybe in the kitchen?</br></br></br>  <br>it sure hurt looking at that angle.<br><br>it's like 270 degrees</br></br></br>  <br>Being studious isn't something you're naturally born as.</br>  <br><br>How butthurt was he when no one gave a fuck about Mario?</br></br>  <br>This was written by the assistant btw.</br>  So Konoha is pretty much a nepotistic ninja village?<br><br>Damn Kumogakure looks even better then them stats wise.</br></br>  <br>He's Orochimaru's son.</br>  <br> He seems to be the only one not born from the main cast of characters <br>His mom/dad is Orochimaru. Aside from that, he's a pretty cool kid. <br><br><br>She did help stop mooncuck from killing everyone with giant flaming rocks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Narutard.</br>  <br> seductive 4 <br> not hinata <br>I thought the Japanese approved of incest?</br></br></br>  <br> Hinata is a Jounin <br> we still don't know whether Naruto was ever promoted past Genin before being made Hokage <br> this opens up the possibilities for some delicious rank difference fraternisation <br>Much as I'd prefer some sense in the show and have the most powerful entity on the planet not hold the same rank as a greenhorn, I do like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was a oneshot and he was still working on Naruto. I doubt he had time to care.</br>  <br><br>Everyone helped. But she was useless most of the times, tripping over rocks.</br></br>  <br>With Neji dead, she's probably the strongest in the Hyuuga Clan, outside of her father.</br>  <br><br>The whole Uzumaki family tripped</br></br>  <br>He is not gonna put his own mother for other people to show<br> he has it reserved for shitty old man </br></br>  Orochimaru is fucking BASED. Look at those losers partner of his who didn't have their kids with the Team 7 spawns.  <br>She helped Ino during the war from getting everyone at the frontlines from getting wiped out and stopped Naruto from giving up.</br>  <br>Holy shit a thread were nothing was being discuss just ended a few minutes ago and now out of nowhere is a fucking <br>One-Shot... Great</br></br>   orochimaru kid <br><br>You all realize he looks like the moon faggot right?</br></br>  <br><br>Jesus, what a far cry this is from what the original manga stood for.<br>All of those children and their professor are "elite by birth" with very famous parents.<br>I liked it more when Naruto was about a random nobody war orphan who just wanted to make it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> seductive 4 <br> that Sakura <br>Looks like Burrito's a Wataru fan.</br></br></br>  <br> is your father Monkey D. <br> no <br>Boruto and Mitsuki confirmed for OPfags</br></br></br>  <br><br>He looks more like Kabuto</br></br>  Why would this team even exist? Team 7 was put together because Naruto had the worst grades, whereas Sasuke had the best and Sakura was somewhere in the middle. Team Konohamaru, however, is filled with nothing but monsters.  <br> So Konoha is pretty much a nepotistic ninja village? <br>Are you familiar with the idea of feudalism?</br></br>   not guessing Oro was his dad/mom before the spoilers   <br> Team Konohamaru, however, is filled with nothing but monsters <br>Blame nardo. He's the one who put them together. Probably after realizing that 2/3rds of his own team were secretly the reincarnations of ninja gods.</br></br>  <br><br>Has this been confirmed? <br><br><br>nah</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's confirmed, that best waifu Orochimaru is his  mother <br><br>Some people (me included) used to joke about Mitsuki being Orochimaru's and Kabuto's lovechild, looks like we were not wrong</br></br></br>  <br>It was spoiled already by the moon movie goers. <br><br>Orochimaru is his father or mother. Maybe Toneri moved on and fucked a beautiful Snake Princess.</br></br></br>  <br> The princess of the Hyuuga family <br>This makes me feel warm inside for some reason.</br></br>  <br>note to retards the "she's elite by birth" line is about their daughter, not sakura.</br>   Mitsuki as MC <br> Salad as tsukkomi  <br> Burrito playing it like a slightly more serious nardo <br>This is fucking great. I want a whole manga based around this.</br></br></br>  <br>2nd reply was meant to </br>  <br>The theme seems to be they are pressured by their parents' shadows. Boruto doesn't want to be Hokage, he wants to be The Sasuke. Sarada wants to be Hokage. Mitsuki is fucking Orochimaru's son.</br>  Konohamaru likes da brown chocolate  <br> Konohamaru's parents were ANBU <br><br>it sure would have been nice if kishi touched on this during the main story.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, the father is  Kabuto </br>  <br>To be fair, that's probably just what Kakashi told his students to motivate Naruto, it was most likely bullshit since Naruto and Sakura's potential way outclasses the other teams who never made it to the chuuni exams.<br><br>InoShikaCho were chosen by family compatibility, as was Hinata and her team as sensor ninjas. Team 7 was definitely meant to be a monster team.</br></br></br>   the four <br> Sakura referred as Beauty <br><br>I guess she's supposed to be super hot in Konoha? How wasn't Sasuke cucked in those 12 years?</br></br></br>  <br>1010 is a weaponfag, also temari is missing</br>  <br> Mitsuki is fucking Orochimaru's son <br>Yet he's a much more upbeat character. <br><br>Also, I'm liking the idea of everyone constantly telling Burrito he's going to be Hokage and him telling them to fuck off in retaliation. <br><br><br>This was great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nepotism.</br>  <br>She only gets wet for the Sauce.</br>  <br>it was just a kid doing narration</br>  <br>Yes, it has been confirmed. <br><br><br>Also Oro has stretching powers. <br><br>We don't know if Oro is his mom or his dad and taking into account Orochimaru has been female too and the kid looks like Kabuto...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto and Sakura's potential <br> Sakura's <br><br><br> also temari is missing <br>I guess assistant-kun just doesn't like sandniggers.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in the bedroom obviously</br>  <br>Sakura was popular  pretty according to konoha citicens during academy and also post war</br>  <br><br>Because she'll never cheat on Sauce. Unless Ino becomes a giant futa.</br></br>  <br>That's in a special edition of Springtime of DARKNESS.</br>  You guys do realize it was Mitsuki doing the narration right?  <br>If that movie with Bitchnata in it wasn't sharringans making up bullshit then her dad would be stronk as fuck if he wasn't a lazy shit.</br>  is this official? because the bolt oneshot had him peeing on sasuke  <br>If it took as long to load for them as it did for me, then no.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't be Sakura be popular? Regardless of what her character could appear to the readers, she saved a lot of lives as ninja and as medic, she continued to save lives and took care of orphaned children after the war. She's pretty, devoted and smart.<br><br>But she has a terrible case of shit taste.</br></br></br>   Could your dad be Monkey D.. <br><br>Boruto pls.</br></br>  <br> Hinata <br> Elite <br>I like her bit that's just bullshit.<br>The entire chapter is clearly ninja propaganda that can't be trusted.</br></br></br></br>  <br> is this official? because the bolt oneshot had him peeing on sasuke <br><br>He said monkey d...so no it's a joke and not canon. <br><br>I thought it was official until it turned into shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares? It's Mitsuki speaking and Sakura's been part of the gags for years as "pretty yet bitchy girl who has horrible things happen to her".</br>  He stretches making his body looks like a snake.<br><br>He's Orochimaru's son.</br></br>  <br>Sakura has a lot of potential, she's just not a reincarnation of a ninja god. But as far as medic nin go, she fucking massaged a heart with her bare hands.<br><br>You keep shitting on the people who keep the other ones alive.</br></br></br>  Springtime of Eugenics when?  <br>Officially this is what she's considered, outside of these threads with "Ugh, lame. Stupid side character doesn't count, Juuken is the weakest shit".<br><br>Officially Hyuuga is the strongest clan in the leaf as well, but the thread reacts quickly against it when reminded.<br><br>Just because something isn't accepted by all, doesn't mean officially it isn't right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Officially Hyuuga is the strongest clan in the leaf as well <br><br>This chapter says those were the Uchiha before they were wiped out.</br></br></br>  t was nice but not what i expected<br>The assistant got Boruto's and Sarada's personalities all wrong<br>Boruto would never use the Sexy no jutsu. And Sarada doesn't act like Tsunade getting mad at everything <br>But oh well is just a parody</br></br></br>  <br>Does some have the hyuuga strongest Clan manga edit parodies from Japan saved?</br>  <br><br>It was written by his assistant. Everything here is NOT canon.</br></br>  Mitsuki is the best. I hope he never goes dark edgy.  <br>They are best friends?</br>  <br>Mitsuki is accurate.</br>  <br>It is pretty hard for dead people to compete in a race.</br>  <br>That's the code for they are fucking anon.</br>  <br>YOU ARE MY FRIEND<br>AHH</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's referring to her Talk no Jutsu during the war on Naruto? Everyone was listening, maybe it was a metaphorical shaking of the world?<br><br>But yeah calling her a Jounin by birth is laughable considering she was basically cast out by her family for being a crappy ninja.</br></br></br>  <br> Boruto would never use the Sexy no jutsu <br>Says you.</br></br>  Why do bois like hinata while gurls prefer sakura?  <br>ANO HI NO YUME</br>  <br> Mitsuki is accurate <br> Thinks Bolt will be Hokage. <br>That alone and the fact this is written by the assistant should have tipped you off.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't she a commander in the war, with a lot of troops under her? Don't underestimate Hinata. She's only ever lost to monsters like<br><br>-nedgy<br>-pain<br>-netori</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thinks Bolt will be Hokage. <br>But he does. It's in the novel adaptation as well, which is included in the movie. <br><br>Mitsuki can't read the atmosphere very well. He's like Sai in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does not seem like he uses it in the movie.<br>Also<br> Salad acting like her mom. </br></br></br>  <br> Why wouldn't be Sakura be popular? Regardless of what her character could appear to the readers, she saved a lot of lives as ninja and as medic, she continued to save lives and took care of orphaned children after the war.  <br>Not popular nor important enough for the village to provide her with a house free of mortgage payments</br></br>  <br>Boruto technically has the skills and Talent of a future hokage and pretty much the general populace expect him to become one</br>  <br> Salad acting like her mom <br>But she does. She's just not a bitch.<br><br>Jesus, anon. Get the stick out of your ass. It's not 100% accurate, but it's meant to be played for laughs.<br><br>I'm sure if it gets adapted into a full manga the author will get a better feel for their personalities.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That alone and the fact this is written by the assistant should have tipped you off. <br><br>That's literally something that happens in the novel with the panda as well.<br><br>He tends to say often "Hoh, you're certainly your father's son, the next in line to become Hokage" which gets at Bort. Mizuki is said to be that type who doesn't get subtleties and just says things.<br><br>That's not "This is proof its noncanon shit and wrong", that's "This is just like the official story where he also says it".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought he was just trolling honestly.</br></br>  <br>As true as that might be the clan was considering exterminating her because she was that weak until around the timeskip. <br>Do not misunderstand me. Hinata was never born an elite ninja as is outright stated in that page. She worked her ass off and her Byakugan is weak compared to others.</br></br>  <br>Kishimoto clearly drew the first couple pages, though. I think we can safely accept them as canon.</br>  <br> Hyakugan </br>  <br> Not popular nor important enough for the village to provide her with a house free of mortgage payments <br>Pic related makes it look like she's still living in that shitty apartment we saw at the end of Gaiden.</br></br>  <br>-a rock</br>  The assistant even do the art in the first two pages thats why it all looks a bit off   Sakura <br> elite by birth <br>This guy should stop the drugs.</br></br>  <br> The assistant even do the art in the first two pages thats why it all looks a bit off <br>Really? I thought that was Kishi but he just rushed it.<br><br>He's not bad at emulating his style. If the series gets a new writer he could draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It really explains why he spent his childhood annoying his grandad instead of his parents.</br>  <br>Konoha is like ninja-/a/ with shot taste<br>After their waifu sakura married sauce and became pregnant, they exploded in rage</br></br>  <br>I don't think he did just look at Mitsuki or the first page</br>  <br>Read it again, shithead. He's talking about Salad. That's why it's a separate from the paragraph.</br>  Salad's gotten pretty bitchy since the end of Gaiden. Oh well. At least she's got talent unlike her shitty mother.  <br>I thought so.</br>  <br>Her Byakugan is about the same as others, but she wasn't naturally gifted from birth. Her eyes can still see the same things other eyes can and with training she was finally able to make something of herself. She wasn't gifted from birth but her eyes aren't naturally weak, as shown further with the way she was able to eventually become something with training.<br><br>Then the movie happened and she got a slight upgrade as Byakugan Princess, who has some Hameru chakra.</br></br></br>  <br> implying pinkshit is her mom <br>kek</br></br>  <br>A lot of his assistants can emulate him you know. Though it tends to look a bit off.</br>  <br> He doesn't know <br>Sakura's 900% her mom, anon. It was a red herring.</br></br>  <br>Salad is nothing like Sakura. Sakura is<br><br>-bitchy<br>-obsessed with her crush<br>-plays the good girl who follows the rules<br>-gets angry quickly<br>-secretly likes to do childish things<br>-enjoys bossing people around and criticizing them<br>-proud whenever she accomplishes stuff and wants praise<br>-a tattletail<br><br>Does even one of those apply to Salad? Salad is<br><br>+calm and vaguely unenthusiastic<br>+unconcerned with looking strong in front of her classmates<br>+the straight man<br>+the type to let people have their eccentricities without calling them out on it<br>+one to get happy or sad easily, but doesn't start yelling unless she gets pushed really far<br>+good at keeping secrets/being a bro</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She never trained under Tsunade, she just tagged along with her uncle's girlfriend.</br>  <br>Come on, anon, don't be delusional. It was fun to laugh at the tears who for one fucked up reason or another like Pinkshit, but she did somehow manage to acquire Sauce's sauce and got pregnant with his daughter.</br>  <br>You have autism anon. The point is they're supposed to represent comedic archetypes. She's the bitchy tsukkomi/straight man of the group. Just like 10/10 was in Lee's spinoff.</br>  <br> dat pose <br>so father is that clay guy?</br></br>  <br>I knew that pose looked familiar.</br>  <br>Stretching powers are not unique to Orochimaru.</br>  <br>He's still the dad/mom anon</br>  <br>Which is why we were speculating he could be an Otsutsuki. His name means full moon or something and the previews point out his eyes look like crescent moons when he smiles.<br><br>But the spoilers confirmed he's related to Orochimaru.</br></br></br>  <br> But the spoilers confirmed he's related to Orochimaru. <br><br>Born from.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Orochimaru is his mom and Netori is the dad?</br>  <br>Fucking hell, I know Sakura's man faced but this is ridiculous.</br>  If an assistant can imitate kishi to this degree, then he could do some Naruto Super/GT manga spinoff like Toyataro is doing it with toriyama's DB super  <br>I'd buy it.</br>  <br>Hinata was not a Division general in the Fourth Shinobi World War, no.<br><br>Hinata is by no means a close-combat beast - her younger sister by like six years was better than her and was more accomplished with the Byakugan. I mean, Hinata BARELY landed the 8 Trigram 64 Palms in the middle of the Fourth Shinobi World War - she got up to 32, was about to call it quits, and remembered the cute lil hand-holding with Naruto, and apparently that gave her the push to land the other 32 attacks and knock down ONE Juubi spawn.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the biggest Hinata fans there are, but she's not even slightly a combatant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, Shizune's related to Dan? <br>Also Tsunaded said that Sakura was even more capable student than Shizune implying she did teach her.</br></br>  do you think its somehow big deal for kishi to spend 1 day to draw couple pages  <br> Her Byakugan is about the same as others <br>It was probably Kishi not paying attention to what he wrote, but she could see ten kilometers ahead of her. For reference, the genius Neji could see fifty meters.<br>I suppose it could be explained by Hinata having more experience with using the Byakugan for expressly scouting purposes as opposed to Neji's focus on combat, the Branch family seal fucking with the efficiency of their Byakugans, or simply her hard work paying off and surpassing Neji's natural talent, but again, it all depends on my presuming that it was not just Kishi not paying attention/fucking up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I never said he wasn't, anon, and it's a better than evens chance he IS, whether vat-born or otherwise. I was simply saying that extendo-limbs does not immediately make him Oro's kid.</br></br>  <br>It could work <br>He just needs to change Boruto and Sarada personalities because with this<br>It looks like fucking jiraiya and.tsunade all over again but of course this is just a parody so everythings okay</br></br></br>  <br>She's got lion fists though, that's much more powerful than anything Hanabi has to offer, and she later got Hamura's chakra like Naruto got Hagoromo's.</br>  <br>Didn't she give some speech about how this was a war to protect Naruto so failure was not an option? I haven't read those chapters in ages, but I thought she had some level of command.</br>  <br>The guy does not strike me as someone who'd want to handle the manga seriously. He likes his gags and applies a very clear formula to pull them off.<br>Sure, that would make him more amenable to the idea of a light hearted SoL-esque format that would best serve the seires, but I am unsure whether he'd be willing/able to pull of something less ridiculous than the Lee spinoff.</br></br>  <br><br>There's nothing stopping Hanabi from also learning Twin Lion Fists, and Hamura's chakra was presumably just a temporary power-up.</br></br>  <br>We've seen diddly dick all of Hanabi's abilities. We can't really compare them at this point - we've only seen when Hiashi told Kurenai that he didn't care what happened to Hinata as Hanabi showed a ton more promise.<br><br>Pretty sure all Hyuuga's have Hamura's chakra, don't they? Wouldn't any main-clan Hyuuga have sufficed? He just wanted to get down to some delicious long-time incest.<br><br><br>I'm actually reading those chapters now. It was when Neji died and Naruto was seriously beginning to doubt his ability to protect everyone. Hinata gave him a big ol' slap and basically said "Fucking wake up to yourself you big stupid beautiful lovable faggot. We're all fighting for you. We knew what we were getting into. Neji did. I do. We all do. But we need you to get your head in it."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She gets pretty proficient with her gentle fist during the war arc, mastering 64 Palms (128 is filler), using vacuum fist and twin lion fist. She probably caught up with hanabi at least, who was supposed talented<br> twin lion vacuum fist never </br></br>  <br>Hanabo has kitten lion fist in storm 4</br>  <br>From the looks of it she's the equivalent of a lieutenant, appropriate for her chuunin rank.<br>What she does is rally the troops a couple of times, fights for a few days straight on the front, cooperates with Ino to pull off a move that ends up saving the whole army from being wiped out in a single attack, TnJ's and slaps the sense back into Naruto and impresses Madara while buffed by Naruto.<br>That's plenty for a character who is not expressly main cast.</br></br></br>  <br> we've only seen when Hiashi told Kurenai that he didn't care what happened to Hinata as Hanabi showed a ton more promise <br>Which was twenty years ago and everyone including Hiashy himself has said that it's bullshit to judge power by inherent talent since then.</br></br>  <br> they can heal almost any wound <br> can't heal eyes so you don't have to wear glasses <br>dropped like  a female baby in China </br></br></br>  <br>Larger titties.</br>  <br>But if they healed the need for glasses we wouldn't have gotten Sarada with glasses. It was a necessary choice.</br>  <br>As I said in , she only JUST gets around to mastering the final 32 palm strikes in the middle of the Fourth Shinobi World War after holding hands with Naruto. She gets to 32 palms and says that's her limit, so we can assume that she never got past that point before then.<br><br><br>Yeah, this is true I guess. I'd like to see a Hinata v Hanabi face-off now. While Hinata trained hard, Hanabi trained hard AS WELL AS having natural talent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Hinata's not a bitchy lying hypocrite, that's it.</br>  <br>She still can't do palm rotation, which is instrumental to covering the weakness of the byakugan.<br><br> Personally i liked that version of the palm rotation she invented in that filler where it was like a slicing field that played on her strength of inherent flexibility. I kinda wish it was canon, it could have been a good development for her character.  </br></br></br>  <br>Guys want a nice and supportive wife as Hinata, girls want to be iniative and confident like Sakura.</br>  <br><br>Is breast envy the root of all problems?</br></br>  <br>The sasuke rescue arc in part 2 (during sauce vs itachi) was pretty wasted for Team 8</br>  <br> Wasn't she a commander <br><br>No she was a nobody scrub like she had always been before</br></br></br>  <br> initiative and confident like Sakura <br>Sakura is neither of those though.<br><br>Girls like Sakura because she is flawed = human = good for self insertion. Boys like Hinata because they want to insert their dicks in her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> elite by birth <br>Maybe her chakra control.<br> beauty <br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>And great asses are the end of them.</br>  <br><br>Sakura's had at least two admirers that I can remember, Lee and that one fodder during the war. Like it or not it's pretty well established that she's canonically beautiful.</br></br>  <br>  you will never have a threesome with the Hyuuga sisters, with Hinata bringing the tits and Hanabi bringing dat ass. </br>    <br>Guys like the idea of having a girl like Hinata that will unconditionally love you and support you.<br><br>Girls like how Sakura never gives up on her lust for the good looking bad boy,</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Sakura is a genius.<br>Took her two years to get as good as Tsunade was medical-wise back during the Second Shinobi World War..</br></br>  <br>Every other girl in the Narutoverse is more attractive than Sakura. Maybe she had Moegi beat.</br>  <br>Delicious cake. Must eat.</br>  <br>I don't see why not. Hopefully none of Kishi's autism rubbed off on him.</br>  <br> Sakura <br> Confident </br></br>  <br>Even after he tries to kill her.<br><br>Twice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>if anything it's orochimaru and  kabuto's  kid</br></br>  <br>Sakura has always been hyped up as beautiful. Kishimoto thinks that by having people in the story tell you this, you'll believe it and it'll make her more likable. In fact, when he found out Sakura wasn't very liked, the first thing he tried to do was make her more beautiful... instead of developing her fucking character.</br>  <br>Well it's not happening to them. It's all fun and games until it actually happens to you. Then you find out it isn't fun.</br>  <br> The guy does not strike me as someone who'd want to handle the manga seriously <br>Good. Serious edgy bullshit is what killed nardo to begin with.</br></br>  <br>Hinata had a nice character arc, getting stronger in the background, each time we saw her she was a little better. Until she was finally showing enough strength to stand up seriously, even correct and stand behind the guy she loved by the war arc.<br><br>There's a lot of discrediting going around, it was always more than that though. <br><br>She was liked well before she was revealed to have boobs. She earned major points during the Chunin fights, never giving up during an impossible fight unto the verge of death, being the first one to like Naruto for just being him, and her speech right before he fought Neji. She stood up to Pain to save Naruto, saving her life while sacrificing herself, and confessing at the time thus showing her guts. How she's evolved can be seen there compared to previously.<br><br>Even the VA's comment they like her because she progressed and grew strong like that, even if it wasn't in the lime light.<br><br>Being attractive is a nice bonus. Nice character, nice character arc, and a hot body, not just in the sense that she has curves, but her hair, her eyes, her face, it all works in a nice way. She's that mix of cute and sexy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  下げる  <br><br>Well this is true but he had two errors with her. <br><br>One she cut her hair in some ugly rigid style. Two she's too flat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well considering some LNs that don't have the heroine mature until the 20th volume and real life celebs, I can see why he would think this.</br>  <br>And has yet to get a single kiss.</br>  Who are Mitsukis parents?  <br>  Sakura and Sasuke's first night together <br>  Sasuke dyes Sakura's hair black and puts it in a ponytail <br>  Draws lines on her face with charcoal <br>  Puts in Sharingan contacts <br>  Only from behind, just in case <br>  Sakura has to yell "MAYBE NEXT TIME" the whole time they're doing it </br></br></br></br></br></br>   implying Burrito won't go down as the strongest Jyuuken user of all time <br>Why are you wasting your breath on Hinata?</br>  <br>I was reading part 1 recently and I had completely forgotten how cool her fight with Neji was, Such a good moment.</br>  <br><br> that little push <br><br>It's like a bitch mode shinra tensei</br></br></br></br>    So if hinata didn't get with nardo, would she have remained single forever or give in to hyuugacest?  <br>People really need to think more about these things.<br><br>He was stopped by Shikadai's shadow bind before the blow could connect. The fact that his skin ripped isn't saying "Oh man what fucking weak shit", its saying "That's how powerful the blow was, just imagine if it had hit".</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru.</br>  <br>Still fucking brings me to tears, every time.<br><br>Just stay down, Hinata. You've done enough. You've shown everyone how strong you've become. Don't get up again. My heart can't take it.  And neither can yours .</br></br></br>  <br>Brianna Wu?</br>  <br>No thanks i don't want this series to become Dragon Ball 2 with funny shit</br>  <br> He was stopped by Shikadai's shadow bind before the blow could connect. The fact that his skin ripped isn't saying "Oh man what fucking weak shit", its saying "That's how powerful the blow was, just imagine if it had hit". <br><br>How did he escape it?</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru already has a kid, anon.</br>  <br>Cheating</br>  <br>I don't deny that Hinata is a likable character with mostly positive traits. I just think it's funny that when someone remarked that they liked her, Kishimoto laughed and immediately figured it was for her big boobs. She isn't a complete blob, but she (like most females in this manga) was dropped flat and her only saving hope for relevancy was her thirst for Uzumaki dick.</br>  <br>Again, the distinction is between the dreadful, wannabe serious/edgy bullshit that Kishi did and the overly goofy stuff of the Lee spinoff aimed at 6 year olds which got old pretty fucking fast.<br>There should be a happy middle ground between those two, I'm just not sure if that assistant can reach it.</br></br>  <br> How did he escape it? <br>No clue. All we know is they fight, some green shurikens are thrown, Shikadai holds a kunai and it ends when Bort uses Mass Shadow Clone via device and Shikadai surrenders.</br></br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br>   Daughter </br>  <br>He contributed enough to the main series. I don't see why he can't capture a similar tone with the new one. <br><br>On the bright side at least he hates Uchihas.</br></br></br>  <br>The idiot could have won without cheating</br>  <br> On the bright side at least he hates Uchihas. <br>Okay, I like him much better now.</br></br>  <br>Then Naruto interrupts the match, strips Bort's headband off, declares Shikadai the winner instead.<br><br>Says he'll talk to him about this when they get home, Bort suddenly explodes about how a lecture would be something he would be glad to receive, but Dad isn't even home for that much. Don't pretend you'll suddenly be home enough for it now.<br><br><br>Shadows are serious business</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And murder Shikadai in the process.<br><br><br>Anyone who pisses on Sasuke's head is alright in my books.</br></br></br></br>  This is even better than the Rock Lee series.  <br><br> Elite Jounin by birth <br><br>The fuck is this? Hinata was a clear example of hardwork and guts, she wasn't an "elite" by birth unless it means "being born in a prestigious clan"</br></br></br></br>  Plebs don't know that it's  Anko's  child.  <br> she wasn't an "elite" by birth unless it means "being born in a prestigious clan" <br>That's what he means. <br><br>And you fucking Jews, I'm not typing the CAPTCHA wrong. Stop telling me that I am.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this getting translated yet?</br>  <br> Anko's child <br>Who?</br></br>  <br> yfw Burrito had to perv on all his friends' moms for research </br>  <br>Get the fuck out of this place, dare to post sakura's smug on cancerous thread. <br><br>All of you just fucking kill yourselves, and fuck off with your ''HUG CLUB'' bullshit.</br></br></br>  The Countdown/Secret is a new anime, novel, manga or movie about these three    <br> And you fucking Jews, I'm not typing the CAPTCHA wrong. Stop telling me that I am. <br><br>I'm getting the same Shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The fat lady in that was not the little niglet in 700.</br>  We'll never now what's in the big city  <br>Either that or it just announces when they'll be opening the doors to the theater.<br><br>I'd prefer the former though. I like this generation too much.</br></br></br>  <br>When is the announcement supposed to come out again?</br>  <br>Half an hour before the movie comes out.</br>  <br>So 1st and 2nd trained the 3rd<br>3rd Team leader of Jiraiya<br>Jiraiya Team leader of Minato<br>Minato Team leader of Kakashi<br>Kakashi Team leader of Naruto<br>Naruto Team leader of Konohamaru<br>Konohamaru Team leader of Boruto</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The movie is set to be released in Japanese theatres on August 7, 2015 <br><br>Fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>we actually knew a long time ago</br>  <br> Naruto Team leader of Konohamaru <br>Not officially, but he definitely taught Konohamaru some shit. <br><br>So basically either nardo has to teach Salad, or Konohamaru has to become Hokage first. Otherwise the nepotis- pottery doesn't work.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you retarded? Naruto was not the team leader of Konohamaru, Ebisu was.<br><br>Nice going retard</br></br></br></br>  holy shit.<br>I hate hate hate what kishi did to this fucking series.<br>It was badass when it was "hard work pays off" with Rock Lee, Naruto beating Neji, and the cool sidecast.<br>Now literally EVERYFUCKINGONE that matters is "elite bloodline".<br>Fuck that noise.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>there is a like 14 years gap between Last Naruto movie and Naruto becoming a hokage, he can easily be team leader in that time frame, he was already teaching shit on the academy anyway</br></br>  <br> Mitsuki is a not creepy Orochimaru <br> Boruto just wants daddy to be proud of him <br> Sarada proves two minuses make a positive </br></br></br>  <br> being this autistic </br>  <br>well, they do are elite blood lines, Naruto only beat neji cause he has kyubi chakra when neji blocked his</br>  <br>Naruto only taught Konohamaru, he wasnt their team leader.</br>  <br> Fuck that noise <br>Nah. You see enough "muh hard work" characters in shounen even though they almost always turn out to have some secret past and are destined to save the world or some shit. <br><br>It's much more refreshing to have a bunch of Ubermenschen whose destinies are unclear. That way the ridiculous feats they'll inevitably pull out of their asses seem less stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how said he was not? he spent 14 years doing nothing?</br>  <br>It took Kishimoto this long to create a team that could actually work together effectively and isn't filled with wannabe psychopaths. He better not leave us hanging.</br>  <br>This is why I like that new ultra battle sattelite series. I hate how shonen always need that damn bloodline trope - I mean I get why, in that bloodline is a convenient way to make a bullshit powerup (oh hey I just awakened my legacy powers how convenient!) and distinguish why they're the MC, but it's so much cooler when a character whose family is a non-factor actually makes something out of themselves... although now that I think of it you're right I can't name a damn shonen that doesn't fall into that trope besides battle sattelite and world trigger.</br>  <br>Up there, there is nothing but jonin financial analysts.</br>  <br> he spent 14 years doing nothing? <br>He probably had to climb the ninja social ladder, ninja Jesus or no. He also had to bang Hinata and raise two kids.</br></br>  <br>Saved the earth from the Moon, dated hinata, married hinata, Fucked hinata, took care of boruto,fucked hinata again, took care of himawari,</br>  <br> implying he only fucked hinata twice <br>more like he spent 6 years having sex every fucking night.</br></br>  <br>those 14 years is after the moon, so in boruto time, its been about 16 years since the 4th ninja war, a little over 32 - 35 years since the 3rd</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>You can't have everything in a Shounen<br>At least Kishi didn't make Naruto.Marry the main heroine</br></br>  <br>Naruto's theme never was hard work, it was never giving up. That's why they make a big deal of the word shinobi (endure).</br>  <br> At least Kishi didn't make Naruto.Marry the main heroine <br> made the busty shy girl win last generation <br> childhood friend his a shoe-in for this one <br>All he has to do is hook up nardos grandson with Shizune and all will be right with the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he was promoted to Jounin rank and was a sensei to three Genin (could be pretty entertaining, to be fair), it would have to be three new rookies, not Konohamaru's group. They are what, three years younger than he is?<br><br>Let's say he gets more focused and is promoted sometime before his marriage (really fucking short time, maybe a double promotion like Neji, because he is the single most powerful being on the planet, which he just saved again). He is in the 19-20 age range. It's possible for newly minted Jounin to be granted students (see Kurenai), but at that age he'd only have a few years of experience and a helluva power gap on his new students. Realistically he'd have to spend a year or two as a Jounin but doing missions normally, like Shikamaru or Sakura were doing before taking on students. Promoted, I can see him take command of units composed of Chuunin and Genin, but not as an officially appointed teacher.<br>By the time he got to an age where he could responsibly take on students (22-24?), Konohamaru and his friends would be at 19-21 themselves, easily already Chuunin, possibly Jounins themselves. There is no way he'd be listed as Konohamaru's teacher, not formally at any rate.<br><br>That said it could be interesting to see a team trained by him, and Sarada (say, spotting the patterns thanks to a comment by Bolt) getting nervous someone would snatch the Hokage title and she'd have to play the waiting game as her best option.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Boruto won't use his own mother for sexy jutsu <br><br>He'll never max out it's potential at this rate</br></br>  <br>Westermarck effect, anon.</br>  <br>Funny as the one-shot was, I don't see the guy use the technique at any rate, not until he resolves his daddy issues and learns to have some fun. Preferably he'd start to develop an odd similarity to Jiraiya at this point.</br>  <br>She was never said to have perfect chakra control.</br>  <br> thanks to a comment by Bolt <br>Which one?</br></br>  <br>Naruto probably made the Sexy Justu: Hinata Varient a SSS rank forbbiden jutsu, whos use is punishable by death.</br>  <br>I was speculating, anon. He made no such comment, but I could see him starting to point dubious shit out about the Hokage system's nepotism. Which would make Sarada kinda butthurt that she did not really get any training from a previous Hokage, is instructed by a guy who only got unofficially taught a single technique from Naruto and her only real link is being daughter to his rival. <br>Should he have three pupils of his own, the elders might pick any of them over her Uchiha ass, hence the speculated annoyance.</br></br>  What I want to know is WHY they still haven't done anything about Orochimaru. They treat him almost like an old friend, and even allow his creepy spawn into the village. Did I miss something?  <br><br>war hero</br></br>  <br>He's like a cockroach. He's been killed like 4 times, he had his soul sealed twice, and he just keeps coming back.<br><br>If you can't get rid of him, you might as well put him to work.</br></br></br>  <br>Well a) he said he wasn't evil anymore and b) it's pointless trying to do anything against him, he'll just resurrect and try to destroy the village again.</br>  <br>The only people who can manage to even kill him at this point are Naruto and Sasuke, maybe Tsunade if she brings her A game. <br>Once you achieve that massive feat, he has a million and one ways of coming back from the dead.<br>He also helped to save the world.<br><br>It's easy enough to see how some sort of compromise could be reached with him, to avoid headaches and future conflict all around. You know, he agrees not to do TOO horrible things, so long as the Leaf does not watch too closely, maybe he gives them some of the fruits of his scientific work while they happen to lose supplies near his place and neglect to burn down his old hideouts. he sticks to using clones and genetically engineered bodies for his host migration and does not kidnap children, they don't murder him and everyone with the curse mark.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did I miss something? <br>Yes, anon. Yes you did.</br></br>  <br>Elders can't pick shit, Naruto runs a dictatorship.</br>  <br>the power of forgiveness and friendship anon</br>  <br> implying he can be a bad guy/girl when he gave us best boy </br>  <br>The previous Hokages did not get to pick their successors, otherwise Danzo would not have had a shot at becoming the one after Tsunade.<br>Technically it is the feudal lord who appoints the head of the mercenary city state under his vague vassalage, but he is heavily advised by the clan heads and the elders who look for someone who is sufficiently popular, powerful and connected to the previous Kages in some way, probably reflecting various clan interests.<br><br>It's a real shame the main focus of the series was Uchiha fucking shits and DARKNESS, because we could have had a story focusing on missions and intra- and inter-village politics, with some shit with the feudal lords and elemental nations thrown in. And when the story would inevitably go to a Fourth World War it would not be against faceless plant zombies and characters we've already had a resolution with, but against fellow (ninja wizard) humans fighting for their country like the good guys, maybe having to face characters they have previously met under more positive circumstances in joint missions or in the chuunin exams.<br>Or we could have vaguely gay, continent-busting Uchihas ruining everything for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The previous Hokages did not get to pick their successors <br>Tobirama made Sarutobi the hokage out of the blue.</br></br>  <br>Hashirama picked his brother. Tobirama picked Hiruzen. Hiruzen picked Minato. Minato died and then Hiruzen died and here we have the only case of someone other than the Hokage picking the next Hokage. Tsunade picked Kakashi and then Kakashi picked Naruto.<br><br>Naruto's a military dictator.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We see the feudal lord and the elders/clan heads actively discussing who to pick to succeed Tsunade.<br>So out of the successions we see in any detail there's the elders asking Jiraiya to either take the post or hunt down Tsunade and make her take the post, and the above case.<br>That points to succession not being directly controlled by the Hokage. By all means it is possible to steer the process if you make precautions while alive so that it goes to someone you want, and it might be a different matter if you step down on your own accord.<br>The real question, then, is whether Naruto would step down after, say, ten, fifteen years like Kakashi.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto's a military dictator <br>Of the National Socialist variety?</br></br>  <br>That was Kakashi.</br>  <br> The real question, then, is whether Naruto would step down after, say, ten, fifteen years like Kakashi <br>The only person he may presumably step down for is either Konohamaru or Salad once she's old enough.<br><br>His children will be old enough to live on their own by that point, and likely have families of their own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They can discuss it all they like but the power of succession ultimately resides with the Hokage.</br>  <br> Naruto's a military dictator <br><br>fucking what</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck me, I'd gladly help her restart the Uchiha clan, even knowing that at the very least the men are damned to insanity. Imagine how different the past would have been if Madara was a woman.</br>  <br> Imagine how different the past would have been if Madara was a woman <br> implying anything would change </br></br>  <br>Naruto commands a shinobi army and his word, in Konoha at least, is law. Military dictatorship.<br><br>And lets face it, the feudal lords are only in power because the ninja let them be.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Hashirama would have fucked her and just given her enormous power over Konoha. I don't know why the men are in charge of anything when the women are the clear road to power.</br>  <br>Any average girl will have at least 15 admirers before she turns 18.<br><br>If Sakura only had 2 she must be ugly as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> she's now butthurt over Hashiarama picking another woman <br> wipes out the Uzumaki village/clan in petty revenge </br></br>  <br>You're such a god damn moron</br>  <br>Oh please do go on, explain how.</br>  <br><br><br> Naruto ranks coincide with real life politics <br><br>You're giving Kishi way too much credit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Calling it, Mitsuki best boy</br>  <br> kishimoto created a society based on nothing <br>You are the one who is giving him too much credit.</br></br>  <br>All I can think about is that series of doujin with Sasuke love/hate-fucking a female Itachi.</br>  <br>Kishimoto created the idea of Hokage because he wanted wanted to create a character that represented leadership. Anything else is fan fiction</br>  <br>Did he also created the daimyo? is Kishimoto a time traveler or maybe he based his manga on something that already existed?</br>  <br> spinoff of Naruto centered around literal corporate espionage operations on Konoha's Wall Street <br>Imagine the possibilities.</br></br>  <br>How did it turn from learning to walk up a tree to being able to blow up planets with their powers? Like that is a fucking bs power jump</br>  <br>He might have gotten inspiration from Daimyo. But since there's no interviews stating that he did, we can't just outright claim that was the source of inspiration of from the Daimyo. We can only assume. The Presiden of the United states has control of the army, Kishi could have gotten the idea of Hokage from there for all we know.</br>  I can't believe Orochimaru was the only Sannin to reproduce.  <br>And it wouldn't be too far-fetched because the Hokage monument is literally ninja mount rushmore</br>  <br>If only Naruto was about ninjas and not battle wizards...</br>  <br>Why can't it be both?</br>   Is your dad Monkey D.... <br> Nope </br>  <br>Or Senju before they disappear for no reason.</br>  Naruto and One Piece shall never be apart  <br>all salad will do is take tenten's place, with boruto taking lee's place</br>  <br>That's the joke, from the perspective of the new generation all of them were elite by birth, while in reality so was only sasuke<br>Naruto, Hinata and Sakura had to train three times as much as Sasuke to get to his level</br></br>  <br> That bottom left shot with Neji <br>;_; fuck nigga</br></br>  <br>Ninjas had always the reputation of being capable to perform magic.<br>Those Jutsus are nothing new.</br></br>   unfunny chibi bullshit   <br>well an elite bloodline needs to start somewhere.</br>  Since Kabuto is a snake-guy too, why can't Mitsuki be his spawn?  Orochimaru and Luffy had kid yo  <br>The thing is, the Village could put pressure on the Daimyo and his councillors if they tried to appoint someone the ninja didn't approve of. If they try to push it, Konoha could just shrug and say "Righto, we'll being taking back those twelve incredibly powerful shinobi we designate to protect you. So, you know, good luck protecting yourself when someone from Kirigakure comes to take your head."</br>  <br>Yes and no. The shinobi world is currently at peace. Konoha wouldn't go to war against Suna simply because Naruto says "Fuck those Sand faggots." More than likely, he'd be kicked out of the Hokageship.<br><br>Also, if the ninja start acting up, odds are the Feudal lords could hire either another Village, the Samurai, or both.</br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/pmEJaM3NS5c?t=42  [ ]<br><br>At least he got to be part of the best jutsu in the game. Even after he died</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and that falls under the concept of a coup where people are dissatisfied with their leader and overthrow him. Not that they could. You try kicking the worlds strongest man out of power when the only other person who can match him doesn't care about you at all.<br><br>It's not like with us how the law and armies secure the Hokage position, it's that they could kill a whole army by themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke cares about Konoha now. If Naruto started pulling shit to try destabilise it, Sasuke would step in.</br>  <br>As if, if Naruto started throwing his weight around and turned from a benevolent dictator into an oppressive one Sasuke still wouldn't care.<br><br>You could maybe stretch it by having him care about what happens to his family, but since Naruto likes them it's not like they're unsafe.</br></br></br>  <br>Where can i read this? PLEASE </br>  <br>Sasuke came back to blow a fucking meteor out of the sky in The Last. He wanted to fight Naruto to the death for the title of Hokage. Sasuke cares about Konohagakure now. It's just the truth.</br>  Why is Burrito such a winner? Best Naruto character since Kakashi.  <br>I'm enjoying this Boruto shit more than I did Naruto. Hoping a series comes from this and not just movies.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>easy there, naruto shouldn't be on that list. He is practically on the same level as sasuake, with them being alien reincarnations</br>   Hinata <br> Elite Jounin by birth <br><br>HA, still best girl though.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not buying it, it makes more sense he did that out of friendship for Naruto; who is coincidentally the only person able to kill him and wouldn't be happy if his home was exploded and Sasuke could have stopped it but didn't.</br>  <br> He wanted to fight Naruto to the death for the title of Hokage <br>He also wanted to be a villain and kill all the kage with that title.</br></br>  <br>As I said, the Daimyo's decision is likely heavily influenced by the advice he gets from the various elders and family heads in the village proper.<br>Unless it was someone the feudal lord would outright refuse to deal with (i.e. an Uchiha) he would likely be fine with appointing whomever, so long as they are reasonable and know their place. <br>The succession seems to be operated on the lines of<br> 1) the previous Hokage steps down and picks a successor/nominates someone who, with the blessing of the previous leader of the village, will have a massive advantage in the determination of successor <br> 2) the previous Hokage is killed/died and has to be replaced, having left some sort of instruction for succession - much like above, though without real enforcement of it, on the honour system <br> 3) the previous Hokage is killed/died and has to be replaced, having left no suggestions as to who picks up the slack - the decision is handled entirely by the clan heads who make a number of proposals and deliberate amongst themselves, at which point their recommendation for the post goes to the Daimyo who 'picks' the candidate that they want <br><br>Now I wrote it down, the process sounds a bit like the British elections (or any other constitutional monarchy, I suppose), just replace voting citizens with clan heads and elders making the call.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except that's not how it works, there's nothing democratic about Hokage succession if there's already a Hokage alive. The votes only happen if their previous dictator never appointed his successor.</br>  <br>Well yeah, obviously the last bit only applies to option 3.<br>We really should have gotten more political shit.</br></br>  <br>You can not buy it all you want, dude. If he was indeed friends with Naruto, he'd stop Naruto fucking up the Village by going to war with an allied nation.<br><br>Friends don't let friends declare war on allied nations.<br><br><br>There's no real reason a Feudal lord wouldn't approve of an Uchiha, depending on who it was. They wouldn't have a problem with Shisui or Itachi.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking more along the lines of a post-world war feudal lord licking out Naruto's successor. If it's the same guy, he might remember squatting in some hole, shitting his pants as two Uchiha fucked up their lands and their peasants' villages. <br>A guy could take that personally. Hell, even the next generation of feudal lords would likely remember that Uchihas are fucking shit.</br></br>  <br>I think you're gravely misunderstanding the character of Sasuke and what he'd let Naruto do. Naruto would win the war against sand by himself, anyway, leaf village would remain unfucked.</br>  <br>There's no way Naruto isn't putting his son and his husbando's daughter on the same team even if they are both busting planets since birth.</br>  Soon..  <br>There's a worldwide ceasefire at the moment with all of the Villages, included the smaller ones like Ame. Konoha would immediately become set against the rest of the world. I think you're misunderstanding the character of Sasuke. His entire THING of talking to all the Kage was that he was doing a Heel Face Turn and putting the Village first now.<br><br><br>I guess. Still would largely depend on the candidate. If the Feudal lord turned down Sarada, he'd have to explain his position to a probably rather upset and indignant Sasuke, Sakura, and Seventh Hokage, among others. And he'd probably get ignored anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The one who gave the inspiring speech about protecting Naruto was actually Sakura</br>  <br>Once again, "Elite from birth" went to Salad because of who her parents were, not Sakura.</br>  <br>You know, that takes me way back. I think I actually liked the artstyle more back then too.</br>  <br>Didn't have the same impact as Hinata's had. Before Hinata's slap, Naruto was set to pretty much just give up, because holy fuck I can't protect everyone.</br>  <br>Naruto and Sasuke could take the whole world, there wouldn't even need to be a war. Naruto would just inform them they're now under his command and if they refuse they die.<br><br>Boom, now all village is konoha village.</br></br></br>  <br>But again, that's if Sasuke decided to go along with Naruto's insanity, which I don't believe he would.</br>  <br>How so? He made Sasuke the MC of the second spinoff</br>  <br>Sasuke's version of not going along with Naruto's insanity is telling him he can't come with to dick around in the forest for twelve years looking for a mysterious enemy he has no way to find, or find out if it really exists.</br>  <br>I'd enjoy seeing Sasuke say goodbye to Sakura and everyone and just muttering 'Jackass' as he wanders away from the Village, and he just spends the 12 years going to all the other Villages and makes it his mission to visit every brothel in every Village.<br><br>I'd read that Doujin.<br><br>I also have no idea how it took 12 years to dick around in about half a dozen realities.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boruto despises the whole Nara family</br>  <br>And all because Shikadai didn't go rabble rousing with him that one time, Nara fucking shits!</br>  <br>Why do you think so? If anything he's got a distaste for hard work that they have too.<br>Is it just him blaming Shikamaru for his dad not spending so much time with him?</br></br>  <br><br>Not quite.<br><br>His assistant does like to include elements of canon in his stories, but they are buried between a shitton of batshit insane, exagerated hillarity and they become apparent only in hindsight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man,now I remembered how awesome Land of the Waves arc was with Zabuza and Haku being a legitimate villain pair with proper characterisation. Then the Chuunin exam arc which had some legit clever fights where you never knew who was going to come out on top and how.<br>If Bleach reached its peak with the Soul Society arc, what would you say was the last good Naruto arc? The hunt for Sasuke, maybe?</br></br>  <br><br>Mitsuki does believe that in canon, though.<br><br>It's only after the events of the movie that Boruto decides he rather be the shinobi working in the shadows.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Boku no Hero Academia. (although that is the case with some of the cast).<br>Mahou Sensei Negima.<br>Also, pretty much every martial arts manga ever.</br></br></br>  <br>The last good bit of the main manga was probably the Pein arc (sans the mass resurrection and the very end of it all), but what it was was a small oasis of 'hey, actually this isn't shit'.</br>  <br><br>Actually, by the time of the war, Hinata's byakugan is explicitely stated to be better than Neji's.<br><br>Her weaknesses are psychological mostly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>From the official movie novelization's first chapter:<br><br> Mitsuki without sarcasm: “As expected of the Nanadaime Hokage’s son, and the Yondaime Hokage’s grandchild…Eventually Boruto will also become the Hokage…?’ </br></br></br>  <br> vaguely gay <br> vaguely </br></br>  <br>I think Kishimoto's first asspull was Naruto winning his fight via fart. Absolutely hated that.</br>  <br><br> Pretty sure all Hyuuga's have Hamura's chakra, don't they? Wouldn't any main-clan Hyuuga have sufficed? He just wanted to get down to some delicious long-time incest. <br><br>Nope. It's more explicit in the novel, but Hinata was chosen.<br><br>That's why she was granted the title of Byakugan princess.<br><br>It was destiny/prophecy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually, by the time of the war, Hinata's byakugan is explicitely stated to be better than Neji's. <br>Where? The closest I remember to that is her having a 10km field of vision, far above Neji's when he was a genin, but we never do learn what his range is in Part 2.</br></br>  <br><br>She had some people after her in Sakura Hidden too.<br><br>And even if I'll always choose Hinata, I can admit that she looked pretty as fuck in her The Last design (which is presumably what she looks like in the novel).</br></br></br></br>  <br>What novel?<br><br>The only sub I've seen was the shitty English one with Korean audio, so I probably missed it.</br></br></br>  So does naruto die in the new movie or what? Any of it been leaked?  <br> So does naruto die in the new movie or what?  <br><br>No, just kidnapped</br></br></br>  Yay  filler  next week    <br>It was more of a joke than anything. He did pull off a proper combo attack using his clones, but before that moment of the class clown loser overcoming an enemy everyone else thought superior to him, someone rowdy and loud like him but who had all the guidance and comfort of family he wished for but never had, before all that Kishi felt it necessary to add in a fart joke.<br>Funny thing is, if it was just for something to slow Kiba down, the former prankster could have used a stink bomb or something amusing but at the same time inventive and useful, but he went with a fart joke instead.</br></br>  <br>Hinata is seriously like the best of the best. I like her The Last look as well, but I think her Shippuden look is my favourite.</br>  <br> At least Kishi didn't make Naruto.Marry the main heroine <br><br>That's standard in battle/action shoujo: YYH, Dragon Ball, etc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That and connections.<br><br>Both Naruto and Sasuke were desitned for greatness, but Naruto achieves his dreams by forming connections with others, protecting others, etc.<br><br>In contrast, Sasuke erodes as a character the more he obsesses with vengeance and pushes people away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Niggastream.</br>  <br>He reminds them to their better times when they could understand what the Sharigan really did.</br>  <br>Yeah, I guess joke would be better way than asspull. I still really didn't like it.</br>  <br>And as his friend, he would beat him through the power of friendship to make him DE-EDGE just as he did to him once.<br><br>Sasuke's no longer edgy. He's just Batman.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure it's mentioned in the latest databook.<br><br>There's also the fact that she can tell Naruto and his clones apart, while Neji couldn't.<br><br>And Hinata kept her byakugan working longer than Neji could.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shikadai seems to be his rival.<br><br>I wouldn't be shocked if he has to compete with him for Sarada.<br><br>Probably he also has more contact with Sakura, Karui (because Chouchou hangs around with Sakura), Ten Ten (selling him illegal tech) and Ino.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsunade can beat oro <br>Oro is in a 20 year old body and Tsunade is going on 80.</br></br>  <br> she can tell Naruto and his clones apart, while Neji couldn't. <br><br>It's because he's her husbando, and what she could tell was that Naruto wasn't a Zetsu clone. No byakugan can tell a clone from the original.</br></br></br>  <br> Tsunade is going on 80. <br>Regeneration</br></br>  What do you think is the most mindfucking spoiler you could give the 2005 you?<br><br> Their children are best friends </br></br>  <br><br>That's the reason she's going 80, you dumbass.<br><br>That's probably why she was so eager to hand everything to Kakashi.<br><br>She's running out of years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it stops the aging process given that Sakura is aging aswell and she has a better version.</br>  <br>  Tenten runs an underground weapons market that she builds alongside master smiths from the Land of Iron <br>  Wrist-mounted shuriken launchers <br>  Chakra siphons <br>  Pills that temporarily change your chakra element alignment <br>  Implants that allow mixing of two elements to 'create' kekkei genkai <br><br>I'd watch it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    She is cute. Cute!  <br>The regeneration makes her age FASTER. Her cells have a finite number of splits, and once those splits are used up, no more regeneration.<br><br>Considering she used it against Orochimaru and Kabuto, and then overcharged it against Madara, I'm surprised she's still able to look as young as she does.<br><br>Then again, Mei Terumi doesn't use that and she still looks like a top-tier MILF.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She only needs the power of love, anon</br>  <br>They kinda messed up the eyebrows.</br>  <br><br>There's really no evidence what so ever that Sakura has ever used Creation Rebirth under any circumstance.<br><br>I think her age lines are mostly stress than any shortening of her lifespan.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shame we never saw how her body looked like. Damn that robe.<br><br>Then again, I like girls with byakugans.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm surprised she's still able to look as young as she does. <br><br>The amount of chakra she spends to keep her illussion is negligible.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 5head vagoo <br>I don't know, man</br></br>  <br> Implying Sakura would show signs of aging and Tsunade wouldn't <br><br>She's lost at the very least 4 relatives. 2 of which was due to her own weakness and countless friends.<br><br>I would hope Tsunade reproduced but given her age and her spam of auto healing techniques I'd say her chances of fertility 0<br><br>This means only Boruto and Karin carry senju dna.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> as anon said, genetics are everything in the new series <br> fucking literally forgets as you would to water the fucking plants to give Boruto the Byakugan <br><br>good job Kishi, good job!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Implying Sakura would show signs of aging and Tsunade wouldn't <br><br>Where the fuck am I implying that?<br><br>You do realize I'm talking about Sakura there, right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said A game. If she uses everything she has at her disposal she could maybe win, due to her in depth knowledge of his abilities, her own regeneration matching the shit he can do and her having an advantage when it comes to direct physical combat. The slugs are supposed to beat the snakes. We never really saw her use ninjutsu, but it is safe to presume he is better at it than her. <br>If she does everything just right, she has a chance of killing him. Probably also dying in the process due to exhaustion/poison/wounds.</br></br>  <br> Then again, Mei Terumi doesn't use that and she still looks like a top-tier MILF. <br><br>Because she was only in her 30s during the war. <br><br>Meanwhile Tsunade is like in 70 in the last chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's like you guys have never read an Naruto SD before  <br>He didn't forget. Giving the byakugan to Boruto would fuck over his not-gaySN.</br>  If you download manga, what's the best way to read it? I've been trying to figure out a nice way to read manga on my PC, but I can't seem to configure my way to a pleasant viewing experience.<br><br>Are there any programs designed for reading manga or that work work well for it?<br><br>Or is this a futile endeavor, and should I stick to web reading?</br></br></br></br>  I use CdisplayEx. That being said, I don't read manga that often.  <br>I'll give it a look, thanks.</br>  Get Mangameeya. Can't imagine using any other alternative.  Honeyview.  I use MangaMeeya. <br>I found it was the easiest to use (apart from honeyview) but had a lot more options, such as page splitting, etc, that honeyview didn't do quite as well.</br>  Haven't found a comic reader I'd consider great yet. I'm currently using MComix.  <br>The thing I like most about mangameeya, which is probably irrelevant for most people, is that it loads huge archive insanely fast. I remember CDisplay would regularly struggle with loading zip files that contain an entire series, much less quickly flipping back and forth through pages.</br>  <br>Also, if you use MangaMeeya on a tablet like i do, you can even change touch gestures.<br>So, if i tap the screen, it changes to next page,<br>and swipe up, it goes back a page.<br>And i set it to go to the next/previous folder if i swipe right/left on the screen.<br>You can basically set it to whatever you want.<br>Fucking handy as hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't use a tablet, but this sounds useful. How easy is it to use on a computer?</br></br>  <br>This. Love the program</br>  WINDOWS SHELL VIEWER  Just use kissmanga or whichever other site allows you to read whole chapter at once. <br><br>Strangely though I still rather read manga on my phone than pc, it's a lot comfier.</br></br>  Mangameeya is great, but I'm too lazy to download manga chapters anymore so I go with kissmanga.<br><br>If it's a complete manga I'll download the whole thing, though.</br></br>  is there a program that can do infinite scrolling like all manga readers on browser ?  MangaMeeya seems perfect, thanks to those who suggested it, and I may try Honeyview for other purposes as well.<br><br>I'll delete the thread in a second here since it's served its purpose.</br></br>  <br>I think that's only possible for pdfs and the like.</br>  I also use Honeyview, it's pretty good but it uses too much RAM. I also use it to view PSD files without opening Photoshop, pretty useful for those working with digital art or editing manga for scanlations.   reading scanlated manga  <br> streaming scanlated manga </br>  I still use CDisplay, slow but better navigation for my laptop screen. That's remind me I tried to write another one in Delphi, got pass the phase to reading and navigating through pages, got stuck in opening zip file though, 7zip api was too confusing.<br><br>Maybe I should wait for Rust to have a decent GUI library so I can try again.</br></br>  <br>And you're reading illegal photocopies. Buy the books.</br>  <br> delete the thread </br>  So is kidd and his goonie posse gonna fight kaidou or get on their knees and suck his bbc?  I don't know what is happening in this chapter. so confusing.  <br>Sanji and co run from the big mom pirates.<br><br>Kaidou tries to kill himself by jumping off a cloud 10,000 meters in the air, but lives and lands in front of kidd and co</br></br></br>  <br>just wait for a better translation</br>  DOES NOBODY REACT ON THE FACT THAT UROUGE IS A SO FUCKING HIGH PRIEST THAT KAIDOU DIDNT EVEN TRY TO ATTACK HIM  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>the pirates had kaidou's logo not big mom's</br>  <br>share no urouge <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>lost to this</br>  <br>Yeah. That's why they're after Momo and not Caesar</br>  <br> Foreshadowed as this invincible beast of a person <br> Turns out he's just a lucky dickhead <br><br>I'm surprised, but not disappointed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's so physically strong and mighty that he can't die; I don't think it's luck.</br>  <br>If that's the case, then why doesn't he just drown himself?</br>  <br>He doesn't truly want to die. He just does this shit as a hobby. He'd probably survive anyways.</br>  <br>Gills. He has the features of every beast is my guess.</br>  I really hope Kaidou and Big Mamu turn out to secretly be decent human beings like Whitebeard did.<br><br>It never actually crossed my mind until this chapter that Kaidou could actually have some kind of tragic twist to his character and so far all of the Yonkou we have met that aren't Blackbeard are pretty cool guys.</br></br>  <br>i like the new character</br>  <br>a tsunami will send him to the shore safely.</br>   Kaido is an emo emperor   Moria probably didn't even taste 10% of Kaido's power if he thought he had a chance to take on him with zombie Oars.  <br> Chopper gets a furry girlfriend </br>    <br><br>I don't think he intended to take him on with Oars alone.<br><br>The plan was implied to use Oars to gain shadows of New World Pirates and amass a fleet - he stated it during TB ('stronger allies').</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he try to jump to the ocean? Is he dumb?</br>  <br><br>We need to see more of Kaidou's past and personality, he does come off as an edgy emo in this chapter but it could also be something like just him being very confident of his strength and testing his limits in extreme ways, maybe he's just a brute and not really a tragic character.</br></br>  <br>I don't think kaidou has any interest in kid alliances. He will just leave unless kid is stupid enough to attack him.</br>  Mangastream translation is out.  <br>Put One Piece in the OP, you dumb fuck.</br>  <br> no One Piece in the topic <br>chapter release day cancer everyone</br></br>  <br><br> MS: Are you ready to become the princess? <br><br>Yeah Panda fucked up as usual.</br></br></br></br>  Niggerstream is out, time to actually know what the fuck was going on.  <br>Finally.</br>  <br>it is a minkwoman</br>  Kaido: I wan to live!  Why doesn't Kaido just provoke the admirals enough to make all 3 come at him at once? Or make one of his henchmen captured to pull a WB 2.0? Or even just walk into the Marine's HQ?  <br>Fuck it, I'm just going to link to the superior thread, even if no one is going to use it anyway:<br/></br>  MANGASTREAM IS OUT  <br>how many years has it been since he was mentioned holy shit im so happy we're finally getting somewhere</br>  <br><br>But that's pretty much what he's planning to do anon. The biggest war of the century which will probably include the marines and pirates going at him.</br></br>  Sounds like something else has happened after they had escaped from big mom ship.  So did issho intend to not go after the strawhats or what  <br>I'd say Blackbeard may have something more to him as well. Just look at him as a kid.</br>  <br> IF THEY DIE BECAUSE OF YOU I'LL STICK MY FOOT SO FAR UP MY... <br><br>Niggastream does it again.</br></br></br>  <br> people always said <br>nigger i thought whitebeard was the strongest</br></br>  <br>Kaidou has a huge scar on his chest. If he can't be hurt, who did that? Probably Shanks or WB. It says a lot of Shanks who managed to fight him and still make it to Mariejois</br>  <br>he cant be killed not hurt</br>  <br> implying Kaido didn't just spare him because something something honorable warrior something </br>  <br> was expecting Enel <br> Got kaido instead </br></br>  <br>Who knows, I thought he had incredible luck and some fucking endurance at that. Maybe someone like Luffy who has just as much luck.</br>  I thought WB was the strongest.  <br>Urouge was bandaged to fuck, so he likely fought him.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for his revel for like 12 years.</br>  <br><br>And he's dead.</br></br>  I don't have the slightest clue what happens in this chapter. If I didn't know better I'd say they skipped a chapter.  So does Kaidou actually fight things, or is he really just trying to die?  <br>Strongest creature.</br>  <br>Strongest man.<br>Kaido is probably not a man anymore, he may have a DNA fruit or whatever.</br></br>   the try to skewer him and the spears broke <br>Roger BTFO</br>  <br>Well sanji situation was offpanel.</br>  So Shanks made quik work of Kaidou while Kaidou could do nothing but just sit there, unharmed.<br><br>Yonkou rankings<br><br>BB &gt; Shanks &gt; Kaidou &gt; Big Mom</br></br></br></br>   Kaidou is a beast <br> Luffy has been fighting beasts for 2 years </br>  <br><br>Roger used spears?</br></br>  <br>I'm holding out hope we get Treasure Island end and he is this series' Long John Silvers.</br>  If Kaido has a fruit why doesn't he just drown himself<br>On a second thought,even if he hasn't a fruit.</br>  <br>They messed up on the 2nd to the last page's last panel, switching up the dialogue in a speech bubble with a text box. Geez.</br>  <br>His executioners did.</br>  <br><br>Yeah but Roger was still a 'man' I guess.</br></br>    Have we seen these "Mammoth prison ships" ?  What's up with this shit chapter?<br>Did I miss the chapter before?</br>  Devil fruits still work when in the water, right? You just can't control it. Is it the same for seastone?  <br>You're more likely to die hitting solid ground than the ocean. Plus its probably hard to tell if its sea/land below you from 10kms high.</br>  <br>fish would probably throw him back on land or something<br>dont want none of that</br></br>  <br>Glad I am not the only one who noticed that.</br>  what the fuck is this nigger stream  <br>KAIDO OUT OF FUCKING NOWHERE<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>NOWHERE</br></br></br></br></br>   Finally thing are happening:the chapter   <br>He would drown,unless he has magic lungs he shouldn't survive</br>  what happened with the sanji and the rest? I was too distracted by kaido to comprehend  <br>im liking choppers new attitude<br>maybe something happened on big MAMS ship</br></br>    <br> every single time <br> when i try to kill myself,this faggot dolphin brings me back to the beach and look sat me with that faggot look </br></br>  <br>I think those are meant for buster call ships.</br>  <br>He's only been the indirect target of the crew for the past two arcs</br>  Fuckin balloons an shit beneath sky island. Gat-dayum, Oda. Beast mode achieved. Balloons.  <br>Knowing then what we know now, just how fucking powerful was that sea king?</br>  <br><br>Not powerful at all since Luffy one-shotted it in Romance Dawn.<br><br>Shanks was just betting his arm and saving Luffy, the sea king wasn't that powerful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>East blue Luffy &gt; Sea King &gt; Shanks &gt; Kaido &gt;Doflamingo<br><br>Gear 4 Luffy confirmed weaker than east blue Luffy</br></br></br>  <br>It's a matter of he couldn't kill it in time and save luffy at the same time, so he cast his arm away. Aren't there instances where the strong guy loses when he wasn't meant to in manga?</br>  <br>When did Shanks ever go to Mariejois?</br>   kaido mad at donfalmingo instead of straw hats <br>will he ever take a break?</br>  <br> Romance Dawn <br> Canon </br></br>  <br><br>I'm referring to the manga.</br></br>  <br>What if he's just a strong motherfucker, like Shanks?</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>A dying man. He probably could have used Haki to keep himself from being executed if he wanted.</br>  <br>He could just make it faint with Haki.<br>Unless,you know,Oda didn't come up with Haki back then.</br></br>  <br>I don't think you understand what it's saying. Like, calling someone a Kaidou is like saying they're really tough, because Kaidou is really tough.</br>  <br>That's what I'm saying anon. Shanks is a fucking beast, the fact he couldn't do both of those things astonishes me. When he clashed with Whitebeard the sky split in two.</br>  <br>that anon maybe want to type Marineford</br>  <br>Looks like that was a mistranslation. It wasn't that everything failed when used on him, it's that he was so strong that everything broke when it hit him, and accidentally destroyed gigantic prison ships.</br>  <br><br>That's true too.</br></br>  <br>Roger likely didn't try and stop the spears from killing him using haki or some shit<br><br>Kaido without Haki can easily stop the spears without trying, since his body is so fucking durable by default</br></br></br>  So Kaidou is planning a Marineford 2.0 just so he can kill himself?  All these doffyfag theories about him pulling Kaido's strings just got disproved, they either simply simply shared the desire to destroy the world or Kaido is the one who talked him into trying to destroy everything.  <br>Did you notice how number 8 is implied on Kaidou's flag? What does it mean?</br>  <br><br>Well that's what I meant - without his haki/strength he's still just a man.<br><br>Whereas Kaidou can't help it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah because he's too retarded to drown in the ocean</br>  <br>but it says if you take him head on, meaning HIM as in kaido.</br>  <br>It's just that he couldn't do all of that and save Luffy. If luffy wasn't there he'd never have lost his arm. But in any case, it's a nice plot point that he lost his arm to bet on the era after whitebeard being Luffy's.</br>  <br> It's just that he couldn't do all of that and save Luffy <br>Yes,he could? Conqueror Haki can extend for hundreds of meters,and select people you don't want to get affected by it,and it's istantaneous. He could just wink and make the sea king faint.</br></br>  <br> World Noble <br> and Warlord <br> and glorified mafia boss <br> gets shit on by some Brazilian kid, an edgy doctor, and their gang of misfit pirate pals <br> never once had to hindsight to say "Oh shit, maybe I should have a backup plan in case my loli fucks up." <br>Kaidou has every right to be mad at Doffy, he just lost a really choice investment because the motherfucker got overconfident.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oda really has some plotholes to fill, we all know he could immediately die if he ate two devil fruits or just drown himself.  Typical release day thread where no one has any reading comprehension  <br>8=eternity</br>  <br>So it's confirmed that Kaidou is stronger than Roger.</br>  <br><br>Well maybe he doesn't want to die like that.</br></br>  <br>Seems like something else happened to them right after escaping from big mom ship.</br>  Im way too late to the party but can someone explain how Sugars power worked in that her being knocked out removes the power but her falling asleep doesn't?  <br>He obviously is looking for a worthy opponent to die in battle instead.</br>  <br>He's so strong that his name is a popular saying. So if you want to call someone really strong, you'd call them a Kaidou. His name is synonymous with strength, that's how tough he is.</br>  Damn, you Oda!<br>After revealing Kaido, Law's inisial plan that involved leting Joker and Kaido fight over Smile looks good, and realy fucked up by Mugivaras. Now Kaido will follow Luffy and Co just to fight.</br>  <br>Number of times he's been defeated. Im betting after Luffy it will be a 9.</br>  can someone post the colour spread that has kaidou and big mum in it? also what chapter was it released in?  So Doffy was pretty much 'marked' as one of Kaidou's men with his coat? We also saw one of the underground brokers with that type of coat talking about some "Jack" guy.  <br>no, you just are not able to form coherent thoughts or you read shitpanda</br>  <br>If they thought the 3 of them were enough to beat Shanks then I think the 3 are confident enough to feel they can at least flee.</br>  <br>8 = H<br>he's a pervert</br></br>  So what the fuck is even happening? Suddenly the strawhats are fighting against some sheep people in the middle of nowhere? What? How did they get there? Where is Luffy? What?  So if Kaidou has only lost 7 times in battle, who do you think beat him? The same person several times? A series of people?  <br>10/10 would love a pervy Yonkou.</br>  <br> mangapanda translation </br>  <br><br>He's OK with dying from falling a great height, I don't think he's looking for a honorable death anon.</br></br>  Is there anyone here who translate Japanese because the RAW is up.  <br>Because it just works like that. Sleeping isnt enough but knocking out is.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br> speedreading </br></br>  Anyone else think Kaidou have Sharingan type eyes since they are being foreshadowed so much?  <br><br>Since Kaido is yelling to joker infront of them, which implies he doesn't know he was defeated yet they will probably tell him about it, he will just say thank you for the information and leave.</br></br>  <br>sleeping is not the same as being unconscious</br>  <br><br>I never said honorable death.</br></br>  <br> niggerstream is somehow better </br>  <br>if his shit is really because of luck/being unlucky then stuff probably happens to prevent him from eating them and from falling into the ocean</br>  <br>If he could, he wouldn't have lost an arm. So her clearly couldn't.</br>  <br>Whitebread, Shanks, Moria, 3 admirals, Sengoku and Garp, and a few others.</br>  okay it really was kaidou<br><br>Best Oda Design ever. It feels nice seeing someone who isn't a joke character<br><br>holy shit how intimidating<br><br>I am assuming he has the hito hito akuma or oni</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was clearly using all of his haki to  repel the water away from himself, allowing him to "swim" even with his  devil fruit </br>  <br>There was a curfew on Dressrosa you know.</br>  <br>It is. I'll take dialect issues over shitty translations for $500, Jim.</br>   chapter 800 isn't the kaidou reveal <br><br>it's going to be huge</br></br>  <br>He doesn't die so good</br>  <br>Fruits still work when you're in the water, he'd be pushed ashore by a wave. Don't know about the fruit though, just some luck stops him from eating them?</br>  I like how you can look at Kaidou and see exactly why Doflamingo would shit his pants and why Law was like "haha you going be Kaidou's bitch now!"  <br>It's oni oni no mi<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mDR<wbr>u3mIX5bI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>This video explains it better than I can.<br><br>and he made another one after today's chapter: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ukK<wbr>n3jqE8uM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  the hole in the ground kind of gave it away, but still...<br><br>MOTHERFUCKING<br><br>KAIDO<br><br>FUCK YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying it isn't </br>  So,Kaido confirmed as Genghis Khan?I was sure he was going to be Napoleon   Rebecca's face when she found out she's going to become a queen <br><br>inb4 she runs off with the SH's to see the world first</br></br>  <br>Doesnt still explain where the strawhats are and why are they fighting sheep guy and protecting some furry chick.</br>  <br>slightly cleaner shit is still shit<br><br>I miss Powermanga</br></br></br>  Guys, what if Kaido is the strongest being ever? I mean, he's considered the strongest "creature"; humans are technically also creatures so out of everything he may be strongest. WB being the "strongest man" may have been a lesser ranking.<br><br>He fought WB by the look of it. I wouldn't be surprised if he asked WB to unleash upon him and see if it'd kill him, only to do not much harm at all since he can't die. <br><br>Also, does it seem like to anyone else that he still hasn't realised Doflamingo is defeated? He was already up in the clouds when his subordinates were yelling out to him weren't they?</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah thats why he just jumped off of a sky island to try and kill himself</br>  <br>And he's into bestiality with hundred kinds of animals! What a huge pervert!</br>  <br> BIG MOM  fully revealed.</br>   they chained hakuba up <br>lel</br>  So who is apart of Kaidou's 7 defeats?<br><br>Whitebeard and Roger seem like no brainers<br>Shanks <br><br>Do you think he could have lost to Moria once?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's why he tried killing himself by falling from the sky</br>  <br><br> they escaped from Big Mom offscreen (Sanji and Caesar talk about this) <br> they are now fighting Kaidou's subordinates who are after Momo and some furry chick (you even see Kaidou's fucking flag), on Zou. <br><br>Fuck off speedreader.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kaido is pissed that WB died in the battlefield while him epic failing to die.<br><br>idk if i should laugh or cry.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Guys, what if Kaido is the strongest being ever? I mean, he's considered the strongest "creature"; humans are technically also creatures so out of everything he may be strongest. <br>we already knew this</br></br>  Kaido didn't try to kill Whitebeard<br><br>He wanted to die with him</br></br>  <br>He looks like Oars/Oz and even the jolly roger on his crewmembers looks similar to that of oars jr.</br>  <br> Do you think he could have lost to Moria once? <br>Do you have any reading comprehension or nah?</br></br>   post yfw something is finally happening   poor Kidd and the others. They are some unlucky motherfuckers.  <br>I think that's possible, considering Moria supposedly was able to match him evenly in the past.</br>    <br>The more cartoony you are, the stronger you are. Early luffy was full on oldschool cartoon character. Then he lost his power and turned into shounen protagonist. <br>Becoming gear gorilla is him getting his power level back.</br></br>  <br>Yes slowpoke, the point of calling Kaido the strongest creature was to elevate him over all beings, especially humans.</br>  <br>Do you? Moria was said to be his equal and he this panel said he lost 7 times<br><br>He could have easily lost once to moria and then fought him again destroying all of Moria's crew in a second battle.</br></br></br>  <br>Garp and or Sengoku<br><br>Maybe Mihawk, he had to get that Gorilla Island somehow</br></br></br>  <br>Moria got so buttblasted he became a fat NEET</br>  <br>do you think she shaves?</br>  Is Caesar just an honorary crewmember at this point?  <br> Also, does it seem like to anyone else that he still hasn't realised Doflamingo is defeated? He was already up in the clouds when his subordinates were yelling out to him weren't they? <br><br>Actually this is a good point. There was already a theory that Doflamingo was supplying Skypiea with weapons, so what if Kaidou's reason for being angry is that he learned of Doflamingo stoking the fighting up there? He obvious didn't just go up there to run to the edge and jump off since Urouge seemed like he'd been speaking with him.<br><br>Kaidou is such a wildcard character right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean people always put WB above him saying that man &gt; creature. The way I see it, creature includes man and therefore Kaido &gt; Whitebeard</br></br>   yfw the final war of One Piece is started by a guy so retarded he doesn't realize he can drown   <br>we already knew this</br>  <br> &gt;He could have easily lost once to moria and then fought him again destroying all of Moria's crew in a second battle. <br> Moriah defeated Kaidou <br>Fuck off with your headcanon, not even current luffy could do anything against an immortal who seems to be capable of fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy?</br>  <br>please be bait</br>   Kaido made the most powerful army in the world to defeat himself <br> still isn't enough </br>  <br>no one put Whitebeard above him, and everyone put creature &gt; man, because everyone already knew that 'creature' included humans. That's why you are a slowpoke. You are literally saying things that we figured out since Kaido was first talked about, aka, 2 years ago.</br>  The whole Curly team is looking fly. Great to see them all again, good character moments for all of them.<br><br>Kaido was obviously turned immortal by the previous ope ope owner somehow at Whitebeard's behest.<br><br>Sheepshead-sama seems pretty bro. <br><br>Not sure what they meant about the samurai, Sheepshead had a sword which he never used, maybe he has some weird trance induced mode similar to Cavendish where he becomes a Samurai. Or maybe not and they were just referring to the guy Kin'emon is still looking for.<br><br>Did the strawhats flee from big mom's crew or were they distracted away by some girl like brook says.<br><br>I really like the design of this island and how it floods ever so often, wreaking DF users. And the design of Baron Terminal with all the balloons. <br><br>Great stuff so far. If Dressrosa was similar to Alabasta, I hope Zou is similar to Skypeia</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> head canon <br><br><br>Fit Moria was a beast</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido is so strong that not even Kaido, the world's strongest thing in existence can kill him.</br>  <br>yeah good point. He should probably try drowning himself</br>  how the fuck did they get away from big mom  <br>Except every mention I've seen of that comparison had people placing man over creature, saying that it meant lesser beings than humans.</br>  What's all the special traditional powers of an oni?  <br>The timeskip gave the crew the magical power of ass pull.<br><br>And don't forget that the ship can fly short distances.</br></br></br>  Hancock could probably kill him anyway  Best part of the chapter was that Brook has his old hat back  <br>Devil fruits works in the water, you just can't control them.</br>  <br>He talked to himself. Maybe he didn't see these 'bugs' or he is just ignoring them.</br>  <br>they swooced right in<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ggh<wbr>BcjgOdd0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>then you're listening to retards who don't understand basic concepts.</br>  <br><br>Prior to this chapter I for sure thought man was over beast but this epitaph seems to make it clear that Kaidou is over everything</br></br>  <br> Sheepshead-sama seems pretty bro. <br>He's just another Kaidou jobber, nothing special son. I'm more interested in that kitsune-girl and the possible yonkou slave ring scheme.</br></br>  <br>I just pray for them he chooses not to pick a fight. I highly doubt that would be shown to us though, Oda will probably reveal Kaido's fighting powers in a match with Luffy or some shit</br>  <br>whitebeard is not a living creature you know</br>  <br>why would chpt 800 be anything special?</br>  <br> You're more likely to die hitting solid ground than the ocean. <br>How does surface tension work?</br></br>  <br>Oh, I just got it. I guess they're exchanging the word for 'beast' with 'Kaidou'. So you're a Kaidou (beast) if you can take on Kaidou (the hundred beast) on one-on-one.</br>  <br>IT'S<br><br>SHIRO<br><br>HIGE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't kill Urouge,he won't kill any of them,even if they get a beating it will be nothing serious.</br>  <br>So he's a kaidou? So there are more than one? Maybe that's why he is called hundred beast Kaidou: His fruit makes more of himself.</br>  <br> living <br>Not anymore.<br><br>But yeah, humans ARE creatures. But there's a difference here. The strongest man, as in human, is different from the strongest creature.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he's "Kaido of the Beasts" because eating multiple devil fruits isn't enough to kill him and he's piled a bunch of Zoans on himself?</br>  <br>I can't believe people in OP threads need this to be flat out explained</br>  <br>I'm not sure if drowning is intrinsically any more lethal than falling through an island at terminal velocity. And like all things in One Piece, it's supposed to be a funny recurring joke so who cares.</br>  <br>Equal does in no way suggest that Moria ever defeated Kaidou.<br>It's like Shanks and Mihawk nothing suggests that one of them ever defeated the other.<br>Moria independently from that comment saying that he lost to Kaidou is the only thing that matters and implys heavily that he did at no point in his life before encountered and defeated him. Also it's the rumour of some filthy pirates.<br>You really have no coherent reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw Luffy can eat multiple fruits because he's made of rubber and exploding doesn't kill him </br>  <br> 1:20 <br>Lost it everytime.</br></br>  <br>I think it means that Kaido is so strong that sometimes people refer to strong people as "a total Kaido, dude." It's just worded terribly.</br>   Kaidou is pissed about Doflamingo fueling wars on Skypiea <br> Vows to kill him <br> Marines have captured him <br> Kaidou storms the new Marineford to rescue Doflamingo so he can pull his skinny white fuccboi head off himself <br><br><br> Maybe that's why he is called hundred beast Kaidou <br>He has horns, his left arm looks scaled, there's definitely something up with his hair, and his eyes are probably narrow like a cat/lion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> On top of their immense strength and appetite, some oni are also said to shapeshift or to fly at will, allowing them to traverse great distances quickly. <br> Shinto priests, monks, and sorcerors typically had little to fear from oni, as holy magic and the power of deities either drove them away, defended against their attacks, or weakened them considerably. The Japanese do have a ceremony called Oni-Yarabi, which was designed to cleanse an infected area of the Oni demons. Shoki was the main person that they called on to ward them off. <br> In some stories it is implied that kitsune and oni do not get along. Like the Phoenix and Dragon they would appear to be foils to each other in many ways and tend to clash from time to time. <br><br>This works decently to me. It would explain how Kaido got 10kms in the sky, why the priest Urogue didn't fear him, as well as the reaction we got from Kinemon from hearing Kaido's name.<br><br>There are also stories in relation to Oni and Samurai, which would directly relate to the possibilities of Kaido being at Wano/taking over, as well as why he wants Momonosuke<br><br>http://www.monstropedia.org/index.p<wbr>hp?title=Oni</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it wouldnt even have to be explained if oda just told us that hes the strongest, period.</br>  <br>Kaidou has been defeated 7 times, but defeated in what?<br>Knowing Oda he may have lost 7 matches of mahjong</br></br>  <br>Are you for real right now?</br>  <br>Was, Kaido said it himself.</br>  <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br><br>Consider the fact that he's called the strongest in the land, sky, and sea (he's even the strongest creature amongst those that swim, and we've seen Luffy resist the weakening effects of the sea for some of his attacks), that he's called the Hundred Beast, that he apparently can't die no matter what he does (the obvious suicide methods being jumping into the water and eating another devil fruit, of which he has a steady supply of from Joker), and that we have one other instance in the story where someone has survived eating more than one Devil Fruit (Blackbeard), I think the "Hundred Beast" name is pretty literal.<br><br>Personally, I like the theory of Kaidou's DF (at least his main DF) being some sort of fish with whiskers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it was buggy 7 times in a row</br>  I kind of can see Kaidou receiving a slice from the strongest sword and strongest swordman and feeling nothing, but still can't see Mihawk losing.  <br>Unless Kaido has gills it should be lethal regardless of the endurance and strenght of the individual,not to mention he could eat a devil fruit to weaken himself further</br>  <br>Shanks used a trick against Kaido you asshole. There wasn't any fight between the two, Shanks easily calmed him down with words.</br>  I loved the shot of the fighters asleep in that room with Baby 5 leaning on Sai's leg and Hakuba in chains.  BRAVO<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>D<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or it could be like Whitebeard and Rogers being equal.<br><br>You have no idea which one it is. Neither do I which I why I questioned could Moria have been one of his defeats. Pretending it's impossible for him to lose to a supposed equal is stupid. There had to be something that happened that people would say that.<br><br>Moria getting pummeled by Kaidou wouldn't lead to them saying he was an equal. <br><br><br>pretty much confirmed oni.<br><br>Shapeshifting would give you the 100 beasts he can turn into and his moniker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think what he means is that if they were considered as equals, and we know for a fact that Moriah was beaten by Kaido in the end, that perhaps Moriah might have beaten Kaido once. <br>One win each would make them equals.</br></br>  <br>I totally want chopper to be the main center of this arc. <br>find his waifu and earn kaidous respect or something somehow.</br></br>  <br>Eh, we've seen a few pages of him so far so he very well might have gills or -much more likely- just be so supernaturally tough that he really just can't manage to off himself no matter how impossible it might seem. It would be pretty funny to see a flashback of the dude sitting on the ocean floor for days but being unable to drown just because.</br>  <br>Yeah, they're intentionally fucking up by now.</br>  Reminder for you fags of what Kaido's voice is.<br>It is quite matching of his appearance.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xM5<wbr>lkcldRsU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Rip in pieces Hundred Beasts Kaido. ;__;<br><br> yfw Kaidou's last words will be something like this, Straw Hat, thank's to you I'm finally able to die! I'm glad I met you. </br></br></br>  <br>Nothing new on the Earth. Panda is autistic and Stream is nigga street.</br>  <br>How far do you have to fall to reach terminal velocity? Im pretty sure its far far less than 10 km.</br>  <br>Ever heard a passenger say to a wild, speeding driver 'slow down Fangio'? Do you think the driver is literally Fangio? Because that's what you're saying here.</br>  Kaidou can't be an Oni, he has the luck fruit.  <br>YOU KNOW WHAT, I COULD SEE THIS HAPPENING RATHER THAN WHAT I SAID EARLIER BECAUSE ODA</br>  <br>So no incest aftrer all.</br>  <br> Pretending it's impossible for him to lose to a supposed equal is stupid. <br>Are you mentally challenged?<br><br> Moria getting pummeled by Kaidou wouldn't lead to them saying he was an equal.  <br> what is a rumour <br>Look it up, moria himself never said that he was as strong as kaidou ones or that it was a pretty even fight. He suggested that it was pretty one-sided. And now we know why.<br><br><br>Are you suggesting that moria defeated kaidou and the next time they fought kaidou all alone killed every member of moria's crew except him? Does that make any sense? An actual equal would not get raped like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  kaido holy fuck. basil hawkins is shitting himself  <br><br>Obviously it means that Kaidou is so famous his name is being used as a verb for fighting spirit or something.</br></br>  <br>He was given immortality from the ope ope no mi.<br>Whitebeard had something to do with it which is why Kaido curses him.</br></br>  <br> inb4 "I want you to see the world before that, go with the Strawhats!" <br>Realistically what kind of role would she play in the crew?</br></br>   all your faces when moria comes back stronger than ever in Kaidou saga   <br>Or that it's been swapped out with the word 'beast', which is more intuitive.</br>  <br>Wel it was mainly Moriah's crew that got slaughtered; we have no idea how badly beaten he was himself. He may have gone into some depressed state like Luffy did at Marineford after losing his crew for all we know.</br>   monkey statues are thought to guard against the oni <br> monkey <br><br><br>is this some pottery<br><br><br>How does it not make sense? Crocodile beat luffy twice but if luffy fought him again even 6 months later he would have beaten everyone in alabasta<br><br>Power spikes don't take long in one piece</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did the other strawhats escape big mum, and get to Zou in the short time that we've been on Dressrosa?  <br><br>I think that too but why would you take him one on one if he's a kaidou? why not use the whole crew if he;s that strong?</br></br>  <br>He doesn't really want to die.<br><br>He just does it for fun.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or because Whitebeard died before him.</br></br>  I love how Kaidou's intro nullified the sheer gayness of these threads which have been dominating OP generals since months.  <br> Luffy taking out a yonkou <br> Kaidou of all people <br><br>I don't think that's gonna happen. At least not one-on-one.<br><br>Imagine how hiw reputation and bounty would skyrocket</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who the fuck are they at the top left panel?</br>  <br>Mihawk fans need to stop with this shit of him being stronger than the Yonko or Admirals</br>  <br>Why doesn't he just cut the Earth's shadow?</br>  <br>What if he lost 7 times to Foxy in DBF?</br>   mfw Moria may have had a chance, in the past, of becoming a Yonko <br><br>the poor fucker did not deserve this.<br><br><br>who gives a shit though, Kaido seems baised as fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that shit will happen almost towards the end when the whole current system fall apart</br>  <br>They're in the palace, the only building in Dressrosa that Doflamingo's birdcage didn't destroy</br>  Really glad he didn't look like this in the end.  <br>Whitebeard got the previous owner of Law's Ope-Ope no Mi to perform the immortality ritual on Kaidou, hence why Kaidou says Whitebeard did a number on him right after saying he's still alive. Someone performing the ritual with the fruit was inevitable the instant Doflamingo mentioned it. I'd just never thought someone might have already done it in the past.</br>  <br>This is what a good chapter looks like. It's weird people will settle for defending panels of people cheering when we could get actual chapters of exposition.</br>  <br>Moira was a weak fag, literally weaker than buggy and law</br>  <br>Whoa.<br><br>This is what I miss by speedreading.<br><br>damn</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry but Mihawk lost to Jozu, who lost to Aokiji who lost to Akainu. A lot of people stronger than Mihawk.</br>  <br>It's like what Tom was always saying, "do it with a Don!". But here the Don is replaced with Kaidou and the rest of the text is explaining why it's being used.</br>  <br> of all the pirates out there in one piece <br> Moria ran into the guy that can't die <br><br>No wonder he ran off to the grandline and hid in thriller bark</br></br></br></br>  <br>What does Kaido want with Momonosuke? I knew he was going to be a  big guy  just by his voice when I heard that in the anime too.</br>  <br><br>Because true men look for a proper fight?</br></br>  <br>I am sure mihawk can cut jozu if he uses a diamond cutting technique.</br>  <br>Take his dragon fruit?<br><br>Kaidou is all about zoans it seems</br></br></br>  <br>Kaido is so manly that he scared fujofags to death. His introduction literally saved OP generals.</br>  <br> Mihawk lost to Jozu  <br><br>is this bait?</br></br></br>  <br>That island isn't zou.</br>  <br> *Checks his cards quickly* <br> "Chance of survival: 0%" </br></br>  <br><br>Mihawk didn't lose to Jozu, what the fuck are you on.<br><br>Jozu just blocked his slash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how Kaidou has the same scar as Luffy.</br>  <br>The obvious riposte to that is "he wasn't serious". There's no point in getting into a back-and-forth argument like that.<br><br>Mihawk is supposed to be rivals with Shanks and that Shanks is one of the Yonkou. So, you know, transitive property. Even if Mihawk isn't stronger or exactly as strong as Kaidou, he's likely on the same playing field.</br></br></br>  you mihawkfags really need to start shitting up the thread? For fuck's sake guys.<br><br><br>being Moria is suffering.<br><br>also I hope this guy doesn't overdo it. Kaido may really ignore them after all, if he doesn't get too carried away</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it's not like their ship has a cola powered thruster or anything.</br>  <br> How does it not make sense? Crocodile beat luffy twice but if luffy fought him again even 6 months later he would have beaten everyone in alabasta <br>  <br> Power spikes don't take long in one piece <br>now you're suggesting that kaidou and moria are like croc and luffy only to make your headcanon work. You're suggesting that kaidou was weaker than moria and afterwards stronger throwing away the "equality" that you were arguing on. Do you get it? Nothing you're saying has any relevance considering moria's words.<br><br><br>I don't remember the actual words moriah said, but didn't he directly say that he (we) lost inclusing himself?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shanks was still a newbie back then with nothing but babby's first conqueror's haki</br>  <br>Why would WB do that? And doesn't the fruit only stop you from aging? I thought he commented on how WB died while he has to keep on living.</br>  <br>It means he has a haoshoku haki.</br>  He's making it look like he has a choice, but now that Joker is down he needs to start a war or he's fucked.

I always thought, based off of Age of Empires II's Hundred Years War campaign that Giles would be a Lancer if he wasn't a Caster.</br>  So any new servant pictures?  <br>Well  seems to imply that there's an actual story requiring sprites and things.

Seems like a Nasu sort of thing to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you stupid or do you just not understand the interview in question?<br><br>Heroic spirits can have guns, we already have two that have guns, we've had them for ages. He made a point of making one with guns already to show "See, it can happen, that's not the issue" for people like you that act like that's the issue.<br><br>The issue is that the gun has a hard time being the NP since anyone with training can sue it, and the NP needs a soul.<br><br>Essentially you can be a HS with guns, but you aren't going to become a HS due to feats you preformed with guns, like sharpshooting.<br><br>Billy the Kidd is listed as a heroic spirit in passing in Extra, because he did more than just shoot people, he was famous for more than just that.<br><br>You cannot get in just for shooting a lot of people, you need an actual legend, a legend that isn't derived by just gun feats. Fucking hell we've had heroic spirits that have had guns already and people still act like that's the issue. I could explain what this interview meant to people all day and they would still come back moments later "So guns are impossible then? Man Nasu's a fucking hack, I want my Russian Sniper servant". <br><br>No it doesn't say guns are impossible, but there are certain rules that make it a lot harder. Yet instead of people ever understanding this they just get people to agree with them "Yeah Nasu's a stupid hack" and just spend time doing that.<br><br>We have two servants that use guns already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>please dont tell me you pronounce caesar as "sea-sar"</br>  <br>It's Zhuge Liang(El-Melloi II), not sure what it means</br>  <br>I'm not sure, there are so many sabers in this game.<br><br>I think it's the left one.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ anon it's not like I called your mother a whore or anything.</br>  <br>Simo Häyhä should be a Servant. I'll keep calling Nasu a hack until he makes him one.</br>  <br>So can anyone connect to the game yet</br>  <br><br>atilla</br></br>    <br>To clarify it for the hundreth time<br><br>Reasons why its hard for a gun to be an NP, or a servant who uses a gun to be a servant. Not to say that its impossible, because that's not the case.<br><br>1) Its something anyone can learn with training, and the entire point of a hero is sort of "The one and only". The gun is the one credited for the importance anyway, since anyone can make it to that level with training<br>2) People don't think guns are super magical forged by faeries, they think they're just technology. Its harder to have legends about them<br>3)They're mass produced technology, a gun would have to be "The one and only" to even qualify in some ways.<br>4) You can't become a heroic spirit for gun related feats, since its still something anyone could do with enough training. You need to have been famous for other things.<br>5) An NP needs to have a soul, it must have a spirit in a sense, be alive. Not in the most literal sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  StrangeFake Saber will be in this game or not because it will be a spoiler for LN?  <br>Type Moon threads are serious business</br>  Fuck swords let's use guns instead. Lancelot did it before it was cool.  <br>This should be Nero's real appearance. Unlike that fatty, Caesar WAS a fucking general who battled.</br>  <br>What are they saying?</br>  <br>Is Sakura Saber in FGO?</br>  <br> 1) Its something anyone can learn with training, and the entire point of a hero is sort of "The one and only". The gun is the one credited for the importance anyway, since anyone can make it to that level with training <br>Same with spears, swords and bows.<br> 2) People don't think guns are super magical forged by faeries, they think they're just technology. Its harder to have legends about them  <br>People don't generally do this for melee weapons either.<br> 3)They're mass produced technology, a gun would have to be "The one and only" to even qualify in some ways. <br>Melee weapons also get mass produce. Unique guns exist just like unique melee weapons exist.<br> 4) You can't become a heroic spirit for gun related feats, since its still something anyone could do with enough training. You need to have been famous for other things. <br>Same thing also goes for melee weapons.<br> 5) An NP needs to have a soul, it must have a spirit in a sense, be alive. Not in the most literal sense. <br>So have a gun with a soul.

I need thug life saber in this.</br>  <br>I think that guy is the Indian dude who managed to push Alex's army back seeing he has an elephant. Plus he was a fighter compared to Darius who run away in battle.</br>  The majority if my favorite characters are from Apocrypha and Strange fake so I guess I'm going to be waiting a very long time to see any of them, huh. <br>I'm excited to see what the outcome of Arjuna vs Karna will be like.</br>  <br>Sieg and Janne already in the game.</br>  <br>I'm aware Jeanne is in there considering she's the poster girl and all but I didn't think Sieg would be in it? Is there a picture or servant card of him somewhere?</br>  <br>Considering GO is a reboot of the original Apocrypha game project, we'll probably see a lot of the Apocrypha Servants, especially when most of the ones that were cut when it was made into a novel series are in GO, plus Siegfried and Jeanne are already in, and so is Vlad, but as a Berserker. I'm expecting Mordred and Karna very quickly, at least.</br>  <br>Karma is 100% happening since the new archer is his rival from legends</br>  this look like a poor version of chain chronicles  <br>He was in the trailer.</br>  So, is it on another maintenance or it's region locked.  <br>it says server maintenance when you open the app</br>  <br>I'm still getting the maintenance message, so it's that. I've never seen a region locked mobage anyway, although some probably exist. Usually only the app stores are region locked, not the apps themselves.</br>  I don't know moon but I'll give this a try just for Red Saber.  <br>Wasn't shirohime quest region locked ?<br>The game have additional "quest" and "objective" based on your real life location, so you really must be in japan.</br></br>  google play store region lock is easy to bypass from the browser console, takes like 20 secs<br><br>probably shouldn't spread this info though since google may fix it</br></br>  <br>Or you could just use qooapp. Really it's simple to download and install</br>  <br> using shady chinese services <br><br>No thank you</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I guess that's a form of region locking, but as far as I can tell it's still totally possible to play the game in other countries. You just can't do those quests. The game itself doesn't lock foreign players out automatically or anything.</br>  <br>I'd never trust chinkshit. At least with Google, they already know everything about you.<br><br>And 20 seconds is not a long time.</br></br></br>  I just want Jean but I know I won't get one ;_;  <br>If other mobage are any indication, prepare to reroll A LOT for the change at any of the 5*, let alone a specific one.</br>  <br>Well I did create three accounts for the free Saber, so If I don't get anything good in the three of them I might reroll.</br>    <br>only way I know how to do it is use a vpn, and I'm not paying for a vpn just to play this game</br>  <br/>  I saw this apk on a Type-Moon forum. I installed it and seems legit, although the game is in maintenance. <br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!VQBlCKZZ!9nm7H<wbr>iAt0gtokVcC2M5OwxruAKF5RQ3PQxBLQXHQ<wbr>oI0</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> paying for a vpn <br><br>Just use OpenVPN on your computer to open the google play page and add the game to your account.</br></br></br>  How's the game like?<br><br>And do they plan on translating it or will the fans have to do all the work as usual?</br></br>  <br>If you install the game like this be aware that it will not update, and I can assure you there will be updates that are required to play the game. Possibly as soon as whenever it finally comes out of this maintenance.</br>  <br>Uh really? Ugh, I guess vpn it is</br>  <br>Is there a lock on which device can run the game? Can't install on my nexus 7</br>  <br>Yeah, just downloaded my own version from the play store using a vpn from vpngate.net</br>  <br> free VPN <br>If their service was even passably good they'd charge money for it.</br></br>  <br>2012 n7? this game requires 2gb ram</br>  <br>Can't install from play store or cannot install from apk you've downloaded?</br>  <br>OpenVPN is a protocol, not a service.</br>  <br>1. it doesn't need to be good, I imagine you only need to have to click 2 buttons with it on<br>2.  free vpns are usually botnets, in the serious sense of the word, not the /g/ meme </br></br>  <br>I have a nexus 7 and it downloaded perfectly fine from qooapp</br>  <br><br>Guns came into a time where science starts winning over superstition and myths is all. People's reactions and how their mind interprets such legendary feats change. What is amazing becomes more quantifiable. People find more logical explanations. They can see and test the limits of what's possible through science.<br><br>When something is a symbol of an era that is anti-thesis to myths and magic, it's that much harder for it to become myth itself. It has to be just that much more blatantly magical compared to the time period as time goes on.<br><br>Either way, the user matters a bit more if they have legends beyond their use of the gun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128791120 <br>Story mode?</br>  <br><br><br><br>2013.

That's probably the key factor.</br>    <br>Aniplex.<br><br>Hope is dead.</br></br></br>  Is the soundtrack any good?  I'm going to uninstall this game so fast if Shielder really does end up being Matthew. It doesn't help that nips don't know how to write Catholic characters either so we're probably going to get the weirdest fucking lore out of shielder if she IS Matthew.  <br>X curry barrrrr<br><br>Merllirion asser</br></br></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint<wbr>_Barbara<br> According to the hagiographies, Barbara, the daughter of a rich pagan named Dioscorus, was carefully guarded by her father who kept her locked up in a tower in order to preserve her from the outside world. Having secretly become a Christian, she rejected an offer of marriage that she received through him. <br><br> Before going on a journey, he commanded that a private bath-house be erected for her use near her dwelling, and during his absence, Barbara had three windows put in it, as a symbol of the Holy Trinity, instead of the two originally intended. When her father returned, she acknowledged herself to be a Christian; upon this he drew his sword to kill her, but her prayers created an opening in the tower wall and she was miraculously transported to a mountain gorge, where two shepherds watched their flocks. Dioscorus, in pursuit of his daughter, was rebuffed by the first shepherd, but the second betrayed her and was turned to stone and his flock changed to locusts. <br><br> Dragged before the prefect of the province, Martinianus, who had her cruelly tortured, Barbara held true to her faith. During the night, the dark prison was bathed in light and new miracles occurred. Every morning her wounds were healed. Torches that were to be used to burn her went out as soon as they came near her. Finally she was condemned to death by beheading. Her father himself carried out the death-sentence. However, as punishment for this, he was struck by lightning on the way home and his body was consumed by flame. Barbara was buried by a Christian, Valentinus, and her tomb became the site of miracles. <br><br>She'll make a good Servant with some tweaks (one of her symbols is a cannon).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>How about that CCC?</br>  <br>Actually aren't Aniplex bros? They've done a lot to promote UBW outside of Japan.</br>  <br>She's the patron saint of artillerymen, so she can be an Archer and a Caster I suppose. She's also a virgin for waifufags.</br>  <br>CCC came out in Japan 2 years after the Vita came out</br>  <br>Why wouldn't they, those asshole price gouge the shit out of their products. Gonna be spending triple digits on a single season of UBW, if Zero is any indication. They won't touch Grand Order stateside unless they can charge for it up front, or do some super heinous cash shop nonsense. It's all about the money for Aniplex, nothing else matters.</br>  When did this come out?  <br>She would be best girl so quickly but you know they would strip her of any potential elegance she could possibly have and make her design cum dump tier.</br>  <br>Point being though is they actually do put the products out there.

But I hope he doesn't get too edgy.</br>  <br>This is a chuuni show. It will get edgy.</br>  Are you sure that's not MC's lost brother who also Nao's benefactor?  <br>Bane?</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  When do they fuck?  <br>Maybe?<br><br>Stop. It's Nao.

I wonder if they baited Nao's bro to come out into the open and get himself fucked over like so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we can confirm that the MC got his memories modified in some way. <br>How can you even confirmed something based on speculation?</br></br>  <br>We know what's probably coming, yet we're still watching it. Of course we're going to defend it.</br>  <br>There´s a 4koma?

I didn't mean to quote the second thing. Phones suck.</br>  <br>Because you need to wait until a fucking EPISODE to confirmed it, first faggot.<br><br>Do you fuck brain even got any ideas what CONFIRMATION is? Just get raped by a nigger already.</br></br></br>  <br>Good god, they're not  saving that for some untwist are they? <br><br> &gt;Surprise bitches I'm alive<br>Why. I love speedbro but I like my characters to stay dead.</br> </br></br></br>  <br>Not this shit again. I don't need to be reminded that the show will become bad. I just want to enjoy the show while it still has momentum.</br>  <br><br>I came here expecting good discussion and hoping the BR google translate shitter would be asleep but looks like he's still awake and not banned yet.<br><br>Time to exit the thread and be sad about the state of these threads. Anime original series are supposed to have good discussion and speculation, not people taking random "spoilers" as facts and retards shitposting everywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I need bleach.</br>  <br> Stop making analysis of things given to us by the creators on a board that discusses episodes and theories as they come out </br>  <br>He caught me off guard!</br>  <br>Why is Charlotte so soft?</br>   tfw we'll never see this in the show   slightly bigger  The pizza sauce is the favorite: boy who appears in the dream<br>It is not the favorite: MC</br>  <br> another asshole commenting about side jokes and not contributing to the main topic at hand <br>/a/ isn't dead, just dying</br></br>  <br>Wait, who touched Nao? Is that you, Yuu?</br>  <br>Purple shirt alley dude did in episode 3</br>    <br>Dying? More like in intensive care.<br>Haven't been able to have good discussion here in ages with people like the BR idiot being allowed to shitpost freely.</br></br>  <br>Like you caught me? Seriously, what was that even about, Nao? Did you just want a hug?</br>  <br>Getting decked in the face doesn't count.</br>  Your face when the pizza sauce is imouto's power.  <br>Is that the face that Nao makes when she's hungry? Did you guys forget to feed her in between episodes?</br>  <br>Just filter him out.</br>  Zhiend  So Tomori is confirmed to win the MCbowl?  <br> Power is that she can make Pizza sauce out of nowhere but it only works with Pizza sauce <br><br>Sounds perfect and defective as all the other powers</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I think it's better if we don't have a cheesy festival episode inn Charlotte and rather focus on the main plot for the second half.</br>  <br>No. I need my beach episode.</br>  <br>Ignoring the cancer wont make it go away, it only makes it worse.</br>  help  <br>True. After episode 5 there won't really be anymore time.<br><br> I honestly just like the getup. </br></br></br>  <br>I think the guy in the lower right is either Yuu himself or his brother.</br>  <br><br>We don't need people pretending to be characters from the show yet. Please let the rest of us enjoy the show and characters before the role playing starts.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Heroin Key deredere</br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone happen to have that edit of Nao lifting her leg up and it showing her panties? I believe it was an edit.  <br>Sure thing buddy. Just like that other albino "won" the MCbowl in Angel Beats.</br>  <br>Aww cmon it´s fun. Also we don´t really have a lot to discuss yet. Not enough info.</br>  <br>Save it for the ova. Nao better not try to skip out with a shorts and sweater get up  not that it would look bad </br>  <br>So it's like strong teasing but nothing concrete comes out of it?  I'm new to this formula. </br>  <br> Aww cmon <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Ok... Just keep it to this thread for nao...</br>  <br> albino <br>Are you talking about Tenshi?<br>She did win. She was just too autistic to express her feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>I just wanted a sniff.</br>  <br>Only tears will come out of this series.</br>  <br><br>I hope it's not like that bullshit. My kokoro needs closure.</br></br>  <br>It's Maeda. He will pull a happy ending out of his ass if he has to.</br>  <br>She´s probably gonna die in his arms telling him she loves him or something. Prepare for suffering.</br>  <br>Fuck man. Don't you ever go to sleep? Do you just get on /a/ catalog and control+f "Charlotte?"</br>  <br>I doubt Nao's gonna bite it, but broken? I'm sure that's fair game.</br>  <br>What if MC and imouto aren't real siblings? Fake brother made MC believe imouto was his real sister to hide her from evil organization?</br>  <br><br>DON'T FUCK WITH MY HEART /A/. YOU TOLD ME PLASTIC MEMORIES WOULD HAVE AN ASSPULL. I'm not believing anything and staying simple minded.</br></br>  <br> implying its one person </br>  <br>That's actually plausible...</br>  <br>Maybe she´ll end up like her brother. Which i hope won´t happen. But there´s gonna be some sort of suffering.</br>  <br>Literally just thought of that. Fucking kill me.<br><br>Now that'd be touching, but basically that means that plan is going to go to hell.</br></br></br>  Please don't take Nao away from this world... We haven't even seen up her skirt yet  <br>Analysis is okay, you faggot. I never said it was bad, but that was only SPECULATION, you can't just spout IT WAS CONFIRMED like a faggot you are.<br><br>Just kill yourself already.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we should take her away faster then.</br>  <br>How autistic can you get?</br>  <br>Why /a/non, why ;_;</br>  <br>Yea, the thing is. I only put robotnik to MC to symbolize how self insert /a/ toward this MC. Other than MC, then you can safely say it wasn't me.</br>  <br> I'm an entitled piece of shit <br>Yes you are</br></br>  <br>To protect her dignity, you blubbering dog.</br>  <br>At least that guy knows he's wrong in this case. It was his added "faggot", "did you even watch..", "just kill yourself" that add my autism fuel.<br><br><br>Like that. What a mentality of a loser.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her dignity didn't stop her from whoring herself to benefactor kun.</br>   The uploader has not made this video available in your country. <br>shiet.<br>HD preview where?

Holy fuck, that was a great ending.<br><br> anime never </br></br>  <br> people from the west are sending fanart of Kazuki and Maria getting married to the author <br>Kek. He seems very bewildered.</br></br>  <br> no official art of their marriage <br><br>One fucking job.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone should give Ukai Saki a call.

I mean the series is completed and it was never popular to begin with. Even if it was adapted, chances are it would be extensively rewritten or censored.</br></br>  It felt short and defeating O was strange. Otherwise it was pretty good.  <br>Apparently it was the longest volume yet, according to Eusth. I agree that it felt shorter than the preceding volumes, though. O's defeat was okay to me, I like how it went down, it felt like a logical conclusion the way Maria's box was ultimately self-defeating.</br>  I wanna fuck Kazombie in the ass.  I want to fuck Mogi until she can walk again  I want to fuck Kokone in front of Daiya.  <br><br><br> having all this shit taste <br> not wanting to fuck Maria's box in front of her eyes </br></br></br></br>  <br>More Info please ?

How can you say you love her if you can't even commit mass murder for her?</br>  <br>Because, in the words of Kazuki himself, "…Man, it's surprisingly hard to engage in mass murder."</br>  <br>Yeah, i saw that too. ~300 words is the normal while the last volume was ~360 words. I know light novels are supposed to be short but 60 words don't feel too different.</br>  Do they fuck?  <br>60 pages, anon.</br>  <br>No. Confirmed for cuddling together in bed, though.</br>  <br>Mogi's new design was so good</br>  <br> Confirmed for cuddling together in bed <br>Fuck yeah</br></br>  <br>And  hand holding. </br>  <br>Oh.

But Starlight Queens Sakura and Otome along with Tristar Superidol Kaede ending out below DreAcas is downright insulting.</br>  <br>Banrise please go, and burn in hell.</br>  Aikatsu = Saved  <br>Michelle is minor side character, Michiru is minor side character, but Shion was given the position in the main cast, amongst the actual top idols of the academy.<br>After Mizuki left, top stars of the Starlight academy were ever-present Soleil, PowaPuri, and Tristar remnants. The show itself insisted on that.<br>And yet, Banrise decide to push Soleil everywhere, bail out Kaede and Yurika with duets, and give decent relevance even to Otome and Sakura, while actually managing to make all Shion's potential go waste.

Well, I don't think those versions are good either, if you mean this. Bishoujo figure with  nipples  permanently stick to the uninstallable outfit is a bad idea.
