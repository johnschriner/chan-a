Umaru's a sweetie who loves her onii-chan.</br>  <br>Sometimes, hair is so black and shiny that it reflects the sky's color. In animu, given how common black hair is among nips, this reflective quality is used to 'reflect' aspects of a person's character. In the case of a blue haired character, such as  she is carefree like the wind under a blue sky. Grey hair happens for similar reasons, the person is reflecting cloudy skies, which implies various things about their character. <br><br>I have no idea about green hair.</br></br></br>  This looks utterly familiar but I can't quite pinpoint the source of the reference from half of the wallpaper.    <br>Author's cameo</br>  <br>Well green is the color of wind in Japan, so there's that.</br>  <br> Irohasu~ </br>  <br>Disgusting pig sister eats shit and cola and cannot do housework to save her life.

But their balls(ovaries) are inside so, they scratch their bellies.</br></br></br>  <br>It was weird.

When Taihei and Ebina were acting friendly with each other it showed Kirie staring at the two with out saying anything. I thought she was either jealous or wondering what relationship Taihei and Ebina have.</br>  <br>She's just an autist who wants friends.<br>Boss is best girl.

He should be the heir to Doma company or whatever it's called, unless that was just some rumor circulating around the school.</br>  <br> raccoon <br>That's a fucking hamster</br></br>    <br><br>Bomber is not a bright guy</br></br>  <br>I think rather than an heir, he's just an employee for it while his dad runs it. Umaru used to live with their dad until a year or two ago. Their relationship isn't ideal, so the dad hired Alex (Sylphyn's onii-chan) to check up on them. Their mother died a long time ago, so Umaru doesn't remember her and Taihei barely remembers her.<br><br>This is all speculation.</br></br></br>    <br>doesnt explain who hikari is supposed to be though</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br> jump off a bridge.</br>  <br> Crying because you get told off for trying to touch a scolding hot pan <br> 16 years old </br></br>  <br>it was the first time her brother ever yelled</br>  <br>Well  was just asking about parents<br><br>Taihei probably met Hikari a while ago and taught her some stuff. She's the manager's sister, and he and the manager were friends in high school.</br></br></br>  <br>He yelled at her. He wasn't just telling her off, he was yelling at her.<br>If I had that cushy of a life, I'd cry too.</br></br>  <br>the company Taihei currently works for is the one the manager's dad owns though</br>  <br><br> Umaru being brat <br><br>What a surprise</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, well, just change some details in that case.<br><br>Perhaps they have absolutely no relation to any giant company, but Alex calling someone regarding Umaru does make me suspicious.</br></br></br>  I wonder which chapter they'll end it at.  <br><br>All that junk food will maker her shits really bad.</br></br>  <br>I would get angry and tell her to behave like a proper high schooler. It's for her own sake.<br>Spending her time at home living like a NEET is not healthy.</br></br>  <br>what's wrong with that if she's able to properly function in society. she doesn't even function like an average high schooler in public, she goes above and beyond. this is her way of letting out all the stress</br>  <br>But she does behave like a proper high schooler, you retarded tripfuck.<br>Furthermore, Taihei NEEDS Umaru to act like that or else he's got nothing to do or look forward to.</br></br>   norway   Japan pls  <br><br>The football game</br></br>  <br>Shit looks easy as fuck.<br><br>I did that shit in fifth grade.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It is in the manga</br></br>  <br>that made my heart melt when everyone was nice to TSF</br>  <br> football <br><br>i wish non americans would leave 4chan forever</br></br></br>  <br> What is Fred bought yesterday? </br>  <br>I wish non Americans stopped stealing our oxygen.</br>  <br><br>She is such a good girl</br></br>  <br>Join in.</br>  <br><br> Laying on a wooden floor. <br> potato chips out of the reach <br> psp out of the reach <br> cola out of the reach <br> remote out of the reach <br> keyboard out of the reach <br> small mousepad <br> bare legs, no cover <br> really uncomfortable posture to look at the computer screen <br><br>Absolutely Fucking Horrifying</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> football <br>What the fuck? The Nips say soccer though (サッカ)</br></br>  <br>Can totally reach the potato chips with her foot.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was thinking the game, with 83 serving as the epilogue to the episode.</br>  <br> Norway </br>   got to the chapter with Ebina's oniichan <br><br>Shit, they all have oniichans.</br></br>  <br>She does all this like 2 feet away from oniichan so whenever she's cold she just snuggles up with his sleeping body</br>  <br> those eyes <br><br>you're a squid now</br></br></br>  <br><br>No shit Sherlock, too bad that he doesn't care about her</br></br>  <br>Why doesn't she just play games while sitting on onii-chan's lap?</br>  <br><br>Behaving properly outside isn't enough. As a member of a family, Umaru has the duty to behave well at home too in a way that won't bother or worry her only sibling, Taihei. Taihei is a fine man who is often tired from work and who should not have to take care of her sister all the time because of her ill, but redeemable behavior.</br></br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>Oh, right.</br>    <br> her <br>sasuga tripfag<br>Just fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Because last time they did that Umaru got scared of the thing poking her butt. The two never brought it up again.</br>  what the fuck is this anime supposed to be?  <br><br>Imouto(s) and onii-chan(s)</br></br>  <br>Harem but instead of romance Taihei becomes the oniichan of all the girls</br>  What a slut  <br><br>There is nothing lewd about poor Ebina</br></br>  <br>Them ebinas.</br>  Christ.<br><br>Does Ebina need to eat so much because her breasts need energy?</br></br>  <br>In the long run, if your ages don't differ significantly it helps having some close family once your parents die, but otherwise no. <br><br>Financially and emotionally everything would be divided between both of you unevenly, your parents would spend more money on her and spend more time with her and that in turn would lead you to hate her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I prefer Umarus</br></br>  <br><br>She is fatty</br></br>  Guys, who should I pair Taihei with?<br><br>I'm stuck between Manager and Ebina.</br></br>  <br><br>Ebina 's onii-chan </br></br>  <br>Well, those are really his only options.<br><br>I think Manager would be more kosher, but I think he's sort of fond of Ebina despite being, like, ten years older than her.</br></br></br>  <br>His mom, Umaru.</br>  I've never read this shit why is that character so small and weird looking?  <br>Gag manga.</br>  <br>Continue spending my time in bliss on my computer.</br>  <br>Manager. End of story.</br>  <br><br> awawa <br>I fucking love that shit. I hope it gets animated.</br></br></br>  <br>I cry when I get yelled at and I'm 29...</br>  <br><br>That's like every Ebina time</br></br>  The cola scene made me feel physically ill  <br>UMR &gt; umaru &gt;komaru</br>  <br>Onii-san is seducing the whole Ebina family members <br><br> Ebina's parents when? </br></br></br>  DROPPED  <br><br>why is ebina so perfect?</br></br>  <br>me</br>  <br><br>Ebina is just a useless little imouto, only good for her sex appeal</br></br>  <br> complete brat <br> that body  <br><br>my dick is conficted</br></br></br></br>    <br>I can understand why Kirie likes her so much.</br>  <br>Just came here and saw this. Context, please.</br>  <br>But I can't ship my waifu with Taihei.</br>  <br> implying she isn't the miracle of the universe </br>  <br><br>I want more about Sylphy and Alex's mother</br></br>   himouto <br>Is she a hiki imouto, hikikomori imouto, or a hime imouto?</br>  <br><br> This post again <br><br>Himono</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus titty fucking Christ. Did nobody even watch the first episode? It's HIMONO IMOUTO<br><br>HIMONO IMOUTO</br></br></br>  <br><br>I hate it when I can't figure out the name of an anime just by browsing its thread.</br></br>  <br>Hymen Imouto<br><br>You see, she's actually american BUT she's a virgin. An american, little virgin sister! What a twist!</br></br></br>  I just reached this point.<br><br> It was a request to find her bro, right? </br></br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  You think Ebina already knows about Umarus disgusting second life but doesn't say anything cuz they're friends?  <br>It is a Japanese culture thing not really touched in anime or manga. Simply put, think of it as "little sister leading a double life". That's not actually the translation, but it's the meaning. The translation is "dried fish imouto".</br>  <br>No, Ebina is an idiot.</br>  Incest when?  <br>What's with those silly TL notes? Earlier chapters also had pointless notes:<br> 5 yen is about 5 yen </br></br>  <br><br>Ebina would never do that, she has low self-esteem, and she is good girl</br></br>  <br> Overweight, too young, but inviting with a knowing smile <br>I would turn around 360¤ and lock the door behind me.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't that bitch ever have to type? How is just using a mouse good enough?</br>  <br>She's browsing wikis in that picture</br>   Umaru shares a single room with her brother <br>Does this mean she changes clothes everyday in front of Taihei?<br><br> When does Taihei fap? </br></br></br>  <br>Norway memes <br><br>And I think the note was converting it to Norwegian kroner</br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>Taihei doesn't fap, he's pure</br></br></br>  <br>How do you know? Have you seen this anime? Do you know what anime this is? What IS this anime?</br>  <br>Taihei no longer has a sex drive after working his ass off for like a decade.</br>  <br>mah nigûr</br>  <br>It's Watashi no Chinchin wa Himitsu Desu Ka!? It's about cute traps doing cute trap things at an all girl's school. One of them has an imouto who is also a secret (himitsu) so they call her himouto.</br>  <br><br>Why isn't this a LN yet?</br></br>  <br>Sylphy is truly best girl. Usually those ojou sama are shit but she's too perfect and just wants to be recognized by her oniichan weeb.</br>  <br>Because it'd be a shit romantic LN if that was the case.</br>  <br><br>She wants to be perfect for her onii-chan, not a dirty weeb</br></br>    <br>It got cancelled in-manga.<br><br>No one will take any chances.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's a Hamtaro</br></br>  If Umaru acted the way she does at home everywhere and was fat, wouldn't that make her the average American?  I just can't get into her looking like all chibi just because  <br>Not even that much into loli/shota but tummies like that make me diamonds, jesus.</br>  <br>JUST BECAUSE WHAT?<br><br>Finish your sentence</br></br></br>  <br> No results found for "Watashi no Chinchin wa Himitsu Desu Ka!?". <br>Nice try.</br></br>  <br><br>They're tumors.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off you cancerous faggot.</br>  Bed hair-chan best girl  <br>How old is He anyway?</br>  <br>How do you know?<br>Maybe she's coding or something.<br><br>Also holy shit I am really bad at touch typing for how much time I spend on the PC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>24-26</br>  I want to sniff between Umaru's legs  No incest hints, they said.  <br> PLAY SOCCER WITH IT </br>  <br>I hate you.</br>  <br>but anon I  HATE YOU TOO </br>  <br>What did Taihei do all day before Umaru moved in with him in the first place?</br>  <br>Contemplate suicide.</br>  <br>fucking hookers and doing drugs</br>  Why is Kirie such a cute dyke?  <br>Something is a bit off here.</br>  <br>That's a pretty normal airing time</br>  <br> American <br> virgin </br></br>  <br>No? Usually it's 11PM-12:30AM-ish.</br>  <br>I hope the doujins will have some of her in bean form</br>  <br>why does he wear the mask?</br>  <br>Exactly! That's what makes it such a twist! Not only is she an American, but she's also a virgin! A pure American imouto!</br>  <br> hidden cowtits <br>Every fucking time.</br></br>  <br>Break my dick off in it</br>  <br> hidden <br>Not exactly. Umaru's always shown to be pretty busty. Like when she was shown with a swimsuit on. Not Ebina-tier, but nothing to scoff at.</br></br>  Why is it that people got mad at SnO for having the MC in chibi mode a lot, yet people like it with this show?  <br>Closest things you can get of that are on pixiv. I've seen one with her holding a long dildo and getting fucked in the ass.</br>  <br>You sick fuck</br>  <br>It's like fucking potemayo</br>  <br>Me too, her regular form is dull but her hamster form makes my dick hard.</br>  This parking lot looks like life in hell. Why wouldn't they make the spots facing the building?<br>Of course, the angle could be making it look worse than it is.

I have this theory, hear me out:<br><br> what if Spyro, as his waifu (yukino), is a person who expect us to read his mind <br> What if every time that he complained about the shitposting and the shipping wars was all a front and he was just pretending not to like it because he “was not supposed to like it” <br> What if he actually feeds off all the shitposting and the shipping wars and   genuinely  loves these kind of threads<br><br>With this in mind, what would happen if these threads ceased to exist?<br>What if he goes through withdrawal symptoms because he could not obtain his daily yahari shitposting fix?<br>He would feel so devastated that he will have to give us an incentive to want us to shitpost more<br>That incentive will be the novel translations<br><br>So if these threads ceased to exist, not only would the translations be faster, but Spyro would be happy that he finally got his yahari fix.<br><br>It’s a WIN-WIN situation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I WANT TO GET OFF THIS WATARI WATARU RIDE!!  Lewdhasu~  <br>No, you're here forever.</br>  <br>But anon, what about all of our SYNERGETIC VALUE?</br>    <br> Sigh <br>This is where my ride stops. Fuck all of you.</br></br>  saki should get more attention scince hikki alredy told her he loves her.    <br>We'll have to consolidate our losses in order to engender a result which is truly in line with our collective goals. Only in this way will we achieve maximum synergetic potential.</br>  <br>He never genuined in front of her. She is far behind.<br><br>I wonder what would happen if he genuined in front of her.</br></br></br>    <br>COMMUNOCATION is vey important for a CONCENSUS which brings about SYNERGY</br>   Yukino will never sit on your face and shit in your mouth and nostrils   <br>inb4 Yukinofags, everyone.</br>    <br>And on that day, Hikigaya Hachiman lost his virginity... By means of rape.<br>Don't let your voice die down. Let it be heard. Stop female rapists now.<br>This spot was offered from the campaign for the rights of abused males. Don't let your voice die down.</br></br></br>  <br>she would hang around him more often while 8man struggles to remember her name so he just calls her SAA-CHAN.<br>ensue maximum jelousy from other grills.</br></br>  <br>She would've already be the winrar, she would've never lost so much damn time like double YY and Iroha. Bunch of gutless babies, all of 'em.</br>  <br> Yukino will never sit on your face <br>Let's just say you didn't go on after that, all right?</br></br>  Now that's alpha.<br><br> Will they reach the fairytale ending? </br></br>  <br>Is that Chitoge?</br>  <br>You mean the HayaxHachi end? Of course.</br>  <br>that is kei.chan kawasaki imouto</br>  <br> implying she didn't tease him until he broke down and had his way with her. </br>  <br><br>So genuine would wreck her panties too?<br><br><br>Someone was going to do it eventually, it just happened to be Iroha who did it. I hate to blame the victim but if he went around trying to genuine like that what did he expect would happen?</br></br></br></br></br>  What are these faces trying to convey?   11/10 intelligent and gorgeous girl <br> super cute, sweet girl with a good body <br> both love him to death <br> they are friends so no one relationships will suffer by picking <br> still doesn't pick <br>Why won't he pick?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he refused to believe one could actually like him while he has no idea the other has feelings for him.</br>  <br>Because his fate is already sealed. Are you all ready for this?</br>  <br>I didn't know Fei watched this anime.</br>  <br><br>Haruno's plans have long since been set in motion. At this point, resistance is utterly futile. Yukino may as well prepare herself to be 8man's sister-in-law.</br></br>  <br>She likes all the girls and has a boner for Hachiman. Doujin is likely.</br>  <br>I see you have seen the light as well, my brother.</br>  when can we jump off this  <br>She does pretty enjoyable works but she is terrible with doujinshi because she has a style and is unable to deviate from it, so all the girls look off model.</br>  <br>How fast would Yukino an hero if she lost 8man to Haruno? That would probably mind fuck her worse than anything.</br>  <br> no doujins yet </br>  Why be genuine when you can be  bona fide?   I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?  <br>There's nothing to support this wild thesis.</br>  <br>Is it really so hard to believe that good looking girls that interact with him often may actually like him?</br>  <br>With Yui it's because of the whole nice girls thing but he's over that now.<br>With Yukino, to him her feelings are ambiguous as hell, he probably still thinks they aren't friends, but they treasure their relationship yet they have no idea what exactly to make of it. As far as it goes with Yukino, he has no idea what's going on.</br></br>  <br>Her sameface is so bad it makes it hard to tell who is who.</br>  <br>At least these keep things going.</br>  <br>I don't get what is so bait worthy about that post.</br>  <br><br>Well, I'm not saying he DESERVED to be raped, but... He kinda did, you know?</br></br>  <br>For me it is :^) I assume that it's not a stretch for him to think that too.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>I want to saki Saki's sakis</br>  So is there any particular reason for the naming of characters? I never read anything about it.<br><br>Just for shits and giggles? You know, the whole repetition in the first and last name, like Kawasaki Saki, Yuigama Yui, etc. Not sure why some main characters don't have names like that. Just random?</br></br>  <br> still doesn't pick <br><br>He did. And it was like 6-5 vol ago.</br></br></br>  <br> 渡航 </br>  <br>I want to be her little brother.</br>  Was it rape?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> &gt;they are friends so no one relationships will suffer by picking <br>Why do people keep saying this? 100% normal, adjusted people would be really hurt if they were in the loser girl's position much less Yui and Yukino. I expect them to hurt but overcome it and mend their relationship.</br></br>    I want to yuki Yukino's yukis    Why not both? 8man should make the right decision.  <br><br>Well yeah, I saw his name. But I refused to believe that was the reason. I thought I was missing something.</br></br>  <br>I love that shit, I wish more used it. Water colors? Or whatever it is.</br>  <br>No, she wasn't. <br>She is merely in love with the imaginary white knight who can save her from her "problems", first it was Hayama now it is 8man. <br><br>She will realize it and fall out of love after 8man told her to go fix her own shit in the last scene of volume 11.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only the right one is the right choice.</br>    <br>Yep. Choosing Yui, it wouldn't be as bad, if he fucked Haruno on the side.<br>Unless Yukino gets butthurt he's fucking everyone except her.</br></br>  <br><br>Last names are places in Chiba. First names you can already figure out.</br></br>  <br><br>I would marry a girl like saki without even blinking.<br><br>She is a great cook, great at sewing and general housewifeing. Despite this she is not afraid of working and will do in order not to be a burden to her loved ones. She is also great with children.<br><br>Oh, btw, did i also mention her body is built for hadcore breeding?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>8man should get on it. Too bad she doesn't like him romantically.</br>  Friendly reminder:<br><br>Official: Girl’s promiscuity ranking<br>Top ones= least slutty bottom ones= most slutty<br><br>1. Yui<br>  + She is the only girl known in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her, she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He chose both. It just that Yui had the romance privilege while Yukino had a platonician treatment.</br>  <br><br>What about prostate apostate Totsuka?</br></br>  <br>8man was making fun of her for not knowing what CPR means. Then Yui responded that she knows it then proceed to prove it.</br>  <br> &gt; - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>What? She said the opposite.</br></br>  <br>as much as you want her to be a girl, she is a boy</br>  <br>  - She said that not being a virgin at their age is perfectly normal (implying that she wasn’t); she even looked proud when she said <br>No, she said girls placing importance on not being a virgin is dumb, Yui said it was embarrassing to be a virgin while Yukino said its perfectly fine to be so.</br></br>  Isn't april fools coming up in the LN? 8man should confess to both Yui and Yukino and tell them april fools the next day. <br><br>Or better yet he should get Iroha in on a joke and tell them he is going out with her. They will be holding hands with Iroha as he tells them.</br></br>  <br><br>Is this better?<br><br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and virginity in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she simply doesn't care when people bring up sex.<br>The first time they talk about the contest she outright says she's afraid Hachiman will take her virginity.<br><br>She's proud when she spike because she still is a virgin, she says there is no shame in being one and that placing any importance on losing it is stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No, she simply doesn't care when people bring up sex. <br>Really? What if 8man started bringing it up and talking about it?</br></br>  <br>Most likely call him an creepy perverted stalker like always, but as she is now she'd probably do that plus look away rather than look directly at him.</br>  <br><br>She'd parrot him of course. after getting herself a true ahoge.</br></br>  <br> heartboner.jpg </br>    <br> after getting herself a true ahoge. <br>She already has one it just collapsed under its own weight.</br></br>  <br>So when is Yui going to lose it and pounce on him and grind a year worth of sexual frustration into him?</br>  Brothers? <br><br> How's the ship, guys? </br></br>  <br>Who? What ship?</br>  <br>This seems like an awful lot of effort just to say that you hate Yukino.</br>  <br>Thoughts of this make me hard.</br>  Does 8man even realize he feels jealousy?<br>All he ever describes are feelings of pain and disgust inside of him.</br>  <br>She looks so cute in S2.</br>  <br><br>Yukimom and Haruno don't have ahoges.<br>Early LN art of Yukino doesn't have an ahoge.<br>Feels version of Yukino has a more prominent ahoge than BB's.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Because she's beautiful with gap moe of her delinquent demeanour opposite to her diligent family oriented personality.

She can't be kissing him, she likes cookie man remember</br>  <br>If she likes cookie man then why did she give her cookies to 8man?</br>  <br>Those were gratitude cookies.</br>  <br>Oh, okay. Glad you cleared that up because that was bugging me for a while.</br>  <br>She was just practicing on 8man<br>You can never be too careful</br></br>  <br>Well it's a good thing 8man thinks of her only as a friend or else he'd think Yui had feelings for him.</br>  <br>Well, Yukino had Hayama to teach her beforehand so..</br>  <br>You could see Yuki starting to have girl feelings for 8man in the OVA when she blushed at the end of the episode in response to Yui saying that Yukino looked at Hachiman</br>  <br>When is she going to try and have practice sex with 8man for Cookie Man's sake?</br>  <br> thinking Hayama's "Y" girl is Yukino <br>It's obviously Yui</br></br>  <br>Now.</br>  <br>The point.

Otherwise something like a halter top and short-shorts!  Requesting Asui Tsuyu doing some shenanigans with her tongue, or heck whatever your heart desires. It can go up to 20 meters so you can be creative with it. For example she could do housework with it, maybe do pull-ups next to someone doing them traditionally, or even asked to write an answer on the board but merely using her tongue to do so. Or if you want to go more romantic have her use her tongue to grab an arm and force it atop her head, giving her a head-pat.

If you can't replicate it then use the reference to the bottom left<br> Why those references? <br>Those were the only images that had those clothing on her. Trust me when I said those were the only images</br></br>  <br>Thanks so much! That's incredibly cute, I love it.</br>  Requesting Mina Ashido carrying a big stuff animal that she won at a carnival. Thanks for the consideration!  <br>Enticing chains and lewdness</br>  And you guys hate the idea of him playing Spike Spiegel...why?<br>At 50 years old he's still the best living candidate.</br>  <br> And you guys hate the idea of him playing Spike Spiegel...why? <br>Why so ? what's wrong with him playing Spike</br></br>  <br>Keanu Reeves is 50?<br><br>Is he fucking immortal?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Keanu Reeves as Spike Speigel <br><br>Literally the best fit there is. Also, he owns the production rights to Cowboy Bebop. Which guarantees that it won't be shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> live action adaption <br><br>And I bet you're the person who wants to see a Hollywood Akira aren't you?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>He's 50?</br>  <br>Keanu's over a millenia old<br><br>but I don't know if he can do Spikes personality justice...</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit hes 50?</br>  <br>I think he could do the action sequences, but Keanu has the emotional range of Count Dracula.</br>  <br>Because Spike often showed a wide range of emotions.</br>  Honestly I am perfectly fine with that. If an adaptation has to happen, he would be perfect. When did people hate this idea? Reeves is a top bro and great actor.  DEY KILLED MAH DOG  <br>OP, that complaint is literally older than 4chan. Not in the 'hahah, we've heard this before' way but in the way that it spawned from people hating on the second Matrix.</br>    <br>Spike wasn't an emotional faggot either. He was an eccentric character which is why people loved his character he wasn't the least bit depressing</br>   Precure thread   If you had the skills to draw any precure art you wanted what would you draw?  <br>porn</br>  <br>Yayoi doing yayoi things.</br>  <br>Iona as the aunt to me and Maria's kids. That or me married to an adult Rikka/Towa/Iona.</br>  <br><br>Tons of futa porn.  Including futa-on-male. </br></br>  This thread is daijoubu.  Since there's no other thread I'll give you a bump, but I'm too lazy to actually post shit.    Stop making threads faggot.    Ep 2 doesn't air for like four days. Just leave this be.  There's not a lot to talk about for another month  This thread<br><br> I like this series <br> I hate this series <br> stop hating what I like <br> stop liking what I hate <br> My opinion is the law <br> Nicknames <br> Miki is best boy <br> "It's okay" meme <br> I was only pretending to have PTSD <br> FUCK OFF BACK TO *Another 4chan like site* <br><br>did I get everything?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Miki a boy?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>if it's a green text, it must be true</br>  <br>It's daijoubu. But if it dies, so be it. The natural course of life.<br><br>This page feels relevant for everything.</br></br></br>  <br>Just leave the threads be until there is an actual reason to talk about them - new ep, new chapter etc.</br>  <br>Listen nerd, I just watched the episode and I want to talk about things you've all already talked about 6 gorillon times.</br>  <br>Let's talk about the spooky ending.</br>  <br> It's daijoubu <br>I knew that, but seeing "diejoubu" honestly made me think I had been misspelling it for the longet time</br></br>  Is anyone else bothered by the characters' eyes? I can't help but focus on the beady little dot that's in the center   36 and 37 out <br> translations never ever </br>   So nobody actually thinks Yuki's delusional anymore, right?<br>It's pretty clear she sees the world as it really is now, and is playing along with the others asking her to ask the teacher, among other things.<br>My guess is her reason is either that she thinks THEY'RE delusional, or she's just trying to keep them thinking she still is to keep their spirits up.</br></br>   <br>I'm pretty sure they all know it's an act now and play along to keep their sanity as they did before.</br>  <br>It's to make their expressions more intense for the viewer.<br><br><br>She wants to keep being the happy spring of hope that they can cling to, even after school.  Also, it's because Rii-san's fucking lost it. </br></br></br></br>  Animeonly fags not allowed.  <br>Rii san is daijobu now that Ruu chan is with her.</br>  <br>Are you trying to tell me  the imouto isn't real?<br>I hadn't even considered that</br> <br><br> Also, wondering if Kurumi's going to go the same way the guy in Z Nation did<br>That could definitely be interesting</br> </br></br></br>  <br> I considered that but I doubt it, considering chpater 36 and 37 she seems pretty real. </br>  <br>pls no, let me in your secret club, I almost finished downloading the mango</br>  I'm sure someone has noticed this before, but<br>They smile, she smiles back and then... pic related</br>  <br>Too late faggot.</br>  <br><br> Just read the chapters and she's a delusion.<br>Rii-san lost it. She almost got shot because of it too.</br> </br></br>  <br>I don't like how Rii's sister stares at my soul.</br>  <br>Where can I look at 36 and 37?<br>I haven't been able to find them</br></br>  No matter what, constant pointless threads are a mistake. Look at the Yucky Tuna fags.  <br>"Anime was a mistake" -- Anonymous</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336<br>korean only</br></br>  <br>What kind of flowers are those anyway?<br><br> I swear to god if those are funeral flowers, I'm going to kill an anon. </br></br></br>  <br>Much appreciated<br> Yeah, she's definitely a delusion </br></br>  <br> funeral flowers <br>is that a thing?</br></br>  why so many threads of the mango lately? is it because of the animated series?  if so why everyone talks about the manga now?   <br>At least they are not growing fucking higanbana.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> Anime airs. <br> People talk about the anime and start asking questions that are answered in the manga. <br> Someone talks about the manga or tells others to read it. <br> It eventually becomes a manga thread. <br>Something like this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this<br>I started reading because of the anime, didn't even know about it before, and I love it</br></br>  <br>This. I started reading it because of the anime.<br><br>Though, it was on my backlog, and the only thing I remembered from the thread that got me interested in it before is that I heard that the MC was fucking insane and that she was surviving in some sort of apocalypse. I think I also heard that all her friends were dead and that she was imagining everyone else, with her being all by herself, but I may have read that post wrong, two years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> If you notice she fades when the university girl shakes hands with Rii-san.<br><br>Maybe Rii-san will be okay after all.</br></br> </br>  these threads are even worse than the oregairu threads  <br>That's impossible.</br>  <br><br>I've been to the oregairu threads. I strongly disagree.</br></br>  <br>Come on now.</br>  What do you think the chances are for this to get a figma?  <br>I don't know but I'll have to become a buyfag.</br>  <br>I want a Rii-san or a Mi-kun one.<br><br>Pretty low chances though, but I hope the anime does well, I liked the direction of the first episode, and I hope they end the run with the graduation.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop this. There doesn't need to be a general up at all times.</br>  I wish Vivid used different words for "Yuki-chan" and "senpai" instead of using "Yuki" for both. Makes it a pain to edit the subs since I can't just find and replace.  <br>This, if they're decent looking at least. I don't think I'd resist a Kurumi with a shovel accessory or a hatless Yuki with a winged backpack and baseball bat.</br>  <br>figma? I don't know, a Nendoroid would be the most likely thing, and even then it'd probably be just Yuki. I'd prefer a Kurumi 100x more, but GSC will generally not do more than one char from a show unless it got very very popular in Japan, which I don't see as likely here.</br>  <br>I'd rather have a static figure.<br><br> Of the shovel. </br></br></br>   Is shovel going to have increasingly harder to control urges involving eating her friends, ending in her letting one of them get killed by the zombies, dragging her body off and eating it?<br> Because I would be very, very OK with that </br>   <br>You can always get a 1:1 static shovel in no time.</br>  <br>But it won't be Kurumi's shovel.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br><br>Read the manga, it's great. Who knows how the anime will go?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br>Timeline's fucked in the anime anyway, dude</br>  I don't get it. Is Megu-nee already dead at the start of the anime? Because I'm pretty sure she was alive at the beginning of the manga.<br>Is the anime an different timeline? Because if Megu-nee is already dead then they will have to find a way to make Kurumi into a zomie (or drop that plot point entirely).<br>Could it be that it's actually set in the middle of the manga and Kurumi is already a zombie?</br></br>  <br>Nor will you get Kurumi. Ever.</br>  <br>Make one yourself</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br> catch up with the manga <br> have to wait more than a month for new chapters <br>You're in hell either way.</br></br></br>  <br>She was dead in both.</br>  <br><br>She was dead at the start of the manga too. The real changes were the addition of Taromaru and Mikki to the opening.</br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure she was alive at the beginning of the manga. <br>You're wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's why I'm settling for her shovel. If I can't have Kurumi, I want her shovel.<br><br><br>Good idea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he specifically meant she's  ACTUALLY dead in the anime, seemingly </br>  <br><br><br>Then what about the note in her book and the radio announcement?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127948221 <br>Read the manga, because the anime's changed some stuff (Miki at the beginning,  puppy not dead ), and the mangaka's working on it too so he'd probably do something with the anime to get even mangafags to watch it to the end and entertain them as well by deviating from the source.</br>  <br>Not that much man, aside from Taroumaru, the anime pretty much started after Vol 2, while mixing some events from the first manga chapter.<br><br>As long as we get some proper flashbacks it's a good direction, since they can end with the graduation.</br></br></br>  <br>She started writing the notes before she died and the radio announcement was made by the radio broadcaster.</br>  Which chapter is it that Taromaru dies?  <br>It'll probably do things somewhat differently but not deviate too much from the source still. My guess is it'll be more of an alternate take on events rather than deviate completely.</br>  <br>She died some time after the outbreak but before the beginning of the manga. Does this needs to be explained every thread?</br>  <br>The one he is introduced in.</br>  <br>Flashback in chapter 17.</br>  <br>It was a flashback, chapter 17</br>  <br>Probably, but I wouldn't discard an original ending because S2 never.</br>  <br> the radio broadcaster <br>Who? It was the internal school system, you know.</br></br>  <br>An ending needs a climax, which the manga clearly lacks.</br>  Is the chapter translation up 036? That's as far as I've read.  Just read up to current. Can someone explain to me why everyone says Miki has deathflags?  <br>She is the most sane one.</br>  <br> anime ends with Yuki and co. getting into the car and leaving for university </br>  <br>My point precisely? They might decide to go with something more ending-like than the graduation.</br>  <br> anime is just a collection of flashbacks intertwined with CGDCT shenanigans <br> final episode is graduation <br>We're going to end up suffering</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather see it end on a cliffhanger. That way, if it sells well they can make a S2, otherwise, people will hopefully be hooked enough to read the manga. I've been reading the manga since last year, so it's no big deal for me either way.</br>  <br>I'm guessing you are talking about this, which is either the radio broadcaster or the scientists contacting them.</br>  <br>Nigga, I've said it two times in the thread, ending it in the graduation would be perfect. It's meaningful, they get a few answers and they could end it with them riding to potential safety as an open end. Having them sing their graduation song could be emotional as fuck.<br><br>It could even lead into a S2 if they wanted it too.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the part where Megu-nee "sacrifices" herself to distract the zombies and save the girls.</br>  <br>Could be a big deal if the sales don't go well and it gets cancelled.<br><br>I doubt it though, but it could certainly happen.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a flashback, baka, she's been z-or-dead the whole manga</br>  <br><br>that covers 99% of /a/ threads so nobody should post anything anymore<br> forgetting your waifu is shit </br></br></br>  <br>You mean saves Kurumi while Yuki is in the bathroom? That was Rii.</br>  <br> That's a flashback <br>I don't remember it being. Do you know which chapter it is, so I can clear my confusion?</br></br>  <br>What's with this ugly chromatic aberration?<br>Why is this a thing?</br></br>  <br>Ah. That's true. It's a happy and open ending with them leaving the school towards hope.<br><br> If only they knew... </br></br></br>  <br>As long as the manga gets more readers it doesn't really matter how well the anime sells or not, it won't affect the manga.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M1u<wbr>Vi41I1oc</wbr>  [ ]  <br> Chapter 37 ended pretty hopeful with Rii-san's delusions toning down and getting to University. They did introduce human raiders though. </br>  <br>I'm tired of graduation endings though<br>I'd be ok with that this time if we got an S2</br></br>  <br>Chapter 5, you are confused because Yuuri uses the broadcasting room aswell in that chapter to distract the zombies that are attacking Kurumi.</br>  <br>That's the point anon, if the manga doesn't get readers, or worse, loses them because of the anime, it could very well be cancelled.</br>  <br> it gets cancelled. <br>Why would they ever. Etotama ran till the very end and that was the flop of the century.</br></br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thank you very much. Now I can accept the fact that Megu-nee has been dead since the beginning.</br>  <br>Well, if these threads are any indication, it'll get a lot of new readers.<br><br>I mean, we don't matter but if the situation is similar over in Japan then the first episode would have made people interested enough to check out the manga, just like here.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry anons,<br>just get the english version.<br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-05-08/yen-press-adds-gakko-g<wbr>urashi-aka-ya-akashi-ya-ayakashi-no<wbr>-manga/.87962</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Well, her 'grave' is visible on page one of chapter 4, so there's that.</br>  <br>To be honest, it was on my backlog for 2 years, literally sitting there on my list. First episode was good engouh to finally check it out and catch up.<br><br>We can only hope it's the same in Japan, but remember their magazines depend on questionnaires and stuff like that.</br></br></br>  how did the helicopter crash destroy everything on the roofs if it only crashed in the courtyard?  <br>NO<br><br>Someone has to stop Yen Press, they've gone too far.</br></br></br>  <br>The fire spread through all the building, it could've reached the roof.<br><br>Even then, smoke would've killed the plants anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> The fire rises. </br>  <br>Never payed attention to official translators,<br>What did they do wrong?</br></br>  <br>I was lucky.

Where are they now? <br><br>While it is possible some could have been lured away, most of them in the safe area were probably taken care of by shovel-chan.

People are still "alive", only that the virus addled their minds. As that opening scene at 28 Days Later when an infected priest was hesitating to maul the protagonist, implying they still have some sense remaining in them. They still keep their human sense but their whole body is totally under the influence by the virus or whatever that infected them.</br>  <br>but that would require a whole 5 seconds of google anon u think im made of time?</br>  <br>he was on the roof when he turned</br>  <br><br>Especially when   you see megu-nee's thoughts after turning into a zombie  </br></br>  <br>I can see you're not only lacking of time, but also a brain.</br>  <br>I thought that was just a nightmare<br><br>What was her comment about, in that case?<br>Just her nostalgia-ing about running herself?</br></br></br></br>   Manga Time Kirara <br><br>Oh god, this isn't gonna become dykeshit isn't it?

The Stand? Duma Key?  <br>The Stand.</br>  Im reading this now and Miki is a big cunt. I hope she dies first.  <br>Do we have to do this every thread?</br>  <br>This anon is a zombie, don't believe his lies.</br>  <br>I hope YOU die first, faggot.</br>   This gets a lot less interesting once you realize shes just faking it to keep everyone's spirits high.  I mean its still a great premise though.  <br> &gt;faking it <br> I thought they said she got better and then started to fake it. </br></br>  <br>It'll probably take a long time though. She was bitten at the time Megu-nee still HAD a bit of sense left on her, meaning the infection passed to shover might not be lethal, at least not yet. Again citing one of the characters on 28 Weeks Later. He was a carrier but by the end of the film when they were evacuated, he was beginning to show signs of turning. Cue to the epilogue showing a part of Europe being overrun, meaning the carrier fully turned at some point when he was evacuated and has now spread the infection.</br>  <br>That's the current deal, yes.<br>Unsure if anyone's still buying it though, or if it's just a mutual bullshitting going on to keep everyone moderately sane<br>Rii's definitely losing it though</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't always faking it though.<br>The scene at the classroom where she killed the zombie right before they left was the final wake-up call.</br></br>  I've been following this manga for a while now and I love the four girls. It's so depressing knowing that it will never end well for them.  <br>This is why Kurumi ended the suffering that radio broadcaster. It's only proper. You have no control over your body yet you're aware of what you're doing.<br>Reminds of the setting of CoD Zombies</br></br>  <br> It's so depressing knowing that it will never end well for them. <br>Nothing bad happened to them directly so far.</br></br>  <br><br>Come on, anon. If they're still alive, good things can happen right?</br></br>  <br>It's pretty common in newer zombie stuff to do that</br>  <br> She's not faking it, though. She's actually seeing those delusions, but her brain is still processing the environment to keep her safe in a way that she doesn't have to consciously acknowledge whats going on. As the manga goes on, she's seeing those delusions less and less often cuz she can actually process reality for longer periods of time </br>  <br><br>Psychological trauma though. That feel when you're given a ray of hope of rescue only for it to be crushed in mere seconds. For their age, it's surprising it didn't drive them fully nuts at all.<br>Of course the best solution is to still stay alive.</br></br></br>  <br> Reading the part where Kurumi almost becomes a zombie had me on the edge of my seat. I thought she was alright but now it seems that she's pretty much still fucked. The helicopter part was the same. </br>  <br> megu-nee was pretty well dead, mate. Her zombie brain in the early stages moved her to the bunker, and the last bit of her consciousness died there, to remain for however many weeks it took for them to go rescue miki </br>  <br><br>Is living with psychological trauma better than dying? I would say so, but you could probably make an argument for the reverse.</br></br>  <br> feel <br>Write properly, not in memes.</br></br>   Manga Time Kirara  <br><br>Why the fuck isn't this thread in /u/?

I'm so sorry then.</br></br></br>  Theres no way that pilot was working solo and had his own helicopter. Why did other forces not respond to such a strange downed aircraft signal?  <br>There was that one panel from her perspective showing the time Kurumi found her at the basement.</br>  <br>There might not be forces to spare. Or in the vicinity at all.</br>  <br>Plot son.<br>And I dunno if their radio broadcast was really broadcasting at that time because as far as I know, the military can lock on to radio signals and locate where it is coming from.</br></br>  Miki was in another school from the main group right? Why was her friend going to Yuki's school as a zombie?  <br>Same school I thought. Same uniforms.</br>  <br>Same school, she and her friend were just a grade lower.</br>  <br> I don't remember that. what chapter was that again? </br>  <br>So why were they at the mall?</br>  <br>That's was (way) before Kurumi found her.</br>  <br>The chapter showing the teacher going to the basement from her perspective after clawing on the door.</br>  <br>It followed the flashback scenes so who knows, the teacher might be reminiscing all these times until she was found and put to rest.</br>  <br>Maybe she was playing hooky. It's possible they went out during lunch if it's close enough.</br>  WHAT DOES IT MEAN??  <br>What  said.  She died standing against the broadcast room door, clawed at it a bit, then remembered she had wanted to go to the basement. Megu-nee still had her jaw then; when Kurumi finds her megu-nee's face is much more rotted </br>  ITT : Villains who did nothing wrong        <br>how can I explain hunter X hunter to my normalfags friends who are just starting to watch anime and get them to give it a chance?</br>  and the dog too!  <br>He did kill and eat everyone in the palace when he arived and attacked that one village, he also was killing the masters of different games that he brought in after he won against them. But yeah besides that he really didn't do much wrong once he started planying Gungi it was mainly the faggot catboy and butterflyman.</br>  Obligatory      <br>Meruem wasn't a villain, just an antagonist.

I really doubt they are eager to watch a 148 episode series now.</br>  <br>He did things wrong, he just learned from it.</br>  All he wanted was to protect the children.  <br>but in his morality that child was nothing more than a food source. You don't believe there is anything wrong with killing fish to eat their meat don't you? The same goes with the chimera ants. That's why later in the series he realizes that what he did was a mistake but he still believes there wasn't anything wrong with it because he is the king and he stands at the top of every living being. <br><br>basically you need to play gungi with a fucking fish to realize you have done something wrong which is fucking retarded for a normal person</br></br></br>  Madara Uchiha  <br>Tru dat<br>Yomi  ;_; </br></br>  ITT: Morons who think they're funny and they're trying to fit in.

Yes, Ive read the one shot and we all know the ending but i think the series can change it. To my understanding, the manga is still ongoing so i would like to know if there is any obvious hints of how the series would end.
