The fleet admiral was replaced, Garp retired, Kuzan left, a bunch of warlords left, Blackbeard made the strongest impact on the public, they were shown up by Shanks, there were likely numerous casualties in the regular troops, etc.<br><br>Akainu's thing is sheer force and flexing his muscles. The easiest way to fill those voids and make a more on the new world was to recruit the worlds best fighters and put them in high ranking positions fast.<br><br>Strawberry is nowhere near the level of Kuzan or Borsalino.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's obviously important to the WG in ways other than being a supernova</br>  <br>In the end Fuji seems to be changing sides so what the fuck does it matter? He's even more of a Smoker than Smoker himself. Imagine Oda pulling him as the next Strawhat member whose dream is getting the massive cock of the WG out of the ass of the Marines.</br>  <br>Most of the captains disgraced themselves after Marineford. Even though Ace died, the marines had a lot of black marks on them.<br><br>Conscripting in larger-than-life, powerful figures from outside the military proved their influence again and added military might that they didn't necessarily possess before. It was a smart move by Akainu. Not to say it was perfect. Fujitora and Ryokugyu were likely picked for their power, not because their views aligned with Akainu's 100%.</br></br></br>  <br>I see Bonney joining luffy alliance later on the story.</br>  <br>bless that giant bastard for providing me with so much fap material</br>  <br>So Kishi even shits up series in his vicinity?</br>  <br><br>FUJITORA IS ACTUALLY A REVOLUTIONARY MOLE.<br><br>THINK ABOUT IT.<br><br>DRAGON IS HIDDEN DRAGON.<br><br>FUJITORA IS CROUCHING TIGER.<br><br>FUJITORA IS HOW THE REVOLUTIONARIES SPY ON THE MARINES.<br><br>THEY PLANTED FUJITORA INTO THE MARINES.<br><br>AFTER KUMA'S FAILURE, THEY NEEDED A REPLACEMENT. <br><br>FUJITORA IS THE NEW REVOLUTIONARY SPY.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> joining the Strawhat <br><br>Can't see that happening, though I could imagine him joining the Revolutionaries.</br></br></br>    <br>immortality? couldn't she keep making people younger, maybe thats what the gorosei want<br><br><br> Bonney and Luffy eating and fighting over sanji's food <br>please god I need this</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>retarded</br>  <br>Hot damn, please Sakazuki, you crazy fuck, kill them all and become a dictator!</br>  <br>Fuck off back to tumblr, you piece of shit.<br><br><br> bad writing <br><br>This must be the top buzzword of "a plot unfolds the way I don't want".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure there's a limit to her power, or else they would be trying MUCH harder to capture her</br>  <br>Who was he going to promote?

The direction of bad influence, kimon, is in the ushi-tora (bull tiger) direction. So one of the demons Momotaro is fighting has horns and the other wears a tiger skin.<br><br>And the Monkey, Dog and Pheasant are animals in the zodiac, in the opposite heavenly direction from the kimon　鬼門　. Another source for the oni's image is a concept from China and Onmyōdō. The northeast direction was once termed the kimon (鬼門, "demon gate"), and was considered an unlucky direction through which evil spirits passed. Based on the assignment of the twelve zodiac animals to the cardinal directions, the kimon was also known as the ushitora (丑寅), or "Ox Tiger" direction, and the oni's bovine horns and cat-like fangs, claws, and tiger-skin loincloth developed as a visual depiction of this term.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fujitora and Ryokugyu's animal aliases (Tiger and Bull, respectively) are the representation of the northeastern quarter where the ogre that Momotarō must kill lives. </br>  Next chapter's title: "Member of the Straw Hat Crew: Pirate Hunter Zoro"    <br>Megellan is one nasty fuck.<br>We don't need his ass in the sea or else he will ruin it.</br></br>  <br>I never get the Magellan hype. Every fight he was engaged in was against a melee enemy. He has poison armor, sure, but I don't see why he wouldn't crumple against a ranged enemy.<br><br>For instance, a jet bazooka managed to hurt him. What if Zoro hit him with a post timeskip 1080 pound cannon? What would he do against it? His only real strength seemed to be that he was untouchable. He's powerful, don't get me wrong, but I don't seem him performing nearly as well against a ranged enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>This is more disturbing than all the monster rapes in the new Empress VN.</br>  <br> What caliber? The dude was hurt by pre timeskip Luffy even Sanji should be able to fuck his shit up currently</br>  <br>Dude is on a toilet for most of the day.<br><br>Only due to Magellan's choice.<br><br>Did you even read the manga? Magellan sits on the toilet all day because he chooses to eat poison for breakfast, lunch, and dinner instead of normal food because eating poison evolves his body's poison.<br><br>If Magellan just ate regular food, he wouldn't be restricted to the toilet anymore.<br><br>And since when does Absolute Justice care about Collateral Damage.<br><br>Akainu doesn't care about Collateral Damage as long as it achieves desired results</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if you're being serious then im surprised something so tame could disturb you</br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3881695165<wbr>?fr=frs<br><br>chapter</br></br></wbr>  Doesn't Magellan spend half the day in the toliet because he likes to eat poisoned food?  <br>She is only obviously important to Akainu, not WG. She might be Akainu's daughter.</br>  <br>Zoro absolutely failed against a ranged enemy.<br><br>Got one shot by the Yeti Cool Brothers.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm fully serious and I think I'll go fap to those genetically engineered giant spiders raping the hot girls rather than seeing any more of this.</br>  <br>STOP</br>  <br>D: You know how there was a question in SBS Volume 75 about the admiral candidates? Well I just figured out the reason behind your final choice of the "Ox" and the "Tiger" so here it is<br><br>Hitsujisaru [未申 (坤) -] → Momotaro<br>Ushitora [丑寅 (艮) - literally "Ox Tiger"] → Kimon [鬼門 - literally "Demon Gate"] → Oni [鬼] (Tiger loincloth, Ox horn)<br><br>And the "Oni" in this case would be representing the pirates.<br><br>Could the two new admirals "Ryokugyu" and "Fujitora" possibly have been created with the concept that, despite them being people of the Marines, deep down inside they are both Admirals who secretly harbor ill feelings towards the World Government (going against the WG → kind of like pirates?) as can be seen with Fujitora's wish to completely abolish the "Shichibukai" system set up by the World Government? <br>(Translator's Note: The epithets of the first three admirals [Kizaru- literally Yellow Monkey, Akainu- literally Red Dog, and Aokiji- Literally Blue Pheasant] come from the Japanese Legend of Momotaro, where Momotaro befriends a Monkey, Dog, and Pheasant on his journey to defeat an evil Oni in a distant island. This tale is actually based off of Onmyodo [derived from the more commonly known Feng-Shui, a traditional Japanese esoteric cosmology, in which the Ox and the Tiger, aka Ushitora, are the two zodiacs positioned in the Northeastern direction of the Onmyodo diagram and considered to be evil or unlucky. In Momotaro, the Tiger and Ox are represented by the evil Oni.)<br><br>O: What? Me, becoming restless? (cold sweat) W-w-what are you talking about? Of course not.<br><br>Uhhh, well that was one heck of a complicated theory written on this piece of paper. If you want to, go ahead and try to process it. I haven't said a single thing about whether this theory is correct of incorrect, okay! (cold sweat) Just saying. I j-just happened to throw this postcard in, so that I could show my fans the kinds of questions I've been getting and s-stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tashigi is 2cute</br>  <br>Swordsman Shiliew didn't dare challenge him, even though he was his equal and not stuck on a toilet 16 hrs of the day.<br><br>But yeah the power level creep has left Magellan behind. Even with cuffs, Doflamingo's agility and haki kicks would make him bleed hard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because even just touching him means you just fucking die.<br>His poison was shown to be powerful enough to just melt through metal, cannonballs, and bullets.<br>Even Mr. 3's wax wasn't doing shit once he got serious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What<br><br>Is<br><br>Your<br><br>Point<br><br>It's<br> <br>Still<br><br>Not<br><br>Likely<br><br>Something<br><br>He'd <br><br>Give <br><br>Up<br><br><br>He's the warden of the largest prison in OP and he decided it's fine to sit on the shitter most of the day, why would he stop?

What now? <br><br>Great fucking choice dude. Your logic is incredible.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  hhhhnnnnngggg  HOLY FUCKING SHIT  <br>Is that a kaido shadow I see?</br>  <br>How does he lose power, retard.<br><br>His poison is still poisonous. <br><br>Magellan doesn't need to continue eating poison in order to remain poisonous.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bonney?<br><br> Sengoku yelling at Garp </br></br></br>  <br> Magellan sits on the toilet all day because he chooses to eat poison for breakfast, lunch, and dinner instead of normal food because eating poison evolves his body's poison. <br><br>Literally in your own post.<br><br>Go to bed anon, you keep tripping over yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>   that faggot in the other thread who's so convinced that Tashigi is Zoro's love interest when Smoshigi has 1000x better chemistry   <br>This is the start of the end of the Marines. Fujitora is gonna end up being more relevant than the Yonkos, mark my words.</br>  <br>That's the fucking point of a ranged opponent. How is he going to melt a 'power of destruction' attack? For that matter, how would he combat any sort of logia?<br><br>The only reason some people view him as a god is because his fights consisted of people who ran up to him and got all up in his personal space. He definitely had some neat attacks but he didn't seem to be as much of a tank as people make him out to be.<br><br>He's strong, but admiral level? I don't think so. Admirals need to be below Yonkou and above Warlord.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>continue? okay</br>  <br>Smoker and Hina have hit the town before. Tashigi is more like a little sister. And having a little sister is the same as being married.</br>  <br>Isn't Smoker like 15 years older than her?</br>  <br>please dont summon them back<br><br>that shit battered my brain enough</br></br></br>  <br>So Akainu drafted 2 traitors into his army</br>  poor Akainu, at least he crippled the faggot  <br>so it looks like Akainu does have scars.

Frostbite?</br></br>  <br>Again, you are a retard.<br><br>Magellan can stop eating poison now because his poison is already deadly and no one is gonna survive it without either an antidote or Iva.</br></br></br>  <br>please put a trip on you so i can ignore and report you homosexual bastard</br>     ant ant fruit kaido is now canon   <br> Bringing up shipping </br>  <br>Carlos??</br>  <br>Doffy, Law, Vergo.

Ice can't pierce the average fighter, and freezing people doesn't work when they can dissipate or turn to lava. I hate that he isn't as cool as he could be, since everyone else in the series is so strong, ice isn't really that much of a threat, or at least it shouldn't be.</br>  <br>Because of the candy cane-looking railing? Or am I not seeing something else?</br>  793 <br>http://www.opbbs.in/forum.php?mod=v<wbr>iewthread&amp;tid=65443</wbr></br>  Kaidou was a monster from Where the Wild Things Are the whole time?  <br>Great. What's your point?<br><br>I've made my point several times now and it was very clear. The only reason he beat his opponents is because they were melee fighters and were forced to hit him. If a pre timeskip Luffy is able to dodge the majority of his attacks, I don't see why someone who is trying to keep distance would have any trouble.<br><br>And Again, Mag took definite damage from shitty attacks. He's clearly not admiral level.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off tumblrtard.</br>  <br>oda made all the designs for the movie, z is cannon and the shichibukai who cut his arm to, the scars on aokiji and shiki to</br>  <br>And we have a reason to assume it isn't canon because?</br>  <br>So thats the real reason why don chinjao is mad.</br>  <br>I enjoyed the KidHawPoo dinner.<br><br>Killer looks like the guy who needs to take care of these three rowdy captains.

Luffy can beat Kidd, right?</br>  <br>A flying Sanji? Dear god, Sanji, what are you doing right now?</br>  <br>But it is canon that it is extremely hard to find Shanks unless you are Mihawk since Shanks just chills from island to island.<br><br>100% chance that Kidd encounters both Mihawk and Shanks at the same time if he tries to search for Shanks.<br><br>Doesn't this make Kidd a retard?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would say Moria big</br>  <br>GOOD GOD</br>  <br>Oh shit.</br>  <br>This is getting pathetic.

When does it get good?  <br>forced meme/10</br>  <br>Anybody?</br>  <br><br>The first episode was just slow. It should pick up speed very soon, with various flavours of humorously stupid monstergirls.</br></br>  <br>No. Please don't read this manga, or watch this show. It would be best for all of us.</br>  <br>Why don't you see for yourself and form your own opinion. The art style does change a lot near the end of the first volume</br>  <br>Cock</br>  <br>The first chapter is easily the worst of the entire manga. 3 episode rule will definitely apply here, especially since Dumon probably won't come into play for another half-dozen episodes<br><br>Dumon is great.</br></br></br>  <br>I have a feeling that they'll introduce her earlier. I doubt they will follow the manga faithfully because they need to fit a lot of stuff into 13 episodes. Next episode will probably introduce Alium</br>  <br>True, I guess they could formally introduce her in episode 5.</br>  <br> akari of the 100 visits </br>  Full OP released when?

I'd drop it if she becomes more prominent, or even gets her own episode. almost considered dropping   Mikakunin   for the same reason.</br>  <br>This joke is gonna go far.</br>  <br>The next episode or the third might be about her, although she won't pop up for a while after that. Might seem annoying at first, but she gets a lot better</br>  <br>Bad news: I expect that she'll be the focus of the second episode.<br>Good news: She won't be half as annoying after that. Or even during, since it'll set up the central theme of JwWw  All characters are dumb; all dumb characters must suffer <br>Better news:  Her character improves significantly after her  monster secret  gets out. <br><br> On another note: I didn't realize it before, but Asahi's also acting out of character at the start of 75. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Worst news: We're experiencing delays on our side.

It's no different than drinking aside from the smell (which, personally, I think is wonderful), and second-hand (which isn't an issue unless they chain smoke and you're directly inhaling their exhale).</br>  Only good if it's herb.  <br>Fuck you too,  moot. <br><br><br>It's much worse for you than drinking and I don't like the smell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No different from drinking except the lung cancer. And drinking is bad for your health too!</br>  <br> It's much worse for you than drinking <br><br>Eh, not really. With smoking you damage your lungs, heart, and - if you smoke a lot - your eyes and skin. With drinking you damage your liver, brain, bladder, and so on. Then there's the whole possibility of alcohol poisoning, killing someone or yourself when drunk, and so on.<br><br>Drinking is arguably worse for you, but smoking gets a bad rap because of second-hand.</br></br></br></br></br>  Take any character, and making then smoke will always make them cooler.

I'm Asuka Langley Soryu! Charmed Huh!?  Tits or GTFO.  <br>You're telling me.</br>  <br>You wouldn't ask me to do something like that would you? I'm only 14 after all.</br>  <br>That's not a very Asuka-esque response, imposter.</br>  <br>Tell me about yourself! Why do you wear the headset!</br>  <br>Maybe I'm just in the mood is all. Stupid SHINJI doesn't kiss good and Kaji is always out and about. I just wish I had SOMEONE, ANYONE to talk to you know</br>  <br>Am I seriously at this point in my life where I'm going to pretend you're Asuka?</br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>Oh you mean these? They're part of my suit of course! How else would I sync perfectly with my Eva. They itch a little bit but I don't like being apart from my Eva, so I keep them on to feel a bit more attached. Hope that makes sense!</br>  <br>I thought you wore the headset always to show you were skilled and able to pilot an eva</br>  <br>I do it for that reason too! It's like when any girl puts on makeup, they do it for their own self esteem and to show off! Haven't you guys ever talked to girls about that before?</br>  <br> Haven't you guys ever talked to girls about that before? <br>Look, you know where you are, right?</br></br>   German woman <br>Why should I be charmed? You're all either into scat or fucking dogs.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Begone, female Lilin. I am trying to woo your roommate.</br>  <br>Fuck off lemming-kun</br>  <br>Well, Stupid Shinji is taking a bath right now, I always see him on this website so I thought I would see what kind of people he talks to.</br>  <br>Take a wild guess.</br>  since when have RP threads been allowed?  <br>Post pictures of naked Shinji<br>I want to rape him while he struggles helplessly.</br></br>  <br>Are you saying I'm NOT the main character? Stupid Shinji and that DOLL certainly aren't interesting enough to be any main character.</br>  <br>The only one I'll be fucking is Shinji-kun.</br>  <br>You can have him. He is a terrible kisser and won't even be honest with his feelings for that doll freak. I need an older man anyway, would any of you happen to know someone like that?</br>  <br>Well, it is summer.</br>  <br>I recommend myself, personally.</br>   you will never rape Asuka   <br>Go to bed, Asuka.</br>  <br>ooh forward! Are you a man? I want someone like Kaji, older and incredibly intellectual and sexy! Someone who knows more than ANYBODY else and isn't afraid to let everyone else know! Not some scrawny apologetic nerd like Shinji!</br>  <br>Everytime</br>  <br> Are you a man? <br>So I'm told.</br></br>  <br>I will if you come with me Kaji</br>  <br>Damn right you never will, fuck off.</br>  <br>What would we do together??</br>  Why are ginger girls so ugly?  <br>Whatever we wanted to. Being specific ruins the fun, don't you think?</br>  Sooo, why are you a menstruating nazi bitch?  <br> You wouldn't ask me to do something like that would you? I'm only 14 after all. <br>Liar, you're only 13.</br></br>  <br>You think IM ugly? Yeah Right!<br><br><br><br>You wanna play Sega Genesis games with me? My school friend has a console and I like to play on it all the time!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's German. <br>There's a reason Germans started two world wars.</br></br>  <br>If we removed the headset, would you die?</br>   2011+4 <br> avatarfagging </br>  <br>Oh but you're not ginger. YOU'RE FUCKING ORANGEHEAD.</br>  Don't mind me, just stealing Asuka's Eva. Carry on.  <br>Sure, I'd play.</br>  <br>Well you aren't going to find out!</br>  <br>Asuka what do you think you are doing?</br>   this thread   <br>IM talking to my new online friends Rei! Something clearly YOU wouldn't know about because you don't HAVE any friends!</br>  <br>She's just embarrassing herself on the internet.</br>  <br> He is a terrible kisser and won't even be honest with his feelings for that doll freak. <br><br>W-what feelings? I don't know what you're talking about...</br></br></br>  <br><br>They've started again.</br></br>  <br> Well you aren't going to find out! <br>It's a meme, dear. They're very popular with the young people.</br></br>  <br>Who needs friends. I just want to do my job.<br><br><br>As usual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You guys are MEAN! I never thought someone like Stupid Shinji would hang around people with attitudes like this<br><br><br>Shinji you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about! Misato and I both know your little crush and it's so painful to watch you fumble around it. Just tell her already!</br></br></br></br>  Best asuka  <br>How dare you imply Shinji loves anyone other than me, you filthy lilin girl.</br>  <br>You're blocking my light.</br>  <br>Where do you think he learned to jerk off over your body?<br><br> He posted it all over /b/ as he did it.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Shinji is canon gay for Kaworu and no amount of waifufagging will change that  Fuck, are we seriously doing this?  <br>Daily reminder you should stop posting this because Kaworu is as straight as a ruler and doesn't feel that way about Shinji</br>  <br>I want to know what a wild, perverted sexual orgy between Rei, Yin and Yuki Nagato looks like.</br>  <br>We're just really good friends, that's all...<br><br>Oh, and you're a pretty lousy kisser too!<br><br><br>K-Kaworu-kun...</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>uh huh</br></br>  <br>I didnt think you were too bad Shinji</br>  <br>UGH you are SO INFURIATING! You only say that because you have no friends of your own, of course other than Shinji's Father. What a joke, being friends with your commanding officer HA! He's ugly too!</br>  <br>I only live to take orders, and he is the commander so I will listen and do my job.</br>  <br> posting non-canon things <br><br>Step it up</br></br></br>  <br><br>kaworu is a better kisser</br></br>  <br>Too bad you can't do your job AND be popular like me! What a waste</br>  <br>Who was the one who couldn't sync with her Eva again? Oh yeah, you. Popularity is something I don't need but it looks like on here they favor me over you.</br>  <br> I only live to take orders, and he is the commander so I will listen and do my job. <br>And you have no feelings for him whatsoever. <br>By the way, who do those glasses you stole, belong to?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>are people unironically roleplaying?<br>is this what /a/ is like?</br></br></br></br>  <br> are people unironically roleplaying? <br> is this what /a/ is like? <br>This is the funnest eva thread in a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Who the fuck are you and what have you done with the real Asuka</br>  <br>I know you are just as insecure as I am! Don't act like you have everything in your life under control, that's not possible! That's waht makes me so angry about you Rei, you are boring and have no issue with how boring you are! Such a freak.</br>  Boy, I sure do love reading manga and Light Novels. Sometimes Tokyo-3 can go weeks without an angel attack, so you have to find a way to get through the slow days at work.<br><br>Time to browse my favorite imagebo- What the heck is this?</br></br>  Daily reminder that all evangelion waifus are shit besides Misato and Maya  What does Asuka think about BBC?  <br>I'm a better pilot than you, Asuka.</br>  No white parent would give their child a ching chong name.  <br> Time to browse my favorite imagebo- What the heck is this? <br>What's Maya really like?</br></br>    <br>Where the fuck is my laundry?

Just a gay boy who knows how to get in Stupid Shinji's underwear! So disgusting!</br></br></br></br></br>   this entire thread <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ntr<wbr>_ihsANMo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Get Maya on the keyboard. I wanna talk to her.</br>   janitors/mods still leaving this mess up   <br>Because I have my priorities straight! Shinji told me about your bedroom, it's a total disaster! You don't know how to have any fun at all. You're a LOSER Rei! A big, fat, stupid, LOSER!</br>  <br>It's past your bedtime, my son.<br><br><br>Your mom disagreed when I piloted her for the sync test yesterday. Way better than you ever did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't know anything about mothers! Especially not an incredible mom like my mom! She loved me!</br>  <br>At least I can live on my own, I dont have to rely on others I can do things on my own Asuka unlike you having to live with Ikari and Katsaragi.</br>  this thread is autistic, even for /a/'s standards    <br>Well at least I LIVE AT ALL! Why do you have all those beakers and flasks everywhere on your oven? You cooking drugs or something over there?</br>  Asuka = best.  <br> jerks off himself <br> not both himself and her while she's defenseless <br>Shinji is truly a king of betas.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh, she's a nice girl I guess. Very sweet, very quiet. She spends a lot of time with Doctor Ritsuko- I think she's like a big sister to Maya.<br><br><br>It's in the dryer!<br><br>(I can't believe a grown woman can't cook or do her own laundry... sigh, Misato)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How else do you think I get all this money Asuka?<br><br>You and your poor self can go back to sleeping next to Ikari and letting him kiss you in your sleep.</br></br></br>  <br> stating the obvious </br>  <br>Poor Shino.<br>Always surrounded by scummy, soulless, disgusting blondes.</br></br>  Just finished with End of Evangelion, watching the original series whole for the first time...<br><br>I think, while this was good, shit's waaaay overrated.
