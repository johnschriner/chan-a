[ Cerea is the cutest  I agree  Do the japs like this show, so far i really enjoyed it specially with the horse girl.  Reminder that every girl is best girl.  <br> Miia  &gt; Everything else.</br>  <br>I'm not much for centaurs myself, because I'm a lamia lover and such, but I really do like Cerea as a character despite that.</br>  She's not my favorite girl, but she is rather adorable. I'd marathon LotR with her.  <br>I disagree. Cerea is great, but the other girls are even greater.</br>  I want to fuck this horse    <br>This.<br> except for maybe cott and ton. what was up with those two, anyways? </br></br>  <br>who the hell drew this?</br>  Incoming tongue  <br>It doesn't have a very amazing reception, but it's decent.<br>Also I can't understand how anyone can think Papi isn't at least the cutest. When she started basically chirping Papi when lost track during her introduction was the most heart attack inducing thing ever.</br></br>  Oh bongo bongo bongo I wanna fuck her Congo woah woah woah woah woah woah woah.  Has Suu appeared yet? <br><br>Is there any decent groups even considering subbing this?</br></br>  <br>The only reason I don't really like them is because  they remind me of the seventh sheep kid in that one hirame comic. </br>  It's going to take ages for Polt to be in the anime, I can't take it  I love her so much  so Zombina should probably start a death metal band<br>it probably helps thats she's already dead and has acid blood.</br>   #<br>  Mero has a NTR fetish <br>  Manako is a freaky one eyed chick that would give you nightmares  <br>  Tio is huge and clumsy, would probably kill you with her strength <br>  Suu mentally challenged and lacks a brain <br><br>Yeah those are some good suggestions you got.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I didn't like her voice much but all monmusu girls are the best anyway. Some are just slightly better.  <br>I wanna see her belly.</br>  <br>Watch the anime.<br><br>Only HS.</br></br></br>  <br>sorry if i haven't kept up but, will this show be 12 or 24 episodes?</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's Thundragon from over at the Monster Girl Quest generals on /vg/.</br>  <br>All the girls have their adorable moments, but Papi and Suu are the most consistently adorable. I say this as a Rachneefag.</br>  <br> Suu mentally challenged and lacks a brain <br>Well meme'd!</br></br>  <br>13</br>  <br> hating on Manako <br><br> would give you nightmares  <br>as opposed to the zombie?</br></br></br></br>  Did the trucker die?  <br>For some reason, I've had dreams involving Polt falling asleep on my lap after a long day of exercising.</br>  <br>I too, have played Fallout 3.</br>  <br>Chihiro maybe</br>  <br>slut</br>  Do monstergirls have stands?  <br>Doppel is the best of course.</br>  <br>Papi's my favorite character, but probably not the one I would choose as a wife.</br>  <br>Zombina doesn't look scary though, she looks like a normal person.</br>  <br>Yep, cause Civilization was made exclusively for Fall Out 3.</br>  <br> Tio is huge and clumsy, would probably kill you with her strength <br><br>Tio is soft though</br></br></br>  <br>Best wife anon just accept it.</br>  <br>But how is one eye going to be any more nightmare inducing than you girlfriend's body parts randomly falling off?</br>  <br> Implying it wasn't </br>  <br>Outside the mismatched skin and body parts falling off occasionally</br>  <br>It looks more like a poop girl than a lamia in the thumbnail</br>  <br>!?</br>  <br>Funny, first time I heard it was on a Muppet show episode, back in 1978.</br>    <br>  would take up too much space <br>  your room would literally smell like a Barn <br>  tons of shit to clean <br>  horse pussy disgusting  <br>  has a cucking tradition  <br><br>She would make a terrible wife.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes, he was a Jihadist carrying a bomb fueled by the souls of dead schoolgirls.</br>  <br> &gt; has a cucking tradition <br>Are there really retards out here who still thinks it's a decent argument against cerea ? You know, the girl who's father is a HUMAN, and who wants the dick of a HUMAN.</br></br>  Can YOU find Tio?  <br>I didn't say she's best wife material, just that she's probably the cutest thing in Monmusu.<br> needless to say I'd pick her as wife </br></br>  Miia is done. The scales were pretty fun to draw.  <br>Isn't that means its only getting to vol 26. ?</br>  <br>Draw a Zombina anon.</br>  <br>See you in 3 days anon.<br><br> Thanks. </br></br></br>  <br> Cute. </br>  <br>Where is Cerea? I've not seen her yet. Miia looks amazing! You continue to impress! Keep up the wonderful work!</br>  <br>Duh, she's the one who's way bigger than everyone else. Hiding her horn isn't going to change that.</br>  <br>Her left titty is weird looking, at least too me.</br>  <br> &gt; would take up too much space <br>Shows your poor and bassicly a failure<br> &gt; your room would literally smell like a Barn <br>Like she doesn't use some perfume and wash even a whole chapter about how she bathe.<br> &gt; tons of shit to clean <br>Like she doesn't use the toilet <br> &gt; horse pussy disgusting  <br>Been proven that a horse her pussy is resembles a human ones pretty close<br> &gt; has a cucking tradition  <br>Lies her father was human and proves that she will also fall for master and he for her<br> She would make a terrible wife. <br>Shows to be the most responsible girl and is actually serious about shit.<br>She would be the best wife.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awesome work anon!

Stop shaking thou rattle. </br>    <br>I can do better just say something Cerea related and i am on it.</br>    <br>shit character with awful deformed tits</br>  <br>So you want the baby to die from suffocation.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>A Caring Mother Cerea<br><br> If I see a ms paint drawing I'm going to be slightly disappointed </br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why, but 10/10 post</br>  LALA a BEST  <br><br>Narratively chapter 26 is a good place to leave off. And there aren't enough chapters to do a full season yet.</br></br>  Would the mom of your best girl approve of you to be her daughter's mate?  <br> Stop shaking thou rattle. <br>Why is this making me laugh</br></br>  <br> we'll never get a scene in the manga where Zombina and Lala toss their heads back and forth </br>  <br>go on</br>  <br> Like she doesn't use the toilet <br><br>How is her Horse ass supposed to fit a toilet? Also no matter what she does her room is still gonna smell like a Barn. It was even mentioned in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Draw Cerea as DIO</br>  <br>I read the manga. Watched episode 1 today....it's perfect. If they don't love it they just have shit taste</br>  <br>I never before seen someone calling an unsatisfiable, painful, adamantium hard erection a nightmare.</br>   Horse pussy   <br>She should be able to handle it, and she will get some milk as a reward.

I'm not sure what I heard in my head canon but it certainly wasn't that nasally chipmunk shit that she is.</br>  <br>Who is this poser moving in on my territoy? <br/></br>  <br> I posted Cerea last week but I wanted to do it differently because I don't like how I drew the HORES PUSSY. <br>Post it again, post it again!<br><br><br> not playing with a girl's breasts, stomach, ears, lips, before J-J-JAMMING IT IN <br><br>Do you even into foreplay?

I always avoided these threads and the manga because I thought it was disgusting. But I usually pick up just about every anime every season, so I couldn't stop my autism and picking up this show. Never expected there to be a girl I actually liked. Dammit all to Hell.<br><br>Why is it always the blue haired girl I like?</br></br>  <br><br>So according to you there's only two countries, america and japan.</br></br>  <br> I always avoided these threads and the manga because I thought it was disgusting <br>Fuck off lolicon.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br> I love it, but certainly won't complain about a redraw because that means double the Cerea! </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br>Why am I laughing so hard.</br>  HORSE PUSSY   tfw horse pussy's voice isn't perfect <br>At least they got papi right<br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br> ponut <br>perfect</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Interesting</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br>Oh baby a triple.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br>You need to reverse the position of the clit for one. Clit is on the bottom of the pussy for a horse, away from the anus. Still, nicely drawn.</br>  <br> thinking lolicon is not best taste, ever <br>Hey, faggot-kun, how about you fuck off instead?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br>Has this been ran through the dream thing?</br>  <br>So was it really a yawn? Or did the anime adaption censor the shlick?</br>  <br> Anime only <br><br>Either read the manga or fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what's a clit? I thought it was just more open.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br>You are aware that this is a blue board, and that you posted a horse anus and pussy, right?</br>  <br>that chair flamingo</br>  <br>I LOVE YOU NYARLY</br>  <br>It's like it came straight out of Slaanesh</br>  <br>Post the raw, and I'll ask my Japanese-speaking friend.<br><br>Or maybe Translator-Fag is around and can explain.<br><br><br>*that's a clit?<br><br>I know what a clitoris is...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but<br> acting like the new Fate kids <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>What schlick? Sorry, I'm a pure little girl (and even so that image is too small for me).<br>Speaking of Smith, is it just me or does she look even more beautiful in the anime?</br></br>  <br> neither of the shapeshifters changed <br>2spoopy</br></br>  Papi is my favourite but the Centorea segment made me have feels. Horse-fuckers have pretty good taste.  <br>it is now</br>  <br> attractive <br> sexually aware <br> independent <br> Still teases dahling <br> Has more character than MARRY ME! <br><br>I love me my spider pussy, but I might be becoming a Smith man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks a bit more like a clit, but being more open could be another explanation. The top part of the pussy, right in the labial fold. Looks like he drew the clit there. Its supposed to be on the bottom.</br>  <br>I think schlick is the sound that the soap makes when you're rubbing it on yourself. Ms. Smith must be a very clean girl.</br>  <br>Why does such a thing as an animal filter exist.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128090660 <br>Looks perfect</br>  <br> old hag <br> manipulative <br> strong WOMYN <br> tries to prey on younger guys </br></br></br></br>  <br> that face <br><br>Pepe, is that you?</br></br></br>  <br>The threads have become infinitely worse ever since the anime appeared, and it's all because of people like him.</br>  Someone post the "wooooo horse tiitties" drawing.  <br>This is an anime/manga board.<br>If they don't want to read the manga, they won't read it because you act like the obnoxious TM kids, believe me.</br></br>  Welp, I got the 'Beetus now, /a/.<br>Gotta go have my feet amputated.<br>HNNNNNNGGGGGGGHHHH</br></br>  <br>Then they can stop shitting up the threads.</br>  <br>I haven't been in these threads for a long time because they went from monmusu to monstergirl general to monstergirl writefagging general. Did they get any better at some point before the anime?</br>    <br><br>She's just too damn cute.<br><br>I hope she doesn't become a stereotypical spoiled brat character.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Oh lawdy.</br>  <br> does this look like the face of mercy? </br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>I feel the anime uses to many close up shots when showing Smith. Like when she had her second phone call with Darling it panning shot, instead of showig her whole body. I mean it makes her look sexy, but I can never get a good image of her to post</br>  <br>Considering that she shares the same voice actress as Chiyo Sakura, her lines are pretty cute.<br><br> I keep mentally swapping Papi's image with Chiyo's in my head. It's pretty darn adorable. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Aaaaaaaaaaah, secondaries. I almost envy you.</br></br>  Best girl coming through.

A CUTE.</br>  <br><br>ppl actually download this ?!</br></br>  <br>Anon you need to calm down.</br>   streaming is now tolerated in /a/ <br>What the flying fuck.</br>  <br>There are definitely some bizarre non sequiturs and entire non sequitur chapters, but for the most part it's really adorable slice of life with dark undertones (like the story of why Himeno has red hair).</br>  Has there been any Polt yet?<br><br>I need more Polt in my life</br></br>  <br>I have never seen a list that wrong.<br><br>Everyone knows its:<br><br>Miia &gt; Rachnee &gt; Suu &gt; Mero &gt; Papi &gt; Lala &gt; rest of the monsters &gt; any random background character in the series &gt; pretty much everyone else &gt; The Fake Director guy &gt; Cerea</br></br></br></br></br>    streaming is a bad thing ?  <br>I just want to have a mermaid wife and some mermaid children, I'd even be willing to give my life for that to happen.<br><br>I'd ask "Is that too much to ask?" but I won't, because I already know it is.</br></br></br>  <br>You something not many people focus on? Mero's hands. I like them</br>  <br>Her hands are cute yeah</br>  <br> you wanna go walkies? <br> FUCK YEAH WALKIES! </br></br>  <br> dark undertones <br><br>Did you mean Yuri undertones? It has lot of those along with weird fetish shit too.</br></br></br>  <br>doesn't she appear only after Mero? Wait in line anon</br>  <br>Ditto, Autismo</br>   everyone falling for obvious bait   <br>Streaming is much improved anon, proper 720p streams are quite easy to fine.

Why won't ZUN let ufotable make a Touhou anime?  Why won't ufotable release their touhou short?  Because ZUN doesn't want to see his creations with rhinoface  Because fuck off, Zun can do what he wants.  I don't even want a touhou anime anymore because I don't give two shits about most of the new characters since MoF, and if anime happened they'd take up way too much screen time.  <br>Bleach and Naruto get away with that</br>  Character group rankings<br><br>God tier:<br>SA, EoSD<br><br>Good tier:<br>IN, UFO, MoF<br><br>OK Tier:<br>PCB, PoFV<br><br>Meh tier:<br>TD<br><br>Who cares? tier:<br>DDC, LoLK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  He already has enough money for a lifetime supply of beer.<br><br> AWOO best 2hu </br></br>  Because people will complain that the characters are not like doujins portray them.  <br>Why not just do a straight adaptation of the games then<br><br>Or maybe take one of the manga like Forbidden Scrollery or SSiB<br><br>That way people can't complain about canon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who cares? tier: <br>I like Seija and wolfu. Wolfu, Sekibanki and Wakasagihime make a good trio in fanworks too.<br>Sukuna is also super cute in ULiL.<br>LolK has Dreamy and I love her.</br></br></br></br>  ZUN thinks that if a touhou anime was made people would remember touhou for the anime to the point where it overshadows the games, and he doesn't want that.  <br> [Citation needed] </br>  <br><br>As if anyone cares about the games at this point anyway</br></br>  <br>That would require writing an actual scenario, but Zun's writing isn't really what moefags desire. And letting someone else doing it would result in secondary memeshit like Summer Day or EoSD Phantasm episodes. People would enjoy it, but not Zun.<br>What's the point in making Touhou anime at all? If you just like the designs, there's lots of anime with various magical girls. Making an anime about colorful danmaku shooting doesn't seem like a profitable idea to me.<br>Either way, Zun doesn't want an anime overshadowing his games, let him be.</br></br></br>  QUICK! Who's a better composer? <br><br>Sawano or ZUN??</br></br>  <br>He wouldn't make about two games a year if no one cared. <br>(Actually he said he would even if no one buys it)<br>I do care.</br></br></br>  <br>I find it hard to believe that ZUN doesn't have some kind of formal musical training.</br>  <br>He played trumpet in school.</br>  <br>I will never understand what's up with him and that ridiculous hat.<br>Maybe it's the source of his power.</br></br>  <br>Who would you rather drink beer with? Zun or Sawano?</br>  <br>Most Touhous have ridiculous hats. And it is said that one's creations are a reflection of the creator's self. So yeah.</br>  <br> that ridiculous hat <br>Zun is /fa/ you pleb</br></br>  <br>No one but ZUN could pull that off</br>    <br>There are already 2.<br><br> there will never be Episode 3 of A Summer Day's Dream <br><br>I wonder where in the hell did that circle get the funds to get them VAs to do it in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>PCB has Ran though</br>  <br> where in the hell did that circle get the funds <br>Never underestimate pure dedication, m8</br></br>  <br>I heard Sawano ripped off ZUN Septette.</br>    <br>Because he knows Touhou wouldn't work as an anime. OVAs would, though.</br>  <br>SSiB ova would be nice</br>  I just want to see Tenshi animated one day.  <br>I do.</br>  <br>See you in August.</br>  Did touhou Mangekyou 4 came out yet?  <br>It's out.</br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br> Zun's writing isn't really what moefags desire <br>Yeah, Kisume that is known as "bucket loli" is also killed people. Actually, lots of characters in Touhou don't have any problem with killing humans (aside from the villagers). because they are filthy youkai.</br></br>  <br>Not really true. It's forbidden for youkai to kill humans.</br>   haven't played any 2hu games <br> jerked off to more doujins than I can count <br> a dozen songs on my HDD <br> even a pack of wallpapers <br><br>Am I missing anything?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're ok games, but nothing really all that special.</br>  <br>http://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Perfe<wbr>ct_Memento_in_Strict_Sense/Youkai<br>"Youkai attack humans for food."<br>What you are probably thinking of is that vampires can't attack Gensokyo humans for blood as per a contract.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>They only forbid to kill human villagers. For the human from outside, not a problem to kill them.</br>  <br><br>And since youkai have to terrorize humans in order to exist, Yukari draws humans from the outside world into Gensokyo for them to feed on. Reimu is happy to chill out with these monsters.</br></br>  <br>ZUN of course, is this even a question?</br>  <br>This.<br>I fucking love Doremi. Her patterns, her music, her design, just name it, It's all fucking great.<br><br>I can't wait to see the rest of the characters but I really hope we aren't getting more moon rabbits even though I'm almost sure it will happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? What are the humans in the village for anyway? If they're not food, what are they staying there for?</br>  <br>Feed belief to the youkai.</br>  <br>Youkai's existence rests solely on the humans belief/fear of them. When this stops they seize to exist.</br>  Look at the Kancolle anime<br><br>enough said.</br></br>  <br>The Touhou world and characters are much more interesting than KanColle though.</br>  <br>I have no interest in Kancolle and didn't watch the anime. What was so bad about it?</br>  <br>I never expected I would ever say these words, but compared to KanColle, Touhou at least makes sense.</br>  <br>play the fighting games at least you causal<br><br> the vs shooting games are nice if you have friends who wont think that shit is creepy </br></br></br>  <br>I think everyone agrees a Touhou anime would only work as a collaboration.<br>Think like how Space Dandy had all sort of directors, animators and studios working on it.<br>It would probably be the best doing episodic stories with different themes from SoL to brawling to laser spams.</br></br></br>  <br>Touhou anime would work just fine as a monolithic effort, there are lots of doujinshi interpretations that would work as anime, and an original approach based on the(more coherent and well-fleshed out than most people realize) actual canon would work as well. The problem is that it would invite endless shitposting, because even people who aren't secondaries rarely bother to go through all the available written material, and all have their own interpretation of the events.</br>  <br>Why would you think of the touhou games as creepy? I can see why they would think of them as crazy or even weird but not creepy.</br>  <br>Normalfag poster has normalfag friends.</br>  Mangekyou is animated by at least some people who work at Ufotable. In terms of animation quality it's as good as you can ask for in a real TV series.<br><br>Touhou would do just fine as an anime. Probably not as a retelling of the games series but as a fan oriented new series like Ibara Kasen. It would be slice of life with some quirky folk lore and fluff every episode. I'd 100% watch it but /a/ will probably hate it.<br><br>The kind of anime some secondary fags want (i.e. a grimdark remake of one of the main games) should never happen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mangekyou is ok at some parts, but overall, it's shit. And the main reason for that would be IMO it's a retelling of the game mixed with pandering, and it's not all the time that it focuses on the main storyline. Just a bunch of 2hus doing something.<br><br>not to mention they fucked up some 2hus real bad</br></br></br>  I would be happy, if 2hu end up in being long TV series like Bleach or Naruto. That would be great, looking how good characters and plot it have.  <br>Shit anime for shit game.</br>  <br>Because Touhou is a game and should stay that way, and ZUN knows it.</br>  <br> EoSD <br>Cirno is the only good thing that came up from that game</br></br>  <br>Nah, it needs a game from Cyberconnect2 like NAruto</br>  <br>Fucking contrarians.</br>  <br>I'm not contrarian, I fucking hate vampire lolis, everyone of them.</br>  <br>When did you let the fire in your heart die, anon?</br>  <br>Because they always are arrogant "be grateful to lick the floor I step" oujos that need to choke on a dick.</br>  <br>What about Sakuya and China?</br>  <br>Meiling is ok, Sakuya is overrated.</br>  <br>Not this fucking fanonshit again.</br>  Did anyone else here read the latest chapters of Forbidden Scrollery? Shit got a little bit dark for a minute there.  <br>It was the one were Reimu killed a guy that dindu nuffin?</br>  <br>The count chocula? no im sure there was another one.</br>  <br> Who cares? tier: <br> LoLK <br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>Well my bad, Reimu still a bitch.</br>  <br>That's the one I was thinking of. He really dindu nuffin but I guess it was for the greater good.</br>  <br>Reimu's not doing her job properly, that's why she gets no visitors(read:donations).</br>  <br>Of course it was for a greater good, good goy.</br>  <br>They've lived there before the Border went up, and are the reason the oni went underground. They are descendents of youkai hunters, and are so goddamn backward in knowledge that they think all the shit that sounds like superstitious nowadays exist. Fuckers probably don't even know what guns are, despite the border going up in the 1800s.</br>  <br> Who cares? tier: <br> DDC, LoLK <br>Great characters, great music, not shitty shot-types, enjoyable difficulty curve, what's not to like?</br></br></br>  <br> enjoyable difficulty curve <br>That's one of the best things of DDC and LoLK.</br></br>  <br>Which Touhou doujin is considered the best?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jAd<wbr>iiLLCqhM</wbr>  [ ]<br> Rumia-nee will never be your onee-chan </br></br>  <br>Personal fave<br> http://exhentai.org/g/754753/2707ec<wbr>5fad/</wbr> </br></br>  <br>I don't think any doujin is really "considered" the best. My personal favorite:<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/touho<wbr>u-kazenakishi-doujinshi-r3203</wbr></br></br>  Can 2hu defeat TTGL?  No 2hu is as good at being both sexy and cute as Suika.  <br>What's wrong with her lips, it looks pointy.</br>  <br>It's a fang.</br>  <br>Did you saw Kancolle anime? That's why.</br>  <br>Why are you comparing it to Kancolle?</br>  <br>Fang color is the same as teeth, yet her pointy lips has the same color as her skin.</br>  <br>What about the mystery of the god of Hakurei?<br>Why it is so effective as Yohky exterminator when Reimu failed to gather faith to it?</br></br>  <br>It's just a cute stylistic choice.</br>  <br>magnum koishi is literally the best work in erotic fiction ever created.</br>  <br>gensoukoumuten's.</br>  <br>This is too true.</br>  <br>Basically, the way that things work is:<br>The Human Village is a safe zone for humans. The youkai aren't allowed to eat the humans of the village, and in exchange the humans don't kill the youkai, only "exterminating" them in what is basically ritualized play fighting. This is helpful because the youkai need human belief in order to exist, and this lets humans and youkai have a sufficiently antagonistic relationship while also coexisting. <br><br>If you're an outsider, either because you stumbled in by accident, you entered deliberately or because Yukari gapped you in for shits and giggles, you're fair game, although a lot of the major youkai can be reasoned with. You either have to try to make your way to the Hakurei Shrine, another safe zone where you can be sent back to the outside world, or to the Human Village and become a resident.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I prefer Moriya no Ou.</br></br>  why is reimu such an asshole  <br>My favorite was probably Dodo by Yakumi Sarai. inb4 edgy.</br>      <br/>  <br>Are you implying something</br>  <br> PCB <br> OK tier <br>Are you fucking kidding me? The shittiest taste ever<br> Aside from that everything is in place </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>I think I heard someone say they volunteerd without pay</br>  <br>In touhou vampires are considered a type of oni. Oni hate beans.</br>  <br>arn't they suppose to be dry and specifically thown at them to work?</br>  <br><br>It's a /jp/ thing.</br></br>  <br>It would probably focus too much on the shitty 2hus like the ones from EoSD so I'd rather they not even make an anime at all.</br>  <br> EoSD <br> anything but shit tier <br>I bet you like shitty vampires you pleb.</br></br></br>  <br>EoSD's first four stages all have good characters, which is much more than a lot of other games, especially outside 6-8.</br>  Someone post the ``someone post the run one'' one  <br>Not if ZUN had control over it. ZUN doesn't give a fuck about what the fans like or not.</br>  <br>Yes, but this translates to a natural fear of beans as well.</br>  <br>Which is why Cirno got her own game and is still around, correct?</br>  <br>It's true, idiot.<br>Well, maybe I'm exaggerating when I said "most", but lots of youkai have no prproblem with killing outside human</br></br>  <br> EoSD's first four stages all have good characters <br>No they fucking don't, the only good one is Patchouli.</br></br>  <br>For ero-doujin, I like Haitokukan's series the most.</br>  <br>Touhou has an actually fleshed out fantasy world with interesting characters. Kancolle is like if you took Strike Witches' scenario and replaced all the characters with ship personifications.</br>  <br>Flandre is on of the most popular characters but her appearance in canon is so little.<br>Your point?</br></br>  <br>And if you added 10Kg of facebook games and no context to the characters other what they are.</br>  <br> implying he did it for the fans <br>It was a goddamn tie-in to the manga.<br><br>Rumia AND Flandre hasn't done shit lately, same as the other 'popular' 2hus, hell Momiji still hasn't even gotten a proper introduction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm part mexican would that work as well?</br>  <br> Rumia <br> Cirno <br> Daiyousei <br> Meiling <br>  Koakuma <br>There has to be at least one other character from this list that you like for any reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like some of them, but I wouldn't call them good characters. They barely have any presence except for Cirno.</br>  <br>The only way a 2hu anime could work is if ZUN did it the same way the three fairies manga works, trying to adapt the game stories is just gonna be shit.<br><br>At most they could do OVAs about the manga arcs.<br><br>Also, the only way a 2hu anime would even be approved is if ZUN had complete control over the story like he does with the manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LoLK <br> enjoyable difficulty curve </br></br>  <br>the reason touhou is so big is that there isn't much canon and +99% of all content is fan derivatives filling in the gaps, making an official anime would upset the delicate eco system of touhou fans.</br>  <br> there isn't much canon </br>  <br> What about the mystery of the god of Hakurei? <br> Why it is so effective as Yohky exterminator when Reimu failed to gather faith to it? <br>It's not effective, Reimu herself is just so fucking OP she doesn't need to rely on her god.</br></br></br>  <br>Dont reply to secondaries/bait.</br>  <br> there isn't much canon and +99% of all content is fan derivatives filling in the gaps, <br>That's so 2005 excuse. We have print works and manga now.</br></br>  <br> shitty vampires </br>  <br><br>You've read too many doujinshi mah boy. <br><br>Neither of them are that. One is just arrogant and thrill seeking to cure boredom. The other one is pretty friendly, albeit impulsive and likely to kill you on a whim.</br></br></br></br>  I want to marry Kasen!  <br>But she'd be a pain in the ass.</br>  <br>Saved.</br>  <br>this is the only acceptable anime to be made for touhou<br><br>a wild and horned hermit anime</br></br></br>  <br>I love Chado and Zounose</br>  <br>Three Fairies or Forbidden Scrollery could work, too.<br>SSiB would be cool as a 90 minute OVA.</br></br>  <br> Ufotable <br>Because ZUN probably don't want a normalfag piece of shit coming out of it.</br></br>  <br>Setting aside how that doesn't relate remotely to the Scarlets, and how there have been tons of different girls like Misaki from Blood Alone, and ones whose main appeal comes from an intense dere side like Evangeline. . . where exactly is the problem with a dominatrix vampire loli? Do you NOT want to be stepped on?</br>  <br><br>Where can I get a Zun hat?</br></br>  I want /jp/ to leave<br><br>That being said Touhou music and all the remixes and rearranges that come with it are god tier. I seriously doubt one man could make all those catchy as fuck tunes.</br></br>  <br>Slow sex with Youmu.</br>  <br><br>The only way a Touhou animu would work is if they animated the canon works and didn't deviate from them or add in unnecessary pandering. Anything less and the internet, as well as part of Japan, would fall apart.</br></br>  <br> ufotable <br><br>uhh no, just look at god eater.</br></br></br>  <br>How new?</br>   EoSD 2hus are the worst because they're the most popular am I right bros?   In all honesty, I'd totally watch an anime about Mokou. She probably murdered a dude and let a bunch of other soldiers die while trying to steal the Hourai Elixir from them. She's stone-cold as fuck for a little girl.  Will forever be my maidfu.  <br><br>One of my favorite 2hus came from EoSD, plus it was the first game I played and completed.</br></br>  Post cute 2hus.  <br>That was IN for me.</br>  <br/>  <br>Bomber Grape's dojins</br>  <br>She only murdered a man named Iwakasa for it.<br><br> She feels Iwakasa's Curse as he died an Honest Man's Death. She drank the elixir and became a Hourai Doll. </br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not me and I'm too elitist to participate in threads like that. What are the odds? You'd think they'd use a different pic for that kind of thread.</br></br>  <br>I know it's not you.<br>I was just redirecting the image bug if someone was interested on it.<br>It's always amusing when it happens.</br></br></br>  <br> Touhou anime <br> made for profit <br>He would actually have to please the fans this time.

The art on the following strips is consistent enough that it is part of the same work.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but on the bright side now that we made it through both waves, we can have an actual Lucky Star thread.</br>  <br>The first few reminder threads I saw I posted pretty early as well.<br><br>I've ignored a couple though.<br><br><br>His comments basically out it as the true end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we already did have an actual Lucky Star thread.</br>    <br>This Lucky Star thread was a bad dream. We can move on to a good one now.</br>    Post Perfect Girls.  <br><br>You first.</br></br>  I like Kurisu  in the dub.       <br> disgusting, literal cow-tits. </br>  <br>I think you're mistaken my friend, i already posted the best.</br>        <br>Did someone mention cow tits?</br>  <br>You could at least have posted Hotarun.</br>    <br><br>More like perfectly shit.</br></br>  <br>and natsumi is perfection you moron</br>    <br>I don't think that's a girl</br>  <br>She achieved perfection on a level beyond girlhood.</br>  <br>You should hear her singing voice.</br>      I said perfect girls not sluts.      This is a reminder that the Monogatari series is objectively shitty.  Why are tomboys in anime so damn dickhardening.  <br> &gt;raising a family of tomboy daughterus with your tomboy waifu </br>  <br>Lili has good taste.</br>  Flustered tomboys &gt; Smug tomboys  <br>boyshorts are the best<br>I like how the cling to every curve of the girl<br>They also look comfy as fuck</br></br></br>  <br>ive never played it either but I think most of her fans are females, so she thinks be more girl will get her more male fans</br>  What are the chances that accel has already fucked the original?  Considering he's impotent?<br>Well, maybe he used a strap-on.</br>  This pairing has more chances of happening than Kamikoto if nt13 spoilers are to be believed. And I'm totally okay with it.  <br>To add to this thought, even if it isn't romantic or even a good end (ie Accelerator dies protecting her/the clones) I see Accelerator being far more involved with ALL of the Misakas' conclusion than Touma.</br>  <br> chances of happening <br>It already happened</br></br>  <br>I guess you could say that but I'm talking outside Othinus fucking with the world. It honestly makes more sense than her ending up with Touma</br>  Can we start officially supporting this pairing without being called a crack shipper or troll now? Can that happen if the NT13 spoilers are confirmed true?  <br>AccelxLO OTP</br>  <br>That's cute too but I also like this pairing</br>  <br>Forgot everything about that volume what exactly happened in one of the worlds with them?</br>  <br> What spoilers? </br>  <br>[spoilers] Mikoto gets depressed because she was called a burden to Touma and feels an incredible sense of distance fro him. She goes back to her dorm quietly. Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma</br>  <br>Accelerator saved all the clones and they were seen close together and assumed to be close friends or lovers</br>  <br>mayonegg edit?</br>  <br>Accel was basically her Touma in the perfect world since he was the one that saved the clones</br>   yfw this pairing would make Touma happy because it would ease some of his Othinus trauma   <br> Accel says something cheeky towards misaka  <br> misaka gets annoyed and fires a railgun out of reflex <br> this time her railgun gets reflected right back at her and she dies </br></br></br>  <br> Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma <br>With just this? People sure like to troll</br></br>  <br>Yeah, no. The comedy scenes would turn into Accelerator reflecting her attacks away and destroying shit, making the joke "That damn Level 5 couple is a property liability"</br>  <br>But it really does seem that way, unless the spoilers are wrong but the illustrations and photos of text seem to confirm them as legit</br>  <br>But this is the real OTP.</br>  <br> i-it is not like I wanted to hit you or anything BAKA  <br> tsk. D-don't think I was trying to protect you, next time I'll reflect those back at you </br></br>  <br>If there's no way Accelerator can't have one of the Misakas I'd accept this, too. Although I'm sure she prefers Hamazura</br>  <br>Nah they are bros</br>  Accelerator x Mikoto best hate sex.  <br>Not gonna lie him dealing with misaka's bs would be amusing.</br>  <br>Yes. At some point it'd stop being hate sex because they'd enjoy it so much.</br>  <br>Team up again fucking when?</br>  <br>Crazy don't go well with crazy</br>  <br>Accel is probably already sick of all these misaka's.</br>  <br> implying he hasn't developed feelings for all the Misakas and he doesn't know what it means or what to do with it </br>  Still waiting for that moment where Accelerator saves Mikoto, Kamachi.   mikoto is a narutard <br>truly worst misaka</br>  <br>This. <br><br> she gets gravely injured <br> Accelerator is nearby, sees it, flips his shit because it reminds him of the Sisters Project and saves her <br> Mikoto's worldview is flipped upside down  <br><br>Make it happen Kamachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto's worldview is flipped upside down <br>More like we get two tsundere tsuntsun at each other</br></br>  <br><br> She goes back to her dorm quietly. <br><br>Is this near the end? It sounds ridiculous to have it happen in the middle but when Magic Gods you never know.<br><br>I mean even scrub magicians have a spell to get people like her away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But misaka too strong to get harmed in AC.</br>  <br> I mean even scrub magicians have a spell to get people like her away <br><br>If they're quick enough to cast it m8.</br></br></br>  <br>They make the cutest couple</br>  <br>Well he already had a taste of her meat so anything is possible.</br>  Am I the only one?<br>To be honest the manga hints this alot.</br>  <br>She's probably dead in the current index timeline.</br>  Wouldn't Misaka working her way into Accel's life sorta make fucked up sense?<br><br>He's already got Last Order and Worst. At this point he may as well complete the set and get the OG.</br></br>  <br>Considering Accelerator's powers would make him amazing in bed, probably not.<br><br>She still shows interest in other people.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, it just feels like she's gonna die, probably sacrifice herself for some bullshit.<br>I really like her though, and she may be the first girl other than LO to actually worry for Accelerator's well being, and their interactions are cute.</br></br>  <br><br>Taped a popsicle sticks to his dick.</br></br>  <br><br>Sure, it's not like Touma will complain.</br></br>  Zero.  <br>Touma's harem is already big enough He doesn't need Misaka up in his shit. <br><br>It would also spread the Level 5's around the protagonists with Meltdowner/HAMAZUUUURRRAAAA, Mental Out/Touma and Accel/Misaka and Guts/Supremacy of the military court.</br></br></br>  <br>Her powers would make her pretty good in bed too. The two of them fucking would be out of this world sex</br>  <br>That's pretty much what everyone is saying. It would make more sense than her getting with Touma. I have a feeling Touma would cheer them on.</br>  <br> mikoto  <br> losing a fight </br></br>  <br> Mental Out/Touma </br>  <br>let's be real here we don't know where that would have gone had the mind wipe thing hadn't happened</br>   shipping shitsaka with accel <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>It would make her a better character. Even Touma would agree</br>  <br> but the illustrations <br>Which one?<br> She goes back to her dorm quietly. Most people think she's accepted she won't win Touma <br> Most people think  <br>Seems legit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what would their children look like?</br>  <br>Still mad.</br>    <br>Is Haimura ever going to learn to draw legs?</br>  <br>He seemed happy for them back in omega world</br>  <br>He draws fine legs and fucks up the others in the same illustration.</br>  <br>He has his priorities straight</br>  <br><br> popsicle  <br><br>Cold on the cob*</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope that was foreshadowing she'll   help save everyone from Demon Lord Touma by completely erasing Othinus and her death from his mind.   How mad would everyone be</br>  <br>*tips tophat*</br>  <br>Skinny ass brown haired nigga.</br>  <br>Would be 10/10.</br>  <br><br>They would have a white streak in their mostly brown hair.</br></br>  <br>It really and truly would.</br>  <br>Accel's hair is not white</br>  <br>You've gotten me on board</br>  <br> Accel's hair is not white <br><br>How is it not?</br></br></br>  <br>Good</br>  <br><br>Their son would be a nice guy who, like his mom, can use electricity. His nickname is Thunder Rod and he will spend a week training with Thor and Uncle Touma in the harsh lands of northern Sweden. <br><br>Their daughter would be a chuuni edgelord. She'd be Terrorist Outfit Biribiri with Accelerator's mad kekekekekeke'ing and plasma generating. Also she wears spats beneath her skirt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cute as fuck</br>  <br><br>We don't know what his actual hair color is. His ability has just made it lacking any pigment (just like it's made his balls spermless).</br></br>  <br>It is not, he is albino because of his powers <br>His hair was probably black considering that he thinks that he looks obviously japanese</br></br>  <br> His nickname is Thunder Rod and he will spend a week training with Thor and Uncle Touma in the harsh lands of northern Sweden. <br>FUND IT</br></br>  High quality scans where  <br>Misaka x Accelerator confirmed</br>  <br>I wouldn't say that but I'd say it's more viable than Mikoto and Touma at this point</br>  Reminder that Worst and LO's feelings for Accel are fake.  I'm late but fuck this shit getting good.<br><br>New chapter when?</br></br>  <br>end of the month</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Stop shipping accel with this piece of shit you bunch of faggots.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. It makes sense and would make her character a million times better. You seem tsundere for this.</br>  <br>Touma looks so gone in the first pic</br>  <br> He doesn't ship Accelerator/Misaka's </br>  <br>I don't give a fuck about her character.</br>  <br>So tsuntsun.</br>  OTP.  <br>It's canon he touches Misaka clones inappropriately</br>    <br/>  <br>Right.</br>  So when is someone going to feed the JS06bot his book?  <br>Nda is best girl. Fre a shit. A SHIT</br>  <br>Why is Stiyl such a cuck?</br>  <br><br> implying that's Fre or Nda <br><br>Stiyl x Fre/nda would be a weird pairing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there really such thing as hate sex?</br>  <br> Snitches get stiches <br>I remember when that sperglord Frendafag got his panties in a bunch when someone said this and spent the whole thread crying about it.</br></br>  Will Misaka have tits bigger than her mothers?  <br>I knew, I just needed a reason to remind the world that Nda is best.</br>  <br>She will get Worst's size at best.</br>  <br>This was only good because that duraraa author wrote it right?</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Accelerator is one lucky motherfucker. WORST is the best fucking girl.</br>  <br>Real talk.</br>  <br> WORST <br> not LO </br></br>  <br>Don't steal her man, Misaka</br>  <br>Both of them are best.  WORST is just more best. </br>  <br><br><br>Kamikuro is the best.</br></br></br>  <br>Kuroko is shit.</br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  <br>Kuroko a big fat shit.</br>  So how long do we think this "NT13 kills Kamikoto" troll wave is going to last?  <br>When it gets translated and is confirmed to not be a troll</br>  <br>Also, not everyone who thinks NT13 confirms Kamikoto isn't happening hates Misaka and is out to troll or harass the shippers. Some people think it because it makes logical sense given the spoilers and will take back said opinion if the spoilers are false, which it is doubtful</br>  <br>When it gets translated and people can't just base their entire knowledge of the novel on spoilers.</br>  Season 3 when? I ain't bothered to read 20+ of these books.  <br>Read the LN's. There will never be an S3 most likely.</br>  <br>You won't regret it, regardless of what character is your favorite</br>  <br> some probably accurate spoilers say that she goes home depressed because she feels useless <br> obviously the ship is dead and I should go post about how this means Accelerator-Misaka is a better possibility than it is! <br>No, I'm pretty sure those are trolls out to harass people.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless it's Himegami.</br>  <br>How can Kamikoto happen when ToumaxSuffering is a thing?</br>  <br>So stating an opinion that isn't "she will end up with Touma" is harassing her Touma shippers? Yes, people in this thread did say Misaka/Accelerator makes more sense than Misaka/Touma, but no one here said "Fuck off Touma shippers! Your shitty ship is dead!" or anything inflammatory</br>  <br>But isn't this popular in Japan or something and didn't the anime sell well so like why wouldn't they be?<br><br><br>Maybe when I've cleared some shit in my backlog.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It sold very well in Japan but that doesn't matter. The anime was used to advertise for the LN's, and since the LN's are selling well there's no reason to licence another season.</br>  Isn't both the anime and manga based on some light novels?  <br>Why is shit like sao getting another season then?</br>  <br>Because it's far more popular than Index overall.</br>  <br>Index yes, Railgun is just a manga with a few LN side stories.<br><br><br>Doesn't it sell a lot better than raildex? Both in animated and LN form?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Misaka/Accelerator makes more sense <br>You mean those characters that have talked like twice? And have expressed no desire to have anything to do with one another?<br><br>Honestly Mikoto will probably end up with no one, just like Touma and Accelerator and probably everyone but Hamazura. Romance isn't important in this series. Hamazura only gets a pass because romance is his reason for action.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To add to this, even Hamazura's relationship with Rikou, pretty much the only relationship in the series, has been out of focus basically since it started.<br><br>Kamachi just doesn't like to write about relationships.</br></br></br>  . <br>just because she's spent the entire series chasing Touma doesn't mean it makes sense for her to end up with him. In fact her ending up with someone she doesn't know would make sense thematically. A sort of "you can't always get what you but you can end up with what you need"</br>  <br>She's not going to get anyone because this isn't that kind of series. Kamachi can't write romance and he knows it, poor Rikou barely exists anymore. Hamazura has barely thought about her since NT started, he just thinks of ITEM as a group. <br><br>Which is actually really sad when you reread the whole "don't leave me" scene they had in the plane.</br></br></br>  Filthy delusional Kamikotofags are at it again.  <br>True it's completely possible this series will end with no romantic conclusions at all. Misaka and Accelerator having a non romantic partnership over Misaka and Touma having one would make even MORE sense than the romantic pairs</br>  I like Gunha for Mikoto. He's stupid enough that he'll piss her off all the time but he's strong enough to withstand the shocks. And really that's all Misaka wants in a man.  <br>Alright buddy. Not my place to get in the way of people's head canon I guess.<br><br> You do realize this series is almost certainly going to end with a whole "The Adventure Continues" as Touma yells Fukou Da as loud as he can while his pseudo-harem calls him an idiot in unison, right? It's an awful series when it comes down to it. </br></br></br>  <br>I just want Index to be relevant.</br>  <br> Index <br>Who?</br></br>  Where's my Delta Force trio bros at?  <br>Dead people can't yell.</br>  <br>WW3 shows that Kamachi could write a damn good ending if he wanted to, we just need to hope that he can pull something like that out of the bag again for NT  and then again for part after NT </br>  <br>Speaking of these magic gods why the fuck would Touma ever be a threat to them? Literally any idiot with a gun could kill Touma with ease.</br>  <br>Plot armour</br>  <br>The novel says Touma's not a threat to them.</br>  <br>Because they can't kill him without getting rid of imagine breaker, he's a very convenient container.</br>  <br> they can't kill him <br>Literally just fucking shoot him. His power is the ability to not be able to use any powers. A normal human is the easiest thing to kill.</br></br>  <br>Ssh, you'll summon the "durr durr TouMan can punch bullets" retards</br>  <br>He means in the sense that if you kill Touma, Imagine Breaker will go somewhere else, and they have no idea where it will end up. It's easier to keep it locked down in Touma.<br><br>Also Touma isn't a threat to Magic Gods, not sure what gave you that impression.</br></br></br>  When will touma stop being a faggot?  <br>Never. Thor will win the Toumab owl.</br>  <br>When Accelerator stop being edgy</br>  <br>That happened a while ago. He just puts it on now.</br>  Mikoto x Kuroko<br>Touma x Index x Othinus<br>Tatemiya x Itsuwa<br>Knight Leader x Kanzaki<br>Aogami x Himegami<br><br>Perfect ends.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto x Kuroko <br>Sickening.</br></br>  <br>But he's not edgy no more anon.</br>  <br>So touma ends up with worst girls? He may as well kill himself.</br>  <br> Knight Leader x Kanzaki <br>my nigga</br></br>  <br>But he isn't ending up with Mikoto.</br>  <br> people call Accelerator/Mikoto a crack ship when Mikoto/Kuroko and Kuroko/Touma exist </br>  <br><br>They belong together.</br></br>    <br><br>Harassing Fukiyose. Touma is throwing stones at her window to get her attention and Tsuchi, Aogami, Accel, and Shiage are playing in his band, doing a power ballad to try to get Fukiyose to fall for Touma. But she's just getting more pissed.</br></br>   mfw niggas actually taking the accel x misaka joke seriously   <br>The clones aren't that much different from the original biologically so we can say that he knows the original's body. And yes, there's implied rape.</br>  <br> Tsuchi, Aogami, Accel, and Shiage are playing in his band <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=98R<wbr>FrzTQQEc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>They're just so good together. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UUB<wbr>Q4qvtLlc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Misaka is shit but those two are worse.</br>  <br>They've definitely had butt sex.</br>  At least the people who actually ship Accelerator and Misaka seem chill.  <br>That fucking MAD is too good. The amount of effort put in must have been staggering.</br>  <br>If he fucked a clone, Last Order would know.</br>  <br>What happens in NT13?</br>  <br>Read the thread or search the archives</br>  <br>Fund it!</br>    <br>She is going to when Takeru ntr Index from Touma.</br>  Are people trying to shit up what started as a civil and chill thread because it said something they didn't like or  <br>Mikoto/Kuroko isn't really a crack ship. It's still not happening though.</br>  <br>They want him to join them.<br><br> TatemiyaxItsuwa <br> knight leaderxKanzaki <br><br>Accelerator xMikoto sounds like canon in comparison to those 2 shits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying LO doesn't </br>  <br>anon, it's nothing but a literal joke</br>  <br>That's because he did the original.</br>  Why is Accel so attractive  <br>He's actually pretty repulsive. Nothing likes to get near him</br>  <br>Crack ships are pairings that have almost no interactions like accel and mikoto. Kuroko has a crush on mikoto so there's a reason to ship it. It won't happen because mikoto is straight. The fact that kuroko is a joke character isn't relevant.</br>   tfw no more GROUP   <br> albino <br> attractive <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br> being a homosexual <br> any year </br></br>  <br>You fucking what m8<br>the only reason anyone would think that is because he purposely tried to act repulsive so people wouldn't get close to him, as he was scared of hurting people if they did. His behaviour really doesn't affect his appearance, so you just have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>No, a crack pairing is a pairing that is a literal joke and has no possible way of happening ever.</br>  <br> not being homosexual in the year of our 'bama 2015 </br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br>Are you faggots really this dumb or what?<br>I seriously ask, are index readers on /a/ really this stupid? <br><br> lel she gets told she's not for Touma so shipping is dead xD <br><br>She'll just powerup and help Touma or Touma will just tell her that she's not useless. It's fucking clear it's a goddamn "after we're through his we'll improve our relationship"<br>Unless Touma or she herself say that they won't be together it's just falseflagging.<br><br> Jesus christ you people are so dumb it hurts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then stuff like TWGOK happens and you fags lose your shit and act like it came out of nowhere.</br>  <br> tfw i actually miss kanzaki <br><br>Return to England arc when?</br></br></br>  <br>Except Touma was the one to mention her being a burden. The high priest jeered at Mikoto and made his comment worse</br>  <br>Accelerator is the most repulsive person on the show. The only people who don't find Accel repulsive are Touma and Kihara.</br>  <br>Next issue r-right?<br> ;_: </br></br>  <br>anon he's making a joke about his powers</br>  <br> Bad dude tries to stir shit up  <br> Totally not happening guise! ship is dedd lel </br></br>  <br>can't he just reverse the blood flow in the veins in his dick till he's erect?</br>  <br> ignoring the fact Touma said what made her depressed in the first place </br>  <br> Kamachi can't write romance <br>I mean most often sure, but the non fighting parts of NT10 were pretty good I thought. I think Kamachi more just doesn't feel like writing it more than he can't</br></br>  <br>You can't stop knight leader's love anon</br>  <br><br> Touma intentionally putting someone down. <br>I'm not even a shipperfag.

I just can't believe you are so dumb.<br><br>Bad dude does something. MISUNDERSTANDING happens, then Touma says he was just worrying about her getting rekt.<br>Misaka believes him but gets the fact that she actually IS weak. She gets power up in a few volumes and proves to Touma he doesn't need to worry about her.<br>It's so fucking cliche it hurts my fingers of typing it.<br><br>tl;dr Touma's dense and bad guy shenanigans never amount to anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto <br> powering up <br><br>That's as likely to happen as Touma recovering his memories of Misaki.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's still the least boring character in the entire show especially when he goes angel mode.</br></br>  <br>The joke has already been explained you have no excuse for continuing to be dense</br>  <br>I ship Touma with Mikoto. YOLO niggers, come at me!</br>  <br>I just don't see this happening. From the spoilers, it's all vague as hell which leads me to believe Kamachi is sinking the ship without outright saying it so people like you won't give up hope.</br>  <br> She gets power up <br>oh that is very unlikely and she would need a huge power up to carry herself among high tier magicians.</br></br>  <br> go for a walk <br> come back <br>Damn it. Aww man.</br></br></br>  Accelerator will be a single father fuck you faggots.  <br>Even as a nonMikotofag it's not unlikely at all, but certainly for the near future it is. Endgame I expect at least Accel Mikoto and Index will get power ups if not more of the cast</br>  <br>Level 69 breh...</br>  <br>More like this.</br>  I'd rather have Accelerator/Mikoto fans instead of endless<br><br> Othinus a best!!!111!!! <br> No Misaka a best!!!111!!! <br> Fuck you both, this random girl a best!!!11!! <br><br>Don't shit on them</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Endgame will be Demon Lord Touma, Angelerator and Hamazura in one of those godkiller robots <br>I don't think the heroines will play a role, at least not in the battle</br></br>  <br>Yes shipperfags are better than waifufags. <br><br>You might not have noticed but the thread is filled with endless shipperfighting.</br></br></br>  <br> A lolicon and shotacon dating <br>As poetic as it would be I don't see it</br></br>  <br>No, not in the main battle. There might be smaller battles going on elsewhere that the girls are handling. I see Index being around somewhere</br>  <br>Index will at least go Pendex at some point and since Mikoto has already shown the start of Level 6 in Railgun I wouldn't be terribly surprised if we saw more of it and what the hell being Aleister's favorite means.</br>  <br>Not at first. It was just people being kinda chill and discussing theories</br>  <br>I just don't see it.</br>  <br><br>Both Pendex and level 6 Misaka are less than failed gods and whatever Aleister and Laura are cooking is far beyond god-tier, unless both get a massive boost Othinus and Accel are better suited for those roles <br>at least in my opinion</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if they're not Magic God tier, there will almost definitely be some giant team up in the end game to beat the final boss, heck I'd be more surprised if it was just Touma and Accel to be honest. (We all know Othinus is going to die either next arc or just prior to the finale, neither she or LO are making it)</br>  so have we gotten any translations for NT 13 yet or is this gonna be a thing where we wait a week before anything happens and rampant speculation errywhere?  <br>I'd be a weird mix of both surprised and "Well I saw this coming" if Last Order dies before the finale</br>  <br> LO and Othinus dying <br><br><br>We got some, check the archives.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Othi and LO don't make it neither Touma nor Accel are making it<br>Something I see happening is both Accel and Beetle transcending humanity, magic and science, leaving Misaka as the strongest esper</br></br>  <br>mah nigga</br>  <br>Othinus yes but I don't see why he included Last Order. If she dies it will in the finale not before</br>  <br>That would leave Gunha as the strongest esper.</br>  <br> LO dying </br>  <br>I see all the level 5s transcending humanity, magic and science and being the next set of gods.</br>  What if Index dies and that's the finale?  <br>Yeah I'll retract that, either to kick off it or during the finale is probably where it'll happen, either way they're not making it out of the series was the main point</br>  We need a new thread, and I haven't seen one yet.  <br> We need a new thread <br>Why? There's no reason to have a thread up if there isn't anything new.

Do want<br><br>4 pages</br></br>  <br> Sucking dick this early in the day <br>Is it Thursday already /a/non-kun?</br></br>    Am I the only one who doesn't like Mikan? Shes just really gross to me, no idea why.  <br>Fuck your shit taste.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon. You'd look really gross to her as well.</br>  <br>Nah, I don't really get her role in the story besides to cockblock rito in that household. I mean I don't hate her and i'm turned on by her. But her presence is a hindrance to all Momo could be doing to Rito's dick and body as a whole.</br>  Needs more Yui? It always needs more Yui.  <br>This is literally happen with me and my imoutos well expect i scold her after to not wearing lewds outfit</br>  Threadly reminder if you don't have Mea (Nemesis Fused) as your waifu. You're a shit tasting loser.<br><br>The Smell Fetish, kinky, sexually-charged lick lusting Mea along with Nemesis's femdom, and "training"/teasing sex techniques. <br><br>Along with body shapeshifting to make breast bigger or any part of her body and phyco-dive!<br><br>Oh god, 10/10 Make you cum till you're senseless.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats the lewdest sentence i've heard all day! Yeah, so I haven't been on here for long.</br>  <br>I prefer pure Mea, no scheming behind the scenes. simply a bold and honest slutty girl.</br>  momo is probably the worst girl of them all. She's a beta slut and I didn't know that was possible  <br> peeking at imoutits </br>  <br>If you don't like momo then you have shit taste and aren't worthy of any of the girls.</br>  <br>So, what I gather from the spoiler pics, Mikan keeps her guard up in school, so there's not even an accidental panty peek, but when at home, she doesn't mind if Rito gets to see all her stuff?</br>  <br>One is supposed to feel relaxed at home, so its not like it doesn't make sense that she drops her guard.  Unless she is showing him intentionally. </br>  <br>What a good girl.</br>  Whats up with this art style for darkness S2?<br>How do they perfect everything but character design?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128076888 <br>1 view<br>don't do that</br></br>  <br>She's deliberately hanging out on his bed.</br>  <br>they realized they can't compete with Yabuki, so they stopped trying.</br>  <br>If you look closer... Mikan is in Rito's room so...</br>  <br>This, Yabuki's art is truly astonishing, and it's hard animating that shit. I worked as a trial animator and jesus fucking christ. The number of frames and amount of time to really duplicate something as good as Yabuki's art must take a lot of pateince. <br><br>Have a heart man, not everyone can make thinks as good as the original. Just cause it's their job, doesn't mean they don't have wiggle room to fuck up or do their own thing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Slut gagging for it.</br></br>  <br>You must have the shittiest taste in all the multiverses.</br>  <br>S2 looks like complete shit. The colors are bad and there's QUALITY everywhere.</br>  Episode 2 subbed, if anyone cares<br>[Doki] To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd – 02 (1280×720 Hi10P AAC) [79BA5BC5].mkv</br>  <br> censored </br>   Manga still not licensed in US <br> Canada NEVER </br>  <br>Just fuck already.</br>  <br> tumblr gif </br>  So has Mikan reached the "hang out in onii-chan's room" level of imouto?  <br>does it need to be pointed out every single time?<br><br>That's why I said, "if anyone cares"</br></br></br>  <br><br>I forgot how sexy Momo looked with her curly hair. Rito's future wife has to be Momo-hime &lt;3</br></br>  Only 4 pages... What kinda release is this ? Fucking Yabuki, always greedy on those pages.  <br> Darkness chapters are 50% longer than TLR chapters <br> this means Yabuki is cheaping out on pages </br></br>  <br>what a shit taste</br>  <br> 50% longer than TLR <br> comes out 1/4 as often <br>Yeah, he's being cheap.</br></br></br>   its a mikan chapter <br>Fuck yes<br><br>I hope the next actual release is a Nana chapter, its been awhile</br></br></br>  <br>shut up. Nana's not even worth mentioning, she's more pointless than Rito's Parents. She serves as the tsundere, nothing more, nothing less.</br>  <br><br>you know, there were 60 pages released two weeks ago, with 5 color pages.</br></br>  <br> as the tsundere <br>There is more than one</br></br>  <br>As the MAIN tsundere.</br>  <br>Hard to compare colored vs uncolored, but back in the day that'd be 4, 20 page chapters of of TLR for a total of 80 pages a month.</br>  <br><br>This was only for this month. He got that chap out in WSJ to promote the new season of the anime. Won't happen again anytime soon.</br></br>  <br>Yami, Yui, Rin, Nana<br><br>She was the last one to be introduced and is the most generic.... I still like her though.</br></br></br>  I wanna see Rito's mom nekkid. What about you guys ?  <br>How do you not like Mikan? I don't care for imoutos at all and still find her great.</br>  <br>you shouldn't only look at quantity.</br>  <br>I don't. I also didn't want to see Lala's mom naked.</br>  <br>A specific reason for that ?</br>  <br>Darkness has tits, I'll give you that.<br>But colored pages is rare, just like it's always been, and the plot is only slightly more engaging.</br></br>  I was in a Japanese shop recently to buy some hideous seaweed food for my sister and they were also selling the latest Jump SQ with Momo on the cover<br>Jesus christ, I never realized how ridiculously huge they are<br>Oh well, have some best girl.</br></br>  Just think, Rito will be pounding mea's pussy hardcore along with all the other girls. I hope Yabuki ends the series with a timeskip where He has at least one kid with all of them and the kids are fighting for Rito's attention....they're all girls.  <br><br>Fuck. FUCK.<br><br>This implies she actually WANTS him to see her panties, or that she just doesn't care if it's him? Because she protectes herself from the looks of other boys.<br><br>I NEED TO KNOW FOR REASONS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>TLR has the deepest lore.</br>  What's with the recent wave of fags criticizing everything? first it was that the art was bad and not the usual,when it was the same as always and now that Yabuki is being cheap.  <br>"critizing everything" how so ? Stating that the release of 30 pages a month is less than 80 pages a month (which is how it used to be), is factual. And if you consider it a critic, then it's only ONE critic. Stop being a drama queen.</br>  <br>I'd say her role is to be the character Rito has the least reaction to whenever he sees a naked girl.</br>  <br>Have you ever considered that maybe Momo needs to have a little less screen time?</br>  <br>When we got a chapter with 80 pages?</br>  <br> it's not a full chapter <br>WHY?</br></br>  <br>He is talking about one chapter per week.</br>  <br>Because is spin off magazine.</br>  <br>So he's using numbers from 4 years ago? that got compensated with better art?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Well way to be a fag like I said originally.</br>  <br>I thought TLR was the one adaptation Xebec didn't tend to fuck up with great amounts of QUALITY, but I guess that's changed.</br>  <br>She willingly went into the bath with her onii-chan and sat on top of him.<br><br>She clearly wants it, and badly.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Mikan doesn't even realize how thirsty she is for Rito.</br></br>  <br>Yabuki's art would have improved regardless.</br>  <br>Damn, you're dense as f*ck. It's what we were discussing, and if you consider it a critic then so be it, it's your problem. So basically you're criticizing people who talk about something which you haven't even taken the time to read.<br>Good job.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, this is getting ridiculous.</br>  <br> censoring yourself <br><br/></br></br>  <br>Yeah but without nipples,suggestive poses and hidden vaginas.<br><br>Dense how? you're using numbers from 4 years ago,that don't even apply to the actual serie,in another magazine,with worse art and without nipples,as an argument to criticize Yabuki for less pages this month, the fact that we got a normal chapter, plus another one in WSJ,plus this one in this other spin off magazine,and we haven't even got the RAWs for the chapter of this month, that means that he is still drawing shit,how is that cheap,lazy whatever you want to call it?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother he is underage scum.</br>  <br>So Mikan has reach the point of teasing Rito sexually on a regular basis</br>  <br>Realistically, sisters don't care what you see so long as it isn't necessarily them fully nude. It's often meaningless to see their pants.<br><br>But, knowing what I know about this series, the significance of this chapter is probably those things you said.</br></br></br>  <br>Momo is the KEY to the Harem Plan.</br>  <br>No,the KEY is Lala,because without her there's no harem.</br>  <br>Oh, yea, you're right. Marriage to Lala makes polygamy possible. So, Momo is instead the catalyst.</br>  <br> Realistically, sisters don't care <br>You're wrong. I have 2 imoutos who get embarrassed when I spot out a pair of their underwear somewhere on the floor.</br></br>  <br> Realistically, sisters don't care <br>You do not understand females.</br></br>  <br>Rito has to marry Lala to become the King of the Universe and escape basic laws of planet Earth</br>  But incest is immoral.  Momo is a cuck  <br><br>Not him but I agree with this anon <br>When is my turn to wash the clothes, my sister doesn't care if I see her underwear or not.</br></br></br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br>I had the same experience when I was still living with my mother and sister.</br>  <br>Why is Mikan such a whore?<br>Oniichan should have scolded her more.</br></br>  <br>Riko's Rikos are much bigger than that.</br>  This manga sure went trashy when the author decided to go full pandering and actually make Mikan into a brocon for the incest fuckers.  <br>When was that?</br>  <br>its cute how she's so concious of her panties being exposed at school, yet didn't care when its exposed to her brother</br>  <br>DEEP ONII-CHANN</br>  <br>Mikan's not my favorite girl, but I would ravage that little slut in the bed right then and there.</br>  <br>Like chapter 1</br>  anyone familiar with moonspeak can tell me if this link means that there's no TLRD next month ? http://jumpsq.shueisha.co.jp/sq/yok<wbr>oku.html</wbr>  <br><br>He did have his nose up her vag <br>And he fingered her asshole <br>And he was her panties for ~8 hours<br>And he hit her in the face with his dick<br>And their naked bodies have pressed up against each other numerous times<br><br>Just seeing her panties is nothing now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> b-but I'm not ready to kiss you, Lala! </br>  <br> And he fingered her asshole  <br> When did this happen?</br></br>  <br>he kissed her in the pussy twice though</br>  <br>Exactly; Rito's an idiot.</br>  ITT Anime girls you'd like to fuck  I'd fuck her so hard, she would scream for more cock like a slut she is.    <br>What the fuck? That's not what I was posting.<br>MOOO--<br>Oh.<br>Posting the shameless slut I want to fuck again.</br></br></br></br>  𝑻𝑨𝑨𝑯𝑲𝑬𝒀  <br>All of them</br>  <br>Holy shit, I just left that thread.</br>  It must be very soft  Fucking a gun would feel weird, but that's one sexy gun.
