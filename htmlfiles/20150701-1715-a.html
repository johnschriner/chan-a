It has been 2 years since the PV that showed that already made a good part of the work for god sake.  <br>Anon, I..</br>  <br>Except that we all know that Takeuchi was just practicing for Saber during Turkeyhandle.</br>  <br>Oh god, non glasses shiki really has that alpha MC look</br>    <br>Are you trying to imply Saber existed at that point in time?</br>  <br>Well, that's because those are Shiki's eyes on Nanaya' hairstyle.</br>  <br>Takeuchi's whole life has been one prolonged attempt to create the perfect Saber.</br>  No montage comparison with the original VN ? I'm interested.  <br>Not really. It's Nanaya with new stylish glasses <br><br>Do you Fatefags not play Melty Blood at all?</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou use Shiki glasses <br> Shiki uses Shirou glasses </br></br>  <br> whole life <br>Actually his life went like this.<br> create the perfect Valkyrie <br> create the perfect maid <br> create the perfect woman to admire <br> create the perfect waifu <br>In that order.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's with his fingers only having two articulations ?</br>  <br>Modern Shirou is a rehash of MB Nanaya's hairstyle. I mean, just look at Shirou before MB Nanaya showed up. Looks like a ginger lesbian with a pseudo-crewcut.</br>  <br>Oh look, white haired Shiki.</br>  <br>He also now hates air intakes unlike Koyama who let Aoko keep hers. <br><br>I say be rid of him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sexy af</br></br>  <br> a ginger lesbian with a pseudo-crewcut. <br>Fuck, why did this make me laugh so hard.</br></br>  Any information about which software they'll use and its resolution ?  <br> he adds an ahoge to Shiki, a MALE character <br>Not really fun at all.</br></br>  <br><br>TAKEUCHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIII</wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh my.</br>  <br><br><br>I do not know how to feel.</br></br></br>  <br>IKEMEN AS FUCK</br>  Why do they all have the same face  <br>Looks like a lower quality copy of Gil, except with the generic school uniform.</br>  <br>KiriKiri as always, should be the same resolurion as Mahoyo.</br>  <br>You mean black haired Archer.</br>  <br>Because it's true.</br>  <br>Are you ready for secondaries and underage edgelords circlejerking over Shiki as being "ZOMG MOST ALPHA MC EVARZZ!!!1!1!ONE BC HE FUXS BITCHS LIKE I CANT AND HE COULD SLIT UP HIS PARENTS AND TAKE SHIT FROM NOBODY LIEK I WISH I COULD"? <br>Are you ready to see idiots throwing the word 'alpha' around the way people who've graduate high school would use a comma? Are you ready for 20 fucking simultaneous threads of this because mods stopped believing in quality control?<br><br>Oh the excitement is killing me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  should be the same resolution as Mahoyo. <br><br>Which was ? Only played FSN and HA, did they used Kirikiri as well ?</br></br></br>  <br>Post a picture of it</br>  <br>He's supposed to be sexy ? Looks like #152 MC edgy faggot.</br>  <br>Gilgamesh's hairstyle is almost like a spiky flat top.</br>  <br> implying secondaries read VNs <br>Wait till the anime adaptation is announced in 2020</br></br>  <br>Wait a minute.<br>Ah fuck he did god fuck everything.</br></br>  <br>We're not seeing much of that until the anime. That's when I'll start worrying.</br>  <br>Are you retarded. We're talking about a VN remake, not an anime adaptation, what you're talking about will never happen.<br><br>Until an Ufotable remake that's it.</br></br></br>  <br>Try again.</br>  <br> not liking ahoge on men <br><br>Are you a faggot or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes they did, TM has also used KiriKiri since Tsukihime. Also I think it was 1024×576.</br>  <br>Damn fuck. That's really fucking ugly hair. What was Takeuchi thinking when he drew Fate?</br>  <br> remake <br>What?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>no</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>No.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>General TM thread probably I gues</br>  Is Kiritsugu in this?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127407972 <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Wasn't Tsukihime on Onscripter like all of the 07th expansions VNs ?</br>  <br> Anime adaptation is announced a year or so before the VN releases <br>I don't believe you.</br></br>  <br>Eh ded.</br>  Is this the Len thread?  <br>Sorry I made a mistake, I meant Tsukihime Plus Disc.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> thinks that tsukihime get a anime adaption  <br>you can wait 3 more years for the remake designs for roa and nero</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Indeed. Tsukihime was Onscripter. After that, they switched to Kirikiri for Kagetsu Tohya and Fate/stay night. After that, I think they made their own program for Fate/hollow ataraxia.</br>  <br><br>Let me dream</br></br>  <br>F/HA was KiriKiri as well, same with Mahoyo.</br>  <br>Good, I like those a lot.</br>  so no release date yet ?  <br><br>I'm pretty sure F/HA is still KiriKiri, unless they modified KiriKiri to add whatever they wanted into the engine.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait. If Shiki is now Nanaya by default, why can we expect for Nanaya?</br></br>  <br>Kagetsu Tohya was Onscripter too, I know because I played it with an Onscripter emulator</br>  <br> Implying that's nanaya <br>He's missing the shit-eating grin he had in melty, and the crazy look in his eyes</br></br>  <br>Same year as Kizumonogatari and Hoshi no Samidare's anime adaptation</br>  <br>So yeah, fate/vampires thread.<br>Is this new seibah clone likeable at least?</br></br>  <br>and girls work</br>  <br>Post more Len.</br>  I'd fuck him  Watch as it takes place in 2015 and shatters any semblance TM has of a timeline  <br>I almost forgot about that. Holy shit</br>    <br>It's better if you did.</br>  Sasuga Takeuchi  <br>Which Len?</br>  <br>Too hype for the new scans and not in the mood for best/worst grill shitposting, so here's your reply.</br>  <br><br> If Shiki is now Nanaya by default <br><br>I'm not sure how you came up with that. <br><br> why can we expect for Nanaya? <br><br>We can't be sure Nanaya will get a sprite or a CG, his only full appearance in Tsukihime is one battle in Kohaku's route. They might give it a cool CG (maybe really hype it up like they did with Sparks Liner High in RN).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sasuga takeuchi</br>      <br>I don't really care. Just let me fuck Sion. Fuck muh lore and muh consistency.</br>  <br><br>Len the Great.</br></br>  <br>All Lens are good.</br>  <br>All and every Len.</br>  <br>Yes, he does look more like Proto-Saber than he does Shirou.</br>  Len for cutest maid.  <br>This all started when Takeuchi copied Nanaya's hair for Shirou, because his original design looked like a ginger bulldyke <br><br>If we just think about it, Shiki never changed. This was his same design back when MB games were still being released.<br><br>It's Fate's fault for having shit early designs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tsukihime Remake <br>silly anon you cant make a REMAKE of something that DOES NOT exist<br><br>change the title to "tsukihime is getting an anime adaptation"</br></br></br></br>  <br> ahoge on men </br>  <br>Anon leave this thread</br>  <br>This <br><br><br>But it's not.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Anon please.</br>    It feels like I've been waiting a decade for a Sacchin route.<br><br>Oh wait, I have.</br></br>  Takeuchi wouldn't give Len a miniskirt, right?    <br>Of course not.<br> He wouldn't give arc one either, right? </br></br>    <br>Are you ready to wait for two more?</br>  <br>You and me both anon</br>    <br> Jack Frost's face on the corner boxes <br> Jack in a box <br><br>god dammit</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see a reason to give up now if I've held on this long<br><br>FSN remake with Caster and Fuji-nee routes on the other hand, thats just wishful thinking on my part.</br></br></br>  <br>my dick</br>  Wish /a/ played Melty Blood.

You're supposed to get better by learning what to block in actual matches and practicing combos in training room.</br>  <br>You got your memes mixed up anon</br>   they're sticking more dead apostle and other vampire related stuff in fate spinoffs <br>Watch as remake Tsukihime is going to reference Fate somehow.</br>  <br>I guess I need to just try more, but it's really discouraging and I feel bad because I'm obviously not giving whoever I'm playing against a fun match.</br>  <br>It's not fun getting bodied, unless you're masochistic  Like me <br>In reality though it's the fastest way to learn, it's just real rough</br></br>  <br>You're so moe anon.</br>  <br> Shiki <br> top tier anything <br><br>No. Only good males are in Fate franchise and KnK.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong. Anime fighter fans enjoy slapping the shit out of newbies to make them better and then when they're an actual match, it's even more fun.</br>  <br>Like how Type Moon now is Mooncell? It's only understandable when your flagship franchise is more relevant.</br>  <br>List them.</br>  <br>What an outrageously large complex. I could never get over how we were suppose to buy that.</br>  Non comedy Tsukihime and Fate Crossover when?  <br>This, to an extent. It's one of the greatest feelings when somebody who you've stuck with since they were a scrub can finally hold a match to you. Even a better feeling when they can consistently beat you after some time. It gives me motivation to get better.</br>  <br><br> inb4 Shirou <br> inb4 flamewar </br></br></br>  <br>This looks like a Federal Embassy, not a Western mansion.</br>  <br>Kotomine.<br>Any Rider or Lancer<br>Gilgameshx2<br>Willy Wonka<br>Araya Souren<br>Archer<br>Flat<br>Arthur<br>Jeckyll <br>Andersen<br>Sir Kay<br>Gawain<br>Jets<br>Richard Lionheart</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Top bait.</br>  <br><br>I guess I just need to suck it up and get to grinding. I have a real life friend who's pretty good at Melty and some other anime fighters (unib, GG) so I'll see if he wouldn't mind beating the shit out of me for a while.<br><br> I said what I said about unfun matches out of personal experience. The only game I've ever played to the point of being competitively decent at is Smash, and when I play people significantly worse than me I feel a mixture of boredom and remorse at completely bodying someone who never had a chance. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Find a good friend to play with. That is at least how I managed to improve since it stings less when you lose to a friend instead of a random opponent. And as  put it, it is a great feeling when you start to improve and play even matches.<br><br>But you will eventually have the satisfaction of knowing you've gotten a lot better.<br>I'm not even close to decent now (I think) but it is miles above from when I started.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot Avenger and Fake Assassin, my apologies.</br>   RELEASE DATE WHEN <br> RELEASE DATE WHEN <br> RELEASE DATE WHEN </br></br>  <br>he doesnt even need to list because he is a bland edgy faggot and shikifags proving again how the love to selfinsert into him this thread is proof enough</br>  <br>Ok, not bad. I expected far worse.</br>  <br>How is it bait? The top 20 of best male type moon characters were Fate only in last official poll. KnK males are ok too, but Fate is the only series with developed guys. Tsukihime has self insert, self insert best friend, backstory adults, random antagonists you have to beat.</br>  <br> Araya Souren <br> Chocolate Man <br> Top teir TM men </br></br></br>  <br>Yo man fuck C-Ryougurt</br>  <br>I forgot most of Apocrypha Servants and Masters. I'll only nominate Mordred's Master and maybe Achilles as truly cool. Karna too.<br><br>The only tsukihime male I care about is Wallachia.</br></br></br>  <br>neither is shiki</br>  <br> The top 20 of best male type moon characters were Fate only in last official poll <br> using popularity as an argument </br></br>  <br> punishing that whiffed super with a grab </br>  <br>They were entertaining.</br>  <br>I was talking purely in looks, though.</br>  <br> http://steamcommunity.com/id/PKMNTr<wbr>ainer/</wbr> <br><br>Not that anon but here's mine. I'm not very good but hopefully it'll still be fun.</br></br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>Where in my post was I saying Shiki is better?</br>  <br> ignoring the other arguments <br><br>Tsukihime is a waifufag series, none of the guys is very compelling. Fate despite trying to pander to waifufag started as a husbandofag series so the roster is more balanced.</br></br></br>  <br> the only character with actually good redesign is a POV character we'll never fucking see in the VN <br>Sasuga</br></br>  <br>Why is Sakuya so best?</br>  <br>They're making Shiki hot this time around so we'll have husbandobaiting too.</br>  <br>Ryougi's last arc is awesome but I love catchng the knife in the air too much to play anything other than half moon</br>  Again this shitty novel? Well, the remake is going to be shit, like Mahou. So yeah, fuck this.  <br> H-Moon ryougi <br>My man. Throwing the knife, catching it, then using an EX-throw is so much fun.</br></br>  <br>Keeping old replays is both cringeworthy and calming.<br> holy shit i can't believe how shit i was what the fuck was wrong with me <br>I have a replay of right when i had started playing and watching it gives me shivers</br></br></br>  <br> implying anyone here has read Mahoyo </br>  Just saying that if ANYBODY wants to, feel free to add  for some games and stuff. I'm not the best, but it's still fun to play  <br>Try again.</br>  <br>I tried reading some of it but my moon isn't advanced enough.</br>  <br>I love H but i always do better with C<br>Hopefully i will one day be able to get my shit together and figure out F</br></br>    <br>Cornelius was too tsun for Touko</br>  <br> The top 20 of best male type moon characters were Fate only in last official poll. <br>That's because the last TM Poll was Fate only.<br><br> KnK males are ok too <br>You have to be baiting with this response, KnK males are not even interesting and are just generic villains (Souren, , generic nice guy and gears.<br><br> self insert, self insert best friend, backstory adults, random antagonists you have to beat. <br>Oh geez, it's like Fate didn't have those as well.<br><br>Tsukihime's male cast might be edgelords but they are at the very least better than KnK's.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Managed to get through it with two years of study.<br> Touko is a fucking bitch. </br></br>  <br> Implying that was a bait <br><br>Tsukihime is literally a self insert novel. A 100% eroge. With no deepth or value behind. Only waifushit, bad written hentai, and a stupid protagonist with no personality whatsoever. Even Fate has more to offer.

Go waste time on something you like.</br>  <br/>  Is there really going to be a remake? Or is this thread just wishful thinking?  <br>Yes. There will be one, unless type moon decides to cancel it.</br>  <br>remake was already since 2008 announced</br>  <br>Sometime in the next 5 years.</br>  <br>Announced in 2008. <br><br>We'll probably see it in 2019.</br></br></br>  Where are the rest of the scans?  <br>http://z13.invisionfree.com/Mobius_<wbr>Space/index.php?showtopic=248&amp;st=13<wbr>5</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>The old one was plenty fuckable too.

It's never worked for me. Just crashes when I select networking. I've never cared enough to fix it but hearing you guys talk about it kind of makes me want to.  <br>http://www.meltybread.com/forums/me<wbr>lty-blood-auditorium/cccaster-v1-0a<wbr>-netplay-client-for-mbaacc-1-4-0/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>You need to use CCCaster for starters. <br>http://www.meltybread.com/forums/me<wbr>lty-blood-auditorium/cccaster-v1-0a<wbr>-netplay-client-for-mbaacc-1-4-0/<br>Make sure melty is updated to 1.40. Also there are no matchmaking servers so maybe thats why you were crashing</br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  Okay, so I finished KnK and the F/SN VN, although I didn't really like it other than Heaven's Feel. Is the UBW anime or movie any better than the VN version? Also, I got locked into Ciel's route and finished that, I think I'm getting locked into Akiha's route now. It's early in the story and I've been picking every Akiha choice, is there a flowchart or a way to tell which route I'm going into?  <br>There is, check the install folder for Tsukihime. You got locked into Ciel's route because you chose to meet up with her early on in the game, it happens.</br>  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Ah, I think I found it, Thank you.</br>  <br> Ciel-senpai <br>But anon, her ribbon is the first-years' color.</br></br>  <br>You can go arc route after meeting ciel. <br><br>You just need to answer some different things. <br><br>I chose to meet her at the beginning and then made Arc route anyways, got true ending and good ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does he look so much like Potter Kun?</br>  <br>He doesn't, are you fucking retarded?</br>  <br>He really doesn't to be honest</br>  <br>They probably changed the colors.</br>  <br>Recommended route order is Arcueid&gt;Ciel&gt;Akiha&gt;Hisui&gt;Kohaku</br>  <br>He's not more hot than Shirou. Real hot characters are Archer, Gilgamesh, the Lancers, all the pretty boys from Prototype.<br><br>He's just cute, nothing too impressive. If he were to look like Diarmuid or Rameses, you'll have a point.</br></br></br>  So, wanna play Melty Blood while we wait?  <br> only two maids clean all that </br>  <br>He's better looking than Shirou if the reactions of the females I know are anything to go by.</br>  <br>butthurt selfinsert shikifag detected</br>  <br>2019, if we're lucky</br>  <br>Poor Kohasui</br>  <br>If wouldn't impossible, just tiring.</br>  <br>Not him but I don't know how this correlates. Don't you think if your average anon would want to self-insert he'd want Shiki to be average looking?</br>  Ahoge looks good on everyone regardless of gender  <br>That makes no sense. Why would I want Shiki to be hot if my intention was to self insert?</br>  <br>Well most of the mansion doesn't get used. There's only four people living there including them. All they really have to do in 95% of the place is dust from time to time most likely.</br>  <br>Clearly you have no idea how selfinsertion works.</br>  <br>I just hope new Shiki isn't the inconsiderate fuck he was in the old Tsukihime.</br>  <br>No but I'd let Shiki self-insert himself into me</br>  <br>I'm down for some games anon, can you host?</br>  <br>I'm the worst person at fighting games since all I do is button mash. I barely got past story mode on easy.</br>  <br>To be fair, not really self-insert. But Shiki seems fun to be hanging out with.</br>  I am excited to see the new shota Shiki  The cutest.  <br>Disgusting cat monster.</br>    <br> dat huge scar </br>  <br>so basically delinquent version shinji?</br>  Are the issues of TYPE-MOON Ace worth it? Considering buying it for myself, but I was wondering if it would be better to just wait for scans.  <br>If you can read moon, yeah, but if you can't, it's better just to wait for the scans.</br>  Fuck, marry, kill.  <br>Are you stupid?</br>  <br>I pick actual best looking MC<br><br>Comes in two flavors</br></br></br>  <br>Dudes can't marry dudes.</br>  <br>Fuck and marry Shiki, befriend what's his face and ignore Shirou.</br>  <br>Mai nigga.</br>  <br>Marry Shirou<br>Fuck Soujuurou<br>Rape Shiki</br></br></br>  <br>This is the only correct answer.</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Fuck Nanaya.<br>Marry Shiki.<br>Put Shirou out of his misery.<br>Befriend Soujuurou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck Shiki<br>Marry Soujuurou<br>Kill Shirou</br></br></br>  <br>He's the only TM protag that was raped so far, so his odds aren't too bad.</br>  <br> shiki <br> raped <br>uwotm8</br></br></br>  <br>Now they can in 'merica.</br>  <br>Try to remember all the sex scenes in the game, you should come to at least three where he gets violated the first time around, almost all of them are by Kohaku, and a few of them are the Len dream where he dreams of being dominated.<br><br>Even if you forget about the dream ones, you should eventually come to the one I'm talking about once you give it some thought.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean just Hisui. Kohaku does some sweeping and that's it.</br>  <br>Nope, still forbidden love in the parts of the world that count.</br>  <br>The one where he got drugged?</br>  <br> Kohaku does some sweeping and that's it. <br><br>Confirmed for not reading enough.<br><br>Kohaku does all of the outsides regularly, does the cooking and gardening as well.<br><br>Hisui does all of the insides basically, and all of the detail work.<br><br>Kohaku used to do the insides, but she always got too overexcited while sweeping up and tried imitating karate moves with a broom, which ended up with things being broken. Akiha wonders if its her subconsciously taking a certain something out on her. Because she was too disastrous, Akiha left Kohaku to deal with the outsides more where she couldn't break anything. Kohaku also maintains all of Akiha's work and that old shack where Shiki used to live.<br><br>I think Hisui does some other things as well.<br><br>They used to have some other maids and helpers, but Akiha fired them all before Shiki arrived for certain reasons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it might have been the one where he was unable to get out of bed and Kohaku ended up blowing him by force, or the first half of his love making with Kohaku where she took the lead big time.<br><br>Guy also dreams about being violated by Kohaku as Akiha watches a few feet away at one point that was pretty femdom.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, fuck.<br><br> No wonder I was able to get off to Tsukihime's scenes, but not Fate's. </br></br></br>   2nd Len H-scene   So basically it's 2000 something all over again where you have a couple dozen threads about this until Nasu goes lol jk right  <br>Was it the footjob?</br>  <br>Looks like Archer with Shirou's color palette.</br>  <br> "ZOMG MOST ALPHA MC EVARZZ!!!1!1!ONE BC HE FUXS BITCHS LIKE I CANT AND HE COULD SLIT UP HIS PARENTS AND TAKE SHIT FROM NOBODY LIEK I WISH I COULD"? <br>That's literally all the Shiki fans thus far. They are cancerous as fuck.</br></br>  Fate/Alternative<br/>  <br>Daily reminder the Mahoyo dude was stronger than both Shiki and Shirou combined before coming down the mountain.</br>  More like SHITki, amrite?    <br>Is it time?</br>  <br>Sakura did the same thing in her H scenes as Kohaku did in the beginning of her big one.<br><br>She took the lead big time, and rode Emiya around the room as he could barely keep up. Thus foreshadowing the fact that she was Rider from the future, if the purple hair wasn't a big enough give away.<br><br>It was only be the third of fourth sex scene that Shirou started trying to take the lead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SO COOOOL, I want to be him omg.</br>  <br>No.</br>    <br><br> tohYES </br></br>  <br><br>To complete the trio.</br></br>        There are technically others  <br>Shouldn't his eyes be green?</br>    <br>Now make his skin dak and get hipster Avenger.</br>  <br> Every Shiki fan <br>10/10</br></br>      <br>Fuck, they ruined Sacchin's hair.</br>  <br>So she's the heroine who'll  be brutally murdered by Nrvnqsr or SHIKI in order to drive home the danger and gore? </br>  What if they give Shiki a badass theme like they've got for Shirou? Will we get a Nanaya equivalent of EMIYA? NANAYA ost when?  <br>But Shiki and Nanaya both have themes already, pretty good ones I might add. One is Sex music and the other is Megaman music.</br>  <br>This is as much of an opportunity as any to get back into shape with PS.</br>  <br>Has the extra bonus chapter for the Tsukihime manga ever been translated? If not, does anyone still even care?</br>  <br><br> Megaman music <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PAe<wbr>IMQierX4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>now give him tits</br>      <br>Urobuchi doesn't really strike me as an Akihafag. He seems more like a Cielfag.</br>    <br>What does cooking have to do with cleaning the house? Hisui is masterrace maid. Kohaku is just cooking an occasional meal and growing her poisons.</br>      <br> Has the extra bonus chapter for the Tsukihime manga ever been translated? <br>No. Someone promised to translate it years ago.</br></br>      <br>Kohaku isn't just cooking, I even explained what she does around the house and we see enough examples of her doing other stuff in the game. Shiki even helps her in the gardens and sweeping the outsides at one point as she has a lot of ground to cover.<br><br>She cleans the outside areas, she's just not allowed to clean in the inside anymore since she might break something. Hisui does all the insides and anything detail oriented, Kohaku keeps the outside of the house clean, keeps that shack running(not a high maintenance job), does the gardens, and does the cooking.<br><br>You say "just", but Kohaku does a lot more than Hisui at that rate.</br></br></br></br></br>              <br>It's just the actual epilogue from the game.</br>              Shiki's harem management skills are truly top class. I can't think of anyone else who could do as good a job as he does managing so many extremely dangerous women that would still want to kill each other even if they weren't competing against one another.    <br>No anon, there's original content.

Even if he wasn't dense enough to consider it, he's eventually planning on leaving Rin behind to wander the world as a seigi no mikata. They're enjoying their happiness in the short-term while it lasts, but eventually Rin will settle down as a clocktower mage and Shirou will go off to chase his ideal. There's no real future for them, outside of a few meetings here or there.<br><br>This is remedied somewhat in Fate/Extra where it's implied Rin traveled with him, but the UBW epilogue seems to imply otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean you clearly didn't watch the episode<br>Or are you doubting the Word of Rin ?</br></br>  <br>Jesus censor that shit.</br>    <br>Stay mad wormfag.</br>  <br>It's this guy again.</br>  <br>but who is the blue man?</br>  <br>She touched her hand.<br>Hatesex confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Shirou wears a cardigan.<br>Rin wears a polo.<br><br>When did everything change?</br></br></br></br>    <br> UBW Shirou was Archer all along <br>That Shyamalan twist.</br></br>    <br><br><br>easiest bait ever</br></br></br>  <br>After Rin started buying him clothes.</br>  <br>he's finally making the right choices for once</br>  <br>This new bait pics are already becoming useful.</br>  <br>I think it's Shinji<br>don't know why he's there</br></br>  <br>I want to see Rin an Luvia having ravenous hatesex as they furiously scissor one another.</br>  <br>That Nasu was actually self inserting into Tohsaka's anus?</br>  <br> mfw bait </br>  <br>I don't buy that, though. While Rin may be able to make Shirou take value in his own happiness, he's still ultimately going to pursue his ideal. Since it doesn't seem like Rin goes with Shirou to fight ISIS, and he doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of guy who'd take a break from his ideal to visit his waifu, I just don't see it ultimately lasting.<br><br><br>It's never stated, in F/E Archer just says that he was accompanied by a stalwart friend and an understanding lover. Most people think it's either Issei or Shinji.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Being in another man's girlfriend's cell phone's contact list </br>  <br> I don't buy that, though. <br>Well that's your bad because this was as close to an author statement as you possibly get without a omniscient narrator<br><br>But it's always nice to see headcanon get crushed by Nasu</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of get where your getting at, but like I feel as though that they both love each other dearly and Rin isn't the type to let go of him</br>  <br>But where is Saber going to get her magic semen?</br>  <br>Is it possible that in addition to having the Mystic Eyes of Petrification, Rider also has the Mystic Anus of Overwhelming Lewdness, which has the power to give anyone who views it lewd nightmares about her?</br>    <br>I feel like they would fight to see who makes the other cum more times, and reinforce their ladyparts to last longer.</br>  <br> 3DPD </br>  <br> secondaries </br>  she is angry because people think she won't stay with Shirou forver  <br>Is green his color?</br>  <br>I like how you left out the part where Rin and Shirou both agree he'll likely have the same outcome as Archer, and then Rin explains that she plans to settle down at Clock Tower but will travel with Shirou temporarily just to "get stuff out of her system." <br><br>Rin wants them both to have their happy endings, but their paths are different. The entire episode was about Shirou wrestling between settling down at Clock Tower (choosing a path alongside Rin) or becomine a seigi no mikata, the same path as Archer. He chose seigi no mikata.<br><br>There's a reason their agreement ends on a handshake and not on a hug or a kiss and Shirou is depicted as alone in the symbolic ending. He made his choice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't exactly strike me as the kind of guy who'd take a break from his ideal to visit his waifu <br>Are you saying he will go back on what he just agreed on, because that's your head canon?<br> I don't buy that, though. <br>Sure ignore what they both agreed on.<br> Since it doesn't seem like Rin goes with Shirou to fight ISIS <br>And she stated she was going to go with him, not seeing her in a symbolic scene makes no difference.<br><br>You really need to stretch it to keep your headcanon going, but that's fine because it shows how concrete the ending was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I like how you left out the part where Rin and Shirou both agree he'll likely have the same outcome as Archer <br>I like how you are leaving out that she says that he will surpass Archer, and the symbolic ending shows that. I also love how desperate you are, bending the whole context to fit your head canon.<br><br> There's a reason their agreement ends on a handshake and not on a hug or a kiss and Shirou <br>Because it's a serious conversation about their future. That agreement is as clear as day, he will pursue his ideal but at the end settle down for their happy ending.<br><br>I am giggling if you aren't baiting, this is a whole new level of sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Most people think it's either Issei or Shinji <br>I don't really know what to believe though, I mean "a stalwart friend" makes a lot of sense because of Issei's personality, but I can't really see Shirou telling him the truth about mages and shit out of fear of getting his friend killed one day<br>Shinji would make a bit more sense but "stalwart" isn't really something I would see him as, unless he changes as he grows up and stops being an egotistical and vain douche</br></br></br>  <br>It's implied that he will grow in HA.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>kill yourself</br></br>    <br><br>I think Clock Tower Shirou is even more swole than Dadruto.</br></br>  <br>Important to know that the japanese text directly implies a "male friend"<br><br><br> hug/kiss <br>Because they are japanese in a japanese show made for japanese people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh. that's actually kind of interesting considering his character personality. Also because he's a douchebag. and a piece of shit.</br>    <br>The thumbnail mad me think it was Eren Jaeger before expanding it.</br>  <br>Renaming your shit doesn't mean no one will notice.</br>  <br>In HA he wants to leave his house because he knows it's full of shit. Shirou agrees because he knows Shinji will manage as long as he puts his head on it.</br>  <br>get out of here Saber no one likes you</br>  <br>Go back to sleep, Arturia</br>  <br> Shirou cums inside Rin <br> Saber sucks it out of Rin's Vagoo. </br></br>  <br><br> What is Avalon </br></br>  <br><br>Nice.</br></br>  <br> Ciel <br>Didn't see that one coming<br> CCC is canon? <br><br>Also, reminded me of this</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Saber sucks it out of Rin's Vagoo. <br>By scissoring</br></br>  <br>Certainly not a place that you can travel to from London by bendy bus.</br>  <br>Most boring place on earth.

She acted very mellow and very direct in showing her interest in the MCs dick in this UBW thing.</br>  <br>I hope you are a descendant from a major Japanese Yakuza family or you are toast.</br>  <br><br>Not only do they end up together, the bone of Shirou's sword ends up turning Rin full dere.</br></br>  <br>I like to swin<br>Ill swin with taiga,</br></br>  I would fight off a whole yakuza army to be Taiga's man.   everytime I lose an argument online.   <br> her interaction with Shirou she seems absolutely obnoxious and annoying <br>Dude what?</br></br>  <br>She is a shy tsundere.</br>  <br>Surpassing Archer means accomplishing more as a seigi no mikata, not abandoning the path and treating it as a vacation. Rin and Shirou both say flat out that Shirou's result will be the same. Shirou says he can't change his ways. No where does that agreement imply anything like you are saying, it's just Rin's wish for them both to find happiness. <br><br>Stop missing the point of UBW and its theme because of shipfaggotry.</br></br></br>  <br> My headcanon will prevail </br>  <br>Except Shirou saw what would happen and he even admitted it was hell.<br>He will enter the hell, but atleast he will enter hell with his waifu.</br></br>  <br>how romantic</br>  why can't they just cancel fate and do more KnK.  <br>Doesn't print as much money.</br>  <br>waaaaah...???</br>  <br>Doesn't this heavily imply that he will indeed find his answer eventually?<br>Or am I missing something?</br></br>  <br>Nah he fucked all that was said there was wishful thinking.</br>  <br>Even then the episode ended on a very positive note with them both agreeing on a happy end, even Rin who was so opposed to the idea was sure Shirou wouldn't end up as bad.<br><br>Just a few episodes earlier she was screaming in anger at EMIYAs way of life, I find it very unlikely she would let Shirou end up the same way, especially after the promise with archer.</br></br></br>  <br>horribly underrated post</br>  <br>You are talking to that one Sakurafag who absolutly hates UBW and Rin</br>  <br>Why would he just pretend to argue like that, what a meanie.</br>    <br>I take you weren't hear 2 or 3 weeks ago?<br>Before EP 24 he was arguing that Rin only loved Archer than Ep 24 and 25 destroyed that argument so he switched to this</br></br>  <br> Escort explaining mana transfer technique to elementary school girls </br>  <br>I just got around to watching the last episodes now, I was a little disappointed by the first episodes of season 2 which is why I took a little break. <br><br>Now that I'm finished though, I'm pretty satisfied with the adaption, the filler parts were really bad, but the final battles made up for it.<br>The Hogwarts part was pretty damn good too.</br></br></br></br>  holy fuck you autistic shits go outside this board is actually cancer  <br> this triggers people here  <br><br>Typemoonfags are pathetic.</br></br></br>   there will be no more Rin till the HF adaption <br> she will never be as good as L O N D O N waifu Rin <br>Literally no reason to live whatsoever.</br></br>  <br> F/Z <br>Bad start, good middle, bad ending.<br><br> UBW <br>Good start, bad middle, good ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You'll get to see the strongest Rin in action, and she gets a lot of development in HF.</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br>HF Rin literaly doesn't make sense with how Ufotable adapted Rin's adventure in Zero.</br>  <br>What? why?</br>  <br><br>Fate/Zero had a great start. Ur dumb.</br></br>    <br>In the LN Rin completly fails and it traumatizes her so that she decides to not try impossible things anymore.<br> That part actualy neatly set up Rin's mindset for F/SN </br></br>  <br>Watch they will make Rin completely tame compared to the VN.</br>  <br> F/Z <br> Good start, good middle, decent ending. <br><br> UBW <br> Good start, bad middle, great ending. <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It'll be one 90 minute RN movie anyway.</br>  <br>Saving Sakura is not only impossible, it brings danger to everyone.</br>  <br><br> good start <br>Maybe if you're a secondary that doesn't know shit about how the HGW works. <br>If you read the VN or LN the first episodes feel incredibly slow and redundant. It'sundeniable that Zero suffered from pacing issues, especially when it was airing. <br>Having to watch five episodes until the series starts to pick up is not a good start.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 90 minutes <br>Any source on this?<br>I'm a huge UBWfag, but even I will be disappointed if it's only 90 minutes.</br></br></br>  <br>That's my point, it's hard to develop character with that. Parts will be cut and I am sure her going against Shirou at the start will be cut.</br>  <br>My ass<br><br>But as you see in F/SN before HF and in Ufotable's F/Z Rin has a disposition to try to do the impossible which in the LN was dampened by her failure to save anyone</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love if the movies made the characters harder to relate to, really pulling out all the dark shit they hide. <br>They are magi after all, they live surrounded by death and have to constantly shoulder the burden of really tough life choices, tey should really be as mentally fucked up as the Zero HGW participants.</br></br>  <br> there will be no more Rin till the HF adaption <br>You retard we have Fate Illya Prisma season 3 this summer season!</br></br>  <br>It's a movie the highest it might go is 120 minutes.</br>  <br> prism <br>I'd rather read Fate route 3 times in a row.</br></br>  <br>Remember how Rin's traits are optimism (F/Z) and perfection? <br>There's a reason why optimism was only present in Zero, her parents death showed her how cruel is the world of magi and that she would get herself killed if she continued to be that innocent.</br></br>  <br>Yes that was added by the Butcher later. It's perfectly fine not to have it and I guess UFO didn't deem it that necessary.</br>  <br>I thought they'd do multiple movies like with KnK</br>  <br>That's not confirmed and it's pure speculation.</br>  <br>Prisma RIn doesn't do justice to her VN/Ufo counterpart.<br>I'll only watch Prisma for the occasional good battle and to see who wins the Shiroub owl.</br></br>  <br>It's going to be hard to keep that with a movie especially when the viewers are coming from F/Z and UBW.</br>  <br>Rin's past was pretty much a blank.<br>Completly inverting what she "learns" from that part of F/Z was stupid.<br>I mean it works somewhat with UBW and Fate but not with HF.</br></br></br>  <br>Her actions are justifiable without that. You are right that they should have kept it as it helps.</br>  <br>Prisma Rin has some pretty okay moments in 3rei.</br>  <br>Shit, we might get this side story this season. Maybe.</br>  <br>There's something incredibly cute about dense Shota Shirou and Foolhardy Loli Rin.</br>  i never see these posted in rin threads and i have no idea why  <br>I think her command seals are on the wrong hand.</br>  <br>Because her command spells go in the left hand. This pic is an insult.</br>  Anime Expo is this weekend. We should get to know about the localized sets for UBW if anyone's interested.  <br><br>idk man it's better than being anatomically incorrect</br></br>  <br>Better than HF.<br><br><br>Prisma Rin has pretty much already won.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There</br></br>  <br><br>How was it impossible when the grail system could have been destroyed, thus eliminating the Shadow and most of the issues the series has, plus she can survive hellish torture even before merging with AM, making getting the last soul jar in her heart an arduous but totally doable procedure?</br></br>  <br>Bitch, get your goddamn shoes off my bed before you get my sheets dirty. Why are you even wearing shoes in what is supposedly a Japanese house?</br>  <br>Noice</br>  <br> Japanese house <br> implying it's not her house <br>Why are you in her house anon? Are you a rapist?</br></br></br>  <br>If it's a daki, then Rin is supposed to be in your house. The product is sold in Japan.</br>  So I wonder where she's getting the money from to attend uni?  <br>Money from patents her family owned.</br>  <br>That's where she gets the money for gemstones.</br>  <br>She's not exactly a poorfag Luvia. Unlike you who fucks old fat men and dogs for free.</br>  <br>Patented Kama-Sutra manuals. Geared towards old men.</br>    <br>Everytime I see her name I always end up hearing it said in Kirei's voice</br>  So what was that letter Shirou had in his pocket?  <br>fuck off newfag</br>  <br>Invitation to join the Mages Association.</br>  My additional food portions.  So why is Luvia perfectly okay with flirting with a guy already in a relationship, much less in front of the other girl?<br><br>This isn't HA or Kaleid-verse we're talking about, Rin has been thoroughly jackhammer'd by now and they're even shacking up. Yet Luvia still does it with without a care.<br><br>Who does that?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A slut, that's what.</br></br>  <br>Luvia is a whore.</br>  <br>Luvia wants to cuck Rin.</br>    <br>Luvia isn't going to let some other bitch steal her husbando.<br>You'd a failure as a lover if you wouldn't do the same for you're waifu.</br></br>  <br>This. FAYTON</br>  <br> Ufo counterpart. <br>They fucked up Rin's characterization in romantic scenes, turned her to a generic tsundere, making everything seem like a joke. Only the final episode handled her character well in that regard.<br>Ep 25&gt;prisma rin&gt;ufo</br></br></br>  <br>Go to bed Cooking Priest.</br>  Luvia is an alpha bitch and she's going to prove it by cucking Rin by stealing Shero and showing him pleasures he could only imagine in his lewdest nightmares  <br>Luvia is a strait up bitch. This is the kinds of things Bitches do.</br>    <br> implying Luvia didn't win the fight </br>  <br>no</br>  <br>I think it strikes a good balance of hope and despair - Rin being the source of hope and Shirou still being unsure of himself, but choosing to rely on Rin for as long as he can.<br><br>If you think about it, Fate ended on a very high note too. Then Nasu revisits it years later and basically says Shirou lived a really shitty life before making it to Avalon. UBW is most likely the same, where Shirou is going to live a really fucking shitty life due to his broken nature, but at least he'll always have a home to return to.</br></br></br>    <br> She didn't though </br>  Rin suddenly does this to you.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  Takeuchi confirmed in TM Ace that Grand Order's main characters were designed to be genderbent Shirou and Rin.    <br>Die</br>  <br>I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH EMIYA-CHAN.</br>  <br>There is no indication that Rin won. After Rin punched Luvia in the gut, they continued fighting for several seconds. It then cut to Rin complaining about how Luvia wouldn't go down, indicating that Luvia won the fight.</br>  <br>You not bullshitting?</br>  <br>I want to suck the dick of Rin.</br>  <br>Why would I and it was pretty fucking obvious already.</br>  <br>Just want to make sure. Bunch of idiots have been denying it every time it gets brought up.</br>  <br>King Arthur pleases Shirou for magical energy!</br>  <br>fShirou makes a cuter girl than Rin, but mRin is still not as cute as Shirou<br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br><br>When the guy fucks with his pants on.<br><br>I hate it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Guaranteed fucking post limit hit along with posting a Kyoani character so why the fuck not. /a only talks about like 5 things anymore and I can probably list them right now:<br><br>Fate<br>Kyoani shows<br>Shaft Shows<br>Light Novel adaptation flavor of the season<br>Fanservice fetish topics that cycle over and over<br><br>Every other kind of thread pretty much dies within an hour or two.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At least we get less naked man-ass that way.</br>  <br>Because mRin doesn't look like Shinji duh.</br>  <br>I never wanted to see this</br>  <br>The question now is, will they fug?</br>  What kind of music is Tohsaka into?  <br> Rin is Shinji and Asuka's child <br>It all makes sense now.</br></br>  <br>maybe the same what tokiomi liked</br>  <br>What did Tokiomi like?</br>  <br>Classical, or oldies I'd bet. She'd only own vinyl, too, but that's just because he wouldn't know how to use a CD player.</br>  <br>It's perspective, but her fingers look really odd</br>  <br> that's just because he wouldn't know how to use a CD player. <br>She would know, those are old as fuck.<br>She would suck at using her cellphone, mp3 players or music streaming sites/apps.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be into jazz and soul, especially with female vocalists because lesbian fantasies and shit.<br>Pre 80s rock and pop would agree with her tastes, and also classical of course.</br></br>  <br><br>I can imagine her listening to some Nina Simone, or even some Carole King or Laura Nyro.</br></br>  <br><br> implying a Japanese teenage girl would listen to American Jazz <br>dufuq. Tohsaka would clearly only listen to classical. Perhaps J-pop as it was getting popular in the early 2000s. Maybe the Beetles and such as well.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be a lot into brit music</br>  <br>Not that guy, but Jazz is surprisingly not unpopular in Japan.<br><br>My old piano teacher toured there with his wife a year or two back.</br></br></br>  Prisma Rin is a qt.  <br>It was a draw anon.</br>  <br> Watashi wa CIA </br>  <br>She seems more of an airhead even though she is suppose to be Rin's clone. My guess is some of her brain went into her breasts.</br>  <br>Really? Bless Takeuchi. Now the idiots who denied it can fuck themselves.</br>  <br>She doesn't even know where babies come from.</br>  <br>Dammit<br><br>Why must Prisma treat Shirou like nothing more than a sex toy?</br></br></br>  <br>She looks better in red</br>  <br>He's pretty okay in 3rei.</br>  <br>Exactly, to me it seems like they replaced Rin's teacher personality for a Rich OHOHOHO airhead. Their similarity is as good as Rin and Sakura's.</br>  Rin with Shirou-mode Archer in TM ace  <br> but at least he'll always have a home to return to. <br>Though I agree that he will have a path that's hard and full of mistakes as Rin said. I do believe she will accompany him on the journey, because she said it.</br></br>  <br><br>Which plush is that, and are there versions of it with Rider instead?</br></br>  <br>Why is it cut?</br>  <br>She said she'll eventually return and settle down, but will still be there for him to return home to. Shirou will most likely go out on expeditions by himself for the rest of his life, or maybe until he gets too old to do so.</br>  <br>Early preview</br>  What a shitty series and fanbase.<br><br>You should all be ashamed of yourself for watching or playing this garbage.</br></br>  <br> She said she'll eventually return and settle down, but will still be there for him to return home to. <br>She doesn't say this. She says that in the end she will return there that doesn't specify when either.</br></br>  <br> Trying to bait franchise that has been around since /a/ has been a board <br><br>0/10<br>At least try</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't the same without the construction noises at the end.</br>  <br> Hotgun wedding. <br><br>And who would be hlding the shotgun in that wedding.</br></br></br>  <br> She says that in the end she will return there <br>So... she does say it.<br><br> doesn't specify when either. <br>Simplest explanation is that she'll wait for him, otherwise she'd say she'll return when he does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I found this if it helps.</br>  <br>You know, I didn't expect to see that again. I really just cropped that out of Ch 9.6 of 2wei.</br>  <br>She was talking about on the context of herself accompanying him, so yes in the end could be the end of his journey too. After that she goes talks about their happy ending implying it's for both.</br>  Did Issei get NTR'd?  <br><br>Issei already has Ayako, he don't need no slut.</br></br>  <br>Nope, she is going with him until the end. She is going to settle down after they reach their happy ending.</br>      <br><br><br>Damn these nips work fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>MTSP Jin</br>  <br>Fuck you to all the people who said it was supposed to Shiki and Sacchin, or that it was Kiritsugu, or whatever other reference you pulled out your asses.</br>  <br>I guess that's one interpretation of it.

It turned out he didn't just have one, but several, and they all either left him, betrayed him, or screwed him over in some way.</br>  <br>Oh right.

Is it getting animated?  <br> Be Kessala <br> 1 province start <br> Nearly wiped out by the Abyssinian Kingdom for too much raiding <br> Holy Wars against the Jews save the land <br> Form Nubia through unending war <br> Be nearly destroyed by the Fatimids three times <br> Get saved by Byzantine Empire thanks to three generations of marriage alliances </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sword NTR is truly the most fucked up in thing that has ever happened in Fate.<br><br>You just don't do that man.</br></br></br>  <br>Not canon. <br><br>Also I hate how much the mangaka hates Sakura, she was a non-existent character and then she appeared and is a villain.</br></br></br>  <br> Tokiomi would realize how fucked up this ceremony is going to make his Territory, and they work together to destroy the Grail <br> Tokiomi  <br> doing anything that makes sense <br>You almost had me there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you really want El Cid to be turned into a chick who looks like Saber?</br>  <br>How is TM making money off of this mobile game anyway?</br>  <br>No, it's just official art of masters with different servants.</br>  <br> Not canon. <br>Nasu would like a word with you.</br></br>  <br> He would have shit compatibility with him and would end up in a situation where Archer manipulates it for his own advantage. <br><br>Exactly, so he would probably win the War. Don't forget that a serious archer can end the war in a matter of days if he acts true to the name of his class, according to F/HA.<br><br><br> Archer could not Win against Saber or Iskandar tho. <br>Shirou using Archer's techniques could win against Saber, so Archer is more than capable. As for Iskandar, there isn't much he can do against Archer's hrunting sniping.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably the Puzzle &amp; Dragons approach with a magic stone time currency.</br>  <br> Not canon. <br>Nasu<br> &gt;Also I hate how much the mangaka hates Sakura <br>She is shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lancelot is basically the ultimate counter to UBW if you think about it.</br>  <br>He would do it because his pride wouldn't be able to stand the idea that he'd been suckered and that everything was going to be destroyed.</br>  <br> could win against a Saber not trying to kill him <br>fixed<br> isn't much he can do against Archer's hrunting sniping. <br>blow them all up with lightning easy</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't now about hrunting. <br>Saberfags always say that Archer is weaker than saber so I thought it was true.</br></br>  <br><br>Shielder does things to my dick</br></br>  <br>So it's going to be a normal VN except for battles which are card battles or something?</br>  <br>It's not. Lancelot can't do anything against broken phantasms.</br>  <br> Also I hate how much the mangaka hates Sakura, she was a non-existent character and then she appeared and is a villain. <br>How do you know he hates her and didn't just want to give her first big appearance impact? I'm a pretty Sakurafag and I'm loving it.</br></br>  <br>I assume it'll be like Million Arthur or something where there's a story mode.</br>  <br>Saberfags say many things<br>A lot of it wrong</br></br>  <br>I liked her even when she was just a thumbnail in the Side Material.</br>  <br>From what's translated, you pick like, five servants for a team, and there's a battle system based on that. There's supposed to be a heavy story emphasis though, with more than a million lines of dialog.</br>  <br>IIRC they also revealed a new Archer, supposedly the Chinese Dude who shot down 9 suns,<br><br>Scan is too big to upload here unfortunately.</br></br></br>  <br>IF he knows how his powers work he could bait JETS and purposely give him a broken phantasm that is about to explode.</br>  <br>Nah, you're just being a Sakurafag; aka autistically defensive of the character beyond logical reason. Even the Saberfags don't complain about her being a fodder in Prisma. What else, are you also going to complain about how Carnival Phantasm hater Sakura as well because they got her character wrong?<br><br><br>Hell, her Berserker outfit is fantastic and I want a fig of her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> blow them all up with lightning easy <br> Implying <br><br>Alexander's bulls can't even do anything about Caster's monster and their lightning can only be aimed downward.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Archerfags say many things <br> A lot of it wrong </br></br>  <br>The big question is  will the story mode feature romance? </br>   Luvia with puppy doll Shirou <br><br>I want that doll</br></br>  <br>Depends on if you're willing to pay extra</br>  <br>She's better written than the other two so much that she stops Shirou from going on his suicide seigi no mikata path.<br> Unless you mean the fact that's TOTALLY her fault getting raped I don't get why she would be shit. <br><br>People that hate Sakura are just boring because none of them have an argument against her. <br>It's just <br> muh worms <br>Or some other bs trying to fit parroting what other haters say.<br><br>It's pretty clear that they didn't understand Heaven's Feel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber can break hrunting head on with a normal attack.</br>  <br>Wait a fucking second. So Luvia knows Shirou in the Case Files universe?<br><br>That actually raises some implications.</br></br></br>  <br> Pay for heroine route <br> Versus play free P&amp;D game <br>Is this even a question?</br></br></br>  <br>High Jump is a universal constant. Not even a 1% divergence can change it.</br>  <br>Luvia won the Sherou in Case Files?</br>  <br>No she doesn't. It's just a gag.</br>  <br> Nah, you're just being a Sakurafag; aka autistically defensive of the character beyond logical reason. <br><br> People can't have their own opinions!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>Why are you so mad?</br></br></br></br>  <br> That rose on Shielder's shield <br>Someone from the War of the Roses confirmed.</br></br>  <br> She's better written than the other two so much that she stops Shirou from going on his suicide seigi no mikata path. <br>With the ufotable adaption, we now know Shirou doesn't go down that path in either Fate or UBW.</br></br>  <br>What if I don't like Sakura just because she's boring. It's literally just a matter of taste. And just to get this out of the way<br> shit taste <br> no u </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Luvia should only really know Shirou in the UBW universe.<br><br>Just saying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She "knows" him like Haru knows her "prince." She only knows him as that mysterious cafeteria boy who saved her one time from a crazy magical experiment gone wrong.</br>  <br>NPs:<br><br> El Cid - Not Dead When Killed <br>Rider charges against his target. As long as Rider remains sitting on his horse, Bavieca, he cannot be killed, or even slowed down, no matter how much damage he might take.<br><br> El Campeador - Not Killed When Dead <br>Should Rider die, a curse affects all involved combatants immediately afterwards, muddling or even erasing their memory of his death. Depending on their own uncertainty, a vision of Rider can appear before them and even attack them as though it were real. If all other remaining Servants are fully convinced of his presence at a same time, Rider can be brought back in to the War by the Grail.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So this wasn't Fate/Labyrinth?</br>  <br>You are right but this fight is futile on /a/. Bandwagoners are never going to stop bandwagoning, illiterate people will not stop being illiterate, and retards will never stop blaming her for shit that isn't her fault.</br>  <br>It's just a one panel gag, don't think too hard about it.</br>  <br> blow them all up with lightning easy <br><br>Archer usually finishes before the enemy is even aware they're being targeted. See https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=U7n<wbr>0e5XMV-Y</wbr>  [ ]<br>Saber couldn't even notice it. Archer is more than capable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's definitely not a rose. If anything, the shape of the shield being a cross is a bigger hint to her identity.</br>  <br> she stops Shirou from going on his suicide seigi no mikata path. <br> dies anyway </br></br>  <br>Even if he doesn't go to the clock tower he is still involved in the magic community.<br>There paths could easily cross.<br><br>Especially if he is still besties with Rin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up, at least Sakura exists, in Prisma. This asshole hates Saber so much, she never appears in any form other than the crappy Alter one. Fucking IIyafag I hope he drowns in lolis and dies.</br>    <br>Jeanne is the only good Seiba clone.<br><br>Hell, the Seiba archetype is practically a Joan D'Arc clone.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck that noise. <br><br>Give me my Rider Washington.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Galahad more likely<br>Her Armor's color scheme is even reminiscent to Lancelot's even,</br></br>    <br>I JUST WANNA BELIEVE SHE'S NOT A GENDERBENT GREEK, ANON ;_;</br>  <br>Saber notices it before Shirou without looping. Rider detects Hassan throwing a dirk in Fate/zero. Archer spending an hour charging an attack will be noticed easily.</br>  <br>Why do the number go from 135 to 141, does that means there are way more alternate teams or they are counting the canon ones?</br>  <br>I need better scans of this fluffy Shirou.</br>  <br>Don't be stupid<br><br>That's just Chef Dog</br></br></br>  <br>She's not even a Saber clone aside from having blonde hair. Everything else is pretty different.  Though originally she was designed to be Saber, then they made her a Saber for a spinoff, then they made her Ruler. </br>  <br>I like that he's smiling. That's London in the background, right?</br>  <br>Ulysses? <br><br>He can be almost any Servant if that is who he is.</br></br></br>  <br>He looks like a generic old school Fire Emblem archer.</br>    <br>Except he does, he himself says so and we see him doing it in the end. The fact that Rin's there doesn't mean shit because we SEE what happens to him. <br><br><br>Then don't try to force your reasoning on others. She's a great character</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like it. Apparently the issue did contain Takeuchi's adventures in London and apologizing to King Arthur for what he did with his image.</br>    <br>Will she ever win Sherou?</br>  <br>Just reposting stuff<br>Stuff that will be in Strange Fake 3.<br><br> Anyway, we're getting a third protagonist in the third volume according to Narita. <br> One of Faldeus' men apparently. <br> Zelretch can't directly act in Strange Fake since him acting will make the world line definite, but Narita is strongly hinting that Alcatraz will, and he's very connected to what Franceska's true identity is. <br> Some revelations on what was meant about Gilgamesh and Enkidu's "monster hunting" quote that was mentioned in one of the previews. <br> Gilgamesh being confirmed by Narita as having Clairvoyance like Merlin so so it seems like he can use it to see other parallel worlds, but it looks like the Throne of Heroes adjusts his memory and knowledge according to what world he's summoned in so he doesn't get confused. <br> Also seems to be some other hints about what the workings of the Greater Grail are actually based on from the thing I just mentioned. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Legendary Archer that saved millions <br> Crimson Bow <br><br>Calling it, he's that Chinese general who shot down 9 suns during the Xia dynasty and pursued immortality in a similar way to that of Gil.<br>Though here he looks like a character straight out of Trails of the Sky or Y's</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She won in UBW</br>  <br> Searches up Galahad after you mention it <br> Wikipedia page <br> CTRL+F "shield" <br> "Significantly, in the narratives, Galahad is associated with a white shield with a vermilion cross, the very same emblem given to the Templars by Pope Eugene III." <br>Fuck. If the design on her shield were red, I could believe it. Guess she's Aias, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then don't try to force your reasoning on others. She's a great character <br>That's literally the first time I've posted about Sakura in this thread. Stop boogiemanning.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure all would be forgiven if Arthur started appearing more.</br>  <br>She's not Greek either, anon. <br><br> She's St. Catherine of Siena. </br></br></br>  <br> Hell, her Berserker outfit is fantastic and I want a fig of her. <br>Damn straight. That midriff in particular is to die for.</br></br>  <br><br>how you fags can like sakura i just can never understand, her problem isnt the worms, its that shes boring as shit, with an occasionaly yandereing until she goes full retarded, she didnt do shit for shirou besides going woe is me the whole of HF</br></br>  <br>She lost hard.</br>  <br> male king arthur </br>    <br>Jeanne makes more sense as a Seiba than "Artoria" does. She was factually real, factually a girl and factually a devoted person who would be all about MUH HONOUR incessantly.</br>  <br>Only in the universe where Kiritsugu takes him with him to Europe and he leaves him in Finland and obviously doesn't come back.<br><br>She get enchanted by him as child and ask her family to hire him as a butler.<br><br>Too bad there is higher chance of Shirou becoming Archer than that ever happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want more servants that aren't from the British Isles, France, or Seibah clones  <br> Except he does, he himself says so and we see him doing it in the end. The fact that Rin's there doesn't mean shit because we SEE what happens to him.  <br><br>That scene was symbolism you idiot. It was to imply he went further than Archer, like the dialog right before that scene.<br><br> "After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland. <br> Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt. <br> Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking). <br> Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope. <br> Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait. <br> The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance. <br> (To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)" <br><br> He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Such a shame he'll lose to some Saiba clone in the end. <br><br>Also SMITE has Houyi, his ultimate attack makes suns rain on you. Pretty based</br></br></br>  <br>Just don't question Fate logic, and it'll all be good.</br>  <br>I wonder if she murdered Zouken and took over the family trade or something. She looks stone cold there.</br>  <br> Jeanne <br> Real <br>99% of what's said about her is wrong, especially anything in regards to her fighting.</br></br></br>  <br>Boring.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure True Archer and Rider are Esau and Jacob now that we know Archer has blood red skin.</br>  <br>Rin dies after a few years because she got showered in grail mud.</br>  <br>Not me, I love western europe mythos.</br>  <br>Any evidence or reasoning for that?</br>  <br><br>I thought  was Hou Yi because he's got that sunburst under that massive shading cloth.</br></br>  <br>She ate a gem before that. She's good.</br>  <br> The fact that Rin's there doesn't mean shit because we SEE what happens to him.  <br>We don't see the end of his life.<br>It's entirely possible he settles down later in life, similar to Fate Shirou.</br></br></br>  From BL about Grand Order:<br><br> Alright. One turn is divided into a tactical phase, command phase, and enemy reaction. <br><br> In the command phase, you draw five random cards made up of a random selection of quick, arts, and buster, with the corresponding Servant illustration on them. Picking cards from among these is basically the equivalent of commanding the Servant illustrated on that card to perform the corresponding action.  <br><br> Tactical phase is when you make some preparations, for example, using skills, or Master skills as back up and healing, and Command Spells.  <br><br><br> Now there are five cards per Servant for a total of 15 cards in a deck. And you can basically chain types of attacks together.  <br>But I don't really care about the specifics. <br><br> Now the Ascension thing we saw in the earlier images was basically some form of Servant evolution. If we can some certain items, we'll be able to ascend them to a higher level of existence, and there are apparently four stages of that, with the visuals changing. <br><br> So we have the normal Nero, and then by ascending her we get the Nero with the special arm armor she had on in one of those cards. That's apparently her final evolution also. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No she's not. That's bullshit and you know it. <br><br>She'll last 15 years maybe because she's stronger than kerry and the gem, but that's it.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a smile worth protecting.</br>  <br>Stop reply to obvious bait</br>  <br>Cool fanfiction bro.</br>  <br> Cross-shaped Shield <br> Survives the Fire that burned down Fuyuki <br> A life-saver and protector of innocents rather than a killer warrior </br></br></br>  <br><br> She's better written than the other two so much that she stops Shirou from going on his suicide seigi no mikata path. <br><br>That's funny, it's like you think Sakura is a well-written character because another character has one of their most defining moments in the same route that she's the heroine. You can't just put Shirou coming to accept that his ideals are flawed as an achievement of hers or anything - the only thing she did in Heaven's Feel was be a damsel in distress and then the final villain. <br><br>Oh, and, Shirou never ends up as Archer in any of the three main routes. He gets his happy endings in every route, actually, regardless of the heroine. <br><br> People that hate Sakura are just boring because none of them have an argument against her.  <br><br>Because she's the least developed romantic counterpart for Shirou by far. She just appears in the first three days and you are expected to immediately fall in love with her the way Shirou has already fallen in love with her prior to the start of the game. You only ever see her worst parts - her sluttiness, the dickworms infesting her every inch of flesh, her inability to save herself, her dark side brought out by Angra Mainyu possessing her, making her a whiny and vindictive bitch. <br><br>One of the best moments in Heaven's Feel is the climax where Rin - absolutely correctly - tells off her sister like she deserves, beats her in the fight, and then spares her anyways because she loves her in spite of her flaws. That doesn't make Sakura look good, it makes Rin look amazing. In fact, all the best moments of Heaven's Feel are for other characters than Sakura. She's just a prop to be the damsel Shirou must save, first from other characters and then from herself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH BABY YEAH I LOVE WORMSLUT DISCUSSIONS, YEAAAH.</br>  <br> She's just a prop to be the damsel Shirou must save, first from other characters and then from herself. <br>Hit the nail on the head. That's how I've always seen Sakura, as a catalyst for change and not much of an actual character. She's there so Shirou can be forced to change his ideals, and to start up all the trouble in the route so that the other characters have time to shine. Sakura just never interested me.</br></br>      <br> young Taiga <br>What's the point?</br></br>  <br>There're also plenty of Greek Servants as well.<br> Heracles <br> Medusa <br> Alexander <br> Chiron <br> Atalanta <br> Achilles </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is it too much to ask for a single -- /single/ -- canon line from her?

New yuru yuri thread, and please dont bother shitposting just because you're butt hurt. So who is objectively the best Yuru? and why?  It doesn't sound like you've really got your goals in line there  I like Ayano. I don't know why.  <br>um we are gonna talk about who is the best yuru, which is Kyouko, shes cute and funny and gets all the grils</br>  <br>I like Ayano. I don't care why.</br>  <br><br>Because you can relate to your crush being totally oblivious to your affections?Or is that just me?.</br></br>  I really want to  _hug_  Akari  I like Sakurako because she likes pokemans and doesn't afraid of anything  What a great way to start a new thread.  <br>I know. The threads in general have been pretty ghostly recently.</br>  <br>We could always make weekly threads instead of daily ones.</br>  <br>That probably would be better and would actually give us stuff to talk about</br>  <br>/ag/ ANIME GENERALS WHEN</br>  <br>you mean /a/?</br>  <br>Maybe because you fags had 24/7 generals not too long ago because of s3. <br>It was really fucking annoying. <br><br>Fucking never, and for good reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br> going a week without yurus <br> mfw </br></br>  <br>I don't know. I downloaded the raw manga and remembered that I can't actually read japanese.</br>  <br>Someone seems a bit upset<br><br>I can read to some extent but usually can't really translate it to what the fuck its supposed to mean</br></br></br>  Is it illegal to watch Yuru Yuri on a plane?  <br>every yuru is best yuru op</br>  <br>Not what weekly means. I had /yys/ in mind when I said weekly, the thread can stay up as long as possible but no new threads are made until a week passes.</br>  <br>If only there was an easier way of doing this.</br>  <br>Why would it be? It's 2D.<br><br>Now if you're watching it in 3D space, we have a problem.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, that's some true dedication right there.</br>  <br>oh, well in that case it seems like a gravy idea</br>  Are you yurifans satisfied? Was the ending good enough for you?  <br>Neutral here. I think yuri fags score a massive win over hetero fags. No doubt about it</br>  <br>I am. It could be better but it was good.</br>    I MISS KUMIKO ALREADY  Wow, OP.<br><br>There was another untapped Hibike! thread somewhere in the catalog and you plowed right through it.</br></br>  <br>i was expecting a bit more, it kinda ended without ever explaining anything. did they get to go to nationals or no? <br><br> <br>shitichi's glum face in the scene right after this was priceless.</br></br></br></br>  I HATE YURIFAGS  <br>apparently so does  Kyoani </br>    <br>It was good but it wasn't really an ending. There needs to be a second season.</br>  <br>What a gay picture.</br>  I didn't watch this, but tell me if Shoe-kun won  <br>What?, how dense are you?.</br>  <br>He had this scene, so you be the judge.</br>  Wait, so what happened? I admit, I didn't watch the show at all, in the slightest, but went to the threads anyways. Who won?  <br><br><br> someone winning in a kyoani show <br>Mochi doesn't count.</br></br></br></br>  Well that was nice and all, but there better be some kind of sequel or that's going to stand as an extremely weak ending  <br>No one. Anime ended the same way the first volume of the novel did.</br>  <br> reina holding her own hands <br> yuri </br></br>  <br>Short answer, no one<br><br>Long answer, Shuichi, see </br></br></br>  <br> her own hands <br>I'm not even a yurifag, and I'll still say you're retarded.</br></br>  <br>Shoeitchy got friendzoned so fucking hard, it's a riot! Hetfags are doing their silly little dance of damage control, but LOVE WINS once more!</br>  <br>Crunchyroll lied<br>Romance died.</br></br>  <br>CR pls leave</br>  Was hoping for atleast a kiss.  The ending wasn't anything for anyone.   Open end <br> yurifags somehow win <br><br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br><br>#NOMATTERWHATHAPPENS<br>#LOVEWINS<br>#REINAISGAY</br></br></br></br>  Look at those nice thighs. Yuri should be illegal.  That was like a promise for a second season, right? or at least a movie or something? I think just a movie to cover the nationals competition would be pretty good.  <br> KyoAni <br> Kiss <br><br>First timer?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko shuns the guy and the ending is Kumiko and Reina holding hands tightly<br><br>how is that an open end?</br></br></br>  What was her name again?  <br>It's an end that basically means yuri, but plays it safe by not being explicit.</br>  <br>Opal-chan</br>  Hey did you guys know that anime was based off American cartoons?    <br>why is Maki playing a euphonium?</br>  <br>Because Reina still loves Taki and the point is hammered home when she looks all hot and bothered the moment she sees him wearing his classy tuxedo, which means there's no fucking conclusion to any romantic loose ends. Shuichi still wants to bone Kumiko but doesn't get anything. Reina still wants to be boned by Taki, but doesn't dare to approach him and thus had not even a chance of getting rejected. And whatever you believe it is that Kumiko wants in regards to romance, she didn't get it either. That's how it's an open end.</br>   We got to hear the entire song <br> They animated the shit out of all of it <br>Aside from like 10 seconds of background CG, that was a phenomenal last episode. Obviously I want another season, as that was only a fraction of the entire story, but as a first season that was great.</br></br>  <br>There isn't going to be a 2nd season.</br>  <br>Those ugly feet. Yuck!</br>  <br>Midget-chan</br>  <br>How do feet look in your world, anon?</br>    <br>This.</br>  good ending, though they didnt explain anything, obviously they are going into then nationals. Kimiko said "our piece goes on" which mean they made it. It leaves it open for a season 2. I read that the studio will pull a k-on on this show and bring it back next year. I hope its a full on 25 episodes. Great show, enjoyed it to the last minute. <br><br><br>http://when-will.net/anime/1333-wil<wbr>l-there-be-sound-euphonium-season-2<wbr>-release-date.html<br><br>^ not sure how reliable but its something.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>D E N B T S<br>E<br>N<br>B<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The ponytail scene was better than a kiss  <br>The "our piece goes on" was already a fucking confirmation in my book.

They will play for anime and video game osts  <br>He didn't collect all the light orbs</br>  <br>Calm down Reina.</br>  Can somebody repost that list of the songs they played in each episode? Would be much appreciated.  Holy crap, bassoon-chan is hot.  Nevermind, found it in the other thread<br><br/></br>  Does their friendship remain constant throughout all of the novels?<br><br>I enjoy the bond they have. <br><br><br>Shuichi, please.

Everybody kept going on about right fagott and missed this beautiful talent right under their noses.</br>  Emerald best girl.  <br><br>This is a background character.<br><br>A background. Character.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm in love.</br></br>  <br>I kinda like how they did some of the interactions like that. Felt a bit more realistic than usual for anime (except for the finger on the face thing, who does that shit?).</br>  <br>Reminds me of other best girl.</br>  I think most people have been noticed before, but there's the little twintail cutie in the bottom right too.<br><br><br>Yes yes, you get a sticker for being first. But this last shot was an unusually flattering one. Like... smoking hot.</br></br></br>  <br>the hardest body<br><br>the mightiest contrabass<br><br>the strongest girl in all of japan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking hell by the look of that pout she must like Shuichi.</br>    <br>What does R. O. stands for?</br>  Sensei definitely became less of a hard ass as the show went on, I really liked him towards the end  Question: Are there any episodes where there's a shot of them sitting together, from behind? Wanna make a wallpaper out of it.   Please, don't talk about my future husbando like that.   <br> &gt;We got to hear the entire song <br>Aside from how they kept cutting to different places and having people talk over it, sure.<br> &gt;They animated the shit out of all of it <br>Except that even in this final scene they still avoided animation the actual instruments as much as possible, like they've been doing for the entire show.<br>I'm honestly disappointed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So by the looks of this she likes Suichi.</br>  <br>Sensei was absolute bare minimum hardass for a band that had literally no concept of discipline when they started. Reality would have involved a lot more cursing and lot more tears.</br>  <br> me and my male friend did this <br>Holyshit I never realized it looked gay as fuck.</br></br>  Who /TakixShoe/ here?  <br>Did you know that the palm of our hands is a really sensitive part of the organ called "skin"?<br><br>And that by placing each other's palm and locking them in tightly they are sharing their senses with each other in a really intimate way!</br></br></br>  <br>Nice job, homo.</br>  <br>it's okay anon, you can get married now</br>  I wish KyoAni kept the Kumiko and Shuuichi hand hold. That would of shut everyone up.  <br>Just like when I hold hands with my little sister.</br>  <br>W-what happens if I put my two palms together?</br>    <br>Someone is mad for the Shuichi benis.</br>  <br>Do you interlock them?</br>  <br> cr <br> retarded "look at me, I'm okay with gays" rainbow colors <br>seems about right</br></br></br>  <br>W-What if i did?</br>  <br>Cost of doing business with fujoshi, anon.</br>  <br>I was thinking at the start he was going to turn into some extremely passive aggressive motherfucker that everyone hated, but he did just the opposite</br>  <br>Is this the power of skinship?</br>  <br>Good thing they had long sleeves. Someone could get pregnant from that shit.</br>  <br>Shuichi is gonna get the kumi cunny.</br>  <br>Sadly with my medical knowledge I am sure that our brain cancels our senses out in a way so that we are not irritated or disturbed by all the overloaded information. Basically cancelling it out as "noise".<br><br>You can see this to an extent wherein it is really hard to tickle yourself but is easy if other people do it to you.<br><br> Short answer that you were expecting: Masturbation </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi been smoking hot.</br>  <br>I've done it before too. I thought it was normal? I guess i'm a fag then.</br>  I don't even care if they kiss, I just want them to have a confession session after an intense concert performance outside the music hall with a cheesy romance insert song while their friends watch them from a distance cheering them on cause they knew they had a thing all along.    <br>dat smug fagott</br>  <br>it stands for the same thing, it's just a different way of romanising it (eg. lolicon vs roricon)</br>  He did it again! What kind of evil curse did he cast on them?  <br>I just want  special  doujins.</br>  So was it true that Kumiko and Shuichi held hands in the novel?  Why is Dekomori such a little bitch?  <br> /u/fags are mad. </br>   All of Reina and Kumiko's interactions this episode   FLAAAGGG  <br>The spell of same sex attraction.</br>  Man imagine all the shenanigans Knuckles and his crew get up to.  <br> Natsuki grabbing Oboe-chan's shoulders <br>Now this is a shot I can get behind.</br></br>  <br>But they aren't romantically involved.</br>  <br>You mean like which of them he can fit the most knuckles into?</br>  <br>They go around and bully nerds out of their lunch money.</br>  <br>what is this anime about? Sidonia finished so I've been browsing for neat looking things</br>  <br> I want the entire song played with no interruptions <br>You don't know anything about directing or scene composition.<br><br>And posting a single shot of obstructed instruments doesn't really make a point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spin off show of Knuckles and his harem?</br>  <br>I believe that's the dragon jutsu hand sign.</br>  <br>go back to the steppes kazakhstan</br>  <br>Both the yurifag and the hetfag in me is pleased with this episode.<br>Shuichi and Kumiko had that cute moment before the performance. Kumiko and Reina had that cute moment on the train.<br><br>Well played kyoani.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /u/'s face when </br>  <br>Getting the band back together.</br>  <br>I really liked Kumiko and Reina's parallel to when they failed to qualify in middle school. This time Reina's tears were from joy, and she embraced Kumiko instead of yelling at her.</br>  <br>He probably has his own harem side-story in this show. With his personality it will probably be close to him boasting that he is in an actual harem and this will be the story how he slowly conquers them all.</br>  <br>Cute girls and band drama</br>  <br>I liked the part when /u/ got bfto.</br>  <br>I mean what's her name?</br>  <br>the curse of love cut short<br><br>what did he do to deserve this fate?</br></br></br>    <br> i liked the part that enabled me to shitpost </br>    <br> mad. </br>   mfw they got gold   <br>HOYL SHIT, THEY INTERACTED OTP CONFIRMED, HET FAGS BFTO.</br>  <br> You don't know anything about directing or scene composition. <br>I was just saying, man. We didn't get to hear the whole thing.<br><br> And posting a single shot of obstructed instruments doesn't really make a point. <br>Man, just go watch the scene again. The only instruments that get decently presented are the drums and whatever that pipe thing was, since those didn't actually need the instruments themselves to be animated. It was a step up from the rest of the show, sure, but they still used the same lazy cost-cutting techniques they've been using the entire time and I didn't think they'd be so lazy for the grand finale.</br></br></br></br></br>  After watching this, I realized that KyoAni is really the best studio for cute girls. From the character design, subtle animation, and the way they behave, it always feels natural unlike other shows who are just trying to be cute. <br><br>Thank you based KyoAni.</br></br>  <br>it's ok because natsuki is lesbos with the ribbons</br>  <br>That's actually Ribbons. She's the only one seen interacting with Mizore.</br>  <br> pipe thing <br>you mean the radiator?</br></br>  <br>natsuki's love is for ribbons<br><br>hazuki's love is unwanted by all</br></br></br>  <br>This thing. I don't know what it's called.</br>  <br>God damm she wants his  hand to hold.  </br>   Friendship <br> Friendship <br>   The purest form of love at its purest </br></br>  <br> whatever that pipe thing was <br>Chimes.</br></br>  <br>HET FAGS BTFO</br>  <br>Did KyoAni switch their roles? Natsuki's suppose to be close to Mizore, and Yuuko is suppose to be close to Nozomi.</br>  <br> Friendship <br> True love <br> True love <br> /u/ still mad.  </br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br>At least we know who she ships.</br>  <br>She wants to blow his horn.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>You can stop replying to the post over and over again now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's the same as in the solo audition episode, when they show buchou and failure's beautiful friendship right before two star-crossed lovers make a death pact</br>  <br>Unless Ribbons has three hands, Natsuki has a hand on her right shoulder as well. And Natsuki is definitely friends with Mizore in the books.</br>  This thread needs more style and BIJIN  <br>Yeah Kumi and Shuichi. She is just hoping reina will go lezzer with kumi so she can have Shuichi</br>  <br>I demand S2 Asuka arcs. If you know what I mean.</br>  Is Shu a M?  Wait, they had Youko Hikasa as a nameless member?  <br><br>Looks like they're both close to her. That just added the number of scenes they'll have in s2</br></br>   everyone else is shocked or full of tearful joy <br> then this <br>I'm not sure what I'm supposed to take away from this.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't the whole band have names? Maybe she did background convo?</br>  <br> Reina and Kumiko incredibly touchy feely the whole series <br> hug when they win <br> last frame of the show is them holding hands <br> meanwhile desperate hetfags celebrate a fist bump in the only scene where Shuu got more than 4 seconds of screen time <br><br>Hetfags on suicide watch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wait, they had Youko Hikasa as a nameless member? <br>I'm pretty sure we all see that.</br></br>  <br>Asuka is suffering.</br>  <br>The ride is over for her.</br>  <br>That seemed pretty odd to me too, especially after the scene between her and Kumiko immediately prior.</br>  <br>I don't know what you expected out of the instrument animation. No, they didn't animate alil the woodwinds' keys clicking, and even then you still got some (pic related). All the instruments were believably animated. People take breaths at believable parts in the music. The fingerings are in time to the music. The musicians body movements during the performance were believable. <br><br>And as seen in a previous episode, Kumiko's fingerings were not only in time to the music but also ACCURATE to what was written on the sheet music. That's fucking fantastic. I wouldn't put it past KyoAni to be autistic enough to have actually accurately animated all the fingerings that we did see in the final concert. <br><br>I don't know what more you expected out of the animation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In Kyoani's version Hazuki probably hasn't given up on him. They seem to be leaning towards Hazuki and Shu developing into something.</br>  <br>OTP confirmed.</br>  <br>She did Aoi, but she also did another girl who just had a line or two.</br>  <br>So people still think they aren't a couple?</br>  <br>She needs her smile protected  from her mother, who beats her. </br>  You'll never go to her cafe. ;_;  <br>They apparently removed the interlocked hand holding with Shu, replaced it with a bro fist, and moved the interlocked hand holding to Reina.<br><br> 久美子はそっと秀一の指に触れた。　彼は息を呑み、それから驚いたように<wbr>こちらを向いた。　目と目が合う。　重なった指先がおずおずと複雑に絡まり<wbr>あう。　触れ合った皮膚からは、じんわりと熱が伝わってきた。</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br>    <br>Absolutely btfo</br>  <br>Awwww yis!<br><br>Google Translate:<br>Kumiko touched gently Shuichi of the finger .

I want you to imagine a world in which every rom-com/harem manga had Oka in it.  Imagine how often misunderstandings would get solved. How quickly they would get solved...  Did you think we were in for 20 chapters of confusion and wavering resolve?  Fuck that noise.  <br>poor akalyn, someone should just marry her already</br>  Oka, best wingman you could ever have.  Next time on Jitsu Wa Watashi Wa,<br>HELL YEAH MOTHERFUCKER!</br>  And now... for something different.  Special shout out to everyone on the staff who worked their butts off to not only bring you chapter 84, but this as well.<br><br>They really kicked a lot of ass this week.<br><br>In honor of the anime starting, here's the re-edited, re-translated, chapter 1.</br></br></br></br>  I'd also like to point out there are a lot of parallels between chapter 84 and this one. It hits a lot of the same notes.      <br>Thanks for the chapter</br>      <br><br>Any time. Glad someone's awake to see it.</br></br>    <br>Empty speech balloons?</br>    <br>  Glasses calls her Akalyn <br><br>Balls of fucking steel.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Son of a bitch. Let me fix that.</br></br>  <br> I want you to imagine a world in which every rom-com/harem manga had Oka in it. <br>I swear if he doesn't get the Mikan then there's no justice in this world.</br></br>                    Oka is best boy.      See what I mean? Whenever Asahi is wavering or doesn't know what to do, Oka steps in and says what needs to be said.  Man, forgot how much I still liked the first chapter.    <br><br>It really is a good series. Consistent quality with the writing.</br></br>    This chapter is fucking long.          Tarage,<br>Are you planning on re-doing Underdog's releases?</br>    <br><br>All of them? No. I had always wanted to re-do chapter one with better scans. We might do a few more, but most of the Underdog chapters are just fine in terms of quality.</br></br>  This was mostly just a fun side project in celebration of the anime starting.                  It's hard to notice since she's always so happy in the manga, but Youko was really sad and alone before Asahi found out about her secret. She lived a very depressing life.            <br> it might not want you want to hear <br>add "be" after not</br></br>  <br>Give Sakura a couple of years<br><br>Also I'd love to hear Demon's stories of love.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Thanks! Fixing right now.</br></br>    <br>It's so weird to think that Dumon is a grandma, meaning that she at one point popped out a child or two.</br>  <br>Shouldn't you put "sfx: ..." at the bottom or side considering it's an important one</br>  And that's chapter 1... but you already knew that.<br><br>Anyway, thanks for reading guys! I'll upload the archives to Batoto/the FwPA website after a bit more TLC. Expect it some time tomorrow.</br></br>  <br>AND WHO'S FUCKING FAULT WAS THAT, SHIMA</br>  <br><br> How bout them apples?! <br>My sides</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Comedy repeats itself.<br><br>First as a farce, then as a tragedy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>There should probably be an apostrophe before the bout</br></br></br>  God fucking damnit, back to square 1. I know she's dumb as a box of rocks, but is she really that dense?  <br><br>Yep... fixing that right now.</br></br>  I noticed Dumpire doesn't speak with an accent anymore did that get removed in later chapters or do you just not bother with it?  <br>She actively tries to suppress it and it only appears when she lets down her guard.</br>  <br><br>Partially because we don't want to make her sound TOO southern, but partially because we forget sometimes. Sorry.<br><br><br><br>I wish we were that clever.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's fine I was just wondering</br>  <br>Really, from here, Youko can look like a 'cool beauty'.<br><br>Too bad Asahi changes that, all for the sake of her having a happy school life.</br></br></br>  Compare <br><br><br>with<br><br><br><br><br>Pottery</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "my complete opposite" <br> turns out incredibly similar <br>Poetry?</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, you're right about it having the 'same beat', Oka is once again the one with the most insight and the most balls to actually bring up Asahi-related romance.</br>  <br> "Hurry!! Towel!!" <br> "Someone throw in the towel!!" <br> "Hurry and stop the match!!" <br>Best bros<br><br>Also, unrelated to anything, why do Japanese use two exclamation marks instead of three? I don't think English ever use "!!" in anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's why I love this manga. The author knows when to do callbacks to previous chapters, and knows how to apply them correctly. Not everything has to be a flashback.<br><br>He's a lot more skillful than people know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Shima looks halfway cool and decent here.<br><br>What a difference 2 years worth of chapters make.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He had a crush on her because of how she looked and acted, but he actually fell in love with her once he realized who she really was. Oka even comments about it at one point.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if the series will end with Youko entering a classroom with Asahi doing something secretive. <br><br>Like, I don't know, write "I love Youko" several times on that blackboard.</br></br></br>  <br> Actually, I think you're ridiculously cute <br>Based</br></br>  <br>I wonder if this is how Youko's dad responded to Youko's mom finding out he's a vampire.</br>  <br><br><br>Shame Oka is just a Ghost.</br></br></br>  <br>The way she's going, she still wouldn't get the memo</br>  <br>You know, I forget Asahi can't keep a secret and is super easy to read. Was it ever brought up in recent chapters? Besides the beginning of 84 where he's just dead, of course.</br>  <br>Oh man, this chapter already introduces the three girls that will be part of Asahi's harem, two of which starts off rather antagonistic, albeit Alium's more cold than cruel.</br>  <br><br>He still can't. He's just surrounded by people with secrets and he's too busy tsukkomi-ing to spill them.<br><br>Plus everyone around him is an idiot, so no one would notice anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This can't be square 1, they didn't start out kissing.<br><br>This is like square finish minus 8 spaces.</br></br></br>  <br>This is dumpire we're talking about. It's square 1.<br>Even after this, it's fuckign square 1</br></br>  <br>Wait to chapter 101. Her accent appears in the best place.</br>  <br> chapter 101 <br>This is just a ploy to get me to read a super lewd chapter!</br></br>  <br>Ok, you have my attention. Do you have proof?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure densei actually killed him during the Maid Cafe incident</br>  <br>God, even the guy who has a crush on her is scared out of his life. Poor Akari.</br>  <br>I don't know why.</br>  <br>The look of fear on everyone's faces is fucking great</br>  <br>I can see Oka getting Mikan, and Sakurada getting Sensei (eventually), but I can't see Shima getting a happy ending.</br>  <br> densei actually killed him during the Maid Cafe incident </br>  <br>Maybe Alium's brother will embrace the homo inside him</br>  <br>Either new character or one of the Alium.</br>  <br>One of these people?<br><br> if they can get out of Asahi's harem </br></br></br>  <br>Poor Granddumber.</br>  <br><br><br>Shima will get  Dumon </br></br></br>  <br>That'll just make Dumon even sadder than she already is.</br>  <br>Don't be mean to Shima anon.<br>Anyway it's the only way that her family will continue</br></br>  <br>New girls are really cute.</br>  <br>That fucking Shima. How can a character be so funny?</br>  <br>The new boy is also really cute.<br><br>I want him with Asahi's sister.</br></br></br>  <br> Even Sakurada is afraid! </br>  Missed out on 83, that ending.  ;_; <br><br><br>Damn.<br><br><br>Not with this manga. It pretends it will then goes right for your heart.<br><br><br>They are such bros.<br><br><br>Fantastic. You go asahi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I keep forgetting that Kuromine even has a sister</br>  <br>How can you forget someone who beats him in the popularity poll?</br>  <br><br>Oh man. There's never a shortage of reaction faces in this manga.</br></br>  <br> harem <br>Isn't Durriken another granddaughter?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>The glasses dude looks too much like Rin to be unrelated to Asahi. Box girl might be yet another granddaughter.<br><br>Is Succubi from the future too?</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Succubi is just a normal girl. Think of her as a new generation Dumpire, a girl with a secret who evades people so the secret doesn't come out.<br><br>And the only thing we know about glasses guy is that he reads porn mags all the time and maybe his glasses are the pervert god of fortune.</br></br></br>  <br>What about his sword?</br>  <br>Well the theme is sill there, like everyone and their mothers know who Asahi actually loves, but because Yoko is really fucking dense she just doesn't notice. It isn't the main point anymore, but it is there.</br>  <br>He's Asahi's great-grandson</br>  <br>That's too moe, my heart</br>  <br>She has her moments</br>  <br>Nobody deserves Shima.</br>  <br>I wonder what's Dumon's plan. Half the school are monster girls and the other half are Asahi's family. And there's Shima too.</br>  So how long until dumpire completely gives into the dark side?  <br>goddamn, Asahi has one sexy neck.</br>  <br>Shiragami sure thinks so</br>  Dumpire/Eromine best couple 2015  Kuromine has a sister? Wow.  <br>And she's more popular than he is with readers.</br>  <br>And she's the tsukkomi of her generation, too.</br>  <br>  alternate futures implied to exist <br>  glasses guy is alternate Rin, if she were born male </br></br>  <br>The sword is Asahi's great-grandson?<br><br>Dammit, Asahi's grandson, what are you fucking?</br></br></br>  <br> street sigh </br>  <br>Deskpire is a cute</br>    <br>Tell me the letter hasn't been in there this whole fucking time.</br>  <br>I hope she has a harem.</br>  <br>Too late, everyone died.</br>  <br>There's a glassless Oka on the far left, first row?</br>  <br><br><br>Sakurada went full merchant mode.</br></br></br>  <br>I care, thank you for your efforts</br>  <br>Myabe it's just Escherichia coli O157.</br>  <br>Back to your containment board</br>  <br> merchant mode. <br>?</br></br>  <br>What's she saying? All I get is "could it be that my dream" and something about asahi's path</br>  <br>Thanks for your hard work.</br>  <br>That's the chapter when both decide that they will become teachers, so something about that I guess.</br>  <br>They've been talking about their plans for the future in that chapter. Here, she's saying that she was thinking maybe her dream is the same as Asahi's future plans.</br>  <br>Could it be that my dream is the same as Asahi's path</br>  <br> path <br>Path? What the fuck? How did I get path?<br><br>Anyway, what this  said.</br></br></br></br>  Some new anime art from Nyantype.  <br>Course, route, path, it's kinda the same to me</br>  <br>Oka and Dumon best pair</br>  <br>I guess 'course' should be a better word because 'life course' makes sense to me, than 'life path'.<br><br>But English is like my third language, I'm not sure yet of its subtleties.</br></br></br>  So then. This will need a hentai dōjinshi at some point. Aaaaaaaaaand you know, some one will have to do it.  <br>It will get one faceless men doujin and one really poorly drawn vanilla and forgotten about.</br>    <br> them hips <br>HNNNNGGGG my dick is diamonds<br><br> aliums tits stuck together <br>boner ded</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we only get those scanlated <br> the very few vanilla ones won't even be scanned <br><br>Who do you think would be the 'breakout' character, so to speak? Mikan? The Pervert?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It will get one faceless men doujin  <br>If Fatalpulse does it, I won't mind.</br></br>  <br>I will change the faceless man for Shima's face.<br><br><br>That's a nice color page. I hope for a cleaned version.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 3DPD <br>Fucking horrible.</br></br>  <br> I will change the faceless man for Shima's face. <br>The hero we need.</br></br>  <br> no box girl <br>What a shame. Also, any anon care to remind me what did she say to Mikan?</br></br>  <br> Shima rape doujin <br> The raped is Alium's brother </br></br>  <br>Something like that Mikan will be the one who will decide the future, that something she will do will open different timelines or something like that.</br>  <br>That's not a doujin, that's the manga itself.</br>  <br> my monster secret is I'm a vampire </br>  <br>looks like everyone simultaneously crapped their pants</br>  <br>What point?</br>  <br>I guess he means this</br>  <br> Rejected by girls can take care of themselves </br>  <br>So are the antics of dimouto and friends closer to the comedy SOL aspect of the manga than its romance aspect?</br>  <br>So far yes.</br>  <br> he's gotten a lot better over time <br>Subtle lampshade hanging over how his defining characteristic has been set aside in favor of making him generic bland self-insert MC-kun</br></br>  <br>He isn't that bad. At least the denseness is concentrated in the girls instead of the MC.</br>  <br>His feelings still show on his face all the time, it's just that everyone around him has gotten almost as bad. The only reason why he's been able to keep secrets is that the important ones are so crazy that no one would ever ask about them.</br>  <br>He was aware that Alium was going to confess in the beach. Just for that he's better than 90% of harem MCs</br>  <br><br><br>But that anon is right, Asahi isn't bad in the sense that He can't be annoying because He's literally nothing, just a walking plot device meant to cause the girls' interactions. Better than a dense AND hyper bland self-insert MC, but He's still barely a character. I never liked his original characterization, but it's still much better than being nothing.<br><br>Inb4 but He's the normal guy among weirdos. Normal doesn't mean bland.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I also didn't mean that as a BAD thing. It's just how the genre is.</br>  <br><br>If you are , you wrote that His characterization got blander, it's hardly not a bad thing.<br><br>Anyway, if many manga of this genre share the same problem, it doesn't mean that it isn't a flaw, especially when it's something that could be fixed without causing side effects for the rest of the manga.<br><br>Talking about change, Even Mikan's characterization changed, but it just got much better. With Asahi we had just a de-characterization.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Are you planning on re-doing Underdog's releases? <br>what's the poing on doing this?</br></br>  <br>It was me, yeah.<br>Mikan is different, because she's a girl. She's actually a character. MC-kun has to be bland because theappeal of the whole genre is that you can easily self-insert into him and see yourself interacting with the cue, quirky girl of your choice without thinking "oh yeah but if I was MC-kun I'd fuck it up because of this weird personality trait he has." He's got none!<br>Is it a flaw of the genre? I don't know, I think it's more like a feature. Personally I think that's what most of us see even in Jitsu wa... Even if it's kinda embarassing to admit.</br></br></br>  <br><br> He <br> His <br>Fucking Germans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They might just think Asahi is God.</br>  <br>Fixing chapters with low-quality raws, bringing every chapter to the standard of quality of recent chapters, things like that.<br><br>It'd be a total waste of time, though, and I'd really rather they put their efforts more towards catching up with the weekly releases than anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>In German you don't capitalize pronouns, just nouns though.</br>  <br><br>We're never going to catch up to weekly raws for reasons I've stated before, but mostly because as soon as we switch from tank raws to magazine raws, things get much harder. There's always going to be a gap.<br><br>We're just going to fix a handful of chapters that have some quality issues. Like I said, most of the Underdog chapters are perfectly fine. There's no need to replace all that hard work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any particular chapters you're going to fix?</br>  <br><br>Of the top of my head, I know 2 needs a bit more love. Other than that, I don't remember.<br><br>Feel free to call out some chapters that you'd like to see redone and we'll definitely take a look at them.<br><br>Keep in mind that we're going to do this when we have spare time, so there is no time table for when these v2s will come out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Keep in mind that we're going to do this when we have spare time, so there is no time table for when these v2s will come out. <br>Of course. Maybe not to the point of catching up, but new chapters will always be the priority.<br><br>Speaking of that, what is the current hard wall of tank raws at right now?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We've got 11 in our grubby hands, and 12 is coming out shortly I believe.</br></br>  <br>Which chapters are in those?</br>  <br><br>Volume 11 goes up to 97. Don't know about volume 12 yet.</br></br>  <br>Any idea if you'll hit that wall by scanlating everything already available in tanks?</br>  <br><br>Not for a long time. Expect a chapter about every week for a good long while. Give or take a few days of course.</br></br>  <br><br>Is this real? I've seen nothing in the raws to support it... but damn, that makes a ton of sense. <br><br>The future is ruled by Charismatic Pervert II. Glasses boy grew up in a world where everyone is a pervert. So reading porn mags is a perfectly normally thing to do.</br></br></br></br>  On full covers of each volume there is always small picture of cover girl and speech bubble saying "I am...": vampire, time traveler, etc. <br>What does Mikan have there? (vol. 5)</br>  <br>Don't quote me on this, but I think it's something to do with the god of fortune.</br>    <br>I hope we finally get chapter about Oka, revealing that he liked Mikan for long time since if she calls herself Asahi's osanajimmie then definitely knows Oka for similarly long time and it's foreshadowed since second chapter</br>  <br>So the cover it's about Fuku-chan more than about Mikan.</br>  So Youko's mom has the same haircolour as Evil!Youko in that coverpage?  <br>Unless those two are one and the same.</br>  Man. The comedic timings in this series are so spot on. It really blows most comedy manga/anime out of the water, a lot of which rely on lelrandum bullshit. The unique artstyle also makes the overdramatic expressions that much funnier. Really hope it translates over to the anime well.  <br><br><br> Mikan doesn't even get the focus of her own cover <br><br>As expected of worst girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikan is just the person that carries Fuku-chan. That's her job.</br>  <br>Alium is the most popular character, so she'll probably get a lot of focus.<br><br>I see Dumon and Slutwolf getting a good share as well though.</br></br></br>  <br>She's the host.</br>  <br>I wish Fuku-chan was a girl.</br>  <br>How do we know he isn't a girl?</br>  <br>In an untranslated chapter   we see him at a love hotel with some feminine glasses </br>  <br>He fucks other glasses.</br>  <br>This fuckin manga, I swear.</br>  <br><br><br><br>What if   They're both girls </br></br></br></br>  <br>Just another day in Jitsu wa</br>  <br>There's a lot that can be done fetish wise with the suit and her real body.<br><br>Slutwolf is basically asking for some kind of sex change doujins for obvious reasons.</br></br></br>  <br> There's a lot that can be done fetish wise with the suit and her real body. <br><br>My god, the potential!</br></br></br>  <br> only just now realizing that a tiny humanoid with a normal human-sized mechsuit has enormous fetish potential <br>That aside, the Jitsu Was are not for sexual.</br></br>  <br> the Jitsu Was are not for sexual. </br>  <br>But they're not beautiful and pure. They're all messy, flawed individuals trying to reconcile their true selves with the facades they've been projecting for years.</br>  <br>That is beautiful though.</br>  So I've been trying to get into this and have gotten through the first 20 or so chapters. <br><br>Goddess Tier<br>  Nymphomaniac Lycanthrope <br>  Draculaura <br><br>Okay Tier<br> ayy lmao <br><br>Shit Tier<br> Horny Grandma <br> J. Jonah Jameson <br><br>Am I right in my reasoning?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really.<br> having a shit tier <br> Though I guess Mikan would fit there at the point you're at in the story. </br></br></br>  <br>She gets better, I assume? At this point, she's basically being a cunt so she doesn't get into relationship drama. <br><br>Which, considering this is sort of a harem, does make some sense. <br><br>Also, those "I'm 100000 years old but I look like a little girl" characters are rarely ever good.</br></br></br></br></br>  Warning. This post contains demons, vampires and single hags doing sexy lewd poses. View at your own risk.  <br>Dumon is great, though. She ends up producing the greatest Magical Girl show of all time.</br>  <br>Pretty far off.<br>Alium and Dumpire belong in Goddess tier. Slutwolf probably belongs in okay, along with Densei.<br><br>You're right about Orange though.<br><br><br>Dumon is actually pretty great. She's not a little girl for sexual reasons, in fact the series makes a point of how unsexual she is. She looks like a brat because she is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But she's the one who gave Densei her singleness. </br>  <br>Do you think she ever forgets?</br>  <br> http://imgur.com/a/EbVco <br>Cute</br></br>  <br>Until it isn't.</br>  <br>No, Densei did that to herself. Between the 100 visits and her totally unrealistic expectations, Akari really is an extraordinary case of romantic ineptitude.</br>  <br>you fucking lier</br>  <br>Something wrong?</br>  <br>It can not be helped.</br>  <br> those names <br>I can only guess you're trying to be funny and/or different, and all I can say is don't quit your day job.</br></br>  The first episode is delayed. There's no god.<br>http://anime.godeater.jp/?category_<wbr>name=news</wbr></br>  <br>maybe god got eaten</br>  How do you even mess up the first episode? Isn't this supposed to be 2-cour?<br><br>Haha this is so fucked</br></br>  B-but budget!  <br>13 episodes only.</br>  <br><br>Wow the actual TV airing is delayed now too. Yeah this project is probably fucked. They're obviously really behind schedule and probably better off postponing it to the next season.<br><br>Seriously though I'm surprised this doesn't happen more often though is probably going to with just how fucked anime studios schedules are becoming with the non-stop grind of 40 new series every season. They could always just A-1 it and forge ahead anyway, but it sounds like they do kind of give a shit so this is probably the better option if the schedule really is that fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>they really can't delay it a season. I mean they could, but Bandai Namco had a specific distribution strategy for this, with the first volume of the BD having game bundle.<br><br>Delaying it would be a nightmare and would cause issues to the Tales anime project as well. And anyone expecting HF should expect to wait for a very long time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did something happen between Putin and Abe recently that warrants the exponential surge of slavs in shows nowadays?</br>  <br><br>Well that's not due out till October so they have plenty of time to get their shit together. Still though damn, I was wondering how ufoTABLE was going to handle suddenly going from one project every few years to like 4 at the same time and the answer is obviously not that well. The way they try to do things they're obviously nowhere near equipped for this and again I think we're going to start seeing this happening more and more with stuff.</br></br>  <br><br>I imagine ufotable/president Kondo wanted their schedule to essentially be, God Eater(summer) Tales(Spring) and then focus fully on HF. It all goes back to UBW's production crumbling during the winter break and bottlenecking on the 15th episode though.</br></br>  Ufotable is shit.<br>Should have hired Madhouse instead.</br>  <br>Ah, I was hoping to see this become a horrible mess. If they delay it enough to get their shit together the whole way it'll be disappointing.</br>  <br>But Madhouse doesn't have Hiaro.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  How hard would they even have to fuck up their scheduling for this to happen?<br><br>I mean, I know Lerche is doing three shows this season.<br>Fuck, SL is doing three shows this season plus another three come Fall. Not even including the other shit they still have in their backburner.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe it wasn't such a great idea to have like 3 hour long episodes in the first season. I still don't know why they felt that was necessary, the 2nd season didn't even have any</br></br>  <br><br>They're going with the company that always did the cutscenes for the game for consistencies sake.</br></br>  Anybody else hyped up for the upcoming anime series?
