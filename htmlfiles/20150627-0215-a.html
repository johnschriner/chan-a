Today and on the first of the month, I'll do my best!   It's not really a place to ask that.     Is he right?   All the manga are zipped in that worthless unreadable format I figured someone has a nice way of quickly converting them to a comic book reader readable format   なるべく諦めない！ なせば大抵なんとかなる！   Try your best to not give up! You're likely to succeed if you try!          I'm a drawfag, and recently came across this on pixiv, it looks interesting, but i cant translate it.  If anyone wants to translate this as practice, i'd appreciate it, but if not that's okay too.    He should have used anki, but his ideas are right.    It just gives tips on how to motivate yourself.  It says that you should take amphetamines.      なんでそんなこと言うの;-;     7z   worthless   unreadable  They can be extracted on any operating system/distro and both android/iphone. A direct link, so you don't get lost: <br/>       I can extract them just fine, but there isn't a single comic book reader app that can read them so they need to be converted to zip or cbr. Was hoping for something that went directly from 7z to a readable format      What "comic book reader" are you using that isn't capable of reading jpg/png?   but there isn't a single comic book reader app that can read them  See above.        It just gives tips on how to motivate yourself.  Thats kind of why I wanted to know what It says. I figured if it were translated, it might be helpful to me or other drawfags in the future.     As a drawfag you must be used to the concept of a commission, right?    Why would I want huge uncompressed folders of images on my computer and ipad when I could keep everything small and neat in zip or cbr?    "B had A do it"?    In draw threads people draw people's waifu's for free, as it is good for practicing and getting better at drawing. Since they are still learning, and arent accomplished professionals, nobody expects to be paid in draw threads.  Theres no need to be rude, I was only suggesting it.      Why would I want huge uncompressed folders of images on my computer  jpgs are already compressed and most of the content in the manga and light novel sections are compressed images. Having them zipped isn't going to reduce the file size to anything worth doing. It might save 1% or 2% total.   Extract the folders, use any program you like and archive them as zip/cbr/whatever you want.     Theres no need to be rude  This isn't a "translate shit for me" thread; it is a thread for learners of the Japanese language. People coming in here and asking stupid questions without putting any effort into finding an answer themselves, is downright arrogant.          https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yxZ<wbr>T_4HvpW8</wbr>  [ ]  She is so fucking good.  I want to make her my bride even though I've never seen her face.       "Ä had it done for them by B"    Shit man I just grind the anki deck a few hours a day I don't actually know japanese    Not him, but while you definitely should be drawing instead of just looking at guides and reading about drawing, that does not apply to languages.  You wouldn't want a beginner translating something in the first place. And once someone is proficient enough in the language to actually translate, the quality of the translation depends far more the writing skill in the target language of the translator than on how much practice he has had with translating.  Not that practice isn't important when it comes to translating, but you still can't compare that to drawing.        There are programs and applications which can open a 7z archive for the purposes of reading/viewing the images. Do a google search man or look through the links in the website linked in the OP.    or maybe more like "A allowed B to do it"  who knows, it is a mystery without further context      Honeyview handles them just fine, and I think there are others that do as well.     This was just posted last thread. Might have been two threads ago. させてもらう is to receive the favor of being allowed to do, and the simplest interpretation is that A received the favor of being allowed to do from B; i.e., A had B allow him to do it. It's not "had it done for them" (that would be してもらう) and it's not "allowed B to do it" (that would be させた or させてあげた).      This isn't a "translate shit for me" thread  I wasn't demanding anyone translate it, I was suggesting it, thinking it would be decent practice for the people in these threads. I didnt say anyone had to do it.  It's a shame this place is so rude. I didn't expect this thread to be full of bitter elitists.    Thats fine, I appreciate your insight. Thanks. I guess i'll give up on it, and these threads.          This please review what the に particle does in the causitive form.    Seems like you're right, it isn't too much of a savings for the JPG archives, but there is some.  I found a flow that works for me that isn't too time consuming  Extract to folders then drag the folder the the AU after using the settings described here http://www.b4print.com/index.php?to<wbr>pic=4742.0</wbr>         So  isn't correct either, is that right? There's some kind of nuance I can't put my finger on.      I didn't expect this thread to be full of bitter elitists.  Translation requests have been universally frowned upon for as long as these threads have existed. Framing it as a "chance to practice" or whatever is silly, both because there's no shortage of material needing translation and because those who need the practice should be reading, not translating.     "A was allowed to do it by B", or something, I've just got it backwards at .   It does seem like it has a nuance like A is of a much lower status than B.      聴けなさい！！！！！！ ったく      I guess i'll give up on it, and these threads.  These threads aren't "translate shit for people", you obnoxious fuck.     I found a flow that works for me that isn't too time consuming  Good to hear man.         in the causitive form the subject receives 受身 and the agent of the action is proceeded by the particle に. its essential grammer.     To think these greedy people are the ones who are going to be translating manga/anime in the future. theres a reason why they used to call them fan-translations, its because people enjoyed doing it, not because they wanted to extort money from people in a desperate market    No, that isn't correct either. The nuance is that A had B allow him to do it. It's not particularly complicated, it's mostly just a matter of understanding how the causative and もらう work. Here's the thing, に can mark one of three things, technically:  1) the direction of the verb する (to do to/at someone) 2) the person who is being forced/allowed to do something by the causative させる  3) the person from which a favor is received with もらう  So when you see a contextless sentence it's a matter of figuring out which is the most likely and which one is more frequently used. With the way it's phrased, 3 is the most common option. It's possible for it to be 1 (imagine a sentence like 家に帰らせてもらう, indicates a direction without meaning "be allowed to go home by house") and I guess maybe 2, though I can't even think of a contrived enough situation to where 2 makes sense. Would have to be A receiving the favor of some third party making B do it.    It does seem like it has a nuance like A is of a much lower status than B.  Not necessarily. In fact it's often the opposite, because ～させてもらう is often used by really manly men and such to indicate that they're going to do something that might offend the other person.               If you can't do anything just give it a 15 minute rest, shieet nigga.     I've seen it used with a tone of "I'll have you do...". Either way, it's meant to sound really condescending.    A received a call from B and C.　Because that is how the に particle works with passive verbs.    I'm not sure if you're just trying to stir up shit or what, but I don't think anyone here has a problem with free translations in general. They just have an issue with people asking in a learning thread.    lol no     Was also in a recent thread. It's some contrived attempt at making a confusing adversative passive sentence.     "A made B call C"?    I'd say "A was given a call by C because of B" but I might be very wrong. First time I see shit like that.    There isn't a right answer because noone would ever say that.     That's bullshit. Passives and intransitive verbs can only be fully understood within context. Whoever made this is a troll.        I wasn't demanding anyone translate it, I was suggesting it  Here is a suggestion: read the Guide link in the OP google document and learn how to translate it yourself.    Have a look at pic related. Might help with the nuance.        this isn't even the right verb ending to take two にs.    Fuck off, lazy shit. You'll find no sympathy for EOP fags here.    Not him, but if you consider yourself a non-EOP fag because English is your second language, I got news for you ESLちゃん.      First, it's wrong. Second, "there's absolutely no light".    Confirmed for retarded.    Is the Kanji the same as the Hiragana? I can read the kana but the kanjji still looks like jiberish.   Will Google Translate accurately translate simple phrases like "Brown Sugar" for me? I've never used it for nihongo before but I can translate individual words between romance languages with little issue.   You're not even rubbing orange juice on the doorknob.    RETARD :^)   Should I learn radicals before moving to RTK?   http://www.excite.co.jp/world/engli<wbr>sh_japanese/ 赤砂糖 </wbr>    It's at least partially based on machine learning from a large number of texts so occasionally you'll get weird quirks. Something will be translated in an odd way because of context, and google will pick up on this for whatever reason and decide yeah, the translation for 卵 is now ovum. If you want to look individual words up, I'd recommend a dictionary.    <br/>     の can't replace が outside subordinate clauses. Who are you trying to kid here?      なるべく諦めない！  Wherever possible you should give up?     Adjectival clauses* That's your only hint.     They're just responding ironically because they live in 2015, and that's how people talk now I guess.    No because people don't need to write kanji.    Isn't that the same shit? Look here https://www.google.com/search?q=%22<wbr>%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A3%E3%81%9F%E3%81%8<wbr>F%E5%85%89%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AA%E3%81%<wbr>84%22&amp;oq=%22%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A3%E3%8<wbr>1%9F%E3%81%8F%E5%85%89%E3%81%AE%E3%<wbr>81%AA%E3%81%84%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57<wbr>.754j0j1&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8 Where do you see まったく光のない as a main clause? </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>     On the first page of a piece of YA fiction written in the style of a graded reader. You can't even read things that are deliberately simple! Amazing!     graded reader   japanese       people don't need to be able to write  Okay.     勇者部五箇条   You missed the ない        written in the style of       If you want to write then yeah you should, but if you don't plan to write then it isn't necessary.    A is scary    Every adult needs to be able to write.    A is so cute, desu!    I'll take a wild guess that they can write, in their native language    Confirmed retard.    So you will learn to write all 5k kanji by hand? Most of them seem like you'd never be able to write them without the sharpest of sharp pencils with how many radicals they have.    RETARD     Man, this joke is really great you guys. Haha. I love it. 4chan is an awesome website.     A is scared.     I fucking hate this meme   As for A, it is B.    I'm having a blast.    the pleasure of being cummed inside    You can't learn Japanese    B is A    If you desire to use Japanese in a Japanese environment then you really should learn how to write because when you need to and can't you will regret it. Fine for those looking to do nothing but read books/manga/video games but some people are learning Japanese as a language and not a tool.    As for you, Japanese-learning is not able to be done.    Is there a good radical deck that only teaches the 48 radicals? I could only find ones that had all of them.    There literally no reason to not write out kanji a few times when you are learning them besides pure laziness.  I find that writing a kanji 40 times doesn't really help but writing it with correct stroke order 5-10 times really solidifies the kanji and makes me notice all the details       Is there any easy way to export all of the words that I'm currently learning in Anki so that I can review them separately?   Why does every thread open with "You can do it" only to be filled with anons therefore after tell people they can't do it?  I feel some people spend more times in these threads than actually learning Japanese.      Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo.    Radicals exist you tard, and 5000 is Chinese, not Japanese. Any fucking excuse to stay in your comfort zone and remain lazy.   DJT likes to pretend to be gungho until something remotely difficult arises. No different from normies.      That's because most people are on Mount Stupid.    Fuck off you meme spewing faggot.    I never claimed it to be difficult I claimed it to not be for me, writing is pointless if all I want to do is just read Japanese okay. Just needlessly adding to the workload.  If people are going for the full package then they should.      You're not even rubbing orange juice on the doorknob, bruh.   For anons that live or have lived in Japan, do you write out your names in english or katakana?   Okay, i'll respond to this meme/bait.  I am okay with that, as long as I can read I am content. That is all. If you can not comprehend this, then seems you should be visiting the Daily English Thread as well.      Depends on the application. If it's something with legal consequences, like a bank account, it generally has to match your ID (which would be passport or gaijin card). But for shit like putting a name down to reserve a karaoke box, I put what the clerk will be most easily able to read.    So you're the tea-sipping faggot.   Just you being alive is enough to make me regret coming to this thread.  Go scratch a doorknob, wannabe.        English because I don't know how to spell Jack in Katakana.    Is the tea-sipping faggot really one person?        Anon, translating is not the same as drawing.  People can look at a shitty drawing and immediately know that it's shit. The only way that you can tell that a shitty translation is shit is if you don't need the translation. It's less akin to drawing a shitty picture for someone and more like offering to fix someone's faucet when you don't know the first thing about plumbing. You know, for practice. It's wandering into the realm of betrayal of confidence. Furthermore, unlike the plumbing scenario, it's not a very practical way to get better at Japanese, compared to reading, listening, and communicating with natives.  Before you even consider translating, you should be extremely confident in your skills in Japanese. "Foggy Japanese" should be a thing of the past. The only thing that you should need practice with is the creative writing portion, where you take what you know from Japanese and get the message across as accurately as possible in English.            As you should, that "not even scratching the door nob" shit needs to go.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184365  Summerfags trolling.

Well, RIP /djt/  The 16 year olds have taken over with their retarded trolling memes.  It was nice knowing you all. See you in September.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184637  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184754  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184705   Please leave.       I have worked with illiterate adults before. It was strange.   Sounds like a good idea at least. Couldn't hurt        Well, RIP /djt/  I wonder how you are feeling right now.    If you study japanese for 5 years, will you have the skill level of a japanese 5 year old?   Yep    Depends if you actually have verbal conversations with real people or just lock yourself in your room and grind anki decks.     Unlike a baby, you already have knowledge of both human communication and how to learn things, anon. As an adult learner, you'll be building off of those.  You'll never have the sheer intuition of someone who was raised in Japan, but in regards to Japanaese comprehension and conversation skills, you should easily have that five year old beat within six months.       You can easily get a reading and writing skill above a 5 year old in a few months.   Only thing that might take you a lot longer is getting a speaking skill on that level.         alright, good. Thats actually pretty motivational.      I don't want to do my reps.   Me neither, but what the fuck is with that pic?    がんばる!   I should have been directing my hate toward summerfags not NYRs...  Jesus Christ this thread...  I mean we have Finn and makifag but even they are less obnoxious than teafahggot and the people that respond...  I think im out until December im to old for this shit. They are going to teach themselves the wrong way and just trolling but not the cool meta kind.  Im out for this summer             summerfags  This delusion, no other anon in the history of 4chan believes in summerfags. It's a made up term you use to place blame on a imaginary entity so you can feel good about yourself.       I'm with you two. The thread the last few days has been terrible. Between the tea fags, the orangepeel or w/e the fuck this door knob shit is about, and the summer fags trolling as hard as they can, there's no point to be here.  I'll be back when the kiddos go back to school.  Deuces.          Looks like usual to me.   Ive taken long unneeded breaks from /a/. Its not worth it.     This is you guys right now, see you next thread.     Is it detrimental to my learning when I am reading a book or manga and can understand the meaning of a kanji but don't know the pronunciation?   If you want to go through RTK, the radicals are included in the book. If you just want to learn radicals, you should do so, because they're helpful, but you don't need to do BOTH.     Honestly, I thought that too. But I think I'm gonna leave, too. I've been a regular here for about 3 weeks now, and I feel like I've had all you people can give me.   Someone recommended the thread on /int/ and I went there yesterday. It's absent of faggots like you. Sure, there was an annoying britfag that thought he was the shit but that's manageable. I'm out, too.   Ghost mode, nigga. Outtie 5k.          I've been a regular here for about 3 weeks now     How would that be detrimental? If you don't know something, look it up. Having a fuzzy idea of what it means isn't a bad thing. The only case in which it would be a bad thing, is if you never bothered to look up words you obviously don't know yet.    This guy is a door knob licker if I ever saw one.    You won't be able to read fluently if you don't. When you read in English you should everything out in your mind don't you after all.    Same here, but if you don't do them now, you'll have to do them later on PLUS the stuff that piles up since then...  Sometimes you just gotta grit your teeth and do it regardless of how you feel. It helps if you do small chunks, I do 30 mins at a time then some exercise or read for 5~10 minutes.      Well you just have to question yourself, what is the actual point of a DJT? The thread can't live alone on questions for help. It needs filler.    You accidently a few verbs in there, bro. But I think I know what you were trying to get at: reading things aloud in your head, aka sub-vocalization. Not everyone does it, though it is pretty common.     sub-vocalization  Yeah that's what. I find that being able to do so in Japanese helps a lot. But if you're able to read through the Japanese without stopping due to not knowing the pronunciation then it's not too bad in the end.      I've been a regular here for about 3 weeks now   I'm out  Thank you.      I would argue the opposite.   Even if you can glean the meaning from the text, I would stop and look up any words you don't -actually- know how to read. Assuming you're actively trying to learn the language, you should be looking for opportunities to improve your vocab. You can do this on a second read through if you don't want to interrupt the flow or something.      I never understood this. Just because the unique ips don't go up doesn't they don't have more time on their hands. There's WAY more Americans here than Euros.  There's definitely such thing as them. They post during school hours also but not all day       I haven't been regularly since January. It's nice seeing how this literally turned into memes and re-answering questions every thread with the occasional basic question.　バイバイ～     I haven't been regularly since January   You're not even scratching at the orange.     DON'T GIVE UP! DON'T GIVE IN! KEEP READING! BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!  Learning Japanese is a very long journey and you need to fuel your mind with the right reasons and the right fuel to sustain that journey! Everyone has a lot of energy at the start and they're very focused on their reasons for learning Japanese, but after you've been going for months then the wear and tear of the grind starts to hit you, you get caught away in the daily challenges, the ups and downs, and you focus on the speed bumps of your daily studies and you lose sight of your reasons! You have to stay focused on the reasons for why you're learning Japanese!  There was once a kid who couldn't speak even though everyone else in his class was speaking. When he was 7 then everyone was reading and talking, but he couldn't read. The teacher brought his parents in and told them that he had to go because he was slowing down the rest of the class. They didn't know what to do with him, so they put him to work and he got fired from every single job that he tried. All that he knows up until 21 years old is failure. He's never tasted success. Then one day he found his reason, he found out what he wanted, and he gave it everything he had! Day in and day out! He tried something over 1,000 times before he was finally successful!  Most people never try something more than 10 times before they throw in the towel, but he just kept trying because this was something that he cared about! As he kept pushing forward then it was all of these failures that kept bringing him closer to success! AND THEN FINALLY THE LIGHT BULB LIT! It was Thomas Edison!  He had been a failure his entire life, but every time that he hit rock bottom then he just got back up and took another step forward! We all fall down in the journey of learning Japanese, but it's our perseverance that determines if we will be successful!  REMEMBER WHAT YOU WANT IN JAPANESE AND GO AFTER IT LIKE YOUR LIFE DEPENDS ON IT!             You can do it!    Is this できるちゃん？     Thomas Edison   So as long as you steal someone else's work, you'll become famous and go down in history for things you never did/accomplished?  Naisu!       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187252  It's better than the other ones    9 out of 10 retarded japanese in droid sans is my favorite.   Learning Japanese for 4 years, still can't read kanji, /a/ lied to me.     ji e ku duh       realize that after a full year of classes, even the most basic of native material is still beyond you   instead of deciding to push on and leave that bullshit program in the dust, attempt to seek more unnaturally dumbed down Japanese   Careful there! If you demonstrate anything resembling ambition, you might actually accomplish something!  I swear, this modern emphasis on classroom learning kills people's thirst to learn and improve, and makes them utterly timid around any kind of challenge, sometimes including those presented in a controlled environment.          I'm ashamed to say I took two semesters of Japanese at my community college with a bunch of niggers.     &amp; remember the basics  What even are the basics then?     it doesn't say how well the poster can read manga though.    もしもの時に知っておかないと痛い目に合うでしょう！  I get that the last part means  if you don't get to know [as a preparation for the future] you will probably have a bad time  but I don't know how to parse  もしもの時に  If it's 時に as in 'sometimes' then how should I parse もしもの here?        しろのひとは　みんなジンの　のろいによって　ゆうれいのようなすがたに<wbr>　されてしまいました。</wbr>   Should I stubbornly insist on understanding how minna affects djinn-no-noroi or should I look to the rest of the sentence for guidance?

I don't know what you're reading, but I'm parsing it like "[b]all[/b] of the white people, due to the jinn's curse were made into ghost-like figures"     white people     is it written 白の人 or 城の人 in the source    しろのひと It's a castle, though. I just wanted to mess with it.  I'm going to take the interjection of minna as one of those cases where they just throw in a word without a case marker and it means something.        with it.  with you*     want to start writing kanji since its the new trend on /djt/ and secretly everybody wants to learn it   dont want to actually grab a piece of paper and practice.   Can I just use paint or something?      it means like "all of them", or making it more than one person who was affected, without it it sounds singular:   城の人はジンの呪いによって  because of the jin's curse, the person from the castle was...  城の人はみんな、ジンの呪いによって  because of the jin's curse, ALL of the people from the castle were...         Ah. I was confused, then, solely because of the spacing this game uses.   Are there any good niconico streams?  I am tired of listening to prank calls in English    Going on hiatus from /djt/, this place is cancer. Trolling is one thing, misinformation is too far.

My Japanese input isn't working for that part for whatever fucking reason  Trust me calling him English names isn't my first choice      Sounds like me, except I'm a NEET.    first half of the thread filled with dumb drama  Meh, still better than /int/ at least.

D-Did anybody catch that ending?  I think I have been kicked from both of them      I just noticed the OP is changed This new one is shit, why can't you just put the links in the post itself instead of using that dumb slow google docs thing, it's already bad enough having to use it for the guide and cornucopia     You weren't kicked, the episode just was over. They last 30 minutes normally.    D-did you catch the ending though?  She was pronouncing when Isaid "how do you say masturbate in Japan"      Yes I did anon. Your Japanese is very cute.    :)    the most paid athlete is the world cant read or write boom    I feel like im actually learning Japanese by hanging out on niconico I wish rikai worked on it but I still listen and am interested more naturally    I don't know which country you come from but in Australia athletes often take university education in order to sustain their livelihoods aside from sports.    Anon was trying to emulate djt.みんな, which was a lot faster than going directly through a google docs page, especially on mobile devices. It didn't really work out but anyone else can host the links as you have described and post them in the OP for the next thread.   Make the next thread like this and you're halfway there to having it used in the next thread, then the next thread, etc. People might complain about the links changing but they probably wont do anything about it. It is kind of easy to highjack the OP links and alter them, before people notice it is the new standard.  I've done it a few times in the life of DJT and no one has commented about it.           https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floy<wbr>d_Mayweather,_Jr.</wbr>  America. He cant read at all and im confident he cant write either. Theres a video of him trying to read harry potter and he actually sounds as if he has turrets      turrets  Apparently, you don't know English.     The first Genki textbook has reading sections in the textbook and workbooks like pic related. If they have worked through the first volume they should have been taught a few hundred kanji, from memory. Genki also starts to replace words in hiragana with kanji in the 3rd chapter. What he says they did does not match up at all with the source teaching material.    Do you know how outliers are treated in statistics?          genki     rename that to "koohii logic"    RTK fags in a nutshell.    When the picture was made 2 years ago the default method for DJT was Kanji Damage for new people. I don't know if anyone remembers that now.   so, starting today, my japanese friend started addressing me with -kun, instead of -san  i don't know how i should feel    <br/>   Nice.  Depends. Did you just tell him you started learning Japanese?       him   it's a girl. and it's someone i've known for about 4 months now    XX君元気ですか？   was the exact question, XX replacing my name           It's a girl   http://vocaroo.com/i/s1gxb2Hr0OkU      Just report and move on.     turret    Context, sperg.

Stop trying to be a normie and get back to studying Japanese like the rest of us.    えと...it's not that hard...start by having japanese internet friends    Japanese Onomatopoeia     Japanese compound verbs      Stop trying to be a normie and get back to studying Japanese like the rest of us.   but  whats the point of studying japanese if i cant get girls to use it on        You gotta be a イケメン and リア充. Then you'll get all the bitches.     Japanese names    Japanese people would not like me. Im terrible at being a gaijin because I spent my life watching chinese cartoons, and Im terrible at being a weeb cause I have not seen or read much anime and manga to begin with. The only thing I have going for me is drawing, im still not skilled enough to post in the drawfag threads, and good luck with that while trying to keep up anime and manga, and school at the same time. Fuck it all!      I spent my life watching chinese cartoons   I have not seen or read much anime  don't tell me you mean chinese cartoons literally      池田君は三日でその本を読んでしまった。   They say that it means 池田 finished reading the book in three days, but can't you also interpret しまう in a way like "池田 ended up reading the book for three days (without intending to at first)"? Or do you have to word it in a certain way to have that other meaning?     てしまう doesn't have to specify regret or lack of intention. It is primarily for the completion of an action which happens to often naturally involve regretful situations.   今回カプコンがコナミに負けたのは俺のせいではない   Ah, so the completion is the base meaning, and whether it's regretful/unintended can be inferred from the action or by additional words. Thanks, anon.    My anonymous life.  1st-5th grade  Watch a bunch of simpsons, family guy, american dad, south park, athf, robot chicken, and general cartoons on nickelodeon and cartoon network . No anime though.  6th-8th grade  Watch a bunch of newgrounds, avgn, and nostalgia critic. Get into anime by the end of 8th grade.  9th-12th grade  Anime, anime, anime, anime, drawing the /ic/ way. begin studying japanese. holy fuck, I went my whole life not watching any movies or tv shows. panic.          install VNR for text hooking, because TA suddenly stopped working properly   RANDOM CURSOR CHANGE   IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND ANYTHING EASILY THROUGH 50 THOUSAND SUBMENUS   SO KAWAII BULLSHIT EVER  This is it. This is the worst program I've ever used. I thought it was a little weird that it was about 500 times the size of TA, but I didn't pay it any mind.  If anyone can use this absolute clusterfuck of a program, you have fucking brain problems.         You're just an impatient person. If VNR didn't have as many options people would be complaining now and then too.  With that said it also bothered me and I quit after 10 minutes. I told myself I'd try to configure it properly someday but at this point I think I'd rather get near-fluent first.      The problem isn't all the options. It's that all of them are totally fucking nonsensical and pointless. TA doesn't have a problem accepting copied text from another program and running it through Mecab for me. Everything is contained in a couple of menus that don't disappear just because I'm not hovering over them.  It's totally anti-user.     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sZ8<wbr>2xbK0lJM</wbr>  [ ]  Let's get motivated with Steve-sensei!     Anyone up to work on fixing the typos in the grammar guide of the website or are we going to wait for corくん to slowly fix it up while everyone uses it in the meantime?  I've downloaded the docx and had a look. Google ruins the style formatting which makes it easy to mass alter sections and it keeps freezing up when trying to do any online edits. Would anyone be interested in adding corrections as comments in a plain google spreadsheet? I've sent an email to corくん with a link to the document so he/she/they can see corrections as they are posted. Having that DoJG reference fixed up and realized would be a useful page/document/pdf for every Japanese language learner. Haven't found any errors in the first 30 pages. I can probably work through a couple of concepts a day. There are about 600 total with one person looking through one every day or two a few people could work through it in a couple of months without much effort. If corくん doesn't respond at all we can/someone can/I can add the corrections to the local copy and have that uploaded on the djt website offline grammar link with whatever file sharing site. Document: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1DgESX_cOQlCj9Ed8nu9DlLDxF48szD<wbr>_abWjaMJxlia0/edit?usp=sharing   Still no email response from corくん. Has anyone else been able to get through to the person recently?   </wbr></wbr>      If languages were operating systems, English would be Windows and Japanese would be ios   Either "B let A do it" or "B made/let [C] do it for A".    Japanese is somekind of CLI OS.   Let's start again Anki.   English is extremely derivative while Japanese is very isolated. Not really seeing how the comparison works.    I didn't at first either, but now I get it, though not like a /g/anster. Windows is used a lot more and more mainstream than ios, but ios is still expensive and special and can be seen as elite. This comparison is awful, why are we glorifying it?    Apple are giving their operating system away for free these days. If anything Windows is the most expensive OS on the market these days.  why are we glorifying it?  I'm not trying to.     談 It's like asian people knew internet would be nothing but arguments.

Got a bug in Awesome TTS  Request got &lt;lower than 1024&gt;-byte for web request; wanted 1024+ bytes (x times)  how do i fix this?

Wait for a response or try to contact the developer some other way.   にちもとがたり    </wbr>    ジャパニーズ    That's the equivalent of calling someone a little girl for posting a picture of a little girl    It's been a few days now, you're just a really bad kind of troll, constantly trying to play the ironical smug person and "baiting" people to respond you. This shit is just sad, fuck, either grow up or fuck off to some video game boards.  Hopefully I haven't been the only one reporting every single one of your pitiful trolling attempt.      I'm starting today because I'm tired of missing out on the rich lore in my hentai games.   What made the rest of you start?      Mainly visual novels, awesome games and Skyrim mods      I'm starting today  Don't worry bud, just put it off till tomorrow. Nobody will know.     Namasensei made me start.  I watched his videos for fun because they were entertaining, and when there were no videos left I realized I had actually learned something and that Japanese was kinda cool, so I just continued.      Angel Beats.    Wish I knew about namasensei when he was making his videos. Would have sent 50 dick pics and told him to sit on it fifty fucking times. Seems like the sort of guy who would appreciate that sort of thing. There aren't enough people left on youtube related to language learning who make a complete mess of their lives for the sake of the enjoyment of onlookers. A noble cause to die for.     I'll know.     why do tomorrow what you can do today?     Sengoku Rance     Change the date to the day before the next time you wake up and you're already ahead.    Time doesn't work like that.    Time is relative.    you can't just live in your own time bubble and think everything is okay.    My nigger.    Where do you think you are?     Are there any H-doujins that use furigana? I am on my way to being able to read my doujins raw but the kanji is stopping me.    And what do you know, everything wasn't okay and Rikka was autistic.    That is what almost every person does. Their sense of time revolves around a work schedule, a school schedule; a social cycle; a pay cycle; etc.     Are there any H-doujins that use furigana?  Erotic content is sold to adults, anon, not children.        You think material aimed at 18+ would have furigana, a concept designed for 5 year old children? Are you fucking stupid?  The best you can get are a few loli characters that talk in kana to sound childish.      I like the concept.   My First Porno, by Fisher Price      かっこいいだ！     い adjectives don't take だ     Thank you, i'm still a noob you know..     Why don't adult restricted works use furigana  Best question I've seen posted in months.    もちるん what word is this? Or is it 2 words, Jisho gives me nothing. I feel like I have heard this in anime before and it means "of course" but I am not sure.    It's "sticky rice cake moving at a brisk pace".    물론    read tae kim    That's why they have to hammer mochi down; break their legs to keep them running away.    I don't speak korean.   The symbol for 安 contains 女. Really makes you wonder if not all Japanese think women are cheap sluts.  jesus christ. i just found a 16 year old with g-cups on nico.  she is even posing for the camera and stuff  http://live.nicovideo.jp/watch/lv22<wbr>6094065</wbr>        Use google translate and go from there. You fucked up the word and this is will provide the right one. It is to save your embarrassment, trust me.     You (or somebody) just mistyped もちろん.    I hope that one day, mochi will be allowed to run free in the streets, instead of beaten to death and sold as a new year treat. Elevens are sick.   I don't have vomiting matsudoki saved, but I'd be posting it right now if I did.         Thanks, so my anime intuition was right, I read it as mochiron and don't know why I typed mochirun.      YOKETA!!!!!    Japan understands that 3D are PD.   じゃあさつそく Then at once?    Are you even trying?    Not being able to figure out when words end and start is my biggest flaw sadly. Hence why I am currently working on it.    reminds me of 謝罪しる    「さつそく」ではありません名無しくん。 「さっそく」と言います。  注意を払ってください。       「注意を払って」より「注意をして」の方が自然でしょう    そうですか。 ありがとう、知りませんでした。     そうですか、知りませんでした などを敬語にするのであれば 　”ありがとう”　も敬語で　”ありがとうございます”　にするべきです。<wbr></wbr>      Why, when is one used instead of the other?    Yeah, no.   注意を払う http://eow.alc.co.jp/search?q=%E7%B<wbr>4%B0%E5%BF%83%E3%81%AE%E6%B3%A8%E6%<wbr>84%8F%E3%82%92%E6%89%95%E3%81%86</wbr></wbr>    「注意を払って」is a literal translation.    No, 注意を払う is a set expression in Japanese       it is a literal translation, but you can still use 注意を払う, it's just more "heavy" as in "motherfucker you better pay fucking attention" but what in this case we're looking for is "be careful bud"  also, in japanese, you'll seldom hear someone say 注意を払う          If you haven't noticed, the standard mode of expression for all languages on /a/ is aggressive and over the top.    i thought djt was about learning?    ふざけるな！    あぁん？ やんのかオラー    A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.  How are people supposed to see anime as art when KyoAni keeps making stuff like this?  I love Gotou.   That crushing feeling when you can't get good, no matter how hard you try.    Have you been working on those lip slurs anon?   SO UGLY.   EVEN Hazuki and Natsuki was amazed at how shit Kumiko was playing, and they didn't even make the cut.   Why don't they just fuck already?   Maybe they don't know how.   I just can't take this character seriously. I want to laugh whenever I see her dumb face on the screen. She's just so adorably autistic.     2special4u?   shh, Kumiko is sleeping   I want to put her in a room filled with LEGO bricks and watch her play with them all day long.    Because in Japan girls are gay in High School up until they find the D that they want then they endlessly pursue that D. If they fail they're doomed to Christmas Cake status.  Girls aren't allowed to switch D pursuit unless the new D is above and beyond all expectations in the ultimate shape of masculinity.  You now understand why Harems are such fierce competitions.        Why must you respond to shitposters?     girls only allowed to change Ds if new D is greater   thus harems are competitive  Surely it can't be that hard to find something superior to the faggots who typically find themselves leading harems?       Robert fripp did it, you can do it too.    I want to drink her blood.   You would think that, however density also starts with D and dense D also sounds like density which means the harem lead is the ultimate D.  Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.      What are you talking about, anon? Just look at her.    I want to fuck her sister.   Like pie in the sky    I want to fuck all the Hibikes at the same time.  How would socially awkward attempt to court Taki?   peace-chan has a name    I sort of miss those days. Things were so much simpler then.     That's basically the main reason why I want season 2. I want to see her try to act flirty around him.     Invite him on a quick trumpet walk up Mt. Fuji  iykwim .    She should go after him with a bottle of water offering it to him because it's hot. Taki thanks her and Reina dies.    I-I don't anon.   I don't know. I think she would just try to talk to him a little while and then tell him that she loves him if he's enjoying the conversation or smiles.  That or  she would mount him and demand that she start touching him, even though she would probably grab one of his hands and put it on her breast.           The same way how Kumiko approached Taki-sensei this episode. Leave her cellphone intentionally, they go to the room where she left it and then she rapes him there.      H-here, drink this sensei   Oh? You're giving me water?   It's because you look h-hot.  She then leaves blushing furiously and amazed at herself for being so bold.       So that's why Reina wanted Kumiko to tell her what happened.  Sasuga Reina.     Do you think Reina runs a blog or since she's so super special and different from all the other girls her age she has a traditional, physical diary where she writes about her interactions with Taki-Sensei?     I did it Kumiko, I told Taki I thought he looked hot      She would drug his drink, wait for it to kick in and rape him. A few months layer Reina sends him a positive pregnancy test result and attached to it is picture of her grinding his dick.     Reina shitposts about her crush on /r9k/    get on my level bitch.      Reina?  More like REEEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?      Reina is a pussy that pretends to be hardcore around other people. She would probably faint if Taki-Sensei even touched her.      She's also an M, I don't see her raping anyone.    She's M and S.  She reminds me of me.      Holly fuck a 'proper' nosebleed sacre bleu!     Kousaka-san, you'll be playing the solo. Not Nakaseko-san. You'll play. Got it?   Y-YOU TOO!      She's probably only an M because she found Taki's laptop open one day, and learned, among other things, that Taki hasn't mastered private browsing.      Now its time to disscuss medecine.what was the cause of Kumiko's nosebleed? Stress? Dry air? Obscure disease?       What does Taki does on his computer? Jacking off to professional orchestra music?     He watches that one amateur porn video he made with his wife over and over again. Then cries at the end.     It was not dry air. Kyoto is like the fucking Amazon in summer.    We went over this. The only causes for nosebleeds in anime are punches to the face or indecent thoughts. And I'm pretty sure Kumiko wasn't punched off-screen.      Implying they had time to do that  Taki married and his wife died like the week after what a fucking loser      Dehydration      10 orchestra hacks that will change your life   What this 10 year old trumpet prodigy does next will blow your mind   Depression help       Yuuko plz   Well whadda you know.  Screens are up, fuckers.     It's Key AIDS. Kumiko will be hospitalized right before the competition and Reina will completely fuck up her solo because she's worried about Kumiko. Reina will become a pariah, reviled by the band while looked on by Taki with only a gaze of deep disappointment while Kumiko becomes sicker and sicker. Kumiko will eventually die and Reina will try to throw herself off the school roof before being stopped by  Shuichi  who will  confess his love to her.    why the fuck did I write this       This shits going around.    Like seriously.    Holy shit the ponytail is back.    Ponytails everywhere.    Ponytail is back. Nice.    3 ADs  It's over KyoAni is finished.    JUSTICE    Kumiko must be sweating in that uniform she hates summer after all.      ponytails are back      last episode not called "Hibike! Euphonium"  I'm ready for you, second season.    Didn't Tamako's last episode have even more ADs?   Leave it to Kyoani to have us waiting until the end. The promo image didn't lie, Kumiko has the hairband around her wrist.   Nope, only one.    BUCHOU!    Look at her fucking uniform!  these illustrations will most likely become drama cds, as it happened with free!      Are the winter uniforms their performance uniforms? Only the slackers seem to be wearing their summer get up.       Ponytails vs. Ribbons: which is better?        !       Is it not possible that this scene is before or after their performance?    I think its for the more formal look.  コンクールの舞台で演奏できる時間は“たった”12分間。 それは一瞬のようで、でも永遠のようで……。 吹奏楽部員たちはその12分のために青春のすべてをかけて練習してきた。 北宇治高校吹奏楽部の演奏が始まる。         I'm pretty sure there have been some relatively recent KyoAni episodes with a couple of ADs, I just can't remember which shows did it. Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  It's pretty funny just how little staff is required per episode in KyoAni shows compared to other productions.     Are they really going to focus on music?  Hold old is Taki anyway?   Dehydration, which is why she was given water.    Ponytail is back, fick ja!          Taki in formal attire  How wet will Reina be?     Taki is 34. You should know this by now, Anonymous.     return of the ponytail   return of the winter uniform  It's the obligatory fan service episode.      There have been rare eps with two ADs but three is quite unusual for Kyoani.    I'll ask my friend. I'm pretty sure he can see the future.    Wiki says 34, although it varied from 32-34 before. I'd like novelanons to confirm ;-;    Brilliant.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]       Asuka ponytail  I still have mixed feelings about her but now I'm definitely aroused.      the description of the scene is that they fell asleep during practice. And the entire page is dedicated to the duet episode. It's probably one of those "it happened but we didn't show it" artworks. Kumiko has the hairband because she always puts up her hair for concerts, and they were practicing in the concert hall.       Well, it is the closing of three consecutive productions for KyoAni. With this many ADs on board here's hoping for a really well-animated performance. It would be great to have back-to-back episodes with cool animation highlights.     1434178590484.jpg  I really love the uniform designs in this show. The color palettes are very cute. I also like the little number in the back. Nice touch.     Who is she again?    Episode 13 "Goodbye, Competition" The amount of time to play in the concert is just twelve minutes. It seems like it will be over in an instant, but it seems like it will last an eternity... For the sake of those twelve minutes, the concert band members have stakes the springtime of their youth. Kitauji High School Concert Band's performance begins now.       I-I fucking love taki.    We know Riko, we know.    None of that says it can't be an actual scene. Do you not want it to be an actual scene?   Who are the staff for the last episode?   Reina please contain yourself    Go back to your trumpet solo.     Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  3 animators teams. 1 from Do, 2 from KyoAni. They might reach 20 KAs this time.  Too bad, their best animators already worked on episode 10-12 so they probably won't be in the finale.          start the show with ponytails   end the show with ponytails   There must be some deep symbolism in this, I can't figure it out though.       Who are KyoAni's best animators these days? Is Kigami still relevant as a key animator?    they had like 9 KA on the last episode, do they even need 20?   There's lots of instruments and tiny details this episode.   They sure do if they're going all-out on depicting the performance.    of course he's still relevant, he did episodes 5 and 11    But no tiny hats.     Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.   I chuckled a bit, but it's true best boys can be found in the sausagefest that are baseball mangas.      5 and 12*    Direction: Kawanami  SB: Yamada AD: Sezaki, Akitake, Hikiyama      Huh, no Ishidate. He's normally the finale guy.    Their best or most experienced that aren't AD or ED - Tatsuya Satou - Shinpei Sawa - Hiroshi Karata - Kunihiro Hane - Yoshinori Urata - Mariko Takahashi - Kouhei Nakahara Kigami actually worked solely on key animation for like a year before Hibike.            Do we know which staff members haven't been very active lately? IIRC Ogawa and Utsumi have been pretty quiet so maybe they are doing some new project.     normally  Outside of his own show and Chuu2? Not really.     he's 34, although I forgot where they mention his age     although I forgot where they mention his age  Pretty much when he first appears.     there's no way Utsumi isn't doing animation for the Free movie. She's just directing anything for it.    just not*   Even Natsuki was embarrassed.   Holy shit, Kumiko sucked.    BD/DVD vol.2&amp;vol.3 also added event ticket.  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/650<wbr>45</wbr>     Its over. KyoAni on bankruptcy watch.      3 event tickets  We jew now     She's not in a position to judge.  She didn't even make the audition.       I think the both of you may be misinterpreting that scene.     I hope she's working under Takemoto's supervision. Her talent shines through the most when she's led by someone else. Same with Ishidate.    more like time to announce a s2    Do they have enough event tickets?    better add more tickets just in case    tfw Aoi won't be at the concert   Yes. That position, yes.    ■感謝イベント　京都でお祭りフェスティバル ～南座へようこそ～ 概要    日程：2015年10月31日(土)   時間：17:00開場／17:30開演   会場：京都四條 南座 (京都市東山区四条大橋東詰)   The same day as KyoAniDo event.

That means episode 13 + OVA is in the last volume.    http://anime-eupho.com/product/  続巻発売日情報   第4巻：2015年9月16日（水）  第5巻：2015年10月21日（水）  第6巻：2015年11月18日（水）  第7巻：2015年12月16日（水）  Volume 7 of BDs goes on sale on December 16th. Every BD volume contains two episodes and a short special. Anime TV series only has 13 episodes.  It's the same thing that happened with Amagi Brilliant Park. TV series had 13 episodes, OVA came out with the seventh BD volume.                They announce S2 on Tuesday, right?  I want to fuck Kumiko, hard.   Taki tapped that right?    KyoAni has been consistently doing this format for their TV shows since Chuu2Ren.       Asuka stoic as fuck whilst everyone else is has varying degrees of damn when Kumiko got told.   Now that I think about it, they didn't focus on Shuu's reaction, did they.    Right, because she can't feel empathy.      That reminds me of Haruhi.    god, are japanese ugly without photoshop and centimeters of make up  Centuries of imbreeding do that to you. Almost as bad as English.       That little river play was cute, a push for each other to get good.   Get good, Kumiko.    Must be a communist.        <br/>    Asuka reads it for the first time and plays it flawlessly. Kumiko, who has been playing euphonium for seven years, struggles even after practicing for an entire week.       If you look at the music for the piece she played for her middle school competition, it's not that hard in comparison. The degree of difficulty is just this much higher than what she's used to.  Asuka's just special.    Will Shoe1 win the Kumikobowl?     Maybe on the new AniDO project? They have something to announce next month.     Why do most japanese in highschool look ugly? Is it because of inbreeding?     If they make two more seasons, or a two cour second season, then yes. If they end it with this season, nope. It's an adaptation of a novel, and in the novel he only wins the k-bowl at the end of the third volume.      He's already out of the running.    He's the only one in the running. It might take him a year but he'll get to the finish line eventually.      He's the only one in the running.  That's what you think.     Piss off Kumiko     tfw you will never go to a Hibike event     WAKE UP BITCH    Please don't suck so much donkey dick and PUT THE FUCKING BLANKETS.    Would be weird if AniDo announced the new show and not Kyoani. Even Free's announcement was all under Kyoani's name.     Not Kigami Not Ishidate  3 ADs....  I can't say they're cutting corners but I'm kinda disappointed.             Violin-chan is a cutie.      Is Aoi daijobu?  I hope she gets into a uni and STEM subject of her choice.     I never understood the obsession to study for college during your final high school year.    That's the feeling that indicates that you're not trying hard enough.    Entrance exams. You can't go to college if you don't pass them.    Are entrance exams in japan really that hard? To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd.   Why isn't Reina in any special classes? Is that normal in Japan? Here in America, autistic children have their owns classes. And when they take standard classes with normal students, they have a chaperon with them at all times.  You will never date Reina and then go out with other girls to make her jealous. ;_;   It's the only way to get into university, and the choices of universities you can get into is determined by your score.   It can also mean the difference between a life long white collar job or whatnot.        It depends on the college you want to get into but yes, students are very stressed out during this time because their future depends on it. In Japan it's hard to get in to college but easy to graduate, but in America it's relatively easy to get into college but more difficult to graduate.    It's better to make them socialize with normal people instead of treating them like special snowflakes or giving them Ritalin like in ameriland.    They are the most important exams you will take in your educational career as the university you go to will depend on your results, and that has more influence on your future job prospects than how you actually get on at university.    They are announcing something next month and many people are not working on anything for a long time. It makes sense for them to start acting independently.     To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd  It's not odd at all in an Asian country. An entire year is nothing when everyone else starts preparing for the exam since their first year of highschool.      I have faith in the Yamada. Hopefully they don't dissapoint with the finale like they did on Ep 11.       inb4 it's just another seasonal staff illustration thing        It just seems kind of odd to base what university you go to on one exam, rather than your overall academic performance.    I think they'll give a solid hint that Kumiko likes Shuichi otherwise they would never should have bothered with the whole Kumiko doesnt know about her feelings sub-plot.  What's Kumiko feeling here?  Abject despair that she'll never reach Reina's skill level?       I can only assume she is aiming for a very hard or unusual career or something, otherwise sperging out just because you want to get into liberal arts, marketing or nursery would be kind of stupid, any diploma from any college could pretty much do the job. I used to think that without a degree from a top tier university you'd be pretty much unemployed for life but it isn't really that important for most 'normal' jobs.      The kind of university you graduate from matters more in Japan. People and employers might look down on you if you're from a third-rate school. Even in the dating world they look at where you graduated from as a way of picking a mate. Probably because better school = better job = payed better = security.   In Aoi's case she'd already failed to get into the high school she wanted so she's already stressed out about veering off the path she wanted. I don't know if it will ever be mentioned what career she's going for but it must be something she really wants.      Do lacks a digital department, they can't be independent.      That doesn't matter, Do can't be independent because they're not a separate entity, they're a subsidiary owned entirely by KyoAni. Pretty much a KyoAni studio in Osaka with a fancy name.     Where is that pic of red rinnon blowing the paper? She has the guts to be in a position of authority.   red ribbon*    What the fuck is wrong with the Japanese male hair styles.    They have shit hair genetics that don't really allow them to have more than 3 styles.    I don't think it's going to be anything too overt. Maybe hints of them reconciling, but no strong romantic hints. Romance hasn't really been an important part of this show, so to make a big revelation of Kumiko realizing her love for Shuichi would feel out of place.  But I also don't think we're going to get any pathetic, cheap yuribait like episode 11 scene either. Yamada is doing the storyboard for this episode, and based on her previous work I doubt she'd stoop that low.     I finally understand the context of this picture.  Reina is murdering Kumiko.     Someone needs to shop Ufo-kun and a shadow of Reina with a knife.     No, I expect a solid one. They've been lacking really because they had to go crazy with the yuri bait.     Where is that image even from? Is it just fan art or an official one?     I finally understand  No anon, you don't.     That teacher hhhnnng    It was one of the very first pieces of official art, and its purpuse obviously was to bait otaku into that nifty new Kyoani show since that artwork looks like POV shot of somebody about to rape Kumiko. If there's one thing all otaku love, it's fat faceless men raping virginal highschool girls.    You're right. They should stop making art so people can see anime as art.    Her ankles though    The Euphonium player is kinda cute.     most highschoolers are ugly  Holy shit anon you are onto something.      anime with so little confidence in its story it has to resort to school girls almost humping each other for the viewers' titillation   art      Can't blame them after hearing best girl Asuka play that part. Asuka raised the bar too high for Kumiko.    The concert scene is one thing they could animate in advance, you know?    I'm still mad about this.  Hibike! Euphonium could have been Kyoani's magnum opus, the first work since Hyouka to surpass it.  But they had to completely shit on it and ruin it just because that faggot Hanada can't go five minutes without an obnoxious yuribait fanservice scene.        Anime is a mistake.     virginal  I don't wanna know how often her cactus was slimy.      mfw he's working with Kyoani again for their next show     When will Kyoani fire that faggot already? All of the Kyoani shows he wrote the script for flopped.     mfw     You're overreacting     He's right. People focus more on the shipfaggotry rather than the story.      Maybe on this shitty board.     I don't go to under anime related websites, but I was under the impression that shipfaggotry is even more insufferable on most of them, and that the conversations almost exclusively revolve around it. Is that not the case?    This shit is everywhere, the only thing that differs is the tone of the debate.   You can travel back in time to the day before the first episode aired.  What would you tell yourself about the show?      Stop kidding yourself. It's every discussion forum.     Cheer for Natsuki and Haruka, it would be a good investment. Avoid Asuka.     It'll never get S2.     Even though I know it won't happen, I'd probably have more respect for the show if it actually went all the way and made Kumiko/Reina canon in the end. At least then there'd be a point to all the yuribaiting.    Avoid all threads on /a/ (or anywhere else for that matter) after episode 8 like the plague.    What does that have to do with the quality of the actual show?  I'm not sure what you would like the Kumiko x Reina scenes to be replaced with either. I know we would all like more music, but without the Kumiko x Reina scenes where would Kumiko's character development come from? Shuuichi?      Not him but the blatant yuribait scenes did feel really out of place in the show and since it'll lead nowhere it was simply pointless to add it in the first place.    Horiguchi is nowhere to be seen    Horiguchi left Kyoani.    If Reina is supposed to be awkward around people then have her be awkward not price charming. Less yuribait more freindship that actually help Kumiko and Reina develop.    Yeah, same. I don't have a problem with the yuri part, I have a problem with the bait part. If they decided to make a yuri romance, fair enough, that also could have made it a great show. But this bait is just pathetic.   Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem. It's like watching two completely different shows when you compare those scenes to all the other scenes. They could have portrayed their relationship as an intense, emotional relationship without resorting to trying to make them look as gay as possible.        since it'll lead nowhere  Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  Who cares about where they'll "lead. It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.       She took a break from animating and illustrates full-time now.     It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.  And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers, which is cheap and irritating when everyone knows they're both supposed to be straight.      It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.   But that's the fucking point. What they're doing is provide pointless fanservice to give yurifags something to wank over. That certainly does not enhance the show's quality and just invites the endless shipperfaggotry we got.       Sauce? I've heard this before but with no real source.      Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem.  These two statements are rather contradictory. It's not that you didn't like them. It's just that you found them unlikeable.     The problem in those scenes are the fact that they stick out like a sore thumb from the rest of the show in a bad way. KyoAni are perfectly capable of portraying intense platonic friendship and yet they went with making Kumiko and Reina look as gay as possible.     Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  But that's just the thing. Even without knowing what happens in episode 13, we can already consider them meaningless based on all the other episodes.  Episode 8 made them look like lovers. Then episode 9 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends. Then episode 10 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends and we learned Reina loves Taki-Sensei. Then episode 11 happened, and it made them look like lovers again. Then episode 12 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends, and they made it obvious once again that Reina loves Taki-Sensei.  It's schizophrenic.        Would you have the audacity to practice trombone or any musical instrument at your local river/creek?   What he's saying is that he doesn't like the way their scenes were handled. KyoAni's writing them as lovers when they're supposed to be friends.     And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers  Who the fuck cares. Why does this bother you.  What important is why the scene is there in the first place.   You know what, fuck it, I'm tired of speaking in the abstract. If you're referring to the scene from episode 11, then just say it. I can understand how someone can say that that scene at least made them seem like "gay lovers", but I don't know what other scenes you're accusing of seeming out of place.       AniDo announces a BL eroge adaptation under their own name You heard it here first    http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/644<wbr>86</wbr>    Not at night    What's her name?    Peace-chan     Why does this bother you.  Because it's cheap. It's like the staff held a meeting and said "yeah, we know they're both straight girls and they end up with dudes in the end, but fuck it, let's bait the yurifags as hard as we can so we can make more shekels."     Yoshigawa Akiko?  You really can't read hiragana?      Seems like you just have a narrower view of what is acceptable behaviour for two straight girls than I do.   I mean Yoshizawa.        KyoAni is the pure responsible older sister that doesn't prostitute its characters   AniDo is their rebellious contrarian little sister and goes owl out with the fanservice       Why does this bother you.  See  Their portrayal is all over the place. That's not good storytelling.       Episode 8 made them look like lovers.   No it didn't. It really didn't. What the fuck does it mean to you to "look like lovers".  Then episode 9 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends.  Reina hardly showed up in 9, but she was just as close with Kumiko as she was in the previous ep.  Then episode 10 happened, and we learned Reina loves Taki-Sensei.   Something that's been obvious since episodes 4 and 5.   You keep talking about things going back and forth, but nothing about their relationship seems different after they became close in episode 8. The only thing that changes is the amount of scenes they have together, and whether or not one of those scenes happens to be an emotional one. An emotional scene, mind you, that makes perfect sense within the story.  If two characters for some reason hug in one episode and don't in the next, are you going to assume then as well that the story is being schizophrenic?            I think there's some misunderstanding going on here.  It's not that I hated those scenes, it's that I hated how out of place with the rest of the show they were. See:  If they made them a couple, and made them be madly in love with each other, fair enough. But that's not what they did. If you're going to just imply yuri with subtext, then do it far more lightly. When you make it this grandiose, you really should deliver on it.         I appreciate that the anime gave focus to Reina, Kumiko wasnt supposed to interact with her much until ep 8, but the blatant yuri bait was obnoxious.     Episode 12 had the best portrayal. They were close good friends but it stayed within the boundary of friendship.     &gt;KyoAni is the pure responsible older sister that doesn't prostitute its characters  I-I was actually making a joke about KyoAni KEY adaptations.     They go to a hill at night and play a duet together titled The Place Where We Found Love and you seriously claim Kyoani didn't make it look romantic? Not to forget that unnecessary yuribait with the lip touching.     You really can't read hiragana?  Yeah I cant, thanks.     If you didn't read the novel spoilers it wouldn't of been obvious.     KEY   eroge  W-what.       It's like the staff held a meeting and said "yeah, we know they're both straight girls and they end up with dudes in the end, but fuck it, let's bait the yurifags as hard as we can so we can make more shekels."  You see, this is the problem. Imagine you didn't know anything about the original novel. Would the scenes bother you this much then? Just enjoy the story for what it is.       No it didn't. It really didn't.  Really?      wouldn't of  Just where is this shit coming from.     AIR and Kanon have 18+ versions with H.    You somehow fail to understand that those cheap yuribait scenes look out of place in the show.    How can you say that with a straight face one day after the ABP Ova? They literally whored everyone in that show.     Even if he didn't read the spoilers the next episode literally negates episode 8. At that point you'd be wondering if it was all bait all along.      Imagine you didn't know anything about the original novel. Would the scenes bother you this much then?  If I didn't know anything about the original novel I'd be expecting the two bitches to end up together in the last episode.      No it didn't. It really didn't. What the fuck does it mean to you to "look like lovers".  Obviously, with all the meta knowledge from the novel spoilers, the "confession of love" line from the novels, etc. we know that those scenes are meant to show them just as close friends who share an emotional bond, that Kumiko is captivated by Reina's presence and that Reina has no understanding of the concept of personal space.  But if we were taking the show at just face value, looking at the episode 8 scene, it's clear that they intentionally made it look as romantic as possible to make people question whether they romantically love each other.  It's easy to interpret all these scenes correctly when taken into context and with all the additional knowledge we have due to novel spoilers and the like. But someone who is just watching the show, not participating in any discussion, not knowing about the spoilers, they would have a completely different interpretation, and this is something Kyoani has done intentionally just to mess with their viewers.          If you didn't read the novel spoilers it wouldn't of been obvious.  No, Anon. It really was obvious. Why the fuck would she go out of her way in ep 4 when someone spoke ill of Taki? Why did she notice him before everyone else in ep 2? Why did her eyes sparkle when she said his name in ep 5?  Sure you can make the argument that she highly respected him, but even if you knew nothing of the novels, when you heard her confess that she loved him in ep 10, it's obvious that should make sense to you.  Also,  wouldn't of          I dropped Amagi after 3 episodes so I wouldn't know. But somehow I'm not surprised since it seemed like a souless quick cashgrab with all the fanservice.    subs when   There was no indication of romance prior to episode 8. Kumiko just wanted to reconcile with Reina.    mfw that will never happen     IRC literally took over the place   Is this what a normal friendship between two girls looks like?   That doesn't make them look like lovers you tap dancing autist. Looking like lovers involves /two people/. If anything, that just makes Reina look like a sexual predator. Reina alone, mind you.     No, but Reina stating he wants Taki-sensei's D in the previous episode you'd think it's just blatant yuri pandering.     It's a OVA, you fucking retard, stop saying bullshit.    Dropping the best show on its season last year.  There you go shit taste.         It makes Reina look highly sexual aggressive, but since Kumiko is not negatively reacting to it, it makes her look like she doesn't mind it.    What are you on about? This is pretty much the most calm and civilized discussion about yuri in these threads that we have had for over a month.     But if we were taking the show at just face value, looking at the episode 8 scene, it's clear that they intentionally made it look as romantic as possible to make people question whether they romantically love each other.  Or maybe it was meant to be a romantic scene despite their lack of actual gayness. I agree that Kyoani enhanced their scenes together to enhance their gayness, but I don't think they went too far.   They aren't meant to ｈａｖｅ　ａ　ｎｏｒｍａｌ　ｆｒｉｅｎｄｓｈｉｐ． That's pretty much half the show, that they aren't just regular friends.   Sexual? Really?            goalpost moving  The point was that their mountain scenes were intentionally made to look romantic.   If you're denying that there's any yuribaiting, then saying that Reina "looks like a sexual predator" contradicts that as well.        it was meant to be a romantic scene despite their lack of actual gayness.  That's exactly what people are so annoyed about, dude.     It's called Class S you uneducated pleb.      I agree that Kyoani enhanced their scenes together to enhance their gayness, but I don't think they went too far.   But they did. They also downplayed Kumiko's attraction to Shuichi to make the yuri credible. They went too far obviously.        it seemed like a souless quick cashgrab  They actually just did it as favour for an old friend. Shoji Gatoh is pals with some KyoAni higher-ups. I highly doubt they would've taken a Kadokawa project on otherwise.      &gt;goalpost moving  I don't think you understand what that means.  The point was that their mountain scenes were intentionally made to look romantic.   And?  If you're denying that there's any yuribaiting, then saying that Reina "looks like a sexual predator" contradicts that as well.  I have been, from the beginning, denying that any of these scenes are out of place and detrimental to the quality of the show.         Intentionally forcing romantic scenes between two characters who are not romantically in love with each other is detrimental to the quality of the show because it is misleading, cheap, bad writing for the sole purpose of baiting yurifags.    But why? It's like you've decided that they can't have this kind of relationship because they aren't actually gay, but isn't the whole point of their scenes to show that they don't have a normal friendship? That this kind of thing is just the way they are? Yes, Kyoani played it up a bit, or a lot, but it's not like they took a friendship that was similar to Kumiko and Hazuki's and propelled it to what they have now, it was already pretty far along this path in the novels. I think you would still be calling this yuribait or whatever else even if they had kept 100% to the novels.    Do you feel betrayed?    That scene in the novel, feels less gay. Sure Kumiko thinks about the physical aspect of it a lot, but it seemed more friendly compare to KyoAni. It wasn't meant to look romantic in the novels. Cause Kumiko was more concern about Shuuichi and Reina acted straight.     It makes Reina look highly sexual aggressive, but since Kumiko is not negatively reacting to it, it makes her look like she doesn't mind it.  She's not reacting positively, either. She's in fact not reacting at all. It's almost entirely Reina's game. But regardless, if I were to play devil's advocate to uphold your point, then yes, maybe it could look like they have crushes on each other, but really, the entire show up to that point had kind of been doing the same thing.      I'm not a yurifag, so no.   Kyoani is based for exposing and taunting the degeneracy of yuri and its followers.    I think you would still be calling this yuribait or whatever else even if they had kept 100% to the novels.  Not that guy, and I haven't read the novels. But from what I heard from the people who supposedly read the novels, Shuichi plays a much more prominent role in Kumiko's train of thoughts in the novels, and her interest in him is far more obvious.  So even with all the "yuribait" scenes in the novels, you are constantly aware that she likes Shuichi, so the scenes themselves come off as far less romantic.  Kyoani intentionally downplayed Shuichi in the anime and made Kumiko's attraction to him a lot less obvious. This, coupled with even more "yuribait" than there was in the novels, made those scenes gives a pretty different impression than they did in the novels.        Why does Reina have no friends prior to Kumiko? Why does she strive to be special?   She's an autistic chuuni with a superiority complex.     Why does she strive to be special?  for Taki     Amagi was fucking shit and if you seriously thought it was best anything your taste is beyond help.    No one else is special enough to be friends with her. Except Asuka, but she's a bit too special.     Kyoani did a good job damaging the anime. This will series will mostly be remembered as that obnoxious yuri pandering BS that went nowhere.     Pretty much this.     We never did see Asuka interact with Reina. I wonder what it would be like.     Asuka knows Reina is fucking crazy and probably avoids her as much as she can.  Sociopaths are great judges of human character.       between two characters who are not romantically in love  Heh. But that aside, you can interpret the end of episode 8 as being romantic, sure. But really, you don't have to. There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.      If they also followed the novel, then Kumiko would also be walking with Shuuichi home. In novel she never walked with Hazuki and Midori. Hazuki walked with her other friends and Midori had cram school. Kumiko either walked alone or with Shuuichi.    Good. Yurifags ruin everything, Kyoani tsunting them is beautiful. All that's left would be Madoka 3 where Madoka kills Homura and gets a boyfriend. More shows need to do this.     not made to look romantic   The Place Where We Found Love   confession of love   not made to look romantic         Fuck that, I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the show just to make yurifags mad.      There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.  Compared to their scene in episode 11, I guess episode 8 does look less romantic.     The quality rises when you shit on people who wear yuri goggles.    The confession of love line was in the book as well. And as the previous Anon said, not really romantic. It's simply an easily misinterpreted phrase. As for the name of the song, maybe the staff just likes that particular Hanako Oku song.     and the keks too      maybe the staff just likes that particular Hanako Oku song.   Or maybe they just like to bait faggots.        It's simply an easily misinterpreted phrase.  That's the crux of the argument. Kyoani intentionally made it so all these scenes can be easily misinterpreted.       There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.  Then how come a million yurifags flooded the threads, declared "hetfags" to be "BTFO" and started speculating about an anime original lesbian endgame?    Who invited the shitposters?   And delicious tears. Can you imagine how sweet it'd be if, say, they did a sequel to Yuyuyu where they all get boyfriends and the lesbian finally kills herself? Hopefully Kyoani is setting a precedent here.   Judging by the conversations that have been dominating these threads for the past couple of days, is it safe to assume that virtually no one here still believes in a yuri end?  I'd post a strawpoll but I doubt it would take the proxy dude long to get to it.     Me. I'm sorry.     http://strawpoll.me/4745005    Only degenerates ever did, hahaha!    Everything about their relationship can be easily misinterpreted, so KyoAni kicked the pandering into overdrive to make sure yurifags got baited while simultaneously keeping hetfags on board.  Too bad it backfired and the show is selling pretty poorly for KyoAni.       You'll always still find those rare delusional faggots who still believe in yuri end.    Good morning /a/!   I hope you have a wonderful day     I found this:  http://www.kaga-create.co.jp/saki/i<wbr>ndex.html</wbr>    lots of the character pix being posted on the live futaba thread   This is another Shinohayu leak.   That's from months ago.   When was the last time you got a chombo?   That is disgraceful     Eh Gokumi is still jew enough to only provide still picture instead of real animation for the Vita game.   Cashgrab.        waiting almost 3 months for the game to be released    Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released. Please look forward to it   I just started watching this. It's fun but don't understand what's going on when they are playing   I really hope there's another Saki Live. I would fucking book a trip to japan just to see it. I'd probably cry from hearing all that amazing music live.     That entire fucking website   Did an intern design this shit?  Also   Now you can play mahjong even after being condemned to the beach!          Please get hyped for the loading screens. Does anyone have rips of the loading screens from the other 2 games?    Sounds about right, actually. Most people start off watching for the cute girls, and get interested in mahjong later.   I don't think a manga has ever quite made my blood boil with excitement quite like Saki does.   Since then, many of us are stuck    Why is this so mesmerizing to watch?     /sp/-lite, chinktile edition.     L E G E N D E G E N D          Since when did mahjong become a sport?     The game's coming out in 3 months. It might get released without a trailer ever even being produced.    Since people toki'd while playing it.    I made a commitment and I intend to stick to it no matter what.   Remember Tohai? Episode two has been subbed.  www.viki.com/videos/1063663v-tohai-<wbr>i-episode-2</wbr>     I feel like Ritz really likes using the "fire in front of the eye" thing to indicate that a character is scary.    I hope someone will translate the new Akagi live action.   Damn that Washizu really looks like that guy from Umineko, while Akagi didn't looked as badass as I hope.      Since Achiga turned t/a/noshii threads into a microcosm of /sp/.  The legendary shitstorms of the last 5 chapters of Achiga-hen or so would make /sp/ proud.       6 school   I hope they increase the amount of school      There's gonna be DLC so perhaps we'll get Usuzan and Rinkai later. I will pay top dollar to play as Shiratodai again.     Kind of disappointing that they didn't include the other schools.    Yesterday i accidentally declared ron on my grandpa without a yaku     What is this? Computer mahjong that doesn't make chombo impossible? Not sure if epic fail or epic win.      Because you're self-inserting as the monkey and living the dream.     I want to fuck Kuro     School section   Every girl has cute cut-in except for Saki   Anon I'm scared      did shitrue get destroyed by Grandmaster yet?   Why is there no link on Osamuko? Someone else translated it?    That's still a half a year to a year off, at the pace Shinohayu is at.    Actually, scratch that, it's closer to two years or so.   If they show a middle school tournament, we'll see Grandmaster around 2020.   And if you add those 20s together, you get her age as well!           lightning under you      We are Toki        But Onee-chan...     Kikes &gt; dykes   Cakes = Best of All.  http://zudo-n.blogspot.de/2015/06/2<wbr>2.html  slackers out  so fourth round of the best 8 next.    </wbr>   hmm, here you can see more of the played hands. http://blog.goo.ne.jp/katsu666/e/2a<wbr>eedd138a65ca979a7314f89a9039dd</wbr>     does it mean what I think that it means?  August can't come soon enough.  http://blog.goo.ne.jp/katsu666/e/a0<wbr>69cfc92f53d9103f3e2560ec012ec3</wbr>        I don't get it.    The same guy translated it, he probably just forgot to post about it.      Shino lost or the best 2 pass the round?    Is the one on the left the girl that wanted the others to kneel down in front of her?   Just started watching the Saki anime, if it's good I will read the manga afterwards. So far I'm not really that impressed, though. In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules. But I'll give it some time, maybe these are just some starting problems.     Does a chombo round get repeated like when the dealer wins or it's a draw with dealer tenpai? Because if it isnt couldn't you use a deliberate chombo to win the game in the last round if you're more than 10 or 12k ahead and will still have 30k+ afterwards?       Best 2 advance, so the number of players is halved from this round onward: from 16 to 8 (next round) to the final 4.   Ritz chapter / short series will start in August.        In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules.  Which one?      In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules.   Like what? Absurd fluctuations in probability and magic I ain't gotta explain shit moments aside, the anime is pretty accurate to the rules of the game.  Do note that they do insert some house rules some times.        Saki wanted to end a game with +/-0 so she ignored a possible ron on a 5pin, because the player who played it was currently in the lead and she would overtake her. Then directly on the next turn a red 5pin was discarded. It was explained (by the club president) that Saki ignored the tile as well, because with the additional red 5 her hand would become to big to finish with +/-0. Howver since she ignored the 5pin in the turn before she was furiten for it anyway and couldn't call it even if she wanted. So the president didn't seem to know that rule which is hardly believable as this is absolute basic defensive strategy.    see    Nodoka dealt the red 5 after Saki's turn, so Saki wasn't in furiten.    Wow I don't remember CG being used for anything but the mahjong table mechanics.     If the player ignores a hand completing tile discard from an opponent, they are in temporary furiten until their next draw.  That said, you can see in  that Nodoka is after Saki. Riichi Mahjong follows a Counter-Clockwise flow. By the time that Nodoka drops the Aka 5p, Saki is no longer in furiten as she would've drawn another tile by then.       Also, that was all in the first episode, not the second episode.   As everyone else said, Saki was in tenpai on 6th discard. Yuuki's 5pin was her 7th discard, and Nodoka's 5pin was her 8th discard. They skip some rounds for pacing reasons and you can just assume everyone knows the rules (except Kaori).   Shit I can't count. 6/7/8 should be 7/8/9, but you get the point    Interesting but is this really the time Ritz? It better be Saki related at least and it seems a little early for Teruhayu.     If the player ignores a hand completing tile discard from an opponent, they are in temporary furiten until their next draw.  Yeah, I know. But I'm pretty sure the tiles were consecutive discards without Sakis turn inbetween, Nodoka discarded the 5pin and then that genki girl (can't remember her name) discarded the red 5. I will rewatch it later when I'm home, though and see if I missed something.     See   That's the table of the game. Remember, Riichi is counter-clockwise. Hell, here is a page from the manga depicting the seat order.    Nodoka discarded the 5pin and then that genki girl (can't remember her name) discarded the red 5.   Well, theres your fucking problem. You're remembering things wrong. Yuuki dropped a regular 5p and Nodoka dropped the red 5p.  Yuuki (genki girl) first discarded the regular 5p which Saki ignored. Then came Mako (green hair) and Saki's turns. By the time Nodoka dropped the red 5p, Saki has drawn from the wall and ended her temporary furiten.              These kids play better than Seiko.     Not that guy, but I think he's talking about that totally-real-biography by that Koizumi guy.    Maybe they'll annouce an spin off with Akagi?    she will try to find her father in Shimane prefecture this time.   RitzHayu      I wonder what the story is between those two. They must be friends IRL or something.   TOKI TOKI   TOKI! AKAN!    Every time that Ritz wins a mahjong game he has to do a special chapter. Don't ask what she has to do if he wins - it never happened.  Just joking.       伝説の少女 説 の 少 女         He's her long-lost father.   This thread better not go Toki again.  Which show would you like to see a crossover with? I think the girls from Yuyuyu are lesbian enough to reach the finals.    who?     Free! Eternal Summer     Named characters remainung in the bowl: Shino, Kokoro, Zenno, Legend, Cat Chamber. Place your bets who will be playing against Shino and Kokoro in the next round and who will pass to final.    Bamboo Blade. Vanguard: Azuma Sergeant: Miya Miya Lieutenant: Saya Vice Captain: Kirino Captain: Tama-chan         We don't know if the players will be split up or not, so Shino and Kokoro could play together.  I also want to see Harue and Mihirogi.      Too bad al of YuYuYu girls get it worse than Toki after using powers.    Akagi    Akagi should teach at Kiyosumi.     Akagi's in space.     Kainou-pro could channel his spirit.   Rough predictions for final game. Teru+ Satoha+ Kuro- Yuki- Sumire+ Hao+ Yuu- Mako- Shibuya- Choe+ Ako+ Hisa- Seiko+ Megan- Arata- Nodoka+ Awai- Nelly- Shizuno+ Saki+/-0        The Legend of Koizumi.     Pft. Rinkai isn't making it to the finals. Uzusan and Himematus for the win!     Wouldn't that mean Kiyosumi loses? Nodoka isn't that good.  Also Seiko + seems off.      I feel like Saki should be breaking out of her +/- 0 shell and  dragging the world into new era of despair,  showing her sister how far she's come.    Achiga loses and shitrue kills herself. The end.     And then she is reborn, stronger and more dangerous than before.    How do you pronounce 7447? Seven-four-four-seven? Seventyfour-fourtyseven? Nana-yon-yon-nana? Nanajuyon-yonjunana?     seven four four seven    Nanoha.    Though I want Usuzan to pass, Nelly has to job harder than Seiko did for it to happen (she clearly doesn't intend to) and Himematsu facing Kiyosumi three times in a row is against the flow. Besides, Rinkai are the only ones who are absolutely not playing in racist individuals, so finals will be the last we can see of them.  Vice-captain prediction is the one I am most confident in. Megan's and Arata's powers were fully explored, while Seiko's weren't, so she should have an edge over them. As for Nodoka, she is middle school champion, period. Now that she doesn't restrict herself from using left hand the game will be a one-sided massacre with Seiko barely surviving.      Семь-четыре-четыре-семь.    I'd be up for some zenryouku zenkai yakuman bombs.    Seventy four four seven     Saki will decide to destroy Nelly, in a vicious scorched earth maneuver that leaves them both robbed of points, while the other two schools squeak by.   Then it is revealed that Nelly dies her hair and wears contacts.       7,447. Seven, four-forty-seven.    At what rate does this get subbed?    I think the last time I saw the first episode posted was around 6 months ago.     1:0     Are you telling me i have to wait 6 months on that cliffhanger?    I'm telling you that I have no idea.   Bump for Shinohayu raws Also Fujita-pro's birthday.    The translator intends to do the rest, but if he's too slow you can always just watch the raws or read the manga.

This is a miracle I wish I'd known about years ago    She looks like a real woman. What could have been...    i'd hollow out tile, put the ring in it, and throw it at a little girl      I don't read moon or know how to play Mahjong but I'm getting the game anyway, wish me luck /a/.     I would abduct her from her tents in the middle of the night. <br/>      What is the first thing real life people will do with this game?     Rape it.     I think you should let her ron on it.    That wasn't deep at all Teru.    Where's her horn?    Hair only sticks up when it's short     Fine, next time it'll be straight into the kidneys.    Never realized Saki-san has the same VA as Rin from Fate. Nice range.    She sounds closer to Saki as Hayate.    Toki, do you ever think people are looking at us from somewhere beyond our reality.  No, Ryuuka, that's just silly talk.      second strongest school     What does Toyone's height smell like?    Cucumber Melon    Years.  Good luck, anon.      I like how she comes into focus towards the end.   Riichi Ippatsu Tsumo vs. open Tanyao  Which is more annoying when you have yakuman tempai?     Riichi Ippatsu Tsumo, unless it's open Tanyao dora 3.     AI Mahjong   Start in North Seat   Get Chiihou tenpai, get hype as fuck   Suddenly, West scores a Renhou from South's discard   Well, actually the game doesn't recognize Renhou so the winning hand was actually a plain tanyao but still.   And I never played AI Mahjong ever again          If you mean that someone won while you had a yakuman hand (implied by ippatsu tsumo) then riichi ippatsu tsumo because of the ippatsu yaku.  Open tanyao is a valid strategy to win a round quickly and to prevent that another player wins a big hand.       Which is more annoying when you have yakuman tempai?  How about choosing the wrong wait, only to see what could've been the winning tile spill out in front of you?     Subscribed to your mahjong blog   Anyone ever gotten a junchan + sanshoku?  DON'T YOU DIE ON ME   I did back when I used to play the game in Tenhou. I had a baiman, but it wasn't enough to beat the 1st place.    I want to  NTR_  Ryuuka.   Let this thread stay toki.    What if she gained weight?     Then I can share her with Toki.   Just don't expect to share Toki.   ~   I want to play  tenhou_  with you guys!     With long hair, Saki looks a lot like Shino.     keep the thread alive  Still waiting for proper raws. ~30 pages of Shinohayu    DEPEETS LROE    Igarashi working hard as always.  Ritz should just officially make Saki monthly and do a consistent 30 pages instead of constant delays and broken promises.     What makes you think it'll make any difference? Give her a month, and we'll get one chapter every two months.  Ritz's a hack.          30 page   Hard work   Please, in the old days she could curn out 70 or 80 page no problem.   Ritz stop pestering her.           Could they POSSIBLY be related?     Yeah, a couple. I threw on an iipeiko once for top level beauty, but I haven't been able to replicate that one as much as I've tried    Is she the angry faced pro in the main series.  I don't really want to plunge in to Shinohayu since I am waiting it to end first to avoid hell waits.      That's because Ritz locked up Igarashi in the basement during the run of Achiga.  Since then, Igarashi reported Ritz to the authorities and so Ritz couldn't employ the "Lock-Igarashi-in-the-basement-unti<wbr>l-she-finishes-the-pages" tactic anymore.</wbr>      That's Ritz.  Read it anyway and wait with us.   Igarashi should give Ritz a taste of her own medicine.       Ritz is busy taking photos for the backgrounds.  She asked to set Shinohayu in Okinawa (hello Kokoro, Wakane) or Hawaii, but it was rejected by the editor. I wonder why...       raws  posted 7 hours ago.   I was busy  working , sorry.  http://raw.senmanga.com/Shinohayu-T<wbr>he-Dawn-of-Age/022/1  http://raw.senmanga.com/Saki-Biyori<wbr>-Otona-no-Maki/39/1</wbr>  </wbr>                   and so it starts      Shino has two fans already. Time to spread the tanoshii.     nice starting hand     Shino has two fans already.  Does Richardson not count?     riichi    Among the people that competed in the national (not counting Richardson, Kanna, Hayarin, and the other girls from home).  riichi tsumo pinfu tanyao dora 1        Kokoro also had a scary hand and was waiting for 3m.     Someday Ritz will end up convincing her editor to send her to Georgia.   Wonderful!       Ah yeah, Ritz and the Dukes of Hazzard County.  Let's have ourself an oppai Daisy.       The second hand went quick    forgot the pic    You're a retard Megan. Stay in America.    at least it wasn't 9p    Touka without desuwa?    Nope, not good enough.    This match is the best in a while and will be great with animation and voice acting. All the new girls are potential top tier martial, especially Yada Janai.     another win for Shino     Katanas can't cut steel beams, Satoha, katanas can't cut steel beams!     Satoha didn't looks like the type of girl that would be mean to her employee, at least she's probably in good relationship with Megan and Hao.    But they can stop terrorists and that's all that matters.   Satoha is a lovely young lady and will one day become a generous and forgiving Yakuza leader.      tanyao and three dora...    it's a trap...      And the game ends with a heavy hand and a rare yaku.    Naoko did nothing wrong - it's a shame that she was eliminated too.    run girls run    she's so happy and nice...    But she should get a better taste in juices. She made someone mad with her dorian juice.  Last page, next chapter in a month.     A new challenger appears.   This is fake, right?

SONO CHI NO KIOKU ORA ORA ORA ORA    It felt that way for me until the boss tried killing Trish, then it felt rushed as shit.  What confused me the most is that Giorno couldn't revive Narancia once his body was revived. I mean, Joseph came back to life and we saw his soul pass on for God's sake.     Did Araki every mention if it was Josuke who put his coat under the car and saved baby Josuke, and he just forgot to put it in?   Araki probably forgot Joseph was revived  Or maybe it was because he was revive from vampire blood and not stand magic?      It was just some guy.    Why did araki even revive joseph? I like him but it was so unnecessary.    I'd imagine he wanted to do something about that with Bites za dusto but ran out of time    it was josefumi of course    So we could have character development for Josuke, silly   Would you let rule 63 kira suck on your fingers?   Can Bites za dusto go back that far or am I just naive for not expecting an Araki brand ass pull.    n-no    Maybe he had already planned a bit of part 4's plot?  The only reason they found out about Josuke is because Joseph was planning his will, if he died in SC then DiU would never have happened      o rite  what if Josuke was Holly's second son?      Finding out your dad is dead isn't the type of news a person recovering from a nearly deathlike state needs to hear.    Would she kill me afterwards? I would let her suck my every inch for eternity.    nigger josuke didn't know who his father was until he was like 16  tfw no runaway girl doujinshi      no episode tomorrow    no chapter  I'm not feeling it anymore     Y'know, rule 63 every main villain except for DIO, and I'd be their fuckpuppet for all eternity  and DIO too      Hes talking about holly retard.    Why did that cat plant obey KQ and live in his stomach?    I was talking about Holly you double nigger.    Well this is embarrassing. Meant for<br/>    ZW will never do a porn with SP recording  Fuck DIO. If only he was good. ZW and SP could act all like bros and shit.    oh shieeeeet  fucking misleading faggot          I hate how in Jojo All Star Battle they gave pre Kosaku Kawajiri Kira the shity non killer queen tie.     What if there was a universe where stands were the people and humans were the stands?  What would this scene look like with the other jojo crews?  Continuing from the whole only stand user in the world thing, I think being a vampire would be fucking awesome as long as a random bit of UV light wouldn't kill you. Being able to slowly make my way to the top of the world under a lot of different identities over the years and having my own clan of vampires under me would be sweet.

Or rather can anyone dank it up, making him say "I came here to laugh at you" or even "I came here to kek at you"   Why didn't F.F. let herself get revived? She'd probably still be a good guy even if she wasn't the same F.F.

Is this confirmed? I always assumed Araki never confirmed or denied it is the same universe.     Nah, Dio's World really does have a ridiculous amount of "Why doesn't X do Y?" and it's all the more noticable when you're watching it instead of reading it at your own pace.    that's where i watch jojo before i download it if you have a high quality ova download feel free to link it     That too. Lots of plot armor and stupid crap Araki wrote at the time.     animeonly fags   unmanageable hype  oh anon      Are you serious? Did nyaa and all the private trackers shutdown or something?     never confirmed or denied it is the same universe  this, but the joestars being nowhere near florida convinces most people that there is no way for irene to get the star birthmark.     hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I failed to understand how this proves anything.   Favorite non Main Villain Stand battle in each part? I'll start. Part 3: D'arby The Gamer Part 4: Highway Star Part 5: Metallica Part 6: Guard Westwood's Secret Part 7: Scary Monsters Part 8: Born This Way         It's not just that. The SBRverse is different in ways that would make no sense if it was because of MIH.   I want the next main Jojo villain to be a girl. Is that too much to ask for?   3. Vanilla Ice 4. Highway Star 5. Metallica 6. Bohemian Rhapsody 7. True Man's World 8. Beetlemania         I think it would be really nice to have a female antagonist for once. I would really like to see what Araki would do.     I'M SORRY?     i'm serious in that i've never bothered to download the ova, yeah     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190937  what the fuck is that   You know what jojo rule 63 art I hope/wish exists? Something that would show Dio and Johnathan's body types being different in some way (like one having bigger boobs than the other or something), making it obvious that DIO has johnathan's body      we posting anime fakes?    where are these from?          I grabbed them from a past thread, reverse search gave me nothing Yukako looks super legit, i would be pleased if that was her official design.     koichi looks like an actual shark     that forehead  HNNNNG      whyy   Nose ruins it. The rest is pretty good tho.      TELL ME ABOUT CRAZY DIAMOND! WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK?     They're from Pixiv.     Because his soul couldn't find a body to go into Joseph got lucky and got the joestar blood from dio/Jonathan's body     IF I LOOP TIME WILL YOU DIE?    /jojo/ can get pretty bad as well.    No but it would be very GUREETO    what's wrong with ringo    Shouldn't Killer Queen be skip back and Mandom be rewind?    he bows man    How do you think DIO got women to lust after his dick for children? It was Jonathan's d they were after  men go after just DIOs essence      http://picosong.com/gQ7s/   Practice run, I'm nowhere near manly for this track so I'm gonna take a couple tries over a couple days and see if I improve.     expand my folder please   It's like 2008 all over again.    I thought Narancia was a girl from the start, had me fucked up when I realized there was a dick in between those thighs. It had me  Jaded    What's the difference between infinite speed and time stop?   Please dump all these into an imgur album,oh god.    Dump that shit, fehget    DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY    Infinite speed also means infinite velocity, something you can't have in stopped time.          Narancia looks the same    He always does.    No she'd kill you before   just started vol 46 second to last of part 4. favorite fight so far is the superfly tower, but the time loop thing was pretty cool  Should I wait on the retranslation for part 5 to finish or should I just finish it with the(apparently) shit one?    narancia a cute     how far along is the retranslation?  maybe the retranslation will vastly improve the quality of the story and get rid of that sour taste in reader's mouths      yfw Part 4 really might never be animated by David    I just finished the last chapter that was done and Its 4 parts into the fight with pic related.    It's really your call,man.You'll get told otherwise,but part 5 is kind of meh.I can understand why people like it,but I hate it with a passion and wish it didn't exist and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fucking faggot that I don't even want to talk to,but whatever.I don't judge.    No idea what happened. Heres the picture for real.    It's going to happen and you fucking know it.Even if DP hated the series they wouldn't pass up the oprotunity to make some more money.     tfw there is no porn of Johnathan and erina having marital sex with the lights on in the missionary position looking each-other in the eyes for the purpose of having a child.   why live?      Are you talking about the 1st or 4th opening?    so around vol 51-52ish?  I would wait til the whole thing is out but it might take a while. I have no idea how long translations take, what with groups flaking/losing interest      I have some but it's only a few pages long and drawn kind of meh.I can upload it to imgur if anyone's interested.   Chapter When?     Why do people think David won't do it?      do it     eye contact  filthy scum     Can I skip to part 6 without worries then and come back to it? I'm enjoying it so far but fuck me I'm too impatient to wait without something else to read.      Today would be the day by which we usually get a chapter released, but since that’s not the case I feel I should at least post an update about it rather then leave everyone in the dark.     We are having some trouble getting scans from the magazine this month. Usually we have them by day 1 or 2 but when none of the members of the group live in Japan its really a month-to-month, seat of the pants thing, and we haven’t always had perfect luck and consistency with raw provision. This is just one of those months.    Hopefully we will have raws this week and can release the chapter by the weekend or like Monday. Rest assured once we have the raws, we will all work tirelessly to deliver the chapter as quickly as possible.    Thanks for the patience, and please look forward to future releases.           Kars vs DIO  Who would win and why?     All of that and that's what ticks you off?    I've seen like 1. But it sucked.    Dio because he would stop time and send Kars off into space.    dunno haven't read part 6 yet I read everything in this order 3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4&gt;7&gt;5  was gonna start part 6 after I finish reading Robinson's Starman run at DC       Is it possible to kill Kars?    nice digits    How would he get Kars into space?     killing  who said anything about that? you don't need to kill Kars to win against him.     Kars DIO doesn't have asspulls powers and is literal fodder for pillermen     Found it.https://imgur.com/a/BRytB  It's worse than I remember so I added some good art I had of it at the end      Yeah but it's not like DIO can just throw Kars into space   So I started reading jojo after the show ended and I've gotten to this point.  I'm disconcerted and not really entertained so far. Diamond is unbreakable was great though.   Can I skip this shit ? Should I keep reading ? Is the next chapter better ?   Where the fuck is this story going?         Kars if only because I don't know that Dio could physically kill Kars even with timestop. Sending him to space isn't really gonna work either without a volcano or some other convenience.     skipping     DIO drops a road roller da  made of lava  on Kars   did the anime of part one and two make you go back and reread them with greater appreciation?   If you really have to I think you can skip it  It may be the most unimportant chapter in the entire series      You can skip it,and don't let anyone tell you different.     How would he get Kars into space?   TOKI WO TOMARE   carry Kars on your back   start spouting a generic evil monologue to activate "anime time"   stall long enough to fly all the way into orbit   ???   part 4 animated          araki really should've played up giorno being dio's son as a plot point more. like maybe have him viciously kill one of his opponents or use some of that dio charm some more   it's toki yo tomare you faggot    at least read the good translations anon geez ib4 you ask they're on batoto look harder     It's a meme you dip     Soshute toki wa imoki das      maybe have him viciously kill one of his opponents  you mean like he did to all of his opponents? not a single villain lived in part 5 and most are directly or indirectly killed by giorno       Where the fuck is this story going?  They're gonna take down the boss, duh. You realize there are color scans too right? With better translations to boot.       It's true  Diavolo had an even worse death than Kars       Nigger 4.5 PAGE MUDAMUDA Diavolo GIORNO IS NOT A JOJO. HE IS A FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.        4.5  7 pages anon, double pages count as 2. 7 and a panel counting the spike     He does use the Dio charm all of the crew are his fucking minions. He isn't really 'friendly' with them like any of the other jojos are with their crew     He's not a psychopath. He's something. I can't really tell at this moment since I'm at the beginning of the Pesci fight, but he's not a psycho.    Why does Giorno yell WRYYYYYYYYYYYYY again?  I thought that was a vampire thing?     ザ・ワールド！ 東京止まれ！ WRYYYYYYY       Ok, thank god. I can't take anything seriously.   Mista with his magic bullet dudes   Bruno has dimension zippers   Abachio might as well have nothing   who the fuck knows what narancia does   And I'd be more entertained peeling grapes than having to pay attention to Giorno.             well it is GE yelling it so maybe it is in the brando blood.    Fugo has the most interesting stand but it's only used once  Part 5 was a mess       hating sticky fingers    Does anyone have that webm of dark souls lagstab explaining King Crimson?     I am using batoto I guess I'm just retarded.      I was going to give you a catchup on the things you need to know about it before going to part 6,but then I remembered that literally nothing of lasting importance happens.Skip ahead,my friend.   Why didn't Jotaro just pay to get Jolyne a good lawyer?   no but i have this       implying that autist can think of something you need IQ above 80 to come up with     This made me belly laugh.   Thanks for the advice anon.       that disconnect/ragequit  Is this King Crimson Requiem? Punch so hard they are blown out of existance. Like GER.    what would the world's requiem power be?   permanent time stop    It'd probably be MiH. Requiem stands aren't related to the stand's original power - it's based off your heart's wish at the time. That's why Giorno didn't get GER during the first fight: he didn't have one singular wish that his entire being was focused on.    Made In Heaven     lava  Yeah that worked so well last time      who the fuck knows what narancia does  His is super simple. Its a mini fighter jet.   Can't take anything seriously  You did actually read part 4 right? The only things serious in that involve Kira. A lot of the rest is pretty silly.  Aliens   fighting over lottery money   Dice   Shrinkage    I mean I haven't finished part 5 yet but nothing about it seems to fall out of line after part 4. If anything the stands seem more creative and interesting.                 5000 hours in ms paint       Diego also said that... It's just a typical Dio thing.    I highly doubt even you'd be able to stop 13 million people old Dio buddy    Do it with Diego's The World. Fit's better.    So KC Requiem is skippig death?     The difference is part 4 was fun     SBR TW looks like it has downs    Fits perfectly with Made In Heaven then.    King Crimson Requiem would probably be "Skip GER's shit"    Who even knows what the fuck Diavolo's real goal was. Maybe it'd just be something that prevents anyone from knowing anything (meaningful, beyond enough to let them take orders) about Diavolo. Or something that lets him escape reality a-la Cream, only focused more heavily on its defensive capacities.     Maybe it'd just be something that prevents anyone from knowing anything   So..... KCR gets BtD?      KCR's ultimate power is  making people leave you alone        It had its moments    So what even are stands?Will Araki ever explore the alien parasite thing?Why did Jesus give people stands?Was Jesus an alien?Will we ever get a mini-manga about the adventures of Jo-sus with his stand 『KING OF CARROT FLOWERS』 and his brojo Peter?   post yfw the BDs have   Sono Chi no Sadame   Get Back   Part 4 Teaser         If they do Part 4, I hope Echoes ACT 3 keeps Koichi's voice actor.    KCR It nullifies someone's knowledge about Diavolo.     well stand arrows seem to not exist in SBR so I doubt the meteor stuff carried over.    If you believe Jorge Joestar it was actually  Dio     the world is a requiem, since that dio can freeze things in part 1 and then with the bow and arrow he can freeze time (dio was the first person who has the bow and arrow)    What if KCR nullified Diavolo?    It would be golden. Although the translation makes Act 3 sound like a thug. I'm really just anticipating sheer heart attack in general.    fuck off with your shitty theory faggot It was diavolo who sold the arrow to dio     I'm not sure how to respond to that.    How the fuck did you even get that.     you'll never get to use the stone mask     jail breaks are more fun    I feel like this was the exact thing I said last thread but made into something stupid     can't take anything seriously   read part 4   nigga what?       I don't want to say this because it's kind of become a meme,you are actually autistic.    you what         I'm totally expecting Bites the Dust to appear at some point in part 8, except it'll rewind time so fucking far that Gappy/Josefumi will do it.        colour ver     Jotaro just wanted to spend some quality time breaking out of jail with Jolyne but Pucci fucked it all up.    How could you word this nonstupidly?Freezing with ice and freezing time have absolutley nothing to do with each other,except for the english only word "Freezing".If you directly translated "Freezing Time" into almost any other language it would sound dumb    fuuuuck you are right but dio use the arrow to have his stand and he had already used the mask     What about MiH requiem?    Turn every living human to DIO-sama.     maximum humanity   a fucking EXTREME amount of souls  Dark Souls 1 and 2 were both SOOOOOO fucking easy to cheat with using cheatengine that at least 90% of the pvp community in those games probably deserved bans.      I said  Dio freezes stuff in part 1   freezes time in part 3  or something like that no requiem shit innit        Why do people assume that a Requiem stand is going to be the same abilities, but better?   stand about life ---&gt; returns everything back to zero   stand about swordfighting ---&gt; soul/body swapping        Well, GER still had the original abilities of GE, it just had an extra ability on top of that  I think it completely depends on what you want your stand to be the moment it gets pierced      killer queen technically it's a requiem when gets bite ze za duzo    its Friday   remember there will be no more jojo.     More importantly, its about what the User wants before he gets Requiem.  Polnareff didn't want to die so his requiem allowed him to switch bodies. Giorno wanted to beat/erase Diavolo and so Diavolo is dying (infinitely) .       Kars. People tend to forget that DIO is just a vampire and Pillar Men absorb anything that can't use Hamon as soon as it touches them. However this is only assuming The World has the same properties of its user too, and Kars can't really do much against a timestop other than just tank it.  tl;dr Ultimate kars would win      no it's not Kira got stabbed the arrow a second time, and gained a new ability on his existing stand Reqiuems are created when the stand itself is stabbed by the arrow     Dio could freeze his body to counter the hamon which would otherwise move into his body and affect him. Do you think that would work against whatever the Pillar Men secrete to absorb their food?  Either way, even DIO can't kill ultimate Kars, so I agree with you on that one.    <br/>    Assuming Part 3 DIO, he has Johnathan's body and a Stand at this point meaning he either can't or won't use his ice powers or eye lasers. If we're talking Part 1 Dio Brando he would lose easily to normal non-Ultimate Kars.     Pillarmen bodies are weird remember how that could faze into joseph's body and put the poison rings on him.    No, because the first time Polnareff got Silver Chariot Requiem was when he dropped it in his house and used his stand to pick it up.    araki wrote a villian so broken he drove himself to corner   GE wasn't that OP and araki couldn't think of a creative way to defeat KC   his editors were making him rush the ending   "What can I do know? Diavolo is way too strong for part 5 crew and half of them are already dead"   "Oh I know. I will have to use THAT"  Thus GER was born.         assuming The World has the same properties of its user  this always confused me, would hamon go through the stand because dio was definitely worried it would and refused to touch joseph even in stopped time. does it only work if it is a stand charged with hamon?     I find it unlikely that a normal vampire power would at all be effective against the pillermen who eat vampires all the time like it's nothing. At best DIO could escape out of Kars' range using timestops, but would still be unable to kill Kars, resulting in a stalemate/eternal conflict.    why didn't Jotaro wear his stand ever  who else here would want DIO to win? Fuck kars, faggot has no charisma or style. DIO has it all and bitches too  Will Araki ever return to the Ireneverse?   If DIO spams timestop at some point it would be days long. Put Kars in a space shuttle. "GOODBYE KAAASU"      Wouldn't a Pillar Man still be fucked if you turned their brain into mush?     Thread devolves into "Would X beat Kars" again  That new chapter can't come any faster    it's friday   there will be no new episode  Hold me.     Can the new chapter beat Kars?    We don't know with ultimate kars. wham took a shot to the head with the clackers and santana crushed his entire body to get into a vent. However the brain seemed pretty important since that was all acdc needed to live. Kars is a bit different with the part where he turns the scale feathers into piranha and his hand being a squirrel, seemingly every part of kars is alive and he could simply make another brain with his other body parts.  the script is out, it can't be much longer, but really the generals are clearly out of topics.       seemingly every part of kars is alive and he could simply make another brain with his other body parts   That's where the time stop comes into play  Completely destroy his brain in the time stop, and when time resumes he'll be too fucked up to make another brain        Damn, David Productions is really doing right by JoJo.    unlike part 3 dio, kars didn't need to feed to heal severe injuries and dio himself didn't die until the sun baked him in part 3. That being said The only way i can seem him getting by the world is by turning into a vampire killing virus. going at it with a normal body or range attacks won't work. he probably can't over power it but we never get any strength feats from the pillarmen.    Could Kars beat Giorno with GER?   Question: Why exactly is each Pillar Man's mode unique, if they were granted by the use of a Stone Mask? If they all have complete control and mastery of their bodies, why don't they just each imitate more Modes to increase their effectiveness in combat? Why couldn't Santana just make one up himself? Since vampires (Dio at least) also have complete control of their bodies, why didn't he do the same - and vice-versa why didn't any of the Pillar Men attempt to use Space Ripper Stingy Eyes and the like?   No.    Literally nothing in all of fiction can beat GER.    Because I guess 2 seasons/3 parts is already a pretty good number. And also because Japan hates Part 4, while they fucking love Part 5. Presumably this has led some to believe that they're more likely to skip to Part 5 or stop completely rather than do Part 4 first. They're probably also jumping the gun a bit since there wasn't a Part 4 teaser at the end of the last episode, but that was for obvious reasons.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195152     Not even Madara Uchiha? I never saved that whole BS copypasta, so I'm just leaving it at that     Someone translated that a week ago.    Could GER kill Kars?  Like, stop his regeneration and just punch him until he's nothing?      When it comes to bullshit "No, I win!" reality warping powers, GER takes the cake. He could just set Madara's chakra or fighting power or whatever to zero and then put him in an infinite death loop with Diavolo.   Yeah, it could just set his regeneration and body manipulation to zero.       Demonbane    Reset EVERYTHING to 0. Most bullshit power in anything.   Why the fuck didn't they get Giorno to just fight Pucci   So does that mean he could survive the universal reset? Meaning Jorge Joestar is canon?    It's true, Demonbane is even stupider than GER, somehow  Whoever wrote Demonbane just slapped every fucking stupid ability he could think of on it  GER probably couldn't even reset Demonbane's will to zero, since it exists outside of existence, or something        So Araki could have an easy copout reason to throw away the old Jojoverse  If Giorno had fought Pucci, no ass pulls would allow Pucci to win that one.      GER is outside of existance too. Timeskip is outside of existance too.    Disneyland   Pucci is best villain.  That is all.     That's not Dio.    Nooooo noooo Nooo  Diavolo is better        Dio   Babby's first JoJo villain   Complete bitch when he's not 100% sure he's going to win       If it weren't for Dio, Pucci would have stayed a boring priest.    Best death, maybe.   mfw he's still dying to this day       So the one thing he did good on was that he helped make best villain    He's the entire reason why he's a villain in the first place. Pucci could have been another Hot Pants without him.      No, no, no.  Best villain is Kira.        Dunno about Jorge being canon, but in All Star Battle at least GER is not affected by MiH. Does that mean he survived to the next few universes?    That doesn't change the fact that Pucci&gt;Dio. Dio's probably at the bottom in terms of villains, unless you're an animefag    Then why don't people appreciate Pucci more? He's less popular than even Kira.   Just read jojolion 44,  I can't believe the other half is kinda-Josuke but with worse hair     Thinks Dio is better than Pucci   Thinks Dio is better than Kira      Why do people even talk about Jorge if they don't know anything about it? Even in the book itself the crazy parts take place in a different world.   ASB wasn't even made by Araki. Gio did indeed survive though, because the only ones who weren't carried over the way they were were the ones Pucci killed during accelerated time.       I never said Dio was better than Kira. I will say that Dio is the most popular villain even though he's just an asshole in Part 1 and was barely in Part 3.   I just want a plot synopsis of Jorge Joestar but nobody here has even read the book.       Popular=//=Best    Dem satan  Guys remember. It all started when Diavolo sold arrows to enya and others. Diavolo made DIO Kira and Pucci what they were. Without him we wouldn't have anything. Even part 7 is thanks to him.       Diavolo had nothing to do with Part 7. The Ireneverse is not the SBRverse.    Agreed.    No, he's right in a way. If it weren't for Diavolo, Pucci wouldn't have gotten his Stand, thus Pucci would never have reset the universe    What does Pucci have to do with Part 7 though?   So which composer do you think they'll get for part 4? I'm thinking maybe the guy who did the Eva/Bleach soundtracks. I could see them using a theme like this during a battle with Josuke. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uiy<wbr>aqnj2FZ4</wbr>  [ ]    Pucci can't affect the SBR universe because he isn't part of it    Persona guy.     Pucci reseted entire multiverse thus resulting to sbr multiverse existing     Okay, whatever.    No, the Steel Ball Run universe is a parallel universe. Pucci reset the part 1-6 universe and it became a slightly modified version of itself, with Irene Joestar etc. There is no Irene Joestar in the Jojolion/SBR world.    probably late but  no runaway girl doujin  hehehe      Says you. And you don't know jack shit. Joesefumi managed to elude detection, I'm sure Araki plans to shove Irene in there too. Hell, maybe Irene is Josefumi's mom.   So Invincible Trio's Part 4 isn't actually a retranslation, just duwang proofread?  From their first post:   As I cannot speak Japanese, or any language other than English for that matter, the actual translations may be as off as ever, but hopefully this experience will at least be in coherent sentences.        Josefumi isn't a Joestar, he's a Kujo. Want me to post the interview where Araki says part 8's a parallel universe?     Please do, every time I see people denying that they're the same universe, they either don't have a source, or post an untranslated interview.      You are of course aware that Jolyne was a Kujo as well?    Maybe they never bothered figuring out how.    Honestly, you could skip to 6 if your really wanted to. Part 5 and 6 have no relation to each other, and part 6 leads into 7-8.    Go read the end of part 6 again. The world Irene is in is meant to be much closer to the 1-6 world, with the exact same people walking around.    Araki should really make altverse prequel about Joshua bar-Joseph and give him the joestar just for shits and giggles.     Freezing with ice and freezing time have absolutley nothing to do with each other,except for the english only word "Freezing"   menacing_esdeath.jpg   It just works.       Go and get some proof, because all those exact same people may have been exceptions, not the rule. Maybe they got a pass because they were directly intertwined with the reset, while people farther away chronologically/spatially got more heavily changed.  There are no plot holes in SBR/JoJolion that make it so that it is impossible this is the world Pucci created. You just lack imagination.  Basically, both of our opinions are worthless right now because we don't know for sure yet/we don't have facts, so I don't give a shit about what you say and you shouldn't give a shit about me either.         Star Platinum and The World being bros; DPing a chick  I need source of that pic     seconding this question    Of course, but she's a Kujo from the Joestar lineage. She'd be on the family tree  From the sound of things you've already seen it but can't read it. I don't know if there's a translated version flying around, but I can point out which part says it if that helps.       Let's put at it this way then: if there's nothing outright saying it's the same world and you have to make up your own rules to make it fit like you just did in this post, wouldn't it be more logical to assume it isn't?    Literally everything you said is wrong  Madhouse adapted HxH over 200 episodes non-stop. David can easily keep going, adapting one part per season. Part 4 is popular, not Part 3 and 5 popular but Kira is pretty high up there in Nipland. Fucking Part 1 got animated and that's the least popular part by far.  Lastly the Part 3 teaser was not anime-original. It was present in the manga as well. There was no Part 4 teaser in the manga       Is it just me or was the ending of this season kind of underwhelming?   There's a translation floating around. Here's what he says about part 4 and 8:   The town of Morio-cho appears in Parts 4 and 8, but they're in parallel worlds, so they aren't linked in time or space. The two Josukes would never meet each other normally. With this game, though, it becomes possible. At first I was bit taken aback. But then the bizarre nature to it all really got me interested. It's very entertaining. I would never allow something like this in the manga, but since this is a game, it's cool. Same thing with Jotaro fighting Dio Brando. The way the characters look is so different over the parts, though, that normally if you lined them all up they'd look very out of place with each other. But this game fixes all that, and I think that's one of its strengths.       It's called D4C.    if you look at the last post on their blog it mentions boco as the translator meaning at some time he stopped just fixing up duwang and got a real translator. I'm too lazy to check all those post but I assume he went back and fixed the ones simply fixed grammar on.    She might not be for all we know. I didn't hear mention of dear old dad in the epilogue. Could've been a whole other weird family line.  Josefumi was nowhere on the family tree, yet he seems to fully qualify as a "Joestar".   If a mangaka resets the universe of his setting in part 6, and then part 7 of the same story is part of a different but similar universe, wouldn't it be logical to assume it's the new universe? Especially considering there are no contradictions that say it can't be?         Steel Ball Run universe being Jojo parallel universe is an afterthought forced on Araki.   After reading part 5 ending I have to say that GER ability looked more like a time loop where GER chooses an action ( Diavolo's death) and right after that action happens the loop restarts and Diavolo is fated to do actions that will eventually lead to his death again. What if the "set to zero" is just a problem with the translation and it means "set as begining/end of the loop"? This is also seen when Diavolo is about to punch Giorno and with Epitaph he can see his future self repeating the same actions.     Did you read Jojolion? Josefumi IS NOT a Joestar. It would make no sense for him to be on the family tree.  Also Irene has the Joestar mark. She's a Joestar.      depending on how right or wrong this is, Diavolo never moved and everything was just epitaph seeing what should have happened. either way I think araki was going for a role reversal of what he did to bruno.    That makes significantly more sense than the other one. "Set to zero" is such a mind numbing thing to wrap your head around.  Could he reset a glass of water to zero, emptying it? Could he set my will to live to zero, eradicating me instantly? Could he set my bodies atomic magnetism to zero, also eradicating me instantly?  He can basically do whatever the fuck with such a broad ability.        It could even be a call back to the slowdown punch he pulled on bruno    Not that I disagree with you about the universes being different but Josefumi IS a Joestar. Look at his neck.    How do you think he would respond to some foreigner asking for a doujin he did 2 years ago?    Johnny's dad had a brother.  Solved.  I'm not saying that's a fact, or that I'm right, I'm just saying it's so easy to make either of us correct with a single sentence from Araki that talking about it right now is seriously retarded when we can't know for sure.       What are the chances josefumi is a bastard born of adultery like pt 4 josuke. Holly could be a harlot guys. She is the only living joestart nearby and old enough to be his parent. Maybe she has more in common with part 4 joseph than being crazy.    There will never be doujins of Irene and Jolyne fucking   There will never be   loli Jolyne doujins   why is liking jojo such suffering        &gt;There will never be   loli Jolyne doujins  Good  Lolyne is pure and only to be depicted having pure fun with Josuke.       Oh, reading it again, you're right. So he is. Doesn't really change the point though.      Joshua bar-Josef   from the house of David   David's father was Jesse/Ishai/Yishai of Judah   The Jojos just keep happening.        Confirmed.  Josefumi sorta shakes up everything we've come to know so far. The fact of the matter is, he and (possibly, who the fuck knows.) Irene are probably part of some offshoot branch of the Joestar family we don't know about yet.       parallel universes  i dont trust translations anon this could mean alternate or something else    They're going to continue animating Jojo, right?   I hope so, Anon.  I hope so.      But... That single sentence from Araki is pretty clear cut. They're separate worlds. There's not any way to rephrase it that would change the meaning of his words to support otherwise. You got me on the family tree thing though. Hadn't thought of that.      I'm pretty sure they mean OP 4     You mean Narancia isn't already a girl    It's actually パラレルワールド that he says, which is "parallel world" in English transliterated into Japanese.    Passionate lovemaking is one of the purest things imaginable.    People in these threads often forget about these guys.    i'd say it's a pretty safe bet     fuck the person who took this photograph let the man cry in private     I don't get it. What makes you say that?    agreed     Goerge Joestar   Anne      So GER's ability is basically Inazami from Naruto?  inb4 narutard      no that nigger is retarded you are retarded you are all retarded      all the teases, the clear love for jojo exuding from david make me feel safe in thinking that part 4 is coming it might be a year or so but i think it's coming     Inconsistent as fuck. I can't know whether Joseph is alive or not since they've dropped the fucking death dates from everyone but Kira.    which scans did you read? which group has the best scanlations?      implying you aren't  Well, it makes more sense than that "set to zero" bullshit     Nigger you are way too retarded. Explain me how did GER cancel time skips. Time loops? So you mean time is skipped every fucking 10 seconds? Also skipped time doesn't exist and you cannot loop it.  I said this already but Time Erasure &gt; Time Stop &gt; Time Rewind &gt; Time Acceleration       someone remade the Juves MAD with the anime   they used the pitched-down version  Fucking hell     How is erasing time better than accelerating it? Diavolo can skip time all he wants and the only thing he'll accomplish is Pucci accelerating even more.    Original timeline: ACDEFG (B got skipped, C is "Diavolo is about to punch Giorno and D is "Giorno gets punched") Then GER sets C to 0 and the timeline becomes:ACXYCXYCXYC where X and Y are "any actions that will eventually lead to C".      accelerating something that doesn't exist  Please don't be that guy. If anything Pucci is going to kill himself because MiH never accelerated in the first place and all the accumulated force will hit Pucci like a fucking truck.  Nigger, I said explain me how time skip before GER existed got nullified if it's power is a loop.       Yes, Diavolo can read the future and alter it to his liking and nobody remembers what happens during the time It Just Works activates. But as GER prevents harm from coming to Giorno it just leads to fucked up scenarios where Diavolo is stuck in a loop or whatever never able to touch Giorno.  GER doesn't create loops, that only occurs because of It Just Works tries to fuck with GER.      Because most diggy mo songs are copyright protected on YT now.     Nigger, I said explain me how time skip before GER existed got nullified if it's power is a loop.  What time skip?The only time skip that got nullified happened after GER was born      I didn't read part 5     Did you?I have part 5 open right now and I can't find the timeskip you are talking about     MiH never accelerated in the first place   Why wouldn't it? The things Diavolo skips still happen, even if nobody remembers it.      Why would they do that? They anime is full of QUALITY shots; why ruin the MAD with it     Don't skip parts, but I sympathize with you, I didn't like Part 5 all that much, it's so fucking boring.   People don't skip parts of Jojo, KC activates and they did in fact read the parts but just don't remember.   No they don't actually. What can happen if time space doesn't exist? They just go to their destination after skip ends. In the skipped time you cannot interact with time-space because it doesn't exist. Your power should be out of space time to do anything in the skipped time in the first place.     didn't get my epic green arrow maymay requiem  I was quoting that guy who claimed GER didn't nullify erased time before GER existed which made him look like he didn't read part 5.         Huh. Kyo is missing from the tree.     I was quoting that guy who claimed GER didn't nullify erased time before GER existed  Where does this happen?     part 5 is mandatory skipping anon       I didn't skip faggots. Never skip parts. Every part is good in some way.  Just reread the fight again. I don't think you remember it very well. Neither I do but I am pretty sure it nullified time erasure before it existed. That's where it's powers are originated mostly.         I still can't find it anon, can you be a little more specific of when does it happen?    I'd put my money on him being Joseph's son as a mirror to the previous shit hair guy.    http://i.imgur.com/XsHErdk.jpg I am not inclined to read the whole fight again but see those bullets? yeah      linking an image     You realized a lot doujin artists don't want their work by foreigners and for free, right? I remember one artist had a total meltdown when it happened.    Anon please. I am doing this even though I told him I have no interest in showing the pages and he should just reread it.    There's a fapfic     There will never be   loli Jolyne doujins  There's that one where she's basically a Yotsuba paletteswap running around Morioh.     Holy shit you suck with tempo and intonation.    Full version or OP 1.5 min ver?      tfw my pronunciation would be top notch but my voice sucks  You english speaking fuckers speak japanese in a disgusting way.      I came here to talk about JoJo, not feel fucking terrible. Anon, why?    I'm a Spanish speaker, so I can speak Japanese pretty well. Suck on that.    Nigger i speak turkish. We pronounce everything the way it is written and japanese sounds are very familiar to us. Turkish and japanese are even in the same language family.   Been away for a week.  Is the latest chapter translated yet?     Well it's translated, just no scans yet s we gotta wait a little longer.

In related news, Jien Mei is confirmed to be voiced by KanaHana ruining my dreams of having HnM be voiced by her.  Also for some reason, they don't have a picture of her, just a silhouette with a coming soon.  This probably doesn't mean the crew is already having budget problems where they can't even post a damn drawing.        Right. Already did that. Now to where we left off.                          33 volumes   1 week  I got this shit.        I'd reccomend doing it in three days 1 to 12/13 12 to 24 24 to 33          Hm. I'll try. But why three parts?     To avoid burning yourself out as each one could serve as a climax for their respective third. Also, the anime is three cours.  I honestly just read it all in one go but that's just me.       Same here.         Not Hinowa.   Ushio will never understand how tsundere work.        It's poster material.          That fucking scene. You know that He didn't forget about him, yet it's still poweful.                        Ushio sure gets hit a lot by the women of this manga.                                                Here we go.      Not my Weaponfu!                                                                                       oh damnit.                        You will never have a friend as good as Asako         well, shit.         Asako hiding her arms.   I love these details.       is this the deep web?      I'm pretty sure this part of the net is easily indexed.       neat.                BASED          I jsut love how hast Ushio looks here. And goddamn he's going fast. She's already jumped.      geting burned just by getting too close to it  SEE? Why can't nowaday series keep with shit like this. Instead we get flying over magma and 'oh Im fine I didnt touch it, so there is nothing to hurt me' shit.      AWWW SHIT            based.                    99 problems                   Is Rebellion better than original Madoka?   TV: 7 Rebellion: 6      "Rebelion" and "original Madoka" are from the same whole. Rebellion isn't better than original Madoka, It's necessary.    No, but it was better than I was ecxpecting.   Yes    I would say yes.   homu:10/10  It's the best answer to the series's depressing ending.   Yes    nah it's worse. Too much meta powerlevel wank   so there will be any new series, ova, movies? or madoka is kill?  tfw the game will never get localized       Is Rebellion better than original Madoka?   Better or not, Rebellion is indisputable magnum opus of Gen and a piece of art.      HOMURA GIVE ME MORE HOMURA!   perfection   If season 2 isn't SoL written by Ume I'd rather there not be anything at all.   I really hope you've got both of them to support Shaft and PMMM crew.    No. In the first place, Urobuchi has outright stated in interviews that he didn't want to do Rebellion and that he thought Madoka was totally complete with its anime series (and anyone who says Madoka had a depressing ending is a fool). If you've read other works of his, he actually talks about themes central to Madoka every so often (F/Z Vol. 1's postface, for example) years before it was being planned and, in many ways, it's noticeable how he was finally able to start writing relatively happy endings after concluding Madoka. Shinbo coerced him into writing Rebellion by saying if he wasn't on board, they'd get someone else anyway, so he might as well. He generally seems so-so about the affair, thinking it turned out well, but it is what it is and he doesn't seem incredibly proud of it.   What it is amounts to what could have been a mindless cash-in and in some ways was treated as such, but is in fact a product with a lot of thought and effort put into it. This in no way means it's perfect, as there are various factors which diverge from the original anime, while pandering and fanservice (not necessarily of the titillating sort) abound.  Rebellion's first 45 minutes drag on too long, having too many pointless or prolonged scenes to drill in a point which could have been grasped in 20 (and almost certainly would have had Rebellion had been released as a series as opposed to a movie). Homura's feelings about her situation (she was content at the end of the anime) are basically retconned to accommodate the new narrative direction. The fight between Homura and Mami is flimsily justified and rather OOC for both of them (this is commented on quite a lot), basically just a somewhat poor excuse to have a cool fight between the two.  (cont)            Bebe is an absolutely pointless character in every way that didn't really need to exist, her every contribution being something Sayaka could have fulfilled on her own; she really only exists to pander, since Charlotte is so well-liked amongst fans. Speaking of Sayaka, her character is definitely altered to allow for shoujo ai subtext between her and Kyouko, something the original anime very much rejected in their interactions. All over the place, the personalities of characters are subtly altered to reflect the fanbase's memetic portrayal of them rather than how they actually were in the original series.  On the other hand, Rebellion's animation is absolutely superb, it has excellent symbolism, its themes are very concrete and in-line with what is typical of Urobuchi, and the plot honestly isn't bad at all in spite of aforementioned pandering. Homura skyrocketed to be my favorite puella by the end when I previously felt lukewarm about her. So, while Rebellion definitely has problems and the original anime certainly didn't need it at all, in a vacuum it is undeniably very good. Unfortunately for it, being a sequel, it really can't exist without the original work to establish it and its failures as a continuation of the plot have to be considered. That in mind, I can't in good conscience call it as good as the original series, which Urobuchi desperately wished to create and thus poured his heart and soul into. But is it a proper successor to the original anime's legacy? I would actually say yes. Although it is imperfect and unneeded, few if any stories are flawless and just because something isn't necessary doesn't mean it can't contribute to the whole.  Also, Homura did nothing wrong.          Also, Homura did nothing wrong.  Except being a bitch like Sayaka.      Hilariously, Sayaka was my favorite puella before Homura beat her out in Rebellion.   Her misery made by dick rock hard.       Reminder that ribbons &gt; time   The real tragedy is no sequel to Grief Syndrome    They're both great.      Whether Urobuchi wanted to do it or not, and what he thought of it don't actually have any bearing on the quality of the movie    Hey, Apple.    Hi. I gotta stop communicating with the dead.    But you're dead yourself.    No, I revived.    spoopy    That must have taken a lot of grief seeds.    Yes.    So how do you plan on making it up to Kyouko?   I think it's better because unraveling the finer points of the plot and motivations is something you have to do yourself, rather than having it told to you. It's more rewarding when you have to think and engage yourself to assemble all the pieces presented.    Mm, that wasn't the main thing I was trying to illustrate by mentioning that. Mostly, I wanted to note that Rebellion fundamentally wasn't necessary and Urobuchi felt Madoka was definitively finished. While I agree Urobuchi's stance on the project doesn't have any direct bearing on its quality, what it does do is reflect on how certain elements of the movie were handled that DO result in a lesser product. Rebellion was created not because Urobuchi had new ideas for the direction of the series, but because Shinbo and SHAFT saw an opportunity and decided to take it with or without the original writer. The mentality of Urobuchi and SHAFT here gives context to why the movie approaches things a certain way even though they damage its quality overall.     It completed Homura's arc fantastically. There is the issue that it could be a retcon of how Homura felt at the end of the series, but we don't know exactly what happened between the series ending and Rebellion. Could be that Homura was in denial, putting on a front (unlikely), or just didn't realize the severity of her emotional problems just yet. Even if it was a retcon, it was far more faithful to Homura's character than her quick acceptance of the circumstances at the end of the anime.  Also I think that the stuff that people like this homie   complain about like Charlotte and Sayaka/Kyouko actually weren't too unfaithful to the series. Charlotte was kind of necessary as a plot device and to make Homura/the viewer a little confused/uncomfortable. And with hindsight (which she has a lot of time for, being dead and all), it makes sense that Sayaka would recognize she could have been happy if she'd gotten closer with Kyouko and accepted her help. Rebellion was her short opportunity to live that out.      What better to make Kyouko happy than to satisfy her  hunger  needs? I'll take her  to an all you can eat buffet  around town.    I dislike how the film hesitated near the ending by having Madoka almost come back so that they can have an easy sequel hook if they ever need one. Is there even a good reason for it to happen?    Shinbo coerced him into writing Rebellion by saying if he wasn't on board, they'd get someone else anyway, so he might as well   Source on this?     Rebellion's animation is absolutely superb   The film might be pretty, but it is not due to the animation. By itself it is functional and far from bad, but at the same time nothing special.     and Urobuchi felt Madoka was definitively finished   If I'm not mistaken the closest he ever said to something of the sort was when he commented on the lack of a sequel hook in the episode 12 ending and how he had to work a bit harder to circumvent this while working on Rebellion.   Or is this related to the 'Rebellion is a sequel to the recap movies' thing? Was it even Urobuchi who said this, or was it Shimbo?                       That's wise.     I dislike how the film hesitated near the ending by having Madoka almost come back so that they can have an easy sequel hook if they ever need one. Is there even a good reason for it to happen?   It actually happens in the opposite way. Remember when Homura tells Sayaka that the more time she spends in her new world, the more natural it will feel for her? If it goes the same for Madoka - and it should - then it makes sense that she would be at her hardest to keep in place very early on in the Homuverse timescale - soon after its inception. As time passes and Homura successfully maintains Madoka contained, the better Madoka will be able to blend in with her surroundings. Given how this was the reason for her to almost regain her Madokami consciousness, it would thus lead to an easier time for Homura.      Indeed. Seeing her happy makes me happy.    That's a rather good point that I will keep in mind for when I rewatch it. Guess there goes my major complaint about the movie.    Doesn't take much for Kyouko to be happy. That's lucky in a way.     While I do like some of the spinoffs, in general it's lower quality than the original and doesn't really offer much but 'play as ur fav madoka' or 'let's follow some other girl in the same universe who is less interesting but don't you want more stuff in Madoka style?'   And no matter what, always seeing her happy is best. Now if only I can stop her late night screams.     if only I can stop her late night screams.  Maybe be a bit gentler.     It takes a lot actually, and the cost is for the ideals she had as a child to prevail. Either through Sayaka not dying a horrible death, or her wish to not destroy her family.  Turns out the first was made possible through two different girls rewriting the universe, admittedly with other/greater goals in mind for their actions.    There is the issue that it could be a retcon of how Homura felt at the end of the series   Does it really? I have never understood how people say this when she was shown to abandon every acquaintance she ever had to go fight wraiths for no reason in some desertic place stated to be far away from Japan. Well, for no reason other than the new promise she made in literally the last scene before the epilogue; said promise hanging on the duty she felt she still had to Madoka, now that Madoka was fighting for her and for everyone.          A lot of it was a shameless pandering cashcow which is to be expected of Shinbo. Like, I can't even stress how fucking pandering this movie was.  lets give Mami GIGANTIC tits and focus on them a lot because people meme'd about them so much!   lets give Mami Charlotte as partner because people meme'd about the pairing!   lets add copious amounts of SayaKyou because shiteating retards love this shit tier pairing so much! lul dey canon now cause they held hands xD   et cetera  Still the conclusion to Homura's arc was pretty dope. She basically saved the universe, made everyone happy, and people are pissed off about it anyway because irrational MUH FREEDUMBS shit. The "controversy" was basically just baited by the spoopy imagery and Homura calling herself a devil, but objectively nothing bad happened.  I really liked the open ending that left things ambiguous, "is this world really fine like this?" is probably the closest thing to a good ending you could get. Of course, that won't stop $hinbo from making some sort of sequel. I have little doubt that it will happen eventually. He'll make his waifu Slutyaka the protagonist for sure and since Gen is gone it's probably going to be a huge clusterfuck and make people mad, like Rebuild of Evangelion. That's what you get for being faggots.                but objectively nothing bad happened  She had to actively give up eternal life alongside Madoka to achieve all this.  Also, she had to actively make some people forget things for them to be able to live in her new world. With Madoka it just happened without a hitch... With Homura being the exception, but a convenient one at that since she wanted to remember her past struggle for Madoka anyway.       Huh? No, I mean her dreams.    Writer Gen Urobuchi stated in the planning stages of Rebellion his idea was to end the film with Homura being taken away with Madoka to the Heavens. “I thought the story would end this time for real!” he laughs. However, the producer and director insisted the story should continue, leaving Urobuchi with little choice. “I really feel that Madoka doesn’t just belong to me anymore” Urobuchi says. It was the director who suggested the upcoming twist.  Found on a random website. How true is this shit?     He'll make his waifu Slutyaka the protagonist for sure  I recall some interview available at the time this film still was a hot topic that the Butcher actually talked about this in detail and pointed to the possibility of this being in the possible sequel.  Did all this get discarded? I mean, following it he never touched the topic again, though I'm not too sure about what order were these thoughts from him actually made/published. Did he just give up because there just was no room for something of the sort?       Tell me about it.   Even if it was, it's not criticism of the film. How or why they got the ideas isn't important, only how good the ideas themselves are.       Welcome back.     random website  If you will take your time anyway, why not search the PMMM wiki for the presumably accurate, folded over a thousand times translations they might have?     Fake and gay. Just like your value as an individual.      I still can't believe that happened.      Couldn't find links to the wiki by throwing parts of the quote at google. I'm just assuming it's accurate enough--that there was a conflict between the director and writer regarding Homura's choice near the end.    Still cannot believe these threads are extremely vaguely madoka related chatrooms    Just google PMMM wiki.    I still can't believe it's not butter.         Huh?  Come on, you know exactly what I was referring to.     Yes I do. I myself was referring to her dreams.    To a certain extent, yes, there was conflict. There has also been an interminable amount of shitposting about this - mostly casting the butcher as someone with artistic integrity, beaten down by THE MAN (shinbo) - to deride the film as a cash-in with no value. Thus, bringing it up only casts the dark shadow of past faggotry upon such a topic.   Why would that change?       Conflict? What I'm sure about was that Shimbo 'suggested' an alternative path - for Homura's and Madoka's interests to conflict in some way. According to Butcher all he did was to follow this suggestion; everything that followed afterwards was made by himself.  This happened pretty early on the development cycle, which puts it around sometime in middle to late 2011.          I know what the wiki is. Just couldn't find that quote so I wasn't certain if it was legit.  Shit, I wasn't aware of that. I watched the series a long time ago, but always hid Rebellion threads to avoid spoilers and only watched it recently to see what the hype was about.     This is literally how it went down:   Gen: Okay lets end it with Homura being taken to Yuri Valhalla   $hinbo: No, no, it must be an open end, I want to write more sequels in the future   Gen: Fuck... What the fuck do I write, then?   $hinbo: Why not make Madoka and Homura enemies?   Gen: Well if that's allowed then I got an idea   There's a reason the ending is open. It's because $hinbo LITERALLY ORDERED IT. See you in season two.           Good night PHG and the rest. Sweet dreams.   Oh and should I call you Anonymous now?   What?       Rebellion is the high-budget low-intelligence version of original Madoka and if you like it you value fanservice over plot   Forgot to say that the exchange happened in the first place because Butcher was having issues writing down a story that ended with Homura being carried to Valhalla, didn't you?      Why on earth would this even be important? If it were a bad ending, you'd be able to just pick it apart rather than having to resort to painting the creators as bad artists.   Nah. We're still friends, silly.          Why on earth would this even be important?   Because there will be a sequel and it will be terrible because Gen is gone and Shinbo is a terrible writer and moneygrubbing jew.         tfw Apple doesn't appreciate your jabs         It would be interesting to me for the same reason "director's cut" versions sell. People are curious about the director's vision unconstrained by editors. Likewise, they're curious about the writer's vision unconstrained by directors. I'm       fanservice   Wtf, the only thing that was fanservice was Homura's devil outfit.       happy demon hunting keiki funtimes are not fanservice      demon hunting is fanservice     Heh.    Definitely is when nobody is dead, dying or depressed and there's a cute little song and Charlotte is their cute little mascot as if they're a legitimate magical team     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127183725   fanart is insulting   Canonfag.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184075  Doesn't matter because it looks cute on the surface and the surface is the most important later when appealing to fans    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127183599  Neither of those things follow from your comments about their creative process. To find out whether or not the fiction is inconsistent or sloppy, you look at the fiction. Anything else is silly sophistry from goofballs who are clamoring to find anything bad to say about the film because they dislike it for no good reason.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184219  Sounds like you have a stick up your ass to be unable to accept a lighthearted scene even if it was part of Homura's scenario. I know Madoka threads are pretty, extremely, irrevocably shitty but relax   I want to rape neo Homuhater and mindbreak him.    not ignoring them    i want to marry homu   It's just a dedicated troll that find his joy in hate speech on all forms against Homura. He is not even the original, he just picked up from where the previous one had left (a couple weeks gap, different posting styles).  A sad individual.      There's nothing wrong in him not being the original.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184440  It wouldn't matter even if it's homo.    It's best to just ignore, don't post HomuMado to spite/bait them and they'll just fuck off somewhere else or get banned.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184722  2dank4me Also please stop samefagging.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184722  Fuck you, and your waifu Madoka. You can both go to hell together for all I care.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184887  Oh, she is. Just wait 'til one of her classmates takes a liking to her. Cuckmura will be forced to watch it unfold while being unable to do a single thing since her motivation is Madoka's happiness.   Series 9.3/10 Rebellen 9/10   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127185768  Surprised to know you didn't hate Homu in series.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127185959  So you want her raped and dead because her Charakter is already assassinated?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186280  Nah her body looks seedy.   That was spooky. Anyway, series was slightly better while both are over 9.    over 9  I don't know about where you come from, but here we call that "10".        Right fucking above you, moron   see       TV: decent overall, boring during middle, shit ending  Rebellion: decent overall, boring during beginning (im still mad about that fucking transformation scene), and decent ending, because I really was not expecting it at all.  I like rebellion better, and the movie trilogy as a whole at that.        late as fuck fag here, i literally just finished Rebellion. I never watched it after Madoka because /a/ said it was shit. I don't get the ending honestly.    Wait, you were fine with the stereotypical magical girl stuff at the start, but you were bored by the suffering and whatnot in the middle?   Mado mado     Mado?    Homu.    No homu. Mado!    But Homu.    What stereotypical magical girl stuff are you even talking about? Do you not watch magical girl, like most other people who like meguca? The closest it's ever gotten was the beginning of Rebellion and that has been noted to be Homura's fufu tralala gayboy fantasy of what it should be like to be a meguca   No.  Everyone's gone.  Post Sayaka-chan.      YES MADO   NO       You were gone. I invaded. Sayaka-chan!    More Mado and Homu, less Sayak.    What's the appeal of Madoka anyway?  She's the blandest of all of them.      Pussy game strong.    She is the most pure, kindest, and cutest meguca. She is best waifu, my waifu. She is so perfect in everyway, my ideal woman come to fruition. Pink is also best color.    She would even be kind to a man like you. A man in his 20's, nothing interesting, even browsing 4chan's NSFW boards.   Holy shit these threads are still shit after an entire year of being away.  Kyouko is still my waifu and best girl tho.    Why is Umedoka so cute? http://www.umeten.jp/          People will keep perpetuating the misinformation about a "conflict" because they didn't like Rebellion and they believe that lies like those will give their viewpoint more weight    Kyoko a poop.  Sayaka abest.      sayacuck a shit     Are you the guy that used to make the Kyouko Friday threads?     There's no cuck, she has me!    my homu is in the mail    never mind that fate is far worse than being a cuck.      A man who calls other a poop is a poop.    So you're also a poop?    sowwy kevin kun. you can have sayaka and ill just keep my homu      Sayaka so a baka she's touching outside of the screen.    I didn't call you a poop. You poop.    <br/>   continuing to post homuhomu      Fish    Am I the only one left?  <br/>     Why does mami like tying up homu? Does homu like it?    It's the only way she can kick the ass of homu's time stopping shenanigans.    but i think homu likes it     dat proportion      looks like they fixed it in the movie     which magica is the   widest?      quick mods are asleep post wide!       I'm still here for you, kevin-kun lovelove!     hidamaris     crossover when?    kevin is kill tho    i killed kevin because my waifu is better than his    poor kevin.   Beware, having a bad waifu like Sayaka can kill you.      wise words indeed.      you will never hug a meguca  suffering     Mado   Hito    Is hitummy the best girl?    when it comes to punching    In my opinion it is.   I wouldn't say it's better or worse. I think it fits perfectly within the series and makes sense.  For the people that hated rebellion what were you expecting out of the movie?    I want to stick my dick in crazy.  Is everyone dead? I'll just post Kyouko.  Madoka never loved Homura ever. Don't fucking dare say otherwise, it insults Madoka.                    Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.         Welcome back.  I'm sick so I stayed home. Gonna sign in soon.       Get well soon      Remove qb    hating QB    Whatever Madoka is looking at must look good for her to drool like that.  Hopefully I stay this way for tonight.  Ima get ARR. If you have it, maybe you me and Kevin-kun can play.      <br/>  <br/>   QB did nothing wrong. It was all Homura's fault for bullying him and making him dance for grief cubes.    Pls. I bet you wish you can dance like that.       <br/>                   Oh, that's another great idea. <br/>    Bullying coobie is as bad as bullying megucas   QB bullied the megucas. He got what he deserved thanks to based Homuhomu.    Spooky   Kyubey was right to torture Homura. She deserved it.  Her whole life was hurting others for fun.     And now Kyubey is on the other end of the shoes.         Which ending was most disappointing?  I dropped two of these shows at the first episode and didn't even start the third, so I wouldn't know.  Never picked up any of these because the MC alone looked generic and annoying as fuck.   A/Z  It's probably GC but I can't tell since I'm still dropping it every week     fuck that's hard....going with aldnoah because of the jimmy rustling the first season left ppl with   Finish that thing already    GC, everything about the ending hit me in the feels.  The only thing that bothered me about A/Z was no Inko end      Guilty Crown, he didn't achieve his goals and was crippled for it. Also the final fight was quite awfull looking. It hast the best ost and visuals though.       The only thing that bothered me about A/Z was no Inko end  This.    A/Z, and not only the end, but the entire second season was a pile of shit.   Obviously A/Z, since other two were so bad i didnt had any hopes or expectations from them.    A/Z    This post implies A/Z's second season wasn't irredeemable gutter trash from the start.    Disappointing? Aldnoah.  Soul-crushing? GC.  I'm glad it's over.jpg? VVV.        AZ was such a load of nothing with absolutely no one dying I can't see how the others could be worse.     Go to bed Inko.     GC's ending wasn't disappointing, it was downright jaw-dropping in its sheer force of "fuck you" towards Shu. The entire series was one enormous "fuck you" to Shu, but the ending was like the "go to hell Shu" cherry on the "fuck you Ouma" sundae. I want to know who hated him that much on Guilty Crown's creative team, because holy shit.    proably AZ, even if the other 2 are way worse as a whole, expecially GC    Yeah but even with a shitty second season a good end could have turn it around see Code Geass.     implying A.Z is not worse than both     All end worst end. If you ever find yourself watching this just get up and walk away/    It's okay anon, Shu can take it. Those people might hate him, but at least i still love him as he is.    R2 was fun at least. AZ was just a ball of whirling bad angst and drama for no reason with Count Faggot. What a waste of time.    That's what he said    Obligatory    A/Z because literally nothing happened.  It starts off with the war and builds up for the entire first and second seasons, then Hime wakes up and she's like lolnope and everyone agrees with her.  The war ends and nothing significant happens other than Slaine being thrown in prison because fuck Slaine.  At least in VVV's and GC's ending, shit actually happened.          You and I both, anon. Shoe is a good boy and I appreciate him.     Inori is my DROPPED   actually decent episode DROPPED   Every fucking time         What the fuck did you expect to happen? The whole point of the show was stopping the war because martians were being dumbasses. And Slaine being the biggest asshat. The whole 2nd season shouldn't even exist to be honest. It just stretched out the obvious conclusion.    CG. Seriously fuck that ending.  Then AZ. Then VVV.      *Should be GC. Stupid initials.    I was riding on this tiny hope that Slaine would actually win.   I wish Cabaneli won't end up nearly as bad.   I watched all three and I'm going with A/Z, because for the first half of the episodes, I actually thought it would be good.   Only AZ managed to save some expectations until the end. You knew exactly what you'll get in the other two.     I only watched it because Urobuchi's name was on it   FTFY. The show was shit from the start you just got caught in the hype.       No. I'm not one of these guys, but I watched the first episode of A/Z while having a very ambivalent opinion on Urobuchi (either he makes shit or gold it seems) and really enjoyed the series till the last episode of season 1. The announcement of a second season was the death warrant of the whole license.     I liked it     expecting the villain to win   expecting the villain to win and doom glorious earth to racist nazi rulers  I can't even process how you could arrive to such a retarded thought from what the show gives you      Neither post made a single mention of Urobuchi    VVV's ending and whole "losing memory" stuff that happened to Haruto looked like forced drama to me. Second season was all about forced drama actually, I hated it.     waifu loves you   but you don't get to stay with her  Why?      They tried so hard to convince everyone that Inaho was cool and hip "look everyone! He might have te personality of stale bread - but hey he's got a robot eye!"    He must live and atone.    But they did nothing wrong    yea it started so promising in the first cour, 2nd one was a huge disappointment ;_;  Im with VVV for most disappointing, AZ was never good so why would the ending matter.      Definitely not A/Z because by the time it ended I expected absolutely nothing out of it.  I guess Valvrave because I never stopped hoping it would go back to being a stupid fun ride even after season two was consistently disappointing.      First two boys were too good for this world  Too good  It's sad        VVV S2 was straight up different anime than S1 to me. They should've just skipped hundred or two hundred years to show how world is fucked midseason or in first episode. Since eating memories/emotions was revealed I was sure Haruto will end up like that, so it wasn't dissapointing. I didn't expect aliens and it left me laughing. GC, author wanted to shit on shoe, didn't expect it. Would have been better for him to die. Dissapointed? No, more surprised. Don't know third one.         nd really enjoyed the series till the last episode of season 1.  So shit taste     It's far more enjoyable than the shitpile that is S2.   A/Z.  (Dis-)Honorable mentions for both GC and VVV but GC was disappointing long before it got to its ending and VVV was at least more of a ride.  A/Z's ending was pretty much suggested by several charcters as not being feasible even if Asseylum came back, then required a new character to be pulled Aoki-tachi's ass 3 episodes before the end to actually work — and still dint really solve the problems that caused the war in the first place.  Bonus retard points for suggesting that Crutheo's whipping boy who only became a significant political force 2 years after the war started was had legitimate influence to try and assassinate Asseylum and people believing it.        AZ because everything from it was shit, expect some OST tracks. Atleast two shits above are fun ride    A/Z's ending was pretty much suggested by several charcters as not being feasible even if Asseylum came back  Except the whole season was building up to her waking up and blowing Slaine's plan to shambles.   and still dint really solve the problems that caused the war in the first place.  Except it did since aldnoah is becoming universal and war is over, unlike the alternative of earth getting taken over and counts not wanting to give up their shit even more.  For your last point, the retarded whipping boy shouldn't have killed the dude who did do it, then grab his shit and run for the goal whilst tripping over himself. AZ was always shit and leading up to this ending. You just got caught up in delusions from reading too many fanfics.              Despite being really, really shitty itself, A/Z was still the best of the three going into the end, which made it's awful ending seem worse.  Surprisingly, Vulvarape's ending was probably the best of the three, since it at least stayed consistent instead of being any more retarded than the rest of the season.     no one curr   Worst to Best:  GC - AZ - VVV    Vulvarape by a landslide.  most incompetent person is now the president of everything   MC sacrificed himself so retards could keep on shitting up everything   fucking ayy lmao out of nowhere    What the fuck. A/Z may have big problems with the ending, but they aren't as evident as in VVV.       HUMANS DID NOTHING WRONG   genocide   not wrong     Seishin pls go    Humans have arguably done three wrongs.  First one is killing the granny vampire, a person who has done no harm and was no threat to anyone. Second one is that they have killed every human who was wounded while fighting vampires out of fear that they might be infected. Third one is that they killed the monk's family despite them being innocent.  But in the humans defense, these actions were not done out of malice, but out of lack of information and because of the severity of the situation they were involved with.  Every other vampire they have killed has murdered at least one human, and have all been involved in the plot to wipe out the humans. They were the enemies of humanity, and so were their few human sycophants.           Anyone else feel that the ending was lackluster?  It seemed to be heading towards some kind of conclusion and then the village starts to burn and they all just escape.  Also, I seem to have forgotten, but what happened to the rich Kirishiki guy?       TLDR: It can't be helped.   Why didn't they just cover themselves in charms and other religious crap? They established earlier that it works   thanks doc    Where is my MACHINE OF LABOR?   It's funny because Tatsumi is actually a werewolf    posting the version without THE FAME MONSTER    Top 3 characters: 1. Doctor 2. Strongbeard 3. Sunako     Why aren't more anime set in extremely rural villages?  The potential of complete isolation really added to the atmosphere of the anime.     As far as I remember only the kids figured it out and they never shared the information with the other villagers   Chop.   I think the vampire massacre was perfectly justified from human point of view because the vampires can't sustain themselves except by killing humans, which breed more vampires and make the situation worse. The grandma might turn her daughter into a vampire too you know.   There's two questions I have left unanswered:  1. What exactly was the Shiki's end goal? I know they tried to turn the village into a village of shiki, but what would that accomplish. Assuming there's 500 shiki there, how would they all feed themselves. Would they make daily trips to the city to kidnap 500 people? Surely the city officials would pick up on this sooner or later.  2. Why did Seishin turn to the shiki's side. I know he said he was feeling "trapped" his entire life living the monk life, but is that really enough reason to abandon your fellow men and condemn them to death?        genocide   wrong        They don't need to feed daily. And they don't need to kidnap people, nor do they need to murder people to feed off them. During the takeover stage, they intentionally drained people as quickly as possible to kill as many people as quickly as possible. It's only during their very first feeding that they're practically guaranteed to kill the person they're feeding off from, because their instincts take over and they're unbelievably hungry since they've just been raised from the dead  The Shiki can stay self-sufficient in their backwater little village by taking weekly/monthly trips to the city where they would feed off people, hypnotize them to hide their tracks, and then rotate between different people. They would not actually need to kill anyone, ever. 500 Shiki could easily live off a human city of, say, 50,000 people, indefinitely, without ever having to kill any one of those humans.         Try Higurashi and that one where everyone is gay and the rat was right.     1  She's batshit from being lonely for so many years. Loli vampires are not rational.   2  Because he's a selfish and bored edgemaster. He's like those crazy lefties who want to invite hordes of bloodthirtsy muslims into their home country He lives for the drama.         everyone is gay and the rat was right  Huh?      machines of labour   My fucking sides      Humans looked to cause pain   Shiki didn't     1. They just want to survive whatever the means. They can't help it. Which is why they have to be eradicated like the pests they truly are.  2. Seishin is an edgy boy who wants to defy any restrictions placed upon him, be it religious (his books are mostly about betrayal or people who are abandoned by god) or society.     Humanity stronk  REMOVE BLOODSUCKER      At first I though Seishin was the sensible guy and that the doctor was the edgelord but it turned out to be the other way around.     assuming he means shinsekai yori     humans actually considered cooperation   shiki didn't     Why didn't they just donate blood for them   predator hunts a group of prey to near extinction   prey wises up and decides they've had enough   prey fight back with the same level of aggression the predators were hunting them with   HEY HUMANFAG HOW COULD YOU KILL ALL THOSE VAMPIRES I MEAN THEY JUST WANTED SOME FOOD WHO CARES IF THEY WERE GENOCIDING YOUR PEOPLE I MEAN THIS A WORLD WHERE VAMPIRES EXIST EVERYONE IS SUPPOSED TO BE HUNTED BY VAMPIRES YOU DUMB HUMANFAG        vampirism   genes      The humans were all wearing shrine outfits remember?   Why this show was so good?    moral conflict   unusual choice of setting   SENMETSU       Because there's a lack of good dark anime.    Also    At the end of the day it's simply not acceptable for humans to give up their slot as an apex predator.   You try to steal it from us and we'll fuck you up into extinction.    Any considerable differences between the novel, anime and manga?   Haven't read it, but I heard that in the novel, the monk and the doctor are both main characters and have equal amount of screentime, and that most of the stuff with the teen werewolf was anime original and that he wasn't an important character in the novel.

This series is self-titled “Fleshbomb Masterpiece.” The first chapter is full of flexing muscles, sweating, flowers, and more flexing.
