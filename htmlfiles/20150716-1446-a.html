[ Would you a Kamiya Hiroshi?  I wonder who's going to voice all these seiyuus cameoing as themselves in the<br> dub <br>?</br></br>  I would a Manager-san, he knows how to properly invest money  I would a Ringo-chan  <br>There won't be a dub, this show has a shoestring budget and is probably bombing</br>  <br>But Funimation picked it up and they will dub literally anything.</br>  rip kuma ichigo  <br>JYB as Kamiya Hiroshi</br>  So how many tens of people are still watching this?  <br>Tens of tens</br>   Anime tanks <br> Can't get voice work because old &amp; busted <br> Pushed off the radio show <br> Has to suck dick behind the dumpster to make noodle money <br><br>Buy the BDs so Masumin can survive, you heartless bastards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dollar belt buckle <br>What a gangsta</br></br>  <br>No but OnoD certainly would.</br>  <br> noodle money <br>God, I wish this show were more popular for the sake of some "promotion" doujins.</br></br>  Who will cameo next and which anisong will they have in the ED?  <br>who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>Are they gay?</br>  <br>His name is Ararararararagi-san.</br>  <br>No, it's Kamimiyan</br>  <br>I'm still watching. This is the first thread for the show that I've seen. The ED where they just banter about what happened in the episode and then randomly burst out into CAT/Bure was great. Loved seeing Berry and Yuki at their part time jobs as well.</br>  <br>Holy shit. I lost it when they started to sing Kuuso Rumba at the end</br>  <br> Rumba <br>That was clearly Ringo</br></br>  <br>She sucks though. That fighter girl attempt was awful.</br>  <br><br>You're both retarded, that was obviously Lilycure Go Go.</br></br>  why is Carla so fuckable but at the same time not because she has Eren's face?<br><br>i'm so confused.<br><br>also let's talk about the latest chapter and what you think happens in the next one.</br></br></br></br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life</br>  <br>and Armin is a cute</br>  <br>She is fuckable because she has a nice face for a girl. Eren looks like shit because he has a girly face on a  borderline  manly body.</br>  <br> not wanting to fuck Eren <br>Faggot detected.</br></br>  <br>naw man Hanji<br><br>she's the best worst girl, or worse best girl... as far as the bad characters go she's the best.</br></br></br>  Keith didn't give them anything new to go on. They'll just have to go to the basement and fight MT.  <br>Keith did let everyone know he's ultra cuck 9000, so there's that.</br>  How long do you guys think Grisha was wondering outside the walls?  <br>I think he was one of the scientists 100 years ago who first created the Titans for the first king but he displeased him and was turned into a titan using his own invention by the king and was wondering around for 100 years as a normal titan like Yimir and either accident;ly ate a shifter from BRT's village or what ever and turned back into a human near the walls, and was found shortly after by Keith.<br><br>but that's pure speculation and i'm probably wrong but it would explain a few things about his arrogance of the walls and his score to settle with the Reiss family.</br></br></br>  <br>How awkward must it have been to hear your old instructor was in love with your mom.</br>  <br>If he was already a shifter it would then make sense how he was able to defeat Frieda. I wouldn't expect a mindless titan to be able to do that.</br>  <br>It must be like knowing your mom had other boyfriends before your dad, not much of a fuck.</br>  <br>maybe he didn't become a shifter until after he ate a shifter and didn't kill Frieda until after he was found by Keith, and was a normal titan up until then.</br>  <br> maybe he didn't become a shifter until after he eat a shifter <br> and didn't kill Frieda until after he was found by Keith </br></br>  <br>just a theory, we don't know exactly when he fought Frieda, could have been before he was found outside the walls could have been after.</br>  <br>Not the same. You didn't train under and fear that boyfriend and then find out that not only did he know your mom he loved her. And also that you remind him of her.</br>  <br>What? He fought her after the walls fell immediately before he turned Eren into a titan and was eaten himself.</br>  <br>and that he probably touched your butt as you slept quietly saying your moms name.</br>  <br> we don't know exactly when he fought Frieda, could have been before he was found outside the walls could have been after. <br>Anon.</br></br>  <br>no, a lot of time passed between him being found outside the walls and the wall falling and turning eren into a titan,</br>  <br>them abs tho</br>  Interesting how it was Grisha that fucked with Eren's gear back then. Not really important but I like how Isayama tied that together.  <br>Obviously. But that doesn't change the fact we know exactly when he fought Frieda.</br>  <br>I stand corrected.</br>   people expected Keith to give answers last month   <br>You mean Shadis</br>  <br>Is English your second language?<br> Grisha is found outside the walls <br> many years pass <br> Bert destroys the wall <br> Grisha confronts Reiss and steals the coordinate <br> Grisha finds Eren and passes it onto him <br> Grisha is eaten </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, time to go to sleep</br>  <br>And you all doubted Mikasa.</br>  <br>If it was Mikasa it would have actually made her interesting. Why are you happy that it wasn't her?</br>  <br> implying she still isn't suspicious </br>  <br>you can't blame us for suspecting the emotionless psychopath.</br>  <br> it would have made her interesting <br>You think so? I think it shows that she isn't completely controlling and will let Eren succeed if he's capable of it. She never tried to sabotage him, she was always supportive and just very protective.</br></br>  <br> emotionless <br>She has the Eren emotion though.</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say she's a psychopath, just a obssessive crazy bunkers.</br>  <br> it shows that her whole character is MUH EREN <br>And how is that good?</br></br>  <br><br>Look at this face. How can you not trust her?</br></br>  <br>it's a cover, she tries to emulate emotion but all she feels is an eren lust with no deep emotion.</br>  <br>She couldn't be more controlling than she is.</br>  <br>How would her messing with his gear have made her more interesting?</br>    <br>She could have used force to make him do what she wants but she didn't. All she wanted was to be close to him to make sure he didn't get himself killed. And she was right, he did end up dying without her.</br>  <br>She would be doing something out of the usual PRODEGD ERRAND shit, adding a different side to an one dimensional character is always interesting.</br>    Mikasa's not dumb enough to think Eren would be put off fighting teetans bc he couldn't use 3DMG. He probably would have done something even stupider than join the Survey Corps and she could at least protect him if she was using 3DMG as well.  <br>She is just a sweet girl who loves the people close to her.</br>  <br>Just he didn't, he can live on without Mikasa.</br>  <br>But that would still have been protecting Eren, but more obsessive. I'm not sure how you see that as different. <br><br>Cherry-picking.</br></br></br>  <br>She would finally be called out on her obsession.</br>  <br>Yes but at least she would be doing something different than being okay with every stupid move he made.</br>  <br> Cherry-picking. <br> here's another cherry picking <br>Although she's like this to anyone who even touches Eren.</br></br></br>  <br>Only thanks to freakish titan powers that he had no control of. She also needs to regularly rescue him from kidnappers.</br>  <br>*the entire SL rescues him from kidnappers.</br>  <br>Her obssession is what makes her uninteresting, though.</br>  <br> implying she isn't a flight risk. </br>  <br>And calling her out would make her reflect on it.</br>  <br>What makes her uninteresting is that her obsession is her whole character. There's literally nothing else to her. You could say there's her Ackerman origins but apparently it wasn't important at all.</br>  <br>But of course she is.</br>  SnK Live Action movie part one spoilers:<br><br>The universe is dystopian and post-apocalyptic, with mankind having suffered an extinction event after the modern technology era. Hence the appearance of heavy weaponry as opposed to just 3DMG.<br><br>During the first Titan invasion, the wall is destroyed and Mikasa is separated from Eren and Armin - and presumed dead.<br><br>A few years after the fact, Eren and Armin are in the Survey Corps, and Eren and Jean take charge of detonating explosives to seal the broken wall somehow. However, Titans attack again when they arrive for the attempt and they are saved by Mikasa and Shikishima.<br><br>Eren is eaten by a Titan nonetheless during the new skirmish, and the film concludes with Rogue Titan’s appearance. Mikasa is the one to pull Eren out of his Titan form.<br><br>Relationship-wise, Mikasa is not on the best terms with Eren due to her assuming that he abandoned her during the first attack. She is initially resentful of Eren when they reunite, and she has a semi-romantic relationship with Shikishima instead for this film. The kiss seen in the trailer will be in part 2 of the films, but their connection is established in this one (It’s heavily implied that Shikishima saved her).<br><br>Mikasa’s has an injury on her waist due to being almost devoured by the Titan during the first attack, which seemed to add to her coldness towards Eren. However, she still shows signs of caring for Eren throughout the movie, and their relationship improves by the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Somehow this reminds me of another thing we learned. Mikasa didn't know that Eren ate his dad. She wasn't covering it up or anything for his sake. Truly best girl. <br><br>You can't control your loved ones, you can only be there for them to help clean up the mess afterwards until they finally learn. <br><br>She's not afraid to get her hands a little dirty for her husbando. Nothing wrong with that. <br><br>Normally she's like this and she could be like this all the time if niggas would stop fucking everything up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Proof all Mikasafags are animefags.</br>  <br> she is uninteresting, so she's best girl <br> hey, look another reason why she's even more uninteresting <br> it means she a best </br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah she has backup. She still does a lot of the heavy work. They couldn't do it without her.</br>  <br> waifufag animefag <br>More like <br> how dare you interact with him I should be the one who do that </br></br></br>  <br>She killed some titans, so?</br>  <br> he used an anime screenshot, must have only watched the anime <br>I was just in the middle of rewatching it and have all my other pictures saved on my other computer. Don't worry I'm posting all of her especially cute pictures. <br><br>So mad.</br></br></br></br>  everyone knows Mikasa is bat shit crazy  <br> rewatching Araki's fic. <br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Interesting, it's coming out next month, right?</br>  <br> Araki's fic <br>The anime was faithful to the manga, you just showed you're a butthurt EArfag.</br></br>  <br>Okay, just for you.</br>  <br>Wait, do you mean to say he was a mindless titan like Ymir until he found a shifter to eat? I was under the impression that he was a spy.</br>  <br>Mikasa is a cardboard, satellite character with no personality other than "muh eren"</br>  <br>He was already a shifter when he left his village.</br>   Tfw live action Mikasa will probably have more personality than manga Mikasa.   <br>In Japan, yes. It already premiered here in the states last night. Also, Armin and Sasha have some kind of interesting relationship going on and like half of the OCs die. These spoilers are from people who went to the premiere.</br>  <br>I would try to argue with you but I think I'll make Mikasa pictures instead. Cry more.</br>  <br>The tree Eren was sleeping under in the first chapter has more character then Mikasa.</br>  <br> I-I have no counter-argument so I will just spam pics </br>  <br>I would agree with you, but her character in the live action movie seems to have a lot to do with Eren as well. She gets mad that he ditched her during the first titan invasion in the movie, etc. Her so called romantic relationship with the Levi imposter is likely just a red herring. They'll kiss and then NotLevi will go off and die and then EM will be endgame. Part 2 will play out like that.</br>  Mikasa is so one-dimenional that every time she interacts with a character other than Eren about something that isn't about Eren it's seen as character development on her part.  <br>It's also true that Mikasa still has feelings for Eren in the live action despite her relationship with Shikishima.</br>  <br>Everytime any character interacts with another character it's character development you retard.</br>  <br>Some are in denial.</br>  <br>I hope you're just pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>You don't know what character development is, do you?</br>  <br>Arguing with someone with a shit taste opinion isn't a good use of anyone's time. All I want to do is express my love for best girl and share it with others. I'm not even mad. Her expression of love and willingness to abandon less important things for that cause is one of the reasons I love her.</br>  <br>Yeah. She still seems to care for him throughout the movie and their relationship improves by the end of the movie. It's pretty obvious that EM is the endgame and the thing with Shikishima is a distraction.</br>  <br>Instead of saying that other people have shit taste for not liking worst girl how about you accept that you have the worst taste.</br>  <br> Everytime Mikasa interacts with another character it's character development <br>And you just proved my point.</br></br>    <br>Oh and Armin is pretty fucking useless for most of the movie. He totally gets third-wheeled for EM.</br>  <br> saying I'm wrong when I'm not <br>I can't understand what you're saying anymore, anon.</br></br>  <br>The actress who played Mikasa said she didn't think of their relationship as romantic, though.</br>  <br>Which of the ocs die? I heard Shikishima dies, how true is this?</br>  <br>The spoilers don't mention Shikishima dying, he's still in the second film.</br>  <br> second film <br>JUST</br></br>  <br><br>Any news about the other OCs in general? Are they similar to the rest of the cast or are they random?</br></br>  <br>That might just be her personal interpretation. I don't care about EM personally, but that's just the impression I'm getting from people who went and saw the first part of the movie. Also, one of the OCs named Hiana tried to hit on Eren (the scene was really forced) but then she gets eaten by a titan like right after so getting rid of another character that likes Eren makes me think EM is endgame. There's been rumors that Shikishima sacrifices himself in the final battle as well.</br>  <br>The sauce of the spoiler says they act pretty close to canon.</br>  I wanna do lewd things with Carla  <br>Hiana = Annie?</br>  <br>I meant the ones that don't have the names of existing characters.</br>  <br>Fukushi, Lil, and Hiana all die in the first part. Fukushi and Lil are dating, I think. Some people think they're like BA, but since they're death fodder they might be closer to Franz and Hannah.</br>  <br> I don't care about EM <br> EM is endgame <br>Sauce on that?</br></br></br>  <br>Why do they think they're like BA?</br>  <br>More like Franz and Hannah, since they were the generic tragic couple that dies in the beginning.</br>  <br>It's oddly fitting that a Mikasafag is unable to understand anything that contradicts their obsession.</br>  <br>Some anons thought she was Historia, but I don't think she's meant to represent any one character in specific. Her part is pretty lame. She basically hits on Eren and then becomes titan food.</br>  Will BRAYH be in the second movie?  <br>None. I'm just rehashing fandom speculation. It's still possible Mikasa could end up single or even die.</br>  <br> this foreshadowing <br>I knew it. Mikasa will try to kill Historia for trying to steal Eren away from her.</br></br>  <br>From their movie descriptions probably.</br>  <br>If you're implying that an anon is like the character they love then stop right there. I will not flatter myself and think I am anywhere near as wonderful as her.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Hiana, silly anon.  Stop thinking about EM </br>  <br> She basically hits on Eren <br>Yeah definitely Historia.</br></br>  <br>Can you post their descriptions?</br>  <br>Nips seem to think she's Annie.</br>  <br>Okay. This will probably trigger some autism due to the source, but a user on Reddit said they went and saw the movie and said Hiana dies and then some Mizuhara fan on Twitter (a friend of Fukushuu's) said some of the OCs die as well. The Mizuhara fan has pictures to prove that she was there.<br><br>See here:<br>https://twitter.com/TeamMizuhara</br></br></br></br>  <br> colossal titan and female titan die <br>They're not BA, although they could have their personalities just to keep BA in the movie without actually including shifters.</br></br>  <br>Then I suppose BA aren't even in the SL in the movie.</br>  <br>I think they just used some character traits from characters from the manga and added something new, but it's not supposed to be them.</br>  <br>Not than anon, but I think they're just the ones on their character posters for the movie.</br>  <br> I don't care about the sauce's sauce. <br>But I already know that some OCs die.</br></br>  <br>I think Lil sounds a lot like Christoria.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but the user on reddit provided a lot of details and fukushuu was on there and didn't dispute any of their claims so there's no reason to believe they're lying.</br>  <br>Maybe Lil is a mixture between Historia and Annie. I also think Lil's description sounds more like Historia.</br>  <br>I mean that I don't care if the sauce is from leddit or tumblr.</br>  <br> Mikasa is dating Levi but she doesn't love him <br> Histora tries to seduce Eren but gets chomped on <br>HELMfags BTFO</br></br></br>  The film is getting really positive reviews from the people who went and saw it. Most of them liked the CGI, the titans, and the gore. It sounds like a bunch of edgy normies went and saw it then.  <br>The actress also said that she doesn't ship EM.</br>   Eren, remember our promise that we would always be together <br>No matter how you look at it this movie is really pushing EM hard. I wonder if Isayama got a heartattack.</br>  <br>He probably didn't care. This also reminds me a little bit of the muffler moment.</br>  <br>Why do people like to assume that Isayama is so against EM? He's probably the one who gave the ideas for an EM romantic subplot.</br>  <br>Because these threads are full of people who care more about shipping and their own fanfiction delusions than what's actually in the manga.</br>  <br>Judging by this thread and the general hate for Araki and Mikasa, Arminfags don't like canon.</br>  <br>A lot of official side material that he supervises also has EM.</br>  <br>What is this "no matter how you look at it this movies pushes EM"? Did some jingles get rusted?</br>  <br> Arminfags <br>More like HELMfags.</br></br>  <br>EHfags and LMfags have no reason to hate the anime, only Arminfags do because a EAr scene was removed and replaced with EM.</br>  We all know that Araki and the movie director go for EM because they know that what attracts the normalfag viewers is a cliche romance between the two mains.  <br>Yeah, they probably got inspired by this scene.</br>  <br>  Eren goes full muh Historia and Call Your Name plays in the background <br>That was a fun day.</br></br>  <br>Or because Araki already knows the ending and Isayama tried to give EM a more interesting relationship in the movie.</br>  <br>I can see why someone who likes Armin would hate the anime since they removed certain important Eren and Armin friendship moments. More specifically, Armin holding Eren gently as he emerges out of his titan form was a very sweet scene and it was unnecessary to put Mikasa in his place.</br>  <br>I don't ship anyone in SnK<br><br>Eren is like, asexual, Armin shows little interest, the people who liked Historia are either, evil, or Jean and he's not shown any interest recently.<br><br>Honestly there is no sexual tension in any of the characters, Ishiyama has put no effort in it and as a result I just can't ship anyone with anyone.<br><br>Which concidering I read a lot of echhi shit it's a welcome change of pace for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't that song also play during the bolder scene. I get the feeling they don't even care about the lyrics.</br>  <br>I don't remember it playing during the boulder scene, but it played during graduation if I remember.</br>  <br>It also played during his fight against the FT in the city.</br>  <br>Or because Araki knows that EM won't be canon in the manga so he's going for an anime-original ending where EM does get to be endgame.</br>  <br>I think it did play during the bolder scene. It also played at the beginning of Annie's second fight.</br>  <br>Doubt it. Official side material also pushes EM a lot. We know already that Isayama is good friends with the spin off authors and he gives them a lot of ideas and supervises their stuff.</br>  <br> Isayama cares about pairings more than shekels </br>  Does somebody knows if second recap movie went out on blu ray?  <br>EM is always one-sided in side material and spinoffs.</br>  <br>Mikasa is shit for an MC, her blandness could be tolerable if she was a side character though. Betraying Eren would actually make her slightly interesting.</br>  <br>He cared about the movie.</br>    <br>He was actually complaining that the movie didn't go the way he wanted it to be.</br>  <br>I know. He only occasionally shows that he cares a lot about Mikasa. The rest of the time he's oblivious.</br>  <br>It's still showing in theaters. If it goes the same as the first one we may get it as early as about two months later.</br>  <br>I had hopes that her being an Ackerman and thus somehow related to Levi would add something to her personality, but instead she was like<br> yeah I Ackerman too, where muh Eran </br></br>  <br> It's still showing in theaters <br>Are there spoilers for any new other scene?</br></br>  <br>I don't even care about the Ackerman subplot anymore.</br>  <br>He said he liked the movie, just that they didn't get his wild ideas like<br> Jean as the MC </br></br>  <br>Other than Hanji and Nick at the end, probably only a couple of seconds at the very end of Eren waking up in bed and sitting up, I'm quite sure it's a new scene, that's about it I think.</br>  <br>Was he dreaming about Frieda again? It could be another thing to link to Season 2.</br>  <br>Mikasa and Levi should just talk already, there's no need to keep pushing it anymore.</br>  <br>No, it was really short didn't seem to mean anything deep, just a closeup of him blinking and a further away shot of him sitting up.</br>  <br> tfw they'd rather mention useless scenes like this instead of plot-related ones </br>  <br>Actually, in the recap movie the girl who says "see you later, Eren" sounds exactly like Mikasa. That may be the reason the scene was skipped in the anime, it would have given away who it was.<br> tfw there will be time travelling </br></br>  <br>They also animated the Mikasa/Annie scene from Chapter 44 and added in some in Eren and Annie training scenes that were in the manga, right? And Nifa appears as part of Hanji's squad in the scene with Nick and her hair is bright cherry red like Isabel's hair.</br>  Erwin's eyebrows sure are something  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>I wonder if he uses gel on them too.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I thought that was in the dTV motion comic of Chapter 1? And it sounded like older Mikasa?</br>  <br>That's right, but it wasn't a spoiler for the second season so I didn't mention it. I only knew about Nifa from reading about it online, must've missed her. I'll try to catch her next time.</br>  <br>So did they retcon the ep. 25 ending at all or did they keep everything the same? (Eren titan fire rage/ Eren/Annie attempted fusion/Manlet's rescue of Eren, Wall titan reveal after the credits etc.)</br>  <br>Thank god they removed Hanji's stupid plan of trying to use a net to capture FT again, also Jean's muh Marco, which made it a bit more bearable. A lot of parts with Marco were cut out.<br><br>Wall titan was there though, with Hanji and a few others discovering it. I guess we'll see how they'll link it to the end of the first season. Everything else you asked about is still there, just to make sense in the sequence of events.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw there will be time travelling <br>Wait a minute there, we still don't know how Frieda will sound like.</br></br>  <br>The net worked once, why wouldn't it work again?</br>  https://akiba-souken.com/anime/vote<wbr>/v_50/<br><br>Nip popularity poll. It's going to be open for 5 more days. You can vote up to five times.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Couldn't proxyfags completely destroy it though?</br>  <br>That's probably already happening with Eld and Nanaba's votes. They went up unnaturally fast.</br>  <br>Alright, time to rush my shingeki to a billion votes, sure this will look legit.</br>  <br>FT still got away though, and it was ultimately just filler that wasn't very good to watch. I'm not really interested to argue whether the net makes sense actually, just that it was bad filler. But yeah opinions.<br><br><br>Reminds me of Hannes and the horse racing poll. Those were good times.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Rico makes first place </br>  <br>Probably. That power gap between Eren and Erwin is ridiculous but Erenfags were really riled up about Erwin beating Eren in the last poll so maybe they're proxyfagging hard.</br>  <br>Same with Mikasafags.</br>  <br>Diarrheakasa is objectively worst everything.</br>  So a review of the live action movie is out on ANN and they're calling Mikasa Eren's girlfriend, but she gets taken from him and "defiled". Basically, the reviewer says the movie is a horror movie and everyone else is reduced to one dimensional characters to suit Eren's plot line. Armin is the typical best friend, for example. And Mikasa is totally butchered and unrecognizable from her manga self.  <br> horror movie <br>Does this mean that Utgard is saved?</br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Just testing something out. <br> https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Sb<wbr>qovti2YRn9dZiTuYoLqrmrNoe4SSS0YSChK<wbr>zp0hHQ/viewform</wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br>Don't know. It seems like the titans and the gore are the main positives of the movie.</br>  <br>So both Eren and Mikasa must be OOC as fuck for EM to work out.</br>  http://imgur.com/a/dP7G0<br><br>New Chuugakkou chapter. Titan shenanigans and a play. <br><br>Chuugakkou Bert is not Chuugakkou CT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and you want to know how live action Eren is different from the Eren of the manga? He doesn't even believe titans exist, he thinks they are a fairytale meant to keep people inside the walls. Holy shit.</br>  <br>But they saw the original CT on TV, how can you tell? He even dressed up as him.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>And the reviewer has the nerve to compare this live action movie to Silent Hill and End of Evangelion. I forgot how shit ANN was. It seems that both Eren and Mikasa are dramatically altered characterization wise.</br>  <br> compare this live action movie to Silent Hill and End of Evangelion. <br>Opinion discarded.</br></br>  <br> And the reviewer has the nerve to compare this live action movie to Silent Hill and End of Evangelion. <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Silent Hill has absolutely nothing in common with SnK. ANN is retarded.</br>  <br>Anon, my heart.</br>  <br>What is she up to this time again?</br>  <br><br>I didn't see either of those. Were they bad?</br></br>  <br>The Silent Hill movie is bad but the first few games are good.</br>  <br>The Silent Hill movie was terrible. It took away a lot of symbolism for example.</br>  <br> Wall Reiner <br><br> Is there anymore of Frieda? <br> Is an anon would translate it, I could typeset. </br></br></br></br>  <br>She's changing the screenplay that they were going to enter for some theater tournament.</br>  <br>Watch Eva. You can't live on like this.</br>  <br>Watch Evangelion, and then EoE. No need to watch the other movies.</br>  <br>I tried and didn't care for it.</br>  <br>By the way chuugakkouanon, you should compile everything on a account, so it will be easier to find later.</br>  <br>Holy shit, my sides. Why is Chuugakkou Bert such a miracle?</br>  <br>I think he's refering to this, but here it's just Armin thinking, he isn't suposed to know.</br>  <br>i personally wager he was having a nice near death fight with his caring brother MT</br>  It's set in a "post-apocalyptic word" where technology once existed. You can see a crashed helicopter on the wall. The movie starts out with Eren, Mikasa and Armin going to the wall and being caught by some random dude. That's when Armored Titan kicks the wall down and the Titans entire and eat everyone. Here's a key difference; Mikasa is supposedely "eaten" by a Titan because Eren gets seperated and ditches her.<br><br>Flash forward 2 years, Eren is in the SL and gets into a fight with Jean about how he "ditched" his girlfriend. They go on a mission to get explosives to detonate above the wall so block it up. On the way to the location, Titans attack and they are saved by Shikishima and Mikasa (who now hates Eren).<br><br>Eren tries to reconcile with Mikasa but she is pissed because he ditched her. The titans surround them and some random person in a hood (probably going to end up being Annie) steals the truck and drives away only for random sub-character to stop her and ram it into a Titan.<br><br>Eren gets pissed and flies into a bunch of Titans and gets eaten. Cue him turning into Titan a bit later and the movie ends. It's actually a two part movie, with part two coming out later in September.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  SnK:<br><br> Eva <br> Yamato <br> Lost <br> Silent Hill </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh</br>  <br>So BRA are in the LA.</br>  Fukushi and Lil are supposed to be the Franz and Hannah of the live action movie. Hiana seems to be a completely random character, only existing for the sake of including more love drama.  Also, the second movie will probably include characters like BRAYH that weren't included in the first movie for obvious reasons.  <br>I like this.  Although they probably won't look like the manga ones because of the actors stuff. </br>  So edgy normal fags will like the live action movie, but fans of the series will hate it. That's what I'm getting out of this thread. I wonder how the movie will do in Japan.  <br>I can understand BRAY not being in it but what's the reason for Historia being excluded?</br>  <br>She's the queen/leader of the wall people.</br>  <br>I don't know about other anons, but I'm getting a good vibe about the movie. I still have too see it to r8 though.</br>  <br>What about Erwin? He's excluded too.</br>  <br>This<br>or they'll make her be a part of the enemy faction.</br></br>  <br>I though he was that old commander?</br>  <br>Apparently that old commander acts more like Hannes. He's drunk and sad a lot.</br>    <br>He's just like Shikishima/Levi- excluded from the movie but having other characters filling in for them.</br>  <br>He's decent looking but not enough to justify Mikasa's beyond desperate beta husbandofaggotry. Especially when she's met guys like Reiner, Ian and Erwin.<br><br>Grisha must have injected him with some pheromones that makes him irresistible to Asians.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless Ackermans are really betafags who goes full servant on the Jaegar/Reiss bloodline.</br>  Mikasa and Shikishima are dating in the movie but when Eren comes into Mikasa's life again, Mikasa starts having doubts about her feelings for Shikishima and Eren acts all possessive and jealous.  <br> Molho? </br>  <br>The proxyfagging kind of takes away the fun of these polls to be honest.</br>  <br>That sounds horrible</br>  <br>This sounds so OOC. They might as well have just used OCs for Eren and Mikasa too. I can't believe Isayama approved all this love drama.</br>  <br>I love Mikarin. Please, more reaction faces. She is comedy gold when she is not being 2nd humanity strongest.</br>  <br>Yeah, Mikasa kissing guys and being in a relationship with anyone that isn't Eren is just weird.</br>  <br>It's a little sad she will die a virgin though.</br>  <br> implying Shikishima didn't dick her many times over </br>  At least live action EM is more interesting, Isayama should be taking notes.  <br> Mikasa and Shikishima are dating <br><br>I thought it was more a platonic relationship with her senpai with some lewd undertones because I assume both are still humanity's strongest.</br></br></br>  <br>Well apparently he was involved and helped writing the script.</br>  <br>Mikasa getting a bf to make Eren jealous?</br>  <br>It's just a plot device to make a love triangle between Eren, Mikasa, and NotLevi.</br>   Don't laugh. <br> Fucking CR, I did my best to fix it up. </br>  <br>Shikishima is trying to score her and Mikasa told him that she was going to try and give him a chance. The kiss happens in the second movie and there are rumors that Shikishima will die for his waifu Mikasa.<br><br>So yeah, they're kind of not officially dating but they're getting close to it.</br></br></br>  <br>Giving Mikasa some personality and Eren not being an annoying brat.</br>  <br> platonic relationship <br>But anon, they kiss.</br></br>  <br>Mikasa not being all "muh Eren" and Eren not being completely oblivious to Mikasa.</br>  <br>Eren's never been an annoying brat though. He's a nice guy trying to do his best in a shitty world.</br>  <br> jealousy <br> not annoying </br></br>  <br>Looks good anon. Didn't see the CR version, so how they fucked it?</br>  <br>Well he mostly acts like an annoying brat forwards her. Although that changed a little after ch. 50.</br>    <br>He's an annoying brat to Mikasa all the time.</br>  <br>Mayonnaise attack.</br>  <br>If you put it together you see how bad it is.</br>  Feels good to support the only canon pairing in SnK.  <br><br><br>On his deffense, Mikasa is annoying as hell.</br></br></br>  So in order for EM to work in the live action movie, the personalities of both Eren and Mikasa had to be fundamentally changed from their manga counterparts?  <br>They are both annoying.</br>  <br>She really is great.</br>  <br>Too bad both characters are the worst ones in the series.</br>  <br>Edited without the text for comparison.</br>  <br>Pic unrelated.</br>  <br>Mikasa is still the same, except they made her obsession to Eren slightly less prominent.</br>  <br>Obviously. They're incompatible in the manga.</br>  <br><br>It's okay. Maybe someday you will also get a whole movie about your OTPs.</br></br>  <br>Mikasa is still the same, just less obsessive. Eren's character is also still developing in the manga.</br>    <br>I don't want a 3DPD movie and I don't care about any pairing.</br>  <br> Reiner will never order you to not put up a fight as he has his way with you </br>      <br>What is this trying to convey?</br>  <br>You know, just Mikasa being autistic</br>  <br>Bert pls.</br>  Mikasafags are retarded.  <br>No, we are true connoisseurs.</br>  Are they all virgins?  <br>Armin is half virgin.</br>  <br>Historia lost it to Ymir</br>  <br>Yes.  But Eren and Hisu already held hands. </br>  <br> Mikasa is supposedly "eaten" by a Titan <br>Wot? I don't get it.</br></br>   128118322 <br>Eren is a hand holding slut.  But he held Armin's hand with nothing to gain from it. </br>  <br>You think she was eaten, but she wasn't and shows up later with notLevi. <br><br>What I want to know is how notLevi and Mikasa got their fighting skills since apparantly they never became soldiers like Eren.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously meant for</br>  <br>Historia and Armin definitely aren't.</br>  <br> This sounds so OOC.  <br><br>The movie is not adapting the manga. It's not a faithul adaptation, it takes some elements from the manga and makes them its own.</br></br></br>  <br>I see it now, thanks.</br>  <br> her <br>Did they make it obvious it was a girl?</br></br>  <br>Connoisseurs of shit.</br>  <br> Mikasa facing the other way <br>What does it mean</br></br>  <br>I can see them getting away with a nip Bert since he has dark hair, same with Ymir but nip Reiner, Annie, and Historia is going to look bad.</br>  <br><br>He also held Mikasa's, but she was wearing protection. Does it still count?</br></br>  <br>How is that holding her hand? He's pulling her arm.</br>  <br>Looks like Nakamura.</br>  <br> Pulling arm=/=holding hands <br>No.</br></br>  Dem drawings  <br> Elen <br> Mention Historia two times, doesn't mention Mikasa <br>Kek.  She's obviously his SnK waifu. </br></br></br>  <br> Jean  <br>pic related<br><br> Armin <br>Molester-kun<br><br> Historia <br>Frieda<br><br> Eren and Mikasa <br>Definitely but she'll rape him eventually<br><br> Sasha <br>She most likely sucked a few dicks in exchange for bread<br><br> Connie <br>Who'd fuck Connie?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Nice fujo drawings.</br>  <br> Who'd fuck Connie? <br>Sasha?</br></br>  <br>Delusion.</br>  <br>Only one could be seen as a fujo fanart and it's the EL one.</br>  <br>The one with just Eren also looks like fujo art to me.</br>  <br>He's alone though.</br>  <br>I meant that it was drawn by a fujo.</br>  <br>Not all female fans are fujos.</br>  In a post-apocalyptic future where only a fraction of humanity has survived to live humbly amongst the rubble, Eren Jaeger dreams of more. His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called "Titans" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted "Titan Survey Corps" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what "freedom" means to him in a new world ruled by fear.<br><br> Eren and his girlfriend Mikasa </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that from the NNa review?</br>  <br>Fujoshi =/= Female fan</br>  Wall Theory.

And why is Bert saying Annie?</br>  <br> Why is Ymir raising Historia's hand? <br>Historia is too short to be seen.<br><br> And why is Bert saying Annie? <br>Maybe they have to be in a group with someone and he wants to be with Annie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> got it right <br>It doesn't sound that right to me.</br></br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  I haven't read SnK in a while what happened lately?  <br>Mikasa is pregnant.</br>  <br>Which was the last chapter you read?</br>  <br>The one where Historia's dad turned into a titan</br>  <br>Rod is dead, Historia is Queen and MT and BR are waiting for Eren at the basement. That's about it.</br>  <br>Bert and Reiner were back for two pages, we officially saw MT's face, and now they're written off the story again. Oh and Grisha was from outside the walls.</br>  <br><br>Thank you</br></br>  <br> Historia killed Titan Rod  <br> Historia got crowned <br> Historia punched Levi <br> Levi smiled <br> BR and MT are in Shiganshina <br> Mikasa and Ymir are cucks <br> Keith was in love with Carla <br> Keith first met Grisha wandering outside the walls <br> Keith is the biggest cuck in snk <br> Hobomir's whereabouts are still unknown </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Keith is the biggest cuck in snk <br>He didn't even make a move on Carla.</br></br>  <br> Bert  <br> back for two pages <br>Sounds boring as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>He was obnoxious and deserved every bit of suffering he went through.</br>  <br>Reiner fought against MT, because BR wanted to save Annie first before getting the coordinate.

So Mankasa was Keith the whole time?</br>  <br>No, Mankasa was the father. Keith was the rapist.</br>  <br>You know, the usual.<br>He wanted to run off to Armin when his waters broke while Mikasa was trying to carry him.<br>He refused her help and slipped.</br></br></br>  <br>So Mankasa didn't rape Eren? Did he get pregnant just by being within her manly aura or what?</br>  <br>Mankasa secretly injected her sperm inside of Eren while he was sleeping.</br>  <br>Why did she do that when she knew all the important stuff Eren has to do to save mankind? Eren has no time to be pregnant right now.</br>  <br>Mankasa thinks if Eren becomes a mother he might stop being so reckless. It's for his own good.</br>  <br>Yeah, he already gave birth. See </br>  <br>Kek.</br>   Hiana is a single mother who joined the SL because they'd give her child financial support. <br> she's afraid that she will die in battle <br> after Eren and Mikasa get separated she tries to seduce Eren and tries to make him promise to be a father to her child <br> In the end she ends up being eaten </br></br></br>  <br>The fuck?</br>  <br>So movie Eren is going to raise some woman's baby and movie Mikasa is going to be fucking OC manlet?</br>  <br>This is not made up right?</br>   Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br> Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead <br> It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life <br> During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack <br> It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on <br> Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him <br> At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly <br><br>This is how the EM plays out on the movie.<br><br><br>It's legit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Also, all the characters that exist in canon remained close to their canon personalities except Eren and Mikasa. Eren is more "serious" and Mikasa is completely different.  Movie sounds like a trainwreck.  Can't wait to watch it.   <br>I'm gonna watch it just because the whole romantic subplot sounds way too retarded.</br>  <br>So all Mikasa has to do is pretend to cuck Eren, make him jealous and he'll finally want to fuck her?</br>  <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on </br>  <br>Is the director high?</br>  <br>Armin and Sasha will end up together as confirmed by the movie.</br>  <br>So is it confirmed that Eren and Mikasa will cuck each other with OCs and end up together raising a kid that's not theirs?</br>  Why the fuck did they change the movie so much from the manga?  <br>Welcome to all movie adaptations ever. Hollywood are not the only ones that do it.</br>  <br>Because they want to force their fanfic delusions on everyone.</br>  I wonder what will happen when they include BRAYH in the second movie.<br>Might as well have Connie and Annie married with children.</br>  <br>So people wouldn't argue over its canonicity.</br>  <br>They will make RH and BY canon, but not before having a love triangle going on that goes Y &gt; B &gt; H &gt; R &gt; A</br>  <br>It's actually Y &gt; H &gt; R &gt; B &gt; A and  why not since it's canon .</br>  <br> Historia liking Reiner <br>Reiner pls go spread your delusional elsewhere.</br></br>  <br>No it's R &gt; B &gt; Y &gt; H &gt; A</br>  <br>I see nothing wrong with this.</br>  <br><br><br> forgetting Connie </br></br></br>  <br>Who's Connie?</br>  <br>More like Y &gt;&lt; H &lt; R <br>B &gt; A</br></br>  <br>Anon, we're talking about the movie here.</br>  <br>Ymir... please</br>    Who is monkey business?

Our heroine's seiyuu did a really good job, too.</br>  They should of followed more of the novel format in terms of characters, and focused more on the music aspect. 7/10  Obnoxious cinematography, shallows characters (even though they were a tad better in the LN), disappointing in terms of actual music. Character interactions were relatively entertaining and the BGM was kind of nice, the artstyle is by far the best thing about it, but way to often it was overshadowed by filters.

I think they could branch out a bit while still retaining the "cute girls" if that's what they need to sell anything.</br></br></br>  <br>What would you like KyoAni's next work to be?</br>  <br>My friend had an idea to have this be set on a cruise liner and they all have conversations with people on vacation while struggling to learn music to suit the region.</br>  <br>/a/ definitely oversold it, but it was nice.</br>  <br>Yui Hirasawa has to play castanets in her new high school. As she is desperately castanetting, she sees and hears a guitar and instantly falls in love with it. It turns out that the bass guitar was played by her new classmate Mio Akiyama, one bassist girl who decided to attend this school because of one reason, there is no policy against keion music. Not only that, there is apparently a keion club on campus. Yui and Mio instantly become friends and she is able to convince Yui to start playing guitar. Now the only thing Yui has to do is get a guitar... <br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=63482</wbr></br></br>  <br>Didn't watch all of it, but if it kept the same pace throughout then I think it's boring. KyoAni just does not have a knack for choosing stories anymore. They pick the most simple premise that allows them to best show off their animation (which they do beautifully, I'll add). I'm sure they did the novel justice and even made it better, but I can't relate with band melodrama.<br><br>Of course the usual rebuttal would be, "well it's just not for you".<br><br>Well why should an anime with such narrow appeal be considered AOTS let alone AOTY? Only certain type of viewers will like this sort of story. I think you can admit that without saying it's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Well why should an anime with such narrow appeal be considered AOTS let alone AOTY? <br>Its a meme.</br></br>  I feel kind of disappointed the way KyoAni did this. The novel focused mostly on Kumiko's growth and the drama around a certain person of a year (Novel 1 Reina, Novel 2 Mizore/Nozomi and Novel 3 Asuka). I know they wanted to focus a lot on Reina, but if they ever do a second season, its going to be pretty glaring that the focus will be more on the second years and Reina plot is just to help us understand Taki. Kind of how Chuu2 shifted the attention to Satone and stopped focusing on Isshiki.  <br>It sucks that KyoAni isn't actually doing Bakuon</br>  <br>Well that's the last time I take KyoAni fans serious.</br>  <br>I quite enjoyed it. The OST was great and as expected from KyoAni the animation was beautiful. Just the right amount of yuri bait to keep me coming back and eagerly awaiting advances in their relationship.</br>  <br>What a novel idea!</br>  <br>Is it confirmed that they aren't? I mean the manga doesn't seem like something they would do but it is definitely enjoyable.</br>  <br>It was based off a novel and you know what he meant. Fuck.</br>  <br>No, I don't<br>there's a big difference between an LN and a novel</br></br>  <br><br>Can't really say, did not watch after episode 6.</br></br>  <br>I have no particular source material in mind. I just want some variation in setting.</br>  <br>AOTS.</br>  <br><br>If we're gonna list disappointments, this PV gave me false hopes about the kind of music we'd hear in the show.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6<wbr>B320TbJk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Kiniro Mosaic be there instead? It fits the theme more.</br>  <br>Kiniro S2 was awful.</br>  <br>Say that to my face not online and see what happens DESS</br>  <br>I think you are alone in that opinion.</br>  Just finished marathoning the whole series 5 minutes ago.<br>Coming from someone who never read the LN I think it was great.<br>8.5/10, would be better if most of the mysteries were properly explained (Asuka being Asuka for example)</br></br>  Yuri OVA when?  <br>What does quality got to do with anything? <br>Koufuku Graffiti was the worst SHAFT show of the decade, worse than ever Mekakucity Actors, yet its still on that list.</br></br>  <br>The only theme is /a/'s official and objective AOTS's, anon. I have no idea what else you could be talking about.</br>  <br>Isn't that Houkago no Pleiades then?</br>  <br> would be better if most of the mysteries were properly explained (Asuka being Asuka for example) <br><br>In other words, a second season that fleshes out more of the characters would be a good thing.</br></br></br>  Are they seriously going to release these 2 episodes at a time?  <br>Never. Reina is in love with a man, you know?</br>  <br> worst SHAFT show of the decade <br>That's Sasami-san.</br></br>  <br>Is this the first time you have ever watched a seasonal anime and waited for its BDs?</br>  In my top 3 Kyoani show's for sure, It was fucking beautiful despite the pointless Yuri baiting I really enjoyed the characters.<br><br>I'm desperate for an S2.</br></br>  <br>the second season was shit</br>  <br>If width of appeal was the primary criteria for determining what is good, Naruto and One Piece would be AOTYAY.<br><br>Using a less extreme example, Kekkai was by far the post popular non-meme show last season, but I thought it was rather generic and tropey. Of course, there are people who get hyped up with those shonen type things and value other things in shows than I do. I'm never going to be convinced that was AOTS or whatever just as much as you're never going to be convinced this was. Basically arguing opinions is a waste of time even though I still come back here every day to do it.</br></br></br>  <br> That's Sasami-san. <br>Stop right there you heathen</br></br>  <br>Yes, actually. I've never paid attention before.<br><br>When will the batch release come out?</br></br></br>  Please anons, PLEASE. Tell me what you think about this.  <br> LN <br>lmao nerd<br><br>Anyways, compared to Nodame or even Kids on the Slope Hibike is pretty trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/'s AOTS/AOTY and outside-of-/a/ AOTS/AOTY are two completely different things. Hibike had a lot more people calling it AOTS here than Kekkai, and Hibike's threads were far more active and prolific. Kekkai was more popular outside of /a/ because fujos.</br>  <br>you are a ape, stop posting</br>  <br>If we're going solely by popularity on /a/, I'm pretty sure Yahari beats Hibike.<br>Hell, they still have back to back general threads, while Hibike ones died out a week ago, and we have a sporadic daily thread or two that doesn't even max out anymore.</br></br>  <br>Actually I see that they don't plan to, apparently.</br>  <br>you are cancer</br>  <br> I don't hate it </br>  I thought it was great, I appreciated all the little details that filled us in on who the characters were and how they interacted with one another.  <br>Says the guy being a faggot about semantics. Piss off.</br>  <br>YOU MUST PICK ONE<br> <br>AMABURI SEASON 2 OR HIBIKES SEASON 2<br><br>ONLY ONE LEDOUCHE WHAT WILL YOU DO</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Ledouche didn't like Amagi<br> why do I know this? I'm going to go kill myself </br></br>  I will be a potato farmer!  <br><br>I'm mostly going by what I saw in AOTS threads (which I admittedly stopped going to like half way through the season) and it seemed like Kekkai was more popular in those.<br>I know Yahari threads were absurdly popular (and absurdly terrible) but not many people were claiming it as AOTS if I remember correctly.<br>Either way I'm realizing how stupid this argument is and should probably stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If we're going solely by popularity on /a/ <br>Popularity (e.g. # of people watching it) and people considering it AOTS here are two completely different things. Yahari's threads were more active and more prolific but there weren't nearly as many people calling it AOTS. You don't have to think something is AOTS to like it and want to talk about it.<br>What is it, exactly, which generated so much Yahari discussion here? Waifuwars? Is that it?</br></br></br>  <br>anon, he is always saying how much he loved amagi <br><br>and yes you should ded</br></br></br>  <br>Just so you know anons. I'll be making a Hibike thread every two days.</br>  <br> I'm mostly going by what I saw in AOTS threads (which I admittedly stopped going to like half way through the season) and it seemed like Kekkai was more popular in those. <br>Yeah, I'm not sure where that guy is coming from, either.<br>I lurked in those threads for a little bit and there were far more people shitting on H!E and Kyoani fans than H!E fans calling it AOTS. For every person that called it AOTS, at least three people would make fun of him for it.</br></br></br>  <br>Can you not start that way? Or should someone else make them instead?</br>  <br> and it seemed like Kekkai was more popular in those. <br>The only times it seemed like Kekkai was more popular in those was when the threads were being flooded by the same shitposts about Hibike over and over such as "filtered backgrounds," "forced animation," etc. Put two and two together here, anon.</br></br>   unironically taking AOTS threads seriously, with yaharifags, fujofags and fatefags samefagging to death   <br>Anyone is free to make the threads they want, so if someone else wants to make them good. I'm just saying I'll make one every two days.</br>  <br>Do I really need to spell this shit out for you people? That was IRC. You're probably IRC.</br>  <br>You can't really take those threads seriously.<br>Even popularity shouldn't be taken seriously.<br>I usually just bait since saying whatever anime you thought was the best will get shitposted to death.</br></br></br>  I really like buchou  <br> What is it, exactly, which generated so much Yahari discussion here? Waifuwars? Is that it? <br>It's not like these threads were much better. First half of the show, the threads were waifufaggotry and bandblogging, the second half of the show, threads were waifufaggotry and yuri wars. The only redeeming factor here was the tripfag posting the novel spoilers and generating discussion that way. <br>Yahari threads are some of the worst I've ever seen on this board, but H!E threads aren't much better.</br></br></br>  <br>Good and gay.</br>  <br>I'm just saying that because instead posting about the show we are talking about literally everything but Hibikes, anon-kun</br>  <br> First half of the show, the threads were waifufaggotry and bandblogging, the second half of the show, threads were waifufaggotry and yuri wars. <br>You forgot masturbating over KyoAni's production, which is completely understandable.</br></br>  <br>popularity =/= better<br><br>also Yahari is everything but /a/, pretty much what happened to kill la kill doomed Yahari threads as well</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it'll derail to our normal convos soon, my dear anon. It's not like past hibike threads were Asuka or yuri was discussed in the OP were successful ;-; </br>  <br>Holy shit that's why I can't take /v/ermins. Kill yourself.</br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki.   <br>Well, at least it's being bumped to death. I'm not sure it's a good thing though. <br><br>What's your favorite scene on the show, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>I reached a point where I was just able to glaze over the shipping faggotry during the second half and enjoy whatever was left. It was usually a lot better later in the week too.</br>  <br>This is cute. Where did you find it?</br>  <br> A boy falls in love with a girl.<br><br>Unable to confess, he is gifted by a deus ex machina with the girl's phone number. Never minding the strange area code, he immediately calls her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.<br><br>But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. In fact, she doesn't exist in this universe at all. She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC's own AU self, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.<br><br>Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves. While the two chase their respective loved ones, DRAMA ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the NATURE of LOVE. </br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>All of episode 13.  I cried a little bit. </br>  It was nice. Not AOTS but still pretty good. Shame that the threads were complete garbage.  <br>Was posted in another thread, not sure where it's from.</br>  <br>I liked discussing the difference of the novel and the anime. Its one of the more interesting discussions.</br>  <br>Taaki?</br>  <br>Its not on pixiv?</br>  SHITTY DUMB YURIFAG SCUM.  <br>T-Taki</br>  <br>oh my fucking GOD!</br>  <br>Delusional yurifag got it from weibo</br>  <br> &gt;its <br> Noses <br> Fat <br> Eyebrows <br><br>It's like every yurifags I've ever known!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would Taki want to marry her? I'm sure he'd never want to marry anyone after the experience with his wife.</br>  <br>Great now the Reina fags are gonna come out.</br>  エヘン  <br>Why must you even add that? Its cute.</br>  <br>Trips for truth.</br>  <br>These two are actually adorable in the novel I ship them in the novel, its too bad KyoAni didn't really show it in the anime.</br>  Reina and Kumiko were written with such great chemistry. Their  friendship  felt really natural  <br>They did though. Episode 12 warmed my heart with their little interaction.</br>  <br>Very pleasant surprise. The script, story and characters are following traditional storytelling formulas and offer nothing new but they are written pretty solid. The production itself is great, though. The animation is lively, directing is fascinating and captivating. Hell, almost every character actually has unique and recognizable body language. Best KyoAni since last Haruhi.</br>  <br>Read the novel and you'll know what I mean.</br>  <br>Have you reads the novel yourself?</br>  <br>Garbage-tier. Just like all KyoAnus shows since 2010.  Except Hyouka. </br>  Nice visuals but I really couldn't get into the BAND DRAMA.  <br>I thought the interactions between Oumae and Kousaka was the most enjoyable thing to watch last season</br>  <br>They have richer interaction, its not just small talk, they are very cute around each other, Kumiko really enjoys his company, They actually don't argue that much, Shuuichi apologizes to her and is not an ass and the best interaction with Kumiko besides Asuka is Shuuichi. Kumiko also shows more interest in him and doesn't treat him like an annoying sibling.</br>  <br>It was boring shit that needed non-stop bait and pandering to garner any interest. I weep for the whiplash-esque story we could have had. <br><br><br> Hyouka <br> Not boring trash  <br>As expected of Kyoani fanboys</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> KyoAnus <br/></br>  <br>10/10, perfect thing to watch while at band camp last week.</br>  <br>For yurifags maybe.</br>  Would I like this show if I was a bandfag in high school  Would you like college Hibikes?  <br>Reina will study overseas, anon.</br>  <br><br>Almost every bandfag has enjoyed the show, I've only seen one complain about it.</br></br>  AOTY 2015    <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>good taste</br>  <br>Purdy good.</br>  <br>S2 when?</br>  <br>never</br>  <br>Fuck you, faggot.</br>  <br>I liked it.</br>  <br>Behead those who insult ponytail.</br>  Someone decipher the nip in this image for me. Does Asuka hate EVA?  <br>That's a redundant statement</br>    <br><br>I didnt like it. She looks too mature with it.</br></br>  <br>Ponytail Master Race</br>   7 (seven) key animators   <br> bakemonogatari-senjougahara_003798<wbr>70.png</wbr> </br>  <br>Every girl looks better in a ponytail.</br>  <br>so? that won't forbid them to hang out together on vacations since they are good friends</br>  <br>Reina?</br>  <br>Add shuichi to the mix since he'll be dating Kumiko.</br>  <br>Is Shu the new Hitomi? When will we get a doushio edit?</br>  <br>Kumiko doesn't revolve herself around Shuuichi anon, plus Reina is cool with him, they are all friends. Also Kumiko doesn't want to lose her friendship with Reina, its an issue of her in the second book for a reason. She doesn't want to lose any of her friends.</br>  <br> Kumiko doesn't revolve herself around Shuuichi anon, plus Reina is cool with him, they are all friends. <br>Yeah, pretty much this. Hell, Reina is the one that teases Kumiko about Shuichi and wants her to date him.</br></br>  <br>Does she tho?</br>  <br> Reina asking Kumiko and Shuuichi for advice to get Taki. <br>Pls Kyaoni.</br></br>  <br>Oh god this would be amazing<br><br>Please Godani</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ok since we are talking about Triangle Festival, how many times have you watched it, /a/?</br></br>  <br>Yes. She's a shipper.</br>  <br>In the novel the two are cool with each other. Will have to see what will happen in the anime. Since all these relationships are so different. Also Kumiko in the end is closet to Asuka out of all the girls.</br>  <br>Of course. Even in the anime, in episode 8, when she asked Kumiko what's going on with her and Shuichi, she smiled when Kumiko said there's nothing going on. She knows them both since middle school and knows they're meant for each other and that Kumiko is just being in denial.<br><br>Why wouldn't Reina want her best friend to be happy with a man she loves?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I still don't get how she left the room before Hazuki. She's the type to have an agenda.</br></br></br>  Hazuki a best, fuck the hater(s)  <br>What are you talking about neither Kumkio and Shuuichi were close to Reina in junior high. All three of them were not even aware of each other. It was by the time they got dud gold that Kumiko actually started to take notice of her and that was third year.</br>  <br>I'd rather amagi get a s2</br>  <br>I want</br>  <br>When I meant of three of them, I meant two weren't aware of Reina, and Reina weren't aware of them.</br>  cute girls doing cute things  <br>They weren't close, but they were in the same band together. So they were at least aware of each others existence.<br><br>And Kumiko and Shuichi were much closer before they had that fight, so probably everyone knew they were eventually going to hook up just by looking at them.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't staring at Shuuichi there, she was staring at Kumiko.</br>  <br>Yurifags PLEASE.</br>  <br>In the novel sure, since Kumiko was also teased by Azuza about him and she was her best friend in junior, but I still don't know about the anime. Seriously Kumiko getting teased about Shuuichi was a reoccurring thing in the novels. It wasn't just Reina.</br>  My sweet trombone.  <br>She was looking at the camera, the camera is Shuichi's point of view next to the other trombones.</br>  <br>They were both looking at that direction, Idiot its called angles. Please stop with the immature name calling, its making you look like a moron.</br>  <br>As a yurifag, she was looking at Shuichi. As a yurifag, she was aware Shuichi had been watching Kumiko and didn't appear pleased.</br>  <br>Dude, what? How is that a "yurifag" comment? A "yurifag" would interpret that scene as Reina glaring at Shuichi because she's looking at Kumiko. A normal person would interpret it as Reina and Shuichi both looking at Kumiko (Reina wants to be friends with Kumiko, remember?) at the same time and noticing each other.</br>  <br> Her eyes were looking at the direction where Kumiko was, Shuuichi caught her looking. They were both looking.</br>  <br>Kill yourself you delusional cow</br>  <br>It wasn't just Reina in the anime, either. <br>Remember that one Hazuki chick? She also said something about it, if I remember correctly.</br></br>  <br>Kyoani...finds a way.</br>  <br>Excuse me? What is wrong with you? Are you like this with your mother, honestly I'm abhorred by your poor behavior. I was just making an assumption. What in the world made you such a vile human being?</br>  <br>Did you draw that?<br/></br>  <br>The people who wnt to see shuichi win are the landwhales</br>  <br>She asked if they were going out. But honestly it felt jarring compare to how the novel portrayed the Kumiko, Hazuki and Shuuichi triangle. As you read more about the Relationship between Shuuichi and Kumiko it becomes very obvious that KyoAni downplayed it a lot.</br>  <br>Dyke/10</br>  <br>It also annoys me constantly because their relationship in the Novel is just adorable and full of cute moments.</br>  <br>It was pretty boring</br>  Best KyoAni since Hyouka, not quite as good though. Really good, needs an s2.  <br><br> lmao nerd <br><br>Kill yourself kid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get it either. Why downplay it so much yet keep the shuuichi crushing on Kumiko aspect?</br>  <br>Because they just downplayed the romance, they didn't remove it.<br>The only reason people are arguing Kumiko sees Shuichi strictly as a friend only is because they don't want her to like him. Her reactions are pretty ambiguous and can easily be interpreted as romantic, without the need for any sort of "goggles".<br><br>It wouldn't be the first nor the last time that Kyoani downplays romance in their show. It's just that this time they've done it maliciously - so they can keep people wondering if the yuri baiting is more than just yuri baiting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To keep the self insert otaku's into it. Honestly I really love the paring, but because of the anime I can't fully enjoy it because they really cheapened their actual relationship. So in the end I will just treat the anime as a different retelling of the story, while continuing to gush at the novel interactions between them. <br><br>Its like they wanted to omit Kumiko's thoughts about Shuuichi in the anime which really annoyed me.</br></br></br>  <br> interpreting that scene the way I want to and no one can stop me! <br>Then I shall do the same.</br></br>  <br>Its stupid because by season 2, Reina won't be as important, instead its Asuka that takes her place and tries with Kumiko beside her to fix second years dramafest.</br>  <br> Its stupid because by season 2 <br>Wouldn't it have been funny if someone made predictions on how the first season should have gone based on the novels?</br></br>  <br>I don't get it.<br>How else would you interpret that scene?</br></br>  <br>You are so autistic it's funny. She's a best, indeed.</br>  <br>it was adapted well besides the yuri scenes that were made for it to sell</br>  <br>Are trying to say they won't follow the main plot which is the second years drama and instead focus on a one sided love of a girl towards her teacher which is only a sub plot. I won't doubt their will be focus on that but you're kidding yourself to think that Reina will be more focused compare to both Mizore and Nozomi as well as Asuka.</br>  <br>It didn't need the yuri bait to get the sales, honestly it ruined it.</br>  <br>I enjoyed it, I was in band however so I'm a bit bias.</br>  <br>no, it was needed anon<br><br>it was selling mediocre before ep 8, did you ignore the selling burst?</br></br></br>  <br> What did you think of this? <br><br>Well, didn't watch because Kyoani is dead.<br>I hope they comeback with Amagi season 2</br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't have to make it too alluring, the original had Reina poking Kumiko's cheek, not dragging her finger down to her lips. It was just annoying at best, which then brought the threads to hell.</br>  <br>It's a shame, really.<br><br>If Kyoani didn't include all the pointless yuri fanservice that didn't lead anywhere and just distracted from the show, I'm absolutely certain most people here on /a/ would consider the show as the first post-Hyouka Kyoani show that was better than Hyouka.<br><br>But on the other hand, sales increased quite a lot after episode 8, so it's hard to deny that yuri bait didn't play a role in boosting sales.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>38</br>  <br>They need to learn how to balance their directions.</br>  <br>it's quite simple: with yuri they made profit and we will likely get a season 2 announcement on October <br>without blatant yuri: gets praised here (which means nothing) and we don't get shit</br></br>  MORE  <br>Yamada is prodigy, anon</br>  <br>Second novel is full of yuri subtext man, the second years are gay and the central.</br>  <br>I'm looking forward to it</br>  <br>Ishihara is the main director.</br>  scan never  reminder  <br>I'm serious Mizore pretty much hates concerts and their unfair treatment because it made Nozomi cry.</br>  Like Hyouka but with characters that you can actually like and story that didn't suck   you will never have a character development like this   <br>The problem isn't in yuri subtext on its own. <br>No one gets annoyed by, say, YuukoxNatuski subtext or AsukaxKaori subtext, and no one is going to be annoyed by MizorexNozomi subtext.<br><br>The problem is when they do stuff like KumikoxReina. It's annoying because everyone knows nothing is going to come out of it since they're straight and have straight love interests. It's just shallow bait. It would be one thing if they had the courage to go anime original and make them a real couple, but they haven't even done that. It just makes the show look shallow and detracts from its quality.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Great meme.</br>  <br>based</br>  <br>I wonder who they will get to voice Mizore</br>  Thoroughly enjoyed it. My only criticism would be the yuri bait. I like yuri, but didn't like that it went nowhere. If it was going to do yuri, it should either have gone all the way or toned it down a bit.  <br>*the proper and true anime audience</br>  <br><br>  (OP) <br> It was boring shit that needed non-stop bait and pandering to garner any interest. I weep for the whiplash-esque story we could have had.  <br><br>Non-stop bait? Nice try</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mizore/Nozomi subtext are almost text honestly. Maybe once they up the Reina ----&gt; Taki shit in the second season and make Kumiko distracted with the second year drama, people will lose interest on the paring, and will eventually focus on Nozomi and Mizore as well as Asuka. But honestly don't be surprised if people ship Kumiko with other girls (She has quite a few scenes with Nozomi, Mizore and Asuka) if they continue to downplay Shuuichi. Hopefully they won't keep him completely sidelined in the second season, since, him, Hazuki and Midori are pretty much background characters in the second novel.</br>  <br> You will never smell her angelic fart <br>Why even life?</br></br>  <br>Dumb frogposter.</br>  <br>Something similar to Reina I guess, but deeper and wispy. I don't picture Mizore with a high shrinking violet voice. Nozomi though is most definitely someone with a deep mature and tomboyish but charming voice.</br>  <br>As long as I get to see more wacky Taki-related antics by Reina I'm happy.<br><br>What else does she do besides stalk him and break a glass out of jealousy?</br></br></br>  <br>It brought the threads to hell because people here are dumbasses who'd rather fight and rant over a 5 seconds yuri glimpse instead of talking about the actual show. <br><br>Kyoani may have overdid it, but what's annoying is the autistic behaviour we all saw through the threads, not the adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>Dead fish eyes, and complaining about it all night in her and Kumiko's assigned cabin. Though don't worry KyoAni likes the Reina jealously of anyone with Taki jokes, so they'll most definitely crank it up in the second season, as well as the Mizore scaring the hell out of Kumiko jokes.</br>  <br> No one gets annoyed by, say, YuukoxNatuski <br>That's not true, since people love Natsuki, but hate Yuuko.</br></br>  <br>Yuuko is the best character in the second novel.</br>  <br>But not in the anime, so the vast majority of people will never see her being best girl, and by extension will forever be hated everywhere.</br>  <br>Some people like her actually, but trust me when I say that the way she was in the first novel was horrible. The anime made her more human and sympathetic, I believe its a hint that they are thinking of doing a season 2 where Yuuko is pretty much the best friend anyone could have.</br>  <br> they are thinking of doing a season 2 <br>Are you this new or something?<br>What fuckever signs is there for KyoAni being interested in that?</br></br></br>  Visually appealing yet a better sleep inducer than Hyouka. I dropped it at episode 5 while I managed to finish Hyouka.  <br> As long as I get to see more wacky Taki-related antics by Reina I'm happy. <br>Amen to that</br></br>  <br>KyoAni were interested in Yuuko's character and wanted to put more focus on her. It was in an article about the upcoming episodes.</br>  <br>She looks autistic.</br>  <br> horribly poorly directed ones <br><br>There's that phrase again</br></br></br>  Any content from the 2nd BD yet? For some reason I'd really like to see the changes to the eyecatch.  Reina~  <br>They put Mizore at the center of the frame all the times, even though she doesn't even have a speaking part<br><br>Definitely wanted us to notice her</br></br></br>  <br>what the fuck is wrong with her head? she looks like a sectoid</br>  <br><br>I don't know what you think of KyoAni, but this was definitely a low profile project never intended to be continued.</br></br>  I pledge loyalty to the Ribbons.  <br>They also focused on Yuuko and Mizore, and showed us that Yuuko is pretty much taking care of her and being their for her.</br>    <br>You have her blowing?</br>  <br>Holy shit fucking swallow bleach you cancerous pretentious faggot</br>  <br>They also showed Nozomi in the last episode. Pretty much covered all their bases for a continuation</br>  <br>Not to mention they make Mizore look distant and depress compare to the rest of the girls. In the second novel its only in the last chapter that she actually smiles, so its a pretty important clue to show how unhappy she is. Being Mizore is suffering.</br>  This included of course.  <br><br>Nothing of those imply there would ever be a continuation. This isn't a big hitter, and KyoAni would most probably like to work with more males also.</br></br>  Let the yuri begin  <br> make Taki the teacher <br> he gets all the bitches </br></br>  <br>I need a better one.</br>  <br> Go home club </br>  <br>It's in my top 5 all-time favorites.</br>  <br>how many anime did you watch faggot?</br>    When and how will Reina and Taki consume their love?    <br> gif <br>Get with the times</br></br>  <br>Really shouldn't have assumed I've correctly named all of these</br>  <br>There is a fix for the foot of that picture.</br>  <br>pay debnts</br>  <br>Not that anon but I interpreted it as a relieved smile.<br> "Yokatta, I'm so glad it isn't like that." </br></br>  <br>How and why? she's interested in Taki sensei and nobody else. Why would she be glad Kumiko isn't dating shuuichi.<br>Why</br></br>  Besides the cute girls doing cute things and the strong yuri baiting, I really enjoyed it. It had some really well done scenes, every character is very well defined while being complex and interesting. I felt like I understood everyone's goals and motivations. I liked how the covered the subject matter of an orchestra band, it didn't go super in depth but didn't gloss over it. Another issue was the ending; unless it sets up for season two, it felt really incomplete, which it is.  <br>Only 123 things so far</br>  <br><br>And they skipped all of that for yuri baiting, and he wont be appearing much in s2 so Kyoani basically screwed his character unless they make more anime original scnes.</br></br>  <br> she's interested in Taki sensei and nobody else. <br>She's interested in Kumiko. This isn't a secret or assumption because she literally says this several times. <br>It's not even something that necessarily has to be romantic. It's not at all an uncommon plotline for someone to become jealous when a romantic interest gets between your relationship with a friend.</br></br></br>  Show got me hooked with the cute girls and nice subtle visual effects but was completely disappointed with the OP and thought they should have done it with a wind ensemble. Then I got that at the very end. 7/10   S-Sensei, how d-do I look?   <br>Sexiest kyoani girl tbh</br>  <br>If that were the case, Reina should be jealous of Saphire and Hazuki then</br>  <br><br>Is this OP a meme now or something?</br></br>  <br>That's an easy one considering Amaburi was dogshit.</br>  <br><br>I feel like you're the only person on /a/ that actually understood the show and got what you were intended to get out of it.</br></br>  KyoAni's best work of the 2010's, next to  Amagi   <br>Who says she's not, a little. <br>But having other friends is different from having a boyfriend.</br></br>  <br> Nope </br>  Anime of the season. Before anyone objects, prove otherwise. I saw the majority of the spring shows and not many other shows come close in this awful spring season.  <br> Who says she's not, a little. <br>She doesn't show. <br>Besides, it's not like Kumiko is her main priority. The fact they're in the same school was just causality after all.</br></br></br>   When does Reina finds out Taki is not dating his university friend?   This is what K-On! should have been. An actual plot, girls that are pleasing to the eyes and actually involving the subject matter. It is one of KyoAni's finest works.  <br>Yuri/10</br>  <br><br>We'll have at least something. KnK and Tamako Market had lower sales yet they got a movie.</br></br>  <br>I think we have a winner</br>  <br><br>The issue is that there's a lot more material to adapt, I doubt KyoAni could just slap a movie together to conclude the series. They'd have to really commit and do a 2 cour season and maybe several OVAs for volume 4's stories. I really wish they'd bite the bullet and finish what they started, even if it means committing to this instead of pursuing a work that might be more profitable.</br></br>  <br>It was fun, but I wish they could have focused more on the music and less on the band drama. I also find it confusing why Kyoani would effectively remove the set-up for Kumiko and Shuichi's little romance sub-plot in favour of more yuribaiting.<br>I suppose they've just given up on that plot thread.  Still, I hope they tone down the Kumiko/Reina yuribait in any possible sequel. Too many anons went autistic over that shit. The threads were nightmarish. </br></br>  <br>KumiRei &gt; TakiRei</br>  <br>K-ON was great for what it was. This was great for what it was. <br>Why can't people enjoy things separately?</br></br>  <br> . Still, I hope they tone down the Kumiko/Reina yuribait in any possible sequel. Too many anons went autistic over that shit. The threads were nightmarish. <br>What a faggot. Threads were funny. Yeah sure, there were lots of shitposting but it worked to let off steam.</br></br>  Season 2 - 1-6 episode for vol 2and 7-12 episodes for vol 3. Vol 4 will be OVA's. This is the only way I see them doing more of H!Eupho dont expect a 3rd season or a movie.  It was okay. It looked pretty, it had a decent plot, it didn't do anything horribly dumb.<br><br>But god damn did I forget about it quickly. It did absolutely nothing interesting enough to be remembered. Maybe it was technically the best anime of the season, but there are many others I will remember more than this.</br></br>  <br>You wish</br>  <br> Obnoxious cinematography <br>I can't believe I just read this<br> even though they were a tad better in the LN <br>Yeah, you're retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The shitposting really took off after episode 8, and it was fun for maybe a week, but it kept going for another two or three weeks after that. It got old.</br>  <br> Threads were funny <br><br>Sure for the first few threads sure, nut after five plus weeks of the same arguments, same name-calling/boogeymanning, same shitposting, it just got tiresome. I have no wish to repeat the same threads.</br></br></br>  <br>I know it. You know it. And they know it.<br><br> ねぇ　今　誰に会いたいの？ねぇ　今　誰を愛してるの？それが私であるこ<wbr>とを　いつも願ってるんだよ</wbr> <br> ねぇ　心は見えないから そう　すぐ不安になるけれど 信じる事でしか　私たちは　明日に進めないんだ <br> 夜空に浮かぶ星たち　誰かを想いながら この街中で　どれだけの人が　見上げてるのかな？ <br> 世界中の綺麗なものを　全部集めてみたとしても あなたが今　笑ってくれる　それだけには敵わない <br> ねぇ　あなたといる未来を もう　迷わず信じられる どんな言葉よりも　あなたはただ　隣にいてくれたから <br> もう一度　愛を求めて　生まれてきたとしたら あなたのもとへ　やさしい色をした花を届けるよ <br> 世界中の優しいものを　全部集めてみたとしても あなたの手に　包まれてる　この場所には敵わない あなたが今　笑ってくれる　それだけで生きてゆける あなたの手に　包まれてる　この場所には敵わない <br><br> 愛を見つけた場所 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuri shit ruined it  <br>Why can't we all just get along?</br>  It was fun while it lasted but it's not going to stay in my memory for long unless a second season pops up.  <br>Because the Shuichi romance is clearly tacked on to sell the LN, it's pandering. <br>The ReinaxKumiko friendship (I won't call it romance or yuri) make far more sense and is more useful considering the themes of the story.</br></br>  <br>IT'S HAPPENING!</br>  <br> K-ON was great for what it was. <br>Yeah, I guess it was the greatest inane corporate dross designed with no artistic intention beyond ripping off idiotic gooks ever.</br></br>  <br> Dat horse chin <br>Take your 3dpd and fuck off</br></br>  <br>But that's Love Live.</br>  <br>They really need lewd fanart. Pronto.</br>  <br><br>Know what? That it's all yuri baiting and nothing well ever materialize from it?</br></br>   If I was once more reborn to come seek love I’ll bring to you, a flower with a graceful color <br><br>It all makes sense now.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Welcome to /a/.

And if it's seriously your idea of fun then please go back to /v/.</br></br></br>  <br>At least we got official art from it and at least it's better than any TakiRei, and at least absolutely nothing will come from that.</br>  No thread?

She's the prettiest though. </br></br>  <br>Radiant Force in GX so far. In general, I couldn't possibly pick just one.</br>  <br>Is she still even a gear though?</br>    <br>Did you just skip the op?</br>  <br>Hibiki is kind of cheating.<br>Remember she is the strongest on raw power.<br>But I'm sure FIS girls are almost equally strong, Maria overpowered Tsubasa by bits in S2 and Chris had her problems against Kirika as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who saw the promotion art would say yes. Kinda smart of them to tie her gear repair with the other gears getting broken by alchemy. I was worried it'd be out of place.</br>  <br>Adults can't be the cutest, especially in a group of cute fluffy retarded girls like the other geahs.</br>  <br><br>Maybe, but Maria doesn't have to be the cutest anyway as she's the most beautiful one.</br></br>  I'll be really disappointed if we don't get at least one instance of Maria being drunk in GX.  <br> Maria overpowered Tsubasa by bits in S2 <br>Tsubasa was debuffed but I get your point. Maria is overall weaker than the main trio due to being a druggie but she played it well enough that she managed to match Tsubasa's skill. Problem was, the debuff didn't last while her LiNKER ran out so Tsubasa became stronger and just as skilled while Maria couldn't even use her gear for long.</br></br>  <br>Edge Works.</br>  Tsubasa should forge her own katana.  <br> Chris had her problems against Kirika as well <br>Chris was put completely out of commission by Kirika. It was an unmistakeable defeat. <br><br>To be fair though, Chris was being forced to fight close-ranged, so Kirika had a huge advantage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The ED shows her with one so the crazy girl might actually forge one of her own since her gear broke.</br>  <br>G-BAIT!</br>  <br> But I'm sure FIS girls are almost equally strong, <br><br>Anon no they run out of juice way too fast and are way less skilled. Maybe after this seasons training montage they will be close but Sword could 3v1 them if she was serious.</br></br></br>  <br>She probably already has one. Or a warehouse of them, just like she has for her bikes.</br>  <br><br>She probably owns a whole armory already.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It's likely that the FIS girls will directly receive upgrades from Elfnine. Maybe those upgrades also remove the dependency on Linker.</br></br></br></br>  Why wasn't Ver in the OVAs? Goddamn waste.<br><br>Ressou Gungnir.</br></br>  <br>Chris was not only under the effects of anti linker but took major feedback damage shortly before. Hibiki effortlessly deflected any attack they threw at her and Tsubasa rendered Kirika useless in under five seconds. On top of the fact that none of them ever fought them seriously because they never wanted to hurt them.</br>  How will the whistling at the start of G-Beat be used in the show?  <br>chris was already pretty fucked up at that point though.<br><br>the only 2 times maria overpowered tsubasa she was under the effect of anti-linker and wasn't transformed, once tsuabasa was even slightly on even ground maria got her shit pushed in.<br>the only time the fis girls even slightly stood a chance they has a huge advantage over the other geahs and even that was quickly nullified.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As an intro to transformation while Hibiki is having her speech.</br>  <br> Anon no they run out of juice way too fast <br>Not him but I'm really expecting them to go with the "X-drive made you all natural gear users" explanation so they don't have to depend on drugs. Maria's gear broke so she couldn't test it and they were all in jail so I doubt they had the chance to try. They'll still be weaker of course but it'll mean they can hang for longer periods.</br></br>  <br>It is impossible for Tsubasa to win against a two of them.<br>Maria alone was enough to fight on par for a bit, and Kirika overpowered Chris.<br>A 3 or 2 against 1 would wreck everyone except Hibiki.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki vs Berbiki on the moon</br>  <br> canonically weaker and can't fight without doping <br> need to fight with a partner to actually get anything done <br>Are you high?</br></br></br>  <br>Maria was only winning against Tsubasa because Maria was hopped up on LiNKER and Tsubasa was still reeling from the effects of Anti-LiNKER. And despite that, Tsubasa managed to draw some of Maria's blood. Maria decided to gtfo because her sync ratio was dropping fast while Tsubasa's was recovering, and she knew that she would get absolutely btfoed.</br>  <br> Kirika overpowered Chris </br>  <br>3 anons already gave you corrections about how they're limited by drugs, how Tsubasa was debuffed and the same for Chris.</br>   we will never see chris go BAAANG again   <br> Anon please. I can understand the btfo but gtfo is a tad too much. </br>  <br>You're kidding right? Anytime they fought the main trio had major handicaps or did you just not pay attention. Both Maria and the twins comment how there is no way they could actually beat them several times in G. <br><br>They also never wanted to fight them in the first place. Hibiki could absolutely destroy them on her own if she ever got serious.</br></br></br>  <br>DMJii are chumps.<br>It would basically be a Tsubasa vs Maria fight.</br></br>  <br>Also, when Maria realized her sync ratio was dropping she said the same thing that Kanade did when hers was dropping, something like<br> My limit only goes this far? <br><br>I'm sorry anon. Please take this Chris as an apology</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's okay at least she wont get BANG by coins.</br>  <br>Any time Sword has actually tried she out skills anyone. Only person to really fuck her up was edgy Chris but she had the power of a full relic and Tsubasa was not fighting with a cool head at all.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm not saying that they are stronger, but they can put up a fight.<br>Yes, they have very low stamina and would lose after a while, but before that they can fight on par.</br></br></br></br></br>  The main trio were monsters in G.  Tsubasa's thighs.  <br>As expected of nippon sakimori damashii tsurugi sword Nana justice senpai.</br>  <br> fight on par <br>and that's where you're wrong, they never once fought on par with the main trio unless they had a massive advantage.</br></br>    <br>Edgy Chris and Edgy Tsubasa was hype.</br>  <br>And what people are saying are they can't fight on par. They're druggies so their time is limited and their sync is lower overall. The only time they fought evenly was when they brought down the enemy's level and turned it into a skill battle.<br><br>You could make a case that they're close in skill but saying that they can fight on par is something that factors in both their strength and skill. It's just not equal or close when you factor in both of those.</br></br></br>  <br> they can fight on par <br><br>With who the bridge bunnies?</br></br></br>  <br>Glorious Break, or if that doesn't count Radiant Force. They're both equal with Synchrogazer in my opinion.</br>  <br> skill even <br>hardly. they were winning because they brought the sych rate lower than theirs meaning the trio had to use superior skills.<br>all of the fis girls together couldn't outskill tsubasa.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't diss the bridge bunnies, I'm sure Ogawa trained them well.</br></br>  <br>Ogawa might be a good match.</br>  <br>Not really, Maria only put up a fight when she had a significant advantage and she fled as soon as she lost that advantage because she knew that she would get destroyed. Remember that the FIS trio all have very low sync ratios which is why they're dependent on LiNKER, while the main trio have amazing sync ratios (Hibiki's natural sync ratio was high enough to straight-up steal Maria's Gungnir). The FIS trio were outclassed in terms of power and they knew it, which is why so many of Ver's plans involved things like trying to sic two Zesshou-powered Gears on Hibiki or holding an entire stadium hostage (which was undermined because the FIS trio were good people and didn't want to involve innocents or fight unfairly)<br><br>Hopefully the FIS trio using their X-drive modes will bring them closer to the main trio's power level, especially since the writers said that they wanted to highlight their strengths in GX whereas G highlighted their weaknesses.</br></br></br>  <br>They literally can't unless they're drugged up, their opponent is on anti-linker, and their opponent is holding back.</br>  <br>This was already translated. Why won't the typesetting slaves do their job?</br>  <br>Already done.</br>  <br>I just want chris trying to act like a cool senpai just to fail and have her kouhai try to comfort her.</br>  <br>The new blade effects are so nice</br>  <br>Oh sweet.<br><br><br>But she already succeeded. Only Biki can fluster her through stupidity or Tsubasa through autism and dry humor.</br></br></br></br>  Powerlevels:<br>Tsubasa &gt; Hibiki &gt; Chris &gt;= Maria &gt; Shirabe = Kirika</br>  <br> sync rate lower than theirs <br>Was it lower than theirs? I mean the druggies already have naturally low syncs which drops fast. I viewed it as<br><br>Tsubasa 150 and around 90-100 while nerfed and regains her old strength as the fight goes on<br>Maria 100 while fully doped and drops as the fight goes on<br><br>Maria only really won it because of the sneak attack which messed up one of Tsubasa's landing and gave her an opening while their levels were still close. They did stalemate one another long enough that the drugs wore off for both of them. I don't think you can keep Tsubasa busy even with the debuff if you're not close enough in skill so I considered them "close enough" but not even.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is best Chris<br> Edgy Chris <br> Tsundere Chris <br> Current Chris </br></br></br></br>  <br>Best attack.<br>GX is finally making me like Tsubasa.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki <br> below anybody <br>Hibiki is complete bullshit and can pull miracles out of her charm point whenever she wants.<br>Tsubasa also lost against Chris in G</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes to all.</br>  <br>well its does a bit of lowering, but using abilities while on anti-linker didn't just make them weaker, it actually damaged the user as well. so tsubasa even using physical upgrades while drugged will do quite a bit of harm.<br>the moment the drugs did start wearing off maria ran the fuck away because they all knew she'd lose.</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa &gt; Hibiki <br>I think Hibiki's stronger even counting Tsubasa's skill.<br><br> Chris &gt;= Maria <br>I assume the equal is for when she's in close range and greater than when at range and Chris can make full use of her power where she has the advantage due to higher sync? That's fair.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DEWEL WHEELED<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1JZ<wbr>zhSegj0I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Tsubasa also lost against Chris in G <br>How can she have lost when they never finished the fight?</br></br>  <br>loli one.</br>  <br> tsubasa ends up in the hospital with jam coming out of every hole <br> chris just flies away and gets to fuck fine <br>its pretty clear who won that one.</br></br></br>  <br> in G </br>  <br>well fuck ignore that then.</br>  <br>I think Hibiki can't even touch Tsubasa even if she is in Berserker mode.</br>  <br>Chris beat her without taking a single hit on the boat :^)</br>  <br>I guess we'll find out  in Episode 7 </br>  <br>  :^) <br>Go back to /v/, shitposter.<br><br><br>That's true. In S1 she ended up allowing Zerbiki to hit her, for the hug, but she was fending her off pretty easily before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch episode 4 again right after Maria and Tsubasa clash. Maria is basically running on 0 and Tsubasa is only getting stronger.</br>  So. Which doll is going to betray it's master? Cause it's pretty obvious that Loli with daddy issues is not going to be the final boss.  <br>The final boss is obviously  Hibiki's dad </br>  <br> final boss <br>Someone we haven't seen.<br>Carol's otherworldly master or something.</br></br></br>  <br>A fifth doll or doll fusion.</br>    <br>In a surprise twist it really will be Carol</br>  <br>The slit eyed person in the OP.</br>  Tsubasa's attack may be not as powerful as Berbiki's, but as long as she can't hit Tsubasa it's still useless. Micha vs ShiraKiri's fight would be under the same situation.  <br>Who?<br>The sword?</br></br>  <br>The left one.</br>  <br>I think he meant the left and right eyes in this pic.</br>  <br> Carol confronts Biki with her daddy problems <br> For whatever reason Biki decides her reason to destroy the world is right <br> Biki becomes the final Boss <br><br>Would watch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh shit.<br><br>Slit pupil usually means Fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How would they revive Fine's soul now?</br>  <br><br> CUSTODIANS CONFIRMED </br></br>  <br>Alchemy.</br>  <br> Kanade get's resurrected and slaps some sense back into here </br>  <br> sucking out memories <br> soul memories or some bullshit <br> Shirabe gets kissu'd <br>Bam, Fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't her soul in Kirika?

Sometimes it looks like she has a slit pupil but it's hard to be sure because it's always been too dark.</br></br>  <br>In Sbirabe.</br>  <br><br>She's my favorite character in this shitpile, fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Kirika thought that Fine's soul was in her because that barrier popped up when a bunch of steel beams fell on her and Shirabe, but Shirabe projected the shield unconsciously. Kirika went off the deep end because she was afraid of turning into Fine, even going so far as to fight Shirabe in the gayest fight ever, but when she learned that Shirabe had Fine's soul all along she tried to an hero, but the attack hit Shirabe who pushed her out of the way.<br><br>Then it turned out that Fine had been trying to lay low and not take over her host, and sacrificed herself to save Shirabe.<br><br>It was a bunch of bullshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can Alchemy revive souls?<br>Kirika cut Fines soul.</br></br>  <br><br><br> sword <br>So not only is everyone now fine, everything is too?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The writers can just easily make Alchemy do what they want it to do. No sense trying to make sense of it.</br>  <br> Shitpile <br>Fuck you too.<br>All geahs are lovely.</br></br></br>  <br>I like Maria too but what the other guy said. It's rare for me to watch a show where I like all of the cast.</br>  <br>I still can't understand why they fought, surely it was the worst thing to do in that situation</br>  <br>They're not the smartest kids in class. Have you seen Kirika's "letter"?</br>  <br>We will see after Carol complete the Apocalypse of Banshou.</br>  <br><br>I didn't say the other girls were bad. But the show as a whole is unadulterated shit, there's no getting around that.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>But Kirika saw Fine in some kind of vision or other bullshit, so I guess she could awaken in both of them, but didn't wanted to because it's not her business. Also, I wonder if Fine's soul was destroyed, or her connection to Shirabe, but I'm not into keywords so I may not know some shit and talk bullshit.</br>  <br> People where saying it's so bad it's good <br> I've been enjoying it unironically <br>Maybe I just have shit taste<br>  Chris is best girl </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>At the very least she keeps it trimmed</br></br>  <br> Edge Works of Goddess ZABABA </br>  <br>Her voice is the best out of the dolls at least for me. The way she uses her skirt too.</br>  <br> But Kirika saw Fine in some kind of vision or other bullshit <br>In fact that scene was not in the script. The artist added it into storyboard.</br></br>  <br>I want to feed Tsubasa spaghetti.</br>  <br>I want to feed her anything. She looks like she could break in half in that pic.</br>  <br>Coin doll is best doll</br>  <br>Blue has that sexy old lady voice though.<br><br><br>Objectively the worst doll we've seen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to use Sword Break to break Leiur.<br><br>Symphogear GOD fucking when?</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously someone needs to fix her food plan.</br>  Why is Tsubasa so cool?  <br> bike murderer <br> cool </br></br>  <br> Kirika's "letter" <br>It actually exists? I always thought that OVA gag was kind of weird.</br></br>    <br>It's in the genes, and because she's a sword.</br>  These lyrics holy shit.<br>Rules of Nature tier edgy.<br><br>Berserk Tsubasa time?</br></br></br>  <br>She's just being chuuni and pretending she's a sword.

It'd be cute though. Tsubasa, Genjuro and Ogawa should go too.</br>  S2CA Fine Exclamation  <br>CRAWWWLING IN MYYYY SKIN.</br>  <br>I love when she says gattalingu though</br>  When will i get a new ep of sympho?  I want to pinch Tsubasa's arm.   I just remembered, it's her VA's birthday today in Japan. Happy birthday Hikasa.   <br><br>Galaxy Crossssss</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure we'll see Genjuro going with Chris, seeing as he is her legal guardian.  And depending on how hard they want to push the Maria/Tsubasa subtext I guess they could have Maria dragging Tsubasa along. </br>  Who G-beat here?  <br>Big week for bdays. Iguchi was the 10th, Nanjo the 12th.</br>  <br>TL pls.</br>  <br>Looking at it, only Hibiki and Maria would get their birthdays as the season is on. The 6 have pretty spread out birthdays.</br>  <br>Iguchi's was the 11th I think. I'm pretty sure she said her and Nanjo were only one day appart.</br>  <br>Like this?<br>She only has to wear glasses and no one would be able to recognize her.</br></br>  <br>Would she try to be hip and down with the kids like a cool mom?</br>  <br>She's only 21, she's not old enough to be out of touch with the youth there.</br>  <br>Shirabe being happy completes that pic. That's downright adorable.</br>  <br>I was already out of touch with the 15 year olds when I was 21-22. I imagine it's even more in Japan where seniority is a big deal.</br>  <br>I will not allow facts to get in the way of comedy!</br>  <br>you can tell she's used to making that motion with her hand.</br>  <br>Something something, Tsubasa letting out an adorable noise when she gets pinched, something, "This sword is cute!"</br>  <br>First Love Song</br>  <br> better than the one on wikia </br>  <br>What's Ashley doing there?</br>  <br> The writers can just easily make Alchemy do what they want it to do. No sense trying to make sense of it. <br>I wish anons would take this philosophy with every bit of in-universe logic and power level shit with this show.</br></br>  <br>TAKANARE</br>  <br>G-BEAT</br>  <br>Looks nice but Tsubasa's head looks off.</br>  Shadow weave is a super useful skill.  The amount of Maria and Tsubasa art that is coming out on pixiv daily is getting hilarious. How many doujins of them are going to be at comiket this year?  <br>Probably a lot.<br>And none will get scanned.</br></br>  <br>I hope so. I want more drunk Maria.</br>  <br>I'd be happy about this if I was assured that Tsubasa remains the top.<br>Alpha Tsubasa is my life force</br></br>  <br>But I like alpha Maria. They should switch back and forth.</br>  <br><br>It's not, there isn't much art of them.<br> I think you might be baiting. </br></br></br>  <br>No, Maria is made for bullying</br>  <br>I'm fine with senseless fun as well, but if they try to make sense of stuff then it just triggers my autism trying to work everything out.<br>As long as they keep it vague its all fine.</br></br>  <br>She was high on LiNKER and chinese mirrors, what she said then can't be trusted as her real feelings</br>  <br> LiNKER makes you gay <br>Mystery solved.</br></br>  <br>Is she high on LiNKER here?</br>  <br>Not so much on pixiv but I saw quite a few appearing on twitter the last few days. Granted, a lot was Kohakura reposting their stuff.</br>  <br>OVAs aren't canon<br> Okay I think you finally got me there, I just like counter-shitposting against you-know-who </br></br>  <br>Miku is always gay, just look at her in any scene with Hibiki in.<br>Like in:<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>[Wild ARMS intensifies]</br>  <br>Wrong Miku confirmed they are cannon in episode 2.</br>  <br><br>Still translations never. Is there no moon reading anon to save us?<br><br> I want to know the extent Tsubasa is bullying Maria in these </br></br></br></br>  <br>Sort of, she said she couldn't remember how she got a key to Chris's apartment.</br>  <br>An alpha Maria is just as wrong as a straight Miku</br>  <br>Motherly Maria is best Maria.</br>  <br>even Fine is not that edgy</br>  <br>Maria can be quite alpha if she wants to.</br>  <br>Oh come on, she was pretty Alpha in G.  For three episodes, anyways.  The two of them are probably both going to have their Alpha and their moe moments.</br>  <br>Why does the sakimori have a sword?</br>  This is not how guns work Chris what are you doing.  <br>She's a sword.</br>  <br>That scene<br> "Oh shit I actually hit her" <br> "Why did the sun rise so quickly?" <br> "Everyone is looking at me now" <br> "I'm striking a cool pose" <br> "What do I do, what do I do?" <br> "Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, she's attacking me" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It could've gone worse for her though.</br>  <br>There's not enough drunk Maria art.</br>  <br>Yes it is. It's gunkata + gunslinger style.</br>  <br> he's never played Time Crisis 3 on a TC3 machine </br>  <br>CHRIS IS C OOL </br>  Nana willed it.  <br>Cool design</br>  <br> CD8 are evil Kanade and Serena's songs <br>Would be fucking glorious</br></br>  <br>More like<br> Nana drew something that has no resemblance to a new enemy design created by the artists for Symphogear </br></br>  I don't understand Marias hair.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7er<wbr>PMTXr800</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I doubt she understands it either.</br>  <br>It can't be that hard, it's just a strand of her hair rolled into a ball.</br>  <br> no resemblance <br>I don't have the photo on hand, but it is Nana design transformed into a noise.</br></br>  <br>No. Resemblance.</br>  <br>The hair, the clothes and the katana is transformed into an arm.<br>It is not exactly the same obviously, but there is resemblance.</br></br>  I can't wait to see Shirabe use her yoyos.  <br>Since when did samurai resemble English style fencers?<br> No really, fuck off. Just as bad as the Kanadeisbackbecauseofadrawing fags. </br></br>    <br>Fanfiction.</br>  <br>Stop insulting Nana's drawing skills</br>  <br>It is up to you if you don't want to see.<br>It isn't even a "nana wills it", it is just the staff having fun.</br></br>  <br><br>You're both wrong and you know it, stop being fags. It has some resemblance but it's not really that similar. The fact there was a banana noise, clearly inspired by ever17's drawing, kind of makes you wonder if this really was inspired by Nana's design or not, but there's no decisive argument that can be made at this point, so the discussion is a waste of time in itself. We'll probably hear word from the staff about this sooner or later anyway, so chill about this already.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Just chill, why are you always so triggered by that random speculah, just ignore it.<br> Did your 1st waifu discover you had a 2nd waifu and is mad at you? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There isn't much to argue right now.<br>Might as well discuss the noise designs.</br></br>  <br> why are you always so triggered by that random speculah <br>I don't know.<br> People wanting Kanade to come isn't the problem, basing it on a drawing alone is retarded. Think of something that has basis at least.   Use the memory angle. </br></br></br>  <br>Then discuss it without being a fag. It's like the 4th time I've seen you people arguing over this with absolutely no arguments to show for yourself besides what I summed up in my post. It's becoming blatant 'u' 'no u' discussion at this point.</br>  <br>Zappy Dan is cute, discuss.</br>  <br> The cutest </br>  <br><br> &gt;/raildexgeneral/ <br>The least you could do is talk about cute Symphos.</br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki is also the cutest </br>  <br><br>Is Hibiki about to get fisted?</br></br>  <br>But I've never been to a raildex general. I'm scared of the degrees of autism I might find there. She's really cute too.<br><br> I'll stop now. </br></br></br>  <br> She's really cute too. <br>Dammit anon I'm trying to stay on track<br><br><br> Miku is mad because Hibiki accidentally hit her in the head with her knee, during the activity. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why don't they fuck already?</br></br>  <br>How do you know they haven't?</br>   it has some resemblance <br> long robe, blade weapon, same exact hear ornament as Nana's scrible, faces Tsubasa like Aoi suggested <br>We are you so in denial about a random detail like this? It's clearly based on Nana's drawing. They only counterargument I get here about this is a "nuh uh".<br>This doesnt confirm Kanade or anything so such autismal denial about such a clear shoutout is uncalled for. Also banana.</br></br></br>  <br>I want Miku to punch Hibiki's arm until it bruises. Then Hibiki climaxes after.</br>  <br> same exact hear ornament as Nana's scrible <br>Nana drew the guy's hair, the noise has a crest.</br></br>  <br>because they're best friends.</br>  Will Chris be able to protect Elfnein’s smile?  <br>Her song is pretty good this season.  But Tsubasa's is still superior </br>  Best doll when  <br> blade weapon <br>More like spike.<br> same exact hear ornament as Nana's scrible <br>Exact is a strong word. They resemble each other, I'll admit, but you don't need to force your argument beyond the evidence that's actually there.<br><br>I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm saying you don't have solid proof that you're right and there's no point in arguing about this any further. We're better off waiting for some actual confirmation from the staff or from the anime itself (like the noise doing something more bushi-like). Stop being defensive about this, I'm not the guy trying to say you're wrong. In fact, I think he's the most autistic one here because of how much he picks on this inconsequential thing, but you're letting yourself become as bad as him by becoming so agitated just because he won't accept your idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do we punish Carol for being such a bully?  <br>I wish dolls have cunts.<br>I bet hers would be hairy and constantly wet. yum yum.</br></br>  <br>Take away her hat and robe and make fun of her for being so small.</br>  <br>Snatch her hat away and hold it just out of her reach</br>  <br>Beheading or burning  her hat </br>  <br>Stallman-tan did nothing wrong</br>  <br>Ask her if her dad is  hot. </br>  <br> hairy <br><br>And here I thought I was posting with gentleman of good taste.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what "best friends" means in a Mahou Shoujos nowadays.</br>  <br>I'm now shipping biri with Hibiki</br>  <br> not ask her if her dad is   _hat_ </br>  <br>Anon, please.<br> Those are my 2 waifus you're shipping </br></br>  <br> liking smooth baby cunts <br>nah.</br></br>  <br>I always love Chris songs letter.</br>  <br> having 2 waifus </br>  <br> I can't just not love them anon, that's rude. </br>     no pv images   <br>I'm really curious what Maria's lyrics will be like this season.

Has it been done before?</br></br>  <br>Not in a fighter, but Mother 3 had that in the battles. You tap the A button to a tune and you do additional hits.</br>  <br>Kind of. Hitting enemy to the beat (given by a score at the top of the screen) gave you critical hits.</br>  <br>To be perfectly honest, having a good grasp on rhythm/BPM is a good way to work on timing attacks and such for any fighting game really, especially if you want to learn any frame traps the game has.</br>  <br>Crypt of the Necrodancer isn't really what you want but you do have to act in time to the music.</br>  <br>Bombed Pearl Harbor</br>  <br/>  <br> TAKANARE </br>  <br>I was actually thinking that the blocking would be beat based as well.

More importantly, she does not have the capability to be anything other than herself.<br><br>All of which makes her absolutely awesome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So I've been reading the manga, and Akira Kogami is completely different from how she is in the anime. It's enough that they should probably be considered seperate characters. <br><br>Manga Akira is still a selfish cynical failed child idol, but she's not nearly as exaggerated and caricaturized as anime Akira. Her segments aren't lucky channel, it's just sort of a spin off bonus they include in every manga volume where she has her own group of friends. She's actually a nice person in manga, and genuinely cares for her friends. I don't know what to feel when reading this after having watched the anime.</br></br>  <br>Konata is a perfect blend of semen demon and self-insert<br><br><br>Sorry, I'm horny and getting drunk<br>Dubs and I won't serve myself more sake</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the original OP that made this one. The original OP died a long time ago.</br>    <br>NIPPLES!

Not likely. Though her screen time is highly limited which means her particular inevitable human failings are directly portrayed only briefly. Such as, a lack of sensitivity to group mood and ability to calibrate behavior correspondingly. For another, an inability to study with discipline and application. That both of these look like they are expressions of an underlying structural flaw in personality only adds to their foreboding implication for the success and well being of an adult Misano.</br>          <br> Misano <br><br>It's Misao, got it memorized?<br><br>And yes, everything you said it's true as well. She is also very childish and immature.<br><br>But she is still a qt 3.14 with an adorable voice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I like this new turn of events. Can I please have some miyuki to celebrate my new promotion?

Nice.</br></br>  <br>See you next thread</br>  <br> bait image <br>It's like you're trying to prove how bad you are debate. Pretty much the only thing that could make you worse at this point is if you try to Godwin the situation.</br></br>  From Karen Arm Leg:<br> Karen is throwing a huge tantrum in the living room. She is lying on the floor and swinging her arms and legs violently. Because she has long arms and legs, she is destroying everything in the living room. Ararargi has just told her that he has a girlfriend, and Karen refuses to believe this fact. She claims that Araragi is hers alone and demands him to break up with Senjougahara immediately. She even offers to have sex with him if that's what he wants. Araragi is horrified at her completely unexpected reaction. Karen is also furious that when Araragi brushed her teeth, he already had a girlfriend. Finally, she demands to meet Senjougahara, and she claims she will brush Senjougahara's teeth in order to prove that Araragi is hers alone. <br><br>Yeah, they didn't fuck. I can't believe people actually believe Araragi fucked Karen. What is context?</br></br></br>    <br> still trying this hard <br>Just because they didn't fuck doesn't mean he didn't cheat. There is such a thing as emotional cheating. And that fits to the letter what Araragi does with every other female in the series.<br><br>Why do you care so much about some random harem series being shallow and pandering? It's obvious that to appeal to all of the fans of the series each girl is going to get her intimate moment with the MC (Araragi). It's just not the kind of series where you find strong relationships.</br></br></br></br>  Kemonozume. Get used to the Ping Pong art-style and you're in for one of the best shows from the early 2000s  <br>These two</br>  <br> emotional cheating <br><br>You're opening a can of worms.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey I wasn't even that guy. I was just trying to prove that Araragi and Karen didn't fuck.</br>  <br>Not really. It's a rather simple concept.<br>If he has feelings for other girls than he's cheating.<br>There's also physical cheating, which he also does. And that's being in sexually provocative situations with other females.<br><br><br> I wasn't even that guy <br>Pretty much proves you were.<br>But who said they fucked in the first place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If he has feelings for other girls than he's cheating. <br><br>So, if I see an attractive woman, and get a boner, am I cheating?<br><br>If it isn't cheating, what if I fuck another woman but have no romantic feelings for her?<br><br>If it is cheating, then what stops pronography from being cheating?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Does that Crab also cheated on him with Hanekawa?</br>  <br> So, if I see an attractive woman, and get a boner, am I cheating? <br>Physical reaction you can't control. Acting on it would be cheating.<br><br>The other two question are answered in the post you just quoted.<br><br><br>Yes. That would be physical cheating.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Pretty much proves you were. <br>It really doesn't but whatever dude.</br></br>  <br> Just because they didn't fuck doesn't mean he didn't cheat. There is such a thing as emotional cheating <br><br>I want tumblr to go.</br></br></br>    <br>It's the best family.</br>  <br><br>The best</br></br>  <br>this.</br>  <br> having common sense and know terminology means you are from tumblr <br>I want retards to go.</br></br>   http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/ne<wbr>ws/2015-07-08/berserk-manga-confirm<wbr>ed-to-resume-as-monthly-series-this<wbr>-month/.90187</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Where were you when Miura raised from the ashes?</br></br>  Yeah, can't wait for 3-4 chapters and then another hiatus  <br>you have to believe.</br>  <br> Where were you when Miura raised from the ashes? <br>Dead.</br></br>  <br> There are people who died while waiting for berserk <br>;-;</br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe this.</br>  <br>At the very least Guts will get out of that fucking boat, should be fun to see how he'll different he'll look at the end of his ride</br>  I'll draw anything Griffith x Casca related, so request!  Sorry, I'm not a drawfag but I tried  <br>How old is Guts?</br>  <br> I'm not a drawfag  <br>I can tell.</br></br>  <br>Look at it this way,when the actual drawfag isn't doing shit, you gotta man up and try.</br>  <br>Have this.  [Griffith hair is a little bitch/spoiler]<br><br> Implying I'd ever draw Griffith getting fucked by a man. <br>Miura already did it.</br></br></br> </br>  <br>You should make a doujin</br>  I want to read up on the series.<br>What sites did you guys use to read it?</br>  <br>Nig that's good, too bad your taste is shit</br>  <br><br>Thank you a lot. I don't care if I'm the only one in the world who takes them seriously, as long as I can drew them however I please I'm the happiest.</br></br>  <br>Damn, guts sure got handsome.</br>  <br>Caska shoving a sword through Griffith's midsection.</br>  To the drawfag who said he was going to draw us something. Here, take my request.<br><br>Can you draw Griffith getting fucked in the ass by Casca making the Guts face? Can you draw Puck coming out of her ass hole?<br><br>This is the guts face I was talking about</br></br></br></br>  Why can't I hold all these sacrifices?  <br>I already posted what I drew and I did it thinking about you.<br><br><br>Also, this anon already completed your request you sickfuck.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>That drawing is shit though</br>  <br><br>I requested Puck coming out of Casca's anus...</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be rude to the anon, but I can try to fix Casca's face in this drawing<br><br>. <br>I'm not touching Griffith though.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yeah griffith is fine, I just want to see Puck coming out of her asshole with like a cute face.</br>  <br> I don't want to be rude to the anon <br>Don't worry, I know it's shit</br></br>  <br>Meh, it doesn't look *that* bad.<br>Not bad enough for Guts to scream to Casca not to look.<br><br>I was expecting his face to be entirely deformed, his nose to be cut off completely, his skin to be mostly peeled off with huge infection bubbles and puss coming out of hit, his hair completely cut, his ears entirely removed only showing the inner entrance.<br>A complete destruction of his face except for his eyes.<br><br>That image just makes it look like the torturer simply peeled a bit of his skin. <br>Personally I don't understand why he didn't simply pluck both of his eyes but I guess they were needed for further suffering before the Eclipse. Griffith needs eyes to see how much he's lost.<br><br><br>Niiiice. I love it.<br><br><br> yaoi shit <br>Boring.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok! I'll work on it then.</br>  <br>Go fuck yourself name.</br>  <br> go fuck yourself <br>Shoving stuff in your anus is more in your department.</br></br>  I don't get new griffeth is he evil or not?<br><br>becuz on one had his crew is all apostles and he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land and built a utopia, <br><br>imo tbh guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons</br></br></br></br>  <br>grif is fag imho</br>  <br>I can't believe that's a real link.</br>    <br>The involvement of the entire God Hand during the creation of Falconia, and the fact that there is a huge fucking stadium full of monsters inside Falconia, seems pretty fucking ominous.</br>  <br>He's the same Griffith he always was. The only difference is as a member of the God Hand he's incapable of feeling remorse for his actions.</br>  <br> becuz <br> imo <br> tbh <br><br>Why?<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All Apostles are evil, stop being dense.<br><br> he has a division with just demons but on the other hand he did kill that muslim wizard could king and drove all of them from his land <br>They were invaders, that doesn't make him evil but it wall all according to keikaku so that the astral could be merged.<br><br> build a utopia <br>At the cost of making everywhere else toxic and inhabitable. Yeah, sure. The God Hand basically just caged the entire human race in a single location to be slaughtered. Truly a good person would do something like that.<br><br> guts is the bad guy here for wanting to kill him for personal reasons <br>How is killing for personal reasons bad if they are justified? Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning? <br>That reasoning is flawed and false.<br><br><br>Haha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it does but maybe the new society is for demons and humans to live 2gether? <br><br><br>I did get a lot fo homo vibes from him and he did get fugged by that one rich guy I think he's bi at least <br><br>new griff doesn't seem gay at all</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh? So wanting gay shit to be drawn, being attracted to a shota isn't gay and not in your department?<br><br>I'm pretty sure you're half way from fucking yourself already.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the god hand giraffe and new Griffith are seperate entities how can he be in two places at once?</br>  <br>i think he was legit gay back when he was younger, at least bi like you said, im pretty sure he wanted guts</br>  <br> Is killing Griffith going to stop Falconia from functioning?  <br> That reasoning is flawed and false. <br><br>it's not like it's some self automating system bruh you need a strong goverment to make sure it doesn't go to shit if guts does make his way back he will fuck up a lot of shit and ruins potentially everything</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't like things up my ass. I'm a top.</br>  <br>Falconia is a monarchy system.<br><br><br>Please, you're a little bitch and even Puck would be on top of you.</br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/8phqA2gkkRc  [ ]  <br>right and I'm pretty sure that system would go to shit if the king and most of his nights were killed imo</br>  <br>You need to brush up on your history. Griffith is not king. And even if he died, the bloodline still resides with Charlotte.<br><br>If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place.</br></br></br>  <br> If Griffith died, sure, there might be some riots but someone will eventually take his place. <br>He's migt not be king, but he's their leader and worshipped as a god. If he dies everything will go to shi.</br></br>  <br>guts will most likely kill charlotte too imo<br><br>plus like  said ppl worship griff as a god remember in real history when jesus died the spanish inquisition was the result</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off. Go punch your mother.<br><br><br>Is this put together well?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's important, sure, but you're overestimating how much shit would happpen if Griffith were to vanish. It wouldn't be that bad.<br><br><br> guts will most likely kill Charlotte <br>Maybe, we'll see. He has no real reason to kill her honestly.<br>I still predict that Griffith will consummate the marriage with her and  mind break her like he did with Casca. <br><br><br>You should go punch one of your two fathers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sat at home drinking brain fluid</br>  <br>If she's pregs with his child you can be sure guts will slay her</br>  <br>Griffith has no need of an heir.</br>  <br>He does, Guts gun kill him</br>  Griffith was so innocent pre eclipse. Guts leaving really fucked him up bad.  <br>this a pretty fucking awesome game with an amazing ost.</br>  <br>Yes and no. The voice acting for ishdoro or whatever is pretty annoying. It doesnt match him at all. Pretty sure they fucked up bot having Rickert on the Hill of Swords too. Gameplay seems really tight. It could use a remake to be honest.</br>  <br> innocent </br>  <br> so innocent <br>Not as much as you'd think he was.<br>He has his cute innocent side and his serious as fuck side.</br></br></br>  <br>is*</br>  <br> sold his ass virginity to fund his warband <br> innocent </br></br>  <br> You should go punch one of your two fathers. <br>That doesn't even make any sense. <br><br><br> Griffith was so innocent <br>So Guts should have just submitted and became his tool?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that Casca?  Kinda looks like me </br>  <br>I'm calling you gay, faggot.</br>  <br>yea telling guts to kill that old man who tried to kill him and his kid that was real innocent<br><br>also raping a child (princess Charlotte)</br></br></br>  <br><br>can you two fags leave the thread already?<br>everything was going so well with one cancerous tripfag gone, please don't ruin this</br></br></br>  <br>You can just ignore it.</br>  <br>No faggot, I didn't say that. It was good that Guts left and went onto pursue his dream. But in the end, it sort of was the reason why Griffith acted so weird and fucked Charlotte and got his ass tortured.</br>  <br>You look like an ugly mexican.<br><br><br>So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? No. I just like sweet b!p.<br><br><br>You must be new. How're the threads treating you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Tane should go fuck himself and fuck off.<br><br><br> So if I have two fathers, I'm gay? <br>It's a stereotype faglord, don't think too hard on it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You look like an ugly mexican. <br>I know that, I just said it.</br></br>  was that preacher bruh a apostle or did he turn apostle last min? tbh it was really confusing but he looked so fucking strange when I 1st saw him I was like dis nigga apostle for sure, but then he had that stupid excuse that he slams his face into the ground every day to give him that freaky ass blockface look and I don no what to think anymore  <br>It's hard for morons to ignore literally retarded random irrelevant shitposters and it's hard especially for the literal retards who suck their dicks.</br>  <br>I love how you think you're superior.

I'm having a blast.</br>    it's been awhile since we've seen Griffith's demon form.        <br> this will never ever happen </br>  <br>I- it's not over yet, /a/non.</br>  <br>but he got pussy bro</br>  <br>but he was just pretending tbk (to become king)</br>  <br>At this point and time, even this <br><br>is more likely to happen</br></br></br>  <br>please kill yourself</br>  <br> not pky <br>not as efficient tbh</br></br>  <br>But you aren't being efficient when you have to explain what your acronym right after using it.</br>   tfw you will never feel the same agony as Guts <br> tfw you will never feel the same hatred as Guts <br> The same, burning, pure, relentless hatred, driving you to completely disregard your own safety and sanity just so you can kill one man <br> The hatred that drove him to murder a monstrous father in front of his own daughter <br> The hatred that drove him to relentlessly try and kill a demonized young girl <br> The hatred to smite down a so called Hand of God and his disciples, all imbued with digusting, inhuman powers <br> The hatred to slaughter Troll Hellspawn that had been slaughter human villagers <br> The hatred that agreed to let a suit of cruelty push him to an inch of his life to decimate all in front of it <br> The hatred that propelled him to fight hordes of abominations  <br> The hatred that gave him the burning fury to jump inside an monstrous ocean God to stab its heart until it died <br> tfw you will never be as mad as Guts </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you will never go on adventures with Guts and find yourself </br>  <br>I'm just pretty upset, not that mad though.</br>  <br>Thank god.<br><br><br> not already having found yourself </br></br></br></br>  <br>edgy</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128103313 <br>How was I rude in that post? You're far to sensitive.</br>  What is with this thread?  <br> tfw you'll never have to endure a century long boat ride, and not even get to see Rickert bitch slap Griffag in person. </br>  <br>I'm kidding anon.</br>  <br> mfw people call me autistic </br>  <br>Because you are.<br>Nice face tbh</br></br>   yfw it ends with Guts killing Griffith, and everyone thinks Guts is the villian like they do every arc   <br> yfw guts kills griffith, everyone thinks he is the villain and they tie him up, taking turns stabbing him in the torso until he dies. </br>  <br>in b4 he dies after 1 chapter</br>  <br> Implying Guts would die </br>  <br> implying he can be tied up by some random human plebs </br>  If you found a Behelit or Crimson Behelit (and it was destined for you), would you use it?<br><br>I would probably use a regular one, but not a crimson one.</br></br>  <br>I know anon as am I. let's be friends.</br>  <br>No, I don't want to go to hell after I die</br>  <br><br><br><br>Where did you get these? These are all colored pages, and the coloring is fantastic.</br></br></br></br>  I'll sleep now, by guys....  <br>by man</br>  <br>Wrong "bye". Sleep well, faggot who can't spell.</br>  <br>I'm going to head off too. Good night.</br>  <br>Never realized how much of a reaction image goldmine berserk is.</br>  <br>this is the best picture i hava ever seen</br>  <br>It definitely is.</br>  <br>Want to watch Golden Age 2 with friends, just introduced them to Beserk and they loved Golden Age 1. Please tell me you guys have a link, I cant find them anywhere online, not even on nyaa</br>  <br>it's in youtube dude</br>  <br>bye tane!</br>  So let's be real here guys, what kind of asspull will be necessary to get a good ending for Guts?  <br>come on guy no ones reading this expecting a good end for him</br>  <br>Any chance I can get it someplace thats not Youtube?</br>  <br>Depends, can I sacrifice everyone at a Martin Luther King day parade? If so I don't even need a powerup, I'd just sacrifice all the niggers for free.</br>  Who wins? Serpico with his normal sword, or Griffith (right before he fucks princess Charlotte in Golden age arc)<br><br>Scenario one: Prep time/strategy allowed. No rules. See who the better strategist fighter is.<br><br>Scenario two: No prep time. Just see who the better swordsman is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My money would be on Serpico in both cases.<br><br>Griffith is a war strategist, Serpico is a one on one combat strategist.<br><br>Also, Guts annihilated Griffith in Golden age arc before he even went off to train for a year to improve drastically, without the dragon slayer in the flash of an eye. Serpico managed to cut Gut's face first fight, and match his speed for a bit second fight. That was after Guts was waaaaaaay stronger than when he fought Griffith and had a better sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nyaa or BakaBt I'd guess?</br>  <br>Serpico put up a much better fight than Griffith did against an even more powerful Guts. Can you imagine how shattered Griffith's pride would have been if he had known that there was not one but two swordsmen who could best him in fair combat?</br>  <br>When I realized this I was a bit disappointed.</br>  <br>Can you imagine him seducing Farnese just to fuck with Serp? He had to have picked up on his attraction, and Farnese used to be weak enough to cave to his Grif mojo.</br>  <br> Iwata </br>  <br>I think he's the false messiah type</br>  <br>Unf<br>Pre Sperg Casca is fucking top tier<br>Guts hammered that pussy<br> then he strangled her kek </br></br></br></br>  <br>A-Anon...why would you hurt me like this?</br>  <br>Just start from the beginning of the manga. Shit gets rolling after the first arc. You missed out of gay water fights.</br>  <br>I think Falconia will probably end up like skull king's empire/city, because casuality and stuff</br>  <br>I'd use the crimson one with minimal hesitation to be honest. Not even being an edgy cunt.</br>  <br>He is the real messiah, but Miura isn't a Christian and he finds the concept of messiah manipulative and evil.</br>  <br>Wtf, why would you be willing to use a regular Behelit but not Crimson?</br>  <br>Being a God Hand isn't that fun.</br>  <br>Theres actually a certain type of play in japanese culture thats very popular with the older crowd that depicts a White person (clothed, not race) is percieved as good because of the clean white appearence, when in fact he is purest evil, and does everything in his power to portrait the purest of good, who is clothed all in black as evil. Im pretty sure thats what Miura is doing with Guts and Griffith.</br>  <br>Because im not a cute girl like you</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>I doubt it. Guts is not a good guy. And Griffith clearly isn't just some evil monster who wants to kill people.</br>  <br> Griffith isnt just some monster who wants to kill people <br><br>Stop posting you heartless fuck<br>This meme is in poor taste</br></br></br></br>  <br>What meme? It's true.</br>  <br>He just wants to kill people that don't obey him.</br>  <br>Well think about the shit he's done. To humans, hes like a white angelic god. And thats just the surface. Deep down look at the shit thats happened because of him. Black at his core.<br><br>Now look at Guts. The Black Swordsman. Renegade. Killer. Criminal. And yet all the fucker does is try to get revenge for the shit Griffith did, save other humans while being a prick about it, or putting humans out of their misery from demonic possession, or they just got in his fucking way.<br><br>Pretty sure if everyone who hypes up Griffith, The Hawk of Light to commoners just ends every sentence with "and he sacrificed everyone he loved or cared for to hellspawn demon nightmares in a satanic ritual" no one would like him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really. He didn't kill Guts.</br>  <br>no.<br><br>griffith was cocky, serpico was well aware of the monster that Guts is.</br></br></br>  <br>If you actually read Berserk you would know he isnt Griffith anymore, hes Femto. There are no shreds of humanity left in him.<br>You clearly missed the part in the last chapter about "the hawks black talons"<br>Dont put so much weight in appearance, Griffith or Femto is a servant of pure evil.</br></br></br>  <br>spoken like a true scumbag</br>  <br>Griffith knew full well how powerful Guts had become. He watched him fight in many battles after all and even comments during his inner monologue that he's not sure he can beat him anymore.</br>  <br> hes like a white angelic god <br>He is their god. The Idea of Evil is the human god and Griffith is its agent. The white hawk is the symbol of their religion. <br> save other humans while being a prick about it <br>He doesn't care about saving anyone except people close to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any more of these? Where are they from</br>  <br> There are no shreds of humanity left in him <br>So? There is only his original dream and desire. Killing humans was never Griffith's dream.</br></br>  <br>shut up you</br>  <br> to achieve your dream you will need to pile up the corpses <br><br>OH yeah forgot about that kek</br></br></br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>What about fatslugs daughter? You see alot of her in this manga? The old mans daughter who turned into a zombie? He tried to save her, and ended up having to cleave the bitch in two as a mercy killing. He saves people when he feels like it.</br>  <br>Its got nothing to do with his dream anymore, he isnt the same person. He was decieved by the other godhand to make that sacrifice, now he serves The Idea. He babbles on about his dream but whos to say he even has free will anymore.<br><br>Hes still a weak backstabbing bitch that slaughtered his friends because he wanted to walk again.</br></br></br>  <br> decieved <br>Nope</br></br>    <br>What? He literally was..<br>The little floaty guy fed him that bull about having to pile up the bodies to reach the castle in the sky and Griffith thought it was his conscience. He was tricked. You really think they just give people god powers and get nothing out of it? They made him a Godhand so he could merge the worlds, and who knows whats next.<br>You really didnt read Berserk did you</br></br></br>  <br>pls no</br>  <br>Maybe if guts didnt try to rape her  ;_; </br>  <br>Why are my eyes leaking</br>   Get into figure collecting like a year ago <br> Missed Berserker Armor Guts Figma <br><br>Fucking hell, it's so expensive it hurts.</br></br></br>  <br> The little floaty guy <br><br>Ubik showed him the truth. All of what he told him was true. To hold on to his ludicrious dream, people would have to die, and die for him. Just because it's presented in a flashy way doesn't mean it's false. Think of The Count's arc. What did Ubik do? He showed The Count the truth. He showed Theresia the truth about her dad.<br><br>In the end, all apostles make the choice to commit evil willingly. Griffith was not the exception. There's a reason why their leader/master of ceremonies is represented by a big brain.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its not really tricking when the objective facts are put out in a convincing way. Griffiths actions lead to whole lot of dead people. His actions were for his goal/dream, so its not too much to say the mountain of corpses are there to help him get to his dream. The logic was pretty solid all in all. If he wasn't an invalid at that point in time I am sure he would have rejected it, but that is not how fate/causality works.</br>  <br><br>Anyone who says otherwise is full of shit. <br><br>Griffith fought beside Guts for years longer than Serpico has, yet Serpico found a way to challenge Guts on multiple occasions through strategic advantage. He also actually put up a semi-decent fight with Guts. If he used his slyph sword to make up for the fact that Guts was using an overpowered sword himself, the fight would be much more even. If he used his flying robe he probably could have stood a decent chance against Guts with Berserker armor on as well.</br></br></br></br>   Griffith fags <br> Everywhere </br>  <br> You really think they just give people god powers and get nothing out of it? <br>They say "Do as you will." Because the whole God Hand-Aposlte routine ultimately exists to create suffering to feed the Idea. <br><br>So however the apostles and GH act, despite being given instructions will increase the Idea's power. Example: Ganishka.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it was the truth <br><br>And that makes it the right thing to do does it?<br>Griffith would have achieved what he wanted if he hadnt gotten rekt by Guts and decided to penetrate the underage<br>Even after he summoned the God Hand he was hesitant, then Ubik (thanks forgot his name) gave him that flashback to the dream Griffith was always having but he twisted it.<br><br>I guess its a matter of different interpretations, whichever way you slice it what he did was wrong. So so wrong. If you have even a shred of sympathy for that dog after what he did then you arent human</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   People defending griffith <br><br>shit have we watched the same anime/manga, nigga is pure evil.</br></br>  <br> And that makes it the right thing to do does it? <br>What? No, of course not. <br><br>I was just saying that his actions are even more inexcusable because he acted knowingly. There was no twisting involved.<br><br>I'm just glad you're not a Griffith apologist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck no<br>I was just saying thats the way i interpreted it, i believe he was decieved because at the time he was desperate<br><br>Hes still a little shit and i cant wait for Guts to rape HIM next time<br>Oh man that would be glorious</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No one said it was the right thing to do, but it is the logical next step he had to take. Didnt help he was tortured for a whole fuckin year and wasn't exactly himself, but he was rescued and told everyone that rescued him to fuck off to hell. There was no twisting, it was harsh fucking daylight on his own actions. He was able to see all of the actually really shitty things he has done and he makes the decision to do some more. Griffith was never good, he had enough ability to rationalize the shit he did and relabel it. Its the same shit as freedom fighter/terrorist, point of view is a hell of a thing.</br></br>  <br> freedom fighter or terrorist <br><br>Holy shit anon I actually remember Miura saying in an interview that he was inspired by some terrorist events <br>It makes sense now</br></br></br></br>   monthly   <br> shiggy </br>      Why are most Berserk doujins either gay or loli?  <br>The first one is going to be 100 pages, the others probably the standard 40. This is how it should be. At least until it's on hiatus again by winter.</br>  <br>Because it already has plenty of hetero rape?</br>  <br> the face of a rapist </br>  <br> he isn't the same person <br>He is literally the Griffith's soul without his humanity. <br><br> to achieve your dream you will need to pile up the corpses <br>Yes, and he achieved his dream.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigger hes stipped of emotion<br>What else defines a person?<br>He isnt the same person</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he wants to kill humans for no reason. In its core it's still Griffith. Femto is Griffith's soul.</br>  <br>100+ it says. Could be 101, could be 600</br>  <br> implying hes going to let everyone in Falconia live happily ever after </br>  <br>why not?</br>  <br>This image is always so overdramatized. Like a girl would cry because a guy didnt talk to her. Bitch is insecure as shit.</br>  <br>BECAUSE HES A FREAKING DEMON DUDE JESUS<br> GRIFFITHFAGS </br></br>  <br>Do you have some sort of condition that renders you incapable of understanding humor?</br>  <br>It's just a recap anon, together with the new chapter.</br>  <br>So? I don't think you actually understand how the demons work in Berserk.</br>  <br>You clearly dont<br>Did you just skip the Eclipse or something?<br>Demons HATE humans, they feed on them for fuck sake<br>Doesnt it even seem slightly unusual to you that thise very same demons are now risking their lives for humans?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Demons are humans and not all of them hate normal humans. <br> Doesnt it even seem slightly unusual to you that thise very same demons are now risking their lives for humans? <br>No, it was explained.</br></br></br>  <br> this was explained <br>Orly<br>Enlighten me</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 33 or 34.</br>    <br>Ive read the manga roughly 5 times from beginning to end anon</br>   Caska gets her memory back. <br> Becomes despondent, emotionally unstable and hates Guts for not saving her/shaken and keeps remembering the eclipse. <br>OR<br> Guts decides to leave her as she is because she's happier this way. <br>Which one do you think is more likely?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read it again.</br>  <br>Its not explained youre just trying to discredit me<br><br>The fact is we dont know for sure what his intentions are. But its extremely unlikely Griffith and the Apostles are suddenly good guys now. Since they live off suffering, and the literally sold their souls to evil.<br><br>So fuck you nigger im out PEACE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does "good guys" mean? <br> they live off suffering <br>They don't. <br> and the literally sold their souls to evil <br>Which in Berserk world is basically human selfish desires.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guts for not saving her <br>But he tried so hard. He cut off his own arm just to get a chance at rescuing her.</br></br>   they finally get to elfhelm and see the king <br> they have to kill some crazy elf demon god monster so the king will fix Casca <br> they do it but guts is bed ridden again so elf king fixing Casca <br> it's like skull knight said maybe she didn't want to get fixed <br> as Casca tries to kill herself her shadow babeh tries to stop her so Casca kills her kid then herself <br> guts finds near death Casca she says she hates him for fixing her  <br> he goes berserk and destroys half of elfhelm before loliwitch can stop him <br> elf king banishes his party off the island knowing that he couldn't do shit to guts <br> what a horrible night to have a cruise </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not all of them. I think it's implied higher class ones like Zodd can control themselves better, like when he refused to partake in "indulgence" when the eclipse was happening and just waited outside. Most of the knights of the apocalypse seem to have at least somewhat bit of honor. The weaker more useless ones are the ones who just want to eat humans, and they get fucked up by greater apostles for it.</br>  <br>What are you even trying to say now? What the fuck do you think i mean you actual mongoloid<br><br>Youre trying to tell me that Griffith has his kingdom, so the fact that he is a rape hungry soulless monster that can squash matter with his mind is completely void now. Hes a good guy, even though he is a servant to the idea of evil. Even though he slaughtered his followers and has shown his demonic side time and time again.<br><br>How will Berserk end then? Griffith having his happy tea parties in Falconia while Guts is fucking around with the little shota elves on that island?<br><br>Pls anon PLS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So im on ch 280. Does this kushan emperor really stand a chance against griffith/femto?  <br>Calm down m8 the chapters coming</br>  <br>Why dont you keep reading and find out?<br>Dont ask /a/ anything unless you want huge spoilers out the ass</br></br>   implying he's back   Fucking hell I have trouble believing griffith is a man. Hes so fucking pretty. I dont know if I wanna bone him or if I wanna let him bone me. Its maddening. No wonder griffith fags exist.  <br>Triple dubs confirm.</br>  <br>Cmon, you know how this is gonna go down.<br><br> Caska regains her memories <br> Denies and pretends it was a dream <br> Sees Guts; Tired, Worn, Ageing <br> 2-3 chapter panic, everyone trying to console her <br> Farnese says some shit like "you dont even know how lucky you are, me luv him long time" <br> She heads back and looks at him again <br> All the scars, the ageing, the armor <br> in her mind, she'll think it was all for her <br> She'll cry, they'll kiss, she gets left on Safety Island or joins the new Black Order or whatever you wanna call Guts ragtag group. <br><br><br> Rickert either gets murdered, has to watch Godo's daughter get rape-murdered, or they join the Black Order. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck /a/. Griffith is like the fucking lord of prep time. First he pulls out the queen, then the pope. It almost writes itself.  <br> Ella getting raped <br><br>But she'll be doing the raping this time. Lolis are notorious sexual predators.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah yes the infamous mololisters</br>  <br>Remember that a vote for Casca is a vote against 70 gigs and tripfags.</br>  <br>Maximum autism.</br>  <br>Gennon pls.</br>  <br> Implying he wasnt one lucky fuck </br>   you will never yell orders at your naked brown waifu <br><br>why live</br></br>  <br> filthy frank </br>  <br> not using a Dark Horse scan <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  Why the fuck does capn hook even exist? Will they even get off the damned boat? You know how it is with miura.  <br>done the of the drawing rest for you</br>  <br>I think we should be carefully optimistic about getting off the boat now that we get it monthly. <br>I mean I know I wont live to see the end but I think I now have a chance to get off the boat.</br></br>  Why is there so little porn of something so popular with so much fap fuel? <br><br>Alternatively, how much would it take to get Miura to just draw porn?</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what I'm looking at, is this Black Swordswoman Casca giving Griffith karmic revenge?</br>    <br>Its casca winking at Guts after getting her memories back and running to her true love.</br>  <br><br>In case you needed more convincing<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Theres already alot of sex though thats pretty explicit.</br>  <br>So what is this saying?<br>Everyone in Falconia is going to sacrificed for nothing?</br></br>  <br>I don't see the difference.</br>  <br>Holy fuck I need these cards<br><br>I cant find shit online they must be really fucking rare<br><br>I NEED IT<br>I THOUGHT I OWNED EVERYTHING BERSERK RELATED</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wtf..... he actively allowed EVERYONE in the band of the hawk to be sacrificed so that he could become femto. meaning GUTS included. i think you are missing the entire point of the eclipse and how it pertains to where guts is now.</br>  Why do I have this strong feeling that puck was the elf king all along and hes just pretending to be some random asshole for reasons?  <br>Man that's a sexy jaw<br><br>Why does Guts have Batman's jaw?</br></br></br>  <br> dark knight <br>Guts is Batman.</br></br>  Reminder that somehow Griffith is going to get tricked during a ceremony where he summons spirits and instead of bringing comforting shades to his subjects, it's going to be the ghosts of the sacrificed Band of the Hawk. And that'll be the real beginning of the end for Falconia.  <br> Puck could have cured Casca all along <br> likes being inside her mouth too much to do that </br></br>  What do you guys think of this scenario?<br><br> Elf magic un-potatoes Casca <br> News of Griffith's kingdom reaches the party and, like Rickert, they want to see Griffith <br> Travel ensues, adventures are had, Guts gets stronger, Falconia is reached <br> Griffith reached, nice chat ensues until Griffith decides he has business to finish and sacrifices to collect. <br> Griffith v Guts, it's close but   Guts loses, Griffith sacrifices Casca and then Guts sacrifices Griffith  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It won't be happening. If Guts gets any stronger than he is now he could destroy Griffith.</br>  <br>He  isn't yet .</br>   With each arc guts looks more and more miserable, agonized and pained <br> He also gets new scars and is aging fast <br><br>Fucking shit he'll look like hes 80 by the time the manga ends.<br><br> If it ends. </br></br></br></br></br>  Where were you when Rickert fucking called it?  <br>He's definitely strong, but probably not Skull Knight strong, and Griffith is pretty much deity level. There's some gap there where Guts overcomes one or more of the armor's massive drawbacks before he's ready.</br>  Until the next idolm@ster comes out.  <br> Implying hes isnt taking it like a joke because he is THE elf king </br>  <br>He's going to turn into Blacksmith-Senpai</br>  I just reached chapter 144 after two long nights of reading.<br><br>Does the ride keep going?</br></br>  <br>shiiiiieeeet nigga</br>   How will Griffith/Femto end? <br>The "Black Swordsman" arc has just begun. The axis will be, obviously, the story in which Guts' feud with the God Hand, who Griffith/Femto belongs to, will be brought to a close. Let's think about the development leading to the finale.<br>First of all, what is the goal of the God Hand now that it's composed of 5 members? It is naturally expected that if Guts can't find it out, he won't even be able to confront them. Before that, is the God Hand complete with the addition of Femto?<br>"Hmm, for now the God Hand is supposed to be complete with Femto. I'm sorry but now is not a good time, as expected, to reveal their goal... Instead, I'll give you one hint. The keyword is "Void". You can imagine many things based on it." said Miura.<br><br><br> Void confirmed for final boss of the series </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Griffith is the antechrist</br>  <br>But skull knight is the one destined to destroy voids asshole.</br>  <br>I just can't see any member of the Godhand being defeated through physical means, no matter how powerful the opponent is. I don't think Guts will be able to win like that and will be forced to settle with a stalemate of sorts where Griffith and the others are thwarted (but not destroyed) and Caska is more or less recovered. It would bring resolution to the story without being retarded.</br>  <br>What if  the Idea needs another hand </br>  <br>Where did that quote come from?</br>  <br> Idea of Evil confirmed for final boss of the series <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> mangareader <br>You disgust me.</br></br>  How powerful would ganishka, the kushan emperor, be if he had his end beast powers to his full control?  <br>Exactly as powerful as shown, which was nigh unstoppably so.</br>  <br>Godo is best old wise man character</br>  <br>I prefer to look at it as him being determined, not quite as enraged as you make him sound.</br>  <br>He may be old but he isn't the wisest.</br>  Does Caska ever get her memories back? I'm currently reading the manga and I can't stand how much of a fucking retard she is.  <br>FUCK you m8.</br>  <br> likes a ruined character </br>  <br>What I mean is that Casca is retarded now for 22 years. He doesn't know our pain. <br><br>I'm glad I'm a westerner who is waiting for her to get better for JUST 10 years now.</br></br></br>  <br>Has her condition been healed yet?</br>  <br>Summer brings the attention seeking newfags in</br>  <br>No. <br>We only got a hint that she is probably going to hate it when it happens.</br></br>  I'm at Volume 12 and I'm scared at what's gonna happen.  <br> chapter 12 <br>I envy you.<br>Although I can't really believe what happens next was never spoiled to you.</br></br></br>  <br>**Volume</br>  <br>I heard of it but its my first time reading berserk.</br>  <br>Then GTFO the thread and read it before someone spoils it for you.</br>  What is the best way to buy Berserk in English?  <br>But Rickert slapping Griffith was a better end than anywhere he's gonna leave Guts on the ocean.</br>  One thing I like really is that Guts is still young enough to not have his personality changes feel forced for the sake of plot.   gigantosumthing <br>Christ I completely forgot Miura dumped Berserk to draw this thing no once cared about.</br>  I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was an outside force guiding Guts through his life similar to the Idea of evil.  <br>Causality, ain't gotta explain shit.</br>  <br>Guts should've submitted himself to Griffith. It would've been for the best</br>  So what does Skully actually DO?  <br>say deep stuff that doesn't make any sense</br>  <br>I mean on his non-plot-device days.</br>  <br>He ruled an empire or some shit.</br>  <br>He is flying on his magic skelehorse and kills apostles to collect their behelits. At least thats what he was doing before griffith shenaningans with falconia</br>  <br>Yeah it seems likely that he is Gaiseric and Void was the advisor/gay lover he locked up.<br>Hope we get a bit more exposition on that, on a reread right now and I don't think anybody who meets him (except Guts) ever knows enough to have a hunch about who he really is.</br></br>  <br><br> implying Retard Caska doesn't also put him up her cooch  <br> implying he doesn't enjoy being in a woman's softest, comfiest place more than her mouth which has teeth </br></br></br>  <br><br>This is actually a good point, if there is an Idea of Evil there must also be an Idea of Goodness. However, it would somewhat hurt the narrative that Guts is just a tenacious, hard-as-nails dude put into the worst possible circumstances trying to make his way in the world.</br></br>  <br> ywn live inside Casca's safe </br>  <br> Spas Cas sticks him up there <br> she gets Femto Eclipse flashbacks <br><br>Trips and she enjoyed it.</br></br></br></br>  I think what's going to happen with Caska getting her memories back will be something along the lines of the grief and trauma being too severe for her to handle, so she attempts to kill herself, only for Puck of all people to be the one who manages to convince her not to do it, because he's come to know Guts and how he feels about her and how desperately he needs her.  So is Caska going to remain an autist? Why would she hate to go back to normal?  <br>She will certainly go back to normal some time in the far far future, the problem is what happens afterwards.</br>  <br>Remembering the incident that ended with all her friends getting killed, her lover being horribly maimed and her getting brutally raped might have something to do with it. Not many people have Guts' ability to put up with shit, and taking a look at the world now, it's strange that more people aren't simply retreating into their shell like Casca is.<br><br>How many times has she attempted to kill herself already, anyway? Elf Island is paradise, she might wander around for a couple of chapters and meet the rest of Guts' pals before making a decision, and it's not like nobody can restrain her if she tries to top herself.</br></br></br>  Why doesn't Guts grow facial hair? He's got testosterone oozing out his pores, doesn't he?  <br>He's Japanese.</br>  <br><br>Not everyone can grow good facial hair, that's just genetics. <br><br>That or he shaves regularly, which is likely since he served as a soldier.</br></br></br></br>  I want Griffith to get the worst death possible.  <br>He probably just shaves when he finds time. I mean you don't see his hair grow too much either.</br>  <br> 3-4 chapters and then another hiatus <br><br>Hiatus 5 year long.</br></br></br>  <br>His design looks much better without a beard.</br>  <br>You need to learn basic pattern recognition.</br>  <br>He obviously cuts his hair regularly so he probably shaves as well.<br>And if you don't have shaving foam its also more important to shave more often which would explain why he doesn't show any stubble.<br><br>And there is also the genetics side of things.<br>I met a guy in boot who was 20 years old and did not have a single hair on his lower face. No Asian or African genes, pure north Europe and Scandinavian ancestry.<br> mfw I had to do a silky smooth shave everyday to avoid re-inspection </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Opinions</br>  <br>is that fucking filthy frank?</br>  <br>Give him a handlebar mustache with mutton chops.</br>  <br><br> newfags cannot recognize Miura without making comparisons to Frank-san </br></br>   Read golden age <br> Pic related <br><br>GRIFIIIIIIIIIIIIITH</br></br></br>  <br>Griffith a cute.</br>  <br>I'm gonna laugh when Guts and Griffith both die in the last chapter.</br>  <br>I think you'll actually be pretty sad.</br>  I'm hyped  <br>Giffithfags are comparable to cucks. They'd let their whole family be slaughtered and still pledge loyalty to the white  falcon </br>  Is Guts edgy?  <br>He's still going to be ugly anyway. These are reminders that Mihawk is the strongest swordsman in the world and he's the most handsome man in the world. Guts is a weak swordsman and he's ugly. Only retarded butthurt homosexuals would say otherwise. Everything I said are facts.</br>  <br>Nice buzzwords, moeshitter.</br>  <br>What are those things on the plate in that poster?</br>  <br> image.jpg <br><br>every time</br></br></br>  <br>Guts during the Black Swordsman Arc was edgy but you have to consider that was just after the eclipse happened.</br>  <br>so I'm reading all that for fucking nothing?<br><br>shit</br></br></br>  <br>It feels like Miura toned him down a little once we get back to the present at the start of the Conviction arc.<br>He's still a bit edgy but not in such an aggressive way. And wasn't the start of BS about two years after the Eclipse?</br></br>  <br>I think he is around 25-30 at this point.</br>  <br>Is this a joke? Your moe crew cannot take JOJO/Berserk/your least favourite anime away from /a/, Nagi.</br>  <br>Does this image trigger you?</br>  <br>You know, I never realized what he meant by adult attack until I reread this whole chapter.  I'm retarded </br>  <br>And even Rosine wants Guts' dick.</br>  <br>Why are you in every berserk thread with trash posts like this? Find something better to do.<br><br>Inb4 you reply with another ebin image calling me a moron, get laid you loser.</br></br></br>    <br>Is.. this real..?<br>Im in tears right now..</br></br>  <br>Can I report obvious bait posts like these or does /a/ work differently than the rest of this site?</br>  <br>I'm just on a casual reread here and there's no end to the amount of ass Guts' mere presence attracts.</br>  <br>It's hard to believe people are taking this seriously. Good lord the motherfuckers in these threads are dense. He clearly knows enough about Erika and Godo's backstory to be aware of this page. From there you can infer that he's just fucking with you.<br><br>If I started saying I was literally Zeus I bet you would earnestly argue with me about it.</br></br></br>  <br>He also runs into more than his fair share of little girls.</br>  <br>Yeah. They lived in a time before CPS. These things happen.</br>  <br>He shaves his face with his dagger, just like his dad taught him.</br>  <br>Anyone who has ever shaved with a knife knows how much this shit hurts.</br>  I've always wondered what Zodd really is.<br>Skully claimed he was some sort of Gatekeeper/guardian at the Eclipse and here he talks about the Apostles like they're a seperate type of creature from himself.</br>  <br> Miura's Lustful Little Lolis. <br>He really does like them young.</br></br>  <br>I did that once and cut out half of my cheek.</br>  <br>Perhaps these are two paths Guts might take. Getting consumed literally by the berserker armor and becoming skully v2 or making a sacrifice and becoming an eternally wandering warrior</br>  <br>All the other apostles have much more abstarct designs but Zodd looks like something out medieval mythology.</br>  <br><br>I've always seen Forces as a theme song of sorts for Berserk. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yhx<wbr>8yVvmM5k&amp;list=PL9146BDACDA5C450A&amp;in<wbr>dex=9</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But Guts theme has always been my favorite Berserk song.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dIo<wbr>ILN_KrhU&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL9146BDACDA5<wbr>C450A</wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Future developments:<br><br>Guts kills at least one party member in armor-fueled rage;<br><br>Casca regains her senses;<br><br>Rickert dies;<br><br>Femto kills at least one rebellious apostle;<br><br>Elven island gets invaded<br><br>Agreed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You are a couple of clumsy fucks ain't ya?</br></br>  <br>You have no idea how sharp a blade has to be to cut hair comfortably.<br><br>It isn't cutting yourself that is the problem.

We all shit on Nodoka, me included, but imagine how it would feel to be constantly berated and defined by the size of your boobs all your life.<br>Especially for a teenage girl growing up, that would give you some sort of complex. <br>Nodoka had a hard life.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Turns out she's super-pettanko.<br><br><br><br>Shut up you wimpy city kid.<br><br>Quit your whining.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything will be fine.

That's not very nice.<br>Looking back, I guess it doesn't really make sense for it to be from Saki's POV again.</br></br>  <br>Who is this remarkably cute creature?</br>  I THINK IT ACTUALLY IS LEAK TIME<br>THIS IS NOT A DRILL<br>THIS IS NOT A DRILL</br></br>  <br>Real life come calling.</br>  <br>Saki says that Nelly's kan is nothing compared to Maho's.</br>    This is also new right?  <br>Who's this girl behind Sawaya</br>  <br>The virgin Mary.</br>    <br> Making Saki-san cry <br>OVER THE LINE, RITZ.</br></br>  <br>Saki-san is cute even when she cries.</br>  <br>Damn making sakisan that cute should be a warcrime.<br><br>Stop trying to trick us Ritz.<br><br><br>Damn that some fancy school.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Damn that some fancy school. <br>I wonder what she used for reference.</br></br>  <br> crying saki <br>I want to make her cry more</br></br>    <br>Sasuga ritz</br>  Kawaii Awaii is looking cheeky  <br>That's not new.</br>  Thread reminder Ritz is a fucking hack and should stop.  HYPE<br><br> jk with the usual snail pace nothing much gonna happened anyway </br></br>  Alright I'm going to bed. Can some other kind anon hunt for leaks and keep the thread alive?  <br>Do you have a problem with boobs?</br>      Leaks till now:<br>Saki and Kyouko crying.<br>Nelly smugs.<br>Sawaya hopes she won't get buttobi'd.</br></br></br>   mfw Nelly bust everyone except Saki who ends with 100 points   Dead fanbase.  <br><br>Please, 100 points isn't +-0.</br></br>  <br>Saki shouldn't complain, she did beat Momo by copying Nodocchi's digital style (in the anime individuals).</br>  <br>You are now aware that  even Maho got a bigger bust. <br><br>EXPLOITABLE</br></br></br>   leaks out no one cares <br><br>Looks about right.<br><br>And I see nothing happen as usual.</br></br></br></br>    <br>they are fast</br>  I just want to bully Saki-san and then console her.  It's Oppai's birthday.  <br> after eating this <br><br>So, never.</br></br></br>  <br>Well done, you figured out it was just an excuse.</br>  <br>The sun in the upper right picture looks like Sakasan's head. Spooky.</br>   Then   <br> Now <br><br>What the hell happened?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where did it go so  right ?</br></br>    <br/>  <br>It's like her chest is pregnant.</br>  <br>Time to do our part.</br>  We got boobs for dinner.  <br>Itatokimasu.</br>  What are you real life people waiting for?  <br>The end, Maho. The end of it all.</br>    Captcha: Select all images with steak  Daytime.  <br>Night-time.</br>  <br><br><br>Interesting.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Is this how you get good at mahjong?</br></br>  <br>Sure, why not.</br>  this could work  <br>If you can handle breasts you can handle Mahjong tiles.</br>  <br>Don't forget this important principle.</br>  <br><br>She works great with all the charatcers.</br></br>  One day her spine will snap in half.<br><br>One day.</br></br>  It's Obon. Time to visit Toki's grave.   saki-san crying <br><br>this is going too far.</br></br>  <br>We will water the heavens with Saki's tears.</br>  <br>Thanks for that.<br>Shame there don't seem to be any other subs available than this site's.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, she will try not to cry since oneechan is watching. <br><br>Flashback<br><br>"Another useless kan? Back to the basics, Saki."<br><br>"Yes, mother."<br><br>And then she will use THAT. Before Teru.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not if I support her tits.</br></br>  <br>Nah, she has a personal assistant.</br>  <br><br>Well, that explains why her growth is so stunted.<br><br>But what's with the obsession with Honors tiles?</br></br></br></br>  <br>pssst, Toki is... sleeping.</br>  <br>I want to sleep with Toki!</br>  <br><br>It's not as fun as it would seem.</br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD</br>  <br><br>But of course. Just look at all the shading Ritz has done just on her alone, nevermind the scenes with her.</br></br>  <br>But Shinohayu is about Saki's sister.</br>    <br>Don't you know that Shino is Saki's sister?</br>  <br><br>Massive Mahjong Mammaries.</br></br>  <br><br>Not this shit again.</br></br>  <br><br>I held off fapping to her yesterday/today. It took a monumental effort on my part, but willpower and video games pulled me through.</br></br>  <br><br>Not far off, actually, since they contain all those&lt;nodoka&gt;*cough*SOA*cough*</br></br>  <br><br>Singularity, Invasion, and/or exodus from this doomed blue marble. Pluto looked like it could work, if you could somehow bring enough tech to overcome the lack of pretty much any energy sources. It's far enough from all the noise down here at any rate.</br></br>  <br><br>Can mahjong lesbians have sex in space?</br></br>  <br><br>According to Mairu, it helps to strap yourselves in.</br></br>  <br><br>The tiles will need to be magnetized on a magnetizable table, or the other way around.<br><br>Sticks too, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but not while playing mahjong.<br>The tiles fly all over the place.</br></br>  <br>With magnetic tiles, you'd have problems with them either sticking together or flying apart. Poles attracting and repelling etc.; dora indicator flip would be tricky.<br>With a magnetic table and metal tiles, you'd have problems building the wall. It would be hard to make the table strong enough to hold the top row, but weak enough to release the bottom row.</br></br>  <br>They'll probably invent simulated gravity before we're far enough along to have lesbians playing mahjong in space.</br>  <br>I love turkey</br>   game today with friends <br> win one round for 2000 <br> lose one round for 2900 <br> don't play into any hands for the rest of the game <br> end with 13000 points <br>Fuck this game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like it'd be easiest to make something like a slotted table where you just latch in the tiles rather than magnets. Of course, the walls would look kind of ugly(basically a non-revealed version of Nodoka's experiment with the walls) but it would work in space.<br><br>It's not pure, but it's possible.</br></br></br>  <br> implying not playing into hands is an accomplishment <br>Winning is for winners, kid</br></br>  <br>Nodoka did an experiment with the walls? When was that?</br>  <br>My luck is too terrible to actually finish hands.</br>  Is this a leak or old?  <br>Translation- I suck at mahjong<br>At least you're good at blogging.<br><br><br>Seems new but isn't it a little too early for that sort of flashback?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> my luck is too terrible <br>This isn't dice, this is mahjong. There's a lot more to it than just getting lucky. If you almost never win it's because you're bad.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 4; Nodoka playing 1P to see if she could score +/-0 like Saki.</br>    this is mahjong. There's a lot more to it than just getting lucky. <br>Right.</br>  <br>Oh I thought it would be something like Nodoka playing against Saki with the wall revealed to see what happens, but that would probably be illegal in the saki universe.</br>  <br><br>The only thing you have nearly 100% control over and is skill based is your defense, hence why I barely ever deal in.<br>Not matter how well you develop your hand, if the right tiles aren't drawn/discarded then you're literally out of luck.</br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for not knowing shit.<br>There is literally no luck involved in mahjong. Anyone who disagrees is clearly not even past the beginner skill level.</br></br>  If luck is a factor in mahjong then how does Teru win all the time?<br>Checkmate SOAtheists</br>  <br>A winner makes their own luck. Champions are opportunistic.</br>  <br> There is literally no luck involved in mahjong. <br>Nigga please.<br>I even heard a story from the members our the official mahjong club, whore ended up placing rather highly in a recent tournament because of a single yakuman, despite sucking in all of her other games.<br><br> But yeah, playing devils advocate is fun. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*where she<br>Fuck, time to sleep.</br></br>  <br> whore <br>Do you have to be so rude to Shino's mother?</br></br>  <br>What the hell IS Mihoko's power? Does it give some sort of approximate overview of the table? In games it tells you how much of each color a player has in their hands etc but is that really what it does in manga-canon?</br>  <br>It's one of those vague "sense the flow" powers that tells us nothing about it.</br>  <br>She uses her magical eyeball to notice how people organize their hand and discard to guess what sort of yaku they have.</br>  <br>It's like a tell finder, think Akado but without the electronic equipment</br>  <br> What the hell IS Mihoko's power? <br>The power to make me want her to suck me off.</br></br>  Why do japs love Chikako so much?  <br>blonde fetish</br>  <br>Do they? How so?<br><br>Because she's obviously the best waifubait in the series. I want to have 9 kids with her in a giant christian household.</br></br></br>  <br>Deep in their hearts they long for Christians to show them the way. They long to know the Gospel. The desire is in the heart of every human, but sometimes it takes a catalyst in the form of an anime girl to awaken in.</br>  <br>They always post her and seem to think she's yandere for Sawaya.</br>  <br>I hope Uzusan can free Nodoka from the demons that are holding her.</br>  <br><br>that looks like young Saki hair, but slightly older.<br><br><br>She has sight beyond sight.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always see Yuan and Sawaya. I dont think there are any good usuzan lesbianisms. They could just be  heterosexual   friends .<br><br>I mean, they are bad at mahjong and all.</br></br></br>  <br>This man has the right ideas. Chikako is best when you are trying to sneak into the bathroom while she's doing something and ruining her purity before marriage but still being devoted to her anyway.</br>  I want to be Chikako's senpai.  <br> 誰かのために <br>For someone's sake<br> ...の夢.. <br>dream..<br> あきらめ <br>give up..<br>Sounds like serious business.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a shop from a while back.</br>  <br>Ritz cured Maho's anorexia.</br>    <br><br>Well, you see, besides nasty hobbits, and giant freaks, there are these things called real people.</br></br>  <br>Real people?</br>  <br><br>You don't know about real people either?</br></br>  <br>I was thinking today about what a shame that all of the Saki characters spend all of their time on mahjong when they could be studying in school to cure cancer, eliminate pollution, create world peace, etc.<br>Then I remembered that Saki isn't real, and the shame is actually on all of us.</br></br>  <br> saki isn't real <br>How about you shut your fucking mouth, cunt?</br></br>  Previous thread: <br><br>ISHUHUI'S OUT EARLY.
