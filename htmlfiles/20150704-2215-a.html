[   <br><br>wise words...</br></br>  Do you like seeing straight girls get raped by lesbians in anime/manga?  <br>bawwwwwww</br>  <br>No. I like seeing lesbians get raped by black men.</br>  <br>This man is the devil.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>What chapter is this? Batoto isn't this caught up, are they?</br></br>   you will never have a bro who sticks to you 24/7.   <br>His specialty is pleb food.</br>  Poor jobbertits.  <br>amusing yes, funny no</br>  <br> mary sue bitch <br>Anon she trained like the rest of them ,she's not on the top of the E10 either, i dunno where you got your facts but it's a load of bullshit. You better eat it all before it spreads</br></br>  <br>Hisako is bae</br>  Let's all come together and love Lain.  Sorry it's taking me forever to actually do anything.  <br>As long as thread lives on it's fine</br>  <br>Already love her.</br>  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO<wbr>1d6AgSF99Xn5jPJlM38Lg<br><br>Starting upload of videos/sounds. Videos first. Going to pair sound files where I think they fit, mostly for things like the layers.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Thanks for this, anon</br>   90 minutes <br><br>sakurafag status: RUINED</br></br>  <br>Video games can never be art.</br>  <br><br>Sounds like poor direction more than anything else. Whichever anon brought that up sounds like he's on the mark.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter what his physical strength is.<br><br>He fights with the weapon he chooses to project as if he were the original wielder of it and that's where his power comes from.</br></br></br>  <br>It was somewhat faithful.<br>The changes are minor but they do add up. Small changes in dialogue and character interaction, original scenes that either don't add anything or just makes the characterization confusing...<br><br>In my opinion Caster is by far the worst offender in this. They waste half an episode with a flashback about her original Master, the way she deals with him contradicts the source material, and it's not only completely unecessary, it's cheap as fuck trying to create empathy for Caser. The novel does so by briefly talking about her past, her life. The anime ignores it for some fanfic about a sandnigger asshole mage, for some reason.<br><br>I see a lot of people complaining about how Rin was portrayed but, honestly, I didn't have many problems with it. <br>Shirou loses depth and charisma (not that he has that much of either to begin with, but still) but that's expected, almost no anime keep the protagonist's inner monologues.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tons of unnecessary changes that created all sorts of issues from plotholes <br>Name 3 plotholes, smartass.<br><br> They destroyed the Ilya death scene by dragging it out multiple episodes <br>Did you actually watch the episode? Illya dies in the same episode the battle against Berserker is concluded.<br><br> The Kuzuki and Caster arc is drawn way the fuck out and goes at an absolute snail's pace <br>Subjective opinion, keep it to yourself.<br><br> The thing everyone seems to get the most mad about is the back to back scene with Shirou and Rin <br>No one has complained about that in ages. It was just shitposters trying to bait people in the first week after the episode. <br>Also, relying on /a/ to determine "everyone"'s reaction is fucking retarded. Don't bring that shit into an argument.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What did /a/ think of the first episode?  <br> COLT DE FUCKING IVORY </br>  very slow thread. nobody cares with this show huh  <br> BENIN </br>  <br>pretty decent, not a great first episode but seems good enough to follow the 3 ep rule... though I have the feelings is going to be another shitty A/Z</br>   InahoHime daughter and black haired L-elf <br>not sure if want</br>  It's the age of smartphones and mobage and high speed mobile internet, shouldn't Obama be President of the United States by now?  <br> 'murica <br> white president <br>Pick one &amp; only one.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but the manga just finished book 2 of 5<br>So about 40% through the season 1</br></br>  <br>about 2/5 I suppose(aside from the special).</br>  <br>It's just the way they are. Maybe it has something to do with having a small dick, i don't know. That would explain why they're getting cucked by the negros every day.</br>  <br> the people don't vote for their PM like they do a president, <br> implying murridumbs do </br></br>  Who wins this one?<br><br>Feel free to make your own.</br></br>  &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/    <br>I also recommend downloading GIMP, it takes some time to get used to but works as a free photoshop</br>  <br>So many good characters.</br>  <br>Come on, anon. You need to relax and have fun once in awhile.<br><br>I'd love to get Assassin or Archer just because of their characters, but I might have to go with Caster here if I want the best chance of winning.</br></br></br>   ctrl + f "tokyo ghoul" <br> 0 results <br>What the fuck you niggas, it's almost spoiler time, let's speak about Sharkboy being confirmed to die soon.

Her lovely tail flapping away happily as I ravaged what little brain it had. God I loved that cow.</br></br>  <br>I had a cute petite GF in high school that was tsundere. She would pretend to dissuade me sometimes even from just being friends but I pressed on and it became more and more obvious that she was being coy. The oddest thing happened; her friend came to tell me that she really liked me and said she was too shy to tell me herself. After that I sat with her in art class and told her all the fun we could have if we went on dates which she kept turning down. She didn't feel annoyed, but when I did it amused her a lot. She would flash her skirt up at me sometimes and show me her belly piercing just to call me a perv when I approved. She moved after finishing high school and I never saw her again. Really sad as that was my last time likeing a 3D girl, which was 10 years ago.</br>  <br>How is Illya so sexy that even her reaction images give me the fastest insta-boner?</br>   no America on mars <br>I'm assuming they are on better planets in the solar system or got eliminated.<br>Who bankrolls students with billions?<br>I better stop thinking about this shit or my head will implode.</br></br></br>  <br> i will at least try to improve myself. <br>You shouldn't be here if you're really trying that</br></br>  <br>But the 米 in 米国 is stands for 亜米利加, a-me-ri-ka</br>  <br> the Nips place themselves near the middle <br> on the closed 2d surface of a sphere <br><br>american education right here</br></br></br></br>  <br> ukraine stil exist </br>  <br>And biggest wars.<br>Every slavic country hate eachother</br></br>  How do you like your lolis?
