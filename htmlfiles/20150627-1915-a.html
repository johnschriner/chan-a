[ Why are actual harem ends so rare in anime?   watched it for Ninetails bro and the Meganekko    Fix? You mean fuck it up right?    They usually don't adapt all of the material. Take Gj Bu for example. The light novel ended with Kyolo having a true harem end. A mother daughter maid combo, a girl who looks exactly like himself in trap form, an assertive classmate, and so on all fell for Kyolo. This includes the girls who were already crushing on him before.     muh society not accepting polygamy in my manga and anime    But incest and pedophilia are alright       I'm telling you right now as someone who read the LNs, DEEN knocked it out of the park with this one. The earlier LN volumes had way longer setup for gags and there was no way anything adapted straight up from them was going to be funny.  Some of the greatest moments you remember are probably anime original. The mask that Ken couldn't take off was original, the locker he was locked up in was original. Chizuru asking for money in mokyu mode was anime original. The line "I can see it, the sky's tears" during the cat's cradle scene was anime original, and in fact the cat's cradle scene was just funnier in the anime.  DEEN did amazingly on this one, don't you dare imply they did a bad job. It was almost like the later LNs was trying to copy the humor style of it's own adaptation and became better for it.

Fuck JC staff.    You're utmost welcome Mr. Anon. Now you know better than spreading baseless rumors. Enjoy your stay.    hardcore baiting and underage theorycraftin  This has been happening since Episode 1. I don't see this shit with other LN adaptations, why the fuck is DanMachi so filled with these kind of crap. The show isn't even that popular, why the hell anyone would care to waste their time making up shit like this is something that will be forever beyond my comprehension.        please tell us more    You're wrong, everyone says you're wrong. Novels say you're wrong. Shame on me for falling for this bait.    meanwhile in bizarro /a/ ..

The next day, I went to Japan for the talent show thing. Ron Raper, Miia, and Cerea were already there. Cerea was wearing weird clothes, but I was wearing a purple tweed catsuit with orange polka dots and wooden clogs. I also had underwear on.  I got behind the judging table with them. It had "X" buzzers on it like on "America's Got Talent". Ron Raper was smoking sexistly.  We saw more acts. Rachnera sang a song about how sexist her old homestay was, Mero feministly swam in circles, and Manako sniped some stuff. Ron Raper sexistly buzzed most of the acts for no reason.  Then  Ms. Smith  came on stage. I buzzed her right away because she was a slut. She got out a stripper pole and started to dance sexually and take off her slutty pink clothes at the same time. Miia and Cerea buzzed her too, but Ron Raper didn't so it didn't get stopped. Ms. Smith finished her act by being a prostitute and getting a guy from the audience to pay to have sex with her on stage in front of everyone. Crabman told all the younger readers to cover their eyes, but some didn't.  "That is the act that will win this competition!" said that sexist idiot Ron Raper, holding his cigarette evilly. "You're absolutely perfect at the only thing women can do besides clean," he added because he was sexist.  Several sexist boys in the audience cheered. I felt scared that their votes would make that ugly slut Ms. Smith win!               No.  I would switch lives with him, any day of the week.  Even with the horrific bodily-injuries and the like, he has the greatest life anyone could ask for and I'd take one like it in a heart-beat.         Fuck you. That is all.   Centorea worst [/spoiler[     No, thanks. I don't take dicks.   Wouldn't want your mum to be jobless.      Tomorrow is the final episode/epilogue so I thought I should post this.  For those who don't know. A artist on twitter by the name of Tsukumo has for every episode since UBW started up in October has posted multiple comics of Saber reacting to watching the UBW anime and Shirou reacting (along with other characters watching it). He was doing it based on what was should happen in the episode based on the VN (So he posted it when it happened live) and everything original in the anime.  It got really popular on both twitter and pixiv and he even decided to publish it as doujin.  Going to post all of it from episode 0-episode 24 along with the translated text and Shirou's reaction he posted with it on twitter.  Hope you enjoy.            Which one was it? That sound pretty familiar.     This shit was planned prior to F/Z airing so already back in 2010   And yet they let the UBW movie happen?        Normally the site uploads around five pictures per preview, and the staff credits for UBW's second half is much larger not to mention a chunk of the key animation for some episodes were outsourced. More people on a production tends to mean that time is running short- so work is divided among more people to get things done.   Episode 24 had 27 guys plus a number of subcontractors on second key animation to help clean up the work of 19 key animators. The first season didn't have to fall back on second key animators this much.        I'm still not sure about the preview image thing. That seems more like they just wanted to keep people in suspense.    Of course they wanted Deen to first do it and completely shit on it later. Nasu hates DEEN and doesn't acknowledge it.   o-ok...    While you also get the added benefit of being labeled a child genius, so you get a whole new batch of pressure and expectations that will be impossible for you to ever meet.   Dude, that's an extra decade to learn any discipline or concept you weren't already familiar with. An elementary school student with rudimentary knowledge of algebra, geometry, chemistry, and physics has already completely bypassed middle school in terms of intellect. If they know calculus, a foreign language, or how to program, they're a prodigy. You don't even have to go too far with this if you don't want, you can just be the top of your class every year effortlessly.   And if you decide to just skip everything, well, there goes your chance at potentially fixing your social life.   Interesting point, but this could be a blessing in disguise. Since you'd an adult in a child's body dealing with children, you might not actually have all that much in common with them anymore, although it might be a lot of fun to get into that mentality.   all the restrictions you get as a child   Many of these are also mental barriers, too. Elementary school students aren't actually aware of the thought processes that go into the rules they follow, which is why they can seriously say "school is stupid, I don't need an education" and stuff like that.               I'm an adult and I still think school was a huge waste of time     The point is that it's someone who had a shitty school life or has a shitty current life or has regrets and needs/wants to straighten this out somehow. Do you really not see what the point of "chance to fix every mistake you ever made" is?    If I got my mind transfered back to my childhood, I'd just fucking kill myself, regardless of any monetary/social payoffs that are nowhere near guaranteed.  Plus, monetary pay-offs are one hundred percent guaranteed as long you can remember that Apple or Facebook or Bitcoin are really good investments. And once you know everything they'll teach you and have your financial future guaranteed, school is optional. If you really aren't interested in reliving a single thing, you just take a high school equivalency exam and do what you want. Hell, depending on your age, you could probably line up a job, get emancipated, quit the job shortly after, and have all your current status except drinking and voting rights.          No doubt plenty of it was, but a ton of it is more central to your development than you might realize, especially elementary school.      Shit, I forgot I wouldn't be able to drink.

Do you even futa anatomy?   what should i expect from Hōtarō Oreki im thinking of watching it  Its very episodic - there are lots of arcs based on the mysteries that they're solving. The real strength of the show, in my mind, is the character work. There are just so many subtle moments - a side ways glance, an uncomfortable exit, etc - that reveal huge amounts about the characters and their insecurities/thoughts.  Not bad at all, watch it, idiot.     The first episode throws you off a bit, but by the 2nd-3rd one you know what the entire thing is about.     I suppose this is a cruel attempt to remind me that there will never be another season of this.   anything violent i dont look for it but it looks like the type   What is this?   Reincarnation of Yuuta In Shintoism, the mourning period is 49 days after the person dies, and in Buddhism, it takes 49 days to be reincarnated.  Also notice that Yuuta's picture fell down when they heard it, and named it after his panchira fetish (panchira means "panty peek", and the chira in Chiranosuke means "peek"). Of course, he runs off with the panties in the end.  And just because he's his reincarnation, it doesn't mean they're the same character either.         So Chironosuke is reincarnation of Yuuta who already possessed very strong spirit power and can travel through time? Then he abadoned his body for new Yuuta who traveled back to tell the old ghost Yuuta about meteor? So basically we can assume that Yuuta and Chironosuke are both Pine from different time lines. Am I right?        It's a chinchilla, a kind of persian cat.   Didn't you listen to Ito? :^)          it takes 49 days to be reincarnated   It doesn't look like a newborn kitty      no   Tickets are up for a few places, anyone planning on going?  http://www.nisamerica.com/pressrele<wbr>ases/LoveLivetheMovie_theaterinfo_2<wbr>0150626_v5.pdf</wbr></wbr>    Subs when?

That would be a 7 hour drive which would be almost worth it     How would you feel when your best friend plot for your foster dad's D.  Man, this shit is better than Molester man.

It's a daugher end, but I have no idea how that shit happens, so I'm sticking to the manga,    Episode 01 preview http://www.symphogear-gx.com/next/  燃え尽きそうな空に歌は響き、 明日を輝かす種火となる。 拳も命も鎧い支えるは、 胸に揺れる小さな奇跡。 だが、逆巻く炎に涙する瞳は、 そうと知ってなお対峙する。  EPISODE 01 奇跡の殺戮者  鎮魂の夜を急ぐ血塗られた魔縁と、 かけてもつれた抒情詩。 耳をすませば遠からず、 世界を壊す――歌がある。             I think the dolls just have their own personalities. Say Leuir even has a young sister, this might implies they were living like a big family.     I would marry Maria and adopt DMJII.    Here's hoping for plenty of ass-shots in episode 1.  Hopefully the anon that tried to compile the ones in G while it was airing will come back or have someone else take over.     Considering it more seriously, Maria probably made a deal since we saw a shot of her talking to someone through a glass while she was in a straitjacket. Probably includes her having to be watched by Tsubasa and the girls going to the school where Chris and Hibiki are.   It's good to be back.</blockquote>]
