I stopped doing it for a year to finish school and now that I'm out of school I'm starting to do job interviews and such, and considering my pace, I have no idea how I'll possibly do anything remotely related to fanart once I have a job. I tried to get as close to the DanMachi Anime's style as possible. I know it's average but I hope it at least gets a passing grade. Somebody's gotta draw side characters after all.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  okay , commencing drops. this was awhile back ago. the theme for the first 3 is Kemonomimi girls brushing their hair/tails<br><br>i also wanted to note that there was a request for Tsubaki from Trinity Universe. to the requester im sorry, i decided to put it of until next week (hopefully), and as a reminder, i will be posting it /v/ and cross linking it.</br></br>      <br>They're all terrible. Stop drawing and focus on your job.</br>  Is there anyone stronger than Caped Baldy?  Saitama stopped a disaster level God without breaking a sweat, he's in his own level.<br> what's higher than a God? <br> Caped Baldy </br></br>  Cloaked Hairless  <br> what's higher than Caped Baldy? <br> John Cena </br></br>  Caped Baldy isn't even the strongest character in his own god damned manga. King is the strongest he even routinely beats Caped Baldy for shits and giggles.  <br>But he can't beat the economy or hair loss. Poor broke bald bastard.</br>  So apparently the second compilation movie adapts Hanji holding Nick over the wall. Anyone got pics of this?  How many imoutos has Levi had killed already? 4?  <br>Isabel, Petra, Nifa, who else? Was there someone before Isabel?</br>  I like how the anime team has the tactic of adding an unusual hair color to random background characters to boost their popularity and it's amazing how well it works.  <br> Kuchel.  She was a imouto. </br>  Isn't Sasha red haired too?  Will we ever see a non-japanese team?            Read the guide: buyfag.moe  <br>I liked it. I'll be sure to film myself some time.</br>  <br>/a/ did like it</br>  <br>  x  <br>What a nice touch. Wasn't she reading yaoi in the show and Araragi said something about it?<br><br><br>I think it was good up until the "Satsuki is actually GOOD guys"<br>I mean I expected it but I was really hoping they wouldn't do it. After that it just went retarded and I hated watching it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am afraid to click this, please, someone hold me.</br>  <br> male gender symbols don't display <br>fuck</br></br>  Has any of you watched the greatest love story ever to be animated recently?  <br>I was talking about Tamako movie.</br>  <br>The post you replied to first was talking about Hyouka</br>  <br>Movie was great and sold 10K<br>Stop trying so hard, it's embarrassing</br></br>  <br>wew lad<br>You've certainly convinced us</br></br>  <br> and sold 10K <br>That's shit sales, and the movie was shit.<br>Please go back to tumblr.</br></br></br>  Best Grisaia  Would you play videogames with her?  <br>I want to hear her squirm and grunt as she pushes out a soggy, mushy turd into my mouth, the second I feel it on my tongue I'd start sucking down her shit like no tomorrow.</br>  <br>My girlfriend has a dick anon</br>    <br>Last novel comes out In August.</br>  <br> Hand holding simulator </br>   "Hey son this box came for ya, what did you order?"

Harem   What does /a/ think of Black Lagoon.  <br>language doesnt matter as long as the acting is good and portrays the characters properly.<br>you dont give a shit about accuracy, its always this with murricans, you just want EVERYTHING to be in american english and you give literally no fucks about the acting quality. fuck off.<br><br>and before:<br> weeb <br> you only think the acting is better because you dont understand what theyre saying <br>No and no.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>most dubs are shit but dub&gt;sub for black lagoon</br>  <br>It's kind of true. For one, not having to read the subs means I can pay more attention to the animation and art. I do largely enjoy the voice work from both sides of the ocean but that extra bit of familiarity with language and view of the action tips it.</br>  <br>A bit irrelevant anyway since manga&gt;anime for Black Lagoon.</br>  Obligatory when dub is brought up.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DKw<wbr>aPSkjXp0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #5<br><br>As always please remember to take it easy!<br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you can say the figure is weak if it works. I mean sure it could be more interesting but it's not like that is the only measure of a drawing. Being able to make a good one with a simple pose is very important too. <br>If you want to rate him as an artist this picture alone is not enough to judge that, and one picture really can't ever do that anyways. <br>It could be he struggles with more complicated gestures and and figures but you can't tell that from that picture alone.</br></br></br>  There's always that one person.  <br>And as the artist, it's that one person's comment you always remember.</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's like. They weren't asking for any critique or anything like that. I bet they wouldn't have responded with that criticism at all if there weren't a ton of people saying they liked the art.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure once you get to this point you know how to handle critique, good and otherwise.</br>  The sunset gave me a harder boner than any porn I have watched in the last month. Is this normal?  what the fuck is the deal with this fucking family?<br><br>did I miss a season where they explained why the Yukinoshita family is so fucking strange and horrible?</br></br>    <br>Balls.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vz_<wbr>EssIJP9Q</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br><br>He did internally monologue that he would have fallen head over heels in love with her, if he was ten years older and had met her a few years earlier. As it stands though, circumstances prevent any kind of action from him with regards to her.  And he seems to have developed some feelings for Yukino along the way. But, if she can't get her shit together by the time they graduate, I don't think his personality would let him stick around.<br><br>Sensei might be just a WEE bit desperate, but she's rocking it.</br></br> </br></br>  <br>We all know which one is more stylish</br>  Minami should of won<br><br>what the fuck was this bullshit siscon ending</br></br>  <br>Dude knocked up his Imouto at least.</br>  <br>Not really.

Saying Manami is the sole reason why he's not as proactive as he used to be as a fucking toddler is dumb.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't even what I was arguing, I suggest you reread my post. <br><br>His actions during the series indicate his reckless genki attitude very much did return, while you claimed he was the same person Manami molded.</br></br></br>  </blockquote>]
