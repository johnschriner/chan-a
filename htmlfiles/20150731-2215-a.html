[ Dressrosa officially over<br><br>Now it's Zoo time</br></br>  <br>Kuro's quirk is him fixing his glasses ?<br>Crocodile's is what ? Bellamy, what ? Moria is lazy, sure but not really a quirk. Doffy's quirk is his nickname ? <br><br>What I mean by 'quirk' is stuff like Buggy being pissed about his nose or Magellan's diahrea or Hannybal's Warden ambition. Funny stuff like that. <br><br><br>You really think Kaido will die ? Come on bro, even Doffy lived through it. And I don't really mean Kaido will be on Luffy's side, he just won't be against him, if that makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kaido has actually eaten 100 zoans <br> constantly switches animals mid-combo <br> like grabbing someone as a snake, flying upwards as an eagle, then falling down on them as a whale <br>  Luffy gear 5s him down to a draw eventually with a lot of help after a ten chapter fight <br> Kaido seems down for the count <br> suddenly grabs into a barrel next to him <br> pulls out a fistful of rumble balls <br> eats them all at once <br> no chapter next week <br>Post yfw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no prove for this, but to me it seemed like he didn't noticed them. That's quite a big difference to ignoring someone. Maybe he is actually bling as people suggested or he has no CoO. I would also guess that he can't hear. but that is impossible as his subordinates called for him.</br>  <br>Sanji was already working in a kitchen before meeting Zeff you dingus</br>  <br>Don't read weekly if you can't handle it.</br>  The Buddha has come to take your Waifu away.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br>Tell him Jesus is wasting money on useless otaku shit again so must stop him</br>  <br>Buddha was a sheltered loser.

Request anyone! Kobato delivery from last thread.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128837439 <br><br>I'll join in delivering as well, hope that's ok<br>This is from the last thread which got deleted for some reason.</br></br></br>  <br>wow, you actually drew it<br>thanks</br></br>  Draw Frodo Baggins as a delinquent, please.  <br>Could you draw something cute with this little guy.</br>  Use the general you dumbfuck.  Draw her getting bullied  Draw my cute daughteru (bottom part)  <br>thanks treefour</br>  Would you let your mom dress like this?  <br>Dammit. MC already hinted on it too, he told her something about being a Sky Wizard to protect people is the most important thing, didn't he? Yet Misora is still MUH MOM.<br><br>Oh yeah, also  Lecty best girl. </br></br></br>  <br>its the definition of forced drama</br>  <br>A child wanting to be like her famous mother sounds pretty natural, are you sure you're not just throwing that string around?</br>  <br>I think he meant the 'dies and forgotten' part.</br>  <br>That's barely touched upon by any of the characters.</br>  AOTS. Is there even any competition?  <br><br>Shimoneta actually the worst thing I've watched this season. The jokes are agonizing to listen to because they're uncreative and none of the characters are that likable.<br><br> Do you not like dirty jokes <br><br>If they're done right. Not just 'PENIS VAGINA OHOHOHOHOHO', spamming gestures, and simply forcing sex related terms as replacements in your vocabulary.<br><br> Your humor must be soooooooooooo Mature <br><br>I found Panty and Stocking, Mitsudomoe, and even Daimidaler bearable. Shimoneta's jokes are so bad, they had to make me pause just put my face in my palms in utmost disappointment.<br><br> depending on how it turns out it may be my WAOTY </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Forgot to add. The only pros about it are the cool OST and the girls are hot. Doujins when.</br></br>  <br> Do you not like dirty jokes? <br>Dirty jokes in Shimpneta are pathetic. Besides, they cross the line between 2D and 3D in the worst possible way.</br></br>  What dog.  Just watched this. <br>It began relatively well, better than I expected, but then it turned to absolute shit in its second half. It's a shame, it almost managed not to be bad. <br><br>Why can't any Dragon Ball production be good anymore ? Everything produced in the last few years has been awful : OVAs, movies, and the new anime series. <br><br>Couldn't they just let Dragon Ball rest in peace ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People seem to forget that if one lowers his ki he becomes vulnerable to almost every kind of attack, Kuririn coud 1 hit KO Vegeta when he lowered his power on Namek and it was explained that this gun works like special beam cannon and can penetrate through anything, it's still bullshit regardless, at this point they've could at least give Vegeta chance to finish off Frieza.</br>  <br>Ok, that settle then but not changing the fact there is no lightning in bog ssj 2 vegeta making it impossible to be confirmed as ssj 2. And surpassing ssj using lower ssj level is never happened before because mostly ssj upgrade is a steep increase.</br>  <br>How can he lower his ki when ssgss is ki transformation. Supplying ki is a must to maintain ssj transformation.</br>  <br>It's funny in this new canon shenron literally became idiot and could fucked up pilaf wish. Shenron cannot fucked up a wish in the canon material but in the BoG shenron fucked up pilaf wish and make them felt suffered. How can this movie is so different than the original manga setting?</br>  <br><br><br><br>It is very obvious that you're trolling, but in care you aren't, it must be hard to function with such severe autism.</br></br></br></br>  New thread from <br><br>Since we already know who won the ainzbowl, time to decide upon best meido again.<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/5078833</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because the more belts you have the better you are at fighting.</br>  <br>To keep Ainz' chastity safe</br>  <br>Well shit.

It takes hundreds of hours of reading and looking words up before start to get in the groove with it all but there are those who can spend more time and less time equally worrying about vocabulary all the same. <br><br>After a while you are going to have to accept that for a long while yet there are going to be many, many words you will not understand upon first seeing them, or either keep worrying about it and not enjoy the process as much. <br><br>The wider you read the more unknown words you will come across.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anybody reach fluency without being a NEET? I fear I'm going to have to give up my NEETness sometime in the near future and the idea of not having the energy to learn anything scares me  <br>summer ending?</br>  <br> Anybody reach fluency without being a NEET?  <br>Countless people over the decades. I have no idea where this meme about having to be a NEET in order to learn something came about.

Is it a thing?  <br>7 replies about 4K and not one Gothicmade meme yet? I'm surprised.</br>  <br>4k might be practical for film, but there is really not much to be gained in 2D animation. Anime certainly won't be produced in 4k (or higher) for a while.</br>  <br>Right, not for a while, but when it's a standard everywhere else, like 1080/720 became, we'll see anime in the new future resolution, whatever it may be.</br>  <br>Hopefully average bandwidths and storage capacities will have increased enough to keep pace by the time it becomes commonplace.</br>  <br>Bandwidth might catch up, storage capacity won't.<br><br>This isn't the early 2000s where capacities were literally doubling every 12-18 months.<br>5 years ago, 4TB drives were all the rage.<br>Just last year, they barely managed to make a 6TB drive.<br>Storage devices are no longer doubling in size, meaning that data centers will have to physically become proportionally larger in order to accomodate future demands for data.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  sadpanda/exhentai thread<br><br>here's some to start off<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/822910/80ffd3<wbr>bdae/<br>http://exhentai.org/s/43b1b15bae/70<wbr>3409-6<br>http://exhentai.org/g/766816/c59078<wbr>9e1a/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/753401/1aeff5<wbr>affd/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't have a problem with that if fakku would have been a much bigger company than it is now and brought like at least most of the comics, events and authors/works, like if they had at least 75% of sadpanda gallery with all the genres like lolicon/guro just with no exceptions not to bum anyone out since it's jap market to begin with and exceptions in hentai is a terrible thing and if it all was in good res, with translation and uncensored I would honestly say that would be amazing.<br>But right now it's just eh, they have something but you can get it outside of fakku as well, so maybe in some years we will see the golden age of hentai, or not and they will flop and turn to shit.</br></br>  <br><br>Mah nigga this one is god like</br></br>  When are you coming back to loli H Show? <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/837743/1ee0b1<wbr>3e03/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I'm only six hours late, but here you go.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/836723/9d3bbc<wbr>dcdd/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I would but that's a lot of text without bubbles there.
