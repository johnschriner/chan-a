[ How do we defeat Imagine Maker?  We break him  <br>Who the fuck is that?</br>  <br>pasting from another thread.<br> The dude in the last pics is Kamisato Takeru the self-proclaimed 'Magic God Hunter'. Seem like he also posses a special power in his right hand. He called his power 'World Rejector' and killed Niang-Niang with just one touch (Niang-Niang also show pleasure when she 'died') He has already killed all of the Magic Gods that are hiding in the other dimension. Othinus is his next target, it seems. <br><br> Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist. And laura called him a fool for that. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Anti-Touma</br>  <br>Simple, we just kill him!</br>  <br>Why, though? He seems like he's doing some serious good.</br>  <br> Niang-Niang also show pleasure when she 'died' <br>He fingered her to death?</br></br>  <br>So magic gods are no longer relevant?</br>  <br>But isn't Touma's job to destroy gods? He's doing the same shit!</br>  <br>Since when were you under the impression they were relevant?</br>  <br>Touma is protecting a god.</br>  Othinus is kill next volume. Can't wait for Othishitters to cry about it.  <br>the moment Othinus dies Touma goes full batshit. As sad as it is, I'd take the sacrifice just to see Touma going apeshit on the world</br>  <br>makes it feel like the magic gods only existed to save othinus, and I don't like that.</br>  <br>Is this some new shit or have I been even more out of the Raildex loop than I thought?</br>  <br> Fairy <br>Unless they have somehow returned Othinus to her former self and she's no longer an onahole for Touma, I see no point on that kid even showing up.</br></br>  New shit. Out of nowhere without even Aleister noticing NotTouma appeared and killed off all the gods.  <br> implying touma will allow that when now he has unlock something in his hand </br>  <br>But anon! Takeru is living his life correctly, what can Touma even do against someone lika that?</br>  <br>Cry harder, Othishitter. She will die and there will be nothing Touma can do about it</br>  <br>10/10 writing, Kamachi, now give me more fruitless teasers for Biribiri development so I can forget about this shit.</br>  <br>Its a Two parter</br>  <br>Buttblasted hater detected</br>  <br>  give me more fruitless teasers for Biribiri development so I can forget about this shit. <br>yfw she reaches level 6 next volume.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist. And laura called him a fool for that. <br>That sounds like "I totally made him right now and shoehorned him in the story" because I can.</br></br>   Touma <br> Getting a Powerup </br>   Misaki has her ship sunk <br> Mikoto has her ship sunk <br> Othinus is kill soon <br><br>when will you delusional drooling retards admit Touma will end up<br>alone or dead</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to see Touma being raped by the stalking female gods<br> notice me sempai! <br>(on mobile img posting does not work sorry)<br>http://i.imgur.com/Pw1PciU.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>Besides the actual retards, everyone is expecting him to end up alone and insane</br>  <br>delusional waifu shipping faggot detected</br>  <br> Mikoto has her ship sunk <br>Gr8 b8</br></br>  <br>Well, it's sunk if the spoilers are true.</br>  <br>Where?</br>   Anti-Touma kills Niang-Niang instead of making her part of his harem <br><br>What a faggot.</br></br>  <br> one touch of death <br> even crowley didn't know about him <br>Almost sounds like a fanfic mary sue</br></br></br>  <br> shipping <br>Pls, its a proven fact that under toumas protection no ever fucking dies.</br></br>  <br> Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist <br>Crowley really can't get his shit together since the WW3.</br></br>  <br>The spoilers are in last thread. Go find them and read them.</br>  <br>We already knew there would someone else with a special power. We didnt expect him to be a NotTouma and to appear suddenly.</br>  <br><br> Mikoto realizing that she's useless against magic gods somehow means the ship has sunk <br><br>You're reaching pretty hard there anon-kun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a ruse, just like he rused the magic gods.</br>  <br> What is volume 2 </br>  <br><br>It literally says that Mikoto was sad because she cant keep up with magic god powerlevels and cant help Touma. That's it.</br></br>   Crowley doesn't know about Kamisato <br> Laura does <br>Crowley<br>Crowley pls<br>Try coming out of your piss tank one of these days<br>Or at least stop stalking your boytoys and watch the news or something, you filthy NEET</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget crowley needed to a really round about way just to kill one magic god and he apparently kills all of them. Pretty sure the ones who didn't come out didn't have the nerf spell on them either.</br>  <br>Is he just going to appear in the finale? Are we forced to wait for months again for the plots?</br>  <br>She also realized she's useless for Touma. So. She sunk her own ship</br>  <br>I read them, but if you think that this is a sunk<br> Last tightening in Misaka, after returning to the student dormitory, it is lamented him and is far <br>You're delusional.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm hoping for.</br>  <br>I really doubt that's going to end it.</br>  <br>The same way we defeated the Othinus/Index fusion into a magic god last volume, by not believing fake spoiler.</br>  <br><br>No, she realized she cant help him this time. That doesn't mean anything. If anything, she's going to resolve to get stronger or some shit.</br></br>  <br>He'll probably be the Fiamma of NT, so expect a further build up arc (i.e. the God's Right Seat arc of OT building up to WW3) before he actually does anything.</br>  <br><br> oh no I cant fight LITERAL GODS I must be useless to Touma he'll never love me now bawwww guess my ship has sunk for reals <br><br>You are literally retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is he a gemstone or a magician? Or is he something else along the same lines as Touma?</br>  <br> Last tightening in Misaka, after returning to the student dormitory, it is lamented him and is far <br>I don't even know what this means, but "last tightening in Misaka" sounds like a consummated ship, not a sunk one.</br></br>   yfw when Anti-Touma is actually #6   I can't help but feel Aiwass is going to be super underwhelming when he shows up now.  <br>Not really. Seems like she's accepted it won't work out with Touma</br>  <br>So is this the unknown helper?</br>  WE LITERALLY HAVE AN ANTI-TOUMA RUNNING AROUND BEHIND CROWLEY'S BACK AND KILLING MAGIC GODS WITH EASE<br><br><br>AND YOU FAGS STILL KEEP DRONING ON ABOUT FUCKING SHIPPING</br></br></br>  <br>That's dumb, you're dumb<br>6th is perfect as he is</br></br>   trusting spoilerfags <br><br>When will you guys learn</br></br>  <br>Oh, you already read it?</br>  <br>Even the magic gods called Aiwass weak. Honestly I can imagine imagine anything being on a bigger scale than othinus was.</br>  <br><br>You derived this from a google translated synopsis even though it says nothing of the sort?</br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean anything, as Touma can't even help himself. Plus none of his other allies can stand up to them either. Not that it matters since the magic gods are presumably dead now.</br>  <br>If Kamachi goes full Thelema than he is just the herald of something greater</br>  <br>Because the anti-Touma thing is completely retarded, and the only part of it I care about is the part where he's trying to kill Othinus. Which makes it relevant to waifu-wars.</br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>This. Its too good to b true its like the fake spoilers last time about Touma can't dispel gemstone attack s and index and othinus making pseudo IB</br>  <br>And I'm literally fucking your mom behind your dad's back.</br>  <br><br>The illustrations confirm a lot of the spoilers anon.</br></br>  <br>Why would he even kill a 15cm useless fairy unless that bitch is just lying about losing her power</br>  <br>Maybe he just want to help</br>  <br><br>She couldn't keep up with saints either, she wasn't going to help in a boss fight magic gods or no magic gods. She should stick to hacking and science knowledge since is way smarter than him.</br></br>  <br><br>Get in line behind all the other 10 year olds on xbox, anon</br></br>  Anyone else glad that Kamachi dropped magic gods? They were interesting initially but reality warping is a shit power for good fights.  <br>ANOTHER HAREM MEMBERS FUCKING SERIOSULY?</br>  <br>Why is he even trying to kill anyone? I sure don't fucking know.</br>  <br> The illustrations confirm a lot of the spoilers anon. </br>   Kuroko shows up   <br>But she wants to be able to be useful for him and her ability is not as useful against them. Isn't she the strongest member of his harem? Or it's Kanzaki?</br>  <br>Honestly it doesn't sound good, and if his only motive is killing gods and he also has killed all the gods except othinus, he probably wont be in the story long.</br>  <br>I am. I also hope World Rejector kills Othinus</br>   Kamisato steals Touma's harem <br> no more magical girls around == no more troubles <br> Touma finally can live a peaceful high school life goofing around with the rest of Delta Force <br> one day he asks Fukiyose out <br> she agrees after beating him up <br>GOOD END</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean NT3 didn't involve a pedophile kidnapping the main cast for nefarious purposes?</br>   Kamisato is Kamachi's self insert removing all trace of the shittiest thing to happen in Index from existence <br>Based Kamachi</br>  <br><br>You're comparing 1 misleading cover to an entire slew of illustrations that confirm like 70% of the spoilers.</br></br>  <br> Even the magic gods called Aiwass weak <br>What the hell is wrong with Kamachi ? Introducing Literal God Tier beings so they can job to a newfag and Aiwass who is supposed to be final villain tier is gonna get rekt by some Newfag whose luck is fucking God Like for Crowley to not notice. Kamachi is finally losing his shit</br></br>  <br>Aren't the Magic Gods still nerfed thanks to Alesteir?</br>  <br>They only used reality warp with othinus the others didn't even want to fuck with reality. Also they don't do that with people above phase foolery like crowley.</br>  <br><br>Introducing literal gods before the actual finale was a dumb move on Kamachi's part honestly. It trivializes 99% of the cast.</br></br>  F A K E   S P O I L E R S<br>A   <br>K   <br>E   <br><br>S   <br>P   <br>O   <br>I   <br>L   <br>E   <br>R   <br>S  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma and 95% of his allies can't fight saints either. What the fuck is your point, anon?</br>  <br>because Magic Gods are to dangaorous.<br>and there are to many.</br></br>  <br>Why is this nigga touching carelessly</br>   that High Priest <br>If this isn't some imaginary shit that Misaka is having, this novel would be solid 10/10 because of this alone</br>  <br>That's a fake spoiler</br>  <br> Anyone else glad that Kamachi dropped magic gods? <br>I am but the way it was handled was as shitty as it gets.</br></br>  <br>at least the three shown here are but the others never left the dimension so they shouldn't even have the nerf zombie put on them either.</br>  <br>What? She could in NT6.</br>    <br>Sometimes its best to just bullshit your way out of things, I'd rather not lose 3 volumes to him trying to make up a better way of doing it.</br>  <br> Niang-Niang <br> dead <br> doesn't get to join the harem. <br>God damn. I hate you, Kamachi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's one of his stronger allies. Only weaker than Kanzaki and Kazakiri when it comes to brute strength.</br>   no japannese text <br>It's fake</br>  <br>The point is she was never in a position to help him fight wise, so this changes nothing even if the gods are dead. Her skills have always been at better use elsewhere.</br>  <br>But Kanzaki nerfs herself</br>  <br>Touma has no more shits to give when it comes to weird magical women hanging off of him</br>  <br>So did he stick that plug on misaka?</br>  <br><br>Did you not see all of last thread?</br></br>  <br> Mikoto will never wear that outfit outside of her own thought bubble <br>suffering<br><br><br>She was keeping up because the saint was swinging a big chunk of metal around that she magnetised to slow her down. Brunhild would have destroyed her if she'd just dropped the sword.<br><br><br>Someone's been posting pictures of text pages in the last thread, I can't read it but that and pictures confirm that it's not going to be miles away from true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw Mikoto never charge your mobile <br>Why live?</br>  <br>She could, when the saint uses no magic, she has a massive field advantage and thor tells her about her opponent. With all that she was still narrowly avoiding death.</br>  <br>Touma's getting prettier every volume, is suffering actually a beautifier?</br>  <br>This. Haters need to stop trying so hard. What Kamach is doing for MIsaka is literally setting up to make her grow stronger as a character and probably powerlevels too.</br>  <br>He doesn't even scream and just stare blankly at all the bitches hanging to him</br>  <br>kanzaki kazakiri, and that is excluding all the male allies.</br>  You need plot armour to defeat the Touman.  <br><br><br>There's something in Touma's pupils in this volume that's different than usual. It's like it's more blank than the previous volumes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Obviously. Look at Shiage and Accel comparitive to how they used to look like</br></br>  It is a legit spoiler though. Some Japs in 2ch thread has already confirmed this.  <br>Its suppose to cleanse you and give way to either enlightment or insanity</br>  <br>So, besides Accel, Kakine and maybe Gunha, no level 5 can rival a Saint? Magic side is so overpowered. And even ANgel Accel is not that strong compared to magic side top tiers.</br>  <br>No, she's to pure for it. Only after kissu.</br>   no NT14 in September   Othinus dead -&gt; Touma crazy -&gt; Index dead -&gt; more crazy.<br><br>Poor Touma.</br></br>  <br>but almost every magician gets nerfed when they lose</br>  <br><br>Kazakiri is in the harem?</br></br>   yfw anti-Touma looks suspiciously like civilian Gunha   <br>Its only hell for him now<br><br> yfw demon king touma </br></br></br>  <br> A walking battery recharging Biribiri <br>Moe as hell.</br></br>  <br>Espers have more potential for growth though, if Level 6 is anywhere near as strong as its hyped up to be.<br><br><br>I thought she wasn't, she always seemed more interested in protecting Index than Touma.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aleister didn't even know that Kamisato exist <br>I refuse to believe that the guy with another hand power just coincidently appeared out of nowhere right after Aleister personally raided Magic Gods, destroyed their Sekrit Club and lured them out of their dimension only to coincidently do exactly what Crowley wanted to be done.<br> Kamisato was an inside job. </br></br></br>  So is the new guy OP or is it something like it only works against MG ? either way it's just too convenient of a power. Feels like Kamachi wrote himself in a corner with introducing the Magic Gods so he made a character solely for erasing that stupid mistake he made   NT 14 will probably be a volume of straight up touma protecting his 15 cm waifu from the anti touma in a bigass fight that expands all over AC <br>MUH DIK<br>double points if accel and all of his other buddies show up to help deal with this shit as the volume goes on.</br></br>  <br>In NT2 she was in the crowd girls welcoming touma back. I think that counts.</br>  <br>Well yeah. Then again, the magic side has practically the whole world under control, while science is stuck in one city.<br><br>On the other side, the most powerful effect from the science side has to be AIM poisoning which can practically shut any magician down.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Kazakiri isn't in Touma's harem, but she is in Touma's faction through proxy because of her interest in Index.</br></br>  <br>Looks like touma but more evil</br>  <br>Except only seven espers out of over a million can even reach Level 5, and out of those seven only one has made any progress in becoming a Level 6, and even then he only gets better when he encounters magical shit</br>  Maybe Anti-Touma is Touma's other half and all of this is Aleister's plan to fuse them together into Super Touman.  <br>His probably the fiamma of my<br><br>So in OT he protects index while in Nt he protects othinus</br></br></br>  <br> Except only seven espers out of over a million can even reach Level 5 <br>wrong in a earlier volume it´s mentioned that<br>some are growing into a different diraction.</br></br></br>  <br>Evil twin separated at birth.</br>  <br> PTSD </br>  <br> othinus is literally the NT version of index but she legitimately isn't shit <br>i'm entirely alright with this.</br></br>  <br> Anti-Touma </br>  <br>gunha doesn't have a magic super power in his right hand like this guy does, in addition his ability seems like the same as toumas but effects the completely opposite things.</br>  <br>Gunha arc soon?</br>  <br>Quote it then, because it sure doesn't sound familiar, and what does growing in a different direction even mean for espers anyway</br>  <br><br>But the point is that Espers and AC tech have progressed really fucking fast in a small amount of time comparative to Magic side, which had millennia to get as far as they have. Hell, if Level 5 Rikou is ever achieved, every esper can be made a level 5 supposedly.</br></br>   Kamijou Touma <br> The One who Purifies God and Slays Demons <br><br> Kamisato Takeru <br> ????? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's anti-Touma's friend, Anti-Gunha.</br>  <br> rikou goes lv 5 <br> hamazura decides then and there to take over skill out to take advantage of this <br> queue hamazura literally getting an army of lv 5's as the true end of the century emperor. </br></br></br>  <br><br> implying Gunha didn't train his hand wo have super powers after furiously masturbating for 7 days straight </br></br>  <br><br>You think too small anon.<br><br> Level 5 "Bullshit luck" Super Hamazura </br></br></br></br>  So when Touma was asking Othinus if he touched her would she die was this actually forshadowing Kamisato?<br><br>Touma knows Othinus is going to die by anit-touma and its about fucking time.</br></br>   Bringing out Kamisato out of nowhere <br> Make it so only Laura knew of his existence <br> Plot's direction is aimless <br><br>Kamachi isn't trying anymore. The Magic Gods were already pushing it as it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What's the kanji for Kamisato Takeru?</br></br>  Touma:I don't need reason to save someone<br><br>Anti-Touma:I don't need reason to kill you all.</br></br>  <br>How about waiting waiting to see if these spoilers are legit before bashing Kamachi.</br>  <br> The One who Purifies Demons and Slays Gods.  </br>   yfw those evil Touma promo cards were actually a hint by Kamachi    Left thread that died faster than a flightless hummingbird <br> Anti Touma out of nowhere <br> God dead out of nowhere <br><br>What happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Evil Touma cards <br>Link?</br></br>  <br> all the demon king touma foreshadowing is actually in preperation for the bullshit that is kamisato <br>well fuck, well done kamachi.</br></br>  <br>Fake spoilers.</br>  <br>As per usual, the spoilers are mostly likely wrong, retard</br>  <br>This is probably the least retarded way to retcon Magic Gods</br>  <br>Ah fuck. Guess fakefags really are cancer of society. And I was so hyped too.</br>  <br>spoiler shit happened, along with pictures.<br>some dickass named kamisato takeru has a magic right hand ability that auto kills magic gods and shit as well as he acts like the anti touma.<br>thus everyones calling him the anti touma and the fag is probably going after othinus next volume after this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Spoilers are backed up by illustrations. The anon who thinks spoilers are fake is a retard.</br>  <br>anon you are full of shit.<br>there were pics that went with it that made it look more true then not.</br></br>  <br><br>You're right anon, all of the illustrations that went along with the spoilers are fake too.</br></br>  <br>The Demon Who Purifies People and Slays Gods</br>  <br>Evil blonde index where?</br>  <br>Since when have spoilerfags ever been right for index?</br>  Link to the last thread please?  <br><br>It's more likely that they're mostly right, but some stuff may still have been lost/changed in translation</br></br>  <br> “Academy City has seven Level 5s. However, the predictive calculations of Tree Diagram &gt;have established that there is a single one of them who is capable of reaching the as &gt;yet unseen Level 6. The other Level 5s are either growing in a different direction or their &gt;bodily balance would be lost by an increase in dosage.” <br>Volume 4.</br></br>  <br><br>NT10 and 11, alot of the earlier NTs</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Maybe Kamisato right hand is like a full powered IB that negates the life force of a being<br>Explains why a god Died just being touch</br></br>  What happens if Touma and anti-Touma high five?  <br>Universe implodes.</br>  <br>Spirals</br>  How is Kamisato "anti-touma" specifically? He could just be another powerful right hand user, like Fiamma. Maybe his hand can only cancel out non-mortals and is useless against everything else.  <br>Or maybe Kamisato right hand negates anything natural as IB negates the supernatural.</br>  After that initial wave of Mikoto hate/wanking, The thread turned out ok.  <br>We don't know yet if it's actually taken from the novel or added in the rough translations. He does look a bit like him though.</br>  <br> Watch me try and start up the hate/wanking again <br>stop</br></br>  <br>I think the "Anti-Touma" is just mostly wishful thinking because an Anti Touma would be great. Touma has friends, allies, rivals, enemies but not even one person he could call his nemesis.</br>  <br><br>That wasn't my intention. I was just saying that it seems all the faggots quieted down and its nice.</br></br>  <br>Save it for the archives, talking about it usually makes it start up again. I agree though.</br>  <br> Spoilers are backed up by illustrations <br>Spoilers are based on the illustrations, retard.<br><br>The only thing the pic prove is that he's fighting a magic god, that's all. All the anti-Touma bullshit is fanfiction tier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto will never wear that outfit outside of her own thought bubble <br>That's Birdway's.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, I didn't notice. She looks qt in it.</br>  I haven't been keeping up with this. Is the new NT volume good?  <br> what does growing in a different direction even mean for espers anyway <br>Well, for Kakine it meant that he turned into sports equipment.</br></br>  <br>MIKOTO BEST GIRL<br>OTHER GIRLS ARE SHIT</br></br>  <br>NT12? It was alright, weird in a good way but no plot progress.<br> <br>NT13 hasn't been scanned/translated yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto is best girll. But other grills is good too.</br>  <br>NT 12 is the Misaki volume, right? Or is that 11?</br>  <br>That's 11, I enjoyed it but if you don't like Misaki you probably won't</br>  <br> Accelerator is moving towards magic <br>So who is going to be lvl 6? Kakine or Mikoto?</br></br>  <br><br>But you get based pre-memory loss TouMAN.<br><br> Also checked. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Misaki but it was objectively shit. Misaki herself was shit in this volume, it was so fillerish.</br>  <br>gunha or mugino</br>  Looks like Mikoto gets overshadowed in her own novel again. Good.  <br>Mikoto. Kakine - beetle or original - is barely relevant. <br><br>Besides, Mikoto is practically the weakest level 5 and needs a buff.</br></br></br>  <br> Besides, Mikoto is practically the weakest level 5 and needs a buff. <br>What about Misaki and Mugino?</br></br>  <br> The weakest <br>Accel, Kakine and Gunha are stronger, the others are not, the weakest is Misaki.</br></br>  <br>Stop falseflag. Mikoto is top tier, but so are a handful of other girls.</br>  <br> weakest  <br> when Misaki exists </br></br>   Kamisato trying to kill Othinus next <br><br>I like Othinus but I'd prefer her dying than being locked in character stagnation hell. Also cool to see how Touma reacts since Othinus' death was only prevented by the other magic gods last time and those fuckers can't help now. No more teasing Touma breaking. <br><br>  I'm also secretly wishing Index becomes relevant next in dealing with a broken Touma. </br></br></br></br>  <br>The weakest level 5 that matters you mean.</br>  <br>Gunha is going in a different direction and Mugino s body was too weak so now that she is a cyborg it could be possible.</br>  <br>Misaki is a wildcard.</br>  <br> Spend tons of time with Touma <br> Deep examination of her inner thoughts and feelings <br> Foreshadowing future development <br> overshadowed  <br>Here's your reply.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mikoto <br> matters </br></br>  <br> Index <br> Relevant character <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  Whait if 6 is the one turning into lvl 6?  <br>oops meant to quote</br>  <br>Misaki is irrelevant to anyone who doesn't think with their dick</br>  <br>We arent allowed to?</br>  <br>All of that pales in comparison to the other shit happening in the novel which is what matters to people who aren't dirty Mikoto shippers.</br>  <br> in b4 some shit happens for touma to get all his memories pre amnesia back. </br>  <br> Taking a bait <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>Mikoto doesn't even have a good design to make up for her irrelevance.</br>  <br>Sure you're allowed and it's perfectly fine to do so on occasion. It's making it a happier that's bad</br>  <br>Only fucking retards care about ships in Index, they have never had any importance in the story. Even more so now, when they /are/ being overshadowed</br>  <br>Besides Accel no level 5 has been more important than her, she even has her spinoff.</br>  <br>Just by looking at the illustrations you can see that Mikoto isn't even the highlight of the novel.</br>  <br><br><br>You're not even trying.</br></br></br>  <br> How do we defeat Imagine Maker? <br>by  holding hands </br></br>  <br>Kakine is infinitely more important than Mikoto. <br><br> she even has her spinoff. <br>You mean a manga that Kamachi initially wanted to write about Kuroko instad? Not really a strong argument</br></br></br></br>  <br> spinoff <br> implying that implys importance <br><br>No, a spinoff means she makes money, not that she matters</br></br></br></br>  <br>All ships are getting blown the fuck out anyway. Can't wait for Othinus to die in</br>  <br>I TOLD YOU MAN</br>  <br>but none of that is important to the plot of index. Accel's spin off doesn't make him relevant to the current or future arcs.</br>  <br>No context for that image, and aren't you the ones crying MUH FAKE SPOILERS?</br>  <br>No that's because Mikoto is easier to write. Lightning is defined and much more easy to plot restrict compared to Accel and Kakine.</br>  <br>No, it seems you aren't trying, since you seem to be upset your shitty ships don't actually matter</br>  <br> No context for that image <br>But I know it. Just you wait.</br></br>  <br>OK anon, Accel, Kakine, then who? There's no one else. Kakine is a ball now.</br>  <br>Othinus' ship is on stand by. Not really a proper ship with her current form, but still in a better position than the other girls.</br>  <br> hurr durrr muh ships <br>Kek</br></br>  <br>Check last thread. There were pics of text accompanied with it. THERE IS CONTEXT YOU JUST NEED TO READ MOONRUNES.</br>  <br><br> Story devoting time focus and develop her a la character driven plot <br> It's just shipping and I don't like it, so I don't care. That means overshadowing! <br> Ignores her adventures with Touma and attempt to help Touma against the Magic Gods anyways, which circles back to building up conflict for inevitable resolution in the future <br>Herp derp.</br></br></br></br></br>   yfw Mikoto levels up during this arc   <br>Touma is not going to fuck a fairy, it's sunk anon.</br>  <br>So you know which spoilers are fake and which aren't? How about you tell us how much you know instead of playing the smug know-it-all to get the last word in?<br><br><br>But people in this thread are screaming that every spoiler is fake. Which side does an EOP believe in?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think she'll go that far but I hope we see her white wings equivalent, assuming what we saw in the Manga was black wings.</br>  <br/>  <br>Nuit when?</br>  <br>Shipping is always overshadowed by the plot, and Mikoto is hilariously the poster kid of rejection, ditching and ignorance. The only way Mikoto isn't overshadowed in this novel is if she has a key role in defeating the magic gods.</br>  anything about Mikoto in this novel??  <br>There's an unsormountable wall between Accel, Kakine and the rest. The order for 3-7 is irrelevant.</br>  <br> So you know which spoilers are fake and which aren't? <br>I know the context of this illustration. As I said, just wait for Js's translation.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she seems to be with Touma the entire time, we don't know much else though. Looks like some good SoL/non-action interactions at the beginning, which should be nice.</br>  <br>refer to  for some context in this particular image. Beware Moonrunes.</br>  <br>For Touma.<br><br>Index -&gt;Othinus -&gt;------ other girl.</br></br></br>  <br>OriginalKakine was a beachball and turned into a literal bitch by Othinus. Beetle's still around but doing nothing. <br><br>Unless Kakine is going to stage a tulpa fight and decide to become less schizo I can't imagine him being involved in anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Relevance tiers: Accel&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kakine&gt;&gt;Mikoto&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Mug<wbr>ino&gt;the rest</wbr></br>  Saint Germain give us spoilers.  <br>More like <br>1<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;2 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;the rest</br></br>  <br>No. He just feels responsible for Index and Orthinus: they have nowhere to go except hell outside Touma's house.<br><br>What can the poor boy do but take them in.</br></br></br>  <br>Kamisato is actually Etzali.</br>  <br>So is that future Touma killing magic God's</br>  <br>Get accelerator since he's the soon to ne strongest in the series.</br>  <br> index <br> nowhere to go <br>She has the fucking church, stiyl is just waiting to go dere mode on her.</br></br></br>  <br>Index and Othinus are pets anon.</br>  <br>Future Touma is Kagun, this looks more like alternate universe Touma.</br>  <br>Kakine dark matter pre beetle. Now he's barely relevant to anyone, after splitting in two.</br>  <br>As expected of a hater, delusional and retarded rationalization. You can't write off dedicated development and focus of a character who receives a main role just because you want to reject shipping in general. Mikoto's development is more about her character in acceptance, awareness, and contemplating that will have her do something about it than it is the author trying to set them up indefinitely as a couple, you moron.</br>  <br>You're delusional if think Touma feels forced to take responsibility for them.</br>  <br>We Archer now?</br>  <br>And get brainwashed again, thank you.</br>  <br>kek</br>  I hope Touma dies like the shit character he is.  <br>You don't feel forced when you feel it's your duty, nerd. You either willingly go with it or you don't.</br>  <br>3 Volumes and counting without an appearance, 7 without a major role.</br>  <br>she's dead already, read the OP</br>  <br> brainwashed <br>For what purpose, that entire plot to volume one became redundant the moment the remotes popped up.</br></br>  <br>He will be the strongest and there is nothing anyone can do to stop him.</br>  <br>No one is writing it off you retarded faggot. It's IRRELEVANT to the large scale of things and thinking it has a larger weight than whatever other shit happening is outright your delusion.</br>  <br> Touma <br> dying <br>Hahahahahhahaha<br><br>That's like a fucking blessing if he does die</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>御坂が上条に告白する場面はない<br>上条が、御坂の好意に気づく場面もない<br>上条のことを知れば知るほど、遠い存在のような感じがして絶望感を抱いてい<wbr>る<br><br>No progress in the relationship with Touma.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Kamisato is actually Mikoto's and Touma's son from the future.</br>  <br>Yet you imply that Touma only has them in his dorm because he HAS to take them in his dorm.</br>  <br>Except last order and the sisters dying in the few years and turn him into a drolling reatrd</br>  <br>Mikoto ship has sunk. Not like she had a chance.</br>  <br> Aeister didn't know________ <br>That's bullshit and you know it</br></br>  <br>Spoilers.</br>  <br>Shippers getting BTFO.</br>  <br> the magic gods called Aiwass weak <br>No they didn't. They called it a "failure", not weak. And Aiwass IS a failure because Aleister has very limited control over it.</br></br>  <br><br> yfw Gunha is actually Kaori and Touma son from the future </br></br>  <br>So he will lose his dick when he touch it?</br>  No seriously just how assblasted would people be in Mikoto ended up winning the bowl  <br>Not more assblasted than when she loses it.</br>  <br>They would be  DED </br>  <br> touma will literally beat the everliving shit out of his own future kid for trying to accidentally his waifu. <br>holy shit my sides.</br></br>  <br> Implying accel will let them die <br><br>He's got a better save/kill ratio than fuking Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>I would  love  it and  always  buy everything that Kamachi writes from then on.</br>  <br>to be fair, touma has a shit record because lolothinus happened which invalidated everything he did and simultaniously made him hitler.</br>   Othinus becomes relevant again next novel <br> people saying she was going to become irrelevant and forgotten <br><br>Mein sides.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Anit-Touma wasn't made as the side effect of the sheer fuckery othinus caused which made nature fix with the void made by touma being thrown out of phase for an infinite amount of time and thrown around all kinds of phases and shit. </br>  <br>Protip: there are no fake spoilers.</br>  <br> No one is writing it off  <br>Except you are.<br> IRRELEVANT  <br>That's not how it works, retard. Mikoto's focus and development is largely relevant, especially to her character since it is important there. If the book spends a hefty time on her, than all the more reason it isn't a small thing can be overshadowed, much less written off.<br><br>Comparing anything to the plot of the volume's main climax plot is going to make have less weight (no shit), so that's a shit comparison.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Mfw othinus is going to get killed like the dumb bitch she is   <br>She dies then</br>   This thread   <br> yfw demon king Touma arises after that <br><br>Did gun b good</br></br></br>  <br>Terrible thread isn't it?</br>  <br> Except you are. <br>I'm saying that it is irrelevant in comparison to the fucking plot, you illiterate faggot. You can care about it all you want and it's obvious that it is important to HER character. Yeah, only her character. Not even Touma's. Plus it will never lead anywhere anyway.<br><br> Comparing anything to the plot of the volume's main climax plot is going to make have less weight (no shit), so that's a shit comparison. <br>It's not. Other character driven novels have had its turning points or climaxes with the characters themselves, not the plot. Mikoto is not even the most important thing in her own novel.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you expect?</br>  Reminder that with the High Priest dead characters can officially die outside their introductory volume now. No-one is safe.  <br>tfw usual touma will be freaked out<br>will someone cure him from PTSD?</br></br>  <br>Tea and cakes.</br>  <br>So Touma having a new freeloader is true?<br><br>Can't wait for the magic god interactions.</br></br></br>  <br> his spike hair nearly disappear </br>  <br>Have everyone die and make Touma go on a 3 volume quest to save everyone.<br><br>Make the last volume a PTSD healing one too.</br></br></br>    <br>Hair grows anon</br>  <br> yfw evil touma and index is from different timeline </br>  <br>thats not true, everyone on the planet died an absolute fuckton of times in NT 9 so the precedent was already there.<br>all this does is reinforce that fact.<br>also IB seems to make it that fate twists so touma doesn't stay dead even if it would be far better of a fate for him.<br>so toumas immortal but hes still screwed in an entirely different fashion.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The air around him is negated <br>????</br></br>  Misaka Mikoto? More like Misaka Cuckoto!  <br> not Misaka Micuckold </br>  <br>Hilarious!!!</br>  <br><br><br>JUST</br></br></br>  <br>DO IT</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>MY</br>  <br>ME</br>   平凡な高校生と本人がいってる　学園都市の高校生かはわからない <br>Kamisato call himself as 'normal high school student'.<br>best boy.</br></br>  <br>Few characters in most fiction ever has a worse save/kill ratio than Touma.<br><br>All thanks to NT9 of course.</br></br></br>  <br>SHIP</br>  <br> normal high school student <br>Oh shit.</br></br>  Reminder espers will lose their abilities when they get older.  <br>anti touma confirmed.<br>seriously.</br></br>  <br>UP</br>  <br> normal high school student <br>Oh shit</br></br>  <br>It's time for Kamisato to steal Touma's bitches and create the greatest NTR story ever told.</br>  <br>he is invinsible</br>  <br>i can't actually think of a worse ratio in all honesty.<br>this man inadvertantly killed more people then even demonbane's saved.<br>like how do you even do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Dropped</br>  <br>TOUMA FROM DIFFERENT TIMELINE <br>CALLED IT</br></br>  <br>Literally the fucking anti-Touma. I can't believe it took this long for Kamachi to introduce an archenemy, guess Accel failed on that part.<br><br><br> yfw his hair is red like in the cards <br> yfw his Index is blond <br> yfw his Othinus is silver-haired </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bitch wishes he was as normal as our boy Touma</br>  <br>you mean from the Pure World.<br>he is the original Touma a Faker</br></br>  <br>this makes touma literally shirou from FSN</br>  <br>Except for the fact Touma won't ever fuck any of his girls.</br>  <br> silver-haired othinus <br>someone can post this?</br></br>  <br>Yeah a shitty version.</br>  yup, I thought it's shit Kamisato appears out of nowhere, but come to think of it TouMan is always like that.  <br>There is no silver-haired Othinus, I just wondered what an alternate world Othinus would look like based off those alternate world Touma, Index, Accel, and Shiage looked.  Shiage is basically metrosexual-looking </br>  <br> comparing Touma to an amazing character like Shirou </br>    Reminder IB don't work on gemstones.  <br>remember that spoiler was fake and full of shit.</br>  <br> amazing character like Shirou </br>  <br> amazing character like Shirou <br>Let's not even go over the fact that they are pretty different, but come on.</br></br>  <br> SHITrou <br> amazing </br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Shirou  <br> not an amazing character </br></br></br></br></br>  Archer Touma when  Shirouis so shit that Touma looks good.  <br>Those girls sure are cute!</br>   理想送り <br>kanjis for World Rejector means 'Sending to ideal'<br>also he didn't kill gods but send them to somewhere like utopia.</br></br>  <br>the only good shirou is HF shirou and that route is retarded because sakura is a complete piece of shit.<br>also alternate universe prisma illya shirou but nobody talks about that.</br></br>  <br> the only good shirou is HF shirou <br>Let me guess, you're a zerofag too?</br></br>  <br> Going to continue in passing off his retarded comparison  <br> Seriously thinks Kamachi won't resolve Mikoto's feelings by letting it follow its course it and then have her strengthen her resolve after a major event, and be content with being by Touma's side instead of going for a romantic direction <br>Completely retarded.<br><br>No, there isn't any character driven plot that is more "important" than the main plot of their respective arc/volume. And no, Kuroko and Misaki are an exception in that they are the protag of their own story unlike Mikoto who is only A main character who takes one of the spotlights in the volume. Othinus is an exception to make her go derdere and change her ways, and that was made possible only because her story was self-contained and reached a conclusion. Mikoto's arc isn't over yet and is still in the middle stage, so one cannot compare.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> implying urobutcher can write worth a damn. <br>edge shit/=/good anon.</br></br>  <br>Those eyes, holy shit.</br>  <br>He's called Bersi</br>  <br>how about you explain why SHITrou more amazing than touMAN?</br>  <br>Just like everything in this thread right?</br>  <br>What is this I don't even.</br>  <br>THIS MUST BE ON PURPOSE</br>  <br>Alright, as long as you aren't a butcherfag I can accept your opinions.<br> Fate Shirou is my favorite <br><br>Nah, I don't want to shit up this thread into Raildex vs Fate.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there are literally pics of illustrations that show a fair bit of the spoilers are accurate <br> hurr durr everything is fake, fuck da polis :D <br>you disgust me.</br></br></br>  Remember when accel split Russia in half?    the kanji for Takeru can be read as 'Shoryu' (昇竜) and that literally means 'Rising dragon'. <br><br> And the spoilers seems to be suggesting that he isn't a magician or Esper. But seems to be an existence similar to touma too. </br></br>    <br>anon thats small time currently.<br>at this point touma is literally fighting metaphysical bullshit that can break all of reality at will.</br></br>  <br>Would Othinus look better with silver hair or blond hair?</br>  <br> Takeru <br>Why can they just shoot him?</br></br>  <br>I like not-index the most.</br>  <br>Isn't Shoyru a neopet?<br>Is this the face that has ben haunting dreame?</br></br>  <br>how about kanji for Kamisato?</br>  <br>Kamisato Takeru (上里翔流)</br>  <br>Is he Jesus?</br>  <br>more like Buddha.</br>  <br>So rather than breaking their delusions, he sends them into one<br><br>Sasuga, Bizarro Kamijou</br></br></br>  <br> somewhere like utopia. <br>So he sends them to a similar world like what Othinus created and what Touma chose to destroy? Cool.</br></br>  <br>oh shit 上条 当麻</br>  Remember when Index and Othinus fused and how Imagine Breaker doesn't work on Gemstones?  <br><br>anti-touma confirmed<br>even kanji admits it.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry something about the spoilers burned your butt, but they are real</br>  <br> Index and Othinus fused and how Imagine Breaker doesn't work on Gemstones <br>huh?</br></br>  <br>He's referring to some fake spoilers a while back.</br>  <br>Those were fake spoilers that people believed. The guy's point is that these spoilers shouldn't be trusted either. But these look fairly trustworthy, so ignore him.</br>  <br>That is absolutely fucking kawaii. <br> mfw Mikoto is in full dere mode for the majority of this volume </br></br>  <br>Touma's power is shit against anyone with a functioning brain.<br><br>Literally all they have to do is buy a knife and stab him to death.<br><br>If they can afford it then a gun or a hit team.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OP didn't ask how to defeat Imagine Breaker - anyone who isn't being sodomized by the plot can do that. He asked how to defeat Imagine Maker.</br>  <br>Shotgun to the face.</br>  Which Dragon is your favorite and why?  Anti-Touma a shit<br><br>I bet he doesn't even have sexy DRAGONS in his hand.</br></br>  <br>hes asking about anti-toumas powers, which seems to be the ability to BTFO pretty much every living thing that moves<br>the big problem on it is its short range like toumas ability so a gun could do it.<br>a knife would simply lead you to the same damn fate as a magic god, which is to get exploded.</br></br></br>  I hope this new guy isn't all that superhuman, just like Touma. The more powerful your villain gets the less interesting the fights involving them tend to be  <br>Dragon-faggot aka #9</br>  <br>in b4 he has phoenix's or something equivalently gay like that in his hand.</br>  <br>Number 9 looks like it could suck my dick, so I like that one the best<br>I wonder what its eyeballs will feel like brushing against my dick</br></br>  <br>Get kakine to make a dark matter copy.</br>  <br>He describes himself as a normal highschool boy.</br>  <br>Shoot the bitch in the fucking face, is it so fucking hard?</br>  <br>To be be fair, this fandom has had serious problems with spoilers; fake and real.<br><br>Anyone else remember the utter insanity that occured with the advent of Beetle 5?<br><br>Everyone was repulsed by the idea, but then the actual volume came out and most people really warmed up to it.<br><br>I think these are legit spoilers, but I'm still sceptical because we're lacking context for them,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the original (8), besides that I liked the one with wings on its face but it seems to have been removed or turned into 3, I can't tell. 9 and 10 also look new, 10 looks pretty cool.</br>  <br>i'm kind of convinced 10 is toumas personal dragon, so that one.</br>  <br>Those all look like shit.</br>  <br><br>Oh, I'm sorry, but Dragon-faggot is actually #16</br></br>  <br> normal </br>  <br>I have just finished Rokka vol 3.<br>Now looking back at our base, this shit is actually very much like that novel, every fucking time.</br></br>  <br>So since his a normal highschool boy doesn't it mean Touma can't win against him?</br>  <br>anon i don't even think we need the context because its fairly comprehensive and obvious.<br>the only ones pissed really are the mikotofags for misinterpreting it.<br>all the rampant anti touma speculation is hilarious as hell though.</br></br></br>  <br> normal high school student </br>  <br>Why the fuck are there so many now.

How can we Touma stop the normies?  <br>Misaka with pantyhose all of my hngh</br>  <br>Launching High Priest in space, charge mobile.</br>  <br> FUCKING NORMIES TRYING TO KILL MY WAIFU &gt;REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE</wbr> </br>   Kamachi says he'll focus on Mikoto now <br> nope, have this new character that is basically Anti-Touma, and easily kills the magic gods and not even Aleister knows about </br>  <br>Wait is that Touma in a suit? Why he look scary</br>  <br>So it's possible that he sends them to a completely different world instead of just putting another layer to the world to make their ideal world. The magic gods can probably just force it through to get out if they're only contained in a world layer, so it could be something else. Is it going to be something like Kamachi crossover thing?</br>  <br>It's like he appears only in Epilogue or so.</br>  <br>She bought him an expensive hotdog<br>I mean sure it tasted exactly the same as the normal shit he buys, but it's the thought that counts<br>kinda</br></br></br>  <br>Not the biggest</br>  <br>New character, dude.</br>  <br>Mikoto will probably be very important in this arc.<br><br>A very expensive hotdog.</br></br></br>  <br>Literally, Anti-Touma.

But they dont count because reasons! <br><br>You're laughable. And Mikoto is not a main character. She's a side character like Kuroko and Misaki are. You're a fucking delusional shipperfag. And you forgot Touma in NT9, the case that shits all over your argument.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying shiage's role isn't to simply wade into a situation and fuck everything up. <br>this is just like the fact that touma's job seems to simply be fix literally everything ever.</br></br>  Reminder that NT is just a very long story of a hero living long enough to see himself turn into a villain.

What's /a/ most attractive female. Personality doesn't count. Only looks.  That's not fair. Sexual attractiveness is not a series of sliders from worst to best. Personality and demeanor make up a large factor of sexiness.  <br>confirmed gay</br>  This caramel flavored female<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bz2<wbr>rOdYXf2o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>β</br>  <br>All of them, I fap to all of them.<br><br>Now wait for the DFC and cowtit lovers to go to war. I'll fap to that too.</br></br></br>  <br> What's /a/ most attractive female. Personality doesn't count. Only looks. <br>That's a highly subjective question and I'd say that personality is the deciding factor. Without something like personality to factor in you have likely hundreds of girls that are all equally attractive if not of the same body type.<br><br>Pic related, same basic body type and hair, but all very different.</br></br></br></br>  That's a tough question.<br>I'd go for Shinobu, she has 3 body types and all of them are pure sex.</br>  For me It has to be a slut or a bitch. Some people don't get it and call hottest to everything with pornstar body.  <br>Still the best.</br>  <br>As of this season I can finally say that the most attractive Anime Girl is Miia of Monster Musume.<br><br>There! I did it and it feels great. Best Summer ever!</br></br></br>    <br>backing away nice and slow...</br>  ryuko does things to my dick no other girl can do  <br>Mein nigga.</br>  This one.  I find holo attractive  <br>For you its probably this.<br><br> Fucking ant </br></br></br>  I have popped more boners to Mary and her vagina bones than any other anime character.

We haven't done discussing about how pointless shipping war is.  <br>I can't allow you to make the same mistake twice in a row.</br>  Can't wait for Iroha monologue in next Oregairu a.<br><br>I bet it's about how she shifted her attention to a certain sempai and feel dejected because he already had two best girls in school hold interested in him.</br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br> Late as fuck but whatever. </br></br>  <br>Last one violated rules.</br>  <br>Nah, it was just the last one because OP violated rules with NSFW stuff.</br>  <br>Like I haven't read enough of that in jap fanfics already.<br> I really hope it doesn't turn out like any of them </br></br>  Die, Yaharifags.  <br>You're losing your mojo</br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  Am I the only one who played this?  <br>Yeah I Am, slow threads are hard to predict.<br>At least I still get to read them.</br></br>  Hands guy got a rough deal in the anime. The LN was pretty sympathetic to him but in the anime he just seemed like a real life memeposting redditor<br><br>At least he tried to president by himself, unlike Iroha who runs to the nearest cock available before trying to save anything herself.<br><br>Hands deserves the Orimotob owl</br></br></br></br>  Why does Yui call Hikki gross all the time? I thought she had girl feelings for him.<br><br><br> Get's rejected by Hayama, most popular guy in existence <br> aims low next time <br> falls in love with a guy that already has two bombshells in love with him <br>Iroha will get hers soon, right? Maybe she is trying to steal him from them. I wonder if Iroha is trying to keep a low profile around them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do you think hacky Watari got his inspiration from? I bet he copied all the nice ideas in those fanfic into his novel.</br>  <br>Because it's her way of saying "I'm not into you, stop making passes at me"<br><br>Have you never seen "bubbly nice girl is in love with guy" anime before?</br></br></br>  <br> Get's rejected by Hayama, most popular guy in existence <br> aims low next time <br><br>this is a bait, right?</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's all right, I expected it honestly</br>  <br> Because it's her way of saying "I'm not into you, stop making passes at me" <br>So Yui doesn't want 8man making passes at her?<br><br><br>8man is aiming low.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui will never call you kimoi~ </br>  <br>It's two baits in one post.</br>  <br>Wow I'm not banned, the last time I posted NSFW I was<br>You could've been worse, thanks mods</br></br>  <br>Nope Orimoto took the transfer exams for Soubu. Now 8man and Orimoto will ride bikes together to school with Komachi in tow.</br>  Reminder that Oregairu will end with this scene.  <br> implying Iroha ever aim for cunt </br>  <br>No, I was relating it to what Iroha does<br><br>She likes him but is embarrassed by it</br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>It will happen one day.<br><br><br>Maybe she can join the service club and flirt with Hikigaya in front of Yui/Yukino all day.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying not this </br>  <br>Goddamn, spoiler that disgusting shit</br>   all these anons thinking Iroha is important whatsoever in the series after bringing StuCo problem so the Service Club's relationship could deepen. <br><br>Wake up guys, she's literally there just to attract waifufags</br></br>    <br>She confessed to him and explicitly stated that she likes Hayama. She hasn't done that for 8man.</br>  <br>She confessed to Hayama because she likes 8man</br>  <br> someone this dumb why she always appear after stuco election </br>  <br>Hell no. 8man will stop putting up with Yukino and Yui.<br>He'll make a new service club with Shizukawaii's help. He'll fill it up with black jack and hookers. IE Orimoto, Iroha, Saki, Miura, Ebina and  Komachi </br></br>  <br>Welcome to the family yukino-chan! you are almost as great as my daughter-in-law, Haruno-chan~</br>  <br> confessed with the intention being rejected <br> even cunt know she didnt truly like him </br></br>    <br>the one suffering will be yukino right?</br>  <br>Th..Thanks...Mother.</br>  <br>oh anon, you're as naive as Yui</br>  <br>could it be, you're dead on your feet and want to be put down captain?</br>  <br><br>That is supreme mental gymnastics. That doesn't make a lick of sense.</br></br>  <br>Just finished this shit last night thanks to you faggots, I haven't felt this empty inside in a while.<br><br>At least Yahari is safe from an ending this heartbreaking. Watari wouldn't do something like that,  r-right? </br></br></br>    <br>OTP</br>  <br>atleast she didn't pull a Yui<br> propose shit idea hoping it would work <br> get rejected <br> Lol I knew you'd reject it, I was just being retarded. <br><br>Iroha also knew that would never get enough points even if she was super serious about it, she knows how bad Yumiko's situation is.<br><br>Now she just has to rack up enough points with 8man, so she doesn't get rejected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That is supreme mental gymnastics <br>Welcome to Oregairu<br><br><br>He's going to knock it out of the park by going for an "everyone loved Hayama and was just using 8man to get close to him" ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, you are wrong anon.<br>Haruno will have the pleasure of meeting pic related.</br></br>  <br>Yui is tsundere.</br>  <br>Yui succeeded in making everyone be more genuine with their feelings. Yukino is going to open up and there will be a fair and not hurtful love triangle ahead.<br><br><br>Really? She has been pure unrefined dere for a while now.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Welcome to Oregairu <br><br>Now I am doubting the interpretation of the scene at s2 ep8 and final episode. Does anybody really felt the scene that way or everybody just eat up whatever explanation they get their hand on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>naive? or desesperate? I don't know anymore.</br>  How can anyone not be a Yuifag after seeing her 20 years in the future? She is going to age like wine.<br><br>I wonder if she wanted to talk to Hikki-kun because she wanted to see if Yui liked him.</br></br>  <br>Yui fans have always been naive AND desperate.</br>   Come back to 4chan after a week <br> Yahari Threads not dead yet. <br><br>Seriously...<br> Don't let it die! </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because there is more of love than the eyes.<br><br>You don't marry a vase, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit are you me? I also picked that up and finished it last night thanks to these faggots.</br>  <br> he doesnt know iroha already interested with 8man from this scene <br>iroha even stated in this episode she aim hayama for popularity only</br></br>  <br> Some random guy starts messaging Haruno on Facebook <br> She thinks it's he's pretty cute from the profile pics and genuinely enjoys the conversation <br> She gives in and finally asks to meet somewhere for coffee. <br> Online no one knows you're a truck <br><br><br> succeeded in making everyone be more genuine <br><br>all she did was force 8man to hit the reset button on the bullshit atmosphere again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because there is more of love than the eyes. <br>*Only in 2D</br></br>  <br>Because 8man is a denialfag.</br>  <br>I find her depressing. Not because she'll never be real but because she's pretty much the incarnation of a typical housewife. Somewhat like an amplified force of gravity she pulls you down and you can never escape. She is the enemy of ambition. Truly I feel sorry for Gahamma papa.</br>  <br>She used to be one at the very beginning when Watari hasn't even figured out what to do with his characters.</br>  <br>That was why 8man was invited over<br><br>Yui knows exactly what she's doing. The 8manb owl ended right then and there.</br></br></br>  <br>I did.<br>I was a Yukinofag.</br></br>  <br>Lies. She's always been a fake genki with low-self esteem. Reread/rewatch the cookie scene.</br>  Irohasu~~~  <br>The very definition of a tsundere is insecure person who can't admit their feelings and resort to violence, verbal or physical while fuming about it.<br><br>It's just that later we know why she kept her guard around 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>義理チョコはす～</br>  <br>are you retard?</br>  Posting a very rare pic.  <br><br>I have so many questions about Yahari unanswered which is why I am still in these threads looking for answers, but most of the posts I see is about shipping.</br></br>  <br>セーターはす～</br>  <br>asuna</br>  <br>Why does Totsuka-kun look more cute in girls' clothes, I wonder?</br>  <br>I mostly come here to shitpost and complain about characters not getting adequate anime screentime<br><br>What answers are you going to find here?</br></br></br>  So, let's review season 2:<br>Yukino became an even bigger bitch;<br>Komachi had a huge bitch moment, probably PMS (really hope for 8man she doesn't get this way every month, not even my own sister was this bad);<br>Yui is suffering continually while being ignored by 8man (his shittaste is palpable);<br>Sensei is useless as always, also she pushes 8man to sacrifice himself for Yukino;<br>Haruno turned totally chaotic evil for fucking real;<br>Saki basically disappeared;<br>Totsuka was empty and unimportant as much as he was in S1;<br>Zaimokuza was totally cut out from the anime while he was actually useful in the novels for once;<br>Hayama turned from a medium-level cunt to THE cunt;<br>Tobe is retarded as fuck, even more than what he let out;<br>Ebina isn't just a simple rotten girl;<br>Miura is better than expected;<br>Rumirumi striked back even more wonderful than before;<br>Megurin is comfy as fuck just as usual;<br>the new entry Iroha was way way way better than expected.<br>the other new entry Orimoto turned from a boss-level bitch to one of the most amazing wannabe allies;<br>finally, the true revelation of S2, without him there wouldn't have been any "comedy": TAMA-fucking-NAWA. The living meme.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no Ranpo Kitan with Totsuka as MC <br><br><br>tl;dr lots of actual character development and a lot of mildly forced drama</br></br></br></br>  <br>I usually came here for LN news and to kill time with the ship wars. <br><br>This /a/ after all you won't get many answers.</br></br></br>  <br>I was empty and unimportant, huh?</br>  <br>Yeah you could achieve more by just checking Spyro's blog</br>  <br>You can't fool me, no one is this retarded.</br>  <br>Why does she have an ahoge?</br>  <br>8mom and Yukimom are sisters</br>  <br><br> What answers are you going to find here? <br><br>Who wrote this? How does he do it? I sucked at reading people so I want to find the secret behind it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8man has an ahoge<br>Yukino has an ahoge<br>It was meant to be</br></br></br>  <br>You only served to some cheap laughs about 8man questioning his sexuality nothing else. Even Zaimokuza got a frienship moment with 8man.</br>  <br>Why did Yui shoo Yuimom away? Does Yui know that Yuimom knows that Yui love's Hikki-kun?<br><br>I wonder if Yuimom knows the extent of her daughter's affection for 8man. She probably thinks it is a simple crush but Yui seems to be in deep love with him.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is a domestic abuser, abusing her mom by forcefully shoving her out of the room<br>She doesn't deserve 8man</br></br>  <br>Because "go away mom you're embarrassing me in front of my buddies" is something every teenager goes through<br><br> well, I assume so at least. I never had any friends for my mom to embarrass me in front of </br></br></br>  Where's his left hand going?  <br>Komachi</br>  <br>8man see Yui as a dog.<br>Dogs show unconditional love to anyone.<br>Genuine love.<br><br>It was meant to be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino became an even bigger bitch <br><br>Wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuimom was embarrassing her by saying she talks about Hikki all the time. Yui couldn't even face 8man after that and looked toward Yuki when she said that Yuimom was excited to meet "you."</br>  <br>True.</br>  <br>8man = bear<br>Yukino = cat<br>bear + cat = panda --&gt; pan-san<br>8man has fish eyes<br>pan-san has fish eyes<br><br>Sorry, only genuine symbolism allowed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I had never expirience that. My friends become really shy in front of the family of other persons, I have more fun seein them struggle on how to act and avoid acting stupid.</br>  <br>On his sister's thigh.</br>  <br><br> “Sh-shut up!” Yuigahama’s face burned red in anger. A plastic bag and some greaseproof paper came flying my way. Even though she hit me, the fact that she chose things that wouldn’t hurt means she’s actually pretty nice. Wait…could that possible mean she likes me? Or was that just a joke? As if I could go through that experience again. <br><br>She was a tsundere, but at that point she is already a nice girl™ in 8man's monologues.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you say pan-san?</br>  <br> 8man <br> not a bat </br></br>    <br>It's time.</br>  Hourly reminder that  Isshiki resides in Hayama   <br> Yukinofags feel so threatened by Yui, to the point that they have to photoshop her out of every fan arts. <br><br>Gets me every time.</br></br></br>  why the fuck are you guys still shitposting when based spyro has finally delivered?<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/#p<wbr>art-3</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Hayama getting pegged by Iroha while he watches Haruno and 8man go at it confirmed.</br>  <br> Miura district. <br><br>You debunked your own point.</br></br></br>  <br>because I'm too busy reading manga on my other monitor to read the translated chapters</br>  <br>A single Yukinofag did that anon<br>How about I judge Yuifags for the  wait Yuifags still post here? that's a surprise I thought you turned into skellys a long time ago </br></br>  <br> she talks about Hikki all the time. <br>Do you really think Yui talks about Hikki that much?<br><br> Yuimom was excited to meet "you." <br>I didn't get that part because it is obvious Yukinon was an afterthought.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't the reason I made that shoop at all, I was simply having fun with PS.</br>  <br>I can´t belive no one had change their faces.</br>  <br>because I've already read Vol11</br>  <br>hyp</br>  <br>There was one with Yui's face but I didn't download it</br>  <br/>  YY times 2 getting BTFO by Gahamama. <br><br>Isn't it time 8man makes the right choice?</br></br>  <br>It's happening!</br>  <br> She placed her index finger to her chin and cutely tilted her head. “There’s like no school events around this time of the year and the VP’s taking care of all the small stuff for me. All I have left is just to stamp our year-end report.” <br> finger to her chin and cutely tilted her head <br> and cutely tilted <br> cutely <br>Iroha end confirmed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, now I can shitpost with that one instead</br>  <br>Nobody cares about the LN.<br>We are all animeonlyfags.</br></br>  <br> &gt;she talks about Hikki all the time. <br> Do you really think Yui talks about Hikki that much? <br>It's literally what Yuimom said.<br><br> I didn't get that part because it is obvious Yukinon was an afterthought. <br>Yui said that to Yukino because she was too embarrassed to look at 8man after what Yuimom said.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Guys I don't know if the time is right. The mods just killed the last thread. I don't think they're asleep yet.  <br>Talk for yourself.</br>  NO! NO! NO!<br>Irohafags starting to shitpost again!<br>What should we do?</br></br>  <br>Reading biased translations by a Yukinofag</br>  <br>I believe your theory is a little flawed</br>  <br> It's literally what Yuimom said. <br>I thought that was parent talk.<br><br>I guess she doesn't want to let on she is madly in love with him? The only person who never noticed it was Yukino and even she got the message.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Compared to most LN series the % of us that have read the source material is probably pretty high<br><br>Most LNs are very poorly translated</br></br></br>  <br>All I'm getting from this is Yukino really doesn't like Iroha.</br>  <br>I wonder why, I thought she would be happy to have another girl around.</br>   Hmm, that’s funny, the chest that’s puffing out looks a lot smaller… Is the perspective off or something? In any case, I’ll go ahead and request that be fixed for the Blu-Rays! <br><br>Hachiman's monologue for Yui, Chapter 1.<br><br>What happened, Yuifags?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought that was parent talk. <br>It could be. But either way, Yui pushed Yuimom out of the room for the same reason.</br></br>  <br>Of course she doesn't. She's trying to NTR her hard since 3 volumes already. Yui is too much of a nice girl, somebody needs to stop her, after all.  I still hope she'll win the 8manbowl though, those 2 doesn't deserve the 8incher. </br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1278155 <br><br> That attitude caused me to make a bitter smile. <br> Isshiki, her behavior, and her speech were charming, but there were several reasons why her actions didn’t affect me all that much in the present. Had I been myself from long ago, I’d lose my wits within the instant, no doubt about it. <br><br> didn’t affect me all that much <br><br>Iroha end deconfirmed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is not as if Yuimom would ask if he was going out with Yui or anything. Maybe she would have asked if he had a GF or if he liked older women.</br>  <br> Komachi had a huge bitch moment, probably PMS (really hope for 8man she doesn't get this way every month, not even my own sister was this bad); <br>Do not remind me. I still can't believe there's people who dare to compare her to Miya or Mikan.</br></br>  <br> says the Yukinofag </br>  <br>Watari is pissed that FEEL removed Yui's yui.</br>  <br>how can you NTR someone that isn't in a relationship?</br>  <br>God I'd love to see how a conversation between Yuimom and 8man plays out.</br>   Isshiki coughed to check her throat, sent me a single upwards glance, and immediately looked away. <br><br> She tightly gripped one hand at the bosom of her uniform while the other weakly trembled and adjusted her skirt. With moist eyes, the breaths she let out were hot. <br><br> Then, she spoke in fragments. <br><br> “Do you hate… younger girls?” <br><br> I…… do not! Yeah! If you had to ask, I absolutely loved them! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No not really, if I remember correctly, Iroha is like a sister (or just a kouhai) to her, she spoils Iroha as much as 8man does. This is stated later in the novel, just wait for it.</br>  <br>Miya had a pretty fucked-up reaction in one of the game's bad endings, though.</br>  <br> yomiuri giants </br>  <br>Don't think 8man wants to be a bear anymore.</br>  <br>No! I'm saying that I don't get the chance to shitpost because Volume 11 doesn't contain much for us.</br>   Yuigahama tapped her hands. “Oh, but hey, Hikki seems like he’d be compatible with an older girl, for sure…! I think, definitely.” <br><br> She squeezed her fist, putting a lot of strength into it. But I certainly didn’t have that obsession, yes. <br><br>where is your god now, Yuifags.</br></br></br></br>   I found myself nodding in conjunction with Isshiki, and we somehow looked like a couple <br> :^) </br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br>It was said in context of Haruno.<br>Harunofags BTFO!<br> Are there any Harunofags left? </br></br></br>  <br> Irohafags selective reading <br><br> “…That’s not really applicable here. If we’re talking about a year gap, it’s not that big of a difference.” <br><br>Your ship has already sunk.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   そういえばこいつ後輩なんだよな、一応……。一色の俺への態度って敬意と<wbr>か尊崇とか尊敬とかリスペクトとかその辺の感情がまるっと抜け落ちているお<wbr>かげで、ちよっと後輩感薄まるんだよな……。</wbr></wbr> <br> Speaking of which, she’s a year younger, isn’t she…? It certainly didn’t feel that way because she didn’t show the least amount of respect, honor, respect, and respect towards me, so she didn’t feel like an underclassman at all… <br><br> 3x respect <br><br>what is this? Google translate?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> “…You seem rather informed.” Yukinoshita smiled firmly. Though it’s closer to the smile of Nikkari Aoe than just a pleasant smile, so there was a transparent feeling of pressure oozing from it. <br><br>Yukino is not very happy this chapter.<br>Also no idea who Nikkari Aoe really is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>English is a shitty language.</br>  <br>I played it a few years ago, and I don't remember anything related to what the heck you're talking about.<br>Komachi is still a shitty sister, though.</br></br>  <br>She'll win him over through strength of determination one day.

I must have forgotten she went to Yukinon's to spend the night. Tee hee~." Clonks her bonker and makes a winky face with her tongue sticking out. <br> "I think I should head home then." <br> "Oh, but you just got here. At least have some Max Coffee™ and sweets." <br> "Well she already laid some snacks in Yui's room and who can pass up on free Max Coffee™." He thought.

Besides the fact that it'd be wrong for me to sleep in a girl's room at her parent's house, I don't think I can fall asleep anytime soon after all that Max Coffee™." <br> "Then I'd think you should spend some time trying some these snacks. I guarantee you, you won't be able to get up after trying a couple of these. These are my favorite and I have something more satisfying to suck on." <br> She undoes the ribbon on the front of her teddy allowing her Yuigamamas to freely hangout as she tears open one of the square wrappers. <br>Drinking Max Coffee™ will get you laid.

Are those the discussion you wished for,  kun?<br><br> Read that in Haruno's voice, bitches </br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone else totally see the love triangle coming?  <br>I honestly believe Irohafags make YYfags butthurt enough to have actual discussions.</br>  <br>Read  anon.<br>It pretty much describes Yukino's thoughts and development.</br></br>  <br> Those are the lyrics to the OP, Anon. </br>  <br>Yes, that's right. Yukino also took advantage of Iroha's question to determine 8man's thoughts on younger girls (she is younger than him).<br><br> “The problem is what qualifies someone as younger. Their school year? Birthday? Are they younger if their birthday is somewhat early…? The definition’s rather vague. I believe we should sort that out first, don’t you think?” Yukinoshita said, blabbering on. <br><br>Yukino usually blabbers when she is going dere dere.</br></br></br></br></br>   “After all, we’re dealing with boys here who know absolutely nothing about handmade sweets. So, handmade chocolates is a piece of cake. It doesn’t cost much to make a lot and you can add your finishing touches by customizing each one to your liking. The boys will be all over them.” <br> Isshiki placed the tip of her finger on her lips to think and opened her mouth. <br><br>“Actually, that would put me over my budget.”<br><br>“I don’t know exactly how much you plan on making, but you’re under a rather severe budget if you’re limiting yourself to less than 130 yen a piece…” Yukinoshita said in disbelief, rubbing her temple. That, however, wasn’t a concern.<br><br>Poorfag detected</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of the good days.........</br>  <br>Why would Yukino care about 8man's preferences in girls?</br>  <br><br><br>But it's not actual discussion, right?<br>Just proxies.<br><br>Stop hiding your thought behind the quotes. Voice your own opinion. Write your own sentence. It won't genuine otherwise.<br><br> Just joking, trying to mimic Haruno/Sensei's tone for once. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wants to know so she can be the best effective platonic friend she can be for him.</br>  <br> Irohafags calling any otherfags denial <br><br>Ebin meme :D</br></br></br>  <br>this is bait right, denial-kun?</br>  <br>Don't know anon.

God damn it.</br>  <br>Haru: spring</br>  <br><br>Thank you!</br></br>  <br><br>I was severely disappointed when she wasn't the focus of the last episode.</br></br>  <br>I'm a Haruno guy myself, but all she did was throw ambiguous insults that don't make sense and annoy some high schoolers trying to learn about each other. She needs to get a life, and grow some patience too. Hikigaya made the genuine speech like only a few weeks ago, you can't rush these things you dumb bitch. Also she talked about how the <br>"old" Yukino was better, and she needed to get ahold of her future. What the fuck? Isn't Yukino like an in-story super genius? Piss off ya dumb broad.</br></br>  <br> いくつかの理由で今の俺にはあまり効果が上がらない <br><br>I'm pretty sure I know moon more than any of you fag here does. <br><br>さすが一色廚、キチガイすぎるｗｗｗｗ<br>妄想ならチラシの裏にでも書いておけｗｗｗｗ<br><br><br>Nope, didn't happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant it more as Haruno winning the 8bowl or atleast becoming an official contender, she made an odd expression before Yui ruined it.<br><br>Besides that, Haruno is right and knows what she's doing. But what she's doing is inherently wrong. She wants Yukino to be her own person, but Yukino can't be her own person if there's someone else pulling her strings.<br><br>The best thing I can think for Yukino is for everyone to abandon her or stick her on the moon to mine 03</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ohhh, so that's her deal. She's trying to change Yukino, when that's something a person needs to do themselves. Also. Haruno a contender? Pretty sure she's getting a Hayama ending.</br>  <br><br><br>I can't believe some people are really that stupid/dense.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Me too. I was planning on watching this as well thanks to the faggots in these B2B threads.<br><br>Sounds like I shouldn't though.<br><br>Please spoil this for me. What the fuck happens because it sounds like an NTR ending and thats just nope fuck nope.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch it, no NTR ending at all. It's just a meme.</br>  <br>Calm down anon. He indeed does keep going "past me would have fallen for this shit" a lot.<br>I believe that the scene that anon was referring to was this one ('secret' cookies).</br></br>  <br>Thanks for proving my point though</br>  <br><br>It is pretty logical conclusion that Iroha will win. But that will happen only if Iroha is interested in 8man. From what I feel she as interested in 8man as Saki is, maybe a lil bit tad more, but she never sees 8man as a bf material.</br></br>  <br>Nobody 80%<br>Yukino 10%<br>Yui 8%<br>Iroha 2%</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Iroha is poorfag Taiga you know. She keeps falling for 8man even when her love interest is Hayama. The hints were dropped here and there, but not that obvious like the Irohafags try to appear.</br>  <br>8man's onii-chan instincts will bait Iroha into out-slying him.<br>Out-slying 8man increases his exposure to Iroha, which triggers his onii-chan instincts.<br><br>And his walls are slowly coming down with each interaction and her rejections aren't as loaded as they used to be.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui is suffering continually while being ignored by 8man <br><br>Except that she wasn't. It was just that being with Yui is always digging 8man's trauma. So he always seems to brush her off. But it also means that he is being conscious on her.</br></br></br>   Pure Kaori being with that loser. <br>No.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you still here?</br>  Alright anons, I want 5 page essay with at least 10 quotes.

I just fixed the hole in my socks earlier!" </br>  <br>Yukino. Because of vol 1 cover girl.<br>Yui. Because she is the only girl 8man consider to cross the line with (vol 6, later been reinforced in vol 9).<br><br>And vol 7 basically says that 8man always says whatever words easily towards anybody he doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is that the only Irohasu doujin? Is she actually unpopular?</br>  <br>It's not the only one. There are three total as far as I'm aware of.</br>  <br>Wait for Comiket</br>  いろはす～  <br>The next episode is coming up this sunday right? <br><br> The tension and sheer bullshitery is fucking killing me if they are going to say something fucking say it. I hate this cocking and dancing around a perfectly prevalent issue thats right in front of them. </br></br></br>  <br>It actually takes quite a bit of time to draw shit you know? She's pretty popular in Japan last I checked. In one of the LN polls she was barely outside of the top ten and that was only after volume 8, in other words that was even before she got all of her major scenes.<br><br>So her popularity really isn't even an issue in this case. <br><br>So it's best just to wait for Comiket since it's unlikely that any will be shown before that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari doesn't have much doujin to begin with. also, this <br><br>Also, anyone know how  8man  smells like?</br></br></br>  <br>Condensed milk</br>  <br>Corn chips</br>  <br> Because she is the only girl 8man consider to cross the line with <br>You're late.</br></br>  <br>Given how it's written the author clearly intends to have Yukino win.

I was quelling the shipping war and look at what you've done.

I think she loves him but love is defined differently for everyone.<br> Is Yukino autistic/love 8man? <br>No, and my answer for Yukino is pretty much the same as Yui.<br> Is Iroha a slut/love 8man? <br>No, and she's definitely interested in 8man but it's not what I'd call love yet.<br> Is Hayama a nice-guy/cuck? <br>Hayama is basically the genderswapped definition of a nice girl by 8man, and I have no idea what his sexual preferences are.<br> Is Haruno Hitler? <br>She's the hero we need. She saved this series multiple times now.<br> Is Sensei literally worse than Hitler? <br>She takes the most sensible approach. She guides instead of directing. Teaches them to fish instead of giving them fish. She gives them the freedom to make their own mistakes but guides them down the path to achieving their goals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Hayama is basically the genderswapped definition of a nice girl by 8man <br><br>Isn't that Saika?<br><br> She saved this series multiple times now. <br><br>By save you mean instilling drama?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  w-what happened last thread? I went to sleep and dead  <br>Mods happened, what did you expect with that kind of opening image?</br>  I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?   We returned to the conference room and Yuigahama subjected me to a lecture on the exhibition. <br><br> The standard requirements like the needed equipment, the number of people, how the allotted budget was used and considerably abstract things like the purpose of the exhibition and a synopsis were all jotted down. Moreover, we were even required to map out a blueprint, something I could’ve glossed over had the entire thing required text only. <br><br> Talk about incredibly bothersome. <br><br> “I said that’s wrong! Make it, you know, more booooom! The props are going to be really flashy, okay!” <br><br> “I don’t get it…” <br><br> It wasn’t that drawing the diagram was incredibly bothersome, but trying to make sense of Yuigahama was. <br><br> Why were her explanations always so melodramatic…? It’s incomprehensible to the point scary. <br><br> “Also, you also assigned the wrong number of people there.” <br><br> “How humiliating… To be taught by Yuigahama of all people…” <br><br> “What was that? Whatever, hurry up and fix it!” <br><br> As I was guided under an unexpected strictness, I scribbled my pencil against the paper and we somehow made some progress. <br><br>It's amusing to see Yui bossing 8man like this scene.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure anon<br><br> Yukino copycat the feeling of Yui for 8man. <br><br>And I'm damn sure Yui likes 8man.<br><br>Therefore Yukino also likes 8man.<br><br>QED<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br><br>She is not sure of her own feeling too due to the lack of interaction with other human previously.<br><br>Proof that she likes 8man? She was planning to give her hand-made cookies to 8 man until Haruno intervened. Also she regret not giving it to 8man when she saw Yui gave her very own hand-made cookies to 8man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No she doesn't. <br>She loves Hayama.</br></br>  <br><br> copycat <br><br>Why do you assume that she copycat?</br></br></br></br>  Is this the new 2deep4u series?Feels like every time I see people talk about not liking it online, some fan comes and says that they just aren't "getting it".  <br> assume <br><br>did you really watch episode 13?</br></br></br>  This shit is so filled with vague navelgazing and empty dialogues that its no surprise that you idiots think it's good. It also let's all of you tards project whatever dumb fantasy you have because it just drags itself on with never really committing to anything and stretching what little developments are happening to ridiculous lengths.  <br><br>Yes and I think this explanation here is mostly correct. I don't find anything else left unexplained.</br></br>  <br>This show made me realize that i'm harem mc-tier dense.</br>  <br>But the chocospoon</br>  Why isn't there an "Absolutely Kimoi" pic yet  <br> until Haruno intervened </br>  <br> It’s incomprehensible to the point scary. <br><br>Whose translation it is?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think those are empty dialogues. I admit that I don't understand most of what the character says, but I get the general atmosphere of the show. I felt something horribly wrong with 8man since S1. <br><br>E.g. The Sagami rooftop scene. I don't know why 8man said that to Sagami, but what he said was not wrong. I don't understand why everyone(characters in the show and also /a/ in general) overreacted on his action on the rooftop but I still feel that something is off.<br><br>Since I don't know shit about what the characters are spouting but my guts tell me they are behave like normal human in a crisis I decided to dig into these threads to find out what each character's word really means.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> YUI WHERE ARE YOU GOING YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE AND BE MY SUPPORT, EVEN THOUGH YOU WERE ACTING CONSIDERATE AND GIVING ME A MOMENT TO BE ALONE WITH 8MAN </br>  <br><br>Well it is awkward with Yui at the scene but I still feel that in her heart, it is 50/50 whether she wanna give 8man that cookie. The appearance of Haruno reduced the chance to 0.</br></br>  Why does Yukino have everything and still doesn't solve her problem? Everyone is trying to help her but she won't open up to no one.<br><br>On the other hand, Iroha is in similar situation but she sucked it up and face it mostly by herself.</br></br>  <br> I still feel that in her heart <br><br>Okay</br></br></br>  <br>This scene transcended autism</br>  <br> Yukino <br> heart </br></br>  Why was Yukino so cringe and retarded on the last episode?  <br> Yukino <br> Give </br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> wanna </br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> mortal </br></br>  <br><br>At least she's following the conversation. Put you in her situation you won't even know what to say.</br></br>  <br>Her defenses have been completely shattered. Around 8man she doesn't know how to act.<br>She's likely trying to be herself but she has no idea what herself is. In other words she's put into a situation she doesn't have an answer to.<br><br>I imagine in Volume 12 she'll fix this problem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Expecting a "character development" and study abroad</br>  <br><br> 3 years later <br> Everyone studying in college <br><br>What will be the epilogue of Oregairu?</br></br></br></br></br>      <br> GIF </br>  <br>Fine.</br>  <br>Yukino goes study abroad.<br>Yui goes to some famous school (don't ask me why)<br>8man studies in a local school, together with Zaimokuza and Totsuka. Kawanantoka-san too.<br><br>Hayama and Miura become a couple.<br><br>Tobe got interested in 2D worlds.  He loves yuri.  He and Ebina got more closer, but not be a couple yet.<br><br>Haruno take over her parents business and get married to a wealthy handsome young man.  She doesn't like him, though. So she still comes teasing 8man now and then. <br><br>Sensei finally has some fiance,  he is a school teacher. <br><br>Komachi are applying to 8man's university.<br><br>Did I miss someone?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Did I miss someone? <br>Your English teacher</br></br>  8man will die.<br><br>But his soul will chose to go back in time, the the time when he was happiest, and he will be at season 1 first episode.<br><br>Yui who loves 8man want to be with him too and want to be in a time when 8man'd love her, but since he already loves Yukino she'll go back in time before 8man is born, and became his mother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How... how did you know that I'm a ESLfag?</br>  Hayato x Yukino end for perfect babies  <br><br>Not him but it is quite obvious. You may want to read through what you typed again before you hit the "post" button next time.</br></br>    <br>Anyway, it's obvious to anyone read the novel that Iroha will follow Haruno's step. Since she was a school president, recommendation was piece of cake, and she is fond of managing money, too. I don't know if she still come to visit 8man, or waiting some years later and force him to marry into her family (yes I'm referring to that Isshiki Hachiman wooden piece).<br><br> Sorry for the awkward english cruel EO faggots. </br></br></br>  <br>He was obviously lying when he said no.</br>  <br><br> a yes man <br> another is repressive and self loathing on her failure <br><br>I don't even know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know.

She will accept, maybe they share a kiss. She will go home happy, go to sleep happy, and wake up happy. Then the day next he pretends none of it happened.

Her inclined head and her eyes urged me to go on. Seeing her straight-on was somewhat dazzling that I slightly averted my face. <br> “…Do you have a day you’re free on soon?” <br> “Huh? U-Um, yeah, I do… I think, “ Yuigahama said, prattling on and moving her hands in surprise. She fidgeted as she frantically took out her cellphone. But then, her movements abruptly stopped. <br> She shot a glance to the door of the club. After that, she had trouble bringing out her voice. And unlike earlier, her expression sank. <br> I was slightly surprised to see that and hesitated to ask why she was making that face, finding myself choking as well. The air in the hallway was awfully cold and dry that I had an uneasy sensation as if something was stuck in my throat. <br> Asking her that now in this place might’ve not been the best choice. Or perhaps, there might’ve been a better or smoother way to do so. Would it be weird to ask again? I just wasn’t confident in any of those. <br> Unable to exchange any more words, I glanced at her face, my back still slumped and my eyes downcast. The problematic smile that she wore caused me to lose my breath. <br> To fill up the silence, Yuigahama quickly said, “Let me think about it and I’ll tell you later!” <br> “…Y-Yeah.” <br> Was I relieved or just exhausted? Perhaps, something much more different? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>director has goodtaste</br>  Is Yui still in love with 8man? In previous threads some anons were arguing she wasn't.

That's a horrible resolution, try again.  I'm watching it right now, I'm at episode 15.<br><br>I like it. Kaori is a cutie and the characters are all good, but god damn the amount backstory and flashbacks while the guys are playing are fucking annoying. There are other ways to show the backstory and I'd rather listen to the fucking music.<br><br>Also, picture for ants. Stop fucking up, OP.</br></br></br></br>  More like you die in April  Pretty good, better than the manga since you actually get to hear the music.  <br>Pretty much everyone here agrees it's bad, and I don't agree with them. It's not terrible or bad, it's just average or mediocre.<br><br>See, leaving the whole "it's popular so we don't like it" meme aside. It's poorly written, characters are boring and they keep them floating with melodrama.<br>The plot is normal I guess but instead of focusing on music they keep focusing on the cheap melodrama. Focusing on music a bit would be better<br> oh she's dying! <br>'k I don't care, her character has no personality aside from being sick. <br><br>Seriously it's like i'm watching a soap opera trying to force "feels" out of me every second.<br><br>Also the end<br> I always liked you but I lied I liked your friend 'cause I was dying teheee~ <br>How retarded is that? It's like the author wanted them to be a couple somehow so he/she just put that in there so that people would cry and say <br> Oh they would have been a couple!  <br> She was always in love with him but didn't tell him for his sake! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127809286 <br>Fucking HELL MAN!!!!</br>  <br>People on /a/ have shit taste. This show is at least a 8/10.</br>  <br>Why? Because it tries to force feelings out of people with cliches? How that makes it a fucking 8?</br>  <br>I agree with this post, mostly, except that I don't think Shigatsu is a bad anime, it's quite decent most of the time, when it's not trying to force melodrama and is mostly about a guy overcoming his trauma through music. That's why the second part of it is so awful. He already overcame the trauma with his mother so obviousdly the writers had to milk this shit and started to force muh sad stories. Also I fucking hated the childhood friend girl, can't even remember her name. And the end was godawful. But the entire thing on average was okay, good first part with great conclusion, awful second part. <br>Awful girls too, except the other girl that played piano. She was fine.</br></br>  <br>Its funny how the manga is kinda ugly, but the anime uses the designs almost exactly and everything turned out beautifully.<br><br>I cried like a bitch</br></br></br>  AOTY. It was really fun to watch even though it was cliche'd as hell  <br> so obviousdly the writers had to milk this shit <br><br>They could have milked it way harder if they really wanted. It's a short series. I was actually hoping for more to do with the rivals.<br><br>It also didn't pull the almost impossible miracle out of its ass for a happy ending, which is a change from the norm</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127809286 <br>Spoiler you dirty nigger, why did I even come into this fucking thread?</br>  still mad  I usually like these types of stories but this one was not good.<br><br>Characters being middle schoolers completely kills any real sense of drama especially given the seriousness of some of the issues. A kid with serious PTSD should not be pushed into facing his trauma by his fucking friends. The whole first half just felt really stupid because of this. It's one thing to have the usual friends helping MC get better cliche but it's a whole another issue when the MC is facing some serious psychological issues and the anime just glosses it over as something you get over because muh kaori. <br><br>The characters aside from MC's childhood friend were also really not that well fleshed out. It wasn't a bad anime but it could've been so much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so, better or worse than Nodame Cantabile?</br>  <br>it was meh</br>  <br>Shigatsu didn't have to go to France to make me care about it. It's objectively better.</br>  It falls somewhere in the middle of how much /a/ hates it and how much other places love it.  <br> It also didn't pull the almost impossible miracle out of its ass for a happy ending <br>It did the complete opposite, it forced  Kaori to die  so that Kousei (MC) could finally "grow", because for some reason, as stated by his aunt, he needed to lose someone else to evolve, which didn't make any sense.</br></br>  <br>They were third year middle schoolers in japan, so about highschool freshmen here. It was about right with the retardation of freshmen, but with the retardation of being Japanese on top of it.<br><br>Also japan's stance in general on mental health issues</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck no. Nodame is miles ahead of this in quality.</br>  It's okay.<br><br>I generally liked MC and his development, but Kaori just seemed like a plot device and her death flags were evident since episode 2 or someshit. Though some of the comedy did crack a smile, it felt very awkward and frequently broke pace of the show.<br><br>I also was driven insance by the soliloquies each character would have during the piano performances. It felt unnecessary and didn't let the show speak for itself. Melodrama being melodrama I guess. Last episode was nice though.</br></br></br></br>  anything to watch after seeing it?  <br> QUALITY </br>  OP1 was the best thing about it and all of last year  I hated the MC  <br> Though some of the comedy did crack a smile <br><br>This was really bad. Some of the comedy was just very ill-timed. The general transition between comedy and drama was off for the majority of the anime.</br></br></br>  The flesh of the walrus is succulent and sweet, but it's cruelty knows no bounds.  <br>You mean ED 1, now that's the fucking shit right there.</br>  <br>Did you read the rest of that sentence before posting?</br>  <br>I did. I was agreeing with you. I just forgot to include the rest of it in greentext.</br>  <br>Keep watching the last episode until you become numb to feelings.</br>  <br> AOTY <br> cliche'd as hell <br>pick one only.</br></br></br>  <br> being this easy to please. </br>  <br>Determining the quality of animation is always compared to other shows during its time dumbass. Of course shigatsu would be more visually appealing, It was just out a 2 seasons ago. No anime's quality can withstand the test of time.</br>  <br>Even back then, it looked like shit.</br>  the show was mediocre melodrama but the first OP was GOAT<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IeJ<wbr>TNN8_jLI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  I really liked it, but I'm a sucker for piano/orchestra anime. I wanted the younger blonde girl to win.<br><br><br>2nd ED was better, but I loved them both.</br></br></br>  <br>It was shit. The whole situation was way too young for them. It's cliché and I'd rather have different classical music besides always playing Chopin. The writing was extremely bad and too many people think this travesty is good. 4.3/10 <br><br>Should I watch Nodame?</br></br></br>  <br>Only the first season is good, the rest are JC Staff abominations</br>  I liked it. I was pleasantly surprised how they came out right away and explained why he couldn't play the piano. Usually in anime they would keep it a mystery and there would be like 12 episodes of "please tell me about your dark and secret past" "no, I can't, it's too dark and secret" and then after they repeat this for a bunch of episodes they finally come clean, and that's what I thought they were going to do, and was very glad they didn't. <br><br>It has beautiful music, some incredibly impressive art, and Tsubaki really stole the show in later episodes. That part where Kosei tells her at the beach that he's leaving was beautiful.</br></br>  Great example of a modern tragedy done right.  <br>Nice bait</br>  <br> Should I watch Nodame? <br>Yes.<br><br>I've watched all the anime, the dramas, and the movies. Loved them all.</br></br></br></br>  Lesser Nodame.  <br> he thinks it's bait </br>  <br>I wish they addressed the child abuse a bit more.<br><br>It still seems like none of mc's friends knew he was getting his ass beat every day</br></br></br>  I liked it very much. One of the better anime as of recent.<br>Also the performances were awesome, especially the last one.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Tsubaki knew. She was terrified of Kousei's mom.</br>  <br>That would require them to address the fact that Kaori pretty much = Kousei's mom in that aspect.</br>  <br>They were making the parallels at the end. Confused the fuck out of the friends though</br>  <br>I really liked it. Watch it if you think you'll like it too, OP.</br>  <br>LISTEN TO THIS MAN RIGHT HERE</br>  Say what you want, but you can't deny that this show was beautifully crafted. <br>It was definitely an experience I'll never forget.</br>  More like Your Cry in April<br>But honestly it was okay. I liked it because I like piano based anime and romantic feel goodness with a dash of tragedy.</br>  <br>It's okay, but it tries way to god damned hard. The first half of the last episode was great though.</br>  <br>The Poor man Cantabile.</br>  <br>It should have been 1 cour, and finish on episode 13, everything after episode 13 was so fucking retarded, I feel ashamed for cry on episode 13, and the girl dying, that is the most pointless part of the series, could have been an OVA to explain the lie on april.</br>  <br> muh gus jaus <br>Fuck off.<br><br>Ok sorry, I always hear the same shit, that this series was good only for the OP, and people going "awwww ;_; no more gus jaus, why im wtaching this series now", also second OP was way better.<br>1 ED &gt; 2 OP &gt; 2 ED &gt; 1 OP</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not actually, by the time the ending came, I have already lost any interest on the series, I was more focused in the player run time so I could finish it already.</br>  <br>I dropped it because its the same old drama. The only thing interesting was the music part... but then its the same old shit again. So I dropped it altogether.</br>  <br> what did /a/ think of this? <br>lets see. <br>the director doesn't know music at all and it shows (BADLY)<br>a better classical music based romance would be Nodame Cantabile<br>NTR everywhere<br>main girl is a compulsive liar<br>best girl gets friendzoned <br>Key AIDS<br>forced drama<br><br>yeah, it was shit on every level</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're one of the few Real niggas ITT</br>  <br> He already overcame the trauma with his mother so obviousdly the writers had to milk this shit and started to force muh sad stories.  <br><br>I understand why the author did it though. It was to test his resolve by putting him back in a similar situation, especially since this one was so fresh. Him getting over it would signify that he had grown up as a person as he would not go back to who he was in the beginning. <br><br>In this kind of story, it had to be done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A kid with serious PTSD should not be pushed into facing his trauma by his fucking friends.  <br><br>This I agree with the most. I don't know if the author quite understands PTSD, but I thought what his friends did to him was quite awful. It would have made him push back from music even more. He would have needed professional help and all the adults abandoning him when he would need them most is also quite awful.</br></br></br>  hate her stupid lips. Other than that, it's just poorly written. And holy shit their forced attempt at comedy is unfunny.  <br> No anime's quality can withstand the test of time. <br>There are plenty of shows that still look great decades after their release, fluid animation doesn't age. Also, the last season of Nodame was only 5 years ago, you're not exactly talking about early transition from cel to digital here.</br></br>  Major has better drama, a fucking spokon  <br>/a/ dropped this early on<br>had pretty much no threads<br>some faggot made a thread for the final ep then retards from veddit/mal/etc came in and posted like /a/ gave a shit about it<br>most people posting about it now are whiners from elsewhere</br></br></br></br>  I enjoyed the experience despite all the cliches, forced drama and unrealistic character development. Animation was nice, and the characters can be charming at times. While the dramatic moments left much to be desired, I really liked it when things were calm and subdued.  Can someone explain anything good about this anime? (No Sarcasm)<br><br>I actually don't understand. Pardon my ignorance since i got sick of its shit after 2 episodes.</br></br>  <br>Watch it yourself and find out.</br>  RIP  Dozo   I just watched it last week, and it was excellent.  <br> uses 'shit' as a constructive critic <br>gtfo</br></br>  <br>If you couldn't tolerate the cliches in the first 2 episodes, that's a pretty good sign you won't like the rest because the cliches only get worse after the halfway point. <br>Give it a miss.</br></br>  <br>It might honestly be, not the worst anime I've seen, but my least favorite, because the ways in which it was shit and the way people praise it basically gets all my pet peeves. It went for cheap emotion and didn't bother to put much effort into either its characters or its plot, and it gets praised for it. It was a low-effort mess that passed itself off as a thoughtful tragedy, and that just gets me mad.</br>  <br>I bet you used the term "death-flag" unironically past the 11th episode.</br>  <br>There are tropes and there are clichés. Since I'm pretty convinced you don't know what either of those things are, why don't you name some of these "clichés".</br>  <br>Good drama, but it seems that people think the story is more than just about the mc overcoming his problems.<br>Also the lip thing is very bad.</br></br>  <br>/a/ is not one person.<br>You're an idiot for saving a thumb nail.<br>The show is NTR shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind the art style so much, I can appreciate how shoujo-inspired it feels. But since not all art is for everybody I guess this is a very subjective point to make.<br><br><br>How is this NTR? The two main characters loved each other up until the end before  she died , and even then Kousei ends up with  the childhood friend  after she confesses anyway. Who is the victim?</br></br></br></br>  <br> saving YouTube screenshots </br>  <br> saving all pictures to disk <br> not direct-linking from Google Images </br></br>  It was good. Not perfect by any means. Comedy was out of place. <br><br>But my biggest issue with the show was their age. 14 years old and they're spitting out shit like they're 40 (fuck are those monologues??)<br><br>If it were set when kousei was 22-24 and in a more professional environment (perhaps in a college?), and targeted to a more mature audience (no comedy, no bullshit with childhood friend) it would be a masterpiece. Moreso the monologues will actually fucking make sense coming from older characters.<br><br> Piano prodigy Arima Kosei dominated the competition and all child musicians knew his name. But after his mother, who was also his instructor, passed away, he had a mental breakdown while performing at a recital that resulted in him no longer being able to hear the sound of his piano even though his hearing was perfectly fine. Even two years later, Kosei hasn't touched the piano and views the world in monotone, and without any flair or color. He was content at living out his life with his good friends Tsubaki and Watari until, one day, a girl changed everything. Miyazono Kaori is a pretty, free spirited violinist whose playing style reflects her personality. Kaori helps Kosei return to the music world and show that it should be free and mold breaking unlike the structured and rigid style Kosei was used to. <br><br>That synopsis with the setting I laid out, it would be so good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This guy is right. Very few people cared about the show on /a/. It was just like ore monogatari threads from last/this season, there were very few people and the occasional 'Is anybody still watching this shit' in every thread.<br><br>As for me, I dropped this shit on the ep they hit MC with a ball or whatever, he is fucking bleeding but his friends only get there to abuse him even more. That must be one of the worse comedy scenes of all time.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't use that term specifically. What came to mind was "and of course there's a dying girl."<br>I still enjoyed the show, at least considerably more so than the commenters here. <br><br><br>I admit I used the term poorly. If you want me to be more clear about it, there are elements in the show that many viewers have a problem with because they are mistakenly held up as shining examples of good story telling and/or characterisation, even though those elements may be overused or frequently used poorly in fiction.<br>Tropes and cliches may not be bad per se, but like it or not, some people have a problem with them regardless of whether or not they are handled well. That anon said he couldn't stomach the first two episodes. I replied that if his problem was the cliches, then he likely won't stomach the rest of the show given that there are other "cliches" that are less tolerable.<br>Again, I admit I used the term "cliches" poorly. Perhaps I should've said, "well if you couldn't stomach the idea of an MC so traumatised he can't hear the sound of his piano playing, nor of a special girl entering and adding color to his life, then you might be less tolerant of the MC being manipulated into dealing with his PTSD by being forced to play in front of a large audience, being cured by the power of love and by coming to terms with the death of his mother, and having his whole world turned upside down when he finds out the girl who gave him strength is going to disappear, thus reintroducing turmoil into his life."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It didn't try to force anything.<br>It's not their fault you are dead inside and not capable of emotions.</br></br>  <br>The whole point is his life wasn't turned upside when she disappeared because he finally stopped blaming himself and figured out how to deal with loss.</br>  Can this anime shed me tear like Nodame?<br>Mozart is great.</br>  <br>Most of the music in this is Chopin, not that I mind (he is my favourite composer)</br>  Classical music is subjectively boring and ded.  <br>It's okay to have bad tastes anon. Don't worry.</br>  <br>Forced drama of the year</br>  <br>Thanks for understanding.</br>  <br> v <br> giving a shit about sentimental dying friend drama <br>Get your boogiemen straight, anon.</br></br></br>    <br>Everybody who doesn't get this is literally retarded.</br>  <br>Best girl didn't win again...</br>  <br>What the hell are you talking about anon? She's probably being played as we speak.</br>  I really enjoyed it, and after reading through that fucking thread of 'worst shit you've seen in hentai' I don't particularly give a fuck that most of /a/ find it emotionally unappealing.  <br>Most of /a/ are emotionally dead robots that hate all serious character drama.</br>  <br>Pressing the keys like he's gently caressing a baby...</br>  <br> giving numbers as rating  <br> shitting on /a/ <br><br>Do you know how I know you are newfag?</br></br></br></br>  This manga was literally cuckolding.<br><br>I feel like it would have been a lot better if Tsubaki had been the main love interest from the start and Kaori was just a platonic friend.</br></br>  <br>No one cares about this garbage here, you should go to reddit/MAL to comment on It and stay there.</br>  <br> if Tsubaki had been the main love interest <br>How would that make a better story?</br></br>  pretty good<br>rated it 10 on MAL</br>    Did Kaori have multiple sclerosis, or was it some disease with no basis in reality?  <br>It's not very good.<br><br>As others have mentioned about it being cliched (I'm not even using this as a buzzword, it is awfully similar to Key stories in many regards), as well as MC being forced by his friends to fix his PTSD, there are numerous other problems.<br><br>Firstly, the directing feels very amateur, I'm pretty sure that this is one of the director's first projects, but every episode seems to have flashbacks of events that occurred one scene prior. The animation is wildly inconsistent, there will be a well animated scene followed by a 30second still frame of characters talking. Another issue is the lack of cohesion between the more serious scenes and the comedic scenes; they often just ruin any mood the show tries to create.<br><br>Finally, the side characters aren't fleshed out very well. The male friend of the MC becomes nothing more than a plot device after the first several episodes. The main heroine is given very little development, and the slideshow of her life at the end feels like a cheap way to compensate for that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure it was ALS.</br>  <br>japanese cold</br>  Is Shaman King an /a/ approved anime/manga? I remember reading a couple issues in old Shonen Jumps I had.  Nobody here really talks about it but nobody here really shits on it either so it's the grey area  I gew up on it myself, back when I was a kid.<br>It wasn't all too bad from what I remember, I know that I found the villain pretty cool.</br>  When, Takei?<br>FUCKING. WHEN?</br>  Where the fuck are the threads?  <br>But will we get character songs with lots of flamenco motifs? I want at least one song to have a trumpet solo.</br>  <br>Still hoping for a bed scene.</br>  SLAY THE GAY  <br> Kind of surprised that Kaneko likes Zesshoushinai so much. <br>He said on his twitter that even though they asked him to pick a scene from S1 or S2 he broke the rules and chose a scene from Zesshou Shinai in consideration of his fellow staff members and cast, so that their choices wouldn't overlap.</br></br>  <br>which magazine is this from?</br>  http://reader.sensescans.com/reader<wbr>/read/magi__labyrinth_of_magic/en/2<wbr>6/273/page/1</wbr></wbr>  This chapter is reviving my desire to get a RTS game based on magi, there's so much material for.  <br>So Hakuryuu isn't part of SSA.</br>  <br>Yes he is.</br>  <br>Text says that he isn't. Also Koumei has called Japan the 3rd country that is helping Hakuryuu.</br>  <br>Magi turned to shit about the arc where they showed the previous world.</br>  <br>  Text says he isn't <br><br>It says "fellow sworn friend of the Seven Seas Alliance". What do you think that means?</br></br></br>  Now this is war.  <br>Friend is not the same as the part of alliance.</br>  He will kill Kouha once he finds that he is actually a boy  Sparta has arrived.  <br>You turned a faggot after you were born.</br>  <br>Go back to school fucking sand nigger.</br>  <br>Now you're just being pedantic. Hakuryuu is obviously part of the SSA as they otherwise don't have any right to interfere in this war.</br>  Hm, Koumei has gussed the 3rd country that helps Hakuryuu. I wonder what has been his guessed for the 2nd country.  <br>I think you're forgetting Sinbad's role.</br>  <br>Are you sure? Sinbad toe everyone professed that he is going to support Kouen in this war. I wouldn't be surprised if SSA countries that have been in the summit would support Kouen. Yes, Sassan and Kina were in the summit.</br>  <br>Yah I dont think he's part of the alliance, as a "sworn friend" this gives Sinbad a "reason" to fight. They were gonna fight with the Kou empire anyway, so why not take them by surprise now?</br>  <br>Why are those advisors/strategists so incompetent? None of them knows anything, they don't even know the countries of their world, why are they even there?</br>  I'm not going to lie, i'm really confused by this chapter.  Now it's more than obvious that no one is gonna die is this so called war.  Japan is so cool comes out from the earth on the water wave.  <br>No it does not. It goes against the SSA policy. They can only get involved if one of their allied nations ia under threat.</br>  <br>SSA can't do it. Their policy doesn't allow it. So Sassan and Kina most likely aren't here to kill anyone.</br>  <br><br><br>Well this is sinbad we're talking about. what's a policy to him? they may have ahd a meeting of sorts and ended up agreeing that it would be to their benfit to mount a surprise attack now. As a general this seems to be a legit strat.<br><br>and im not saying anyone will die. My point being is that hakuryu is nto part of SSA. otherwise why would they say "swron friend" instead of "an allied nation"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True.<br>Hakuryuu isn't part of SSA. <br>The friend part most likely means that he has promised not to attack SSA.</br></br></br>  <br>also forgot to add they might just be there to flex their muscle. just to intimidate.<br><br>the way i see it is that the SSA is porpousely sticking their nose in the fight hoping that they would get attacked first giving them a reason to join the fight</br></br></br>  So is not-western-Europe entering the fray? I was under the impression that the entire world was somewhat more ancient in aesthetic.<br>I guess there was Magnostadt, but does harry potter land count as western?</br>  <br>Are you seriously arguing that Sinbad would more likely break his policy that is known worldwide rather than just have Hakuryuu's Kou join the SSA? Jesus christ, man.</br>  <br>Balbadd was SSA friend.<br>Both kings are saying that Hakuryuu is just a friend.</br></br>  <br>Magnostadt is basically Jerusalem</br>  <br><br> otherwise why would they say "swron friend" <br>Because, they mean that they, the kings, came to support their new friend, the dark and evil emperor.<br><br>I doubt the Alliance would make themselves look bad by doing what they sworn not to do.<br><br><br>Of course, it's a magocracy, a typical European country of Medieval Ages.<br><br>Also, Nanaumi's taste in men is terrible, her master looked like a mutant when he was properly shown.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already? Man, this was a fast release.</br>  <br>Ahh, that makes a lot more sense in hindsight, thanks</br>  <br>This is politics. Sinbad would never get involved in this war if he would come out looking bad. He has an image to uphold as the high king of the SSA.</br>  I hope we get some fighting. I don't just want this to be the SSA waving their dick around and making the other army concede  <br>Just look at this thing for the second time.</br>  <br>I got to admit I'm kinda impressed here.<br><br>Hakuryuu chose the battlefield the set up his allies to catch Kou in a pincer when they got there. <br><br>Koumei read far into it enough to have countermeasures prepared for an attack for the sea and basically dumped their dungeon monster army at the boats.<br><br>Didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone get a ww2 vibe from this?  <br>Why is everyone from Kina obsessed with horns?</br>  <br>They're all Oni wannabes.</br>  <br>Glorious nippon Oni</br>  <br> I hope we get some fighting. I don't just want this to be the SSA waving their dick around and making the other army concede <br>That's what most likely we are getting since until the black god comes out no one is gonna die. We soon are going to be back to Judar's and Alibaba's adventures.</br></br>  <br>When I look at Japanese, they looks very much like Baal's race with these little horns.</br>  <br>You seriously think Koumei is going to retreat just because two metal vessel users are here when they still outnumber them?</br>  <br>Nope, I think there is going to be given a clever suggestion to do something else instead of fighting here.</br>  <br> girls </br>  <br>That makes no sense. I dont know why you guys are trying so hard to think of ways where no one dies.</br>  <br>Yep, that Jap mutant is blind. How else could he mistake Kouha the Man for a girl?</br>  <br>You need people for mass death during Illah's revival so this battle wouldn't take anyone's life.</br>  <br>Kouen must be blind too.</br>  <br>he'll just think she's a futa, anon. he's japanese.</br>  <br>Kouen is a little boy, it's okay for him to make mistakes sometimes.</br>  <br>Starting a war with the SSA isn't the best idea</br>  can we bring his smile back?  <br><br>I want to hug him.</br></br>  <br>The question isn't so much "can" and more "when" and "how", Alibaba's coming back from the dead eventually.</br>  <br>Japanese are weird. He might befriend him or think it's cool.</br>  <br>As soon as his husbando comes back</br>  <br>He needs to go learn magic and not sit without purpose. Life goes on.</br>  <br>Easy. Give Alibaba back. He will be even more happy if Alibaba is turned into a girl with gigantic breasts.</br>   EXTREME MAGIC?!   <br>Extreme Magic arc ruined Extreme magic, I just can't care about it when it comes up</br>  <br><br>But would Alibaba be happy with that anon?<br><br>That's what really matters here.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I loved Hakuryuu and Alibaba's Extreme Magic duel.</br></br>  <br>Why is fish princess blushing?

Probably would have been better without it.</br>  <br>it exists</br>  <br>That's your personal flaw, paying attention to the fanbase of something over the actual product.</br>  <br>Reading Steiner is dumb cop-out, and people in general remembering things that happened to alternate versions of themselves is super dumb.</br>  <br>These are a problem too, but not as much</br>  <br>It fucked up Chapters 7-9</br>  Friendly reminder that the Chimame CD will hit the streets in 4 days.  I want to do lewd things to the Chimametai!    <br>Why is Chino wearing such an erotic expression? Does she like the idea or not?</br>  <br>The shading should tell you no.<br><br> She's actually telling a shitty ghost story.

So we're all in agreement that this is the worst show this season?  I was somewhat considering giving it a try out of boredom anyways, but then I looked at your picture and saw<br> funi <br>Thank you for putting the nail in the coffin and ensuring there's no reason to try this steaming pile of shit.</br></br>  <br>I dropped it as soon as I saw the horrible cgi. It was immediate, like as soon as you open the file.</br>  <br>I think I downloaded it, watched the first few minutes and then skipped through some scenes just to give it one more chance before dropping it.</br>  <br>I just saw that there where a lot of threads about it and assumed that it was going to be good. But this absolutely awful. <br><br>Why do people on /a/ actually like this crap?</br></br></br>  <br>Because you are retarded, anon.<br><br>That must be the reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because something gets a lot of threads doesn't mean people think it's good.</br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with picking up a show based on threads, but there's no excuse for not dropping it as soon as you see it. I can't understand why people would continue to watch this show at all.</br>  <br>But I'm looking at one of the threads and people actually like it.</br>  <br>That's not Gangsta.</br>  <br>I don't know, why would I go to a thread about a series I consider utter shit? People have shit taste, nothing to see here. Just move on.</br>  <br>That's not Chaos Dragon.</br>  <br>Are you serious?</br>    <br> *crawling in my skin plays muffled in the distance* </br>  I'll start.    Autism: the MC<br><br>Finally a relatable MC</br></br>  <br>She's just so adorable.</br>  <br>This</br>  Her character feels artificial somehow. I don't know, it's like I can't her as an actual person. I have the same problem with shounen leads like Luffy.  <br><br>Autistic <br><br><br><br>Schizophrenic delusions</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just so based.</br>  <br>I have a friend who's almost like Hajime, the difference is she's actually going through something big in life</br>  <br>  Autistic <br>  still better than most MC's in all of anime </br></br>  <br>Anon, I don't think an autist can relate to somebody who is the polar opposite of autistic.</br>  <br> friend <br> she <br>You lost me.</br></br></br>  <br> Schizophrenic delusions <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually she is insufferable</br>  <br>The fairies anon, they aren't actually there</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't get this show. <br>I made it 6 episodes in and almost fell asleep.</br></br></br>  <br>It must be nice to be alone in this world, anon.</br>  <br>Did you move here straight from reddit yesterday?</br>  Ohana  <br>I'm not sure what the explanation for that screencap is, but not only are the fairies real,  Watashi is also one of them.  In the LN, at least.</br>  <br>I actually did, yes.</br>  She was so refreshing that she even changed Bluetsutsu.  Koto.    <br>Everybody knows alien robots can't see fairies.</br>  <br>The freshest</br>  <br>I just finished watching the first series and I only want to say I hated this little shit. You'd think Mary Sueness and mental retardation would be mutually exclusive, but no. At least she's cute.</br>  <br>Hajime isn't remotely autistic.</br>  <br><br><br>  autism suddenly became a different thing </br></br></br>  <br>I never said she's autistic, just a generic "mental retardation". If we want to be specific she's more of a mix of ADHD and the mental age of a six year old.</br>  <br>Hajime's genki personality is probably not the real deal.<br><br>She apparently repeatedly says something akin to "I hope I can keep thinking that way." in the time leading up to the final confrontation with Katze.</br></br></br>  <br>If this mental retardation can positively change the world, then I wouldn't mind.</br>  <br>Only a retard could misinterpret the character this much.</br>  <br>Preach.</br>  I'm beginning to think that Hajime is putting on a front and has deeper machinations going in her mind. Scenes like this make me think that.  <br>Hajime tends to be extremely sharp about knowing what other people are thinking and extremely skillful in dealing with them. There's nothing of mentally retarded or autistic in her.</br>  <br> just a generic "mental retardation" <br>It's funny how often bunch of shut-ins, actual autists, loners and social outcasts diagnose cheerful outgoing characters with bright outlook on life as mentally ill.<br>Different != broken. I wish anons would realize this.</br></br></br>  <br>The gray feelings marker was ominous as fuck too.</br>  <br>The unchanging gray balloon in the latest episode can be a clue to your thoughts.</br>  <br>They're just too ignorant to even try to understand.</br>  <br><br><br>Well there is also this.<br>Hajime's personality is clearly not "real".<br><br>The question then is "who is Hajime?".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zgv<wbr>wqvamdts</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Cosmo was a fun change of pace. Not that dickrogues are novel in and of themselves.</br>  It's amazing how she can see through other people.<br><br>  Autism <br>  Autistic <br>  Mental Retardation <br><br>I think you're the ones who need to consult a neurologist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not really ominous, since that old man had it gray all the time as well. Just maybe an indication that she's seen some shit.</br>  <br>The fact she's somehow wiser than everyone else is an aspect of the mary sue part I was complaining about before. It changes nothing of the way she acts.<br><br><br><br>Call me ignorant all you want, she is not just "cheerful", she's loud and hyperactive. It might or might not be all there is to her character, but as I said above, it does not change the way she acts. She is an annoying presence on screen, thus I don't like her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's just an indication on how she can't be easily affected or moved by something. Or maybe on how she can't be easily influenced by others.</br>  <br> Call me ignorant all you want, she is not just "cheerful", she's loud and hyperactive. It might or might not be all there is to her character, but as I said above, it does not change the way she acts. She is an annoying presence on screen, thus I don't like her. <br>See, that's completely different from what you were saying before. I can accept that you don't like her because she's loud and hyperactive, but neither of those imply mental retardation or autism.<br><br>Nobody's asking you to like her, but if you say things that are simply wrong you should expect people to disagree with you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that too. If she has to make a conscious effort to be genki then clearly something's going on. This feels like Madoka 2.0 or something.</br>  did she got a boob job?  <br>It looks a tad bigger than the first season, but not really that much of a difference. Or maybe emphasis because of Katze. Or maybe just puberty.</br>  <br> she's somehow wiser than everyone else is an aspect of the mary sue part I was complaining about before <br>She's not wiser. She just acts differently than simple muscle brains who function like robots: SEE ALIEN -&gt; TRANSFORM -&gt; KILL ALIEN -&gt; REPEAT AD NAUSEUM.<br>JJ actually picked her because the muscle brains would be still killing MESSes even now.<br>She's not some cunning general making flawless keikaku to crush her enemies, she just deals with alien trouble same way as she deals with every day ones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she did shove an evil alien's soul into her tits.</br>  First episode when?  <br>She's basically treating every situation like how she would in normal everday life.</br>  <br>Already two episodes in, mate. Specifically 00 and 01.</br>  <br>Oh, ok, downloading at the speed of light.</br>  <br>Of course I don't literally see her as a drooling retard, that was more of a hyperbole and standard 4chan banter. I still can't say I associate loudness and hyperactiveness to a brilliant mind.<br><br><br>My problem with that is that her way to deal with everything also always turns out to be the right way.<br>Her attitude is interesting at first, but when she seemingly can do no wrong, it becomes rather tiring and starts to seem more like some sort of omniscience.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hajime awaits you. Ohayou gozaimassssu.</br>  Back on topic.  <br><br>I like how this is canon</br></br>  <br>It stands out mostly because the rest of the team are dysfunctional. They were all pretty messed up.<br><br>Sugane was following the lead of a guy who gets drunk in a room of stuffed animals that resemble his dead species. And is cripplingly afraid of their main enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>Issei, the only harem MC that openly wants to impregnate his ladies.</br>  <br> but when she seemingly can do no wrong, it becomes rather tiring and starts to seem more like some sort of omniscience. <br>You say that as if she solved everything herself.<br>I'd give her credit for 'talking' with MESS but the rest was team effort even if idiots needed a hint or two occasionally.</br></br></br>  <br>All those fucking kids, just all those god damn kids. How will he support that entire mess?</br>  <br>What anons do not realize is that she is the paragon for optimism and hope. She is supposed to be optimistic all the time.<br><br>Just like the enemy was the paragon for despair.<br><br>It is a morality play.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When I read the plot like this it feels so much darker.</br>  <br>He'ss probably just go boostoh if it gets tough.</br>  <br>Hajime was the reason I kept watching "It's Fucking Nothing" The Animation<br><br>Katze was cool, but it barely appeared</br></br></br>  <br>She single-handedly resolved the MESS issue, fixed all of the teams' problems, and effectively dealt with Katze as well. There was a team effort to avert the crisis he wanted to cause, but without Hajime taking the matter in her own hands he would just have come back sooner or later.</br>  She's probably one of the best characters of all time.  <br>And now they're in the show as one. Lucky you</br>  Did Berg make Hajime orgasm?  <br>Did the new season start?</br>  <br>The TV ending was interesting because X, Rui, and the Crowds were the main actors. And Hajime's victory over Katze wasn't even given screentime.<br><br>MESS was minor. Try and talk to alien vs Kill alien. Talk to alien worked! Case closed. J.J. even said MESS may not be a threat.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, two episodes in.</br>  <br>Orgasm from the breast. Thank god for episode 13.</br>  <br>Honestly as far as I understood it, OD beats the shit out of Katze, then Katze goes into hiding and Hajime puts him into her tits.</br>  Alright so I just finished this.<br>Am I supposed to be OK with the ending or is it something universally considered bad?</br>  <br>its a fantastic movie.<br>that being said, i dont really like it</br></br>  <br> Am I supposed to be OK with the ending <br>Yes, since it is the alternative Homura found to her despair. Unless you happened to dislike her from the start, and most likely the entire movie given how centered it is on her.<br><br> or is it something universally considered bad? <br>Does it matter? You just experienced it, now form your own opinion instead of searching for the crowd to validate it. It's only entertainment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The sayaka fight wasn't the most meaningful. The most meaningful is the homura-walpurgis fight.
