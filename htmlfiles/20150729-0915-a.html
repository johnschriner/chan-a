It wasn't too bad. I wish Gon Synchro Summoned something on his first turn instead of the Magnet play. Crow wasn't too bad I guess. Gon played Pendulums and Synchro but it was underwhelming. Not too bad a duel. Doesn't restore my hype though.  I finally realized that Yusei's deck eats through your hand like a motherfucker. No wonder he had to rely on angle baton and graveyard effects alot. Yuma's gagagas need another xyz monster. cowboy and samurai are good at what they do but they need a number  <br>Well Yusei's deck is also largely shit and useless.</br>  <br>I hadn't even thought of that, yes, keikaku right.</br>  <br><br>Dont bump this thread, we still have to go through the old one, let this one die.

All that stuff you mentioned can happen outside of more filler duels. The staff mentioned that the tournament is getting interrupted by Academia and Dennis reveals himself. Just a matter of when.

That way it's way more realistic how you can have incredibly specific action cards and you can't just go for them in the last second but need to properly prepare them which gives the opponent a chance to react to them and change their strategy to accomodate action cards.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pic related</br>  What if the real reason why Reiji doesn't wear socks because it hinders his chunni powers?  <br>Sorry that I triggered you, faggot.</br>  <br>That's cool, I hope we get actual kaiju references, it'd be a neat archetype petdeck.</br>  <br><br>Also<br> little brother NTRing you with your rival <br><br>is also part of his keikaku</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Socks aren't a part of keikaku.

No update for 2 weeks ;_;  <br>Yeah I feel action cards themselves are fine but alot of recent duels arn't as interesting to write using them.

There's still room for one more SoL scene to help hammer the senpai/kouhai character arc.

The lights above her blinked and sparked out of the air. There were infected in the school. She didn’t see them, but had expected them now for days. Her note to her students were not read to and now it was too late. Far too late for now, anyway.<br>Megumi was a school teacher for fourteen months. When she was teaching she watched the highschoolers and she said to the principal “I want to be teach at the school.”<br>principal said “No! You will BE KILL BY INFECTED”<br>There was a time when she believed him. Then as she got working he stopped. But now in the Megugaoka High school of the Yokosuka she knew there were infected.<br><br><br>“This is Kurumi” the megaphone crackered. “You must find the antidote!”<br>So Megumi left her emergency manual and opened the shutter.<br>“IT GOING TO KILL US” said the Rii<br>“I will shove at him” said the Shovel and she shoved the shovel. Megumi ran at him and tried to shack him off. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill.<br>“No! I must kill the zombies” she shouted<br>The radio said “No, Megu-nee. You are the zombies”<br>And then Yuki was a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Text in pictures isn't hard, but mspaint isn't the best so I can't help.</br>   I think Hika's a zombie. She was driven off by the other group when she received a very minor injury with the other girls following her, hence her reacting when Kurumi brought them up. The entire other group of violent hyper-pragmatists couldn't reach the food store and generator despite massive tensions due to the lack of electricity, but apparently Hika alone was able to find it - perhaps thanks to zombie stealth. That would also have been where the serum was, whether or not she's mentioned it to the others yet or not.   <br>It's a lot harder than people think.<br><br>Or at least a lot more tedious.</br></br></br>  <br>Just dropping the size and centering would improve it.

Why did he destroy the medicine? Was it because it had terrible consequences?<br>Why did he get infected? Is it because the disease could be transmitted airborne?<br> Kurumi's already dead isn't she? </br></br>  <br>Definitely a broom.

At least one of the strains might be.</br></br>  <br>This is why I hate these threads.

In either case, you shouldn't reply to him.</br>  <br>I agree. She's better than Yuki. She gets shit done. Yuki's annoying but really without her they would all be crazy or something.</br>  <br>They've been changing a few things  for the better . It's generally a good thing to read the source though because  Megu-nee is dead. </br>  <br>Most people not drop it and pretty positive response.<br>Beware the fanbase though.<br>As usual read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If you want to stick around GG threads, read the source material.

When people say the anime is better than the manga, they're not saying that lightly.  and I am in fact in disagreement. </br>  <br>Nobody's saying the anime is better than the manga, just the the anime is a worthy adaptation and that the differences from the manga are justified.</br>  <br>It's better in the sense that it added little bits and pieces that the manga didn't have the chance to put in.

Media is referenced by writers all the time, and Gakkou Gurashi is clearly written quite well. While any "serious" reference to an anime or manga may come off as retarded or autistic to someone familiar with it, you can't forget that it is in fact a proper work of fiction written by a single person in an attempt to tell a serious story, and is thus worthy of analysis. I feel that anyone going out of their way to do so does it tongue-in-cheek, knowing that it's kind of silly, but also with enough effort to uncover some hidden truth in the writing or application that might not be obvious.</br>  <br>Have this</br>  <br><br>It's funny how many people have no idea what actually is autistic.

Yuki is suffering from very deep-rooted denial.</br>  <br>Miki is not a professional psychologist, however.<br><br> I personally agree with that interpretation, but it needs to be said regardless. </br></br></br>  scanlation when?  <br>Miki doesn't know shit. The way Yuuki acted when she snapped out of it (around chapter 30) suggests actual delusions, not just denial.</br>  <br>Miki observed her firsthand and had medical books to help.

If you agree with it, that's cool, but don't try to pass it as fact. It wasn't presented that way.</br>  <br>Miki fag detected. In all seriousness her delusions were very much so real to her. Psychosis and delusions are most certainly what she had, and those are both actual ailments. They were brought on by her Post Traumatic Stress, the author is just trying to make it sound weird and unique with the "Nobody's ever had these symptoms before" trope.</br>  <br>That's ok, after episode 3 the anime can be about EPA lolis trying to fix the massive oil spill the Oil Rig lolis made.

And every character is a cute girl.</br>  This is why vns like Planetarian work really well. You need something cute, a girl with a very innocent worldview, and to place her in a situation she doesn't understand. She continues to pretend everything is okay but really, deep down, she can sense nothing will ever be the same again.

Says to say it in Engrish, but all I can get out of that is Grateful sounds kinda like Grave.</br>  Why do they say Miki has blonde hair if her hair is clearly gray?  <br>Oh god, I want to keep that Yuki.</br>  <br>Thanks mate</br>  Anybody got that candied apple image?  <br>I don't know it's crazy to me much like those people who Megu-nee is dead in the anime version when she is clearly alive.</br>  <br>It's not great, but it's something. Hopefully someone has a scan.</br>  <br>Too obvious, bub</br>  <br>I think you're colour blind.  It also helps us claim that she is a slut much easily. </br>  <br>No one is going to scan it  unless you buy it and scan it yourself. </br>  <br>That hair is anything but yellow.<br> spoiler <br>You talking shit about Miki, m8?</br></br></br>  <br>ty</br>  <br>Those shovel's apples. I want to bite them.</br>  <br>There are different types of blonde you chucklefuck.<br><br>Also prove she isn't a slut m8 just try it.</br></br></br>  <br> Signature includes a Yuki face <br>cute</br></br>  <br>We all know she is a slut she wears garters and stockings for crying out loud, plus she was into fucking that guy in the mall had her friend not cock blocked her.</br>  <br>That shit ain't no kinpatsu m80.<br><br>Also, she's a pure maiden, you can't prove otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>Here, all the proof needed.</br>  <br>I only get this because I just read through that part of Vento Aureo.</br>  <br>So it's confirmed: Kei was a slut.</br>  <br> no separate tracks for solo versions </br>  reminder that goth-chan probably bullied the fuck out of yuki as well  <br>Wait for the Character song albums, mate</br>  <br>This reminds me, wasn't there one with Yuki too?</br>  <br>She may not be a high tier kinpatsu but she's still a kinpatsu. Also see<br><br><br> implying she wasnt just acting <br> implying she wasnt disappointed when Kei pulled her away </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>pudzian pedał dzieci jebał</br>  <br>You are reading too much into that scene friend that was no bully at most girly semi hateful gossip which Yuki did not hear.</br>  <br>She was clearly depressed, there was lots of talk behind her back, they made fun of her hat. You're ignoring the truth bub, she was bullied.</br>  <br>The first time I saw Goth-chan I was, "She's really friends with this moe cathat girl? She sorta looks like she'd be a snooty bully to her, I guess I shouldn't judge people based on appearances." GUESS I SHOULD ALWAYS JUDGE BASED ON APPEARANCES</br>  <br>I think I remember seeing it in a past thread, but I must not have saved it.</br>  <br>All they said was look at her hat, it was a compliment if anything, no one would really bully Yuki she gets along with everyone.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Now I know you're trolling. You're that "What zombie apocalypse, it's just a SoL" fag, aren't you?</br>   Watashi tachi wa koko ni imasu~   <br>People always giggle quietly to each other before they compliment me.  It's because they all have crushes on me and giggle like schoolgirls around me. They all had crushes on Yuki because she's such a cool classmate, Yuki/Gothgirl confirmed. </br>  <br>She was depressed that she had too many friends and couldn't spend time with all of them!</br>  <br>Is this the one?</br>  <br>Ah of course that's it. Everyone was pinning after her because of her great hat!</br>  <br>I wonder how it feels to be a moe girl with cute accessories, yet the world around you are a bunch of normies who bully you.</br>  <br> Too many friends <br> Depressed because you can't hang out with them all <br> All your friends die <br> Happy because you no longer have to worry about hanging out with your friends <br><br>It's weird how much sense this makes, in a sociopathic kind of way.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Neither Kurumi or Rii knew Yuki before the outbreak. Not saying she wasn't depressed before, but I think that part was talking specifically about after the outbreak and before the formation of the club.</br>  <br>Holy shit do none of these girls know how to eat a candy apple or something?<br><br> that fan <br>how subtle</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Megu-nee talking.</br>  <br>She looked mighty depressed in the flashback, and Megu-nee new her before. She could have told Kurumi and Yurii that Yuki was depressed before.</br>  <br> Holy shit do none of these girls know how to eat a candy apple or something? <br><br>Can't say I'm complaining.</br></br></br>  <br> I think that part was talking specifically about after the outbreak and before the formation of the club. <br>No it clearly wasn't, look at the sentence structure.<br><br> Yuki who had ALWAYS been very depressed </br></br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever eaten a candy apple before? The hot sauce gets everywhere that's why they put the damn thing on a stick.</br>  <br> her smile and optimism: found </br>  <br>It's not though.</br>  <br> hot sauce <br>What the hell kind of candy apples are you eating?<br><br><br>Always, sense they new her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One thing I don't get is that Yuki was ALWAYS depressed, or only after the outbreak.</br>  <br>My bad, you're right. Megu-nee only said she behaved too much like a little kid.</br>  Would you bring about the zombie apocalypse to see her smile?  <br> Mosaic.wav </br>  <br>The anime just canonically showed she was depressed before, even though I believed she wasn't. That scene was added by the author to clarify the point, most likely.</br>  I still maintain that the Uni girls are going to betray the Gakkous or were just using them all along. Those guys in the helmets run away way too fast after seeing them get into the Uni.  <br>I'd rather see someone depressed than see them broken.</br>  <br> No it clearly wasn't, look at the sentence structure. <br>Ambiguous even in the original Japanese.</br></br>  <br>Well it's a good thing the anime cleared all the ambiguity of it away then!</br>  <br>Thing is, she says she was always depressed, yet Rii-san only got to know her on the day of the outbreak.</br>  <br>I want to bring her happiness.</br>  <br>I'm sure Megu-nee would've talked about it to them at some point.</br>  <br>She only met Kurumi on Z day, but she might have known Rii before. Megu-nee's diary did say people liked to hang out on the roof and Rii was in the gardening club.</br>  <br> http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm26<wbr>809520</wbr> <br>This ain't a guitar solo, you faglord, but yeah, the bridge section is showing again that Japan can't compose for shit recently.</br></br>  <br>She could have heard from Megu-nee, but I agree that I used to think Yuki was only depressed starting after the outbreak. The anime just showed a different truth.</br>  I knew what GG was about before getting into the anime, after joining the early threads before it aired, just to make sure that I was gonna pick it up.<br><br>I still got fooled by the first episode, I thought "damn, /a/ sure overreacted over this story" and then the sadly reminder came.<br><br>I call it moe-suffering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't seem to find the subscribe button, do you know where it is?</br>  <br>Calm down Anon, sometimes people like to voice their opinion in a bit of a weird manner, but it's still far from blogging about their life.</br>  <br> but she might have known Rii before <br>They might have known each others names, but they clearly weren't friends and haven't been on the roof together before.</br></br>  When is full ED out?

I'm still disappointed that there were no other Rin scales announce at Wonfest. The aniplex one has a dumb looking face.  Wonfest was nothing but boatsluts and mikushits  <br>at least there was one good figure.</br>    Aren't you glad the USD and Euro are strong against the Yen? <br><br>It almost converts the price 1:1 and makes shipping free.</br></br>  <br>Maybe one day they might make a Ginko figure too</br>  <br>I wish I had a better job and more disposable income to really take advantage of this.</br>    When does the Rin Hoshizora fan book ver. fig come out?<br>amiami.com/top/detail/detail?scode=<wbr>FIGURE-011054<br>its late july already fug</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>I can't wait to clean her with  my q-tip </br></br>  Best MF sculptor is now making swords. <br> I like it. </br>  <br>best boy too, hopefully it's not too boring</br>  <br>I'm still mad that even this little shit is getting a scale and Imanotsurugi gets nothing.</br>   payment request for IA/VT Colorful <br>It's finally happening.</br>  Really Aquamarine? That's the shittiest base I've seen.  <br>You should see football Pochaco's base.<br><br>It looks like someone just cut a piece of MDF and used that. Basically the only flaw with an otherwise 10/10 figure.</br></br></br>  <br>Making good bases is a rarely practised art. Some of the large, gorgeous figs are a let down because the characters are just standing on a round piece of plastic.</br>  I can't believe I'm saying this, but I'm actually tempted to buy a One Piece figure<br>at least this set is cheap</br>  <br>Do people actually like this art style? I've always thought it just looked shitty.</br>  <br>I never thought it looked good on figures, but this one looks cute as fuck</br>  <br> Trying this hard to fit in <br>You forgot swords and idols.</br></br>  <br>reminder she was in sm brothel around the age shown on your picture</br>  <br>You do know you're supposed to take that off right.<br>It's actually a mirror base.</br></br>  <br>I still can't fathom what the maker thought when he decided on those colors.</br>  <br>I didn't, but that's good.</br>  <br>Pochaco has the prefect fatty body that you just want to fuck, unfortunately her baby face ruines it.</br>  <br>He thought "I'm going to repaint it all white with my cum".</br>  <br>if you like pochacho you've already got shit taste so might as well have shit taste in colours</br>  <br> even better </br>  <br>what the hell is that</br>  <br>1/60 Koto Arbalest's announcement makes the entire event.</br>  <br>That shit is nothing compared to Ayesha's plain white base.</br>  <br>Plain white is fine. It's not interesting but it's not actively offensive either.</br>  It sucks when you get a figure that can 99.99% stand up by itself and then they give it a HUGE base instead of just putting a little base on each foot which would stabilise it and take up significantly less room.  <br>Figures look a hell of a lot nicer with a base than without.</br>  So, did they show anything related to pic related during wonfes?  Is there a gallery I can go too that will show me everything from Wonfest?  Lewd.  <br>I just want clear bases and across all lines. This is the most practical solution. the decorative shit just detracts from the figure.</br>  <br>BEAT's Tamamo? Unfortunately, nothing.</br>  How stupid am I for wanting this? She's a 1/3 scale doll. Shipping will be stupid expensive.  <br>Sometimes unique bases can be great, but I also like the uniformity that clear bases can give across a collection.</br>  <br> 1GBP = 192.89 JPY <br>What a time to be alive.</br></br>  <br>To me that looks like crap. The bottom of the dress looks ratty and hangs in a weird way. Just way for the RAH version. I'm sure that will happen and look a thousand times better.</br>  <br>Between that diamond Miku and this, it's like they're not trying with poses anymore.<br><br>Can you even curl 3 toes without curling the first 2?</br></br></br>  <br>Nope nothing new on that and I've been on the usual twatter tags for it the last few days.<br>But I don't have big hopes for it to be shown anytime soon tbh.<br>FLARE did enough for me!<br>And I'm curious how Broccoli will handle her Goth lolita costume. Too bad there are no better pictures of the prototype though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. I'd never even thought about the curled toes, that's actually pretty much impossible to do.</br>  How are you supposed to display figures that don't have stands?  <br>Have you looked at the pricetag?<br><br>Azone's other homu doll looks kinda sorta acceptable, but not really great either.<br><br>But that just looks like shit. And that's in a promo picture. In real life they often look worse to some degree.<br>Specifically the jagged fringes of her half-skirt look bad.<br><br><br><br>I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The people whose arms get cut off/deformed and then learn to use their feet like hands probably can.</br>  <br>I love this Yuuki.</br>  <br> I would think curling toes might be possible if you train for it. Like some people can't do the vulcan salute initially. <br>I hadn't thought of that. Though now I'm wondering if I can train my toes to do the vulcan salute.<br><br><br>That's disturbing, but a valid point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile on Paypal:<br><br> 1 GBP = 184.169 JPY </br></br></br>  <br>I think this is impossible to recreate as shown. I remember vaguely someone telling that it has something to do with the way the tendons are attached. I think the feet look weird but not unacceptable but its obviously pandering to a certain demographic.</br>  <br>Like figures that are laying? Just put them on the shelf, or on something soft on the shelf.</br>  <br>for that purpose<br>I'm not afraid to pay AmiAmi with my shitty visa classic, and my bank's rates are tons better.</br></br>  <br>Attach magnets to their feet.</br>  <br>Nah, standing up. Just doesn't have a stand.</br>  anybody have her yet?  <br>too puffy. no thong.</br>  <br>Just checked wikipedia. Looks like the small toes mostly move as a group although the little toe can move somewhat independently.<br><br>Let's conclude miku is not human.</br></br></br>  When she's up to pre-order tell me  <br>I think she'll go great with Misa, but I'm begging for a  cast-on .</br>  <br> FREEing <br>I'll be keeping my money</br></br>  <br>thats why I didnt pre-order it, but its takane so I really wanna know how it turned out</br>  <br> thong <br>disgusting</br></br>  <br> I'm glad I'm not the only one. </br>  <br>I like how they conveniently leave out the angle with her disgusting lumpy stomach.</br>  <br>That's the reason why review blogs exist.</br>  Where can I get a rotating base like the ones reviewers use to take photos of figures?  <br> tfw canadian </br>  <br>Well thanks to my country's economy failing it's now 3 to 1, but somehow I still have to get all those plastic butts</br>  <br>What country?</br>  <br>Same as Noodles, Malaysia</br>  Enjoy the twenty-eighth of July.  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  Has anyone here used suruga-ya.jp?<br><br>It's got an obscure book I want but seems kind of shifty</br></br>  <br>They sometimes are a bit slow but otherwise good.<br>Oh, and they didn't include a preorder CD once even though it was listed.</br></br>  <br>The picture actually made me laugh. Thanks, you too.</br>  Where's my fucking Feito, Alter?    <br> shifty <br>Nah, they're fine. Don't expect perfect books though, even if they don't mention any damage.</br></br>    <br>So I should go with the second linked book then?<br><br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185135613001<br>http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/det<wbr>ail/185025353001<br><br>They're the same book but the fact that they're mentioning damage in the first one might mean that it's really bad</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  THREE MORE WEEKS  <br>If they can balance on their own you can just put them on a shelf like any other figure. The downside is that they won't be as stable.</br>  <br>Is FREEing really that bad? From some of the reviews I've seen they weren't so bad.</br>  <br><br>I've just had her shipped RSAL from Amiami, pretty hype, her hair seems like it would be brittle as fuck though.</br></br>  <br>It can't be as bad as Racing Miku 2011's can it?</br>  <br>Yes, avoid Rank B items in general. With that price difference I'm guessing there's some really visible damage. The second listing might not be perfect, but it at least shouldn't have tears or stains.</br>  <br>Thanks anon</br>   store exclusives are still a thing   <br>Their 1/8s can be pretty subpar for the price. Their 1/4s often look great.</br>  I remember an anon use too post pictures of Magician Miku every thread hoping a figure would be made of her.

But I do like that they're trying to vary their bunny designs, adding a jacket to the mix.</br>  <br>Bunny girls tend to be 1/4 for whatever fucking reason.</br>  <br>Probably easier to do the fishnets that way</br>  Will  Aquamarine  save us all?  <br>Yes.<br><br>But if not, Koto will.</br></br></br>  <br>so cute</br>  <br><br>  tfw one of the few good things good about Brittan </br></br>  <br><br>Because they look better, Bunny girls 1/8 always look like meh, just another scale more.</br></br>  <br>I know, I just don't really get why. I'd love to get her at 1/7 <br><br><br>There are a bunch of bunny girl figures at 1/7 that don't have issues with fishnets.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bought Elsa in hopes of them making Anna.

Everything in 1/4 should theoretically look better.</br>  <br>Nope. A guy actually got arrested for similar shit not too recently.</br>  <br>what makes them open parcels. do they get a heads up from the seller or do they just check parcels at random?<br><br>......what</br></br></br>  <br> Tumblr <br>Stop posting now and save yourself from further embarrasment.</br></br>  <br>Yes please</br>  <br>More than likely, only actual depicted sexual activity is illegal.

Once more works are up for pre-order (hoping for enuma elish, mitarashi kousei, animal passion, and few ), I'll get a copy of LoLK.</br></br>  <br>Because she is the best girl.</br>  <br>But Kosaki is equally as popular, and you can make the case she might be a little more popular.</br>  <br>No, I said it hurts, don't rub it in, Anon. <br> Fuck you ;_; </br></br>  <br>No one likes Tumblr though, so you should avoid them. Newfag 101.</br>  <br>I hope you're planning on scanning that Fubuki one.<br><br><br>Equal popularity but Chitoge has much more of an interesting design based on pure aesthetics.</br></br></br></br>  So I pulled the trigger last Sunday. Now the 6 month wait begins...  <br>must be fun to be rich</br>  <br>Anyone bought pic, is it any good?</br>  <br>yeah</br>  <br> And I'm curious how Broccoli will handle her Goth lolita costume <br>It seems like she will be the same titty monster like the PHAT's one. Let's just hope they won't ruin her face.</br></br>  <br> I hope you're planning on scanning that Fubuki one. <br><br>Yup. Although I'll probably get my goods well after the event (delays and whatnot), and someone will might scan it before me.</br></br></br>  <br>nah</br>  <br>I like this one more.</br>  <br> Do you eat shit? <br> Nisekoi <br>Goes without saying</br></br></br>  <br><br>The winter one is the best.</br></br>  <br>I go through cycles of which one I like the most.

So I'm charged on the day it's released?</br>  I'm so depressed.<br>i really wanted to support my waifu in any way I can, but there's no way I can shill this piece of shit.<br>I can't believe they fucked up this bad, her eye's are way too light, her winking face looks like shit and worst of all her midriff.<br>God damn her fucking midriff, how they fuck it up so bad?<br>NO FUCKING NAVEL, what the flying fuck? And the cherry on top of the shit sundae is that huge fucking seam right across that fucking painted tree stump they call a torso just looks awful, of course they covered it with that claw grip stand before so you couldn't see it.<br>Yes she has decently cute smiling expressions but this is just unacceptable at 7,400 yen, her terrible torso complete ruins it, how the fuck could they just make her body a stick with no navel?<br>I might still buy it because fuck it, but I will hate myself if she ends up getting a figma or any decent figure that's not the nendoroid.<br>She's available for preorder tomorrow if you're interested, please support my waifu in any way you can, but I'm not expecting you to buy this injustice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes, we are undervalued 20% <br><br>20%?

Preferably Leiur  <br>pls halp</br>  <br> You generally do the inspection yourself if they demand it. <br>Why do they even want inspections in person anyway? I've received packages resealed with german customs tape, so they clearly open them themselves anyway.</br></br>  <br>elbow and ankle joints look like shit. and the napkin is part of the shittyness.<br><br>really, hestia only works when her clothing is skin-tight and shows off curves. Not to mention that the ribbon does not work in 3D-land</br></br></br>  <br>You already answered your own question.</br>  <br>No idea, usually they open mine by themselves as well.

Better than nothing.</br>  <br> I will hate myself if she ends up getting a figma or any decent figure that's not the nendoroid. <br>Why buy something you don't like just because it has your waifu's name on it?

Has anyone ever altered an order to shift from one version of an item to another with them?  <br>I really like the sculpt, in fact I own almost every single one of the sculptor's figures, but this has nothing to do with rikka. Could honestly just be a girl with blue hair and an eyepatch. still might order it, but I don't like the colors and lack of gradient.</br>  <br> Q. There is now a version of the item I ordered with an AmiAmi exclusive bonus. Can I switch to that version? <br>A. Yes. Please contact us with your order ID number and the item code of the item you would like upgraded. We are able to upgrade items only if the version with the AmiAmi exclusive bonus is currently available. Please do not place a new order for the AmiAmi version, and keep in mind that we cannot downgrade items or switch items between editions (eg. regular edition to limited edition or vice versa).</br></br>  <br>You just email them. They'll switch it.</br>  <br>What these two said:<br><br><br><br>I've never had an issue in the past.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This looks like a horrible 80s toddler doll.</br>  <br> lack of gradient <br>What does that mean?</br></br>  <br>Flat colors.</br>  <br> http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/Joul</wbr> <br><br>Beware my shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/OmegaMecha</wbr></br>  <br>We got these.</br>  <br> Tharja, Anubis and Jehuty <br>Jelly as fuck</br></br>  Here is anon's step by step guide to over 100 likes on MFC.<br><br>Step 1: write your comment, make sure its positive, making a joke or meme about your wallet helps.<br><br>Step 2: the most important step, post a gif of the character that you're commenting on, doesn't matter if its relevant, just get any ol gif from google, hell you can skip step 1 if you want.<br><br>Thats it, you're welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why the fuck would you post this here?</br></br>  <br>Are we also getting Falcon of Light Griffith or just Femto?</br>    <br> must <br> not <br> post <br> bingo chart </br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you consider MFC to be a social network or what?</br>  <br>Honestly neither of the two really sold me on Revoltechs which is why i didn't collect the other Frames.</br>  <br>I still don't get it.</br>  <br>Don't really know how to explain it better, I'm not the one you're asking anyways.<br>It could use some more shading on the whole.</br></br>  Anyone want to buy my Selvaria?  <br>yeah</br>  <br>Also, shinkis.</br>  <br>I'm excited for hotarumaru</br>  <br>Every time I see more detail of this my heart sinks lower.

Best marathon read I've had in ages, took me way too damn long to start this  <br>To clarify, it gets about 18 pages once every two months in a little bonus booklet that comes with the magazine since the author has an ongoing monthly in the main magazine.<br> I buy the magazine but I haven't got a few chapters in between the newest one and where scans left off. </br></br>    <br>The dancing one, right? It's in my backlog. I should download it one of these days.</br>  <br>The one about the vampire imouto, right? It's not as good as Takagi.</br>    <br>The author sadly disagrees, given he decided to prioritize Kyoko.</br>  <br>It's not up to the author to decide what series runs in the main magazine.</br>  <br>I like vampire imouto more.</br>  <br>He started both series at the same time, and pitched Takagi as a short bimonthly and Kyoko as a longer monthly.</br>  <br>Yes, it's only 11 chapters by now and it's from the same artist of OMK and Molester Man. It's really cute, you'll probably like it.</br>    <br> it's from the same artist of OMK and Molester Man <br>I wouldn't have thought. he's really come some ways, it's been really clean and professional.</br></br>  <br> it's from the same artist of OMK and Molester Man <br>I wouldn't have have guessed.</br></br>    <br>Source?

I remember the first season threads being a lot more fun.  I wish I had a house like this, it looks super comfy.    Kaede. ;_;<br><br>Also, what the fuck is it with country towns and lolly stores? Went to a town for some scones and there was store solely dedicated to lollies in a &lt;1000 town. <br><br>How does the business structure remain profitable?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Were NNB threads always shit? <br>Yes.</br></br>    <br>This one is not even so bad yet.</br>  <br>Stock doesn't go off, doesn't need many staff, small town land rates are probably pretty good for this type of thing.

It's not a joke filename. It's just room 101 actually being empty.</br>  <br>I like this meme.</br>  <br>Guess they are saving the trip for the next ova  or season 3 .</br>  This past episode was just perfect. The teru teru bozu arc was absolutely hilarious and the Flatty-san arc was simply beautiful, from its mono no aware to its heartwarming climax illustrating the innocent, youthful realization of the miracle of life. The climax in particular, the way it was directed with the music and the interspersed shots of nature and the cycle of life... just fucking stunning. Why is this so AOTY?  <br>This episode demonstrated the transient beauty of life in a way I haven't seen since YKK.</br>  <br>Terrible.</br>  <br>I will always remember this scene as the exact moment she became my waifu.</br>  <br>Didn't you see her sniffle and wipe her eyes?</br>  Is there going to be a season 3?   Next episode will be an anime original featuring school pool <br><br>Besides being surprised that the school actually has one, does this mean we will see Hotaru in a school swimsuit  and more Koma-chan misery? </br></br>  <br>I sure hope so. I'm just about ready to move this show into the 1a/1b slot of GOAT SoLs along with ARIA. One more episode this season the quality of S1E04, S1E10 or S2E04 and that should do it.</br>  why isn't Komari wearing her sukumizu?  <br>They appeared fully clothed, not even in swimsuits, while in the pool in the preview.<br> Thank God. The last thing we need is these threads next week circlejerking over middle and elementary schoolers in swimsuits. </br></br>  <br>Since you seem to favour the Renge episodes, what did you think of the OVA? I thought that was around the same level of quality and high amount of Renge-focused introspection.</br>  <br>This hitted me hard, since my dog is sick and getting surgery tomorrow.</br>  <br><br>Well, we technically had that when S1 aired didn't it?</br></br>  <br> S1E10 <br>That episode was magical.</br></br>  <br>I have no mouth and I must scream.</br>  <br>I love every NNB episode and loved the OVA but I'm not sure the OVA lives up to those three episodes I mentioned. I may be biased because the OVA was &lt;720p. <br>I feel that Renge is the show's most unique, entertaining character by a good margin. I don't think those episodes are the best episodes because they're Renge episodes, though. I think it's more that the writing and directing of this show really seem to excel when they're focusing on heartwarming moments and they seem to focus these heartwarming moments around Renge.</br></br>  <br>only if they cry from below.</br>  <br>Good answer. I guess you can't just say all the episodes are great but I agree with what you're saying. I personally find the Natsumi/Komari sisterhood moments to be some of the best heartwarming stuff too, but it might also be a personal bias owing to it reminds me of how me and my sister were as kids. But just the understated thoughtful moments are the best, like when they run away and Natsumi sees that a cat stole food from them to feed her kittens, and that's what finally makes her think "we should go home."<br><br>I hope for more Natsumi/Komari stuff this season, at least one or two episodes.</br></br></br>  Best girl. She'll become a great mother and wife.  <br> She'll become a great mother <br>Will probably need C-section.</br></br>  <br><br>That's not Koma-chan</br></br>  <br> giving birth to children is only something 7 feet tall giantesses can do <br><br>No, anon. No.</br></br></br>  Holy FUCK this show looks depressing. I've never watched this but is this the show's selling point?  <br>Komari is the one who needs a C-section and a 7th-month delivery, Natsumi will be fine.</br>  <br>People will claim otherwise but all the depressing episodes are also the most popular ones.</br>  <br>What a depressing edit.</br>  <br>She was always best girl. If you rewatch S1 and pay attention you will notice that Natsumi is usually very aware of social situations and the feelings of the people around her and acts accordingly. More often than any other character she does small things and gestures that makes others feel good about themselves and have fun. This episode was just the most obvious example.</br>  <br>This post contain so much truth</br>  <br> entire anime original episode <br><br>Does the school really have a pool in the manga?</br></br></br>  <br> the temptation of the shovel <br>She's so used to digging graves for Vietnamese children that it's become a reflex.</br></br>  <br> crop her shop her <br>CROP HER SHOP HER DROP HER TOP HER BOP HER COP HER MOP HER HOP HER</br></br>  <br>Give me templates.</br>  <br> Tfw the only time we see Renge smiling is when she's wearing a mask she made herself <br>This shit is too heavy for me.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I don't understand but I like it.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>I thought that was Koma.

This past episode helped a lot. It was as well-done as anything in The Origination.<br>Akari is amazing. I think Renge is equally amazing as a character.</br></br>  <br>Aria is better but NNB has it's own appeal aswell</br>  <br>They are both worse than gochusa and kinmosa</br>  <br>NNB isn't finished, will have half the episodes, and won't be able to conclude like Aria did.</br>  Wait, what? Hotarun arrived again? What it's going on?  <br> kinmosa <br><br>I disagree, NNB and ARIA have struck me more heavily and more emotionally than that gay shit ever will.<br>It is not comparable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> and won't be able to conclude like Aria did. <br>In terms of literal method or quality? If quality, there's a hell of an assumption, as it's a hell of an assumption to assume that this season will be the last season of the show.<br>I think if you go back and rewatch the first 17 episodes of ARIA and NNB, you'll find that NNB, in this case, is quite a bit better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Flashbacks and/or timetravel. Possibly drugs.</br></br>  What's wrong with Vivid? "memes" is not an answer, I'd like tangible replies and examples.  <br>And none of those will be remembered in the next 5 years<br>Aria is start in 2007, it's been 8 years and it's still regarded as one of the best iyashikei<br>I can see people will talk about NNB in the next 5 years<br>I'm not even sure if you're baiting</br></br></br></br>  <br>NNB isn't very emotional though. It's comfy and healing, same as kinmosa and gochusa. (Those those 2 have more comedy and less comfort)</br>  <br>I've been disappointed far too many times to believe that anything will get a complete adaptation.</br>  <br>I have Hidamari Sketch as my all time heavyweight champion of SoLs, but Aria and NNB are also good, as are all SoLs. I don't think we should enter into a heated discussion about which one is best, but simply enjoy them in our own way.</br>  <br>S1 certainly sold like hotcakes. I expect a sales boost from this past episode as well. I know it wasn't just me and this ANN reviewer talked about in another thread right now who thought this past episode was extremely special.</br>  <br>Not him but im curently re-watching all three sesason of ARIA, it's still as enjoyable and as relaxing as the first time i watching it<br>NNB has it own charm but ARIA is still the best in the last decade</br></br>  <br>I think the main advantage ARIA has is the soundtrack. I love them both so much.</br>   "Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until their death. I shall take no cycle ride, hold no flute, father no shrimps. I shall wear no twin tails and win no test. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the tank. I am the shield that guards the realms of tadpole shrimps. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come."   <br>Kinmosa and Gochiusa might actually be talked about 5-10 years from now as SoL trendsetters. They've practically carved out a new subgenre for themselves, a subgenre with yuri as a primary draw and seemingly painstakingly engineered to be as hyper-cute as possible, even moreso than in the past of Japan's famously kawaii-obsessed culture.<br>I'm not saying they're great anime. They're cute so I like them but they're not great. Outside of their cuteness, and Karen, they're fairly average.</br></br>  <br>No, anon. Just no.</br>  Not gonna lie, this episode felt a bit forced, it was cute and all, but the funny part and the sad part both felt like they were trying too hard with the given situation respectively.<br><br>Even so, great episode, but is gonna be very difficult to top keitai or ruler warfare.</br></br>  <br>Terrible taste.</br>  <br> this episode felt a bit forced <br>It was pretty much the least forced-feeling drama I've seen in a long fucking time in anime. Opinions.</br></br>  <br>I liked the funny part, but yeah I agree the sad part felt a little forced.</br>  <br><br>They're the best, so of course trolls be trollan. Just check their releases for yourself and see the difference to the competition.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeah, if you gonna compare it to the rest of anime, it applies NNB as a whole.<br><br>For NNB standards this episode was jut a tad forced, but this is my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> a little girl is sad because her pets died <br>yeah too forced better kill off Hotaru that is real drama</br></br>  <br>You know nothing Ren-chan.</br>  <br><br>How was it forced? It was a simple, plausible mono no aware story about how life is short but beautiful in its simultaneous transience and permanence.</br></br>  <br><br>That was the given situation, nothing forced about it, but the delivery felt a bit forced.<br><br>Notice how I use the word "feel", something about it that I can't quite put finger on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw oniichan knows where to hide the body, needs not say a word </br>  <br>What was Hotaru's crime for her to be sent to the shacks?</br>  <br>I just learned that Tadpole Shrimp are shitty pets. Why did nobody warn her before getting too attached? Bullies, all of them.</br>  <br>ferrets are the worse than shrimp, though<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ofd<wbr>Jc6ePI1g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I couldn't stop imagining it's yotsuba in that raincoat. I think that silhouette got somehow ingrained in my mind</br>  Notice that this season the staff put more effort on Renge's outfit, they look more pretty and cute than plan and simple like last season  season 2 is so much worse than season 1<br><br>fuck renge, obnoxious character</br></br>  Kill la Kill thread  5/10 anime thread?  <br>no</br>  <br>yes</br>  yes  The drama near the end was shit. Liked the funnier parts before though. Nonon needed more screentime.  <br> Nonon, secret voodoo priestess. <br><br>It would explain the midget status.</br></br></br>  I wonder what careers Mako and Ryuuko will end up doing when they grow up.  that would be an interesting thing to know    <br>Ryuko is a less shitty Shadow the Hedgehog</br>  <br><br>That's just Shadow the Hedgehog in glasses anon. Take that shit to </br></br>  I love Mako's happy ending.  <br>Ryuko always looks so good in casual clothes.</br>  <br>Mako becomes a doctor or a nurse, Ryuko becomes a life fiber scientist to return Senketsu from space.</br>  <br>There's art of her dressed like the witches in Little witch academia</br>  Did someone say best girl thread?  You don't need daily threads for this, you have nothing more to talk about.  <br>If you recolour Amanda yea.</br>  Post best boy  <br>My inner normalfag was cringing at this scene. What a creep</br>  <br> Implying you wouldn't give in to sensei's shining nipples. </br>    <br/>   treats his parents like shit <br> sits on the computer all day <br> processes every useless piece of info on the internet <br> can't be bothered to do anything that disrupts his precious data collection time <br><br>Why is he not /a/'s favorite character?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OK</br>  So what was your favorite episode, mine was the one with the traps and that girl with glasses  <br>The one that aired last week on Toonami just for Ryuuko describing herself and everyone as "WTF all the way."</br>  <br>yes</br>    <br> boy <br> boy <br> clothing <br> boy <br>YOU'RE WRONG ANON</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No-Late day a best</br>  OT 3   <br>If girls can be clothes, than clothes can be boys, I'm expert on fashion, anon.</br>  Why does every anime have a baseball episode? Can someone please explain this to me?  I'M GONNA GET INTO KOSHIEN  Baseball and graffiti episodes were the best ones.  <br>Doesn't nippons kid leagues actually do good against other countries kids leagues? Or was that taco land?</br>  <br>ROTNS! BRING BACK DA FURYO STYLE!</br>  I wonder if scheduling is a factor. Anime airs in winter? Gotta have a Christmas episode. Airs in summer, baseball episode.
