I find it better than Love Plus, except for the fact that LP doesn't really end after giving the girl the  kiss.  Too bad it isn't popular due to lack of translation.</br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me that I will never see the cake route  faggot </br>  <br>I vaguely remember this show. Didn't it try to push creep shots as some sort of artistic expression of beauty or some shit?</br>  <br>Just the members of the Photography, which was separate from the Photo Club.</br>  Did anyone like housewife  <br>They can have a relationship in the game.</br>  <br>My nigga</br>    <br><br>Softball &gt; Camera &gt; Imouto</br></br>  Who needs big tits...  <br>Who?</br>  <br>When you got ass like this!</br>  <br>She's what made me realize that flat can be good, the student council president from Eiken taught me to appreciate the ass.</br>  <br>I'd prefer them</br>   Ninja best girl     <br>I do. I'd eat her hamburgers if you know what I mean.</br>    <br>Yes I love her. I'd eat her cooking all day</br>  Make way, cringe inducing review of the show.<br><br>http://www.themanime.org/viewreview<wbr>.php?id=1590</wbr></br></br>  <br> © 1996-2015 <br>He came back? I thought he stopped his shitty reviews two years ago?</br></br>      <br><br>Seriously the best. Does she have a manga for her like Haruka?</br></br>    <br>Probably?<br>There's like 6 manga and a light novel.</br></br>    <br> those tits <br><br>I forgot about this show, but she made my dick diamonds. What's her route in the game like?</br></br></br>  Translation of prologue soon  entei08<br> Prologue is a philosophical-ish analysis of the world ending. <br><br> Chapter 1 part 1, Touma being chased on the bike by the darkness thing in the blurb, he manages to slide under a train thanks to its high specs to in order to escape.  <br> The bike can go up to 50kph, lean 70 degrees without falling over, auto stance recover, electronic controlled shock absorbers, can jump to a height of 20 metres. <br><br> part 2 onward., Komoe cries that Touma is in danger of repeating a year.  <br> Therefore he must undertake this criminal awareness event right now, on top of extra classes in the winter break to even have a chance of not staying back a year. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The event is basically having students play the role of criminals, police and hostages.  <br> The three idiots play as criminals, wearing a skin-colored tightsuit and white trunks.  <br> Aogami manages to incur the rage of Fukiyose somehow and bought collateral damage to his two friends.  <br> In order to escape, Touma literally ran up the school building wall from the third floor and succeeded.  <br> Just when he is about to run up to the fourth floor (still on the wall btw), Misaka playing as the police walks past the school and spots him in his hilariously embarrassing outfit, like a pervert looking into a building. <br> Just before the encounter Misaka was actually mulling over the events of NT 10, conflicted but determined to talk to Touma about it in a way that wouldn't hurt the boy.  <br> The sight of his pathetic self enraged/embarrased her so much, Touma almost got a railgun up his ass.  <br> Just before this can happen, Seria opens a window and lets Touma inside the building, specifically, her secret base.  <br> Seria plays a hostage but couldn't be bothered about this whole event.  <br> She generously offers to share her snacks and flirts with Touma a bit, randomly throwing out a comment about how Touma's screams of horror when she opened the window reminds her of a monster being treated like a human after stones were thrown at him.  <br> It could be alluding to Touma's childhood horrors when people treated him like a plague, so maybe Seria knows about his past.  <br> Preview ends here. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The sight of his pathetic self enraged/embarrased her so much, Touma almost got a railgun up his ass.  <br><br>What a fucking bitch.</br></br></br>  <br> Wall running Touma <br>Ordinary High School Student passing through.</br></br>  <br>In other words, translation for best girl's volume is soon.</br>  <br> best girl </br>  <br>Deal with it.</br>  <br><br>Misaka is the qtest.</br></br>  <br> bitch <br> cute <br>Nope.</br></br></br>  <br> Cover is Misaka <br> Actually a Seira volume <br>Let it happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, THK. I'm tired of your shit.</br>  <br>I don't care.</br>    <br> Just before the encounter Misaka was actually mulling over the events of NT 10, conflicted but determined to talk to Touma about it in a way that wouldn't hurt the boy.  <br>Biri trying her best to deal with her tsun side.</br></br>  <br>Too bad she's shit at it.</br>  How many people saying "what a bitch" about Mikoto's comedy scene that doesn't make a damn bit of difference beyond being unfunny and old praise Othinus? Im guessing a lot.  <br>Resolution to end it all soon. I'm routing for BRO end.</br>  <br>Same</br>  <br>Zero. Only THK goes retard and nitpicks Mikoto because she's popular.</br>  So how many of you picked up this series for best boy?  <br> Only THK hates Mikoto <br><br>Can you please stop this stupidity?</br></br></br>  <br>Me! I went into this series a long time ago for no one but Accelerator. Still here for Accelerator, and Misaka genepool</br>  <br>Is she ok?<br>Her hair are going through her eyelashes.</br></br>  I want to spend eternity with Mikoto.<br><br><br>I wish I could live happily in AC with her.</br></br></br>  <br> live happily <br> In Academy City <br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is why Itsuwa is the best girl. She is a nice and mature girl that doesn't hurt or abuse Touma and is the most ideal and useful partner for him.</br>  <br>He wants your attention just ignore him.</br>  <br> Implying I said that <br>THK pls.</br></br>  <br> Zero. Only THK goes retard and nitpicks Mikoto because she's popular. <br> ONLY <br>That is exactly what you said. Its time to accept that the world doesn't revolve around you</br></br></br>  <br> What is context to 's post <br>Stop trying so hard, THK. It makes you obvious. You can't even prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>You can always shit yourself and spend your time with the turd. Same thing.</br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br>"THK" also hates Index.</br>  <br>Orsola is the only one he's walked in on who hasn't beat the shit out of him.</br>  <br>Too bad nuns can't marry.</br>  <br>No obvious signs of his distinctive autism has been directed at Index in the past, so nope.</br>  <br>So your logic is shit. People love to rip Index apart when she gets comedy scenes with Touma.</br>  What is it with /a/ and their boogeyman mentality. It's not like there's only one Mikoto hater. Not everyone thinks the same and /a/ isn't really a hive mind either.<br><br>Though it's funny: you all look like idiots. Please continue.<br><br><br>Time for best girl? Time for best girl!<br><br> The sight of his pathetic self enraged/embarrased her so much, Touma almost got a railgun up his ass.  <br><br>Classic Mikoto.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Waiting for Othinus to steal the spotlight from Misaka.  <br>I fear for the backlash if that happens. There is literally nothing Mikoto has or can do against the Nordic goddess in terms of power, importance and relevance for Touma and the plot.</br>  <br> all those horrible jpg artifacts <br> image.jpg <br>Jesus Christ how horrifying, how do you fuck up this badly? Do you not know how to save images even on a phone?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not /a/. It's just a couple of faggots that are forcing this THK shit in almost every series they can.<br><br>Though it's funny, you see people hating tsunderes in Oreimo and Infinite Stratos threads all the time, yet the THK boogeyman is forced by no one. This leads me to suspect it's just the work of a delusional samefag who wants to force his spacegoat and his lack of presence and activity can be noted in threads for the two aforementioned series.</br></br></br>  <br>finally a man of taste to save us all</br>  <br>Impossible. She's now a exposition side character, which is Index's original role. They both share the role of Touma's encyclopedia against magic stuff(in short, as side-kicks) and I assume they won't have as much appearance time as Mikoto in this volume.</br>  <br>There is going to be a shitposting like no fucking tomorrow if the pattern continues with touma and girl on cover and girl has some kind of setback.<br><br> NT10 Othinus turned 15cm <br> NT11 Touma cant remember anything about Misaki <br> NT12 Index role is that of a support character <br> NT13 Misaka's turn <br> <br>I still wonder if the 15cm Othinus really is a setback, she still going strong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>has toma ever walked in on itsuwa? until he does we won't know</br>   Mikoto hyped up again <br> Plot derails to Seria <br> Touma has to save the world again and repeats the year <br> Volume ends with Mikoto having done nothing but assault Touma again. <br><br>Cool</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Othinus is the current main heroine. Misaka is a secondary heroine. Othinus has a shit ton of more impact on Touma than Misaka ever could have.</br>  <br> spacegoat </br>  <br>Othinus' role is still an enigma. No one is sure if her current miniature status is permanent or if she can go back to her normal Magic God form at will or triggered by something else. <br><br>She's at least one of the few logical characters that could actually help against another magic god.</br></br></br>  <br>Oddly enough the "poster" he is rabidly chasing is also absent. Kind of strange that those "two" always appear together and never separately.</br>  <br> Othinus is the current main heroine. <br>Delusions much? She's just "another girl Touma rescued".<br><br><br>With her knowledge, yes. But as of now that's all she can do.</br></br></br></br></br>   Now, on the other hand, there is an entirely different type of angel; and here we must be especially careful to remember that we include gods and devils, for there are such beings who are not by any means dependent on one particular element for their existence. They are microcosms in exactly the same sense as men and women are. They are individuals who have picked up the elements of their composition as possibility and convenience dictates, exactly as we do ourselves... I believe that the Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this order. He is something more than a man, possibly a being who has already passed through the stage of humanity, and his peculiarly intimate relationship with his client is that of friendship, of community, of brotherhood, or Fatherhood. <br><br>Othinus best girl.</br></br>  <br>Nah man. Othinus isn't even in the same category as the other girls. She's by far the most important girl for Touma's character.</br>  <br> She's by far the most important girl for Touma's character. <br>You mean another mouth for Touma to feed. Like I said: she's sidekick-zoned like Index.</br></br>  <br>Fukiyose book when?</br>  <br>You're fucking delusional. THK is real, and here's the biggest example of his existence.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/118694<wbr>586/<br>Look through the ghost. There was around 300 posts made by him.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>You dragged me here.</br>  <br>So THK is a bot? You do realize that you don't need to be human to spam in the archive, right?</br>  <br>And I assume you have proof that THK is posting here? That he really is this THK character and not another anon with the same style or opinion?</br>  <br>We finally getting Seria volume?</br>  <br> Most imporant characters to Touma <br> Index <br> Othinus <br><br>NT9 and NT10 showed us just how far Touma would go for index and an unbreakable bond was created in NT10 with Touma and Othinus.<br><br>Misakafags just dont want to accept that Touma sees Misaka as nothing more than a friend. <br><br>COMPARE WHEN MISAKA SAVES TOUMA AND OTHINUS SAVES HIM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sssh. Don't argue with Othinusfags. I look forward to them shitting themselves when they get BTFO just like all the other girls.  <br>There's captcha on the archives.</br>  <br>Being relegated to sidekick zone doesn't invalidate what I said about her, and doesn't mean she can't be relevant again. She can perfectly steal the spotlight in this volume and it would be fitting for her character and role in the story.</br>  <br>How long until Touma cuts bullets out of the air with his bare hands, like any normal high school student?</br>  <br>I hope she gets her own novel like Misaki did</br>  <br> COMPARE WHEN MISAKA SAVES TOUMA AND OTHINUS SAVES HIM <br><br> COMPARE ORANGES AND MELONS! <br><br>No. Try comparing how Touma saved the two from death first. Touma showed equal determination for both, battling beings more powerful than him.<br><br>And while Orthinus is an encyclopedia now, Mikoto can fully support Touma as an L5 electromaster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> captcha <br><br>Kek. Even the captcha in 4chan can be bypassed.</br></br></br>  <br>The only Level 5 that can help Touma against the magic side is Accel.</br>  <br>Is that Yukari form Persona 3?</br>  <br> you see people hating tsunderes in Oreimo and Infinite Stratos threads all the time, yet the THK boogeyman is forced by no one <br>Maybe that's cause a lot more people hate/used to hate Kirino and Houki whereas Mikoto is more or less popular<br>At least she used to be, maybe not anymore</br></br></br>  <br> implying captcha bypass on 4chan <br>If it was bypassed that easily, people would sell the advertising method to the people who run spam bots for money, rather than use it to spam animu opinions. <br><br>With passes they'd be quickly revoked if they contained advertising content.</br></br></br></br>  <br> fighting accel =/= fighting the world <br>ok<br>  Mikoto can fully support Touma as an L5 electromaster <br><br>ahhahahahahahahah, oh god you can't be serious. Mikoto is helpless against the magic side. I'd take my chances with the mini god.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She lost to YukinoSHITa Yukino in the last yearly LN poll.</br>  JS06<br>FINISH HEAVY OBJECT<br>FUCKING<br>HELL</br></br></br>  <br> tfw i only read the LN because some anon said he fights some broken guy called fiamma with his new wings <br> tfw it was all a lie </br></br>  <br>Mikoto, Mugino and Kakine can hold their own against any magician.<br><br>Though Accel might be the only guy who can 1v1 against a Magic god. Not even Touma can win in an outright fight with one. He won against Orthinus because he got to her feels.</br></br></br>  <br>Touma showed personal and emotional attachment for Othinus though. And there are all those scenes where they flirt and bond with each other. Where they clearly enjoy being with each other. Mikoto never got anything of that level, and she is one of the least useful characters for Touma against the current threats.</br>  <br> Can hold their own against any Magician <br> Accel 1v1 against a Magic God <br><br>Anon, what are you doing?</br></br></br></br>  <br> No. Try comparing how Touma saved the two from death first. Touma showed equal determination for both, battling beings more powerful than him. <br><br>Accel never had shit on Touma while Touma fought the world for Othinus<br><br> And while Orthinus is an encyclopedia now, Mikoto can fully support Touma as an L5 electromaster. <br><br> implying Misaka can actually give support vs a magic god <br><br>I cant wait to see how much bs this volume is going to be. <br><br>I bet this person who comes to help is going to do all the fighting against the magic god.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto, Mugino and Kakine can hold their own against any magician. <br>Not against saints, only Kakine would be able to hold his own.<br><br> Though Accel might be the only guy who can 1v1 against a Magic god.  <br>You're not serious right? I don't think you understand just how out there magic gods are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto confirmed Saint tier, of course she can.</br>  <br>No need to lie anon, magic side niggas are weak as fuck besides the saints.</br>  <br> Mikoto never got anything of that level <br>Touma entertains Mikoto's chases and even chats with her. Remember Daihaisei?</br></br>  <br>It's not easy, but it can be done. Accel spammer even returned some months ago to spam some threads. I imagine the captcha of the archive is much easier to bypass.</br>  <br>To be fair, Crowley BTFO the Magic Gods in the last volume, so Kamachi can do whatever he wants at this point and just point to them being weakened by that.</br>  <br>Shit yeah, but last year was the year of Yahari. Watari's LN sweeped virtually every category (best artist, best boy, etc) if I remember right. <br><br>And it's not like teh Biri slid out of rankings, she still took 2. Compare to Kuroneko and Sena who literally disappeared when they used to be in the top 10 all the time. Though I suppose their respective series ending may have had something to do with it</br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto, Mugino and Kakine can hold their own against any magician. <br>only kakine and that is under the impression magicians can't make a way to fuck him up.<br><br> Though Accel might be the only guy who can 1v1 against a Magic god <br><br> 1v1 against a Magic god <br><br>WHAT</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel never had shit on Touma while Touma fought the world for Othinus <br><br>That's rich. Accel beat Touma to death. Touma won on purely plot armour.</br></br></br>  <br>What surprised me the most about it wasn't so much how much Yahari was on there but rather the fact that Othinus somehow made it into the top 10.</br>  <br> You're not serious right? I don't think you understand just how out there magic gods are. <br>Crowley powered them down remember?<br><br>Also they did mention Magic Gods have to power down when entering reality.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> THK apologists to a serious autist spams and recognizable hate posts, to the point of using the same old arguments every single time <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> all the non saint gods right seat <br> vasila <br> knight leader <br> the queen <br> carissa <br> thor <br> marian <br> any of gremlin <br> birdway <br> crowley himself <br> weak <br>ok</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's really nothing special. He does the same with his other friends. It would be completely different if there was and actual flirtatious intent, emotion involved from his part and most importantly, mutual development.</br>  <br> Crowley powered them down remember? <br>No, he just made it possible to kill them, they're still at the very top of the magic side.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Shut up please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And you think that means Accel can beat one? Anon 50/50 othinus would have fucking killed Accel.</br>  <br>Welcome to R/a/ildex threads, where autism reigns supreme. Wait till people tell you it used to be SO much worse back when NT3 came out.</br>  <br>If the magic gods were now so weak that even Accel could fucking beat one there wouldn't be any point to hype the volume as much as they've been doing.</br>  <br> That's really nothing special. He does the same with his other friends. <br>And also with Orthinus and with Misaki way back, according to flashback. Try wearing that shipping goggles less tight next time.</br></br>  <br>Technically only 50/50 chance, like everyone else (though I guess if you interpret NT 8 to mean Othinus was fated to win the whole time it doesn't matter).<br><br>But yeah, it's completely asinine to try and put Accel on the level of Magic Gods, it took his white wings for him to barely survive the equivalent of Fiamma throwing a hissy fit.</br></br></br>  So like the usual Index spoiler threads, the posts at the top are the only info and the rest of the thread is pointless waifushit, right?  <br>Correct.</br>  <br>The Magic Gods could only be killed by time travel or something like that preventing them from even becoming a Magic God in the first place. To kill any of them, Accel'd have to wisen up and not go vector/deflection/wings spam on them.</br>  <br> Anon 50/50 othinus would have fucking killed Accel. <br><br>That's because she has the ability to win 100% at 50% of the time. That ability is OP but it also means that she can get rekt at 50%.<br><br><br> there wouldn't be any point to hype the volume as much as they've been doing <br><br>No, the point of the hype is on the cover.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So the Mikoto shit posting begins. How can one cute girl cause so much butthurt?  <br>Yes. In fact I was just about to tell you thARRRGGGHHH KANZAKI HELP ME, IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN</br>  <br> Misaki <br>Pre-memory loss Touma doesn't count.<br><br> Othinus <br>Is the one I'm talking about. Don't just ignore all their scenes in NT10, their history in NT9 and the context. Not to mention that being in a desperate adventure together helps being way more intimate than just casual meetings. You have to be really delusional to think the level of closeness and development of Mikoto with Touma is nowhere near Othinus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so have those 2 fucked yet or at least confessed.....</br>  <br>Magic gods can time travel anon</br>  <br>Literally the only difference between Othinus and a true Magic God is that their chance of victory is at 100% instead of 50%. They both have infinite power.<br><br>Also it turned out no, she couldn't get wrecked. Remember NT 8? The whole arc was one big flip of the coin and it came up heads, she was always going to win.</br></br></br>  <br> she can get rekt at 50% <br>Doesn't matter. She won't die and will just try again.</br></br>  <br> Wait till people tell you it used to be SO much worse back when NT3 came out. <br><br>But it was. People even spammed guro images and bestiality doujins back then.</br></br></br>   Don't just ignore all their scenes in NT10, their history in NT9 and the context. <br><br>If you say that then don't go ignoring all the other girls Touma has history with.<br><br> Pre-memory loss Touma doesn't count. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If she only wins 50% of the time, statistically speaking it's better to get a semi powerful ability which could troll about 90% of weak opponents 100% of the time than a 50%/50% chance you'd be defeated by a blade of grass.<br><br><br>If you kill them or their ancestors before they become a magical god they'd never have been able to time travel in the first place, rendering the magic god timeline defunct.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Accelerator will be the strongest character by the end of the series.  she did what?  <br><br>Miku</br></br>  Why is Miku such a huge fucking faggot?  Spare a thought for poor K2  first for shirabe a best  Preview pictures when?  Here you go Symphags, I took the pic from &gt;127659218 and made a cleaner version.  <br>It's a weird pose without the logo hiding most of it</br>  Predictions for episode 2?<br> Elfnein saves Hibiki from 2hu beams <br> Tsubasa gets her power sucked out by Phara and she and Maria have to be bailed out by Ogawa <br> Chris fights Leiur alone until Hibiki arrives </br></br></br>  <br><br>That protrusion is starting to not look like a berserk leg to me anymore.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, if you compare it to her boot in the op it's pretty similar just with all of the points exaggerated outward and sharpened.</br>  <br>Pretty sure her other leg is supposed to be there somewhere<br><br>Lewd</br></br></br>  <br><br>You can see her other leg better with this image.</br></br>  <br>Something crazy going on with her scarf.

Probably less in terms of quantity, but just as much in terms of quality.<br>Hibiki's team fought 4 other Symphogear enemies, befriending all 4 and giving them all the lesbian syndrome. Add to this 2 big bads (including 1 who went somewhat into the befriended category) and an unknown (very high) number of Noise monsters.<br>Nanoha in two seasons befriended 2 magic users, also infecting both with the gay, 1 big bad, 4 knights and 1 book.<br><br>Between a S2 Hibiki punch and a S2 Starlight Breaker, the raw befriending amount is mostly equivalent, despite having opposite classes (Hibiki is very-very-very-close quarters, Nanoha is mid-to-long-ranged friendship Raising Heart fuck yeah).<br>Both would probably end up befriending themselves. That said, Fate and Tsubasa would probably feel awkward together in the same scene. Hibiki also has the advantage of starting up already in a gay relationship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hibiki's team fought 4 other Symphogear enemies <br>5, if you count  Hibiki's girlfriend.

Micha and Garie probably won't appear until later.</br>  <br>to be fair maria is probably more of a detriment.</br>  <br> Chino is the final boss of Symphoger GX <br>I see we are destined to not take any other Symphogear antagonist seriously after Fine.</br></br>  <br>Well, yeahlchemists have been known to manipulate the four elements.</br>  <br><br>Both their designs are shit so no.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd order her if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't like hat loli <br>You は shit</br></br>  <br>While I love the "Maria is useless" meme as much as the next guy  except I don't, she's my favorite  living  character , she was shown to be fast enough and skilled enough to fight it, just not strong enough to actually damage/disable it without her GEAH. That said, you could probably sell the argument that the autoscorer was holding back, knowing it didn't need to use it's full strength against an essentially unarmed human.</br>  <br>as much as I love the maria is useless meme as well, I was actually being serious here.<br>2 on 1 doesn't help much when 1 member clearly outclasses the second, and tsubasa doing blade flips all over the place means maria needs to stay the fuck back. maria being there means tsubasa has to keep track of her as well as the doll to make sure no harm comes to maria by accident or if the doll wants to use her as a distraction.</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it yellow vs Chris? Red and Blue would probably go for the 2 kids.</br></br>  <br>Knocked out.</br>  <br>I more meant that Maria was show to be fast/agile enough to dodge, meaning Tsubasa wouldn't have to worry about defending her, rather than Maria being of any actual help. Just that she wouldn't necessarily be a detriment.</br>  <br>What if Phara actually has an AoE though? She's wind and those types usually have an area wide attack. She only used it as a barrier against bullets but it's easy to see her also using it all around her forcing Tsubasa to defend Maria.</br>  <br>just because she might be fast enough doesn't mean tsubasa wants to be doing crazy shit near her. and the doll isn't really an enemy you can let your focus stray from. the simple fact that maria is nearby is enough to fuck with tsubasa even if its just a little, and unlike chris or hibiki she can't rely on maria to do anything because she doesn't have a gear.</br>  Maria will be useful. Just awit for it.  <br>I began to watch this<br>just got the ZENBU part and I'm loving it</br></br>  <br>Remember, no survivors.</br>  <br><br>useful for breeding once ver comes out of jail</br></br>  <br>she grows outside being the villain of the week, right</br>  <br>Chris was such a great partially-insane antagonist back then.</br>  <br> once ver comes out of jail <br>I wonder if they ever visited Ver. Whether for reconciliation or the drugs.</br></br>  <br>Symphogear picked up during Bikki's "ご飯＆ご飯" speech for me.</br>  <br>She becomes a protagonist towards the end of S1 and remains as such in S2 and S3</br>  <br>Things were much simpler back then.<br><br>Nehustan+Ichaival Chris was probably the best antagonist of the series. Will Carol beat the record?</br></br></br>  <br><br>She is too moefied though. Like, she's the best when she's fighting. I understand the appeal of gap moe, but I do want more of that side of her.</br></br>   Wanted to post Chris's transformation sequence from Symphogear G <br> It's down due to authors' right <br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>Well, you know.</br>  <br>She becomes  best girl </br>  Tsundere moe blob Chris is best Chris.  <br>She does hold the record for  the most stupid betrayal ever  thanks to S2.<br><br>Watching S1 fully unspoiled makes for a lot of great moments, including pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's the only thing you need,</br>  <br>It's in the official channel anon.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CWD<wbr>zq63AvuM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>The ZENBU part where she switches to Ichaival was incredibly hype. Not sure if Carol can pull it off because she's not as active, but maybe one of the dolls can.</br>  <br>It's important to note that the befriending is slow and painful, making it more compelling than the average.</br>  <br>   the most stupid betrayal ever <br> But it's obvious that that was just so she could get close to Ver and get the cane. <br>Or do you mean that's the stupid thing?</br></br></br>  <br>The hero always escapes from jail eventually, right?</br>  <br>She's shooting death rays at Hibiki in the first episode, how much more active do you want?</br>  <br>I really want her to go sword&amp;board or twohander with Airgetlam for the full paladin mode but knowing Symphogear it will probably be something crazy like giant hands.</br>  <br>I'm hoping the plot point about the FIS girls still needing linker means he has a shot to make an appearance.</br>  <br>She's already carrying Tsubasa's baby.</br>  <br>you guys know they have their own version of linker. ver's wasn't anything that special.</br>  <br>They had linker without him though, it's been in since the first episode.</br>  <br>It was though. His LiNKER was a lot safer.</br>  <br><br> In the Playstation game Wild Arms 2 which was created by the same producer of Symphogear, Airgetlam is a main plot item that basically drove the entire story of that game. In game, Airgetlam is a legendary holy silver sword that grants people immense power and make them heroes to defeat evil, but will drain the wielder's soul to fuel its power. Anyone completely drained of their soul dies and their soul wanders in the lost void forever. </br></br>  Since they accented the Bikkibutt in Bikkies transformation and will accent the ZENBUS in Chris', what will be the focus of Tsubasa's transformation?  <br>kanade's linker wasn't dangerous she was just retarded about it and started fighting without having any in her system.<br>that and she ODed on it like a retard.</br></br>  <br>Ver's LiNKER was much, much better than anything the 2nd Division had in G, and if Chris's words are anything to go by, they still don't have anything matching that.</br>  <br>The flatness of her blade.</br>  <br>Her  sword .</br>  <br>Jamface.</br>  <br>Her  uselessness .<br><br>You knew this was coming anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really.<br>The gothlolis were going to be badly harmed when singing their superb songs but Hibiki absorbed the energy instead.</br></br>  <br>Vagina bones window.</br>  <br><br>His was better wasn't it? Unless I'm remembering it wrongly. If they do go back to the old one, I guess that's interesting too since there's more danger to actually choosing to go into battle and making it more heroic.</br></br>  <br>they just didn't have any linker on hand. I'm assuming the gears don't get called into action that often so they don't carry it around everywhere.<br><br>I don't recall seeing anywhere it said it was better, the linker they used on kanade wasn't bad, she was fighting without it so it fucked her over.</br></br></br>  <br> everything <br><br><br>That's one of the biggest misconceptions people have about S1 though. Even Zoid made the same mistake.<br><br><br>They sure weren't harmed when they hit each other with them near the end of G.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is actually the most likely. She didn't really have a 'charm point' before, but the vagina bones are a possibility.</br>  <br> that's one of the biggest misconceptions <br>what was it then? I'm pretty sure the keywords explicitly say that it was because of the lack of linker that she died.</br></br>  <br>Her new motorcycle.</br>  <br>It's not related - the lack of LiNKER was because Fine's plan involved both taking the Nehushtan and killing Kanade. She intentionally deprived her of it for some time.</br>  <br> not having linker is not related to her not having linker while fighting <br>anon what the fuck is wrong with you?</br></br>  <br>If Linker deprivation makes you puke blood too like she did in the manga it sure doesn't sound like it's a safe drug.</br>  <br>Whatever that thing is supposed to be it will take our ride to a whole other level of crazy.</br>  <br>the puking blood thing was from overdosing rather than deprivation.<br>which I guess is 1 thing ver's had over theirs, but that's not really a confirmed thing.<br><br>plus I doubt the defense force's scientists were just jacking off the whole time and didn't improve it all this time later.</br></br></br></br>   Chris <br> 153cm <br> B90/W57/H85 <br><br> Hibiki <br> 157 cm <br> B84/W58/H86 <br><br>Chris is an angry, tiny and fluffy moe blob.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was puking blood in the manga shortly before the Zwei Wing concert, when she supposedly wasn't on Linker</br>  <br>Kanade specifically says in the manga that it's because of deprivation.</br>  Symphhogear movie never  <br><br>manga is half canon and she was basically their lab rat so I wouldn't be surprised if she was fucked from lots of different things.<br>plus you have to remember she originally had 0 compatibility with symphogear. the only reason she could use it in the first place was because she fucked her body up really hard.</br></br></br>  Remember when /a/ said for a long time that Kirika and Shirabe's songs was a duet. Remember all the versions made by fans? Remember how it ended up being one of the best song from Symphogeah G?  Cute !!!  <br> best song from G <br>but that's wrong.</br></br>  <br>GX design statues fucking when?</br>  <br>That's very sexy. She didn't feel shorter than everyone when she was introduced in the nehushtan armor but imagining it in retrospect is funny.</br>  <br>This. It's the best song from the whole show.</br>    <br>I don't really like that channel.<br>They cut parts of the fights for no reason and make the video look like it's telling you the anime isn't that cool.</br></br>  <br>Never, just like G, enjoy more bunny Chris recolors.</br>  <br>S1E7 has the best 3 minutes of the series.<br>http://a.uguu.se/bewibp.webm</br></br>  <br>Never</br>  This show is so super good; fun, entertain, hot blood music, over-the-top fighting, etc.. thanks for let me know this show /a/ <br>I love Nana-chan and Aoi-chan</br>  I'm looking forward to having fun with you /sg/  <br> cringy charts <br>no more please</br></br>  <br>What did we ever do to deserve this</br>  <br> not loving cringy charts <br>I bet you think symphogear is only okay too.</br></br>  <br> Actually liking cringy charts <br>I like when the reaction charts aren't full of cringy text.

Even with this not just anyone can become a Symphogear user, provided that the subject a certain degree of compatibility, LiNKER can force that rate higher and bring them to the status of acquired candidacy. Of course this process takes a large toll on the human body and it's not uncommon for subjects to receive a shock to their system which results in unconsciousness. Before the drug started producing results it left a lot of dead, or crippled subjects that demonstrated the dangers of the intense medicinal process. It was for this purpose that LiNKER was further developed with an active time limit and method in which it was cleansed from the body. However these techniques were only obtained by data that Ryoko gained through leaking LiNKER into the black market, and by using it on the test subject Amou Kanade. F.I.S. has a large biochemistry research division that progressed this even further. Under the charge of Dr. Ver the project proceeded under the theme of "Pleasant for you" and managed to develop a safer form of LiNKER with a very small physical burden and a more thorough cleansing process. Maria, Shirabe and Kirika are all acquired candidates that use LiNKER. Originally they were part of the "Receptor Children" project that was designed to take orphans and use them as vessels for Fine's soul. However one day, Serena demonstrated a remarkably high compatibility rate with the Symphogear and it was hurriedly decided to put all the children through a patch test to isolate those with compatibility. Thus in the end when the Receptor Children project was scrapped, they were able to become candidates for the Symphogear system instead.</br></br></br>  <br> "Pleasant for you" <br>Thanks Ver.</br></br>  <br>In terms of numerical value, the compatibility rate put out by the three is higher than anything Kanade could have obtained, in large thanks to Dr. Ver who has continued to develop LiNKER all this time. They can obtain fighting strength on nearly equal terms to Tsubasa and Chris who are natural candidates.</br>  <br>Carol is too cute to be a villain.</br>  <br>She was just  triggered. </br>  <br>What a nice man</br>  Call me when the music in S3 surpasses this:  https://d.maxfile.ro/eiqjfbdxex.mp3<wbr></wbr> <br><br>Protip: it won't<br><br> No0t like I'm going anywhere in the meantime. Gotta preach the gospel of ZENBU. </br></br></br></br>  reminder  <br>It's to be expected.</br>  <br>Looks accurate</br>  <br>What's with this garbage taste? Tall is obviously best.</br>  <br>Aufwachen EXTERMINATE is going to be the shit, just you wait.</br>  <br> Anime-chan <br> Genjuro <br>I am shocked, shocked to see /a/ having good taste for once.</br></br></br>  Out of my way miracle fucking shits  <br>She sure has the best  voice actor. </br>  <br>I am liking Carol a lot and I've barely seen anything of her.<br>I only she doesn't make Hibiki suffer more than necessary.</br></br>  <br>With this tiny child on the loose no miracle is safe</br>  <br>Hibiki won't have a chance to suffer if she gets  exterminated .</br>  <br>She kind of looks like a shota there.</br>  <br>reminder that even science agrees Chris is best</br>  <br>First against the wall.</br>  Why he is so perfect.  <br>I will be on the front lines cheering if any song in S3 gets the Aufwachen intro treatment.<br><br>But I'm not holding my breath on that one.</br></br></br>  <br>Both Synchrogazer and Vitalization have Aufwachen versions, it's a given that EXTERMINATE will too, being the third OP and all.</br>  <br>Nana willed it.<br> Thank you Nana </br></br>  <br>How does he do it? How does he keep stealing my heart?</br>  <br>That Hibiki is clearly wrong though. She's fairly well-endowed.</br>  <br>Its 10 times more cool with exterminate in the background</br>  <br>I wanna suck on Tsubasa's  81 </br>  <br>Good, I get twintail-loli-tan all to myself.</br>  <br>We can say more than that. It's a given that Exterminate Aufwachen Form will start playing near the end of episode 12 as somebody (Carol) asks Hibiki redundant cheesy questions about how she manages to do something seemingly impossible, to which Hibiki will respond with a hotblooded scream (my bet is something ending in KISEKI DAAAAAAAAAAAA) followed by a screen freeze and the end credits rolling over a black screen to the sound of the rest of the song.<br><br>And it's going to be awesome.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to see him in action more than any other character.<br>I just hope he has a bit of spotlight this season.</br></br>  <br> Genjurou: If the enemy aren't Noise then I'm going out!! </br>  <br>AF short version would start playing in ep2. But I don't think Exterminate will fit to the last battle properly as Synchrogazer and Vitalization.</br>  <br>I am going to be terribly disappointed if Genjuro and Ogawa don't successfully tag team somebody during this season</br>  <br> the main cast is losing the battle <br> enemy about to kill someone <br> Genjurou appears <br> enemies are utterly destroyed by his hand </br></br></br></br>  Still wonder if Iguchi exaggerated about that S3 enemies are too powerful that she thought Hibiki and co. would lose.  <br>I hope not, that would be really exciting.</br>  I bet /a/ would like nothing better than to  grab these ponytails and fill her mouth with their seed,  roughly pushing even after her increasingly violent gagging motions,  finally leaving her to drop to the floor, sticky streams of ejaculate running over her lips as she chokes out   "This is just like my anime..."   <br><br>I don't think she was exaggerating, with how episode 7 is being talked about.</br></br>  <br>I'd become a faggot for that Bikkibutt</br>    <br> by the standards of the show, she hardly seems to stand out. <br> her gear song was a love song to Hibiki </br></br>  <br>I don't like you.<br>I just want to be her friend and watch anime together.</br></br>  <br> Yugoslavian war <br>Which one, we had more than a couple.</br></br>  <br><br> implying she wouldn't love it <br>There's a reason she has those twin tails, you know.</br></br></br>  Is it Friday yet  <br>No one knows. It's still not an official setting currently unless they tell us more details in s3 which I doubt they will do because in s2 they avoided to mention a certain country but only said Maria and Serena lived in eastern Europe.</br>  <br>How old is she? isn't that kind of a clue</br>  I hope her tragic backstory is just a bait and switch and next episode she's going to start massacring people.  <br>Wait, what? What's the difference between the normal version and the Aufwachen version? I thought the Aufwachen version was the only one since I downloaded Nana's albums instead of the singles.</br>  <br>Aufwachen form is the long intro version. Like at the end of the first episode of the first season.</br>  <br>She's so obviously an anti-villain that I fully expect her to side with the geahs by episode 7. They should've saved her flashbacks for later on to make her more mysterious.</br>  <br>Or in the last episode of S2? Gotcha. If there's no other differences then I guess I'm fine with what I have.</br>  <br>That's what I want to believe it's a trick, and they're just making her look obviously befriendable before revealing that she's actually a total monster.</br>  <br>Aufwachen versions of the OPs have an opening to the song.</br>  Preview pictures fucking when?  <br>I think you're thinking too much about this. She's just going to take a bit of work to be befriended, probably almost breaking Hibiki in the process.</br>  <br>When did we get episode 1 previews?</br>  <br> aufwachen versions of the opening have an opening <br> Sorry. </br></br>  All these years, I somehow missed the fact that Kanade had her own character song as well.<br>Then I find out it's literally Bikki's second song with different lyrics.<br><br> There will never be a duet version like Edge Works </br></br></br>  People are all hyped up on a sugar rush for this show now, but I learned my lesson after the first two season pretty much. Better off just watching the first two episodes and then dropping it before the budget inevitably craters and we get quality and lazy storytelling all over the place. This season is also going to have to deal with inevitable Nanoha style character bloat that is just going to make things worse on the storytelling front as well.  <br>A full week before episode 1 aired, so it that's no good as an indicator.</br>  <br>One actually does exist, but it was fanmade mixing the two songs together.<br><br> I wish I had the link for you but I don't </br></br></br>  The air times are all spread out so maybe Wednesday or even Thursday.   spent all day playing Galaxy Cross in music games yesterday <br> G-beat is the song that's stuck in my head <br>How does it work</br></br>  <br>Have a desire to fist.</br>  <br>Maria is 21 years old in G's finale.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>It's okay anon, thank you anyways.</br>  <br>what an old lady</br>  <br>Yeah, the QUALITY is the one thing I'm most worried about. This episode wasn't even so well animated, it just had great direction. While it's still way above the usual Satelite trash, I hope they won't find a way to crash again</br>  <br>Hibiki's S1 songs were both love songs to her and so was rainbow flower. Seigi wo was half a love song to miku and half her determination to get the job done</br>  <br>S3 action scenes are more heavy than previous seasons though.</br>  Is there a webm of Maria waving her fist and doing a little skip? That was cute as fuck.  <br><br>   I wish I had the link for you but I don't <br><br> I do <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm173<wbr>81364</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This episode wasn't even so well animated <br>This is why I'm not worried about QUALITY.<br>From what we've heard, it seems they're focusing on better time management, which should result in more consistent animation quality.<br>G blew loads of time on the first episode, so it's no wonder they suffered later on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's great</br>  <br>Now do you understand why she is worst girl?<br>Now do you understand why Tsubasa (18) is second worst?</br></br>  <br>How can a grandma be so cute?</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>    <br>The concert was really cute, They looked so happy.<br><br>I want to adopt them all, Open up a Cafe and live comfy.</br></br></br>  <br> remember papa getting burned as a heretic and start crying <br> your enemy catches you in tears <br> try to be edgy so she takes you seriously <br> I-I kill miracles <br>Jesus christ she's so adorable, I just want to hold her and tell her everything's going to be okay.<br><br>Hibiki needs to daughter the shit out of her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2.85webm <br> 2 seconds long  <br><br>Anon</br></br></br></br>  <br> not giving maria the space she deserves <br> 2.85mb is far more than she deserves on anyone's harddrive </br></br>  <br>For some reason I find myself liking happy Maria even more than fake cool Maria. Gives me all the more reason to hope that she won't be useless this time around.</br>  <br>I'm gonna use as much as the 3mb limit on Maria being cute as I want and you can't stop me!</br>  All Geahs are best, but Gungnirs are a little bit better.  L-lewd  <br>Reminder Maria's bust is bigger than Chris's.</br>  <br>Fucking Commie, always giving people the wrong idea.</br>  <br>It's actually fairly accurate. The innuendo is there in the original line too, but just not as pronounced as that.</br>  <br>Miku already has one child to raise</br>  <br>It's a jab at her tsundere personality, not an innuendo.</br>  <br> It's a different one every transformation. </br>  <br>She's happy because she's in love</br>  <br>For shame. I love her song, more so than Hibiki's.<br> Tho Rainbow Flower is still GOAT </br></br>  <br>you're reading it sexually cause you want to. a wild ride could be in reference to her personality as well. and it fits far better than "rough around the edges"<br>not to defend some of commie's retarded subs (chrisie) but this one isn't one of them.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki will be the fun dad</br>  <br>I don't want to read it sexually, but everyone else  seems to.<br>And that's because it was phrased a certain way.</br></br>  <br>Kanade is the dad that Hibiki never had</br>  <br>hibiki will be the fun dad that takes carol mountain  fisting  and loses her. only to find her joined with a wolf pack.</br>  <br>It isn't fair that Hibiki-mama makes Miku-mama do all of the disciplining!</br>  <br>of course commie did make it more easily sexualized, but its not a wrong translation and the jab at her tsundere personality could have hinted at a closer relationship too rather than just senior junior, but both instances require you reading into it rather than taking it at face value.<br>point is its not inherently wrong, its just how you interpret it.</br></br>  <br>Why is she so perfect.</br>  <br>But she has larger body to go along with them. It's something completely different.</br>  Hey /a/, I picked up this movie poster recently, and I was wondering what it was for. Like, 2006? What happened with Eva that year? The first rebuild movie came out in 2007. Just thinking it was strange.  <br>http://shokxone-studios.deviantart.<wbr>com/art/Evangelion-The-Movie-v2-399<wbr>82687</wbr></wbr></br>  I also got this larger poster. Are they any other posters connected to specific episodes? This one was for ep. 23 &amp; 24.  <br>bump</br>  Ok so...There was going to be a live action Evangelion movie at one point in time. It never got further than pre-production, but they had concept art for it and were even considering actors. That MAY be what you have there, some kind of marketing for it that jumped the gun.  <br>But whatever the case OP, that's a really cool find. Treasure your rare loot.</br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>Which jojo villain do you think was the least evil?<br><br> Dio Brando <br>Wanted to conquer the UK and then the World. Used any means to do so and made a mother eat her own baby.<br><br> Kars <br>Killed his entire race out of self defense and then purged the ripple clans. Wants to become a perfect being and avenge his commrades. Kills countless humans in his experiments and feeding before becoming perfect<br><br> DIO <br>Wants to get his body under his control and conquer the world. Kill the people loyal to him when necessary and still as ruthless and underhanded as ever. Kills tons of innocent bystanders and victims of his meals without regard of human life if they aren't stand users who benefit him.<br><br> Kira <br>Mentally deranged serial killer than just wants to live peacefully. Kills out of habit without reason to fulfill his fetish. Will eliminate anyone who tries to break his small world, be it women children, or the elderly. Blew up a couple for shits and giggles and tormented his own son with groundhog day<br><br> Diavolo <br>Evil with any rhyme or reason. Kills his entire family, most of his own gang, and wants to murder his own daughter for his paranoia. Does some of the worse torturing in all of jojo to his victims and it ruthless to everyone he sees. Just wants to be king for unknown reasons. <br><br> Pucci <br>Obsessive religious Zealot who sees Dio as God and finds all his actions justified. Kills women, child, coworkers, and innocent bystanders without regard because it is all for "heaven." See Heaven above all other things in the world.<br><br> Valentine <br>Wants to protect his country by subverting all negative things from it away to somewhere else. Manipulates and kills calculatedly to do so. Does a ton of underhanded things and even kills one of his guards for shits and giggles.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Valentine <br> A villain <br>But anon, his thoughts and actions were utterly unclouded, they were all those of justice.<br>You're probably some kind of communist</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pucci, he just wanted everyone to be happy</br>  <br>Americans are too swayed toward Valentine.</br>  Please post non youtube link for original Juves MAD.  Valentine committed the least crimes and had no intention to do so if he got the corpse for America.  <br>then why did he kill a proud american soldier?</br>  <br> most of his own gang <br>He killed 3 gang members, all of which were the middle of betraying him. He killed his family and countless others to hide his identity though.</br></br>  <br>Compared to the other it as to be Valentine but even then he was a fag.</br>  <br>Pucci would have brought true happiness to mankind and only did what he had to in order to get to 「heaven」. Everyone would have had peaceful lives without sorrow if he had succeeded. Pucci did nothing wrong.</br>  I assume you mean the Part 3 MAD?<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/kxdaid_%5BMAD%5DJo<wbr>Jo%27sBizarreAdventure-Part3Stardus<wbr>tCrusaders.mp4</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Euthanasia.

JoJo is shit.  <br>which one?<br><br>I'd have to agree on the 5th one, he seems too bland of a character and a lot of his personality is lost on translation.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yep.</br></br>  <br>then fuck off.</br>  <br>Bee stings can kill you. They didnt have access to modern medicine</br>  I kind of understood why Pucci wanted Heaven, it made sense in his pseudo insanity and fanaticism.   Killed the President of the United States who did nothing wrong and was only trying to save America <br> Goes on to marry some filthy Jap and flush his entire heritage down the drain <br>Johnny was a traitor to his country and the Stars &amp; Stripes.</br></br>  <br>he was fine. Didn't have any allergic reactions.</br>  <br>This "Valentine did nothing wrong" meme is getting old.</br>  I'm sure this will be read as ragebait but what am I missing out on by not reading parts 1-3 if I already saw the anime?<br>Did the anime skip stuff? Looking through the Jonathan vs Dio vs Zepelli and Jonathan vs Dio fights it seems pretty 1-1.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Mxt<wbr>SMyWmSGs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> JoJo Fridays are gone now </br></br>  <br>You're missing a third of Phantom Blood.</br>  <br>it skipped minor stuff in art 1 and 2. Nothing that important but important for characterization.<br>Part 3 was entirely adapted, they even added some stuff in fact.</br></br>  <br>Part 1 skipped stuff like how Jonathan and Danny became friends and Speedwagon trying to learn the hamon.<br>Part 3 actually added new stuff.</br></br>  <br>You're missing out on STYLE</br>  <br>The only thing skipped in Part 3 was Waldo.</br>  <br>Part 1<br>Jonathan eats chocolate<br>Dio steals Jonathan's watch<br>Jonathan meets Danny backstory<br>Danny shown on fire<br>Extended scene of Jack the Ripper killing a lady<br>Jonathan has a short fight with Wang Chen<br>Tarkus and Bruford extra backstory<br>I think that's it<br><br>Part 2 had a longer Donovan fight, and Joseph and Caesar wrecking the post office, but I think that's it.<br><br>Part 3 is pretty much one-to-one but there's a few lines missing every once in a while. Part 3 anime actually adds more stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Valentine killed people specifically because he knew, through D4C, that those people would be problems for him or could be used against him. <br><br>Even the train engineer.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Alright so i'll just read parts 1 and 2, then skip to 4 onwards<br>That is unless the Part 5 translation is super bad and i'd be better off waiting for JoJoProject to finish their scanlation</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No read part 3 too</br>  <br> waiting for JoJoProject to finish their scanlation <br>Good luck with that. See you when Part 5 is animated.</br></br>  <br>Gappy is the least evil, he's just as much of a waifufag as the rest of us.</br>  <br>Yeah that actually sounds pretty good. My friend started out with the manga but quit like 5 chapters into Part 3 because "lol stands are gay", later on he started watching the anime for 3 with the rest of us and began to like it. He went on to Part 4 with the manga after that so you can technically call him a manga reader.</br>  <br> Be superior human thing, die if I go out in the sun <br> Try and figure out a way to overcome this <br> Invent way to make humans more delicious and make myself slightly stronger and more immortal <br> Still can't bare sunlight <br> Continue my research for my race so we could one day be perfect and go out in the sun <br> Entire clan tries to kill me and my gay lover <br> kill them all in self defense <br> take the young that survived the battle and raise them as its the duty of myself to my race <br> Bunch of humans start using some bullshit to have sunlight on them at night <br> Relentlessly attack us while we just try and find the final piece of our research <br> Purge them as they won't stop impeding our research <br> Take a nap for 2000 years <br> Humans have changes, pretty sweet.  <br> Continue search with son and lover, no idea where our rebel son snuck off to during nap <br> Pick human beats up my son, but we be the biggest men literally and figuratively and walk away, seeing if he learns to mature as a warrior and a person. <br> Continue research until my lover gets killed finding the location of the final piece <br> Robot and same guy who beat up my son keep the stone from me  <br> Son and me challenge the humans fairly to combat for the stone because we are civil beings <br> guy uses underhanded tricks to kill my son <br> I respond by using underhanded tricks to kill his mother because I've lost all of my family <br> Become perfect lifeform in honor of all I've lost over my 30K years of living <br> Plan to kill the guy who killed my sons and lover. <br><br>And people say Kars is a villain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So, is the World Jonathan's Stand? I assume it is because of how similar Star Platinum and The World are, and Dio's body being Jonathan's, it has to be his stand.  <br> waifufag <br> dropped his "waifu" for trailer trash </br></br>  <br>here we go again</br>  <br>Enough of this</br>  <br>Nah, stands are like a person's soul or spirit or something like that, not body.</br>    <br><br>s-sorry</br></br>  <br>I want to fuck Kars.</br>  <br>The Passion</br>  <br>Did you not read after that point? I bet you fall for Kotaku clickbait.</br>  <br>of the Dio</br>  <br>No, but it seems you do.</br>  <br>why does he have a body?</br>  <br>Diavolo saved the world from Silver Chariot Requiem. That has to count for something.</br>  <br> N-no you! <br>Nice comeback there, autist.</br></br>  <br> waifufag <br> Kotaku <br> autist <br> incapability to notice when people are fucking around <br><br>I thought the /v/ boogeyman was just a myth.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   chew   why did kira kill the couple? it seem like he gave in to an urge, but did he follow and kill them because they were rude to him on the train, or did he get pissed of and horny by hearing what a slut she was (and by the way she acted)  <br>You're just making shit up now</br>  <br>Kaars was least evil. He mostly only killed in self defense, and the vampires were all bad people. So it was fine for him to turn them and eat them. <br><br>Honestly nothing bad would have happened if he was just given the stone and people weren't afraid, everyone attacked the pillar men out of FEAR. He's the only villain who didn't start shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Mangafox <br>Use Batoto you fucking retard</br></br>   Papenbrook is in the dub <br>I just can't get over it. I hate his voice so much.</br>  What if the Pilar Men are from space and Mikitaka is from a related race to them?  <br>He was fine in sunlight</br>  <br>I think it was due to them bieng rude and hisurge</br>  <br>Also was Kars in the end.</br>  <br>Yeah, but he became ultimate and that's why</br>  <br>Maybe all space Pilar Men are ultimate</br>  <br>At least he dies, Anon.</br>  <br>Wait, I though kars purged his race just for no reason. Why did they attack him?</br>  <br>Too handsome for them.</br>  <br>because they thought he would destroy the ecosystem by transforming humans into vampires.</br>  <br><br>Other Pillar People thought the whole stone mask thing was bad juju. Tried to tell Kars that shit was wack. Kars disagreed politely and made more stone masks. Pillar People tried to kill Kars kompletely. Kars became an orphan.</br></br>  <br>The World isn't Jonathan's stand because stands are an incarnation of one's soul. Dio's head isn't "soulless" therefore he has the ability to canalize a stand, which is The World. If anything, and with the very little info. we have on the matter, Jonathan's stand is the Hermit Purple that Dio is seen using early on. <br><br>My theory is that this Hermit Purple is lost as soon as Dio goes High, because he finally has full control over Jonathan's body, and the little presence of Jonathan's soul that allows HP to exist vanishes with it.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>It was because they were afraid he'd consume all life on earth<br>They were wrong, of course</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thank you </br>  <br><br>They were afraid that all life would be consumed if the whole race was masked, which is honestly a legitimate concern considering that Kars &amp; Friends absorbed living things though skin contact alone. Kars was a visionary, and that would have lead to bad mojo if left unchecked.</br></br>  Post OTPs  <br>When I first read the manga I predicted that Dio's stand reflected any stand ability that was used on him because of his Hermit Purple and The World basically being Star Platinum</br>  <br> Post tumblr trash pairing <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> Tumblr trash <br>That's not  JotaKyoin. </br></br>  <br>Pretty much every Jojo pairing is Tumblr trash</br>  <br>That was my point in </br>  <br>What do you think kars would have done after becoming perfect? He only has to eat once a year so human race isn't in any real danger of being his entree.</br>  Part 7's ending theme should be "America" by Yes<br><br> It would be a Roundabout path. </br></br>  Why didn't they use Sono chi no Sadame when Jotaro killed DIO?<br><br>Actually why didn't they use holy diver?</br></br>  What's gonna happen when Araki bites the dust?  Who's gonna continue the story? Do you think he'll move on to something else before that happens? Will our kids be having Jojo generals to shitpost pucci_after? Will Doc still be alive? Or will there be something to come from the mind of Araki that will surpass Jojo in every way?  <br><br>Holy Diver would be expensive and Sono chi no Sadame had already been done.</br></br>  <br>Ten years ago I worried that Araki would die somehow or get bored of Jojo.<br>Now I have accepted our immortal vampire overlord.</br></br>  <br> Thinking that this is at all out of character for an American politician, even ones that have been previously in the service. <br><br>You're clearly not American enough to have any sense of perspective, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Just listened to the song, that would actually be pretty good.

Hanged Man was just made of light.</br>  <br><br> My stand works out of the mirror world. That means you can't hurt it in any way. I know, OP pls nerf, what are you gonna do about it fag? </br></br>  PART 4 ANIME WHEN???  Balls.  <br>Hanged Man is one of my favourite stands.</br>  <br>Different Anon here.<br><br>Maybe the rock people in JoJolion are just Araki trying to make a universal connection to Kars on Mars.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mine too, I think it doesn't get enough credit. Along with Empress and Chariot it's one of the only bright spots from pre-Egypt part 3.</br></br>  <br>Justice is also cool.</br>  <br><br>Justice has great buildup but no follow-through. It just turns into another "Jotaro wins in one move" fight at the end, which is just wasted potential. Feels like Araki was trying to wrap it up early.</br></br>  Wait a fucking second, I'm reading Part 6, and I think I must have missed something.<br><br>Did Araki really just suddenly reveal that Ungaro was Dio's son on a little info card at the end of the chapter, after he'd already given up the will to live and his part in the story is over? What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Star Platinum too OP pls nerf</br>  <br>It wasn't obvious from his birthmark?</br>  <br>Y'all both need to calm down and stop fighting over nothing,<br>Jo2ke is totally in love with Yasuho and Karera shouldn't be dehumanized just because she's a homeless kid.</br></br>  <br>I thought Emperor and Wheel of Fortune were pretty cool despite being boring design wise.</br>  <br>Ova Justice is better.</br>  <br>I don't remember it ever showing him having a birthmark. I swear I'm not skipping shit, I must not be paying close enough attention or something.<br><br>I know Weather Report has one for some reason, and Pucci now that he absorbed the baby thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Jotaro have all of the worst fights? I'm at the egypt arc now and Jotaro still hasn't done anything memorable.</br>  <br>Don't worry, it picks up in the egypt arc halfway</br>  <br>Remember when Jotaro did that "ORAORAORA" thing? That was memorable.</br>  <br><br>Emperor is sort of wrapped in with Hanged Man, and Wheel of Fortune is kind of a boring fight aside from the neat idea for a stand.</br></br>    <br> Y'all both need to calm down and stop fighting over nothing <br>Uhh, we did. 2 hours and 25 minutes ago</br></br>    <br><br>I won't tell you why Weather has one, just get out of here and finish.</br></br>  <br>I think it's fair to assume that there's different types of zombies <br><br>it's all bullshit though</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus, the quality of that screencap is fucking shit, artifcated to shit</br>  <br>Hol Horse is awesome but Emperor is lame. <br><br>Slowest bullets I've ever seen.</br></br></br>  So I just finished reading Part 4.<br> tfw josuke will never be the protagonist again <br><br>So now I have to read Vento Aureo with those bad scanlations?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well motherfuck. It turns out I'm just retarded.<br><br><br>Yeah, just because someone's undead doesn't mean they're the same as all other undead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 5 translation ruins the characterization that made Part 5. The fights are still good though. I still had fun reading it.</br>  <br> josuke will never be the protagonist again </br>  <br>Josuke Higashikata will be the protagonist again, in part 8</br>  <br>macaroni macaroni who is the stand useroni</br>  <br>Yeah, I've heard. That's what made me feel kinda bummed out.<br>Giorno looks like a cool character so it's a shame.<br>I've also heard the main villain's stand is pretty bullshit to understand, so I can only imagine the translation will make it even worse.<br><br><br>He was best jojo.<br><br><br>Ah, yeah, but that's in the whole reset universe, isn't it?<br>He also doesn't look anything like Josuke. And he seems to be really fucking weird, but I haven't read it yet, so I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this is amazing</br>  <br>I still have no idea why people latched onto him so hard. Sacrificing himself was sad, but he has next to no development until right before his death, and he doesn't show much more personality than even Avdol.</br>  <br>I blame CLAMP. <br><br> Did you lay this egg kakyoin </br></br></br>  <br>hopefully never</br>  <br>I have a soft spot for The Emperor. So simple, but so effective.<br><br>Shame Hol Horse is stupid enough to shoot himself in the face when he has absolute control over the bullets. Twice.</br></br></br>  So why didn't Pucci think Star Platinum would be useful?  <br>I always saw it like this: The World is DIO's, but because of the psychic link with Jotaro through Jonathan's body + "You are the chosen one" shenanigans, Jotaro got a re-skinned Za Warudo as his stand<br><br>Basically, fate itself thought DIO was a faggot and made Star Platinum as a way to flip him the bird.</br></br></br>  <br>can you host this on YT? goanimate.com is fucking awful</br>  <br>I just really liked his stand, I'm not upset about him dying or anything though  anymore </br>  <br> but that's in the whole reset universe <br>The what? <br><br> He also doesn't look anything like Josuke. <br>Again, what? Look at pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Having a free gun with infinite ammo wherever you go and being able to change the trajectory of your bullets is pretty useful for a guy like Hol Horse, though. Couldn't he change the speed of his bullets too?</br>  EoH demo when mannn  <br>Have you seen how OP whitesnake already is? also he only really needed jotaro's memories. finally, he might not even have been able to use SP, only certain people are worthy or certain stands.</br>  <br>"Very soon" my ass.</br>  <br>Maybe he knew it would be loyal to Jotaro, seeing that it refused Jolyne.<br><br>Or that it isn't crucial to the plan.</br></br></br>  <br>Part 7 Alt Diego has The World.</br>  <br>Doesn't SBR kinda rewind the whole tale with having a different Jonathan and such? That's what I mean by reset.<br><br>And well, everyone looks similar with Araki's new style, but he looks more like Okuyasu in that pic.</br></br></br>  <br>People ship him with Jotaro and also probably because of the whole friendless nerd thing.</br>  <br>Yes? I'm literally saying The World is DIO's, not Johnatan's.</br>  Whitesnake is a more interesting character than gay priest.  <br>I wasn't arguing against you.</br>  <br> Doesn't SBR kinda rewind the whole tale with having a different Jonathan and such? <br>Literally what? Just read the manga dude, you must be misunderstanding what people are talking about or something. Also no, that's fucking Josuke, all he did was cut the sides to be "hip" since it's 2011 in part 8</br></br>  <br>Welp.<br>Guess I'll just go read the italian shenanigans then.</br></br>  <br><br>do that</br></br>  <br>Oh, sorry. <br>Anyway, to be more precise with my original point, I think DIO would've got The World regardless of him having Johnatan's body or not, however, him having that body might been the reason for Jotaro having Star Platinum. He unknowingly gave Jotaro an advantage by setting that psychic link with the Joestar bloodline.</br></br>  <br>Dio is not Diego</br>  <br> the Harvest chapters <br>It really is just like one of my japanese animes.</br></br>   tfw listening to Landslide while reading the Legend of Johnny Joestar <br>kill me</br>  <br>I was so glad when Araki killed off that fat fuck.</br>  <br>I felt the first half of part 4 was the weakest in the series.<br>That being said, the second Kira was introduced it blasted past everything else to become my favorite.</br></br>  <br> fucking Johhny is a legend and not Gyro <br><br>Fuck Araki.</br></br></br>  <br>Was there a single good fight in Part 4 before Kira shows up other than Bad Company?</br>  <br>Araki is evil?</br>  <br>He should have taken that napkin.</br>  anyone have the ALIVE part 7 MAD?  <br>I thought Alive was Part 6?</br>  <br>Yukako, Tonio, Rohan, and Harvest. I personally like the Ratt one.</br>  <br>There was a Part 7 Alive one by a different guy.</br>  <br>Well, really, Gyro didn't do shit in the minds of pretty much everyone except Johnny.<br><br> Shitty kid ran away from home trying to save some worthless trash that was going to be executed and died before actually saving him. </br></br></br>  <br>Tonio, Rohan and Fatty hardly count as fights but yeah, they were enjoyable.<br> I kinda liked Aqua Necklace and Ratt too </br></br>  You now remember Terence.  <br> hardly count as fights <br>That's why they're good.<br>Jojo is at its best when it subverts your expectations.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>found it<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm159<wbr>20014</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>For those who don't have an account.<br><br>This should work: http://www.mmcafe.com/nico.html#htt<wbr>p://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm159200<wbr>14</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> listening to Landslide when Johnny gets on the boat with Valkyrie and Gyro's coffin </br>  <br>I'm disappointed Elder D'Arby was bullied by such a pathetic piece of shit.</br>  <br>Certainly. The dice game with Rohan was fantastic and that wasn't a fight either.<br>Part 4 has a lot of that slice of life stuff that make it really enjoyable. That, and some of the fights were really good.</br></br>  So what's with the Soul'd Out jojo AMVS? Why is it always that band? Did it come from that one stand who's name was a Soul'd Out song or was that Araki acknowledging the AMVs?  Josuke will travel to the SBRverse shortly.  <br>Soul'd Out are Jojo fans. They made Voodoo Kingdom for the Phantom Blood movie.</br>  <br>Worst D'Arby</br>  <br>Josuke hair looks like a grilled hamburger.</br>  <br>Your mom is a grilled hamburger</br>  <br>Okay</br>  <br><br>I never understood what was supposed to be going on on top of his hair.<br>Like, what would that hairstyle translate to IRL?<br>It's definitely not a pompadour.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just how Araki draws it.</br>  <br> It's definitely not a pompadour. <br>Yeah it is...</br></br>    <br>Alright, that makes sense. Cool of Araki to make a stand based off one of there songs</br>  <br>He didn't kill him, he sent him somewhere else.<br><br><br><br>Kars would have been a nice villain if he didn't make a 90 degree turn and start doing bad things that look out of character for him like that leg guitar.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The leg guitar is my favourite Kars related thing.</br>    <br><br>But pomps don't have those cross hashes on top, the hair is just straight.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>It's just how Araki draws it, looks more interesting than have just a flat black top.</br>  I can't wait for an animated part 4. And 5. And 6. And 7. And 8.  <br>Animated Part 9 fucking WHEN</br>  <br>I want to see Highway Star, Boy II Man and Bites the Dust animated so damned bad.</br>  <br>I want to see 12 pages of MUDAMUDAMUDA, Emporio vs Pucci, and D4C animated so damned bad.</br>  <br>I'm extremely interested to see what they will do with the artstyle of 7, as we have seen they can pull off part 5 very well. I'm also interested and see how they would handle the sameface, would they go off and create there own faces/ask araki for help or would they go sameface?</br>  <br>he crimped his hair with a waffle iron</br>  SBR&gt;DiU&gt;JJL&gt;VA&gt;=SO&gt;&gt;&gt;SC&gt;BT&gt;PB  <br>I think the real question isn't "who was the least evil," but, "who was the least selfish?"<br>Kira's the least evil</br></br>  Josuk- I mean Josefumi is here now.  <br> No just typing 7&gt;4 etc <br> 6 higher than 3 and 2 <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with you?</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Do you think you are funny?</br></br>  <br>My mem- I mean my forced meme is here now.</br>  <br> 2 and 3 being above 6 <br>are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Where was it revealed that Jobin has green hair and dark skin?</br>      <br> rating 6 anything but last <br><br>Fuck off faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Josuke might have wavy hair</br>  <br> butthurt that his weebee Joestars died boo hoo </br>    <br>i didnt know someone could have this much shit taste</br>  <br> as we have seen they can pull off part 5 very well <br>We have?</br></br>  <br> wahhh people diieeed </br>  <br>Yeah. Noticed how he outsped Silver Chariot with that bullet?</br>  <br> 3 <br> above anything </br></br>  <br>It's not official but it was done by one of the animators and it is the perfect style for part 5 imo</br>  <br> The World isn't Jonathan's stand <br> it's Jonathan's soul </br></br>  <br><br><br>will we make one for Part 4 when it comes out?</br></br></br>  <br>But what about Wally/Waldo</br>  <br>He didn't, he switched directions in the last second, catching Polnareff off guard.</br>    can someone post the that's bullshit but i believe it colored?  <br>The only thing good about that post is the dubs.<br><br><br><br> A gay twink outplays the ultimate stand <br> 5 second timestop reduced to 1 sec because too overpowered <br> sameface and shitty art reached its peak, along with the weird scratched noses <br> Dio drawn as a gay twink <br><br>Yeah, nah.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Oh shit, that actually looks nice.</br></br>  What are the chances David just skips part 4 and does part 5 knowing that people will watch that one more?    <br>That's still very fucking fast considering that Polnareff saw exactly what was happening and he was halfway through his thrusting action to change directions.</br>  Can anyone please explain why everyone is so obsessed with Pucci?  <br>0% because David isn't fucking retarded and said they want to adapt all parts, not just the popular ones</br>  <br>You're underestimating people's love of their familiar basic-ass slice-of-life high school animu. I feel like there'd be rioting in the streets.</br>  <br>That's a poorly made png</br>  <br>I still don't understand how the fuck his hair works</br>  <br>It's just a really long mullet with three big curls in the front and the back is braided like Jolyne's.</br>  <br><br>So why are people so afraid part 4 won't be adapted? No teaser? Is that it?<br><br>If it's sales, wasn't SC really fucking popular?</br></br></br></br>  Who would win?<br><br>Young Joseph or Dio Brando?</br></br>  <br>Considering Josuke is the closest thing people will get to a second Joseph, and animefags love Joseph, do you really think they'd skip him?</br>  <br>giorno version?</br>  <br>Whoever Araki wants to win.</br>  <br>Literally because of no teaser. SC isn't selling as good as part 1 and 2 but it's selling well enough to justify adapting part 4</br>  <br>SC is supposedly only doing ok as far as sales go, and not as great as expected.</br>  <br>How else will we know that gay priest is here?<br>We absolutely must known when gay priest has arrived and whether or not he is present in the thread.<br>If we dont keep tabs on gay priest, he could be doing all kinds of gay priest things behind our back.</br></br></br>  <br>There is a lot that can be debated and discussed about him. From his racial ambiguity and relationship with Dio to his plan to achieve heaven and what it actually meant.</br>  <br>Joseph before or after training? If before, probably Joseph. If after, definitely Joseph</br>   Versace's backstory is ripped straight out of Holes by Louis Sachar <br><br>What the fudge?</br></br>  <br>Who's that?</br>    <br>Joseph barely beat Cars by bullshitting his way out of the fight. He can't do shit against The World. Granted Jotaro shouldn't have been able to either, but...</br>  <br>I could if I only knew the chapter it was on.</br>  <br>You are a boring person.<br><br>Boohoo</br></br></br>  <br>Pfff what the fuck is wrong with King Crimson's face?</br>  <br><br>As long as it sells well enough to justify another part, it should do fine. People were probably put off by the length.<br><br>But if they do 4, they'll surely do part 5 knowing how popular it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br> he could be doing all kinds of gay priest things behind our back <br>But he's into vampires, not little boys.</br></br>  <br>Prosciutto<br><br>http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Prosciut<wbr>to</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>what giorno version?</br>  <br> If we dont keep tabs on gay priest, he could be doing all kinds of gay priest things behind our back. <br>im fucking dying</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Me too</br>  <br> you ruined it </br>  <br>thanks fam</br>  Goodbye and good riddance to this Gaiden, it really soured toward the end. Hey, it's just like the original series!<br><br>It seems like the latest arc in Black Clover is ending. I'm going to give the series a few more chapters to get entertaining otherwise I'll be knocking it off the list until it does.<br><br>There's still no new series in the English magazine. I don't know if there WILL be at this point. If there is, I hope it's Straighten Up!, because apparently it's doing well right now and should probably last a decent while  Maybe it'll take another month or so for a new series to enter Viz Jump. I remember when Black Clover entered they did like two weeks of multiple chapter releases to catch up.<br><br>If you read Blue Exorcist/Ao no Exorcist, here is a DDL of chapter 69: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/NtuB5<wbr>1C5/file.html<br>I don't know why you read this, but I won't judge you.

No every would have imagine him getting a manga let alone it getting popular. Many anons remember following back when all he had was his Pixiv account and his comic showing up once in a blue moon.<br><br>We are less than 24 away from episode 1 of the series. No matter how much we bitch about him he is still a great man. Now lets hope he doesn't stress out too much about the anime and fucking gives us a new chapter that lazy piece of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget the get well gift some anons sent him, when he was sick due to stress.</br>  <br>I really wish i knew nip so i could tweet him things he could actually understand, hopefully google can accuratly translate my words of thanks and congratulations, and he likes my pictures of my Miia daki</br>  <br>I would suggest, if you want to show Cerea's vulva' a perspective from behind and above. Her tail lifted to the side out of the way, probably hiding her butthole still, with her looking up and back with one arm cupping her full breasts together, the other resting back along her equine back.<br><br>A bit of an awkward pose, but I think its the only way to show her like the other girls unless you show her on her back fully stretched out.</br></br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br>As should be.</br>  <br>Does anyone have the Srpska edit of that?</br>  <br> drinking water at an ice cream shop </br>  <br>Like going to an ice cream parlor and ordering hamburgers<br>Where do you think you are<br>Monster girls&gt;Humans<br/></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you also masturbate to 3D you fucking faggot</br>  <br>Suu is so Salty there.</br>  <br>Trips confirm it once again</br>  <br><br>What is the fasination with ice cream shop?</br></br>  <br>Someone's never been to an ice cream shop.</br>  <br>Apparently ice cream shops sell burgers?<br>Or something.

At least make it seem like he moved up from Yosenju's rather then move down 6 tiers onto a deck he would have thrown out in episode 2 if he had the chance.</br>  <br>I actively tried to find a instrumental version cause the original with vocals is so fucking garbage.</br>  <br>That episode was fucking hilarious</br>  <br> the fun has just begun <br> video ends </br></br>  <br>Fusion Dimension isn't GX dimension.<br>GX is past of 5Ds, so it's Synchro Dimension, same as DM.</br></br>  <br>citation needed</br>  <br>No you faggot, Synchro Dimension is 5D's, Fusion Dimension is GX, Xyz Dimension is Heartland, and you could say DM Dimension is Standard</br>  <br>The 5Ds movie shows Yugi, Jaden and Yusei have same timeline. Paradox traveled into time, not into different dimension.</br>  <br>5DS isn't future of GX and DM?</br>  <br>or movies are not cannon.</br>  <br>This still does not confirm that Synchro is the endgame of DM still cause there is no mention of the Crimson plot device or Jesus. In fact we had 0 mention of any of the card game Messiahs.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=10&amp;<wbr>v=jwFA4vmweYk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Suh-COCK-e </br></br>  <br>Yes. But Arc-V splits the series into different, alternate dimensions. The Fusion Dimension is based off of Gx and Synchro is based off of 5D's and so on</br>  <br>"Zuzu".<br> it's RURI</br></br>  <br>The events in the movie were mentioned in the Ark Cradle arc<br><br><br>Yes it is you dumb fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch Ruri be called Suri or worse, Siri.</br>  <br> Implying 5ds is actually directly related to Synchro Dimension <br> Not seeing this is a homage and not hardline continuing continuity. </br></br>  <br>Are they serious?<br><br>Do they actually think kids enjoy this? Why do they insist on turning their series anywhere but in Japan into a complete joke?<br><br>Does 4K actually watch the Japanese version before they dub or do they just go "lel your not dueling his grandma xDD" <br><br>What happens when shit gets grimdark and everyone is dying left and right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking serious? In no way did I imply that. I literally said <br> Synchro is based off of 5D's </br></br>  <br>This isn't too different from the first episode in japanese. It was a long lead in to more serious stuff. Based on Nakajima and Reiji's voices, I have faith.</br>  <br>what the hell are you smoking anon</br>  <br>Just goes to show you are retarded.<br><br>Nice samefagging</br></br></br>  <br>Check again athiest</br>    <br> I-I was just pretending notice me senpaii ~_~ <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Hm, im not ok, that ArcV splits sheries into different dimensions. So Yugi traveled into an another dimension in GX? (from Standard to past of Academia?)</br>  <br>you are retarded</br>    I just realized Yugo was slamming Yuzu for being in a gross outfit after like 2 days when he's been in a skintight jumpsuit for like a month.<br><br>Yugo...</br></br>  and there is no mention of Yugi in Standard  <br> Hm, im not ok, that ArcV splits sheries into different dimensions </br>  <br> Let's swing into action <br> Yusho doesn't even have a Pendulum </br></br>  <br>Probably, but I don't get the answer. Anyway, ill continue to think that DM/GX/5Ds have same timeline and dimension until they say it's wrong in Arc V.</br>  <br> muh headcanon </br>  <br>It's already wrong. In the Synchro Dimension, nobody knew what the fuck Fusion Summoning was which is why Roger tried to arrest Serena<br><br>Fuck off with your idiocy</br></br></br>    <br>Maybe because DM/GX was a long time ago? So everybody forgot what fusion summoned is. <br>If 5Ds movie is canon, Yugi Jaden and Yusei are from same timeline and dimension. If it's wrong, the movie isn't canon.</br></br>  <br>But in 5D's Jack used Fusion Summoning<br><br>The movie is canon. Get the fuck out. Please.</br></br></br>  <br> So everybody forgot what fusion summoned is. </br>    <br>You are right that DM/GX/5Ds have the same timeline and dimension.<br><br>Here is where you are absolutely wrong: ARC-V is in a different dimension than DM/GX/5Ds/Zexal. Its stupid to assume that Fusion Dimension is any continuation of GX, Synchro to 5Ds, or Xyz to Zexal.<br><br><br> 5Ds movie IS canon <br> DM, GX and 5Ds ARE in the same dimension since Satellite was Domino City destroyed by Zero Reverse, and Judai met Yugi in episode 1. <br> ARC-V is completely separate to the past series. <br> Meaning that what took place in GX does not apply to Fusion Dimension, 5Ds to Synchro or Zexal Xyz. <br><br>Now this is my "headcanon": DM, GX, 5Ds and Zexal are Dimension 1. Standard Dimension is Dimension 2, Fusion Dimension is Dimension 3, Synchro Dimension is Dimension 4, Xyz Dimension is Dimension 5.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   :^)   <br><br>Ok, I didn't see 5Ds.<br>So why that dude said <br> In the Synchro Dimension, nobody knew what the fuck Fusion Summoning was which is why Roger tried to arrest Serena </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Synchro isn't 5D's.</br>  <br>Because the Synchro Dimension isn't 5D's. It's BASED off of 5D's. <br><br>You can't be this dense, you just can't.</br></br></br>  <br> Ok, I didn't see 5Ds. </br>  <br>Well, thanks for giving me a real answer with arguments.</br>  <br>I dunno, the subpar VA work for most of the characters and the fact that their substitute for the original OST isn't even used competently just makes everything feel pretty pale in comparison. I never planned on watching past episode 2 of the dub, though.</br>  <br>Everyone else gave you real answers, faggot.</br>  <br>I don't get the "based of" before this answer. Probably cause i didn't see 5Ds. Arc V is the first yugioh serie I watch. I saw GX and DM 4kis translate version when I was young, but not 5Ds and ZeXal.</br>  <br> thinking you deserve arguments handed to you on a platter <br>Back in my day, we had to work for years in the mines to get our arguments. It was horrible, there were folks with miner's lung and blindness everywhere, and when the full moon came out, they turned into werewolves!</br></br>  <br>man just watch 5ds and stop shitting up this threat so hard. hell it will even be fun for you with the bonus for us that you are gone for a bit till you can actually talk about shit.</br>  <br>I can't tell which OP I liked the least between Dualism and Wondah Wings</br>  <br>I'm willing to give them until 7. If they fuck up Yuto I'm out though.</br>  BATTLE DA  <br>Is that a Shun for ants?</br>  BRAVE CLAW<br><br>REVOLUTION</br></br>  <br>BRAVE CLAW REVOLUTION!</br>  <br>Yuya's voice is way too masculine for him<br>Yuzu and her father are simply AHAHAHAH<br>Yoko is the sex though.<br> I really wanna see Elvis Gon vs Nega Gon though </br></br></br></br>  <br> too masculine <br><br>It doesn't sound masculine at all. It sounds like a pretentious middle schooler who thinks he is the hardest shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I have a feeling it's not just that</br>  <br> Strong Ishijima is Arnold <br>What in the world</br></br>  Okay so I'm watching Bonds Beyond Time <br><br>In the beginning, Jaden is in Venice fighting Paradox and during that fight the scene switches to Domino City being destroyed by Momentum. Does that mean while Jaden is in Venice, Domino City was destroyed?</br></br>  <br>I just realized, how are they going to do the "Yugo = Yuugo" joke? Because that mixup is basically responsible for the antagonism between Yuugo and Yuuto kek</br>  <br>The real reason that Yugo and Yugo fought each other was that they thought the other was Yuri who kidnapped Ruri/Rin.<br>Also makes me wonder if Yuto treated Ruri like a princess whenever they met up with each other?</br></br>  <br>Is that a reverse trap Yuya?</br>  <br>When facing someone like Yuto, Yugo will just get called "the Fusion lackey" or "Duel Academy pawn" or something. Meanwhile, when Yuzu gets his name wrong, she'll say something like "Hugo". It'll be kind of split into two like that - enemies will use the association with Fusion to piss him off, while friends will just fuck up his name, which pisses him off too.</br>  <br> Yuto treated Ruri like a princess whenever they met up with each other? <br>Yuuto probably treated everyone he personally knew like a princess. Super softy on the inside.</br></br>  <br>Based on how he acted towards Yuzu, probably.<br> yfw you will never have a gloomy knight-kun of your own </br></br>  <br>M-m'lady...<br>*drops SILENTO BOOTS*</br></br>  <br> no Yuuto knight to make me feel safe <br> no obsessive Yuuya to make me feel loved <br> no spontaneous Yuugo to make me laugh <br> no rape face Yuuri to scare me to death <br>Living, why do I do it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's ok, anon. We'll always have our shitty otome games.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  Fusions is evil don't trus him  <br>DX, GX, 5Ds, and Zexal probably had the same timeline until Proto-Yuya and Proto-Yuzu accidentally the Universe</br>    When Yuya gets a tuner monster what are the odds it's gonna be a waifu card?  <br>Basically this.</br>  <br>Its going to be a little less yuzu based then the future pendulum synchro would be.</br>  <br>Aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh</br>  <br>good post</br>  <br>I love how when Yuzu breaks the news to him he's just like "so I killed the wrong guy?" and forgets about it two seconds later.</br>  <br>Yuri really is the best</br>  <br>It's not like he had any emotional attachment to Yuto. Besides, his mind was stuck on Rin.</br>  <br>He's commons, murdering people is like breakfast for that filth.</br>   Ruri will never tip her fedora at you <br>Why live</br>  <br> you will never teach Ruri about the simple things in life </br>  Why doesn't Yuya use defusion to kick Yuto out?  <br>Because he Overlaid with Yuto, not Fused. It's going to require Xyz Encore, but that's a TCG-only card.</br>  <br> Shun finally saves Ruri <br> Ignores Shun other than a hello and hugs Yuya <br> I knew you'd come save me! <br> Yuya stutters that he isn't Yuto. <br> Shun confirms it. <br> "Stop messing with me, You two!" <br> Yuya looks at the ground. <br> "Where's Yuto?" <br> "Why isn't Yuto here?!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never considered the possibility that Ruri had feelings for Yuuto.<br> My heart :( </br></br>  <br> never considered the possibility <br>Yuto is crushable as hell. I've gotten 7 people to watch arc-v, and all of them declared him thier husbando.</br></br>  <br>1/3 of the best boys<br>Shame we don't get to see much of him</br></br>  <br>Jean-Michael pls leave</br>  <br> crushable <br>Clear Wing did a pretty good job of crushing him.</br></br>  <br>That's because she doesn't enjoy the simple things. She likes dueling.</br>   Yugioh will be 20 this year <br>I don't want to grow up help</br>  <br> the events of NGE take place this year </br>    <br>Where are they riding to?</br>  <br>What's the matter, faggot? Did I ride over a toe? Awwww. Well, don't worry, any Rin's that find (like Ruri for example) will be well looked after.<br><br>And by 'looked after', I of course mean 'nailed'.<br><br>Faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is it true that the chant for Ra was just gibberish in japanese? I only watched the german dub, which had its own version.  <br>from the wiki<br>Note that in the English version of Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, when Yami Marik attempted to gain control of "Ra" in his Duel with Mai, the viewer can hear him speaking understandable words. However, in the Japanese version of Yu-Gi-Oh! anime and manga, what he recited was the Hieratic Text itself (in the anime, Marik recites some unknown words; in the manga, his speech bubbles are filled with Hieratic Text).<br><br>Since we dont know what egyptian sounds like its a compromise</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to the Japanese version of the anime and manga, the Hieratic Text printed on the card records the following three groups of Ra's abilities (quoted from Kaiba's own translation of the text in Duel 248 of the Japanese manga).<br><br>When (roughly) translated to English, it reads: <br>(1st ability) "Ra shall acquire the power of three tributes. However, only those who offer the ancient incantation to heaven shall God follow."<br>(2nd ability) "God shall revive from earth. By offering the Ritual of Revival and his own life, one shall be united with God, and all enemies on the battlefield shall be incinerated."<br>(3rd ability) "In an instant, God shall become a Phoenix, and all evil spirits chosen by it shall repose on earth."<br><br>The Summon chants that Marik and later Atem would use were based on Hieratic speech. So yes, it was gibberish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i hope there is a doujin of him &amp; fem yuya enjoying a private duel ;^)</br>  <br>Yugo, please. We all know you're not lasting past this arc, you should really just start coming to terms with it.</br>  <br><br>Too bad. The german version was chuuni as fuck. I loved it. Kinda a predecessor of the current ones.</br></br>  <br> mfw if Yugo does survive the arc, it'll be all in his mind and he'll go through the stages of grief <br> denial - lasting the arc seemingly intact and seeing nothing wrong <br> anger - dropping motherfuckers left and right, regardless of their alignment <br> bargaining - striking deals with anybody who can keep him afloat long enough to find muh Rin <br> depression - realising he may never find muh Rin, and taking on Yuto's sad eyes and getting the shakes like he did <br> acceptance - falling in battle to Yuri (or similar) and getting nommed by the tomato </br></br></br></br></br></br>  New episodes when  <br> He is a prisoner of Academia. Considered a heretic by everyone else because he doesn't use fusion, uses filthy rituals and he made decks built entirely on sealing away fusion summons. The last straw was him saying "Fusion summoning causes you to lose card advantage most of the time, it's not worth the investment. I think Xyz could be better". As punishment his name has been stricken from all records and by law nobody can ever acknowledge his existence. None of his "friends" even miss him, and forgot about him even before he had been stricken from public record. <br> He sits all day in his cell, longing for the death that will not come as Academia's scientists use him as a guniea pig and torture toy. </br></br>  <br>Motherfuckers better watch out when he finds a way to counterattack their balls.</br>  <br>fuck off</br>    <br> and getting nommed by the tomato <br>I'm jealous</br></br>  <br> tfw no date episode with smooth jazz music in the background </br>  <br>That's cruel anon, even for a character that doesn't exist</br>  <br>Thank heavens, I think I'd have a heart attack</br>  Which of Yuya's dragons has the best attack name?  <br>Its each sunday and subs during the first ~2-4 days of the week. <br>Unless your post was ironic in which case don't mind me.</br></br>  <br> because he doesn't use fusion <br>Most GX characters didn't actually use fusion.

In fact all the Ruris except Ruri's have had flashbacks in their own dimensions before Xyz was attacked. <br><br>Ruri hasn't been shown yet because she's either straight up dead and Yuto/Shun didn't want to admit it, or she's evil and turned on her own and they assumed she got kidnapped.</br></br></br>  <br>Voice acting so bad, I swore it was a parody.</br>  Serena a cute. CUTE  <br>He tied Yuuya's friends to an unstable tower, stole his ace cards, and told him that the rest of his deck was trash</br>  <br>We all makes mistakes Anon. Now he's all about wanting to enjoy things and having fun, albeit he's a little brash and dumb. <br><br>Did you even see the hippo conversation Anon, did you?! Sawatari is adorable. <br><br>Yes she is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reiji told him to, he shares some of the blame. And Serena and Shun have killed multiple innocent people and not even apologized</br>  Shun~  What's he watching?  <br>Serena gave no shits, she was just like "People die honorable when dueling, get over it."</br>  You can only have  two   <br>An old VHS tape of that time him, ruri, and yuto went to the amusement park to ride the rollercoaster.</br>  <br>Yuzu and Yuuya</br>  <br>I want two Serenas.</br>  <br>Reminder that Serena carded an innocent Standard person (Hokuto), and Shun has carded FIVE innocents Standard people... and yet it is not addressed at all.<br><br>At least when villains get redeemed, their evil is actually acknowledged before it is forgiven but with Serena and Shun (especially Shun), its like it never happened. At least with Serena, the only witnesses were Reiji and Nakajima (neither care) but with Shun, both Yuya and Yuzu are aware that Shun went after LDS, and Reiji doesn't care that Shun carded five people.<br><br>I am not saying they shouldn't be redeemed since this is YGO and they should, but I feel like they missed an opportunity to bring it up. It makes me wonder if when Yuri gets redeemed, they will ignore that he captured Ruri and Rin (and almost Yuzu), or how Sora backstabbed Yuya, albeit Sora was never truly on Yuya's side since he was from Academia. He still made Yuya suffer since Yuya was his friend, and he favoured Academia over Yuya.<br><br><br>  And Serena and Shun have killed multiple innocent people and not even apologized <br><br>Serena is a Ruri while Shun is the most shilled character in ARC-V. Naturally they would be redeemed without anyone mentioning their past actions.<br><br><br>IIRC, Reiji only told Sawatari to get the Pendulum cards so that Reiji could research them. He didn't tell Sawatari to tie up Yuzu and the kids to the tower which, as Sora vs Shun R1 proved, could have killed Yuzu and the kids (or at least, the three kids would have). At the very least, they would have been hospitalised like Sora was after getting BTFO by Revolution Falcon and the falling tower.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br> IIRC, Reiji only told Sawatari to get the Pendulum cards so that Reiji could research them.

Also Shun/Sora could have just been because of their duel disks giving things actual solid mass. Remember Reiji comments on Serena's monsters having solid mass and everyone is commenting on the shockwaves they produce just by dueling normally. <br><br>It probably just makes their duels leagues worse when Action Dueling is also involved.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun carded them because he thought LDS was still responsible for the invasion and wanted to draw out the LDS heads to a duel. Not because he just wanted to end lives or anything.<br>I'm not saying that excuses him, but there were a pragmatic, reasonable intentions behind his actions.</br></br>  <br> Sawatari could have killed the kids <br><br>Jesus I wish he had so we would have been rid of fucking shivers at least. Losing the other two is worth it to lose that little shit.</br></br></br>  <br>She thought all duelists were trained as soldiers.<br><br><br><br><br>That is a LOT of repeating digits holy shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell me about it<br> ENJOY's prisoners still managed to bring it across dimensions </br></br>  Rate my deck....<br><br>A Yuya Deck Special (No More Entermates!)</br></br>  <br> She thought all duelists were trained as soldiers. <br><br>Well Yuzu didn't really call her out on that, only that they hurt people who weren't duelists. Yuzu didn't seem to give any fucks either that duelists killed each other.</br></br></br>  <br>Needs more peasant dragons and not using skullcrobat is retarded.</br>  <br>But Yuya, you don't have any Synchro monsters yet...also please stop the Yuzu.wav.</br>  Blue Eyes is still my favorite ace monster after all this time. How can Kaiba be so unlikeable and likeable at the same time?  <br>That's pretty good, but how about mine?</br>  <br>needs three scullcrobat and some swaying gaze.</br>  <br>Its a parallel universe. One, where all the events from dm&gt;5d's takes place.<br><br>Then you got another universe where each of the summoning methods were their own dimensions. <br><br>Simple as that. Things happened differently than in the single continuous universe, and that is why there is less magical bullshit. (Crimson dragon etc) because they were separated and not part of the same clusterfuck dimension that is the yugioh original timeline.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hello Seto</br>  Mario Kart-style speed spell action magic when?  <br>Yo</br>  <br>Hmm, he's kinda bad if i summon more than 1 of him with Pendulum Summon.. unless that's the effect of ygopro. (Since only 1 of them will have its effects trigger)<br><br>Oh Skullcrobat definitely works in place of Summoner's Art, not sure which last card to remove for it though.<br><br>  127691351 <br>I dont really face off against other Pendulum decks... so i'll keep it around the side deck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> add fusion conscription <br> add trade-in <br> add the melody of awakening dragon <br> add staples and other cards to protect shining from destruction <br> add synchro <br> remove toons <br> remove ritual </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you expect,anon? "Swing, Pendulum of my soul, draw an arc of light across the aether!" sounds stupid in english and chunni in japanese.</br>  <br>Well... I just went ahead and made a XYZ Blue-Eyes Deck instead.<br><br>So no Shining Dragon, or Paladin of White Dragon, or Kaibaman, or Toon Dragon.<br><br>Although Malefic Blue-Eyes White Dragon sounds like a good addition.</br></br></br></br></br>  There are, story-wise, no reasons for Yuya to actually lose. He's been dueling like shit for the past few duels he had, but that means nothing. A loss here would bring pretty much nothing to the story.  <br>malefics require field spells though that might be hard to deal with because there isn't a lot of field spells for dragons. Unless you want to run that fusion world card to get quick ultimate dragons to go.</br>  <br>I'll bet you one thousand dollars Jack Atlas wins</br>  <br>make sure to run stuff like dragon mirror to make use of dragons in your graveyard. I'd say it goes well with 5 headed dragon and it goes well with making a ultimate dragon from grave.</br>  <br>A draw would be the most sensible outcome. Why should Yuya lose to a guy who won't have any kind of impact?</br>  <br> No story reasons <br>Jack losing means he isn't the King anymore. The entire point of the Friendship Cup is to get the opportunity to beat Jack. The Friendship Cup would lose purpose.</br></br>   tfw quality jakku   <br> story-wise <br> no reason for Yuya to lose <br> Literally what would be the point of the Friendship Cup if Jack gets beaten in an exhibition match instead of the Finals. </br></br></br>  <br>It's only an exhibition.</br>  <br>We havent seen Jack do anything yet, he needs a win to establish himself as a legit threat in the eyes of people who havent seen 5Ds</br>  <br><br>I only said there are no reason for Yuya to lose.</br></br>  It's Tanabata in Japan and thus Jesus Fudo  and Mokuba's  birthday.  <br>Here's my BEWD XYZs.</br>  <br>YGO has no shortage of best boys does it? <br>Also remember when Mokuba was a princess?</br></br>  <br>replace summoner art and 1 pendulum call for the skullcrobats. Swaying gaze destroys your scales and burns a little as well as allowing to search for a pendulum, including skulcrobat. If the opponent has pendulum then its even better. You can also set it and bait the opponents spell destruction to your pendulum zones then activate it</br>  <br>I have that deck actually, I suck at using it though. Just felt like making a joke about Kaiba. <br><br>This is always nice, gotta bring the swift hand of justice down.</br></br></br>  <br>If Yuya beats the Champion in the very first duel of the tournament, what would the stakes of the rest of the tourney be? Yuya already beat the best of the best</br>  <br>Should I change my Extra Deck around to cater for more Rank 4s if i add more Skullcrobats i mean.</br>  Isao just punched a wall and has no idea why.  <br>What I said was the reason for Yuya to lose.<br><br>Besides, Yuya's monsters are exactly the ones that Red Daemon's Scarright can kill. None of them can reach an attack past 3000 without the use of Action Cards or Misdirection Wing, and even then, they're all gonna get killed off by Scarright's effects because the attack boosts only last a turn.<br><br>That's another reason for him to lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah. 1 dark metal is enough. castel for degeneracy, since all lvl4 are spellcaster you could add trapeze magician. emeral recycles monsters if you want</br>  <br> Judai throughout the show <br> Kaiser throughout the show  <br> Sho throughout the show <br> Manjoume throughout the show.  <br> Edo in his first real duel and in his last appearance <br> Asuka in Season 1 <br> Jim throughout his appearances. <br> Martin/Yubel with Armityle, plus Yubel's whole Super Fusion shtick.  <br> Chronos in his last duel <br>Most of the Overseas champions and the villains didn't use Fusion for sure, but a LOT of the DA characters used them and Super Fusion was a massive plot point. GX is the Fusion Series for a reason, because it used Fusion more than any other non-Arc-V series, by like, a lot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pick 2 characters from each season you wanna see return in the future, but no MCs<br>DM: Kaiba and Joey<br>GX: Kaiser and Edo</br></br>    <br>Kaiba and Jack are the only two<br>Especially Kaiba</br></br>  <br>Yuya is going to summon Vortex Dragon in his duel against Jack isn't he?</br>  So all things considered, who is the best boy across all the series?  Yuya better get serious and use both Fusion and Xyz summoning this time. I know Jack basically can run over all of his extra deck, but I still want Yuya to put up a fight.  <br>I would prefer if he uses something new. I'm a sucker for evolutions</br>  <br>His last full duel was vs Chojiro, what was so bad about the plays he made there? Would anyone give him shit for losing to the kingu, when Jack is supposed to be this amazing top-tier duelist who stands near the very top of Synchro?</br>  <br>He's going to be losing, then he'll remember Yuzu and fusion summon either Beast Eyes or Rune Eyes in an attempt to strike back.</br>  <br> We're all chicks. there are chicks that are not me in this thread at this very moment. Chicks dig cardgames. </br>  The question that needs to be answered, is probably how are they going to update Jack's deck?  <br>Give him an archetype of D R A G O N S.</br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br> DM, GX, 5Ds and Zexal are Dimension 1. Standard Dimension is Dimension 2, Fusion Dimension is Dimension 3, Synchro Dimension is Dimension 4, Xyz Dimension is Dimension 5. <br><br>I prefer to think of it as Standard being Dimension 2.1 and Fusion being 2.2, Synchro being 2.3, etc. <br><br>DM-GX-5D's is one universe. Zexal is another. Standard and its dimensions are another cluster of dimensions within the same universe.</br></br></br></br></br>  He's still doing it.  Yuzu is getting her own, specially designed riding suit? Yuzu is gonna go through a lot of costume changes, isn't she?  <br>He's never gonna change, just roll with it.</br>  <br>That's Rin's. Yugo's too poor to get another Riding Suit done.</br>  <br>He doesn't know he murdered Yuto. He doesn't remember anything from when he went berserk, probably.</br>   &gt;Yugo and Yuzu are driving to the stadium <br>They see Yuya dueling Jack<br><br>What will their reactions be?</br></br></br>  <br><br>How about this, Fusionverse and Synchroverse exist because of Ylliaster time fuckery that created multiple dimensions of their timeline and the occasional pocket dimention that focuses on that specific era. XYZverse exist because Yuma pressed that reset button to revive everyone instead of leaving them dead because he wanted happy times with Kaito abd the Barians. Standard and Zexal are their own worlds. How they were created is still a mystery.</br></br>  <br>At least the characters realize he's a retard, that's all I could ever ask for.</br>  <br>It's a running gag, very important for an Entertainer, gotta bring a smile to his comrades faces.<br>  Whether it's a GOOD running gag is another matter  <br>And who knows, maybe someday someone will believe him.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what's worse, the LP drain still being on or Reji making Sawatari a lancer even through he contributed nothing to that duel against the Obelisk force. The writing could of simply had Gon,the man, hold things together long enough for Crow boy to win.</br>  <br>At least he gets new cards.</br>  <br> making Sawatari a lancer even through he contributed nothing to that duel against the Obelisk force <br>He Action Carded some LP damage that would have knocked out one of them and set the scales that Gon gave to Shun. Thats as much as anyone who isnt Shun did in that shitty duel</br></br>  <br>GX: Kaiser and Edo<br>Zexal: Shark and Kaito (or Pawn of Fusion Kaito and Resistance Leader IV for dat FAAAANSAAAAAVISU)<br>DM: Nobody. I'd like DM to remain its own thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Sawatari saved Tsukikage's life, man, that ain't nothin'.</br>  <br>Man, don't underrate Tsukikage in that duel, he took it like a fucking champ to get it back to their turns.</br>  <br>Reiji wouldn't have had Sawatari around if he didn't have potential. He does have potential, he just acts like a tard about it. <br><br>The LP penalty is stupid all around. Besides Serena is about the only one that doesn't find Sawatari to be retarded, just loud and annoying. I mean she did hang out with him for a few days and let him tag along on her dueling adventure. She can't be that annoyed by that him honestly.</br></br></br>  <br>Like all Shun duels other than the first Sora v Shun, it was really poorly written.<br>Shun getting BTFO at the Friendship Cup when</br></br>  real talk, why does Shun have an intrusion penalty?  <br> The LP penalty is stupid all around. <br>Is anybody gonna get at him for that or what? This is getting pretty ridiculous, only the Lancers are ever gonna be penalized for it.</br></br>  <br>Because fucking Reiji.</br>  <br> I mean she did hang out with him for a few days and let him tag along on her dueling adventure <br>Every Ruri needs a key person</br></br>  <br>It was installed on his Duel Disk before the Battle Royale, apparently.</br>  <br>So that he can duel on the edge a lot easier.</br>  <br>Sawatari wont have a snowballs chance in hell once Serena meets her true soul mate.</br>  <br>But Yuri already has a soul mate.</br>  Watching GX, it's really bad. Only things I liked are the waifus and the Pro Duelist episodes.<br><br>The manga/Tag Force games are so much better.</br></br>  <br>Probably not, he'll have some excuse that if they can't win with a handicapped then they don't deserve to win, or if they can't let their fellow lancers win 1v1 then they don't deserve to win either. <br><br>Best duo.<br><br>Yuri is gonna have a brainwashed Ruri, I mean Yuto doesn't need anybody now, he's fucking dead. Besides just imagine Serena's life as a SOL.<br><br> Sawatari <br>Boy toy<br> Sora <br>Her little brother<br> Yuri <br>The crazy gay friend<br> Reiji <br>Her stalker NEET<br> Shun <br>The dementia hobo<br> Yuzu <br>Her best friend<br> Everyone else <br>Supporting cast<br><br>But really though, Serena and Yuri don't seem to give two craps about each other, or even know each for that matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Downloading. Are you that same faggot from yesterday?</br>  Posting official top 30 most attractive male Yu-Gi-Oh characters<br><br>Number 30</br></br>  <br> Beast-eyes with no beasts <br> 14 card extra deck </br></br>  <br>29</br>  <br> III is only at number 30 <br>This list is already trash</br></br>  <br>28</br>  <br>They probably don't or have forgotten each other. My bets are on love at first sight. Yuri will turn out to be ten times the creepy stalker Reiji is.</br>  <br>Fuck off. He`s still entertaining. At least the token clumsy retard here is not a female.</br>  <br>27</br>  <br>26</br>  <br> 30 </br>  <br>top 25</br>  <br>How the hell is Pegasus higher up than Gongenzaka? Trash taste.</br>  <br>Yuri would probably throw this cat off a roof, making her cry. Sawatari would let her keep it and then use papa to buy her more cats, bunnies, and butterflies.</br>  <br>24<br><br>I admit, pegasus was a mistake</br></br></br>   Yuuya and co. are getting their asses kicked by the elite mooks <br> suddenly Shun shows up <br> OTKs all three of them right off the bat <br>This Shun wanking needs to stop. How the fuck did he even OTK all three of them with a single attack from Rise Falcon?</br></br></br>  <br>amended number 27</br>  <br> III <br> 30 <br> not number 1 <br>Nigga you got some explaining to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime Rise Falcon is ridiculous. Gains attack of all special summoned monsters and can attack that many times. Instant OTK in most cases. <br>Besides the Shun wanking should end soon hopefully.</br></br>  <br>23<br><br><br><br>I really don't see why people like him. I didn't want to add him to the list at all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Papa approve of a rough girl like Selena?<br> I want to see poor hobo Sawatari </br></br>  <br>Rise Falcon allows you to attack multiple monsters and take all special summoned monsters attack for it's own. <br><br>His deck is strictly made to counter Fusion decks, it just happens to also counter more shit too. <br><br>Besides Standard is the worst dimension. Shun was forced to be good thanks to Fusion. So far we've only seen Serena and Shun be able to do anything remotely good against Synchro, outside of Synchro duelists. Standard is gonna get their asses rolled over once they go to Fusion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br> I really don't see why people like him <br>Someone with this shit taste shouldnt be allowed near lists</br></br>  <br>Rise Falcon can attack all Special Summoned Monsters remember? Now add that the fucker had like 7900 atk and it's practically game.</br>  <br>22</br>  <br>blue eyes is the best in the game, lets be real.</br>  <br>No, it'll cause Sawatari to end up becoming a Rounin and wearing that costume he had on before he dueled Yuya as he travels the world with Serena. She duels for him though, she doesn't want to see him get hurt.</br>  <br>3 is number  after Reira and pic related </br>  <br>Yuya and Gon at least showed competence. The writers just wanted more Shun wanking at everybody else's expense.</br>  <br>21</br>  <br>Yuri would take pictures of her crying face and plaster them all over his room.</br>  <br>Top 20</br>  <br>The only difference is that it can only target 1 special summon monster to get it's attack. The card can quickly become quite ridiculous in a turn or two.</br>  So when do we get descriptions for the next batch of episodes? Thursday-ish?  <br>19</br>  <br>18</br>  <br>Yuya will though since he's the main character, Gon's deck is pretty good at countering most things I've noticed. But you're right, BUY RAIDRAPTORS.<br><br>Disgusting. I'll duel that faggot and teach him a lesson.</br></br></br>  <br>17</br>  <br> 20 <br> Buki <br> not number 2 <br>You have so much shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shun is the only actual veteran with battle experience on the Lancers <br> Built his deck specifically to counter swarm tactics, engage multiple opponents at once and turn their strength against them. <br> Keeps beating chumps who know nothing but MUH SPECIAL SUMMONS MUH ATTACK  <br> Has shown to be bad at adapting to when his opponent doesn't throw out big cards for him to turn on them or when his field gets cleared by effects.  <br> WOW WHAT'S WITH THIS SHUN WANKING <br>What's it like being stupid?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>16</br>  From what I understand: DM/GX/ 5Ds take place in the same universe. Zexal and Arc V take place in two separate universes.Its implied(but not confirmed)Shun homeland is the Zexal universe after Yuma and company went on a journey to another dimension at the end of Zexal.  <br>Top 15</br>  SUBS FUCKING WHEN  <br>14</br>  <br>Reiji probably has experience too. I mean he'd have had to go to the other dimensions to know how their summoning methods worked, also his stadium looks almost identical to the Synchro stadium and it'd make sense for how he gained Synchro on his side so fast, he's probably been there before trying out and only assumed once Yuto/Shun showed up that Synchro had become pawns of fusion while he was busy in Standard. <br><br>Also Serena might as well have battle experience, she actually knows what she's doing, despite never actually seeing real combat.</br></br></br>  <br>13</br>  <br><br>I think it's more like DM-5D's is one coherent story line, ZeXal is a different dimension because BUY XYZ ALSO WHAT ARE SYNCHROS? and Arc-V is supposed to connect all the series again. At least Arc-V gives a perfect explanation how ZeXal fits in with the rest of the series</br></br>  List-kun please kindly fuck off back to /b/  <br>12</br>  <br> Built his deck specifically to counter swarm tactics, engage multiple opponents at once and turn their strength against them <br>Aside from the first LDS trio duel, multiple opponents he duel always act like fucking retards and never try and disrupt his stupid linear plays<br><br> Has shown to be bad at adapting to when his opponent doesn't throw out big cards for him to turn on them or when his field gets cleared by effects.  <br>Only happened in the second Sora duel, which didnt effect him in the slightest or cause any development for some reason<br><br><br> Its implied(but not confirmed)Shun homeland is the Zexal universe after Yuma and company went on a journey to another dimension at the end of Zexal <br>We've seen pretty much nothing of XYZ-verse, but I dont think any of the Yliaster/Yuma Numeron Code theories are accurate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>11</br>  <br>It's probably some tumblr fujoshit that thinks their opinions are important enough to dump 30 images for.</br>  Episode 64: デュエルキング　ジャック・アトラス Dyueru Kingu Jyakku Atorasu (The Duel King – Jack Atlas)<br><br><br>Summary:<br>As proof that they have came to form alliances with the City Council, the Lancers have to participate in the Friendship Cup under Reiji’s proposal. Furthermore, Yuya is forced to duel in an Exhibition Match during the eve of the tournament, and his opponent is the Duel King – Jack Atlas…! In a stadium completely filled with the high tensions of the audience, Yuya feels overwhelmed by Jack’s presence, but he persists on with his ideal of an Entertainment Duel…!<br><br><br>FINALLY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And then Jack will pull a out bullshit card combo where he cheats and deactivates a lingering effect while Yuya is attacking to win the duel?</br>  <br>Well Arc-V could technically be it's own separate thing too. The Prime timeline we'll say does mention like 12 other dimensions, at least I know in GX it definitely does, with one being a Duel Spirit dimension. It's probable that those other dimensions are ZeXal/Xyz, Fusion, Standard, and Synchro, or we just have some type of shadow realm magic, yliaster time travel magic, or ZeXal space time magic that fucked everything up.</br>  <br><br>No more image dumping please</br></br>   the rest of the Lancers are getting chased around the city by Security and hounded at every turn <br> eventually get thrown in fucking jail <br><br> meanwhile Reiji is having afternoon tea with the city council <br> only rescues Reira and leaves the others to get gangbanged in prison <br>Why is Reiji such a fucking asshole?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This fucker can create whatever BS he wants as long as the card game gods don't deem it too OP.</br>  <br> which didnt effect him in the slightest or cause any development for some reason <br><br>People tend to forget that Shun has said before that they'll keep getting up and fighting and staying strong regardless of what happens.</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno m8, Reiji had NO CLUE that Synchro wasn't hostile, remember? When Yugo owned Obelisk Force, Reiji had no fucking idea what was going on. He's probably never been to Xyz either. He didn't seem to know shit about Xyz until he heard about it from Yuto and Shun. <br><br>I doubt Reiji has battle experience, he's just really fucking smart. But he is probably the strongest duelist in the series either way. <br><br><br> Aside from the first LDS trio duel, multiple opponents he duel always act like fucking retards and never try and disrupt his stupid linear plays <br>What? Obelisk Force tried to disrupt everybody with their Spark Shot combo, Shun just went over it by reducing their ATK to 0. Goyo guys tried to disrupt it with Goyo King but MUH RANK. <br><br> which didnt effect him in the slightest or cause any development for some reason <br>Did you....watch episode 49? At all?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They all ended up in the same place eventually, right?</br>  <br>Yuya needs to give his Entertainment Dueling a rest. If YGO has taught me anything, duels are not about fun, they're about black magic and suffering.<br><br>He's trying to get them to build character. Then he realized they suck ass at doing that so he came to save the day.</br></br></br>  <br> Card game gods strike him down for making Scale 1/10 with no drawbacks. <br> Let him do that Kali Yuga/Covenant horseshit, no problem.  <br>The card game gods are capricious and arbitrary.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why did Reiji need Yuto's disk for dimension hopping capabilities? Leo could've just left notes or something behind since he's known a lot longer about the different dimensions than his son.</br>  <br> People tend to forget that Shun has said before <br>Characters can say one thing but still feel differently if they have interesting believable human flaws. Which Shun hasnt had for a while<br><br><br> Obelisk Force tried to disrupt everybody with their Spark Shot combo <br> Shun just went over it by reducing their ATK to 0 <br>Shun did the same thing he always did, make a big RaidRaptor then have everyone gaup and not use any battle traps or disruption<br><br> Did you....watch episode 49? At all? <br>Did you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All the final duels in Yugioh were all about duels being about fun and/or to find closure</br>  <br>I know this is late but<br> no black magician of illusions </br></br>  <br> Shun at only 17 <br>Bad taste<br>Redeemable if Yuuya and Yuuto are 1/2 respectively</br></br></br>  <br> responding to a tumblerfag </br>  I hope the new movie is related to arc-v in some way. For example, Yugi and Kaiba fighting against an academia invasion.  <br>There's lots of bad taste in that list, because it's one person's opinion.</br>  <br> For example, Yugi and Kaiba fighting against an academia invasion <br>No, that'd be fucking awful. Aside from the reasons Yugi showing up in Arc V the show would be bad, it'd be way worse in a movie. A movie has to make sense to a general audience who hasnt seen Arc V (or any Yugioh since DM) so the plot would have to be anemic as fuck. It's like how they had to make Paradoxs motives so nonsensical in BBT so it wouldnt confuse the public with too much Yliaster and Zero Reverse talk</br></br>  <br> duelists from another dimension invading <br>how is that in any way confusing?</br></br>  <br>Obviously, I'm just being brash</br>  <br>I'm gonna fuck that citrus.</br>  <br> Did you? <br><br>Pretty sure he did, unlike you.</br></br></br>  I wish LDS's memory erasure tech was real so I could watch arc-v blind again.  <br>Yugi showing up in GX only made it better</br>  <br>Yuuya have me too pls</br>  <br>Sometimes I consider quitting the franchise cold turkey just so I can marathon it after it ends (whether or not it turns out overall good or bad).</br>  Shun shunned Security with Rise Falcon  <br>I wish I could quit watching it week by week, but the cravings are too strong.</br>   Tomorrow Girl blushing because they have to hide in the mens bathroom <br>Cute</br>  <br>I wish I could watch episode 50 without knowing Jack was showing up beforehand.<br><br>My friend who's bingewatching Arc-V lately did and he FREAKED OUT. It was great.</br></br></br>  I've been rewatching, and hitting episode 7 I wonder if this duel is telling us how Yuto "lost" Ruri. The way he reacts when she tells him that she'll just do it if he can't, he blames himself for Ruri being hurt, etc.<br><br>Between that and "I want to protect my friends" turning into "You're a lot like Ruri" makes me believe Yuto was a bad duelist until he toughened up during the invasion. Ruri was always saving his ass, and eventually she got wrecked by someone while trying to save him.</br></br>  New banlist when?  <br>Nossan, stop.</br>  Who do you think will voice Ruri? Hard mode it has to be someone from Super Sentai in order to keep up with XYZ dimension being voiced by former Blue rangers.  <br>who cares?</br>  <br>Matthew Mercer</br>  <br>Johnny Yong Bosch</br>  <br>Asami Kai/Magiblue's actress.</br>  Why didn't they just call it Entermate Trump Magician. Fuck. <br><br> Yes I know it would've had to be called Majutsushi and all the Entermates have English names, shut up. </br></br>  <br>Ayana Taketatsu</br>  <br>Crispin Freeman</br>  <br>Conan O'Brien</br>  <br>Why ask the question when you already know the answer?</br>  <br>In a dream world, Nao Nagasawa. In reality, it's probably gonna be the Yuzu cosplayer from P-Cute.</br>  <br>It'd be interesting if Creation and Destruction made an appearance, but beyond that...</br>  Anyone got a Speedroid decklist?  <br>SHAVE BOOMERANG <br>MITSUME NO DAISU</br></br>  <br> duels are not about fun <br>Yes, they are. When all this nightmare ends, they`ll go back to properly have fun.</br></br>  It's ok to marry alternative universe Ruris?  <br>Only if you're as handsome as Shun.</br>  <br>How crude and strong would their babies be?</br>  Archtype that uses card placement when?  <br> Serena goes "YUGO SHOUKAN" as Shun does the deed </br>  <br> YUGO YA NAI <br> SHUN DA! </br></br>  <br>Senet was a thing, it didn't work too good.</br>  <br> Shun goes "WHEN TWO DISTANT SOULS BECOME ONE THE POWER OF ZEXAL IS REVEALED" <br><br>And that's how they created the Numeron Code.</br></br></br>  Just watched the latest episode. So many great moments. The arrest division committing every single mistake characters have made in duels against XYZ so far was hilarious("only 100 atack? hahaha" and "no level doesn't mean its level is 0", that had to be intentional). It also hurt to see Crow being so dismissive of Jack, this Crow and JJack didn't grow up together, they weren't Signers together, this isn't how it was meant to be, I found it kinda sad.<br><br>Also, why does Jean Mitchell want to show Yuya that Yuzu is doing well? To torture him with NTR?</br></br>  <br> Also, why does Jean Mitchell want to show Yuya that Yuzu is doing well? <br>To torture me by reminding me that I will never be able to make a cute boy that protective of me<br>But more realistically because he wanted to rope Yuuya himself into competing against Jack Atlas</br></br></br>  <br>I think he wants Yuya to become mindbroken by getting owned hard by Jack.</br>  <br>That's what I figured, then he won't have the will to go on. Or at least that's what Jean-Michel thinks will happen, but too bad for him Yuuya's the main character</br>  <br>I should add, Jack is probably the only character so far that is likely to be even above Reiji in terms of dueling skills.</br>  <br>I hope he stays at the top. I hate it when new characters just shit all over the previous ones after like only 10 episodes of development.</br>  <br> mfw they turn Jack into a strong-ishijima-tier character </br>  <br> that image <br>Oh my</br></br>  <br> Yuzu: Yuya! <br> Yugo: He's making me look like shit FUCK </br></br>  <br><br><br>Well, Yuya's eventually gonna have to beat or at least tie with Jack in order to make him respect him for him to rally Synchro to LDS' cause. If academia doesn't invade before that and Yuya gains his respect by fighting alongside him against the invaders. That's the only ways I can see this arc being resolved, but who knows what crazy twists are still to come.</br></br></br>  I think Red Wyvern will be a level 5 Synchro monster which will boost the attack of a monster by 500 if Red Wyvern is used as a material.  <br>Would they have birth defects?

Yuzu is more of a man than he is.</br>  <br>I'd understand if the intrusion penalty was something applied to everyone and it's just a universal rule for some reason, but it's only been the Lancers so far.<br><br>Also, I liked how Chojiro didn't hesitate at all jumping off a tall concrete building, trusting that one of Yuya's monsters could catch them.</br></br></br>  <br>Its pretty easy to mistake him for being a girl.</br>  <br>He's fiercely the cutest too and pushes everyone's buttons in every way possible<br> Taking care of emotional Yuuya <br> Being taken care of by protective Yuuya <br>Well everyone with an appreciation for boys that is. I feel like Yuzu typing this.<br> I will never be Yuuya's Yuzu </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw no Yuya as your little brother </br>  I like how they put Synchros as the main arc this time, because Synchros are THE summon, fuck fusion and everything else, Synchro are the real evolution!  why did reiji and jean give eachother sex eyes  <br>thingken of keikaku</br>   Next episode <br> Duel King: Jack Atlus <br><br>Ore no tuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurn</br></br></br>  <br>they want the D<br>they have a thirst for a hot sweaty throwdown</br></br>  <br>THis</br>  <br><br>Jean-Michael stop samefagging.</br></br>  <br>Reiji has several Ds to pass around</br>  <br>Fuck off, you wish to have a Fusion/Xyz Quasar.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's totally why they have nothing as good as the current synchros and xyz, that's why they are the weakest summoning method bar Ritual, and that's why even with an arc on synchro, they're there's no staple synchros.</br>  <br> what is Vortex <br> what is Infinity </br></br>  <br>Number S0: Hope ZEXAL<br>;&lt;)</br></br>  <br> Double dubs <br>DAMN YOU, NEET MAN</br></br>  <br> 55 <br>Sasuga Yu zu </br></br>  <br>Yuzu...</br>  <br>Shit suffering incomming.</br>  <br><br><br>.......<br>sYNCHROS AR E THE GREAT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dat eyefucking.</br>  <br>God, the sexual tension between these two is so thick, you'd think they're already canon.</br>  <br>Too bad she's getting plowed by Yugo now.</br>  <br>Every time I view something from this romance it hurts that I can't be in either position</br>  <br>This was nowhere near as bad as it could be, although Gon's voice alone means I definitely won't be continuing with this. I always did love how the dub gave throw away filler villains wacky accents. Made their duels a lot more entertaining. STRONG Ichijima was a pretty boring opponent in japanese.<br><br>Call it nostalgia, but I still like the GX dub, and aussie jack is amazing. If not for 5ds infinitely superior ost, I'd be pretty evenly split between dub and sub.</br></br></br>  <br>In your dreams, Fusion</br>  <br>GX dub was the fucking best.

I hope you dont plan on actually using it.</br>  <br>wanna sell the mako</br>  <br>Really hope you're not using that.</br>    <br>Just wait for Mako to come out.</br>  I'll ask again. Are these any good? As in the translations and quality?  <br>T-thanks for using my picture, OP.</br>  <br>I would have bought a poster. Skateboard, what is this 1990? May as well put it on those kendama toys that every middle schooler has.</br>  Sorry for taking a bit to respond.<br><br>I'm looking for ~85 USD<br><br>I'd take 50 for her.<br><br>Both have been opened and displayed, but aren't damaged or anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So much pink!<br><br>And blurry camera phone showing how much I suck apparently.</br></br>   tfw forgot password to NY and couldn't log in to order pic related the whole weekend because of AX. <br>Glad I got one of the last ones at the temporary reduced price. She's a little less popular than Azusa it seems.<br><br>Why the heck is she so cheap on NY though. She's cheaper than even ordering her straight from animaru.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. They hired the translator that did the Baka-Tsuki TLs. It's essentially the same but cleaned up and edited.</br>  <br> cross </br>  <br>WHEN THE FUCK DID THAT MAKO FIG GET RELEASED? I'VE BEEN WAITING ON THAT SHIT FOR AAAGES</br>  <br> not owning a cross <br><br>faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I have these they are good. Sometimes you can't tell if kyon is thinking or speaking but other than that no major issues</br>  <br>Fuck you too!</br>  <br>nice board, i wouldn't use it tho, but i used hookups boards a lot when i was an edgy teenager, loved that decks</br>  My filth arrived  <br>Pre-orders closed months ago, anon.</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>The FBI is probably tracking your every movement right now</br>  <br> KLKfag too retarded to keep up with a figures preorder and release dates. <br>Not surprised.</br></br>  <br>But of course! I invite the agent investigating me over to play poker every Sunday night. Mr B can't hold his booze at all.</br>  <br>Are you from Reddit?</br>  Anyone know if memory foam pillows are sold in daki size? <br>I want to snuggle with my Pochaco in the densest way possible.</br>    <br>cute but that middle one is quite lewd.</br>  Don't know if anyone else has this nendoroid, but this is probably the hardest one to put together with the long hair and all. Is there an easy way for the stand that anyone's figured out?  <br>Skatefag here. Most boards with anime related things on then are shit. Hook Ups board company is kill</br>  <br>That's intentional, they do it in the show too.</br>  <br>It's just a bare navel, thighs and thin panties, anon. What's lewd about those?</br>  <br>when I first saw it, it looked like a dick bulge</br>  <br>Nice.<br><br>Pic is a recent arrival.<br><br>Also, preordered:<br>https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail<wbr>/detail.php?product_id=130875</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd tbh. I hope you read them in public</br>  <br>Pic related. I had the same board for 5 months and it razor tailed. Also it had a Noice pressure cracked after 4 months</br>  Why would anyone pay for a hardcopy of doujins other than to support an artist they like?  <br> It's just a bare navel </br>  <br>Oh shit, I know that middle one, it's titled like "Thank you very bitch' or something right?</br>  <br>You're my fetish.</br>  <br>Sent you a message on mfc for gouki.</br>  <br>The title reads "The Breasts of the Girl with Short Pants".</br>  <br>She is nowhere near the hardest nendo to assemble.</br>  <br>About how much are you looking for for homu? How is the box condition?</br>  <br>Whoa re you?</br>  <br>Collection purposes, and in the case of doujinshi, it's the only way to get a copy since not every doujinshi gets scanned.</br>  <br> since not every doujinshi gets scanned <br>I hope you are a nice person that scans the doujin he buys that aren't on the net already.</br></br>  <br>Why do people buy art books?</br>  I remember an anon once mentioning how toranoana will switch between regular orders and reservations at specific times. I've figured out that reservations will turn off at 9AM Japan time but does anyone know when they turn back on?  <br>To scan them so I can enjoy them for free.</br>  <br>Why do people buy things?</br>  <br>Why do people buy?</br>  <br>Why do people?</br>  <br>Why do?</br>  <br>Why?</br>  Selling figures, shoot me a PM if you see something you want! I'm getting boxes tomorrow for those of you who have already claimed stuff, so shipping prices will be in then!<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/xYellow</wbr></br>  <br>How much for meido kuroneko?</br>  <br>?</br>  <br>How much for you?</br>  <br><br>While I don't scan every doujinshi I have that hasn't been released (mainly due to lack of time, and that I find scanning/cleaning tedious), I do scan things on occasion.   I've done a few from this pic actually.  </br></br>  <br>How much for everything?</br>  <br>That's mai daughteru and I'm really unsure about selling her, actually.<br><br><br>That's lewd, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good don't sell her, I was just interested in seeing how much you were going to charge for her.</br>    <br>WHY WHY WHY WHY?<br>OH, It's from the show!</br></br>  <br> enuma elish <br> those two Rita doujins <br>I like you</br></br></br>  <br>How much for that magical nia?</br>  <br>How much for Tsukihi?</br>  <br>I would scan every single doujin and manga I own if I could do it without damaging them. <br>I'm tempted to get that book scanner someone posted in the other thread but I'm not 100% sure it's worth it. Seems kinda unstable too. <br><br>I just want to share.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Browse around and see which ones are good.<br>If I owned doujins and mangos I would prefer to scan them so I can read them easily without worrying about wearing out my books.</br></br>  <br>How much for both Nichijou nendies?</br>  <br>I kinda want that shredded one but 8" is titchy. Think I'd get the school girl. What're the shapes like?</br>  <br><br><br> shoot me a pm <br> asks in the thread anyways <br><br>Quit being retards.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This looks like it could work too. One of these days I'll have to go over to Staples or Best Buy and see if they have any on display that I can fiddle with. Seems like it'd be more convenient than trying to get a book to balance on the scanner bed just right.</br>  <br>That thing looks like a toy.<br>I'd be surprised if it were good quality.</br></br>  <br> Hook Ups board company is kill <br>Disappointed. <br><br><br>Was it your second deck or something I get razor tail within a few a weeks and they normally don't last me more than two months because they snap on me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> scanning &amp; damaging doujinshi. <br><br>For me, If I don't feel too strongly about a doujinshi, I won't scan it since I find scanning in general to be bothersome. <br><br>But, If I really like a doujinshi, I might not scan it since I want to keep by book in good condition. On the other hand I feel strongly enough, I'll rip it apart without hesitation (well maybe slight hesitation) since, it's worth scanning and sharing. <br><br><br>That looks pretty neat. Depending on the price/image quality(most important) I might get that. If it makes scanning faster and non-destructive (although it might be since some artwork goes directly into the spine, and you'd have to pry it open anyway) then I'm all for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one I'm considering costs close to $300 so it's pretty average. There seems to be some really nice and big ones, but those cost over a grand.<br><br>Yeah, I don't like touching them too much either. I prefer digital over physical when it comes to reading so it would benefit me too. <br><br><br>I've looked into those for a long time too and honestly none seem to be good enough to produce high quality scans. They seem to have problems keeping things strait and the image quality isn't too nice from what I've seen.<br>You'd have to get one yourself to really test it out, but I don't think it's worth the money and trouble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Got another fig of my beatiful waifu Rikka</br>  <br>Rikka is shit and also already has a boyfriend.</br>  <br>It was during a leg injury so I'd say maybe 3 of those 5 months weren't skated.</br>  <br>Shit fig.<br>Shit waifu.</br></br>  <br> not cucking yuuta </br>  <br>I just grabbed an image from the first result off Amazon. It only saves in JPEG or PDF, though supposedly it scans at 300, 600 or 900 DPI.<br><br><br> If it makes scanning faster and non-destructive (although it might be since some artwork goes directly into the spine, and you'd have to pry it open anyway) then I'm all for it. <br>Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I have a hard time keeping things balanced on my scanner, which is quite old now. Sometimes I don't dare try to scan something because the binding's too stiff and I want to keep damage to a minimum.<br><br><br> They seem to have problems keeping things strait and the image quality isn't too nice from what I've seen. <br>Most of my scans with a regular scanner end up crooked anyway so that doesn't bother me so much. Sucks about the quality though. I probably won't be buying one for a while, anyway; have other things to get first that take priority.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  filename <br>same</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry but I wouldn't be caught dead with this kind of stuff in public. I'm a lay-low faggot that likes anime and occasional cute girls doing cute things but how can this be socially acceptable to parade outside publicly?</br>  <br>Also got Ryuko while I was at AX</br>  <br>Please scan the Ran Yakumo one. She's been my waifu for like 10 years.<br><br>If you have other Ran ones or foxgirl ones scan those too.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit taste.<br>I wouldn't be surprised if you overpaid for those shitty prize figures too.</br></br>  <br>And Satsukki</br>  <br><br>How much did you pay?</br></br>  <br>normalfag get out</br>  <br>$20 each</br>  <br>That seems pretty neat. I've had a bunch of stuff I've been meaning to scan, but it is a pain in the ass. I might grab one of those and try it out, since it looks like they're only around $50.</br>  <br>I hope you weren't expecting people to use that board in public.</br>  <br>Just one more thing, and my favorite thing I bought as well.</br>  <br>I kind of agree with him to an extent.<br>Its like gayfags and tattoofags.<br>You're gay? Cool keep it to yourself, no need to let the whole world know.<br>You like MLP? Good for you, fuck off, no I don't want to talk about ponies.<br>These are the type of people that I can't stand, and anime loving faggots who do it are no better than pony fags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've fapped to that pic before.<br>How's it feel knowing the reason her eye is shut is because I nutted into it.<br>Now you know why she wears the eyepatch.</br></br></br>  <br>If you do get one post the results here.</br>  <br>But nobody is fucking talking about this in public. Nobody is forcing you to come into these threads, let alone /a/ of all boards. You don't like figures? Good for you, fuck off. Nobody gives a single shit about your opinion, it's not valued or wanted in these threads or on the board.</br>  Is Polypropylene a good material for posters?<br>Looking to buy these.</br>  To whoever warned me about amazon jp shipping being shitty on the handling, I'm sorry I doubted you. Just got this picture from my roommate who signed for it while I was away, I hope there's no damage to the books.  <br>Of course. Probably going to hold off and see if it goes on sale during Amazon's prime day thing.</br>  <br> on the board </br>  <br>This. Most anime boards are for show. Even Hook Ups don't last long</br>  <br>Jesus buying from Amazon jp is like playing Russian roulette. Luckily I've never had one turn out this bad. <br>Be sure to leave feedback about packaging. Maybe if enough people bitch about it they'll use something better.</br></br>  <br>Why do you all hate on my waifu so much?</br>  <br>It wouldn't be so bad if their boxes were sturdy enough to withstand the weight of books. In that picture it looks incredibly flimsy. So far I haven't had trouble with light things like BDs and CDs. Hope your books are okay, anon.</br>  <br>Sure, but I have at least two other scans I'm working on before I get to it. Picture unrelated.<br><br><br> Jesus Christ How Horrifying.jpg </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't listen to them, anon. Your waifu is great.<br><br> But mine is 1000 times better. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, he said it's just thin cardboard and shrink wrap with little padding. I get home tomorrow, I hope this fucking $90 book set isn't damaged.</br>  <br>Who is yours?</br>  <br> Okada Kou <br>Grade A taste.

This was my set up for a while, before I moved.</br>  <br> Figs out in the open <br>I personally freak out about dust, man. Glass cabinet or nothing for me</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I had mine out for a while, and that shit accumulates frighteningly fast. 3-4 months and there's already a fairly thick layer.</br>  <br><br> he doesnt know about the time saber lost a hand </br></br>  <br>Space was pretty tight, and I took the tradeoff in display room over convenient not-having-to-dust. It wasn't too bad to dust them once in a while.</br>  <br>panic.jpg<br>My place is particularly dusty, as well</br></br>  No delays..?  <br>That's not as bad I guess, jealous of the lack of dust though</br>  Quick. Someone's selling pic related for moderately cheap. I know Alter is good, but anyone that owns it can tell me anything I should know about her?  <br> Tsubaki Jushirou <br> Koyanagi Royal <br> Jun <br> Asagi Ryu <br>You just don't stop do you.<br><br><br>What's the one in the top right of the upper left picture?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was in a store and I read them and they read like a pretty typical young adult novel, so I guess its fine. <br>It was kinda disappointing, I don't know why I expected more.</br></br>  <br>I have some custom-made posters myself. 50x70cm, printed on high quality photo paper.<br><br>Recently brought some cheap frames for them as I moved to a new place, but I haven't put them in yet.</br></br></br>  <br>10/10 would buy 3 of them and use one</br>  <br>yeah, her show is shit</br>  <br>I know. I was talking about the quality of the fig in particular.</br>  <br> Buying figures of characters you know nothing about </br>  <br>I do know about her. By "her" I meant the fig, not the character.</br>  <br>They're alright, I felt they got better as they went on, but were the junk-food of books through and through. Not that there's anything wrong with that.<br><br><br>20, she's in good condition and has all the parts. I got her pre-owned, and the front of her box was bent in a bit. Upper right corner of the window came unglued. Box is otherwise undamaged. I'll take and upload pics in a bit, charging my phone.<br><br><br>I'm one of the people from the last thread  http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/Plunderburger</wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do people just pretend to like Tomoko?<br><br>She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude.</br></br>  She thinks shit about people occasionally in her own mind. Does that make her a terrible person? I don't think that makes anyone a terrible person, and I think everyone does it. <br><br>Also, she suffers from severe social anxiety to the point of throwing up. The fact that she still keeps trying to overcome that and puts herself out there is admirable.</br></br>   Sounds like a 4channer.   <br>I like her more then the usual Mary Sue.</br>  beaners from /v/ have latched onto her, just report any avatarfagging you see  I'm a shitty person, why would I not enjoy another shitty person? If anything, a non-shitty-person waifu would be hard to deal with if you're a shitty person.  <br>My type of girl</br>  <br> She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude. <br>That's what abandonment does to you, she needs a healing hug.</br></br>  <br>I don't hate myself so why would I hate her?</br>  <br>Do people just pretend to like Asuka?<br><br>She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude.</br></br></br>  Because Tomoko would be closer to life if she was a 300 lbs neckbearded basement dweller with her vast collection of yaoi/disney movies  <br>What has she done that's shitty? <br><br>Her family are the ones that are terrible people.</br></br></br>  <br>There are tomoko avatarfags on /a/? I don't think there are people who even like her</br>  Just like me!  <br>Nice butt in shiny latex bodysuit.</br>  <br>It's your fault that she isn't popular.</br>  <br>what "bad" thing has she actually done? Sure she thinks some bad things of people from time to time because she doesn't know them, but who doesn't? Our conscious thoughts don't reflect our true opinion, otherwise we would do terrible things all day long.<br>Actually considering how much she loathes other people and still tries her best to make them like her, i would say she is one admirable person</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry</br>  She's just like me a girl with SA<br><br>now don't hit on me silly boyz!</br></br>  <br>She's lazy, spiteful and she blames everyone else for her problems (just like one of us).</br>  <br>While I also think Tomoko is an admirable character for her honesty, determination, and worldview, it is fact that she is inconveniencing people around her more than anything, and it is something she is sadly not aware of too much.<br><br>She is very rude to the mother and brother who are trying to help her, is a bad influence on Kii-chan she had now become a first-hand witness of, and nearly sabotaged her friendship with Komiyama for unbased and paranoid reasons. If Tomoko realises just how badly she treated those people and does something to make up for it, she's well on the road to become somebody magnificent and complete.</br></br></br>  Most people here would fuck themselves if they could, that's what Tomoko is for.  Speaking of Tomoko what happened to the tomoko drawings?  <br>OP died and never published them, rip</br>  <br>Because /a/ love themselves, and she is the /a/ incarnate</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with loving yourself.</br>  <br>What a faggot, I'll do it myself then.</br>  <br>I never said it's wrong</br>  <br> Do people just pretend to like Tomoko? <br>No</br></br>  <br> She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude. <br>Fuck you too bitch</br></br>  That describes most posters on this board.  I am physically unable to finish watching episode 8. Help.  <br>You have autism.</br>  <br>I mean. that's a given.</br>  <br>Why is she a shitty person?<br><br>90% of what is shown of her are her thoughts. She doesn't say almost anything that she thinks. <br>Are you saying that people on /a/ don't think like Tomoko?</br></br></br></br>  Tomoko is literally /r9k/: the character  <br>Generally I think most people are garbage but don't say it to their face, so yes.</br>  <br>She's not the nicest person, but people typically like a person they can relate to.<br>A lot of people can emphatize with her social anxiety, sperginess and lonliness.<br><br>She's also cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Supreme autism.</br>  <br><br>Exactly. For example, I think you two are retards trying to show off how smart you are for understanding a shallow anime character, but I usually never say such things and I don't think it makes me a shit person.</br></br>  <br>Thanks Doc.</br>  <br>Why do you like to bully people online on an anonymous imageboard anon?</br>  <br>I absolutely have to agree on the last part, most people would have given up long ago and accepted her fate, but she is STILL trying, that shows not only great desire but fierce determination.<br><br>She's failed in ways that would have crushed your average person with social anxiety.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm learning from anime characters I guess.</br>  <br>Normie please leave.</br>  <br>yeah there's at least one<br>use filenames + the archive<br>you'll quickly find that<br><br>https://archive.moe/_/search/filena<wbr>me/1414026850294.png/<br>is exactly who I meant<br>kill yourself, beaner</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UqS<wbr>Q_2C9sUo</wbr>  [ ]<br>Oh jesus that was so hard to do.<br> fucking OP. </br></br></br>  <br>Cause I like making weak people feel pathetic.</br>  <br>I actually pretend to not like her in order to stir up conversation in dying Watamote threads. Not even joking.</br>  <br>I wasn't avatarfagging mate, I swear.<br><br>I was just being proper and sharing some pretty fanart of our goddess.</br></br></br>  <br>She's got a nice ass, even canonically.</br>  <br>Wow, I didn't know not being a selfcentered cunt makes you a normie now.</br>  <br><br> tomokass appreciation <br><br>I want to spread her skinny cheeks so I can watch my cock violate her lady places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But she never makes any progress, does she? I actually don't know because I'm only four episodes in. It seems futile. She's torturing herself for nothing.</br>  <br>Do you even know where you are?</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/filena<wbr>me/1397096905534.jpg/<br>back to /v/</br></wbr></br>  <br>I'd rather watch Tomoko and Tomoki go at it while I watch from the closet breathing heavily.</br>  <br>The manga is way longer and has a developed narrative. One of the problems of the anime is that it is so short that it leaves a bitter taste in people's mouths and that Tomoko did nothing to develop as a character. So if you're continuing watching, be aware it's not the whole story.</br>  <br>Tomoko now is much different than Tomoko at the beginning of the manga, It's nice.</br>  You don't have to pretend to like Komiyama. She's everything Tomoko is, only slightly better.  <br>Meganes are the enemy.</br>  <br>Finally, thank you, anon.</br>   <br>All she does is lusts over Tomoki and be a bitch to Tomoko whenever she can. No thanks.</br>    <br>No ;_;</br>  <br>Tomoko and Tomoki best pair</br>   The anime aired 2 years ago   <br><br>Hey fuck you.<br><br>Did the latest chapter get delayed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Assmad Reifag detected.</br>  I don't like her because  she is just an uglier version of my waifu     <br>The chapter is out, but the translations are taking a long while.</br>  <br>I don't like her, it was just entertaining to watch her unknowingly fuck up her own life and to read about all of the people here cringing over her antics because she reminds them of themselves.</br>  <br>Where does the time go?</br>  <br> with an even shittier attitude <br>Are you retarded or something? I wish I was as optimistic, strong and determined as her.</br></br>  <br>I would have a good time shit talking people with her.</br>  <br> uglier </br>  Satch c3bu instead. At least the protagonist on that gets her shit together in the end.  I would to discuss a topic I feel is important.<br>Does Tomoko smell bad?<br>While she is sometimes described as "stinky" I think of her as having a distinct but not unpleasant odor. Others disagree and say she would smell quite bad.<br>If possible please list some odors you think would be part of her scent.</br></br></br>  How can you hate her when she only speaks the truth.<br><br> It physically pains me to read watamote. I have to stop every few pages because I can feel the heatenings. </br></br>  <br>She smells like pussy and ass.</br>  You hate her bwcause she is you, and you hate yourself, therefore the only way out is suicide<br><br>We've been over this anon</br></br>  <br>she's cute lad, is it that hard to believe?<br><br>also does anyone have a gif/webm of her bowing to the teacher then running off in the first episode? It's pretty desu tbh</br></br></br>  <br>So the key here is to learn to love how much of a jerk you are.</br>  <br> that random kenshiro redraw popping in <br>my sides</br></br>  <br>Mis translation meme.</br>  She drove a big old Lincoln<br>with suicide doors<br>and a sewing machine in the back<br>and a light bulb that looked like<br>an alligator egg<br>was mounted up front on the hood<br><br>and she had an Easter bonnet that had been signed<br>by Tennessee Ernie Ford<br>and she always had saw dust in her hair<br>and she cut two holes in the back of her dress<br>and she had these scapular wings<br>that were covered with feathers and electrical tape<br>and when she got good and drunk<br>she would sing about Elkheart, Indiana<br>where the wind is strong<br>and folks mind their own business<br><br>and she had at least a hundred old baseballs<br>that she'd taken from kids<br>and she collected bones of all kinds<br>and she lived in a trailer under a bridge<br>and she made her own whiskey and gave cigarettes to kids<br>and she'd been struck by lightning seven or eight times<br>and she hated the mention of rain<br><br>and she made up her own language<br>and she wore rubber boots<br>and she could fix anything with string<br>and her lips were like cherries<br>and she was stronger than any man<br>and she smelled like gasoline and root beer fizz<br>and she put mud on a bee sting<br>I got at the creek<br>and she gave me<br>my very first kiss<br>and she gave me<br>my very first kiss<br><br>talking 'bout my little Kathleen<br>she's just a fine young thing<br>someday she'll wear my ring<br>my little Kathleen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating glasses <br><br>You don't deserve anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ in a nutshell.</br>  Gospel, I know you're lurking around here, stop slacking and give us the new chapter already.  <br> 90% of what is shown of her are her thoughts. She doesn't say almost anything that she thinks. <br>Sound like a certain other anime character I know.</br></br>  <br>Tomoko smell like squid and sweat. <br><br>I would fuck the living hell out of a dirty, greasy, sweaty Tomoko.</br></br></br>  <br>And legs, but their was more ass shots cause someone animating was a assman</br>  She's a dirty, useless, ugly, yet cynical and self centered piece of shit. Just like most people on here.  <br><br>Please refrain from talking negatively about my daughteru.</br></br>  <br>You must be very disappointed in your daughteru. My condolences.</br>  I just want to make dirty love to her because she's a perverse bitch that would do anything in bed with her ugly, smelly body.  <br>You included? Or, are you exempt?</br>  <br>No, no. No disappointment from me, I can't complain, I am happy to have Komi as my daughteru, so long as she is living an existence she is comfortable with.</br>  <br>Why would I exempt myself? We're not a bunch of teenagers.</br>  /a/ has a long history of liking unlikable characters. I don't see what's so weird about that.  nu it's the best anime.  <br> best anime. <br>mmm...</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's definitively in a much better place now than before.</br>  <br>Someone hasn't kept up with the latest chapters, have they?</br>  <br> they're not pretending </br>  <br>I want them to make up and hug each other.</br>  <br> Deats by Br.Bre </br>  People that claim she's a shitty person most likely cannot handle the fact how close her personality and habbits are to themeselves.  <br>eh nandatte?</br>  <br>She's smell like BO and greasy hair. I'm sure she'd smell like fish too if you stripped her naked. I want to drag her into the bath and scrub her clean like an unruly cat.</br>  Most anons are shitty people. Face the facts  <br><br>can confirm.am making beans now and rubbing my dick on tomoko pic on my phone</br></br>   I go to sleep for 9 hours and this thread is still up. <br>Not bad.</br>  <br><br>Long story short?<br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br>  At least she admits that she's scum.  I want to seize Tomoko's trembling legs between each of my hands.  <br>Thanks</br>  Came across this video:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XO8<wbr>A1liUcGU</wbr>  [ ]<br>Opinions?</br></br>  <br> that pic <br>Number 1 or number 2?</br></br>  <br>What a faggot.</br>  <br>He can't even pronounce her name.</br>  <br><br> Americans trying to pronounce Japanese </br></br>  <br> cutting out her feet from the picture <br><br>Unforgiveable</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd give her toes a blowjob, if you know what I mean...</br></br>  <br>Gross, she doesn't even shower</br>  <br>Same.<br><br><br>She does.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Canonically she doesn't smell bad.<br>You fags keep claiming she's dirty without even reading the manga.</br></br>  <br>She has the cutest little legs and feet.</br>  <br>What chapter?</br>  <br>do not ever say these things about her</br>  <br>Can't remember but there is a chapter where her brother confirms that she doesn't smell like anything.</br>  <br><br>56, and multiple times it's shown she bathes normally except in that one story with the ants</br></br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to open up a box of Pocky for purposes of eating it like Tomoko.</br></br>  I'm going to cum inside of her so that she dies from childbirth.  <br>Where do you get that shit?</br>  <br>Grab some unprepared noodles and stick them up your asshole. When they come out, you have pocky.</br>  <br>I don't pretend, I really like her</br>  <br>I'm sorry Tomoko-chan. I'm really sorry!</br>  <br>I don't know anon... These noodles look more like a cube than a stick.</br>  <br>Try spaghetti noodles.</br>  <br><br>bucatini</br></br>  <br>You have to try with all of your might!</br>  <br>Thanks anon kun, really thanks</br>  <br><br>Word.</br></br>    <br> Psycho theme begins playing </br>    <br>she smells like you did as a teenager but you didn't know better<br><br>bad</br></br></br>  <br> Where do you get that shit? <br><br>If your city has a Chinatown you can probably find some there.</br></br></br>  I guess Kosaka's full name is "Imae Kosaka"<br>(Kosaka shows up at ch.5 and ch.15)</br>  <br> on /a/ <br> doesn't know where to find Pocky <br><br>Either you're a troll or just stupid. I'm going with just stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What does pocky have to do with anime an manga?<br>Dumb otaku.</br></br>  What if you woke up one day and had become one of Tomoko's plush toys.  <br>I'd probably forever smell like the shame, sweat, and stench of an unwashed shut-in. <br><br>Or about normal for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>talking about the adamantium</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up scrotumlicker, she is my queen!!</br>    I want to  hold  Tomoko's  hand  as we  walk through the park on a date.   <br>Why the fuck should you necessarily know? It's just fucking Pocky, it's incredibly bland snack that just leaves you wanting for a REAL cookie, biscuit or candybar.<br><br>If I buy a packet of chocolate coated biscuits or chocolate chip cookies, I've gotten way better, and way more, chocolate, as well as sweet bread.<br><br>The only time I've ever seen Pocky is when local stores would sometimes have special foreign shelves, and it's pretty hard to justify going for the Pocky when on the space next to it is chocolate chip cupcakes with the American flag on the packaging.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude. <br>And somehow you can't identify with her?</br></br>  <br>I'm fine with it</br>  can /a/ explain me why the purple thing appears in this scene?      <br>Looks like Domo-kun.</br>  <br>she won it at a claw machine game iirc</br>  <br>  Claims Tomoko's a shitty person with an even shittier attitude. </br>  <br><br>this pic is from chapter 8 but she buy "purple thing" in the chapter 10</br></br>   ITT: Shirobako <br>I just finnished Shirobako, and it´s such a great work. I don´t have enough words to describe the magnificent development of the characters. <br>Also, Miyamori best girl</br></br>  It was definitely my favorite anime of the season. The threads were pretty fun too, but shame you missed that. There were so many threads when episode 16 aired.<br>Also, every girl is best.</br>  Diesel=Aoi&gt;Ema&gt;Zuka&gt;shit&gt;tires  <br>I can get behind this</br>  S2 when?  <br>What a waste of cream.</br>  Is there anything he can't do?  <br>This has got something like it with Vegeta right?<br><br>None of my reverse searches are giving anything for these pages so I can't find anything similar.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it's on bato just look up Onepunch-Man doujinshi</br>  <br>Woah.<br><br>I never expected it to be so easy.</br></br></br>  <br> dem feet <br>My dick.</br></br>  <br>bullshit. If anything it looked better.</br>  First episode tomorrow. Let's keep this thread going till then.<br><br>Cautiously optimistic for Papa Bones.</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll probably be in the last episode of the show.</br>  <br><br><br>I see<br><br> as of yet no, unless you count the servants <br><br> Judging by what the anon said I assume one of the servants is going to turn on him? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sense of justice: -500 <br>Wasn't Ainz just a normal office employee pre-Yggdrasil or did turning into an Undead cripple whatever morality he has along with his emotions?</br></br>  <br>Yes it's   the penguin  </br>  <br>likely his setting on his Character, it also seem to have an effect on his overall personality, as he just regards humans as small animals.</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127650<wbr>667/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>It would help if you posted a specific example rather than a vague description. 自分 can be used as a first person pronoun (it's common with military types) but it can also be a second person pronoun (especially in 関西弁). It's also "self".</br>  <br>Good luck. Don't ever skip a day.</br>  <br>Well, I don't really have specific example, I'm mostly just thinking of a general construct I've seen a couple times. To rephrase, if the speaker has already established both first person (俺) and second person (テメー) pronouns in the conversation, is it generally safe to assume that 自分 is being used as a third person pronoun like "one," or "they"?</br>  <br>Yeah, usually.</br>  <br>What's the issue?</br></blockquote>]
