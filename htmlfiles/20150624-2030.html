There is something very off about them. Especially the mouth. And they all have the same copypasted open mouth in every character. I like that the got joints but I wish they would learn how to make cute faces. But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.      But have to say, if they make yugioh characters I would buy them anyway.  You are in luck, there is a Dark Magician Girl in the line     Sadly the only one. I meant more like yugi or any of the other "main characters", I would also give a lot for arc v characters. Or dark magician to go with dark magician girl.

I'll be posting summaries and dumping pics. This is my first time doing a summary, so I wasn't really sure what was fine to omit and wasn't, so if you have any questions or anything to add, please do so.

As long as Aki-kun grips on tight, we'll be fine.           Forgot pic.      can't do much about it.   *it can't be helped     Thanks for doing a summary. I look forward to seeing what this volume is about.       Prologue   The novel starts with Tomoya, Michiru, and Izumi gathered in his room to celebrate the creation of their new circle. Michiru questions Tomoya on the state of the circle now that Eriri and Utaha have left. Tomoya doesn’t take being reminded of the two leaving very well, but Izumi reassures Tomoya by saying that she won’t let the circle die. The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her. Tomoya panics and tells her to stop making her character develop like that. Michiru comments that nothing could have been done about the two leaving. When Tomoya asks why, she responds by saying that the two had lost the fight for survival within the circle. At that moment, Megumi enters with the drinks, right when Michiru explains that Megumi had kicked the two out of the circle, using an analogy of someone’s wife delivering punishment. Megumi is displeased and tells them to stop making her seem like someone so mean, but everyone is visibly scared of her. They move on with the party. Megumi encourages Tomoya to do the toast. The prologue ends with everyone shouting kanpai.     Chapter 1   Tomoya is talking with his classmate Yoshihiko in the classroom. When he asks why Tomoya hasn’t updated his blog in a while, Tomoya says that he’s busy. Eriri comes over, greets them, and sits down. Yoshihiko tries to ask Tomoya if there is really nothing between him and Eriri, but he dodges the questions. Tomoya reminisces about how rumors had started after he and Eriri started regularly going to school together after winter comiket. He also comments how more rumors started when they seemed more distant to each other after spring break. Tomoya’s phone rings, and it turns out that Eriri had just messaged him about how his new game is coming along. He responds that things are going well, but Eriri doesn’t like his tone. She questions if he’s still holding a grudge. The conversation gets heated to the point where Eriri stops texting and just asks him out loud what was up with what happened between him and Utaha at the train station. There’s a bit of an awkward silence. After class, Eriri apologizes to Tomoya. Izumi shows up in the classroom with two of her classmates who want to join the circle. Eriri is against them joining, saying that amateurs and non-otaku shouldn’t join. Izumi counters by saying that Tomoya was an amateur at first too, and the two classmates reveal that they watch anime too. Eriri can’t think of anything else to say, so she storms out of the classroom while Tomoya takes the two classmates away to explain the circle. She meets Megumi as she exits. They have an awkward greeting and soon go their separate ways.        Yoshihiko   I miss that guy      Chapter 2   Tomoya meets Utaha as he leaves the school. She has him accompany her to a café. They talk about college, which Utaha says that she hasn’t gone to since it’s just orientation, and about the two classmates, who Utaha guesses didn’t join because Tomoya was overenthusiastic and scared them away. She turns out to be right on that one, and Tomoya. Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside. Tomoya asks her not to joke about that because he’s been worrying about that too. Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react. She considers calling her on the phone right there, but Tomoya stops her exclaiming that it’s rude to call people in the middle of conversation. Next, Tomoya asks how Utaha’s work is coming along with Field’s Chronicle. She responds, “How should I answer? If I said that now was the most fulfilling part of my life in the passionate way you always speak, what would you do?” Tomoya says that he would wait in line in excitement for the game, which Utaha compares to NTR. They leave the café and talk as they walk while holding hands. Utaha encourages him to work hard for his circle, to which Tomoya replies that he’ll do his best and that one day they should gather together to discuss how their work is coming along.   (There were a lot of dirty jokes this chapter, and Tomoya notices that Utaha has been making more than usual, but some have been omitted because it would be way too long otherwise)     Were you somehow inspired by Spyro?    Chapter 3    Tomoya and Megumi are planning the schedule for the circle. Megumi is worried that the schedule might be too hard, but Tomoya reassures her that they have last year’s experience. She replies with how they had scheduling troubles even with Utaha and that artist by their side. Tomoya asks her why she properly referred to Utaha by name but not Eriri. Megumi is silent for a while before replying that it was just a mistake. Tomoya replies that there’s no way that’s the case because when she’s quiet like that for more than five seconds she’s scary. She explains that she never understood why Eriri quit the circle. Tomoya answers that doing so is probably just in a creator’s nature, though even he admits to not understanding what exactly that is. Their conversation is interrupted by Michiru, who turns out to have been there for a while and was just ignored. Megumi decides to go on a break while Michiru talks to Tomoya about how she wants him to set up more concerts and help make a CD. She pushes him down on the bed and begs him to help, but Megumi walks in on them. The scene shifts to them discussing who does what in the circle. Tomoya has too many roles and needs to quit some of them. Midway through discussing, Megumi falls asleep from exhaustion. When she wakes up, Michiru and Tomoya are playing a visual novel, with Michiru begging him to stop. The game turned out to be really awful. Michiru falls asleep on the bed while Megumi takes her turn at the game. Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.     Chapter 4   Tomoya goes over to Izumi’s house. He has her look at the plans for the game and asks for her opinion. Instead of answering, Izumi asks him to leave her room. He goes to the living room where he has Iori look over the plans. Iori comments that it puts a lot of pressure on the artist since she has to match up to Eriri but also remarks that that’s probably not the reason Izumi had Tomoya leave. Izumi calls Tomoya back to her room to show her sketches of Meguri that she had drawn based off the plans. There were three sketches, one in Eriri’s style, one in her own style, and one that looked like Megumi. Tomoya also notices that scattered all around the room are other sketches of Meguri, with varying hairstyles and expressions, and thinks that these are all a hundred percent Meguri. Tomoya asks her if she’ll do the drawings, but she’s confused since she thought the whole point of the meeting was to fix the character design. Later, as Iori accompanies Tomoya to the station, he advises Tomoya to finish the sub-heroines first since he’d lose all motivation to write after finishing the main heroine.     Chapter 5   Eriri calls Tomoya on Skype asking if Megumi is in the room. He answers no and asks if she still hasn’t made up with Megumi yet. Seeing that she hasn’t, he recommends that she do it soon. Eriri asks him for help, but he refuses, saying that Megumi is scary when she’s angry. He tells her to face Megumi and talk to her seriously by herself. Their Skype conversation moves to Eriri venting about her coworkers and how hard her work is to Tomoya. When the conversation shifts to Tomoya talking about how good Izumi’s character design was, Eriri isn’t very enthusiastic. Tomoya asks if she’s still scared of Izumi, she says that you don’t suddenly grow just because you become a pro. Tomoya reassures her by saying that she’s grown a lot the past few months. That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.      Utaha asks how Megumi is doing and says that Tomoya should keep an eye on her since, despite her appearance, she is actually quite dark inside.   Oh man, her dark vindictive side is still there.      For a moment there I read Saikano. Then I remmebered Saikano. Then I got depressed.      Chapter 6   Tomoya and Megumi meet Iori at the café and have him look at the revised plan for the game since Tomoya wants him to be the manager of the circle. After looking at the plan, Iori refuses, saying that it won’t sell. When Tomoya asks him what he should do to fix that, Iori responds by saying that he has no idea. Megumi interrupts the conversation and says that what Iori is doing isn’t fair because he hasn’t given a reason why it won’t sell. Tomoya says that it’s fine and that they’ll go back and fix the plan. After setting up what day to meet with him again, Tomoya leaves, but Iori comments that Megumi is heavy. It turns out that she had fallen asleep.     Chapter 7   Tomoya and Megumi are having dinner at his house. Megumi has some doubts about whether they can trust Iori on this one, but Tomoya reassures her that when it comes to knowing whether or not something will sell, he is no match for him. They move on to fixing the plan. Several hours pass. Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience. Tomoya claims no recollection for something like that. They keep working until two at night, but they still haven’t found anything wrong. They decide to go to sleep for the day. After waking up and eating breakfast, they continue to work but still have no idea. Megumi comments that all the heroines are done so well that it’s impossible to even tell who the main one is anymore which causes Tomoya to realize what’s wrong with the plan.     Chapter 8   Tomoya and Megumi are at the café with Iori. He congratulates them on realizing what was wrong and agrees to be the manager. Once everything is over, both pass out from exhaustion in the café. Later, Tomoya tells Megumi that they should go on a date to gather data for the Meguri route. Megumi suggests going to an amusement park, but Tomoya says no, the reason being that he had already been there for research for the previous game (in his mind, he adds that he went with Eriri). Eventually they settle for Rokutenba Mall. Like the previous time, they plan out what shops they are going to go to first. After shopping a bit, they get to the part with the escalator and the crowd. Just like last time, they hold hands to get through it. They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories. She offers buying chains, a leather jacket, and nose piercings for an image change instead, to which Tomoya responds, “What kind of boyfriend are you trying to raise, main heroine!?” The scene switches to them at the food court. Megumi tells Tomoya about the time she met Eriri at the mall and how it sparked their friendship. Her face turns sad as she remembers how their friendship was broken. Seeing that, Tomoya asks if he should set the two up so that they could rebuild their friendship. Megumi responds by saying that it would be wrong to request that of Tomoya, but if Eriri is okay with it, then she’ll do it. Two hours pass, and they’re walking back home. Megumi decides to play the main heroine again and asks him to turn on the recorder.   (I’ll just translate the rest of the chapter and put it along the picture)     Rest of chapter 8   “I guess I’ll play the main heroine one last time.”   “Katou…?”   Just as were about to reach the top of the hill…   “Just for now, can you turn off the recorder?”   “Huh, why?”   After giving that strange request, she ran past me with a light dash and gazed back at me with a warm look, although, in truth, the evening sun made it so that I couldn’t really tell what expression she had.    “Hey, Aki-kun…no, Tomoya-kun.”   Even so, that voice and those words were enough to put that image in my mind.    “Do you remember? It’s been exactly a year since then.”   “Katou…”   Of course I remember. That was when I was fruitlessly racking my brain for ideas on the plot.    “Am I closer to the heroine of your story than I was a year ago?”   Back then, Katou was supposed to be at Hokkaido, but, unable to just stand by and watch me struggle, she prioritized me over her family and came back.    “Am I someone dependable?”   You were already someone dependable.    “And do you remember what happened about a month ago?”   “Hey, wait…”   Well…even if I wanted to forget, I couldn’t. After all, I was sobbing my eyes out right in front of Katou.    “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.                            everyone is scared of Megumi   I like the smell of drama in the making.     “As long as Katou…”   Today, Katou really was just like a jack-in-the box. She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome…   “…as long as Megumi is here, I feel like we’ll make it through, somehow.”   …and to top it all off, someone I could always rely on.    “So let’s make sure to have a great time. Let’s cough up blood together.”   It was a good thing the recorder was stopped. I don’t think I could hear such embarrassing lines again.    “Let’s give our best together, Tomoya-kun.”   “Uhh…”   “Together, with everyone else, we’ll make the best game ever, right?”   “Uhh…!”   Why did I stop the recorder? I’m an idiot.             I love you OP.   Iori actually asked if Megumi was depressed and hearing that, Megumi's eyes turned lifeless.    Epilogue   #1 Eriri and Tomoya are on skype. She is shocked that Iori joined the circle. After a few exchanges on how surprising that is, the conversation moves to Eriri being overworked. She complains how they pile one character after another. A bit later, Tomoya tells Eriri that she’ll have her meet Megumi sometime next week. As the conversation ends, he remarks to himself that he has to do something about his habit of calling Megumi by her first name since he nearly let it slip several times talking to Eriri.   #2 Tomoya and Utaha are on the phone. He tells her that the circle will be watching the livestream of the game she and Eriri are working on. Hearing that, Utaha tells him that the Eriri now is not the one he knew before and that he should try not to make enemies with her. She also says that she wants him, Izumi, and Megumi to accept Eriri as she is now.  #3 The circle watches the livestream. After flashing the characters of the game, it turns out that all the pictures shown in the preview come together to form one giant picture. Everyone in the circle is shocked to see such a great picture from Eriri. Izumi is visibly scared to compete with someone like that, and Megumi slips back to calling Tomoya “Aki-kun.” Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.      not a single illustration of Utaha, not even in the cover or inlays  LELOUCH BTFO    Lelouch isn't even aware this is based on a LN.   OP you are da real MVP    Okay, thanks. I thought he was literally calling her heavy.      What are you smoking?     Megumi best girl. Tomoya agrees, don't bother him about it.     Caring about Lelouch   Unable to read  I can't tell which one makes you more retarded.     Will Tomoya be able to reverse this yandere in the making before it's too late?   Afterword:   Nothing really important beyond Maruto himself being surprised at how much screentime Megumi had this volume and dispelling rumors that Saekano was a split cour from the start (it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations).    That's all. Thanks everyone for reading my shitty prose and summaries that have probably left out one too many things.      Really really thank you, OP.     I know that he's the Yahariguy, but I don't visit the threads enough to see him.      Every volume needs tons of Megumi screen time.    How many volumes where adapted in the anime?    You know, the real bad thing that happened to Utaha was how irrelevant she became. Volume 8 highlighted it by making pretty every other line of hers a dirty joke because that's all she's good for at this point.     I never lost faith. Eriri is still the best.    That was the decision Utaha made in GS anyway.    Thank you for the summary, bro.   it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations   The series was literally blessed by a goddess.        For a moment I thought I was reading a translation of the chinks' summary for some reason.     tfw Izumi is more relevant than her now    Thanks, OP. You're alright.    The conversation takes a darker turn when Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her.    Tomoya will have to deal with two yanderes in the circle.     So yeah, if it wasn't obvious enough before, we're totally stuck on the Megumi route now. They're like a married couple at this point, they just need to realize it.   That's what Maruto promised.    The worst thing happened this volume to be honest. Megumi is still good but nowhere nearly as interesting as she was before.   Thanks OP. though I'm disappointed how MC just shrugged off the betrayal of those two bitches. At least be mad!  Maruto creates good plot and stories but crappy MCs. Tomoya is much worse than the WA2 MC.     The others never really stood a chance.     I dunno, I don't think she's changed so much as we're just seeing sides of her that we didn't before. Nothing before Volume 6 really made her mad, and there were the other heroines who took screentime away from her.      He's still a bit mad, at least to Eriri. He admits to still holding a grudge at the end of Chapter 5. The outburst in the classroom also made it pretty clear.     Why is the author surprised that megumi has a lot of screentime in this volume? Didn't he intended it to be this way?   Megumi is like spending days at his house at a time now      One and only.       He didn't.     I think it's like you don't realize the impact of something until you reread it.      She's the rival now. That means she'll be crushed someday.     Which actually made her really boring for me.    Thank god. MC is more human.   What does utaha mean that she was tomoya's first?    Kiss. Tomoya and Megumi are going to have a romantic moment, she'll ask if she's her first, Tomoya will awkwardly say no, and the mood will be ruined.     It feels that the author made her the winner way too early. However this is Maruto we're talking about, and probably this won't last much.   I'm fine with any development as long as Eriri doesn't take her place again.        Eriri got insanely close in volume 6. If it wasn't for her own stupidity, she would have won.     What volume and chapter did that happen?    Tomoya just says he and Eriri have gone back to their old ways.     Tomoya thanks her for working so hard but reminds her that, in the end, it’s just a game.  What the fuck has happened to Tomoya?     She'll losr because she isn't the destined main girl. But it doesn't mean one can't enjoy her shining brightly regardless.     Volume 7, epilogue. It's been spoiled in pretty much every thread since Saekano first aired.     It's just a game m8.     Megumi asks the event where the heroine sees the MC off with a smile when he ditches her on a date for another girl but then gets angry once he’s gone is original or based on an experience.   So Tomoya completely forgot that he ditched Megumi?        receive special treatment from MC   mend damaged relationship after years of being on bad terms   a volume later, shoot yourself in the foot and return back to square one again   Bravo Eriri, bravo.        Wait, why is any girl besides Utaha expected to win if she's both kissed the MC and is holding hands with him?  Eriri won. Utah went to college somewhere Kato is pissed at aki.  Basically sums up the ending here, boys       Poor Utaha is just grasping at straws at this point.     Her response was something like "...oh it's nothing, it must just be my imagination" but it was implied that she was a bit angry given the sarcastic tone.      Megumi is regularly staying the night at his house and makes him dinner.      They reach the glasses shop, and Megumi suggests buying a new item to commemorate their date since the last one got taken by Eriri. Tomoya is against it because it’s too much like a yandere overwriting memories.     The only thing Eriri will win is a consolation prize.    Yes, but their relationship seems very platonic    Showing Megumi's dark tendencies is like the point of vol 8.    Eriri will always be the best friend/staff Utaha will be always the idolized author nothing else. Itoko will always be Itoko Kouhai will always be the kouhai.  Megumi will always be the heroine.   Simple as that. Your generic tsundere will never win.          has any1 played the psvita game?    platonic   This entire volume is literally the beginning of a yandere possessive Megumi      Until I see a knife smeared with blood being held by megumi, I refuse to believe she's a yandere    It's shit.     It's quite funny, her dark side was initially blamed on her long hair, but she feels even more fearsome with short hair.      Izumi talks about how she’ll make Tomoya forget about Eriri and eliminate her     did they start going out ? I dont remember that    "It can't be helped since unlike VNs, LNs can only have one ending." - Maruto   So in white album 2 terms  Tomoya = Haruki Megumi = Ogiso Eriri = Kazusa  who won again there?         Not like she has any chance anyway.    VN =/= LN     No, the hand holding is just fanservice to please Utahafags who don't want to admit that their character is irrelevant now.     Maruto said he won't let another Setsuna happen so Megumi is pretty guaranteed to win.    Then what's this    Utaha then asks Tomoya if he’s told Megumi that Utaha was his first and wonders how Megumi would react      Why is everyone so scared of Megumi again?  Really the only characters that make sense to feel that way are Tomoya and Eriri.      My memory of White Album 2 is rusty, what does another Setsuna mean again?     That's mostly because she's depressed.     “Right now, I don’t have Eriri or Kasumigaoka-senpai with me anymore…”   Katou continued to talk to me in a tender, unchanging voice.    “Even so, am I still able to cheer you up?”   I wasn’t sure if I could get any more embarrassed.    “Am I someone needed by you and the circle?”   She kept on being my ideal heroine.   How can anyone think Megumi won't be the winner?           This is understandable. Maruto made Setsuna so unique and I guess he always thought of making her the winner. But the fans preferred Kazusa. It's like aquaplus forced him/her to make Kazusa the winner.    Is ponytail safe?     It was explained already, it just means kiss. It was part of the dirty joke since she said it out loud in the cafe.     Rinri-kun, have you seen Sawamura-san like this?  Have you ever seen her burning her life and enjoying drawing like this? You have probably never seen it... Because, had you known that she could be like this, Then you wouldn't have such insolent thoughts as to 'protect her'.   Ahh, really, what a waste.  And, I'm really glad. If you had seen her right now, You will surely fall in love with her again, and know the despair of not being able to reach her with that love.  Utaha's monologue in GS suggested Tomoya would fall for Eriri again after seeing her art. What happened?              It takes an Eririfag in denial to believe that.    There's a difference between ideal heroine and someone you actually want to be with.    Utaha will always be the teasing perverted character with the hot body and nothing else.  She was doomed from the start.    Jokes on you, Maruto intended Megumi as his redemption on Setsuna. It reflected on Tomoya's words in vol 2    Izumi so good, good thing she is my second favorite    He didn't see it at that precise moment.    I think the visually scared part is a gag scene    Anon, your analogy is really really bad. You compare romance drama and romance harem.     Tomoya is scared because of what happened at the auditorium in volume 7. As for everyone else, I think it's the aura she projects. Like, there's a scary silence.      What happened?  Eriri happened. I don't think I've ever seen another heroine as incompetent as Eriri.     Holy fuck I screwed up the green text so much    That's where she realized it's not about improving her art/skills after all. Even if she wanted to go back. The damage has already been done.     I don't see why Megumi can't be both.    basically a heroine that suffered endlessly in basically all routes, even the routes where she wins she suffers the most    why? Both were works of the same author and we are obviously going on the same route. Betrayal, ruining friendships and etc.    Best girl man    Both heroines won. It just that, narratively Kazusa end is more prominent in presence.   Utah's is the most genuine. All other girls are manipulative and fake.   the person in the middle here is setsuna     Both heroines won.  Yeah, no.    Is Megume slowly becoming Yandere or something?  Everyone is "scared of her"   Megumis "dark side"   That manipulative tone   Are all these things just things that are hard to translate and therefore something gets lost in the translation or is she going to kill Utaha, Eiri, Izumi and Michiru at the end of the LN?        wow this + handholding, and people say Utaha is non-existent now ?    Yeah I feel like she's the one far ahead of the other girls.    it's her character, anon-kun. those types never wins in a harem plot like this. It's always the long haired tsundere with no tits that always wins.     She realized after that. Even referencing Kazusa coming back in CC. It is all about improving her skill though.    What is Monogatari? Utaha is basically discount Senjougahara.    I don't think Maruto is boring enough of a writer to go for another WA2.    It was pretty bad, man. Setsuna never achieved her true happiness. Even in her "good" ending.  Worse, another girl will share the same fate as hers in another series.       It's more like she's someone you don't want to piss off. As long as you don't do something stupid, she's a perfectly nice girl.     was rooting for her until betrayal, now yandere the best.    Except she's the most mature one. Those never wins. She's the staple foxy mature girl.     She's 腹黑, a trait that would normally be associated with characters like Utaha, but not really ヤンデレ.    Don't reply to Yahari memecartel   I still can't figure out why /a/ likes Saekano.  When I watched it all it was was flagrant otaku pandering and fanservice. Not very interesting at all.     She gets pissed off quite easily now though.    Utaha reminds me a lot of yukinon from yahari and senj from monogatri. I think they are all considered kuuderes. Probably one of my favourite character type     /a/ is one person   Try mentioning saekano in a thread outside of this one      You mean eriri?   But that's his style. And it's heading that route.      Its going to be really hard to ever top Setsuna in the suffering heroine department.  Wataru is trying, but I doubt he would go as far as the CC Touma normal/true routes     Man I like how Tomoya is rather cool at handling Eriri and Utaha. It really shows that while he understands them he still has some troubles with them leaving the circle.   The anime adapted the worst parts of the novels so yeah.    Except that WA2 MC had loved Touma all the way through    Yeah no Maruto has done more things than just WA2 man.     She was flat, fun to hang out with, someone who didn’t even feel like the opposite gender. She had a sharp tongue, a dark side, yet she was also someone dear and sweet. She was delicate, sly, troublesome  MCs own words.     5 volumes where every scene is essential to the plot to a 12 episode anime is never a great idea.     You'll just get a bunch of "Megumi a best." It's all Saekano is known for. She really is the star of the show.      You know a show is bad when a girl like Megumi, whose main selling point is that she has no redeeming qualities, is the best.     Tomoya LOVED Eriri.    4 volumes actually and they weren't that good either.     it got a S2 because it surpassed expectations  And we all know who to thank for that.      Yeah, WA2 is an exception than a rule.     Sounds like he thinks if her as a friend, rather than romantically.     main selling point is that she has no redeeming qualities   I think you completely misunderstood this series.      They skipped Eriri's introduciton to Megumi and just introduced Utah and Eriri all together in the cafe.     Tomoya notes that Megumi’s voice had the sadness and pain of being left behind by a best friend along with the frustration of not being understood by that friend.   Catfight incoming?      She'll lose because she is a retard.    You don't get it. He never got over his love for Touma, but Tomoya has got over his love for Eriri    The otakufags who buy this shit?    Yeah it will probably be a major plot point from now on. How well or bad it goes down will seal Megumi and Eriri's fate.    Megumi X Eriri end confirmed    It's     You talking about me?     I think they did a great job adapting though. It didn't feel rushed or anything. Maruto has talent in anime, WA2 and Saekano are amazing.     Eririfags.    She's more than a friend to him though.     I still can't figure out why /a/ likes Saekano     Thank you for the summary. And well as an Utahafag there wasn't that much for me, but I still like it I hope Izumi beats eriri, as she is my second favorite      That's not the point.    This is gonna be some forced drama if it doesn't get resolved next volume.   Tomoya already said he set up a time for Megumi and Eriri to meet next week       Am I supposed to find these girls attractive?   Because I don't.       Saekano anime is not good at all.    Point is he loved Eriri like Haruki loves Kazusa. Which makes Eriri = Kazusa and Megumi = Ogiso. But Maruto said he won't let another Setsuna happen again. You do the math. But this is just my opinion.       A stubborn retard at that.    Have some ninjas then.    Saekano threads really could do without the whole WA2 thing.    You only have your own homosexuality to blame.     The anime could use better designs, but the LN is absolutely gorgeous.     It was not rushed but like the yahari anime only the important plots are included. The introdutions became flashbacks so much it was irritating.     It used to be   Saekano? You mean the guy who did White Album 2?   Now it's   White Album 2? You mean the guy who did Saekano?   Oh how the tables have changed.             At least the comparison makes sense here. Yahari threads can get aggravating with WA2.     not finding this attractive  That sounds like a personal problem to me anon, you might need to do some serious soul searching.     do you expect me to be able to read these kanji you nerd.    Still waiting on Taiyou no Ko.     I don't find Megumi attractive because I think Eriri is better.  That doesn't make me a homosexual.     Absolutely.   I wonder when Tomoya will find it strange that Megumi is at his house and making them dinner all the time   You may not be gay, but your shit taste still remains intact.     I don't find Megumi attractive because I think Eriri is better     He already does.    Welcome aboard brother!    Based Kurehito.     finding Eriri more attractive than Megumi  Preferences are preferences and all that, but I'm still kind of confused. Since you seem like one of the less toxic Eririfags mind explaining what exacltly makes her so attractive to you?  Personally I thought her design and personality somewhat generic, but that might just me getting really tired of the twin-tailed blond tsundere archetype.       As in typical MC's denseness or he finds it uncomfortable?     DFC twintails is a superior combination, tsundere notwithstanding.     He's probably like "This would be a flag event with any other girl"    and that's why she needs to lose, she had her chance she blew it now just waiting to see her suffer more    That cheers Eriri up, and she asks him if he thinks her drawings are better than Izumi’s. As the circle representative, Tomoya refuses to comment. The conversation ends with Tomoya leaving since he has to get back to work.  I thought Eriri was a professional now? How can she still be making shit comments like these?      She's still immature. Also read GS.     Eriri said it herself. You don't suddenly grow just because you're a pro.     manga spin-off ?     LN side story. Have fun.     Vol 7.5 really. Eriri went to Akane to improve her skills so she could keep her promise (draw better than everyone else) to Tomoya.    It pisses me off more how she was trying to stop Izumi's friends from joining Tomoya's circle. She's not even a member anymore and she should feel ashamed of forcing her shit views on things unrelated to her.    Having amateurs join the circle now is not a very good idea.    Not to mention that this leaves no room for the pathetic "baaawwww my girl should have won" bitching and moaning I see in every series where a girl like Eriri loses.    Implying Eriri was concerned about the circle.    That's not the point. She gets mad and storms out of the room.    Wait, are they going out? When did the started?    Nekofags can keep crying.    Nope and never. Read the whole thing before posting.     She gets mad and storms out of the room  Sums up her character pretty well.      You must be terrible at interacting with girls.     There was a girl who would always link arms with me while walking. I confessed to her.  Never again.      Kannafags, Minamifags, Sanafags, Zessicafags, Noefags and soon  Misakafags  too.    She was more concerned about the girls in her own way. She and Tomoya were both surprised to learn that the two girls openly admit they are otaku as well.   Izumi put her on the spot really. Tomoya was actually happy that he's seeing Eriri acting more honest though. But whatever, the summary is biased anyway.       Don't forget Yuifags.    It's more about who's saying those words. She abandoned the circle and still feels entitled to it in some way despite all the trouble she caused.    So tell me something, they replaced blessing software's artist?  How will that come across in the anime? Because Eriri's art was done by the novel artist, right? So they'll have to find someone else to do this new girl's drawings?       Eririfag   T-the summary was biased guys   Nah dude, she's just a shit       The anime probably won't get past volume 7. It's the perfect place to end it anyway.     the summary is biased anyway  0/10 Eririfags confirmed for coming from the bizarro dimension     Irohafags   I hope Megumi and Tomoya calling each other by their first names isn't a one time thing   That's why she asked Izumi if she would really drag her friends into this mess.     Considering how consistent the sales have been, I think they seriously might do more than a season 2.      the summary was biased   basing his evidence on the "biased" summary  Confirmation bias at its finest, I expected no less from Eririfags.      Season 2 up to Volume 7 with Volume 8 released as an OVA bundled with the BDs.  Make it happen Japan.      You know you might as well get yourself a trip denialfag. You do a pretty shit job of making yourself none recognizable.   I guess your retardation is just that pungent.    I was pretty surprised how well it did to be honest. Not that I'm complaining, but Saekano wasn't exactly all that mind blowing in my opinion.         I hope they call their first names in front of Eriri next volume.    I'd be more interested than a season 3 at that point. Volume 8 is just a set up volume     Volume 8 wouldn't work as an OVA since it ends on a cliffhanger. I'd prefer they just animate everything in a couple seasons. Like fuck, DxD got so many seasons, we deserve some too.    I wish someone would upload the rest of the CGs so I can get rid of these shitty youtube screenshots   At least she got told by Izumi.     Volume 8 wouldn't work as an OVA since it ends on a cliffhanger  Implying it's a problem.       What the fuck man, I'm not that guy In fact I was thinking of writing Yukinofags too      Aniplex seems to have taken a liking to Saekano. Like, holy shit, it got a S2 just a month after it ended, and it wasn't even a split cour.     But Yukino will (unfortunately) win.         In fact I was thinking of writing Yukinofags too  I believe you, but that is really not helping your case anon. The denialfag is a Yuifag after-all.     But I'm a Harunofag   Is this a horse?  I WANT TO KILL THIS FUCKING CUNT. SRSLY :(  I want to kill this fucking cunt.    tfw you don't know if your ship has sunk for good or is looking great, because translators have different takes on that spoon scene.  Also, one more day until the BTB threads days are numbered.  Shitposting OP, stop it.               No, that's a shit and worst girl. Yuckyno A SHIT.    why the fuck do you post this in every thread?    Fuck you man     So, Yui is the hero the Service Club deserves.    Brothers?   Spyro finally started, yay!     1/3   All this proves is that Yui is a selfish cunt.    2/3     All this proves is that you are a complete idiot.     Now that's alpha.    Fuck of falseflagger    Yukino loves 8man   Yui loves 8man   Yui and Yukino are best friends   8man is romantically stunted  This sounds like a huge plot point going forward. This will impact their relationship a lot.       3/3     you will never have your own coma cheese       Try to hog too many things at once and they all fall off from your grasp.     Yui   character who's chronically unable to assert her own wants over those of the group   finally decides to stand up for herself   selfish cunt   We've been through this dance already with Yukino between the election and genuine speech, so how about you get          She is the hero they need.    Komachi is scary, too scary. Yui and Yukino look more concerned than taken aback.       Yeah, that fish is big   - If there would be no refuge, it wouldn't find its own place... Always hiding, going with the flow, sticking with something... And hitting an invisible wall   - Which fish?   - It's about myself   I like this bit a lot. Seems like Yukino is finally coming to terms with what she wants to do; she was a lost fish but now that she has Hachiman and Yui, it seems like she finally found a home of some sort and will stop going with the flow   Makes me think Yukino is going away for a period of time; if so, then it means that she is not going to follow anybody's footsteps.             MAX 300 coffee  I would drink the shit out of that DDR used to be my fucking game.       Yukino is going away for a period of time   Literally White album 2 Watari is a hack      No Iroha allowed below this line   -----------------------------------<wbr>-----------------------------</wbr>      So will Yui get cucked?    That's not nice.   Good Irohasu, everyone!  How do I stop this underclassman from being so sly?     kinda surprising she admitted it. I figured that was going to be a big source of conflict later on.       Responsibility  [ ] Take [ ] Leave      Not if Watari doesn't want his best friend to sue him for plagiarism.    Do you want a boring thread? Because that's how you get one.   Now that we know that Yukino/Yui are going to go for the 8 how would they respond to another girl going for him?     cockblock.   We dont care about losing/winning.  She has enough points. She will just NTR 8man, when he meet his kouhai again, after the time skip     You're not alone brother.    I wouldn't do anything that I'd have to take responsibility for. Not when I've got to hurry home to my gorgeous bun-headed ray of sunshine and cook dinner for her.    Best girl is best    What kind of life do you live that leads you to fantasize about living a normal life?   All girls other than Komachi are complete shit.   This is a well known fact within both the scientific and literary communities.   You cannot debate me on this. It is indisputable.       He's just come home after banged his kouhai    Irohabro shop owner says no.   Irohasu~   Thanks, brethren.    80% of pixiv is Yui     Is she softer than Yukino?  I want to use cocytus on Iroha   Spoilers for borderline blogshit  One where I wasted most of a decade of my life dicking around, so now what's most appealing to me is peace, stability, and the love of a kind and beautiful wife.     Fuck Iroha, Yukinon 4 life.  Why are Hiratsuka and Sensei the only ones that look like actual brides.   Probably more bouncy. Soft is hard to say.   Yui deserves to win and should, iroha is pretty fun, saki is great, Yumiko a best and yukino is a bitch. Have a nice thread guys   use that on your Onisama. Dont touch our goddess or she will NTR you     get home and cook dinner for her.   anon what is wrong with you, is it happy marrying a  vase ?       Hiratsuka and Sensei   You need to sleep, m8.     Alpha &amp; Beta    Made for titty-fucking     Iroha is the second biggest 8+Y shipper after Komachi though, no way she'd ruin all her hard work baiting one of them into finally taking the 8bowl.   Who would be a great trophy wife?   I wish she had heels on during the series instead of boots. Heels look a lot better on her anyways.     two right feet  Jesus Christ.     Give us your definition of "trophy wife" first.    Haruno. She certainly wouldn't be a good wife in any other respect.     yumiko has 2 left feet  Why, just why.    Irohasu!  8man should 8 both the girls against their will and see which one he likes better.   that's why Hayama won't fuck her    I'm gonna miss you captain. IROHA OR DEATH    What sort of position is 8?     I never noticed that, wow. Artist fuck up I guess      You have eccentric taste.      can't fucking unsee  Th-thanks anons.          I want the Irohafags to leave, you got your romantic moment translated already so please leave us alone to discuss the drama.   They wear a strap-on and fuck him in the ass.    In Japan? Yumiko. She's blonde. And very, very cute.    Sticking his 8 in them, typically via behing or missionary.    Eccentric how?    I fucking love cooking, Alton Brown is one of my idols. Yui's meme-flaw is a flat out win for me, since I don't mind the extra work and I'd get to play teacher in her efforts to not be a failure in the kitchen.    I'm trying to imagine a blonde Japanese woman being sexier than simple black hair. I just can't see it.  The only reason Yumiko looks cute with blonde hair is because she looks white.     At this point I'm okay with anyone but the spoiled rich brat bitch winning.   And the kind of girl who will be nothing outside of highschool. Her days are numbered, soon she'll just be some random pretty girl.     what the hell does a vase have to do with marrying Yui?     You underestimate how far in life being pretty will get you   間接キス!     I can't help it, she's on my mind.    Go watch Japanes Propaganda : The anime You'd like it.  Danna ga Nani wo Itteiru ka Wakaranai Ken       At least you've clearly got your priorities straight.     I don't know actually; it's more of a vague feeling.  Yui &gt; Orimoto &gt; Miura &gt; * &gt; Yukino = Iroha = Haruno here.      Yui wont suffer r-right?   Nice quads, male sibling.   1/8  EITHER GIRL EXCEPT IROHA OR DEATH  Who do you think schlicks to 8man? Yui and sensei only?   Not remotely, memeposter sir.    I just fantasized about sitting in a room reading a book while Yukino does the same thing.   This makes no sense. There's literally no interaction, why is it so appealing?      2/8    saki    If you switched orimoto and iroha id be a pretty big fan of your taste, other than yumiko not being best    IROHA    3/8     quiet   peaceful   no awkward silence (at least if you're 8man)   reading is awesome   she probably smells nice        Where are the fake spoilers?   remember cake belongs in the top of the food group.    4/8    That's my nigga       don't need this heartboner right now man.      SAY YES      tfw when you'll never get to teach Yui MD and TD     At least we have a genuine understanding.         Heh, I didn't realise it. Great.  Thanks for telling me. Have a Saki.      There are couples who read books together you know. Whatever works best.    good    5/8    AH FUCK HIS PHONE WILL BE CONFISCATED  CONTRABAND  WEEKEND PASSES REVOKED         meme-flaw     6/8     Self-insert doujin  That's why Yuifag not GENUINE     7/8     Anon's right though.   KONICHIWA I'M BUSTY OPPAI-CHAN ALL FRIENDLY AND SWEET, B-BUT I CAN'T COOK!  It's a common form in Bengali cartoons.        Wait, how is Valentine's Day not over? Isn't every volume supposed to be a month apart?  The thought of Iroha somehow getting 8man alone and giving him some kind of Valentine gift is pretty exciting.      8/8    You've read my mind.     8man carrying iroha's bags even in yui's doujins   it's over my negroes      That's just an assumption, we don't know when the volume ended. V-day is probably over, though.     Goddamn meme trash. Typical of Vietnamese mobile paintings.    as expected of non-yuifags not understanding genuine.    Here, fixed for you  Iroha= Haruno &gt;Orimoto&gt;Yui&gt;Miura&gt;Yukino      More translated fanart here!    http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B       WHO IN THE FUCK KEEPS THEIR HAIR IN A BUN WHILE WASHING IT    Retarded people, that's who.     (  Gahamama - that's what 8man call yui's mom in Vol11      meme as an adjective  I wonder, when did you fucks get this fucking stupid?   Why the does it always seem like only Yui shit gets TL'd?         Jesus, I don't know where to begin with you.     switch Miura and Yui and I'll take it     only Yui shit gets TL'd  Yui shit as in only her bad doujins or as in only Yui's doujins?      because she's the best girl    What's going to happen in the next episode?   I feel so sorry for Sakifriends. It's never going to happen, even though it wouldn't be bad if it did     ALL GLORY TO YUMIKO    Highschool teen DRAMA R A M A         Truck     this desperate to pretend Iroha's ship isn't sunk     You got that backwards.    An interesting stance    We will never falter, never give up. If the boat has to sink, I'll be guiding it to the depths of sea myself.     openly flirting with 8man over an indirect kiss   sinking  You what.      Why is Yui such a slut? Look at that cock hungry expression.    I reiterate my previous statement.    Except it's mostly Iroha that gets the translations and typesets done. You really need to lurk more.      yukino over yumiko  get a load of this faglord     I meant things containing Yui tend to get TL'd more then other girls' stuff.   Yeah, her too. They both have 42 images on       Hold up for a second, guys. At what point does Iroha pull out the spoon? Pic related implies that it's in his mouth for the entire conversation (as Iroha touching her lips is before his 2nd answer).   mfw saika comeback from thailand   1/12    implying Yui didn't just sink herself at the end of the volume     They're about even, really.  And Yukino's practically out of the running, since she doesn't seem to have nearly as much fan comic stuff on pixiv.      2/12    But some of those Yui ones are old, like S1 old. Iroha has been getting most of the shit done recently.     every thread  Are people ban-evading, or not getting banned at all?    3/12    Not entirely sure she did but she did try to make Yukino and hachiman speak their minds (I think that was her intent when she was all "If I win I want things to stay the same"  I think she knew what would happen if she said that but she did it to help the other two open up.      The latter.    4/12    mods are surprisingly lenient, i only got warned for saying "JUST CUCK MY SHIT UP" in an annoying manner and haven't shitposted outside of a yahari thread since    5/12   Is Yukino going to win yes or no ?   this is very important.     No mention of that in the translations that we got. But it does seem like he still had the spoon in his mouth just before dropping the flirt bomb on her.     SLUT    Body, face, and personality of a Goddess.    6/12    Yahari threads are most cancerous. What're you expect?    She better, or I'm gonna have to burn a couch.    Probably not. We're going straight into the loner / friendship ending.    She isn't even in love with Hikki. If she was she would have let him kiss her.    No, Watari thinks Japan is ready for a story where second girl wins.   Better polish your couch-burning shoes then.         Wrong pic.    Very likely but anything could happen.    8/12     flat   blind   kuudere   goddess   You need to seek mental help, now.         9/12    i want to see our goddess in Bikini    Closer, but you were still a little off the mark.    All this Yumiko love  You guys are great     kuudere being bad  when has /a/ had better taste?      Watari thinks Japan is ready for a story where second girl wins.  Truly a man ahead of our times     10/12    Since Yuckynon debut      In other words, a hack.        11/12    No matter what Iroha does I feel nothing. Its just too easy to see through how much shes just putting on an act. Any picture I can't just think "hey she's cute" I gotta think, "look at the little she devil planning her shit. Who you putting that cute face on to trick?" 8man may fall for her routine but I won't. I'm not buying that shit.     being this much of an irohafag      first girl doesn't have a romantic development   she wins anyway   author is not a hack   Please, anon.           not writing another cookie cutter LN romance   hack  pick one      We dont know for sure yet. We do know that hayama might like her considering he gave her a trophy during one of his soccer matches in the latest volume.   Will they ever call Hikio by his real name?  Is it true that Iroha raped 8man in vol 11?    "What have I done to deserve this treatment?"     Yes, he was forced to taste Iroha's iroha.  And he liked it      Still doesn't change the fact that Watari or whatever this hack's name is, is in fact, still a hack.    Forced drama   Genuine   Standard romance   Bad fan base  seems pretty standard+            Hold off below for tomorrow   You're asking the impossible, Gahama-san.     Yui is the same as Hayama and friends. She likes being with Yukino and 8man, and fears losing this.    I would pay 15 percent of my paycheck for the rest of my life if they made an anime re-make of Good Eats, that show is so comfy.      not pinching her fat  0/10 shit tier doujinshi     Now that's alpha.    that's some chink joke. Basically it mean you marry some girl just to show off (and having sex while at it).    Here's another, suffer more!    Too bad, you're getting a remake of Good Burger. How does this make you feel?    that would probably elicit a squack from her and would ruin the mood    Seems like something 8man would do.     quick someone draw a pick of Iroha pinning 8man to the floor with his shirt open, chocolate smothered on his chest and her shoving a spoon into his mouth while she licks her chocolate covered fingers saying "Take it all you whore"      Stuff like that is literally what couples who have been together for more than 2 years do.   you run out of shit to say to each other and just enjoy each other's company most of the time, going out on dates when you can but for the most part it's just getting off work and chilling out together on your laptops       Soon (I hope).    implying it wouldn't get her fired up    Ep 13 anime tomorow?   Yes, shitfest incoming and maybe just one more week of BTB threads. Then it's all over.     and  fuck      all over  Nope, LN threads     LN threads don't usually invoke the cancer that this does. And depending on how fast Spyro translates it, threads will be very slow.     Okay so he'd still be a hack, but at least he'd earth some points for originality   So Hayama will win right? him and 8 will run away together and have hatesex   If he wants points for originality, it's best to have the dark horse win. In this case, Iroha.   Are you ready for the movie announcement after ep 13?    as long as it's at least two seasons, I'd be disappointed but optimistic     227 / 82 / 58   I smell a serious case of samefagging.    Get shot, fujoshit    holy shit how are they so gay    I'd settle for a cameo character in Shokugeki   Still pretty happy. Especially if they got kenan and kel to come back for it      Why didn't they look away? Why were their eyes quivering? Why did he focus on her lips? Why did she lean in? Why is did she touch his knee when he is injured?       She's still too distant from the main narrative, it would be too much of an ass pull   Yui is the only girl that deserves to win   The main narrative doesn't have romance in it, it's just the trio trying to figure themselves out and causing drama and suffering in the process. Iroha's side narrative has been nothing but romance, for the better or for the worse.      originality     No, its still probably Yukino's victory in the end. Yui and genuine 3some ending are also possible.   Any other ending wont be possible given the story given how the volume ends      Blushkinon is cute.    she's too dumb for her own good, she doesn't deserve the 8    Meant to say    Any other ending wont be possible in the story given how Vol 11 ends       Shes obviously not that dumb if she got into the school theyre at. Where do people get the idea that shes stupid?    this thread    She's not dumb. She's bad with words.     post imgur folder typeset anon.     By the fact that she constantly demonstrates by being stupid in the LN. I'm not gonna go out and list them all because it would literally be copy-pasting half of the entirety of yui interactions that exist    list the instances where she did something smart or above average intelligence.    she plays up being simple. doesn't mean she's actually retarded. she's not in 8man's or Yukino's league intellectually but that's not to say she lacks potential. She wasted her youth being friends with shallow idiots unlike 8man or Yukino, so she was out having fun instead of being a loner and living vicariously through literature. Makes a big difference.    She outright says she's not very smart in the latest episode preview.    Did Yukinon fall in love with Hikki while I wasn't paying attention?    Romance has always been a thing between the main three, it just got pushed back in the priority list when Watari shifted gears from spice of life to PLOT.  You're also forgetting that the "romance" with Iroha is all one sided right now. 8man doesn't care about her nearly as much as he cares for Yukino and Yui.     Heyyahari bros, I just wanted to get you guys in with the stuff I've been doing for the series that makes things a lot easier and clearer to understand. I suggest going watching the first S1 and take extra attention to the dialogues while you are watching till the end of the first season. Then go and watch S2, but instead go and watch they last episode in reverse to the season opener and watch the rest of s2 backwards. Doing the will make you understand exactly what's going on a whole level.   I did like the way I did it in my discretion but it makes a *million times more sense, if you're a huge fan of the show and LN's.     Have you even seen the latest spoilers? 8man openly flirted back at Iroha.     sup' brother  have some housewife saki        watch s2 backwards  what?     http://pastebin.com/dJas1C5B  Here you go.      Nope it's just the usual Oregairu overhype.  Wowit'snothing.jpg        saki section   good lord, thanks        Yeh watch backwards, instead of 1-12 in or you start with S2e12 and go backwards to you hit ep1 of S2. Pretty is to follow it just every in the show make show much sense     Yes I have and that's s very liberal interpretation of what happened. It also doesn't remotely compare to him baring his soul to the other girls in the last chapter.    She fell for him sometime after they made up.   8man should have pinned down Yukino against her will and do genuine things to her.    can you convince everyone first by explaining your findings by watching it backwards      against her will      liberal   Do you like me putting my saliva in your mouth? Do you think it's sweet?   Yes.   Okay, anon.   baring his soul   implying Iroha isn't searching for genuine with her senpai and made him take responsibility for it.   Open end with VN is my guess anyway.            あざとかわいい is nice and all, but the LN spoilers have made me realize that what I really, really want to see is some あざとえろい.  Please start getting aggressive by the time this is over, Iroha.        implying she wasn't referring to the "jam a spoon in his mouth" appeal  And where did it actually say she had used the same spoon?  Seriously, the Irohafag mental gymnastics are getting so crazy I'm starting to wonder if it's not all one big, well-orchestrated troll.       is that your Genuine?     where did it actually say she used the same spoon  When she tasted it, retard. That's what she was doing, tasting it.  Don't get mad that the two autists in the club don't know how to be romantic.       Oh yeah, 8 did used this "amai" word on others', right? Like when he commented on Miura's advace on Hayama and on Iroha's appeal strike on Hayama.    But that woud take alot of it away fom the experiences    That word can be used as literally sweet, but it also means something to the effect of naive, like you're too pure in your thinking to get your way.    So it's something you just have to see for yourself huh?    We don't care. Tell us.      355 名前：この名無しがすごい！[] 投稿日：2015/06/22(月) 21:15:21.65 ID:/qypC8sW [12/12] いろはすは、アニメでスプーン八幡に突っ込んだけど、 実はその直前自分でそのスプーン使ってたw なぜカットするかね  Try lurking more faggot, and I don't where they mentioned it, maybe in the actual fucking novel?         You got us anon, it's all a big conspiracy where we post fake scans and fake translations then proceed to shitpost about it to death.     ...   tumblr gif  Fuck off trash      At least you admit it, so we'll let it slide this time.     3人でデート行って、甘い時間は終わりとばかりに  最後の3人の今後について考えようと由比ヶ浜から提案する 具体的な話は次巻以降だな   隣の駅には葛西臨海水族園がある   ないな  アニメ部分がもっと甘く表現されてるから、よりうざい  ちなみになんと由比ヶ浜ママも登場する   いろはすは、アニメでスプーン八幡に突っ込んだけど、  実はその直前自分でそのスプーン使ってたw なぜカットするかね  ちなみにヒッキーは、雪ノ下の問題は雪ノ下が解決すべきだし、  由比ヶ浜の言うずっとこのままってのは欺瞞だと言ってる 結局本物を求めるのよ   • Yui's mom show up in this volume • Threesome date near Nishi-Kasai station. • Yui make a proposal at the end. • 8man said Yukino has to stand on her own and fixed her own problems • Cliffhanger, to be continued in volume 12.  Fans service for Irohafag: Iroha actually used the spoon to taste the chocolate before giving it to 8man.   Why don't you try looking into how not to be a retard before posting? It might make you look somewhat less like an idiot chewing on the foot in his mouth.                            The text of the spoiler mentioned no such thing. But nice try.     we'll  kill yourself     Well I genuinely want to see Iroha and 8man start getting frisky.     • Yui's mom show up in this volume  Cool  • Threesome date near Nishi-Kasai station.  Hopefully cute.       If what we've seen so far serve as an indicator, they're getting there. But 8man is 8man and he needs a lot of time. Thankfully he already stepped over the line on that whole spoon incident.     why are you so dumb? Have you tested your IQ? Do you have any trouble with your life? Need any help?     なぜカットするかね  Damn 2ch you're so slow.  FEEL cut the juiciest parts of the scene out so that it wouldn't spoil the LN.        Y so mad Anon?     Here's praying that they plan on releasing the full scene on the BD release. Because that sudden tamanawa appearance and 8man teleporting to yukino's side is just terrible pacing and makes it look like something was cut.       And 10.5 date OVA. Just the date     Cool  I'm guessing FEEL is going to cut her out sadly, considering they also cut out 8mom and 8dad.    Yui you're drunk, go back home.    I appreciate Watari and his skill with Japanese wordplay, but still, fuck Japanese wordplay.   Even those faggots on 2chan have trouble understanding that scene.             No I just feel sorry for you. Inability to detect obvious sarcasm is a sign of social retardation. I'm seriously thinking that maybe you really need help.    iroha ship will sink on volume 11     Inability to detect obvious sarcasm   Oh god the irony      I can pretend I understand moon too.   Posting lewds.   iroha will get BTFO once volume 11 gets translated   mfw     I don't think it was clever wordplay there. Incidentally, he does do a bit of clever wordplay in episode 6 with Isshiki. Isshiki says he seems like he has high awareness (Ishiki-takai), 8man tells her not to lump him in with them (her). Or at least I think that's what he was going for, Irohasu had an awkward reaction to it.         "So you really are good at cooking."    "Do you not believe my words, Senpai?"    "No, not really... I just thought that you're incredible."    "Haa? Are you making passes at me again?"    Isshiki shoves spoon into 8man's mouth.    "Do you hate that level of sweetness?"    "...I don't."    "Ah, but I wasn't talking about the flavor..."    She was almost touching her lips and slightly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.    "Even so, my answer is the same."    "Is that so..."    Iroha starts thinking of something and her gaze drops to the bowl. She then hastily lifts her head.    "Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~"    8man wipes chocolate from his cheek and licks it.    "Too sweet..."                                  Anybody got the other screencaps of the denialfag? His comments are comedy gold whenever another volume hits.   In the LN for that scene he was talking about self-aware people and all that, a reference to his personality. His comment about it confused her since she doesn't really get his loner attitude at times.   Like that time he made the "we shouldn't meet at the gate" joke, it just went over her head and gave off a different impression than he intended.  I don't think he was implying anything about their relationship personally.             I mean go see S2 in reverse ordered nu wa starting with the last epidoes realized and then go to previois ep*s tel the begniing   Preview when?   He's been progressing really quickly with Iroha, so it might be sooner than we think. That said it's questionable whether Watari would even give us the gratification when the story will still revolve around the club even if 8man and Iroha hook up.   I wouldn't be too surprised, this is FEEL we're talking about. There was a big difference in the lewd scenes from the TV version to the BD of YnS, and this season is a pretty exceptional case.  Only way I can really see the BD not having the full version is if something about the production process makes post-release audio/voice editing something that never happens.          volume 11   Yui's volume   Not entirely wrong, but still that comment does elicit a chuckle out of me.       Kinda like 8man   Go out a few times with a girl like Yui   Goes pretty well we talked the whole time (no awkward pauses)   Finally ask her out on a date, awkwardly and reluctantly accepts   Never hear from her after that   Go to basic training   Got injured at basic   Stuck in med quarters for a month in a room alone   Manage to sneak in phone   reconnect with her   "Dont worry ill text you later".   No response   Never again.               What happen when Vol.11 completely translated?    Never hear from her after that  You should have cut all ties right then and there. She's clearly a shitty dishonest person. Not genuine at all.     your fault for being so beta. if you have to ask her, you've already failed before you've begun.    Better insight into the last two episodes of S2, then the long wait for volume 12     "Dont worry ill text you later".     Fucking retard   At what points did the girls start falling for 8man?    Don't worry I'll text you later  Aayyy     I'm pretty sure we will be getting the side stories included with the blu-rays translated from Spyro in the mean time. So the wait shouldn't be as bad as previous volumes.   Still fucking terrible though, I don't understand why I still put myself through this torture.       snuck a phone into med quarters  must have been fort jackson     I wonder why 8man crying after seeing Yui smile and she said she knew what 8man going to said ?    Yui sometime before the school festival, Yukino sometime before "genuine", Iroha after being rejected by Hayama.    Forgot about those. Can't wait to find out what Watari is going to do in them    Thinkin about Genuine.    How long till the blu-rays anyway?  I want dat OST       Yui  Became interested in who he was as a person after the car accident, but didn't actually fall for him until after she joined the club.   Yukino  Implied to be around the genuine scene, though it might have started earlier than that since she displayed minor jealously during events like the culture festival.   Iroha  Was falling for him throughout her request, but had a love epiphany after over-hearing his genuine speech.        How does 8man unlock Nice boat end?   If I recall correctly, the first one actually comes out on the 24th of June. Though I could be wrong.    Yeah i found out i was the rebound, she had a neckbeard cosplayer for a boyfriend who if she was willing to chose him over me then i probably wouldn't want her anyways.   She chose a latino neckbeard cosplayer, over a soldier, i dont know how tall he is but thats pretty bad on her part.  Shes also led on other men and guess what her major is....?  Psychology! That should have raised a red flag for me.            Did he felt what Yui doing is genuine?    I'd argue she was falling for him before that. Iroha confessed to Hayama because she realized she wanted something "genuine" from 8man's speech, a speech which she empathized with because she stopped wearing her mask around 8man.  Therefore one can argue that the reason Iroha confessed to Hayama in the first place (which both 8man and she acknowledged as being really out-of-character for her) is because she was already falling for 8man.      If she chose someone like him then she chose true love over someone like you.    hey i wasn't about to go insane for the sake of maintaining my non-existent training.  Med quarters does things to people. Even prison isn't that isolating.      I was there too mate on day 3 of eating cherry pie i was bored out of my mind did you get rtd?       Stay mad Irohafag. Your ship is dead. Iroha never liked 8man anyways.   Holy, my sides.      Nah, it's just a whore.     Psychology  Yeah that should have been a pretty major sign anon, I'm not quite sure how you missed that.   Sounds like you actually lucked out on that one.    Therefore one can argue that the reason Iroha confessed to Hayama in the first place (which both 8man and she acknowledged as being really out-of-character for her) is because she was already falling for 8man.   I did a pretty large post detailing this interpretation a while back. You could probably find it in the archives.   But the gist was that Iroha confessed to Hayama because she was having doubts about whether her feelings for him were real. Leading to her confession, and something about her behavior during the confession or throughout the day, gave Hayama the impression that Iroha liked 8man.   I would elaborate more, but I don't really feel beating a dead horse again.               I will be completely fucking mad if this doesn't have at least a side story where Komachi meets Iroha.   yeah, after 3 more months of rehab and AIT im finally back home at fort couch.     Yukino  Seems like she always felt some attraction to him. She started very slowly around the school festival but it didn't become anything of note until genuine. The problem with Yukino is she is falling too fast. I don't know what happens in volume 11 but I think she will love him less.  Yui  Interested from the start and developed a crush after some time in the club. Started falling hard around volume 5 and into 6. She was still falling as of volume 10 but now it seems that she is trying to suppress it. I don't know how much she still loves him as of volume 11 but it is probably less than before.   Iroha  Genuine was the real catalyst, the train scene sealed the deal. I don't pay much attention to Iroha so I can't give a good opinion on her.         If we sink,we rather sink bitter sweetly.    Probably, he felt that his genuine about to be lost. And it enforced that both YY are people whom 8man held dear and deeply cared about.   How do we go from this:  “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.” She quickly ran her mouth after flinging out both her hands as if to take some distance.    “…Ahh, yeah, sure. Nevermind, just forget it.”   To THIS         I'm still waiting for 8man to do his own variation of her rejections towards her.   That and the Komachi/Iroha meetup are the two things I'm praying for the most from Watari.       Yui  Around the festival, that is when she started to really love him.   Yukino  Doesn't like him romantically, only as a friend.    Iroha  Loves Hayama-senpai but think of 8man as a friend.           Its time to stop posting.     Doesn't like him romantically, only as a friend.    Loves Hayama-senpai but think of 8man as a friend.   Just because you're not writing something mindnumbingly retarded, doesn't mean we won't be able to tell it's you denialfag.  Stay mad pro Yuix8man Denialfag         Hello denialfag, how's that pepper on your ass going? I imagine it must burn like hell.     how much of a beta must you have been that he was more alpha than you? get game guy. also don't try to stick your dick in crazy. ffs.      He's even trying to start shit in the Saekano thread, he's really hit a new low.     Periodic reminder that Hayate was fed chocolates made with 8man and Iroha's mixed saliva.   This is my opinion too. Iroha is a nice girl and I love the friendship they are fostering but the evidence she has feelings for 8man is weak. We know that Yui is the only one who loves him.   Yukino does like him out of some sort of twisted dependency but doesn't actually love him.     Any spoiler for the BD bundle short story?   I thought some anons already got hands on it.     It's the full version of the Iroha end Watari posted on twitter.     samefagging  Sasuga denialfag, "owning" the thread as always.     That's some next level cucking .     At least it is only Hikigaya's saliva this time    Are you sure that isn't a copycat? He is quite successful of a troll.       You don't need to samefag. It's already bad enough you're responding to Irohafag retardation with more retardation.    would we call that a meta-cuck?   Episode preview when?   What a magnificent cuck. I love this show.    He only responded to a post saying that Yuifags were going to be the next Nekofags; so I'm pretty sure it's him.   Though it could just be a well informed troll, though I kind of doubt it.   Shame Ebina didn't know about it.         24 hours    Okay    No, I won't. I like posting.   I may be pro YuixHikki but I am not "denialfag" Stop using buzz words, they are not arguments.   Not him.  I am not upset, this volume seems to be going well for the characters. There is nothing to make me mad.    That wasn't me, not everyone who has the same opinions are the same person. There are 79 unique IPs in this thread and if even 10% agree with me that is still about 8 people.                http://www.otakutale.com/2015/plast<wbr>ic-memories-episode-13-final-previe<wbr>w-video/  Are you ready for the feels, /a/non?  </wbr></wbr>  I don't think I'll ever be ready ;_;    same shot as the opening to the first episode   Gee, I wonder if she retains her memories.... I Am on the edge of my seat.... I doubt anyone can predict where this is headed...      You don't have to remind me    http://a.loveisover.me/orwxpm.mp4 For those who don't want to visit the site.    With how predictable and cliche this shit is? I just want it to be over.    TFW Isla and Tsukasa end up running away together, Isla becomes a wanderer and kills Tsukasa only to be gunned down in the next scene.    Dropped this a while ago.  What is it that happens to giftias who aren't recalled?     They go crazy because plot and try to kill whatever they previously loved.    They become villians because ~reasons~    Probably the best possible ending  God tier  Isla peacefully goes off to sleep and the last scene is tsukasa being comforted by the employees before introducing a new giftia as his partner  High tier  Isla peacefully goes off to sleep and the last scene is her waking up again with a new personality before being reintroduced to tsukasa as a rookie  Great tier  Tsukasa and Isla run away together and things are okay for a while before the alzheimers drives her insane, edgeville territory  Okay tier  Isla is reawoken after dying and is exactly the same because she found the journal and slowly remembers everything from her previous life  Bad tier  Tsukasa learns that he can save isla through the power of love and the two live happily ever after  Shit tier  Tsundere wins. Doesn't matter anything else that happens if this takes place.                    Hey if these robots aren't recalled in time they might go crazy and hurt people. Do you think we should put remote kill switches in them?   Nah let's leave it up to other robots to recall them and just give the job to anyone cuz that won't be stupid   I had such high hopes for this show       This is going to ruin my entire weekend.   What's going to happen teir   Isla goes to sleep wakes up and has all the memories because REASON NEEDED IT TO HAPPEN and the power of love can retain memories. However, the show will never explain what happened to all the other robots who also fell in love who were forcefully ripped away from their families         But who will water the plants with Tsukasa after Isla is gone?      Isla 2.0 will    Where is she going?       the last scene is tsukasa being comforted by the employees  The rest of the team have already had double their quota of relevance.  A more appropriate moment would be them attempting to console Tsukasa, but Tsukasa happily saying there's nothing to be sad about. His time as a retriever and now as a retrievee has given him a respect for the 'mortality' of giftia, and he now sees no sadness in the act. He now sees retrieval not as a severing, but as as a call to remember.    Rape factory.           best ending  Simon/Nia type ending like in TTGL  worst ending  EVERYTHING ELSE     With all these talks about Isla being revived and the two live happily ever after. I hope that happens, and some Dues Ex thing happens. I HOPE.  But hope isn't the same as knowing, and we all know that the ending will be the most heart tearing thing we will witness form this spring season.    This is why I don't work with amateurs.    Time to place your bets    Going with okay tier because it is the ending they have been building up the entire show.   Why on earth would anyone want a sad end?   Because it will mean something if she dies. If she lives then it will just be the show betraying everything it's built up.   This anime feels like a poor man's clannad   Remote kill switches compromise the owner's privacy and security.    Edgemastery, death is meaningless and faggots want to jack off to suffering  In truth they feel threatened because the anime is going to subvert the obvious "death" flags placed since its conception      More like "people with brain cells don't want to see the theme of accepting loss get tossed out because idiots don't get it".   Why can't they just automatically die after a set time, like replicants, to get around the "they go psycho" problem?  And if they don't die, it's obvious that someone is tampering with the giftia, and they were intended to go crazy, so they should just send out blade runners to take them out.      Why wouldn't you? It's more rewarding than an asspull ending where everything's daijoubu.     More like "people were calling PM predictable because they took for granted Isla was going to die and now are on backpedal mode because wont happen"     Shit tier is best tier     I agree. Rebound end is the best.     they took for granted Isla was going to die    took for granted  The idea of her impending death has been hammered into the plot from the start. And every instance of giftias being reset has affirmed that they don't keep memories.       but it obviously will. She's gonna get her OS updated and reassigned as Tsukasa's partner and it will end with her reading the diary.   Also bonus points if it ends with them in their first new retrieval and Tsukasa asks Isla to whisper into the giftia the phrase she used to say when retrieving.       For some reason this tsundere is really cute.  Maybe it's because she has so many expressions.        It was honestly not something people were expecting, but still nobody was surprised by tier   Isla goes off to sleep and Tsukasa suicides.       She's not very violent either, so her denial/embarassment from her feelings is endearing.    inb4   isla tells mitcher to take good care of tsukasa   isla is retrieved   tsukasa is sad   mitcher cheers him up   he eventually moves on and falls in love with mitcher.          michiru ends up as an hypocrite   le rebound with no development face   Even a butcher-style edgy ending has more chance of happening, like 0.1% versus 0% of Michiru end        Because I love crying like a faggot to bittersweet endings.     Some men just want to watch the world burn       TTGL ending   Not complete shit  Well at least I understand what kind of retards think that kind of ending would be good in Plastic Memories. "It's a thing they yelled at the audience so that's the theme and everything else is a betrayal! It doesn't matter of the actual content of the show didn't support it, they said it out loud so that's the theme! You don't understand!"  How do you idiots even manage to breath on your own?        They should've toned the comedy down.    So you unironically think isla getting to stay alive is a good ending?  I'm not talking about the ending being surprising, who knows, maybe some really unexpected shit happens and she lives on in some way or another. But pretending that a kiss on the lips and the cry of a white dove is enough to justify her survival is retarded.  We have enough anime that shoehorn some happy ending where there is no reason for there to be one. At the very least I hope they give a good justification if something like that happens.       Michiru has a fine booty and she's a horny virgin begging for the D   I don't understand how you got that from my post even a little bit, but ok.   It's going to end with Michiru winning.  Even Isla knows.     They don't have the balls to let Michiru win     Michishit    winning  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Feelsfags, edgefags and tsunderefags all BTFO with a single ep. Threads are going to be great.      There is no romantic development between them.   E-everything will be daijobou, right guys...?    I plan on having beer ready, for more reasons than one.    He knew what he was getting himself into. How can he even be sad. ROBOTS ARE NOT PEOPLE    But even they have souls too.    I hope that's just vanilla ice cream in her mouth.    Another reason why I never picked it up    Never too late to start     Will sniff her panties for fun and profit.     To enjoy the shitstorms and tears.    inb4 its expected happy ending, with /a/ getting butthurt and labeling it as shit   yeay, more agonizing cringe and angst zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....   How can a writer think he can just makehappy ending without proper storyline and expect people to not call it shit.    New Isla will get the notebook and read it and they will bond over the memories of old Isla, both knowing that new Isla can never replace her. Or something like that that.      Time, to die    So who was Rin's servant in the holy grail war  while EMIYA was still a kid and wasn't a counter  guardian at that point in time?     Pretty easy, Archer gets rekt pretty early in EMIYA's grail war or due to some other reason doesn't really get a chance interact with the Shirou destined to become EMIYA. Both ways he doesn't get to influence his younger self and the Shirou continues on his path to the damnation.    He pursued his Ideal of trying to save everyone but was obviously unsuccessful. He put it down to not being strong enough so he made a contract with Alaya under the assumption that he would be able to succeed with more power.

Helping thread reach image cap by posting best girl  Fluff   Best fluff of all     so when homu said she loved madoka what did she mean? is it a friendship love or a fug love?

Still holy shit      Oh shit kevin kun is getting called out! Who will win ?    I think I meant Sayaka took off her meguca clothes in my room.    B-but sayaka is 2D and you are 3d.. those are defiantly 3d clothing. Dont you lie!    Uh, pic is me. I love Sayaka much more than Kevin-kun so I am the next generation.    Can't even keep up with Kevin-kun.             I heard a rumor that you're a Korean. Is it true?     No, that would mean I would hate Sayaka.            I don't get it but dat pantsu m8.      Koreans hate Japs and Sayaka was made by Japs!            hatin' a qt like Sayaka only for that reason is stupid tho.    Is there a better quality version? This one is so fuzzy.      I agree! It probably has to do with Japan raping their country.      __No               Have you ever kissed Sayaka?      That's lewd!    oh shut up, you panty poster.      No! It's a fine picture. Stop!    Just remember: Homura did nothing wrong.    You must answer in Yes or No.      Not until she's of age and real.    So no, huh? Too bad that Sayaka-chan's first will be mine.    Doesn't work that way, champ.      We'll see, cali boy.     Cali boy.      You don't like? Okay. Just post Sayaka. Better if lewd.   New Chapter soon  Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87      god tier design   god tier stand design   good backstory and was literally the start of the SBR   outran fucking horses on foot   had a ton of mystery and intrigue about him   ended up being a stand of the week pawn of Diego's with just a downgraded Echos act 2   What the fuck Araki, this had so much potential.           still mad, i thought he was going to win   Quick! Make up a stand that can beat King Crimson!   Diizu Naatsu     hint that Norisuke is the stand user   hey the Japanese guy uses the Japanese sound effects, that's really clever   NO IT'S THE FUCKING NATIVE AMERICAN   Easily the worst part of part 7.       Hey guys you ready for the new episode on frida- oh....  Well at least we got that part 4 teas- oh....     the world    My soul will not rest until something gives me hope for a Part 4 adaptation.    We can still be hyped for the new chapter and the new EoH demo    There's no PC version, who cares.   Is he called "Gappy" because of the gap in his teeth?    PC version     People who own a console :^)    Yes     soon   implying we'll even get it this month      No, he's called Gappy because he once tripped in the gap between a train and the station platform.    I hope Josuke's seiyuu writes the feem toon and sings the feem toon for part 4, I only watched Hamatora because he sang the ED.     downgraded Echos act 2  IASW was far superior to act. It could make multiple sounds at the same time and the things it made were alive even without diego meddling. Really I don't know what you guys expected him to do if he didn't get involved there he would just be off screen the entire like poco.    I have a question.  In stardust crusaders when polnareff confronts dio and he keeps getting reset back to the start of the stairs, am I really supposed to believe that dio is stopping time, walking over to polnareff, picking him up, carrying him a few steps and then placing him back down gently?       anime is over    we are finally discussing Jojolion   Wow I thought the anime posters would never leave         Just because they don't have scans immediately doesn't mean they won't get it at all   Fridays will finally be 500x less autistic       Yes, that's exactly what's happening.     New Chapter soon  HOW FUCKING SOON I want to see the AU Shit Hair so much.           Fridays will finally be 500x less autistic    no more speedwagon posting   no more hype train posting        I've already read the chapter so it's not that I'm being that impatient, it's just that it has happened before.   Where can i read Jorge Joestar?  Pocoloco's design is so good, he's barely affected by Araki's changing art style.   He's sexy.    Reading the older chapters I really hate how ugly the new crosshatching look. It looks really lazy and sketchy in comparison.    Speaking of Araki's changing artstyle, what part is everyone's favourite style?    Not finished translated yet and the translator is not releasing it bit by bit. It'll be all in 1 go.    Might have been a new/shitty assistant for a while. The crosshatching in Part 7 looked perfect.    I like how late part 1 to part 3 looks but I don't really have a favorite.   Superior jojos thread  never?   ever     It's just UJ printing quality messing up the more delicate shading. All the other parts have tank scans.     Late Part 3 to mid Part 4, along with most of part 2, looks great in that classic style that JoJo has.  Mid Part 7 is probably my favourite look. Really evocative and memorable. Part 8 is drifting away from that a bit too much.      post jojo characters irl   The 10th volume of Jojolion that comes out next month could have a flyer about it    who's this girl?      I honestly think a chapter or two with just sandman and pocoloco would have made SBR the best part uncontested, hell they could have fought sloop john b, who got second place in the race but no design for the character     I want to see the AU Shit Hair so much.  it's been on the chinese blogs for a week now     Part 2. I like my burly fabulous men more than scrawny fabulous boys.      I feel you, anon    kek oh my    RiffRaff's Codeine Conquest    Mid-7. Current 8 is great too, Karera is one of the most consistently good-looking Araki girls ever.  Part 4 had a nice sweet spot somewhere in the middle, but it was on the brief side and I wasn't a big fan of the early or late styles.     IT'S HERE  Just finished part 4 Why is the pose famous if he never does it?    True suffering    did you miss this page    Mid part 4, the time where Araki started going easy on the muscles and body size, and haven't went crazy with lips and noses.    link pls    The guy who works on the scanlations tweeted out that they don't have the raws yet so i'm not suspecting the chapter until at least Friday, assuming they get the scans today or tomorrow.   Nice try      Oh hey, I remember the page but not that panel, can't believe I missed that.  Suppose I expected it to make a bigger impact on me, and be a big panel or something, that's no excuse though     I'm almost here, but not yet.   Stand User: Riff Raff Stand name: Aquaberry Dolphin  Ability: User can generate money up to 20k a day, however they must spend whatever money they generate that day       The shittness ratio of Jo3ke's hair has been greatly reduced.  Why isn't half of Jo2ke's eyes bright like this Jo3ke?       you will never tag team a racially ambiguous priest witha bunch of your bros     Dude. His sides are shaved clean.    Yes, please.     Obligatory.       Just saw Gaucho die in that woods SBR   wanna start reading JoJolion so I can be caught up with these threads   How far am I        Your not so subtle /r/equest won't ever work.    hes sicilian. how is that so hard to understand. Sicilian Italians are dark as fuck.    Near the True Man's World.    he looks like michael jackson in this pic     Jo3ke  Let's not do that. His name is Josefumi.   That color must've gone to the other body. The corpse's eyes were bright too.        That feeling when you look at Magic Boy BT and then the latest JoJoLion chapter, you'd think that the two were made by completely different artists.  Some years ago people were posting gifs explain Stands and other abilities from JoJo, many were edits from this gif.  Any idea of were I can find them?     is this what Joshuu would look like with a pomp?     NO. THE WORLD HAS A BODY. IT CAN MOVE THINGS YOU AUTISTS.       downgraded Echoes Act 2   No he wasn't. Echoes could modify the properties of objects by drawing sound effects on them, but he couldn't create effects in mid air that he could use for whatever purpose he wanted.       Nah man, He's Josefumi Kujo the other half of Gappy     someone on the internet made a joke and i don't like it!     speaking of Jobin, did he really not know who Jo2uke was?    Joshuu might not even be able to make a pompadour since all his hair seems to come from the top of his head.    Even Dio is shocked.    He knew Kira and the Rockman Duo    I like the Dio theory better,  Dio picking up Polnareff gently and speaking to his frozen body join me again while placing him down gently and running back to his spot and starting time again and rinse and repeat.     How do I become hard on hoes like Josuke?   No, he's really confused once he figures out he was tricked and now he suspects his own dad of being up to something.    He knew Kira  Did he? I don't remember that ever coming up.        He will never be a bro jo will he?    Get adopted by a rich family    Find one girl you truly love that loves you back and disregard all others    I know it's Josefumi but I like Jo3ke, it's cute.    Such a cool looking stand shouldn't have the ability of another one. Diego The world gets a pass     Why didn't he just say 'oh Karera, My memory got fucked up by a stand during the earthquake.' She would've been on his dick like white on rice, spilling info all over the place.  That's all he had to say.     My mistake he knew about Kira.  Cuz his papa knows about him too.      I don't know, the Internet?   I like french fries I like french fries I like french fries  But not fried chicken       Man, Double J is one hard motherfucker.   i wonder if will we be calling Gappy, Josefumi after the new chapter?     Karera says she's all about living in the moment and doesn't care about the past. I wonder how she'll react when she finds out Secchan isn't Secchan after all.    I am pretty sure Josefumi was nick named Jojo and Josuke is another way of saying Jojo. So he'd go by Strictly Jojo to avoid confusion     If he knew Kira then he would've known why Josuke tricked him as he looks just like Kira. Jobin had no idea who Josuke was at all and didn't even think it was about the fruit shit.  Now unless Jobin is retarded I can only assume he was secretly teamed up with the rockmen for a cure and Norisuke secretly teamed up with Kira and his con artist friends for a cure but they didn't inform each other of that.  Josefumi was likely going to try to steal the healing aspect of the fruit the rockmen had so their secret plans ended up intertwined without them knowing.       She'll be like noooo!!!!! My nightmare came true Secchan and Kira did fuse!!!!    When did we see the other corpse? In the first chapter? I don't seem to remember.    The guy himself is still Josuke. Araki is being rather blatant with his themes so he's definitely his own new person and not just either of his halves.   Some /a/non posted a cleaned up version of this, anyone happen to have it?   this is the same man that previously was walking down a corridor while stopping time every few steps to light some candles on either side, all for effect. You're goddamn right he's carrying him down those stairs.    They found it near the wall eyes after the Fun Fun Fun fight. It was identified as Kira, but it was actually a second fusion made of the parts of him and Josefumi that aren't in Josuke.    His stand is picking him up.    True because they don't know that their maid is Kira's sister    Shit Hair 2.0   For some reason I'm glad to see Kira still loves beating the shit out of schoolboys, even in death.  Could DIO smash this pumpkin?    tfw no Dead Man's Answers     Hwas crying cause he saw the beating his girl took and he wasn't around to defend her    He didn't acknowledge her injuries or ask her about the shit she had gone through. shit bf     Got more of these?     Gappy  Christ, I wish this fucking nickname would die already. His name is "Johsuke" as written in English on the tank covers.      NO WAY,ARE YOU SURE?    johsuekeh is my favorite johjoh   r/ the image of joseph smiling next to the "one life partner"  any one got a link to the script   Explain further.    I bet you call Jotaro's mom "Holly".    Mid Part 3 to early Part 5. But I do like the Current Style(Mid SBR to Present).   Will Josuke have the most amount of pussy of any JoJo by the end of this part?   In the manga they said that Joestars only have one partner. Joseph is smiling because loljosuke     Part 4 had Josuke, Jotaro and Joseph in it   Part 8 has Josuke, Josuke (Norisuke) and Josefumi  All them Jojos in Morioh, man.     Kars   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090749  What?      plus those half jojos, Jobin and Joshuu   When did this, become more beautiful than THIS?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090749  Sexualized cartoon depictions of little boys. But I don't see what this has to do with anything    The art started gitting gud at mid part 4.    Thanks    the early and mid part 7 pictures show a really ugly johnny    Don't let the other anons lie to you. The stairs were actually made of some kind of solid cold fire and Dio was using his firebreathing powers to make new Stairs and confuse Polnareff    Maybe a couple.    He only wants one and I don't imagine any of them other than maybe Karera would be alright with sharing.    the giant bara deer look did give funnier poses and was generally more homoerotic but really it was sort of silly. I unno which I prefer more the CUHRAZY poses or the more realistic anatomy.    You sure about that?    Technically always since part 7 onwards Araki based his designs and anatomy directly off of Greek/roman artwork.   What will I do on friday nights now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?   Are they friends now? Didn't Tsurugi try to kill him and kidnapped/molested his gf in a dungeon?     part 3 wasn't that good in anime form  part 4 would probably be better as an anime but who knows      rewatch the part 4 commericials and cry    tsurugi was being manipulated       now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?   Are you retarded      He's only nine so of course Josuke would be a bit friendlier towards him to make up for telling him to turn on his dad. There's no point in staying angry when both have a common goal and their own issues to work though.    JOnathan   JOseph   JOtaro   JOsuke   Giorno   This triggers my autism.         I don't think 9 year olds are able to molest people.    but kuJO and Higashikata don't?   so will part 4 anime be 4 cour?    Kujo,Jotaro  Jotaro is easily the joeist jojo     If it happens it'll probably be 2 1/2 or 3.    The two Josukes are so Jojo they don't even need surnames to be Jojos.    Probably three. It's one of the longest parts too. I really hope David Pro confirms they're doing it soon.    That's because part 5 is fanfiction and shouls be treated as noncanon and skipped.     JOnothan JOestar   JOseph JOestar   KuJO JOtaro   JOJOsuke Higashikata   GIOrno GIOvanna (pronounced J-orno)   KuJO JOlyne   JOhnny JOestar   JOJOsuke Higashikata   KuJO JOsefumi   You're acting like an Americlap              It should be four because it is only slightly longer than part 3. I hope it's shorter though, as I disliked the pacing of part 3.    July 10th.I guarantee it.    I can definitely see Part 4 being slimmed down similarly to Part 1.    Thanks Men's Warehouse.     now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?  Source: My ass.      slimming down slice of life  might as well skip it.      JOJOsuke  wot  I mean, I know the "-suke" can be read a "-jo", but your method of explanation misses that.        GEOrge JOestar   GEOrge JOestar II   Holly JOestar-KuJO        JOJOsuke Higashikata  You are probably actually really literally retarded.     Part 1 and 2 had relatively little cut out though. I can't imagine they'd start condenscing now with the fourth part. Especially after they're rolling in cash from SDC.   So is Gappy a new entity born of Josefumi and Kira or is he just Josefumi with Kira's bits stuck in him and memory loss?   Not a lot, but some swaths could be tidy single episodes in themselves.     rolling in cash  SDC anime was a huge flop in nippon    Guys, How to draw a JOJO face.   Insane cheekbones.    ctrl+c, ctrl+v    Big fucking nigger lips    Yeah, and you're a mouthbreather. The "suke" in Josuke can be also read as Jo.     Most people call him "Jorge Joestar"     It always bothers me how bloodshot his eyes seem to be in this.     not that guy but here's a better way to show it  仗(JO)助(suke, can also be read as JO) Higashikata   定(JO)助(suke, can also be read as JO) Higashikata  Does norisuke IV's birthname use the same kanji as part 4 josuke?        We don't know, dipshit. New chapter isn't even translated    The strain of someone looking at his internet history is too great that his eyes are shot.    It's George II everywhere but that book.    Relax buttmunch, it was just a question. And plenty of people on here read moon as it is.    We've known it for a long time, he's a new person. Kyo said it too, their minds have been fused. That's why the stand is a combination of both.   Reading Part 5 now.   Is there any villain who doesn't keep pulling stuff out of their ass to pad out their fight?   Ghiaccio can go die in a fire       Kyo conjectured it, but since Gappy is so keen on finding out who he is, I'm assuming he thinks he's this other person.    It wasn't though.     We're all aware of that, but saying JOJOsuke is fucking stupid.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127092505   I knew before I even read.   And I'm fine with that. Mista's all I need anyway.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8Mq<wbr>J3iGBdOo</wbr>  [ ] Might as well have been Jojos part 9     Yeah, he still wants to believe he has a past that goes back further than when he first saw Yasuho, but that really is where his life began. It's surprising how many people don't realize this, it's not like Araki is being subtle at all about it.    Honestly, I'd rather that be what it was since that means Gappy is his own character, not someone like Weather Report, who changed completely after he regained his memories.   jojo scanlators are slow   I agree. I didn't mean that as a bad thing at all.    It made sense, with weather report, he had his memories stolen, and maliciously at that, he should be pissed.     Pucci takes sex pistols from Mista and later causes his death,     Yeah but Weather Report became almost completely uncaring of his allies post memory retrieval.    Speaking of Pucci, has anyone ever seen what happens in All-Star Battle when he uses his Whitesnake powers on a non-Stand User, like Jonathan or Kars?    Probably nothing different happens.    If you're the same anon from before, I'm surprised you didn't toss in a  Mista dies  joke somewhere in there.    Yeah, nothing different happens. Another lost opportunity for CC2.     Does norisuke IV's birthname use the same kanji as part 4 josuke?  No, it uses the same one as Jobin and Joshuu.     If they announce it on July 10th iI will fucking cum so hard bcuz it's my birthday   What was the text in the speech bubble? Preferably the english text.   I, DIO, will now buttfuck you     I don't think 9 year olds are able to molest people.  He groped Yasuho's tits and licked her ear     Dis is muh wurl, jutarou    It was something like "Time to die, Polnareff"   Who's the most handsome Jojo?  And why it's Johnny?     That's not KuJO JOsefumi.   Fucking fagget won't scanlate this shit fuck    Not choosing foxy grandpa     no it wasn't.    Then you will die here, Polnareff!    If it happens it'll be 48 episodes as well. Part 4 is like 20 chapters longer than Part 3, and remember Part 3 needed filler to fill 48 episodes.   How much longer is Jojolion going to go? I want to be able to marathon the entire thing but at the same time don't want to keep waiting.   Some 4 or 5 years.        this is most pleasing   Weird how Jojolion is quite mediocre if you follow it monthly. I'm following it since it came out and felt pretty underwhelmed about it overall, but I recently re-read everything back from the beginning and it's been quite a hide actually.   mysteries are like that     that jaw  more like funny valentine kek     http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=trBx<wbr>PFLq__g</wbr>  [ ]    the average sized jojo parts (parts 3-6) ranged from 16-18 voumes and lasted over 3 years each. Steel ball run was 24 volumes (volume lengths being a more accurate point of reference when comparing SBR to other parts because while chapter length increased greatly when the ultra jump move occurred volume page count didn't) and lasted slight over 7 years.  Jojolion has been around for 4 years and will have it's 10th volume out soon: The latest we're in in the story is likely in the middle       Josuke is another way of saying Jojo  Not this time, the kanji is different.    you OK reatard? I am wood  stupid     We duwang now      I wish everything had a duwang translation   We differentiate Jonathan and Johnny, right? We don't say things like "Jonathan comes back in Part 7". So why are we trying to look for an old character in Josuke?  Can someone explain what happened during Johnny get shot while Gyro vs D.i.s.c.o? Why the witness saw three different shooter?   Don't forget  GEorge Joestar  and  Jotaro KUJO   No one is perfectly related even in real life so shut the fuck up.         Part 7   Can someone put up the Chris Evans pose photo please, its my favorite pic   Only Josefumi uses the 仗    How does that make sense if Part 3 was 5 cour? Part 4 is the longest pre-SBR part.    Remember that in Japan, the last name is said first. So Jotaro would be called KuJO JOtaro    Don't forget  JOshua bar JOseph (Jesus)      Really far, but enjoy the ride SBR is. It's amazing.     THIS   We should, not, NEED a team of people to properly dub part 4 in Duwang when its announced. Anyone fluent in Jap and or got time on their hands willing?       sup bro     you ok retard?    Josuke. And Josefumi since he's practically identical.    I thought the blood was from Yotsuyu until I saw blood on Gappy's knuckles.    Joseph obviously   Josuke would be pretty handsome if he didn't have a piece of cow shit stuck on his head.       What a weak stand. All the JoJos are turning in their grave   wow so kira and kira died fighitng each other...i guess that is a spin on part 4  Which characters are most likely to have tried fucking their stands?   Anyone????????????????      Yeah nobody knows what happened during that arc. That's a bigger mystery than the second coffin in my book.     So: Part 4 josuke and josefume: 仗 Part 8 josuke:定 the part 8 higashikatas (joshu, jobin, norisuke iv's birth name [josuke], and presumably the birth names of norisuke ii and iii): 常          dub  You mean sub, right? Duwang subs would make more sense     yes, typo my bad. But we need a team fucking dedicated to that shit. I would literally pay if the BD had duwang subs.      three separate johnnies in separate locations    If I knew how to do that sort of thing, I would.   Explain Jojo and all its related concepts in one sentence to someone who has never read a manga before   It's the generational story of the Joestar family as they fight bizarre enemies.    I think it would better fit if it was  "It's the generational story of the Joestar family as they fight bizarre enemies using a variety of bizzare powers."       dat yo     Weird motherfuckers fighting weirder motherfuckers    Read the title of the manga    Bizarre people with ghosts fight other bizarre people with ghosts  Also everyone is fabulous     Why didn't diego turn funny into a dinosaur? Couldn't he do it with just a scratch when scary monsters first appeared?   guardian angels formed by psychic power called stands which each have unique supernatural cababilities are used by characters in a multi part story each with their own MC's related to a joestar bloodline fight evildoers fabulously    It truly is a bizarre adventure.    Yeah, this anon gets it.    Are there fan arts of Kadera or yet?    have 4 balls or two pairs     Really nobody? I thought /a/ has the most hardcore jojo fans here.    He is one of the most ugliest characters Araki ever made, but I still like this guy.    This happened https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fX8<wbr>Kc8gnPnU</wbr>  [ ]     It was clearly explained anon     part 1: downtown abby with vampire, sunlight kungfu, and the titanic  part 2: ancient homosexual aztec vampire gods get trolled by british human bugs bunny  part 3: A jap, his gramps, a muslim, a metrosexual, and a frenchman all hunt down a british vampire banana man on the other side of the world  part 4: a quiet town has a fetish murderer, manga artist, and a couple of characters up to no good, while a gang of school kids hustle niggas left and right.  part 5: a group of gay fashionistas seek to find their pink hyena leader to save his daughter  part 6: women go to prison with a 10 year old boy while a gay black catholic priest ends the entire universe for his deceased gay lover  part 7: Paraplegic and an aspiring Italian comic race across america to find the corpse of jesus christ and kill the president while dinosaurs wait for them at every turn  part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes.                   He's the most Asian looking one of the family side from his father. Also, he's an self-serving jackass most of the time so it fits.    Yes.     british human bugs bunny  you fucked up      groped Yasuho  proof or never happened    I'm about to start reading part 4.   What should i expect for?     Fatty dies.      A beautiful duwang      kira kills guido    I still have hopes that he will be a brojo.      This guy being the best character of the series with the best death as well.       I don't thik I should pst this   the hell with everyone   FUCKIN' TSURUGI BEST JOJO CHARACTER EVER!       You're a nice anon, anon.    I like how everytime Yasuho yells a little heart appears.   will karera grow joubin's eyebrow back?  I made a thing   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=izF<wbr>qa0i_EwI</wbr>  [ ]     Tsurugi is such a weird kid.    I'm gonna be honest with you anon, almost ever character in JoJo can beat that fat bastard. Why? Because he isn't the smartest member of the gi niu patrol. Even the big rip off dumbass asshole who almost killed Vegeta was smarter than him.    He is like kid Anassui.    Tsurugi gonna start murdering people too?   So is number 3 done yet?   Only if he sees his girlfriend cheating on him.   So when will the final BD for Part 3 come out?   I kind of like these descriptions.    can I do three?       Sure.     3 is not done yet but some anon said he'd do it, but that was about a week ago.    Acho was such a great character. And double wu was such a great stand.   I got a message saying /a/ wanted to do an /a/ sings for the Jojo finale. Is that still on?  when jojo's colored adventures gets to this I hope keep the mudas going out of the text boxes   God Kira was so fucking cool    Is this it anon?   Part 3 was weak in general but the crew was pretty enjoyable I guess.  I doubt David will drop the rest of the parts. If anything, animating Part 7 and 8 in the future will be up for debate    Why do people talk about Jorge Joestar so much? What makes it so special in the Jojo-verse?    36 Kars on mars.     Dude, I can't maintain a meaningful relationship because that's how I am.  You don't want any part of that shit.      There's a part where a Kira uses the spin to power a rope to blow Lisa Lisa in half, and then he dances with her upper body.    I can't tell which parts are true and which parts are made up by /a/nons while they're drunk, on weed and LSD, and sleep-deprived at the same time.       Fuck please respond.  I know its long but its some crappy edit that links the ending of episode 47 and the beggining of episode 48 with Roundabout playing as the ED.         It's Flashpoint wacky JoJo edition.    It's all true.    I do not speak nip, so I wouldn't know. It COULD be all true for all I care.       you're out with a qt who loves you when you see this  what do     He already has with NotWhammu.    The illustrations from the book are online. Here's PB Dio with his stand, The Passion.    notice that there's a weird "hand" like quality to the way araki draws feet     still thinking irene and steel ball run are in the same universe     We all know he can't draw feet.     We still don't even know what the plot is.    OH MY GOD, JAHHHHHH! is my favorite Anthology song.  What's yours?     KillerQueen already can.    well, I'm ashamed     Since the anime is over, how would you rate the adaptation of David?  I give it a 8/10, it was good, some parts looked like ass, and as an adaptation, they didn't have to be 100% loyal to the manga, but it was nice to see the manga animated.    Chapter 44 when?   this is what I came up with     Looks good, keep going.     umm ok    I'm confident they'll animate the first six, but like you said anything after that is a guess. DiU and SO are long, but doable. Steel Ball Run is a different beast altogether due to it's length and arc structure. As long as the do the rest of the per-reset parts, I'm happy. I really want to see Morioh fully animated    Those aren't the illustrations. The in-book illustrations are done by Araki. The ones on the website are just sketches related to the book that the author himself did. Could be the entire plot, could just be random shit.    Araki only drew the cover, nothing inside.    All the books in the VS JoJo series had interior illustrations by Araki though.    Except for Jorge Joestar.    This made me really sad, Anon. Sad that they didn't use Roundabout and sad that the journey is over.   if they actually make more parts in the anime 4,5 etc. will they use the VAs from All star game? I really like Namikawa voices Giorno   Really? Because guys here really hate how he does his Stand cries.    Not that anon but I thought he nailed it    I hope not. Josuke's VA doesn't suit him at all.    The main JoJos, probably. But from what I could tell with ASB, CC2 didn't consult with David Pro about casting judging by the voice changes in Part 3. Though from what I can tell, the anime cast now do the characters in the next game.  If they keep Josuke, Okuyasu, Kira, Rohan, and maybe Koichi, I'm happy. Really the first three are the most important. Oku and Kira are perfectly cast.      You bastard   ;_; why couldn't it have ended like this.  no sono chi no sadame   no get back          Who else could they cast as Koichi?    I just love Romi Park so they better keep her.    keep coloring, anon-kun?    I think he needs more intensity in his mudas but otherwise he was perfect much better than romi was.   no raw yet?  Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane That I want to lose in you, Baby can you stand the pain Hey, lover, sugar don't you see? There's so many things that you do to me Oh baby! (hey, lover) All I want to see is the love in your eyes And all I want to hear is your sweet love sighs (hey, lover) All I want to feel is burning flames Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same Tell me that you feel the same way I do Tell me that you love me girl We'd be so lost, in our mouths, the best, I feel it everyday (every way) You feel so wrong, be alone, if you just follow somebody someday Soft and wet Soft and wet                  That's the real reason why she was introduced at all.   Why isn't he dressed up as a girl, /a/?  Part 4 &gt; Part 2 &gt; Part 7 &gt; Part 6 &gt; Part 5 &gt; Part 1 &gt; Part 3  Agree or agree?     aren't feet just weird hands, anon?     Get rid of that grey. All of it.     ok    It's gender-neutral clothing. The weather is cold and crossdressing doesn't work anyway.     part 5 better than part 3  Absolutely disgusting.      I guess i wont be a cunt. One of D4C's lesser used powers is space blending. D4C has the ability to made two different locations in space exist at the same time in the same place. He used it to place both wekapipo and diego in the same location relatively to shoot tusk. At that moment both Diego and Wekapipo existed in the same place at the same time, totally unaware of each other. Outside onlookers would see only one or the other depending on their perspective.  He used this power again when he attains Love Train. That is how he 'projected' himself in that flying space window and pursued johnny from the train.         Space manipulation powers are way more complicated than time manipulation powers.    i fucking love his voice as giorno he sounds like a teenager and it's so good     I couldn't do anything about Jobin, but I colored as much as I could   So i just finished part 2 of the anime an im on to part 3, and one of the things im definitely going to miss about part 2 is Stronheim and "muh german engineering". Is there anything like this later on in the series?  So what's the deal with this picture? Is this Kira and Josefumi hanging out like buddies, or is it Jo2uke and Josefumi hanging out?  I hear Josefumi is supposed to be Jo2uke before the merge apparently, but they look nothing alike so i have no idea why Karera would mix them up.     Joseph's hand is some pretty solid german engineering. Granted, it gets broken all the fucking time to demonstrate stand power without actually injuring anyone, so it seems like a piece of trash.    Every time i see the family crest the illuminati pops into my head.     Berry nice.     thanks anon-kun    kira and josefumi, and jotaro was suppose to look enough like joseph that tomoko thought he was him. araki isn't good at making people look like other people on purpose.    It's Kira and Josefumi. It's a photo Karera has on her phone.   Karera herself says she barely recognized Secchan too. It could've been his voice or mannerisms that convinced her. Early in the part Norisuke said he must be a yankee because he picked the teddy bear over the robot and took his sneakers off inside the car.         If we fused Jo2uke and Jo3uke, We could make him into Josuke?     go away joel   Is Part 4 animu confirmed yet?   wouldn't that just make jo5uke?    He'd be Jo6uke.    well it seems like we're at an impasse    2jo4uke5me    We can agree that they would make a larger Josuke to the nth power rather than cancel out.    Would they continue getting closer and closer to Josuke (Original), or would they just become Jo∞uke?    I'm pretty sure that the joXuke who's hair consumes the entire universe will come long before jo∞uke   Jo(X^Y)suke is best jo   I feel bad for native Americans. But it still feels good to be black.   So what the fuck happened to the invisible baby from part 4?    She marry Josuke Higashikata and continue the Joestar family line.     Naked Silver, but the whole CD is amazing     implying White Album Gently Weeps wasn't one of the hypest moments in all of part 5     honestly white album is my favorite stand design and favorite stand fight overall     responding to a person who doesn't like part 5 fights     anime of Jorge when?   So which time stand is objectively the strongest?   Do you mean physical strength or power?    So I've been looking at this picture a bit, and I'm starting to think that Josefumi himself may be some kind of unholy union between Josuke and Okuyasu. Maybe their alternate selves are one guy?    Everything. If they were to fight. who would be the last one standing.    Made In Heaven. It's Flash fast. The World and Star Platinum can beat it though with the proper technique.    both I think are answered by Diavolo    chew      physical strength   I sometime think that Physical strongest stand is crazy diamond.     Post more DUWANG  What makes someone want to pair these two up?   really tough to choose between Fire of Soul, Crazy My Beat, and Go WEST!      If stands have sex, does the user feel the pleasure too? Rape people with stands. Also how and where do stand users with non-humanoid stands get hurt?     I highly doubt these people put much thought into it, but maybe it's the King and Queen thing or the fact that the main motivation of both is to keep their identity secret.    Who the hell is that one between male Reimi and Fem Kira?    hah Killer Queen and King Crimson that's cute     The alien?     Rape people with stands.  That actually makes me think, would that work? Someone without a stand still gets hurt if a stand punches them, right? I can't think of any circumstances in which that has happened.     ayy lmao    Mikitaka, see those UFOs in her dress?    Well, part 7 gives us MUH MURICA    You're a idiot aren't ya?    The only stand OTP is Soft &amp; Wet with Paisley Park.   Just read part 4  why do people think this wont get its own season?               posting 3d on /a/              Because muh teaser    Should have been Soft &amp; Wet pulling Nut King Call who's holding the pillow instead.    I really did want it though.     do I fit in guys?      Can Diavolo even move or is he even aware during stopped time?    these fuck are taking forever with the chapter   Depends solely on if Epitaph can see stopped time with its prediction. DIO doesn't need to gesture to stop time or give a signal that he's doing it. If it can't, Diavolo can't win, if it can, he probably wins.     shit posting is okay! XDDD    What would Killer Queen Requiem do?   Blow up anyone, anywhere    Dynamite with a lazer beam.   is it possible to play as Yellow Jacket DIO in Fightcade rather than lesbian DIO?   Didn't it pretty much go requiem when it got bites the dust?    What if it's Killer Queen Bites the Dust Requiem?    Blows up anyone that has knowledge that Yoshikage Kira is a serial killer and has a severed hand fetish, no matter where they are. Events and memories will then be altered as if the person never existed from that point on.   No.   Bites the Dust is an added ability, not a Stand in itself.          Sorry, for clarification I meant what if Killer Queen went Requiem after getting Bites the Dust?     no.  fuck. well why not?  why cant i play best outfit        this was the best twist of all of JoJo though    You can, it's called Shadow DIO.     fuck that infinite combo pet shop shit     The Stand changes and probably won't retain Bites the Dust.   It's a CPU only outfit.   Shadow Dio is shirtless.          DIO's leg gets cut off when he's punched into the shop   he gets punched in the head so hard his legs don't work any more   his body (probably legs too) gets fucked up by Jotaro before he sucks Joseph's blood   his legs get fucked up by Jotaro before time resumes after Jotaro's time stop   he gets hit by a punch that is probably the hardest punch Jotaro had thrown thus far, and the punch lands right on his shin  It kinda makes sense to me why hitting DIO in the leg for the final hit was the final straw that fucked him up good.         It's a CPU only outfit.  well fuck me. thanks for the clarification.  seems like something someone would mod in        I don't think The World's range good enough to do that    He can send it 10 meters before the power drops off.   See: Punching Kak in the car.      how do the hair bubbles work    That punch was so hard it broke Star Platinum's fist, something has never happened to it before or since.    second coffin?   What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?   As always, me under the bed.    vampire   Milf  slut   How would you even have that?    Lolis giving birth to even smaller lolis.    Loli to loli, ashes to ashes.    Adorable.    infinite universe    Genki lolis are the best.   succubus   We'll call it the loliverse.     What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?  The smug character archetype.     Alcoholic.   Loli baa-sans  The wise old master.  mountain climbing archetype  this   That would be insanely cute. And they would grow up to become lolis forever.  This is brilliant.      'Mature' loli who has an affair with a married man archetype.   That's no loli.    It's a space station.    Me with no pan    Me showing my drawings.    This   School girl that is secretly a prostitute archetype.  Possessed yandere robot brown elf childhood friend.   me on the right    Hi.      Draw a loli   Call it a mother   Still qualifies as a milf in my book.        Checked.    The loli    I'm the Paladin on the right, Bard pls    It's just a hug, don't worry.    You mean like some sort of double loli?   Tsundere lesbian loli.   But I don't want your damn cracker; and where are your panties? Have you no shame?     Have you no shame?  She's a bard.    Sorceress &lt;3   I don't see how that would work.    As cute bard loli myself, I make sure to never wear any panties around my cute loli friends.    What  said.   Oppai   Thats lewd, anon    me on the left taking a selfie tbh    Swap swordmage and cleric. A cleric would not be caught with such an exposed cunny.    edge and gore   Cunny !   You will never impregnate your trash can and have it birth your loli daughter who you then proceed to fuck    http://exhentai.org/s/9cd7c92cee/82<wbr>6867-16</wbr>      Can we rub cunnies together anon-chan?    Only if otou-san's dick is between them. It's not yuri if the cunnies dont touch     Threadly reminder that "cunnyposting" has no positive impact on the thread.       What character archetypes combine well with the loli archetype in anime/manga?   Everything. Loli tsunderes, loli moms, loli nerds, loli kings/queens, loli aliens, undead lolis...      p-papa iku ikuuu    Dicks are gross, I just want a cuddle party.    What's the sense of having a priest and a medic in the same roster? Usually priests are medics.   Gave this a read. The scar marks where off-putting at first.   I liked the other girl more.    Medic is a better healer, Priest has buffs and heals.    Me on the left taking a selfie with the second cutest loli in our group.    rip my dick     at first.   I couldn't get over them I tried but nah.  Shit was disgusting        Has this guy ever actually done any loli yuri, or is it just lolis looking at each other suggestively? I'd even take f/f/m    While Rina is cute, I still prefer Yukino   who is this penis piglet?    swordmage  It's called a spellsword      f/f/m  Hes done FFM before.  no yuri, that i know of.       Not in  4e  it isn't.    This one.    Fake lolis are shit    Fake lolicons are shit.    You mean fake fat breasted, grown woman.    Femdom loli x trap  So I can self insert as cute pretty boy being dominated by a sexually aggressive loli    Why is loli being punished?  translate it, weebs      getting mentally destroyed by loli  Ah, heavenly feels.     What is she trying to indicate with her finger?   How does /a/ feel about monstergirl lolis?   I'd rub them all the same    Not as good as human lolis, but still much better than old hags.    I'd pet and cuddle the fuck out of them.    That she was drawn by a shitty artist who didn't know what to do with the hands he sucks at drawing.    I like when monstergirls have weird vaginas that dont look human. When you slap a human vagina on a snake monstergirl or a frog girl or whatever it just looks boring, they need interesting vaginas in order for them to be sexy.    Something like Harpy lolis having cloaca instead of the usual human parts?    What are your thoughts on dwarf lolis? Beards or no beards?    Refer to Outbreak Company.    yeah, its interesting.   The weirder the vagina, the more of an adventure it would seem to fuck such a thing. Which is why i think is why monstergirls are so popular, its the adventure humoring the idea of what it would be like fucking some alien creature. But thats just my opinion.    i dont like lolis with beards.         Which one, Rin or Ophis?  Either way you're wrong.      But how would you know she's a dwarf if she doesn't have a beard?      Where does it end? You got to think about it.    Fuck no I ain't! F.forgive me my beautiful loli daughter.     When the loli starts getting sickly/looking ugly.   Edgy teens like accelerator     Loli². A double layered loli. This is insane, the loli density is too high, it'd theoretically create a black hololi.        You made the right choice    Mr bones.jpg    Don't ever leave my side, I don't know what I would do without you.  It looks like it is me that needs you now.      ohh~ papa~    Never thought of that  yfw the beard grows before scalp hair on a newborn      I want to spoil you so bad. Give you all sorts of exotic cars and exotic candies and stuff.   I fucking hate lolis...   Yeah well loli loves you.    Leopard was the best loli of the year.    But anon.  All lolis are the best of the year. Always     Artist? I recognize the style, but I can't recall the person.    you should check the recent drawthreads. someone drew a few lewds of that character.     Just this once  http://exhentai.org/g/605116/7477a2<wbr>5a63/</wbr>  Never say I didn't love you, my fellow lolicon.      Much obliged, comrade.    No they don't they are incapable of love as they are only color lights on a screen, and have no sentience what so ever. Even if that character on the screen had some sort of emotion simulating AI it's still just a simulation. They are not inoccent, they are not evil, they are not young nor old, they dont exist... Waifu/husbando fags suck it!   Bump?   Or just marks of graphite, charcoal, pastel, paint ect...     ai  Oh it's only pretending to feel then? Yea nah, she's not a real woman, that's why she loves me.       Not sentiant    love       sentient girl   love for anything that isn't money or luxury  Lolis may not be real  yet  but they sure as hell can love.       Waifu/husbando fags suck it!  /cgl/ pls go and stay go     You're forgetting about  3D  lolis   In a world without norms or STDs, would fucking a Loli be possible?    fuck off.     No, fuck you.     Are we getting raided?     No I'm being serious here.    /a/ isnt the place to ask those kinds of questions.    Then you're a shitty crossboarder and should die.    Shirley you can't be serious.    fuck off    No lewd allowed    That still goes under aforementioned forms of visual arts.    No, I made a joke at the wrong time.     <br/>  A full translation doesn't exist huh?  Shh, loli is sleeping  Why is this allowed? https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/3674099 Trigger warning for Katefans. </wbr>    sankakucomplex  Are you fucking serious        What's wrong with sankaku? I find it better than gelbooru and dan no fucking loli seach booru     Rub loli while sleeping    mecha/tsundere/yuri   ... shota       I love fatalpulse.    rub loli  cunny ?    With muh dick while she sleeps     Tummy     I wish to squeeze the cunny with my thumb and index finger and drink the delicious apple juice that drips from the cunny.    Yes, please.      Loli adventurers sound fun as fuck.    I too want aussie translation. Such a cruel teaser.    Oh shit dude    Squeeze the vulva !   Man these loli threads are filled with autistic sheeple   how have i need seen this picture before. Awesome.      sheeple     Bitch pls    i suddenly have an intense craving for applejuice   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127105471  http://exhentai.org/g/826203/68cef6<wbr>24d5/</wbr>   g'night /l/  Red Wizard of Thay.    providing sauce for dead people      giving sauce to normies     Curious, do you guys know these off by heart or do you have some magic reverse search that works for partial images? Thanks, by the way.  I-I'm not dead!  Forgive me for not having the entirety of sad panda downloaded and playing on my wall of computers.          ban evading     Oh my that's spooky.   Thinking of the future generations of anons looking at cropped images in the archive. This abides by my principles.   Google works differently for everybody. When in doubt, check sadpanda's frontpage.           Genki tomboy.    ban evading   doesn't know how to search for sauce   is probably a literal cocksucking spermlord          I expected him to ask about the panda, at least he didn't.    Your mistakes are your own to make, tripfag.    They didn't even give me a warning. I'm sorry, I never realised I was supposed to start a thread on /r/, post the same images, and hope the people here, who clearly know what it is, just happen to see the other thread, which is, again, on a different board. I'm working on a partial image recognition suite, I hope it to be done soon. For now, I suffer the shame.        &gt;doesn't know how to search for sauce  No, and I'd love to know how I could. Reverse search turned up nothing, unless there's a better service I don't know of, and they didn't hint at, wait, shit. Look up duplicate posts on the archive, right? Fuck me I'm dumb.         Thinking of the future generations of anons looking at cropped images in the archive. This abides by my principles.  Giving sauce to any random normstain who is just stopping by for a guiltfap isnt propper form. You realize these types of newfolks are likely hypocrites who haet lolicons/these thread, right?    Shh...   loli is sleeping      Dont worry about it.  Everyone's asked for sauce at some point.     I can handle the blame, it's part of being a tripfaggot.   Best advice is to lurk more. You can't look up something on the archive when it is the first time being posted.   And when do you suggest it is proper form? This event will repeat it's cycle until who knows when. The archive exists for a reason.  It depends on him on how he would react to the source, but it's not fair to assume all newfolks are generally the same hypocrites and shitposters we know in these threads. It's not about defending the anon, but we're all newfags once.            You should put her to bed. Lolis need to sleep comfortably.     That's a creature.    Wet    They are very sensitive to sound. Make sure to stay very very quiet.        Here's an interesting idea, we should make a natural park for creatures. That way they can roam free without any fear in a natural environment.  And tourist could come and watch those beautiful creatures from afar/      They have those. They are called "play grounds"    You guys sure are assuming a lot about me.    Murderous psychopath lolis are the best.    Hm. A creature park sounds like a great idea.  ...until they escape their environment and go on a deadly rampage.      Then obviously we build walls to make sure they don't escape.  We wouldn't want them to damage the ecosystem.     Love the shit out of this   What the fuck filter did you abuse on that poor image.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1270991  It's a poster     Ranma x Shampoo  I like Akane but I agree they make a better couple for a number of reasons.     I hate ryoga when he's getting at akame smh    First post  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;1270991  (Dead) (You) The fuck!      Having Shampoo turn into a cat and having her grandmother telling her what to do fucked up her chances with Ranma forever.    There were at least three things that she did without her grandmother but that includes OP's pic related as well.  But yeah, Cologne thought up most of the shenanigans that Shampoo simply carried out. She's also the one that turned Shampoo into a cat. I wonder if she knows how hard she's sabitoshed her granddaughters chances at Ranma.      Ranma x Shampoo in the OP   Inb4   that one butthurt rabed Akanevagilest shits up the whole thread.   Also, Takahashi's artwork has turned to shit now.        Derpy looking Kyoko.    Rei on a crash diet.    Ataru doesn't even look like the same person.   Fucking hell. It's worse than I thought.        I wish there were more Ranma on Ranma fics. The only one I've ever read was one where Akane having a cousin named Ranko was a real thing but she ended up dying and Ranma ended up with Akane anyway.    We all knew it couldn't last forever. I just wish it had lasted a little longer. Comparing Rin-ne to her earlier works, it's almost like the whole point of the series is preparing herself for death.   It's too bad Rumiko decided to cut Akane's hair off. She could have given Shampoo a run for her money back then, at least in the looks department.   That was never going to happen. Rumiko has short hair and Akane was a blatant author-insert.     What's with sudden interest in Ranma on /a/  did Inuyasha Final Act on Cartoon Network just ended?       Isn't she only 57 though?    I liked it better when she looked like Mousse.    Somebody made a Ranma thread a few months ago and a bunch of us oldfag Ranma fans who have liked the series since before 4chan existed came crawling out of the woodwork. Having the threads at night keeps the summerfags away since it's past their bedtimes.    The Ranma interest has been going on for about three or so months now: off and on.   So why does everyone hate Ryoga's girlfriend Akari?   We're all raging Shampoofags or Ukyofags and think he should have stuck with Ukyo or Akane.    Most would have preferred she used an already existing character that far into the manga instead of introducing a new character to be a love interest.    Thats not even close to why people hate her. They hate her because she's a mary sue character.  Akari   Extremely Adorable/Pretty   Comes out of nowhere   Instantly in love with the MC or one of the MC's   Has no character flaws   Literally created to be "X's" love interest and is a perfect fit with said person.           Ranma is a Harem Gender-bender Takashi won't let the Girls on the Harem settle for anyone outside of the MC. So Ryoga didn't have a shot with any of the left overs, that's why she gave him his own Love interest    There was that one girl from one of the anime fillers who was better than Akari and who was created before Akari was too.  I wish Takahashi had just incorporated her and her father instead of making some shitty watered down manga counterpart.     A ranma thread where the OP is ShampooxRanma?   No Ryoga, Akane, or Ukyofags shitting it up?  What is this devilry.       Viz's BD/DVD releases, plus the newbies buying up the 2-in-1 manga volumes.    Speaking of that scene:  https://www.fanfiction.net/s/853423<wbr>5/1/The-Red-thread-of-Fate</wbr>      See, everything was going great until you brought it up. Nice job, ass.    Cut that out.     https://www.fanfiction.net/s/85342<wbr>35/1/The-Red-thread-of-Fate</wbr>   mfw hardly any good Ranma fics being written recently   Is it finally dead?       But Ryouga is obviously best guy in the series and Ukyo is obviously best girl. Ranma is a prick who'll beat on the weak to feed his own ego and Shampoo is not only batshit insane, but also dumb as a brick.       Sakura looks like Rei Heino   Ataru is just an anime protagonist   Shampoo's black haired.        you now realize Shampoo was always meant to have black hair      Go fuck off somewhere and die.     She always did in the manga. Shampoo and Onna-Ranma having technicolor hairdos was something you'd see in cover art (and varied from one to the next). The anime did it just so viewers on shitty VHS and fuzzy broadcasts could tell the girls apart more easily.     Ranma is a prick who'll beat on the weak to feed his own ego and Shampoo is not only batshit insane, but also dumb as a brick.  Nice headcanon faggot     That artist draws the best Ucchans.     ad hominem   That last refuge of the Shampoofag to waive off the canon fact that she's fucking crazy and retarded.        Oh look, it's that Akane faggot from two thread ago. Hear to spread your butthurt about Shampoo and fuck up another thread I see.       Shampoo fags and Akane fags actually getting along with the rest of the fanfags and having a nice talk about the actual content.   In comes this shitposting cunt and immediately starts blaming Shampoofag for anons calling him out on his shit.  Well, this thread was nice while it lasted.         Ataru is just an anime protagonist   Honestly, that's the greatest tragedy.        There's actually a resurgence of Spanish-language Ranma fanfics on FF.net, and the new manga releases will stir up some interest, but ultimately if you want to keep the flame alive you have to carry the torch yourself.  I'm planning out a post-Saffron divergence where Cologne decides to change her approach, and it pays off.      I wish there was at least one good legitimate Ranma/Street fighter fanfiction.  Shampoo vs Chun Li Ranma vs Ryu Ryoga vs Ken         The best thing about fanfiction is that anybody can write it...Even YOU! :3     I came across it in my backlog a few weeks ago. I came to /a/ to spam my thoughts on it and to bloat these threads.   Kodachi a best     There may have been, back in the deep dark days of the rec-arts-anime bbs. God knows people were doing Ranma crossovers every goddamn day on that thing. Good luck finding them now, though.  I do vaguely recall one fic referencing Ryoga's dad being Dan Hibiki.      I'm not a very good write fag though.      She's not a best but definitely a pretty.    I like that it was a new character. It shows that there are more fish in the sea. It's not good to be fixated on a girl when you only know 5 girls.    Whoa there. Ukyofag here, and I wouldn't wish Ryoga on her. Not good for her sanity.     Good luck finding them now, though.  Google is doing a complete replay of Usenet with a thirty year delay on Google Groups, so once they hit the early 90s we'll have access to them.        You just need to practice.    Ukyo is obviously best girl you dumb faggots  I wish there was a Ranma Kai remaster so I could bear watching this whole dumbass show though     She knows how to handle him. He's no threat to her sanity.    No she lets lost all her rage on him everytime he gets her lost.  It would be horrible match.      The only time that's ever been a factor, they won the race. You're clearly not paying attention.    Being repeatedly forced to beat him unconscious as well as terminal exasperation from his relative incompetence.    Nope it happened in the Tunnel of Lost love too     Ryoga's a hardworking dumb hunk, but not too dumb. A lot of girls dig that.   If he put his work ethic to something productive and moved up from hobo status, he would attract quite a few laddies.       He'd be gone most of the time, and it's not like she needs him around to run the business. The arrangement wouldn't even be a hardship for her.   I watched maybe the first 30 episodes of this a long time ago. I'm an adult now. Should I go back and watch it, or would it suck fat dick?   As a 26 yo manchild living in my mothers basement: I think it's great. And I hate 94% of anime.    Look anon, I'll agree that Ukyo is a better choice then Akane or fucking Akari but Ryoga is almost everything Ukyo detests in a compatible male.     Sounds like it's perfect for me, thanks anon     The animation "quality" leaves much to be desired (though the OVAs have held up well), but the nostalgia's a nice rush.   Wrong, the only time Ryoga got lost in the Tunnel was when he was with Akane, not with Ukyo.       I think Ukyo might be bi. I can see her splashing water on Ranma halfway through sex just to change things up.     Viz's BD/DVD releases   How does it compare to the Japanese JDM market bluray that came out in 2012?      Eh, I'm not much for nostalgia. Does the story actually go anywhere or is it just 170 episodes of "will they or won't they" "when will he wear down her tsundere shell"   is the anime worth watching?   Honestly all four of the main harem girls are probably bisexual.  Akane begins the series shouting I HATE MEN and fighting off perverts every day, and is a tomboy   Ukyo is a crossdresser that passes as male in a Japanese high school   Shampoo is from a matriarchal warrior culture and can mop the floor with any of her fellow villagers her own age   Kodachi is a brain-bent psycho who goes to an all girls school         Dude are you seriously this stupid? He gets her lost after they get out of the tunnel.    It's true that the fandom is nowhere near as prolific as it used to be. But there's still a gem every so often, especially if you don't mind crossovers. The Dark Lords Ascendant for example.    Such as? Apart from his obsession with Akane, his loyalty is unquestionable. He's more than capable of beating Ukyo in a fight and has done so in the past, has been her ally several times despite her being in the driver's seat for plotting dirty tactics he normally would never go with, and their respective agendas throughout the series never conflicted directly. I mean, ultimately, what does Ukyo see in Ranma apart from Genma's past bullshit promise that Ryoga doesn't fulfill without half the suitor drama Ranma brings to the table? It's not as though Ukyo's wet dream about a stay-at-home husband would apply to Ranma, either. I won't even go into detail about how similar their lives have been.  The facts are simple: Ranma's caused more damage to Ukyo's life than Ryoga ever would or could, yet Ukyo still fixates on Ranma because of past shit, and even after it's all said and done it's not like Tsubasa or Konatsu offer her anything more than Ranma or Ryoga could aside from tips for crossdressing.  tl;dr Takahashi fucked up what could have potentially been a great and sensible relationship to throw in garbage-level characters for no reason that lack any compatibility with either Ryoga or Ukyo beyond one-dimensional traits that aren't solid foundations for relationship anyway.        There's also the works of Vimesenthusiast, which is apparently him putting on a headset and using Dragon to voice-write 20k-words-per-chapter monsters. The quality is all over the place as a whole, but his Macross and Game of Thrones crossovers are top notch.    This would be the part you're referring to? Enjoy being #rekt and get the fuck out of here.    I know several bi girls, from my experience I think the possible candidates are  Akane: at the begining of the series she was man hating and may have been open to experimentation with girls, not truly bi imo, more of a phase   Ukyo: likes taking a masculine role among other females. Loves Ranma in either form.   Nabiki: I don't know, I just think she is   Kodachi could be bi. She's always using an over-the-top persona, so her true personality is a bit of a mystery   Ranma could be bi. You know why.   Not bi:  Shampoo: Hates female Ranma, has shown no interest in other girls. Very girly even though she's a psycho killer   Ryoga is just confused by Ranma's hawt bewbs             Ryoga vs Ranma  no bullshit gimmick arena   no water sources available, hot or cold   both are at full power with all the techniques they've learned at the end of the manga     Akane just died in front of them  Who would win?         The animation "quality" leaves much to be desired   Only episodes 1-18 and the OVA's are well polished in my opinion.      The movies aren't terrible, either, but yeah, pretty much once "season 1" was done, the animation got sent over to a Korean sweatshop or something and the suffering is just bad.    Ranma wins but gets roughed up in the process.    The rest is pretty ok, especially from that era and the type of show. There are definitely some noticeable budget scenes, but they don't interfere with the content of the show for the most part.    Ranma destroys Ryoga in any fair fight. If Akane died, they would both break down sobbing and be unable to fight.    Ranma unseals the yamasenken and chops Ryoga into tiny little pieces.    So, business as usual then?   where were you when the elderly started posting on /a/   Already here before /a/ ever existed. This is our world, the kiddies just work here.    Underage tripfag pls go.     I was here when you were still a sperm in your daddy's testicles, son.     He already attracts a laddie. By the name of Ranma. Spelling errors aside, he's probably best as the type of dad who sends money, presents, and video packages home. Alternatively, putting him as an anti-piracy guard on an oil-rig or a ship would mitigate his weakness.     laddie   Nice catch.      Easy grandpa, I'll get you your medicine and imported Lum garage kits just don't break a hip trying to upload your newest Ranma fic    Looking at it that way, I've come a long way  and still wasted away anyways      As do we all...You're pretty wise for a child your age.    One of the recently taken pictures     I was here when you were just an egg in your mother's ovary while she was in your grandma's womb.     double dubs     Jii-sama please do not overexert yourself thinking about ancient harems and geocities    Geocities?! I was coding in ones and zeros back in the day.   Actually just 34, but felt like one-upping the sperm gramps.       Imported Lum merch actually sounds really nice, and I'm not ready to upload it yet, I'm still tweaking a fight scene.     34   Oh, how sweet! It's me, your own long-lost grandfather!      gender bending thread turns into hardcore Ranma 1/2 thread    Yeah dude you and the rest of the fossils are ancient comparatively  Like old anime threads are just old anime threads but Ranma threads are Jurassic Park with all the dinosaurs roaming around       I saw Jurassic Park at the theatre when it first came out. :3     More importantly though, you don't know who's a wizard once you reach this age category.    The only good gender bender anime.     Just for fun, what do you consider an old anime  Rustle my 30 year old jimmies        tfw you recognised most of the shout-outs in Jurassic World and also wondered why they didn't put an "in memoriam" for Sir Richard Attenborough.     Not him, but I have memories of running home from school to make it in time to catch Force Five on a tv that didn't have a remote.    Fate/stay night UBW     "in memoriam" for Sir Richard Attenborough.  I think they had a scene about it but they cut it out. Don't know why.    Nothing happens.   Maison is the only one of Takahashi's works that's really a must read.     Only if you want to fall asleep.    I had a friend in another state from a listserv, and we'd rent anime from blockbuster, copy it, and mail each other the VHS tapes.    See, definitely an old folks home, you have old farts with Alzheimer's forgetting that basically nothing happens unless it involves Godai furthering himself     Are there genderbender manga out there where the genderbent mc doesn't have superpowers and gets his own reverse harem?    I was first introduced to Ranma 1/2 by renting the VHS from BlockBuster. It was the OVA An Akane to Remember.   That was the reason why I liked her so much at first. After that, I rented all of season 1 and still liked her and her long hair. It wasn't until I got to watching the rest and reading the manga that I realized how annoying she and Ranma were as a couple.      Hurr-durr I'm a child with a limited attention span that can't pay attention to anything that doesn't involve fightan    ranma and akane are both shit and deserve each other  black rose is insane  shampoo just has weird customs  ukyo is a miracle         Just last year, while clearing old clothes from my home, we found a shirt that I could not have worn past the age of two. On it was a robot and the name "Groyzer". And I have never seen an episode of it in my life.    Maison is overrated as fuck. One-Pound Gospel was basically the same story only told shorter and better. And this isn't a Takahashi general thread, so you and your goggles can go fuck off.    It's episodic but that's inaccurate to say. Lots of development with Kyoko being a widow, Mitaka and Kozue, to some extent.    Groyzer X?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groiz<wbr>er_X</wbr>       Maison is overrated as fuck.  Not him but how is it overrated? Not many people even know about it anymore and it's got the best ending out of all the Takahashi manga.     That's the one. I looked it up after finding the shirt. Will probably have to watch/read it at some point, given that I see Go Nagai's involved with it. At this point, my backlogs are starting to look like a timber yard.   The cool kids strike back.     YAMERO JA NAI  YUGO DA      Shun finally gets to talk next episode. I wonder what he's gonna say after that.    RR  Ruri Revolution~      Ruri Falcon when? Yuya can't just hog all the waifucards.   What manga do you think has the best art, /a/?  I absolutely loooove Kentaro Miura's art. It is just crazy good.      I was just expressing the way I felt about a certain topic   Do you also squeal in excitement when eating shortcakes, you little queer? Your father must be severely disappointed in you. Stop posting on /a/ while wearing a skirt, too.       he thinks that I browse and post in /soc/   he misused the words land whale  Wow, you're really stupid. You seriously just came to this thread just to shitpost.      Dude shortcakes are the shit   This thread derailed quite fast.    post like a little faggot   wonder why I'm being called a cock /soc/ker  If not /soc/, there's also /r9k/, /lgbt/, /hm/, and /mlp/. Which one's your favorite?   &gt;misused the words land whale  Look in a mirror, landwhale.        What's the worst anime you've ever seen?   This.     Reign: The Conqueror.   No, it's 3/10 because it's a terrible anime. Should I rank everything that's not literally a slideshow 6+?    Escaflowne   Just marathoned this after seeing the thread the other day.  Holy shit my heart. Why is every harem member so good?      Koutarou   horseshit   Were we watching the same show       You didn't like MC with balls and common sense together? What's wrong with you?       playing to be retarded   Good MC  He's nowhere dense like any protag, but he's fully aware about what's happening and decided to keep himself low because muh status quo.           Not him but I cringed when they just buried him in the sand and played whack the melon with him. He's better than most MCs, but he's not Arata-levels of awesome.       How's that horseshit? You're also aware that every other invader is also trying to keep the status quo right?  No?  Well then.       Apparently I heard in the original version of Spopovich vs Videl, Spopovich kicks her teeth out or something. I noticed a lot of dubs have this fight edited but I wanna find the original.  Where do I find the original animefriends?      a lot of dubs  Like this one?     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=J8p<wbr>sgbpFR3I</wbr>  [ ] none of the teeth actually fall out, but her mouth and nose bleed after getting a couple knees to the face     cheers anon    I felt so bad for Videl watching this fight.  She had just started to get strong and her first opponent ended up being the guy who can't really die.      And thus she was reduced to a shitty useless side character since   1 page thread    It's by Dowman Seiman. Go from there.      Maybe the Mermaid DNA in Goat-kun's cum slowed her aging when he came inside her     new chapter when?     </blockquote>]
