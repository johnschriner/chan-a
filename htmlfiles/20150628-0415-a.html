[ Are you ready? UtaPri!  <br>is this a good anime to watch if you're a straight man?</br>  Is that a serious question?  This season was nothing but disappointments, but I still don't want it to end.  <br>Agreed. I don't know if I should hope that the last episode will be good.</br>  So CG in the performance or wonky animation like Quartet Night got?  <br>In all honesty? I'd rather go with CG than QUALITY noodles.</br>  <br>Camus looks like he's standing on Ai's foot. Is this the worst quality to come from UtaPri?</br>  <br>This shot is a contender, too. Those tiny T. rex arms, man.</br>  IT'S TIME<br><br>I wouldn't say nothing but, I won't forget the deserved solo senpai time.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o2E<wbr>G3CX2SSs</wbr>  [ ]<br>The whole thing is gold, but the relevant part starts at around 2:50.</br>    I'm the sexiest.<br><br>I liked that end of the world wind howling.</br></br>    Why didn't you protect her smile?  She didn't deserve it.  <br>Kumiko a shit. A SHIT.</br>  <br>Kumiko deserve hapiness. <br>All UFOs deserve happiness, exept Ribbon.</br></br>  <br> exept Ribbon <br>Ribbon deserves happiness too, anon. She was just trying to make her senpai's dreams come true.</br></br>  The ending to the anime will be something like this:<br><br> Reina: I love you Taki-sensei <br> Taki-sensei: I don't know if I can ever love again after losing my wife, and I'm sure your feelings are just a schoolgirl crush. <br> Reina: No they aren't! I truly love you! <br> Taki-sensei:If you still feel the same way in 10 years, I will marry you. <br> 10 year timeskip <br> The day of Reina and Taki-sensei's wedding <br> Taki-sensei is 44 and Reina is 26 <br> The Kitauji High School band comes back together to play songs for the wedding <br> Kumiko and Shuichi's children are members of the audience <br> Final shot of the anime is Taki-sensei princess carrying Reina away for their honeymoon <br><br>Calling it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because crying anime girls is my fetish.</br>  <br>Responding to you from the last thread, it wouldn't be in Taki's character to make that sort of promise, as it's not one he can reasonably keep. He would have to not date anyone for 10 years.</br>  <br>Hmm... I didn't consider that, anon... shoujo endings often ignore that kind of thing in favor of creating a touching story, though, so it's okay.</br>  <br>Hibike isn't really shoujo and nothing about it would indicate such a silly ending to the series.</br>  <br>Maybe not from Kumiko's perspective, but Hibike has been nothing but a shoujo for Reina</br>  BD Vol 1 has subs now. Also pic related  <br>I worry about you sometimes Taki shipper.<br> It'll still end in Narita divorce. </br></br>  <br>Fuck off you fujoshit, and rot away with FujoAni, you both seem to hate small girls just alright.</br>  <br>Reina's love is the greatest one.</br>  <br>A better question is why is the drama so forced.<br><br> SO... THIS IS WHAT SHE FELT THAT DAY!!! KUYAASHIIIIIIIII!! NOW I TRULY UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELS REINA!! NOW GIVE ME YOUR SOUND! EUPHONIUM! <br><br>Come the fuck on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Episode 2 Eyecatch</br>  <br>What? I didn't think it was forced at all. We've had like 4 goddamn episodes of build up where Kumiko was shown admiring Reina more and more, and now she's realizing that she's becoming more like Reina. Makes total sense.</br>  <br>Its bait anon.</br>  <br> smug faggotts </br>  <br> I'll marry you if you can get into Tokyo University <br> Reina hasn't been studying at all, only playing the trumpet  <br>Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I was being pretty serious. These fucking girls overthink everything too fucking much.<br><br> NEE-CHAN QUIT EUPHO...? WHY!? SHE LOVED EUPHO!! SHOULD I QUIT IT TOO?? NO... I LOVE EUPHO AND KUYASHIIIIIIIIII <br><br>Everything is forced. The drama more than anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> even more smug and now staring right at me </br>  You'll never be a 34 year old teacher with this cutie lusting after your dick and hand in marriage.<br><br>Assuming you wait until she graduates, that'll be 36 and 17 years old respectively. <br><br>19 years old age difference, back of the net. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Taki is one lucky son of a bitch.<br>Also Reina is 16, so Taki would be 35.</br></br>  Like a dream  <br>Do you really not see the parallels between Aoi, Kumiko, and Kumiko's sister, or are you actually just baiting?</br>  <br>She played trombone though. <br>Anyway, I can understand the dilemma. Why be in band when you're not going to do anything with it in the future? Studying would be more useful. In the last episode she's seemed to have resolved that she's in it because she indeed loves playing the euphonium. She's not in it because she admired her sister or had nothing better to do, she loves to play music and that's reason enough to be in band.</br></br>  What happened to her smile again? I'm pretty sure that the situations established at the beginning of the episode were resolved at the end of the episode.  <br>Hey bud, guess what. It's an anime series based on a book series aimed at teenage girls. Go watch Death Note or something if you want something a little more intellectually stimulating.</br>  <br><br>Middle schooll band drama, Sister giving up band, and Shuichi calling her ugly.</br></br>  <br> ep 13 starts <br> kumiko wakes up <br> its the morning of her middle school competition <br> with newfound passion and creative spark she's able to take her school to the next round.  <br> her and Reina hagu after getting the real gold <br> "lets become special" <br> quick reconciliation with Shuichi before she's welcomed home by her sister </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And this is what disappoints me: all you want is void entertainment, you don't want something that'll make you think. At the end of the day, all you want if your fucking cute little girls doing cute shit.</br>  <br><br> Shuichi calling her ugly. <br><br>He never apologize didnt he? What a dick.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He is indeed a total weiner.</br></br>  <br>Oboe looks deeper in despair.</br>  That was painful to watch. Too much tears in this show.  <br>bwuaaha</br>  <br>I like how you responded to the guy who basically said "it's just stupid don't worry about it" instead of the other two who actually answered your question.</br>  <br>TYBKA</br>  <br><br><br>The anime skipped his apology to make Kumiko pissy about him.</br></br></br>  Better stomp the fuck out of him.  <br><br>Remember when Shuichi lightly punched Kumiko on the back for ignoring him? Yup Motherfucking parallels man.</br></br>  <br>Makes me think they intentionally altered his scenes for this.</br>  <br>When was that again?</br>  <br>I remember Kumiko is having in trouble with her fingering, and is walking around like a crazy person playing the air euphonium. Pretty sure its right before he asks her to festival.</br>  kyoani will never have a better MC  <br>They remade Kyon once, they can do it again.</br>  <br>Railway station.</br>  yfw Episode 13 ends with "So the next piece begins" with a focus shot on Oboe-chan as someone calls her by name  Hibike:<br>#3: 中野 (Nakano ___)<br>#7: 高橋 沙里 (Takahashi Sari)<br>#27: 石上 (Ishigami _____)<br>#26: 野口 (Noguchi _____) &lt;--- Is she related to Hideri?<br>#57: 臼井 (Usui)<br>#60: ___ 川 ___子 (___kawa ____ko)<br>#42: 日 ___ 子 ____ (Nichi____ ___ko)<br>#49: 古木 のぞみ (Furuki Nozomi)<br>#21: Yoshizawa Akiko<br>#17: Kabe Tomoe<br><br>Sorry guys.

There'll be names all over the place.</br>  <br>That's why its threads have so much deep, insightful discussion going on, right?</br>  <br>Woah dude, no need to be rude. This person and their friend took a lot of time to translate these names.</br>  <br>She spoke in episode 11. It's possible some seiyuufag could recognize her.</br>  <br><br>I like how Shuichi and Kumiko scenes are subtle and well done.</br></br>  <br>It could be, but the constant yuri-baiting cheapens the experience.</br>  <br>There's 0 correlation between what /a/ threads are like and what shows are like.</br>  <br> took a lot of time <br>No wonder they did such a great job. It shouldn't "take a lot of time" to read names.</br></br>  <br>Translation: "I don't like yuri."</br>  <br>Really? I don't think I've ever heard #57 talk before.</br>  <br>I like yuri though, this is yuri baiting.</br>  <br> read names <br>There's a difference between translating and reading. I'm pretty sure the former takes more time to do.</br></br>  <br>This happens all the time. Whether the show is good or bad, if it has a lot of people interested in it a lot of back-to-back threads will be made. People run out of things to talk about. Then people talk about nothing/shitpost/argue over stupid things. This is why generals are so looked down upon. Even so, if a thread exists people will want to come and hang out.</br>  <br>Show: two girls become close because they understand and admire eachother, with a bit of playful flirty stuff occasionally mixed in because they're teenagers.<br><br>/a/: Fucking yuri-baiting, kyoani lost their way.<br><br>Why is erotic lust the only kind of love /a/ understands?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never heard of a seiyuu with the surname Noguchi before.

Maybe later.</br>  <br>Not him but if a show throws yuri hints with no intent whatsoever to have the two in question have feelings for each other for the purpose of appealing to viewers then yes, I can see why some would feel their intellect was insulted. <br><br>I remember reading that the creators wanted to make something like Chihayafuru and I think they could have gotten a lot closer to that feeling if they weren't pandering, or a at least tried to be subtle about it.</br></br></br>  <br>He's right though.</br>   MUH TEAMMATES   <br><br>Hopefully this will help, anon<br><br>#3: 中野 蕾実 (Nakano Tsubomi)<br>#7: 高橋 沙里 (Takahashi Sari)<br>#17: 加部 友恵 (Kabe Tomoe)<br>#21: 吉沢 秋子 (Yoshizawa Akiko)<br>#26 (Seiyuu): 野口 (Noguchi)<br>#27 (Seiyuu): 石上 (Ishigami)<br>#32: 堺 万紗子 (Sakai Masako)<br>#33: 加山サキ (Kayama Saki)<br>#37: カマヤ ツバメ (Kamaya Tsubame)<br>#38: 福井 (Fukui)<br>#39: 赤松 (Akamatsu)<br>#42 (Seiyuu): 日笠 陽子 (Hikasa Youko) <br>#49 (Seiyuu): 古木 のぞみ (Furuki Nozomi)<br>#50: 植田 日和子 (Ueda Hiyoko)<br>#52: 田中須加美 (Tanaka Suka bi?

They'll probably even have Reina encourage Kumiko instead. She already did it during auditions.</br></br>  <br>They'll probably make a scene to bait out reactions which gets misunderstood that Reina was jealous of Taki for spending time with Kumiko.</br>  <br>End scene being the flower bulb in Kumiko's room blooming and being a lily.</br>  <br>Or a yellow rose.Flower language for friendship.</br>  <br> yuri bait <br>but Reina had her hands on Kumiko, she couldn't stop hugging her. Also pic related.</br></br>  <br>Pic related is subtext, not bait.</br>  <br> Given literally everything else in all three novels prior where we're given Kumiko's POV, there's nothing that hints she has any feelings for him more than friendship outside of one vague line in the epilogue for novel 3 <br><br>Kumiko's reaction to Hazuki and Shuuichi's date in novel 1:<br><br> "Hazuki-chan's been like that for a while now." <br><br> Sapphire lowered her voice as she responded. <br> "She's going to the festival with the person she likes today. And she's planning to confess to him." <br><br> "Oh man, youth on full display! Gives me heartburn just hearing about it!" <br> Natsuki's face clearly twisted. Her voice was pretty loud, but Hazuki gave no reaction. Somehow, she couldn't hear a thing. <br><br> That "person she likes" was no doubt Shuuichi. In an attempt to turn her attention away from the conversation, Kumiko let out a small sigh. She felt a little sick. As if something in her stomach was bubbling up, a muddy sort of feeling began to well up inside her. And as if it was able to course though every one of her veins, the feeling began to spread throughout her body. As if in an attempt to cool the fever that had accumulated in her fingertips, Kumiko gripper her euphonium tightly. I don't like this. I really don't. She couldn't quite explain why, but the thought simply drifted through her mind. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JUST<br> ;_; </br></br>  We all desire to get good. <br><br><br>No, you stupid mong, the whole river practice and bridge scene is a lead up to the cheering up scene.<br><br>Fucking cock mongler, get your head set straight. Fucking communists. <br><br><br>A good thing Shuichi turned down Hazuki. A true capitalist only strives for true love.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> A true capitalist <br>What?</br></br>  <br>A true capitalist indeed.</br>  <br><br>Kyoani will always find a way to insert yuri bait even if it's at the expense of other characters.</br></br>  <br> Fucking communists <br> A true capitalist <br><br>anon are you ok</br></br></br></br>  <br>So Natsuki and Asuka speak Kansai-ben in the novels? Can't remember hearing any Kansai-ben in the anime.</br>  <br>Yes they dropped it unfortunately.</br>  <br>I remember reading somewhere that everyone except Kumiko speaks Kansai-ben, since she's a filthy immigrant.</br>  <br>That would be fucking hell to do in the anime.</br>  <br>Northern voice actors have done kansai-ben before though, it's not exactly impossible.</br>  <br>What I mean is having 1-2 characters is fine, but everyone expect MC speaking in Kansai-ben looks weird to me.</br>  <br>But they're in Kansai. Do you also find it odd for e.g. Irishmen to speak with Irish accents?</br>  <br>Waiting anxiously for another anime to go full Saki.</br>  <br>Well fair enough. It's just that I don't remember a anime where the whole cast speaks in Kansai-ben.</br>  <br>It's not like it'd be that weird, lovely complex did something similar with a different accent iirc.</br>  <br> unfortunately. <br>You mean fortunately.</br></br>  <br> Waiting anxiously for another anime to go full Saki. <br>A bunch of kanto actresses faking accents?</br></br>  <br>No, I think it's sex</br>  <br>You bet. Fake accents in a language I can't understand are my favorite.</br>      <br><br>Sasuga Kyoani.<br><br> At least change the file name, faggot </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> maximum yuribait <br> tumblr <br>Sasuga.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>Can't see kumifeet due to shit scan.<br>Fix this.</br></br>  <br>Reina sharing her skincare routine to help a girl out</br>  <br><br><br>Why can't they just make them the official pair? Fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that'd be gay.</br>  <br>Because KyoAni is not filled with raging homosexuals. Hopefully. </br>  Those two really have the most awkward friendship.  <br>Because Reina loves Taki-sensei.</br>  <br>They are in your heart, Anon.</br>  <br>The more I see promo art featuring Reina and Kumiko getting intimate, the more I get mad at Kyoani for not having the guts to ship them. I really hope they reconsider after all the positive feedback from the fans and make a S2 with them as the end pairing.</br>  Is that lip gloss she's putting on her?  <br> no regrets <br>Shine on, you crazy diamond.</br></br>  <br>Its just bait, but I do think the animators likes drawing them together.</br>  <br> the animators <br>Yeah, because they're definitely the ones in control of what gets drawn.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it will very likely happen.<br>Hetfags are on the wrong side of history.</br></br>  <br> character does something I disagree with and doesn't do what I wanted/expected them to <br> wow what a shit character <br>I bet you hated Yura too you mongrel.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this a real tweet? I won't be fooled by your lies, internet.</br>  <br><br>I know it's bait and that's why I'm upset. They compliment each other so well, Reina is the reason why Kumiko starts liking music again. They inspire and encourage each other. It all makes sense. Replace Shuichi with a rock and the show would still be the same. They should have never added his character.</br></br>  Am I the only one who wants Shoeboy to win?  <br> https://twitter.com/Crunchyroll/sta<wbr>tus/614490471558033408</wbr> </br>   yuri show <br> no yuri <br><br>Why does KyoAni always do this to us?</br></br></br>  <br>The tweet is %100 real.</br>  <br>Technically everyone in Haruhi should speak Kansai-ben too.</br>  <br>His character does inspire her. Have you not watch the last episodes?</br>  <br> all that grease </br>  <br>Crunchyroll's twitter is a fool.</br>  <br>I like his interactions with GEH, they are cute and not kind of creepy like half of hers with Reina.</br>  <br>Time to die.</br>  <br>It's real but it's really just CR baiting a bit</br>  <br><br>No, it's Reina that inspires her. She's even the one she calls at the middle of the night to seek comfort. I will be angry if they suddenly make Kumiko like Shuichi at the final episode. It is shit writing and a fucking asspull.</br></br>  <br>Still not as bad as the "we did it!" when Free was announced.</br>  <br>It's like watching someone ignorant of everything behind the show and just watching it without posting in any discussions. They'd think it was gay and they'd be none the wiser to know it isn't. It's sort of pure, innocent, in its ignorance.</br>  <br>But she doesn't like Reina that way and she likes Taki anyway.<br>She was so fucking butthurt at him about what he said to her in their last year of middle school she even changed her hairstyle, that's love.</br></br>  <br>She will go to Tokyo Uni I'm sure.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit you cant possibly be real.</br></br>  <br>More legit than pretending she's in love with Reina or something.<br>Even the source material is against you.</br></br>  <br> She was so fucking butthurt at him about what he said to her in their last year of middle school she even changed her hairstyle, that's love. <br>I don't hate the shoe and I don't deny she ends up with him in the novels but that's retard logic</br></br>  <br>There's very few people left here on /a/ who still expect a yuri end, so there shouldn't be too much of a shitstorm when the anime ends here.<br><br>But I can only imagine how bad it's going to be everywhere else where everyone seems certain Kumiko and Reina are a couple.</br></br></br>  <br>Reina isn't the only one that inspired her though, seeing Shuuichi work hard also made Kumiko want to as well. Look I get being angry at the bait. But Kumiko does care about Shuuichi, he does inspire her. They are going to have their scene together next ep, maybe it will be romantic maybe not. But the episodes have been building up for them to reconcile their relationship in the final ep. Kumiko and Shuuichi don't get together until the end of the 3rd novel anyway.</br>  <br>Because it's nothing but shameless cheap bait.</br>  <br><br>Its an adaptation where they haven't been shy to change or ditch entirely the source material when it suited them. What matters is what's on the screen, and Reina is on screen with Kumiko a hell of a lot more than Shoe is, and in far more intimate situations.</br></br>  <br>You're right, this is much worse than that.</br>  As much as I hate to say this<br>Kumiko and Shuuichi as a couple is a given and pretty obvious, you have to be really delusional to still believe she might end up with Reina at this point, especially after the last episode</br>  <br>  Especially after the last episode <br>What the fuck are you talking about</br></br>  <br><br>I will lose respect for Kyoani if they make it romantic. There is no build-up, the attraction is one-sided and they don't even have good chemistry.<br><br>Also, I prefer if Reina confesses to Taki and he denies her early so that a Kumiko-Reina is possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one gives a shit about what you or anyone thinks.</br>  <br> Its an adaptation where they haven't been shy to change or ditch entirely the source material when it suited them. <br>On the contrary, it's an adaption where they HAVE been shy to ditch the source material. If they wanted to go anime original yuri, they never would've included the hints that Shu1 wants to get it on with Kumiko, nor Reina's Taki crush. When it comes down to it, they still tried to stay true to the spirit of the story as they well should.</br></br>  <br><br>Almost no one here thinks RxK will happen, but ShoexKumiko isn't "obvious" it's functionally undeveloped in the show.</br></br>  <br>Did you not see how Reina reacted when she heard Kumiko spent time with Taki-Sensei?</br>  <br> being this mad <br>it just won't happen, give up really</br></br>  <br>No one is deluded. People just prefer a ship. I don't think many even care about end game at this point.</br>  <br>are you blind or something?</br>  <br>Now that's just delusion.</br>  <br>to be fair that can be interpreted in many ways. and honestly you would have to be retarded if you think someone is stealing your crush even when they have shown no signs of being interested in them</br>  <br>Because you deserve to be blueballed for all eternity.</br>  <br>Because the only good thing about her is her disappointment voice</br>  <br>Kumiko deserves nothing</br>  <br><br> Almost no one here thinks RxK will happen <br><br>I think it's possible if there's another season. Kumiko-Reina sells they'll make the proper adjustments. Nobody literally cares about Shuichi. It would be great if they make Reina confess to Taki-sensei and gets rejected at the end of this season. I'd throw them all of my money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So she doesn't realize what she wants is right in front of her. She's a girl with a crush. Whatcha gon' do.<br><br> inb4 "but it's so much MOOOOOOOOORE" </br></br></br>  <br> to be fair that can be interpreted in many ways <br>Not really.<br>I'm sure some people grasping at straws would try to interpret it as Reina being jealous because Kumiko was with a man at night, but those are diehard shippers. Reina has never shown to be even remotely jealous over Kumiko being with other people, and it makes no sense in the context of their relationship.</br></br></br>  <br> The anime skipped his apology to make room for yuribait to get yuribucks <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br>Not even her own euphonium san?</br>  <br>What does that have to do with Kumiko and Shuichi</br>  <br>There are hints everywhere in the show, it's not as evident because Kumiko is still realizing her feelings</br>  <br>It means that the last episode clearly showed that Reina is still madly in love with Taki-Sensei and doesn't think of Kumiko as a possible love interest.</br>  <br>reina is just a schoolgirl with a crush, she probably wants to know if taki said anything about her. i mean who gets jealous over someone spending time with someone else even i they don't much care about them.<br>lets be honest that it wasn't that good of a scene anyway</br></br>  <br>There are a few small moments, but the two have only had two or three scenes with each other. Shu is underdeveloped as a character in general, and their relationship is almost nonexistent save for their past relationship.</br>  <br> actually believing KyoAni gives a shit about butthurt western fan response </br>  <br>At least the novel made it more obvious.</br>  <br>No, euphonium-san would be better with Amethyst</br>  <br>Everybody likes them, not just the west. Just look at pixie.</br>  <br>I wonder if we'll see Aoi in the audience.</br>  <br> i mean who gets jealous over someone spending time with someone else even i they don't much care about them. <br>Reina does.<br>Her entire personality can literally be summed up as "muh taki".</br></br></br>  <br>Novel 2 shows Reina depress because she thinks the new adviser is going out with Taki. Who is also Taki's friend from college. <br><br>I'm sorry but she gets jealous very easily, and can become yandere.</br></br></br>  <br>She'll have a ticket, stand outside the concert hall for a half hour, then walk home.</br>  <br> I wonder if we'll see Aoi in the audience. <br>She will most likely. She's Haruka's friend after all.</br></br>  <br> you will never see that being animated </br>  i honestly don't want shu to win the kumikobowl just because he's so undeveloped as a character. i mean what do we know about him, he's the worst trumpet player and he wants to improve. if they gave him some more development i wouldn't mind but if they get together it will be one hell of an asspull  <br>Good job cherry picking that last frame. Reina looks interested or concerned in that scene, not jealous, and the way the scene cuts out at the end is pretty clear evidence that nothing of note happens during it.</br>  <br>She even breaks her glass cup cause it makes her blood boil.</br>  <br>looks like she picked the wrong week as we have a defective Nagato that can't save her!</br>  <br> what is Class S? <br><br>being obsessed with genuine homosex or "queer representation" is a thoroughly western phenomenon<br><br>that's why you don't see Kyoani twitter fellate shibuya legislation, but CR twitter co-opting eupho to promote American gay marriage</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the joke <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> your head </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reina looks interested or concerned in that scene, not jealous, <br>Are you serious? She literally drops her wattle bottle, freezes for a few moments, then stops listening to what Kumiko is saying to make her talk more about what happened with Taki-Sensei.<br><br>What do you think was the point of this scene?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He plays trombone, and he's not that bad. He just started playing it. He swapped from french horn. <br><br>He has some development but I don't think Kumiko will get with him in this final episode. In the novel they only got together at the end of novel 3. I can only guess that there scene will just cause Kumiko to finally see him in a different light. You know see him as a boy not a friend.</br></br></br>  <br>She is about to join Kaori as a sinful Haibane.</br>  <br>I've read your post twice and I've come to the conclusion that I have no idea what you intended that response to mean.</br>  <br>ターキー？</br>  <br>I don't think these were small moments, you just need to see the look in her eyes when seeing Shuichi trying to get better, and how Kumiko reacted to Hazuki's confession to get how tsun she is<br>the yelling scene, and the river scene only make it even more obvious</br></br>  I can't believe people can deny the truth this goddamn hard.<br>The original source is goddamn exist, read it and end this useless debate already. Or ask the author directly or shit just DO something because this is getting annoying.</br>  <br> What do you think was the point of this scene? <br>Showing that she was surprised? Regardless, it's clear that this event probably isn't going to lead to any drama, otherwise it would have actually been focused on.</br></br>  <br> what is class S? <br><br>Something this board thinks about far more than any Japanese discussion I've seen ever has. A cute couple is a cute couple; nobody drawing the tons of Kumirei art is thinking about that in the slightest.</br></br></br>  <br> they don't even have good chemistry <br><br>You don't like the gehs anon?</br></br></br>  <br> You know see him as a boy not a friend. <br>I don't know what makes you think the story is heading this way.</br></br>  <br>yuri fanart on pixiv does not equate interest in actual lesbian couples is what it means<br><br>Class S is a concept among japs and not what westerners like you want<br><br>Kyoani is working within that concept and won't give you lesbians because neither they nor their fans actually give a shit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone knows about the source already, and they've all decided if they care or not too. This point is meaningless.</br>  <br>But didn't you hear anon, the author was forced by publishers to have a normal het ending. KyoAni is reworking the story to fit the original vision.</br>  <br>Kaori is a saint.</br>  <br>No, it was to show once again that she's completely obsessed with Taki-Sensei.<br><br>They can show her being concerned about Kumiko without the yandere vibes they use exclusively for Taki-Sensei.</br></br></br>  <br> yuri fanart on pixiv does not equate interest in actual lesbian couples is what it means <br>I guess you're right. There's nothing gay about the fanart at all, really.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why was the scene cut short?</br>  <br> hurr what is IRC fucking up the place <br> what are crossboarders shitposters from /v/  <br><br>Please anon, end yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why this whole damn thing is fucking retarded.<br><br>Source pls. I want actual source, something that really legit, coming from the author itself, nit baseless rumor from 2ch or 2chan.</br></br></br>  <br>God dammit, is the novel translated? My moonrunes level doesn't allow me to read kanji unless there's furigana</br>  <br>Kumiko wasn't tsun during the yelling scene. She was genuinely upset because of what happened in band. The River scene was more about how they are becoming friends again. Again they aren't gonna get together in the last episode. But they will fix their friendship and hopefully give a hint of Kumiko's feelings towards him.</br>  <br>But it wasn't? It clearly showed that she's still obsessed with Taki-Sensei. There was no need to make it any longer than it already was. They're not planning on making the next episode have some kind of drama between Kumiko and Reina.</br>  <br>stay salty but it won't change anything<br><br>Kyoani literally does not care for your queer crusade and they won't make them canon lesbians to satisfy western "progressives"</br></br></br>   Ribbons did nothing wrong   Guys could we stop the discussion for a moment to agree on the universal miracle that is Peace-chan?  <br> That's why this whole damn thing is fucking retarded. <br>No, because many have decided that they don't care about the source material. So they want other evidence to convince them.</br></br>  <br>You're so delusional you qualify as an Akibaranger.</br>  <br> you just need to see the look in her eyes when seeing Shuichi trying to get better <br>You're reaching.<br> and how Kumiko reacted to Hazuki's confession <br>Which never happened in the anime.<br> how tsun she is the yelling scene <br>There is no dere.<br> and the river scene only make it even more obvious <br>You're reaching. Again. In fact, isn't this the same reaching you did already?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Source pls. <br>Anon was being sarcastic. That's a rumor invented by butthurt yurifags who'll grasp at any straw to deny the reality in front of their eyes.</br></br>  <br> But it wasn't? <br>What? They literally cut the scene while the two are still talking.</br></br>  <br>who?</br>   mfw animesuki <br><br>I want to see these faggots bitch and whine by the end of the show.</br></br>  Can't wait for Kumiko Love Story movie, /a/  <br>Yes she did   she choosed to wear that ugly ribbon  </br>  <br>There is a difference to seeing a friend who is a guy, as either a friend or a boy. Once you start to see your friend as a boy and not a friend. It means you notice his looks and start to have feelings for him. It happens a lot between a girl and boy friendship. its the same in reverse when the guy starts to see his female friend as a girl.</br>  <br>The whole fanbase are just idiots.</br>  <br>The point of that scene was to show Reina's yandere tendencies for Taki-Sensei.<br>The point of that scene was not to have drama based on a misunderstanding. That's why the misunderstanding was resolved off-screen like five seconds later.</br></br>  <br> salty <br>Yes. Project more. Use buzzwords more. It feeds me.

The game has her quotes talking about multiple references to social conventions and graces that pre-date modern (WWII) era Japan like women walking three steps behind their men, and so forth.<br><br>Even her style of speech is made intentionally more archaic and traditional then how Kongou, Nagato, or Kaga speak in terms of terminology.

And I'm not saying Kongou isn't old factually or historically, but the game canon she's a young adult like her younger sisters.<br><br>And my logic with the other anon is since they get completely remodeled into battleships, maybe the devs decided that was enough reasoning to show they aren't old ladies in the game.<br><br>Two ship classes that get the most reconstruction, upgrades, and modernization in the IJN were the battleships and carriers.

Then there're the OP and ED lyrics for the movies which, when confirmed to be from MC's POV, written in accordance with the script are almost always blatantly and indisputably gay. To me it looks more like they show whatever they can, but their corporate laws will never allow them to go full gay.<br><br><br>Yes it's confirmed. Actually, if I'm not mistaken Sunrise is the property of Bandai, not the other way around, therefore it would be more accurate to say Bandai decided to split their intellectual properties between Sunrise (all it has left are gundams) and BNP which took everything else. Ozaki is the managing director of the company, and T&amp;B is said to be their flagship property. Sunrise only cared about gundams anyway, so having a separate company to manage other works seems like a favorable outcome. The only thing that worries me is that Tamura was left with Sunrise, and he is one of the five main creators of T&amp;B.<br>Here's the full list of what BNP took: http://www.bn-pictures.co.jp/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you and the anons that helped.<br>That was a very sad, disturbing, and arousing reading. As expected from Harada..</br></br>  <br> he also ended with a "and I'm counting on your imagination" bit <br>Who was it that gave the statement anyway?<br><br>I hope Sunrise whips up some new IPs soon. As much as I like Gundam they've burned themselves out with too much of it many times before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Feels pretty good, doesn't it?</br>  <br>They're going to burn out the Mai-Hime franchise next</br>  <br>Better that than more Cross Ange.</br>  <br> Who was it that gave the statement anyway? <br>Ozaki</br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>You take that back, Cross Ange was AOTY.<br><br><br>Natsuno loving him was canon, wasn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That guy looks ready for other activities rather than sleeping</br>  <br>Yes, things like cuddling and hair fluffing.</br>  <br>Does nobody remember that special anymore, where Kotetsu invited Barnaby to his house for a evening with champagne, got pissed that everyone else came because it was supposed to be just the two of them and admitted having wet dreams with what was intended to be a Barnaby look-alike?</br>  <br>Absolutely delicious. Thanks.</br>  <br>It's called pandering. Quit getting your hopes up and lying to yourself for nothing.</br>  <br> Cross Ange <br> AOTY </br></br>  <br>So when they show them fucking on screen that'll be pandering too? Gotcha.</br>  <br>Pandering is teasing without delivering.<br>Subtle shit is just bait.</br></br>  <br>You're a fucking saint anon.</br>  <br>I love you.</br>  This was way cuter and more funny than it had any right to be. Why hasn't this mangaka made more shit yet?  <br>dat ass</br>  <br>Kotetsu and Barnaby have done about everything a couple could do except kissing on screen, the show doesn't do romance stuff in general although their feelings were confirmed in numerous official sources.</br>  <br>You're too good to us, anon.</br>  <br>Anime when?<br> Timeskip incest doujins when? </br></br>  Asta/Juno doujins when? The pairing is basically Naruto/Saucegay and more.  <br> Pandering is teasing without delivering. <br>Pandering implies gratification or satisfaction. You can use it to describe many types of fanservice, but stop being retarded and thinking "without delivering" is part of the definition.</br></br>  <br>Sports anime are a gold mine for fujos.<br>  I have tons of ships in them. </br></br>  <br>If it happens my heart will finally be at ease.</br>  <br>There is a reason people throw around the 'pandering to fujos' line so much. Fujos do get gratification from the tease but that doesn't make the characters or the show actually homo. That is the point I'm trying to make.You are just arguing semantics. <br>I could exchange the word 'pandering' for 'bait' if that word is triggering you.</br></br>  <br>No 6 wasn't wildly popular.</br>  <br> Being a toddlercon <br>Anon no</br></br>  <br>I personally didn't enjoy No. 6 that much.

They don't really have the same purpose.</br>  <br>They're all the same. <br>Fan activities:<br> doujins <br> scanlation/translation/cleaning/re<wbr>drawing</wbr> <br> fanzines <br> fanfiction <br> fanmixing <br> AVs <br> fanart/drawfagging <br> gifing/webMing </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've always wandered what these thr... oh..<br>I'll be going now.</br>  <br><br>On it, thanks again.</br></br>  <br>I don't know what a fanzine or a fanmix is, but I wouldn't rank those all the same. Doujins, fanfiction and fanart all create original creative content, where the others are just modifications of the source material. However, for some reason fanfiction always seem to be exceptionally awful when compared to your average fanart or doujin. If there's talented artists in a fanbase, I don't understand why there's no talented writers. I was wondering if it was just an east vs. west thing. Most western fanart is awful, so maybe Japanese fanfiction is also better.</br>  <br>My heart hates you but my boner says thanks.</br>  <br>I rather enjoyed the manga no matter how stupid it got, but I could barely even sit through ~20 episodes of the anime. It's dated as fuck and horribly slow, for something that long I would just read the manga.</br>  <br>I'm going to watch this and hate myself.</br>  <br>Not really. With art you have to be able to reproduce the angles and positions of the face which is only possible if you do a shitton of practice (of real life figures and such) though I guess it's original in the sense that you can bring material which you've referenced into a piece and people who haven't seen those poses etc before believe that it is original (hence the /ic/ meme 'loomis' emphasing the need of all prospective artists to practice from life before stylisation.)<br><br>And fanfiction, I find that I am, more often or not, inspired from what I have already watched and/or read and the more I read the easier it is to think up a plot, though the inspiration may not have come from what I developed myself but from what I observed around me. <br><br>(Fanzines are fanmade magazines containing published fanfic and fannart and fanmixing is essentially finding songs which link to the fandom in question - arguably the easiest.)<br><br>Fanfics are more accessible than fanart in that you only need a word processor to produce something whereas with fanart basic tools such as MS Paint are inferior and more difficult to use than their counterparts like SAI and Photoshop which require additional learning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what it's made for.</br>  Not Kuroko tomorrow, right?  <br> Fanfiction writing whale blogging about fanfiction <br>Not surprised. Go back to wherever you came from, nobody cares about your badly written delusions.</br></br>  <br>But I still don't understand why it's impossible to find fanfiction that doesn't read like it was written by someone who isn't fluent in English or only has a third grade reading level, when there's so much beautiful and professional-looking fanart. If fanfiction is easier for people to produce then shouldn't there be enough people doing it that a least a couple of good ones fall through?</br>  <br><br>I'm going to watch this while I cry myself to sleep.</br></br>  <br>He was just answering some questions, no need to act so flustered. Though personally I agree. This is anime/manga and doujins are pretty much eastern fanfiction and should be the only fan fics talked about.</br>  <br>This looks almost illegally cute.<br><br>So is she his daughter or sister? Title made me think she was his daughter but the katakana say papa. I'm probably missing something basic here.</br></br></br>  <br> badly written delusions <br>Unsurprising that uneducated shits like yourself have that opinion when /lit/ has regular boards dedicated to writefagging. <br><br>Writefagging is the same as drawfagging so if you have a stick that far up your ass it's no wonder /a/ has problems making its own OC and maintaining LN threads. Animu and mango is nothing but pretty images if there is no plot to back it up.<br><br>The bible itself may have been a fanfiction, for example, but it in turn inspired fanfictions such as Evangelion (using the concepts of angels and religious iconography).<br><br>It may be hard for your tiny brain to comprehend, but every time you watch your anime you are watching fanfiction so you might as well commit suicide now :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ouch, a landwhale got triggered.</br>  <br> Comparing things teenage girls do on the internet to the bible  <br>Yeah okay, I can see you're a smart individual worth arguing with. <br>Seriously you just need to click the little x on the corner of the screen.</br></br></br>  <br> Triggered by fanfiction <br>Sasuga idiot.</br></br>  <br>*wait it says otouto so I guess she's probably not his sister.

In the original, it would correctly translate to "The one that got me excited/aroused wasn't the woman." or "I didn't get excited/aroused because of the woman." (meaning he was attracted to the men).<br>It'd be great if this could be fixed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I just noticed the あのとき. So it'd be "At that time, I didn't get excited/aroused because of the woman" or something along these lines.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127240557 <br>There may have been many Patrick Bateman stereotypes, but from the dubs guy meme, he probably belongs to the highly cliched and older than dirt stereotype of fun psycho serial killer which I greatly enjoy even if they are all technically the same well-selling character in different settings.</br>  Mikleo  tongue bath.

Not only sports, also SoL and shitty drama, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still part of the category.</br>  <br>When are you going to realize that it's not about sports just because it uses swimming as its setting. It's always been marketed as SoL drama and the fact it focuses on characters and their relationships instead of the sport only proves this.<br>Ping Pong wasn't about sports either.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br> translating shitty doujin only because m-muh Makoto is a bottom wneh Haru is a total shit <br>We need to kill Makotofags.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br>Why do you care about Haru?

I'm not sure why there isn't one for dating Satsuki but that would involve signing a contract with Ragyo and probably babysitting Nui. Is it strange that I think Disco MILF would try her hand eugenics if Satsuki had the life fiber parts like Ryuko?

Centuries of the family line are considered cursed by the woman in red until she gets bored and one day shows up on the couch like its completely normal and proceeds to live an average life as a freeloader in the estate. Teaches the current head of the family lineage how to kill the life fiber core that landed as all reference of fibers were taken by Inu to the grave when his hard drives thermite bombed themselves as his heart stopped. Proceeds to guides this poor sole into becoming life fiber Batman. Then erases all memories of her existence from everyone else and waits for the need to rise again while the poor sole is thought to be insane with visions of the old family ghost. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> That's lewd. <br><br>You know what's the lewdest part?<br><br> Ryuuko would do it too. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the lewdest part is they are sisters</br>  <br>I can go for it.

Or go fishing for the scissor blades. I'm picturing Ryuko telling Satsuki to stop having kids before it got to the point it is now. At least around the tenth or fiftieth. <br><br> But then they can have those tender moments where they help each other get over their trauma. <br>At rationalize what their mother did to them.

There's positivity in embracing that which isn't accepted by societal norms. This includes sexuality, which was presented through their battle outfits.<br><br>Before you say "hurr it's just fanservice" - it's both. Senketsu and Junketsu being revealing are both for audience titillation AND as part of the series core themes. <br><br>Saying "They didn't need slutifying" is quite possibly the biggest way to miss the point of the entire show I can imagine.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mostly true, but at the same time, I wish they'd picked a different theme than nudity and exposure (of your heart etc).<br><br>But no, sexuality isn't embraced in KlK. It's absolutely vilified. Only Ragyo, Nui, and Junketsu Ryuko ever display sexuality.<br><br>The show is not about the sexual aspects of nudity, and it uses the absolutely intolerable antagonists to marginalize it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a picture from the the drawfag threads a few years back of a character in a Canucks jersey</br>  <br>I'll admit that sexuality probably wasn't the best word - I was referring to nudity and exposure and should have used those words. My original point stands though. The exposure of Ryuko through Senketsus battle form is integral to the shows themes and her development as a character.<br><br>Wishing they'd picked a different theme means wishing it'd be a different show. KLKs use of nudity and sexuality is very much part of what I love about Imaishi and Triggers work in general, and a significant part of why KLK is one of my favourites.</br></br></br>  <br>KlK is my second favorite, and would have knocked TTGL off of #1 if the ending hadn't been so intolerable.<br><br>Nevertheless, I do wish it had been a different show. <br><br>You're not taking Imaishi or Nakashima or Sushio off the project, so the result would have been outstanding regardless, and an immense part of what made it great was the characters, who all would have functioned perfectly fine without the kamui being what they were. Ryuko is part of my soul and I wish Trigger hadn't decided they should work fanservice into the thematics just in case the show couldn't stand on the strength of its writing and character design. <br><br>It could have, it would have, and I suspect it would be doing even better in the west than it already is if not for the costume absurdity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Does anyone have that pic of Mako standing on the top of Honnouji tower, making fun of Satsuki?  <br>Could Imaishi and Trigger have written and designed a story like Kill la Kill without nudity? Probably, I don't doubt that it would also be great. <br><br>I would probably like it a ton, much like I like Little Witch Academia (I know that's not Imaishi but you get my point). But it would not be Kill la Kill.<br><br> I wish Trigger hadn't decided they should work fanservice into the thematics just in case the show couldn't stand on the strength of its writing and character design. <br>That's an absurd statement to make, to the point that I'm a little bothered you'd make it. <br><br>The idea that they worked fanservice into the series as a safety net in case the show couldn't stand up otherwise makes absolutely no sense in the context of Imaishi's works in general. Sex, nudity and extremity is central to almost everything Imaishi has directed, everything from Dead Leaves to Sex and Violence with Machspeed. Kill la Kill is much like all of Imaishis works in that regard, but beyond that, is the one that makes them the most central and important to its concept.<br><br> It could have, it would have, and I suspect it would be doing even better in the west than it already is if not for the costume absurdity <br>I'd rather they not undermine a core aspect of the shows theming and a design element that Imaishi celebrates significantly in his works, for the sake of more popularity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's the Raoh to pwirry's Kenshiro.</br>  <br> Sexuality isn't vilified, excessive sexuality and absolute dominance is. Relationships are meant to be a balance, the give and take of two people in equilibrium, you'd know that if you paid any attention to Ryuko and that absurd pointless costume.</br>  <br> makes absolutely no sense in the context of Imaishi's works in general. <br> What is Gurren Lagann <br> What is FLCL <br><br>Yoko existed almost solely to provide fanservice, but she was a (disappointingly) marginalized character and didn't reflect on the overall narrative. Meanwhile you have the two central characters (and almost every other character) stripped next to naked every episode in KlK. It was orders of magnitude beyond anything Imashi has ever done, and I'm vexed he decided to do it with KlK.<br><br>A year before KlK was announced I made a post in a "what would be your ideal anime " thread - my response was "A badass manly magical girl show by Gainax with Sawano composing."<br>Imagine my anticipation, and imagine my dismay when the hype threads degenerated into the transformed senketsu design posts being quoted 600 times.<br><br><br>The relationships weren't sexual in the least. Anon pls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  which kill la kill would be a devils fan?<br><br>someone has to like new jersey ;_;</br></br>  <br> no you don't get KLK <br> damn why did KLK go such a different direction, that was a dumb move <br><br>Anon, I don't mean to alarm you, but it just sounds like your saying you don't know what you're talking about and just inserting your fantasy show.</br></br></br></br>  I'm not saying the alternative is any worse. But there something about Ryuuko hot blood that turns me on.<br><br>I always loved angry bitches for some reason.</br></br>  <br> someone has to like new jersey ;_; </br>  <br>Imaishi had extremely minimal if any creative control with FLCL. He was an animation director, not an overall director, and that means he had little control over what was actually happening in the story or what themes the show used in general. He worked on FLCL, sure, but it has no bearing to this discussion at all.<br><br>Looking at the works where he actually had creative control (main Director position, namely) TTGL is the only one that doesn't use sex-related subjects heavily. It's the exception, not the rule. Dead Leaves, Panty and Stocking, Sex and Violence and Kill la Kill all use sex and related subjects a fuck ton. <br><br> It was orders of magnitude beyond anything Imashi has ever done <br>How are you able to say with a straight face that when Dead Leaves and Panty and Stocking exist? And Sex and Violence just happened recently too.<br><br>It sucks for you if you didn't like that people talked about the fanservice over whatever other aspects, but that's your issue and your issue alone. For me, and quite clearly based on Imaishi's works, for him and the staff working on Kill la Kill, the 'fanservice designs' are a core aspect of the entire series theming AND an element of design that Imaishi celebrates regularly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>orson dislikes philly<br><br>he has no issues with new jersey...except people who are eagles/phillies/flyers/76ers fans and live in jersey</br></br></br>  <br> youll enver form a happy family with ryuko or satsuki <br> not "&gt;you'll never form a happy family with ryuko AND satsuki </br></br>    <br>Our disagreements aside, it doesn't bother you that KlK discussions everywhere start and end with "lel fanservice xD"?<br><br>I've been avoiding KlK discussion for the past year because of that.<br><br><br>I drew that too ~</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm gonna marry Ryuko!  <br>You can't, she's not real.</br>    <br>I've never wanted a waifu, but if I did, it would be Satsuki.</br>  Funny enough, she actually had the best body.  <br> I'm sure theres probably a gamagoori walking around in japan <br>With a Mako and 4 animelets @ home</br></br>  <br>At the end of the day, fanservice is part of Kill la Kill, and a part that Imaishi and Trigger embrace and celebrate. If that's what people discuss a lot then I don't take much issue with it. It's fairly standard that the most immediately recognisable aspect of a work is often a major discussion point. I'd say the fact we've even had this discussion shows that discussion of the series is better than you give it credit for. I've had good, healthy KLK discussion on /a/ before now too.<br><br>Trust me, it could be worse.  I recently finished a game called Witch and the Hundred Knight and loved it, only to find discussing it to be near impossible because every time it gets brought up, the discussion turns into complaints about the localization company. Without fail. <br><br>Regardless, I should point out you have fantastic taste because Ryuko is love.

Now we wait and watch.  <br>Giftia's use hard drives? When was it explained that they had hard drives?</br>  <br>The power of love makes her body last super long. They will show her taking this test where she swims around and the bald man is going to say something along the lines of ''Wow your stats are getting better how is this possible?''. And then she lives for at least a few more years.</br>  <br><br> What do y'all predict? <br> A happy ending, or a sad ending? <br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br>  If she doesn't die, then fuck. Too many happy-go-lucky outcomes my cartoons.  Unconclusive ending, 1 day left until Isla dies.  <br>It's a plot convenience, don't overthink it. And if you still want an explanation...maybe planned obsolescence?</br>  <br>She has to die.</br>  Finally, an OP that doesn't start with the word fee-<br> filename <br><br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br>Giftias use quantum 4d computers emulating human brains phisical structure and evolving by creating artificial synapse links over time, thus creating a personality.<br><br>Its impossible to "transfer" it, since the "brain" grows naturaly from solid state to human one and due to nature of quantum physics, unique state of it cant be reproduced let alone copied. Its not raw "data", its extremely complex phisical structure.</br></br></br>  <br> When was it explained that they had hard drives? <br>It never was. Anon is confusing Giftias with persocoms.</br></br>  <br> Why can't they just back up the hard drives and put them in new bodies, or simply replace the hard drives? <br>Because they fucking can't. I'm 100% sure that if they could they would, but they can't.<br><br>They should have just given some random technical jargon gibberish to shut you fucks up once and for all.</br></br></br></br>  Happy Ending.<br><br>Tsukasa and Michiru are married, with 2 kids. One named Isla and other Gilermo Roberto Muchias del Barra The Second.</br></br>  <br>Was this actually said or are you pulling this out of your arse?</br>  <br> Because they fucking can't. I'm 100% sure that if they could they would, but they can't. <br>And this is where the big Lie lies. Just like auto makers nowaday CAN make cars that dont break down and serve for dozens of years and electronics and gadgets producers CAN produce staff that can server you for 10 years - they dont. Since they want to sell you product 10 times rather than 1, 100 if possible.<br><br>Thus just like that Giftias generations are retrieved and disposed of so that they could sell you a newer model.<br><br>Why do you think black market organizations hunt for almost expired worthless Giftias that would go to scrap either way, while they have no resources to properly reset and maintain them? Since they know how to remove the artificial limiter and make them work for them or resell.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> while they have no resources to properly reset and maintain them? <br>Says who?</br></br>  <br>Logical assumptions if you know anything on the subject of current AI research. Giftias are more than just Expert systems (in that case, copying them would be no problem) - the current most perspective computing development are Quantum computers (which however dont allow AI, just quick calculations) and synapse based 3d brain structures - since its assumed human intellegence is heavily tied to brain physics and develpment and true intellegence cant be reached just on way of emulating logic.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quant<wbr>um_mind<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artif<wbr>icial_neural_network</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> assumptions <br><br>Ok. You should've just said that over just saying that's how it actually works in the show.</br></br></br>  <br>If that were true then wouldn't that mean Giftias would have to be taught everything from scratch after being created? But by how it's shown, they seem to already know everything they need on activation or reset, though of course their personalities may develop further in the course of their life.</br>  <br>To be honest it's much stupider to believe everything is a CONSPIRACY.</br>  <br>Hey assholes<br>Remember the diary that was shown all throughout the show?<br>They're just gonna show that to Isla to get her memories back.<br>There's your asspull.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They're just gonna show that to Isla to get her memories back. <br>Most likely not.</br></br>  I want the cheesiest happy ending they can think of. It would ruin the anime, but Isla is too cute to die.  <br>A la ef: a tale of memories? That could actually happen</br>  <br>The best way to end this is  when truck-sama crash into their office and explode,killing all them .</br>  <br>Funded.</br>  <br>She might do a Chaika and retain some of her memories of MC because wuv. She already looks like Chaika anyway.</br>  Bittersweet ending would be pretty nice.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if the new Isla showed up at the end, but I wouldn't be surprised if she didn't show up either. She'll pretty much be remembered by the retrieval staff members, so her coming back wouldn't really be necessary.</br></br>  <br> Why do you think black market organizations hunt for almost expired worthless Giftias that would go to scrap <br>Precisely because they can get the money for selling the parts for scrap.</br></br>  Maybe you could pop by a YuYuYu thread and have them explain to us why it's okay for a show that looks like it's headed for misery to suddenly give you a happy ending because SoL/happy/this way there's more merch to sell later.  The title of the episode kinda makes it look like it's either a sad or bittersweet ending  I don't think I'm ready for this ;_;  <br>I see someone is in denial and wants a happy end.</br>  <br> Will I dream? <br><br>I want that.</br></br></br>  It's not even today.<br>Unless you actually subscribe to Japans's 25 hour bullshit</br>  <br>It's in 5 hours</br>  <br>why cant the rest do it then? only asspull out of this is miracle</br>  <br>a shit ending, fitting for the show</br>  <br> Out on HS in less than 8 hours <br> Airs in Japan in 5 hours <br> Not today </br></br></br>  <br> 8 hours <br>Unless HS/CR is late, again.</br></br>  Nah.

OP plays. Goes back to recounting her last days before she is taken. Second half shows her being taken away. Then comes the part I don't see because I'm crying. There's some conversations about loss and blah blah. Cut to MC guy walking up to an elevator. Isla is there, although just her recycled body (maybe she'll be wearing a different nametag or something to show this). MC guy is shocked. MC guy introduces himself. New Isla blushes awkwardly and stutters out a reply. Cue ED.<br><br>That covers just about everything I can think of using in-world logic and means they avoid a truly sad ending.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WQm<wbr>3emu2s44</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>newfags everywhere</br></br>  <br>This.

Don't mix them up.</br></br>  <br>But they are mixed up. This is not two separate series'.</br>  <br>I think that theory about Isla getting new OS, reading her diary and becoming friends with everyone else again is the most common one.</br>  <br>Probably not enough time to show that in one episode, it will likely end with him handing her the diary</br>  <br>The adventure continues? I can live with that. (Not that I can change anything but still)</br>  <br>A bland one: she die, everyone cry a little and then it's suggested that MC will hook up with tsundere.<br>The end.</br></br>  <br>Well it leaves the ending open, which means they don't have to actually break the "new robololis don't retain memories" rule outright</br>  remember when tsukasa was sick in bed?<br><br> the rest of the show has been a dream, hes been sick this whole time  or died already  </br></br>    <br> He's a new experimental kind of android with a shorter life span than the normal ones. <br><br> I don't actually believe this at all. </br></br></br>      So Tsukasa definitely did Isla right? Androids can't get pregnant (well maybe they can, but either way she will be dead soon) and she is going to die anyway  <br> So Tsukasa definitely did Isla right? <br>Yes, he's been very good to her.<br><br> So Tsukasa definitely did Isla, right? <br>There's no evidence that they've had sex<br><br> See, the comma makes a big difference. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They haven't kissed yet let alone had sex, but the hand holding is enough.<br>With luck we are going to get a goodbye kiss.</br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that being a pedantic asshole on the internet is never going to get you a robololi gf</br>  Like tears in rain.  mc going lose his arm  any stream?  <br>Try the usual one.</br>    <br>Daily reminder that nothing is going to get you a robololi gf because they don't exist.</br>  <br>I believe you forgot to add a three letter word beginning with y and ending with t to your sentence</br>  <br>meizhi?</br>  Fifteen minutes, time to abandon board before stream spoilers come.

What a shit pull.</br></br>  All these reactions mmmmmmm. Im glad the show runners at least had the balls to go through with her death rather than going for an asspull.  And they show an Angel Beats commercial at the end. That's just fucking cruel.  give it to me simple<br>Who won?<br>Edgetards or happyendfags?</br></br>  Isla won't get her personality and memories back<br> yfw </br>  <br>That's a pretty high rating</br>  <br>Can you try without buzzwords</br>  MY SMILE IS GONE FOREVER  WAAH! This cant be real!  I´m just happy to not have seen more than first and last episodes  <br>otonashi-grabbing-the-air.gif</br>  <br>neither, its a cop-out</br>  Based ambiguous ending. Happy endingfags BTFI saying Isla remembers after reading the diary, Bittersweet endingfags BTFI with her making new memories with Tsukasa, everyone literally blown the fuck in.  <br>edgetards</br>  <br>MAL please.</br>  Bad end. Fuck.  <br>Same here</br>  <br>I would, but then it would be  forced </br>  <br><br>You fucks missed out.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>What are you trying to achive?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ambiguous end.</br>  <br> BTFI </br>  <br><br>Why are you even here?</br></br>  Why does the agency use giftias? Won't they have to go through the experience of losing them every 10 years? Like Sherry, Constance, and the little kid are always going to get BTFO'd.  It was a good episode until the epilogue, fuck, they could at least showed her hair or something god damn it.  6/10 anime  That black haired girl of Aquarion is definitely a boy crossdressing  <br>Read the post, moron.</br>  Well at least we were saved from forced asspulls at the last minute. And they didn't rub in the suffering like they did in episode 1.  So no Michiru end then  I actually feel pretty empty after the epilogue. <br><br> tease new partner but don't show long hair or face or anything <br><br>FUCKING KILL ME<br><br>I MISS ISLA ALREADY</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if i were to judge on story alone, it'll be a 4-5/10. animation and voice work saved it from mediocrity.</br>  <br> It's not clear if Isla got the upgrade or the scrap, Tuskasa was fucking happy when he meet his new faceless bot </br>  <br>Rewrite the  memories  of this Dogakobo show with the upcomming new Godakobo masterpiece</br>  <br> explain <br>Saves money for the company, I guess.</br></br>  <br>I stayed in the stream after watching UBW.</br>  <br>Fuck off with your dank meme, retard</br>    <br><br> Tsukasa knows that this time he'll get to fuck her clankbox in a few days </br></br>  Thanks god i finally could drop this garbage  <br>I wouldn't consider at least a hint of Isla getting at a fragment of her memories using the diary an asspull, with this the diary was pretty much pointless to the plot.</br>  Why are you all mad anon? Calm down. Was the ending that bad?  Dropped.  <br> Happyendingfag is actually this delusional </br>  <br>Oh fuck, are you fucking serious.<br>So the diary actually had no relevance at all?</br></br>  <br>How's Aquarion? That little section of the OST in that commercial sounded good though.</br>    That felt like a pretty uneventful last episode. It felt like nothing really happened outside of what we expected, and even then, they barely focused on what happened to Isla after, if she was renewed or scrapped.  <br>IT WAS FUCKING NOTHING<br>retards would like it as the ambiguous open ending though</br></br>  I don't know, I mean, I expected something more to happen in the story.<br>I keep thinking that his dad will have a more important role to play in the story considering that he's the CEO or some shit. But he appeared twice and never did anything at all. But still, the ending wasn't that bad. The whole ting was maybe a 7 out of 10.</br>  <br>see  thats the epilogue and what they showed</br>  <br>Exactly, they really fucked up the epilogue.</br>  <br> drop <br> watching the last episode </br></br>  <br> watching things you don't enjoy <br>Are you retarded?<br>Congrats on your +1 to MAL list btw, you did it</br></br></br>  So many god damn loose threads that failed to be addressed. Shinya Godou? Reason for short lifespans? The purpose of the diary and keychains? R-Security? All of these never explained. What a waste...  <br>His dad was a friend of the CEO.</br>  <br> missing the joke </br>  I`ll give Dogakobo credit for not pulling any bullshit. It was simple and straight story with no asspulls and no forced drama.<br><br>Something most anime writers cant achieve even with gun to their head.<br><br>Its mediocre, but solid.</br></br></br></br>  Great romcom, shitty story and setting. Cute characters though.  <br> R-Security? <br>They were a plot device to enable psycho-pass 2.0</br></br>  <br>It really shows that it was their first original anime.</br>  <br>B-but muh diary</br>  <br><br> no forced drama <br>Mandatory death sentence on robot people with no way to back-up or save memories<br><br>kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ecept it's an ending so open it ruined the whole shit</br>  <br>Its story about dealing with death. Remove all the robot shit and you can have a story set in Elderly house, watching your parents wither away, or waifu dieing from Aids. <br><br>There is no miracles and no awoiding it. The whole point is to live with it. Everybody dies, its question of time.</br></br></br>  My smile and optimism: gone.  <br> It really shows that it was their first original anime. <br>what I thought this was made by the guy who did steins;gate</br></br>  <br>They are trying for a second season probably.</br>  <br>I know, but still. The story felt pretty empty in the end. There was so much shit they talked about but never went anywhere.<br>It felt as thought this was only 60-70% of the story.</br></br>  <br>pls no</br>  <br>His smile and optimism: gone.</br>  <br> S2 <br>1 after ending OVA at best with BD</br></br>  The shift in Isla's personality during the last two episodes was weird. They left a a lot of loose ends too, I feel like this anime would've been better as a 2 cour.  <br>Is the OVA confirmed?</br>  <br>dunno</br>  <br><br>If it was a 2 cour I have no idea what they would fill the rest of the time with. This is definitely a show where pretty much nothing happens in each episode besides character development, and some random plot in episode 4 and 5 that never shows up again.</br></br>  <br> Shinya Godou <br>Just a corporate boss. He has work to do, not santimental pointless shit.<br> Reason for short lifespans? <br>Because their lifespans is short. Its not a damn conspiracy, the method awaibling creating AI has its limitations, too bad.<br> The purpose of the diary and keychains? <br>Sentimental shit people do. Zero meaning like most sentimental shit people do.<br> R-Security? <br>Giftias out of control are serious threat for corporation, up to possibility of public ban of giftia production if media gets some shit. So unlike the guys in this office, corporation knows the danger Giftias pose and to deal with it to awoid public backlash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you should stay in Fate thread too</br>  No sales no second season. How's the sale?  did you rike it?  <br>Apparently, it's done well enough in social trends and BD sales to justify an S2. No idea if they're going to do so though.</br>  <br>1 cour is enough if you delete episodes 4 and 5.</br>  <br>Thats not forced drama. Thats the whole premise of the show.</br>  <br>It didn't need two cour, it needed a different setting, Most unresolved plot points were related to Giftias and the workplace, so, instead of making it a sci fi with androids just make Isla a normal girl with a terminal disease.</br>  <br>Shit.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Isla was cute and everything between episodes 6 and the epilogue were great.</br>  <br>they could be worse but i don't think they wll make an S2</br>  I'm glad it's over.   people expecting 2nd season <br>Is the /u/ delusions and idiocy in reality a virulent disease and because of their invasion on the board spread on other people too now?<br><br>What next, sequel movie to Grave of Fireflies where Japan wins the war?</br></br></br>  <br>It would have been better that way. I would have liked at least a couple more episodes of her being all lovey dovey.</br>  <br>This. I think Naotaka Hayashi wanted to his series to be unique by having it filled with the androids and workplace. However, this comes with the expectation that the setting and the themes attached would be explored, which is where he failed miserably.</br>  Oh god, this was so fucking awful, holy shit. It was just like one of the old DBZ movies with a filler villain. Seriously, they didn't even need to make it Freezer, as they barely used his previous relationships with the other characters beyond "guy who wants revenge on Goku".<br><br>But wait, at least the old movies usually had some cool fights. Pretty much every fight scene in this one was uninspired and derivative. I lost count of how many times they did the old 'dash-in and punch to the gut' thing, and that's off the top of my head. It felt like every single fight choreography was just copypasted from scene of the tv series.</br></br>  Don't forget the horrible use of CGI  <br> Uninspired fight scenes <br><br>Goddamnit, I'm so tired of this shit being in Dragonball. For fucks sake, you would think that after 20 or so years they would think of stuff that isn't just<br> ki/energy blast <br> ATATATATA flurry-style punching and kicking <br> new power-up or transformation </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drop a link so I can judge it for myself</br>  Also, if Freeza's men didn't expect him to be able to become stronger, why did they need to revive him when they had a guy who could beat up Piccolo?  <br> DBZfags want to be spoonfed <br><br>what a surprise</br></br></br>  <br><br>Google nor bing yields any results for stream or torrent. <br><br>So unless you provide a link I'll automatically assume everyone commenting about it, including OP, is a summer fag trolling. Funimation has that shit clapped down tighter than caitlyn jenner's pussy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Original dragonball a shit</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>They are spics, the movie is in cinemas there.</br>  <br>no need to be racist, kid</br>  <br>Spic really doesn't trigger latinos as much as nigger triggers niggers.</br>      Was there any female nudity or bare feet?<br><br>I need to know for science.</br></br>  <br><br>Nuthin personnel....heh...</br></br>  <br>How many "unique" fight moments can you get with something running as long as DBZ? There are only so many ways to punch or kick someone.<br><br>Unless you want them doing JoJo poses while they do it or something.</br></br></br>  dragon ball was only ever good up til before the third budokai   Expecting DB to have a good plot or consistent fighting <br>It really isn't helped by it always being big bad wants to destroy thing, their minions could shit all over the last big bad easily, so people get pounded for a while, then Goku shows up with new power up and wins the day, repeat for every arc.<br><br><br> Xenoverse is pretty fun. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I was about to say to  how whenever I see a barefoot walker (like Cirno here) it just gets me hard but clearly another footfag has taken my place.<br><br>I guess I'm just not needed anymore, so I'll take my leave to another board who needs me. I'm sorry if I wasted your time /a/.<br><br> Goodbye... forever </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As a spic I can confirm that we don't give a flying fuck</br>  <br>link to stream?</br>  <br>There is none cause OP is an attention seeking fag</br>  <br>But that was literally only the King Piccolo arc</br>  <br> went to the theatre to watch the movie today <br> im never going to get that money back <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br> Raditz <br> Saiyan arc <br> Freiza arc <br> Android arc <br> Cell arc <br> Buu arc <br> etc <br>I mean fuck, Nappa outright says that the little green shits outstriped Raditz by a good margin while the Ginyu Force fairly outstriped Vegita and Nappa and Freiza made them look like a joke.<br>The Androids would have stomped Freiza, Cell utterly stomped the androids once he got one of them  and let's face it, Goku could have easily beaten Cell during the Cell games but gave up to give that little worthless shit of a son a morale boost. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck you OP, I had fun and the movie gave me exactly what I expected. Also the movie going experience was the best. Everyone laughed everytime Freezer went full homo with the voice.  <br>I hate this GOKU WINS LOL meme when it's nothing more than a falacy. His only clean win was against Freeza and even then he didn't kill him. He didn't stand a chance against Raditz and had to hold him down while Piccolo gets the kill, Vegeta had him overwhelmed and it was Gohan who finished him off, in Android saga he didn't had much of a spotlight due to heart disease, in Cell saga he did a lot of stupid decisions that cost his life and potentially the others and in Buu saga he only beat Kid Buu with the help of everybody.</br>  <br> Goku could have easily beaten Cell during the Cell games but gave up to give that little worthless shit of a son a morale boost. <br>BUT THATS WRONG, FAGGOT</br></br>  <br>Nobody asked you, nigger.</br>  <br>Goku was already losing stamina while Cell was holding back.<br><br>If additional training would've done anything, Vegeta would've at least caught up to Goku with the several months he had.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice rebuttal, manlet.</br>  <br> It was just like one of the old DBZ movies <br>Sounds better than Kami to Kami then.</br></br>  <br>this<br><br>holy shit i cringed so hard when they used that 3d effect</br></br></br>  VIRGINIA  <br> then Goku shows up with new power up and wins the day <br><br>Only applies to Freeza saga.</br></br></br>  So BOG being good was a one-off?  <br>Yeah because it wasn't really fight-centered<br>Don't expect to see something like BoG ever again because RoF sold like crazy,so that's likely the direction they are going to take.</br></br>  <br> so that's likely the direction they are going to take. <br><br>Not for much longer, RoF only did so well because it was Frieza.</br></br></br>  When I first read about this movie I thought it was a joke. It sounds like something people would make up a joke when talking about cliches. "Oh no Frieza is back and is a million billion times stronger and Goku has to become a super duper mega saiyan to defeat him". Fuck me.  <br> It sounds like something people would make up a joke when talking about cliches.  <br><br>You know that Dragonball invented most of those cliches right? That's hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say invented, but definitely one of the worst offenders. Makes it all the sadder that they can't make up literally ANYTHING else.</br>  <br> Makes it all the sadder that they can't make up literally ANYTHING else. <br><br>They don't need to, it invented all these tropes.</br></br></br>  <br>I've always wondered what would happen after the finale of DBZ and hoped one day we will have a sequel to it.<br>I guess you shouldn't wish for stuff that might come true.</br></br>  <br>Hahaha gets me every time, it feels like they couldn't have meant anything besides Vegeta thought I know that isn't true</br>  <br>well that's a shame, at least BoG convinced me to pick up DB because it's similar in comedic tone. I only ever experienced DBZ before now.</br>  <br>One day you'll realize that guy isn't funny.</br>  <br><br>I'm rewatching the series right now. I don't know what kind of bullshit the English dub added in, but this is how it went down. <br><br> Raditz <br><br>Goku got his ass kicked by Raditz and had to sacrifice himself so Piccolo could beat him. <br><br> Saiyan arc <br><br>Goku got his ass kicked by Vegeta and Krillin, Gohan, and Yajirobe had to team up to beat him. <br><br> Freiza <br><br>I'll give you this one. <br><br> Android  <br><br>Goku is literally in a coma this entire arc. He loses the first fight he's in due to his heart condition and is out until Cell arc begins. <br><br> Cell arc <br><br>Goku loses to Cell, admitting multiple times throughout the arc that he can't beat Cell with everyone who has any decent track record of judging power levels accurately (King Kai, Roshi, and Karin) also agreeing that he has no chance of beating Cell. His ace in the whole through the entire arc was that he knew Gohan was stronger than him and the only reason Goku fought Cell at all was to show Gohan how Cell fought, this is stated by Piccolo. <br><br>I'm about to start the Buu arc now, so I won't say anything about that. But you're still wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>  in Cell saga he did a lot of stupid decisions that cost his life <br><br>There are two dumb decisions Goku made:<br>1.) Giving Cell a Senzu. <br>2.) Not telling Gohan of his plan beforehand. <br><br>He knew that Gohan was the only one strong enough to beat Cell, but he thought Gohan, much like full blooded Saiyans, loved fighting and wouldn't accept a victory over a weakened Cell. When Piccolo tells Goku that Gohan isn't a full blooded Saiyan and doesn't have the same battle lust that he and Vegeta do, the realization hits Goku like a ton of bricks and he realizes that they were mistakes. <br><br><br>But despite that, ultimately it was Gohan's fault that Goku died, and the series presents it as such. He had Cell beaten so badly that he got arrogant and kept putting off killing him despite Goku constantly shouting at him, telling him to finish him before he does something crazy. Cell did something crazy, and Goku died for it. <br><br>I don't know where the idea comes from that people have that Goku could have beaten Cell. He couldn't. Only Gohan could beat Cell at that point because Gohan was the only one who had achieved true Super Saiyan 2, as Goku had witnessed in their training.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And now,<br>Battle of the Gods: Gets his shit wrecked, has to totally admit defeat<br>Revival F: Gets ganked, only wins by an actual interference from god</br></br></br>  <br>eat shit border jumper</br>  <br><br>Hear me out on this, but it might have had to do with some sort of sadistic bloodlust saiyans sometimes tend to have when they first attain SSJ forms. <br><br>Remember when Goku first went SSJ and immediately told Gohan to leave? After that he wanted to beat Frieza at full power just to show how completely outclassed he was compared to him no matter how hard he tried.<br><br>SSJ2 Gohan was likely the same.<br><br>Won't argue it wasn't dumb though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do people think the "I'll accuse you of lying" tactic actually works?<br><br>Why? Does it work on you, you fucking retard?</br></br></br>  <br>Was it at least better than Battle of Gods? <br><br> I went into BOG expecting that one to be horrible and ended up liking it. <br><br><br>Shut the fuck up beaner.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can watch it in spanish now if you want<br><br>I didnt understand a word but it was better than nothing imo</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's cute, the /b/ children think they fit in</br></br>  <br>  dragonball invented most of those cliches <br> implying </br></br>  <br><br> implying it didn't </br></br>    <br> and let's face it, Goku could have easily beaten Cell during the Cell games <br>Why do you braindead little fucktards keep saying this? <br><br>People have posted this several times in DB threads the past few weeks and I don't understand. Who started this dumb shit? <br>Are people retroactively misinterpreting Goku's loss against Cell because of what Goku says during the fucking Buu saga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BoG was way better.</br>  <br> and let's face it, Goku could have easily beaten Cell during the Cell games but gave up to give that little worthless shit of a son a morale boost. <br>Holy shit please kill yourself. <br>CELL WAS HOLDING BACK</br></br></br>   Goku could have easily beaten Cell <br> Got his shit kicked in by a Cell Jr <br><br>Not to mention he was panicking when Gohan wouldn't use his full power like  said.</br></br></br>  <br><br>In Goku's defense, the only reason he got his shit wrecked by the Cell Jr was because he hadn't taken a Senzu after his own battle with Cell and was running on empty. <br><br>But that being said, even at full power he probably wouldn't have been able to take all of them, at least not as easily as Gohan did.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably "Vegetarians".<br><br>Eggs, I guess?</br></br></br>  BLUNDER OF THE CENTURY  <br>I guess it turns out jet fuel really can melt steel beams.</br>  <br>End of fight against Freezer was really terrible, it was made on pure purpose to mock Vegeta into oblivion, absolutely retarded dick move from scriprwriters/Toriyama or whoever is responsible for that bullshit. Overall movie was OK, quite enjoyable.</br>  <br>DBZ is trash?<br>welcome to 15 years ago</br></br>  <br>I'm actually a spic, don't found it offensive or something else, just like  said, I give a shit about it.</br>  <br> implying DBZ wan't trash since the beggining. <br><br>Anon, if you enter in a sewer don't complain about step on shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up faggot.<br> tfw hispanic and don't give a shit about random racial slurs on fucking 4chan </br></br>  <br>Wins: Nappa, Recoome, Burter, Freeza, Yakon, Kid Buu<br>Losses: Raditz, Vegeta, Captain Ginyu, Android 19, Cell<br>Stalemates: Majin Vegeta, Fat Buu<br><br>Am I missing any?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if that's really how it goes down then I'm torn between molten rage and abstract hilarity <br><br>true and genuine shit tier writing surpassing all my expectations, bravo Toriyama <br><br>DB super is just gonna be more of this, isn't it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Presumably this film is going to get remade as a longer arc along with BoG, so hopefully it will be a better package.</br>  <br>Pretty much. I don't give a fuck.</br>  <br> losses: fat buu <br><br>Expect that he was wrecking Fat Buu's shit and just escaped from fight since he had no intention to kill him.</br></br></br>  <br> losses <br><br>it clearly reads, stalemates</br></br></br>  <br>I put Fat Buu as a stalemate because he was just stalling for time before running away, not a serious fight. But afterwards Goku does tell Piccolo that he probably couldn't have won.</br>  <br>oh fuck, right<br><br><br><br>It's because of time limits, not power difference, he even stated later on that could've kill Majin Buu back then but wanted kids to do that, since Earth should've be protected by living, not him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>holy shit my sides.<br>i can't wait for this shit to be released in america and for all the fauxweebs here to come in droves and rage at this shit.</br></br>  I liked BoG better.<br><br>Fight choreography could have been way better. Especially during the Everyone vs Z Fighters battle. I remember reading the director saying Toriyama didn't give much instructions for this scene and it shows. Pretty uninspired in some places. Though Gohan blitzing a bunch of Frieza mooks was fun. <br><br>CGI was badly used. No other way around it.<br><br>Soundtrack really could have use way more work. Seriously, if you have F then use it more fuckers. It's wasted on Frieza breaking out of his healing tank.<br><br>Whis vs Goku and Vegeta was fun. As a whole, Whis and Beerus are used well here. They are really sticking with the whole 'yeah, these two guys are the strongest in the universe'.<br><br>One thing the movie does well is acknowledge how fucking retarded Goku and Vegeta are being about fighting Frieza. It's not a movie about Frieza being some great menace. It's a movie about Goku and Vegeta letting their own messed up personalities fuck things up and give Frieza the opportunity to blow everything up. A really Toriyama way of poking fun at the shounen tropes he ended up popularizing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying being dead even minorly inconvienced goku by the cell saga, let alone the buu saga <br> implying this wasn't simply a ploy to hide from chichi kicking his ass all over whatever the fuck province they lived in for screwing around with gohan so much. </br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Still no knowing how Durability works in Dragon Ball </br></br>  Why is Gohan not Mystic anymore.  <br>He's a Nerd.</br>  <br>Oh if it does make you angry, I wonder of your reaction on things that will follow after this.</br>    <br>basically how mystic worked is it unlocked his full power, but gohan had to keep up training in order to keep mystic up and him being bullshit strong.<br>gohan being the peace loving failure of a saiyan he is refused to train full well knowing odds are other fucks would probably show up and try to blow up the planet since you know, his whole life has been quite literally nothing but this.<br>thus he lost his ability and straight up regressed in strength pretty hard.</br></br></br>  <br>like i said, i think its hilarious, and i can't wait for all the kiddies to get really pissed and claim this is DB evolution 2.0<br><br>i need to refill my buckets of tears after all.</br></br></br>  <br>How about I just knock you flat on your ass you trool.</br>  <br>how the fuck are you even surprised when the first movie was garbage as well? <br><br> hurrr durr you must make 5 super saiyans hold hands to go super saiyan god <br> the 5th super saiyan is a fucking fetus <br><br>it's fucking tragic how poorly written this garbage is</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He would have kicked vegeta's shit in if he went ssj3 he just didn't because he didn't want to hurt vegeta's feelings.</br>  <br><br>KNOW YOUR FUCKING PLACE, TACO NIGGER.</br></br>  <br>I'd help you with that, although I need not resort to brute force considering I could intellectually checkmate this inferior troll.</br>  <br> i am a strong independant anon and i don't need no troll </br>  <br> &gt;Raditz <br><br>Raditz beat his ass to sunday and back and he died holding him in place<br><br> &gt;Saiyan arc <br><br>Kaioken and Spirit Bomb still couldn't put Vegeta down. He needed the help of Krillin, Gohan, and Yajirobe to do it.<br><br> &gt;Freiza arc <br><br>Yeah but even then, Frieza survived.<br><br> &gt;Android arc <br><br>Heart virus.<br><br> &gt;Cell arc <br><br>He knew he couldn't beat Cell. Goku was going all out while Cell was still holding back when they fought. Gohan was the only one strong enough that could beat him<br><br> &gt;Buu arc <br><br><br>Got trashed. Spirit bomb nearly didn't work due to the fact that Goku could only get so much energy because the people of earth didn't believe him or vegeta. It took Hercule fudging once again to get enough energy and they had to restore Goku's energy so he could detonate it.<br><br><br><br> Whis tells Goku about dropping his guard after a fight even when the enemy isn't gone. He warns him not to do that shit while telling Vegeta not to be so tight and don't take your sweet time finishing a fight. <br> Goku lets his guard down and gets hit by some Frieza soldier he didn't even assume was there. <br> DBZ has shown that even if you're in another form you still need your KI up to take hits an your body. <br><br>After Whis said that who didn't see something like this coming.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Did they at least have that Freezer song playing in a battle scene?  <br>But that's unfair is a different transformation it only matters if the opponent strenght is similar to yours</br>  <br>It was in the movie twice, once while he was being regenerated in his ship after his minions used the dragon balls to bring him back, then it was used again during the fight, but without vocals.</br>  <br>Fuck I meant to reply to this post </br>  <br>Wasn't it funny Piccolo did much better against Cell Jrsthan anyone else included Vegeta?</br>  <br>I think that was anime only.</br>  <br>posted this many times while you losers were hyping an obviously shitty movie. Why watch it knowing it's shit. Show some self-respect. Jesus.<br><br>I mean, there are actually people looking foward to the new dbz series, im assuming searching for new anime to watch is too uncomfortable for them so they stick to something they're familiar with even though they know it's going to shit</br></br></br>  <br>Where the fuck do you think we are?</br>  <br>Leave it to me!</br>  <br> gets cut by glass shards </br>  <br>Still BS though even humans did something</br>  What gets me is how SUPER AWESOME STRONG THESE GODS ARE HOLY SHIT and 9/10's of the fight is late Dragonball era levels of explosions.<br><br>Hell, not even that. Can't they animate some decent fights anymore?</br></br>  <br>They could learn from Asura fights</br>  <br>why did walt do that to him anyway?</br>    <br> Goku could have easily beaten Cell during the Cell games but gave up to give that little worthless shit of a son a morale boost </br>  <br> Toei <br> Animate <br>Toei animation is shit. With a few exceptions here and there, but it's shit for the most part. Especially since they started outsourcing this stuff more and more. <br><br>Added to this is that Toriyama is known to be lazy and will more likely than not leave the studio to handle most of the choreography, which sucks since Toriyama can do some pretty neat fight choreography.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cell powered up fighting Gohan FSSJ <br> Then he powered up to Max when Gohan was kicking his ass as SSJ2 <br>Therefore Goku could win.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Goku probably could have trained himself up to SSJ2 in the time chamber after seeing Gohan do it, but once he saw Gohan do it and knew Gohan could win, he kind of just cut things short and went to go fuck his wife for 9 days then gave Gohan center stage.</br>  <br>The Buu arc is the best one.<br> I mean sure, I could power up to max and fight seriously right at the start and annihilate Buu, but I want literally everyone else to get a chance at fighting him, so I'm going to dick around until I get tired. </br></br>  <br> Implying that Full-Power SSJ Cell Saga Goku &gt; SSJ2 Cell Saga Gohan </br>  <br>What's going to happen if by the end of Super, Goku is is SSJ3GodHyperSSG or whatever and he actually learns and goes all out from the start? Goku fighting at 100% to kill with no wiggle room would be frightening.</br>  <br>I was being ironic, Goku never had a chance Cell just wanted to make things interesting by overnerfing himself</br>  <br><br> those retarded mental gymnastics </br></br>  <br>I watch a dozen series a season, I read tons of manga and play tons of games. I work through my backlog systematically over time.<br><br>Dragonball has always been and will always be one of my favorite series. The people who get assblasted over powerlevels and the newfags pretending to be oldfags calling it shit can all fuck right off. Toriyama knows what he's doing, and if you haven't figured out by now that it's a gag series with silly powerlevels and martial arts, then you're a retard.</br></br></br>  <br> those retarded mental gymnastics <br>Which part of mine was mental gymnastics? I said he couldn't beat Cell, but that if he'd have wanted to keep training that he might have reached SSJ2 (which we know him and Vegeta eventually did.)</br></br>  Now we wait for subs  <br>I hope they'll be done during this night (GMT).</br>  Can anybody think of any reason for the anime screwing Izana so hard? She already gets enough suffering, she doesn't need this meta suffering.  <br>I wish someone would screw Izana hard</br>  <br>They probably had to cut shit to make it fit and figured those scenes weren't of critical importance.</br>  <br> Not Hoshijro. </br>  Hoshijiro best girl.  <br>She really needs it.<br><br>What does Hoshijiro have to do with Izana getting marginalised compared to the manga?</br></br></br>  <br>Dead girl.

Polygon tried to make it looks like Izana was about to win it though.</br>  <br> http://<br>s<br>tr<br>aw<br>po<br>ll.m<br>e/47<br>548<br>49</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>  <br> implying she isn't still best </br>  <br>They could have shown a bit more effort and draw at least one, fucking one new scene instead of shamelessly copy-pasting everything. Like replace congrats. scene location to something like this.</br>  <br>Can you imagine if third-genders kept developing their secondary sexual characteristics until the moment the person they changed for had sex with them?</br>  <br> Nagate, you need to have sex with Izana or she won't be able to fit in a guardian cockpit anymore and will probably eventually die <br>I could see Yure doing this.</br></br>  <br> Literally built for sex <br> Cares deeply for her best friend/husbando <br> Top tier pilot <br> Cyborg <br> Suit has a garter belt theme going <br>How can she be so best?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And instead turn it into a first grade character assassination. Great job Polygon.</br>  <br>Tsumugi needed to be shoehorned into important unrelated situations to pander to the moefags.</br>  <br>Well, yes, but she's fulfilled her roles that were critical to the main plot, even though she comes of less competent.</br>  <br>Before I say anything I want to hear you out on what you thought her roles was.</br>  <br>I mean where the general plot needed Izana to be present in order to advance in the same way as it did in the manga (like using the special radar) she was present.</br>  <br>And that mindset is what resulted in the character assassination.</br>  Five days until her birthday.<br><br>What are your plans?<br><br> &gt;inb4 niggers </br></br></br></br>  <br>i think i'll gift her a username and pass for  blacked.com </br>  <br>Stop it</br>  <br>I want to take her to  a drugstore. </br>  Pay her a black stripper  <br>But anon, I am a nigger.

Othrwise, nope. E8's advantage over other Shermans was a better suspension that gave it a more comfortable ride, but had no better armor nor gun than other A3 76mm Shermans.<br> Firefly <br> British variant US Army rejected <br>So, technically yes, but in practise, nope. Not in Hollywood.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, 75mm-armed Shermans could defeat the Tiger I as well.
