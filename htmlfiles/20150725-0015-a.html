Anime is finally saved. Thank you, Japan.</br></br>  <br> Anime is finally saved for the third time <br>fixed that for you. This is the third season, after all.</br></br>  <br>Real release when? ;__;</br>  <br>This is not actually part of the season yet, and I'd wait with anything until Herz does anything even close to the OVA.<br>I have a gut feeling they did this in order to make it acceptable that the beach episodes won't be lewd.</br></br>  Guys, I have a confession to make. I have never seen this show, nor read the manga. But I always lurk in this thread for the lewds. I like fanservice and I have no issue with fanservice at all, but I do not feel like sinking hours of time into the show if that is all it is. <br><br>Somehow I have managed to avoid spoilers for the show since I only skim for lewds. <br><br>So the question is: Is this show worth watching for non fanservice reasons? I already have webms of many popular fanservice scenes saved for fapping, so I just want to know if the show is legitimately good for anything besides that.<br><br>For the record, I do typically enjoy Mahou Shoujo shows (the good ones, CCS, Madoka, Nanoha, TuTu and the like) but I am not a big fan of Fate/Stay (I could never bring myself to finish Heavens Feel, I enjoyed the Tsukihime VN far more).<br><br>So is this show worth watching?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon stands corrected.</br>  <br><br>What is the context of this scene?</br></br>  <br>pvc of this by max factory fucking when</br>  <br>By all technicalities, this is season 3. It's just a little early, is all.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I watched episode one the other day and it seemed pretty dank</br>  <br> won't be lewd <br>ANIME ISN'T FINALLY SAVED<br>PLEASE JAPAN</br></br></br>  <br>"mana transfer"</br>  <br>Pay attention. Real release comes out in Japan on Saturday, so we'll have to wait for somebody to rip it and put it on a torrent site. Since fansub groups don't deign to sully their good name by subbing DVD-only releases, if it's not in BD quality, then we'll have another 2-3 months unless some independent saint like Mori decides to take it up.</br>  <br>This man and his image are correct.</br>  <br>Kuro is a construct of Mana, and requires a considerable amount simply to stay alive. As Illya and Miyu are  Holy Grails , they've got incredible amounts of Mana. Kuro can tap in to their mana, but only through skinship. This is similar to how in the normal Fate series, people have to giving the fuck to get mana.<br><br>tl;dr, Kuro is a lesbian rapist magic vampire.</br></br></br>  <br>Prevents conception</br>  <br>there are a few good fights and some ancillary fun and if they get to 3rei there will be some really good magical girl activites. so yeah there's more besides the lewdity.</br>  Fuck this OVA. I didn't ever get an erection over Ilya. Why did it have to start now. Fuck you Silver Link.  <br>No, this was the OVA, not the actual episode that airs today, so "technically" it wasn't.</br>  <br>if you fuck her deep enough for your dick to stretch her belly, it will look like the business end of a dick.</br>  <br>Now that you mention it it kinda would</br>  <br>3rei will be the season after the one that starts airing now right? What are the odds of that getting made?</br>  <br>If it helps, this isn't really Ilya. She's a completely different character in Prisma.</br>  <br>Depends on sales of 2wei hertz</br>  <br>how did the previous seasons and OVAs do?</br>  <br>Well enough to warrant a season 3. I'd wager 3rei's chances are pretty good.</br>  <br>even more so because of the awesome fights, half-archer-shirou and tanaka being tanaka<br><br>though i think they´ll censor the torture-scene of miyu</br></br></br>  <br> Rin's got that covered <br>Rin is irrelevant here. The lolis are the only ones that matter.</br></br>  <br>Why? She just got stabbed in her hands.</br>  <br>  (You) <br> though i think they´ll censor the torture-scene of miyu <br>That's what bds are for.</br></br></br>  <br> Not reading the manga </br>  <br>Wow I am autistic</br>  <br>What would Shirou think if he saw this?</br>  <br> Implying <br><br>Rin and Luvia will never have any chance. Even Sakura won't have any.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That kind of seal would looks like this.</br></br>  <br>There is literally an entire side story that solely exists to tell you she's gonna win.</br>  <br>Your googles are too tight Rinfag.<br><br> Taking sidestories seriously </br></br></br>  <br>Prisma Shirou is a barely repressed pervert so he'd try to act cool while thinking about every which way he can jackhammer the lolis and everything else with a vogoo.</br>  <br>I think you're forgetting the entire context behind Prisma, pal. You do know it was based off of a Rin scene from HA, right? Hiroyama is a big Rin fan. Between the three main heroines, who's the most relevant in Prisma? Saber was a side boss in the first story arc, and Sakura was almost nonexistent until recently, and did you notice what her entire purpose was in the latest arc? It was to make Rin look good.<br><br>Seriously, her role was to hurt Shirou, and then Rin came in and saved his life.</br></br></br>  <br>what chapter is this? or is it something else?</br>  <br>Side stories are not 4koma spin off, they are canon as all shit.</br>  <br>If they are straight, so all that shit was just pandering for us? I'm fine with that</br>  <br>Chapter 19.5 of 2wei.<br><br>It went untranslated for almost two years until recently.</br></br></br>  <br>What is this show even about? I just keep seeing webms and gifs of kissing lolis.</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off FSN old hag sympathizer kids.<br>Just get out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Prisma 2wei Shirou, I mean. 3rei Shirou is completely different. That Shirou is the most GAR motherfucker in the Nasuverse.</br>  <br>Nigga, Illya ain't gonna ever win anyone that's not Miyu, get over it.</br>  <br> going for hags while your little sister who might be the cutest girl in the world swoons over you <br><br>Fucking faggot shit I swear to jesus</br></br></br>  <br> wanting lolis to lose in favor of your old hags <br>I want to kick you.</br></br>  <br><br>We honestly have no idea what Sakura's role is, since Julian obviously seems to be able to make him think he's her senpai, and that Shirou was shocked she was even there. When she exited, she acted like she thought she was in school. It's obvious brainwashing.<br><br>We have no idea what Hiroyama has planned. Alexandrite proves he is indeed a Rin fan, but he makes just as many jokes about her. So let's just wait to see where it goes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't, but expecting Illya to win the Shiroubowl is unrealistic, and he's a shit character anyway.</br>  <br>seriously who would want that bisexual used up twintailed butt slut?</br>  <br>Holy shit my coworker was just wondering why my table is levitating. French kissing is my fucking jam.</br>  <br> Sakura was almost nonexistent until recently <br>Wasn't there a side story where Rina nd Luvia beat the shit out of Prisma Shirou and Sakura came along and assisted him? I don't think, if Hiroyama is such a Rin fag, would he do such a thing.<br><br><br>One of the side stories.<br><br><br>I know they're canon, but come on. Most of them don't have much impact in the main storyline.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin winning Shirou removes the series from lolicon status though</br>  <br>Oh I'm sure this version of Sakura is going to get help, but her role in 3rei has not exactly been flattering up to this point.</br>  <br> Wasn't there a side story where Rina nd Luvia beat the shit out of Prisma Shirou and Sakura came along and assisted him? I don't think, if Hiroyama is such a Rin fag, would he do such a thing. <br><br>Yeah, that's part one of the Girl's Situation story arc. It ended with this big flag here, and continued on with this chapter. </br></br></br>  <br>What are the BD specials? Are they worth tracking down? I just got caught up.</br>  <br>The last part of the story basically had her becoming way more involved with the high jump situation than either Sakura or her counterpart in the main canon. She nurses him after he hurts himself from jumping.</br>  <br>First BD special of season 1 is all I can say is worthy, but it is glorious.</br>    <br> not real doujin <br> just an illustration in an 8 pages book <br>FUCK</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sakura actually actively pursued being his friend and becomes part of his family with Taiga not long after the high jump, while Rin didn't pursue the crush until the war. Here it still hasn't gone much further than that.<br><br>I mean, it's good development, but barely anything noteworthy beyond her getting his motivation and understanding her feelings better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is there so much fucking Shirou in the manga anyway? That faggot is ruining muh lolis.</br>  <br>That's because she left the country. She outright says she was so shaken up from dealing with him that she left Japan.<br><br>The chapter follows from Shirou being concerned about her not being around and visiting her.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin's started raising flags with Miyu's Shirou too though.<br><br>Is she trying to build a Shirou harem?</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta collect them all.</br>  <br><br>That is why I am saying it is decent development, as opposed to both just holding a crush/admiration for four years and never interacting much if at all, which is the opposite of what Sakura did.<br><br>Of course, Hiroyama also doesn't give us any development for either Sakura though yet. Which saddens me, but I went into the manga just focused on Ilya.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's actually the other way around I think.<br><br>As long as it's a Shirou it will raise flags with every girl ever.</br></br></br>  <br>They're collecting enough Shirous so they can each have their own.</br>  <br>Prisma Sakura seems to be kind of an enigma. Rin only seems vaguely aware of her, so she not even be aware she's her sister, or hell, she could straight up not be her sister at all.<br><br>I mean look at the latest arc in 3rei. She didn't seem to care at all that the one with the Lancelot card was Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br>Did she even know Lancelot was Sakura? She was pretty far away.</br>  <br><br><br>I once got told by an anon that the story in Prisma diverged from the mainline story of Fate that it's even possible Sakura isn't her sister here.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin hopped in while Berserkura was still around, so she had a decent chance of recognizing her. Though she might have been too preoccupied with helping Shirou.</br>  <br><br>Either way, unlike our two tsunderes, Sakura ain't beating around the bush here. Takes him to the nurses office for some late night "healing".</br></br>  <br>Loli Brock's big sister still has the most flags raised with Fluffy Shirou though.</br>  I wonder how Silver Link will deal with Miyu Shirou's character design when the time comes.<br><br>In the manga his build isn't THAT different from Prisma Shirou's (just a bit more swole) but Silver Link made Prisma Shirou into a skinny fuccboi. <br><br>Will they slim down Miyu Shirou as well or will they keep him swole and make Prisma Shirou seem even more twiggy in comparison?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if that was just early Hiroyama art or something but dude, Prisma Shirou looked like a fucking kid in the manga too.</br>  <br>Careful, Sakura's idea of "healing" might be a bit different depending on the circumstances and reality.</br>  <br>Sakuralot figure when?</br>  <br> that headtilt </br>  <br><br> Wanting bland uninteresting self-insert to win over loli yuri </br></br>  <br>Things get leaked before their official sale date all the time. Shounen Jump is a popular example because it gets leaked nearly a week before its sales date. It's all a matter of knowing which store to go to that'll put things on sale earlier than they're supposed to.</br>    <br>This pasta is stale</br>  <br><br>It's still rather obvious that she is being manipulated. Saying that is like saying when Kuro was an antagonist it somehow wasn't flattering. It's just a story element.</br></br>  <br>Agreed. Nice pic tho</br>  <br>I don't want to start a big waifu war, but Sakura basically showed up to be evil, and then have Rin come in to save the day.</br>  lolis are the most pleb fetish  <br>Pleb in general, or pleb within /a/? Because 'normies' are staunchly anti-loli.</br>  <br>what is this</br>  <br> implying I don't self-insert as Illya <br><br>If I wanted to play with pussy I'd play with my own. I'd rather get hard oniichan dickings.</br></br></br>  <br>Within /a/ obviously normies are in a class well below pleb</br>  <br>A side story.</br>  I remembered stopping after the first season, and thought why not finish the remaining episodes and extras. I'm finally done.<br>If Prisma Illya taught me anything, it's that you shouldn't come 7 times in a non stop 4 hours long fap spree, because it will hurt like hell.</br>  What special of second season is this and is it subbed yet?  Why fuck fuck does this have to ball so many of my favourite fetishes together and then almost go the full distance. So much tease, a little delivery and something I can never let someone see because preteen lesbians making out for the purpose of extending ones life span is not a good excuse for why we are watching loli yuri softcore porn.  <br>and there's people saying they are straight. <br><br><br>Humour and fight are good, especially in the manga, if you finished 2 route + Tsukuhime, you should be able to understand some of the jokes. Worth a try, even if I can't assure you if you gonna like it or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm straight and I make out with my bros all the time.</br>  <br>what is it called</br>  <br><br>It has nothing to do with waifu wars.

Something that could prevent other tales from ever being canonised.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait for the movie. If the movie deals with the championship, answer is (obviously) no, unless they retcon the movie.

Is it possible that in volume 58, chapter 558, on the 3rd box of the 11th page, I see the 3rd person (Sabo)'s cup? P.N. Saitouryu<br><br>O:Wow- again, looking at those teeny parts. The answer is easy, if you read chapter 585 in this volume, you'll see the same scene and you'll be able to tell it's Sabo's cup, but at the time in chapter 558, "Brothers", if I revealed Sabo, things would get complicated, so I secretly drew it. Still, from back then, there were many readers pointing out "what is this", and I seriously freaked out. What in the world are you people!! You're correct!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's convenient writing which makes it so bad as there was no reason for this cliche to show up for such an important character</br>  <br>That's not what bad writing means.</br>  <br> convinient writing in a battle manga for kids <br>oh god help us</br></br>  <br> 558 <br> 585 <br> foreshadowing 27 chapters is amazing xD <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda foreshadowed Sabo since Alabasta.</br>  <br><br>Maybe you didn't realise it yet, but One Piece is one of the best or even the best battle shounen out there. You expect better things for it than you would for shit series like Fairy Tail.</br></br>  <br>Yes, as you just showed, he is good at foreshadowing. So why did he have to give Sabo amnesia rather than, well, giving him a good and plot-relevant reason why he couldn't show up?</br>  <br> implying Odas writing never was convinient at any point before  <br>are you deluded or something?</br></br>  <br>Yes. And amnesia is a really weak excuse, especially for Oda who, as you pointed out yet again, is pretty good at foreshadowing.</br>  <br> Seems legit. I think the biggest problem I'm finding here is absolutely no explanation of the Devil Fruits. Not even a hand-wavy explanation. They're obviously important to the series, and are as big a mystery to the characters in the series as they are to the reader. <br>I think it's mainly because we've got fuck all to go on. The most we've learned about them in years was with Smiley at Punk Hazard.<br><br> Also, there's a lot of baseless speculation like "All of these races came from the moons". While it's a nice theory, it really has fuck-all backing it up. Some pictures of moons in no way indicate that dwarves/giants/longecks/longarms/mi<wbr>nks/etc. came from various moons. That's a crazy stretch to make.</wbr> <br>I agree. That's about as fanfictiony as it gets. I like the idea but it's entirely baseless. I was just saying that in the other thread, I'm not sure that the Ohara model is anything to go by. If something happened to the moons, it happened during the void century and was covered up. Currently the only moon in the sky is Fairy Vearth. If they were doing their research in secret in the basement, they wouldn't have a fuck off huge model in the main hall that exclaims WE KNOW SOMETHING WE SHOULDNT. Truth is, we don't know anything about the Ohara model and it could be something else entirely. All that we know for certain is that there is one moon.<br><br> It's really clever, though. I liked it. I really enjoy the fan theories. One Piece is an impressively large world that has really rich lore. Oda really fucking knows how to do worldbuilding. <br>Oh definitely! Of all the stretching that it does, I'm totally in for the Punk Hazard/Elbaf/Uranus link. That's just the kind of easter-egg you don't know that you're seeing that Oda loves. Other than that, the D/Moon People theory seems pretty legit from what Greg said. I suppose it's just interesting when someone manages to put it all into perspective</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never this badly.</br>  <br>then tell us a good reason that leaves no plot holes besides amnesia</br>  <br>Because he was lazy and wanted to create a simple explanation that doesn't warrant further questioning.<br><br>Not guy you're replying to, but hey. Oda clearly had other shit to deal with that wasn't coming up with an interesting/complex but understandable reason for Sabo to not contact Ace or Luffy before now.<br><br>It was bland, lazy, cliched, and uninspired, but it did the job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not even the worst part.<br> i forgot everything <br> okay let's give him back to the parents <br> N-no actually there's this instinct i just awakened and shit that tells me to not return to my parents <br>Really Oda?</br></br></br></br></br>  Favourite foreshadowing?<br><br>The kids talking about Doflamingo's awakening attacks about 30 chapters before the reader will understand what it properly means</br></br>  <br> Don't really have an explanation why he wouldn't contact Luffy and Ace though. <br>And this is what you just can't cover with anything else but amnesia. <br><br>Why are people so butthurt about it anyway? Getting amnesia after being blown up seems pretty reasonable to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering one of One Piece's major themes is<br> Man only dies when he is forgotten <br>And a major fucking plot point of Dressrosa was the tragedy of forgetting your loved ones with the toys and shit, I'd say it's not that much of a hurr dur plot point considering that. It's cliche and convenient, yes. But it fits well with the theme of the arc and honestly it's pretty tragic you heartless plebs. Luffy and Sabo's reunion was pretty touching too.</br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>The story of One Piece would be fundamentally different for there to be no plotholes without the amnesia thing.<br><br>So it is Oda's fault if he really did plan so far ahead for Sabo to appear and then write him in with such a cheap trick.</br></br></br>  <br>Please god no</br>  <br> Favourite foreshadowing? <br>Luffy defeated Mr.3 using unawakened observation haki.</br></br>  <br>(G)Oda theres the G.</br>  <br> plot-relevant reason why he couldn't show up <br><br>There's your problem, it wasn't that Sabo wasn't there at Marineford, but the whole life he went missing without trying to contact neither Ace, Garp, Dadan or Luffy.</br></br></br>  <br>No but she will join a gladiator crew as professional cumdumpster,she's used to it anyway</br>  <br>After Monet.</br>  <br>One of my favorites is Rayleigh first appearing in Chapter 19.</br>  <br>I'm totally on board with there being six moons, with a seventh orbiting one of the other six, and all but one is destroyed. I feel like that might be a good way to explain a bit of the world's fucked up shit. It makes more sense than say, Oars Sr. moving continents. He's large, but he's not that large.<br><br>But yeah, it seems we both agree that there's a lot of stretching for things due to lack of information. I'm hoping they're right on some of this stuff, like with Uranus/Elbaf/Punk Hazard. It might just be a weapon that creates giants. They're pretty fucking terrifying.</br></br></br>  Why didnt Luffy sink when Higuma knocked his tiny rubber ass into the ocean?  <br>That is not foreshadowing</br>  <br>Come on now. Luffy's always had good instincts but it's most likely not a haki instance.<br><br>It's possible he was considering a version of haki around that time to get it ready for Skypiea though, so perhaps.</br></br></br>  Reminder that he is Rayleigh's brother.  <br> characters appearing before a proper introduction is not foreshadowing <br>Why even ask the question then if you're forcing your own definition upon everyone else?  That's mostly rhetorical. </br></br>  <br> Tonfa Mace <br>I will never understand why Gin thought that would be a good weapon.<br><br>You put 2 shit tier weapons together and you get even more shit.<br>Gin has shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hes okay though because Gin never shouted his attack names like a dork</br>  <br>Nothing foreshadows him meeting with the strawhats. It's not foreshadowing of anything.</br>  <br>Yes it is.<br> When Shanks and Buggy were first revealed to be part of Roger's crew, a fan asked Oda in a SBS question if the man that scolded them was a subordinate captain under Roger that commanded the ship they were sailing on, or even a high ranking officer. Without giving away Rayleigh's name at the time, Oda responded that this man was none other than the first mate of Roger's crew. Oda also stated in his response that since he had set this fact in stone from the very start, he told Toei Animation that when they adapt Buggy's flashback for the anime, Buggy and Shanks should not refer to Rayleigh as Captain in the anime. </br></br>  <br>Thats what happens when you write yourself into a corner, there are alot more options as to what oda could have gone with. but no matter What he chose. people were going to bitch about it</br>  <br>What the fuck, this tenryubito seems like a cool guy. Unless he's a civilian in disguise. Yeah, that's more likely.</br>  <br>Fine then. Luffy tackling Smoker's back using unawakened armament haki in Alabasta.</br>  <br> And a major fucking plot point of Dressrosa was the tragedy of forgetting your loved ones with the toys and shit, <br>The fact that Sabo was introduced in this arc, damn. Whether it was on purpose or not, that's a nice touch.</br></br>  <br> there are alot more options as to what oda could have gone with. <br>then tell us, so far nobody could name a convincing alternative that does not leave any plot holes</br></br>  <br> It was bland, lazy, cliched, and uninspired, but it did the job. <br>The job is to have a good story. Not just have a logical story. So, yeah, it made the story work, but it didn't make it good.<br><br><br>So why did he plan so far ahead then? Surely he could have come up with something better. He controls what is happening.<br><br>Sure, getting amnesia might be reasonable. But a good plot is not about wether it would make sense in the real world. It is about how well the plot points are connected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother trying to prove him wrong. That guy won't accept anything other than his own opinion.</br>  <br>Yeah, there's no guards shoving everyone to the ground or anything. It's weird.<br><br>I feel like even if he were a civilian dressing up, people would freak out and bow anyway. Then someone would discover he's a fake and he'd be murdered.</br></br></br>  <br>Since Fishman Island, we can probably get a lot more from this page than we could.<br><br>Ship on the right? Pluton<br>Sea Kings underneath? Poseidon<br>Green thing on the left? Uranus<br><br>It's crazy how much story that Enel cover story has in it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Im more curious as to how God tier Haki users ever get contained or captured. its fair enough with devil fruit users as Seastone weakens them. but can you guys honestly tell me anyone above Rob Luccy level without a devil fruit could be contained?  <br>easy<br><br>Sabo is the pandaman. The new one. Dragon was the first one</br></br></br>  <br>over here retard  </br>  <br>Funny</br>  <br>A story that isn't logical is never good. Even One Piece, with all its kinks and weird stuff that happens isn't an exception.</br>  <br>Impel Down was full of non-Haki using shitters and DF users, so I imagine most of the presumably few Haki users are dicking around on the outside, like Rayleigh.</br>  <br>My anus is not green.</br>  <br>I said "convincing alternative that does not leave plot holes" you stupid fuck</br>  <br>How would you know ? Did you check ?</br>  <br>This  post pointed the plothole within, retard.</br>  <br>At least those replies are more foreshadowing than your post.</br>  <br>Non of them leaves any plot holes you autist<br><br> inb4 hurr durr why didn't he contact ace and luffy <br>Because he has his own fucking life as a rev and all of them had their own adventures to do. That's why Ace didn't take luffy with him to fight BB.</br></br></br></br>  <br>read the last sentence faggot</br>  <br>-He was locked up. On a mission in a far away country and was , so he didn't hear about it.<br>-Was too far to travel and didnt make it in time<br>-Dragon forbid it as he didnt want the revilutionaries to be involved more then Iva allready was. or Dragon had a speciffic reason (god knows with him as we know nothing about him or his motivations)<br>-Off tranning on a Island like Luffy was where he could get no news from the outside world<br>-Injured in a battle and was unconceous, then tried to go but was too weak. Again Dragon forbidding him from going.<br>Should i keep going or what?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> characters appearing before a proper introduction is not foreshadowing <br>No? That doesn't foreshadow any event. If any character hinted at him reappearing later it would be,but as it is it's just a character that will come back later.</br></br>  <br>That's not true though, is it?</br>  <br><br>see , it's literally not a plot hole if we follow the known one piece logic autistic mach 20 reader.</br></br>  So it's pretty obvious that Dragon's gotten a Crow devil fruit from this chapter.  <br>I never said a story should not be logical. A story should be logical. But just being logical is not enough for making a story good.</br>  <br> Because he has his own fucking life as a rev and all of them had their own adventures to do. <br>yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. THIS is shit writing.</br></br>  <br>That's not very convincing. And it's not a hurr durr.</br>  <br>There's a difference between "not taking your kid brother along in a duel to the death" and "not telling your brothers you are alive for over a decade"</br>  <br> The kids talking about Doflamingo's awakening attacks about 30 chapters before <br> the flashback was almost a year ago <br><br>Jesus Christ</br></br></br></br>  Sabo should have never existed. What a horribly boring Mary Sue.  <br>Are you fucking serious? haha, holy shit</br>  <br>Ace hadn't seen Luffy in 3 years yet he went out of his way to meet Luffy even though he was on a mission for WB. Yet you tell me Sabo not getting in contact with Ace even though he hadn't seen him in 15 years and knew exactly where to find him makes sense ?</br>  <br>Even if you don't have a power, seastone is still hard as fuck.</br>  <br>No less than skewering punishment.</br>  <br>You so stupid.</br>  <br> yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. <br>He did say goodby through the act of sailing out you retard di you even read the manga?<br><br><br><br><br> implying Sabo would go all the way back to east blue for that without knowing where luffy is now exactly <br><br><br>Ace was almost at the same destination as luffy and not doing shit around the new world as sabo obviously did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Granted there was Mangellan guarding it. but i find it really hard to understand how there has never been someone strong enough to escape before luffy. Its not like Haki is a new concept to the world. It fully seems like there are people who can simply not be contained.<br>-Garp<br>-Shishikubai<br>-certain giants<br>-Yonko</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These only explain why he could not be at MF you fuck, the more important part is why did he not contact Luffy or Ace in 10 fucking years or did not even say goodbye to them before leaving with the revs.</br>  I'm more curious to know why/how Sabo, of all people, ended up becoming the Revolutionary Second-in-Command.  <br>Fine. Suppose my anus is green. Then your head looks like my anus.</br>  <br>holy shit you make me cringe, just stop</br>  <br>Yeah, but that's an actual foreshadowing. Something that was actually mentioned ahead of the time of it's reveal. It's just as much foreshadowing as Rosinante hiding on the cover of 691, 70 chapters before his introduction.<br><br>You shoehorning haki in, earlier than it was in the series isn't foreshadowing. Your fanfiction isn't haki. Mantra is the earliest version.</br></br></br>  <br> yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. <br><br> "not telling your brothers you are alive for over a decade" <br><br>From Sabo's PoV Ace/Luffy would've never thought died, and before he left he sent them a letter saying goodbye and declaring that they'd meet again someday out on the sea when they'd all become strong pirates</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He would have come to Logue Town with Dragon.</br>  <br> I have no arguments  <br>Good for you</br></br>  <br>and you think considering Sabo's character he wouldnt have contacted any of them to at least tell them he was alive? Are you retarded? Or do you not give a shit about consistancy in character and plot and only care about m-muh unique plotlines hurr durr</br>  <br>Im pretty comfortable with it being Revolutinary reasons. YOU FUCK<br>After joining Dragon his cause was greater then finding Ace or Luffy. When all 3 of them agreed on walking their own paths anyway. its not like Luffy and Ace were exactly trying to find each other EVER unless a speciffic reason like Ace knew Blackbeard was hunting Luffy</br></br>  <br>Oda could have just using one of those faces as Rosinate design.</br>  <br>Sea prism stone is also rare as fuck, and getting enough to construct a cage out of is really tough. If you do get a cage like that, odds are you're throwing a DF user in there, not some asshole.<br><br>Besides, I wouldn't be surprised if Mihawk (and eventually Zoro) could cut through it.<br><br><br> implying Sabo would go all the way back to east blue <br>At any point he could have gone back, sent a letter, you name it. Ace took time out of chasing down Blackbeard to GO BACKWARDS THROUGH THE GRAND LINE just to say hi to Luffy.<br>That shit is not a cakewalk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because he is strong?</br>  so, I'm rereading the aftermath of the marine ford arc and one thing came to my mind<br>how in the fuck did law managed to get out of the calm belt without help?</br>  <br>No. Conqueror is the earliest.</br>  <br> After joining Dragon his cause was greater then finding Ace or Luffy. <br>that would contradict Sabos character completely. I hope you will never write a story.</br></br>  <br>He was probably just a no-name before the war.<br><br>After he heard of Ace's death and got his memories back he probably trained and got strong as fuck.<br><br>And in 2 years he became the number 2 in the Revolutionary.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's like we've entered into an endless recursion of time.    <br>You can't combine two memes like that.

He only loses to plot-convenience, asspull shield of fairy magic and "Ea is too good for you".  Yadayadayada once in a lifetime opportunity yadayadayada some root yadayadayada mage's pride yadayadayada associated artifacts aren't necessarily easy to find so you might luck out yadayadayada  Because most heroes are more balanced, and the chance of him being summoned is fairly low out of all the other heroes and means of obtaining catalysts.  <br>I'm assuming the same heroes aren't summoned that often unless the summoner has something that ties to them specifically. Saber was only re-summoned because Excalibur's scabbard is inside Shirou and Gil was only around because he never left after Zero</br>   is a copy made by the Grail <br> calls other people fakers <br><br>Fatefags explain this.</br></br></br>  <br> and the chance of him being summoned is fairly low out of all the other heroes and means of obtaining catalysts. <br>Meanwhile he's the single most reoccurring character within the Fate franchise topping even Saber in terms of how many grail wars he's featured in.</br></br>  Because they're so lazy that they can't come up with another antagonist.  <br>And only two of those are proper summonings out of X amount of grail wars. In Apo with hundreds of wars going on, his catalysts are dried up and make him impossible to forcibly summon.</br>  Question. It said that had Lancer had a better master/resorted to other tactics, he couldve won the war. How would Diarmuid even do anything to Gil? Gae Dearg before GOB? Im confused.  <br>Kayneth would have waited for Lancelot or Saber to be the last man standing.</br>  <br>It probably assumes that Gil does something stupid and gets ganked by someone. It's not like Deermud would solo the whole thing by himself.</br>  <br>By the way, in the Fourth Holy Grail War, the following strategy would insure the absolute victory of Team Lancer:<br><br>Kayneth must not let his Servant recognize such things as honour on the battle field or knights' pride. He must let Diarmuid realize that the Holy Grail War was merely dirty chores that needed to be done.<br><br>In order to fulfill the previous item, Kayneth must avoid any contact between Diarmuid and Saber with his best effort.<br><br>In combat, Kayneth must prioritize securing an exit. In a battle, missions would be considered accomplished if Diarmuid scored one hit with Gae Buidhe. Repeat this tactic, and exhaust all hostile teams.<br><br>Capitalize on Team Berserker. Team Berserker was a powerful enemy against all other teams, but Lancer had an advantage due to compatibility. It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there any heroes or NP who can defeat Saber with Avalon protection on ?  <br>Hit and run tactics? Would that work?</br>  Why even participate in the Grail War when the grail is useless and you will never reach the root?  <br>Against Gil, probably not. He should have thousands of healing NPs, one of which could certainly reverse the effects of the curse, assuming Deermud could even land a hit on him. Probably more of something like Gil fights Saber, Berserker interrupts, Gil wounds Berserker and goes back to Saber, and then distracted Gil gets his head cut off by Berserker.</br>  <br>Jack.</br>  Cu V EMIYA = Cu wins due to Protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gay Bulge HOWEVER EMIYA can potentially Caladbolg Cu from a long way away.<br>Cu V Gilgamesh = Gilgamesh wins due to Enkidu and probably sword spamming Cu to not let him Gae Bolg.<br>Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them.<br>Gilgamesh V Herakles = Enkidu holds down Herakles pretty damn well, and plus Herakles was protecting Ilya at the time.<br>Medusa V Herakles = I can't see Herakles losing.<br>Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles. On the other, Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe.<br>Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance.<br>Medusa V Iskander = Cybele. Nuff said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Cybele should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gae Bolg them. <br>R U N E S<br>U<br>N<br>E<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cu V Iskander <br> Could go either way <br>Yeah, against the guy who literally fought armies for breakfast by himself, has an Anti-Army NP and a one hit kill NP. Not to mention pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Medusa is such a shit character.</br>  <br>Armies of regular soldiers, maybe a hero or two tossed in here or there. These guys are all Servants. It's not going to be repeated one-hit kills or anything like that. They're all a viable threat to him unlike fodder familiars. Think CoB's golems but more dangerous and more numerous. Gae Bolg would be lucky to take out hundreds, not amounting to anything grand in the face of tens of thousands.</br>  <br>Fate/HA makes her better.</br>  <br><br>No, they're not all Heroic Spirits. There are a lot of Heroic Spirits amongst Iskander's army, but most are ordinary soldiers for obvious reasons (like his messenger he sent to meet Waver while he was holding off the big Cthulhu monster).</br></br>  <br> Not to mention pic related. <br><br>That rune only makes it so neither party its cast on can retreat, not that no one else can interfere.<br><br>It would be full retard to cast it in that situation, it would just mean Cu cannot move when the rest of the army attacks him. The other guy can't move either, but others can get involved.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're all heroes of their own making according to the text. And Mithrenes was some notable commander of his army.</br>  <br><br>Probably not, but at the same time, Saber can't defeat anyone while she's in Avalon due to, you know, being in another dimension. It's an absolute defense, but by the same token, makes offense impossible. That's why she had to drop out of Avalon in order to finish Gil off, and why she couldn't have just turned on godmode at the start of the fight. As Saber pointed out mentally during the battle, the path she was following was the only way for her to win. She needed to bait Gil into using Ea so that she could reflect it back with Avalon. If she had just started off by turtling inside Avalon, Gilgamesh would have just waited for the moment she dropped out and blown her away.</br></br>  <br>I know but her F/SN presence is so bad.</br>  Gill a shit.<br> grab Gil's NPs <br> stick them in the ground everywhere <br> run and jump like a ginger <br> throws the NPs back as needed <br> Unlimited Theft Works <br> Gill get's desperate, and pulls out EA <br> Lancelot uses Arondight to chop Gills arm off before he uses it <br>Like poetry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Gil can literally wreck him, Saber, Rider, Lancer, Caster, and Assassin in a single night all by himself.</br>  <br><br>They're not all heroes by definition. Heroes are those who stand out amongst the rest. While it's true that humanity was simply stronger back during the Age of Gods, it is also true that the heroes of that era were that much superior to the rest or else they would not have become legends. <br><br>The vast majority of Iskander's army has to be 'ordinary', but they can still be relatively powerful. That being said, the same goes for the armies that Cu Chulainn defeated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe<br><br>They have gone out of their way to say there's no such thing as an omnipotent NP in reality. Everything has checks and balances.<br><br>You could hover blades or release some kind of virus in the area so that the second she rematerialized into the world, she dies. There's a reason she didn't just activate it at the beginning of the battle with GIl, and instead kept it secret like a trump card. She wasn't taking chances, she was playing smart, she wasn't letting the chance that it might be countered exist by only showing it when it was too late for Gil to do anything.<br><br>The possibilities might exist that there's a strategy around it, but she used it in a way that didn't allow the opponent to think around it at all. Which was the smartest thing she's ever done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Iskander's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Iskander would certainly lose. However, Iskander could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Iskander's army but eh. The problem is Iskander won't let Cu cast Gae Bolg even once, but Cu still has a fair chance. <br>Or Cu can just stall out his army until Gaia finally gets off her ass and breaks his RM, then Cu wrecks his shit when he's low on mana.</br></br>  <br><br>He was going to die to the 32 NP burst. Urobuchi agreed, don't bother him about it.</br></br>  <br>Nah, Lancelot literally BTFO Gill in that dog fight. If he didn't have such a Saber Boner he could've won the war.</br>  <br>Gil is the weakest and a shit:<br><br> TMF : Bon, ben la dernière question de l’interview. Si Gilgamesh était sérieux quand il combattait Saber, qui gagnerait ? <br> U : Le problème est qu’un Gilgamesh sérieux, ça n’existe pas. Mais, si jamais ça arrivait et qu’il combattait Saber, aucun ne gagnerait. C’est Nasu qui l’a dit. <br><br> TMF : If Gilgamesh was serious when fighting Saber, who would win? <br> Uro : The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. But, if that were to ever happen and he was fighting Saber. No one would win. Nasu said so. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. <br><br>The moment Iskander comes in close, he's done. He has no defense against Gae Bolg, and if Lancer uses his runes he can prevent Iskander from being able to retreat. If Iskander pops his reality marble, all Cu has to do is play keep away until Iskander runs out of power. Keep in mind that Cu fought Gilgamesh for 12 hours straight. If he goes full defense, he's practically unkillable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He was going to die to the 32 NP burst. Urobuchi agreed, don't bother him about it. <br> He doesn't know that Urobuchi contracted himself when other servants with shitter stats than Lancelot surviving greater numbers volumes later </br></br>  <br>Do you have anymore quotes? That sounds pretty interesting.</br>  <br> Serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist <br><br>We've seen it a few times now<br><br>Its a bit outdated to say that<br><br> Gil: "This woman is a worthy oponent. My chains and sword, let me use them as I please, Master!" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you're referring to Iskander's last valiant charge against Gilgamesh, he was mortally wounded by the time he reached Gilgamesh, and Gilgamesh was just playing around with his Gate of Babylon spam too - only a few of his shots went anywhere near Iskander to begin with. It was nothing like when he pinpoint targeted Lancelot with each and every shot.</br></br>  <br> Cu fought Gilgamesh for 12 hours straight <br>That was pure speculation, and even if it was true, it's more likely that was because Gil was toying with Cu instead of simply using Enkidu from the beginning.</br></br>  <br>No, the text literally says they're all heroic spirits of their own accord. Even the horse.</br>  <br> In legend, the dying Cú Chulainn tied himself to a tree, and then took his final breath facing the enemy army. True to his legendary tenacity, he struggles fiercely on the verge of death. Cú Chulainn demonstrated miraculous determination even in a hopeless fight, continuing to stall Gilgamesh for half a day. </br>  <br><br>It's not speculation, I'm pretty sure it's said outright in the VN. You also don't fight against Gilgamesh that long without him becoming bored unless he's not just playing around.</br></br>  <br> That was pure speculation <br><br>It isn't, Its literally stated in CM<br><br> Battle Continuation: A <br> In legend, the dying Cú Chulainn tied himself to a tree, and then took his final breath facing the enemy army. True to his legendary tenacity, he struggles fiercely on the verge of death. Cú Chulainn demonstrated miraculous determination even in a hopeless fight, continuing to stall Gilgamesh for half a day. <br> When facing Emiya, who dexterously fended off spear thrusts with his dual swords, Cú Chulainn unyieldingly stood his ground. <br><br>Dunno why people have to get autistic about that one "No it didn't happen, doesn't count", as though it offends them.<br><br>Says that Battle Continuation was the greatest part of how he was able to keep going.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure Nasu retconned that in an interview somewhere for the exact reasons I just gave.</br></br>  <br> It's not speculation, I'm pretty sure it's said outright in the VN <br>Yes, by Shirou, in speculation.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh got bored after twenty minutes fighting against Lancelot<br><br>You think he was having so fun of a time against Cu that he just never wanted it to end? I can guarantee ten minutes into that he was quite furious.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Yes, by Shirou, in speculation. <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> If you're referring to Iskander's last valiant charge against Gilgamesh, he was mortally wounded by the time he reached Gilgamesh, and Gilgamesh was just playing around with his Gate of Babylon spam too <br> Iskander clearly avoided them Gilgamesh in that fight went a bit more serious than usual out of respect for Iskander. The only real thing that fucked him up was the chains. <br>  It was nothing like when he pinpoint targeted Lancelot with each and every shot. <br>Lancelot is a small and fast target or smaller hit box and harder to get a lock on him. He would've got out of the line of fire with his A+ agility.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, JETS wouldn't be as easy or fun to banter with as Cu.<br> He probably did get furious after at most an hour, but I like fan canon that Gil was taking the opportunity to sort through his treasury since he doesn't know everything he owns </br></br>  <br>There was mention on BL where he contradicts himself in the same sentence saying they are heroes and aren't heroes. It was never translated.</br>  <br>In Gil's defence, part of the reason for Iskander's extra long charge was Waver's Command Seal to tell him to win the fight.</br>  <br><br> Iskander clearly avoided them Gilgamesh in that fight went a bit more serious than usual out of respect for Iskander. <br><br>There was no way Iskander could avoid 80 noble phantasms even on a horse. He knocked one or two away and took a couple wounds from others, and the rest just rained down all around him. If you ask me, Gilgamesh was just being courteous and making his last charge look cool out of respect. The only 'serious' thing he did was use Ea to destroy Iskander's reality marble, use his chains to stop Iskander in his tracks, and then kill him with Ea personally. <br><br> Lancelot is a small and fast target or smaller hit box and harder to get a lock on him. <br><br>He's not that much smaller than Iskander. He's a big guy. He's fast thanks to his agility, but nowhere near as fast as anyone on a mount, like Iskander. Remember that he failed to dodge Iskander's chariot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he failed to dodge Iskander's chariot <br>Oh fuck off, idiot. That was because he was concentrating on Saber and Iskander literally charged in to Lancelot's blind spot. If Lancelot had noticed Iskander coming in, he never would have been hit.</br></br>  <br>Kuzuki would probably still kick her ass</br>  <br><br>Lancelot did notice the charge. He simply failed to get out of the way in time, regardless, because chariots are faster than anyone on foot. That's why Riders are known for their mobility and partially why Achilles, who has a Noble Phantasm that makes him faster than even mounts, is so ridiculously overpowered.</br></br>  <br>Not much about Gil, but here's the whole interview:<br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/<br><br>For the fate stuff, the most interesting parts is that Tokiomi knew the kind of treatment Sakura got, but he didn't give a shit, although he would have refused to give Sakura away if he knew Zouken was just using her as a womb and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. Also the Sakura Vs Rin is the best thing to ever happen to the Tohsaka family.<br>There is no gate of bayblon inside the gate of babylon.<br>Kiri views Taiga as a sister, but she's in love with him.<br>He didn't answer whether Waver will join Ionioi Hetairoi after he dies, it's a question of Waver's immortality he says. <br><br>Not fate related, but Butcher worked as a programmer before trying writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>At that point Iskander' lost his connection with Waver which the command seals made substitute of not having a master. <br><br> There was no way Iskander could avoid 80 noble phantasms<br>He simply did he used all his running speed and used his sword to knock them away while a few pierced him. <br> He's not that much smaller than Iskandar. <br>He is and we are talking about Iskandar on foot. Not with the chariot also that's due the fact Lancelot clearly having such a Saber Boner that he failed to get out of the way in time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Question.<br>Is the Grail at this point even still usable?<br>Can it be fixed?</br></br>  <br>Not likely japan's grail will be forever fucked up. This is why Waver and Rin permanently stopped it for good.</br>  <br>Can they just make a new one?</br>  <br>Fuyuki one? Not really<br><br>It'll grant a wish, but only in the sense that it'll kill everyone while doing it.<br><br>There are many grails out there though.<br><br>Grail is anything that can grant a wish, and there are over 700 citings to date. Ironically the actual holy grail cannot be counted as one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wish <br>But the grail is not actually a wish granting device.<br>It's a ritual used to reach root.</br></br></br>  <br>Command Spells /= Master connection. What Waver did was ceremoniously say "I have no possible control over you, so I'm no longer your Master." He was still connected until Rider died.</br>  <br>You don't get it<br><br>Even if its not its main function, its still something that can grant a wish. That much is confirmed that it can do this. Even though the families lied about its real purpose, it can still technically do some things.<br><br>In the sense that with near unlimited prana you can do basically anything.<br><br>The Mooncell wasn't created to be a wishing device, its something that observes all of the world and galaxy to collect all information ever. It can however still technically grant a wish, so its considered a holy grail.<br><br>It was not made to do it, it was built to do far bigger things, but if it can do it, then it qualifies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, anything that can grant a wish can be used to reach Root?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128495929 <br>Nasu is very insecure about his writing, and tries all the time to get better:<br><br> Takeuchi: Fate prototype existed on looseleaf, handwritten pages. We made photocopies of the original and then carefully stored the original manuscript for safekeeping. A lot has changed since then, but some special lines and other things from it still remain. As an example, in the original the Assassin Servant took on the identity of Sasaki Kojirou.  <br> <br> Interviewer: If we can find the time, I'd love to see the original. <br><br> Nasu: If that text became known to others, I would have to take my own life. I don't like the prose I wrote back when I was in middle school. You wouldn't even need to use a katana to cut me down if that got out.  <br> <br> Urobuchi: No, I'm sure you've forgotten the content as the years went by. If you looked over it now and released it, you'd be absolutely fine. From a critical and objective viewpoint, you can say "Wow, this greenhorn punk is really trying hard."  <br> <br> Nasu: Now that you've seen through me like a pane of glass, I wonder things are really that different even after all these years. It's embarrassing and weak - a double blend that will surely do me in. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   TMF: Do Tokiomi knew what was suffered Sakura after it was adopted by the Mato? <br> U: What is important is not to Tokiomi parentage but magical progress in his family. So it is aware of having literally threw his daughter. One can imagine that Tokiomi says that through his beloved daughter, he will arrive to have higher thaumaturgic powers. <br><br>[Outside interview]<br> Tokiomi knew what was going to undergo Sakura but for him, it would allow it to become a real magician. As long as it increases the potential thaumaturgical of his family, he had no problem with Sakura treatments in Mato. However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused. He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. Unconsciously, even if he would never have said, the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br> By against Aoi knew nothing. <br><br>Google translate does French a lot better than it does Japanese at least</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128496162 <br>Are those the 2x2=Shinobuden ninjas?</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128496532 <br>When something is expected to happen on a certain day and you're anticipating it, that day's called the "Jour J". It's a way to describe a special upcoming day during which you expect a certain event to take place.<br>I don't know how to explain it clearly though.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Interesting.<br><br>So 100% EA can't break through it? This thing seems to rip apart everything when maxed out. (world, dimension, RM, ect)<br><br>What about Nero's NP? The one that ignores the opponent's defense.<br><br>Anyway, I mostly agree that Avalon is a trump card. Saber needed to rely on the surprise effect since she's inoffensive when using it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   TMF: One last question Fate / Zero before moving on. How would he have reacted Tokiomi learning his relationship with Rin in Unlimited Blade Works and Sakura in Heaven's Feel? [Laughs] <br> U: It is not impossible that he would have been green with rage because it would penalize her magical power quest. <br><br>People that go "Tokomi would be on his head with joy if he heard about Shirou banging his daughters, I mean a reality marble user, that's top class" BTFO suddenly. No that was never going to be his reaction there.<br><br>No reality marbles are not hereditary, and he would have just seen Shirou as an abysmal waste at best. At worst he'd either dissect Shirou himself or call the magic cops to place a sealing order on him, because Tokiomi is the standard magus and that's what they do. When you find a heretic you report it, as even Rin mentions.<br><br>Reality Marble is ones internal world, it doesn't help to go to someone else and its not something the child gets, or else a lot more people would be running around with the. Its like saying that if Buhhda had a child, that child would automaticall receive Enlightenment.<br><br>Its more about the mind and perception, potential, understanding of the user. All humans can use a reality marble with enough time, but it usually takes hundreds of years to figure it out, which is why DAA tend to have them.<br><br>All Shirou would be is a deterrent to their talent for him<br><br>No he wouldn't be well received.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much, Tokiomi would have treated Shirou just like Kariya.</br>  <br>And here I am still waiting for Siegfried to be summon...</br>  <br>dot dot dot</br>  <br>Would he? I mean especially if it was the Shirou who beat Gilgamesh. He certainly wouldn't like Shirou, but he might be pretty cautious not to piss him off.</br>  <br> He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. <br><br>Is he stupid? She's eight years old and was never taught a single thing in terms of magecraft, even if she has "potential". Due to the way his craft works, the second he starts working on the target and starts "training them" they cannot go against him at all, or else they will be eaten alive from the inside out since he has things inside of them. Tokiomi knows all of this basically, yet his backup plan is the eight year old child to deal with the centuries old far more advanced and smart magus.<br><br>This is stupid, he's stupid, that's not a plan.<br><br>She was in a position where she couldn't do shit, and he knew it.<br><br>He would have to teach her at least one spell for this to actually be a plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wins via Lancelot killing everyone.</br>  <br>It doesn't, it assumes Lancelot wrecks Gil. Stop making shit up. The quote is clear.<br><br> It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point. </br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you actually read the interview in question<br><br> By the way, in the Fourth Holy Grail War, the following strategy would insure the absolute victory of Team Lancer: <br><br> Kayneth must not let his Servant recognize such things as honour on the battle field or knights' pride. He must let Diarmuid realize that the Holy Grail War was merely dirty chores that needed to be done. <br> In order to fulfill the previous item, Kayneth must avoid any contact between Diarmuid and Saber with his best effort. <br> In combat, Kayneth must prioritize securing an exit. In a battle, missions would be considered accomplished if Diarmuid scored one hit with Gae Buidhe. Repeat this tactic, and exhaust all hostile teams. <br> Capitalize on Team Berserker. Team Berserker was a powerful enemy against all other teams, but Lancer had an advantage due to compatibility. It would be optimal to let Berserker destroy the other teams and reach the finale. He could then be defeated at that point.  <br><br>If that strategy can be followed to a key, then he can win easily enough<br><br>Notice it says its "Optimal" to use Lancelot, not "necessary" like some people think.<br><br>If he can cripple everyone, run away, keep using hit and run tactics, and let others deal with the cripple, he can win. Just focus on surviving at the utmost.<br><br>No it isn't just as simple as "Let Lancelot do all the work" like some people think, that would only be optimal to use him. However if he keeps up the hit and run tactics and crippling people, he will weaken them enough to be taken down. Just focus on survival.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disproven later volumes by Iskander. He was called Gil Arch Nemesis a volume after the 32 NPs statement. Shirou Saber also survived a number higher than 32.</br>  <br>You're the one interpreting it backwards.<br><br>"Quote is clear, Lancelot does everything" is entirely wrong<br><br>"It would be optimal to use them", is correct.<br><br>No it isn't just Lancelot, and yes you are the one reading it wrong. See here <br><br>No its not "Just Lancelot is all, he beats everyone", it doesn't even say he's necessary, Dair can do it alone, but its optimal to abuse this glitch. Not "Berserker is omnipotent against everyone, while Dair hides in the corner" like you say, Lancelot only has a chance with Dairmund crippling everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just a general stratagem. It doesn't literally mean Lancelot does all the work. It's not Deermud vs the other five and Lancelot vs the other five. It's everybody vs everybody. The other Servants aren't going to sit around doing nothing while all this happens.</br>  <br> If you're referring to Iskander's last valiant charge against Gilgamesh, he was mortally wounded by the time he reached Gilgamesh <br>No he wasn't, Iskander has no Battle Continuation. He was completely fine. Injured, but none of the hits managed to be fatal.<br><br> only a few of his shots went anywhere near Iskander to begin with. <br>Animefag.<br> With haughty growls, the rain of stars approached. Incessantly, mercilessly, the impacts trampled over their bodies <br><br><br>Literally only a boost in prana supply and nothing else, confirmed by the novel.<br> As long as he aspired toward the action of 'victory', Rider would receive an amplified amount of Prana support compared to normal.  <br><br> Remember that he failed to dodge Iskander's chariot. <br>Lancelot noticed too late to react because he was focused on Saber, stated in the novel.<br> Lancer quickly flipped backwards and avoided the chariot in time. But for Berserker, who kept all his attention of Saber, he didn’t even have time to turn around and register what was going on. <br><br>It really feels like Gilfags never read the novel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> By the way, in the Fourth Holy Grail War, the following strategy would insure the absolute victory of Team Lance <br>Needs to follow all the steps to win.<br><br> Lancelot only has a chance with Dairmund crippling everyone. <br>Lancelot is crippled too, all hostile teams. Not like Gil loses much by being crippled, his power is still at full force.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> The other Servants aren't going to sit around doing nothing while all this happens. <br>No they won't sit around, they will be getting wrecked by Lancelot.<br> Berserker destroy the other teams </br></br></br>  <br> The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. <br>Gilfags BTFO.</br></br>  <br>Read the words in the entry. "Optimally" Berserker helps their agenda by taking out other Servants. They cannot control Berserker or who he fights. All they can do is just not use Deermud's advantage over him until the end. And again, other Servants are going to be fighting eachother as well. Maybe Rider takes out Saber while Berserker hounds on Gil. Maybe Assassin kills Caster's master. It's all full of variables. The main thing is that in no reasonable way is Berserker going to manage to take out five Servants, wounded or not.</br>  <br>CCC and strange fake.</br>  <br>Because they lose due to plot convenience and LOLmongrel</br>  <br> Implying Strange Fake is serious Gil <br>Look at True Archer. He refused to go serious against someone who could fuck his entire life up.</br></br>  <br> there still not being a great OVA including Jeanne, Nero, Astolfo, and Sieg with Karna and Li Shuwen <br>Why so slow, Type Moon?</br></br>  <br> Not like Gil loses much by being crippled, his power is still at full force. <br><br>Having a gaping wound that never heals would slow you down a lot, mentally even.<br><br>He needs his mind to control his gates, yet each time it throbbed he would be distracted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Against Enkidu at least.</br>  <br>It was noted when he fought Enkidu that he went all out with everything he had, both his GoB and Ea all at the same time at full power. Text says if he gave anything less he would be dead in seconds.</br>  <br>He fought Enkidu seriously though in the desert.</br>  It's funny how Diarmuid can win the 4th HGW by doing massive hit and runs.  <br>Using Berserker is one of the steps, if he doesn't follow the steps, there is no win.<br><br> They cannot control Berserker or who he fights. <br>You require to defeat all the other Masters in order to win the War, so in a way, if they hide, they can make sure Lancelot doesn't go against them.<br><br> And again, other Servants are going to be fighting eachother as well. <br>Yet it's said that Lancelot would fuck up ALL THE OTHER TEAMS. No some of the others, ALL OF THEM.<br><br> in no reasonable way is Berserker going to manage to take out five Servants <br>Who said he was going to do it against everyone at the same time?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing? It only goes to prove even further that Uro is right, getting Gil to go serious is nigh impossible.</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty amazing that he could do that strategy on maybe 5 to 6 other Servants and get away with it.<br><br>Then again, he could probably defeat Iskander in his RM too.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes you gotta play like a scrub when you have a scrub servant.</br>  <br>CCC, and yes, being serious = being serious even if only for one opponent.</br>  <br>You're the one who can't read, it only says it would help if he used him, not that it was necessary.<br><br>It would make it a lot smoother, but they flat out say its only optimal rather than utmost a piece.</br></br></br>  <br>Diarmuid is a legendary army killer that wiped out thousands of men in a couple of hours iirc. He also has eye of the mind, man.</br>  <br> Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing? <br><br>It was something that occurred, it was confirmed he was serious in that moment, so yes whatever you're trying to say you sound full of it. He was entirely serious there.<br><br>Also CCC has the game goes on he starts getting pushed to his limits and forced to fight things that even his full power realistically cannot match, as he has to go a bit beyond and while admitting he's at his utmost.<br><br>Using Ea without hesitation upon being asked, type serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He still acts like a scrub.</br>  <br>Optimally, best case scenario, ideal outcome, most favorable situation, the most compatible series of events, ect. I.E., if things work out that way, that would best help their situation. What about that do you not comprehend?</br>  Why would anyone summon servants like Alexander the Great or Francis Drake or Nero who we KNOW thanks to the historical record are just ordinary humans and not legendary supermen unlike ancient mythological figures? You're basically summoning from that awful middle era when magic is degraded compared to ancient times but science has yet to advance to the combat potential of the modern day.  <br> Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing?  <br>Are you implying this fight didn't actually happen?</br></br>  <br> You're the one who can't read, it only says it would help if he used him, not that it was necessary. <br>Capitalize on Team Berserker, stop trying to argue something that is clear, it's a waste of time. He needs Lancelot, it's nowhere implied he can win without him. If he does it himself he might actually get killed by Assassin.<br><br> but they flat out say its only optimal rather than utmost a piece. <br>Not at all, they said he needs to follow the steps, step 4 is one of them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What about that do you not comprehend? <br>What about following all steps is necessary don't you understand?</br></br>  <br>Francis Drake has an ability that makes it so nothing is impossible for her if she seriously reaches for it. Her NP is one + away from the same rank as Excalibur, its A+ rank, the second highest imaginable in a way. Because her boat is an ultimate sort of legend that made it past the ultimate storm, made it into Avalon, and was piloted by Cain.<br><br>Nero has an ability that gives her any ability she wants, and rewrites the world so she's in charge entirely within a space. Not like a reality marble, but even greater.<br><br>Ishkandar is noted to be a top rank servant who can summon thousands of other servants, not just nameless people but servants. Anyone from any of his summonings that agrees to join him, is in the RM marble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The step is capitalize on Berserker. From that step, the most ideal outcome would be if Berserker soloed all of them. That's not going to happen, but it would be easy street if it did.</br>  <br><br><br>I only go serious when I see a pink Elephant, does that count as valid? Because that's exactly what happened in Strange Fake.<br><br> CCC <br>He started as an idiot too, needed power that he never had in order to do what he did.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's not going to happen <br>If it wasn't going to happen then the strategy wouldn't be an absolute victory strategy. All the steps are needed, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but reading the historical record wouldn't tell you that. None of their NPs or abilities are things that they actually had in life.</br>  <br>If you're claiming that you're never once serious, but go serious the one rare time some crazy guy steals and paints an elephant, you're wrong.<br><br>He becomes serious long before that. The second he allows Hakuno to use Ea as they please, he's serious. He just comes up against a hard wall later on.</br></br></br>  <br>Famous people become concepts upon death<br><br>You can say that Shakespeare couldn't break planets when he was alive or anything, but you can realize if you know how servants work at all "This guy is pretty famous, so he's bound to have some strange or interesting ability".<br><br>No matter what servant it is, if they made it into the throne then they have something going for them, some usage. Even if they weren't a warrior in life, in death they are a concept. You just have to realize what kind of concept it is by thinking about it backwards.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You claimed "Getting Gilgamesh to be serious is impossible!", Enkidu showed up, Gil fought seriously against Enkidu, it's possible.<br>Case closed.</br></br>  <br> If you're claiming that you're never once serious <br>I saw an Elephant painted in pink ink when I was a kid and I went serious that day. Never happened again though. The realistic chances of me being serious are around 0.00000000000000001, so it's safe to say serious me doesn't exist, even if there is still some chance of me being serious.<br><br><br> The second he allows Hakuno to use Ea as they please, he's serious <br>Still started as a retard, he only found another pink Elephant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You claimed <br>I didn't, Uro did, are you claiming you know more than Uro about the Fate Universe?</br></br>   talking about shit like this <br>Why not just have a contest about which Saber enjoys the BBC instead? That's probably more productive and might spur an anon to draw Saber having sex with a lot of them.</br>  Enkidu and Gilgamesh had a serious fight?  <br>You freely admit serious Gil exists. The rate of occurrence does not matter. The three times he has been fully serious out of a billion possible chances still means he has been serious three times. You can freely claim he is very rarely, close to never, serious, but serious Gil exists.</br>  <br> Uro : The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. But, if that were to ever happen and he was fighting Saber. No one would win. Nasu said so. <br>Even Uro accepted it could happen, but realistically speaking, it just wouldn't.</br></br>  <br>I'm not claiming to know more about the Nasuverse than Uro (Hell, he isn't even Nasu so what does it matter) but that quote of his has been completely contradicted by later works such as CCC and Strange fake.</br>  <br>Fate/Strange fake is a thing now,anon.</br>  <br>EMIYA can still defeat serious Gilgamesh.</br>  <br>Not contradicted at all, Uro said "even if that were to happen". There is still a chance, but that chance is so small that it's safe to say it doesn't. It's like when someone tells you have 99.9% of being someone's father, there is still the 0.1%.</br>  Hercules &gt; EMIYA &gt; Gilgamesh &gt; Hercules<br><br>Nice Pokemon game, Nasu!</br></br>  <br>Moving the goal posts from the start <br><br>Original comment this started with <br><br> &gt;The problem is that a serious Gilgamesh doesn't exist. <br> Gilfags BTFO. <br><br>then it moved to <br><br> Do you people seriously think a fight against Enkidu counts as seriously existing? <br><br>Almost an hour later you finally admit it but still act like you were in the right from the start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You could almost say its  Rock, Paper, Scissors </br>  <br>Completely serious Gil, no. He wouldn't have time to get out UBW. Even if he did use UBW, Gil would already have Ea out, because serious Gil is Ea and Enkidu at the ready.</br>  <br>Saber was summoned at least three times before hand wasn't she?</br>  <br>Read the comment that the "original comment" replied to.<br><br>Almost an hour later you finally admit it but still act like you were in the right from the start.<br> counts as seriously existing? <br>I was right from the start, counting a fight against Enkidu as realistically existing is laughable, but completely expected from Gilfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not rock, paper, scizors <br>You had one job</br></br>  <br>If something exists, it exists. Just because winning the lottery is a pipe dream does not mean it's unrealistic to say buying a lottery ticket gives you a chance to win.</br>    <br><br><br>No. Even in CCC, Gilgamesh won that fight.</br></br></br>  <br>Its confirmed in CCC, that no he cannot<br><br>Natural enemy: None<br><br>Even when people didn't meet in the game or otherwise, natural enemies are still listed normally. Yet they went out of their way even with Emiya appearing here twice that he's not his weakness if Gil is serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To clarify <br><br>Zero: Natural enemy : None<br>CCC: Natural enemy: None<br>F/SN: Natural enemy: EMIYA<br><br>Notice something different? In F/SN Gilgamesh's condition was different, he was incarnated, he was corrupted, he was more arrogant than other versions of himself. He was at his utmost foolishness.<br><br>He had to be gimped a bit for it to work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does Fate/stay night have the most interesting Servants?  <br> this dude and his cheathax mode of attack </br>  <br>Isn't that also the excuse for his ultra-villainous plan in UBW? That he was corrupted by the Grail even if just a bit?</br>  <br>So it exists and you're full of shit.</br>  <br> corrupted by the Grail <br>More like corrupted by just living on modern earth.</br></br>  <br>People keep saying this, but he wasn't corrupted by the grail.<br><br>He was corrupted by him being incarnated. CCC goes into how that works exactly, but its an Alaya thing.<br><br>When he became human, his ideals and methods lined up more with humans of that era in a way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not contradicted at all, Uro said "even if that were to happen". There is still a chance, but that chance is so small that it's safe to say it doesn't. It's like when someone tells you have 99.9% of being someone's father, there is still the 0.1%.</br></br>  <br> Vergil literally has the Muramasa blade a weapon that can counter abilities like God hand hard. <br> Vergil also has summoned Swords that can counter GoB <br> Vergil has Yamato a blade that can cut through anything even a full Enuma Elish/Excaliblast into pieces. <br> Vergil has Devil Trigger that can boost his powers a hundred fold <br> Beowulf flash gauntlets and greaves that can boost his melee 10 fold <br> But, the most important thing is that Vergil has the bigger dick <br>Reminder that if Vergil is summoned as a Saber he would be the most overpowered fuck in Nasuverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to anon, Enkidu is an imaginary pink elephant and Fate/Strange fake is nothing more than one of Gil's fever dreams.</br>  <br>Which has nothing to do with the original thread of discussion or the divergent thread of discussion. If you had claimed Gil is almost never serious and can only get serious in very specific situations, this wouldn't be a discussion. Just say you were wrong.</br>  Why is Enkidu a pink elephant?  <br>He's not</br>  <br>Because anon says so.<br>He's Gil's imaginary pink elephant friend.</br></br>  <br>Because Uro implied serious Gil existing being nigh impossible. Just like a Pink Elephant.</br>  <br>He could be one if he wanted. Check your cis-neurtral-colored-elephant privilege.</br>  <br>No anon, serious Gil isn't the pink elephant. Enkidu is the pink elephant. Get your own facts straight.</br>  <br>It actually has a lot to do, your failure at reading or understanding an argument here is not my problem. Check every single one of my answers, I was never denying the chance of it existing, same with Uro, only that the chances of it happening are almost non existant, therefore it's safe to say it realistically doesn't. Just say you were wrong.</br>  So CCC is pretty much "Gil goes to the moon to kill more wormsluts"?   mfw this thread  <br> I want to touch this pink elephant. </br>  <br>Some guy doesn't accept that serious Gilgamesh has happened, wants to say BTFO GILSUCKERS but when he's corrected doubles down on it and says him getting serious towards Enkidu doesn't count as him getting serious because its too rare to count, so serious Gilgamesh still doesn't exist.<br><br>CCC also isn't allowed to count, because Urobutchi for some reason, and you don't know more about TM than Urobutchi do you? Course not, so it doesn't count. Serious Gilgamesh therefore cannot exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't have pink elekidu because he only exists in Gil's imagination.</br>  Prism spoilers have been out since earlier today<br><br>Shirou and Miyu taken in by Kiritsugu, Kiritsugu says he plans to "use" Miyu to save the world, as the holy grail.<br><br>Shirou is now at odds with his foster father, and must protect his real family. It was something like that anyway.</br></br></br></br>  I want to see a super-route in which Gil doesn't job instantly to THE SHADOW and either "joins" with Dark Sakura or decides to help Shirou against the Zouken ambitions.    <br>I've always assumed MoS was a route where Kirei gives Shirou Gil as a servant. It's the tidiest way to fulfill the assumption that Shirou wins the war.</br>  What will you do, Shirou  <br>I noticed that gilfags tend to deny how powerful Enkidu really is and those who oppose gilfags tend to disregard a serious Gil fighting a serious Enkidu.<br>It's a hard life being a pink elephant.</br></br>  <br>So this Shirou never picked up Kerry's ideal in the first place?</br>  <br>Foolish assumption in several ways, but I've talked about that shit way too much already.</br>  <br>do you have any idea how much money and effort was needed to find the right relic to summon him?<br><br>plus once you do your totally at his fucking mercy except for 3 instances, and you fucking know if you abuse those instances he will literally kill himself or you before he helps you win</br></br></br>  <br>Its harder to pick up the ideal in a worldline where that statement goes hand in hand with "I'm going to kill your sister".</br>  <br>Okay? I mean it seems like it would fit. Kirei gave Shinji Gil in UBW, and I can't think of any other way for Shirou to properly win the war.<br><br>I mean I'm not like, super attached to the theory, but it makes enough sense to me.</br></br></br>  <br>Its 4th war edgelord Kerry, not the Kerry Shirou remembered as fondly it seems. He believed in Kiritsugu because he saw his passion, seeing him on that porch talking about saving everyone, but now he just sees the warped aspect.</br>  <br>Yeah, I just find it interesting. People have said this Shirou went HF, but it looks like there might not have even been a conflict with ideals in the first place.<br><br>It makes for a very different Shirou, if you think about it.</br></br></br>  Better fucking question, is there any being in history who could beat Lancelot if he was summoned as a Saber class?  <br>There are no power levels in the nasuverse, only plot.<br><br>With suitable skills and planning, literally anyone can beat anyone else.</br></br></br>  <br>Lancer, obviously.</br>  <br>Max power Gil, Hercules as Saber or Archer, EMIYA stands a chance, Gawain as Saber during the day, and Arcueid.</br>  <br>Karna,Enkidu, Achilles, literally anyone who isn't low-tier and willing to kick his ass.</br>  <br>He reached the same meaning as HF, "I'll save this person even above the world, I'll save the person I love, this person that is family. Even if the entire world may condemn me for my actions I want to save her"<br><br>It doesn't have to line up entirely, it doesn't have to be "Ideals breaking" to be HF. I don't think any of us meant it being like HF Shirou in the sense that we're saying "he had to have broken ideals".<br><br>That was basically a non point from the start; its more about what he's saying and where his justice lies, rather than "His justice died".<br><br>HF isn't "My ideals died", HF is "I'll protect those close to me, even if its a risk I want to save them specifically because I love them".<br><br>Its like whatever this cap apparently says</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only plot armor  <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>Except Types. They are Ultimate.</br>  <br>Without the stat boost as Berserker, his stats as Saber would be <br><br>B STR<br>B END<br>B+ AGI<br>C MANA<br>B LCK<br><br>Urobutchi straight says he only could block as much from GoB because of the stat boost.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then pit the Types against each other and place your bets.</br>  <br>In Fate/EXTRA, he's explicitly not allowed to be summoned. The reason Hakuno's able to forge a contract with him is because CCC takes place in the Far Side, which is like the Moon Cell's recycle bin.</br>  <br> literally anyone who isn't low-tier and willing to kick his ass. <br><br>Lot of people disregarded as low tier could easily beat him depending on the situation, its kind of an entire point in F/SN.<br><br>Lancelot never even had a chance against Gilles summoned beast.<br><br>Yet you'd likely say he's low tier</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will Nasu make a story about the Types, Primate Murder, and the other cool shit in the universe actually doing something?  <br><br>Didn't Lancelot already beat Gawain during the day?</br></br>  <br>He may have an excaliblast type of attack too since he would be summoned before his holy sword is corrupted and not a vengeful spirit.</br>  <br>Lancelot bushwhacked best knight at sunset.</br>  <br>Never because there will never be enough Fate to satisfy Takeuchi's Saber lust.</br>  <br>I guess, though it's a very different path to reach this point.<br><br>It makes me wonder if the Prisma Shirou will ever be expanded on. From what little we know about him he's still interested in heroes, which might be a complete disconnect from the Miyu one entirely.</br></br></br>  <br>why post his nude pic op, are you a gay faggot? kill yourself.</br>  <br>Okay so both high-tier and low-tier servants stand a chance against him if they're willing enough to kick his ass.</br>   yfw we will never see Bedivere as Caster who's wish from the grail would be for Arthur to live the life she never could   <br>He stalled him during the day and defeated him at the night.</br>  <br> No one would win <br><br>What? But wouldn't a serious Gil demolish Saber?</br></br></br>  <br>Prism Shirou got to know the good Kiritsugu, while Miyu Shirou was immediately put against the world as he had to protect his sister from them.</br>  <br>Its stated that Gawain is stronger than him, but Lancelot is more skilled. Lancelot played evasive to him during the day and waited until his buff wore out to finally strike him.</br>  <br>Because its not a scenario that Takeuchi could write, therefore no one would win since it couldn't happen.</br>  <br>Is Takeuchi having a hissyfit?<br> No <br>Seiba gets wrecked<br> Yes <br>Serious Gil gets wrecked</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takeuchi writes?</br>  <br>Only the Saber scenes</br>  <br>He wrote all the porn scenes<br><br>true fact</br></br></br>  <br>Is that why Saber had the only good ones in FSN?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>She just camps in Avalon until he gets bored and walks away.</br>  <br>But can they defeat Madara Uchiha?</br>  Why aren't you Chibichuki yet?  <br>Hnnng</br>    <br>Ah, why is seiba so cute?</br>    <br> Gil <br> Unbeatable <br><br>Saber's second H-scene was great.

Similar in the sense you might say that no matter how an event unfolds, certain things must unfold.<br><br>Meaning that even if it happens in a different way, it still must line up with a certain fact.<br><br>Shirou's parents dying you can say is part of the attractor field, its an event that's solidified in time as "for sure happening", no matter how it must happen.<br><br>He doesn't seem so broken though, it might not have been a fire or anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beast's Lair mainly.</br>  A chapter all about school lunches  <br>The stuff we know about him is that he still does the high jump, and he's still interested in heroes, so Kerry must have instilled something in him.<br><br>For all we know he could still be doing his magical training an no one's noticed.

Here's the spoilers at least.<br><br>http://bosel.blog64.fc2.com/blog-en<wbr>try-3789.html<br><br>http://atelier10colors.blog.fc2.com<wbr>/blog-entry-163.html</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>              Did someone mention School Clubs?  <br>Oh! Doesn't Nero start an idol club? That should be funny.</br>    <br>No, the 4th and 5th war are her only ones, along with the timeloop thing in hollow ataraxia, but that's not really a grail war.</br>  <br>Not for another few chapters</br>    Enkidu 1v1d Gil to the point of it being a draw, with Gil's treasury being emptied and Enkidu no longer being able to fight, does that mean Enkidu has some way to cancel out Ea?  <br>Yes, Enkidu pulls out his own version of Ea when they fight in Fate/Strange.<br><br>It works very differently however<br><br>It pulls the power from the counter force and Gaia, as both of them give Enkidu as much power as he wants based on how much of a threat they consider whatever he's fighting.<br><br>Then Enkidu uses his own body as a gun to shoot that energy outward without limit. It turns the planet itself into a weapon, which even Gilgamesh cannot overcome. Also his Ea is backwards, it doesn't destroy the world, it creates the world.<br><br>Enkidu can also become all other weapons in creation, while also using his version of Ea.<br><br>He's the most overpowered servant to date in a sense, right next to Gilgamesh.<br><br>Stats are all A's, but he can redistribute his stats at will, and transform into anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At worst he'd either dissect Shirou himself or call the magic cops to place a sealing order on him, because Tokiomi is the standard magus and that's what they do. When you find a heretic you report it, as even Rin mentions. <br><br>Are you sure about that? Kiritsugu was every bit as heretical as Shero and he worked with the association for a number of years as a mercenary. They didn't exactly tell him to fuck off or try to handcuff him just because he was a heretic.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Enkidu has his own 'Enuma Elish' with calls out Gaia for magical energy. We know it can at least cancel out Ea to a degree.</br>  <br>Enkidu's abilities were introduced in CCC, but you finally see them in action in Fate/Strange.<br><br>Scroll down on this page and read the fight if you want.<br><br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/378-Fate-strange-fake/page125<wbr><br><br><br>Not really heretical<br><br>That time stop thing he does isn't any real mystery to them, since the Magus Assosiation are the ones that gave that part to Kerry or something, after they had taken the majority of the crest for themselves.<br><br>or they wanted it at least<br><br>Kerry isn't that big of a heretic, not in the same way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Are you sure about that? <br><br>Its said enough times, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Lance look so emo?</br>    <br>He sounds exactly like a true ancestor but better.</br>    Golden Rule<br><br>Money just falls into Gilgamesh's lap without trying<br><br>Thus he ends up creating a business that runs on Fujoshi dollars by chance.</br></br></br></br>  Meanwhile with Team Caster  <br>Man I really need to start reading strange fake, it sounds fun</br>  <br> &gt;/ff.net/ </br>  <br>Maybe half the servants can give Gilgamesh a run for his money. Its an entirely heretical war, of things that shouldn't be summoned.<br><br>Summoned the incarnation of all disease, Pale Rider of Revelations as Rider this time around.<br><br>Even Enkidu runs the fuck away when he feels it coming.</br></br></br></br></br>  Rider is described in a way that's a bit beyond most servants so far though perhaps.<br><br>I don't anyone really wants to deal with that quite yet. Even with half the town falling into comas because of it. Its hard to tell if you can even fight it.</br></br>  <br>It's definitely the most entertaining grail war to date. There hasn't really been a moment you could call "boring".</br>  Big talk recently though is True Rider and True Archer.    <br> Touko made team cool a swimsuit saber figure. </br>    <br>Being a heretic is different from having a sealing designation. Being a heretic means you deviate from the ways of the magi. A sealing designation is given to magi the association thinks are so valuable they need to be put in a magical petri dish and studied studied and can't be allowed to roam free. Even prominent magi can receive sealing designations if the association as a whole wants them enough. <br><br>UBW might be enough to give Shirou a sealing designation but that's because it's very unique, not because he's a heretic.</br></br></br>  <br>I want that figure</br>  <br>Most of the second volume isn't translated yet. But I really like where it's going. The servants seem interesting too (Richard Lionheart, Four Horsmen of the Apocalypse, Enkidu, two Hassan's). <br><br>For example, it looks like Richard Lionheart as a Saber can detect who the Hassan's are due to dealing with them in life. And there's clues that Enkidu will lose to the Pale Rider due to Pale Rider representing pestilence and disease (which Enkidu died to thanks to the Gods). And of course the servants we don't know yet who blew off GoB spam like it was nothing.</br></br></br>  <br>Are Enkidu and Richard officially allies or has Enkidu not accepted the proposal yet? I think that was the last thing covered in vol.2 but I'm not certain.</br>  <br>He seems to have just asked on the last page, as a cliffhanger.</br>      <br>How many old men did she fuck for that money?</br>    <br>Oh gee, I wonder how she got that money?</br>  <br>u forget that arondigth ranks up most of his stats by one rank so it would be exactly the same as his berserker stats. Only a master with a huge amount of mana like illya could bring out berserker lancelot's full potential.</br>  <br>I doubt Enkidu is going to die in battle against pale rider. He's one of Narita's favorites and the character most of the nips seems to be reading it for along with Gil and Flat. <br><br><br>Shit, he better say yes. I really need this Ayaka/Richard/Enkidu trio.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Did Rin fuck Nasu for money?</br>    <br>Never said he'd die to it. It's a clear weakness though.</br>  <br>Mushrooms do resemble dicks<br><br>True fact</br></br></br>  <br>Definitely. That boy really needs to steer clear of ebola incarnate. Luckily, he's been doing exactly that.</br>  <br>My favorite single page from this manga.</br>          You'd think mages would be all over fucking Uruk stealing bricks and shit, since he was known primarily for building the walls of Uruk, and mudbrick lasts a really long time.    <br>Cu's like Gilgamesh, a character was created that's so powerful, they have to brought down and shit on by poor writing/plot convenience. Gilgamesh gets his massively inflated ego and a hard counter in the form of UBW, while Cu gets probably the best master possible, especially for him stolen away the moment he's summoned, and is instead given to the incompetent Kirei who has no intention of even trying to use Cu to full effectiveness.</br>  <br>You could say the same about most servants in a way.</br>  <br>I think all of the people back in Uruk were low-key mages since Alaya was more concentrated then ever before. They were compared to low tier gods.</br>    <br>Oh boy this part.</br>    <br>They are all Heroic Spirits though, it's just that they're nothing compared to real Servants.<br>He's right, they wouldn't be as easy to kill as a normal army, but nor would each individual one be a real threat to Cu. You're both forgetting that Cu has an anti-army noble phantasm on hand, so even if he can't just charge in and kill them all hand-to-hand, he can still wipe them off the face of the earth with precision the likes of which you've never seen before, faggot.<br>It's either that, or keep running and avoid conflict with the army while in the RM, or just hit Iskander with GB anyway for the insta-kill.<br>Cu has so many ways of hardcountering Zero-Rider it's ridiculous.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You're both forgetting that Cu has an anti-army noble phantasm on hand, so even if he can't just charge in and kill them all hand-to-hand, he can still wipe them off the face of the earth with precision the likes of which you've never seen before, faggot. <br><br>Its range is 50 units<br><br>The army is a few thousand strong, they aren't going to be BTFO and retreating from that much at all.<br><br>Cu can spam the thrust version of his spear, but not the thrown version.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber's like the antithesis to that though, a servant said to be the strongest who just ends up jobbing. If it weren't for Avalon or Caladbolg(lol 6 lives at once), Saber would easily be among the shittiest servants in the nasuverse.</br>        Chapter about the Chuki kids        <br>I was wondering where Illya was.</br>    <br>She's the shittiest because she's stuck with one out of her many potential NPs. She has Excalibur, which is very powerful however it has an enormous cost to her/her master's mana. Avalon is her greatest NP, it's something that marks her as being one of the best, and she never has access to it except for one fight.<br><br>She's kind of like Gil, Herc, or Cu in a sense, a strong character who has to job for the plot to keep going. Stay night would have been boring if every fight was her winning.</br></br></br>    <br> EMIYA stands a chance </br>    <br>Guess why we got a Ufotable UBW anime.</br>    <br>She should have kept fucking him, maybe she would have gotten a nose in it if she did.</br>  <br> Lancelot never even had a chance against Gilles summoned beast. <br>Depends on the weaponry he can get his hands on. If the Grail is on MURRICA like Strange Fake and he gets an Atomic Bomb then Gilles ded.</br></br>        <br>So he loses instantly to fucking Medusa, and is still liable to getting Gae Bolg'd. GoB'd, IH'd, Cthulhu'd, and TG'd.</br>  <br> Karna,Enkidu, Achilles, literally anyone who isn't low-tier and willing to kick his ass. <br>Depends on the prep time. Saber Lancelot has access to unlimited FSG spam which allows him to assassinate almost everyone.</br></br>      <br> Without the stat boost as Berserker, his stats as Saber would be <br>Kariya is stated to nerf him, his actual stats should be around the same he had as a Berserker. Berserker was only used to amend for the initial nerf, also stated in the novel.<br><br> Urobutchi straight says he only could block as much from GoB because of the stat boost. <br>Wouldn't do as good =/= could only block as much.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You made me laugh, you glorious basrard.</br>    <br>Wait does Aoko dig Lugh or Enkidu? Or is she just a fujoshit like Jinako?</br>  <br>1 vs 1 Rune and Iskander is fucked.</br>  <br>Oh boy, JETfags have entered.<br><br>Abandon thread. I'll see you all in the next topic about wormslut vs. normalslut</br></br></br>  <br>Mainly fujo</br>      <br> Isn’t it obvious? Kariya, you should know that as a magus, your abilities are not just one or two notches below the other Masters. It will affect the basic abilities of the Servant. <br> If that’s the case, it can only be amended through the Servant’s Class, and we must raise the parameter from the root up. </br></br>        <br> So he loses instantly to fucking Medusa <br>Arondight doubled Saving Throws<br><br> Gae Bolg'd <br>Base is B and then add PotF. Arondight makes it almost impossible to work with a boost to Luck and then doubled Saving Throws.<br><br> GoB'd <br>Arondight.<br><br> IH'd <br> Cthulhu'd <br>Highly dependant on the strategy used, Lancelot could FSG into Jeanne or one of Iskander bros then kill both. Or he could get his hand on weaponry powerful enough to BTFO both.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Enkidu even go to school or is he just some random forest child?<br><br><br>Nero's still wearing those little shoulder pad things (The proper name for them escapes me at the moment) how cute.</br></br></br></br>    Has Roa made a chibichuki cameo yet?  <br>Yes, he was in the library with Nero, when Archer was teaching the Hakunos.</br>  <br>Epaulettes, they're called epaulettes.</br>          <br>Thanks.</br>  Are you ready for Shirou to project Caliburn and school Kirei in the HF movie?  <br> project Caliburn <br><br>How many people would be pissed if they went Normal End?</br></br></br>  <br>Johnny Joestar with Tusk Act 4</br>  <br>That would be fucking hilarious.</br>  <br>You should check Iskander luck rank anon...</br>  <br> Her HA scene was fucking great too. <br>It was maximum LEWD too.<br><br><br> Gilgamesh <br> unbeatable  <br> demi-God <br>G8 B8 M8 8/88</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Avalon isn't really putting up a shield to block an attack like rho aias is, it's more like moving you to another place in the world to completely avoid the attack entirely.<br><br>It's noted to be completely unreachable, by true magic, by Ea, saber is cut off from everything<br><br><br> demi-god <br> a being with partial or lesser divine status, such as a minor deity, the offspring of a god and a mortal <br>Gilgamesh is a demi god<br>Cu Chulainn is a demi god<br>Hercules is a demi god</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  We need to update this chart.  <br> Waiting for Extra CCC translation <br> Rider Route where <br> Caster route where <br> RUNES <br> JETS </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much everyone, since that's literally asking for less content and less of a resolution<br><br>However its already confrimed to be true ending from Nasu's online diary.<br><br>He was a bit miffed that Last Stardust was used in UBW, when it was supposed to be reserved for a certain moment in Cherry Blossom's good ending.</br></br></br></br></br>  -Is under your bed-  <br> He was a bit miffed that Last Stardust was used in UBW, when it was supposed to be reserved for a certain moment in Cherry Blossom's good ending. <br><br>That was a mistranslation.

Cause that's where the initial misconception lied.<br><br><br>When Shirou does xxxxx, the background music is by Aimer, who also did the opening theme “Brave Shine.”<br>The name of that song is “LAST STARDUST.”<br>Actually, both of these songs were submitted by Aimer as candidates for the opening theme of UBW’s second season.<br>They’re both great songs that elevate the themes of UBW, so frankly, we were writhing with indecision over which one to use.<br>As a result, we strategized that the opening needed a feeling of speed, so we went with “Brave Shine.”<br>As a theme song, “LAST STARDUST” was outstanding in my mind.<br><br><br>“Unfortunately, it breaks our hearts to have to pick only one… but we’d be happy to see “LAST STARDUST” used in Sakura’s route, so plan for that, please!”<br><br><br>Is what we insisted to Aimer.<br>Three months later, somehow a recording of “LAST STARDUST” that was more polished than the demo version reached my ears.<br><br><br>Nasu: “How!? No, I’m incredibly happy though! I’m not exaggerating when I say that I can taste UBW just by hearing this! But why did they spend so much time making it!?”<br>Director Miura: “Ah, about that. I requested it as a background song because I really wanted to attach it to episode 20. But, we didn’t know if it would go well, so we didn’t tell you until it did. Tee-hee.”<br>Nasu: “Dammit man, you kept quiet about something this important—<br>Don’t mind me, just keep doing this——!”<br><br><br>And so we got the best possible result.<br><br>He wasn't miffed at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miffed might be an exaggeration, when it was more comically miffed.<br><br>You should understand well enough what I mean from his words.<br><br> “Unfortunately, it breaks our hearts to have to pick only one… but we’d be happy to see “LAST STARDUST” used in Sakura’s route, so plan for that, please!” <br> Nasu: “How!?

Brave Shine was picked as the OP for UBW, and he though Last Stardust would work maybe for HF down the line.<br><br>Miura wanted both for UBW, and Nasu ended up pleased with the results.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128509443 <br>What the fuck.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128509443 <br>Sounds interesting, i'm in.</br>  <br>my dick</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128509443 <br>is it erotic rp?</br>  Which servants play video games?  <br>Iskandar. Does Shirou play video games? I guess he would count if that's the case.</br>  <br>I remember him mentioning having a computer or two in the storehouse. Maybe that's what he's doing in that building late at night.</br>  I'm surprised there isn't a heroic spirit for Jason yet. You'd think the leader of the Argonauts would have been done by now  <br>Well, he was already mentioned by Nasu as sort of a dickhead when talking about Caster's past in F/HA, so I don't know if he'd want to do that.</br>  <br>Saiba x Shiru 4eva</br>  <br> Pleases old men for gems <br> Bone of my Sword <br> Tsukihime &gt; Fate <br><br>I guess would be a start</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Something about Prisma Illya</br>  You know what I like about Nero in Chibichuki?

His legend is full of him being an asshole to others because he wants to fight them, learn to fight with them, or fuck them.

It's partially her fault, more or less in some cases.</br></br>  <br>What's the context behind what was said?</br>  If Shirou can't beat any Servant that had mastered a weapon, and Shirou could beat both Saber and Berserker, does that mean Saber had not mastered any weapon?  <br> What was said <br>I'm referring to what's being said in the pic.</br></br>  <br>It's talking about Shirou's boss, Neko, and her real name of Otoko. I'm guess that "3-chome" was meant to be read as "San-XXX" like San Francisco or San Diego, etc.</br>  <br>Shirou's just being typically Japanese and humble as fuck.</br>  <br>Shirou could only beat Saber because he was using Archer's powers, not necessarily his own. Also, he had Rider as backup.</br>  <br>If Shirou cannot beat any Servant that has mastered a weapon, and Archer is Shirou, does that mean Archer can't beat any Servant that has mastered a weapon?</br>  <br>Archer can beat servants.<br><br>Nasu says Shirou (at least anime Shirou) will go on to surpass Archer.<br><br>So Shirou will be able to beat servants better than Archer can beat servants.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But can he beat Shiki?</br>  <br><br> need a 5000 year old snake skin to summon him <br><br>the possibility and requirements of summoning Gil are high enough to balance him.<br><br>its like winning the lottery</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Shirou said he can't beat any Servant that has mastered a weapon. Did Shirou lie?</br>  <br>Shirou is stupid. He can't help it.</br>  <br>That statement didn't make sense. UBW should work decently in principle. In a practical sense, it should work out decently so long as he has mana to keep it going. Don't see why he would categorically be disadvantaged against people who'd specialized in a particular weapon.</br>  <br> what is exaggeration <br> what is writing <br>Urobuchi said Saber can't evade Lancer's death blow. FACT<br>Urobuchi said no one can evade blob-chan.<br>etc</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saber Alter was not fighting to her full capabilities. It became a pure battle of skills.<br><br>And when it's a battle of skills, having the ability of foresight while your opponent has degraded Luck, Intuition, and Agility while taking it easy on you, then you have a chance of winning.<br><br>That said, she regens after the fight and gets Rin raped by Sakura later, so that's not in any way a definition of winning. Also, Servant arm on body.<br><br>Berserker was dying, blind, lost his skin. And still Berserker would have won had Ilya not interfered at the last moment.<br><br>Do you shitheads even read the fucking VN?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which Lancer?</br>   Do you shitheads even read the fucking VN? <br>This is /a/</br>  <br>Unfortunately, riffraff have started frequenting /a/. We can't assume everyone has done the smart thing anymore.</br>  <br>This lottery sucks.</br>  <br>So if it was a fair fight where both combatants fought at the very best of their respective abilities, Shirou would still lose against any and all that had mastered a weapon?</br>  <br>He still gets raped like a bitch in every scenarios of FSN. Berserker too should have no reason to be beaten.</br>  <br> 182cm <br>AHHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHA<br><br>What a manlet</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you READ the VN, there was never a fair fight in it where the Servants fought to their best, or, were in their best forms.<br><br>Even Kotomine was a half-dead fucker using his remaining energy to keep himself alive because he had no heart. And the only reason he lost was because he was beating the living shit out of swords that was damaging him with every punch he successfully threw.</br></br></br>  <br>but that's 5'11"</br>  <br>So if it was a fair fight where both combatants fought at the very best of their respective abilities, Shirou would still lose against any and all that had mastered a weapon?</br>  <br>JESUS LANCER!!!! Goddamit i want to summon jeusus as lancer and win the holy grail war with him as the greatest servant and demigods ever!!! BRING ME JESUS LANCER!!!!</br>  <br>Not that guy, but there are a lot of variables.

Requesting a drawfriend try to give a Bankai for Senna please. Usually with Shikai the sword changes in appearance but some don't. And with Bankai the sword could change again or not all all, the user could get a costume change or not, and the power is sometimes the same as the Shikai but may be different but keeping the same concept (I.E Making ice to making more and stronger ice, having a small 2HK weapon to a massive 1HK missile, or freezing opponents to controlling temperature and freezing yourself to absolute zero and being able to move.) They also get a newish name (Zangetsu - Tesna Zangetsu, Sode no Shirayuki - Hakka no Togame, Ryujin Jakka - Zanka no Tachi) but naming Mirokumaru for Bankai isn't necessary.<br><br>Examples of Shikai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=km4<wbr>R8J_CqoU</wbr>  [ ] Senna's is at 8:30<br>Examples of Bankai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4IU<wbr>khdqLeso</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But anything else is welcomed. <br><br> If the drawfriend who said that he'd draw her on a Ferris wheel in the sunset and woudl deliver in a couple of months is here, has it been dropped? Or is it still in the works? Is it possible to see a wip of any kind? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you need to take a step back, re evaluate your priorities and your life if free drawings on a shitty imageboard make you so mad. If drawfags don't do my request then that's cool; maybe next time eh? Not worth losing my cool over.</br>  Requesting my Wanko wearing your waifus clothing, anything else is appreciated.  <br>We worked on it during the week and it's not your specific request so feel free to rerequest.<br>Collages don't count anyway.</br></br>  <br>You're so mature and cool, senpai. One day I hope to be as cool and mature as you.<br><br>Everyone here can enjoy your five minute sketches this weekend, that's the best you can expect.</br></br></br>  <br>Now I know what I must  intend to draw  this weekend.</br>  <br>Fuck off. You should have just delivered this in your stream circlejerk, the faggot is LITERALLY RIGHT THERE, you're talkig to him right now.</br>  <br> 4ft demon in a 4ft giant water balloon </br>  Good morning everyone, hope you all are well. Requesting my dear sweet Gwendoyln please, her smiling face would be enough for me but if you want something specific, I wouldn't mind seeing her sitting comfy in Alice's big red chair and reading or dusting off the Valkyrie book. <br><br>Just remember to take it easy and relax. Let's all have a good weekend.</br></br>  <br> Collages don't count anyway. <br> a collage consisting entirely of images of one character <br><br>Nice.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Tooru with happy look.  Reminder that it's okay to shitpost if you're in the cool kids club.  Could someone draw Nemu for me? Anything would be fine but please for treat her poorly.  I -really- want to ask for my waifu, but she's a  game character  too, how many people would explode if I did so?  <br>go ahead and do it, only autists give a shit</br>  Please report and ignore people trying to derail the thread.  <br>Screw it, thanks for the encouragement.</br>  <br>Why not pull an Ishida and be nice? Also I'm sure enough your request is supposed to be in the general thread.</br>  <br>Look around. There are a lot of /v/ here. Though I believe this is what /v/ drawthreads were for, literally no one gives a fuck. Just request.</br>  <br>Please remember this reminder that you will probably never wash the taste of dick out of your mouth, you tool.</br>  <br>It's probably just one really fat anon who spends all his time to write all the rage postings, don't worry about him.</br>  Requesting Shion wearing glasses and frilly lingerie<br>Anything cute of her is fine <br>Thanks in advance</br></br>  <br> new IP <br><br>which stream friend are you? are you a qt?</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that this won't stop you from getting a delivery and you're an idiot if you think otherwise</br>  <br>reminder that if you get angry you let the shitposting drawfags win. keep calm, ignore them, they live off the drama, and keep requesting.</br>  Birthday thread.
