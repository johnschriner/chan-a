HAHA THIS FAGGOT. TRY HAVING AN SAUCE AS YOUR DAD AND CUCKURA AS YOUR MOM    So, its all quiet on the spoiler front?    tfw Mitsuki took a bite of gum-gum    Why do you all believe that Boruto can use Chidori? It makes much more sense that the is using Rasengan with Raiton.    Orochimaru does that stretching thing all the time why does no one make luffy jokes about him.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127119800     but [Sarada/Himawari/Naruto/Hinata/Shik<wbr>adai] should definitely beat up that whiny faggot.</wbr>     No wonder no one replied to that. Naruto is not in the title and there isn't a naruto picture.    Because he only stretch his neck and puke himself all the time    0:28  Konohamaru confirmed being Sarada-Mitsuki-Boruto sensei      Because in the trailer when lightning appears around his hand the typical sound of chidori is heard.  There are many raiton jutsus and none sound like chidori, so that's why it seems boruto will have both the rasengan and the chidori.      Don't forget the Uzumaki chains in case she turns out to be Karin's daughter.    And you can tell which one of these two threads the mods will delete.    How does Naruto's kid get snake shit and chidori?    Doesn't really look like either. He doesn't have a chakra ball in his hand and the lightning is all around him rather than lighting up his arm/hand. Maybe he threw a lightning rasengan ball?    Sasuke trained him.     - Chakra Chains   - Healing Bite  Karen is not her mother.       Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin  Ain't fucking happening. He may be a cheeky shithead, but he is not snake-user tier edgy. When she grows up Sarada could pull a neat snake lady act with that summoning contract, though.        It most likely his own technic - a combination of Sasuke's and Naruto's favorite moves.    Yes she is did you even read Gaiden?     Snake Summoning   Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin   Toad Summoning    Sage Mode   Super Strength   Great Medical skills   Chakra Chains   Healing Bite  I didn't see any of that shit in there            It looks nothing like a rasengan.    Does he not know that his father is an orphan?    I can't figure out why his eyes seem strange to me    That's dark history He's a sweet summer child     His eyes a lighter blue than Naruto's, probably due to Hyuuga genes.    Doesn't he know that his teammate grew up 12 years without her dad or that Shikadai is in the exact same situation as him?    It should easily be Salad Because she's Tsunade with Sharingan  It will be Burrito Because he dripped out his dad's penis.        Quote's wrong. He actually says:  "This parent shouldn't have been there from the beginning!"   He'd be a real class-A shithead if he threw Hinata under the bus like that. Threw her like he did his sister's cake.       It's the same color as Naruto's. They just look weird because of the actual decent animation.    Shikadai's mom isn't a doormat    asspull retarded explanation for misunderstanding is incoming     she a Tsunade  That didn't help Sakura much what make having a low level sharingan any different?     Because pic related sounds just like a Chidori and we see him add the Rasengan part later on in the movie.   I'm not sure if he throws it though. Could just be an animation thing.      Not like that bit of history pertains to him in any way. Telling someone that their parent was an orphan doesn't help at all. Trying to get a child to pity their parent is one of the worst things you can do.    She should definitely yell at him more. It's arousing.   And it looks like Himawari grew up, so the cake scene was likely a flashback.      I don't think it will be Rasenshuriken, if he learns lightning jutsus. He's more likely to make his own variant of Rasengan using lightning chakra. Something like Rasenbolt, which might be some sort of ball lightning.   fuck off   She is too much of a loser nerd.     She probably spanks the fuck out of him whenever he gives her lip, which is quite frequently if he's anything like his father.    <br/>   Okay, how about we talk about your waifu from SoL #39567?   But who is Mitsuki?  Everyone is giving Sarada MS, but how can she awaken it? She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma.    She needs someone to die in front of her so she experiences deep trauma  I nominate Bolt.     You wish.    It needs to be someone she CARES about.    Why does boruto got nothing of his mother ?  Shikadai=Temari eyes Chouchou=Karui skin Inoscrarecrow=Ino hair Himawari= Hinata hair Sarada=   Karin glasses            Fuck no, Cuckura should be the sacrifice    We're talking about each character at peak potential and the description reads that Salad would at least get Mangekyou Sharingan. That shit is hardly low level.  Also Peak Sakura still never surpassed Peak Tsunade unless she got significantly stronger between the war and plopping out a kid.       yfw Sarada turns out to be the first ever Uchiha to unlock her MS without maximum suffering and edge     One of her mothers... Or Sasuke after he's done training Boruto.   Don't like the setup. Seems like Kishimoto just wanted to mix the best of the best into one character. Especially dat kids attitude. Would be better off if that kid got tourette's syndrome and could use no jutsus at all.     Big bouncy tattas susanoo    BAKA DORITO!   How can this guy be so fucking whiny? Naruto is ALWAYS AROUND   oh no, it's a shadow clone thats playing hide and seek with me, MY LIFE IS SO TERRIBLE   Literally what the fuck Kishimoto probably doesn't even realize how entitled he's making Bort and actually thinks his problems are legitimate          Hinata is a shit tier Hyuuga whos genes are so shit she can't even pass down her goddamn Byakugan.  Master Eugenicist my ass. He should've gave Hanabi to Naruto.       you were slow this time   Holy shit apparently Sasuke went back to his "mission" after the Gaiden. So Sarada is father-less again till he returns to become Boruto's master.    asspull retarded explanation for misunderstanding is incoming  And missing out on the opportunity of giving Salad an easy powerup? Not a chance.      He should've gave Hanabi to Naruto.   Noone can handle that semen demon People have premature ejaculations the moment they'd look on her in bed       It's clear that Naruto "dies" so Boruto can learn what losing his dad actually is.     Peak Sakura still never surpassed Peak Tsunade  was said during the war that her Baykugo seal is stronger than Tsunade's       It's Kishi projecting his own fears onto his characters again. He worries that his kids might resent him for being a busy ass mangaka.   Really it's just teenage angst. And it all gets resolved in the end anyway so there's no need to worry.      Pretty sure it was just as strong.    Boruto and Himawari are the only known descendants of the Hyūga clan who do not possess the Byakugan. However, according to Masashi Kishimoto, he intended to give them the Byakugan, but forgot to before releasing chapter 700.  http://www.cinemacafe.net/article/2<wbr>014/12/06/27884.html</wbr>      More like he did not give a fuck seeing as he was joking that entire interview.    i swear you whiny faggots acts like you never said shit like that to your parents    He didn't intend. That would go against making Boruto Naruto and Sasuke's lovechild   So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.   Boruto movie coming out before the anime even gets to Madara vs Guy    That makes sense. It's not like his mission finished just because he got screentime again.     THE RIDE NEVER ENDS  How does it feel, knowing that you'll be still watching Naruto when you're 80.         he was joking that entire interview   pretty much this. the movies take about 2 years to make from first concept to release, so he has plenty of time to work shit into the manga to do whatever the fuck he likes, like asspull a byakugan brother for Sot6P which tipped his hand about NH ending being (even more) likely.  burrito/salad designs and their powers were probably pretty solid ca. chapter 650 in mid 2014.          I think most of us have a few times. Usually we got put in our place though. Naruto and Hinata are too lenient as parents and no one dares touch a kid spawned by ninja jesus.  It's the only way he knows how to repent.      She a girl, once she hit her first anything could cause her that much suffering  There are like 3-5 gaiden left  At least it still has anime unlike bleach  So whoe is going to REALLY end first? Naruto or OP           Naruto. Oda doesn't have a stop button.    so the antagonists all are byakugan aliums, some who have rinnegan handeyes as well?     Usually we got put in our place though.  hat makes you think bolt won't?  the whole movie is about him being put in his place        So 13 years have passed and Sasuke still doesn't have a new arm.  He doesn't need one. When you are as powerful as he is it no longer affects his daily life. It's his non-dominant arm anyway.      Oda doesn't have a stop button.   implying oda won't literally work himself to death despite (WJS Mandated) On Break Next Week.       It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  sauce was left handed before 698.     Making Hinata mama sad  This kid is shit.     He's ambidextrous.     We all know Oda's "breaks" are just him pumping out the next chapter and getting ahead for when the cassette runs out so they can continue the adventure for that little bit longer.     It's his non-dominant arm anyway.  They both lost their dominant arms, it's symbolism or something     I bet Himawari immediately forgave him cheerfully  then went to her room, burst into treats and cried silently into her pillow/favorite stuffed animal     adult Naruto still has the same voice    He doesn't die, he's this movie's "kidnapped princess", so Sasuke, the 4 other kage and Boruto set out to rescue him.    Bort having ANY of Naruto's moves doesn't make sense.  Even if he's a born genius with the best of both gene pools he's just a regular kid from a peacetime era.  Naruto's entire skill set came from the secret scroll he stole from the ninja FBI, and he was the only one of his generation able to pull off the techniques because he had absurd jinchuuriki battery life.   Rasengan lite is the only high tier technique Bort should have any chance at whatsoever, and that's only because Kishi gave it to Konobodyhamaru on a baseless whim.         so Sasuke, the 4 other kage and Boruto set out to rescue him   Salad doesn't get to come along on their interdimensional rescue mission    Bort gets to make up with his dad and brag to everyone in school the next day about how he killed an alien god       Is that a grill?    No, just a faggot.    tfw the other four Kage are so useless that they get outclassed by a 12 year old who hasn't even finished the Chuunin Exams       Just like dragonball characters. Blame nips.    fuck this edgelord     her favorite stuffed animal is a fox     It's albino Gaara   When can we expect competent subtitles for Naruto: The Last to come out?   B-but he has no Hitler stache.    why is the anime taking so long?    SP and their filler fetish. Their fight is slated to start on July 2nd.    July 22 the DVD/Blu-Ray comes out     Snake clan doing anything for Sauce after he barbecued Manda  Narnians don't HAVE to help nins out, right? Didn't Sasuke even contract with a bird once?     delicious salad booty  Even SP knows    He probably said he was sorry     implying anyone can ever stay mad at the Sauce   He is going on an interdimensional roadtrip with 4 people that were first hand witnesses to his kage summit chimpout.      inojin continues to be best girl      Ino's abomination doesn't look half bad there.     filename  kek  captcha is cake  kek again       Waait a sec.Right center pic.Do those two fuse?     If it wasn't for Chouchou the new InoShikaChou would be the perfect trap squad.     That cake looked delicious, too. Goddammit Bort.    Looks like a standard cake to me bro. It wasn't even that fancy.    Sauce looking dapper as fuck in the top right.    so who is mini-lee supposed to look like? those eyes look a bit unusual. wasn't he supposed to be a few years younger than bort, salad, and inoshakcho 2.0? he has the same radio earpiece as inojin and both are fighting grass nin, so I assume this is chunin exam second portion stuff.      After killing Manda, he still summoned a snake that obeyed him when him, Naruto and Sakura all summoned their creatures while fighting the ten tails.     top right  isn't this a children's movie     His retarded vest looks significantly less retarded if he looks like he has two arms.    He might be 10/10's kid like people thought. Or he might just be some faggot Lee found on the side of the road and shoved into a tacky green leotard.    You could easily salvage half of that cake.    Lee wasn't Guy's kid either, so maybe he's just some random loner    Gaara looks like a faggot with his new hairstyle.    It landed on the plate. most of that shit is salvageable.     Or he might just be some faggot Lee found on the side of the road and shoved into a tacky green leotard.  Most likely option. There are plenty of orphans and there is no mother of the child complaining about the training being too hard on the kid.     God, why does gaara have to look so gay. I mean, he probably is mad gay, but still     so who is mini-lee supposed to look like   Not Ten Ten.  Amd probably not even Lee.        he has the guy/lee eyebrows, but not the lower eyelash thing.  the solid black irises and overall eye shape don't match 10/10 either.  probably just an abducted child.        At least Temari knew she had to tie up that shit    That sounds terrible. I get that hes supposed to be a prodigy or some shit, but if hes anywhere near sasuke or naruto's level thats just retarded as hell. Or is supposed to somehow be both transmigrants at once or have ten tails chakra or some shit like that?    tenten became a wizard, let it go     probably just an abducted child.  kek The eyebrows most likely come with the outfit      Is Boruto being voiced by a woman?    He might pull it off with two arms, but why doesn't he cut the useless sleeve?   Who is Sarada's VA?   Just in case he needs to whip out a roboarm    Hasn't the anime taught you a lesson after all this time?     happy birthday to the ground     or just wear a long coat like back when he was edge surpreme?    A newbie seiyuu.  She voiced toddler Boruto in The Last.      Wait why didn't he get a new arm like Nurudu?    Why couldnt lee have a female clone? Fucking bodysuits are made for girls!   <br/>    dat Salad      the solid black irises and overall eye shape don't match 10/10 either.   both guy and lee had the solid black iris thing going on, but Lee's were larger with his gaping round eyes.  could be lee's kid, but thematically would make more sense to just be a student, but then again, why would lee have been training him in 700 as a presumably pre-genin?   solution: there are actually multiple mini-lees running around konoha now, all taken as war orphans from the aftermath of NWW4.           An old hag.    Sasuke and Chouji were the only ones that lucked out with those.   It'll all be worth it for the new Kana-boon song.   They had to downgrade the Sauce      Maybe hes "hiding" it like a trump card. Could even be an arm full of sharingans!    Anyone else notice Salad looks significantly less cute in the movie?    Everyone looks worse in SP art.    How long until Salad just hates her dad's guts.    From what you hear in the trailer it sounds bretty gud.     Anyone else notice Salad looks significantly less cute in the movie  No?       I dont know whats more retarded a) The fact that there are more Rinnegans b) The fact that Naruto, Ninja Jesus, who moves at the speed of light and can throw ki blasts that destroy entire mountain ranges while being the buddy of all 9 bijuu, is supposed to get kidnapped  I really cant wrap my head around that.       Are you implying she was a carpet muncher? She has never shown interested in vag, only Shikamaru's then underage cock.     Because we haven't seen shots of her emoting yet, though I'm glad there's finally some promotional art that shows her smiling rather than pulling the Sasuke face.       No scan of the characters we actually haven't seen.   Jesus Christ.      I wonder if she'll pop an extra tomoe or two when she sees Bort wearing her hopes and dreams like freshly skinned animals.     Himawari dresses in a bright yellow hoodie  Adorable. And she looks older, too. About as old as Bort did in chapter 700.     It looks like nips really love Salad    It's a Kamehameha wave    I'm just happy (and actually surprised) to see Himawari getting prominent placement on the promo material.  Also, the fact the Sakura survives the Gaiden intact is news to me. I could almost see Kishi killing her off at this point.       It's the path of redemption    Don't expect much, she didn't even get a shot in the long trailer while Tenten and Shino did.    birthday cake of sadness has 6 candles. assuming burrito is about 12 in the movie, they were probably about 3-4 and 9-10 in 700.      that upper left panel  Is he fucking posing with his clones while trying to wrangle a panda out of someone's garden?      Burrito after the move   I think I want to be Hokage.       just kidding!     Maybe it's just a flashback, there is still hope     I guess that means I'll have to fight you for the title, huh?   How about we start with some light Rasendoris before moving onto the heavier stuff?      dunno, but I guess we're supposed to infer that burrito is in like 99th percentile for chakra reserves even if he doesn't have an kurama juice in him, since most genin couldn't even do a single shadow clone without collapsing    Genetics, anon. Genetics. Also Uzumakis were known for having absurd amounts of chakra compared to normal people. Also he's got a wee bit of Kurama juice inside of him thanks to the whiskers, and even a tiny amount of that stuff probably fucktouples his chakra pool.    Inojin and Rock Lee's Kid would be one hell of a duo    Deception is one of ninja's weapons. Enemies, who don't know it, might think twice before attacking, if they think he has two arms.    Inojin looks alot less ugly animated.     dat filename      needing an arm when you have the supreme eye hax    So I'm more than a little confused by the trailer. In one part it looks like Burrito is winding up for a typical Chidori, and then the next second it looks like he just threw a fucking lightning bolt.  And then later on we see him doing a li'l babby Rasengan with two hands. Obviously Kishi wouldn't spoil what his special attack truly was, but I bet it's a mixture of the two. His not-Chidori and his Rasengan.     why do you care about me?   because youre my son ;)  We all know that this is what Sasuke will say      Sakura kept his left arm for the lonely nights so she can poke herself      Daddy issues intensify     He was supposed to wear more baggy clothes, wore a kind of Hyuuga symbol when he was younger and his face is more soft and round, like Hinata's rather than Naruto's. Small details like that are the first to go though. Compare the original sketches of the characters for The Last era and what actually ended up in the movie. Big difference. Then there is also the Byakugan that Kishi supposedly forgot, and the originally lavender eyes he had that later became blue.      chidori and rasengan lite are both the half-ass variants of a nature-infused shape manipulated chakra attack.  that said, rasengan makes sense with wind since the spiral ball storm goes hand in hand with the cutting nature of wind. another form or shape manipulation might suit the piercing nature of lightning chakra better.       I'd be hard pressed to say never. But that's because I have a single mother and she's honestly been pretty chill my whole life.     I worry about my children rebelling due to being a mangaka and having no time for them   finally I managed to finish that massive series that prevented me from spending time with my kids and made me worry about them rebelling   time to make a spinoff series where I express my worries by having the former MC's kid rebel instead of spending time with my own spawn        yfw they pull out some "Oh he just had to awaken the byakugan or He's just been hiding it with a jutsu or contacts or something.     WHERE ARE THE EVIL SPOILERS ??!!!    To be fair in the war they got outclassed by a 16 year old genin too. Standards clearly have been dropping in the time of peace.     Originally Kakashi made the Chidori because he was too stupid to add lightning chakra to his Rasengan.  Maybe this weird pseudo-Chidori is Bort's way around that?  One of the biggest problems with Nurudu's fighting style is how repetitive it got after a while. Nigga only had like 3 moves. It'll be nice to see something new introduced and not get completely overused. Seeing the development process of those techniques is what made them interesting in the first place.        From his interview with Oda, To me it seems like Mangaka have a habit of becoming addicted to their work to the point where they feel very uncomfortable when they're NOT making a comic. Like they just can't bring themselves to chill for a while.    That explains the God of Manga Tezuka.     all this power creep and copy-paste powers  How can anyone like naruto? It's shit.     Is he seriously going to use fucking Shadow Clones? Way to go, Kishi.     He already did it in the Gaiden  He's a prodigy, unlike his father.       I think it's not fair nor funny of you to joke about the death of evil's uncle like that.     Doesn't look like he does them en masse like his dad though.    looks like they're making him special by just being another generic jonin-in-a-genin's body kind of prodigy.    shadow clone or two    rasengan    competent taijutsu and thrown weapon skills   byakugan's just too hard to make interesting combat scenes around, since it completely negates the "look at me surprise you with this attack" thing and is only good for really contrived setups.         I hope Sasuke gets to use his overpowered Rinnengan powers and shit, I've been starved from that shit since Madara jobbed like.. a jobber...   I bet is just going to Chidori and petty shit like that though..      Everyone uses shadow clones, anon. The difference is whether you make 5 of them or 50.    He's a prodigy   learned a variant of Chidori at the age of 12   also learned how to Rasengan without clones at the same time   smashed that shit together and help killed alien Master Blaster  Keikaku fucking doori.           why does it look like gaara?     He already did it in the Gaiden  Naruto used clones to play tag with Bolt, but not much more happened than that. I was referring to Bolt making the finger cross sign thing Nardo always did when using clones. Best case scenario, it's only to add the lightning element to his Rasengan.      evil not posting spoilers either means the chapter is boring, she's busy or she wants people to think it's boring but it's actually a huge bomb    I thought Boruto's clothes were supposed to be a reference to his dad's greatest hero     Not the same anon, but since I don't lurk those forums I had no idea.  I apologize anyway.       Chidori, Amaterasu and Susanoo. Might use his bait-and-switch eyes to get out of a jam or something. Basically shit we've already seen a hundred times with the MS that doesn't require the stupid fucking Rinnegan.   Nigga won't even make a sick robot arm to replace the one he lost in a gay bar fight.      Jashin?     Naruto used clones to play tag with Bolt, but not much more happened than that.   I was referring to Bolt making the finger cross sign thing Nardo always did when using clones   1/2       Actually Minato also wore similar shit. CG's jacket in that pic definitely looks closer to Bort's though.    I was joking anon, get that dick out of your ass, if that was real we would talk about it here more often     yfw she unlock MS through maximum happiness     2/2  He can already use clones, and did it against Naruto when playing tag.      Well, the comparison was never fair. We have known for ages that Naruto was cockblocked by Kuruma when he was a child.     surrounded by bishies while Bolt watches     I dunno, he looks exactly the same as he did in 700.   Maybe SP took some liberties with Bort's design for the movie to make him look more like a child of two people.       Sarada unlocks MS on her wedding day right as she says "I do."     yeah that was revealed by kakashi tree walking and Jiraiya water walking/ frog summoning.    Clone tag looks like fun.    Exactly. Now you can see what kind of shit those genes can do with proper training and without the tsundere demon fox being a dick.     armpits   ZR   Salad is such a semen demon       Her mom dresses her like a slut.    Holy shit I just noticed the intensity of that ZR. Fuck man, they know exactly what they're doing.    Holy shit Bort does have the byakugan    "Remember Salad. Get them staring at your body and in the distraction use your gorilla strength to punch them in the face."    "I cannot write any better than this" in a trailer    He's not exactly wrong. Let's hope the movie is good and Kishi can finally hang up his hat for good.   Wishful thinking, I know.      That's pretty smart. The enemy will never know the itch is actually Amaterasu burning his crotch.    His name can't be Boruto, I thought it's a new meme.    What the shit, Chouchou's not even in this movie?    Na-Ru-To Bo-Ru-To also Yellow Flash Bolt  Thematically it fits, but it sounds awkward in English.          Then you obviously haven't read any naruto since 699.    Boruto is the loanword for Bolt. It's Engrish, basically.   Just like Sarada sounding like Salad.      Doesn't even have a listed VA. No one wants to play a fat nigger.    She probably will, she is apart of InoShikaChou and was on the movie poster.    Himawari is taking up her spot.    and Madara is Maldla    Bolt   Salad   Mitsuki   Konohamaru  I'm okay with this. I even kinda want to see a little more with them all since I already know Konohamaru ain't going to do shit in this movie.       No, Madara would be Madala.    Mandela?   Which club would you join if you could pick one from any anime?   I speak for all of /a/ when I say 帰宅部 because you would not be on /a/ here if you're in a club.

If you had to take the initiative I could understand, but you would get girls just throw at you as part of a programed activity, it would be very comfortable, is like in any other club really, you are never comfortable at the beginning but you end up doing things because you are told so, and come on, by this time of the game I bet all of you are capable of maintain an erection for 2 or 3 hours am right? I know I can.    The swimming club in Free. It would improve my chances with girls.   The hair brushing club.   Only if you have that  kinniku    The club club. Where you do club things.    One day, two mentions of KKK  It has finally caught fire!  And yes, I'm going with them too.         hanging out with faggots   Everybody thinks you're a faggot by association    you become a faggot by association       mah nigga    There was sorority in Onii-sama e.     What if I become their girl member?    How technologically inclined is your waifu? Does she need help using computers? Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?     She can't really do that, she's not here physically after all, only in soul.  But my Yunocchi isn't a very technical person, that's for sure, but it's not like she's never used a computer! So Yuno would most likely ask for my help with anything technical around the house.      Makoto has a lot of technical stuff in his room like a TV, game consoles and a computer but he doesn't seem particularly knowledgeable about it in general, maybe above average. His strong fields are physical activities after all.   deder than bread up in here   She could use it just fine.    I don't really think she would be especially savvy. She shouldn't have much problems with just using computers or other devices, but she rather wouldn't be able to repair them.   It's not the best time to start thread.        Mai doesn't use computers and the type of weapon she uses was invented in the Bronze Age. So it could be argued that she isn't particularly proficient with technology.    She's got skills, can do the best programming, especially vidya. Well if it gets a virus or something, she can help me too.  Pretty much.  It's 1:45 am here, i think i will sleep and post again later   And at least leaving one question: Do you have something in common with your waifu?          Does your waifu ever have sleepovers with her friends? What does she do in them or what do you imagine she'd do if she doesn't have any?  (Mai does appear to do so based on this image. From what we can see, she and her friends appear to be trying on cosmetics such as nailpolish, styling their hair differently and putting on different clothes.)    I want to kiss my waifu on the nose.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127107959  What is the point of this post?    He's an underage spammer/shitposter.   Does your waifu resemble her parents or other relatives?  (Mai as a teenager does appear to resemble her mother. She's never shown clearly but they both have long hair of the same color and hair antennae. Beyond that she doesn't have any siblings and no other relatives of her other than her parent are shown.)     Well, with all the high-tech gear she uses, I'm guessing either she built them herself or she at least knows how to maintain them.  That is, she's much more technically inclined than I could ever be.    She's ronerier than I am.          We both are introvert and we both enjoy romantic setting/activities, I guess.   I dunno, she would probably just do usual activities in them like talking, having fun by styling each other hair.  She would be really embarrassed if someone asked her about relationship with me~    I want to kiss my waifu on everywhere. Especially on the lips.   No idea. There is no info about her parents.             We share a bunch of minor personality traits, but other than that we're not that alike, it's more that Yunocchi and I make a good match.   Usually when they have a little tea party in one of their apartments, it's easier and more fun to stay over.  Just normal teenage girl stuff, nothing particularly out of the ordinary.   She does, they are her parents after all.             Seeing as her very existence was erased/cursed by the most badass of overlords, nobody really knows if she even HAS parents.    In almost every way possible, we're exact opposites. She's incredibly determined, passionate, unyielding and has pretty damn good hand-eye-coordination. The only thing we have in common is probably the fact that we're both pretty shameless.   There isn't a single part of her body I wouldn't want to put my lips on.  What would you give your waifu for her birthday?  If I could somehow make it happen, I'd give my waifu  Makai Wars 2 .              She's really good with tech.   Not too much, I guess love for robots.   One ending in the game.   Looks somewhat similar to her sister.             She's probably adept at casual browsing but nothing of the programming sorts! She can most definitely handle most things on her end as long as it isn't too complex. She's definitely the leading pioneer in my heart's fields!  As for making or repairing, my dreams and my heart. She's made many of my nights wondrous, and a lot of my days bearable.   We've both had bad moments in our childhood and have trust issues.   She has! She either hogs the pools or stays away from all the ruckus and trouble.   She looks like a less mature and certainly less volatile version of her mother, and she'd probably get annoyed at me if I said that. She does share a lot of traits from both parents, but didn't really show much resemblance to them as a young child.   I wish I could keep giving her the same smiles and happiness that I often see her in. I wish I could keep giving every time, every day just to see her smile, but the times are a bit tough and I haven't had the ability to in the past eight months. It feels bad, but I hope that one day that it'll all even out and everyone goes home happy.                  Something she has lately showed interest in, eg. a dress she said that looks nice or jewelry she find nice. Otherwise, something related to her hobbies, like new microphone, headphones or something. And I would also take her on a really nice date to the place she really like, of course.   How long would you wait to have children with your waifu? Would you do it right now, wait until you get financially stable and had house or maybe wait for both of you reach particular age?        Never. I don't want children now or in the future.    I'd love it if she makes a song for me.  We're both weird and we like music.  I think she sleeps with her friend before her friend died. They were close and always stick together because of work, after all.  She doesn't resemble her uncle which is the only shown relative so far.  I'd give her a sword because she likes those.  I'd wait till we get married. Of course I want us to have a stable life first, we're married and has her family's approval before making kids, I don't want her family to get angry to her.              She's never used one before, so she'd need some help with it.  She makes my day.    Nothing major.   No, and i don't think they're really her kind of thing.   She shares some traits with her sister.   Something she's shown interest in, along with what i bake for her.   I'd wait until she'd be in good health.                    Very technologically inclined, for obvious reasons. Can't really say she's the leading pioneer though, as she's one of the mass-production models. Then again, she's the only remaining one, can't really say in that case. She aced all the engineering classes, so I'm betting she could fix most kinds of machinery. I'd want her to teach me some too.  A few things. We both like machines, have no patience for indirect approaches, say what's on our mind without holding back. She's a lot more positive and hopeful though.  Haven't seen her do sleepovers. But if she did, probably the same things girls do on such occasions. Talk a lot, be made to wear cute outfits, play those silly truth or dare games.  Just hope they don't decide to do a pillow fight, because if so, say goodbye to the bed.   I want to kiss her everywhere. But today, I'm inclined to forehead, in a loving praise sort of way.  Not in a physical sense. Despite mass production, they all differ from each other in small but significant ways. As for her 'mother', she resembles her very little.  I wish I could give her eternal happiness. But if you mean like an object, then I'd commission  Robocop's gun arm  for her. She might like it.  A trip to a science fair or an escapade to travel around and see the world are good options too.  Wait until we've accomplished all our dreams, so that we can finally settle down with no regrets. Then we can  construct  offspring, maybe adopt too.                    Hello!  He seems talented enough. Most pillar men are so intelligent that they tend to refer to the latest human technology as mere toys. Then again, I'm sure if he actually tried to use something like a computer, he might find himself surprised!   Something tells me that we'd repair things together or hand the job to whichever one of us has the time to do it. I do come from a family that likes to tinker with things after all, so it's not like I'm totally helpless when it comes to things like plumbing or mechanics. There's nothing we wouldn't be able to fix, I don't think.    We love niceu fightos!    A manly sleepover? Sounds interesting. Then again, considering his series, I wouldn't be surprised if a sleepover he'd go to played out much the same way.  I want to have a private sleepover with my husbando and do each other's nails!     We never see his parents and he has no siblings. I do have some pictures that someone made of what his parents could possibly look like, however! Naturally, his father resembles him quite a lot.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.    Whenever we're both ready. There's a lot of things to consider when it comes to having sonfus, of course.                          Is your waifu self-conscious about the size of her breasts?  Do you like your waifu's VA? How popular is she?   Mai is very polite, which is something I think I share with her, at least to an extent.  Perhaps she would like an antique blade.  Some greater stability would be good.  No, she's pretty well endowed and doesn't seem to concern herself with her chest size. If anything, she makes her less endowed friends feel jealous.  I hadn't really paid attention to Saori Hayami before she started voicing Mai, but since then I have been paying attention to her roles. She's very popular and cam third in this VA poll: http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/int<wbr>erest/2015-04-06/kana-hanazawa-hiro<wbr>shi-kamiya-lead-in-favorite-voice-a<wbr>ctor-poll/.86759</wbr></wbr></wbr>             Probably average levels of tech understanding for a Japanese high schooler, maybe a little less because she's clumsy   We're clumsy   Don't know but I hope so given she lives alone and is probably lonely.   Who doesn't?   She doesn't seem to resemble her brother and you never see her parents   A comb or hair clips for her beautiful hair   Financial and emotional stability should be a prerequisite for having children. Age and marital status are less important so long as the woman isn't too young or old to have children meaning anywhere outside 15-40 years old.   She's self conscious of her weight which is maybe related to the size of her breasts.                        How would you respond if you discovered that your waifu used to be a man?   Well, she piloted a Mecha once so she knows enough about technology. All in all she is pretty intelligent.   We're both kinda lazy and we both love pizza. I also like teasing my friends like she sometimes does.  I really would love to have a children with her but I don't think I would be a good parent.  She slept really long in Lelouchs room do you could count that as sleepover, but if it's a sleepover with her friends and stuff, they would probably eat fast-food, talk all night long and sleep till noon.          I'm sure we would really like to have children sooner, but we would wait until we got house with enough space for kids and until we would be financially stable. I want to be sure our kids will have good living conditions.   Probably. However I would remind her that her bust size is perfect for me and that it looks really cute and arousing with her petite body multiple times.   I don't care about her at all. She doesn't even sound like Miku.          Not really, but sometimes it is shown that she hides her breasts. I hope she gets more confident about her perfect chest.  She's the most popular seiyuu of this age, and she's named as "The Queen of Anison". Fuck yes, I like her. I admire her a lot.  I won't be that shocked, since she's manly anyway, she gets more bitches than I do.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Fuck off, retard. No one cares if your feelings are genuine.  The correct term for loving multiple 2D girls is harem and there are dedicated threads for people like you. Waifu threads are meant only for people who are in love with only one girl so you will never be welcomed here. Leave this place and go to harem threads.     Not really, no. She helped out with water damage, at least.   Brown hair and eyes.   There was that OVA released a few days ago where she's at one with the other fairies, so it's not out of the question. They'd most likely drink and have food, maybe talk about the day.   Never say her parents.   That one BL doujin that'll most likely get burned if TPP passes today.   Until we are both ready for a child and at marriage. The 25 range seems most suitable.   Shocked at the fact that she was a man, then shocked that she might actually be gay.  I'd still keep her, though.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  Get out.  Does your waifu ever read any doujins? What kind, if she does, and what kind do you think she'd read if she didn't? Non-H works are acceptable answers.                           Unfortunately, yes. I want to alleviate her of her insecurity by reassuring her that they're gorgeous  or just repeatedly impregnating her until they're a few sizes larger .    She replaced the battery in my F 91-W  Hardly  I doubt it  The world may never know  A Nixie clock. Or maybe a snowglobe, snowglobes are cool  Maybe in the late 20's. Sounds like a much better age to start. Better to wait until one is finished with education and has a career  They're not badly sized, I doubt it.  Oh my, the voice. The VOICE. It might be the most sexy thing about her  My dong only expands further <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200  In my particular case it's inevitable. For other waifus, absolutely haram                      That wouldn't change anything about her, so I don't see why one should focus on the past. I think that the reaction of Mai's friends when they discovered about her past (illustrated here) is a good one.  I'm pretty sure that Mai has never read any doujinshi, since most of the world's nuclear armaments were dropped on Japan and wiped that country off the face of the Earth close to a century before she was born. She's pretty innocent.and easily embarrassed though, so I imagine that she'd prefer to read light-hearted humorous non-H doujinshi.      She lives in Soul Society which is essentially feudal Japan, the only people using advanced technology belong to the Technological Development Department which she is not a part of. She has spent a lot of time on earth and knows about our technology I.E computers but I doubt she is well versed in utilizing them.  I'd say we're both bold and heavily supportive of our friends.  She sleeps in MC's closet whenever she comes to earth. She doesn't partake in any activities outside of the usual drawing and reading. I don't think she has actually ever had a traditional sleepover.  Don't we all?  She looks almost identical to her late sister and looks eerily similar to her adoptive brother despite no blood relation.  Something chappy related, probably a plush toy. Perhaps a brand new set of high quality drawing utensils, she loves to draw after all.  Not the largest fan of kids, but with her there is a possibility. I'd want to take proper responsibility and thus wait until we're both financially able to support a child as well be being both physically and mentally ready to support the child.  Her breast size is rather small, especially compared to other characters in the same series  not that I'm complaining of course  but she never mentions or even implies she is bothered by it at all. She doesn't care one bit, which is great.  Fumiko Orikasa is great, she's the perfect voice for Rukia. She's voice acted quite a few characters but she's mainly known for her role of Rukia.  Hey, friend.  Orihime a cute.   We talking magical transformation or post operation? I'm surprised to say the least.                                she's pretty good with technology, and can figure anything out if there's a manual to skim through   we're pretty similar, especially in terms of sleepiness and personality.    Most likely. They have a camping trip, in which she spends the entire time asleep - waking up when it's time for food.    Her Grandmother is her only living relative, and they look incredibly similar.    a book, or something cute.   probably never   not really, but she's certainly aware in the difference between her breast size and that of her well endowed friends.   Yep,the voice is perfect. She's not very well known though.   I don't think so.  you're waifu a cute, by the way  If money wasn't an option, where would you take you're waifu on holiday? What would you do?                            Don't derail the thread.  Ded tred. Are waifus finally obscure again?    Basic as fuck, watches idol videos on YouTube. Yes. Nope, she's dumb as fuck but is a natural leader (which I like).  She gave me sweets, different each time.    We are both hyperactive, klutz, disorganized usually, air-headed and one-track minded. Also very stubborn.   Yes. Practices, swims (if pools or at the beach), and eats for days; pillow fights are possible and tends to wander around while asleep.   More on her mother. Slight resemblance to her little sis.   Bread with strawberry jams. Varied imports.   Need a house or two so she can be at ease.   Not really.   Yes! Quite a bit, I suppose.                           Not in the near future.  Maybe once (if) she manages to syujinko it up.    She's not flat, and she never seems to have any trouble with them. With her recent Idol escapades, I'm sure she's pretty satisfied with her own body.    tfw different VAs for every game    Wouldn't really change much. The past is the past afterall.   Unfaithful manwhore.                I'm quite sure she's the type to use Doujinshi as "research material".    Until we're financially stable and emotionally ready.  But definitely not before Yunocchi had a chance to explore and further her artistic path!   Only a tiny bit, it doesn't come up all that often. Though she generally tends to be a little insecure.   She's pretty popular, mainly thanks to the role in which she voiced my wife. A good voice actress all around.            Oh shit   is meant to be<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113200       My waifus   Her VA is in everything this season. It's great to hear her voice in so many roles.    I'm pretty sure she doesn't. She probably wouldn't watch any pornography at all.   Rented house near sea. We would go to beach a lot, explore nature around, watch sunsets etc.   Why would they? It's normal for a thread to be slow at this time of a day.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115413  It doesn't matter. How would you feel if your waifu had another man? It's the same as NTR-ing your waifu.  Falling in love with multiple people comes off as never truly falling in love with a single one of them.  Harems a shit       Who made it law that someone can only "truly" fall in love with one person? Seems arbitrary to me.     law  Do you have reading comprehension issues?     6 pm isn't a slow time here    My point in saying that is that everybody acts as if it's law, when it's not. Love knows no man-made arbitrary rules. Who is anyone to deny you your love because THEY deem it unfit?    It's not about your feelings, dipshit, but about the girl's.   Enough about polygamy! Question time!  What couple activity would you like to do with your waifu? Yes, watching vietnamese pictographs count as a couple activity if you're doing it together.  We'd probably play vidyas together and she would probably rant about how the RNG hates her.        How retarded do you have to be to not understand what people are saying to you? <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127113477  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127115002      People like that are just egotistical scum, they don't even stop for a second to thing about the girls' feelings. It's despicable.   I doubt she would, unless maybe for artistic references. She'd rather read the original work to begin with, though.     I'm not much for travelling, but for my Yunocchi's sake, we'd most likely to any location with a rich art history. If she's having fun, then I will be too!          I understand what they're saying. I just think they're wrong.   Why? Isn't having actual discussion more interesting than playing questionnaire?      Stop taking the bait.   She seems somewhat computer literate. Nothing spectacular, mind you, but nothing minor either.  We both have a thing for good music, plus we're pretty similar in terms of personality.  Quite often. She's pretty closely knit with her friends, though what exactly happens during these sleepovers is beyond me. As long as it doesn't involve leek sticks being stuck in awkward places...  Hard to answer. There's no info on her parents, and she isn't the type to talk about them.  The best platter of tuna sushi that I can prepare.  Definitely the latter. She still has a career to think about, and I don't want to do anything that might bring that to an end.  Wouldn't mind trying, though...   She can be, but only because of the attention they bring her... She might not be the biggest, but they are big enough to draw the eyes of the jealous and lecherous.  She's got a nice sultry voice. Can't say anything too bad about Yuu. Though a high point would be hearing her squee as Sakaki in a certain scene from Azumanga Daioh.  Well, nobody's perfect.  Highly doubtful. Then again, her mind can be particularly lewd when she wants.  A nice stroll through a park sounds nice. Just have to find a nice park in my area.  A nice sea cruise to the tropics. She's always loved being out on the water.                          Having a stroll while holding hands and talking together, cuddling under blanket in front of fireplace at winter evening, kissing while watching stars or sunset and much more.   Not in USA.       Don't tell me what to do.    Obligatory    she would download ALL the dolphin screensavers. those free toolbars also sound useful   most of the related group-trip is off camera, but its one of the few times shes shown interacting with just other girls aside from that her sister also stays with them so it's sort of like every night is a sleep over   her hair colour is similar in the second season but aside from that they don't look much like their younger sister and her parents are never shown.   my stance on it has flip flopped a lot back and forth but I think I'd really just have to ween her character into it I might start her off with a puppy so she gets used to having responsibility, I also like dogs myself so its not that big a deal if I end up taking care of it on my own or something  I'd love to have a daughter with her, just thinking about it makes my heart race a bit, but there is so much to think about before then.    no, she's incredibly non-self-conscious about just about anything   they're both great her jap isn't that popular, and also voiced one of the most hated characters on /a/, but her dub has a massive history of roles with some of the most popular dubs on /a/, notably bebop   given her abilities I suppose it's not exactly impossible, but it also would be by magic instead of snapping a dick off and making a flesh hole so I'm down.   she's read regular manga, so I'd think she'd have no issues reading non-h it'd be interesting walking in on her reading an h-doujin not hearing me come in with her face blushing  I'm not sure whether I'd sneak out so I don't get bludgeoned for spooking her or sneak in further and try to initiate by kissing her neck while shes concentrating    gardening seems nice, though I'd be a little afraid if she got too enthusiastic she might somehow acquire some sort of giant venus fly trap that keeps us at bay from the garden until it dies                                  Does your waifu know how to please a man?   Shinobu's pretty smart. She's one of the more talented biopsychologists in Academy City although not the best, and she's pretty proud of it. She's also confident with machines and computers.  I don't think she can help me with my psychology, my biology, maybe.   I don't believe she has sleepovers, since she previously used to live alone and didn't have any friends. She probably does with Janie and Febrie now though.   I couldn't say, since her relatives and such were never shown.   Spend time with her. She likes reassurance that she's doing good.    Probably would prefer to wait until we had a house. However, a lot of that stuff can be excuses, and she's shown that she's partial to kids so the answer would be 'as soon as possible'.   She never mentions anything like that, so she probably thinks that it's silly. Or maybe she does privately.   Hayama Ikumi? She's okay, not super popular. I haven't gone out of the way to check her roles out, and none of them that I've heard are anything like Shinobu.   I'd be surprised at how advanced science has come.   A relaxing resort or the like.   We could visit cafes often, does that count? OR take Janie and Febrie around to play and shit.   Boy, reading the word 'couple activities' used to make me mad.   Blogshit warning: I've recently been questioning myself a lot because 80 - 90% of my thoughts regarding her have been of wanting to do lewd stuff, which does betray a certain shallowness. I'm not quite sure how to overcome this, I probably need to give more thought to her personality.                                    Not at all.   Amusing ones.   That's a cute outfit.   Sex.             She's really good with Technology, she's always on her laptop and she's great with tinkering electronic devices  She made some headphones once as a gift, they are described as "revolutionary" which shows off her amazing skill     Quick, share one sexual fantasy you have with your waifu  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127117509  The waifufags are the worst.    We both love technology and music, i mostly like calm and relaxing environments and so does she, and we both like sharing random trivia   She has a really close friend but she moved away, i don't think she has any sleepovers   I'd give her a brand new laptop, hers must be pretty old That and a piece of jewelry, maybe a necklace           I want to  make love to her  in the  missionary position  while I  hold  her soft, warm  hands  and then  cuddle  afterwards    Fuck her cute butt.    Making love in formal wear comes to mind.   Alternatively omorashi      The fanbase considers her a queen in that regard.  In the shower or on a billiard table.      I wanna give her a slow pleasurable oral while she wraps her thighs around my head and i massage different parts of her   She's a Super Class A hacker   Ahh, but how is she when she doesn't surf?    But I thought she was incredible math    Rather not, but I would lead her to make us both feel good. Her pleasure would be more important to me though.   Romantic, passionate sex in lotus position while embracing tightly and looking into each other eyes, I guess.        Has your waifu made or repaired anything for you?   How can she? She's not real.      Chihiro prefers to read books on paper, but she's accepted the growing influence of the internet and its effects on people.   We're both huge nerds who love art   Book covers.  And books to put those covers on    Until we're in a stable life situation and after we're married.   No   Yes, but not that popular. It's good, since i don't have to think of her in other roles much.   It's Chihiro I care about, but this scenario is neither here or there since she's cis  love    Probably, she loves Shoujo manga so despite fandom claims I don't think she'd read yaoi.   We'd watch movies. Chihiro doesn't like reading together since she'd want to talk if we're around, so movies sound like they would work.  How would you greet her after you've had a long day of work? I'd give her a hug and kiss and if she weren't too busy I'd invite her to lay down and watch something with me.                              Thanks.   Sex with her on my lap  while interlocking our fingers    L-Lewd!          I'd wait until we both have a stable situation, a home and a good income   She doesn't seem to be too worried about it, she seems happy with herself as she is, which is great   I do, Mamiko Noto does a great job showing Fuuka as the gentle and caring person she is   I'd probably take her sightseeing, there's not much to do in port Island but I'm sure we could just walk around and make a picnic under a three or watch some movies   We'd go sightseeing and taking photographs, we could also watch some live music shows and concerts                That's too private to say!    But it's not like I hadn't mentioned face sitting and spanking her cute butt before.    A long and tight hug, then pick her up for a kiss, and carry her right to bed for some quality cuddling time.        I'm going to impregnate Nero! I love my emperor!   I think that New Zealand would be an interesting country to visit.  I used to do fencing. Maybe we could try that out and see what I remember, though she would trounce me quite effortlessly. (I did foil while her fighting style resembles the sabre but I don't think she'd have any problems adapting.)  She's a virgin and has never had a boyfriend, but I'll wager that she knows what she'd need to do for that.  A hug and kiss sounds like a good way to proceed.          I'd hug her and ask how her day went, serve her some tea, give her a massage to relieve her stress, and make sure she's satisfied and relaxed  Question What would be your waifu's ideal vacation?  (Fuuka seems the type of girl who'd love a nice landscape, i imagine taking her some place with lot's of wilderness)         If she's home when I am, I'd greet her with a warm hug and some tender words. Usually depends on how exhausting my day has been.   She seems fond of any place with nice scenery, though she seems especially lively near the ocean. It's part of the reason I'd like to take her on an ocean cruise one of these days.  I've only been on one, and I wouldn't mind giving that same experience to someone close to me.        The size, not really. She may feel bad that they aren't soft though.  Haven't really seen a lot of other stuff she's done, but I like what I've seen. Unsure how popular she is, but she doesn't seem to get many roles.  Not very surprised. She may look like and identify as a girl, but she has turned out to be rather flexible in that regard.  I would hope she wouldn't read them at all. Otherwise I may get really clumsy flirting or awful jokes thrown at me.  Actually, that sounds kinda nice .  I don't think she's ever been to the mountains. Let's go there.  So many things: Playing games. Cuddling. Going out holding hands. Take her to a fancy party and dance. Sparring. Go shopping.  Fighting evil back to back against impossible odds, and propose there and then. It's the most romantic setting of all.   You lost me.  Well, the most sexual thing we could possibly do would be  hugging .  Hello Chihiroman!  Say "I'm back", receive "Welcome back".  But that's not enough, gotta wrap an arm around her waist and pull her in for a kiss. Or nuzzle her neck with my nose, that's fine too.   She enjoys learning and seeing new things, so the best thing for her would be a trip around the world. 80 days might not be enough though.                                She at least knows how to use a computer but I doubt she's tech savvy. Well she could give herself the necessary skills to be.  Pretty opposite except for a love of things that are artistic.  Seen pics of her and Casko sleeping together so I guess that counts.  She does resemble her mother and if you buy into the theory that she and Arturia are related then of course they resemble each other.  Almost like clones or something.<br/>   I always have trouble thinking of something for this but maybe a party and a trip to the theater.  I don't really want any and she seems like she'd be too busy but if she wanted it then I would wait till things settled down.  Naw. She knows she looks great.  Sakura Tange is great and I would think she would be popular for voicing Sakura Kinomoto.  Not surprised. I guess that's how she really got away with being recorded as a man.  She hasn't been shown to but I can see her reading yuri ones. Also ones about herself.  Perhaps a trip to the most beautiful cities in Europe.  I'd like to work on an art piece with her and take part in one of her plays.  Man and/or woman, her technique is the best.  Steamy sex in the bath.   Looks like she's popular.                                 Almost our entire relationship is based upon things we have in common, it's what attracted me to her so much in the first place. We are lazy, daydreamers, prone to hoarding, dislike bureaucracy, love potatoes, enjoy inebriation, navigate life at our own slow and steady tempo, and a lot more to boot!  Talking, fun, teasing, drinking, playing and sleeping.  Her twin sister Ursula looks precisely the same as her, just with glasses.  I'll think about that next April.  As long as we need. I really want to, but realistically, we're still too lazy as of now.  Not usually. She looked a bit miffed in S2/E10 when Francesca groped Hanna but aside from that one time, she seems fine with her petite bust, even when surrounded by larger girls. In any case, I prefer slim girls. Built for speed!  I think Sakura Nogawa is somewhat underrated, although that could just be my own bias.  If money isn't an option, then we'll have to make do with camping in the forest nearby.  She pleases me regularly but I prefer to please her.  Ignore those who would attack that as blogshit, as they'll only be crying about the questions and lack of interaction later. Anyway, what you describe may not be shallowness as much as becoming carried away with lewdness, which is something that can happen to many of us (including me). At any rate, you seem to be able to answer the questions well.  Being handcuffed as she sits on my face while lovingly applying a pleasure/pain combo of oral and CBT! Well, you did ask...  Standard-issue hug and kiss, quickly wash my face and hands, followed by a makeout session on the couch/bed. This may lead to either cuddling, lewd, or both!  Anywhere with sun and good ice-cream, so she can just eat and relax in the shade.                            Changing waifus is degeneracy, right?    Same here     Not necessarily, it wholly depends on the specific circumstances.  But most excuses are scummy.      She is never seen using computers. I think she may need some assistance in using a computer.  We have a couple of things in common like fighting for our friends.  Yes she definitely does. She is the one who make cake and stuff to eat and she is the lewdest around them.  Oh yea Akeno looks exactly like her mother  I would give her lingerie  She would want me to get settled into a house then have our child  Biggest bust in the series she doesn't care  I love her VA. She is pretty popular http://myanimelist.net/people/93/It<wbr>ou_Shizuka  Why should that matter I dont think she would change if she was a he  She does not read doujins though she does watch   porn   on her free time  I would take her to   Go to the movies then go to my home and relax  If you mean massages and finger licking   SAndM with her which turns to passtionate sex to make children            </wbr>                   Vidya, naps, and the aforementioned pictographs.    kissu and cuddles, and a cup of tea.    somewhere quiet, like a nice forest lodge.          Chihiro's ideal vacation is sort of like Kyoto: Lots of stuff to see and a relaxing area. Distant, yet familiar at the same time.  The Fushimi shrine is also in Kyoto but that has not much to do with it and is likely coincidence    Hello, Aigisfriend! Chihibro is fine, really. I do wish there was a way I could get to know you more, I like getting to know my fellow Personafriends.        She's average at it, she knows how to use her computer/phone, she have no problems with these kind of things.  She made  me happy.    Minor personality traits, we love cute stuff, and both afraid of heights.   She had a few of them. They did a lot of stuff in them, played games, girls talk, she really enjoyed them.   I want to headpat the bassist.   Her parents are never shown, and she's the only kid of the family, so I have no answer to this question.   A new amp.  That's what she was thinking about what she would buy if she had extra money  But also a nice gateau au chocolat, flowers, and a few other things.   Until we have our own place, and a stable situation.   She is. Her best friend is also jealous of them at the beach.   I like her and she's kinda popular.   I would wonder what kind of technology was used, because there's not a single trace of her previous self, she can even be pregnant, that's amazing.   Never.   A tropical island, where we could be alone on the beach, relax, play in the water, sunbathe, and do lewd things. Or maybe a nice cabin in the Alps, mountains are lovely, I've always loved them  and the word Mountain is also in her name, that's a sign    Taking bass lessons with her as the teacher. Biking together. Cuddles.  I love her.                                                 she is better than that    J-Jellycatz? You are still alive?     She does use magitech a lot and doesn't need help with those computers, but she's not exactly an expert with that stuff.   We both care about justice.   I can see a resemblance to her mother, and she looks like Alicia for obvious reasons.   Not any specific age, just when we both fell like we're ready.   She seems fine with their size.   She's extremely popular, and I really like her. Can't wait for that Live Acoustic BD.   Someplace on a lake where we could spend time together.   Build Gunpla together.   A hug and kiss, and ask her how it went.                             If Yomiko reads a book on the subject I think she can master the computer     Something in common  Our love of literature    I imagine Nene sleeping over whenever she would come to do the cleaning    Her parents are never seen so I have no idea    A bunch of books or try to track down a signed edition of one of her favourite her novels    A couple years, that's if we really want too.    I think she's pretty oblivious to how big they are    Yomiko's VA has only voiced her    Probably not doujins but I imagine her reading good old lewd literature    Probably Paris for literary reasons     Reading together, going to bookshops and just buying what we can find, going to book festivals.    Making love to Yomiko against a book case in a library, trying to be as quiet as possible as we undress one another, next would be bending her over a table and doing doggy.     A hug then kiss and I'd tell her I would prepare some tea, maybe a shoulder rub or foot rub to go along with it.  What have you done for your waifu lately? I've bought about 16 or so books lately which I hope Yomiko would enjoy.                                                        I've been exercising and arranging my folders a lot i need to have it all nice and tidy    Apart from the an eager hug, a long relaxing dinner and getting shit about our respective days off our chest, if she wants.    Mentioned it earlier - nothing too stimulating, something chill like a cruise or resort. I'd like that too.   Thanks again.   I made a new reference pic for WWD, eh, and wrote some stuff. I 'went out' with her a few times. Saw a Railgun LN in the bookstore which made for a strange experience.  How do you guys feel 'close' to her - following a routine, doing stuff, looking at merch?               Rather than going to a single location a luxury cruise with just the two of us sounds pretty great.  Couple activity? Now I'm no romantic but things like; Video games, watching movies, cooking and just generally hanging out with her would be a lot of fun.  She knows how to please me. Thats enough.  Bondage sounds like something worth trying out. If only once.   Welcome home! Shall I run you a bath? Or perhaps you'd like something to eat? Or maybe...you want me?   My geography is bad, I can't name a single place. But Rukia really likes high places, so someplace with mountains, maybe cliffs.                <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  It's a thing with squares that you eat for breakfast, but that's not important right now.   she is a gamer   I think Kagura knows the basics. She wouldn't accidentally download a load of viruses on a computer or anything like that.  She repaired  my soul.    We both like videogames and swimming.   Her parents have never been seen, so I can't say for certain.   I bought her a necklace for her birthday last year. Nothing too fancy, just something she can wear all the time. I haven't thought about what to do for this year.   We'd definitely need some financial stability;  there's no way I could afford having a child on a part time wage.  A house/apartment to ourselves with plenty of space would also be a good idea.   Not really,  she's pretty endowed as is.    Kuwashima's one of the best, in my opinion. She has great range and has done a lot of work since the mid-90's, and still going.   It wouldn't change a thing between the two of us.   I don't think she does, but if she did I could see her being into shounen/sports manga.                             absolutely none at all   Working on my outer appearance. Trying to look good for her.  Come next week, I'll be training to become an instructor.    Listening to her songs is usually the way to go when I'm home. Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side; it's a feeling that flares up even more when I come across merch of her. Mostly, though, I feel close to her during my training. Thinking of her gives me the drive to intensify my efforts and keep pushing forward.        Outdoors, I like to think that she's there by my side  amen to that     I stare at her photos all the time and i play Persona 3 a lot and speak with her in-game    Road trip across the coast of France and along southern Europe.   There's so much I could think of! Spending the day at the beach or a water park is pretty high up on my list though.   Wanting to do lewd things with your partner is a natural part of the relationship. As long as the two of you are fine with it, there shouldn't be any need to worry.   I want to  2lewd4u  her in the  censored.    Lift her up as we hug eachother, and give her a peck on the cheek.   She'd love to visit America sometime, but she's a little concerned about flying.   Depends on the circumstances.   I did a pretty intense workout with her the other day.  No, not that kind of workout.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893   A wonderful little pile of love!    Going out jogging, exercising, looking at pictures of her, and the daki.                               I think it would be her greeting me first. She would hug and kiss me. Then I would probably go rest somewhere with her so we could talk about our day and maybe plan how we will spend the rest of the day.   Any warm, nice place where we could spend lot's of time outside, I guess.   Nothing more than usual things, like listening to her songs, cuddling and talking to her in bed etc.    How do you guys feel 'close' to her  Well, the closest I feel to her is when I cuddle and talk to her daki while pretending its her, daydreaming while being high and fantasizing about having sex with her during masturbation.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  The girl that made me feel thing I've never felt before.                 Hug, kiss, even more kissing.   I think she'd really enjoy just relaxing on the beach.   Trying to stay happy.   Wake up to her, think about her during the day, go to sleep looking at her and other things.             Fate a cute.    I'd like that as well.  Getting more pics. So many pages to go.  Her fig stands to the side of the monitor, always watching. That's as close as it can be, I think. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127120893  Love in its purest, undistilled form. Not for the faint of heart.           Keep up a steady work rate. No real days off with internship and job but I'm working harder for her!   Kissing her daily.   I'm looking forward to it! Just where could we talk, though?          Thank you, she is.    No, not really. I don't think she's ever shown anything like that.   Yui Horie has a really cute and wonderful voice. I'd imagine she's pretty popular.   Severely creeped out and feel very odd at first, but if she's 100% girl now by whatever reasons, I don't think I'd have really much to say. If she's 100% the same as she is now even after, then it's just a short awkward while of strange.   Some cute doujins I'd imagine, robot fanworks,  Erotic Butler BL doujins perhaps    Anime, videogames, questing and work. A lot more things, too.   Severely doubt it.    1boy 1girl cum cum_on_body cum_on_breasts cum_on_clothes cum_on_hair cum_on_lower_body cum_on_upper_body cumdrip facial cum_in_mouth cum_in_pussy lingerie sex happy_sex missionary_position doggystyle cowgirl reverse_cowgirl thighhighs                       Super lewd all night    I'd give her some hugs and kisses, then I'd just sit down in the couch or chair and laze around for a while.   Not much, apart from trying to lose some weight, at least ease into something.   Daki.                               I love Ai so so much!    I don't know, but if she doesn't, teaching her how to use computers and maybe even program sounds really fun.   A quiet, but fierce determination when it comes to doing things, whether it be academic or recreational. I have to admit though, that she is better at actually getting started than I am.    She is pretty popular, but I don't really pay attention to her. I thought it was funny that she had to have a conversation with herself while working on Cross Ange on more than one occasion.    Money is no object  Space. I'd love to see the stars with her, but up close, which is something I could only manage if I had near unlimited resources. That or Cancun.   Help her improve her swim times, learn something together such as a dance, language or other skill. I'd like to do some unorthodox things that might be fun too like urban exploration. Really, I'd love to do quite a few things with her.    This sums it up quite nicely: http://pastebin.com/Z5v70Z19l    I'd hug her from behind and stay like that for a while, then I'd kiss her and tell her I love her.    I don't do it intentionally like "Oh I need to think about Ai today", but every so often I'll get this really bubbly feeling of being in love and do something as an outlet for that: drawing, writing, listen to romantic songs, some of them sad, and they remind me of her.  Especially the songs it's something I find myself doing a lot lately. Man, if I close my eyes and lip sync while pretending I'm singing to her, I feel like my chest is going to burst from emotion and I feel like crying    OHHH MYY LOVEEEE, MY DARLIIING                                 this pastebin has been deleted  Fuck you too Pastebin. Good thing I saved it. Giving it another shot:  http://pastebin.com/CamHEYG7      Yeah, good thing you saved it.    We don't share many traits but we're a good match and complement each other.   He does. Judging by some official pictures, a lot of plush animals, cute pajamas and sweets are involved. I'm sure they have a lot of fun together.   I want to kiss Makoto on the nape.   He looks like a perfect mix of his parents.   Pets, tickets for amusement parks/zoos/aquariums and my love.   I'd honestly let Makoto decide. I trust him to be reasonable enough and he loves children so I want him to be happy.   Not only the chest but his whole body actually. Makoto popped a shirt button off his shirt because he's so well endowed and got really embarrassed about it, it was so adorable.   His VA does an incredible job with Makoto's sweet, gentle and warm voice, I love it. I think his VA is semi popular but I'm not that knowledgeable about seiyuu.   I wouldn't care. I love Makoto the way he is now.   Makoto wouldn't read lewd stuff so light-hearted non-H works only if anything.   Travel to various places around the world.   We'd pet cats, play vidya, cuddle and eat sweets together.   No, Makoto is purer than fresh snow.  I'll teach him though.    Let him sit on my face and please him orally in various places.   Hug and a kiss on the foreahead, cheek and mouth in this order while caressing his back.   Makoto would love beautiful landscapes and impressive places so I'd do a tour around the world with him.   Look at pictures, imagine various scenarios to please him and hug my Makoto pillow. Post a picture of your waifu when she was young.                                                     Pretty competent with machines. Her phone above all things is pretty advanced considering it's a phablet and bluetooth at the same time.  You can say she fixed my heart, if that counts.  Even if it upsets people on a personal level, we will do what is right.  Doesn't care.  Satomi isn't that popular. That said, she was definitely a contributor in getting me to really notice what I had been missing in my life. She truly brought Kuroko to life in the adaptations, and I respect her greatly.  I would not be surprised.  Lewd thinking is pretty natural when it's for the one you love. Thanks, brain.  The merch search is never over.   how  Exactly what you said, and daki in the morning, or when I go to sleep.                     She's pretty well inclined. She never had one of her own, due to growing up in an orphanage, but she's interested. She hasn't repaired anything for me, no.  Several things, actually. We're both shy, have problems with self esteem and self worth, and both have a stutter. My problems aren't nearly as bad as hers.  She spends a lot of time with her friend Lilly, but no mention of a sleepover.  We don't see her parents, seeing as how they died when she was young.  Something small and heartfelt. She never liked her birthday much, but I'd use the day to tell her how much she really means to me and how much I love her.  A little while. I don't think we would rush into it, but we wouldn't wait too long.  No, she's much more self-conscious about other things.  She doesn't have one.  If she isn't anymore, I don't see the problem. I fell in love with her as she is now, and I wouldn't stop loving her.  Unknown. She loves reading books, though.  Somewhere quiet and peaceful. I think a trip into nature somewhere would be lovely.  Watch movies, play vidya, cuddle.  Give her a big hug and kiss, and tell her how much I missed her.  Someplace where your troubles could just melt away, and you could be on your own.  I think about her every day, and always keep her close to my heart.                                Wasn't there an IRC or a Steam group? I'm unsure.    We can make an IRC channel for just us if you wanna talk one-on-one.    Does your waifu have a blood sister?  Can she defeat gojira?      They never died: they just faded away.     How technologically inclined is your waifu?   Not much.  Does she need help using computers?  Maybe a little but she is the type who can learn fast.   Is she a leading pioneer in her field?   No way.  Yes, we share similar traits in personality, other than that not much.  Yes, in an ideal world she does. They play games like old maid, watch TV, eat snacks, tea and keki, talk about their lives, have pillow fights, etc.  I wish I knew, I soppused it's the same as Yuno. Her warmt comes from her parents.  To be happy.   wait until you get financially stable and had house  Pretty much that.  Yes, she knows she's perfect and I love her.  I don't really care much about her. But she's pretty popular.  Panic!  Something happy and cute, like Life of Maid.  Italy, go everywhere. I want to go there and I'm pretty sure she would also love it.  I would do my hobbies together with her and we'd travel a lot.   Fendom, all the way.    Hello, honey. How was your day?  Kiss, hug and massage. Easy.  Italy. Ari ari---  Bought figures of her.  Merch.                                           Miku would be the closest thing to one, though the fanbase feels that they are closer than blood sisters.   And suddenly I remember a song from the second Project Diva game where your chosen character can grow kaiju size and fight a Gojira expy. She could probably handle the King of the Monsters quite fine, though I doubt her chances against the likes of Destroyah.       There's still an IRC channel.     She'll do better than jet jaguar. How would she handle Orga?      A bit bulky, but nothing to worry about; especially if she has momentum on her side. Should be interesting to see her take on Biollante, though; I mean, all those vines...       i posted it in the spook zone for you two live bards    theres  a few            She lives in a medieval fantasy world, so she doesn't know anything about modern technology  she used to have problems i also used to have and both of us have a bad temperament  nope  yes, her sister also has pink hair, and they mention that maybe she is going to look more like her sister when she grows up  i really don't know what would be a good gift,she can have everything she wants because she is from a noble family,maybe i would invite her to a very special place on a date    she is 16 and im 18 having a child wouldn't be a good idea right now i think we would wait a few years , at least until she is 21   yes  i don't know how popular rie is but i like her  if the money isn't a problem i would take her to a private island where we could have fun together  i would love to travel alnd explore the world with her, also watching movies and cuddling would be nice  giving her a huge hug every day and a kiss  somewhere were we could be toghether without having to deal with anyone else, just a nice place for the 2 of us                           Bulky in all the right places, am I right?     She can use pretty much anything than the average japanese girl can use.  We both are responsible and mature.  She had some sleepovers with her friends.  Not possible to know.  Sweets and musical stuff.  Wait untill she's prepared for children.  She knows what she has.  I do like her a lot and she's popular enough to remember her name.  No.  A different city where I have family. We can live in their house and only spend the necessary money.  The usual I guess, hug and kiss. I'm not very imaginative for these things.  A trip around Europe or a second trip to Britain I guess. Maybe going to a big music festival.  Not much, I like to rewatch especific scenes from her series.  Daydreaming and listening to her songs.                              Thanks mister.   We can go to that one.   But it will have to wait a bit, I must go out. Will be back in 3 hours or so.          Amen to that.     She doesn't really use technology a lot. She's not really mechanical either.   Aside from introversion and  deep love , not too much now that I think about it.   Aside from sharing the occasional hotel room, no.   She resembles her mother a lot, especially with the eyes. They share some personality traits too, but her mother is far more imposing and generally kind of intimidating.   I buy her flowers every year.   Having children is important to her, and while deep down I love the idea, I'm also terrified by it. I'm so scared of being a bad father, not being able to handle the responsibility and not being able to provide to my family. I think it's one of my deepest fears.   She's confident in them and likes them as they are.   Kugimiya Rie does a lot of tsundere roles. I like her voice (especially character songs), but I typically don't like the characters she's associated with.   That's no longer here and now.   No, but she'd probably like  vanilla .   A winter vacation to the Swiss countryside.   Just spending quiet time together in a secluded place, a special place for only us.   I just want to make her happy...  Maybe kiss her shoulders or tummy...    I walk home from work, so I'm usually quite sweaty and gross when I get home. I'd greet my darling, but I'd have to shower before I could give her a hug proper.   I bought the last volume of her manga.   :&lt;    I keep her keychain on my backpack, listen to her character albums,  hold her figure's hand  before I go to bed, and sleep with a homemade plushie of her.                                                  Yeah, a ton. The most obvious thing is that we both play the drums.   Sometimes. Pretty normal stuff.   I think she does resemble her brother, but I'm not sure if she really does or if it's just because of the art style and confirmation bias.   Very long. We'd both want to pursue our musical careers for the time being, and having to compromise between that and spending time with your children isn't the best thing ever.   Somewhat, but it doesn't seem to be a major problem for her.   Yes, no idea how popular she is.   I'd let her choose if she really wanted to go somewhere. I don't really like traveling all that much myself.   Play board games, play vidya, play music, drink tea, watch anime.   She's not very experienced.   Depends on the day, obviously I wouldn't want to do the same thing over and over again.                              I love my  scary  light cruiser!   The one-on-one or the one mentioned in ghost?   Do you have any merch of you're waifu? If there isn't any, what kind of stuff would you like?   I thanked her. Pic related.   I think I just feel very close to her pretty much automatically.   I have a bootleg daki. I'd like to have tons of stuff, but I'm not actually planning on buying anything for the time being.          I doubt my husbando has even one tech-savvy bone in his body. That's okay though, I'm always willing to help.    A lot, (un)surprisingly. We both have trust issues. Social anxiety. A perception of not being worth other people's time. So on and so forth. The biggest difference there is that he's affected by these things much more than I am.   Nope. Probably just watch movies, chit-chat? I don't think he'd care for the typical teenage girly-girl sleepover stuff.    I want to kiss my husbando's wrists.   There's no mistaking him for his mother, but they aren't completely dissimilar either.    A cake and some new clothes. And something sweet and sentimental, of course. Like a custom-framed photo of us together, that'd be nice.    A birthday party! Something tells me that he's never been thrown one, which makes me very sad.  Sadly, I could most likely say the same for Crona. But hey, a first-ever birthday party is a good gift in and of itself.    Only about how skinny he is. An understandable concern, even if I think he's just fine already.   Maaya is pretty good, and she's got a sizable list of roles too.    "Kay, cool. Now where were we?" Let me go ahead and re-state once again that I don't see his ambiguous gender as an issue. If he was something other than what he is now, that's fine too.   Ha, no. But the thought of him getting curious and consulting Google one day, only to get extremely flustered at the results, is rather cute.                                   I have her figure  which I got at 300% its original price.  It's a good figure but I wish it was less popular.       She doesn't have any. I'd just like a figure, honestly.   I just realized this picture would've been perfect for my last post. Technological inclination, and all. Hindsight is always 20/20, right?   Anything! As long as we're enjoying each other's company, it'll do. But if I have to choose, cuddling on the couch and watching tv sounds most appealing at the moment.    The answer depends on whether or not  he's ever touched himself  ;^)    Holding hands  and  locking eyes  and  kissing  while  making sweet, tender, love.   Also, seconding the anon who mentioned omo. God, I have so many fantasies related to that. I'm so gross ;_;    I'd give him a big hug, a peck on the cheek, and ask him how his day's been. /My/ day doesn't matter too much when I can come home to his smiling, lightly blushing face!   I don't think he's the vacationing type, though admittedly that may just be me projecting a little. But if anything, he'd like somewhere quiet and lesser-populated.   I've been trying to get back into drawing him, if it counts. Writing a bit too. Just the usual stuff, I guess.   Looking at pictures and rewatching his scenes, mostly. Sometimes I get random cutesy ideas in my head, and they give me that nice feeling of closeness too.   Just the  cards . I'd really like something more substantial, more tangible. A prize fig, keychain strap, anything.                           Nothing special these days, planning a fourth rewatch of her series.   Listening to her songs, watching pictures of her, constant daydreaming, posting in these threads...   Still alive, Spaniard ?   I don't have any merch of her yet. I know that love isn't measured by the amount of stuff you have, but I still feel bad for owning nothing.             My waifu is the sexiest.   My waifu is the prettiest!    The only thing I have right now is a little nendo petit. I would love a larger figure whether it's a full nendo or something with more realistic proportions, but I'm also hoping for little trinkets like keychains. Other girls in her series have gotten them, so I'm hoping it's only a matter of time.    Not really, at least nothing conscious. Most of these things come naturally.   While there's quite a bit, a large percentage of that is cheap stuff like clear files, stickers and such, which aren't really worth getting in my eyes. As for the rest, it's safe to say that I own most of the quality stuff there is.  Although I'd love to see a proper non-prize scale figurine, or at least one where my Yunocchi isn't in a swimsuit or her school uniform.    Nothing out of the ordinary. Just normal couple stuffs.   My waifu is the cutest!              I want my waifu to pole dance and strip for me.   Something I forgot to mention in my last post, I did a colour edit of some art I have of her. Looks a lot more accurate than the original.   Two scale figures, three plushies, four mini figures and a poster.  Also two keychains and another mini figure on the way as I speak.   Would you're waifu rather do a dangerous job for a lot of money, or a very safe job for little pay?          three plushies  Massively jelly.      Still alive, Spaniard ?  More or less     They are pretty darn adorable.    A couple of figures, two posters. Mousepad and a mousemat. Still a ton of merchandise I'm looking to acquire, though.    I think she's fairly competent when it comes to technology. I guess her field would be Ratings Games if I had to pick one out specifically, and she isn't at the forefront of that unfortunately. Maybe in the future though.  Has your waifu repaired anything for you?   My heart.    An interest in reading and the supernatural is something we both share.   When she was younger I think she used to sleep together with her best friend. Not sure what they did together though.   Incredibly so. She gets the majority of her looks from her mother but with her father's crimson hair. She and her mother look so alike they could be mistaken for sisters.   Financially stable at the very least. It's difficult for Devils to conceive so unless we were incredibly lucky on the first try it'd take a while for it to happen no matter what.   Nope. She's perfectly happy with the body she has and is proud of it.   Yoko Hikasa is very talented and I'd say pretty popular. I like her, she does good work.   If she read any I think they'd be non-H comedy stuff of series she liked. She's not really the type to read doujins though.   If money was of no concern, traveling the entire world and experiencing all the sights and things each place has to offer.   It's a bit private but  planning out our anniversary, which is tomorrow. Mostly involving baked goods, roses, and just being as close to her as I possibly can. I wish I could do more.                                  Can do.  His dress/robe from back then reminds me of a flower of some sort. Can't put my finger on which one though.    He did a dangerous 'job' for what I imagine was a very pitiful allowance. That 'job', of course, was his life under Medusa (not to mention other hazardous situations he's found himself in  for free ), but I digress. All things considered, I'm almost inclined to say either is equally likely.       I wish my waifu had a plushie.    A small collection. Two plushes, a nendoroid, a couple of keychains, two games, and an artbook. Always eager to add more.  Definitely the latter. Not to say that she isn't capable of handling the former.      To think I did most of this damage before even considering going to Japan is still cool to me, and I have stuff on the way, too.  http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/BDKBMW</wbr>   Why this has never come up in my mind is beyond me.  I would imagine dangerous for money, as Judgments field work has proven to be more dangerous than Antiskills.   second spoiler   Happy early anniversary!            She doesn't have much in the way of merchandise; I guess by thinking of her and looking at pictures of her.  I have a phone strap of her. It's the only merchandise of her in existence. I wish that she had a figurine.  Depends on the nature of the job I suppose. She's willing to put her life on the line for a good cause (e.g. protecting others), so she would be willing to do a dangerous job if it helped others.        Yes, pic related. Also I have Project Diva f 2nd and I've preorded http://www.goodsmile.info/en/produc<wbr>t/4878/Hatsune+Miku+V3.html   Safe job. She rather wouldn't like to risk to much.   You can commission one or just make it yourself. I think I've seen some waifufag who had commissioned plushie.      </wbr>    W-What happened ?    All these people with all this cool merch  Damn I'm so jealous   Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  The 80's were a different time  Because Araki likes to spice things up every now and a gain   Because your gender prejudice is too strong.      But Part 5 was serialized between '95 and '99.   Forget looking like girls, almost everyone has that same fucking face and build.  Fuck Araki, he sold his drawing talent in exchange for eternal youth.    I think he means the chronology   Early part 5 is arguably the worst art   really the biggest art change happened in Part 4    But mid part 4 was arguably the best    It's set in the 2000s    The worst is fucking 6. I cant believe this isn't general consensus.     There is literally no one in that image that I don't want to fuck in the vagina, wtf?!    To be fair that's entirely possible - he'd been trying to go with a female main protagonist since part 2 but his editors kept cockblocking him so he went "fuck it!" and just made them all reverse traps.  That and part 5 marked the point when he seemed to go more towards fashion models as body shape inspiration.            well, late 4 and early 5.     How is Bruno even standing like this? Are his feet glued to the ground?     this is why I need feminism.      But mid part 4 was arguably the best  that doesn't mean that the art didn't change.     I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  I want to ravage Narancia's boy pussy   I dunno.     Heyzeus's legs help him     I don't think the early 4 panel is representative.    Narcinia is best girl    Late 6 looks like shit, especially Jolyne that looks like a tranny.    The other thread got deleted it seems and there was some decent discussion in it too. Just don't name threads "edition" or "general" anymore, hopefully that will take the heat off.       sounds like the work of a moderator's stand     Are mods really deleting JoJo generals? Fucking finally.   A crack down on generals would severely increase the quality of the board.       What is 「GRAVITY」? Green baby don't hurt me     I thought they were purging them because there are usually multiple up at a time.   While the threads were fun there's nothing to talk about until JJL chapters/EoH trailer/general announcements of a Jojo nature. If jojofags really need a thread at the most have one weekly.  Why didn't Kira just use Sheer Heart Attack in the mansion instead on relying on slow ass air bubbles?   The one holding the knife is actually a girl... right?    A new chapter did just come out and we've actually had some unusually in-depth discussion about it over the last few days despite not even having a text translation yet. I understand why they'd want to get rid of generals but I think it's a real shame it happens just when all the cancer DIO's World brought in is finally clearing up.   That're some manly girls.   /ag/ when?    Nope    Because Araki just forgot.    Apparently the /a/ sings Jojo is going to be starting soon, someone said last thread that Jebus was going to pick it up. We should just stick to those threads.     Never.     Late part 7 is my favourite.    /r/ing an edit with them in the Gangstars' outfits and/or faces.    Early Part 3 was the best.     Because he knew they were aware of how it worked and he can only use one type of bomb at the time.     But Josuke couldn't do anything against it anyway,only Koichi could.   Araki got tired of drawing manly homos so he switched to twink homos.    He could divert it long enough to punch barrage Kira to death if he set something on fire.     Josuke could just punch it and it'd go back to Kira as his hand.    Early and Mid Part 7 was awesome, Araki started to suffer from his sameface syndrome around Late Part 7 and he has never stopped since then.    If he used Crazy Diamond's healing ability, it would go back to his left hand. Also, then he wouldn't be able to do anything offensively in that time period.    Actually at this point there's more variety than there was during either late 7 or the scratch nose era.   can anyone give me name of a music that is played during almost entire the world part from anime?   Darkness of the world i think.    Araki went through a David Bowie phase while writing part 5.     Araki had just learned to draw different faces around mid part 4 only to revert back to his sameface style in the next volume   Truly sad.  I think he hasn't found an equilibrium yet.        He got sick of people comparing his characters and artwork to Hokuto no Ken so instead of manly characters he went the opposite route and made them FABULOUS instead.    i love you     It's more like he didn't have to imitate HnK and buff 80's action stars once they went out of fashion and he became established enough to do his own thing when part 3 ended.     Didn't he lose it with his left hand?    It might just be my fetish for white hair talking, but I don't blame the Japs for liking Fugo as much as they do just because of his design.    I guess that worked out for him because that's what people prefer for him now, I mean fuck look at all the shit he's done since adapting that style.   NEWS ALERT-Actual Discussion approaching  http://jjlscans.tumblr.com/post/122<wbr>355928463/jojolion-44-delay   This month’s chapter is taking awhile because the store is slow to stock this issue and our Day 1 contact is hard to get in touch with this week.    Expect the chapter sometime really soon    Edited for brevity.       </wbr>     Fuck you.    No fuck you leatherman!    I liked the muscle bound style before part 4. Then everyone including Jotaro and Polnareff turned into fruit boys. There's manly fabulous and then there's faggot fabulous.    Both are acceptable as long as the source material is enjoyable. Like LotGH for example. Full of fruit boys, but still a great piece of work.     Early part 1 will always be objectively the worst.      it took me a while but damn.  J♂J♂     How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        I need the pastebin guys    I totally agree with you, Mid Part 4 is beautiful.     calling Jotaro JoJo     In terms of story and characters the first 3 parts were the best, series went to shit after he was forced to make it more mainstream     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     DIO's♂DARK♂FANTASY    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     Jotaro could move for 2 seconds within DIO's time stop   DIO can stop time for 9 seconds (as High DIO)   Jotaro stops time at the 9 second mark   DIO can move for two more seconds (now 11 seconds)   DIO can't move anymore         The youngest JoJo is the relevant JoJo     Implying   tfw Araki will never ever make women as beautiful as in Phantom Blood.      DIO seemingly crushed Jotaro to death before the 11 second mark    Because Araki is a massive faglord, but a cool faglord.    Those are 12 year olds.    I know. It's ridiculous but you just have to go with it. Araki is known for drawing things happening and then having a character say it didn't happen.  Wheel of Fortune burning Jotaro for example and then just saying it was his coat.       not colouring the painting on the wall  lazy colour job      Implying  He started excelling with females at part 4     I love how Araki used to draw women, even before Jojo. Gorgeous Irene is really  gorgeous.     The anatomy's kind of crap but the faces are truly gorgeous. So expressive.      So since they found it necessary to notify us this time I'm assuming we might not even get it this month.  Shit happens and all that and I do appreciate that we get scanlations at all, but I just really want to discuss Karera and Josefumi with you guys.      Looks like early part 1.     Fugo is not blonde  Welp.     Nobody here know enough japanese to translate it?    Yeah, Gorgeous Irene is really wild.    They said to expect it really soon, I don't think that there's anything strange about them giving us an explanation for being a few days late.    It is.    I like it, looks original. I do like Part 8 art a lot but, the sameface is kind of annoying sometimes.     Can someone explain what they're even wearing?    Clothes.   Reach for the stars UFO-kun    SOL series about fagotts doing fagott things never    Flute train coming through   Yuru Yuri?     Spin-off having the Double reed section as the main cast never  Why are you wasting such godly designs KyoAni?     Why, because she didn't stupidly let her daughters waste time and money in something that wasn't going to earn them a living when they get older? I mean, let's be real, Even through Kumiko is good, she's not professional level good, even through in the novels she wins nationals with her band and gets a man, that's not as good as a education.   ZR vs Tights       Spoiler that shit next time anon, that is too lewd.       We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     I was about to make the thread. I'm looking forward to it too. Chapter 5 hopefully will be good.    It does sound good but it's sad this could be the last summary thread   Good news, the translator is going to translate volume because the summary isn't that detailed this time. I guess that's the end for this drama.   You know, that pisses me off. It's a childlish behavior. But well, I don't wanna cause any more trouble than there is now.    I know but at least we are getting a translation and considering he is the only translator working in DAL we are lucky.    Well I can understand why. Too detailed kind of kills your motivation due to it being pretty much already done. It's why we asked the guy summarizing this to keep it concise. The only part I want in real detail anyways is the Mana section.    but a summary it's no the same as a fully translated novel. Summary anon summaries are good but they still lack some details    and we still need a translator for the short stories.   Waiting.   Gotta day, Kotori's date was great. Yoshino and Natsumi's date are a close second best. Other dates were alright. My least favorite is Miku so far though.     I thought it was better than twin, she actually behaved somewhat normal and didn't go gull retard over Shiori as usual.    Free translations are a bit like the game cracking scene. It's not entirely about providing a service or making a statement, it's about being the first person to do something. Threatening not to translate over too-complete summaries (among other things) is a way of staking a claim.   time for action   Why not translate something else then? Like side stories.    We still have to wait for summary anon  retard     Could be lack of access, but more likely it's lack of interest. If there's other stuff a free translator would rather share, they'll work on that. It's not like they're getting paid.    There is another translator in that forum but he only translates side stories about Kurumi.    I'm ready for the Tohko bullying   OVA any day now.   After season 3.   Yoshino and Kotori dates are the best so far, Miku and the twins dates were weak, Natsumi date was alright.   I don't mind yuri rapist, I rather like that sort of thing. Main issue I always have with Miku is the lack of connection to Shidou. Their interactions rarely click together.    Well that's the problem, the twins who are supposed to be closer to Shidou especially Yuzuru didn't interact with Shidou at all whereas Miku did a decent job.    2 threads  fug, which one    This one has more replies and no waifu wars so far.     no Origami     Fuck, forgot about her. Origami date was also good and her interaction with her other self was interesting.    Still dreaming, anon. It's better than expecting nothing.    Wasn't that the joke? They assumed that their way of attracting Shido had to involve one another when it did not. It wound up being Shido's kink, though.   I can't believe how ass season 2 looked. Especially now that I'm looking at the LN art. Jesus christ   No, they just misunderstood what Reine said.    LEARN TO USE THE CATALOG YOU FUCKING NEWFAG      <br/>          and you realized that just now? You don't even have to read novels for that, just compare S2 art to S1.    Origami is the best date by far anon.  No, Kotori is the worst next to Miku  We need more tohko raep         linking to your dead thread  We are actually discussing stuff in this one.      waifu wars   you fucked that m8       discussing stuff    Posting without even reading the LN   KEK, fuck off secondary also get reported.       Holy shit anon, you are slow.     Waifu war bait topic  Even if I would agree with it, that is a bad topic.     Sorry, we thought it was a bait thread for our sake    or it still is?       Just ignore the shitposter guys      Samefagging OP trying to save his secondary thread.       "no"    That's what I mean. They assumed "ice cream kiss" meant to appeal via twincest power. They were wrong, but they were right at the same time.    You better be trolling. Top 3 dates are Kotori, Yoshino, and Origami. The order doesn't matter so long as they are in the top 3.     samefagging  Look at the posting times and stop shitposting     You're trying too hard and your butthurt is showing because people like this thread over yours.    but that wasn't the point. They were supposed to interact with Shidou like the other girls did.   DAILY REMINDER ELLEN IS A CHEAP WHORE WHO GET BUCKETS OF WESCOTT SEMEN ON HER WOMB EVERY DAY.  So out of curiosity, what do people think the last two Spirits are going to be like? Personality/powers.    Kotori is the worst next to Miku  What? Why? It was short yeah but she showed good chemistry with Shidou     Here we go again, shitpost thread.    Strictly speaking, they're supposed to get him excited. The other girls are using date tactics (except Origami, lol drugs) while Yamai went straight for the dick.   Reminder to ignore the bait posters.    Same 12 IP's   Samefagging with the same IP number trying to save this shit too hard      Hoping the new Spirit from the upcoming movie will be canon and make it to the main story in the LN. She's too much of a seemingly kuudere loli qt to pass up.    This    Just ignore him    Now the thread is shit, thanks to OP who doesn't even read the LN.    by interacting with him. I don't know why you think it was a just when it's clear they just misunderstood everything and Yoshino is the one who was straight for dick.    I thought it was maybe the best, it was the only one who "won" by following her strategy from the start to the end and wasn't help by hazard and luck.   Natsumi was the funniest and cutest after that.      She isn't canon m8.    Now you can't prove that    Phantom = Rinne, Mio = who knows    Check the main cast in the official site, Natsumi is nowhere to be found and this Mayuri girl didn't appear in her arc.    Nah, Shido even agrees that he's already in a state where kisses would seal him. The challenge he made is for the girls to excite him, he never specified how, so long as it's exciting. That's why Origami succeeded by drugging herself and being honest, and why Natsumi could succeed via wardrobe malfunction.  Yoshino wasn't even aiming for a win via eros, she just prepared to have her swimsuit stripped off.    the only one who "won" by following her strategy from the start to the end  This is a good point. Miku had it together, smart girl.          Her name doesn't fit in the main plot.         Samefagging talking to himself   12 same IP    66 post of the same person           but both Origami and Natsumi still interated with Shidou, see the difference? The twins dates was bad because Shidou got excited by just looking at them and that was all, at least Miku was prepared. It's like winning a contest by luck.    OP from the other thread being asspained enough to try to the ruin this thread by shitposting and calling everything samefag   Friendly advice. Ignore this guy.     Yoshino did the same and unlike the other girl she had a trump card.    Nice b8 m8, keep trying OP.    They ALL have won by luck, except Miku. Origami drugging Shido wouldn't have excited him in the same way her drugged honesty did. Natsumi losing her clothes made Shido excited more than her act did. And seeing the twins make out over ice cream... actually wait, they won when they offered to let him lick the melted cream off of their bodies, didn't they?    We're trying to ignore him outright.        That's what we are doing.      Now I am saddened. What a waste of god tier design.       god tier   just a mishmash of animal body parts   What good is that?       Not really, Yoshino had a plan and Reine did say Shidou's exitement was close to 90 then DEM attacked. Kotori managed to win Shidou with that one line.    Her spirit form is a clusterfuck of wings though.    She looks good in uniform, but I do think she looks retarded with all those wings.    She just looks generic without her AstralDress. More specifically, a bleached Kotori.    by that logic then almost every Tsunako must look generic.    Glad you pointed it out.    and Natsumi looks like a green haired Yoshino, this is not new with Tsunako designs.    Well, they all share the sameface after all.    Chapter 5: Spirits' Dance  - The flash of swords fight are seen in the sky. Ellen is using her high-powered laser blade &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; to block an attack from Mana's &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt;. Ellen used the opening after blocking Mana's attack. Mana quickly evaded and countered Ellen's attack before she could release her next one. - They have been continuing this exchange for a while. While Mana's &lt;Wolf's Tail&gt; that covered a real blade with Magic Power is not as powerful as Ellen's &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; which manifested the blade using Magic Power alone, but its lower Magic Power consumption allow Mana to better engage in a long battle.  - Since nobody in this world could match Ellen's Magic Power output, Mana decided to fight with Ellen with her techniques instead. Mana keep attacking Ellen without break. However, even now there is not a single wound on Ellen's body. - However Mana's objective since the beginning is not to defeat Ellen, but to buy some time until Kotori and others succeed in saving Shidou. - When Mana is thinking that she could buy enough time for them if she keep this pace, that moment, the &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s facility below her started illuminating and a ray of light is released to the sky. Mana feel a shock wave from her back.  "…What!?"  - Mana widen her eyes. Even though the shock wave did not blown her away thanks to Territory, her attention diverted to her back for a second. And spit moment is enough for Ellen to give her a fatal attack.   "You're full of openings." "Ku —"  - Mana blocked the attack but she couldn't completely cancel the power of it and got thrown to the ground. She quickly use her Territory as a buffer to absorb the impact. The ground is then wrapped like there is an invisible ball pushed onto it.  "Ku… you've done me. …But what was the earlier?"  - Mana said that and looked around her surroundings. She then choked at Shidou who is floating on the air, covered by the light of Spirit Power.                       It's time    Is he going to Kamehameha again?    Oh shit.    Alright here we go    Where the fuck is the Fraxinas? fighting those robot things? Also it's happening!     wrapped  warped?    Miku is worst girl   Please, plase!!!! Shidou, show some strenght now!    Welcum back    Fuck off.    Read the LN.    Being repaired, isn't it?    I hope, or even better a spirit bomb.    I guess Ellen is too strong even for Mana and where are the jobbers anyway?    but Reine said she and the crew are going to stop DEM attack I was expecting a comeback or something.    I don't want it to end    How about the SPECIAL BEAM CANNON?   okay I'm done now. How bad is Shido about to get wrecked?       He's going berserk so I doubt he will do the speam light beam, not even Ellen can stop him now.    I think you mean  how bad is Ellen's pussy about to get wrecked?      She said they had a plan for if DEM interfered, and it's Mana. Who was buying time for girls to suck their Spirit power out of Shido's mouth one by one.  Who instead came out to flirt with Ellen. Aggressively.      Oh well, maybe I expected too much from these guys but Mana is in danger now    Hopefully, Ellen is getting rekt this chapter.    Yeah, fuck ellen     It's pathetic how such a big organization as Ratatsokr only has one battleship.     It's an all-volunteer staff of perverts, there's no way they're going to have a magitek battleship fixed in a month.    Mana can't die, she is too important and must be saved.    I would imagine that it's also a chore to build such a large Realizer, let alone an airship to accommodate it.    Why not just get another ship? It seems like DEM has more than one but what about Ratatoskr.   I hope Ellen dies.   or maybe the lack resources and funds. DEM has an army of wizard and those robots while Ratatoskr only has Mana and the Fraxinas.     final boss   dying this early      Please tell me she isn't the final boss. that's pretty pathetic if so    DEM also has the AST but no one remembers them.    She isn't, I'm just saying she is the right hand of the final boss so I doubt she will die.    DEM is a large multinational corporation run by an eccentric evil genius. Ratatoskr is a secret organization with quarreling private backers. Huge difference in the relative available resources.     Westcott is the final boss or Phantom if it turns out she is actually evil.     Except Wescott isn't the only high ranked member in DEM and it doesn't look like he shares the same ideologies.    Good, doujins when?    I do.    No, but he is the highest ranking, and when his people get out of line he has the means to force them to follow him again.  Elliot has nowhere near as much control over his own people, and is more dependent on them, which is why they can make plans to attack Shido and he can't shut it down.       Probably never t.t     I thought Elliot was only one of the funders of Ratatoskr but not the main boss.    Could be, I assumed he was the founder/Chairman.    Rape doujins    I think it was also stated Ratatoskr has corrupt member as well in the first 4 volumes.   Kotori is a traitor   I hope next arc has more Mana    Is that Reason they thought a plan to kill Shidou knowing he is the only one who can seal spirit?    You're still forcing that?    She accepted the mission to kill Shidou, that's an act of treason to me.    "Nii-sama!?"  - Shidou then turned his eyes toward Mana. Shidou looked absent-minded, his conscious is vague, as if he has been drugged with something. Shidou then open his mouth while looking at Mana,  "Ah — Mana. *I'm glad. So you were fine.*"  - Shidou said that to her with a gentle voice. Mana knitted her eyebrows feeling something is off at what he just said. On the surface it sounds like Shidou is worrying about her body. - That is understandable, since at this very moment, Mana is still fighting with Ellen and got a serious blow from her just earlier. - However — for some reason, Mana thought that what Shidou said just now is not only that. Shidou then unconsciously continue his words,  "I was… worried about you. Ever since you've been kidnapped by those DEM guys… but I'm glad… I'm really glad…" "Kidnapped? Nii-sama, what do you mean?" "— Where… is *Mio*? Didn't she helped you out?" "What are you talking about, Nii-sa —"  - Mana stopped her words. Mana suddenly feel a pain in her head. She push her forehead with her hand and frown. She knew this is not just a headache. — The moment Shidou said "Mio" a scene she never seen before started flashing up in her head.  "T…This is…"  - Mana saw a scene in her head changing like a camera shutter. The park where she play with her friend. The teacher teaching in the class. Her birthday where Shidou celebrate for her.   And — the back of a girl with long hair.  "Ah…"  - The moment Mana saw that in her head, she feel her view is flashing on and off. For some reason, Mana couldn't remembered the girl's face. She knew she know her, but —                             - And that was when something interrupted her thought. Mana heard Ellen's voice from above her,  "— Lost in your thought in front of me? You underestimated me a bit too much."  - But that was already too late. Ellen already swing up her &lt;Caledvwlch&gt; next to Mana. Mana quickly tried to concentrate, but she can't make it in time. She prepared for the pain from Ellen's laser blade. - Before the laser blade could reach Mana, the Spirit Power that covered Shidou swelled up and stopped the Magic Power blade. Ellen make a dubious looks at stare at Shidou irritatedly.   "— Itsuka Shidou. Don't you looks wonderful now. Even though I don't know what happened, I can see why Ike is wanting you that much."  - Ellen lift up the tip of her lips. However, in contrast to her, Shidou only make a grim looks,  "D—E…M…!"  - Shidou started breathing heavily and howled like a beast.   "U — Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"  - The next moment, the Spirit Power that curled around Shidou increased its intensity and blown away both Ellen and Mana who were nearby.   "…!" "What!?"  - Mana used her Territory to absorb the impact and stopped mid-air. She raise up her voice,  "Nii-sama! What is this! And what was earlier — who is Mio-san!?"  - However, Shidou didn't replied back to her. He only continued growling like a beast. Even though Mana wanted to ask him more about it, the person confronting her right now is the world's strongest Wizard. She can't let down her guard even for a second. Mana grind her teeth and averted her eyes away from Shidou.                              Oh shit, he remembers?     Ellen getting rekt soon      Shiiiit      At least this confirms Mana does have a past.     BASAKA!     long hair  So Phantom's name is Mio, huh?     SHOCKING TRUTH    Prolly? it might be about something like the case when Origami during the world that what changed like, her memories on hating spirits appearing if she senses a spirit power. I guess in Shidou's case it triggers with DEM?.... There might be a case where we get a changing of the past that lead Shidou's memory and Mana's memory to be wiped out. Luckily Mana had that photo of her to remember Shidou.   I guess this Mio is phantom? or might not be.       Holy shit!      Fuck, now we have even more questions than before.      Different girls m8s. Phantom is free but this girl is captured.     That also works with the "this time I'll get shit right" stuff phantom was saying.     &gt;And — the back of a girl with long hair.    &gt;Nii-sama! What is this! And what was earlier — who is Mio-san!?"    Plot Detected. I repeat, Plot Detected!          Either Phantom or the second Spirit. If Mio was supposed to help Mana, it makes sense that they'd both have been captured.     Where did it say Mio was the captured spirit?     First Phantom and now this, are they the same or just a coincidence we can't see the faces?     That's "Rio" no "Mio"     The spoilers     The fact that they took the effort to point out the long hair thing both here and with Toobitchy makes me lean more towards Phantom.    Their names are not even similar and Rio is Shidou daugther in that game.    Yeah, it might be that she used zafkiel that time, thus the reason having a connection with Kurumi, and why Kurumi knows phantom. LEL I just thought of this. Mana wants Kurumi Kurumi wants Shidou Shidou wants Phantom some crazy love rectangle we have here.         WAIT REALLY?!   Could Mio be Shidou's  another little sister?      I know. I just wanted to post a Spirit with Long Hair.      So it seems that before Shidou was adopted by the Itsukas, Shidou and Mana had an encounter with DEM which ended up with Mana being captured and kidnapped and both knew a Mio who probably is a spirit means that Shidou and Mana probably both could use spirit power. At least the both of them are NOT normals.    He didn't remember anything in volume 7, it must be the the high fever and the spirits power going berserk breaking the memory wipe.     Maybe      implying phantom was free   implying phantom wasn't manipulating kurumi with projection powers to break her out of DEM's rape dungeon.      At least Shidou can but there is no implication that Mana can use spirit powers so far considering her condition.   it's that time of day again and remember kids  Kaguya a cutie     Oh. I'm the one who suggested it in the last thread, so I was thinking this was confirmation.   Wouldn't have had the sephira crystals then.       Phantom was also in the past and she has been turning girls into spirits.    Yeah. I was just pointing it out after he sealed Origami, after all he sealed Origami while inversed. It's the first time Shidou sealed a spirit inversed first. (What I meant was, the time he sealed inverse Tohka, that was the second time.) in Origami's case, it's the first time, and it was inversed, might be the reason why the spirit's power is wrecking havoc inside Shidou. Not to mention he sealed Tohka for the third time during the fight with Origami in her Angel form. I guess it has something to do with why the spirit's power is malfunctioning inside him.    No, she is  Shidou's real childhood friend     No, but if you think about it, Mana survived an operation that only shortened her life span to 10 years while Jessica had that same operation and would only live to see the next day. Mana is strange for a human since I see Jessica is more of a norm with this type of operation.     Mission given to her by the higher ups   to me  Glad the retardation starts and stops with you.       (What I meant was, the time he sealed inverse Tohka, that was the second time.)  What?     Jessica's operation was worse, Mana noticed this during their fight she was also using inferior equipment compared to Mana's but the magic energy inside Jessica allowed her to fight Mana in equal terms for a time.    Uhh. I think I explained it less? Sorry about that. First. Shidou met Tohka,(normal mode). She sealed Tohka (normal mode). Second. Tohka getting kidnapped, Tohka went inverse. Shidou sealed inverse Tohka.  Origami's case. Shidou met Origami as &lt;Angel&gt;. Failed to seal, even went inverse. -World Change Shidou met Origami. &lt;Devil&gt; manifested, sealed Origami while inversed.  ..Did I explained it less again? Sorry if I am not good at explaining what I had in mind.               That would be Kotori's nightmare.    Said mission was only if he got to the same point as inverse Origami. IE completely beserk with no way to regain his sanity. He wouldn't be Shidou any more at that point.    I understand but what does that have to do with Shidou losing control over his powers? This was going to happen sooner or later and Ratatoskr knew it.    Sighs*************** Shidou can't seal inverse types... what he has to do is return them back to being normal. The kiss with Tohka is te one which made her come back. In Oriagmi's case, she came back by herself and then Shidou kissed her to seal her powers.   If Mio is Phantom then who the fuck is Material A?   Wait an d see     Sighs***************  Fuck off     That's just a speculation. I think Mio is most likely &lt;Material A&gt; leaving phantom's identity unknown. I think that fits better.     Sighs***************  Faggot.  What Shidou did in both Origami and Tohka cases was trying to get their old personalities back because the kiss doesn't work if the girls is not compatible with Shidou.       It was already established that Kotori's nightmare is Shidou as a full female. Why do you think that she literally went all white eyed when she groped Shiori's breasts and found them to be real?    It's just a dumb speculation, It's clearly stated Mio was captured yet Phantom is free and turning girls into spirits.    And people claim that summer isn't real *facepalm*    What the fuck is wrong with you?    You can have more than one fear anon.    That's what I was implying lol! "Return them back to being normal", how did you translate that?   Miku is worst girl   It's gonna happen sooner or later, I just thought that it might be the reason for it happening. I didn't say it wouldn't happen. I just thought it's the reason why it happened.    Given her locket it was after he was adopted for at least a year.    that Shidou can't seal inverse spirit when he can, the only thing he has to do is to free the girls from the dark energy control or despair in Origami's case. The dark energy doesn't disappear just like that.    True, but that one I described there would be her biggest one. The only other nightmare would be to actually have to kill Shidou.   Anyone remembered that bit about Shidou was in despair the first year he is taken into Itsuka family in volume 1? What if it connects with all these Mio stuff somehow?  They got their personalities back, but they were still as inverse powers, and it's just my speculations, and do remind me cuz I don't know which part they said that Shidou can't seal inverse types.  Cuz if I remember correctly when Tohka was on inverse and she saw Shidou falling to her, she became conscious and she's still wearing that inverse astral dress. There wasn't a point where I remember that it was stated her inverse astral dress grew back to her normal one.     I doubt that's reason, Kotori and the fraxinas were surprised back then in volume 7 when Tohka turned inverse. I suppose they didn't expect to deal with dark spirits.    Alright, understood. But there's no need to insult me. (I say it to the others)    He also was abandoned and separated from Mana.    You're really not from here aren't you?     Rio better be canon or else I'll be upset.     literally who cares though     Yeah, I guess his despair would be about Mana's kidnapping and whatever happened to Mio and that he was powerless to do anything about it.     yeah I guess, they weren't expecting to deal with inverse types.   I can pinpoint the moment a thread will turn to shit, am I a wizard /a/?   Rinne    No, why?    Well, his mind was wiped right after he saw his sister kidnapped and lost his childhood friend, and then he was left behind with the Itsukas.  He probably doesn't remember most of the reason he was sad.  That said I will die laughing if he knew Tohka before.       Yeah, I'm a newbie just been here for 7-8 days. I was the one who made the thread of yesterday and everybody was arguing that I made it too early. I learned my lesson.    and what if Shidou ends up getting all his memories back and decides to spend time with Mana?    Wasn't Tohka confirmed yonger than 1 year?     lol  Literally kill yourself.     Actually I fucked up, thing aren't going well, disregard my post. I hold on the next time.    Nope, you are right. The sword and inverse dress only disappeared after Shidou kissed Tohka in volume 7.    Go fuck yourself. And stay in that shithole where you're from.    Tohka knows nothing of herself except that she suddenly existed. and when she existed the AST attacked her. iirc.    Databook stuff? Because her mind is completely empty of prior knowledge.    What do you mean? I don't see any shitposting in this conversation.    Oh that thread worked out fine though  There's no arbitrary rules about threads. Sometimes they just will be dead and no one posts depending on hours.      I do.    Are you a girl?    Kotori doesn't mind that too much, so long as he spends time with her as well. Mana already treats Kotori as the youngest sibling of the 3(though the reason for that is kinda funny).     woah, you guys sure are edgy and hardcore XD      Toha didn't know about the workd iirc, even Yoshino was familiar with it.     Do you think I'm from Animetsuki, saw the discussion yesterday thruthfully speaking, didn't even know there was a website like that. Alright, not gonna argue with you. I'm leaving already.    Because her chest is bigger, right? but I what I meant is what if Shidou changes after getting her memories and spends more time with Mana than the girls.    Retard    Oh, I see. Well all of what I'm saying is just what a speculation. Unless we really know it from the author, I don't have any right to say it's accuracy.    Because the only thing she remembers about herself is she just came into existence randomly. Every time she appeared there was a spacequake and the AST attacked her. That was her life    world**   Flatori a shit   Mana's locket says otherwise. The Shidou in the picture is 10 he was adopted when he was younger then 9.     Are you a girl?     I wanted to write "thread is going well" but since I have the sun reflexion on my screen I didn't saw shit and didn't correct my sentence.  I'm pretty much the one shitposting now so I will keep quiet for the rest of the thread.    Please guys, avoid getting mad over trivial things and keep discussing the summary.   Yup, you hit the nail on that one. Shidou would most likely split his time evenly with all of the girls though he might insist on Mana staying at the Itsuka house though.  At least in this volume Kotori got to experience not being flat for once, though it was in the form of Shiori to do so.      Was he that age for sure? I thought the locket pic was taken the same year, and then the tragedy happened, and there really isn't much difference between looking nine and looking ten.    What about Mana's picture?     It's very relevant stuff dude.     Kotori said by that time Shidou was already in the Itsuka house.    That's nice wallpaper.    Time travel and the Kaleidostick.  I'd forgotten that.    Needs more Miku pure love    This confirms Shidou and the boy in the picture are the same but doesn't explain why he was with Mana and Kotori.     Wasn't it the same for Yoshino?   Kaguya a cutie  Does Da'at have an inverse form?      namefag  You are getting more autistic. I guess I shouldn't be surprised considering Kaguya is also autistic.     YUZURU is better   Miku is worst girl    Holy shit! I want to know how this is gonna turn out.      Can someone post DAL angel tree?     This anon knows.

Where is Mana living in this timeline?   she still a cutie  When is Shidou going inverse?   Not a spirit    I don't think he can    Play the second game.    Which one? I have so many versions just in case.     Nope.       Retarded slut    Are you sure? Even if he is only half spirit, something should happen if he feels despair while having all that power.    - In the party hall where it is now destroyed by the light of Spirit Power, Kotori raise up her voice asking if everyone is okay while couching at the cloud of dust. The attack earlier opened a large hole in the ceiling and the wall. - Kotori looked around. The Spirits and &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; staff are all safe. The Spirits raise up their voices, "Are you okay~!?" "…W-what was that". Kotori then heard an unexpected voice,  "— Kotori-san!" "This voice… Mana!? What are you doing…!"  - In front of Mana there is Ellen in CR-Unit confronting her, holding a sword. Mana fixed her stares at her and wave her hand to Kotori a little to reply to her. Mana expand her &lt;Wolf's Talk&gt; on her right hand and raise up a voice,  "I'll tell you the story later! For now… I'm leaving Nii-sama to you!"  - Mana then kicked the air and continue her fight with Ellen. Kotori then realized that she was the 'countermeasure' Reine talked about.   "That girl… and she disappeared without even telling me her address…!"  - However Kotori is thankful that Mana deal with Ellen for her. Kotori decided to fulfill Mana's request and looked at Shidou,  "Ah…"  - Kotori unconsciously let out that voice. Over there is not the usual gentle Shidou nor the playboy Shidou from earlier. Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  - The dense Spirit Power that whirled around Shidou is blinking on and off like a pulse. The ground, the air, everything is vibrating in the same rhythm as that pulse. Kotori feel as if everything is resonating to Shidou's power. - Not only that, some part of the Spirit Power around him has been transformed into a screen of light or a piece of metal. It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.                        The normal and inverse one     no white pupils     Nice try     It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.  HAPPENING.     No date for Tohko     "That girl… and she disappeared without even telling me her address…!"  What? Is Mana hiding from Kotori or something?     Slutty retards don't get dates    It's time     Kotori wasn't so she can call 'the thing' that is floating while releasing a five-colored lights a human anymore.  Fuck, I want a colored illustration for this.     Nah, looks like even Kotori doesn't know where Mana's living.    He is getting his equivalent to an astral dress but there is no illustration? This is a crime.    but Reine does? That's weird.    Only shiori can be seen in a astral dress    Retard.    Phantom confirmed    The twins got one.    moron.    Reine knows everything there is to know. Can't wait for her arc    Kaguya did nothing wrong    Ellen getting rekt when?    Thats not Natsumi or Ellen     Shidou has unleashed ZA BEASTO mode and called upon his Astral Dress/Armor upon sighting DEM. He wants to rekt Ellen presumably for what DEM did to him in his past.     He's getting an armour or something?    Given Da'at would have the same dress as Kurumi be glad (or not) there is no picture.    We don't how he looks right now but at least we can assume her suit/dress is more than just clothes.    Best twin imo.    Kurumi's dress doesn't have pieces of metal.    The latest version of normal and inverse please     Implying loli Natsumi isn't at least high tier  I'll cut you.     Actually his would be similar to in name as Kurumi's(Elohim vs YHVH Elohim) but the designs would be more like Origami's, Miku's, or Tohka's since Da'at lies on the same branch of the tree that Keter, Yesod, and Malkuth resides on(presumably No. 6 Tipharet would have a similar design as the other 3 spirits in that it would have light emitting from the dress).    She is a bitch, still better than Miku.    This one?    Natsumi is mediocre as hell. Someone the series could honestly just remove and nothing would change     wrecked Shidou's reputation   high tier   Wat       Waiting for Phantom    Close I was thinking the one with the spirits picture on them   Miku is worst girl   Well, you could use that, I guess. Just needs a bit of cleaning.  Actually, screw that. No one besides Tohko and Paper are inversed. There's no reason for everyone else to.      I don't think we have a version with the inverse spirits.   I wonder if Shidou will destroy Ellen now   Natsumi pls    Okay could you still post the angel tree    It seems like Mana is still fighting Ellen but I wonder if Shidou is able to think rationally with all that power.    This is the latest version, right?     no Origmami  No it fucking isnt     Fuck, wrong one.    I saw one with Origami in the crown position.    Someone posted the checklist you can search the pic here     Though we might need to place Shidou into the tree soon into the spot that connects Origami, No.2, and Kurumi.    Makes me wonder whose number six    the 2 should be the same Kurumi's should be YHYH Elohim as well they have shortened a few of the astral dresses names    We need to know his position first and I mean a real confirmation.    Not going to lie, I always thought that was Shido himself.    Phantom    There's indirect confirmation that he is Number 11 with his first name containing the number 11 in it.    Why? The yellow eyes, Shidou being Da'at is still just speculation but he has 11 in his name and the fact he can seal spirits fits with Da'at.    Reine    Rinne    I thought this theory was discarded a long time ago.    Shidou is 2 Mio is Shiori aka Shidou's other half.    If Mio is blonde then it should be her. So far all spirits hair color has match up to their sephirot. The 2 unknown colors are 2 gray and 6 yellow      Bash older Natsumi all you want, but real loli Natsumi is too cute and amusing to even seriously hate. Her design is great anyhow.      We still don't know his angel name(if he has one) or astral dress/armour(if you can call that armour)    Because Tiphareth is also yellow and describes the state of Grace, which means purification and also forgiveness of sin or clenasing.    Sorry but I don't choose what girl is good or bad based on cuteness.    but it doesn't fit with Shidou's name and the hidden name, or the fact he can seal spirits.   Mana is best imouto   Well, at the very least the part about grace would, since he's freeing them to live in peace. Though, alternatively, it could also refer to Phantom creating the Spirits in the first place so they be closer to god.    Natsumi is a like a spoiled brat, her logic is also dumb.    Isn't Phantom turning girls into spirits for Shidou's sake?     &gt;Not only that, some part of the Spirit Power around him has been transformed into a screen of light or a piece of metal. It almost looked like a Spirit with her Astral Dress.   Almost there...      - And the next moment after Kotori saw Shidou's looks, Kotori heard a ominous alarm from her Incom. It is not the same one they used for Space Quake, nor the one they used for when Spirits get emotionally unstable.  - It is the alarm Kotori have heard only once. And that was when they told her to remember it during testing, saying it would be the best if she never hear it. - Kotori feel her fingers trembling slightly. She feel like the is a crack in her very existence. Her heart started beating fast. Breathing become difficult. Her view started distorting. Kotori feel like it's difficult for her to just standing still. - Kotori's conscious were disrupted by the sound of the alarm of the demise for few moments. That was when Shidou raise up a howling. The Spirit Power around him are sparkling like an electric discharge, lighting up the surroundings. - Shidou kicked the floor up to the ground. The height between the ground and underground facility is nothing to him. Shidou mowed down the tree and started moving to somewhere.  "Kotori-san! Are you okay! We should follow Darling!" "……"  - Kotori raise up her face at Miku's words. Kotori tried opening her mouth, but no words are coming out. Kotori can't say it because saying it would means she decided to do perform something absolutely worst.  - However, Kotori have to say it. For this world. For humanity. And for Shidou himself. It is the mission of &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s commander — the responsibility of the one who have been saved by Shidou five years ago. Kotori open her mouth, tried to keep the shake in her voice to minimum,  "…Everyone please standby here. — I'll do something." "Standby? Let us do something." "Agreement. This is unlike Kotori."  - When Kotori said that, the Spirits looked at her with a surprised expression. Kotori don't surprise at their reaction. Kotori would be the same if someone said this to her, with her don't know the circumstances. However Kotori can't have their accompany.                    So she claims. Is it for his sake, or what she thinks he needs?    Will he be able to recognize who is enemy and who is ally? Because Mana could be in danger.    Kotori is a traitor     &gt;it would be the best if she never hear it.   This chapter is seriously going places.      Yeah, kill Shidou in front of the spirits. What's the worst that could happen?    Angel typically associated with Da'at is Uriel and Astral Dress/Armor would be YHVH(though probably here they would use Adonai like Natsumi and Tohka) Elohim. My guess with the shape that Uriel will take for Shidou would be a sword that in its base form can channel fire, light, and lightning and judging from the description of how his Astral Dress/Armor would look like a male variation of Tohka's dress. I guess he would be the Paladin of repentance and salvation based off of what Uriel does.    I doesn't look like she has bad intentions and there is that line she said in volume 11.    That's why she told them to stay behind. Like, don't get me wrong, that's not much better, but she's not stupid.    Two things: 1. Holy shit! 2. I've seen the word "electric" paired up with Shidou since the Instant Lightning Blast attack. Shidou's power has something to do with electricity.      Well, Uriel's OTHER job is purgation and the spreading of plagues or just killing everything.  So, Inverse?      Threat level should be SS or SSS if that's the maximum. Angel, Astral dress and Spacequake scale are unknown.   Reminder that 2's spirit waves and someone else were almost the same. That means that either Shidou or Phantosm are a part of 2. Considering that Shidou got berserk when 2 got close you can make your own conclusions.   "— As I said, it is for me to do something with Shidou. Just leave it to me. &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; already prepared something for a case like this."  - The Spirits nodded to her while still feeling a little unease. Kotori answered to them and walk up stair up to the ground. Shidou is still moving while mowing down the tree. If he continues, no doubt he would reach the town.  - Kotori looked at Shidou and take out the terminal from her dress's pocket. It is the key of destruction she sworn to herself to never use. Kotori manipulate the terminal with her shaking fingers. - She scanned her fingerprint, then scanned her retina, input the password and placed her finger on the button. The button that activates &lt;Dainslaif&gt;, the satellite weapon that always aiming at Shidou.  "…I'm sorry, Onii-chan"  - Kotori let her words out.   "Please forgive me… who can't find another ending."  - However, that moment, Kotori feel a murderous intent coming from her left side. The next moment, a gun is pressed onto her forehead. - Kotori moved her eyes to that direction. Over there, Origami who should still be in the underground facility is looking to her with a dangerous eyes with her 9mm gun. Origami open her mouth with a cold and calm voice,  "What is that thing in your hand. What are you going to do to Shidou? Itsuka Kotori, you —"  - Origami stopped her words mid-sentence. Origami moved her brows a little. Kotori understand that it might be because Origami saw her face. The face that is full of tear and snivel and a painful expression. Origami continued while knitting her brows.   "…Explain. What does this means." "…I'm going to kill Shidou." "Is that also &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s order?" "…You're only half correct."  - Kotori knew that Origami is smart. She wouldn't allow Kotori to smooth it over, and even if Kotori forcibly do it, she would try her best to stop her from doing. Kotori then continue her explanation in desperation.                            Don't be a bad imouto Kotori.     &gt;Threat level should be SS or SSS   Agreed. If he triggered 'that' alarm then it means things are going down when Shidou goes to town.      Origami a best.    I don't think they are so stupid to not realize what's happening outside, this can't end well either way.    Origami a smart    Fuck off Kotori    but the power inside Shidou belongs to the girls, not him. If the waves were similars doesn't that mean she is the one who is part of something else?   Kotori can only control her power for a very short amount of time and then goes berserk herself and against Berserk-Shidou, I don't think she has a chance of winning/killing him.   Kotori worst girl    Reversed roles.    As expected of Kotori. Mana is the only true imouto    Origami best girl protecting Shidou, Kotori is a bad imouto.    I never said it was a good plan, just that SHE wasn't stupid.   That's why she has a satellite laser.       I would feel Chronozon would be Shidou's Maou for his inverse. Also gives Kurumi more relevance if Shidou ever goes inverse as it is said that the Goddess Babylon keeps Chronozon sealed and Babylon is under Kurumi's influence.    This Origami turned out to be better than I expected.   reminder why Kotori is shit    &gt;"Please forgive me… who can't find another ending."   Date-a-Live has an strange way to remind you that this is based on a dating game system even in the most intense moments.  It's Awesome.        He was always considered the biggest threat, just look how Ratatoskr is racting.    Nice bit of thinking.  Wait a second, doesn't Kurumi have a bullet that can do stuff with memories?      If Shidou is Da'at then Chronozon must be his inverse.      Kotori is going dark knight   Takes the burden and sin    Kotori a BEST.        You mean the bullet that allows her to watch past memories?    Kotori is a traitor    Kotori proving she is best imouto. Stopping her onii-chan from becoming a monster who kills and rampage the world, and she will probably end her life after she kills the one she loves most.    Remove Kotori.    Yeah, it's kinda sad if you think about it: he's giving it his all to seal all the spirits and Ratatoskr is prepared to throw him away as if they have a few more Shidou's ready to take his place, but if he's the only one with the ability to seal spirit's and the Spirit Power goes back to the spirit's after his "death", then I don't understand why Ratatoskr even considered saving the spirit's - everything would have been for nothing.   So what if they actually kill Shidou and the spirits go inverse? Are they going to kill them too?   this isn't going to happen.  But they might have to?      How many characters invoke serious life and death drama and conflict? My count is Tohka, Origami, and Kotori.     Trying to fight against 7-8 Inverse Spirits at once  I wonder what could possibly go wrong.      implying Ratatoskr are good guys         Fuck off. I'm onto you.        Just drop bombs all over elevens.    If this would happen, then I'd say yes, 'cause they would never be able to control so many Inverse-type Spirits   Ai getting the dick when?     Well, they have that weapon Kotori is about to use but it makes me wonder, if the knew this was inevitable. Why seal the spirits?   I like Kotori, but honestly, the author should include more Mana, because I like her as much.   Especially in regards to both Tohka and Origami if Kotori had succeeded and killed Shidou with the Satellite Cannon, then most likely would have committed suicide afterwards to stave off both going inverse and penance for killing her beloved brother is that without Shidou both of them would go inverse fast. The other Spirits can hold it off a little longer but would eventually have nothing left to live for and would go inverse too.    Is she a spirit?    Yep. It's probably the key to figuring out what happened those years ago.   Because they figure they have a better option so they should use it.  But what if it makes the person doing the sealing explode? I remember reading that if Rinne detonated she'd vaporize Japan. Spirits don't do much damage, all things considered, if the population can evacuate soon enough. The realizers can replace the property, and no one dies. It's way better to have Spirits wandering around attacking things than to let an entire country explode.          choosing duty over family  Disgusting    Time for lewd Origami   What about Mana? I don't think she will be able to endure and forgive the fact Ratatoskr killed Shidou.    Gross   Miku is worst girl    Following orders per training   traitor      I didn't play the VN and I never considered the possibility that Shidou could explode. It must not happen, but if the possibility exists, then I can understand why Ratatoskr is so afraid of Shidou going berserk. All the Spirit Power inside of him could lead to an explosion almost on the same scale as the Spacequake 30 years ago, if you ask me.    "…Shidou right now is a time bomb. The Spirit Power within him rapidly expanded. If we leave him like this, it would be an explosion even larger than the South Kanto incident." "…. And that's why you're killing him?" "…Yes. That's the final job of me who have 'failed'. If Shidou is killed before he is at his limits, then we can keep the explosion to minimal. It's a choice between seeing ten millions of people and Shidou die, or seeing only Shidou dies. If someone tell me to choose, I'll choose the latter. — Because even Shidou, he probably don't want to see such many people die because of him." "……"  - Origami's finger is shaking. Kotori turned her eyes back to Shidou,  "If I press this button, &lt;Dainslaif&gt; on the satellite orbit will released its Magic Power cannon." "&lt;Dainslaif&gt;…?" "…The cursed sword that used every detail of Shidou's body data, made to kill Shidou and only Shidou alone."  - That is the &lt;Dainslaif&gt;. Kotori don't know a worse way to use Realizer. Even if Shidou has Kotori's regeneration power, he can't regenerate himself if every single bit of his body are destroyed.  "…Don't mess around. Is this the &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;'s way of doing things? Kill him once he can no longer keep the Spirit Power that were sealed within him? Before that, the one who made Shidou seal Spirits' Spirit Power was &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;. They used him for their own purpose, and once he become inconvenient to them, they're going to get rid of him? Even though you thought of Shidou that much, why did you agreed to —" "— No!"  - Kotori raise up her voice stopping Origami's words.  "Even though Shidou's power miraculously matched with &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; objective — but at least Woodman chairman do worry about him. He said nothing good will come out of sealing Spirit's power in human body. He suggested us to find another way to do it. But… it was already too late. The moment Shidou was found out by &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;, he already sealed one Spirit within him."                      Yeah, her too. Though the inverse spirits alone would destroy the world before she gets a chance to shank Ratatoskr.    Considering Shidou has 7 spirits sealed the amount of power would be enough to create a big spacequake.     "…Shidou right now is a time bomb. The Spirit Power within him rapidly expanded. If we leave him like this, it would be an explosion even larger than the South Kanto incident."  I guess that confirms the thing about Shidou exploding.     Kotori is right.    Confirmed!   The Spirit Power within him rapidly expanded. If we leave him like this, it would be an explosion even larger than the South Kanto incident."         inb4 Ratatoskr is evil       The moment Shidou was found out by &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;, he already sealed one Spirit within him.  Shidou sealed a Spirit before Tohka !?      Kotori     Yeah, I was like "Srsly? 27s after my post it's confirmed? Holy shit!" and flipped my tablet     "Even though Shidou's power miraculously matched with &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; objective — but at least Woodman chairman do worry about him. He said nothing good will come out of sealing Spirit's power in human body. He suggested us to find another way to do it. But… it was already too late. The moment Shidou was found out by &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;, he already sealed one Spirit within him."  So they didn't know about the sealing, then what is Shidou?     Retard     Because even Shidou, he probably don't want to see such many people die because of him."  Close enough to what I've been calling for years over the theory as to why Kotori said she will kill Shidou in volume 5.     Kotori dummy.    Tohka, stop posting on 4chan.    Who knows but maybe Shidou kissed Mio, Mana or even Kotori.   so what would they have done if they never found Shido?   Kinda figured it had to be something like this. Like, Ratatoskr isn't actually crazy so what reason would they have to go through with this? Made sense when you think of it from that angle.   Ask Phantom. Ratatoskr's board members mention in the earlier volumes that they thought it was suspicious how convenient he was.       Kotori..... did you forget?    Tohka pls.    it was Kotori you faggots    Now imagine if Tohka's so dumb because she saves her brainpower for funposting on 2ch.  More Yuzuru's thing I know.     They would have go the AST and fight spirits or maybe not considering they lack equipment and members to form an army.    Try to kill them?    Surgery.  Or done their best to normalize them in other ways. Might have worked for Yoshino, but never any of the others.      Retards can't use the internet    Yet you are here    Kotori is wrong    Reminder it's all part of Phantom's master plan.    Kotori is shit Mana would never let this happen    Post doggami.    Nah, I'm pretty sure it was that Mio girl.    Now that you're pointing it out, yes, it make's sense. Maybe I was to caught up in my rage-mode, because it hurts when you think how Ratatoskr is using his power for their desire to save the spirit's, then throw him away like he's nothing to them and risking that 8 Spirit's might go Inverse. But well, risking the lives of few million people is ooq too    Supposedly Phantom wants to protect shido so Doubt she planned the space lazer      Then why force him to seal spirits you are going to kill him anyway?    4chan is a special place on the net.    Are you sure? Did Shidou have any other power besides healing before sealing Tohka?    Not wrong until power of friendship makes it wrong. Given Shidou's personality, he would want Kotori to choose the latter choice too.    Disgusting.    he got healing from Kotori     &gt;South Kanto incident   &gt;incident   Oh boy...       Good.  Now keep going.     Kotori was his first sealing incident    Whore    Gross      Really? What would have ignorant Mana done to prevent Shidou from going critical? Do tell.    Yes.   I want to see the scene where she sticks his head under her skirt animated. Water absorbancy.       Slut wants the D      Short-Hair-Origami in Dog-Mode: disgusting Long-Hair-Origami in Dog-Mode: I would marry her!     "…You mean" "Yes — that was me."  - Kotori said with a shaking voice. It is an contradiction that can't be avoided since &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; found out of Shidou's power from the fact that he sealed Kotori's power.  "There was a possibly of Shidou becoming like this since five years ago. But even if you returned the Spirit Power to the Spirit, the Path won't be disappeared… five years ago, I put the time bomb into Shidou without knowing." "…But won't letting him seal even more Spirits only increase the risk of him come to his limit?" "…There's no other way. …There is only one way to stabilize Shidou." "What is that?" "— To have Shidou extract all Spirits Power he have and release it outside his body as a Sephira." "…! That is —"  - Sephira. That is the mysterious crystal of Spirit Power that &lt;Phantom&gt; have. Origami also have been turned into a Sprit because of that power.   "You're right. But could it possibly be done…" "…Right. It's impossible for us to do it even if we have our full power. I let &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; analyze over me several times. To extract a Sephira that has been united at the Spirit Particle level, it requires a lot of Spirit Power to do it. To put it simply — we have to seal all Spirits that has been confirmed within Shidou just to do that."  - Origami widen her eyes in surprise. Seeing her reaction, Kotori realized that Origami is suspicious of &lt;Ratatoskr&gt;. Kotori thought that's not hard to understand, as she don't really trust &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; for everything either.  - Kotori then tell Origami that even if she tell her that, it's already too late. Kotori can't afford to lost more time. She took a deep breath, and tried to push the button, - That moment, Kotori heard a voice of Tohka from behind. She turned back and noticed that all Spirits are standing over there. They followed her up to the ground just like Origami.  "Everyone —" "Don't be such a stranger! If you have that circumstances, why don't you talk with us!?"                          It's a failsafe not something that they thought was inevitable . Beserk Shidou could end up blowing up a quarter of the planet, again    Personally, I think they should have gone with the first plan: tie him down and cycle the spirits through the room one at a time. Even if it means leaving him tied down and alone with Origami.   ...dog?   Say bone next time, it's funnier.          This.       "Everyone —"   "Don't be such a stranger! If you have that circumstances, why don't you talk with us!?"  and here they come      Twins are sex  Kaguya A cutie though      So they want his Sephire with all the spirits ' powers inside?    Wow, wow, wow...    So he still doesn't have a Sephira    Nice    Shidou being Da'at is becoming real at this point if they need to seal all the spirits to extract the Sephira.    You're right. He's almost there though, since the Astral Dress was trying to appear. I forget, does the Sephira disintegrate when it's used? Would having a Sephira mean you have an Astral Dress?     So they want to extract the Sephira. That explains why they are willing to invest so much into this endeavor. &lt;Ratatoskr&gt; Council Members that's it.     but they told him to seal spirits knowing there was a big chance for this to happen.    The moment he sealed all Spirits, he might become "The First Spirit"? Like, the Sephira's were all a part of him and after an incident, he lost his power or something like this? So he just takes back what once belonged to him, who knows. There are so many theories about Shidou, at this point only the author knows what Shidou really is.    How the hell do you restrain a being with most of the Spirits powers in a single body?    Is Kotori going to tell them the truth?    Provide incentives.   Strip Yoshino in front of him.       We already have some scenes hinting Shidou could be the first spirit or very similar to him in powers  Reine's explanation about Rinne   Shidou being able to seal several spirits   Materail A spirit waves similar to Shidou's        Easy, you kill him.    and will they do with the Sephira if they manage to extract it.    Phantom is the only one who can save Shidou.    take over the world    Read the summaries only other way to dis arm him is sealing all the spirits. so options 1 are kill him have spirits still being targeted and causeing damage 2 seal all spirits remove power from him.     Reine= Phantom  therefore Reine true end      and what happened to the first spirit anyway? I doubt anyone on earth was strong enough to kill him/her    Meh, cheesy time.     Rinne True ED     - Kotori surprised at how Tohka knew the situation. Kotori then realized that she still had her Incom equipped. Anyone with an Incom could tune their channel to talk with each other. That means everyone also heard the conversation with Origami earlier. Kotori didn't think of it since it is an emergency.  "…I'm sorry, but everything is already ended." "Nothing has ended yet!" Tohka yelled at Kotori "I don't know the details! But if you think the situation right now is desperate, that is because Kotori is alone!"  "……"  - Kotori feel someone squeezed her heart at Tohka's word. "Every… one…" Kotori said. The Spirits looked into her eyes and nodded to her, as if they're encouraging her.   "Giving up is so unlike Kotori-san!" "Yes… let's save Shidou-san…" "……"  - Kotori's finger that is placing on the button is shaking. The picture of when they gave her this terminal came to her mind. Back then, Kotori was very scared of it. Even though it's just in case of emergency, Kotori couldn't sleep at the fact she had a way to kill Shidou in her hands. - However, Kotori back then and Kotori right now are different. The determination, the experience, and even more than anything — her comrades who share the same idea as her. Then there's no way she can't come up with other conclusion. The terminal is then dropped from Kotori's hand.  <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127117237#p127128185">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   Have you seen this shit? It's called Puchimas.   Sure have.  I take it you didn't like it?    Watched the first season. I liked the moments when they went full non-deformed.   my nig  i think the non-deformed style for most of the cast is pretty hot     Was this actually good? This is speaking as someone who likes iM@S characters but hasn't fully drank the moe Kool-Aid and wants some actual good humor.  Puchis are the cutest things to grace anime  I just watched it this week. It's cute if a bit monotonous.   We're kindred spirits, you and I.    tfw no CG puchimasu    the true moe kool aid is appreciating that cute girls are cute appreciating only cute girls being cute \and being able to overlook unfunny shit like kinmoza because the girls are cute and gay is blasphemy  stay to the path of righteousness      Shut the fuck up queer     Have you seen this shit?  Have you read the manga?      &gt;appreciating only cute girls being cute \and being able to overlook unfunny shit like kinmoza because the girls are cute and gay is blasphemy  K-On and Lucky Star are widely liked by moefags and whatever shit attempts they made at humor fell flat. I'm not necessarily looking for laugh-out-loud western humor, but something like Nichijou drew some chuckles.     That's what the 4koma looks like, I still don't understand why they didn't keep it for the whole thing.      Haruka...      Is watching idolshit a prerequisite for watching this?     Having proper Akane-style art for the whole "show" (since they are shorts) would require actual budget and SCAMCO is too cheap for that     No, playing im@s 1 is.    This, except replace "anime" with everything. I like Puchimas even more than Nukoduke and Gakuen Babysitters.    I will never own a puchi ;_;       You shut your fucking mouth gaymo I swear on me mum    Atleast you can get those plushes   Warning: Do NOT Open   Why have you put a curse on this thread     You could probably get away with watching The Idolm@ster or playing iM@S2. Or just watch it and see where it takes you    It's perfume, Lo. Please don't get it in your eye.     nah, I love the series and have never touched anything else idol related. You kind of pick up on some things as you read the manga for puchimas.    I'd watch the shit out of it if I had watched/played Idolmaster.     The translator of this manga is really cool. He's a great guy.   If only the typesetter wasn't so shit.    I opened it, how do I stop this?    It's the only Idolmaster thing I've seen.    Back away slowly.

Cause Goddess of Wisdom is a teacher at that school.    To make connections and friends like him (He met zanoba, ariel, cliff, nanahoshi, cat and dog)    How old is Lucy in this chapter?      seven    After the labyrinth.    were not getting progress reports on the kids magic are we?    Pretty Sure All the kids will reach advanced in multiple areas and hopefully Lara can at least match Roxy in combat. Seeing as she's semi telepathic it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to say she can do chantless magic   On Kaezars website and made a list of stories he plans to make.  "Going to the Holy Land of Swords once again" Well that's going to be potential awkward. Sorry Nina kind-of killed you father-Eris     I have a feeling Eris and Nina will be more concerned about bragging about there families.  my husband is 6th! So what me and my husband took down a ancient war god of legend!      Are these stories in sequential order?   or perhaps they will talk about arranging marriage between their child   Just finished http://ncode.syosetu.com/n1222ci/ Up to ch 2 is translated for those interested. It is quite good , the fights well done and the party isn't just him bringing his harem around(though he does have 3 girls going after him).  MC is summoner.He deleted his own memories so he can have LVL S summoning skill .He can have up to 9 summons, with +100 stats bonus to his pets and him being able to contract anything as long as the other one wants.Later he lvls up wind/earth magic and scythe skill(to use with rank S magic scythe) 1)Angel/Goddess , looks like a Valkyrie.She said he seduced her but like she herself said she just wanted a break after more than a thousand years of hard work.Infact while she teases him about MC confessing to her she never really goes after him even after he can finally summon her avatar around lvl 80 2)Slime. Ranks up in gigant black slime. Second strongest summon since it can sacrifice energy accumulated in its storage(weapons, armors or bodies) to make a beam or self explode divided parts of him.Is even used as weapon storage by party members during battle by hiding small parts of it in guantlets 3)Black knight,after he ranks up in dread knight he gets a physical body. Got defeated by the slime's beam while distracted by MC. Is a bro (and probably a lolicon) (not a summon=Then he gets an half elf slave who got a fire dragon king curse. He reverses it in a blessing. She combines fire magic and archery. She may be half dragon half elf (daughter of fire dragon lord ) but according to lore it should not be possible. Since son of said fire dragon lord appears as human's pet the former one could have got killed by them and elf's mother raped) 4)Demon principess sealed by her maou father a few centuries ago. He unsealed her after fighting one former maou general who wanted to unseal her and absorb her powers to kill the present maou and be king.Specialises in fist fighting and can fly with her wings(looks like a succubus)<br/>             (not a summon)With the suggesstion of Goddess he summons an hero since there are enemies who can be only hurt by them.Specializes in acrobatic fights with the help of a shadow wolf.The so called 3 sword style(wolf using one).IS basically an imoutou to MC(not aiming for his D) 5)Shadow wolf, he usually hides in the hero girl's shadow He still has 4 more free spots to use.        Isn't that another one of those series where the protagonist starts off week, but becomes essentially the strongest in like 2 weeks? Stuff that like bizarrely annoys me.    Stop reading shitty escapism webnovels. If you continue this might actually get really popular and we will get another shitty anime like Mahouka or SAO.    Needs more FeMC anime.    While he does get strong really fast (even faster than the 4 heroes called one year before him) the fights are really well made and realistic with each party member doing its part. Though a bit more plot related stuff only started to come out towards the end (is at ch 111)    Arus and Nina's baby? What a twist    Inbreeding between idiots? Would that not be dangerous?   So the chapter about it being about Aisha's marriage was a lie after all?  I want Aisha to marry   a clone of her brother   or maybe   be MILF maido for Akihito       I need more fantasy WNs with QT grill MCs instead.    especially ones with lewd undertones   dragon bloodline   ogre village   100 ogres wanted to fuck her           https://darkfishoftherevolution.wor<wbr>dpress.com/2015/06/24/she-professed<wbr>-herself-the-pupil-of-the-wise-man-<wbr>chapter-20/ http://www.sousetsuka.com/2015/06/d<wbr>eath-march-kara-hajimaru-isekai_24.<wbr>html</wbr></wbr> </wbr></wbr></wbr>  Guess I'll post these here.   And, guess who finally got an illustration.   I wish Sun Knight translations would finish up already.   Dude that one blind tiger chick nice forgot her name    Forul was surprisingly more feminine looking than I thought. I always had the image of him as being more muscular in my head.     That Fohl  No wonder Naofumi tried to fuck him     Spear looks hilarious with those filorial feathers Is sword being chuuni with that mask or part of a curse?     Oh yeah, and MT volume 7 is finally arriving in August.  http://mfbooks.jp/3167/      White haired loli by the way is a new character and uses scissors.     Oh shit. Misremembered his name. Well, at least I know Atla is named Atla.   I think it's part of his bandit lord disguise when he was being corrupt? Not sure if he continues wearing it or if this is just for his arc? Don't know what the story is for the LN, anyway.   She from their world or from the other world?           Only know that her name is Sein and that she may be a scissors hero.I guess hammer will be turned into blacksmith tool instead of hero weapon. Or maybe both.It would be nice if MC's favourite blacksmith got it.    Speaking of which, is anybody here going to be purchasing the published LN of shieldbro?    Don't think all the stories will come out in the same order the author listed them.     A question. I haven't read Tate Yuusha, but I have been reading the author's new Narou work about the protagonist being the only one able to return to Earth. And it's complete garbage and is pretty poorly written. Am I wrong to think that Shield Hero, his previous work, can't be any better written? Or is it that everyone likes the light novel version of it that went through an editor?      Here illustration  I will probably buy it when my brother gets to aru majutsu so that we spend less money with international shipment.      That work is shit, just read tate no yuusha skip a few SOL chs about village building and then when final battle starts just read the last 3 chs.    I pre-ordered the first two for now. I'll decide on the quality of the first one if I'll continue (most likely yes, though; since I see no hope for a LN translation).    This thread needs more Atlas.

Reaction Images or general disscusion.   Moemura not akuma. Big difference you got to fill the pumpkin with seeds before it can fill you.    But she wasn't Akuma. She was being moe, and when she does become akuma you better believe you will take in all of her seeds.  Every last seed.     No, whoremura always is carrying the seed of several men, women and even animals inside of her. Because she is that much of a whore.   She already was like this as early as her retarded braids phase.       Homuhater you are late. Even kevin beat you to the thread!     Dumping Historie c90 and Vinland Saga c117 raws.
