Which is to say, never.</br>  Will he ever stop pestering Kaito?  <br> implying he will ever hit puberty </br>   Haibara will never win     They're both fucking trash  <br>Sadly no. <br><br>Just like Kaito will never really NTR Conan by seducing Ran no matter how much the movies tease it.</br></br></br>  <br>But Kaito already has that other girl</br>      <br>Kaito never has enough girls.</br>  New chapter when?  <br> That one time where he put Kaito's motorcycle on fire </br>  <br>Meant to quote </br>  <br>Why is he such an ass?</br>  <br>Because fuck thieves</br>  Haibara will probably stay a kid and pair up with mitsuhiko.  How is this guy NOT grown into his full body by now? It's been years  <br>Because it hasn't been years</br>  <br>cartoons don't move in real time you autist</br>  Threadly reminder that it's universally agreed Haibara is the best girl already. The author just needs to give in.  <br>He's way too into childhood friend romance for that.</br>  <br>The author will never give in. Plus, he has the ending already locked away in a safe somewhere or something.</br>  <br>That's JKR level of dumb.</br>  <br><br>Then how long has it been?</br></br>  <br>Less than 1 year I think</br>  <br> you mean kill ran and make ai her sex slave in the basement. </br>  <br>They're still all in the same grade in school, so not even a year</br>  <br><br>episode?</br></br>  <br>so did he and ran fuck back when he was an adult?</br>  Vermouth is my waifu  <br><br>So basically cartoon time where they are stuck in one segment of time for all eternity? Got it</br></br>  <br>Took you long enough</br>  <br>It's not anything as simple as a loop, the technology and pop culture references update over time</br>  <br>the murder rate around him must be awful.</br>  <br>Some times he's dragged into cases. Like that one time where he was passing by and Takagi asked him to get in there and solve a goddamn kidnapping case.<br>Or when he was camping with the detective boys and Ran called saying someone was murdered.</br></br>  <br>Recurring characters frequently comment on it. Either attributing the murders to Kogoro or Conan. Both have been described as shinigami.</br>  <br>Maybe an alternate universe where a year has over 1000+ days and people age much more slowly as well?</br>  <br>Doesn't explain the manga going from "this is something called a "floppy disc" to "quick, call him on your smart phone!".<br><br>That's easily a 15 year leap in tech in the span of less than one year. It's like time is dilated.</br></br></br>  I haven't watched this since episode 430.<br>How is the series going? Any noteable development?</br>  <br>Even with 1000 days, the death rate is insane around him. I'm surprised everyone around him isn't as jaded to death as he is.</br>  <br>And you forgot the most important part, Conan is the only smart detective in Japan</br>  <br>Ran doesn't seem to bothered by it, neither do the Detective Boys, really. Man those kids are going to be jaded as fuck. Bet their parents wished they just watched TV all the time like normal kids, instead of being desensitized for real.</br>  <br>The best part is when the characters call old technology junk.</br>  <br>Heiji and Hakuba can keep up wth him just fine, Kaito also probably could if he wasn't a thief. It's not the others detectives fault that the cases are ridiculous.<br>I sure as hell wouldn't be able to solve "that guy has been living on the ceiling of your bathroom for 3 months"</br></br>  <br>I think I remember that from one of the Kaitou Kid movies, Conan complaining about the two-way radios or something as "outdated junk".</br>  <br>Conan just like most anime that goes on for over a decade puts a sort of time freeze on everything in order to allow the series to avoid serious changes. It's just like how Ash is still 10 years old. Same with Sazae-san always being in her late twenties. It's just a thing elevens are expected to ignore via suspension of disbelief.</br>  If the death rate is high, wonder what the prisons look like.  <br>There's other smart ones, it's just that the cases get progressively more stupid so that only the author could solve them.<br><br> it turns out the secret to locating the bomb was the English phrases "major league" and "extra innings" mentioned in the taunting letter <br> you see, the abbreviations in American baseball that this refers to are written as XT and if you write that vertically and flip it upside down it resembles the kanji used to represent schools on a map <br> ERGO THE BOMB MUST BE AT A SCHOOL <br>Yeah okay</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know shit about the anime, but the manga is moving a lot more smoothly lately</br>  Who do you think Rum is?  <br>This shit reminds me of that one "deduction" scene from Black Dynamite. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3D9<wbr>7gwGlMFE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Kansuke pretty competent as well.</br>  <br>I just finished episode 411, so I don't know that one yet.</br>  <br>It's just basically like a Simpsons kind of ting if we were to look for a western equivalent. Except Simpsons has no overarching plot and is purely comedic so people tend to be more willing to overlook the technology leaps and pop culture stuff.</br>  <br>This movie was a fun afternoon</br>  <br><br><br>The problem is that most smart people aren't actually detectives. Shinichi's father, Akai, Gin and Bourbon are all smart as fuck.<br><br>Kansuke and Morofushi are the only policemen worth something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, detectives attract death wherever they go and only get paid for it when it's a request, so it's easy to see why there aren't many.</br>  <br>That's only private detectives. Policemen are on a fixed payroll.<br><br>Well, now that I think about it, Akai and Bourbon probably are as well.</br></br></br>    I told myself I wouldn't pick this back up for a third time especially considering the several hundreds of episodes...<br>reconsidering for best girl.</br>  <br>Just take it easy. I'm about 380 episodes behind, watching 3 episodes a day and hoping to catch up this year.</br>      <br>No, he'll find a bed big enough for three.</br>  <br><br> not just skipping all the useless crap </br></br>  <br>This<br>Only a nip or a retard watches all the filler crap</br></br>  <br> Skipping episodes <br>They're fun</br></br>  <br><br>How many fishing line murderers would I miss then?</br></br>  <br>Eh, maybe early on. After 600 chapters it becomes boring as shit.</br>  <br>I'm still barely after 400, but I don't plan on skipping any to catch up. Some filler cases are almost Danganronpa-tier, but they're still fun somehow.</br>  <br>Scratch that, I did skip 2 or 3 because of awful subs</br>  <br>Detective yes.<br><br>But there are smarter people than him, leagues away. <br>Kaito and his father are the most famous examples</br></br></br></br>  Where the fuck are all the good Haibara doujins at?  <br>I'm assuming you've read all of Wanyan Aguda's stuff right?</br>  <br>Kaito is nowhere near Conan. Unless you mean Kaito-dad.<br><br>The only ones that seem to be significantly smarter than Conan are his father and maybe Bourbon.</br></br></br>  <br>He said good.</br>  <br>Got to work with what you get man. Those are fine.</br>  <br> Danganronpa-tier <br>Meaning they are retarded?</br></br>  <br>He was never an adult. He was 16 or 17 at the start of the series.</br>  <br>Yeah. They're fun in a different way than actual cases. I couldn't stop laughing at the guy who died 4 times.</br>  <br>Which episode is this?</br>  <br>Why do some people think long running fiction moves at the same pace as the real world? It's not a sitcom, the actors aren't visibly aging making the show have to move time forward a year each season. How retarded are you</br>  <br>http://www.detectiveconanworld.com/<wbr>wiki/The_Man_Who_Was_Killed_Four_Ti<wbr>mes</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Akai's FBI, that's pretty close</br>  <br>Thanks.<br>I remember this. It was retarded.</br></br>  <br>I miss conan's flipphones. Going dual iphone is dumb</br>  <br>Yeah, I fixed that here: <br>But is he still FBI? I mean, how can the US government keep paying him if he's reported dead?</br></br>  <br>The funny part is smart phones obsolete like half his old gear.</br>  <br>By the time he reaches marital age, everyone who ever heard of anyone you've ever heard of will be dead.</br>  <br> implying the government isn't well versed in paying dead employees to coverup embezzlement and secretly funding various projects <br>Only in this case the secret is that the money actually is going to the dead guy.</br></br>  <br>Only like the flashlight in the watch and the earring phone.</br>   Serafall <br><br>So this is what having a waifu feels like?</br></br>  No, that's what having an erection feels like.  <br>Anon, I think I'm in love with a Botswanian claymation character</br>  Volume 20 spoilers soon.  <br>Season 4 when?

Holy shit. Inside Agreas are more than a thousand mass-produced versions of the Sekiryuutei's armor (which apparently function by themselves) as well as a sleeping 666 itself.

The enemies are also more powerful than the geah team so her teammates can't even buy her enough time to get her thoughts together. Like how Tsubasa and Chris defended her from Shirabe's attacks when she won't fight.

I think she was only able to activate it because the whole world singing Ringo drove phonic gain into maximum overload.</br>  <br>True, they believe in different things right now but I actually think the show is trying to portray the naivety of Hibiki's beliefs and challenging it so that she grows. Maria was the previous owner of the gear and she also went through the same experience (not wanting to hurt anyone yet still wanting to save people). I don't think she's saying it emptily at that point.</br>  <br>It's actually looking a lot better now. Remember at the end of G the pendant had broken in half; now it's just cracked again.</br>  <br>Yeah i expect Bikki goes berserk when she touch Dainsleif</br>  <br> at the end of G the pendant had broken in half; <br>What? When did that happen?</br></br>  <br>Really Phonic Gain is just another name for Deus Ex Machina. Is there anything it can't do except bring Kanade back to life?</br>  <br>At the end of G.</br>  So, is Carol too small and cute to be taken seriously?    <br> except bring Kanade back to life <br>Don't be so sure about that anon.</br></br>  <br>Well, half of a relic shard is still a relic shard.</br>  <br><br>Story of her life, that's why she's so pissed.</br></br>  <br>Yes.

Touma went through 20+ volumes with one belief and managing to punch through all problems so he kept the belief. Then his belief got challenged completely, he couldn't bullshit or punch his way out and broke down. In the end, he came out of it stronger by insisting on his selfishness although compromising a little.

I hope she keeps it up.</br>  <br> everyone else already thought it was likely <br>"everyone"<br>More surprise than expectation from what I've seen.<br> Don't get your hopes up, kanadefromdrawing still is a stretch </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.

Maybe move Nana's drawing to the gaijin side like Sabin.</br>  So what was Elf9 saying about installing  <br>They need to install Windows 10 on the Symphogears.</br>  For a split second I though she was gonna give her a goodbye kiss there.  <br>Shop her smile from the OP onto her face</br>  <br>She got some of Carol's alchemic skills installed in her but not the details of her plan.</br>  <br>Alchemical creations can be implanted with knowledge.

I didn't want to jump the gun since we haven't gotten much of Micha yet, but I'm pretty sure Garie is best doll.</br>  <br>BERSERK SOON</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Words can’t describe her. <br/></br>  Since Hibiki can't use Gungnir that means Maria is going to take it back right? RIGHT?  <br>It's been a while since I watched it but wasn't Maria's personal belief similar to Hibiki's? She actually didn't want to hurt anyone even if she said she would or is prepared to. Her song is a prideful boast that hides her weak will (like her cape) and refusal to do what she's saying. FIS goals were contrary to her personal belief so it just didn't work that well for her and she kept crying. She was shaken after seeing what happened after she hit those soldiers. In the end, she finally found something she believes in and was finally able to do something of value by helping save the world.<br><br>The way I see it is, she had similar beliefs to Hibiki in G but personally knew what it was like to hurt people. She did miss one crucial element that Hibiki had which was learning how to hold hands. After she got over the death of her sister, she finally grew up after the final talk with Mamu and after learning how to hold hands from Hibiki. Now she's just talking from the perspective of someone who went through the same experience.<br><br>Of course, Hibiki doesn't necessarily have to come out with the same realization as Maria. This is why I'm curious which route Hibiki takes. She'll go berserk at one point of course.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love you sometimes anon.</br>  <br>I just saw their faces. Would have been even funnier if they had a little smile.</br>  <br>Why haven't there been moneyshot shoops of this so far?</br>  <br>Isn't it better to use something besides Nana's drawing for the screenshot? It's kind of redundant to have it in the left and the right.</br>  <br>Either that or  Miku will be able to activate it because AI YO.  I would like to see that fabulous cape one last time, though.</br>  <br> I'm a serious villain! Really! <br><br>So cute, Hibiki and Miku can take her home and adopt her.</br></br></br>  <br> moneyshot shoops <br/></br>  <br>Don't tweet this to Nana she will cry</br>  <br>Oh god, someone do it with the first 3 episodes of the gaijin chart</br>  <br>Beef stroganoff on the left?</br>  <br>You're right. The original concept for Maria was always for her to be a lot like Hibiki except without the ability to bring people together easily (by holding hands). Unfortunately that kind of got sidelined last season.</br>  <br>She'll be Yuka's guest for next week's geah radio. We should send it to them and see what they say.</br>  <br>Nana has a twitter?</br>  <br>This actually needs to happen. Zoid said he would translate and forward mails to the show. This can actually happen.</br>  <br>Send just the bushi gainjins one. No point in sending her the rest.</br>  <br><br>Why would she cry, it's great.</br></br>  Dat manly jaw.<br><br>Looking up to Hibiki-sempai, eh?</br></br>  <br>Context is important</br>  <br>She won't understand the context though.</br>  <br><br>That mouth is certainly misplaces.</br></br>  Just send it to Aoi she is informed on all the dankest memes and will show the whole staff.  <br><br>Aoi is a meme expert. She'll explain it to her.</br></br>  <br> holds up her right hand in the air. <br>Totally a part of her and Shirabe's combined transformation, probably for when they've already fixed their LiNKER problem.</br></br>  Hibiki - Charm point<br>Chris - Zenbus and thighs.<br>Kirika - Panty shot<br>Tsubasa - :(<br><br>What are they going to give Shirabe and Maria?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is perfect.<br><br><br>Me too. Guess I'll leave what I was working on here in case Nana wills something again in the future.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> What's Aoi's twitter <br> I need it for reasons </br></br></br>  <br>It's not like Maria's realization was "oh, I guess we were doing the right thing all along". She changed what she was trying to do to match what she actually felt was right, not her beliefs about right and wrong themselves.</br>  <br><br>I guess it's possible that Nana has never seen the gaijin 4koma, but it's hard to believe. It's been around for a long time.</br></br>  <br>DE RP </br>  <br>Yeah that was disappointing but at least it appeared enough in the final episodes that they can bring it up again in GX. I'm actually digging how GX follows from G. I'm no longer bummed about Hibiki acting this way. Retroactively, it also kinda made Maria's weak will in G better since it's connected although it dragged on way too long for Maria. Hopefully, it only lasts until mid-season for Hibiki.</br>   2 idorus <br> 3 bags of luggage <br>They really expect me to believe this shit</br></br>  <br>Glad i'm not the only one who thought that. Nice to see some more alpha Maria around Tsubasa.  Looks like she meant it when she said she was going to have her way with Tsubasa </br>  I need help with what should be on the left.  <br>A sword doesn't need multiple dresses</br>  <br>Maria is useless and Tsubasa is a sword.</br>  <br>I hope it'll turn out that she's actually just putting on a tough front around Tsubasa. Derebasa is great and all, but I need my fill of useless moe as well.</br>  So what, was Maria staring at Tsubasa all the time during this 10+ hour flight from London to Japan?<br> I know I would be. </br>  <br><br>Looks pretty good.</br></br>  <br>Agreed<br> Maria confessing her love for Ogawa when </br></br>  <br> JIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIII~</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>   Hibiki loses compatibility with Gungnir <br> struggles with being useless while everyone else is fighting <br> DAINSLEIF GEAR <br><br>It's gonna happen.

So how many times this season do you think Maria is going to get to see naked sword?  <br><br>That's all Ogawa's stuff. Symphogears have hammerspace.</br></br>  <br>After some more character development?  Every night. </br>  <br>they glued it back together?</br>  <br>Maybe it grew back</br>  <br>That shit still makes no sense.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure she's used to seeing it anyway.</br></br>  <br>Probably watching to make sure she doesn't tsurugi herself in shame.</br>  <br><br>Nothing in this show makes sense.</br></br>  <br> it regenerate just like Hibiki's arm <br>More phonic gain can fix everything.</br></br>  HANASHI WO DA TO?  <br>And after character development she accepts both sides of her personality and transforms using both Gungnir and Dainsleif at the same time and goes full KnightBlazer.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>It seems they're actually making Maria act like a senpai this season.</br>  <br>Like this?<br><br><br>I did that at first, but it felt like such a waste to not do anything with the background.<br><br><br>Get out of my head Anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I don't disagree. Maria is one case but I'm curious about Hibiki now because what she's been saying and what she's been doing are already matched. They may share some similarities but they're still different. Hibiki has never hurt a person with her gear before right?</br>    <br>Tsurugi watch.</br>  <br>Well I mean seriously, the relic fragments did grow a lot inside of Hibiki's body. There is precedent.</br>  <br>I'm jealous, I want to stare at Tsubasa for hours too.</br>  <br>Now it just looks like there is no connection.<br>Should be just the bushinoise episode screenshot.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, my relic would grow inside hibiki too.</br>  <br>HAPPENING</br>  <br>Miku is experienced in destroying relics.</br>  <br>I still think it's better to  remove  Nana, unless you can make her has the similar pose as the gaijin.</br>  <br>Adding Anime Janai and friends to that as the foreground might work.</br>  <br><br>This is immensely adorable.</br></br>  <br>It should just be Nana's drawing on the left and JUST the parody on the right.</br>  <br>But anon, it's Maria who has to have the awesome fight.<br>DMJii are LiNKER plebs too but at least they were semi-useful in the past.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't that mean Hibiki could've been used as a Gungnir farm?</br>  <br>Not much bushinoise this ep though.</br>  <br><br>Maybe simple is best...</br></br>  <br>Make it naked Chris and Tsubasa side by side.</br>  <br>Might wanna edit them onto the real couch though.</br>  Watching my dolls kiss each other.  <br>This is immensely gay.</br>  <br><br>Actually nevermind, it's fine as is.</br></br>  <br>It cost them 3,000,000Y to use that drawing in the show.</br>  HS is upon us<br><br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/17/crunchyroll-starts-st<wbr>reaming-symphogear-gx-today</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> why is everyone so gay </br>  <br> use enemies as weapon farm <br>We Sidonia now.</br></br>  <br>Conflicting emotions</br>  <br><br><br>Wil u crie wen Garry die??</br></br></br>  <br> no more waiting for subs <br> no more memesubs <br>Based CR, though I still hate you.</br></br></br>  <br>I love you anon</br>  <br> Worldwide except Asia <br>Not really that worldwide.</br></br>  <br>Every night, I'd expect.</br>  <br> inb4songsleftunsubbed </br>  <br> Bikki   stored in a vat   forced to endlessly give birth   to inhuman monsters </br>  <br>But will they sub the songs? If they don't then I won't bother.</br>  <br> HS <br>+Simulcast so fast subs<br>-literally still no G officially so their audience of CR plebs will be lost<br>-No idea how their translation will be<br>-Songs?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>+possibly higher quality in the 1080p version</br></br>  <br>Fuck. RIP livewatch and nosubs threads.</br>  <br>Commie more or less make their lyric translations up, so I don't see how that matters. If you want song lyrics, you'll be waiting for H&amp;D either way.</br>  <br> I made these dolls <br> So why are they so gay? </br></br>  <br>Did you order the alchemist?</br>  <br>Yay, time to see the threads filled with retards that started the anime this season and keep asking stupid questions.</br>  <br>CR says the "simulcast" is at 1pm PT; so livewatch will still be about 2 hours early.</br>       that TCHH and those disappointed eyes after Hibiki's pacifism <br>Dolls are doing things to my dick again.</br>  <br>Powerful work</br>  <br>Shit, here I thought I was safe from doll fetishism with Rozen Maiden being a fading memory.<br>So much for that. Time to fuckadoll.</br></br>  <br>And a lot emptier.</br>  <br>I thought they stated it won't be simulcasted?</br>  What does Elfnein say ay 17:20? The name of the giant mechanism that's supposed to destroy the world I mean.<br><br> チフォウジュシャトウ <br><br>Is what I can pick up, but I have no clue what this is supposed to stand for.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt anyone in these threads right now who just livewatched will forgo livewatching the rest even with CR.</br>  This face is so silly  Private idol jet.  <br> so I don't see how that matters <br>If they translated the lyrics we wouldn't have to wait. Commie`s quality has nothing to do with it.</br></br>  Why didn't she use her hair instead?  <br>You realize we'll get the raws before the CR live.<br>We watch the livestream because we can't wait for our geahs.</br></br>  <br>You exaggerate, but I still think a lot of people will come to the livewatch anyway simply because it's more enjoyable that way.</br>  <br><br>She's very expressive for a doll. What's her face made of? Is it cloth? Skin and flesh? Phonic gain?</br></br>  <br>I know I will. You guys are too much fun.</br>  I almost feel like at this point watching Commie's shitty memesubs and then complaining about said memesubs is the only real way to watch Symphogear  <br>Rip the CR stream and then have H&amp;D publish sub files for the songs. Higher video quality and quicker.</br>   see this <br> You're Carol-chan's comrade, aren't you? <br>Sounded weird. Also, do they only go for guys with those draining kisses?</br></br>  <br>No, the proper way to watch Symphogear is to watch the livestream, then shitpost about Commie for almost a month while waiting for said memesubs.</br>  <br>Because they are aggresively straight</br>  <br>Is this your first anime period the live and raws are always hours before HS.</br>  <br>Its not cheating if its with a boy.</br>  <br>Hibiki only cares about the livings, not dead random corpses.</br>  <br>Gothloli with sexy dolljoints hands out kisses.<br>Kisses obviously so awesome people swoon.<br><br>Do you wind^H^H^H^Hkiss or do you not?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worth</br>  <br>I was expecting a little more disgust and anger after the good guys see what happened to innocent people. Sucks to be a nameless shmuck or american in this show.</br>  <br>In case you haven't noticed, H&amp;D has already given us non-meme subs for the first 2 episodes of GX.</br>  We will find out if the CR subs are shit or not in a couple hours.  <br>Isn't it only 30 minutes from now.......but only for episodes 1 and 2. 3 and 4 go up next week.</br>  <br>H&amp;D were surprisingly disappointing in ep2. All they have right now are the songs. If they keep this up, more and more people will stick with Commeme.</br>  <br>They've seen dead people and weird shit too many times now so no surprise there.</br>  <br>Did Love Live have the songs translated? If so then Symphogear would probably have them translated.</br>  <br>That's another thing. Now that we have a 3rd party I wonder how it will handle some of the more divisive lines (wild ride and have my way).</br>  <br>Hibiki is fucked up in the head. More news at 11.</br>  <br>Combine H&amp;D's song translations with HorribleSubs' CR rips?</br>  <br>We can do it. We can totally do it. Anon you're a genius!</br>  Is life at Lydian academy constantly in musical mode? Spending all of your days living in an academy full of lesbian and singing songs about stroganoff sounds like my idea of heaven.  Why is this show so good?<br>This series should be terrible but it's not<br>I don't understand</br></br>  <br> ....... <br>Stop doing this and it takes time to rip them after CR puts them up. <br><br><br><br>Everything in H&amp;D second release don't pretend to know Japanese when you barley know English.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can understand that but still. Those guards fought back. That one guy invaded privacy and had to be silenced. These guys just seemed like they were out for a walk and got killed. Seeing how Hibiki responded just made me a little sad for those guys. It did illustrate how Hibiki's way of thinking isn't really ordinary or healthy so there's that.</br>  <br>That's actually a good alternative.<br>However, we must still see if CR will translate the songs.</br></br>  <br>Has alchemy gone too far?</br>  <br>If CR is translating songs, it's likely they'd have the lyrics available where were H&amp;D has had to strain to hear what is being sung.</br>  <br>When you see enough weird shit and death stuff like that would stop phasing you.</br>  <br> always <br>Not really, especially with Tokyo MX being literally Hitler the first acceptable raw nowadays is from CR. 1h late simulcasts exist too, and in case you didn’t notice, Ohys took 2 hours today. <br><br>Live watch and early threads for episodes were better before this simulcasting madness took off, but of course there are many factors to this.</br></br></br></br>  What if Commie drops Symphogear after CR picks it up?  <br>It is a music school you know<br><br>Their society had been at war with the Noise for several years, Hibiki and co. are probably used to seeing people being randomly killed by now.</br></br></br>  <br> you barley know English <br>The irony.</br></br>  <br>Who knows whether CR translation will be good or not, though. I found their sub for Gakkou Gurashi disappointing.</br>   that entire animejanai insert song <br>nigger what</br>  <br> H&amp;D were surprisingly disappointing in ep2 <br>Wait what's wrong with their episode 2?</br></br>  <br>Don't question it. Embrace it.</br>  <br><br>I highly doubt that CR will translate the songs. Its rare for them to even translate the lyrics of the OP and ED. They generally only do that on catalog titles, and inconsistently at that.<br><br>For example, CR's subs of Gurren Lagann seem to alternate each episode between translating and transliterating the lyrics of the OP, but they don't sub any of the insert songs.<br><br>Pretty sure I've never seen CR sub an insert song.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BIIFU SUTUROGANOFU</br>  <br>It would be the happiest of news simply because the sub drama would leave the Symphogear threads.</br>  <br>The songs are central to Symphogear and take up a large portion of the "dialog", not subbing them would be suicide.</br>  <br>It would feel so wrong. Complaining about Commie has been a staple of these threads since the beginning.</br>  <br>Not like it hasn't happened before</br>  So why did Carol order Phara to retreat instead of killing Tsubasa and Maria? She doesn't seem too serious about killing the Gears.<br><br>She could have taken out Hibiki, Tsubasa and Maria by now. Instead she's being all mopey and pissed.<br><br><br>Fucking awesome</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No there will still be drama, people would just move on to complaining about CR's translations</br>  <br>Seems like she's happy just to break their relics.</br>  <br>It would be considerable more tame though.</br>  <br> 2 seasons of only complaining about Commie <br> now get a season of complaining about 3 different subs because no one gets it 100% the way each individual thinks the subs go <br>This will be a great season.</br></br></br>    <br>Carol said she didn't want to attract attention.</br>  <br>At least now we can figure out the meaning though triangulation.</br>  <br>From who? Garie is murdering people in broad daylight.</br>  <br>Yeah, but they are menfolk. That's no big deal. Murder a cute singing songstress and it's the end of the fucking world.</br>  <br>Garie didn't really follow her order. Besides, if you kill everyone then there would be no witness, yes?</br>  <br>not if you don't clean up the bodies.</br>  Does anyone here have a CR account? I won't judge you too hard, but you can be the scout and tell us how the subs look.  <br>Doesn't matter, if you just leave the scene before more people arrives then it's all good.</br>  <br>Aoi is a gift from nature beyond even 2.5D, maybe closer to 2.2D.</br>  <br>Is it even out yet?</br>  <br>Garie also claimed she was caught up being subtle about who she drains so no one catches them. Then they cut to showing a pile of drained biker gang guys on the ground.<br><br>She's just lying through her teeth to Carol.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, probably not. I can't think of any other good examples, but as I recall, Valvrave's livewatches were just as active even after CR picked up S2.</br>  <br>Should be in like 10 minutes.</br>  <br>Even so, what's the point? Who do they need to hide from? Is alchemy weak to guns?</br>  <br> Carol said she didn't want to attract attention. <br>When did she say that?</br></br>  <br>HS will be out soon. No need to rush.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised at all if she was just using it as an excuse, Carol doesn't seem like she has the guts to follow through.</br>  <br>I HATE IT</br>  <br>Dicks.</br>  <br>Here, have some more.</br>  <br>When Leiur asked her whether she should pursue DMJii or not.</br>  <br>So Carol is all talk and relies on her dolls because they have more courage than her?</br>  <br>I guess she doesn't want to get caught on TV and then needs to go into hiding like Maria in G.</br>  Welp  <br>How much time does she even spend in public? I kind of doubt she attends a local school.</br>  <br>What the fuck</br>  <br><br> tired of me <br><br>Is this a line from the show?<br><br>I see it in a lot of Tsubasa art</br></br></br></br></br></br>  CR translated songs. I'm definitely surprised.  <br>Is it really happening?</br>    <br>I know you didn't ask for it, but here's some more</br>  <br>This seriously doesn't flow well at all, jesus.</br>  <br>What's about Glorious Break?</br>  <br>Post some gays of other ships.</br>  <br><br><br><br>IT'S HAPPENING</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's even more surprising than the fact that both episodes they already have up are available to people without accounts.</br>  <br><br>Did CR just win the sub war!?</br></br>  <br>I like it</br>    <br>You have gotta be kidding me. No one is this stupid</br>  <br>Haha.</br>  <br>Only if they grab G and the OVAs.</br>  <br>That's retarded</br>  <br>EXTERMINATE, Rebirth Day, and Glorious Break have no subs.</br>  What do the song translations look like in ep 2? Curious to see how they compare, especially Chris's, since it's mostly inaudible in the episode.  <br> Post some gays of other ships. <br>Anon she's a sword not a boat. Respect her identity crisis.</br></br>  I'm sticking with Commie for the  styles .  <br>ALPHA MARIA IS REAL</br>  <br>It seems so, but until I can see it with my own eyes I will remain skeptical</br>  Stream &gt; Raw &gt; HS &gt; Comeme &gt; H&amp;D<br><br>That's how I plan to watch now.</br></br>  <br>ib4 it's because they spoil later episodes</br>  <br> Sub the insert songs <br> Doesn't sub OP/ED <br>What a heresy.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually; character songs are NOT subbed, but Radiant Force and Galaxy Cross are. I don't understand.</br>  <br>The mental image of someone as tiny as Aoi playing basket is adorable.</br>  This must be some kind of joke  <br> character songs are NOT subbed <br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br>  <br>What does spoiler have to do with anything? <br><br><br>Guess H&amp;D is still necessary then.</br></br></br></br>  Commie's subs are still the best  Did anyone else pop a boner when watching this episode?  <br>I pop a boner on each show I watch, Of course I did.</br>  Who doesn't pop a boner when they're trying to masturbate?  <br>Only the lowest of plebs would be aroused by something so blatant and cheap.</br>  <br>I have no sex drive right now</br>    <br>Nope.</br>  Yes.  My dick is so small I can't really tell.  <br>No, because I'm a girl.</br>  <br> Year of the lord Jesus Christ 2015 <br> not being a Futanari <br><br>Your loss.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying girls don't pop boners </br>  <br>Girl's don't have dicks?</br>  <br>must be nice being 12yo again ;_;</br>  <br>I'm still annoyed this didn't get a proper animation job. I guess the rotoscoping makes it creepy and more lifelike, but I wanted it to be good. The manga turned to shit anyway so never mind. Moral of the story - if you do something fucked up at age 14, you'll automatically mature by the time you're 17 and find the one.</br>  <br>A what?</br>  <br>Yes, because I'm a guy.</br>  <br>There a girls that can pop 4-6 inch clitoris dicks.

Which translation is correct?  <br>this didn't but the manga did</br>  <br>manga shows her as a slut<br>anime shows her as a closet slut</br></br>  <br>Meticulously handcrafted translations with the ancient forgotten art of fansubbing vs. CashgRab highspeed payperview subs</br>  <br>The funny part is that French CR had almost the same translation as the manga. DameDesuYo is close to English CR though.<br>I don't know anymore.</br></br>  <br>Maybe DDY is just following the ancient art of "doiz-subbing" where you take the CR script and change small things in every 2nd sentence to feel important.</br>  <br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This guy looks like a badass.</br></br>  I didn't.

But I guess I'll come back and apply what I've learnt.</br></br>  Requesting a giantess Super Sonico squeezing a tiny Misaki Nakahara between her tits!  Requesting Hibiki Tachibana from Symphogear and Madoka Kaname from Madoka Magica doing the Sekiha Love Love Tenkyoken  <br>absolutely disgusting<br><br>I must ask why?</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but why wouldn't you want a sexy milf Illya? Although I guess that would probably just be Irisviel.</br>  <br>Well, there you have them. What do you want them to do?</br>  Requesting Sakurako and Himawari from Yuru Yuri in another of their little fights, with both in swimsuits (artists choice from ref sheet), with Sakurako leaning forward a bit and wearing a smug-ass grin, having just shoved Himawari down front-first into an oversized wet dessert cream pie, with Himawari looking surprised/humiliated/shocked and soaked swimsuit and all in the pie cream.  Requesting a color of this. Here's a reference: http://i.imgur.com/BJgeLG8.jpg  Requesting a combination of Silver Crow and Silver Karasu's outfits  Coming upon a clearing in the woods  while wearing a hooded cloak  <br> In the clearing is one is one of these gods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cernu<wbr>nnos https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieli<wbr>kki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudra<wbr> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapio<wbr>_%28spirit%29 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekke<wbr>itsertok or cute Artemis and/or Diana </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Does she ever come across any sort of danger or in contact with another person? I'm actually curious</br>  The general seems so much more peaceful right now.  <br>Probably because everyone moved to the WWD.</br>  <br>Pretty much.<br>Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu?</br></br>  <br>Honestly I kind of wish I could move my requests from the WWD to the general, even if I could I don't want double dipping shitposting because all the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week.</br>  This poster from Hostel 1 but with Shion from Higurashi holding the chainsaw and wearing that mask. Make sure she is wearing the attached maid outfit. <br><br>It says:<br>“Ni-Pah!” <br>-Rika <br><br>Ryukishi7 presents:<br>"Higurashi"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The general is the best during the weekends.</br>  <br> Could you draw some more cute/lewd lolis in the meantime, Heikatsu? <br>Sure thing! I can try to draw some stuff later today when I'm less busy.<br><br> the meta shit from that thread drags into the general during the week. <br>The WWD is kind of awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was one of the people who told you you'd be better off doing deliveries in the general where you'll probably be appreciated more for what you were delivering there. <br><br>How's it been working out for you anyway?</br></br></br>  <br> So close. </br>  <br>awesome, man. I'll look forward to it.</br>  Requesting Louise walking funny after spending the night with Thickus Dickus and Biggus Dickus  Requesting moe maids! Tripping over, spilling water, soda, etc while screaming KYAAAA GOMEN NASAI  Now that I think about it, a maid cafe with different anime gals would be nice...  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128225109 <br>Get my tabs mixed up, every time.</br>  <br>Well  yeah .  From this point on I want her to run into more people, interact with various deities and mythical creatures.  I've got an end in mind.  </br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute swimsuits kissing underwater like in Sakura Trick  <br>Cool, I wonder if you ever thought of her running into other yurus</br>  <br>Yeah that will definitely happen  as long as artist stay interested heheh </br>  <br>Well I have to say that I've been enjoying the work people put into your requests. Hope enough drawdudes are still interested in finish it!</br>  <br>I've been lucky that some really talented people have been picking them up. And thanks so do I</br>  Hey OR, just wanted to let you know that I'm working on this, is taking longer than I expected but I'm quite busy and I'm trying not to rush, otherwise it wouldn't be as good  Requesting Yamcha and Maron cuddling together.  <br>Holy shit, those details.<br>Not OR, but good going.</br></br>  <br> going nuts on the goggles <br><br>I understand, metal stuff is fun to paint.</br></br></br>   tfw when the best request you got from this drawthread was of a character you eventually despised   <br> While bulma isn't looking. </br>  <br>With gape and cum drip still in effect.</br>  <br>Sweet mother of god! Take as much time as you need, that looks absolutely perfect!</br>  Requesting Snail and Bat in extremely skimpy bikinis like the girls on the left have.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/7NGI7jF.jpg</br></br>  <br>I get the superslut part, but the milf?</br>  <br><br>Okay finally back, heres one I did while testing some new brush settings. <br><br><br>Posting more in the general? Worked out fine I guess.</br></br></br></br></br>  Ep. 2 is out in all of its censored glory.<br><br>Also, remember to thank translator-kun for chapter 184. <br><br>Previous thread: </br></br></br></br>  With everything I've seen here hana seems to end up with kiyoshi?<br>What happens to chiyo?</br>  <br>He grew up in prison and emerged from it as a man.</br>  <br>Manga hasn't ended. Some stuff happens with chiyo but nothing to write home about</br>  <br>Nothing's set yet.  But Hana's pretty proactive and best girl. </br>  <br>The right answer is all of them. Someone should compile all those Hana faces</br>  Tosh should really start giving out character designs to other mangaka. It's a shame for some of these to not be main characters of their own series.  I like it.  <br>This, in comparison the Boku no Hero Academia tournament started at chapter 21 (or something like that) and was finished by chapter 38. That was plenty to get a background on a couple of characters and other storylines going, the SnS arc was pure terror. I'm glad I started reading when it was ending</br>  <br>Well I agree, most matches were the same lasting 3-4 chapters each with some lasting even more. Shit was stretch out as all hell but Japan sure fucking love it.</br>  <br> you do know that's the most common wound on children right? <br><br>a scraped knee?<br><br><br> every single fucking detail of every single fucking dish <br><br>Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'd imagine a typical sex session for these two starts off with some light BDSM where normal-mode Kurokiba is tied up with his headband used as a blindfold, and Alice teases his dick until he cums pathetically by himself.<br><br>After which, she goes to adjust the headband to let him see how worthless his dick is, but accidentally pulls it back too tight and triggers berserker-mode. <br><br>Kurokiba then rips out of his bindings through sheer strength, picks up Alice and throws her on the bed, proceeding to fuck her rawdog for 3 rounds nonstop. By the time he puts three loads in her, the headband comes loose and falls off, ending the session with Alice cuddling under his arm and complaining about how her butt hurts now.<br><br>Ryo then apologizes to Alice for his rough actions and goes to make her a cup of tea.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Did Atem actually do anything useful as Pharoah or did he just sit around playing card games all day?  <br>This fukken gui</br>  he killed zorc<br><br>that's more than enough</br></br>  <br>He saved us from Zorc's giant donger.</br>  <br>They actually were.</br>  <br>They were. We've found ancient egyptian contracts and such. Not only that, but it was also apparently a good time aside from that. You were fed, had access to fun and whores, all that other good stuff. Plus working on the pyramids bought you brownie points with Anubis and helped you get into the GOOD afterlife.<br>Hell, even if they had jewslaves at the times, which I doubted. They would've probably taken the women for whores and kept the men as far away from their holy monument as possible.<br>Imagine if the US slave states got a message that said:<br> Dear Americans, <br> Here's a blueprint for a holy structure. If you build it, anyone who touches it and their families get a free pass into heaven. <br> Love you all, <br> God <br><br>Would they really waste free heaven on the negro slaves?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the Lain opening so comfy?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=t9C<wbr>XmEUwvgM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I really puts the series into perspective.</br>  <br><br><br>you should listen to the singers solo project. her name is Jasmine Rodgers.</br></br></br>  <br>HQ Version: https://d.maxfile.ro/zdpuwxbyfc.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>Im not sure if Im liking this</br>  <br>Went to faux.neocities to send the songs, noticed she had updated them. NO idea what they are called :(. Atleast i have a few new songs to listen to</br>  Chapter 51 chinascans: http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>271<br>Chapter 51 TLfag translation:  <br>Chapter 51 FA translation: http://famatg.com/2015/07/16/update<wbr>-my-hero-academia-chapter-51-eng/<br><br>FA is shit as always. <br>You know you're terrible when some random guy from 4chan does a better translation by himself than an entire team of dedicated translators. What the hell is this shit?</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr>  <br>Yea and Iida will probably be okay with it if he knew Deku had One For All. But he doesn't.</br>  <br>Deku, something something, "never giving up", something, OTP.</br>  <br>Iida is going to hate Deku from here on out, that's why Deku regretted not saying more to him back then.</br>  <br>Everyone thinks that One for All is just a basic physical buff, just really fucking strong, like Akira's violent mode from Kongou Bancho-tier strong. Name of ability doesn't matter and Deku will probably show the result of training in the next chapter already so Iida will see it.<br><br>I don't think he will just live in Deku's shadow, most likely it will motivate him to get better with his own ability and train it to the utmost potential.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably motivate him to join the dark side in exchange for power.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprise if Stain will be like follow me and I'll make you strong enough to defeat me and Iida going with him.</br></br></br>  Have you forgiven him yet?  <br>Backstabbing juden scum.</br>  <br>Do you really think the creator would make this guy his self insert?</br>   2015 <br> people still mad at him </br>  <br>OHGI DID NOTHING WRONG</br>  <br>Pretty sure he wouldn't be able to brainwash someone even if he wanted to.</br></blockquote>]
