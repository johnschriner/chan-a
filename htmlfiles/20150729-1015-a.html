Why the hell would I want to sacrifice all that sweet cock for you ungrateful idiots?</br>  <br>this isn't moot<br><br>moot please come back</br></br></br>    What is wrong with this child?  <br>Maybe her butt hurts?</br>    <br>From what?</br>  ITT shit that pisses you off in anime<br> Please take responsibility </br>  <br>Yeah, maybe your boss or your coworkers. But your friends and classmates? Come on.</br>  <br> morals committee <br> exists at all <br><br>This</br></br></br></br>   MC enjoys living and doesnt realize how pointless life is   <br> but I find it hard to believe that you don't have any relations where it's uncomfortable to call people by their first name. <br>I don't. <br>I can think of no scenario where I would be uncomfortable or anything like it by just saying their first name.<br>Not to say I don't address some people by Mr. X or Dr. X but it's more for them in case they'd feel offended or such, rather than me not liking to be casual with them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know how in some parts of the world swearing a vendetta against someone is extremely serious, but we throw it around as a joke here? That's kinda what the "I'll never forgive you" thing is for Japan</br>  Why do anime constantly feel the need to bring up western continental philosophers? The writers bringing up their misinterpretation of a Heidegger quote does not make a show any deeper.  <br>Because from a Japanese perspective, the philosophy seems foreign and cool. From our perspective it looks stupid, but we are not the target audience.</br>  <br> an Antichrist is just anyone that doesn't believe in or tries to draw people away from God <br>I thought it was some guy that was supposed to come 1000 years before the reign of god to destroy the earth of whatever.<br>I might have watched too much anime.</br></br></br>  I don’t understand! I don’t understand a single word you say! I don’t understand what’s good about the things you call good! I don’t understand! I can’t understand.<br>What’s so cool about “bloody”? I don’t like blood. Bleeding just hurts!<br>What’s so cool about “madness”? I don’t understand what’s good about being crazy!<br>What do you mean by “sinful”? What’s so good about having sin? Is it cool being a criminal?<br>And what’s with “chaos”, anyway? Chaos? What about it? What about “darkness”? You want it to be dark?<br>Between justice and evil, why is evil better? Why do you prefer evil? Isn’t it evil because it’s wrong?<br>What’s so cool about your right arm aching?<br>“I love the feeling of being unable to control my power”? What’s that? That just makes you a fool!<br>It’s much cooler when you have control! That’s worthy of respect! What’s so awesome about hiding your power all the time? That’s just slacking off! It’s much cooler to face things head-on at full strength without hiding anything!<br>Why do you give everything nicknames and aliases? Having so many different names only makes them hard to keep up with!<br>Don’t use English or katakana for everything!<br>I can’t remember those!<br>Don’t write “elegy” and read it “requiem”!<br>Don’t write “forbidden” and read it “taboo”!<br>Don’t write “holy war” and read it “jihad”!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Greek mythology, the Bible, Norse mythology, Japanese mythology, don’t start talking about them just because you did a little research!<br>If you don’t properly explain it, I can’t understand what you mean! If you’re going to teach me, teach me right! Listening to explanations about mythological weapons is not fun!<br>Gungir, Loginus, Excalibur, Durandal and Ama-noMurakumo-no-Tsurugi all mean nothing to me! I don’t understand what’s cool about them!<br>All your other terminology is confusing too! Original Sin, Ten Commandments, Book of Genesis, Book of Revelations, Armageddon…what do you mean by “their names are cool”?<br>It’s impossible for me to “feel it by their atmosphere”!<br>Relativity, Schrodinger’s Cat, universal gravitation, don’t act like you understand them because you read a little on the net! I can’t understand them at all if you give half-baked explanations!<br>Do not quote Nietzsche or Goethe! When you start quoting people I don’t know, I can’t understand what you’re trying to say at all!<br>Talk to me in your own words! I’m begging you; speak so I can understand you!<br>What is “chuuni”? What does “chuuni” mean?<br>I don’t understand, I don’t understand, I don’t understand, I don’t understand!<br>I don’t understand a single word you’ve ever said at all!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Continental philosophy is trash anyway, so its fitting they use it as window dressing since that's all it is at its most basic level.</br></br>  Which SCP would you fug.  Can you fuck a box of pizza?<br>Because 458 is best SCP.</br>  <br>173 is damn scary.<br><br>And disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone whose favorite pizza place closed down several years ago, I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>Fuck, why cant that be real?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-458<br><br>Also, SCP anime would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never carry out Procedure 110-Montauk   Why do they call it a motorrad?<br>It's clearly a motorcycle.<br>Fucking japs I swear.</br></br>  Are you trying to be funny, anon?

Friendly reminder that Gainax not only gave birth to modern day anime and manga, but also created other animation studios that are prominent to date that YOU love.<br><br>Gainax has not only gave /a/ 70% of content to talk about it also helped revolutionize animation in Japan.<br><br>TL;DR, if you don't like Gainax, you're a fucking retard. Now please bow to me and tell me how right I am.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gainax's influence has basically ceased to matter at this point. Gainax itself been garbage for five years, Gonzo for over a decade, Khara is just wasting what talent they have on Anno's shitty vanity project, and Trigger's too hung-up on being ironically retarded to make anything good. I guess Gokumi's decent, if you count them, but that's pushing it.</br>  <br>Trigger is good but has disappointing low budget. Khara is good but has disappointing shit CGI. We'll have to wait until they do something besides Eva though</br>  <br>The good ones.</br>  <br>FLCL<br>Eva<br>Honneamise<br>TTGL<br>Nadia</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FLCL<br>Gunbuster<br>Eva<br>TTGL<br>P&amp;S</br></br></br></br></br>  Bikini Warriors ep. 4<br>Subs soon</br>  <br>Any shot of the dog licking her pussy?</br>  <br> Queen's Blade was shit. </br>  <br>True, but I think 30min of Bikini Warriors would be a little bit different, it has no plot and doesn't need one. Ypu just need to be vaguely familiar with JRPG stereotypes, and that's enough.</br>  So is this AOTS or AOTY<br><br>I vote AOAT</br></br>  <br>She just please women you piece of Idiot</br></blockquote>]
