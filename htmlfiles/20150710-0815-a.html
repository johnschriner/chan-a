[ Sidonia thread<br><br>because third gender from the future &gt;&gt;&gt; Tranies from now</br></br>  <br>Gauna are not trannies.... are they?</br>  I have a theory to why the gaunas are so determined on finding sidonia.<br> They want to destroy it, so Tanikaze will have no one elso to give the D, but the gauna.<br>You know this is true, you harem fucks!</br> </br>  <br> the d <br>thats not how you say kabi and biggs</br></br>  <br> biggs <br>thats not how you spell Wedge</br></br>  <br>I find the harem aspect of this show to be nonapealing.<br><br>Did Tanikaze give Izana the D?<br>Will we ever find out?<br>Fuck the non-moving relationship plot .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shit, all those girls are lightinings clones!</br></br>  <br>Shit shit shit shit shit shit</br>  Bump,  <br><br>Is it wrong if I can't stand these special snowflakes with hir/xir pronouns and whatnot... but Izana makes my dick harder than tungsten?<br><br>I cannot understand this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  Good old America. She'd never let Japan go it alone.  What would actually happen: lip-service and missiles pointed at Japan and then a take-over of things when things become profitable  <br>No, if this show wasn't the Japanese sucking their own martial cock that US (and NATO or UN) would have completely taken over the gate and any investigations</br>  <br> president is blonde haired and blue eyed <br>We haven't had all that many Presidents who were blonde. Most of we did have went gray by the time they were President or during their presidency. Does Japan not think Americans can have black or brown hair?</br></br>  <br>Soon afterwards. America invades japan and takes over land that the portal is on. <br><br>Imperialism is back baby. Time to colonise and spread freedom to this new land.</br></br></br>  <br>Except Japan treats this matter as a domestic problem.</br>  <br> What is Russia <br> What is China <br>It's like you're an Ameritard, unaware of other powers.</br></br></br>  <br>To America, there's no such thing as domestic. What if there are terrorists in the gate?</br>  <br>which is ridiculous. if the US would do this in a Hollywood film people would call it bullshit and rightfully so.</br>  <br> What is Russia <br> What is China <br><br>a bunch of white niggers and a bunch of dog eaters</br></br></br></br>  America wouldn't invade through the Gate unless there were already American companies exploiting the other side and they started bitching about uppity natives.<br><br>If anything liberals would insist on studying their culture, importing their criminals, and moving there to be tree hugging hippies.</br></br>  I will choke if this gets censored.  <br>The US would never be in such a position in a Hollywood movie though, precisely because the US always needs to be the protag or maybe antag if in some indie role reversal movie but still never some on the sidelines or a side character.</br>     Not a smart phone   NNB is set in 1986.  <br>Shouldn't it be one of those giant brick phones then?</br>  <br>Hikage is just ahead of her time.</br>  <br>So Komari is 43 now. I wonder if she's gone through puberty yet?</br>  <br><br><br>I don't care.

I just can't let it slide. What a shame.</br>  <br>Unable to confess, he is gifted by a deus ex machina with the girl's phone number?</br>  There is a manga where she is the main character, right?  <br>A boy falls in love with a girl.<br><br>Unable to confess, he is gifted by a deus ex machina with the girl's phone number. Never minding the strange area code, he immediately calls her, and is overjoyed to find out that she has a crush on him as well.<br><br>But, the next day, when he recounts the previous day's confessions to the girl, she only looks at him with a perplexed expression. After some investigation, he finds out that the girl he called is not the same girl he fell in love with. In fact, she doesn't exist in this universe at all. She is the girl's alternate universe counterpart, who has fallen in love with the MC's own AU self, who too is blissfully unaware of her crush.<br><br>Hijinks ensue as the two strike up a deal to give each other their darkest, most private secrets in order to equip the other with the weapons they need to conquer the heart of their other selves. While the two chase their respective loved ones, DRAMA ensues as they begin to fall in love with each other instead and question the NATURE of LOVE.<br><br>Now with its own OP: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4NS<wbr>hEKYoPXw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop forcing this.</br></br>  <br>Yep. For a while I thought calling texts emails in subs was a translation quirk, but jap phones actually do use email as their means of operation and have done for years.</br>  <br>I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.</br></br></br>  <br>email's also more efficient than sms.

It seems to be taking place simultaneously as the first season, the first episode actually takes place before s1.</br>  <br>Fucking shit this was the first thing that came to my mind when I saw OP's pic.</br>  <br>It's not.

Even if it's about the objectively worst and/or best musical instrument of all time. And if anon was trying to make a joke about it being a recording device, then he's just as stupid. And if it was post-irony making fun of the fact that people might think that recording didn't exist at that time, then he should just go back to reddit or wherever post-memeing is big.</br>  <br>The recorder is a type of flute whether you think it is or not.</br>  <br>Calm down.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LGm<wbr>_lCNbEdc</wbr>  [ ]  Jesus Christ the autism in this thread is reaching Renge's level.  <br>NO.

Gate is a Japanese power fantasy and Jitsu is a shitty youkai high school harem I've seen thousands of when I was 12.</br></br></br>  <br>thank you.</br>  <br> Fapping to nothing but foreplay </br>  Papifags&gt;Rachnerafags=Snekfags=Slim<wbr>fags&gt;Horsefuckers = Smithfags &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NTR defenders</wbr>  <br>Oh ok.<br><br>Thanks I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude at least make him bait the hook. You shame us all with your antics, benji</br>  <br>You have to admit though MonMusu isnt all that original either if you're gonna shit on Jitsu its better to be honest on both fronts. Aside from the monstergirl aspect and the above average humorous moments its nothing too special</br>   that shot with Miia's snek fangs and lips while drooling  <br>I want to make love to Miia</br>  <br> Gate is a Japanese power fantasy <br>Gate is a fucking nationalist shit, but is fun, at least the novel. <br><br> Jitsu is a shitty youkai high school harem <br>Ok now you confirmed you're one of those secondaries, it is a fucking comedy and nothing more than that, the manga designs and reaction faces are the strong point of that but the adaptation go full moeshit and ruined everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  So, how can a small tail even grip the Button and Zipper to even undo them?  <br><br>What about  Lalafags? </br></br>  <br>Would you fuck Miia anon?</br>  <br>I'm surprised anyone even remembers Lala considering how unused she is...</br>  <br>2 can play at this game</br>  <br>That's like trying to make a population survey with a sample size of 3 people<br>Its too fucking small to make a distinction on</br></br>  <br>Shh, we already know she won, let the younglings have their fun.</br>  <br>You never see a snake in action anon? snakes usually use their tails to grab shit or helping themselves to move around things, is like the tail of a monkey just even more stronger.</br>  My penis hurts.  <br>I wonder how many people obsessed with this have even touched a snake in real life.</br>  <br>But can they pull down zippers?</br>  <br>They're not dextrous enough to undo a button and zipper</br>  <br>Never claimed it was.<br><br>Won't argue with you on Gate. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it, it's fun ride, it just lost me when the JSDF took down all those foreign special ops teams. As for Jitsu, you're full of shit if you think its main appeal isn't the harem of cute girls. Most harems rely on comedy as a backup like Jitsu does.</br></br></br>  <br>  tumblr <br>this reminds me of that SJW that drew the Love Live cast as how would look if they were real girls as in "disgusting" and affraif it will happen the same with monmusu</br></br>  <br>It didn't grip the button.<br><br>It just popped the button out of the buttonsleevethingamajigger.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a Miiafag and have kept snakes since I was a little kid.<br><br> No, I haven't fucked them. </br></br></br>  <br>I have, they're colder then you think, not exactly a turn on.<br><br>If they were naturally warm that's a different matter.</br></br></br>  <br>PapixFuta Suu doujins when</br>  <br>A fucking anaconda can even get you naked if you don't know how to deal with them, but instead of grab your dick they must kill you in a painfully way.</br>  <br>And the Zipper?</br>  <br>Basically, it means "go read the fucking manga first and then come talk to us afterwards". Also for all those secondaries lurking, its for your own good since most of the discussions here contain spoilers.  We're doing these for your sake </br>  <br>Nigger the girls on Jitsu aren't enjoyable, actually they sucks. Only akane is the only important girl there, dumpire and robot are fucking shit.</br>  <br>But it'd be like the cold side of a pillow on a lamia<br>And the feel of the muscle underneath is relaxing and mesmerising as fuck</br></br>  <br>You realised you don't need to grip the tag to pull down a zipper, right? It's just easier on the hands than pushing the zipper down manually. Scaly tail has no worries like that.</br>  <br>Tumblr has it's uses when if comes to images.<br><br>At least for me.</br></br></br>  <br> special ops <br>That's where you're wrong. US sent in CIA, China sent in MSS and Russia sent in a team I forgot about.<br><br>If the US sent in DEVGRU nippon would've been absolutely shat on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "go read the fucking manga first and then come talk to us afterwards". <br><br>This only apply to the retards who only comes here to shitpost and nothing more, out there exist secondaries who actually have manners and ask things without going full retarded. Those exceptions are welcome here.</br></br></br>  <br>Chunii don't get much love</br>    <br>Anon you don't understand. I'll make enough babies with her to start a new village and then some. Until I need to hire a personal X-Ray and MRI technician for all of my broken ribs and stretched muscles.</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>Ah, thanks for correcting me anon.</br>  <br>I swear it's so hard for me to find a good gif of that Mio picture.</br>  <br>do you actually own a pair of pants with a zipper on it?</br>  <br>He can't have sex with the girls. Why watch a show about a man with blue balls?</br>  <br> Mio </br>  <br>Yeah I do, and it's a bitch for me to pull down without using my thumb.<br><br>So how the fuck did she do it that quick?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Still have<br><br> Shiho <br> Akari <br> Karen </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mio <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair though, posters like autism-san will start crying about "m-muh secondaries" even to those that politely ask questions. But still  Just read the fucking manga </br>  <br>Yeah, that's her name.</br>  So why does the government hate them having sex but Lamias can abduct men?  I dont understand people that refuse to read the manga of an anime. I mean if you enjoy the anime and want more, read the manga, it takes way less time than watching an anime. <br><br><br>If you're talking about Miia then im sorry youre retarded. If you're talking about someone else then specify.</br></br></br>  <br> Reading anything with current crabman proportions in it </br>  <br>actually when I tell them to go read them manga I'm recomending it, as a good thing to read, not telling them to fuck off, is not just easy to read and follow, it's fun</br>  <br>I think they said Lamias are not allowed to do that at one point.</br>  <br><br>See my post at . Using your thumb is actually counter-productive, it'd be like yanking both sides 90 degrees to the vertical and trying to unzip. You want the zipper to be taught and as parallel as possible. She's just that good at unzipping pants.<br><br>Also it could just be that Darling's pants have easier zippers because they're old.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondary is the worst meme tbh</br>  <br><br>They can't.</br></br>  <br>The reason Miia is out in the human world in the first place is so that she can seduce a man to bring back to their harem. The government said they can't abduct men for their sex prisons anymore so they need willing volunteers.</br>  <br> That law only lasts a few chapters </br>  <br><br>The blue haired girl in yellow background in the image in the post he is referencing is called Mio you fucks.</br></br>  <br> tbh <br><br/></br></br>  <br> not "cuck" or pepe <br>mememaster here, those two are as of 2015 the worst.</br></br>  <br>Mio, the name of the girl in the picture.<br><br>God, go watch some fucking Nichijou.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I said if he's talking about someone else he should specify.<br><br> Watch Nichijou  <br><br>how about you fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I shouldn't like this as much as I do. I really shouldn't. But I do.</br>  <br>It's a pretty good show and an underrated KyoAni gem</br>  <br>How about you watch a good anime fag?</br>  <br>How about the idea that I dont watch anime fag?<br><br> Except Monmusu cause I like the manga quite a bit. </br></br></br>  <br> secondaries <br>Don't be like FSN fags.</br></br>  I can wait until the MON squad chapter is adapted. And then all the animeonlyfags that think Miia is best girl will realize the true best Monster girl that is Zombina. They will she how fucking amazing she is.<br><br>Though I feel bad for all the Miiafags because she really turns into a irrelevant shitty character as the series progresses.</br></br>  <br>14 yr olds pls.</br>  <br>Well assuming you watched Monster Musume's anime that's a start I guess...</br>  <br><br> The wrapped tail looks like the end of a maggot </br></br>  So can we all agree that Team Mon deserves their own spinoff?    Threadly reminder to take a moment to imagine what paizuri with Cathyl would be like.  <br>Paizuri is shit. It's almost less enjoyable than a handjob.</br>  <br>This</br>    Why is Papi already in the short videos?  <br>Because she's best girl.</br>  <br>Is that a new one? Mind posting a webm please?</br>  <br>What short videos? Where'd you find them?</br>  <br>To cute</br>    <br>It must feel amazing.<br><br><br><br>Clearly you've never had a proper one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Paizuri is shit <br><br>Confirmed for not having it done in real life. Anon one of the best things you can have in this world is a titjob, especially if the chick giving it to you has huge soft racks.</br></br></br>  <br>They're out every day<br> ch.nicovideo.jp/monmusu <br>Too bad that each video is only available for 24 hr</br></br></br>  <br>So how old is the kid in this like 5?</br>  <br>I used to think it was clever that the kids in those imagination things looked just like little versions of Cerea and Miia, thinking it was making fun of their dreams. Then I saw that their moms look just like them so it's no longer clever.</br>  <br><br><br>50<br><br>POUNDS</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off horse fucker.</br>    <br>Eh, I don't know how to do a webm, and I'm too lazy to learn about it.

Does Papi have a normal human type vagina or does she have a cochlea?</br>  <br>Oh of fucking course anon.<br><br>When the pv came out i thought it was quite good, when the first episode came out i had that song in my dreams, so catchy.</br></br></br>  <br> "ANON I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME MY TIT BACK YOU'LL REGRET IT! NOT ONLY AM I EXTENSIVELY TRAINED IN ARMED COMBAT, BUT I HAVE ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE ARSENAL OF MON AND I WILL USE IT TO ITS FULL EXTENT TO WIPE YOUR MISERABLE ASS OFF THE FACE OF THE CONTINENT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!" </br>  How can people like cuckfish?<br><br>Bondagespider and rapeslime best girls</br></br>  <br><br>HEY DARLING Is the best part of that op.<br><br>I also like the ED too.

Part of me wants to say the music itself reminded me of Limp Bizkit, but I don't want to associate MonMu with anything that shit.</br></br>  <br> &gt;you will never hear a bunch of f/a/ggots sing the monsume OP </br>  <br> Tragedy fetish is cuckolding <br><br>please stop tarnishing Mero, she's innocent.</br></br></br>  <br>Her abdomen/pelvis area seems to be human so i assume it's just normal.

It was tokyo-mx, right? All the raws I can find on Nyaa or TT are AT-X only though.  <br>tell that to the guystickinghindickinasnake.webM</br>  <br>Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a pair of tits for sale in this economy, much less a single left tit? And since it's illegal to kidnap random women and slice their boobs off, Zombina must have one hell of a time finding new ones.

But those tits are always nice.<br>Also as a person with a weakness for tall girls, the fact that an anon did the pixels-to-centimeters converter and found out that Cathyl is 8'6" including her horns pleases me greatly.</br></br>  <br>The Ending is far superior.

So Im divided between fish and snake pussy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Too bad she's an UNFAITHFUL WHORE</br></br>  <br> yfw no matter how many kids you have with Miia or Rachnee the pussy will still be tight as fuck because they lay eggs from their monster half <br><br> yfw Papi's probably already stretched out as all fuck and has a roastie from laying all those unfertilised eggs </br></br></br>  Papi is best musume  Why does Suu look like a fucking serial killer in this?<br><br> Suu sounds exactly like I imagined her too, spooky </br></br>  <br> We most likely will but Bedford isn't going to be the one in charge. </br>  <br>Whenever it gets to Tio, I find myself imagining her trying to hold a tiny microphone daintily in her giant hands and spitting her verse while everybody else looks on in awe because let's face it- she slays on her verse.</br>  <br>Papi's rape face is best face.</br>  <br>Suu*<br> I should get more sleep </br></br>  <br>Papi has a bit of a rape face too, hers is more determined while Suu's is more unhinged.</br>  <br>Suu seems to be a complete psychopath though.<br><br>Maybe it's just Suu is kind of retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Cow/ Horse doujin when?</br>  You know what the series needs? A crocodile girl. <br>That pussy be Interior Crocodile Alligator</br>  <br>How the fuck does Darling know about the sexual habits of garter snakes?</br>  <br>Suu is just insane, but papi is really determined.</br>  <br>I have and it was far from enjoyable, just awkward.</br>  <br> Only for a few chapters. After which he is now tasked with choosing one, marrying, and fuggin her so interracial relations can take another step. </br>  <br><br>Cheating slut</br></br>  Would you rather be raped by lolichickun or rapeslime?  <br>Rachnera mindbreaking Lilith doujin when?</br>  <br><br>rapeslime, chicken is too innocent</br></br>  <br>for hours on end</br>  <br> mama Miia forces you to go back to the village  <br> literally under a pile of snakes your whole life eating horrible food until you die  <br>Doesn't sound as fun as having just Miia as your waifu. I understand completely. <br>Doesn't change the fact that I want to have endless sex with her and just her though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just as  said. Papi is fuggable imouto-tier.</br>  <br>She tried to rape Darling twice.</br>  <br>Nature documentaries?

Or IN Suu.  <br> spend literally an hour trying to find the webm of a guy having sex with a snake <br> it's been taken off the archive </br></br>  <br>How does it feel to like dicks anon?</br>  <br>Yeah right</br>  How come harem protagonists never have any sex?  <br>It feels wonderful, you should know fag.</br>  How does one acquire an attraction to half-snake women?  <br> spending an hour looking for a /pol/ webm <br> expecting something like that posted over 12 hours ago to still be up </br></br>  Protip: If a snake constricts around you, what you need to do is grab the end of the tail and gently start unraveling it from there until the top. What Darling did was retarded and only caused Miia to constrict harder.  Ever wonder what Rachnee's mother is like?.....  <br>I dont see how one doesn't. Its all the cuddle potential of a snake combined with the will to cuddle of a human female, it is the ultimate creature.</br>  <br>I have the feeling  shes dead </br>  <br>How doesn't one?</br>  <br><br> ..... <br><br>anon, please</br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine her as this kind and aloof oba san... My dick must impregnate.</br>  <br>How does one not? You may not be turned on by the swaying of a tail, but it certainly doesn't ruin the rest of her and adds an exotic feel. Only leg and ass men are left out.</br>  I have to say, when you're going through the show frame by frame, it really shows that it's a low budget production. I'm not sure the BDs will be worth the money even by typical animu BD standards. But anyway, here's a stitch. I'll probably do some more from the episode and then finish with the MON pans from the ED.<br><br><br>Darling wasn't an expert on snakes when Miia first came.

It makes me think the Sunny flew away and Capone is personally going to hunt them down.  So much happening this chapter<br><br> All the rest of the supernovas confirmed okay <br> Smoker essentially admitting that he and Tashigi aren't happy with the government <br> We've seen Kaidos full shape which means he's a new character <br> Fuji possibly resigning from Admiral position </br></br></br></br></br>  If they're not already banging I'd be surprised but she's his side chick at best as Hina's his main squeeze. Though as the leader of an all male crew I can't imagine Hina isn't getting a different dick every week  <br> edition <br>Stay cancerous.</br></br>  <br><br>In reference to Smoker X Tashigi</br></br>  <br> edition </br>  I dont understand one thing…<br><br>Doffy said after the war that he would quit if the WG kept pestering him. Then he is forced to quit by Law and he shits himself.<br><br>Was he just bluffing with the WG officer back then?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pekoms lie defeated  <br>Pekoms' bounty is just 10 million less than Doflamingo's. I am not saying he AS strong as Doflamingo... but he is Vergo's level at least for sure. He would wreck Sanji badly.<br>And Tamago is implied to be even stronger.</br></br></br>   Urouge last seen on a lightning-covered island called "Raijin island" <br> Mysterious person comes to his rest stop in the clouds <br><br>I wonder what this could mean...</br></br></br>  It felt so good to read the mangastream scan, I could finally understand what the fuck was going on.<br><br>Btw<br><br> Kidd alliance going after Shanks <br>Fucking called it. I personally think they are going to get rekt hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  KidHawPoo vs. StrawHeart when?  <br>SHIT. I forgot to mention this in my happening.</br>  <br>Shanks looks really evil there, I hope Killer defeats all of them including his own captain.</br>  Capone Bege confirmed for working for mom  <br>this makes me think that the strawheart expands with the kaido arc adding x drake so that its 3 vs 3 supernova clash. lots of subtle himts this chapter</br>  <br>Anyone who didn't think Kaido was a new character is an idiot</br>  <br><br>Do you guys think Luffy will try to defend Shanks from them?</br></br>  <br>I mentioned it because of the retards saying that he wasn't.</br>  <br> edition <br>typical release day cancer</br></br>  Have we seen every Supernova post-timeskip now?<br> Luffy, Zoro, Law: on Dressrosa <br> Kid, Killer, Apoo, Hawkins: somewhere allied <br> Bonney: stealing pizza <br> Urouge: meeting Enel <br> Capone: working for Big Mom <br> Drake: working for Kaido <br>Yup, 11 total. Everyone is back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nice quints </br>  <br>You mean 4x4<br> Killer vs Zoro swordfight <br> Luffy vs Kid <br> Apoo vs Law, intangible sound goes aginst his ability to rearrange things <br> Hawkins vs Drake ? <br><br>I forgot how little we know of Hawkins power</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he even gets wind of this, he will stop at nothing to rescue the man he promised to return his strawhat to. For the sake of pottery, he will.</br>  <br> Urouge: meeting Enel <br>I'm calling it now Urouge will become a Yonkou at the end of the series called "the highest priest". OC do not steal.</br></br>  Is Bonny okay? I couldn't deal with the shitty panda translation  <br>nah luffy would do the same that he did back in thriller bark when ace was dying<br> lol I ain't helping, it's his own adventure! </br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's like:<br> "Damn, these guys are fucking shit up all over. I'm glad to be part of the same generation." </br></br>  <br> called the highest priest <br><br>I can dig it. Not original but I like it.</br></br></br>  <br> Do you guys think Luffy will try to defend Shanks from them? <br><br>No. More like wanting to fuck them up for going after Shanks first. But we won't even get that far. Scratchman's and Hawkins' crews are going to get crushed by Red Hair's crew, for hype's sake, while Killer might end up defecting, in exchange for sparing his captain's life, leaving Kidd a broken mess at some port town somewhere in the New World.</br></br></br>  /a/, you have the royalties  <br><br> what is the Impel Down arc </br></br>  <br>I'm really disappointed that all the Wizard of Oz theories don't work now without Big Mom as the Wicked Witch</br>  <br>He might be like<br> "I'm not pirate king yet. I can't face him right now." <br>Or<br> "Shanks and his guys are strong. They can handle it." <br>Or what you said.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, AFTER Ace lost. Liffy wouldn't interfere before Shanks can even fight to his heartscontent.</br>  <br><br> Implying Kaido isn't Chopper. </br></br>  <br>That's not Kaido. It's a shadow of a building in the Wano country.<br><br>You can tell by the trees, the shape, and the plot is clearly leading them there.</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga. Best ship</br>  <br>Did you see those horns?<br>Kaido is  Chopper's deer dad who hate from the Hito Hito no Mi Model:  Giant  Zoan</br></br>  <br><br>Hereee's Kaido</br></br>  <br> mfw <br><br>Would that be the ultimate twist in anything ever?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt Wano is a winter island.<br><br>It was Kaido, he is huge as fuck. He probably prefers winter islands because his Zoan form is an animal that likes cold(?)</br></br></br></br>  It's time to Post your 3 worst theories /a/ !<br><br> Kaido is a dwarf with Dragon Zoan. <br><br> Big Mom fell in love with sanji and want him to cook for her eternally. <br><br> Doflamingo is    Sanji's father  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can it be enel? Isn't he on the moon?</br>  <br>kaido is a beetle</br>  <br> I doubt Wano is a winter island. <br><br>It's Japan with a population that are immune to colds. Shit just got real.</br></br></br>  I don't like new Akainu's look. He was scarier and more stern looking when he was cleanly shaved. He looked like a super-powerful lawyer which he is supposed to be. <br>Now with beard and cigar he looks like some mafia boss. Not very fitting for the face of justice.</br>  <br>he got there, he can get back</br>  <br>He always had the Yakuza look</br>  <br>Why are all the Yonkou such huge motherfuckers? What do they put in the NW's water?</br>  <br>you are right</br>  <br>pic related<br><br><br> implying Eneru will have anything to do with the world of the humans again <br>A god should behave like one and not interfere with the wars of filthy humans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy wants to capture it. <br> He befriends it. <br>Could be fun but anticlimatic</br></br></br>  <br>other than big thing in the mist the silhouettes don't really match</br>  <br> Kaido is an ant zoan </br>  <br>Fitting for his justice.</br>  <br>Oda always change the designs of character that only appeared as silhouettes. Look at Blackbeard during Drum's arc and Kanjurou during early dressrosa and you'll see.</br>  <br><br>Dunno, the only "normal" one is Shanks. And even with one arm he is strong as fuck.<br><br>The other 3 seem like heartless monsters</br></br></br></br>  <br>Worst like dumbest or worst ones you still like?<br><br>My favorite bad one is that Monet died and her fruit respawned on one of Nami's tangerines. Someone unknowingly eats it</br></br></br>  <br>Any idea why they are specifically going after shanks? i thought shanks was pretty chill and just drink and eat food all day.</br>  <br><br><br><br> &gt;Urouge: meeting Enel <br><br>Time to share it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he's so chill then they might think he's the easier target</br>  <br>because shanks is the only one not involved in the story yet<br><br>and blackbeard is end game so cant get him yet</br></br></br>  <br><br>Same with Kaido's human form. First it was the mustache guy and then this one with the mask.</br></br>  <br>Vergo is alive and ate the Axolotl Devil fruit to regenerate himself.</br>  <br><br>Nobody would be dumb enough to go against Blackbeard who has like a billion DF powers. Also, Kuzan.</br></br>  <br>it's not a mask. but yeah the design changed</br>  <br>thats hajrudin</br>  woah<br><br>first request page that doesn't have "crew member interacts with animal"</br></br>  I BELIEVE IN FUJITORA  <br> Big Mom fell in love with sanji and want him to cook for her eternally <br>I like it.</br></br>  <br>pinocchio and tengu are animals.</br>  <br>technically, Usopp is interacting with Chopper</br>  <br> there are people who didn't think Zatoichi is a badass </br>  <br><br>He always looked like a Mafia (or rather, Yakuza) boss</br></br>  Holy shit this chapter was fucking good. I didn't think we'd get into between-arc worldbuilding for another chapter or two. <br> Fujitora giving no fucks and not backing down <br> Gorousei all upset <br> randoms mad about loss of Smile so Law and Luffy are going to be in even MORE danger <br> Kaidou has beetle-like horns so he might actually be a beetle zoan  <br> Kuzan involved with Blackbeard (reminded me of the anon who actually called that) but I wonder why he's involved with Blackbeard <br><br><br>That's a Leviathan. I think it is supposed to be explained but who knows when.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>guise, what if kaido is a beetle zoan?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit am I only the second one checking them?</br>   mfw this chapter alone is more interesting than all Dressrosa chapters combined   <br>Kuzan probably works with blackbeard to either set him up or to get something out of it. Maybe it's to sabotage the navy?</br>  <br>Oh and I forgot one of the most important bits<br> Smoker + Friends going to Vegapunk's laboratory <br> VEGAPUNK'S LAB <br>Maybe we'll get our VEGAPUNK reveal soon? HYPE</br></br></br></br>  <br>he's fat after all</br>  <br>Ussop sniping Sugar was better.</br>  <br>stop exaggerating like a faggot</br>  <br>Where do you ducks even come up with this shit?</br>   Akainu gets shit on by his superiors AND subordinates   <br> Thread is mainly discussion and speculation instead of rampant shitposting <br>This is truly a Christmas miracle.</br></br>  Even Akainu is mad at the Gorosei<br><br>Shieeeeeet.</br></br>  with all these reveals and new info, what can we expect for 800?<br><br> kaido <br> vegapunk <br> sanji and co <br> new bounties </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Barely did shit to help with the battle in Dressrosa precisely because he wanted to show how powerless and corrupt Marine "justice" really was <br> Makes an open apology on behalf of the Marines specifically to avoid another Alabasta situation <br> effectively renounces his position as Admiral and talks mad shit straight to Akainu <br><br>this nigga right here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy.</br></br>  <br>Marine/WG Civil War arc when?</br>  <br>Here, you dense prick.</br>   Fujitora already telling Akainu to eat shit <br>he really knows how to pick them</br>  <br>notice the flag? that was on big mom's ship. its already been discussed and confirmed in previous thread you fucking speedreading faggot</br>  Where are all the "hurrrrrrr why does Fujitora not defeat Doflamingo?" faggots now?  <br>It's great.</br>  <br><br>Look at the page again.

He could ask the WG anything and blackmail them threatening to tell the world everything.<br><br>Doffy only shat himself because he was afraid that Kaidou would kill him, not because Law demanded him to resign from Schichibukai. He had a plan how to take down both Luffy and Law knowing they would come to Dressrosa, but as we all know the plan failed.</br></br></br></br>  So it's Fujitora vs Alliance next. How the hell is he gonna justify this in the public's eye now?

Akainu could just melt him right now, or for 2 weeks straight if Doffy tries some Armament Haki shit.<br>Now if he has some contacts on standby ready to leak the secret, then Doffy would have an edge. But right now, no.</br></br>  Shanks is going to wreck Kid <br><br>Just like how Whitebeard wrecked Crocodile.<br><br>Actually i'm betting Shanks will send Rockstar up against Kid just for the shits and giggles</br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to... I don't know, 6 years ago?</br>  <br>bring their heads back, I will wait for you<br><br>Just what I want to hear.</br></br></br>  everybody keep in mind this is LITERALLY 3 days after Straw Hats 2 year absence. they shat all over the New World in less than half a week getting CP0, Big Mom, and Kaido after em in the process.<br><br>they're probably gonna get one piece by the end of the week at this rate.</br></br>  <br><br>During Law's speech at Punk Hazard all of the Yonko were shadowed.</br></br>  <br>He might be sarcastic about the "friends" part, he might be not. But Ceasar is also important to Kaido. So whether he's working for Law, Big Mom, Kaido, himself or someone else entirely is still up to debate.</br>  So how many more "world reaction" chapters to you think we have left? I feel like there's just going to be one, and the rest will be Dressrosa chapters.  Why does Akainu still look like a normal admiral?  <br>This week's panda was Xusasu Basasu level.</br>  <br>Probably true, seeing how Tashigi wants to take the kids to him. And I don't think Vegapunk is another Caesar who those fucked up experiments, because Tashigi couldn't be so evil as to deliver him children to torture.</br>  <br>Did they not include the second part of that dialogue?</br>  <br>Yeah, you can't read.</br>  So fuji vs trastraw next chapter?  <br>What are you talking about they partied for a week at fishmen island</br>  <br>Fujitora is basically saying:<br> "Yeah, eat shit, sakazugay!" </br></br>  <br> yfw the big twist is Fujitora as next straw hat </br>  <br>It deserved the royalties.</br>  <br>That's what he did all chapter.<br><br>Fujitora confirmed for currently owning a pair of the biggest balls in One Piece world.</br></br></br>  <br>nah nigga this was pain of sabo and issho's victory on steroids. did panda's translator have a stroke mid-translating?</br>  I feel bad for Akainu. The WG mocks him and Fujitora talks back to him after he chose him to become an admiral.<br><br><br>edit of 'just fuck my shit up' Sakazuki when?</br></br></br>  <br>not happening<br><br>he meant that he doesn't give a shit about being essentially renounced of his title</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's way more clear than what Panda had. Was oarticularly shitty this week.</br>  <br>speedreader aint you? they left the day after they arrived and punk hazard that same day. confirmed by camie requesting a day off to see them off</br>  <br> Oda said the next straw hat would be an "ancient leader" in an old interview <br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br> feeling bad for the man who killed ace <br>nah fuck him</br></br>  At what point do you think will we get to see Green Ox in action? What will his action be?  <br>Well its no surprise to know that some supernovas are teaming with Yonkous.<br>As Law said "The only way of living in the New World is teaming with a Yonkou or fighting them"</br></br>  <br> trusting anime with anything </br>  <br>where did he say that? thatd be huge news for speculation</br>  <br><br>We might see one more "world reaction" chapter. Maybe one more "good ruler comes back into power" chapter, a "party" chapter and a "new threat" chapter, followed by an "escape" chapter. Then a big reveal at chapter 800. I'm hoping Kaido, but I'ld be happy to see Big Mom in full doing something too.</br></br>  <br>Akainu status : Fracture Anus</br>  <br>Now I really wonder who the Gorosei actual are, since they dont seem to be Celestial Dragons</br>  <br>no idea, The color and animal motifs were easy to identify in the original admirals, but Fujitora's been full of surprises.<br><br>only thing we can probably reliably speculate would be which old Japanese actors to expect his design to based on.</br></br></br>  <br>this exactly<br><br>no sympathy for the man who killed best boy</br></br></br>  <br>I'm searching it. At the time everyone assumed it was Jinbei.</br>  <br>would be interesting if he went for someone recent like ken watanabe</br>  <br>Yeah, I made a similar post earlier.<br><br>Seems that they're strictly the WG leaders but not involved in any royalty or nobility.</br></br></br>  Why the hell do we still not know the name of Fuji's DF?  <br>jesus christ, dressrosa really will end up taking 100 chapters. wano will probably be 150</br>  <br>Wasn't that for Marine Ford ? Like "the next person to help Luffy will be an ancient enemy" ?</br>  <br>Because super serious people don't name their attacks "fruit fruit _____"</br>  <br>What makes you think he has a devil fruit? Maybe it is just really good observation haki.</br>  <br> fujitora next strawhat <br> jinbe will come back <br> luffy will reunite with sanji and the others <br> law alliance <br> the samurai guys <br><br>there are too many characters in this shit, oda can't give them all the panel time they deserve so next arc will be another clusterfuck like dressrosa (not that I didn't like it), with throwaway enemies being defeated in one or two panels by one of the millions of good guys and if they separate it will be years before we see the other half of the group like sanji's group is being handled right now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>cause he aint a poser than needs to name his attacks or always introduce his DF in a fight.</br>  <br> good ruler comes back into power <br>Somewhat speaking of, I noticed one of the panels had someone using weapons from Loflumingo to fight. I wonder if it could have been a group trying to get its country back, or civil war, or any other number of plausible incidents. The group had to surrender since they could no longer get weapons.</br></br>   mfw Akainu realizes Fuji is about to fuck him up and buster calls Dressrosa next chapter <br><br> I know it's never going to happen, but I would love it </br></br>  <br>Its going to be Toshiro Mifune as Yojimbo<br> hard exterior, bad attitude <br> mischievous <br> violent, enjoys fighting <br> ambivalent with a reluctant sense of duty <br>I think he'd be a perfect foil to Fujitora, though there'd be some overlap with Kizaru's personality<br><br><br>Are you serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> edit of 'just fuck my shit up' sakazuki when? <br><br>I tried.</br></br></br>  <br>They're already there nigga, maybe we will continue to see the kids with Vegapunk<br>HYPE</br></br>  <br><br> Haki controlling fucking meteorites </br></br>  <br> Are you serious? <br>No, of course not. Why can't we be silly anymore?</br></br>  <br><br>eternal fuccboi<br><br> gets shat on by a half-dead Whitebeard <br> shanks makes him soil his pants <br> can only defeat someone relevant from behind or when he has elemental advantage <br> WG slaps him back into bitchboy status <br> Fujitora gives him major burns </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What can buster calls possibly do against the current power levels? Fucking Barto can solo the buster call and sink the whole fleet.</br>  <br>Re-read that page. They have a few days left until they reach his lab.</br>  <br>He is going to be a nice old man that's great with kids<br>but has a plan to destroy the world</br></br>  <br><br>Yea sry, I kinda meant "had" not "has". <br><br>Luffy and Law made huge favor for WG here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Akainu status: loins on lava </br>  <br>Because people are legitimately stupid in these threads and I can't tell whats a joke. Look how many people seriously didn't know Kuzan was with Blackbeard</br>  <br>imagine if it is Coby<br><br> anon stop being retarded that is impossible <br><br>a man can dream</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>op discussions are serious business<br><br>also fujitora singlehandedly shut all the fujifags AND doffyfags in one chapter. good day to be a op reader</br></br></br>  <br>not bad as a first try.<br><br> that filename </br></br></br>  <br>If you think about it, he's the guy who took the most damage from Whitebeard as well. Kuzan and Borsalino didn't even get touched by Whitebeard.<br><br>He probably only won the match cause it's magma vs ice and we all know how Pokemon logic works.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually didn't know that and I just reread Dressrosa.</br>  <br>if Kizaru showed up I'm pretty sure he would scare shitless a lot of people</br>  Isshou for next crew member?  <br>wish luffy heard how buttpained he made sakazuki today</br>  <br>Shirohige fucking pierced Kuzan, even though he recovered quickly.</br>  <br>We've already seen Coby post-timeskip though. He's only a  Captain . I don't think he'll be anything more than a joke character inspired by Luffy, sadly.</br>  <br>Kizaru isn't part of buster calls. Those are carried out by vice admirals. Unless mother fucking Jonathan brings his G-8 fleet across the new world no one has to worry about anything.</br>  <br>Kuzan and Borsalino also didn't press his luck taunting in the front lines and going mano a mano.<br><br>He took the most damage, but he also got most done.</br></br></br>  <br>you must have a learning disability /a/non</br>  <br>He did make Kuzan lose a leg, too.</br>  <br>Which is bad, why?</br>  <br>Generally it seems that admiral-levels can somehow negate haki damage, Kuzan smashed into pieces and only sustained minor damage, and Akainu got his neck slashed and didnt mind.</br>  <br>it didn't actually pierce him, it was about to hit him but Kuzan used ice logia shenanigans and made a hole where the weapon was supposed to strike<br><br><br>are you sure? I thought buster calls required the intervent of an admiral</br></br></br></br>  <br>is that part of film z canon?</br>  <br>And Kuzan took a good chunk of a part of his ear.<br><br>I think it's an even trade, really.</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah.<br><br>The story wasn't canon but the characters are canon. If that makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br> a part of an ear for a whole leg is an even trade <br><br>makes sense</br></br></br>  <br>I actually believe Coby will be Luffys last opponent</br>  <br>Buster calls are given out by admirals, but they aren't present at the siege</br>  <br> Didn't press their luck <br> Kizaru is standing right next to Whitebeard 3x <br> Turns around to try and shoot Luffy <br> Gets interrupted by Whitebeard cleaving him with the glaive <br><br>Oh yeah, totally didn't press their luck or anything. It's not like Kizaru fucking smashed his dick in Whitebeard's face or anything, why would the old man get serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can regrow a leg with logia, but you can't regrow pretty faces!</br>  <br>well my dad died in the middle of dressrosa so my mom might be next in wano. im just hyper aware now of how long op will go and the chance of me missing the end due to death.</br>  <br>I see, seems like I was misremembering things</br>  <br>Not really, it looks like his ear was just split; an entire chunk isn't missing</br>  <br>yeah, designs and backstory are canon just not the actual events. cool.</br>  <br>It will probably be an epilogue chapter or something where they fight and laugh with each other for 10 years or something.</br>  <br> part of his ear <br> His whole fucking leg <br><br>It wasn't even, that's why Akainu won</br></br></br></br>  Think we'll get any more entire crew vs. singular opponent fights? I sure hope so. Even  Strong World  had it in the first skirmish against  Shiki . I wanna see more fightan interaction.  <br>It baffles me too, but I don't think it's that unthinkable that someone might not recall a single off-hand comment that Burgess made on the phone with Blackbeard like fifty chapters ago</br>  <br>Well no fucking shit, mister genius.<br><br>Why the fuck can't we be silly? Why does everything need three answers calling somone retarded, if the post was obviously a joke?</br></br></br>  <br>Coincidentally my dad also died in the middle of Dressrosa.</br>  <br>Jeez anon, this thread got dark real fast.</br>  <br>it's fair. It's hard to remember all OP facts sometimes</br>  <br> coby and luffy laugh continuously for a decade <br>sounds plausible. oda could make it work</br></br>  <br><br> overshadowing Zoro with Zatoichi <br><br>nah man, nah</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoan Admiral would be perfect.

What chapter was it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not quite sure about that one, He seems really into it when he sweared to be the one to stop Luffy. <br>I can see some nostalgic flashback during end fight, or hell just be a small fry on the way to the end</br></br>  <br>So, what do you guys think this was all about?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ufT<wbr>R5NN3xWY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>few days in one piece are years in real life</br>  This is a great chapter. Even better, I don't think we're finished yet. Next chapter may dive into some more stuff. <br><br>I'm wondering how Urouge got up to the sky. It may be connected to one of those moons that took Capone's ship upwards before the timeskip. Maybe being a Skypiean/Sky native, he has a way to get to the sky/clouds.<br><br>I think Dressrosa will be akin to Shabondy, as in all the faces it introduced will pop up frequently as the story of the world unfolds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everybody's dad will be dead before One Piece ends.</br>  <br> I know, this time I was confused by the fact that Kuzan and Sakazuki were present during Ohara's buster call and I didn't consider that they weren't admirals yet </br>  <br>i feel you /a/non, i feel you<br><br><br>people die. good chance someone you replied to on 4chan is already in the dirt</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter 720</br>  <br> the highest priest </br>  <br>he is going to be like davinci</br>  <br> small fry on the way to the end <br>That's all he has been so far. I don't see anything that could change that.<br><br>Even if Coby was a higher rank in the Marine's--say Vice-Admiral to be around Luffy's level--Luffy still has a metric shitload more fighting experience, and against far stronger opponents, than Coby.<br><br>Would be cool if Coby wasn't a useless fuck though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck. We won't see Vegapunk till 2020 then.<br><br><br>Very true. If it makes you feel better,  I'd gladly trade my father dying for you being able to keep yours alive. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oda's gonna have to create a fleet of allied Straw Hat ships soon, maybe with the less used Strawhats like Sanji and Robin and Choppa as captains or something.</br></br>  Everyone's guessing its Enel on the cloud with Urouge. It seems to me like he fled a battle into the sky to recover, what if   the Blackbeard pirates are hunting him for his fruit and Laffite flew after them   <br>especially oda's. i wonder how bad he'll feel when his parents never get a chance to finish one piece</br>  Guys, I miss Caesar  <br>Thanks for that.

With no survivors.<br> that would actually be pretty rad </br></br>  <br>4u</br>  <br>I think he planed a connection between Law and Doflamingo, since they had similar Jolly Rogers.

Theres a difference between having a map of what you THINK the world is, and a map of what it really is. Not to mention, even if the whole world was already mapped in some way, Nami's dream is to map every square inch, which means having a record of every island by name and every ocean way</br>  <br>one of the best fights before OP turned into le epic shit</br>  So, what is it ?  <br>Well. It's 9 arcs at most, but some of them can be big arcs like Dressrosa. There is also a chance we get some smaller arcs, although those have been quite rare as of late.<br>I would put the Reverie and the Revolutionaries (and maybe the final war) in the same arc. All the world's leaders in one place, is there a better time for a revolution?<br><br>So I'll go with<br> Zou/Big mom (1 year) <br> Kaido/Wano (2 years) <br> Elbaf (1 year) <br> Wherever Vegapunk is (1 year) <br> an unknown arc (1 year) <br> Revolutionaries, Reverie, Final War (2 years) <br> Raftel (1 year) <br><br>And of course, all the other years Oda adds, because he gets a new idea for an arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying nico robin being best cake of all time is irrelevant </br>  <br>Buggy doing something, I bet</br>  <br> Urougebros where we at? <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nice minority opinion</br>  <br>I want Killer to be my mom.</br>  <br> Fujitora's replacement <br> The new Shichibukai <br>A pirate becoming admiral? Never ever</br></br></br>  <br>Why are gamblers best characters in anything ever?</br>  <br>I think that was just the shit Fujitora pulled</br>  <br>he was talking about Fujitora's public display of the marines fucking it up. read more carefully</br>  <br>lmao does this guy have the pigeon pigeon fruit</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the final war arc takes place after one piece is found. So... Raftel, Final war.</br>  <br>I thought that was just the news of Dressrosa piling on top of the other shit.</br>  <br>I hope so, that would neat. Though I find suspicious that we didn't get Crocodile's reaction to Doffy's downfall. Maybe this is about him.</br>  <br>cause they take chances. they go all in. they dont play it safe</br>   supernovas think they can take on Shanks <br><br>Kek</br></br>  <br>I agree. Whitebeard said the discovery of One Piece will stir some shit up, and that most likely will be the Final War.</br>  <br>Who else would even dare to take him on? Besides, he is probably the character with the most Death Flags in OP.</br>  <br>It will obviously involve blowing shit in the middle (where Mariejois is) and connecting seas into all blue.</br>  why dont the kidpoo's just go after fking buggy, jesus christ how do they let him with his army run around as yonkou, easiest target bar none<br>i swear to god if buggy comes and saves shanks im done</br>  <br><br><br>Meh, busting all my hopes.</br></br></br>  <br>Buggy is a shichibukai, not yonkou.</br>  <br>Blackbeard, Luffy,  Buggy  Kaidou (I know he lose to him but he has a huge zoan army), Big Mom</br>  <br>Makes you wonder, Shanks obviously needs to have some connections in the new world etc. If he is a yonkou it is unlikely he will just travel around having fun, though it would fit his character better. He doesn't seem to have a goal, so there isn't much potential for a plan to take him down the way Law planned to take out Smile to take out Kaido.</br>  <br>oh totally got it mixed up then, but still jesus christ</br>  Urouge is good boy  <br>I wonder if Oda will show something about him this arc. Might be  fun. </br>  <br> Akainu is like 3.5 meters tall <br> two standing Gorosei are farer than he is and still considerably higher <br>These two standing dudes are like 5 meters tall. Holy shit, Dofla would look like a manlet next to them. And they are thin and not buff like Kuma or Whitebeard, it makes them even creepier.</br></br></br>  Who are the current shichis anyway? I think I lost count.<br><br>Mihawk<br>Buggy<br>Bear (?)<br>Hancock (how is she even still a shichibukai after the shit she pulled two years ago?)<br><br>Law, Jimbe, Croc and Doffy got kicked out. Blackbeard did aswell. Moria might be kill.<br>And then there is the guy who made Fuji blind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They must be pretty strong, I guess.</br>  <br>Someone post that "Oda and Perspectives" image.</br>  <br>Gandhi has a powerful sword so I guess they are. I think they are endbosses.</br>   Burgess gets sent flying a few chapters ago <br> Someone appears out of nowhere on Urouge's sky island <br> People think it's Enel for no reason <br><br>what a bunch of retards</br></br></br></br>  <br>Urouge is best Supernova.</br>  <br>Yonkos and Supernovas then? <br><br> Buggy <br><br>How strong is his crew now? A lot of ID prisoners joined, but Lvl 5 prisoners are fodder tier now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just those four you remembered and one mystery member<br><br> And then there is the guy who made Fuji blind. <br>What?</br></br></br></br>  where were you when capone arrived to save sanji  <br>I hope Kaido is a giant  fairy. Just the size of chopper </br>  <br>I think it is just stylzation.<br><br>Also, are they all based on some historic leader?<br>One being Ghandi.<br>The standing one on the right probably being from some medieval italian aristocrat family.<br>The one sitting in the chair might be british.<br>The standing on the left could be Kaiser Wilhelm so so.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i dont think that a shichi made him blind, that hasnt even been addressed yet, i think your mistaking him for zephyr</br>  <br> Hancock (how is she even still a shichibukai after the shit she pulled two years ago?) <br><br>It really doesn't seem like anyone knows.</br></br></br>  So do we give KiddHawPoo their send off now or do we wait for them to get btfo?  <br>Capone seems to work with Big Mom, he is trying to capture Caesar and her Jolly Roger seems to be on his ship.</br>  <br>One is Gandhi, one is Gorbachev, not sure about others.</br>  It sucks having it confirmed that the other alliance isn't going after Blackbeard.  <br> burgess get sent flying a few chapters ago <br>he was set on fire, i usually dont like calling ppl speedreaders but jesus christ this was last chapter you sperglord <br><br> damage control incoming </br></br></br></br>  <br>the baldy with markigs is definitely gorbachev</br>  <br> her Jolly Roger seems to be on his ship. <br>Seems like Capone is on her ship, to me.</br></br>  <br>Oh wait fuck that was just a retarded fan theory I mixed up in my head. Fuji wants to abolish the shichibukai system, he has cuts over his eyes. And since the shichibukai cut Z's arm, we know he has a sword.<br><br><br>Yeah, I did.<br><br><br>Smoker knew, many marine soldiers know, I think Boraslino or that sumo guy leading the Pacifistas knows aswell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The third or fourth endbosses.<br> Blackbeard Pirates <br> The Marines <br> Gorosei <br> Shanks' crew <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised to have a secret final boss at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> objects can eat paramecia and logia fruits </br>  <br> we know he has a sword <br>Mr. 1 confirmed for mystery Shichibukai</br></br>  <br>Master near the Sea</br>  <br>why the fuck would oda pull out a kaguya like naruto when he has a GOAT lineup of end bosses already set up</br>  <br>It was last chapter, but that doesn't change the fact that he was set on fire, AND sent flying.</br>  <br>Shanks are the water logia fruit.<br>Blackbeard is a kerberos.<br>Smoker will join the strawhats.</br></br></br>  <br>why is this a bad theory? if they can eat zoan fruits itd be much easier to explain a flame sword than a fking sword that turned into an elephant</br>  <br>We saw him land and scream</br>  <br>I didn't even know those are markings, I just thought he had wrinkles on his forehead.</br>  <br>Mom's spaghetti</br>  <br> if they can eat zoan fruits itd be much easier to explain a flame sword  <br><br>no it's not. Zoan fruits give the brain of the animal eaten. Chopper gained human intelligence. The gun and the sword gains a mammalian brain<br>There is no way of controlling something that ate a hobi hobi no mi.<br><br>There is way of controlling a sword of fire.<br><br>All of the zoan objects were commanded through voice with their new found sentience.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://readms.com/r/one_piece/792/2<wbr>845/9<br><br> confirmed for not reading at all <br>please gtfo</br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> Shanks looks really evil there <br>He does that sometimes.</br></br>  What's the fucking point of the Shichibukai? They say it's one of the 3 great powers but so far they have caused nothing but problems, have been comparably weak as hell, and they don't even function together as a team to be something greater either.<br><br>Fujitora and Smoker are so right</br></br>  Who will get Kuma's fruit and join SHs?  <br> have been comparably weak as hell <br> all of them have been stronger than vice admirals <br><br>w-what</br></br></br></br>  <br>yea but having to explain how a sword ate the fruit is what im talking about, if they could do that then they can make it eat any of the other fruits as well</br>  <br> caused nothing but problems <br>The first Shichibukai we saw was Mihawk, who took down Krieg's armada. When we first see Crocodile, he's taking out pirates who attacked Alabasta. Some of them do thin down the herd.</br></br>  <br> Zoro becomes a paw man <br>That would probably turn Zoro into one of the biggest tanks currently existing.</br></br>  <br>I distinctly remember the Viz translation as a kid was "why would I want to duel with a one armed has-been". I always loved that line</br>  What a fucking  godly  chapter  <br> tfw Shanks lost none of his power <br>Still a scary fucker.</br></br>  <br>It was supposed to be a way to use the bad guys to deal with the other bad guys to lower numbers and control pirates, of course it backfired terribly.</br>  <br><br><br>Any little chance that he's evil/has a twisted plan behind his back?</br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora isn't kicked out of the marines, he's just being barred from entering any Marine base until he takes out the Strawhats.</br>  <br>He's one of the top four pirates in the world. That's evil and twisted enough.</br>  <br>I'd love for it to be the case that he's secretly a terrible person, but it doesn't seem like it at all with his current demeanor and OP trends.</br>   shanks targetted  <br> we might actually see his abilities <br> Vegapunk and kaidou soon <br><br>How can one chapter be so hype?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shanks has a much bigger crew than most people give him credit for. There was another panel of scrubs he doesn't recover from his hangover with</br>  <br> so blind cannot tell Xusasu Basasu crash landed in the last panel in fucking niggerstream quality not panda blur </br>  <br> They are actually dumb enough to fuck with Shanks. <br><br>I cant wait to see their plan, cause its gotta be the biggest, the thickest, the heaviest and the baddest keikaku there has ever been in a shonen manga to fuck with Shanks-.</br></br></br>  What Shanks does to hinder your travel? Why would you go after Shanks?  <br>He's one of the strongest pirates in the world, of course he looks like an evil monster to anyone who doesn't know him personally like Luffy.</br>   Kidd alliance going after fucking SHANKS <br>Oh man I'm excited. You think Luffy will try to stop them or something? Won't Luffy himself eventually have to go through shanks to become Pirate King anyway?</br>  <br>seeing Apoo get defeated is going to be sad<br><br>he seems like a sweet guy overall</br></br></br>  <br> Smoshigi en route to Vegapunks <br> "Oh hey, I made Kuma fully robotic, killing his humanity in the process &amp; netted the Nikyu Nikyu" <br> Tashigi can now search the globe for legendary swords with ease </br></br></br>  <br>but he won't. He is the new nakama.</br>  Do you think capone is better than Law ?  <br>He's a pirate, and one of the Yonko, of course he's a terrible person. He's friendly to people who he likes, but everyone else, he's a nightmare. I mean the first thing he did when he stepped on Whitebeard's ship was knock everyone out with his Haki. Theres no way he can become a Yonkou and still be a clean, nice guy</br>  <br>Shanks is a fucking lord with the ability to scare off Sengoku AND go toe-to-toe with Kaidou and Whitebeard<br><br>Taking someone like that out makes you infamous</br></br></br>  <br>better at what?</br>  <br> baddest keikaku <br> One piece <br>Hell no , they'll just fight him.</br></br></br>  <br>personally? probably not.<br><br>He's a fortress after all.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe there is some sort of unexpected opportunity they noticed, and they want to take it to make a name for themselves.</br>  <br>That depends on his fruit &amp; if he can forcefully vacuum objects into his body. If so, he IS the definition of ROOM.</br>  <br>Only if Shanks tries to stop him.</br>  <br>They might think that as he is the mast "calm" of the three he is the less threatening.</br>  <br>Capone's probably the least characterized Supernova at this point, so I'm pretty sure the only people who'd prefer him are Law haters.</br>  <br>Stronger</br>  <br>I won't forget the shitposting and retarded speculations she brought in these threads</br>  <br>There are two very important roles for the Shichibukai. The herd thinning that was brought up by an anon that I didn't even really think about but helps keep the number of pirates down and they take out all of the ambitious pirates.<br><br>Think about someone like luffy if he wasn't protected by plot armor. He would be taken out by shichibukai like Crocodile well before he would ever become a threat to the marines and world government. Zoro as well with Mihawk. This is really important as we can see from luffy's own pov of how dangerous a pirate can get when allowed to grow.<br><br>There has to be hundreds if not thousands of young upstart pirates with the potential to be dangerous that were plucked out of the One Piece world well before they could be groomed into any threat.<br><br>The second and most important aspect is bolstering the Marine's forces when called upon. The Marines power is almost entirely consolidated into a few key members. Admirals and Vice-Admirals. <br><br>And Vice-Admirals almost entirely made up of fodder for any pirate worth their salt. This makes it very important ot have the shichibukai on their side. Admirals can't be everywhere. And without them they would have been decimated in Marineford.<br><br>Think about if Shanks arrived at marineford instead of a dying whitebeard. The entire Marines force would have fallen to just one burst of conquerors haki leaving 3 admirals, Garp, Sengoku, and a few vice admirals and sentoumaru<br><br>They are highly susceptible to this maneuver and fodder can't even stall in a world where this exists. Akainu admitted the marines were pretty weak and had to do a worldwide conscription to try and remedy this problem. But with people who take it upon themselves to do what they want like Fujitora they aren't really any stronger than what they were before. There is a reason they are allied with Pirates. No one hates them more than Akainu;Surely Fujitora had to realize if he is okay with it then it has to be absolutely necessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Why the hell would Luffy even consider trying to save Shanks. Not only is Shanks FAR stronger than Luffy, but he's also got his own adventures to do. Did you forget that Luffy only bothered to go help Ace when he learned he was in prison and going to be executed? Even when the paper was burning in Thriller Bark, Luffy had no intention of interfering with Ace's life. When it comes to Shanks, Luffy looks up to him the most out of any person, so theres no way he would even think of helping Shanks, since that would mean he has no confidence in Shanks being able to win.</br>  <br> Law cuts Bege into 50 pieces <br> stuff his parts into a chest <br> uses each part as a tiny gun </br></br></br>  <br>you do realize that the younous were young up and coming pirates too at one point?<br>you're an idiot if you don't expect the supernovas to catch up to the younkou and beat them up. I mean that's the whole point of the story. Luffy becomes the strongest pirate. <br>And since there won't be another timeskip they'll get there soon.</br></br></br>  <br>Being a former Roger pirate; I am absolutely sure that if you want to go to Raftel you have to go through Shanks.<br><br>It also makes the most sense to target him. Whatever area he hangs around has to be near it.</br></br></br>  <br>The Yonko all control the New World ocean, even Shanks. If anyone is going after power on the ocean, they either join a Yonko, or challenge them. Especially if you're going after One Piece, you'd have to go through the Yonko to ever have a hope of reaching it.</br>  <br>I doubt Luffy would want anyone other than himself to take Shanks down.</br>  <br>Law is a fucking edgy cunt , he want to kill the only men who wanted of him when he was a child . Without doffy he would be dead .</br>  <br> thinking Kidtachi can take on Shanks <br><br>none of them will get past Lucky. Hell none of them will get close with Yasopp sniping them from a mile off.<br><br>Kid's only chance of killing Shanks is waiting for Shanks to be dying of old age then punching him in the face on his death bed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>One is Gandhi, one is Gorbachev, one looks like Marx<br><br>they are probably all from 19th and 20th century figures</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To get his territory and fame. Pirates were all but fame (or infamy) and money (that comes with territory). To be a PK you have to beat all others anyway.</br>  <br>stop typing like a retard</br>  <br>he's a younkou. They are all terrifying and evil motherfuckers</br>  <br>about*</br>  <br>I reread the entire arc, and Doflamingo really is a strange character.<br>Even if he has done horrible things, he seems to have a "heart" and actually care about some peoples. He also seems to had depression and a Trauma.</br></br>  <br>Law's edge permanently softened with gay horse's death<br><br>he can only pretend to be cool but it never takes much to bring out his inner tsukkomi</br></br></br>  So who is gonna save luffy and law from fuji? Another epic zoro time?  <br>well ok, you're an idiot. Thanks for telling us</br>  <br>this is why Doffy has so many fans</br>  <br>None of them look like Marx, though the one who looks the youngest seems to be a german Kaiser of the 19th century.</br>  <br> I have no argument so i'll just call THEM stupid <br><br>okay</br></br></br>  Alright so let me recap this for all you dummies:<br><br>-The Gorousei have people above them (I thought they were the highest form of authority)<br>-Kuzan is part of the BB pirates. Although anyone here who thinks he's actually their ally and doesn't have ulterior motives is  probably wrong. <br>-Bonney is just running around stealing food.<br>-Urouge has a visitor in the clouds. Who could this be? That caption has a certain sky and then a certain sea where in the sea is the area where Big mom and Sanji are. So I'm guessing it might be the same area. BUT when the Sunny coup de Bursted it went to an area with no clouds so that Doffy couldn't follow.<br>-Capone is also after Ceasar, this does not mean he's Big Mom's ally but it does mean that he's the SH's enemy. UNLESS Big Mom already took Ceasar from the Sunny and Capone is running after Big Mom to retrieve him.<br>-KidHawkPoo alliance is going after Shanks<br>-Kaidou is not the damn shadow. The damn Shadow is the shadow of a building. BUT the area they are at is Wano, you can tell from the tree, the clouds and the look of the building's shadow.<br><br>So mysteries are:<br>-Who is in the clouds with Urouge? Is it Sanji?<br>-Who are the Capone pirates really fighting?<br>-Why is Kuzan with BB?<br>-Will he show up at Dressrossa? He was at green bit so maybe.<br><br>Finally, and this is something I didn't quite get?<br><br>Is Fuji going to capture Law and Luffy or is he saying that he didn't intend to return to the Marines?<br><br>Oh also who is this inspector that Tsuyu visited?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>...im the one that said he didnt go flying cant tell if your being derogatory towards me or if you have a reading comprehension and analysis disability</br>  <br>the jewish one.</br>   Implying Fujitora won't join Luffy's crew   <br>Probably Sabo but only in the unlikely event that Fujitora is actually planning to take the heads of the people who he just admitted saved the kingdom.</br>  <br>yeah but I'm disappointed with the fact that he is treated like "the worst devil ever born" even if he seems to have a good heart sometimes.<br>The whole nightmare scene and the fact he seems depressed about Law is so fucking strange because he still wanted him to use the ultimate Ope ope's power for him to be immortal.<br><br>It's the same thing with the fact that he wanted to destroy the whole island with the Bird Cage shrinking even if his crew that he loves so much was on the island.<br><br>It's so fucking ambiguous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no, I called you an idiot because you've shown yourself to be one. <br><br>I already presented the argument, and it's that the main characters and his rivals will grow stronger till they are at the top of of the pirate world. Beating the old leaders is a way to show how powerful they are. <br>If you believe the younkous will remain the strongest forever, or only luffy will reach their level, then, my friend, you are an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> -Urouge has a visitor in the clouds. Who could this be? That caption has a certain sky and then a certain sea where in the sea is the area where Big mom and Sanji are. So I'm guessing it might be the same area. BUT when the Sunny coup de Bursted it went to an area with no clouds so that Doffy couldn't follow. <br><br><br> certain sky <br> certain sea <br> literally walking on clouds <br><br> you think it's big mom instead of the obvious Skypeia hints <br><br> doesn't know the inspector is garp doing one of his recurring gags <br> <br><br>Let someone else do the recapping</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so, Tsuru is on her way to make the arrest on the Donquixote Family? is that Sengoku with her?  <br>I'm not saying spotless, I'm just saying he probably wont be funding wars, the slave trade, or any other atrocities beyond maybe a little protection money off the top from islands and shit to fund his parties, and fucking with other pirate crews.</br>  <br>That would be a pretty serious break from his character so far, especially after what just happened.</br>  <br><br>Why not? It's perfect like this<br><br>Fuji said that law and mugi DESTROYED Dressrosa and DEFEAT Doflamingo. The marines didn't said that they SAVED anything, just that because of their fight the country is destroyed.<br><br>This was the plan of fujitora all along, to kill the maximum number of pirates, now he is going to take Luffy, Law, and Mingo in 1 day.<br><br>Nice plan eh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she did say inspector so that is sengoku with her</br>  <br> Why is Kuzan with BB? <br><br>He is like a little kid that gets beaten by some other guy and calls on a big brother to beat that guy instead of him.<br><br>Unless some keikaku is in the works.<br><br><br><br>Also Cipher Pol being mentioned and they might play a big role soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crocodile is Luffy's mom <br> Vergo eating the Axolotol fruit <br> Red line theory </br></br></br>  <br>He looks nothing like Marx. A man with a beard does not automatically look like Marx.</br>  <br>Of course they aren't going to stay on top forever. We see this with Whitebeard<br><br>That doesnt mean Kid or any of the Rookies are anywhere close to Shanks in terms of power. Kid will get wrecked like the cocky shit he is because it isnt his place to take Shanks down</br></br></br>  <br>Garp's ship has a dog on the front.<br>I also thought it was Garp given his carefree attitude and the fact that Tsuyu is there. <br>Maybe Garp got a new ship after the war.<br><br>Also why would Urouge go all the way back to the non new world? Those clouds look baren as fuck. You're just an tripfaging idiot. I mean fuck Oda has shown that all the Novas are in the new world and you're sending Urouge back to Skypeia?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> -The Gorousei have people above them  <br>the heavenly dragons</br></br>  What happens if a Devil Fruit eats a Devil Fruit?  <br>You can see Big Mom's ship in the panel next to Capone's panel. I thought we discussed this already.</br>  <br> He looks nothing like Marx <br>he looks as much like marx as the other guys look like Gandhi and gorbachev</br></br>  <br>Skypeia is a good place to go to, and it's not THAT far from the new world waters. It's still beyond Reverse Mountain.</br>  <br> Alright so let me recap this for all you dummies <br>missing the fact that big moms flag was seen on capones ship, missing the fact theyre working for her and probably about to attack their ship to retrieve ceasar</br></br>  <br>that'd be pretty one-sided wouldn't it?<br><br>that's like 'US government/US armed forces civil war'</br></br></br>  <br>well you can still love someone who you choose to die for you.<br><br>Law was like Doffy's favorite pet turkey. Come November, he was definitely going to eat him but he was still a quirky pet to look fondly on</br></br></br>  <br>High level people travel back and forth all the time. Look at how blackbeard was in the grandline. Mihawk. Moria. Crocodile. Kuma. Dragon.<br><br>The new world isn't like some video game where you can't go backwards if you need something</br></br></br>  Is this creature from /a/?<br><br>OP: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gX7<wbr>kZoDmXf4</wbr>  [ ]<br>ED: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yfo<wbr>EyZbKMaM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>100% /jp/</br>  <br> The manga have nearly 100 chapters, why start discussing it just now?<br><br> Fucking casuals.</br></br></br>  <br>How much of a cunt she is shows up even more in the anime.</br>  <br>i know that fuking faggot, because the episode 01 is out fukin onlymangafag</br>  <br><br> Go fuck yourself you only anime filthy scum, the day you actually develop a taste we can talk</br></br>  <br> Mangaonly fags getting ass blasted over superior anime watchers enjoying things <br><br>Don't you have a shounen shit thread to go post spoilers in?</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit,its not a short? Fuck yes.</br>  <br>20min</br>  <br>Why does everyone hate shorts so much? I think they are good too especially with comedy but all the time I see shit like "Holy shit this looks great. Oh, it's a short. Pass."</br>  <br>I thought it was a short too.</br>  <br>It only shows up more in the anime because the anime just started. She is a turbofag early in the manga too, people just forget it since she's been mellow for so long now and the focus shifts to her hanging out with her friends that you forget what an ass she can be.<br><br>She starts chilling out when the other girls start showing up which coincidentally should begin next episode since they're already at Ebina's introduction. It's a gradual change in the manga so I'm interested to see how it comes out in the anime. They'll still devote time to her being an asshole but I assume Dogakobo knows what to focus on as the anime progresses.<br><br>It's a lot better when they move away from the "haha she's an ass to her brother" jokes anyway. The focal point nstead just becomes about her and her friends. The anime seems like it'll follow that (it's introduced Sylphin and Kirie earlier than in the manga and the ED is completely focused on the four of them)<br><br>she'll still be a faggot to oniichan for a few more episodes but she does mellow out eventually. plus once taihei is allowed to be a unique character instead of just "angry brother who reacts to her bullshit" he's better too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to eb Ebina's ebin bina's.  <br>I swear if I find out that you're lying.</br>  <br><br> manga vs anime adaptations <br>Please stop this bullshit. 90% of the time the anime adaptation is worse. Stop being so fucking angry about pointless shit.<br><br><br>This is true. <br>The manga gets much better when it becomes more about the interactions between the characters rather than the main sibling gags.<br><br> Sylphin a best </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why won't he just kill her?  <br>I got motherfucking nephews and in-laws fucking all my shit up all the time, and it ain’t like I can pop a cap in their ass and not hear about it Thanksgiving time<br><br>-Proposition Joe</br></br></br>  <br>Go home Alex your drunk.<br><br>Mother complex and he's a good oniichan</br></br></br>  Animeonlyfag here. <br><br>Is Ebina mentally retarded?</br></br>  <br>she's from the country so she's kind of a simple hick<br><br>quietly a top tier girl though</br></br></br>  <br>Why?!!!?</br>  Something is seriously wrong when your computer screen is bigger than your TV. <br><br>Also why do nips put the TV and PC on the ground? a 2-3ft high table surely can't hurt.</br></br>  <br>I've only seen the first episode and I haven't read the manga.<br><br>She doesn't seem like a cunt to me at all. Spoiled brat, sure, but not a malicious person. She got mad at her brother not because he didn't buy her sweets, she got mad at him because they didn't get to play video games all day together like he promised.<br><br>That's a clear sign she really likes him and wants to spend time with him.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw the fucking School Days boat reference   I remember reading the manga years ago but dropping it after about 20 chapters because it was the same shit every time - the younger sister is a lazy, spoiled girl who gets her way all the time with no repercussions.<br><br>Watched the first episode and it started well but by the second half it had become the same old boring shit.<br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  <br> TFW you'll never have a sister get mad at you for not living up to a promise to play video games with her all day. </br>  Seems like the perfect /a/ poster.  <br>You basically pegged what Umaru really is. She's honestly a good person deep down and she and her brother care about each other. That gets more apparent over time.<br><br>Most people won't see it that way though, which is unfortunate.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like her the most because being that spoilt is cute.</br>  <br> an anime starts out the same way the manga does <br>wow tell me more</br></br>  I want to fuck her chibi.  <br>A bit, although Kirie and her brother Bomber are too. Or maybe socially retarded is more accurate for them.</br>  <br>It feels like it's trying to be cringe comedy. Like a shittier Watamote. Does a pretty good job making me disgusted with that filthy fucking NEET hamster girl though.<br><br> eating potato chips and chocolate at the same time and washing it down with cola <br>Absolutely disgusting. How is she not fat</br></br></br></br>  <br>well her brother has a table, I think she just likes laying on the floor for kicks</br>  <br>Shimoneta was pretty different from how the manga began.<br><br>It was made a shit manga into a good anime when it is usually the reverse.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's fucking stupid. The smugness was the appeal factor for me. Does that mean she'll be in her chibi form for much less/none at all? Guess I'm dropping it.</br>  <br>She's a moeblob for pretty much a majority of the series.</br>  <br>No lies, only best girls<br><br><br>She still uses it a ton and is still lazy in general but isn't just an asshole to her brother. they still do a ton of jokes and shit but it isn't just a one-note gag<br><br>either way she's still going to exploit the brother for a while in the anime until they get through all the characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Dogakobo <br> pick no-name VAs <br> they're fucking perfect <br><br>they can't keep getting away with it</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're gonna mess up bad one day, but not today.</br>  <br>She didn't eat anything else all day and the cola was probably sugarless</br>  Someone needs to make a .webm of the maracas part in the OP.  <br> eating potato chips and chocolate at the same time and washing it down with cola <br>I remember when I could do that, I'd chug entire gallon bottles.<br><br>Now more than half a glass feels like way too much.</br></br></br></br>  <br>really easy to eat a bunch of shit when your metabolism is probably at it's peak and you're playing sports constantly</br>  <br>Those absolute madman's how do they do that</br>  <br>there are a couple but none of them loop perfectly like they need to</br>  <br><br>There was two of them in the last thread if it's still up.</br></br>  <br>oops posted a still</br>  What material is the hood made of?    <br><br> little to no lewd of chibi form, let alone normal form </br></br>  <br>Her pubic hair.</br>  <br>Oniichan's tears and sweat.</br>  They did a good job of sticking Kirie in the background of most of the school shots, walking behind/watching Umaru. I didn't even notice her in this scene until I saw it a few times since all my attention was on Sylphin.  <br> That constant blushing at Umaru. </br>  <br>They might spend a large amount of time trying out different VAs, just because they are no-name doesn't mean they are just picked at random.</br>  <br>How can someone that spends her time doing nothing and eating crap get to be so beautiful that everyone blushes at the sight of her?</br>  <br>Kirie in particular is turboyuri</br>  <br>Worst imouto ever. <br><br>It is oniichan's fault for not raising her properly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fantasy, son. Stop looking for logic and enjoy the Himouto hijinks.</br>  <br>she's 16, some teenagers are crazy mutants who maintain perfect bodies no matter how shitty they treat themselves.<br><br>When her mid 20s come around all that junk food and sedentary activity is going to hit her like a ton of bricks.</br></br></br>  This is literally /a/non:The Anime  <br>Anon isn't a skillful and beautiful girl outside of his home though</br>  <br>With an actually girl and not a fat old fuck in a magical girl cosplay.</br>  Hime Imouto or Hiki Imouto?  <br>Himono no imouto</br>  Kirino is like an angel if you comparing to that girl.  <br>Fuck no. Kirino makes Mao Zedong look like an angel in comparison.</br>  <br>dried fish?</br>  <br>As in she fucks like a dried squid.</br>  <br>doesn't kirino hit her "friends" and try to fuck her brother? shes a scumbag to the core, umaru at least actually cares for her friends<br><br><br>yes<br><br>excuse the shitty TN misspellings, Norway scans blow</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, it's usually Hyperthyroidism, that shit effects girls more than boys.<br><br>You'll notice this when you eat a ton of crap and don't gain any weight whatsoever, producing hormones by the bucketloads. This leads to hyper metabolism which allows you to process any type of food and not gain weight.<br><br>However the downsize to all this, if left untreated a fuck ton of shit happens, hallucinations, heart problems the works. The downside for men, men are very unlikely to get this disease happens in 5 times more in women.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not very cute though.</br>  <br><br>Fuck i meant downside not downsize.</br></br>  <br>Except we are inside. That's the point. /a/ is not disgusting dirty men, but cute lolis. Or at least, that's what some would like to believe.</br>  <br> implying average /a/nons are smart, athletic, beautiful, popular, and a girl </br>  <br>/a/non are known to be the most deluded posters on 4chan, please forgive them.</br>  <br>Actually I take it back,  Liverpool fans are worse .</br>  <br>Kirino doesn't hit her friends and cares very much about them. She does fuck her brother though. <br><br>Both characters mature over time and that's the point. This anime is going to have the exact same problem as Oreimo though because the people these anime attract are retards who can't comprehend a character who isn't strictly static.</br></br></br>  I'm going to buy some cookies with chips so I can try her eating technique it is so simple yet I've never thought to try and utilize it  <br> Dropping Prop Joe quotes in a Himouto thread <br>You're a good dude.</br></br>  <br>More like, retards who call anyone a cunt as soon as they do one thing they don't like.</br>  Based dogakobo does it again.<br><br>This could be my AOTS, i can feel it already.</br></br>  <br>it's actually what every /a/ poster looks like, info 100%<br><br> LPT: using a tripcode reduces your chances of becoming a moeblob </br></br></br>  my uncle's boyfriend told me he read the manga and it later turns into an incest story please tell me that's not true I watch ep 1 and enjoyed it but I will drop this shit if it turns to some sister fucking show  <br><br>We're just living in the moment.</br></br>  <br>Isn't she supposed to be in another class?</br>  <br>Are you saying you wouldn't fuck your sister even if she was a 10?<br> <br>Do you suck dicks too?</br></br></br>   umaruun~   <br>It's a 1DK, they sleep in the same room, their PCs are right next to each other, I bet imouto knows what type of porn he's into.<br><br>Do the math.</br></br></br>  <br> Umaru <br> Ebina <br>What's with the caveman names?</br></br></br>  <br>only those who don't have sisters/never lived with a women outside of their mothers are into fucking sisters <br><br>it's a shitty trope in anime tbh</br></br></br>  <br>I have 3 sisters.

Q and A with Atsushi Kido from the DBS Super Start Guide<br><br>Q: Will Goku get stronger than SSGSS?<br>A: This is the #1 thing to look forward to in “DB Super”. I want him to get stronger, myself.<br><br>Q: Will a new Shenlong appear?<br>A: Things called “Super Dragon Balls” will appear!<br><br>Q: Where will the fights in “DB Super” take place?<br>A: This time Lord Beerus is appearing too, so the battles will expand out into the universe.<br><br>Q: Will Jaco from Revival of “F” appear?<br>A: Of course he will. All sorts of characters will play a part in “DB Super”.<br><br>Q: Will enemies Goku defeated in the past reappear?<br>A: I wonder. Personally, I hope they will (laughs).<br><br>Q: Will a new rival for Goku and the gang appear?<br>A: Yes. And there won’t just be one!<br><br>Q: About how strong will these new rivals be?<br>A: Roughly strong enough to be on par with Goku.<br><br>Q: Will the battle scenes power up too?<br>A: That’s right. Watch out for Goku’s fighting style as he grows stronger by training!<br><br>Q: Will there be scenes of Freeza training, which weren’t depicted in Revival of “F”?<br>A: No comment. Personally, I’m conflicted over whether or not I want to see that (laughs).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And this is where Bulma's birthday party takes place. Unlike the movie it will be on a cruise ship but the party grounds looks the exact same in the movie (Even has the little ship the cast takes to catch up with SS God Goku vs. Beerus during their fight)  <br>what happened to goku turtle school sign on his uniform<br>This kinda triggers me, way to fuck over roshi</br></br>  <br>So they´re really following through with this.<br>I guess you could justify it by saying that the movies take place in one of the 7 canon alternate universes, but what would the point of them being canon be then?</br></br>   Something stronger than SSGSS <br> Super Dragon balls <br> Fights in space <br>RIP DBZ</br></br></br>  <br>It's a new uniform.</br>  Is Goku vs Beerus in the anime going to look like shit?  <br> Super Dragon Balls <br><br>so super saiyan shenron?</br></br></br>  <br>Super Namekians.</br>  <br>So common people actually go to the cinema instead of ditching them like other movies.</br>  <br>The movies will just be one of those movie sized retellings of TV events</br>  Dragon Ball is shit  So wait we're getting BoG and RoF again? But now in the TV series?  <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> From there the series is now set to catch up to the events of Battle of Gods and Revival of “F”, with each being a “retelling” of their respective events, before going on to an all-new inter-universe storyline. <br><br>Wonder how many episodes this will cover.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This time they will use Whis's sign, because Whis is their new sensei, not Roshi anymore.</br></br>  Best girl.   goku stronger than ssgss <br>Fucking dropped, he should know were to cap the strength holy fuck.<br><br>Basically he just reset the power levels with this super saiyan god bullshit. Now is supersaiyan god 1 2 3 4 etc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He was always going to get stronger because of Beerus and Whis.</br></br>  <br>There's this fanart of kid Goku and Vegeta training with This that's pretty neat</br>  <br>Sweet. I was worried they'd reuse the movie animation. Nice to see a different taste.</br>  <br>And people are angry at Anno for the Rebuild movies.</br>  <br> TFW SSJG was just Kaio Ken 2  <br>I just wanted Krillin to be useful in the sayian sage and freiza saga he at least had a kill move. But now it's confirmed he will never do anything again he is less then an ant at this point.</br></br>  <br>Just wait until Goku goes to some unknown planet and learns a powerup that is useless for him but humans can learn it and it makes them equal to SSGSS.</br>  <br>My last hope is that at the end of super they say something like.<br> Goku you have attained true power but can you match against our creator the first god?  <br> First god how can I fight him?  <br> He has been with you this whole time watching over you. <br> Krillins foreheads dots start to glow as he becomes a gold Buddha <br> Krillin is revealed as the final boss.  <br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> krillin  <br> not yamcha hiding his true power all long </br></br>  dimension fights, las boss is literally evil gok, krillin, piccolo and such, and they get help from Cell and freeza.   possibility of a slice of life freezer episode where he trains and does cute everday universe tyrant things <br><br>sign me in</br></br>  <br> Krillin and Yamcha fuses <br> Krillcha is stronger than Whis+SSG3 Goku </br></br>  What if the Saiyan race survived in the 6th universe, Vegeta saves them from impending doom, and finally becomes the King of all Saiyans as he was always ment to be?  <br>Dragon Ball Z is shit<br>DB is perfect.</br></br>  <br> Not liking both </br>  <br>I liked dbz untill the cell saga then it went full retard.</br>  We'll have reality benders and meta stuff by the end of this series.  <br>Autist, buu saga looks like DB the most in DBZ.</br>  <br> cell saga <br> full retard <br><br>Choose both.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't serve as a good rival universe then. Earth would most likely have been conquered much sooner, Red Ribbon not having the time to expand to make the Androids and Cell and the Buu arc also might not exist for a similar reason.<br>A good rival would be Gohan kept training after Cell, leading to him dealing with Buu before anything escalates and canonically is the strongest in his universe. <br>An alternate universe without parallel-Z Fighters isn't even worth telling.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0aD<wbr>cWucKFjA</wbr>  [ ]<br>This shit still made me feel something tho to see Picclo just holding back as long as he can seeing Gohan get hurt while his father just stood there smiling.</br></br>  <br>The ending of BoG clearly indicated there were more peaks for Goku to strive for</br>  <br>Boo saga was better than Cell<br><br>Cell saga us only good at the beginning with Trunks and the end with Gohan. The rest is one big hunk of nothing</br></br></br>  <br>They're being expanded and changed around into arcs, then a 3rd new arc with multiversal shenanigans closes out the series.</br>  <br>Q: Will Gohan do cool stuff?<br>A: He'll read books. Difficult books.</br></br>  <br>Fighting over the water seems easier to animate.<br>And they can use the 3d models from the movies!</br></br>  <br> &gt;Krillins foreheads dots start to glow as he becomes a gold Buddha <br> &gt;Krillin is revealed as the final boss. <br>That would actually be pretty cool.</br></br></br>  <br> That book grants him a SSG power level </br>  <br>Q: Will Jaco from Revival of “F” appear?<br>A: Of course he will. All sorts of characters will play a part in “DB Super”.<br><br>Q: Will enemies Goku defeated in the past reappear?<br>A: I wonder. Personally, I hope they will (laughs).<br><br>Q: Will a new rival for Goku and the gang appear?<br>A: Yes. And there won’t just be one!<br><br>God damn it, everyone not Goku and Vegeta will be pushed right out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   beerus already awake and destroying planets much earlier than in the movie <br> bulma's birthday party takes place in a cruise ship instead of capsule corp <br><br>these changes give me hope, it means that they can change a lot of stuff from the movie, hopefully the fight between the Z fighters and beerus will be longer than in the movie. I really want to see buu trying to turn beerus into chocolate (although gods are immune to magic) and gohan being badass</br></br></br>  But will there be MULTIVERSE?  Why did SSGSS go from red aura to blue?  <br>The one thing I want is for goku to fuck off eventually and his kids to finally take over for real.</br>  <br>Its like how a flame changes to blue at its hottest.<br>yellow-&gt;red-&gt;blue</br></br>  SSGSS is weaker than SSG though. If anything, the new saiyan forms would be him slowly regaining his SSG strength, if they go that route.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>These answers sound like fanfic level developments</br>  The end of RoF was a big middle finger in the face towards Goku haters.  <br>Most of DBZ sounds like fanfiction.</br>  <br> wanting a person who doesn't like fighting and just wants to read, and a little shithead to take over the show </br>  <br>I didn't mean him obviously its goten who will grow up and finally take over the show since the nerd failed.</br>  <br>Literally Kotaku. They misinterpreted Toriyama's message</br>  <br>But that's wrong.<br>Red &gt; orange &gt; yellow &gt; white &gt; blue</br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm dumb.</br>  <br> white haired ssj confirmed. </br>  I find funny how sometimes some anons says that Dragon ball's theme is about passing the torch to the new generation despite at the end of the days it's always up to Goku to clean the shit his sons failed to clean. Shit like this is the reason why Gohan will never be in the spotlight again and why goten will always be a little piece of shit as even at his best he failed and got absorbed     super dragon balls   <br>I feel like at some point passing the torch was the theme but then they needed more chapters so it just became goku forever getting stronger despite killing someone refered to as the strongest in the galaxy like 150 episodes before the end of Z.</br>  <br>Despite the shitty clothing designs, AF had a decent idea of what the future of DB would be like.</br>  <br>Please, that's nothing<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/ll_XPenKkqA  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br> Will things in DBS happen that happened in DBZ? <br><br>What an insightful interview</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, I hear episode 20 has 18 speak a whole TWO WORDS!<br><br>Get hyped motherfuckers!</br></br></br>  <br>Kek<br><br>They guessed SSGSSJ before Toriyama did</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127828621 <br>What's the point of such a long handle?</br>  <br>Why wouldn't be called a deep throat then?</br>  <br>She's not deepthroating the handle though.</br>  <br>Ofc ss shenron is gonna turn bad and become the overlord of the universe<br> FUCK YEAH</br></br>  <br>But Jaco wasn't in Z</br>  There goes the slice of life, but with fighting bit.  <br>There was no way anybody believed that would be the whole series</br>  The episodes between the BoG and RoF arcs are just gonna be Vegeta whining until everyone lets him become a SSG.  <br>It already looked pretty shitty in the movie. There's no chance that the TV version will look better.</br>  <br>DBZ is legitimately pretty terrible, though. It was godawful pacing and shit animation. There's no reason to watch it instead of just reading DB.</br>  <br> DBZ is legitimately pretty terrible, though. It was godawful pacing and shit animation. <br>Are you implying DB (anime) didn't have those problems?<br> There's no reason to watch it instead of just reading DB. <br>Yeah, I was talking about the Z portion of the manga.</br></br></br></br>  I wan't the Jaco manga to get animated as well. short OVA series  <br>He was in the latest DBZ movie.</br>  <br>Watch them animate it as a multi-episode flashback<br> Bulma: "Oh hey Jaco, I haven't seen you since I was a little girl!" <br> *Another character*: "How do you know this guy?" <br> Bulma: "Well, my sister told it like this..." <br> *Insert Jaco adaptation* </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>color has nothing to do with the flame's heat</br></br>  <br> Jaco is it's own arc <br><br>Yes please</br></br></br>  <br>You shoyld have said the same thing when:<br> androids out of nowhere, stronger than Super Saiyans <br> random ssj forms, stronger than ssj <br> ssj2, stronger than super saiyan <br> namek balls, out in space <br>Dragon Ball scaling up is nothing new.<br><br> rip dbz <br>That'd right, because this is dbs, not dbz.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they give hyper modes to the humans and namekians as well. It is pure bullshit how only saiyans can go hyper mode and have many levels of them even  <br> he should know when to cap the strength <br>Why? Dragon Ball has been about getting stronger in literally every arc.</br></br>  <br><br>THIS. Dragon ball's powerlevels knows no limits and they will keep asspulling more and more powerups so long the series continues.<br><br>Besides, they've been doing this shit since the Saiyan saga. At first it was just good enough to train to get stronger, but then they added power multiplier with the Kaioken AKA the prototype of super saiyan damage multipliers, and then introduced the huge multipler that was super saiyan, later we got the revelation that the legendary power of super saiyan can be improved as seen with the SSJ variations used against Cell, and then we find that not only has variations but also have levels, introducing super saiyan 2, which was followed by super saiyan 3 (which made the variations obsolete and they lack variations themselves, probably because Toriyama forgot about them). So adding a new brand of powerlevel multiplier isn't weird</br></br></br></br>  Kuririn confirmed for B story in episode 3  <br>I think they are going the way of all the side characters taking on lesser threats while Goku and Vegeta go on the great space adventure.<br><br>IIRC wasn't there something about Videl getting kidnapped when Super was first announced?</br></br></br>   There's actually a chance Vegito might show up in Super in one of the other Universes   <br>No</br>  <br>I hope it's slice of life of him as a cop.</br>  <br>Well they would need some new Potara earrings for that. Hope those other universes have Kaioshins.<br><br>I think it would make more sense to have Gogeta be canon. Toriyama always wanted to do it, but Movie 12 came out before he could put it in the manga</br></br></br>  <br> A: Things called “Super Dragon Balls” will appear! <br>Literally why</br></br>  <br>Because it is called dragon ball super, so it should have super dragon balls, makes sense. Now where are my Z dragon balls, Toei?</br>  <br>As long as they don't explode the planet for some godforsaken reason, why not?</br>  <br>I meant that perhaps there is a Universe where that Vegeta and Goku stayed fused as Vegito or something. But I wouldn't be against Gogeta showing up either.</br>  <br>Why would they even need them</br>  <br>for a super wish</br>  <br>Alternate Universe.</br>   Super dragon ball <br><br>Literally ripping off GT</br></br>  <br>Because, well you know<br><br>Shampa is going to destroy their universe and they need SUPER dragon balls to revice it?<br><br>Also the balls are scattered through each universe, luckily for them Whis just happened to have their universes ball.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was confirmed they're going to use the super dragon balls to bring a whole planet back, which is either planet Vegeta or earth. Maybe Namek but I doubt it, the Namekians already have New Namek.</br>  <br>The regular Dragon Balls were created by Namekians. So are the Super Dragon Balls created by a Super Namekian God or something?</br>  <br> super namekian god fuses with piccolo <br> piccolo's power increases a thousandfold <br> he's still a jobber </br></br></br>  <br> planet Vegeta <br>lol you really think reviving them and the whole saiyan race is a good idea?<br><br>Do you want them to think of Goku as a legenday super god super saiyan?<br><br>Come on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only holds his own against the big bad for like two episodes before big bad goes into 54th form and requires the assistance of LSSJGASSJ2 Goku </br>  <br> Saiyans <br> implying <br>It'll be guilt-tripping Vegeta into apologizing to all the little space hobbits that his dad slaughtered.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to see this qt again.</br>  What's the best fansub group for Super?  <br> red skin </br>  <br>Still better than the Mary Sue that Multiverse put for Goku's mom.</br>  <br>I'd probably rather have this. Call me a pleb. I don't care.</br>  <br>This wasn't confirmed anywhere.</br>  <br> It was confirmed they're going to use the super dragon balls to bring a whole planet back <br>No it wasn't</br></br>  <br>Dragon Team.</br>  <br>Some guy in a previous thread said it without providing a source. If that isn't 100% confirmation I don't know what is.</br>  <br> LSSJGASSJ2 <br><br>I'll bet that'll be some term, too. Every time I see SSJGSSJ I have to fucking laugh.</br></br></br>  <br> "Look out, an even stronger opponent!" <br> Goku goes Super Saiyan God ascended to level 4 using Kaioken times 1 million while using a senzu bean IV drip so he doesn't die from overexertion </br></br>  <br>You are a Broly-loving pleb and you are not mah nigga.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8x<wbr>uvDz3k2o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4KC<wbr>3tSKv7ko</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FnS<wbr>0818yHwQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Absalon is everything wrong with the Dragon Ball fandom in the west.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone got a link to the english sub that one anon was doing for the spanish dub of F? Or any sub would be fine  <br>Who doesn't love Broly?</br>  <br>You could tell they grew up with the american dub of Z and GT with the faulconer and menza music and probably never even watched dragonball.</br>  Would have been a WAY better movie. DBZ is dead.  <br>Him just hanging around with dere 18 please.</br>  <br>Go to the /a/ archives, and it'll be in the latest super thread.</br>  <br>As far as movie villains go I always preferred Cooler and Janemba. I never got the love for Broly back then.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot, I didn't even think to check the archives</br>  who /goten/ here?  <br>Goten is.</br>  <br><br>Goten a shit. A SHIT<br><br>He can't do anything by himself and must go the gay route of touching balls with Trunks to be useful at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Clearly.</br>  <br>I really think/hope Goten becomes Goku's successor. I agree when people (and Piccolo) say Gohan was never a fighter. But Goten definitely sees sport in fighting, and he looks like Goku too. And he has Trunks for a friendlier rivalry.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br> Goku and the others still act impressed when the bad guy can blow up the planet </br>  <br>Goten is stupid and completely sucks when he isn't doing comedy scenes with Trunks.</br>  <br>Removing the long sleeves was a mistake.</br>   SSJ10 will never be canon <br>why live</br>  is there any other anime that promotes family values better than dragon ball  <br> Frieza is a purple cooler <br>Taking the already fan-made fifth form frieza and making it real would have been unoriginal and just bad for the series. Ssj3 Gogeta is cool, but ssgss is cooler.</br></br>  This is going to be a fucking trainwreck.  <br>Wouldn't have been any worse then Piss-Frieza and Super Cyan.</br>  <br> Goku constantly abandons his wife <br> Vegeta knocked Bulma up years before they got married <br> Krillin married a cyborg <br> family values </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes it has. When a flame has a lot of Oxygen it turns more blueix and it burns more.</br></br>  <br><br>What family values? The only meaningful contact family members have between them is when they train. The moments when people acts like an actual family are brief and scarce, which is probably why people are so shocked and amazed when Goku shows any emotion other than battlelust</br></br>  <br>I wish I could remember the name of this RPG Maker game I played in the late-90's, where everyone (even Krillin) was a SSJ and kept getting "SSJ transformations" up to SSJ15.<br>I think the game ends with "Gogetunks" fighting Majin FreeCell or some shit.</br></br>  <br> goku constantly abandons his wife <br>To get strong to protect her. Except for the 7 years he went away because he felt as if he attracted trouble, which is kinda true as, the first day he came back, Majin Buu appeared. But yeah, still sucks.<br> vegeta. <br>Yeah. Can't refute it. At least they got married. <br> krillin <br>Still human</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>"Human enough to have babies" does not mean she's entirely human. If the wife isn't 100% of one species, it's degeneracy.</br>  <br>hells yeah</br>  <br>Anon, Robot isn't a species.</br>  <br>Hold on... If that's the case, and they're gonna bring back a planet...<br><br> It will be them trying to bring back Earth because at the end of RoF, Freeza blows up the planets killing everybody except for goku, krillin, tien, roshi, piccolo, bulma, beerus and whis </br></br></br>  <br> posts DA tier fanfic bullshit <br> no one calls him out on said faggotry <br>DB threads are dead</br></br></br>  <br>And if they decide to  keep Earth destroyed for the plot, then would they keep Freeza alive? They mention that he was probably still alive after he blew up earth... <br><br>That could have potential</br></br></br>  <br>more like dbshit, amirite?</br>  <br> Goku leaves to get strong enough to protect her. <br><br>Nope, he leaves because he is addicted to training, he never once tried to deny it, fans love to think that the characters are always anticipating when the next overpowered alien will arrive and try to kill everyone, when in reality they just go on with their lives.<br><br>Its not like Goku trains to become the ohhh so great defender of the Earth, he does it because he has fun doing it and because he is good at it, I don't think this is something that hard to get from his character, specially when the writer himself said this over and over again during interviews.<br><br>Goku has almost zero interest in hanging out with his family, if he could he would sleep, eat, and train, every single day, even through he is omnipresent due to his instant transmission and could teleport back home during every break to kiss his wife or something, but he doesn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame the US dub that pictures Goku as a huge defender of earth who likes to protect the weak when he's just really in for the kicks.</br>  <br>the funi dubs gave too much shit on dragon ball</br>  Why do I still think the best dragon ball episode is when Goku and Piccolo try to get Driving Licenses?  <br> I really think/hope Goten becomes Goku's successor <br>Nah.<br><br>First of all, it would have to be Goten and Trunks. GoTrunks have become inseparable in DB fandom in Japan, second, Goten may like fighting but he unlike Goku, doesn't have the battle lust. He likes to play and be a kid than become a hero.</br></br></br></br>  Who's booty does she mean, /a/?

Possibly surpassing Kinmoza. <br><br>Someone scanlate the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>There's no need to, the anime will be a full adaptation. It ended after one volume.</br>  <br>Nooooooooo<br><br>Anyone, why has no one scanlated Kinmoza since Vol 1 was (mostly) finished.<br><br>Yes, I said mostly, two pages are missing.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They're not Yoko's minions they're Yoko's bullies.</br>  <br>Do these look like the faces of mercy to you?</br>  <br>There's no other proper way to love Yoko. That's what Ayaya hasn't realized yet.</br>  Why is Karen so shit? she ruined the whole episode.  <br>Oh look, more copypasta hate.</br>  Next episode yet?  <br>You see...</br>  <br> Implying <br>I write it from scratch every time.</br></br>    <br>Don't give it to Karen, give it to uh... Media Factory? Are they in charge of the BD Boxes?</br>          Episode 2 airs in less than 5 hours.<br>Anyone still watching?<br><br>Kobayashi best  boy </br></br></br>  I'd put my dick in him.   boy   When is rugged teenage detective guy gonna fuck him? <br><br>Please tell me he's gonna fuck him. You can't waste boy pussy of that quality.</br></br>  <br>if the detective doesnt give that tanoshii the D in the next few episodes im dropping it hard</br>  <br>Only watching for the psycho dude.</br>   Noitamina continually shitting up their slot    It'll break you. <br> I want that. </br>  <br>To be fair, The Perfect Insider and Boku dake ga Inai Machi seem marginally better than this and Punchline (which was pretty good btw)<br>Also, I'm not saying anything until further info is given, but so far Kabaneri looks pretty interesting at least.</br></br>  <br>At this point, I bet they won't announce anything about Cabaneli right now until next month.<br><br>Hope it saves WIT Studio's ongoing crisis.</br></br></br>  <br>They bought me with this scene in ep1, I'm gonna see if they can keep up the subtle lewd like that.</br>  <br> punchline was pretty good <br><br>It was shit and it didn't fit noitamina either.</br></br></br>  <br>When he wants to solve the mystery in Kobayashi's pants.</br>  So, when will Akechi start smoking Egyptian cigarettes?  <br>best op and ed of the season</br>  <br><br>He's taking drugs for his headache at the moment. You have to wait a few years where he's married to Kobayashi and has a kid with her.</br></br>  <br><br>Punchline was already done before, better in a video game format and was really well written.<br><br>The game was called Ghost Trick and was on the DS.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's on iOS and Android now if you want to play it, without pirating it like a good boy.</br></br>  <br>Costs money</br>  <br> It will break you. <br> I want that. <br>Why is he such a slut /a/?</br></br></br>  Reminder Sensei is not Akechi in disguise.   background characters are just silhouettes with a gray gradient <br> it's much stylistic choice <br>What a genius way of cutting down character design and drawing costs.</br></br>  <br>Whether it's cheap or lazy or whatever doesn't matter.<br>It works well for the genre.</br></br>  <br><br>In Laplace's it's cheap as fuck as it is not stylized at all. MPD did it much better for example.</br></br>  Cute butt.  Ah, thanks for reminding me, I'm watching the first episode now. <br><br>When I read all the descriptions of the new anime coming out this summer, this was one of the big ones for me, but the lack of hype from you jerks has made me write it off as a fail.</br></br>  <br>It's because /a/ doesn't read actual books.</br>  <br>Reading literature is my only real hobby nowadays. I've never read any of Edogawa Ranpo's works though.</br>  <br> on Android <br>I don't think so, Tim.</br></br>      <br><br>Anyone care enough to make a gif/webm when he playfully swing his legs on the chair?</br></br>    this show is pretty fucking gay tbh  <br>Or maybe /a/ has just caught onto the fact that Seiji Kishi is a bad director.</br>  I feel cheated.<br>I was hyped for Edogawa. Then I saw the title for the first episode and I was hyped for The Human Chair. Then I watched the episode and it was school shit.<br>Why does Japan always do this to me?</br></br>  First episode was pretty bad.<br> Nakahara Mai <br>It's actually okay I guess...</br></br>  <br>Not just school shit but faggy school shit.</br>  <br>kobayashi is a trap in the original edogawa ranpo books too, so anyone who actually read them would already know that</br>  <br>class rep looks like he's reaching for it</br>  <br>As long as he's not directing comedies, that is.</br>  <br><br>perfect, thanks</br></br>  <br>That ass is illegal.</br>  The character designs are horrendous.  <br>They're too bland for such strong words.</br>  <br>Wait, this is a girl right?</br>  <br>We're all used to moeblobs, what did you expect</br>  <br>I like the eyes.</br>    So the class rep wants to give Kobayashi the D right? Also did class resume in the same place as the murder?  <br>Yes and no it was probably a different classroom. They can't ruin the crime scene</br>  <br> Boku dake ga Inai Machi <br>Holy shit, this is getting adapted? Fantastic.</br></br>  Shouldn't it have started already?  <br>Yeah this, but neet is streaming something else and douyu is just showing lots of old OPs. Someone please explain what's going on?</br>  <br>10 minutes ago</br>  <br>Why isn't it on the streams I watch then?</br>   Draw girl <br> Call it a boy <br>MEMES<br>E<br>M<br>E<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So why isn't anyone posting anything?</br>  <br><br><br><br>It delayed 25mins today.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh I see, so it should be starting right now then?</br>  Holy shit did he just kiss him   I like in the butt   <br><br>I knew it was gay but not this gay.  Picked back up </br></br>  <br> Wait til you see my dick, ey bitch </br>  <br>Does this mean it will overlap with Aoharu x Kikanjuu. Fuck, I wanted to watch both</br>  <br>In the case of both he records one usually and plays later. the schedule is on the connectcast.</br>  I don't get it, they found out the teacher was a psycho right? But why did they have to arrest Kobayashi because of that?  <br>They said he was an accomplice if I remember right.</br>  Class rep a cute  Kobayashi is so short compared to Akechi   sitting in the human chair <br>Is he alright</br>  <br> as it is not stylized at all <br>What?</br></br>  <br>That's not on the lips</br>  <br>It's still pretty gay</br>  This girl isn't the killer, right?  <br>Any more cute butt caps?</br>  That actually scared me, fucking creepy. But what the fuck, so the teacher isn't Akechi then?  Alright I guess that was it, I thought the episode was pretty nice. Half an hour until HS.  <br>HOMOS<br>O<br>M<br>O<br>S</br></br></br></br></br>  The teacher wanted to fuck him?  <br>can't wait for Akechi to NTR him</br>  <br>Where is the  It's time  thread when you need it for once</br>  neet is so far behind, what the fuck    <br>Neet's is a recording</br>  <br>Man Kobayashi has nice hips</br>  <br>Is this the main shotacon show this season? Where are the best boys, I'm a bit out of the loop.</br>  <br>chaos dragon also has white haired shota</br>  <br>webm, where!!!</br>  D R O P P E D<br>R<br>O<br>P<br>P<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks I'll check that out too. Cute boys are really being more of a thing in mainstream shows in the last few years, or more its making a revival.</br>  <br>The art style in chaos dragon makes it hard to find anyone there cute/erotic.</br>  <br>Young boys have very similar facial structures to girls.</br>    <br>Nice</br>    <br>Shota? He's 17.</br>  <br>No, Kobayashi is in middle school</br>  Subs are out!  <br>He's 13.</br>  Somehow I really like this OP  So the new teacher seriously wasn't Akechi? You guys were so sure about it, I trusted you  <br>Yea but not middle schoolers. There 14, and "his" friend is clearly a guy.</br>  do i ever get to see them in bdsm gear like in the OP<br><br>if not, why should i even watch this?</br></br>  <br>He's 13, if he was 14 he would have been detained for longer. This was a point they made last episode. His boyfriend is 14 though.</br>  <br>Sorry, forgot about that. He should still have a bit more of stocky build at that point though, his hips are just too wide to be a dude.</br>  <br>That's not the body of a boy.<br> Reversed trap confirmed </br></br>  <br>That's a fucking girl. I don't care what you say, that's a fucking girl</br>  This case    <br>T-thanks, Japan</br>  <br>Just fap to it either way, embrace the new you.</br>  What a manslut.  <br> those childbearing hips </br>  <br>I liked this butt shot.<br><br>I disliked the logic jumps  Sensei was in love with the trap  and  The human chairs were his girlfriends  felt more like bullshit profiling based on nothing than real deduction based on evidence.<br>Come the fuck on, you have 2 full episodes to set up a mystery, at let leave some clues for the viewer you lazy fuckers.<br>The trick to catch the criminal was also bottom of the barrel colombo-tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's a shame that the fanbase for this is so cancerous.  <br><br>I've seen boys with hips and butts like that, they just generally don't wear as tight clothes as this one is.<br><br>We live in an age of omnipandering.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and the autopsy sequence was really fun too.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING WAY THAT KOBAYASHI IS A BOY! NO FUCKING WAY AT ALL! THAT ASS IS UNJUST! THOSE HIPS ARE TOO LEWD!  MY DICK IS DIAMONDS!

It would be PERFECT to make a 4chan banner out of.</br>  Jesus, I need some lewd art of Kobayashi. I want to have hot steamy vanilla sex with him.  Fuck, I completely missed this clue  <br>I'm pretty sure it was the only clue.</br>  <br>What anime is this guy from?</br>  Is this Lerche? Gakkou Gurashi looked way better  <br><br>It's barely even a clue. It was public knowledge that the teacher was dismembered.</br></br>  <br>very subtle</br>  Regardless of gender, I would bury my face in this booty and worship it forever.  <br><br>Two nukes weren't enough</br></br>   You will never hit it from the back   <br>I only just now realized they also air the same day and have the same hair.  I want to see them fuck </br>  Does it have episodic crimes/short arcs or is there an overarching plot?  <br>Akechi's? Me too.</br>  I'm having a really hard time believing the MC is a boy. They could at least give him a more masculine necktie or something, instead of that pink frilly thing  <br>Well, when it comes to Akechi, I'd rather have him pound me from behind.</br>  <br>Seems like it's pretty episodic</br>  <br>Sensei being dismembered is all they know.<br>No one knows the shape he was in</br></br>   Akechi <br> In the original novels: scruffy adult, heavy smoker, happily married, very sociable and nice to kids <br> The anime turns him into an edgy teenager <br><br>Fuck you anime staff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it wasn't really clearly stated that it was different classrooms, if they said that as well it would have been a much better clue</br>   WAKE ME UP INSIDE.png     So is Kagami up to shady shit? The end of the episode seemed to foreshadow that he has some skeletons in his own closet.  <br>Post it in the Overlord thread.</br>  <br>Yeah you've got a point there</br>  <br>if they kept his original age everyone would call him a pedo though</br>  I want to gangbang this slut with /a/.  <br>Gotta get those fujobucks.</br>  <br>Is the gay class rep also based on a novel character, or is he original?</br>  <br>no one seemed to care much about the teacher being a pedo</br>  <br>Damn, those collarbones</br>  <br>I need ntr doujins immediately</br>  He really want those boypussy bad.  This show is fun  <br> PORN   WHEN?! </br>  <br> ntr <br>No.</br></br>  <br>Can you blame him?</br>  <br>Hopefully Japan picks up the slack.</br>  <br> that cheerful look <br> "i want that" </br></br>  My brain does not work well with Kobayashi being a guy. This pretty much sums up how I see him.  <br> it wasn't really clearly stated that it was different classroom <br>What does this have to do with anything? What matters is whether anyone knows the shape he was in or not, which no one by Kobayashi and Hashiba do</br></br>  Sluttiest MC of the season? I just can't get rid of this NTR aura when I'm watching this show.  <br>Dem ass </br>  You can always trust Funi to provide the highest quality translations.  <br>it's okay if it's gay ntr</br>  <br>Rejoice! Your mind is beginning to write its own doujin, though you might need to read less ntr ones.</br>   they all wanted to be chairs! <br><br>Must be easy these days to find girls to turn into furniture. Ikea is going out of business any moment now.</br></br>  <br>I would be a pedo if I was teacher with Kobayashi as my student.</br>  <br>I honestly can't blame the teacher for lusting for Kobayashi</br>  <br>You need to search for suicidal girls</br>  <br>Flirting with his teacher in his imagination, he is such a tease.</br>  <br>how would you phrase it?</br>  <br>I don't care who said that's a boy. It's a fucking girl.</br>  Murderer was a cutie.  <br> This show is tanoshii <br>ftfy</br></br>  the hottest thing about kobayashi isn't even his lewd body<br>it's that complete comfort he has with depravity</br>  Would you become a chair for your waifu?  <br>Everyone's body looks way to small for their head.</br>  <br>Tell me about it. Could you imagine all the weird, kinky stuff he'd be willing to do? Sex with Kobayashi would be absolutely amazing.<br><br> I character hasn't turned me on this much in a long time. </br></br></br>    <br> you will never become a furniture for your waifu/husbando. <br>Why even live.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Sensei cuts herself.  Who the fuck writes this shit?  <br>He is, and he's just a friend of Kobayashi and not gay.<br>Pretty much none of the characters resemble their original.</br></br>  <br>I really wanted her to be Akechi, such a shitty character. I wish she'd just die.</br>  <br>You do realize Edogawa Ranpo gets his name from Edgar Allan Poe, right?<br>That's why his mysteries are creepy as fuck</br></br>  <br>n-not bad</br>  <br>It really isn't a clue, when the freaking suspect was basically a random third party whose face we didn't even get to see.</br>  Sensei a cute.

I can't wait for it to arrive!  <br>Because Nirvana, MANIme, street boxing and skaete bording.</br>  <br><br> Waiting for a fansub <br> Literally waiting months for shitty pirate copies to hear something in your glorious Japanese-jin so you can read your favorite anime. <br><br>This is why subfags are now and always will be inferior to dubfags. <br><br>Pic related. I'm sure ADV will get the rights to End of Evangelion before your shitty fansub gets ripped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did you guys feel about naruto gaiden?  <br>OP is next DB<br>Naruto will be the next Saint Seiya with multiple spin-off by different authors.</br></br>  <br>I could see SP doing some form of continuation or Last-era story but not Kishi himself.</br>  <br> Naruto Super </br>  <br> Not even a word about ships <br> Y-you're just like me! I can't be the only one this pathetic <br>Whatever makes you happy.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind a little filler if they decide to animate the Gaiden. Just so we can see what everyone else is doing amidst the Uchiha Maury-tier drama.</br></blockquote>]
