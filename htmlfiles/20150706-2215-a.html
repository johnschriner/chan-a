[ no thread so i'll make a new one<br><br>part 2 subs are up now http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx<br><br>here's some quality Toei animation for you</br></br></br></br>  Anyone have the link to the Dbs torrent?  <br>It's on nyaa.</br>  Needs more piccolo  <br><br>Thank You biased anon.</br></br>  <br> first episode was utter, complete fillershit <br> The anime will use both BoG and RoF as ARCs = more filler <br> Gohan is a pansy <br> Goten is getting turned into a Pansy <br> Videl is waifumaterial <br> Chi-chi is a bitch as always <br> Satan is still a gloryloving faggot pansy <br> Satan is still not revealed to be a dud <br> Buu is hungry <br> Goten and Trunks are kids <br> Goten and Trunks fight a snake. On ground. Punching it several times. Before out of sheer exhaustion, not beaten, the snake leaves <br> Goten and Trunks the Episode <br> Goten and Trunks the episode the movie <br> Goku works with a fucking tractor, is a radish farmer <br> Goku gets gorillion money, leaves to train immediately <br> Bills is JAPANESE CUHRAYZIE Let's blow up shit randumb with some what have learned today consequence bullshit <br> Fat Bills <br> Bills destroys a planet filler on par with Vegeta destroys the bug planet in DBZ <br> Reused footage of DBZ - also known as the Bleach syndrome <br> No mention of Goku wishing for Uub <br> Roshi wants to buy perverted videos with the money <br>Meanwhile, in a sensible universe:<br> Piccolo watches with utter, sheer disgust about how Gohan is a complete pansy. While Gohan is the strongest in the universe. And he does nothing. <br><br>Piccolo best father since 1989.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Age 733 - Bulma is born <br> Age 737 - Goku born <br> Age 739 - Beerus goes to sleep for 39 years <br> Age 774 - Majin Buu arc, and Dragon Ball Super 6 months later <br> Age 778 - Battle of Gods <br> Age 779 - Pan is born and Fukkatsu no "F" <br><br>In Battle of Gods, Bulma reveals it's her 38th birthday, which doesn't make sense, as that would be in Age 771. However, Mai accidentally reveals that she is 41 years old, which would make her 3 years older than Bulma (believable) or the same age as Goku (if Bulma was lying), which doesn't make any goddamn sense.<br><br>Videl gets pregnant just prior to Battle of Gods. The next episode preview shows many events that happen in Battle of Gods, like Goku in a blue and white tracksuit on Kaio's world and Vegeta training against laser bots in the spaceship. The end of the episode with East Kaioshin and Old Kaioshin sensing Beerus also corresponds to the beginning of Battle of Gods.<br><br>This is not something that can act as a simple retcon to the movies. You need fetus Pan for the whole Super Saiyan God thing to even work, but it's far too early for Videl to even be pregnant.<br><br> FIFTH UNIVERSE, NOT SEVENTH </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goten turns into a normalfag, not a pansy</br>  <br> Chi-chi: "let's find the best teachers for you in the whole world!" <br> Goten: "I'd like a side order of fuck me in the ass too please, mom." <br><br>That's how he is. A pansy. not a normalfag.<br>Although, i guess it is true. Gohan is Goten's father.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the method of creating a Super Saiyan God is being "retconned." It's always been the low-point of the movie for me. <br><br>Also, ever since Dragon Ball Minus we've known that Goku and Bulma are the same age. Goku was already 3 years old when he was sent to Earth.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Goku turns into Crono as a Super Saiyan God <br> The plot begins to make Time-travel noises <br> Dragonball Cross. <br><br>The japanese "DC universe" huehueuheuheh ;^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wouldn't mind having a db general. Any of you guys play xenoverse?  <br><br>Why no english subtitles?</br></br>  <br> Goku and Bulma are the same age <br>That doesn't make sense. Goku is half her height when they meet. He's 12 years old and she's 16, though he says he's 14 because he doesn't know how to count. Bulma just can't be 12 out of nowhere, and Goku can't be 16 either, or else he's 23 years old when he defeated Daimao Piccolo.<br><br>Maybe Minus took place at a different time than Jaco.</br></br></br></br>  Please tell me I can watch the Anime Labs subs online somewhere?  Was the first episode going for a slice-of-life type feel? I don't mind but at least make the episodes entertaining, this one was kind of meh. Old DBZ got it right at times, like with the Gohan's birthday episode or Piccolo/Goku driving episode.  <br><br> anything that is not mindless AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>A and fighting over 10 episodes is filler pansy shit</wbr> <br><br>Fucking mexicans and their dbz shit.</br></br></br></br>   rewatching original DB <br>This is amazing, id love if they go for this kind of thing</br>  <br>It could do without the snake fight, but the idea of shopping around for Gohan and Videl's wedding gift is a solid concept for an episode.</br>  <br>Find some old Geocities websites or whatever from the mid to late 90s using an archive in an attempt to find old uploads.</br>  <br>If you're gonna play a db game bt3 is the only viable option, xenoverse a shit</br>  <br>You didn't like the power up screaming?<br><br>If you close your eyes<br>It sound like they were letting out the biggest poop ever.<br><br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If someone streams it I would be up for watching it.</br>  <br>He was a Chad in GT anyway. He was just about slaying pussy.</br>  <br> subbing ressurrection of F <br>Where i live that movie is on the teathers.</br></br>  <br>Goten is so alpha.</br>  Which sub group did you guys watch dbs from? I was going to go with AnimeRG but niggas are bashing them in the comments.  <br><br> BT3 <br><br>Play either Budokai 3, which is god tier, or budokai tenkaichi 2, that nailed the system perfectly and has a better overall feel.<br>Not to mention that Budokai Tenkaichi 2 has an amazing ost.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kyj<wbr>vYLRV32A</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3F5<wbr>QAkcUcUk</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cvP<wbr>8F70FXYU</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=keC<wbr>mKNtb71M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where I live we have running water and uninterrupted electricity.</br>  I cant fucking deal with the Japanese voices.  <br>OHOHOHOH</br>  <br>well obviously she says she is turning 38, she would never say she was over 40 until she is at least 50.</br>  <br>Thank you for your substantial and valued opinion. Might I suggest you wait for the inevitable english dub?</br>   <br>I'm watching  The latin dub  because it's one of the few dubs that are actually really good and they're extremely faithful to the source material, not to mention they keep everything and even the intros sound better.<br>Already watched it on jap years ago so.<br><br>Is this your first time hearing the japanese voices?<br>Have you fucks ignored Dragon ball since Z?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I waited my ass off for Battle of the gods I cant keep waiting</br>  <br> mexicans and their dbz shit <br>Mexican grew with DB unlike burgers.</br></br>  <br>But did you never played the games? They usually had the japanese voices in most versions.<br>Trust me you get used to it.</br></br>  I just watched Revival of F and Frieza keeps saying that he was in the hell of Earth. Does that mean that every planet has its own version of hell?  <br>I know, I'm a latinfag.<br>DBZ is really overrated while DB gets tossed aside by everyone, it's really sad.</br></br>   I really like mexican food whilst watching my animes  thank you mexibros   <br>not that guy but fuck you chen.<br><br>Dragon Ball had great VA, until goku aged up and he was suddenly a huge dude with a tiny girlish voice.<br><br>i honestly hate every minute of grandma goku. and started going back to the English dub once it got to piccilo jr. arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  will this lead up to the last episode of Z where's it's something like 10 years after the buu fight?  <br>This, this forever. I loved the episode, hope the whole show is that + more Mr. Satan.</br>  <br>Yes, then it ends with GT confirmed canon and that theyre continuing it.<br> And I'd love that </br></br>  <br>The lack of reruns made it forgettable.</br>  <br> try to find a kid goku fig <br> all the ones with joints are adult goku and super saiyan shit, millions of them <br> barely anything from original DB </br></br></br>    <br> Red ribbon <br>I miss those guys<br><br>Looking back it was anything but forgettable, it has so many good characters.<br>I still remember laughing my ass off to Tao Pai Pai</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are these subs? Why are they yellow? Why are they such low quality? Who was Hank? Did the sub maker know him? Why would he talk to one guy in a sub release? I have to know the story behind these subs.</br>  <br>I just got a wave of nostalgie.<br><br>Now I don't know what to do with my life.</br></br></br>  So we get a<br> Battle of the Gods arc <br> Resurrection of F arc <br>What other arcs?<br><br>Xenoverse arc? Victory Mission arc?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck the haters ssj4 was goat<br>when vegeta mentions the legendary super saiyan on namek it shows a oozaru, sjj4 makes more sense than progressively longer/spiker hair</br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck young Bulma was so good<br> dat shotgun </br></br>  <br>If you've followed the information for the show, they are doing their own arcs after the movie one being them going to Universe 6<br><br><br> fuck the haters ssj4 was goat <br>It's never been goat anything. It's completely ridiculous</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>DB was a thousand times superior compared to Z</br></br>  <br>You have so many questions.</br>  <br> sjj4 makes more sense <br>The purpose of evolution is going forwards not backwards.</br></br>  <br>These were the old sub tapes that were sold at comic cons back in the 90s.

This is just cruel.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean that they were copies of copies of copies of copies in some cases.</br>  <br>Where did you watch it?</br>  <br>"It takes some balls to come to earth half-dead in a tin suit, just to get killed." i really wish this was the original line, that line is bad-ass</br>  <br>Thats so nonsensical, after having his potential released he shouldn't even need to turn supersaiyan to have his full power.</br>  <br>It's funny as hell.<br>Hopefully he gets humiliated even more.</br></br>  <br>you gotta cut him some slack, isn't it much more reasonable to obtain an education for a brighter future than spending all your time training for the slight possibility of a villain capable of wiping out all of your superpowered professional martial-art friends and father who happens to be the strongest being in the universe?</br>  why the obsession with gohan?<br><br>he was annoying in saiyan saga and namek saga and had literally one cool moment in the whole series. His "ultimate" form in buu saga still lost.</br></br>  <br>It's more like turning more into a monkey<br><br>SS4 tried to copy this concept but for some reason it gave Goku pants, black hair and he lost the golden motif. Seriously, I have no idea why anybody thought that was a good idea</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, this is six months after Boo so he can still go to his highest state of Ultimate Gohan.<br><br>Another mark for Super against GT in that regard now that I think about it</br></br></br>  <br>It basically gets handwaved as "lol he didn't train so now he sucks more than Krillin, LOL NERD"<br><br>It pisses me off for a couple of reasons, for one there is no reason that he should be that much weaker, he slacked off for years between the Cell and Buu sagas and could still go SS2 (albeit a weaker version than when he fought Cell but he could still do it) but somehow, despite actually being even stronger at the end of the Buu saga he loses all of his strength in even less time. <br><br>It also reduces the amount of capable fighters in the show by one more, which pisses me off because it was already stale when all we had was Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Gotenks in the Buu saga and everyone else was too shit to do anything. Now we literally just have Goku and Vegeta as the only not shit fighters in the whole damn thing, it's so fucking stale having such a small portion of the cast being the only ones who ever actually DO anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it that those that complain the most about DBS are either niggers or mexicans? Niggers always claim that DBZ started with Raditz going to earth while Mexicans don't like anything not AAAAAAHHHHHHHH from the DB franchise.</br>  <br>Holy shit this is great</br>  <br>I'd like to think that Elder Kai unlocking his potential, while giving him a huge power boost, degrades faster without training due to being a super natural power up.<br><br>Besides it doesn't really matter if Gohan can only go super saiyan or still have his potential unlocked, the gap between him and Beerus is so big it isn't even relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>that's his Ultimate form you idiot<br><br>quoting:<br><br> "as Ultimate Gohan, he surpasses Super Saiyan 2 and even Super Saiyan 3 (according to the Super Exciting Battle Guide; he is confirmed stronger than Gotenks in the manga/anime). Daizenshuu 2 states that Ultimate Gohan is still capable of becoming a Super Saiyan, but even without utilising the form he surpasses Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks in power, if Ultimate Gohan was to become a Super Saiyan his power would likely rise to levels above even Super Buu (Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks absorbed)." </br></br></br></br></br>  Wait a fucking second, someone enlighten me please<br><br>Battle of Gods starts 4 years after the battle with Buu<br><br>Super starts 6 months after the battle with Buu<br><br>Both are canon<br><br>Why did they set the start of Super earlier than BoG?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try watching the original dragon ball in Japanese. It makes the transition a lot better than just going from adult goku dub to adult goku sub</br>  <br> LOL NERD <br><br>Piccolo pls</br></br></br>  <br>They are basically going to re-imagine BoG and RoF in the anime.</br>  <br>they're retelling the movies so all the little shounens in japan that didn't watch the movies will still watch</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's just Americans<br><br><br>Super is reimagining the movies as story arcs</br></br></br></br>  Whats so mystic about mystic gohan?  How many episodes is Super anyway?  <br>Because fuck the authority.</br>  <br>Mystic Gohan is a fan term. His real name for that form is Ultimate Gohan because they directly call it that as the ultimate pinnacle of his power<br><br><br>We don't know. There was a listing for 100 but that was a placeholder and they removed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mystic </br>  <br>Goku and Vegeta are terrible characters, the series focusing on them while actively sidelining everyone else, even those who are meant to surpass or take over the hero role from them, was one of the reasons DBZ is almost as bad as the likes of Naruto.</br>  <br><br><br> Super is reimagining the movies as story arcs <br><br>No? Goku is going to train with Kaio as he was in BoG, we didnt know how many time Goku spent with him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything to get away from his family</br>  <br><br>that's another reason why DB was so great, even at the wma tournaments every matchup was fair because they were all so similar in strength. even tien gave goku a run for his money</br></br>  Where can I find this cam rip of Resurrection F that's mentioned in the pastebin?  <br>We probably are still in the Yo! Son Goku and his Friends Return arc, or just a bit after it, since Goku's outfit.</br>  Guys. Does anyone have a link to the fan-made Dragon Ball recut with removed filler?

Muh consistency, muh rules!"<br><br>Japan will never change a system as long as it's somehow running, even when it's obvious that the system is a complete failure and only produces sub-par output. Look at their economy. Almost two decades of neverending recession, but as long as they don't starve...</br></br></br>  <br> Getting news from blogs <br> To shitpost on /a/ </br></br>  <br>This WAS partly true for video game industry. Not anymore really aside from mobile platforms. Industry needs specialists nowadays and not enthusiasts.<br><br>With animation, less and less people get into it since its litteral slavery - at begining you get barely paid at all and worked to death, and then still worked to death to just be able to buy food.<br><br>There simply is not enougth animators willing to work on those conditions in industry - even the young talented ones rather still work on video games and or porn than that.<br><br>So there are two options<br>1) Animation outsources almost completely to poor countries (partially true now).<br>2) CGI - inevitable trend already happening</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There is literally nothing wrong with yaraon.</br></br>  BASED KYOANI<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D<br><br>K<br>Y<br>O<br>A<br>N<br>I</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Shirobako propaganda didn't work huh?</br>  <br> shows that CG is inevitable and makes a lot more money <br><br>Nice propaganda.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked insofar as it made a killing, which was its job. <br><br>Seems like something is always about to kill the industry. If it's not the "Unfeasible" business model based on bd sales, overworked animators, or what it'll be something else we'll be worrying about mean while they're still making stuff as they always have.</br></br></br>  <br> CGI <br>Maybe it won't be so terrible in the future? I hate CGI, but I've seen some cute vocaloid dance videos.</br></br>  One thing mentioned in article - is that now, productivity is actually lower than in 80th,90th. Because anime became HD, and it takes just lot more work to draw all the small details and maintain high definition imagery - both in animation and post processing and editing.  <br> Nips instant noodles price = decent chink's meal <br>Chinese cartoon would find a way.</br></br>  <br><br> Why can't the other Jap studios figure out that happier workers = more productive workers? <br><br>Why can't every company on the planet figure that out?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, let's blame resolution in a medium that:<br>a. has an analogue source (remastered Gunbuster BDs have more detail than your average shit nowadays) or<br>b. is using tablets to draw on (how the fuck does using a bigger canvas make it harder to work is beyond me)<br><br>Only thing that COULD slow down production is computing power, but that is a technical issue that can be solved by tossing money at it. Now, if the companies really can't afford to invest a few tens of thousands of dollars into hardware once in a while then the medium is truly fucked.<br><br>CG ain't gonna solve anything in this regard either if that is the case - you still need high-res textures for it to look good and you still need to render shit, which still uses massive amounts of computing power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I keep meaning to watch this but I always forget about it. Just like how I never finished the first episode and I didn't even drop the show, I just forget about its existence which is apparently a good thing.</br>  <br>Aside being yaraon.</br>  KyoAni's staff only get payed 90,000 yen a month, I know Kyoto is cheaper then Tokyo but Ghibli pays more.<br><br>Rough Draft pays 18,000 won a hour.<br><br>But in the end, TMS is TMBest paying at 1,320,000 yen a month at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 700 USD a month <br> in Japan </br></br>  <br><br>It's pretty much a clickbait site. Also the OP is completely making shit up as the article it quotes never once mentions any studio by name, but people will believe it because it's what they want to believe. That's what I hate about dumb anime fans.</br></br>  <br>Why can't the all Japs figure out that happier workers = more productive workers?<br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>Because capitalism. Measure your worth as a person by how much money you make.</br>  <br><br>Cause the whole insinuation is complete bullshit and something people just made up based on heresay and what's convenient. The OP just picked two studios that sound good to dumb anime fans and inserted them into the topic even though the only studio mentioned in the article is Disney/Pixar to which the answer of whether Japan could ever attain that level is pretty much no.</br></br>  Thank god not all Japanese studios are like this, TMS is one of the most highest payed studios in the country with directors getting payed at least 6600 yen a hour, KyoAni &amp; Ghibli also payed high as well but then budget cuts happen and when KyoAni down sized as well as give pay cuts, Ghibli rebuild it self.  <br><br>Literally. Never. Said. In. Article. Stop being so gullible.</br></br>  Apparently Japan has a lot of "black companies"? Companies where they don't pay their employees for working over-time.<br>I'm all for preserving culture but working in nippon is fucked. It's arguably the only thing where some things should be changed.</br>  <br><br>Sad but pretty much inevitable.</br></br>  <br>Can't you translate it?</br>  <br>It's the same thing here in America, just look at CalArts and Disney.</br>  <br>More like<br> alive workers = more productive workers <br>When a country is introducing more holidays to keep people from keeling over and is considering "death from overwork" an actual issue that needs to be addressed you know shit is fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>TMS also has working conditions as well.<br><br>Excellent really.<br><br><br>This. I did not post those posts however as the info about Ghibli &amp; KyoAni are outdated on the later post.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off famicom you autistic fuck. Stop spreading unsourced misinformation and pretending a dead shitty studio that barely even makes its own anime and is mostly just subcontracting is even slightly relevant or important anymore just because of your deluded fanboy nature.</br>  <br> TMS also has working conditions as well. <br>Then why is their show`s quality so shit?</br></br>  <br><br>Just use google chrome and the auto translate plugin.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure Toei are poor bitches too.</br>  <br>I did not post that, someone copied what TMSGuy did months ago.<br><br>But What I get is not misinformation and is from 2ch.<br><br>TMS is not dead.<br>http://www.tms-e.co.jp/<br>http://www.telecom-anime.com/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Toei and Sunrise for longest time were the riches studios, like.. having ten times combined wealth of others.<br><br>Sunrise won this fight back in 2007 or so and is leading since, but i dont think Toei is poor. They have PreCure, One Piece and plenty other money bringing shit along the rights on merchandize.</br></br></br>  <br>Bad outsourcing to lesser studios.</br>  <br>Nice source.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br> Only KyoAni and PA Works <br><br>Yes I'm sure every single studio in Japan has worse conditions. Downright terrible. Only KyoAni and P.A. works figured it out.</br></br></br>  <br>TMS also figured it out as well.</br>  <br>We get it, TMS are the best.</br>  <br>Your sarcasm is misplace, because it is exactly as you wrote.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Nice samefag, famicom.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know, just don't forget to include them in "Studios that pay well &amp; treat their staff right".</br>  <br> &amp;  are not me.</br>  <br>Yes I'm sure you're knowledgeable about the working conditions of all Japanese animation studios.</br>  <br>Fuck off, Famicom. No one needs your made-up bullshit.</br>  <br>That is not me and it is not bullshit.</br>  <br>Why would they want to leave the best studio there is?</br>  <br> Disney/Pixar to which the answer of whether Japan could ever attain that level is pretty much no. <br>And we should be thankful for it. Disney/Pixar has generally great animation but you'll have to perform eldritch rituals for them to make something that isn't made solely for kids, or that isn't le ebin fairytale musical. Japanese animation mostly has OK animation but it can manage to turn out varied and interesting content at least once per year. In terms of content, Western animation is pretty much dead today (as is Western 2D animation), but as an industry it's much more comfortable than the Japanese one.</br></br>  <br> implying radiation poisoning isn't going to kill Japan anyway </br>  CG in Etotama was pretty good. I wouldn't mind something like that.  <br>The little teaser scene after the last ep  (s2 never ;_;)  showed that it works well without the chibi look, too. I really hope other studios take note.</br>   Anime is dead <br> Gamers are dead <br><br>Fucking SJWs are everywhere ruining good things. Leave us alone.</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that's how a Japanese person is supposed to live, right?<br>The company is a family. You don't leave your family behind.</br></br>  Only Kyoani can save anime  <br>SJWs have nothing to due with animation and poor paying. I get more money doing my part time job. It's really sad.</br>  <br>Gaming was dead long before sjws.</br>  It's a failure in marketing. People don't give a shit about anime, so there's no business model. You can't run a studio by not making profit.  <br>Shut the fuck up pseudo-journalist. You're the parasite that creates this kind of drama because money.</br>  Out of all studios, i bet A-1 is the worse of the worse for employees.  <br>Aren't they the ones that literally worked one to death</br>  <br>People have been dooming and glooming about this exact same shit for literally like a fucking decade now and yet the industry has been chugging along at full steam. <br><br>I also don't think it is sustainable, but generally animators have other ways of getting by in addition to animating, which they do as like a combination of a job and a hobby out of passion for the industry. Otherwise they would literally not be able to survive with that job.<br><br>I still think the situation isn't good and hope it improves, I just wonder how. I think maybe it would require the entire TV network system in Japan to be overhauled, as currently basically the studios pay the networks to air them (at least for the late night shows which are nearly all the ones we watch) and don't get ad revenue. It's pretty fucked up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yaraon <br>Fuck off, retard.</br></br>  <br>Please read the article carefully. Those noodles are given as a reward, they are not part of the payment. <br><br>If the animators eat together they get to know each other better and therefore they improve their teamwork and the resulting anime has higher quality.</br></br></br>  <br> Anime is dying article #74590035 <br><br>I've heard this since the late 80s. I'm sure this time is for real, that blog sounded super cereal.</br></br></br>  <br> not shaft </br>  <br> SJWs <br> Japan <br><br>Nope.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Kyoani <br> PA Works <br> Ever making a masterpiece <br><br>How many anime have you seen faggot<br><br>Nothing they have made is a 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You still don't get it? The article OP refers to does say something entirely different from what he stated.</br>  <br> how to say something without saying anything </br>  <br> Only KyoAni and PA Works <br>Yeah based Sunrise doesn't exist or anything.</br></br>  Your average slave grinding call center job pays more. Even minimum wage pays more. How the fuck do they charge 70 USD for blu-ray and pay the animators like slaves?  Is Production I.G still alive?  <br> what is k-on </br>  <br>There's no audience. No one watches anime, no one buys anime. The few exceptions are exactly that: exceptions.</br>  <br>Shit.</br>  <br> ITT: animators paid with instant noodles, no new animators/idiots working for noodles, anime dead <br> nothing has changed </br></br>  If the audience in Japan is apparently so small then why don't they make more of an effort to get it over seas themselves? Surely the investment to create a bigger audience help them in the end?   wanted sci-fi or /m/ <br> knights of sidonia season 1 was okay <br> mfw this shit <br>Convince me not to drop season 2 right now</br></br></br>  CG shit, drop it like it's hot.

The party house keeps on expanding. They get the tsunbot, best girl polls and the like.

Like as not if they ever got that far (while still sticking to the story, which they don't look like they will be as much now) there would be worse harem shit as OC filler type nonsense as we saw with the date. <br>As the two stand as separate objective works the Manga is better in general but worse for harem shit.</br></br>  <br>The final ep is garbage.

In case the anon who wanted more pics of my Lego garde is here: Here you are. Made a few small changes and, aside from the stand, it can all be made with set 31034.  <br>Nicely done /a/non.</br>  <br> Implying this isn't cute as fuck <br> Implying alien tentacle monster isn't best girl </br></br>  <br>Forgot to add: It's not a very sturdy build, so making a stand for it is a good idea. But with a bit of patience, it can stand up on its own.<br><br><br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, just noticed that there is a single part in there, the one the stand connects to, which isn't in the set. Isn't necessary for the figure itself, though.</br>  <br>You should fuck off forever with you cg crap</br>  <br>No, you're just from reddit</br>  <br>It's so bad, it's good in its own way.</br>  <br> fights <br>They were turned into shit with anime original resolves</br></br>  <br> Implying you ain't part of the cancer that is violently killing Sidonia. </br>  <br> but worse for harem shit. <br>Ah, so you mean that in the sense that it's worse if that's what you're looking for, true. I thought you meant that harem is more distracting in the manga than in the anime.</br></br>  <br> those manly arms and shoulders <br><br>it looks like a trannie</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing important actually changed in the end fight, they just added more flash to it for the finale. Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai the story could move back to the manga line quite easily.</br>  <br> Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai <br>Did that happen? It got packed into Toha crate and taken away. <br>Nagate probably asked Kunato about the first one during the party.</br></br></br>  <br>Well memed anonymous. Your taste is shit though.</br>  Does anyone have the webm of the bombardment?  <br>Kunato said like he had Benijiro when the crate is clearly THI's.</br>  <br>The crate was just made by THI.</br>  <br>In the manga,  Kunatochiai is denied access to it soon after. </br>  <br> Is the captain going to give it to Tanikaze for their anniversary? </br>  HOLDING YOU TOO IT ANON  <br>Nagate asked him what was going to happen to "Hoshijiro" IIRC, Kunatochiai said something along the lines of always needing a spare. That means he got BeniJiro as well.</br>  <br><br>I didn't look through the thread before I posted that, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>At least until the Capitan revokes his mad science privileges.</br>  They clearly fucked.  <br>we know anon</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>No problem.</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>He could mean  Kanata  as well.</br>  I felt the same OP, But the last 3-4 episodes were fucking great.<br><br>That's what Sidonia should be about Gauze fighting/Benesuzume type shit not the romance garbage, What annoys me more is the amazing setting it is in and hurr we'll just turn it into some sort of space shitty love story.</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/ywmvxoujac.web<wbr>m</wbr>  <br>RIP pomf</br>  <br>But the romance garbage is the integral part of Sidonia story.</br>  is there enough content for a season 3 ?  <br>yes there is anon</br>  <br>EP 5 was the best episode</br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>I was hooked to this show because of this episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Great taste. For me it's tied with S2 episode 11, though.</br>  <br><br>Although I liked Hoshijiro, it was just about the sustainability of the Tsugumori, and that's not something we see in many other mecha shows</br></br>  <br>It also served to develop their relationship, so her death would affect Nagate more.</br>  <br>Thats also another reason I like that episode, relationship development. Its also why I liked Hoshijiro x Nagate more then Nagate x Izana, more development</br>  <br> 2-3 episodes long relationship <br> still better than all series long one <br>Not funny at all.</br></br></br>  <br>don't get me wrong, I like them both</br>  <br>Their relationship (not in the romantic sense) started in the first episode, so it's 6 episodes.</br>  <br>Honestly, I like them both too.<br>But really, I'm for whatever results in more SPESS battles.</br></br>  <br>This is all I could think of when I hear her.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x47<wbr>NYUbtYb0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That was romance done well for Sidonia IMHO. The pure harem SoL shit not so much.</br>  <br>they essentially just mimicked Rick and Minmei being stuck outside the ship</br>  <br>Be that as it may, it fits the themes and motifs of Sidonia very well while the excessive SoL sticks out and dilutes the story and to make it worse all the haremshit doesn't even develop relationships all that much.</br>  <br>i agree and maybe if i hadn't watched Macross when i was a kid it would have been more special, the harem stuff is getting old but really this show is just a mishmash of Macross/Tenchi etc. still really enjoying it.<br>Second season was more filler sadly.<br>what does Sol mean?</br></br></br>  <br> what does Sol mean? <br>Slice of life</br></br>  <br>It's not even about being special, it's just that it fits very well with the themes and doesn't feel tacked on or excessive. The 908497862 scenes of moe Tsumugi making squeaky balloon sounds don't really bring anything.</br>  <br>  3D <br>  Anime <br>Choose one</br></br></br>  <br>it was awful at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and tbh space scenes are gr8</br>  <br>Nah, I don't think so. Why would he answer Nagate's question with something completely unrelated, especially since Nagate has no idea Kanata even exists in the first place at this point?</br>  what is the significance of the the Captains Mask?   not recognizing that smoogi is the best girl on sidonia <br><br>captain is runner-up</br></br>  <br>because she has cleft lip</br>  <br>She's immortal and has been Captain for a fuck-long time, it's so people don't see her face and notice.</br>   yfw you realise the Placenta   hardens in response to physical trauma   <br>She was cuter without the tits tbh</br>  Okay I just marathoned this and I'm a little disappointed. I actually didn't mind when it turned into a full on SoL/romance in S2. But they didn't even fucking deliver on that? He gets the perfect setup by wing-grandma and he fucking jobs hard. The most we get is him telling best girl that she's important to him. Why can't he pilot his goddamned dick as well as he pilots the Tsugumori?<br><br>The ending was pretty meh and gave off a "yeah there's no S3" kind of vibe. God damnit.</br></br>  <br>Does it really matter as long as the face remains?</br>  <br>Because he was raised underground by a single old dude who only taught him how to kill Gauna and in Izana's case it's compounded by other things:<br> she wasn't a she at all when they met <br> she puts up an image of being tough and not needing help </br></br></br>  <br>How is it even possible to deny that pic related is best Izana?</br>  <br> Used original OP in final episode battle <br>11/10 just for that choice alone.</br></br>  <br><br>this is best Izana</br></br>  <br>That was cool, but it also reminded me how absolutely garbage the 2nd ED was compared to the first.</br>  <br>There are several others that are close, but not that one.</br>  Anyone know where I can download the 100 sites of sidonia that they used in the anime? I can only find the manga versions. Am I gonna have to screencap them myself?    <br>I'm rather partial to this one.</br>  <br>It's more interesting now that  she has thrown the mask away helping injured staffs herself after an MUS ate 1/8 of the ship .</br>  <br>I wonder if Nagate and Izana ended up skinny dipping together.</br>  why hasn't she kissed Tanikaze yet?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised either way.</br>  <br>because she's not dead, immortal or had a penis</br>  <br>Do the BeniJiro count as both dead and immortal?</br>  <br>Nagate is dense and she seems to be either unable or unwilling to act drastically enough.</br>  <br>yes, and she's not human, she's an aberration to nature and should be killed with fire alongside with Tsumugi</br>  <br>Izana, pls.</br>  <br> Izana <br> wishing to harm Tsumugi <br>When she got BTFO by Tsumugi all she could say was that she's happy for her</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she doesn't consider the balloon sausage actual competition?</br>  <br>it's kinda weird the relationship between Izana, Nagate and Tsumugi, for moments they look like a family with Tsumugi as a child and there are some parts in the manga were it seems that there is something about to happen between Izana and Nagate but it just stays there</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's not true.<br> we were rejected </br></br>  <br>I saw that too, the curse of haremshit.<br><br>Well, they still have the "not an alien tentacle that's technically the daughter of his first love interest" thing going for them.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw nothing to cuddle at all </br>  this scene remind me this <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=45b<wbr>UOIK2cAo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Is there any ep12 director's cut not on Netflix out there?  <br>what would be different?</br>  So, what's the consensus on the fates of the other seed ships?  <br><br>we all know who really wins</br></br>  <br>The aliums?</br>  <br>She never really wins since the Bowl she was in had been done and she wasn't the winner and never will be.</br>  so what attacked norio and his assistant in the first episode of season 2?  <br>Borg implants made of aliens.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Toxine was cactus?</br>  <br>i swear i saw a 6" person with a sword</br>  <br>She cut off Mozuku's fingers because Mozuku was trying to touch Ochiai's cactus.<br><br>She's very fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, I thought the cacti just had hyperdimensional razor spines or something.</br>  <br>little dude</br>  <br> rubber tentacle chan best girl <br><br>I know, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Um, where is Tsumugi's base attached there?</br>  Where the fuck can I download 12 ep director's cut?  <br>Most became gauna food, very few might be successful like Sidonia.

Kobayashi (?) I believe mentions that even a stationary colony would have trouble surviving long-term without Higgs-powered things. There's also the fact that Gauna started attacking when humanity started using Higgs and at that time fucking nobody knew that it was actually drawing them in, there would be little reason to not equip seed ships with the top-tier tech at the time.</br>  <br>That works on the assumption all the nations had the same tech level, I wouldn't be surprised if just about every theoretical sub light speed interstellar travel technology was used.</br>  Is it strange that I can totally get off to just this one image?  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Izana has been great since she took the pilot role; fighting 1-on-1 with Benisuzume only with a shield and survive in manga, and carrying unconscious Nagate's Tsugumori and herself out of a certain fatal crash in anime.</br>  <br>I find it somewhat implausible that at least the major nations/powers didn't cooperate and share tech when the very survival of the human race was at stake. There are quite a few examples in history of various civilizations that were more or less divided internally band together to fight large external threats, this should have applied to giant space tentacle monsters coming to consume humanity itself.<br><br>I'm not saying everyone turned into altruists to help the poorest of African states build seed ships, but it would have been stupid as fuck not to cooperate with other nations building their own seedships.</br></br></br>  <br>I kind of forgot, were they near a star or something when this happened? If not where was enough light for photosynthesis coming from?<br> Or did she "photosynthesize" to give Nagate a hint before what seemed like certain death? </br></br>  <br>Just saying, the Norks' strategically painted trashcan ship powered by nuclear explosions may get farther than the others. If it can leave the atmosphere.</br>  <br>When the Captain orgasmed (SUBARASHII) after watching the Graviton Beam Emitter blow a hole through a planet, it became obvious she was no longer (and perhaps never was) thinking rationally.<br>Examples:<br> we gun kill gauna hive MANY DA... i mean many times the size of sidonia <br> make me another electro-rave-laser-penis, but don't fuck it up like last time <br> bridge bunny: "captain, we should save izana, nagate and smoogy's best friend." <br> captain: "fuck that gender-bending bitch." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whatever, the particle is called, its made up. They're not higgs bossons. Whether they should translate it as Hyggs or Heigus is semantics.</br></br>  <br> captain: "fuck that gender-bending bitch." <br>That's pretty rational thought.<br><br>Jokes aside, what's the deal with the captain? Especially in the mango where he rapes dense pilots. Is she projecting Nagate's grandfather onto him or what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean there are people who don't think the Capitan is an Ork Warboss trapped in a practically immortal Nip body?</br>  <br> Ork Warboss <br> Electro-ray of doom <br> gauna-killer rifle spawn <br> ALL THE DAKKA <br>...it somehow makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love me some Stoner-chan.</br></br>  <br>I'd put some gravity vectoring in her, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Not to mention how she wants to get da Boys in a good tussle with the Gauna cluster.</br>  <br>The Immortal Council mentioned something about "gravity dementia". They probably weren't just making things up.</br>  <br> rapes <br>Yeah, Nagate was totally traumatized after using the captain's entrance for MANY DAYS.<br><br>On a more serious note, I think she legit wants what's best for Sidonia, namely to be able to live in peace without constant Gauna threat. Since so far the only contact with Gauna has been conflict, the only logical way to pursue this is to:<br> 1. Eliminate the current, immediate threat <br> 2. Have the capability to adequately defend Sidonia and any colonies against future LMUS attack </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chill man, it was consensual rape.</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit, this is why no aliens has come to this fucking earth</br>  <br>The Immortal Council also mentioned that it would have been easy to avoid Gauna space, but the Captain went there on purpose.</br>  <br>What are you implying, that they are shy and have height issues?<br><br> Because that's my fetish. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, fuck the metric system.</br>  slutty kobayashi is best kobayashi  <br>Foxy grandma best girl.</br>   dad walks in <br> looks at the big pink penis on the screen <br> looks at me <br> -I-it's ok anon, I respect gays.  <br> -It's not like that, dad... it actually is a cute girl.... </br></br></br></br>  <br>aliens are just too proud of thier size, and probably thinks human race cant satisfy them</br>  Everyone has the same face in the manga.  <br>That's what you get for being a Tsumugifag.</br>  <br>If your dad still has any faith in you, you're doing something wrong.</br>  <br>is this a new facepalm</br>  <br>why are the last 2 letters backwards?</br>  <br>Yure is a good but Izana is the best</br>  <br>mean to</br>  <br>Running forever without a weapon that can dispatch Gauna while keeping Sidonia and its inhabitants safe isn't really the best long-term option. What Kobayashi did is risky as fuck for sure, but if it works it will mean that for the first time in over 1000 years (?) humanity, as far as we know, humanity will have less to fear from the Gauna and may have a chance to establish a proper presence on a nice world.</br>  I fucking hate the manga for this. It was really good for the first half, but now it's just turned into haremshit.<br><br>FUCK YOU NIHEI</br></br>  <br>Because an alien clone with only a basic understanding of Japanese is trying to write in English?<br><br>Speak for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>yea, S2 sucked compared to S1.</br>  How do sweaty Izana's armpits smell like?  <br>Like sweaty Izana.</br>    <br> and probably thinks human race cant satisfy them <br>They are wrong.</br></br>   yfw Sidonia S3 in 2018   <br>Well, I want to watch The Fifth Element now.</br>  <br> I think she legit wants what's best for Sidonia <br>No one is questioning that, even Ochiai wanted that before he clashed with the captain.<br>However it's the ways and paths they want to take that is the problem. They are both doing horrible stuff and refuses to give up control because of the risk of them not ending out on top.<br><br>So far I have seen four camps.<br><br>Ochiai wants to evolve humanity, with him in lead.<br>Kobayashi wants to humans to be safe and keep tradition, with her in the lead.<br>Saitou wanted to trust the next generation.<br>Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager. <br>She's dead/an alien now.</br></br>  <br>Well yes, she got her wish.</br>  <br>I read the manga for a long time but eventually it just got too out there, like there was no actual goal in mind for the plot and they were just winging it.<br><br>If you don't like at this point you aren't going to like it going further in.</br></br></br>  <br>So what? She's trying to take Tanikaze with her?</br>  <br>At the time the Captain made the decision to cruise through Gauna space instead of going around, she had untested combatants and the only effective weapons were spears.<br>Perhaps she anticipated the development of the artificial Kabi-core bullets, but they were force to fight several Gauna before that, one of which was so close to catching them that she had to fuck up the ship in a high-g turn.</br></br>  <br>More of: She wanted understanding so much she ended up getting eaten.</br>  <br>It's getting really hard not to think of this show as AoT in space.</br>  <br>I never read the manga before watching the first season. My heart was genuinely shattered when they killed her.</br>  <br>There may be less opportunity for haremshit with the recent developments in the manga.<br><br><br>I don't think comparing any of the other 3 to Ochiai is fair. Ochiai started out by wanting to evolve humanity, but in the end his goal changed to simply evolving by himself by any means necessary and now is looking to actively destroy Sidonia. From what was a questionable course of action in the first place he went only downhill.<br><br>Kobayashi takes risks but the fundamental fact that she cares about Sidonia and its people doesn't change. She is very well aware she did some fucked up shit and her recent character development suggests she's trying to change and improve (coming clean to Nagate about who/what he is, ditching the mask, hands-on helping people and Lala's statement about her being gentler).<br><br>Hiroki and Hoshijiro don't even belong in the same category with Kobayashi in terms of what they're willing to do, much less so with Ochiai.<br><br><br>She's definitely willing to take risks and is well aware that people will die, but there's no way it wouldn't have happened eventually, what with Gauna being more powerful and faster anyway.<br><br>Escaping may have been potentially viable if they found another power source and ditched everything Kabi, but nobody knew that back then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hasn't Sidonia been a thing before AoT though?</br>  <br>Fuck if I remember, it all sort of blurs together.</br>  <br>Please don't associate AoT with Sidonia. It's sickening enough to hear this all the time in youtube comments or other places.<br><br><br>Same year, I believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to associate the two, but it's hard not to.</br>  <br><br>Well I looked it up, Sidonia started in April and AoT in September 2009. So I guess AoT is Sidonia in the middle-ish ages  and worse. </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Isayama Hajime stated that he was inspired by Knights of Sidonia to make Attack on Titan. That's why this tweet is so funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>AoT really took off after the anime adaption. I guess Nihei's art is just far more unappealing, even if compared to Isayama's earliest stuff. <br><br>I guess AoT is just more engaging to read, but I appreciate Nihei's art more.</br></br></br>  <br> Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager <br>I wouldn't call her naive for that. Not like she strongly believed or convinced that the gauna wanted to be friends. If anything, I'd call it a sign that she was more of a free thinker than most residents of Sidonia, as she wasn't as held back by the dogmatic hatred for Gauna that most have. Gauna don't seem to have any inherent intelligence, so hating them is like hating nature for natural disasters: Pointless.<br><br><br>Same here. Probably the main reason I immediately read through the manga was because I wanted to know what would happen with the placenta clones. The topic being untouched for over 30 chapters made me very sad.  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Responding to an admitted Yukinoshitter </br>  <br>It is fair.<br><br>Both Kobayashi and Ochia wanted was was best for humanity, they didn't see eye to eye on how they would achieve it and this is what made them clash.<br><br>Kobayashi wants to be in charge of Sidonia, she does not want anyone else to take over because she doesn't trust the next generation. Saitou wants to put faith in next generation, Kobayashi doesn't. This is where her and Saitou clashed.<br><br> coming clean to Nagate about who/what he is <br>She never told him everything, she is still wanting to be in control of the situation. She is feeding him bits of the whole truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off gauna apologist, they hunt and hurt humans for centuries even destroyed their home planet and expect them to not hate you?</br>  <br>I dunno, they seemed to figure out psyops pretty fast. None of the people who got eaten really screamed "I am a master of psychology"</br>  I'm having trouble convincing myself to finish S1. The characters are all bad, the action and mecha aren't very impressive, and the storytelling is kinda weird. <br><br>Kunato fucks up the mission for the dumbest fucking reason and MC just drops it and lets him get away with it. <br><br>Ochiai and info about his secret research is just hanging around Kunato's house for no reason for him to find.<br><br>Kabi bullets are invented out of nowhere with no buildup. <br><br>A planet busting missile combined with the planet itself blowing up can't scratch a gauna, but a spear can. <br><br>MC is surrounded by females who are desperate for his attention and there are no male characters to be found anywhere. <br><br>Izana being a hermaphrodite (at least so far) has no impact either on her character or on her romantic relationship with MC.<br><br>The demilitarization faction goes so far as to leave Sidonia guided by a retarded belief that we're given no evidence for. <br><br>There are other things that bothered me too that I can't recall off the top of my head. I guess none of them are completely story breaking, but overall the plot feels somewhat sloppily constructed and without the support of any interesting characters or relationships I feel like there's not much point in continuing. The best parts are the OP, Sidonia's design, and the cool portraits/sketches that are shown halfway through each episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Many people have had their homes destroyed by tsunamis, but there's still no point in "hating nature". I don't sympathize with the gauna, but I see no reason to hate them, either.<br><br><br>That's likely just them using the brain they've absorbed. That's why I said "inherent intelligence". They probably just use what works, supported by information gained from things they've absorbed.<br><br>Of course, when it comes to Benisuzume, for instance, we can begin to talk about intent, at least to some degree.<br><br>But who knows, they're still mostly a mystery, after all.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a shitty excuse, Nature is nature. Gauna is extraterrestrial life.</br>  <br>Brings up the question why they keep using BeniJiros when it's clear they've lost a lot of their impact.</br>  <br>at least there is a chance for S3 anon... we can only wait</br>  <br>Life is a part of nature. I wouldn't hate a lion for eating a person. Sure, it sucks, but it's not like the lion did it out of malevolent intent.<br><br><br>Why the gauna still use BeniJiro? Probably because she seems to be an efficient fighter. Sure, the scare-tactic doesn't work anymore (whether it was intentional or not), but she's still far more effective than the average gauna. I imagine it's a lot like natural selection. What works is used and what doesn't work is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're leaving out the little part where Ochiai is attacking Sidonia and/or its fleet with a GBE and him leaving that objective behind a long time ago and instead adopting the goal for himself alone.<br><br> She never told him everything, she is still wanting to be in control of the situation. She is feeding him bits of the whole truth. <br>Maybe, but that's pure speculation at this point as there isn't anything in those few pages to actually suggest it. I'd go as far as to say that lying at that point doesn't fit with her behavior afterwards or with Lala's perception of her in the latest chapter. She could have lied, of course, but the fact is that we don't know at this point.<br><br>I don't see why she would though. Nagate wasn't rebelling before, he's loyal to her and to Sidonia. What's the purpose of going through the whole thing and lying?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's new?</br>  <br> keep using <br>They don't really. There were 3 of them, right? 2 got killed off quickly while Benisuzume survived. Then Benisuzume got nearly killed, regenerated and then attacked again and got killed for good.<br><br>The Gauna only made Hoshijiro clones at one point, one of them was just hard to kill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if we get a third season i'd like to see the part when gaunas replicate one of the Honokas</br>  <br>Yeah that would definitely be interesting</br>  <br> Kunato fucks up the mission for the dumbest fucking reason and MC just drops it and lets him get away with it. <br>Their part in that mission was secondary. Kunato believed he could make Tanikaze look bad while not severely endangering the primary mission, which he was correct. Tanikaze drops it because he's an altruist, which he demonstrates time and time again.<br><br> Ochiai and info about his secret research is just hanging around Kunato's house for no reason for him to find. <br>The Kunato family is in charge of keeping Ochiai's sealed lab and his secondary brain. Being a rich family, they have an extensive library with historical information, including that of Ochiai and his research.<br><br> Kabi bullets are invented out of nowhere with no buildup. <br>When Tanikaze is allowed to view the dead chimera with Yure and the Captain, they explain the body produces an artificial Kabi. When they later introduce the man-made Kabi-core bullets, it's obvious to the viewer where they obtained the material.<br><br> A planet busting missile combined with the planet itself blowing up can't scratch a gauna, but a spear can. <br>Repeatedly explained that the Gauna core is impervious to all damage, except for the Kabi. There's not scientific reasoning to it, but it's established as being part of the physics of this universe.<br><br> MC is surrounded by females who are desperate for his attention and there are no male characters to be found anywhere. <br>There are a few more males, but this is a typical harem setup. It's not as bad as some other anime.<br><br> Izana being a hermaphrodite (at least so far) has no impact either on her character or on her romantic relationship with MC. <br>My wife thinks this is a legitimate complaint. Izana, though technically genderless at the beginning of the story, acts in most every way like a female. Her attraction to Nagate is immediate and apparent. Her transition to female later in the story is mostly to create tension between her and Nagate.<br><br> pic <br>What the fuck. Seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The demilitarization faction goes so far as to leave Sidonia guided by a retarded belief that we're given no evidence for.  <br>People believe stupid shit for no reason, or for very arbitrary reasons not backed up by evidence.<br><br>My suggestion: if you think the characters are bad, the action and mecha aren't impressive, and the storytelling is weird then you should stop watching it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's you again.<br><br>First off I'm not leaving out anything their first clash started way earlier than him attacking them with a GBE, read the bonus manga that came with the BD.<br><br>Also, do you really not understand the concept of not telling everything means? It's not a lie, you are just withholding information in your favor, which she is clearly doing.<br><br>It's more in favor that she never told him about why Saitou got fed up in the first place and just simply left that out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You try to spout the rule of nature and you do not understand them either.</br>  <br> you again. <br>What?<br><br> Also, do you really not understand the concept of not telling everything means? <br>Where exactly are you getting this from? Please, tell me the chapter and the page where I can see Kobayashi omit essential details. All we got were like 3 pages, it basically skipped over all the discussion that happened.<br><br>You can interpret it however you wish, but there's still 0 actual evidence either one way or the other in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean the guard copies, the Clones.</br>  <br> Rules of nature ?</br>  Yes hello does the girl have sex with the penis monster?<br><br>Is it shown in the anime?<br><br>If both answers are yes, I am picking this up.<br>Thank you very much /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they're useful for their brain or some shit, or the Gauna is simply regenerating everything that was part of its original placenta as a matter of course.</br>  <br>That game actually explained the rules of nature.</br>  <br>Could be, just a sort of large flight risk when they don't disintegrate with the cores. Smoogy's mom really boosted Sidonia's ability to effectively counter attack.</br>  <br>I'm simply pointing out that it's pointless to hate something that doesn't act with any intent, or at least any malevolent intent, which seems to be the case with the gauna until they actually begin using the brains of absorbed people. Until then, they simply followed the kabi or hyggs particles.<br><br><br><br> Maybe they're useful for their brain or some shit <br>I thought this was obvious. They get the ability of tactical thinking. The gauna itself probably don't use it with that intent, but it's effective, and thus it keeps getting used.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where exactly are you getting this from?  <br>From the whole part where Lala committed "treason" Saitou stole a clonebaby and cut down some guards<br><br>Even Lala have not told Nagate about this. No one has.</br></br></br></br>  <br> when they don't disintegrate with the cores <br>They do though, it's just that placenta doesn't foam if it's been physically cut from the true body.</br></br>  <br>It does act with intent if it's way of "communicating" with you is harming you Captain Hindsight.</br>  <br>Wasn't the BeniJiro that was invading Tanikaze's cockpit still attached to the core though?</br>  <br>That not enough? How about the part where she weaseled out of giving him information about Saitou.</br>  <br>Again, there is no point in the manga where we can actually see if Kobayashi told him about that or kept it hidden. We know they had a conversation where Kobayashi told him some shit about the past, but we don't know what she told him exactly. Maybe she lied, maybe she kept things hidden, maybe she told the truth, but we don't KNOW and those 3 pages don't really suggest anything one way or the other.<br><br><br>No, Izana separated it just before Nagate foamed Benisuzume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2/2<br><br>Oh look at that, she is lying to him.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, don't remember that bit.<br>Wonder if they'll invent a weapon that's essentially a Gauna peeler.</br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br><br>How exactly is shit from chapter 8 relevant to a discussion that happens in 60-something? Yeah no fucking shit she didn't tell him anything at the beginning of the manga.<br><br><br>They can peel placenta off just fine with Higgs cannons in general.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, because vaporized Placenta is so useful for weapons development and easy to collect.</br>  <br> moving goalposts this hard. <br>It matters a lot because it shows us how she has been manipulating him into working from him from the start. What the fuck did you think the "I need to treat this situation different" meant? Did you start reading after 63 thinking that was a good place to start?</br></br>  <br>You clearly have no idea what I'm talking about or you forgot how our discussion started, so I'm going to bow out now.</br>   [CBM] Knights of Sidonia 1-12 (Dual Audio) [BDRip 720p 8bit] <br><br>is this the one to get?</br></br>  <br>And you have no idea how much established character backgrounds does for situations. Are you really so naive that a 700 year old woman magically changes because of Nagate? No she is playing him like a fool as she has been since the start and does everything she can to avoid doing the same mistakes she made with Saitou.<br><br>She never told him about Saitou because Nagate trusts him more than her. She denies him information because she wants to be in control of the situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, to be fair, she doesn't exactly seem like the most mentally stable person.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out, normie. Rrreeeeerrre</br>  <br>Most of us ITT probably watched it as it was airing.</br>  <br>Absolute power corrupts, this is the same person that ordered the previous immortal council to be assassinated so she could keep staying in power.</br>  <br>Dem gitz was threatenin' the Waarg!<br>Seriously though, the council was just as if not more questionable in their actions.</br></br>  <br>They all are, the idea of an immortal council only works on short terms due to the need of preserving knowledge, problem is it should just be that and you could do that in other ways then to resort to immortality. Long terms it's leads to stagnation and only ends up in a power struggle in who should be in charge.<br><br>Great men knows when to step down.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, makes me wonder in the Capitan will ignite her own mutiny before the wild ride ends.</br>  <br>A virus doesn't act with intent. It just does was it does, which might result in the death of other organisms. There's no point in hating the virus for that, at least in my view. It's just acting out its biological programming.</br>  <br> implying you can't be long-lived while doing what's best in the very long-term </br>  <br>How is that gay? Are you in elementary school?</br>  <br> There's no point in hating the virus for that, at least in my view. <br><br>Then give up your life whenever you happened to come across hardship. <br>Rules of nature does not mean that you should bend over to the aggressor because it is stronger or in it's nature. It means anything goes, even defending yourself, grit your teeth. There is a reason why lions attack the weak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the Gauna are actually attempting to communicate then you can't compare them to a virus. You can't even apply the concept of communication to a virus.</br>  <br>It will probably be Tsumugi that does it just because.<br><br>Thing is, Kobayashi is currently a great wartime leader. She is making good calls actually leading Sidonia.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying virus-chan doesn't try to communicate by hugging </br></br>  <br>my URL</br>  Blame! needs an anime  <br>Well, Smoogy did go full RIP AND TEAR before.</br>  <br><br>It needs a dungeon crawler game.</br></br>  <br>Only against Gauna though</br>    <br>NaissanceE's environments looked very similar to Blame!</br>  <br>Just wait, they'll try some kind of combat drug on her to increase performance. Or something equally stupid.</br>  <br>That would be retarded as fuck, but then again nobody noticed Ochiai being up and about and making himself a chimera body to rek Sidonia with, so who fucking knows.</br>  <br>All it would take is Smoogy needing to fight injured or something.</br>  <br>Yeah but that this point with all the new Guardian models and ships and GBEs and shit Smoogy isn't even that big of a deal anymore, would still be plenty retarded. Not to say that it's impossible, Kobayashi like to roll the dice every once in a while and hope she comes out on top.</br>  <br>So, her eventually rolling a one is basically a certainty.</br>  <br>Getting Gauna to suck on Sidonia has to count as that happening</br>  <br>You mean the giant laser penis?<br>That was definitely a two, could have easily completely destroyed Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>I am not saying not to resist. I don't mind the gauna being killed. Nothing wrong with killing a lion in self-defense or trying to get rid of a virus entirely. But I'd say it's better to look objectively at what they are and considering different possibilities instead of dogmatically hating them.<br><br><br>Yeah, but they probably aren't trying to communicate, which is why I'm comparing them to a virus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean from the anime? No, I mean pic related.</br>  <br>the part when Gaunas replicate what earth would look like and parts of sidonia using Shou's memories and even replicating Shou itself , shows some interest of interest of understand humanity.<br>i don't think that gaunas copy everything without a reason, that would be pointless.</br></br>  <br>forgot the pic</br>  <br> that would be pointless <br>In the end, life is pointless. Cells self-replicate, but there is no inherent reason to this. It's just it's inherent programming. If that programming helps them survive, they'll keep it. But who knows, the gauna might have evolved some form of intelligence.</br></br>  <br> You mean the giant laser penis? <br>you anime only?</br></br>  <br>Whether it show interest in understanding humanity or not I don't know, but what's very interesting about that scene is that the Gauna have replicated something that they didn't physically consume. Replicate Guardians, replicate humans, sure. But they actually consumed those. This time though they replicated memories of a place that no longer exists, so it means at the very least that they were able to interpret human memories to a degree. That's pretty damn fascinating and not something we've seen Gauna do before IIRC.</br>  <br>Ah.<br><br>Yeah, the style of the space stuff reminded me of R-Type. The manga is much less pleasing to my eyeballs.</br></br></br>  How much do I need to pay Nihei for him to revive Hoshijiro?  <br>I'd wait and see what happens to all the BeniJiros before I started throwing money.</br>  <br>But you are giving them an excuse to continue trample over you, and that frankly is a sign of weakness. They are the aggressors and still are to this day, it's not a complicated philosophical thing. It's kill or literary cease to exist.<br><br>Also you are hind sighting a lot witch serves to muddle your perception of the whole ordeal.</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly was she trying to do? Does she get killed off later or turned into some kind of weapon?</br>  <br>I would use the Captain's entrance.</br>  <br> What exactly was she trying to do? <br>Strangle Nagate while connected to Benisuzume, after that it fell unconscious. BeniJiro is then put in a box at Toha (in the manga) and absolutely nothing else happens.</br></br>  <br>I've got no fucking clue, I think someone said strangle him? But that was a very disappointed look she gave when she got cut off. I'd guess she was trying to eat him.</br>  <br>Sexual assimilation.</br>  <br>Hot mecha on alien action.</br>  <br>My main complaints with the show are the comedy and harem elements. The comedy usually has bad timing and is often too over the top for a show with such a solemn atmosphere. The harem aspects are also awkward and clumsy in the way they are implemented. Instead of trying to create organic moments born from the setting and the unfolding events too many scenes use pre-established anime cliches without much effort put in to disguise them.</br>  <br>I am also pissed at how much this season fucked up Kunato. First season had a great arc for his character and I was eagerly anticipating this season to be his redemption arc and Tanikaze to finally gain a male friend (or at least a friendly rival). Instead his character is assassinated for a mind control plot that seems to stall out half way through.</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br>Yeah I think maybe she was trying to turn him into a guardian</br>  <br> Instead of trying to create organic moments born from the setting and the unfolding events too many scenes use pre-established anime cliches without much effort put in to disguise them. <br>This is the main problem I think as well. Nihei just rams the haremshit in there and it doesn't really fit most of the time. For instance I think  was very much in tone and if the romance were always done like that it wouldn't bother me.</br></br>  <br>the manga has some moments when harem shit and comedy could be natural and spontaneous but when those times comes, nothing happens</br>  <br>I could see that, it would be beneficial to the Gauna and the Hoshijiro part of BeniJiro I guess.</br>  <br>Beneficial? He could probably solo sidonia entire forces if he got transformed into a guardian.</br>  <br>Chance? The director fucking said it himself that they were going to be animating more Sidonia.</br>  <br>You realize this shit is absolutely impossible to make right?</br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Twitter post. Check the archives for pic, I don't have it on me.</br>  Ok, I've seen these threads going around for a while but all the screenshots I've seen of the show look like fucking shit. Is it actually worth it? I mean, should I watch this garbage looking piece of shit?  <br>The space shit is fucking top tier.<br>Closest we'll ever get to an R-Type animu.<br>The rest is meh, and I only say that because I've seen worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll try nevertheless. :^)</br>  <br>I'm not saying anything about resisting less. The only point I'm making is that it's better to be critical of dogma than to just say "gauna are evil".</br>  <br>KoS mod for Homeworld 2 when?</br>  <br>Huh. I take that back, there might be a way to make a Killy walking simulator. Would need some sort of randomness integrated into the game so buildings would be generated naturally. There is a game called No Man's Sky coming out soon that implements this function in its game. Maybe you should check it out.</br>  <br>That's actually a neat idea, shame the modding scene for it is so dead despite neat tools and samples provided by Gearbox.<br><br><br>I have procedural elements in it, yes. Going fully procedural is hard and usually ends up ugly, so I'm going for a mix where handcrafted pieces are assembled into infinite structures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a developer blog so I can follow your progress?</br>    <br> 08th MS team <br> LEAST romantic subplot </br></br>  <br>Damn.<br> You will never bring Sidonia to bear </br></br>  <br>bac9.tumblr.com<br><br>Mostly it's posts from 2014, I just got back to working on it recently (haven't touched that stuff for half a year, lots of crunch time at my main job left no free time). Right now the work is mostly about creating systems that will help me work on the world, figuring out the fastest workflows possible, writing shaders and editor tools and so on, not about gameplay or fancy visual polish, though, - so there are very few fancy gifs or presentable screenshots.<br><br>One with the towers is a quick test of the modular system I've described in the last post on that blog, not an environment I really labored on for more than few minutes or actually want to keep, for example. I'm capable of creating a very nice and detailed environments with traditional environment art techniques, but that would be wasted work. Specifically, I don't want to create one nice room per month, - I want to create a system that will generate thousands of nice rooms out of thousands of nice pieces which can still be authored within a month.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll need some of that immortality committee juice to manage both that and a Blame! game in my lifetime :^)</br>  <br>think for yourself</br>  Anyway, gotta go. Please ping me on tumblr if a Blame thread pops up again and someone will want to ask something - I try to keep up, but I usually see them two days late and archived.  <br>You're a motherfucking genius.</br>  <br>But that dogma didn't magically come from nothing. It came from Gauna killing and pursuing humans through space and literary destroying earth. The gauna established themselves as being evil by being the aggressors.<br><br>You can be critical all want to make yourself feel smart for "daring" to questioning the dogma, but you are a dumb-ass if you can't take the step forward and put 1+1 together to figure out gaunas are no good with the overwhelming evidence that supports it.<br><br>The road o hell is paved with good intentions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We clearly think very differently about this topic, so I'll just leave it here.</br>  <br>Let me put it as simple as possible so you can understand me more.<br><br>Sidonia is presumably the last bastion of humanity. Gauna want you and not only your family but even the whole human race dead for reasons you don't know.<br>Questioning if they happen to be evil at this point is the same as not doing anything at all which essentially is the same as not defending yourself.<br><br>When two forces fight all concepts of "everything is a shade of gray" vanishes. It's kill or be kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's the mindset you want to adopt, fine with me. I just find the dogmatic hatred of an organism that does not seem to have any inherent intelligence pointless. I can understand why most people would still hate them, and I can understand why Kobayashi makes use of it. <br><br>I originally really only wanted to say that I wouldn't call Hoshijiro naive for entertaining the idea that the gauna might be trying to communicate.</br></br></br>  <br>It's naive because she is seeing upfront how the gaunas form of communication is viciously murdering your comrades.<br><br> I just find the dogmatic hatred of an organism that does not seem to have any inherent intelligence pointless. <br>How many times do I have to say this, It's not the perceived intelligence that made Gauna evil. It was their actions against humanity that earned them right of being called evil.<br><br>Actions anon, the very thing that sets everything in motions. Not ideas or thoughts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The scale of the Gauna's destruction is beyond biblical. They have literally destroyed humanity's homeworld, cast them amongst the stars, and continue to relentlessly pursue them. After thousands of years, they pretty much are a sort of hellish religious entity to the people of Sidonia. Of course, we have seen that not everyone on Sidonia sees this way as there were quite a few chapters dedicated to the pacifists.</br>  <br>And they got BTFO</br>  <br>If you want to call it evil, fine. It's a matter of perspective and opinion, I suppose. Besides I'm too tired to keep this discussion going, so I'm going to excuse myself.</br>  When did we go from arguing who's best space tentacle to philosophy and shit?  <br>Fuck off newfag, this is how the threads where before chapter 63.</br>  <br>Arguments over subjective topics that won't go anywhere?

I asked him what was wrong and it turns out he was furious over the fact a villain was named after him, especially one that killed two main characters.

Is it a reference to this song? Don't have headphones so I can't listen to it atm</br></br>  They're missing the continuous spine drawing but these are JJL volumes, aren't they?  <br>I think Araki is self aware of the sameface-ness in part 7</br>  <br>holy fuck is this photoshopped or is this really Araki's art? I never noticed the sameface</br>  <br>Reminder this nearly got her raped, twice.</br>  <br>Still waiting for any on-panel sex in JoJo.</br>    <br> covers <br> Anything outside the actual manga pages after 『Heaven』  <br><br>Literally even in the manga in most panels I can't tell the characters faces apart except for mista with his eyes.

It's obvious Araki is going for an actual love thing this part and both of them are technically adults so they just gotta have sex at some point</br>   Z fighters with timestop <br>How fucked would  the world  be?</br>  <br>Sex? Is that a『Stand』power?<br><br><br>Thanks as always, Doc</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a reason Whis is considered to be way more powerful than Beerus.</br>   Tarot cards <br> Egyptian gods <br> Music <br><br>Araki could use some movies too, stands like 「P u l p F i c t i o n」or 「S p a c e O d y s s e y」</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not,Toriyama retconned that</br>  <br>I just remembered that Bowie has a song named like that, my mistake.</br>  <br>And he also said that SSGSS is weaker than SSG. At this point, I'll just go with Death of the Author and follow what the anime and movies say.</br>  <br>「MADE IN STAR KILLER KING PLATINUM CRIMSON WORLD HEAVEN QUEEN」</br>  <br> Made in Heaven <br>Where's the horse dick?</br></br>  <br>correction, are the clocks at his waist from MiH?</br>  Why didn't Jotaro become a manga artist to rival/ surpass  Rohan with his Star Platinum? We all saw how fast and great his Egyptian Fly looked and that was just from some shitty picture.  <br>So this stand is basically the master of time ?<br><br><br>Jotaro doesn't have creativity or the will to write comics. SP was just a printer from what he saw.  inb4 Rohan said comics are based on reality so if he just writes down what he saw as a stand user he'd be fine </br></br></br></br>  <br>he isnt passionate about it</br>  <br>You mean like in some of the alternate universes presented in Jorge Joestar?</br>  <br>Plus, when was the last time Jotaro drew anything on-panel?</br>  <br>Weird Al posted about JoJo on his instagram.</br>  <br> So this stand is basically the master of time ? <br>Doesn't have Mandom in there.</br></br>  so how would you kill pucci before he achieves MIH?  <br>It's either the master of time or uses all the abilities at the same time resulting in nothing, which makes it the shittiest Stand.</br>  <br>Probably, I mean there were those posters on that store window somewhere in japan with Gouda and Yamato dressed as Gappy and Yasuho</br>  <br> Who is Guldo </br>  <br> ditch Jolyne  <br>All Jotaro had to do to kill Pucci</br></br>  <br>If Josuke or maybe even Giorno were there i'm sure he would've let Jolyne get hit since he knew she could be healed up just fine</br>  <br>Giorno was in Florida too, fucking shit Jotaro chose the worst time to be an actual father</br>  <br>He might have been. That's as committal as Araki was about it and it was only on an info page added to the tanko.<br><br>So basically, Giorno is entirely irrelevant.</br></br></br>  <br>Guldo was NEVER creative with time stopping though. He just ran away with it and failed miserably at his one attempt at attacking with it. I mean fuck, he had telekinesis as well. He had those fights in the bag.<br><br>If he were smart he probably could have killed all three of them, but just because you have mind powers does not mean you have common sense.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be so cute if afterwards Josuke gets excited about sleeping on a bed with Yasuho.</br>  <br> Sex? Is that a『Stand』power? <br>The first thing Jotaro said to his wife in bed.</br></br>  <br>Honestly there is no real feasible defense against time stopping. Unless you have a consistent aura or ward that prevents contact (Like the Hamon to Dio) then no armor or muscle tensing will protect you from whatever hits you in an instant. <br><br>All Guldo would have to do is use what minimal power he had to blast a hole in their chests and bam, he wins. I mean if Krillin could do it to Vegeta when he was not prepared, there is no way they could have been prepared for the very moment Guldo decided to blast through them.<br><br>I was never a fan of the 'nerf an immensely OP power by making the user an idiot' maneuver. It just makes it feel like wasted potential.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would 4 balls slapping during sex look or sound like?<br><br>Also why is part 8 so damn kinky?<br><br>Rape, dominatrix, bondage, underage seduction, incest attraction, yasuho being fondled by a child every other chapter, holly being all footplay with the nurse, 4 balls, boners, tons of josuke nudity.<br><br>Is this araki's blue ball period?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What would 4 balls slapping during sex look or sound like? <br><br>Just watch gay porn.</br></br></br>  <br>Except for the fact that part 2 literally ended by showing Jotaro, whereas part 3 ended with no teasing of anything</br>  <br>That's because Part 1 and 2 were building up to 3. They HAD to show part 3 to assure fans that they were going to get through the mainstream series of Jojo, since they were getting a year break.<br><br>From here on out, it's uncertainty, because the first major overarching plot is done. Starting with part 4, we start getting into crazy shit about arrows and such. <br><br>We'll see if we are getting part four in the coming months. I am betting we'll get an announcement sometime this fall.</br></br></br></br></br>  Explain how Jotaro's hat/hair works.  <br>Hair grows from his scalp.<br>Hat rests on his head.</br></br>  <br>It's just a weird oddly shaped hat, it's easily recognizable when you see white clothes Jotaro</br>  <br>Joseph literally pulled a tommy guny and a dozen grenades out of nowhere in his first fight, get fucked animefag.</br>    <br> Joseph only asspulled once <br>Joseph please<br>Call me when you figure out how The Sun works</br></br></br>  <br>It just works.</br>  <br>How do explain this from literally the page before all the Tommy gun and grenade stuff happens?<br><br>He was hiding it in his oversized fucking jacket.

Should I have called it there or do I need to revisit?</br></br>  <br>Watch season 2 only.</br>  <br>It's funny because Touma has gotten sexually aroused by Index, unlike Mikoto.</br>  <br>Keep watching, the first arc of Railgun S is good.<br>The rest is crap.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Touma's annoying eighty percent of the time, so it's not surprising he has shit taste.</br>  <br>Well your objectively wrong.</br>  <br>I know the thread's for Railgun, but just to check - you mean of Railgun, right, not Index?</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br> talking about shit taste <br> ironically liking a character who is literally feces colored </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Back to  you go.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br> 3DPD <br>WRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Enjoy your ban.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>I-I'm c-confused</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Ahahahahaahahahaaha<br>now kill yourself</br></br>  <br>You mixed up your memes there, buddy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>Thanks for killing my boner</br>  <br>Reminder gunha got trashed like the bitch he is.</br>  <br>Even I could beat him up.</br>  <br>What were those ribbons sprouting from Gunha's back?</br>  <br>Yea, I watched 10 episodes of the first season of railgun.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127652168 <br>God, humans are fucking disgusting.</br>  <br>Those are his wings.</br>  <br>Before Index 3.</br>  <br>Wasn't it confirmed to be after Index 3 though?</br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Index 3 never.  ;_; </br>  My body is ready.  <br>To get BTFO?</br>  <br>Hopefully never, the manga is all I need.

Which is disappointing, because the manga is great. <br><br>All of the characters feel so hollow in the anime adaptation compared to the manga, they made the main cast into keion-tier husks.

Only LO is because she is a loli.</br></br>  <br>No it's because of that ahoge.</br>  <br> They aren't <br><br>But they are. The dull eyes do wonders to an otherwise plain and boring design.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does Touma always have that, "Durr, what the fuck is going on?" look on his face in screenshots when he's doing something with a girl other than punching her face in?</br>  <br>Railgun is more popular than index and makes more cash.</br>  <br>Only the first season was. Index II sold more than Railgun S.</br>    <br>bumping</br>  <br> The Railgun anime adaptation is one of the worst adaptations I have ever seen.  <br><br>You really haven't seen much anime have you? <br><br>Season 2 was great if you stopped watching after episode 16.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares, give me more of both, but I prefer Index even with all the annoying magic shenanigans because I want more WW3.</br>  <br><br>Soon.<br><br>JC Staff is a great studio that won't let us down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's impossible now since the mediafire folder is also gone. Time to give it up anon, Ingun is garbage anyway.</br>  <br>They should have never changed the eyes.</br>  <br> questionable characters doing questionable things <br>Oh well, at least my favourite character didn't feed another favourite character of mine their own leg this time.</br></br>  <br>Most of those shows are literally shit on there. I like the shows they are adapting currently though.</br>  <br>All trash except for Azumanga.</br>  <br>I don't know how they gonna animate all the retarded shit that happened in the last third of OT.</br>  <br>Changing viewpoints every 15 minutes? Golden hands? I'm sure it won't be too bad unelss they decide to slideshow everything.</br>  <br>That helps too.<br><br><br>Mikoto's design is simple and plain, but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth. But also important is her fierce and..sparky personality that creates a bold contrast. On top of that, she generally acts cuter and childish, which enhances the moe-ness she produces. Her clones look her like aside from eyes and panties, but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. LO is an exception mainly for being a loli, and is even more childish in various ways that burst with endearment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have to admit.<br><br>On some level, I am kind of wondering what kind of canon assassination Season 3 of Railgun will bring to the table.<br><br>I'm assuming a Railgun S3 would be like the first two, with the first half being a serviceable to stellar adaptation of a canon arc (I'm thinking Liberal Arts City), and the second cour will be Nagai's playground.<br><br>So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wake me up when they finally make an accel anime.  <br>Does Accel even appear in the Railgun manga other than the Sister's Arc?</br>    <br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>Time travel arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Added to my backlog.</br>  <br>He does get prodded by a Daihasei rep to advertise, but because said rep brought up the Sisters project, he ate a brick.</br>  <br>I think he's learned his lesson already</br>  <br>Index PSP did time meddling. Please no.</br>  <br> but it works well for her due to a harmonious combination of split hair, hair clips, shorts under skirt, and so forth <br>But she looks best when she's not in her base design.</br></br>  <br>Oh hello there, I was thinking that you'd never show up in an actual thread.</br>   There are people in AC who don't know Accel   <br>The first question, the oldest question in the universe, hidden in plain sight.</br>  I loved Railgun but I am 10 episodes into Index and I am just not feeling it. Half of each episode is Touma yelling into a really bright light while holding his hand up and they never even developed a relationship between him and Index before shit started exploding. Touma has no motivation beyond "lol me so awesome save cute girl!" And all the pseudo-church babbling and HAHAMAGIC nonsense just feels cheap and stupid.<br><br>Or is Index a masterpeace and I am a tasteless faggot?</br></br>  <br>It's shit. Only reason to watch either show is for biri biri but she can only do so much by herself.<br><br> I prefer railgul </br></br></br>  <br>No, it is not. Railgun is much better.</br>  <br> but they also are more serious, deadpan and less childish. And that makes them less cute. <br>And that makes their moments of childishness all that much more adorable.</br></br>  <br>Index II is a lot better, except for a few awful magic arcs.</br>  <br>Mikoto has worn many outfits. I would say her best is that tomboy outfit, the white dress she wore for the violin play, and the winter school uniform.</br>  <br>Where were you when they were all splattered dead on the floor?</br>  <br>Yeah you have to wait until NT4 to get the barest minimum of Touma development.<br><br>At all. And after  alternate universe genocide the subsequent effects are barely mentioned again.  </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br><br>MODS<br>O<br>D<br>S</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Touma is still a very boring MC.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's depressing. At least he isn't unbearable, though.</br>  <br>Now I really want a literal taste of Misaka too</br>  Shirou &gt;Touma.  <br>Accelerator confirmed Misaka doesn't taste that good.</br>  <br>Thinking "FUCK YOU /A/ YOU TOLD ME THIS WAS CUTE GIRLS SOLVING CRIMES."<br><br>You can call me an idiot for watching a series without knowing anything about it but I was not expecting that at all.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657012 <br>How many times do I have to report this guy?</br>  <br>Why did he chew on her fingers? Nigga is disgusting. Someone should snitch to LO.</br>  <br><br><br> eating Mikasa raw <br>The reason the Accelerator hated it was because the food was improperly prepared.</br></br></br></br>  Her vagina is pretty popular.  <br><br> So, any speculation as to what wacky plotline Nagai will introduce into S3? <br><br>First half of S2 was Misaka trying to save girls from cruel experiments from the dark side, leaving her friends behind and falling into depression to be saved by Touma. Then the second half was Nagai doing the same arc but with power of friendship saving the day<br><br><br>If the first half of S3 is Daihaseisai, where Mikoto and a level 5 team up to fight against a crazy scientist who's objective is experimenting with them, going crazy and finally being saved by Touma; then the second half will be Nagai having Mikoto team up with a super special snowflake level 4 girl who's almost a level 5 (pretty much every other level 5 doesn't give a shit, Gunha doesn't look like Nagai's style and Misaki again would be too much) to fight another crazy scientist who wants to experiment with them, Misaka going crazy but this time is saved by a friendship speech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what LO is actually for, making him sedated enough to not go out of the plan</br>  <br><br><br>Alright who is this fag?</br></br></br>  <br>That pose is way hot.</br>  <br> Implying accel even eats good meat </br>  <br><br>The problem is, you go to Index for the worldbuilding. Touma himself is literally a blank slate and after a while you realize the harem stuff is a mere footnote played for laughs.<br><br>Since the anime has to cut down on tons of exposition you end up missing a lot of stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, it turns harem? Fuck that.</br>  <br> look at me I think everything is lame fuck you mom </br>  Only good male character in Index.  <br>Indeed. And as a further bit of note...<br><br>Don't expect any concrete, lasting romantic development of any kind in this series. Some of /a/'s most virulent shitposters started out as people who made the mistake of latching on to a "ship" in Raildex.</br></br></br>  <br>You're kidding right? Hamazura is the original cuck.</br>  <br>Kakine 2 and Accel aren't too shabby.</br>  <br> Beetle good </br>  <br> to be saved by Touma <br>I hated that crap. I knew the whole time how it would end and it spoiled a good story. Misaka is doing great as the MC only to become a useless crybaby wreck waiting for the big strong man to swoop in and solve all her problems for her. <br><br>I was almost hoping they would make Railgun a parallel universe asspull so they could change that arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Index has a pretty shit adaptation that only gets decent once index's novels start getting good (around the end parts of season 2)</br>  <br>You must be a special kind of retard. You cite volume 5 as your source where he explicitly gets sexually aroused by Mikoto as she's helping him with his homework.</br>  <br> Shit taste </br>  <br> Telling other people they have shit taste when you're clearly the one with really bad taste </br>  <br> Implying </br>  <br> Index has a pretty shit adaptation <br>Nice meme.</br></br>  <br>You missed the entire point of that arc. I bet you're also mad about Touma having to save her in Daihasei as well. You sound just like the idiots who get butt flustered every time she helps/saves Touma in the main novels.</br>    <br>Remove your faggot shipper goggles. He just got nervous because Mikoto was getting close. Nothing sexually explicit unlike getting turned on by Index's legs and natural aroma.</br>  <br>When Accel spammer  returns to us.</br>  <br>Telling the truth here.</br>  I prefer Index.<br>Magic &gt; Science<br>fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Will the new season cover this chapter?</br>  <br>No, since there will never ever be another season.</br>  Reminder that Touma was unable to punch biribiri. Thus she must be the Chosen One.  <br>It must have been fun seeing your favourite character spammed everywhere to everyone else's butthurt.</br>  <br>You don't know that.</br>  <br>But that's right. Citing an old post listing all the fuck ups of the second season.<br><br> Vol 7 - Sheol Fear, downplaying the strength of the nuns, removing the special way Agnese talks, downplaying Touma's entrance into the church. The only thing that didn't have any problems there was the last episode. <br><br> Vol 8 - removing the talk between Touma and Kuroko, removing Mikoto's ladde, removing LO revealing to Accelerator that she regained her memories, removing the scene were Mikoto knocks out Awaki's companions, the berserk Awaki scene didn't have disfigured appliances, making Awaki crash into a wall instead of a metal net fence, removing the scene where Accelerator yells at her while falling to the darkness of the ground (they made him say his speech while he was walking away), etc. <br><br> Vol 9-10 - Removing Himegami's monologue while she was down, shortening both games, QUALITY everywhere, more QUALITY, QUALITY fights, downplaying Touma's injuries and the way he figured out Oriana's attack patterns, downplaying Laura and Aleister's tense interactions, spell auras that make Touma look like an idiot, etc. The only thing they got right here is the Lidvia scene at the end. Oriana fight would have been good if they didn't have such QUALITY flashbacks. <br><br> Vol 11 - The entire 3rd ep. Rushed as fuck, and once again Touma's injuries were removed. They also didn't even hint at the long history between Venice and the RCC, and the nature of the guardian fleet and why it can't be dispelled by IB was not explained or even hinted at. Vento's scene with Matthai Reece was also shortened. <br><br> Vol 12 - My only complaint was that they skipped the scene between Touma, Tsuchimikado, Aogami and LO. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chosen for what?<br>His dick?</br></br>  <br>I do, I know everything.</br>  <br>Touma is the fucking MC of the universe though, and it makes perfect sense that he has to save her. Besides, Gunha and Touma vs Mikoto was great.</br>  <br> Vol 13 - First ep was rushed as fuck. Vento's attacks were also nerfed as fuck, the building she and Touma were fighting in had almost no people and it wasn't even close to collapsing. The Hound Dog's first encounter with Vento were also changed, making it hard to realize what was making everyone unconscious and removed one of Kihara's character traits. The Hound Dog massacre was not suspenseful enough, and it didn't highlight the fact that Accelerator was not in esper mode that whole time. They also skipped the conversation with the driver (removing characterization for the Hound Dogs) and shortened the conversation with Doc Frog, downplaying his experience, skills and importance. Second episode, Index's scene with the SISTERS was skipped, and also the way Index found out it was Kazakiri. Building toss was a joke, and the the wings didn't look like wings where you can see a clear division at the middle. Ahegao could have been better, and they skipped the hints that tell how Kazakiri was still fighting back against the control of the virus. 3rd ep, Vento's entire character motivation and the reason why she's using Divine Punishment in the first place was skipped, Touma didn't punch her nose, they didn't explain what the scales did, they fucked up the positioning in Kihara's office, they removed all the explanations that connect what the virus in LO is doing to Kazakiri to the Golden Dawn's method of creating an angel, and they didn't make the phone call scene as awesome as this. And then for the epilogue, they complete skipped Aleister's past, his plans regarding Accelerator, LO and Kazakiri, and Doc Frog being the co-founder of AC. The first scene there could also have been put in the place of the previous episode's ED. Then, they completely removed the open declaration of hostilities between the RCC and AC. I'm sure there's more that I didn't mention. </br>  Electric twin dragon biribiri attack fuking when?  <br>Beyond that: She punched him when he wasn't living his life correctly.</br>  <br>When you kill yourself</br>  <br><br>I want to adopt a clone Misaka<br><br>They're adorable, pic related.<br><br><br>because Touma is a shit character 90% of the time. Actually the only times he's tolerable is in Railgun.<br><br><br>index is just shit, don't worry about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't just save her, he single-handedly ended a 7(?) episode arc in a few minutes and make everything Misaka did and went through completely pointless. He solve in a few hours something Misaka spent days agonizing over. It cheapened everything.</br>  <br>I wonder why Accel didn't just partly nerf the effect that gravity had him, fly slightly to the right, borrow a building and introduce Kihara's face to a flaming building.</br>  <br> make everything Misaka did and went through completely pointless <br>But it was pointless. Mikoto is useless as fuck.<br><br>No. She can't go against AC. She can't win against AC. She can't try to shoulder everything on her own.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The death of accel-spammer marked the end of times when we had based mods.</br>  <br> he single-handedly ended a 7(?) episode arc in a few minutes <br><br>the entire point of that arc was for biribiri to stop being such a fucking mary sue and to start relying on others. That 'few minutes' was the climax of that character development. He basically forced her to ask for his help. The plot of accelerator murdering the clones is just window dressing for the real point of railgun: misaka doing cute shit and generally being adorable. That plotline is continued in the next arc of railgun S, and that also ends in like 5 minutes with misaka and her hideously overpowered friends shutting down the science faggots.</br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto was fucking useless in the sisters arc though, without Touma she was just going to die. Accelerator could beat her in his sleep, literally.</br>  <br>You actually watch Nagaispace bullshit? Her friends are useless as well other than Kuroko, and even she is far out of her own league most of the time.</br>  <br> hideously overpowered friends <br>Baseball bats are so OP.</br></br>  Othinus a shit. <br>Accel a best.</br>  <br>But she didn't even ask for his help, he basically said "You sit here while I go save everyone."</br>  <br>Othinus a best.<br>Frenda a shit.</br></br>  <br>She was the reason the team managed to stop mecha-bitch.<br><br>They'd all be dead if not for her.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what he is up to now.</br>  <br>Science side is hideously underpowered with the exception of Accel and Rensa. Dunno why the author favourites the magic side so much unless it's for the Deus Ex Machina that quite literally appears from thin air.</br>  <br>Sasuga Nagai's waifu.</br>  <br>Heard he got a degree in something and got a real job.</br>  <br>Sucks dude.</br>  <br>Having money is nice.</br>  <br>Yeah I thought it was OK.<br><br><br>Well I didn't mean all of her friends, Uiharu's power is RETARDED. I mean, keeping things warm? What the fuck? Couldn't it have at least been to grow flowers out of her forehead? that would have made sense. And saten is also relatively useless in a fight except in deus ex machina situations.<br><br>But I was referring to snake girl and kuroko, who are each OP as fuck. <br><br>Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. no vectors involved. it just shows up and he's fucking dead. "Oh shit I teleported a window pane INTO YOUR FUCKING NECK". Also her army of clones is pretty OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JC Staff already said Raildun S3 won't happen until after Index III.</br>  <br>Sure, but think of the time he could be using to shitpost instead of working.</br>  <br>But only if you can obtain it with PLEASURING OLD MEN</br>  <br> Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. no vectors involved. it just shows up and he's fucking dead. <br> no vectors involved <br><br>I had exactly the same thought after watching it. But could she be convinced to kill someone that easily?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone doesn't understand Touma character too well.<br><br>Also, Misaka is shit in this regard, she shouldn't be saving herself in those positions as well. She is incapable of doing so, she doesn't have the power or connections to do so</br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko could kill accelerator no problem by teleporting anything into him. <br>No, she can't.<br><br> Her teleportation isn't instantaneous movement. It's hyperdimensional travel, which does have vectors. If teleportation were instantaneous and vectorless, Awaki and Kill Point wouldn't have gotten their asses kicked.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko, Onee-sama will wash your back if you kill the mean man for her <br><br>it's not like she's easily manipulated or anything.... she just wants  senpai to notice her </br></br></br>  Someone should really just nuke AC.  <br>It doesn't work that way....</br>  <br>He can shitpost at work, just not as a mod.</br>  For a long running series with a bunch of ability users, there aren't that many good fights.  <br> hyperdimensional travel, which does have vectors <br><br>sure but if accelerator were able to interact with hyperdimensional vectors, he would be teleporting shit all over the place. He doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Accel can manipulate vectors, but he can't do shit like tping everywhere. His powers aren't capable of that</br>  <br> which does have vectors <br>Not within this universe which is where Accelerator lives and where his power has control. He shouldn't be able to manipulate teleported objects unless his power includes extra dimensional reach.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean he wouldn't be able to do it if he actually tried to.<br>Accelerator has pretty much infinite potential.</br></br>  <br>Manipulating vectors implies that he can manipulate movements - disassemble/reassemble atoms into components because electrons/neutrons/protons all have specific movements.</br>  <br> Not within this universe <br>In the indexverse, everything has vectors. The cunt could probably time travel if he got exposed to the 'vectors' for time</br></br>  <br>The author outright stated that Accelerator could reflect teleported attacks, or at least the 12th-dimensional movement that comprises Academy City esper teleportation. True vectorless teleportation is the domain of magic side powerhouses like Fiamma.</br>  <br>Almost everything in our universe has vectors too and in any case even cheaty shit like magic would have the person at least on some level producing bioelectric signals deciding where they are going to end up.</br>  <br>Within that extra dimension it does, but as far as our existence is concerned the objects don't travel anywhere, they simply arrive.<br><br>At least it should work that way, muh OPness demands Accelerator be unstoppable after all.</br></br></br>  <br>But when you think about it, it's kinda silly that the objects don't 'travel anywhere' and merely 'arrive' because the information for the object composition and memories or any other biological blueprint must have come from somewhere. <br><br>It's silly to make a character so OP in such a way that the use of the character's powers could exceed the bounds of the writer's imagination. <br><br>Index would be better as all science or all magic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being a literal fucking retard <br>Read the LN's.</br></br>   these espers trying to fight motherfucking Accelerator   <br>Accel reflection works as a whitelist not a blacklist, he doesn't have to know how things works to reflect them.<br>He explicitly said he can reflect things moving through the 11th dimension, which is how teleportation works, while thinking about Musujime Awaki.</br></br>  <br>Which is retarded because his reflection shield exists in the same dimensions that he does so unless he is a 11th-dimensional being it should never interact with anything traveling in the 11th dimension (which is the basic principle that allows esper teleportation to work in the first place)."<br><br>But I agree that I can't refute shitty writing, the writer has final say and I am wrong.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Artist starting to put some effort <br> Edgy kids shitting their pants as they get blown the fuck out by the edgemaster <br><br>This manga finally got fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's not a 11th dimensional being, but apparently his power works on more than just the physical dimension, during his first fight with Kakine he propagated his vectors through the ream of God or something like that to hit him for example.<br>But I agree, Accel power is pretty bullshit.</br></br>  <br> try to be edgy as shit <br> the edgiest fucker in raildex pops his head in just to scare them straight <br>nice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The absolute undisputed king of edge.</br></br>  <br>The undisputed king of Edgy Large Ham.</br>  <br>S2. Watch for Sisters Arc. Be happy. Do whatever you want from there. The rest of the series is pretty meh if you don't like it already.</br>  <br>I don't know, when you kill over a hundred clones I think you're just a serial killer. Edgy is more when you can't back it up, or you put on a trenchcoat and not the same shirt pugsly from the adams family wear.</br>  <br>Read the manga, the anime is a disgrace in comparison.</br>  <br>Well Accel is quite literally Shadow the  h Edgehog who hasn't lost Maria.</br>  <br>I want to violate Saten.</br>  <br> Asphyxiation is my fetish. </br>  <br>proof that touma could kill biribiri</br>  <br>That's only because MIkoto allowed him to.<br><br>I wonder if it's her fetish.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I forgot, reminder that this scene was replaced by Nagai with a Saten scene in the anime.</br>  <br>You have no idea how dimensions work. You don't "travel in the 11th dimension". You travel in 11-dimensional space.<br><br>You have no idea how teleporters work. Teleporters aren't "11-dimensional beings". They are just 3D beings capable of warping space to allow for movement in higher dimensions (through 11-dimensional space).<br><br>There's no shitty writing. There's just you being an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They already tried and failed.</br>  <br>You don't really understand how higher-dimensional movement works. Go look up flatland.</br>  <br>everything JC staff touches turns to shit, Just like DEEN</br>  <br>But DEEN has done some good stuff.</br>  <br>One good episode of 23 totally shitty journey, it's not worth it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657070 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127657835 <br>Kill yourself, pathetic cunt.</br></br>  <br>That was just one example, DEEN did Samurai X:Trust and Betrayal.</br>  <br>anon. you only like it cause its more lewd than the others</br>  <br>Franchises like Samurai X and Fate can handle on their own since they already had their established fan base before they where adapted by Deen, doesn't matter how much Deen fucked them up, same goes for Index and JC really fucked up the second season and with the railgun fillers.</br>  <br>DEEN didn't fuck up Samurai X though, it was a masterpiece.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-<wbr>ballistic_missile</wbr></br>  <br>This anon is correct. I was  shocked  at how much better the manga was compared to the anime, outside of the Sisters arc. Before I read that I didn't think that a consistently great Raildex product was even possible.<br><br> No I have not read the LNs. I'm sorry, I'll get to it. </br></br></br>  <br> Samurai X:Trust and Betrayal. <br>they fucked up the series though, but even the mangaka fucked up the manga so it kinda deserved it.<br><br>What can I say, 90's Deen was ok, it's 2000 deen what shat everything they adapted<br> Rave Master <br> Inital D <br> Get Backers <br> Higurashi quality fest <br> Vampire Knight <br> Fate series and Movie <br> Umineko adaptation <br><br><br>The only things they "touched" was because it wasn't produced or completely animated by them, like Cowboy bebop movie or Toradora.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should warn you that the first half a dozen LNs have wonky translations. <br><br>Don't know how good the Yen Press releases are.</br></br></br>  <br>Saten needs to eventually join Anti-Skill and at least get a gun or something.</br>  <br>Meh, Nasufags got a based ufotable adaptation because DEEN did such a terrible job. <br><br>We're stuck with JC Staff, for better or worse, if Index III ever gets made.</br></br></br>  ARRRGGGHHH KANZAKI HELP ME, NOTHING IS HAPPENING  <br> To aru franchise needs to have a more whiny fan base then.  They're doing it right since they're getting a lot of spin off too, it's just a matter of time IMO. I think Kamachi.exe is just waiting for the rights on JC staff expire so they can give it to another studio, much like what Nasu did with Fate after UBW movie.</br>  <br>Rights expiration? When is that going to happen?<br><br>Nasu has his own company so he can do shit like that. kamachi.exe has to listen to Miki and his overlords at ASCII.</br></br></br>  <br>i thought accelerator had a boner from the thumbnail</br>  <br>When are you even going to get relevant again?</br>  Jesus Christ the manga is so uninteresting these days. I have reached a point where I just want a S3, I don't care if JC Staff makes it, I'll still watch it.  What's up with the mediafire folder?

From my rough trace, it looks like Hibiki's roight leg transfroms into a 3rd scarf.  <br>So delayed you probably can't call it a simulcast, since they say it's going to happen "after summer".</br>  <br>But summer ends on september 21st.</br>  <br><br>She's toast</br></br>  <br>Has to be her leg right?</br>  So close  <br>You guys should calm down 20+ hours with constant symphogear threads one after another is just asking for trouble.</br>  <br>It was the same past season, I dont see the problem</br>  <br>*30</br>  <br>I don't want her to die. She's just starting to have fun in her life again.<br> ;_; </br></br>  Who do you want to see die the most in episode 7? I hope it's Chris again.  <br>But I don't want to see anyone die.  Genjuro </br>  <br>It was also terrible last season when people kept pushing threads for no real reason, just because they were waiting on subs. No one is immune to eternally propagated threads going to shit when there's no new material.</br>  <br>It will be Miyu, then Biki will fuse with and become gungnir.</br>  <br>At least we keep it one thread unlike Fatefags.</br>  <br>Ogawa</br>  <br>Dont go killing off characters that arent in this series</br>  <br> Miyu <br>The plot thickens.</br></br>  <br>Not as bad as Yaharifags who switch threads immediately after hitting the bump limit.</br>  <br><br><br>Dont even respond to it. Its just shit posting at this point. He went on and on about it. He just doesnt want us to talk about anime airing this season.</br></br></br>  <br>In all seriousness daddy issues kind of seem like they're going to be a thing this season and Genjuro is everyone's dad so</br>  <br>The only threads that weren't just mindless posting were the stream one and the single one <br>At this point we are just Nanafags vs Aoifags comiie vs zoid and calling names each other</br></br>  <br>Another little girl daughtered.<br>How can one man be so based?</br></br>  <br>Almost like some kind of miracle</br>  <br><br>Hibiki will be forced into berserk mode by Carol and end up killing Genjuro and becoming an antagonist for the second half of the show until the finale.</br></br>  <br>That would be impossibly sad.</br>  <br>But imagine how hype the finale would be.</br>  <br>So which side would Miku be on?</br>  <br>Miku will kill anyone to protect her waifu</br>  <br><br>is wanting to talk about something you like so unreasonable? <br>We keep to one thread and stay on-topic. Who is it bothering?</br></br></br>  <br>Even  Hibiki? </br>  Is this show worth watching? Can anyone give me the lowdown?  <br>Did you not watch S2?<br><br><br>No. Waste of time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbians with Super Robot Wars tier of hotblood.</br>  <br>It's like Madoka with singing.</br>  <br>Magical girls use science armor and the power of song to fight evil aliens. It's dumb and fun and exciting. Are you down with exciting dumb fun? It's that. <br><br>Start with the first season obviously, this is the third.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like Love Live with Gundams.</br>  <br>He's upset cause he has one less thread he can shitpost in<br><br><br>It isn't, it's just SAO with singing</br></br></br></br>  I just want to let you guys know that I want to  see Miku  lick Biki's belly.<br> some Maria/Tsubasa mutual navel worship's fine, too. </br>  <br><br>May contain fisting.</br></br>  <br>It's like if you had a Madoka who watched all of G Gundam 11 times and learned everything from it, then put her in a situation where she has to sing and punch the shit out of everything while being mentored by a MAN who just so happens to be an expert in being a MAN</br>  <br>Except the songs are actually good.</br>  <br>It's macross with punching</br>  <br>I wouldn't speculate someone dying just because that producer guy said they made higher ups angry. I mean, look at Punchline, Amamiya Sora said episode 6 was her favorite or something and everyone took it as HUEG PLOT TWEEEST and everyone who hyped themselves got disappointed for no fucking reason.</br>  <br>Nanafags and Aoifags are friends with each other, there are faggots who go too far but they don't really fight against each other.</br>  what's this business about someone dying in episode 7?  <br>Hibiki is going to commit suicide in episode 7</br>  <br>Kaneko said he went over the line in episode 7.<br>Nana said she did a lot of screaming in episode 7.<br>And we all know that 7 is a very important number for Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br>Rumors, we do know Episode 7 made some higher ups angry.</br>  <br>Theres a ninja secretary pop idol manager who can run on water.<br><br>Theres a guy with superhuman strength whos almost as strong as the main characters if not stronger,hes not a mutant or anything he just like kongfu movies.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair the last time he hyped up an episode it was the one where Hibiki got her arm ripped off.</br>  <br>PLEASE NO<br><br>NOT AGAIN</br></br></br>  <br> Christian religions consider 7 to be a Holy Number because in Genesis the first book of the Bible it says that God rested on the 7th day and man was created on the 6th day, therefore 777 is thought to be the antithesis of 666. <br> The numbers 3 and 7 are considered both "perfect numbers" under Hebrew tradition. </br></br>  <br>Loli spreading anus confirmed?</br>  So commie or H&amp;D?<br><br>I have no idea now</br></br>  <br>Commie</br>  <br>That on top of all the talk about how suffering this season is going to be and how depressed it made Nana.</br>  <br>raw</br>  <br>H&amp;D.

Blow a hole in it! </br></br></br>  <br>Looking at Glorious Break's lyrics, it sounded like it described getting power out of desperation and embracing the consequences that come along with it. A long shot interpretation, though.<br><br>Kaneko did say that the ending credits song was going to give us an understanding for the tone of GX.</br></br></br>  <br> my fucking face when they just fucking blow like 1/3 of a mountain away </br>  <br> Kanade got replaced by Maria </br>  <br><br>Needs to be updated, S2 had some good eps (1-2, 10) and some really shitty ones (Maria being useless).</br></br>  <br>That chart is so old it's not even updated for when S2 was shit from episode 7-9 and then the ensuing QUALITY.</br>  I went into this show expecting non-lethal combat and battles ending in people being KOed, imagine my surprise to get this .  <br>Proper symphogear rhythm game for vita when</br>  <br>It was for the best. Maria is much cuter than, her voice is better, and cat hair &gt; bed hair</br>  <br>Plausible. If the dolls are so strong that their current gears aren't enough they might be forced into using Dainsleif even though it's probably cursed.</br>  <br>In a previous thread (that might have been on /m/ I forget) the chart went 3D.</br>  <br><br><br>Where have you people been?</br></br></br>  <br>You need to die.

Hibiki had to go the rest of the way.</br>  <br><br>Chris smashed the middle section of the mountain into debris, and then Hibiki punched those rocks out of the way.</br></br>  People seem surprisingly calm about the fact the girls have been publicly revealed as basically superheros. I'd expect a crowd of people following Hibiki asking her for autographs and if they can see her punch something.  <br>Well yeah, but then you had the rest of the episode not being as fucking amazing. <br><br>I mean, S2 ep1 started amazing, and when you thought it would slow down for a bit it only continued, S3 ep1 instead actually slowed down, and while I do enjoy yuribait handholding, it's not exactly as good as punching and exploding shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Need to re watch the episode at some point I guess.</br></br>  <br>I'm wondering how they swept Hibiki's ass under the rug with the Frontier incident. She yelled her name to the world so that's not something she can just hide.</br>  <br>You think Miku would let that shit fly?<br><br><br>You can't have only action for 23 minutes x 12 episodes, you need time for characterization and set up for following scenes.<br><br>Episode 1 was perfect in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was under the impression that's still classified to normal people though. Just that they now work under the name S.O.N.G.</br>  <br>I'm actually hoping it slows down even more in s2 because I want to know more about what's going on. Of course there will still be action since Chris has to have her fight and Hibiki has to deal with Carol trying to danmaku her.</br>  <br>Maria and Hibiki were both on the live worldwide broadcast that Maria used to ask for more phonic gain.  Then Hibiki stripped them both butt naked. <br><br>I don't think people will forget that anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>At the end of s2 I think Maria was still broadcasting when Hibiki took Gungnir from her.</br>  <br><br>Just saying, the hype factor in S2 and S3 ep1 is different, and I think S2 ep1 was better. That's all.<br><br>I enjoyed the ep a lot and I'm glad Symphogay is back.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Not to mention stopping the shuttle crash was pretty high profile and a fair deal of people saw them do it. And they're running around rescuing people from burning buildings without any attempt at being covert.</br></br></br>  <br>Inb4 Maria was the one broadcasting so whatever Hibiki, or Ver said weren't recorded.</br>  <br>Well the shuttle was the incident that made them go public. Before that it was still secret.</br>  <br>It is a private school, and it's been a few months since the shuttle incident. And it's not like the school didn't previously have a super popular idol attending it. There's probably plenty of security to keep randoms out at least.</br>  <br> 2 pilots <br> SONG, Maria's group <br> a bunch of people in a middle of nowhere <br>I don't think they have internet in that village so they don't need to worry much about hiding identities.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Carol makes Hibiki go berserk <br> Genjuro is forced to try and stop her because reasons and fails <br> Hibiki barely manages to gain control and holds Genjuro in her arms as he dies <br> LOOK, THE EAST IS BURNING RED! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that scene gave me a WHY boner</br></br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>I'm a sufferingfag but that's almost too much even for me. Like, Hibiki's real dad was an abusive drunk who abandoned her, then she gets a really supportive surrogate dad who genuinely cares about her, but she loses control (largely due to her aforementioned troubled past) and kills him? That's really fucking dark.</br>  <br>Satan wills it.</br>  <br> Episode 7 </br>  <br>  Genjuro gets decapitated, his head rolls to a stop on the ground. <br>  "Don't just stand there! Pick up my body and take me to the hospital!" <br>  Cut to Genjuro in the hospital with his head bandaged back on </br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. I'm not sure I want this either.</br>  <br>Satelight marketer, please go.</br>  <br>It gets worse when you factor Tsubasa into the equation.</br>  <br> Why does it curve and also go straight? </br>  <br> needing to go to the hospital <br><br> "Hibiki-kun! Toss me to my body!" <br> Genjuro's headless body picks his head up and just throws it back on <br> cracks his neck and assumes a fighting stance </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mountain </br>  <br>I got the impression the scattershot missiles penetrated the mountain and reduced it to some kind of rubble (apparently in a a very linear fashion) and then Hibiki smashed through the boulders and rocks to clear the path. That's my headcanon at least.</br>  <br>She's ending up as the audience's waifu stand-in, and I don't like it.</br>  <br>This is the original version I made,  but somebody added the straight line and everyone seemed to like it and I still don't get it. I want to be included. </br>  <br>I agree, people will argue that Symphogear has always had dark and edgy parts but they've all either been in the characters backstories or been immediately fixed. Nothing permanently edgy has really happened.</br>  <br>The action looked better in this episode because it wasn't all dark and muddled by that filter. I like the characters in Symphogear too, so I appreciated the setup more here too.

Probably moreso than Tsubasa got over Kanade.</br>  <br>Until she has to fight zombie Serena.</br>  <br>She tries and she's still shit. She had like one real fight so far, and that was at the beginning of G where she still got her ass handed to her by Tsubasa and needed help from Dess and Jii</br>    <br>It was never fair, Tsubasa is super overpowered and Maria had to pump herself full of linker to use a gear at all.</br>  <br>This is the face she makes when I suck her off is what I imagine.</br>  <br>Except she didn't even use her armed gear in that fight and almost held her own without it. And it's not like right after that she didn't straight up admit they have no real chance against the others.</br>  <br> it took nana a week to write up EXTERMINATE <br> 7 days </br></br>  THE MIRACLE THAT LETS YOU USE SYMPHOGEAR, YEAH YOU BETTER NOT FORGET HIBIKI.  Maria a pretty  <br>She writes?</br>   400 years old <br><br>How have they not encountered her before? Was she in some kind of hibernation where she didn't age or maybe time traveled to the future?</br></br>  <br>She wrote all three OPs</br>  <br>Except the one she has now was given to her by Maria. Maria is the miracle.</br>  <br>What? Where are you getting that from?</br>  <br>Huh that must be why they were awful.</br>  <br> Miku erased the last bit of Kanade that existed in the world </br>  <br>I honestly thought Hibiki saying that was incredibly insensitive in front of Tsubasa.</br>  <br>Kanade was taking over hibiki's body. We couldn't have that.</br>  Why's this thread still going so fast. Go to sleep, Symphonerds.  <br>Her father is wearing glasses from the late 1500's to early 1600's. Since she was also there that means she's about 400 years old.</br>    <br> Oh man, I sure having fun! I'm so glad your wife got horribly murdered infront of you trying to save me! </br>  <br>I just got up</br>  <br>I think Tsubasa has pretty well come to terms with Kanade's death by now.</br>  <br>Same. I got "up" too.</br>  <br><br>I don't understand all the Maria hate.<br>She just wanted to protect her lolis.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think wearing old glasses is enough to prove that was centuries ago. That burning could have taken place on another planet for all we know.</br>  <br>And they ended up nearly killing eachother while Maria got bitchslapped twice by the person she entrusted their lives to.</br>  <br>Ah. Maybe.<br><br>Well she's all about alchemy right? It wouldn't be surprising if she were immortal. People have also been suggesting that she makes new bodies for herself, and that Elfnein is a defective one, hence "Scrap Material #11".</br></br></br>  <br>it could simply be in some weird eastern European country.<br>Some of those still live in the middle ages.</br></br>  <br>No one hates her, people just likes to bully her.</br>  <br>Now that's a literal shit taste.</br>  <br>Why would I go sleep at 7:44?</br>    <br>I don't think Carol is an eastern European name.</br>  <br> Answer me, Hibiki!

They have much lower quality.</br></br>  <br><br>I was honestly thinking of Chris &amp; Shirabe/Kirika pre-befriending</br></br>  <br>Because it's just concentrated hype. I'm using H&amp;D release so I can just keep watching in between scenes.</br>  <br>They didn't want revenge either.

It's my favourite mountain.</br>  <br>Now its going to be your third favorite mountain</br>  <br>Its shrinkage was not in vain.</br>  <br> You're so greedy wherever you go <br>That's way too literal for a non-japanese speaking audience to understand as subtitles. Kirika is finishing Shirabe's sentence (as raging homosexuals do), and the meaning behind what they're saying together is effectively what it has been translated as, despite it being quite different in a literal sense.<br><br>Commie can be insanely shitty sometimes, but they've done pretty well for this episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In the show they said it went to being 3rd highest though.</br></br>  <br>I'm really looking forward to next episode<br> Exterminate with opening animation <br> Rebirth Day <br> Tsubasa battle song <br> Chris fighting coins </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The show says a lot of things. I trust /a/utism.</br>  <br>In the show they also said that singing activates magical crystals that turn you into a magical girl.</br>  <br> I trust /a/utism. <br><br>I don't. It's just analyzing pixels in a drawing that someone drew who probably didn't use exact math to determine how much of the mountain he had to cut away to make it the 3rd largest.</br></br></br>  Oh sweet fuck that intro scene. Like I can handle a lot but goddamn that was too much for me. <br><br>I'll still enjoy it nonetheless but I felt as though a bit of me was dying as I watched.</br></br>  <br>It's /a/utism analyzing what was there to analyze. By no means is it going to be realistic, but it's still fun to think about/analyze.<br> Don't be a stick in the mud, it's Anime not Discovery channel. </br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the show just said third tallest because it was originally the second tallest, and they lowered it by one rank. /a/non wouldn't have been able to conclude that it's actually the fifth tallest now without looking at the heights of #1-5 beforehand, so I don't know what math you think he's skipping.</br>  <br>lighten up anon, its just Chinese cartoons</br>  <br>WILL SHE FINALLY GET TO FIRE IT THIS TIME</br>  <br>The only big problem with it is that it guesses how high the original peak would have been on the image.<br>Unless it was compared to a photo of K2 or something; it doesn't say.<br><br>It seems reasonable enough though. If it was any lower, there would be a weird shallow slope just under the peak.</br></br></br></br>  So which geah will handle themselves the best outside of their transformation? Maria has shown she can do some fancy fighting techniques, Tsubasa knows how to use a sword and Hibiki learned kung fu from the best.  Reminder, G Nico stream in an hour from now.<br> Need a VPN to open up the page, can DC after the page is loaded. <br><br> &gt;posted about it last night<br/>  &gt;Fell asleep just after posting </br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Sure it's fun, it's also rather pointless, like trying to determine Tsubasa's breast size using different screenshots of her chest.</br></br></br>  <br>When's wensday?</br>  <br>Hibki = Tsubasa &gt; Maria for outside gear.<br><br><br> If you don't like it just hide it, stop trying to make other people dislike it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I've bee doing this since Friday.<br>I can't think about nothing but Symphogeah, this is getting ridiculous.<br><br>Get out of my head Seiten Galaxy Cross.</br></br></br></br>  I genuinely can't tell if this season is shit, or if Symphogear is making it look shit in comparison.  <br>It will be like this for the next 12 weeks for me.</br>  <br>The sequels to stuff I like would make it already golden for me (specially Teekyuu), but I just care about Symphogear at the moment.</br>  <br>True, that's not too scientific, although probably easy to remedy.</br>  <br>I like this season. Leviathan s2 when?</br>  <br> Get out of my head Seiten Galaxy Cross. <br>You'll probably actually hate it if the lyrics have any bearing on episode 7.</br></br>  Who will be the first one to use Swan Song?  <br><br>Yeah all the sequels are nice, and the shorts are too. However there only seem to be a handful of new things that are worthwhile so far. But then again, some things haven't aired yet.<br><br>I can see myself watching only 15 or so, when I usually manage 25ish.<br><br><br>Hopefully Maria.<br>We haven't heard it yet, and it will make her useful maybe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria. It won't do anything and she dies in the process.</br>  <br>But that'd make it  useful </br>  <br> 2003+12 <br> not knowing Nana writes songs and shit <br>Nana wrote Innocent Starter, Eternal Blaze, Shin Ai, Bright Stream, Synchrogazer, Vitalization, Exterminate and many others.<br>Nana wrote and composed Pop Master.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I genuinely can't tell if this season is shit <br>This season's great, and it's only been made better by more Symphogyeah.</br></br>  <br>I'd say Tsubasa &gt; Hibiki &gt; Maria<br>Hibiki might've had Genjuuro training montages but Tsubasa has been a sword for most of her life, ontop of the training montages.</br></br>  <br>This. Tsubasa doesn't look more tired than Bikkie in the G training montage, and in fact her stability is better when it comes to balancing the cups.</br>  <br>I'm not even watching any continuations except Gatchaman, Ilya and Symphogear because well, I still have previous seasons in my backlog. New shows aren't complete trash like previous season too. Rokka no Yuusha is alerady AOTS with bunnygirl warrior princess.<br><br>Also Dandelion subs fucking when.</br></br></br>    <br>Tsubasa &gt; Miku &gt; Hibiki &gt; Shirabe &gt;= Chris &gt; Kirika &gt; Maria<br>Physically, Kirika and Maria would be above Chris but they're too dumb.</br></br>  <br> Rokka no Yuusha is alerady AOTS <br>I'm sorry, I can't.<br>Fantasy LN adaptation with a cocky little fuckface MC? I just can't.<br><br>Bunny girl is indeed thigh-tastic, so I'm going to ignore the show and enjoy the porn. That's what I did with Danmachi too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll save the day when she gets Airgetlam back, j-just you wait!</br>  <br> Rokka no Yuusha is alerady AOTS <br> AOTS <br> anything that isn't GX is AOTS <br>Anon please.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku second <br><br>What kind of battle training did she receive again?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Believe in autism.<br><br>This is the Anon's theoretical old anime K2 peak superimposed over a photograph of real K2. It fits almost perfectly, which is why it's difficult to see the distinction.<br><br>The lower peak you can see is the post-Hibiki peak, so you can ignore that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> TRACK TEAM <br>Hibiki wouldn't dare to hit her so she wins that one by default.</br></br>  <br>Well, Bikki learned that in High School while Tsubasa might've mastered that shit already while she was 7 or 8 years old.</br>  <br>GX is above AOTS tier.<br><br><br>I eat fantasy hero adventure like gummybears. And I love gummybears.</br></br></br></br>   super edgy loli villain with a dark past <br>it's the first episode and we have already a false note.</br>  Why does this show give me such a  ear boner?   <br> Miku&gt;Hibiki <br>I get that shshe's a fast runner but I doubt she can seriously fight.<br>Why is Shirabe even that high? She's frail as fuck. And Maria fighting gearless and getting a kick in that would've broken a human's neck already puts her above Kirika and Shirabe.<br>Chris is just flabby and unfit when not in gear. She might be good at shooting guns though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Serious response, because they use live recordings instead of edited/mastered inserts.<br><br>Hype response, because it's fucking Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I legitimately did not know that anon, holy shit. Thank you for enlightening this poor soul.</br></br>  <br>God tier sound directing and VA cast.<br>I never thought I can be sexually aroused to voices until I watched Symphogear.</br></br>  <br> Chris is just flabby and unfit <br>This is why I'm worried that we won't see any gun kata. It requires a high level of physical finesse.<br><br>Chris fights usually involve her standing there and blowing shit up, jumping out of the way, and then repeat.<br>I want to see some Mami vs Homura shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolute angel. My goddess.</br>  <br>Symphogears give them physical boosts so she should be fine. She fought Tsubasa in CQC in G already.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's one of the coolets parts about Symphogear, all the songs are used from live recordings, and are re done every time you hear them singing to fit the mood. It's more evident in scenes like the  SHUTTLE SUPLEX  and  THESE FISTS, THIS LIFE. <br><br><br> I never thought I can be sexually aroused to voices until I watched Symphogear. <br>I want to  throat fuck Aoi Yuuki. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea what else is even airing this season.</br>  I wish S1 gets a remake because of all those awful QUALITY animation.  <br>Imagine if Chris teaches Tsubasa how to use guns.</br>  <br>It's not about their true fighting ability but about what would happen if we put them into a not-really-serious tournament. Miku &gt; Hibiki by default, and Maria's too kind hearted to hit anyone.<br>In a pure serious fight without gear, weapons or cheap tricks then it would be:<br>Tsubasa &gt;= Hibiki &gt; Maria &gt; Miku &gt; Kirika &gt; Chris &gt; Shirabe</br></br></br>  <br>Waste of resources.

I don't remember half the flower names I learned for example.<br><br>It's fine if you just can't doAnki but don't try to half ass Anki and throw some dumb bullshit into it. Try something else.<br><br>Listening, reading, watching works when you already study the words as a reinforcement, you can't realistically reinforce words you don't know.

Sorry if that sounds like a vague question, but is there any reason why it might be okay to replace one kanji with another like this? A search shows 喻 isn't apart of any officially recognized list of kanji for Japanese use.  <br>Something about "pleasure" and "inner advent" I think</br>   open DJT expecting interesting discussions about Japanese <br> rimjob and icecream for half the thread <br> idols <br> people arguing about classes </br></br></br>  <br> implying that's not interesting </br>    <br>Damn I was about to ask the same question.

Maybe he's happy / surprised to see it again.</br>  <br>post a picture</br>  <br>I don't know why RTK does what it does, but I think 喩 is kind of the "unsimplified version" so it has some weird radicals, kind of like 辿る and others have the double dots on the 辶<br><br>Things like that were simplified in the Jouyou kanji, but left as is with most of the non-Jouyou.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Half the time, /a/ doesn't notify me when someone replies to my post these days.<br><br>It certainly seems like it's being used for emphasis, the guy is really happy.

You're free to disagree.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't the 上り here just a more sophisticated て form? So he went up to the roof and then said it.</br>  If there is one thing you guys really don't need, it's knowing the stroke order of such an obscure kanji. How many times will you handwrite that in your life? My bet is 0.  <br> I'm not saying the one you linked is wrong per se <br>The one I linked is wrong. I don't who drew it or what it was doing on jisho.</br></br>  <br>But I want to impress native speakers on national TV.</br>  <br>言う being in ている form made me a bit unsure. I know that ている can transfer over previous verbs in the sentence, but I'm don't really know how that works tbh.</br>  <br>The same radical appears in other kanji.<br><br>One of which is 拝啓, which is something you would definitely write since it's used as a salutation in written letters.</br></br></br>  <br>The stem form is different from the て form as it doesn't imply any order. It merely says that he went up to the roof, and that he called to the kids, the order is unknown and must be inferred from context.</br>    <br>Personally I don't think I'll ever write a written letter in my life either. I don't study stroke order at all. But that's just me I guess.</br>  <br>Could you refrain from posting pictures of myself please?</br>  <br>Thanks for the good explanation. I've seen the stem form many times in sentences but it's always been in order I think. <br><br>Can the order even be reverse? Like in that example, could it mean that he first told the kids to come down and then went up to the roof himself?</br></br></br>  <br>Korean and Japanese are ridiculously similar languages. Basically all nouns in Korean are rooted in hanzi/hanja/kanji and all you need to do is convert them into Japanese pronunciations.</br>  <br>Steve is struggling learning Korean because Korea doesn't have anime porn or 野球.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Steve wouldn't watch anime.</br>  <br>Shit, didn't notice "porn". I take that back.</br>  <br>I guess, but in that specific case it doesn't seem likely. But the asker neglected to post context so we can't really know.</br>  Ever wondered where the word "Japan" came from?<br><br>1. Go to Google Translate Chinese.<br>2. Type in 日本.<br>3. Click audio pronunciation.<br><br>Now you'll never say "Japan" again without feeling like a disgusting dog Chinese subhuman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That sounds like upen</br>  <br>http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/201<wbr>50706/k10010140631000.html<br><br>Have at it.<br>Also, am I mistaken in believing that verbs being in ている can affect how you should interpret preceeding verbs in てform/stem form? Like I'm thinking here basically.</br></br></br></wbr></br>  Anyone else think that it feels easier to practice with things that aren't fun?<br><br>I can spend hours reading/listening to those more intermediate and advanced Nihongonomori grammar lessons where the lessons are all in Japanese and there are no English subtitles, but it's hard for me to stop my mind from wandering when I try to read a VN or some manga.<br><br>As long as everything feels like a chore then I can stay focused because it feels like I'm studying, but as soon as that line between studying and fun begins to blur then my mind switches to free-time lazy mode as if I was taking a break and playing a video game for fun and not for studying. <br><br>I dread the day that I finish all of these lessons and I have to switch to fun things.

If you see a bunch of slurred colloquial speech in a manga then a google search is rarely helpful because there aren't dictionary entries for slurred words. It would be like reading Huckleberry Finn, seeing "I hain't got no money." and then spending 15 minutes going through a dictionary trying to figure out what the hell "hain't" means. It's not going to be in there. <br><br>Once I got used to reading and noticing the common patterns then manga wasn't as annoying for me because I could read the slurred speech and recognize what they were really saying.</br></br></br>  <br>That's just how you report the speech of others in a neutral way. Like "they were saying that..." in English.</br>  <br>Wait, so did the father set fire to the house, climb the roof and tell his children to jump out of the windows, and then once they'd fallen, (which they were later found as corpses) say "I've been bad"?</br>  <br>You're being generous with that Huckleberry Finn quote.<br><br> Well, den, dis is de way it look to me, Huck. Ef it wuz HIM dat 'uz bein' sot free, en one er de boys wuz to git shot, would he say, 'Go on en save me, nemmine 'bout a doctor f'r to save dis one?' Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer? Would he say dat? You BET he wouldn't! WELL, den, is JIM gywne to say it? No, sah—I doan' budge a step out'n dis place 'dout a DOCTOR, not if it's forty year! </br></br></br>  <br> (which they were later found as corpses)  <br>Pretty sure those were different kids. Definitely a wierd story.</br></br>  <br>I can't imagine it's this  bad. I have a book specifically for manga usage of the language, which is really close to standard. I see very little of any slurring to the extent the second post has.</br>  <br>Rather that "I've been bad" he was saying was was to blame, that he was guilty.</br>  <br>That would be "to claw at one's ankle".</br>  <br>I think 4 died out of the 10 of them.<br><br><br>I was just checking I was understanding what happened, but yeah, I was a bit literal on that translation.

Those are her tits swinging upwards in an incredibly baggy uniform.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Censored to shit<br>Literally 3 minutes of irrelevant loli to 30 seconds of actual animated war fighting<br>10 minutes of unnecessary political background bullshit<br><br>If the Love Live director continues on this direction of marginalizing the action and focusing on the cutesy shit, it'll be a fucking moeblob SoL road trip with /k/ sprinkles</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Big tits are the only thing they managed to carry over from the manga design.<br><br>I'm curious to see how they'll handle her combat scenes.</br></br></br>  <br> Itami has 5 girls in the harem. He hasn't boned any of them yet but deepened his relationship with each of them. There are many more girls outside the harem looking in like Giselle and Mabel, both apostles like Rory. </br>  <br> And yes until now Tuka calls Itami dad even though dad's found alive. </br>  <br>ex wife killed his sex drive</br>  This might not be the place for it, but Japan accepted the Giant robot 1 on 1 against America.  <br>Well rori's crazy battlelust expressions are still decent, so have faith?</br>  <br> I-I dont even.. <br>To be fair the women who made it to the top all had to be tough as nails to have gotten that far.</br></br>  <br>Eh, we'll see.<br><br>There hasn't really been any "real" combat scenes yet, so who knows, maybe they'll do a good job.</br></br></br>  <br> her combat scenes <br>Seeing how they're censoring this show, I doubt we'll have any.</br></br>  <br>That as a backward country militarily impotent to the West, they modernized to become a world power by 1905 but had their entire empire gone after the Asia-Pacific War?</br>  <br> Ehhhh that's kinda corny then. Don't wanna bone someone like that even if her design is great.<br><br>Not a fan of lolis but it looks like Rori is the closest to him.</br></br> </br>  Dakka .50s.  I will never be able to get over this<br> suffered surprise attack from the not Romans <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens and figuring out that they were kidnapped <br> oh no, the citizens were turned into slaves DURAMA <br> Diet being THAT retarded <br> no mention of Japan being USA's buttbudy <br> not a single world leader stopped and thought about learning the power of traveling to other worlds, or magic or any implications of this other than MUH RESOURCES <br>I dropped it at the shitty slave reveal so I don't know if any of this is answered later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> turned her into an idol <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> Japan is too retarded to bother checking for missing citizens <br><br>They're missing you dense fuck, if they knew where they are then they aren't missing.</br></br></br>  I don't understand why A-1 got this. The material is outside of their, how do you say it, scope?  <br>A-1 always gets popular franchises that already have an established fanbase. They don't care if they butcher it since fans are buying it anyways.</br>  <br> go missing right around the time they get attacked <br> GEE, I WONDER WHERE DID THEY GO? <br>How fucking retarded are you?</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be pretty obvious where they went? The choices are fantasyland and best corea.</br>  <br>They deserve it too.<br>Good squad.</br></br>  <br>The thing is even though they know they might be on the other side. They don't know where exactly. There is no indication that they are slaves of royality.</br>  <br> fake battles <br>As expected from america</br></br>  <br>There was a bit in the manga IIRC where the emperor warns the Japanese diiplomats something like "there was an empire that prided itself on its military might but it crumbled and was destroyed by outsiders".<br><br>Thus misunderstanding two key points: firstly, that Japan's military isn't all that powerful, and secondly, that Japan's military empire has already collapsed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You don't cross off people with no confirmed bodies.  The missing Japanese people were taken on previous scouting missions even before the Gate went up. It's in the manga when Noriko was hospitalized. Her family was near the gate distributing flyers of her and her husband, her husband died in the mines, and their house is burned down after a long time of no one in there. </br></br>  <br>And NONE of the JSDF reports on this foreign culture mentioned "they take prisoners as slaves from the people they attack, we should ask them if they took any of ours"?</br>  <br>Maybe ask one of those senators they were buddying up with? Maybe actually bother to investigate, or maybe use their peanut brains to figure out that a culture that obviously practices slavery could have put their citizens in chains and thought nothing of it?<br>Slavery is obviously completely normal to them and they don't have any human rights codes.<br>That forced drama scene really pissed me off.</br></br></br>  <br> we should ask them if they took any of ours <br>They would have probably told them the truth, too.<br>We were shown that they were all surprised that the Nips got so butthurt about slavery.<br> yeah we took your people, so what? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Man i love .50</br>  <br>Those missing people were taken before the Gate went up in Ginza. Get pissed at your own stupidity.</br>  <br>Yeah, this is way more on madhouse's line of work</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7u8<wbr>mheM2Hrg</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Their reaction was fucking weird.<br><br> they don't enslave people? so who works in the mines? <br><br>yeah, sure, the majority of mine workers in the roman empire were slaves, but it's not like they had no concept of paid work either. so hard to make the guess that workers get paid?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They really went for the armored core mechas eh?<br>Goddamn i know that fucking gundam will come to life when the aliens invade</br></br>  <br>Middle ages mining was fucking dangerous or at least uncomfortable.<br>If someone had a choice, they would prefer working land than mining. And it would not be profitable if they paid miners enough.</br></br>  <br>It's still retarded that they didn't think that some of their own people could have been turned into slaves. Then they acted all surprised and horrified that the savages were savages.<br>It's shitty writing, get fucked</br></br>  <br>And we won't be alive when it happens. I wish I could be an apostle like Rory only so I could witness the creation of the first Gundam</br>  <br> miners getting paid <br> anyone willingly going into the mines <br>You go there to suffer and die</br></br></br>  <br>It's retarded that you think a defeated medieval army would take prisoners and slaves back to their kingdom.<br>Japan didn't know scouts were around a few months before the invasion. It fits everything except your baiting agenda.<br> get fucked <br>Just last night.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The joke is that Japan has pretty much no mines, because their natural resources are absolute shit.</br>   all those 10/10 babes - human, elf and demihuman - practically crawling out of the woodwork as the manga goes on <br>I'm scared to see how they're gonna fuck them up considering the abortion that is </br>  <br> It fits everything except your baiting agenda <br>No it doesn't. It doesn't matter when they were taken, what matters is that Japan didn't even think of the possibility that the enemy may have taken their citizens.<br> valid complaints are now bait <br>Kill yourself retard</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ow rude</br>  <br>Where would the invaders have found the time to capture citizens and take them back beyond the gate before they were shot? Wouldn't that be left for after they'd already seized territory?</br>  <br><br>Idolm@ster much?</br></br>  <br> what matters is that Japan didn't even think of the possibility that the enemy may have taken their citizens <br>Still retarded bait<br>The possibility didn't exist at first because they finished the invaders right away<br>Getting slaves doesn't exist in modern era and they don't know shit about the empire<br>Interviewing the prisoners must have yielded nothing of importance since they couldn't even understand each other at first<br>So it does matter when they were taken, it's a blind spot when considering all that has happened<br>Japan didn't know gates were already opened earlier for scouting missions<br> Kill yourself retard <br>You should be thankful you're still alive<br>Imagine the news tomorrow if I didn't reply to your bait</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Geez, idiots are world wide, no need to go 'its them murrican faggots! its always their fault!" simply because theres and idiot afoot.</br>  <br>Don't worry it's either he's retarded or it's bait.<br><br>I prefer to go with the latter</br></br></br>  <br> if they can open a giant permanent gate there's no way they can create smaller temporary access points <br> Japan has no previous experience with their citizens being secretly kidnapped by an enemy state <br>It's obviously meant to be analogous to the North Korean thing except now they're allowed to do something about it.</br></br></br>  <br> dissapear months before gate incident <br> impossible that the enemy may have scouted before and took citizens <br>I don't even know why I bother replying to this meta bating. See you later retard.</br></br></br>  <br> impossible that the enemy may have scouted before and took citizens <br>Maybe they believed that if the enemy HAD scouted beforehand then surely they wouldn't have charged in like retardeds because all the evidence would have been that they were hopelessly outmatched.</br></br>  <br> missing people were not top priority <br> gate didn't appear before the Ginza incident to their knowledge <br> roman peasants in Japan wouldn't look strange given how weird Japanese fashion is <br>Go get yourself a new shitposting angle while I get fucked by my girl, nerd.</br></br></br></br>  <br> roman peasants in Japan wouldn't look strange given how weird Japanese fashion is <br>otaku scum on their way to a cosplay party</br></br>  why introduce so much people to just kill them left and right?  filename  <br>I can live without the giant fucking tits and nipples that are erect 24/7 (I'm kinda annoyed that they made her ditch the vest just so they could show off her tits), but everything else about her in the anime makes me mad.</br>  It is out.  <br>Not in this chapter, search it 4 yourself, lazyfag</br>  <br><br>He was shown last chapter dead in the same scene.</br></br>  <br>You're a terrible symptom of how retarded people can be on this site.</br>  <br> 4 yourself <br> calling other lazy when you are not able to press 3 extra buttons </br></br>  <br>I guess once you go black you can go back</br>  Where were you when best girl came back?  <br>Fucking finally</br>  <br>Raw WHERE!</br>  <br>What the hell are they doing to her? Do they want to break the Moeko even further?</br>  <br>Google</br>  <br>MEIKO BEST</br>  Is there anything he can't do?
