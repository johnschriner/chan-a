But I'm fine with that. Ireneverse is a neat way to wrap up Stone Ocean. Steel Ball Run was a fresh start and it's working out pretty damn great without any connection to Irene.  The Ireneverse is probably just the SBR universe, isn't it?<br><br>I'm hoping part 9 closes the loop and ends the series by focusing on Irene and her adventures. Given the pattern SBR and Jojolion have established Part 9 would be a mashup of Parts 5 and 6 anyway.</br></br>  <br>It's beautiful</br>  <br>It doesn't matter. By the time JoJolion finishes in 2021, you will have forgotten about it.</br>  <br>Still would have been a better ED than last train home</br>  <br> implying Jojolion will end in your lifetime <br><br>Araki doesn't have to mettle with mortal perceptions of time.</br></br></br>  If anyone remembers from a while back, I got the grade back on the anthro essay about DIOs THE WORLD and Japanese xenophobia and all other stuff from JoJo.  I got an A   so uhhh, maybe part 8 does take place in the same universe as stell ball run afterall? Johnny's dead brother looks almost exactly like Josuke. Maybe he's the ancestor of a bastard son conceived right before his death? That sounds stupid but this is jojo so I dunno.    <br>Why did Pucci want to help Dio anyway? He saw what Dio did in Jotaro's memories (sidewalk mass murder, killing of the cat etc) yet he considers him the second coming of Christ.<br><br>Is Pucci just crazy?</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's evil? An evil bastard meets an evil bastard, they team up. That's literally what happened</br>  <br> Why did Pucci want to help Dio anyway? <br>He's very gay</br></br>  <br>Last train home was very fitting honestly, even though I'd have preferred this one<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FTQ<wbr>biNvZqaY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Is Yasuho really the reincarnation of Koichi's hot sister instead of him?  Does the download link in the pastebin for Vento Aureo contain better scans for the latter part or is it all composed of "old scans" just like the one on batoto?  So if Dio came from a low-class English family, did he have a cockney accent all this time?    <br>Yes but he puts on airs of a posh accent all the time unless you piss him off.</br>  Post your favourite stand song?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=26w<wbr>rvblgGP0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    David Production Inc.<br>Address: 4-21-1-2F, Tanashi-cho, Nishi Tokyo City, Tokyo, 188-0011, Japan<br>Tel: +81-42-467-0797 / Fax: +81-42-467-0798<br><br>Call them and tell them to start working on part 4.</br></br></br></br>  What's the stand you like the most appearance wise but hate the most powerwise?

It's design isn't quite as cool as In a Silent Way, nor is it's ability qui~~~~~te as boring as his.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait a second, how did Sandman's stand utilize the powers of silent sound effects? That makes no sense.</br>  <br> That makes no sense. <br>Have you realized what manga you're reading?</br></br>  <br>There's obviously some funky shit going on with the Hirose family (Just like there's funky shit going on everywhere in part 8), so there may very well be a Koichi running around.  His father got custody </br>  <br>where's her lower body?</br>  Would you play a shitty jojo game like this? Serious question.  <br>Games suck</br>  If you combine Tusk Act 4 with Green Green Grass Of Home, waddaya get?  <br>Maybe for the keks, but it's not very appealing.<br>The answer remains「NO」</br></br>  What's this about Part 4's ED going to be "Build me up Buttercup"?  <br>No, no one is a reincarnation. Yasuho makes a lot of references to Koichi and even their names are written almost identically, while Koichi's sister on the other hand was barely even a character.</br>  <br>I played 7th Stand User, had a good time.<br><br>Would I play some weird mmo based on JoJo? Ehhhhhhh... They would need to do a DAMN good job with stands, and have a framework where people can make shit happen independent of whatever bullshit story the devs came up with (because there's like no way it'd have a good plot.).<br><br>Really, if it had maybe 20 or stand bases you could choose from, and it let you add modifiers (Fire based damage, bonus damage under 50% health, disadvantage of having shit hp), let you draw your own stand pixelart, and just gave players a lot of customization options in general, it would be fucking sweet.<br><br>Customization and community roleplay features would be the key, even if it had RPG Maker 2000 tier combat and graphics like 7th stand user did.<br><br>I could see myself playing something like that on the reg, I already keep going back to Space Station 13 and it's not very much different.<br><br>Matter of fact, SS13 is probably what I would look to for ideas. Construction and shit wouldn't really have a place, but a "traitor" mode where 1 person selected randomly gets a fucking OP stand and the directive to kill everybody else without getting taken down would be sweet. Give players the option to join the bad guy for a "minion win" or something, include permadeath to make all the Zeppelli sacrifices meaningful, set it up so that each round lasts like 5 hours.<br><br>Too bad I don't know jack shit about coding.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit 10/10</br>  I don't really care what they do<br><br>If Araki confirms the SBR universe to be the Ireneverse and actually does something cool with it (like Girono or some plot device that links to the original universe) and doesn't fuck it up then i'll be happy<br><br>If Araki decides to keep this universe entirely separate from the last one then i'll also be happy<br><br><br>The only thing i wish that would happen is add more pages to each chapter to cover more stuff<br>We're already missing out on 1/3 of jojo each year compared to back when it was in shonen jump</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure about the first season's ED (How Bizarre maybe?) but if the second season's ED isn't Killer Queen or Another One Bites the Dust then I will personally travel to Japan to murder everyone at DP</br>  <br>Licensing a Queen song would make the entire two seasons look like DIO's World part 3.</br>  <br>Well then, I guess I have a lot of BDs to buy</br>  OKAY. Let´s fucking settle this.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=unu<wbr>adNjSbRw</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NYj<wbr>ZnI9_kg8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Who ?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not using high dio laugh <br><br>I prefer DIO's laugh but I love how Kars' laugh came out of nowhere<br><br>going to have to go with dio tho</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably not. SBR-verse has a Jotaro in Part 8, and it's a young woman. Not Irene's dad.</br>  <br>Kira is much more of a reference to Jotaro than Kyo is.</br>  <br>I haven't checked, but the "good scans" aren't finished yet. Just read the good ones on baototo, then find where you left off in the bad scans.</br>  <br>The Ireneverse is sort of like the scratch from Homestuck whereas the universe where SBR takes place is like Marvel's Ultimate universe.</br>  <br>Plot would be same as the manga. Creating instances with the events happening in the manga. Like you would go to DIO's mansion and join an instance and you would progress to Part 2 and so on.<br>For stands it would be a copy of originals. Some stat modifiers would be added though. Custom stands are a great idea but how many people would actually do it?<br><br>There would be events such as Find the identity of the King Crimson's user. Stop the Gay priest before earth resets. Stop the murders in the Morioh and like that. All the event stands would have global affects. Like timeskip would lag the shit out of servers and BtD would kill anyone trying to reveal the users name.<br>Permadeaths are not what i had in mind though.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>None of that sounds very good yo.<br><br>What you outlined is stuff that would be good for a singleplayer game, and stuff that would be annoying and hard to implement without adding a lot of fun.<br><br>Custom stands should be integral to the game, established characters should really be NPC's.<br><br>What you're proposing is a game that is solely designed to let people reenact shit, but an MMO needs to let players have a bit of freedom or they'll get bored and quit in like an hour. Considering how low-key something like this would be, you'd start with maybe 10-25 interested players, and those numbers would dwindle and die within a month. What you want is for it to kind of grow and grow up until you get to like 100+, then make whatever shit you made open source so people can make their own servers and do as they wish. From there it should hopefully erupt, than implode, and by the time you're done you might have 400 or so people regularly playing your game in their own little sub-communities.<br><br>Agency bro. It's about player agency, in and out of the game.<br><br>All that said though, I've never actually tried that shitty Naruto game you referenced, it might be good. I still think 7th Stand User and Space Station 13 should be your ideal reference points though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's almost like the start of JoJolion is a different series to the last year of chapters we've had, it's really odd. I remember loving the start but something changed when I had to endure six months of origami sameface bullshit.<br><br>Come back to where you once belonged, JoJo ;_;</br></br>  <br>Wait is this something I can really do, because I would totally ring them all day, every day to yell <br> "DIA NO CURASHU" </br></br>  <br>I like Part 8 a whole lot, what I don't like is the month wait for each new chapter.<br><br>I wait for like 4 fucking weeks for like 5-10 minutes of reading enjoyment, then done. It makes me grow very weary of scenarios very "fast", because I'm hungry for shit to progress but it just won't happen.</br></br></br>  <br>That was only two months and it was almost two years ago by now. <br><br>The last two chapters have been easily the best of the part yet so I'm not quite following you here.</br></br></br>  <br> That was only two months and it was almost two years ago by now. <br>I mean everything with Tsurugi in general. I remember we had a hiatus in between the two most boring chapters which didn't help and you're right that the two latest chapters have been great but it seems like the 5 before that were hell.</br></br>  <br>Well, again, I personally thought that was some of the best stuff yet. Aishou was an entertaining character and the teamwork between non-combat stands was interesting to see.</br>  Who's the best JoJo and why is it  JoJo ?   <br>Those story instances are just there for advancement. I think you didn't play any popular naruto games or that one really great Bleach game ever. My main goal was actually that Bleach game. The game would be heavily PVP. Custom stands are hard to balance and it could be buggy. Bleach game had shit tons of grinding. Whether it be killing monsters or training. Instead of that using story mode for leveling seemed better. Both the naruto game and bleach game had at least 100 people playing it at every hour of the day at some point.</br>  <br>Three months of beetlebowl was a bit much for me too. I guess my complaint is the monthly format and how I don't think it lends well to reading at release.</br>  <br>Of course JoJo is the best JoJo.</br>  <br>Shut up you faggot, everyone knows that JoJo is best JoJo</br>  <br> JoJo <br> Implying JoJo isn't the best JoJo since JoJo <br><br>Fucking plebs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Thinking that JoJo is a good JoJo <br>Man, can your taste be any more shit?</br></br>  <br>I just had my first JoJo experience, reading through the entirety of Phantom Blood. I feel it was a good idea to read the manga first.<br> Bruford and Dio's fights were amazing, RIP Joestar <br> Leaving the thread now to avoid spoilers, will pick up Battle Tendency tomorrow morning </br></br></br>  <br>Than just do you man, we're both clearly on different pages, as well as unfamiliar with each others reference points.</br>  <br>JoJo &gt; JoJo &gt; JoJo &gt; JoJo &gt; JoJo &gt; JoJo &gt; GioGio</br>  So. Will the dub be revealed today?  <br> GioGio below Autism Jojo </br>  <br>Never mind. Just checked the expo schedule. It's tomorrow at 1:45. Not sure what time zone they're in.</br>  So I just catch up to ongoing and want to know what do you guy sthink about josuke true appearance?<br>Do you think he will get it back eventually?</br>   Rihanna referenced in JoJolion <br>How very modern of Araki</br>  <br>Every part has references to contemporary artists.</br>  <br>Part 6 had plenty of early 2000 references when it was running.</br>  <br>Didn't he reference Limp Bizkit at the height of their popularity?</br>  Have you guys noticed that most of the shoes from part 1-3 are impossible to put on?

I suppose it was considered cool to be a big man who doesn't talk much but just gives that gloomy look and punch shit for Araki at that time.</br>  <br>Man, imagine if they bust out the minor villains for every part like they are for part 3.</br>  <br> Pet Shop confirmed for EoH <br><br>uh oh</br></br></br>   Every american falls in love with japanese and go live in Japan by Araki's logic <br>Am I the only one dislike this asspull?</br>  i'm only a layman within psychology, but if you would diagnose kira (putting aside that he's a fictional character, and applying real life knowledge to fiction) what would you say that he suffers from?<br><br>since his killings are described as urges and that he knows that it's a problem if he gets caught, i'd say that he suffers from Antisocial Personality Disorders (ASPD)<br><br>this, because even though he gets what he always dreamt of: a quiet life, plus a "wife" and a "son", he, after a futile period of not killing anyone, kills that girl from the subway, showing his inability to live a "lawful" life<br><br>he views killing as "wrong" but only from a pragmatic POV, meaning, if he gets caught, his life is over, (now i know that "right and wrong" are very simplifying terms, but for the sake of arguing)<br><br>he puts up with this facade of being plain and average to maintain his lifestyle, fooling everyone he knows, except his father <br><br>when cornered, he freaks out and he can't manage stressful situations at all, killing hayato also shows his poor impulse control<br><br>i also thought that Diavolo would fit under ASPD, but since there's so little to know about him, much of his actions, and character are up to interpretation,<br><br>what do you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's delinquent schoolkid Clint Eastwood. What more do you want.</br>  <br><br>With Gyro's announcement things should get interesting for SBR. Or they could be cheap and stick to Gyro, Johnny, some variation of Diego, Valentine.</br></br>  <br>I'd say Retarded Fetish Syndrome (RFS)</br>  <br>I wouldn't say Kira has ASPD, he is far too calculating and despite having impulses to kill he is able to hold off from killing everyone as he would probably like. He might be some subset of Cluster A personality disorder (when we were taught about them , they told us cluster A is 'mad', cluster B is 'bad' and cluster C is 'sad'). Also another thing to go against him having ASPD is that for most of his life he was seen be a normal guy, ASPD tend to spend their teens/young adult years going in and out jail/getting into fights/getting into several and subsequently failing to maintain any relationships because of their impulses.<br><br>Diavolo has got to be Schizoid Personality disorder or Schizotypal Personality Disorder. It's literally his whole backstory and motivation.</br></br></br>  <br> Pet Shop <br>Pretty cool but how fucking long will the Part 3 character list get when the game is over?<br><br>Also RIP tiers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Diavolo has got to be Schizoid Personality disorder or Schizotypal Personality Disorder. It's literally his whole backstory and motivation. <br> <br>but isn't it Dissociative identity disorder he suffers from? since DID results in personality splits<br><br>the reason i think that diavolo would have ASPD is that he lacks any emotional ties whatsoever (dio and pucci have eachother, kars has the pillar men, kira has shinobu and his dad that and valentine loved his father)<br><br>he's easily the most unstable and apathetic villain, he has no restraints at all, his goal are purely selfish and he only cares about himself, nothing or no one else (actually kind of sad since he must have lived a pretty lonely life)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They still need to add the remaining HttF characters.<br><br>Midler and Alessi next.</br></br></br>  <br> Man, imagine if they bust out the minor villains for every part like they are for part 3. <br>It's bullshit, is what it is. We'll get 80% of the Stardust villains then one or two from every other part</br></br>  <br>Lack of emotional ties is also a big part of SPD. Diavolo would fit ICD-10 criteria for diagnosing it. I don't think he fits the impulsive nature of Cluster B PDs, And I don't think he outright disregards the rights of others and the law, he does it because it risks his solitary lifestyle which is a big part of SPD. Also, you know, 21st Century Schizoid Man and all that.<br><br>I'm not really sure what the whole deal with Doppio is exactly since he is somehow able to communicate with him and shit.</br></br></br>  What's the email of the guy who's organizing sono chi no kioku?

As for Midler, it'd be great seeing her HttF design in full 3D, and maybe they could include her original appearance as an alternate.<br><br>Iggy has been confirmed to be able to glide and/or fly with The Fool's glider mode.

Disregarding his relationship with Pucci since what we see are from flashbacks by a not exactly stable villain, he's incredibly manipulative if his charisma is to go by, takes joy in doing bad things to people just because, doesn't bother forming true bonds with anyone other than two people in his life, and if Araki is to go by, doesn't see the romantic or mutual side to having sex.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off satan people are still posting here<br>they want to talk about jojo and they are free to do it</br></br>  <br>The difference though is that Iggy is using a glider and is limited by how high he jumps while Pet Shop's strong falcon wings allow him to be midair for long periods of time.</br>  <br>I've seen flying characters done in a fighting game before.<br>Simply have an input that makes the character fly for a bit (top height with movement to sides allowed) before coming down again.<br>As long as the opponents have a good anti-air it's not really game-breaking at all.<br>I'd be more worried about Pet shop being too good at zoning so they'll obviously have to tinker with that and have the ability be charged so as to prevent some really nasty zoning from taking place.</br></br></br></br>  So I'm nearing the end of Part 6 (at least I assume so), currently on the Heavy Weather chapters, which are bizarre as shit and came out of nowhere. <br><br>I'm thinking about Part 7 on the side, and the only real exposure I've had with pic related is All-Star Battle footage and reading some things. His theme is one of my favorites from the ASB soundtrack, and D4C's powers seem pretty damn cool.<br><br>Tell me, is Funny Valentine a good villain? Is he the main one of SBR or does he get shelved for Diego midway through?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a villain so good, you might think he's actually right.</br>  <br>He's one of the best in the series. He gets replaced by D's Wood in the last few chapters.</br>  <br>Yeah, he is a good villain because  GyroDies </br>  <br> he's the main villain and yes, all of his actions were those of justice </br>  <br>But the time Diego has the spotlight isn't too long, right? One of the reasons I actually disliked Diavolo (and Part 5 as a whole) was when it came to the final battle with him, he got shelved for Silver Chariot Requiem midway through, and then it seems like after that, it was all "Okay final battle time" and then Gold Experience Requiem happened. I really don't want the same thing to happen in the parts after.</br>  <br>But Doppio is literally a different person, not just a personality. He gets Bruno's body, remember?</br>  <br>the final fight of part 5 was for the arrow, GER's just icing on the cake, i know it sucks but i think that's the way araki intended</br>  <br>i know, but i'll make an exception for the boss since it's the closest thing to diagnose him with</br>   127484385 <br>he's always there and is hinted as a main villain but gets properly introduced after diego gets shat on</br>  <br>this one: </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xmA<wbr>DpBu_ZCA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Well, looks like I know my main.</br>  CAT'S FOOT IRON CLAW  <br>how can one bird be this smug?</br>  <br>Post it</br>  JoJo Part 1 was best JoJo. Everything after that was shit.  <br>If you didn't put Gay Priest in there you don't deserve that A</br>  <br>W-what about him?</br>  <br>Dio pls</br>  <br>Said no one ever</br>  <br>Part 1 was Fist of the North Star meets Bram Stoker's dracula. That was neat, but hardly the best part.<br><br>SBR is the best, followed by part 4, which is my personal favorite.</br></br></br>  <br>My stand would be Swap Avi</br>  <br>Agreed.</br>  Reminder that If Diavolo hadn't sold the arrows to some old woman Avdol would be happy living in egypt, iggy would fuck a bitch in america kekyoin would have a stomach jotaro would kill himself because he is autistic and has no friends, Kira would live his life quietly  in prison  Shigechi would eat that one sandwich he would die to eat for, more importantly a gay priest wouldn't reset the world for his deceased lover.  What was something you assumed about Jojo before you actually got to it?<br><br>After hearing that Doppio fought against an enemy on his own, I thought he was an ally. I knew he was Diavolo, so I thought he was going to meet the group and accompany them as "The Boss's Right Hand", but then eventually turn out to be him. That would have been pretty cool.</br></br>  <br>I assumed JoJo's Bizarre Adventure would be Jorge Joestar levels of incomprehensible. Then I looked at Phantom Blood and realized it was about a family bloodline fighting the supernatural, and realized it's more comprehensible than I thought.</br>  <br>I assumed JoJo was all jokes and no seriousness</br>  <br>I thought Polnareff and Avdol would be useful<br>I also thought that Jotaro was a good protagonist</br></br>  <br>Nah, Dio would still be running around and Avdol still wouldn't have a quiet life.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DfI<wbr>YQWXBxEA</wbr>  [ ]<br>I'll just leave this here</br>  <br>That part 3 would be fantastic<br><br>Boy was I naive</br></br></br>  <br> that pic <br><br>great</br></br></br>  <br> polnareff <br>Did you even read/watch part 3?</br></br>  Are they going to be using English accents in the dub?  <br><br>I had skimmed a summary of part 2 at some point and had somehow gotten the impression that Wham changed sides and allied with Joseph. Even when I actually read it and got to the part where he was just a bloody torso lying on the ground, I was still thinking "I guess they'll just carry him around like a backpack".</br></br>  <br>Here's a few more from me.<br><br>Since the wikipedia page for Jojo was Part 3 Vol 1 as the picture, I thought the series was about Jotaro, and was waiting for him to show up when I watched the 2012 anime. <br><br>From the beginning I always thought stands were more interesting because of first impressions. I also always thought Part 3 had a really nice charm because of that.<br><br>I first that I saw of Jojo was All-Star Battle. When the people playing said Giorno was Dio's son, I thought he was a villain, or at least had a larger tie to Dio than he did in the actual manga. I thought that Jolyne was the protagonist of a part where Giorno was the villain, or that they teamed up or something. I just assumed because it would have been a sort of continuation of the bloodlines' conflict.<br><br>I also remember when I was on Part 1 and 2 it had the commercials mixed into the episode. I think it said "Wrath of the Pillar Men" or something and then they showed the figures. Since I didn't know was a pillar man was, I thought Purple Haze was one. It's because of those commercials that I first got interested by how Part 4 looked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering (part 2) Joseph is gonna be voiced by Numbah 1, it would be a waste if they didn't.</br>  <br>Polnareff lost 90% of his fights,made two of his companions die for his incompetence (one of them twice) and did jackshit during the DIO fight.<br>His biggest accomplishment when not backed up by others is hardly beating a fucking doll.</br></br>  <br>Avdol I gotta tell you bro your description of Dio was super gay.<br><br> GOLDEN HAIR AND ALABASTER SKIN <br><br>Who says that outside of romance novels</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>50 Shades of Magician's Red</br>  <br> Die for his incompetence <br> Avdol pushed Polnareff and Iggy out of the way of the invisible attack they didn't know about <br> Iggy saved Polnareff when he told him not to <br>I'll give you the first Avdol death though</br></br></br></br>  <br>A friend of mine told me about Diavolo, being the boss and all.<br><br>I thought that I would find a really menacing guy, but it was just another faggot, like everyone on Vento Aureo.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought Jotaro's stands was named Avdol for some reason. I also thought that this shit would be some kind of child's show with adventures with a happy theme.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2KP<wbr>plYp7K7M</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>He's supposed to be hot as fuck and ultra charismatic.</br>  <br>Does part 6 have a MAD?</br>  <br>Doesn't help that I am pretty sure Dio's actual power is not time stop, but to make everyone want to fuck him<br><br> Then again vampires have been inextricably linked with sexuality since Dracula if not before, so really there's no point in me saying this at all </br></br></br>  <br> Remember, the announcement of the Part 3 anime happened 6 months after part 2 ended and then 6 months from that the anime finally came out </br>  <br>Polnareff actually fought with people. Kekyoin did nothing the whole series. Got his eyes scratched by a blind man. Died like 1 day after he returned. All he did was revealing DIO's power and DIO casually told Jotaro about his powers. Even if he didn't Jotaro would be able to figure it out.</br>  <br>DUBIOUS SENSUALITY</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br>I hadn't heard about this yet.

I thought JoJo was entirely a comedy series because of all the ridiculous shit I had heard. I was so confused when I watched PB because of how seriously it took itself. <br><br>I also thought stands were made of Hamon.</br></br></br>  <br>It was literally a stand off for the arrow. Hell, when Giorno figures out one of them is possessed, they even have a mexican stand off formation.</br>  In latest chapter when the brother showed up I thought Araki is fucking with me and it was actually only one person out there  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/Mwx4ZsIUeTA  [ ]</br>  <br>Completely the same for me.</br>  <br><br>Reminder: Every part of JoJo is good and if you disagree then you can fuck off to some other general</br></br>  <br><br>Is Karera this world's Yukako? I hope one of them has a punchghost so they can add another part 8 person to EoH</br></br>  <br>Shows that are outright ridiculous but take themselves seriously with style are great. It has to go beyond b-movie cheese though.</br>  <br><br>That's right actually. Weather Report is the stupidest stand in the entire series, and the only good arc is the Survivor arc and C-Moon(not Made in Heaven). Jolyne and Hermes were cool but that's it for characters.<br><br>Meanwhile, King Crimson was the main antagonist, so it's only normal for him to have a stupidly OP stand, and GER was guaranteed to be an "I win" button. Did you not get that impression after multiple volumes of trying to get the arrow?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought that stands were literally weaponized music. Like people creating stands based on their favorite songs.</br>  <br>This guy is the opposite for me. I think his power is incredibly cool and it's a shame he was only a minor villain, but damn this stand is ugly as sin. Part 5 does that a lot I've noticed.</br>  <br>Well if that were to happen Araki would have to show that in the next 2 months unless CC2 has inside info since the game is coming out this year, supposedly. I doubt they could just whip up a Karera character that easily. Also, that reminds me. EoH demo 2 when? They announced like two weeks ago that it would be coming out very soon</br>  <br> Meanwhile, King Crimson was the main antagonist <br>what? where does it say that? are you thinking of when everyone switched bodies, and diavolo was represented by KC?</br></br>  <br>To me, Stone Ocean isn't bad, but some of the Stands that don't belong to main characters are basically older stands done worse, or just full of complete nonsense you'd think Araki was running out of ideas. Goo Goo Dolls is basically Little Feet again, Marilyn Manson is Osirus/Atum with more bullshit, I like Stands better when you can explain their concept in a single sentence without all this side crap and loopholes.</br>  <br>Didn't Paisley Park do that too?<br><br><br>Weather Report is the stand of Weather Report, Weather Report is the brother of Pucci, both of them own really OP stands, Pucci stole Weather's memories because it was way too dangerous for his plans, it was guaranteed to be really powerful. <br><br>Made in Heaven is also a really cool and powerful stand, why are you saying that? Because it's ''too bullshit''? Do you even like Jojo?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you must suck araki's dick else you can't post here </br>  What will the bonuses be for the last two blu-rays?<br>Kakyoin puppet?<br>OH THAT'S A BASEBALL or F-Mega game?<br>Road Roller figure?<br> Kakyoin pencil cap? </br></br></br></br>  <br> I like Stands better when you can explain their concept in a single sentence without all this side crap and loopholes <br><br>So what you're saying is that you don't like any part past part 3?</br></br></br>  <br>You wanna talk about bullshit stands?</br>  <br>Finally, someone else who likes this Stand. I'm not the only one.<br><br>Sale is the only Part 5 character besides everyone who was in ASB that I want to see in EoH. He could "fix" his opponent's attacks in place, kinda like Dio stopping time and placing knives.</br></br></br>  <br>Last Blu Ray you get a ticket to go to some JoJo event. Also are there 4 BDs or 5? Because I thought the 3rd already came out, I checked a site that shows sales of anime BDs</br>  Any comments on Al 'Weird Al' Yankovic posting the JoJo clip where his name is mentioned on his Instagram?  <br> Not liking Jotaro's one liners </br>  <br>I haven't gotten to 7 or 8 and I'm on the tail end of 6.

It comes with an Iggy and Petshop cellphone strap. It'll be six, with the 5th having D'Arby + Vanilla Ice, and the 6th being DIO's World.</br>  <br>You know where you are? Anything slightly big gets posted almost immediately</br>  <br><br>Pretty much every stand has a straightforward explanation in part 4 and 5, with the exception of King Crimson (which can be attributed to translation problems) and Gold Experience, who gets a random ability every few chapters.</br></br>  <br>That'd be really cool. Another guy that was sorely missing in ASB that I hope gets into EoH was this dude. I think he had a lot of potential in a fighting game.</br>  <br>I never said you have to praise them just that they're good. Hating any part is fucking retarded.<br><br><br>6? Really?

They were only bizarre.</br></br>  <br> Polnareff <br> Not useful </br></br>  <br>I don't know, a lot of them just kinda bothered me. I also just wish there weren't 13 chapters dedicated to people turning into fucking snails.<br><br>Speaking of Part 6, I think I remember hearing somewhere that Boingo grew up to become a comic illustrator, and then I see this. Is it true, or is it just coincidence? (He's gotta be in his 20s-30s at this point if SDC was 1989)</br></br></br>  <br><br>But Stardust Crusaders and Stone Ocean aren't that good.

I didn't find the characters to be well developed enough and it didn't help that the scans and translations are all awful, so I couldn't make out half of the action panels. Plus Araki tried to make things too complicated with King Crimson, and it got to be very confusing.</br>  <br>scanlation</br>  <br>Based Doc delivers once more</br>  7&gt;4&gt;5&gt;2&gt;3&gt;6&gt;1<br> implying this isn't the best taste <br>Part 5 is actually good and interesting. 6 is shit and reading it is a chore.</br></br>  <br>SC has a much better finale and characters.<br>Giorno is the worst jojo and Diavolo is the worst villain.</br></br>  <br> Implying Doc did it <br>The scanlations pop up on shonengamez.com like it says in the actual pic.</br></br>  <br>He still brought it when no one else did.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but im aware, im just too lazy to check their website for updates.</br>  <br> riding Docs cock this hard </br>  <br> 6 is shit. <br>Opinion discarded. I hope you cried when Jotaro jobbed and died.</br></br>  <br>Second demo coming out? Sweet. Can't wait to see all the new team supers.</br>  <br>I am not an autist anon :^)</br>  <br> What are reaction pics <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>It's also going to have online</br>  7 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 6 = 8  Why is part 1/2 anime so much better looking than part 3? This isn't bait, I'm serious, part 1/2 anime changes the color palette for characters all the time, and it's full of cool drawings like this, part 3 is just regular stuff.  <br> 6 so low <br> 8 so low (probably because you're an autist who can't handle waiting for monthly chapters) </br></br>  <br>Which characters are going to be in the demo, again?<br>I know it's the ones from the first demo, Kars, N'doul and I think there was someone else.</br></br>  <br>Previous scans http://imgur.com/a/bpzph</br>  <br>Color change can be annoying as fuck. Also part 1 and 2 look like a slidshow, don't lie</br>  Living the dream.  <br>Tosh looks pretty cool.</br>  FUCK YOU TOSH, YOU TRAITOR.    <br> I see a butthurt hentaifag  <br>I admit I would like to see Tosh draw porn again. But if it weren't for SnS his artstyle wouldn't have improved so drastically. You'll have to be patient until the series is done or goes on a long break.</br></br>    <br>People go where the money is.</br>  <br>They have two chefs?</br>  How does it feel to sit between a man who makes a living drawing semen demons, and a girl who makes a living being a semen demon?  <br>Sometimes he looks kinda cute.</br>  A second chef? Was miss gravure model not cutting it?  <br>Like regular thursday for that guy.</br>  <br>Ah. Of course Kuga would solve multiple dishes.<br>What now for Souma?</br></br>  <br> Solve <br>Serve. Fuck me, I need sleep.</br></br>  <br> me, my art slave, my waifu, my manservant and my kitchen slave </br>  Tsukuda's tanning session didn't go so well  <br>He looks like a stereotypical otaku from a manga, flannel shirts and all. I'm impressed.</br>  How good was the adaptation anyhow?<br><br>I'm planning on rereading the manga as I dropped it during one of the slower arcs, but was the anime any good and how much did it adapt?</br></br>  <br>Which arc did you drop at?</br>  <br>I think it was the bit where they were going through Megumi's backstory during some sort of tournement she was involved in.</br>  <br>Just binge read it from there.<br><br>The anime's doing a pretty good job, adaptation-wise. The manga content isn't compressed not rushed, &amp; the pacing's pretty consistent, so far. I'd give it a solid 9, in that aspect.</br></br></br>  <br>Does it get better from the point I was at? <br><br>Yeah I'll probably binge read it from that point.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to be done with the elections first, before moving on to other non-tourney stuff.</br>  <br>That chef in the back a cute.</br>  Will she ever lea  <br> lea <br>?</br></br>  <br>wheres my fucking onsen scan</br>  <br>Does this mean the anime is going for a third cour</br>  <br>Chink scans where?</br>  <br>No. Its only 24 episodes. We'll have to wait for a second season.</br>  <br>What the fuck is meat even doing there?</br>  <br>copypastajack got him</br>  <br>nah<br><br>2nd season basically confirmed though</br></br></br>  <br>You might as well ask what Isami's doing there. Being in the preliminaries.</br>  <br>Tomorrow. Probably someone from Jifeng posted this scan here.</br>  <br>He actually mentioned that from the start. He said the mapo tofu was just the headliner dish.</br>  <br>I thought Takumi was holding onto Souma's bandana for a bit there, but it's just in front of his hand.</br>  <br>I thought that at first too, but he is just doing his usual pose.<br><br>Why does Takumi love to do that so much?  Does he think he looks cool? </br></br></br>  <br>Being disgusting.</br>  <br>he's cooking-chuuni</br>  <br> Dat onsen Erina <br><br>Jesus, Tosh.</br></br></br>  <br>Please tell me there's an onsen Alice too.</br>  <br>They actually have another chef? Why? Hopefully they both the chef and Morisaki both make poses for Tosh to make his job easier. Poor chef and editor are nameless.<br><br><br>Second cour will end with probably like 5 eps of him being seen already. Doubtful on Mimasaka's actual content appearing though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Yuki is more a gravure model than a proper chef.</br>  <br>the way I heard it, morisaki was more like a culinary advisor, not so much a chef herself. chef in the picture is probably just some person who cooks what they ask her to while giving descriptions of what she's doing, smelling, and seeing, but without giving any creative input.<br><br>it'd be like the difference between a coach and a physical trainer on a sports team, I guess?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm rather happy to see that Tosh isn't fucking disgusting looking.</br>  <br>He's married so I'd be surprised if he was.</br>  <br> married people are less likely to look fucking disgusting <br>Hello, do you actually live in the real world?</br></br>  <br>I'm not into men or asians, but I'd hazard a guess that for an asian male, he's decently attractive. Not a supermodel by any means, but I think there's women that would see him as like a 7/10?</br>  Tsukuda is a qt  <br>His hair style isn't very complimenting.</br>  <br>Tsukuda a smug.</br>  <br>Why is Tsukuda so pink?</br>  <br>No she was long involved with cuisine before she ever got scouted. As in uber cake age when they found her IIRC.<br><br><br>Morisaki has a decent background from what I remember, maybe the chef is there for workload reasons. Never knew of the chef being around before this though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had mapo toufu the other day. Definitely a recommendation to everyone fond of spicy food.</br>  <br>Because he knows that Morisaki Yuki isn't wearing panties.</br>  <br>Dat Sakaki Ryouko<br>Only girl to challenge the "Best Girl" position held by   ______Alice </br></br>  <br>Restaurant or home cooked?</br>  <br>Restaurant. I can't cook for shit.</br>  don't know why people seem to hate on morisaki. she's basically like hishoko, she's treated people young and old, and her family has some background similarly as well. it's kind of weird why she would enter the tv industry and work on this manga, but i guess the easier cash flow is probably it   Hishoko becoming a TV idol <br>Yes or no?</br>  <br> 88888 <br>Welp</br></br>  <br>Damn. The cheap places I go to don't make them.<br><br>I saw a quick video on how to make it, and it doesn't look that hard. Hardest part is just getting the right ingredients.</br></br></br>  <br>Goddamit I dress like Tosh.</br>  Be honest /a/, When did you start noticed that Hisako existed?  <br>How well can you draw tits, ass, and dick?</br>  In preparation for Symphogear GX, let's discuss what our favourite girls and songs are.<br><br>Having just finished season 2 to get ready for GX, I have to say Seigi wo Shinjite Nigiri Shimete is definitely the best Symphogear song. <br><br> I want Hibiki to push me down and have her way with me. </br></br></br></br>  I want to marry Chris.   Seigi wo Shinjite <br> not Rainbow Flower <br><br>Do you even UTAE?<br><br> I want to do butt stuff with Hibiki </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but HIBIKE HIBIKE HEART YO</br>  <br> not wanting to roar the elegy of love at full throttle </br>  I'm in this for Tsubasa.  <br>I'm in this for everyone.<br>Symphogear is not complete without all the gears, even the new ones.</br></br>  <br>I love DMJii, but Maria is still useless.</br>  <br>Maria is trying very hard. She'll surely be useful when she gets Airgetlam back.</br>  I'm surprised there's no s3 spoiler.  <br>Where would you even get spoilers from? Symphogear is an anime original. <br>At most you can find are some impressions for the episode 1 prescreening but they don't really tell you more than the trailers do.</br></br>  <br> Maria is trying very hard. <br>That just makes her more annoying.<br>I hope she stays locked up after the episode one duet. That's all she's good for, judging from G.<br><br><br>Chris-chan is cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread is now a Tsubasa worship thread.<br>Also every Nana song best song</br>  I bet Phara will knock Tsubasa out in episode 2.  <br>And then Maria saves her with her kung-fu skills.</br>    <br>I'm not on my home pc, I don't have any Tsubasa pics. Please forgive me for posting things scavenged off the official site.</br>  <br>I'm digging the sleeveless uniforms.</br>  Post Kirika.    <br>DESS</br>  <br> yfw you realize she has a scythe because she keeps saying DEATH </br>  <br>Or because her name is Kirika, which means  I want to fuck Kirika .</br>    I just want to befriend Aoi Yuuki.<br/>  <br/>  Who tops?  <br>Fine</br>  <br>I'm going to get yelled at, but there's something about her eyes that make her seem insincere.<br>Not even in that video, but just in all her photos.<br><br>It's probably just because they're so black, which feels unnatural to me.</br></br></br></br>  What are the odds that Chris' song isn't disappointing again?  <br><br>Isn't that just true for all VAs and Idols, or even maybe to japanese in general?<br>It's not like they're ever being encouraged to be open and sincere towards others. Even seemingly random losing of control and showing of emotion seems somehow artificial and follows specific social rules.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably mostly a VA/idol thing.<br>They're media personalities at the end of the day, which aren't known for being exactly genuine.</br></br>  Do the gears emit the instrumental music and backing vocals?<br><br>Why do the military people waste millions in ammunition against noise?<br><br>What the fuck was the frontier?<br><br>Why did they have a training montage instead of looking for Miku?<br><br>Why is Chris so cute?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do the military people waste millions in ammunition against noise? <br><br>This is one of the points that made me drop Ep.1 of S1 initially, that fucking clichee of helpless dumbfonded incompetent military guys that get just murdered by monsters while just standing there shooting them panicked. Also why do they have like 20th century military equipment and tanks in such a futuristic setting?</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't been around yesterday because I want to avoid the spoilers and I'm trying to not read this thread.<br>Where is the stream going to happen? I think ohys died.</br></br>  <br>Bullets do work against Noise, but only during the exact moment they phase out of their subspace to attack.<br>And isn't Symphogear supposed to be in a contemporary setting with just a few fancy designs for buildings and vehicles?</br></br>  To be honest, I don't give a fuck about the songs.  <br>neetball.<br>Don't worry, there aren't any spoilers yet, really.</br></br>  <br> spoilers <br>Chris-chan is cute.</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>http://mfi.re/watch/mci2ubi2pu9cshf<wbr>/1425258736956.webm</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Does this look like a contemporary setting?</br></br>  <br><br>Or this?</br></br>  <br>How? Symphogear without songs would be only half as fun.</br>  <br> Do the gears emit the instrumental music and backing vocals? <br>yes<br><br>just like a karaoke machine, says hibiki in one of the Zesshoushinai shorts</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well the rest of the city does. It's just some fancy building designs slapped in here and there.</br></br>  <br>I actually like how to songs actual reflect the personalities of the characters and show development without having them go into monologues.</br>  <br> a futuristic setting? </br>  <br> Tobe! = Take this! </br>  <br>Thomas designed them because it's Agematsu's request.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool then.</br>  I just noticed that Hibiki's zerker face looks kinda silly here.<br><br><br>Well of course do large parts of the citiy look like today, the city I'm living in also has lots of buildings that are 50-100 years old, for example the one I'm living in, and it looks not much different from a modern building.<br>Look at their technology, the floating translucent screens, the buildings. It's not playing in a distant future, but easily 50-100 years from our present.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that's a mix of really cool and really lame<br><br>neat lore though</br></br></br></br>  <br>MGS4 took place last year.<br>NGE is happening as we speak.</br></br>  <br>The Maria/Tsubasa concert was the shaking image, so that's a clue that something big will happen (besides the concert I mean).</br>  Hikasa said Evan Call lived in Gungnir that's why we got Kort el fes Gungnir intro.  <br>Yes, this. Even the OPs and EDs are thoroughly integrated into the show. I also like the variety of styles that they come up with (Chris gets the brasher ones, Nana gets more elegant and skillful ones, Hibiki gets the loud ones) to go with different action scenes.</br>  <br>you know these weird things that their suits have on their lower backs? those are the speakers, actually</br>  <br>But those are jet boosters.</br>  <br>DESS!</br>  <br> not striped <br>Satelight you had one job.</br></br>  <br>I thought she had shimapan.</br>  <br/>  <br><br> random edgy arrows and non-secured helmet that should fall off  <br>I hate it</br></br></br>  <br>Also it would be badass if she used that scythe like an actual polearm weapon, not whatever she was doing in G.</br>  <br> aoi yuuki in charge of not crying.webm <br>And she is crying again near the end of the live when nobody is looking.<br>I want to cuddle her.</br></br></br>  32 hours.  <br>Kirika and Shirabe's gear designs are fucking stupid</br>  <br> scythe <br> actual polearm weapon <br>How would you even do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Ver best girl, post more Ver</br>  <br> genuine <br>8man please.<br>Japanese people prioritize being polite over being sincere.<br>And Aoi was screaming her heart out during that performance, which such a raw display of emotion I don't what else more "genuine" do you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mod it into a war scythe, which is repositioning the blade to make it closer to a halberd/naginata.</br>  <br>It really is much better without the stupid skirt thing.<br>Not even just lewder, but objectively better.</br></br>  <br>She did that and but then turned it into a scissor.</br>  <br><br>that's just a shitty spear that peasants jury-rigged as polearms then</br></br>  <br>They're much more wield-able than a regular scythe configuration. That's why peasants modded them in the first place.</br>  <br><br><br>I thought that was the point, that they had edgy retarded costumes because they were initially evil</br></br></br>  <br>Do we know what date Third Impact is supposed to happen on?</br>  <br>Early January 2016. Probably new year's day.</br>  <br>They weren't really evil. Only Ver was evil.

Knew nothing but the fact they sang while fighting and that Tsubasa jam pic that I'd been seeing around for years. Definitely thought going in unspoiled made for a good deal of my enjoyment of the series. While I watched, I commented on Skype with a friend that said he wasn't interested in the series at all and spoiled pretty much every major event. Even showed a bunch of webms. He finished G today and apparently had a lot of fun despite knowing every single one of those random twists. Genuinely surprised.</br></br>  <br> Zettou Ame no Habakiri <br><br>Top level taste</br></br></br>  <br> Blogshit incoming. <br>Because saying that first makes it okay.<br>Nobody cares about your faggot friend.</br></br></br>  <br>Use spoilers tags if you must drop blogshit you wouldn't want to get a short ban right before the live stream.</br>  <br>Different people enjoy things differently.

He said something in the line of (IIRC) that he will write a "OregaIru" style ending that people will accept it and people won't accept it. <br><br>In other words, vague answer as always, people just like to interpret it according to what they want.</br></br></br>  <br>Post Iroha.</br>  <br>Hey, Iroha ops are the bloody best. Back before the anime started the only way to not have a shitpost infested thread was an Iroha op. <br><br>I used to make them because the animeonly people had no idea who she was, so putting Iroha as the OP was literally a way to guarantee that a thread would be devoid of shitposts. <br><br>Obviously it doesn't work anymore, but it was pretty damn fantastic at the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I definitely think it's most likely to happen, I definitely would not like it.<br><br> I want to struggle and shit to reach muh genuine regardless of the consequences <br> Oh, let's just stay friends and ignore our romantic feelings. <br><br>It just wouldn't feel right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I interpret it however I want. I like pissing people off and Hayama NTR isn't as effective so pushing the friends end agenda I manage to get reactions from YYfags.</br>  Was bored, made this.<br>Please explain what happened.</br>  <br><br>I think Hachiman is going to pick a girl but they can't be together because reasons. Probably Yukino since she has the most red flags to preclude a happy romantic ending for her.</br></br>  <br>Great trolling, friendo</br>  <br>I was thinking that the romantic feelings will flame out due to shit happening. Their friendship rises from the ashes of the house that the love triangle burned down.</br>  <br>You could've been creative and go for something like  . Since we were talking about k-drama, makes that reason cancer and your bait will get a lot of bites.</br>  <br> Hayama NTR <br>It isn't? I thought everybody would blow a fuse whenever those Hayama x Yukino/Yui posts come up. <br><br><br>Perhaps he means that the ending will seem foreshadowed to some but an asspull to others? It sounds like he's just stating the common reaction to every romcom ending in my honest opinion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they can't be together because reasons <br>wait for me end? that's one of the worse endings <br>WW won't do that I believe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hey I'm not shitposting. That's really what I think is going to happen, even as a Yukinofag.</br></br>  <br>Irohasu~ happened</br>  <br>If you were an author would you give straight answers or would you troll and give completely vague answers while feeling smart about yourself?</br>  <br><br>"Wait for me" suggests they make some sort of commitment to reunite. I think their romance will never even really take off outside of a general exchange of feelings because by then they'll know they're on different trajectories. So it's just sad. But they'll remain friends and their romantic feelings will dissipate with time.</br></br>  <br><br><br>To be fair that isn't all that unlikely, Yukino's position is still pretty unclear for the most part. While a lot of flags point to her, the idea that they might not actually be able to enter a relationship isn't exactly all that out of left field.</br></br></br>   final episode aired <br> one week later, 24/7 threads are still a thing <br>Why.</br></br>    <br><br>They're slowing down, give it another week and we'll just have once a week threads.</br></br>  So what exactly is she trying to do again?<br><br>Seems like she's just going after any guy other girls are interested in</br></br>  <br>We're dying, we have maybe 2-3 more threads left at best</br>  <br>You can never get off Mr. Watari's Wild Ride.</br>  Yukino and Yui are not good love interests. Both of them have a gigantic overlap in current issues, and are of similar levels of romantic interest to 8man, but the way 8man sees them is rather different: 8man admires Yukino, and looks down on/distances himself from Yui. As 8man gets to know them both as people, his image of them each will normalize- for Yui this means his image of her will improve, for Yukino this means he'll take her off a pedestal and accept she's not what he thought she was. As a result, Yui will probably overtake Yukino next volume, the fact she already has brute forced some progress between them only reinforces that.<br><br>However, there's also the fact that a great deal of Yui's progress with 8man has been on the basis of him tolerating her.The hair grooming for example was very clear on this aspect. There's the possibility 8man may give her a cold shower when he realizes it's not genuine to humor her advances while being noncommittal himself.<br><br>That said, they're both awful love interests from a narrative standpoint. The Yukino/Yui situation is a very detrimental in that beyond which makes somewhat more sense developmentally, neither romance means very much to the narrative. 8man loving (or, even worse, 'realizing' he's in love with) them doesn't contribute anything significant to the narrative, while spitting on the fact that the entirety of the story has revolved around the club becoming closer as friends. (Particularly the relationship between Yukino and Yui, which people often disregard despite being as important if not moreso as 8man's relationship with either.) No matter how you look at it, you can't write one of the club members into being a third wheel without it contradicting the central premise of the story.<br><br>Practically anything would be better than a club member romance end. This is an opinion I (and many others) have held since the beginning, and the latest novels only reinforce it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fill the void left by no new episodes</br>  <br> she gave Hayama chocolate that had her saliva and 8man's saliva mixed in </br>  These threads were better during season 1, now it's just about pairings and character's feelings. Shit's annoying.  <br>Literal autism, "god I hope he's not actually this retarded" edition.</br>   Oregiaru like ending could mean anything <br><br>The series is about you thinking you understand about something but then that image gets shattered<br><br> You think we get friendship end but a girl actually win <br> You think Yukino is going to win because main girl but she wont <br> You think Yui has caught up to Yukino in Vol 11 but as it turns out she was never in the race to begin with (Yuki would always win) <br> You'd think Iroha given her relationship with the MC can win but in the end she was just a ship tease <br> You''d think Sensei would never end up withsomeone but she wins the Sensei Contest and forces Hachiman to marry her <br> You'd think Komachi would be able to enter Sobu after getting excellent luck but she fails because even Komachi needs to suffer <br> You'd think Hayama was after haruno but the real Y he was after was Yuimom the milf </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let's vote<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4806717</br></br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is the worst girl.  8man,born in 8/8/98.<br>8 months and 8 days later, Iroha is born.</br>  <br> You think Haruno isn't going to win because she isn't genuine, but she will because she is genuinely evil. </br>  <br>I R O H A<br>R<br>O<br>H<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many polls do we need to prove that Iro- never mind.<br>Carry on.</br></br>  <br> Or maybe it was to showcase the source of possible bias? <br>So he wanted to add pretense to his post, another thing that has no place on this board.<br><br>Xfaggotry is cancer, the fact you're falling back on 'culture' as if it's supposed to be an excuse is evidence enough of that. Not every single anime discussed on this board is one of your trashy harems, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 8man admires Yukino <br>this ended since vol6 when 8man realized Yukino lies too, and saw her as an equal after that, not to mention since genuine and water ride scene Yukino has been depending and looking up to 8man more than he has, and he notices this.<br> No matter how you look at it, you can't write one of the club members into being a third wheel without it contradicting the central premise of the story. <br>Isn't the central premise of the story to be geniuine with your friends and not hide anything? Having all three of them ignore their feelings wouldn't make for a genuine ending at all, and even when one girl does get hurt she still has to genuinely accept it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Literal autism <br>Welcome to /a/, where people actually try to talk about anime.</br></br>  <br>(I know you're just funposting but man, interesting thought experiment with this)<br><br>If YYfags actually put thought into the question, I guarantee you that they won't actually vote for their waifus, the obvious implication being that they aren't "after" Iroha.<br><br>Yet at the same time that provides your typical statistics-tier "evidence" that they are far behind her because nobody votes for them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same thing she did at the marathon, probably went to give Hayama the chocolates so that Miura would be motivated to do so. Note the shape of the chocolates.</br>  <br>Only correct answer is Orimoto. The rest are above Iroha, and the poll is based on a false premise.</br>  <br>Gentlemen, I'd like to present you what is colloquially referred to as an "asshole". Though in this case it is a rare variation of the species that seems to be longing for some sort of acceptance among society, but does so in a misguided way by believing that acting like a jackass will make people like him. A sad, and pathetic way to live ones life, but one we must accept and occasionally laugh at.<br><br>So please everybody, ignore this sad sack of flesh and carry on with your day. Thank you.</br></br></br>  genuine doesn't even look like a word to me anymore  <br>irohafags kept being the top in polls so i think this helps in knowing what girl do irohafags favor after iroha<br><br>imouto or death</br></br></br>  <br>Point, and it is EUrohafag time right now anyway.</br>  <br>Volume 11 implied that he never entirely let go of that illusion though, just like the Yui "nice girl" image.<br><br>I guess he may have been doing a roundabout sort of comparison between his past mistakes and what Yui and Yukino were about to do though. In that case it doesn't look very good for Yui.<br><br> Isn't the central premise of the story to be geniuine with your friends and not hide anything? Having all three of them ignore their feelings wouldn't make for a genuine ending at all, and even when one girl does get hurt she still has to genuinely accept it. <br>You speak as though 8man going for one of them romantically is a requirement of the writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's always an adjective in English but gets treated like a noun all the time in these threads. That annoys me. People need to say 'genuineness' more often.</br></br>  <br>Unfortunately anon, I am afraid your conclusion is incorrect in this case. I direct you to the results of this surprisingly unproxied poll http://strawpoll.me/4798763/r<br><br>It is clear that, without a doubt, that your belief is false and Iroha is the "best girl". Thus the current poll is built upon a legitimate premise.</br></br></br>  <br> komachi ahead because Iroha is not an option. <br>This ship has the best taste.</br></br>  <br> EUrohafag <br> EU about to sleep <br>Irohafags are already established Murrikans which is why when Murikka is asleep there are more YYfags posting</br></br></br>  <br>A shitposter who defends labels on an anonymous board trying to collectively appeal to the board? Sounds about right.<br><br>I want summer to leave.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Humorously enough the exact opposite sentiment has been expressed plenty of times in these threads.<br><br>Irohafags complain that when their girl starts getting hated on, it means the Americans are waking up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see that you still like Iroha, satan.</br>  <br>It's 8PM in the UTC+1 zone right now. If anyone's going to sleep it's sure as hell not the kind of people who spend there time in general threads on 4chan.</br>  <br>Nah. EU, AUS/Asia are Irohafags to the core.<br>The complaints about US waking up are mostly from Irohafags.</br></br>  <br>I'm in burgerland in the Iroha posts tend to pop up during the periods of 1 AM to like 5 AM in the morning. So I can conclude that you're full of shit anon.<br><br> Though I'm an Irohafag myself, but then again I hate living in America so that might have something to do with it. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't you ever lump me in Irohafags. I'll fight you bitch.<br><br>In my humble experience, Irohafags are at their most vile really late at night, like past midnight US CST. Then when I come home for lunch from work and check the thread around 11:30 AM or so there are always complaints about how Americans are waking up and Irohafags are getting shit on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Snap, I forgot that Haruno exists. <br>Let's assume that she has one vote from that single Haruno-fag in these threads.</br></br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>I'm in America too.<br>Have you seen the last thread. <br>It was YY for a good majority during the night.<br>There is no conclusive evidence that a majority of fans are in any one region.<br>But what I can say is that Iroha's legion is everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br>  No, seriously, the the heck is she doing  <br>Totsuka has already won the 8bowl</br>  I don't really think what continent you're from decides whether you're an Irohafag or not. I'm European and I can't stand Irohafags. Not because I'm European, but because they're obnoxious as fuck.  <br><br>Yeah it's not really about which region prefers which girl the most as much as where the loudest and most obnoxious posters come from for each girl. Which is basically random.<br><br>It seems like the worst most unhinged Irohafags are from the side of the globe opposite the US judging by their posting times. Other girls may have their most noxious supporters in the US or elsewhere. I noticed also in the last thread the pattern that has gone for weeks got broken to some extent. That may be a sign of people leaving the thread since it's gradually dying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We love you too.</br>  <br>Flirting with the biggest alpha<br>8man is the backup because he isn't a big enough alpha</br></br>  <br>Yeah, nights used to be Iroha time, now it's day.(here in EST)<br>Weird how time flies.</br></br>  <br>Like the Yahari fanbase in general isn't obnoxious. Seriously, weren't you here when the Yuifags when on a week long retard session for that one episode? <br><br>Then there was the silly spoon threads from the Irohafags. <br><br>And Yukinofags are kind of self-explanatory. <br><br>Then the Sakifags suddenly got a pole shoved through their ass and started being assholes out of nowhere.<br><br>Basically what I'm saying is that there isn't a point in singling out just the Irohafags. The whole fanbase is cancerous when the anime season is here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Continent doesn't correlate with preference, but it does correlate to posting quality.<br><br>I've seen productive discussions in relation to every girl at night, most of them are going to naturally revolve around the club simply because Iroha has much less content to discuss.<br><br>Peak hours however are nothing but /v/-tier fanbase wars.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Irohatime is all day long</br>  <br>Yuifags aren't that bad, heck, I'd say that Yui, Sensei and Sakifags are probably the best.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.   reach this scene <br> Go to MAL and remove Yukino from my favorites <br><br>What have they done to her?</br></br></br>  This is the only reason why I'm still here. So maybe I can see the anon who made this again.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>You came to the realization that you've never actually understood Yukino.</br>  <br>it's just a joke</br>    Why does Iroha add so many -su to her words?  <br> MAL <br>opinion discarded</br></br>    <br>I'd say they were fine for the most part, but that one week they really took it to the newest low. My opinion of them really dropped after that. <br><br>Senseifags barely post anymore, but when they did after that bridge scene they acted extremely obnoxious despite the fact that was literally her only scene.<br><br>Sakifags used to just act depressed, but their recent posts have been kind of dickish and needlessly arrogant. Usually bashing the Irohafags for supporting an "irrelevant" character, obviously they are lacking a mirror in their households. <br><br>Irohafags for the most part just post fanart and gush about their girl. The only time they are really obnoxious are when they fall for the bait. Which happens really fucking often.<br><br>So personally I place Yuifags and Irohafags at the top, while the rest follow in varying degrees of overall shitty behavior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's beta.</br>  <br>Yuifag have plenty of cancerous posters, the most known ones being the denialfag and the proxyfag.<br><br>Every fanbase is rotten, no exception.</br></br></br>  <br>いろはす～</br>  Can someone summarize these last threads?<br>I don't know how you can keep going, generals suck the fun out of everything.</br>  <br>The proxyfag isn't so much a cancer as a meme at this point. For one he was probably the one posting most of those polls, and for another he probably isn't even a Yuifag.<br><br>also<br> two examples <br> plenty </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you will never go with Orimoto to Saize <br> tfwnf <br><br>Why live?</br></br></br></br>  <br> memes <br> shitposting <br> denialfags <br> Yui/Iroha fanart </br></br></br></br>  <br> the most known ones <br>Are you expecting me to know who is who at an anonymous board?</br></br>  <br>Same reason Yukino always adds -shira to her questions.</br>   arguing about which fanbases are more cancerous <br>do you faggots not see the irony?</br>  <br>Irohasu~</br>  <br>You forgot posting pan-san while the mods are asleep.</br>  Miss her already.  THK gave me PTSD with deredere fags, everytime I see a post shitting on another girl I can't help but think it's a yuifag behind the post  <br>I guess you could also count the fanfic/yandere guys.</br>  So for a retard like myself,what was the solution that Yui was talking about?  <br> what happened <br>Nothing. She was great then, and she is great now.<br><br>I just hope Yui or Iroha wins, because Yukino makes fun of 8man as much as Orimoto laughs at him. Taiwanese batman deserves better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui <br> deredere </br></br>  <br>Fanfic is only cancer if it gets spammed or you hate fun. I can't see the slightest thing wrong with Yandere Yui either unless you again fall into the "I hate fun" category.</br>  <br>I would post the analysis some anon wrote if I wasn't on mobile</br>  Komachi is a good girl. I don't have any romantic feelings for her but she soothes my soul.  How the fuck am I supposed to get invested in a love triangle when the end result feels so obvious?<br>At least it isn't as bad as your regular LN romance garbage where either every girl is a one-note crazy jealous bitch or the author takes a dump on everyone else with a chance's characterization to make them seem less appealing than Designated Main Girl, but actually being able to like the characters just makes the waiting for the inevitable feel even more pointless.<br>Why is it so difficult to write your story without giving in to the temptation to jerk off over your obvious favorite?</br></br>  <br>8man please stay.<br> Are you going for the friendship end? </br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that Yukimura won.<br><br>Anyone can win never give up hope.</br></br></br></br>  <br> MAL  <br><br>Don't you have some middle school homework to finish before mommy let's you shitpost on 4chan?</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuga Yukinofag.</br>  <br>Yukimura will be dropped pretty quickly in the last volume, sorry.<br>It's pretty obvious considering how the writer treat her</br></br>  I think we can all agree that Totsuka &gt; Komachi = Iroha &gt; Rumi &gt; Yui = Sensei &gt; Orimoto &gt; Saki &gt; Miura &gt; Ebina &gt; Yukino = Haruno  <br>Do you really think it's that obvious Yukino will win? I mean I've been a Yukinofag and I don't think she has a 100% chance of winning, in fact WW has even been writing it so Yui still has a good chance to win.<br><br>I can't tell if you're baiting or not.</br></br></br>  So which did you guys prefer?<br><br>S1 Edgelord hachiman or S2 dark and mysterious Hikky?</br></br>  <br><br>Yukimura turned into absolute shit after she "won"</br></br>  Why is Yukino so linkin park?  <br>Dark Accelerator</br>  <br>It's actually unrealistic that 8man is holding out in showing his preference for a girl, he would have made it a lot more obvious if one girl is actually winning.</br>  <br>I prefer the Senpai~! 8man</br>  <br>How can you put rumi ahead of Yui and Yukio behind and still be expected to be taken seriously?</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br> Commie </br>  <br>because of muh loli</br>  <br>S2 /fit/ delinquent Hachiman &gt; S1 memelord twink Hachiman</br>  <br>The end result isn't obvious at all. The exact problem with the love triangle is that the end isn't obvious. If 8man had a clear interest in one over the other things would actually interesting.<br><br>Well, the obvious end would be neither, but for most people the idea of a main heroine they like not getting a romantic end is unthinkable.</br></br></br>  <br>Best 8man is dere 8man.</br>  <br>What do you cool people use instead of MAL?</br>  <br><br>S2 Animation looked better to me</br></br>  These threads made me watch WA2. Finished it today.<br><br>Hold me, /a/.</br></br>  Not just Yukino, but 8man also got kinda defanged. Mind you, he's still a lot less autistic than her.  <br><br>They made him hotter as more girls got interested in him.<br><br>By the end of the series he'll be putting Hayato to shame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Rumi is more like 8man than Yukino, and doesn't have massive amounts of baggage.<br><br>Stop equating physical appearance to character.</br></br></br>  <br>S2 8man looks like he can realistically have a harem of 9+/10 girls</br>  Soon?  <br>Did you play White Album 1 yet</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?t=15&amp;<wbr>v=N0YoUh0SjWc</wbr>  [ ] This song has so many memories, thank you for the nice times anons.<br>Where is my legion?</br>  <br>Yet. Rumi is definitely the representation of a younger Yukino and Hachiman. However, Hachiman saved her and gave her a second chance at a life without being bullied.</br>  <br>God I want to FUCK HER SO HARD.</br>  <br>Ye</br>  <br>This. 8man as he is right now is not only incapable of accepting any girls love besides totsuka and komachis, but unwilling to do so. His still-rotten personality that he's aware of makes it so any relationship he starts with the girls will likely blow up. Unless 8man goes through some personality changes his loner personality will undermine all his romantic relationships.</br>  <br>Feel's 8man is the sexiest male protagonist since Araragi.</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  <br>I thought she was a representation of Yukino's and 8man's future daughter</br>  <br>Dude she's like 10 years old</br>  <br>It also doesn't help that, before Haruno kicked their collective asses with: "I thought you guys were better than this, is this truly genuine?", Hachiman was trying to be more like Hayato.</br>  <br>I'm here.</br>  <br>Age is just a number</br>  <br> eiii </br>  <br>Every time I see this I wonder how this came into existence.

Dude is king.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Everywhere<br>Irohasu~</br></br>  <br>That also works, I guess.</br>  <br>I could hear her voice when I read that.</br>    <br>We put it in a notepad for future reference or if we want to remember an anima we watched, and we don't feel the need to put it on a public account to show the world how special snowflake our tastes are.</br>  <br> they are friends so there won't be drama  <br>That literally makes no sense</br></br>  <br>Normie please go.</br>  <br>Yukino was alone as a younger because she stood out so much it provoked jealousy.<br><br>Rumi's just a loner.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who wants a non irohasu end at this point has a confirmed shit taste.</br>  Hayato spin-off when?  <br><br>Besides the first girl flag she seems to rising all the others. I bet Iroha mastered all Tokimeki Memorial games.</br></br>  Rumi &gt; Yukinon &gt; Christmas Cake<br><br>It's her destiny</br></br>  <br>Is Araragi standing on a stepladder in that image?</br>  <br>You can't really call it winning when someone else is on his mind.</br>   yahallo!   <br>I don't get why anyone would compare Iroha to Yukimura when Chihiro is a much better comparison.</br>  <br>I didn't say they were the exact same people who lead the exact same lives and had the exact same reasons for being loners. I'm saying that Rumi represents what they had to go through in life, being bullied, albeit for different reasons.</br>    Well then.  Ok.  This is nice<br> thanks</br>  When the Rin episode happens this board will implode.  This is arousing.  <br>8 minutes of ecchi power<br><br>Besides that i think i can really dig this show</br></br></br>  subs when  <br>That's all they need to promote the manga.<br><br>This is obviously designed to sell you on the manga. Which failed because I was buying the manga before the anime started.</br></br></br>    did they other thread die ?  <br>Sank last I saw</br>  <br>awe i made a friend in that thread</br>  So is this a proper series or is it one of those advertisement 8-minute trash?<br><br>Should I just read the source material?</br></br>  <br>Maybe you'll meet each other again in the near future, Anon</br>  <br>It is advertisement 8 minute trash, the character designs are better and the manga-ka was a former hentai artist.</br>   Okusama ga Seito Kaichou! 01 @ Edit / TS / Still Fapping <br>DDY please stop fapping</br>  <br> the manga-ka was a former hentai artist. <br>Picked up.</br></br>  <br>I thought she's an ara ara old hag, but then I read the synopsis.</br>  <br>They've really been going at it. They'll get rug burn on their dick if they keep going</br>  this is already happening in the first episode?<br><br>picked up</br></br>  <br>It is basically the same as the original manga.</br>  <br>Since the whole marriage thing seems a bit ridiculous from the start I can also have ridiculous hope that Rin will win right? Or at least a 3-way end? <br><br>r-right?</br></br></br>  <br>Which studio is this ?</br>  <br>Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced. At least in the newer chapters Hayato is aware of how cute, sexy, nice, and kind she is. She also has a good friendship and rivalry going on with Ui, where they help each other while trying to one up each other.<br><br>With that said, the manga is called "My Wife is Student Council President" not my "My Wife is the head of the Discipline Committee." So unless Nakata Yumi throws a huge ass curveball and Rin gets elected Student Council president, Rin will not win.</br></br></br>  <br> So unless Nakata Yumi throws a huge ass curveball and Rin gets elected Student Council president <br>Oh fuck that's hilarious. I could see an election arc as the finale  with the MC winning at the very end as tweest. </br></br>   The manga is over 1000 pages of cute high school wife shenanigans  <br>God bless Japan and how hard they cater to my dick.</br>  <br>What's he doing?</br>  <br><br>She got bit by a snake and he's sucking out the poison</br></br>  <br>Checking for lumps. Breast cancer isn't a fucking joke man.</br>  <br>Well, if they did that, it would be open ending where no one wins. It would actually be kind of funny because Hayato does the cooking, cleaning, and general housework, so he is actually kind of the wife in the relationship with Ui.<br><br> Though it wouldn't work with Rin since she is the one cooking and cleaning after her sister. Though she admits that Hayato is better than her in some ways <br><br><br>Sorry to disappoint you, but Rin becomes a main character and cockblocks Ui with a ton of her own fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it would be open ending where no one wins <br>It could go both ways. Where he actually chooses one after he wins.</br></br>  <br>that looks way the fuck cuter than OP. Need to read this now for sure.</br>  <br>After being around Rin a lot he starts developing a huge attraction to big boobs. He also starts noticing her other qualities and that she isn't just a walking pair of big tits.<br><br>Which makes Rin like him more since behind his ogling, he actually cares about her.</br></br></br>  god if rin doesn't win i will kill myself<br>either that or her older sister</br>  <br>You know what? Good for this guy. It's rare we get a protag willing to suck on some available tits right out the gate.</br>  Picked up.  nigger the fuck aren't there subs yet<br>what is this shit</br>  <br>I was going to pick this up just based on the premise and initial synopsis, but this is a whole new level of adorable lewdness. Forget just picking this up, I might fucking BUY it.<br><br> captcha asks to select all images with cakes <br> itt </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for DDY if you don't want the streamrips that'll inevitably go up, though of course DDY doesn't have a translator assigned to this, it'll be a stream script edit with typesetting. RAWs are already up, so give it a day or two for them to work shit out and put their release out.</br>   all these people who aren't reading the manga <br>source material is usually always best so don't ignore it</br>  <br>Anon, I can't bury you over the internet.</br>  It's so sad that the one anime I've actually read the manga for before it's aired is a fucking ecchi.  <br>I can't wait for minamoto-kun monogatari good god that will be glorious</br>  <br>Looks like Rin has more fans than I thought. Here I expected to be the outlier. Like many, I started because of the antics of Ui and Hayato. When Rin appeared, I didn't like her, but after 40 chapters she is the only reason I still read the manga.</br>  <br> It's so sad <br><br>It's a nice thing to me.</br></br></br>  <br>That's getting an anime? Fuck me it's gonna need like a dozen seasons to cover that shit. Shit moves so fucking slowly.</br>  <br>Nigger, they've TL'd it already. <br><br><br><br>I've got one hand refreshing their website and the other lightly stroking my dick to keep it at half mast, waiting for the subs to come out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it doesn't have one yet. But I don't think it will be too long before it gets one</br>  <br> streamrips <br>It's one step short of uncensored hentai, neither CR nor Funi will have the balls to touch it. Only fansubs can save this show.</br></br>  <br>What is sad is that the crappy anime art doesn't touch the awesome manga art. Also, it is a 10 minute anime so it is clearly aimed to sell more manga, which is good side the manga sells poorly for such a good manga (in Japan)<br><br>The manga was close to getting cancelled, so this is nice.</br></br></br>  <br> 10 minute anime <br>fuck this shit<br>im out</br></br></br>  <br><br>newshit central</br></br>  <br>The manga is just so much better anyways.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is not allowed on this board...</br>  <br>no nipples are visible faggot<br>areola don't count</br></br>  <br><br>It's 8 minutes.</br></br>  <br>the hype is dead</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127469355 <br>Okay, but one of their TLCs could have just agreed to TL it.<br>Fansubbing isn't some sort of professional job -- things can and do change at a whim all the time.<br><br>This is how the conversation likely went:<br>"Okay so a simulcast still isn't up. X guy on TLC, wanna translate it?"<br>"Let me watch the show and see if I want to do it."<br>Time passes.<br>"Yeah alright, I'll do it."<br><br>Bam, done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need more of this</br>  <br>I stand corrected but was late in scrubbing my post.

My boner is now having a boner.</br>  Isn't this the first episode!?<br>What the hell.</br>  <br>Consider suicide.</br>  This seems like the kind of anime I don't need subs for  <br>My dad plans to watch this on the assumption that it will be a lighthearted comedy just like I Can't Understand What My Husband Is Saying.<br><br>I didn't have the heart to tell him otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>There's Wakako-zake for that.</br>  <br>He knows exactly what it is, he just doesn't want you to look down on him</br>  <br>Since when young boys don't like sucking their gfs tits?</br>  <br> My dad <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>The anime looks good stop shitposting.</br>  Subs when?  <br>Who is Jon Stewart, WHO is he? who knows him? not even his mother knows who he is</br>  <br><br>Fansubbing has been a thing since at least... the late 80's. If you were in the anime fansub fandom at that time, let's say 18 years, you'd be 45 years old today. If you had kids when you were in your late twenties, your kids would be 18+ today.</br></br>  <br>What are the odds for /a/, though.<br><br>If his kid was underage that would be a possibility.</br></br></br>  <br> fansubbers <br> having kids <br><br>lel</br></br></br></br>  <br>lel</br>  <br>Some old as fuck scanlators, say the admin of Snoopy Cool do have kids.</br>  <br>If Mori was my dad, things would be different around here.</br>  <br>He's a anime.</br>  <br>n-no bully pls</br>  <br>Do you have kids?</br>  Started reading this a few days ago since some buds of mine were planning on watching this. Pretty standard yet bonerific romcom. Ui (I swear looks like Shinobu from Love Hina) and Misato are cute.<br><br><br><br>I did see nakata yumi's works on sadpanda. was this (http://exhentai.org/g/20217/94a4e5<wbr>fc16/) one an alternative version of the manga before the supposed revamp, a mistagged work, or something else I'm not catching</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough of them are translated.</br>  I feel like this sums up most reactions to this episode.  <br>Hah.<br>No.</br></br>  <br> Would you have kids with me, then </br>  <br> Hah. <br> No. </br></br>  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Mori, how could you break an anon's heart like that.</br>  <br>Just scroll up, you'll see exactly how I did it.</br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why is this so goddamn funny. Holy shit I can't stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry Tyrone we will never see a proper Okusan series animated</br>  I can't believe people honestly prefer Rin to Ui. I'm not saying Rin is all that bad, but Ui is far cuter. Ui also feels like an actual character and not just generic tsundere #7586  <br>What I can't believe is people thinking Rin has any chance of winning only because she's the heroine rival.<br><br> Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced <br><br>Of course, it's a fucking love triangle but in the end she'll lose. Hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ui also feels like an actual character <br>Like an early middleschooler maybe.</br></br>  <br>No wonder she;s into anal</br>  Reminder they will never ever fuck in the manga  <br>Do Japanese women like having fat asses?<br> slim figure <br> cute hair <br> cute face with/without make up <br> THICK FUCKING ASS  <br>I'm already dripping, too bad this doesn't exist unless she has a black parent or something</br></br></br></br></br></br>   subs never   <br>Please, we already know DameDesuYo is pretty bad but translating an 8 minutes show is still a challenge for any subber.</br>    <br>So, you're not going to watch it then?</br>  <br>Will DameDesuYo is actually going to do a timely release for this? <br><br>They still haven't released Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika above episode 6 despite it's a 5 minutes show. Thankfully CR/HS exists for that show.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, they are pretty unreliable in terms of quality so I tend to avoid them but Anime de Wakaru was an editing/typesetting nightmare, which may be the reason why they ended up dropping it.<br><br>In any case, the anime will cover everything that's been scanlated so I guess you could read the manga and watch the raws.</br></br></br>  Where's the lactation  <br>This was actually the first show I watched raw. Felt weird and I barely caught half of what was said but it felt nice to see the start of the new season with everyone else.</br>  <br> dropping it. <br>They've always announced when they've dropped something. So more like permanently stalled.<br>Though it took them 18 months to do that show with the flags, so who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Arata did something similar to 8 girls while the others watched</br>  <br>Picked up. FUCKING PICKED UP.<br><br> j/k I will watch this when the BD is released and only when this is decent enough. </br></br></br>   picked it up thinking it's just a cute, short anime about wife shenanigans <br> he touches her breast <br> that's okay I suppose <br> mfw it escalated to full blown breast sucking <br>I'm not complaining or anything, but god damn that caught me by surprise.<br><br>Off to reading the manga I go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I will watch this when the BD is released <br>Why? It's already uncensored and there won't be any significant increase in quality.</br></br>  <br><br>Far as I know, naika is low priority and only has 2 or 3 people working on it, which explains some things<br><br>They seem to have a full staff for this one, so hoping for the best</br></br></br></br>   http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>707200</wbr> <br>It's real</br>  <br>The Hype Is Real.</br>  the censored broadcast was hilarious  <br> this for nipples sucking </br>  <br>What</br>  <br>censored condoms</br>  <br>Thank you based AT-X.</br>  <br>is this uncensored?</br>  <br>Nope, and it's even hardsubbed.</br>  <br>read the fucking comments on nyaa, that's what they're there for.<br><br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're such a bright guy.</br>  <br>I'm not sure, is it uncensored?<br><br><br>There's always one in every thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a stupid question, a fansubber will never pick the censored stream when an uncensored stream exists.

At least this one was bearable. I quit reading weekly halfway through FMI because it was such a fucking bore and didn't start up again until halfway into Punk Hazard.</br>   Trying to pass over the position to someone who can protect the people. <br> People say they don't care and would rather go under and die before using violence. <br> This country is full of goddamn retards. </br></br>  <br>That feel when Sanji has had about two panels worth of worthwhile pages devoted to him since before the time skip.</br>  <br>That feel when Brooke has had less than Sanji since they found him in Thriller Bark</br>  What the fuck has Dragon been doing all this time? what is he preparing for?  <br>Someone needs to do the supernova edit of this.</br>  <br>Tea party. With all his best buds. They've took five on the whole 'oppressive and evil World Government' thing and have decided to take it seriously easy.</br>  It's been a while since I'm hyped for world building chapters in One Piece.<br><br>Based Issho made it impossible for World Government to cover this shit up unlike Arabasta. Smoker should've done this very same thing back then.</br></br>  <br> Nami <br> Rebecca <br> Koala <br><br>Why are all the girls Robin's bitches?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope he think it was worth taking a magma fist through the chest for</br>  <br>He's only doing it so he can get his way and get the Shichibukai disbanded. This whole arc was probably his keikaku.</br>  <br>Think ;)</br>  <br>I just want a few lore chapters</br>  <br>Well, its not meant to be read weekly, you know.</br>  <br>Cause she can give them fingering no problem</br>  Mangapanda translation was almost incomprehensible.<br><br>So the world government were behind the overthrow of dressrosa?</br></br>  <br> Well, its not meant to be read weekly, you know. </br>  <br>that feel when brook hasn't done anything notable or funny recently for me to even like him</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Its a manga, Jump releases weekly chapter for people like a teaser.</br>  <br>name all chapters were "nothing happened" please</br>  <br>No they're covering it up to show the corruption behind the Shickibukai and to take credit for taking down one of the most notorious pirates out there. Same shit that happened to Crocodile. Dressrosa is literally Alabasta 2.0</br>  <br>you stupid? He said that the world government is aloud doflamingo to do what he wanted with desrosa and to be the biggest broker in the world without actually stopping him. For this he apolagised because the wg is sopposed to stop shit like this.</br>  <br>Exactly. Brook was forgotten as soon as he joined just making a skeleton pun every once and a while.</br>  Remember ponyglyphs? You know, the things that made Robin somewhat valuable and relevant in the series. When are we going to see another one?   this day started on chapter 653 <br> if oda wrote a chapter a week, it would have taken him 140 chapters to tell the story of a single day <br> he doesn't <br> Chapter 653 cas released in january 23th of 2012 <br> this day has been going on for 3 1/2 years. <br>T H E L O N G E S T D A Y<br>H<br>E<br><br>L<br>O<br>N<br>G<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>D<br>A<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After Oda stops circlejerking Luffy for the umpteenth time.</br></br>  <br>We saw one like 10 chapters ago...</br>  <br>What even is your defintion of something happening?

They can read every fucking chapter at any time they want.</br>  <br>This day started on chapter 699 retard</br>  Post yfw GODSOPP gets a 500 million bounty on his head.  <br>I know what you mean</br>  <br>Get over yourself, you have the patience of a child. One Piece has always handled major arcs this way.<br><br> nothing happened  <br>You want a plot twist every chapter?</br></br></br></br>  Be honest /a/, would you fuck a fujitora?    <br>soo.... Dragon is not dumb like Luffy?</br>  Any chinks itt? Does Jesus say ``brother'' or ``brothers''?  <br>Mangastream is one of the best scanlations.</br>  <br>They aren't claiming to have taken him out and they aren't covering anything up; they're doing the opposite.</br>  <br>he doesn't seem to be. He is a monkey D. though so he probably has some quirks</br>  <br>Can't wait for the PC release of Pirate Warriors and the glorious nude mods</br>  <br><br>Niggastream is even worse.</br></br>  <br> niggerstream <br> good <br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I reckon it's all a persona/front to lead the revs, whereas deep down he's a goofball like his father and his son. <br><br>But he's clearly intelligent though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not really, they are a million times better than shitpanda but thats not hard but they still have many translation erros and their fucking nigger language makes me want to tear off my scrotum. Powermanga is the best by far, but sadly slow as fuck and since we are all impatient faggots we could never wait for them to catch up.</br>  <br>He and Kuzan are are on the side of honorable justice. They do what's right, not just follow orders blindly (pardon the pun).</br>  <br>Just wait for Viz translations</br>  <br> Akainu confronts Fujitora <br> Fujitora tells him he did what was right and that he knows Akainu will punish him <br> Akainu says was it worth dying for <br> Fujitora explains he knows what happened between him and Aokiji and that he doesn't kill fellow admirals <br> Akainu magma fists him and tells him he doesn't know shit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cover story has his eyes be super duper kawaii eyes </br>  <br> doflamingo is secretly a bishie <br> Covers his eyes to keep bitches off him similar to senor pink </br></br>  <br>Wasn't Sabo the eldest to begin with?<br><br>Pretty sure Sabo was older than Ace. Wiki tells me so too. That's why he set sail first.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Kuzan is more ambiguous. I don't think he would bow or apologize. <br><br>He still destroyed Ohara, killed his friend Saul, gave Spandam the golden Den Den Mushi, joined the Blackbeard Pirates, etc.</br></br></br>  <br> implying based Fujitora won't just block magma fist with his sword/haki just like Shanks did. </br>  <br>So Akainu is Lawful Evil, Kizaru is Chaotic Neutral, Fujitora is Lawful Good and Kuzan is Lawful Neutral.</br>  <br>Weren't all of the executives captured? Who would the cover story even be about?</br>  <br>Lawful Good? Woah now. Let's not go crazy. Blind dude has only done the things he did this arc for his own personal vendetta against the shichibukai.</br>  <br> joined the Blackbeard Pirates <br>Wait, what? When was this?</br></br>  <br>He epicly trolled you, man.</br>  So what now? Luffy has become the precise thing he did not want to become. A hero, with full media coverage and international notoriety to boot.<br>Are Fujitora and his crew a separatist faction within the world government, or are they moles aiming to change it from within? Are they possibly at odds with the Tenryubito? Goddammit you can't call Luffy a pirate any more, just have Sabo draft him and Fuji into the revolutionary army already.</br>  <br>Except until this chapter where he showed he didn't give a fuck if his boss sees him being humble and prostrating himself to the former king. He knew that this stuff going on was wrong, and the World Govt new the whole time. He's basically admitting the World Govt is fucked up.</br>  <br>People think he joined them but all we know is that him and blackbeard have some sort of relationship because Burgess told blackbeard not to trust Aokiji</br>  <br><br><br> forgot the picture</br></br></br>  <br> revolutionary second in command <br> a man who declared war on the government, punched a Tenryuubito, broke into and out of prison, and invaded Marineford twice <br> a traitorous Shichibukai who betrayed the WG and had temporarily lost his title <br> ex-government scientist arms dealer <br> other pirates and criminals with a total bounty in the billions <br> all allowed to run free to prove a point to the Gorosei <br><br>Akainu is mad as fuck. Plus bowing is humiliating. <br><br>Maybe we'll see Green Bull</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crocodile tears, mang. By admitting blame for this he casts more doubt on the shichibukai. That's what he's after. Undeniably ulterior motives for his actions. He's not a good guy.</br>  <br>Bad, bad typesetting.</br>  <br>I hope we cut to him the very next chapter<br><br><br>I don't think any artist is capable of demonstrating how mad he would actually be<br><br>It would be like that hitler video where gets dubbed except magma and corpses are everywhere</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127482064 <br>Fucking go die on a ditch stupid frogposter</br>  <br>All of Arlong's crew were captured too <br>  its about Monet and Vergo </br></br>  <br> "Weren't Baroque Works captured? Who would the cover story even be about?" <br><br>I need to stop visiting these threads. The number of people who have either read One Piece once or not at all is getting overwhelming</br></br></br>  <br><br>Here's what I never understood - why the fuck didn't Arlong go to ID?</br></br>  <br><br>are there any fishman in ID?<br><br>They probably segregate by species</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jimmy-B went to Impel Down.</br>  <br><br>Ah maybe - Jinbe was, but that would be because of Shichibukai.</br></br>  <br>Except the BW cover story followed Goldenweek, Valentine, and 5. None of which were captured at Little Garden.<br><br>Although  Is probably right.</br></br></br>  Holy shit that ending was amazing<br>How many big shots will be tracking down Luffy and Law now that it's public they took down Doffy?<br>Will Yonkous go after them to talk and form alliances now?</br></br>  <br>Probably send them to the desert hell level. Worst fate for a fish.</br>  <br>Read the fucking manga holy shit. Arlong was imprisoned in ID already and was released when Jinbei became a warlord<br><br>He was probably considered to be of greater importance the first time he was sent there since the Sun Pirates were such a big deal (that and being caught by Borsalino). He's more of a shitter now and his defeat and capture wasn't as significant</br></br></br>  I'm excited for what'll happen to Usopps name. If this is a Alabasta mirror, key individuals will get recognized like Zoro and Luffy were. God Usopp can't just disappear, right? <br><br> Good arc to be an Ussopfag </br></br>  <br><br>He was still a Level 1 or even Level 2 level prisoner though with his bounty and history, just surprising.</br></br>  <br>There has to be more fishman than arlong or jinbe<br><br>I cant remember a single one other than those two in impel down and those were super special circumstances.<br><br> All those prisoners we got to see seems like there would have been a bunch of namless fishman in there<br><br>They didnt seem to have any other races in their either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably just plot. Arlong would not have played along with Luffy's escape game. He only had a 20 million bounty, so he'd be on the first floor with Buggy. Maybe he just slipped out and dove into the ocean during the chaos<br><br>In Jinbe's cover story when he finds the upside down towns, for a second I thought it was Arlong flipping over towns again<br><br><br>Thats true, you'd need an HQ escort to get him from East Blue to ID, and thats probably more trouble than its worth. They didn't even hunt down Morgan when he escaped</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It feels like assistants are drawing the majority of these chapters with all the filler stock reaction faces and purposely slow pacing everywhere.  <br>Usopp can't be recognised or it'll break the liar story dealie he's got going on. His hometown can't ever know that he's a famous pirate and has gone on crazy adventures when he returns.</br>  <br>Yes, and Mr. 2 broke out himself, every agent reunited, and most escaped. Considering this is Doflamingo, something similar could easily happen with one breaking out or Doffy having more men behind the scenes.</br>  <br> implying most fishmen wouldn't simply be executed <br> implying most fishmen aren't shitters that arent worth Impel Down <br> implying Arlong wasn't just barely worth Impel Down even during a time when Fishmen were at their peak of piracy <br> implying several giants weren't imprisoned (and said to be in consideration Dorry and Broggy) in Impel Down <br><br>Jinbei and Fisher were special cases, even Hody only managed to be almost New World level, and it took him overdosing to the point that his life was shortened to a few hours at most.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, God Ussop is a thing that would spread, it would be funny to see if it gets twisted somehow. It would be enough if Kaya and the Usopp pirates became aware of it. That being said another "World Reaction" would be great. Cameos from characters we haven't seen in a while.</br>  <br> filler reaction faces <br> purposely slow pacing <br> "these chapters" <br><br>So is this your first or second arc? Or maybe you read the first couple a few years ago and all at once instead of weekly?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>didnt jimbe ask the wg to release arlong</br>  Since Trebol survived the suicide explosion is it possible that Monet and Vergo also survived?  <br>Well the "From the Decks of the World" cover arc 4 years ago covered most of the old friends, and we saw Crocodile and Bonney after Punk Hazard. We still need to check up on<br> Buggy <br> Akainu in full <br> Kizaru <br> Dragon <br> Moriah <br> Marco and co (?) <br>I feel like this one wil be more about the power players than East Blue people again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> possible <br><br>It's more than likely. Not sure why everyone is surprised about villains living in one piece.</br></br></br>  <br>Because ID isn't the only jail.</br>  <br>If that's really all he cared about he wouldn't have told the marine soldiers to get over there and broadcast it.</br>  <br>lmao my fucking ass off <br>pls be my friend ur so funny :^))</br></br>  <br>It mostly comes with the territory of how complex One Piece has gotten since the New World and possibly down to Oda not having the sufficient time to plan far ahead. As much as I will miss the old formula of isolated arcs like Thriller Bark and Skypiea where he could be as creative as possible, he has an ambitious story to wrap up and wont be doing this forever. <br><br>Grand plot advancement has been the driving force of this arc though and the emotional strength we are used to has been put secondary. He is skilled enough to weave the two together but just hasn't managed it this time. In the past he would have fitted the contents of this chapter into half the pages so it feels deliberate.</br></br></br>   Kouichi Yamadera <br>Holy cashew nut, praise Toei, this is perfect.</br>  <br>He set sail first because he was tired of his living situation. Remember he was still a kid when he attempted to set sail.</br>  <br>I think this chapter was fine. An enormous improvement over the cheering and countdown chapters we got for the past month. The Sabo stuff went too long, but it could be that I just don't like Sabo.<br><br>I disagree with you saying Oda doesn't plan far enough ahead. I think he has too many ideas and his story keeps gettign bigger and bigger, and he's in a position where he can tell every detail the way he wants to. Each element of Dressrosa was good-to-great individually, and there's nothing I think you could convince him to cut, but together the arc gets pretty cluttered and very long. Its worrying to think how long it took to take out a relatively minor villain like Doflamingo when theres still so much established story to get too, plus new stuff and returning characters. These arcs will just get bigger and bigger</br></br></br>  <br>Kaidou will kill them for sure, ending One Piece next year.</br>  <br>really? No one commenting on how that's a new bounty poster?</br>  <br>Yeah, we'll definitely get some reactions from the WG, Revolutionaries (through Sabo I assume), and Kaido (and the underworld?). Maybe Bonney ties into the upcoming events somehow, cause her appearance seemed out of place.</br>  <br>That's old.</br>  Who's the most popular fujo pairing in OP?  <br>You don't know if it's new though.</br>  <br> Explosions <br> Proven on countless occasions to be ineffective <br> Monet <br> Fatal stabbing to the heart <br>Please tell me you people didn't actually think Trebol was dead</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is he smiling?</br>  <br>Its not a bounty, its the same poster than announced their alliance the day this all started</br>  <br><br>People saying "nothing happened" have no understanding of how huge this is</br></br>  <br> Is he smiling? <br>Trebol confirmed for D</br></br>  Now begins the fun part of One Piece: the time between arcs which shows what happens around the world and the story progresses.  <br>they are just shitposters spouting their epic meme phrases</br>  <br>Zoro/Sanji<br>I know because of reasons</br></br>  So, who's going to be the next crew mate?<br><br>I hope it's  Violet  or  Bellamy .</br></br>  Did everyone suddenly forget that we already saw one Doffy's eyes?  <br> Bellamy <br>Ew<br><br> Violet <br> Wanting two Robins in the same crew </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bellamy</br>  <br> implying you can ever have enough Robins </br>  <br>bellamy is a pathetic loser who continued to work under doffy even know he knew doffy thought he was literal garbage. I don't want someone that pathetic on the straw hat crew</br>  We haven't gotten a new Straw Hat member since 2007, it's been almost 9 years since Brook joined<br>What the fuck Oda, Luffy's almost end game and yet he doesn't have nearly a large crew like the Yonkou's</br>  <br><br> Not being hyped as fuck to see how Sanji's group fared with Big mom </br></br>  <br>Are we just gonna ignore that every crewmember has to fill some sort of role? Nobody in all of Dressrosa has any necessity to the strawhats<br>instead what we will get is people becoming part of their faction not unlike what Whitebeard had</br></br>  <br>Good, its like you want the SHs to be full of mooks</br>  <br> Wanting two Robins in the same crew <br><br>Literally yes.<br><br> Operation Bleed Sanji to Death, byt nosebleed commence. </br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Sai will bang this everyday from now on and will make her pregnant with lots of monkey children  <br> What the fuck Oda, Luffy's almost end game and yet he doesn't have nearly a large crew like the Yonkou's <br> Quality over quantity </br></br>  <br>It's extremely obvious Bartolomeo's crew will probably become Luffy's first faction to aid him in obtaining One Piece.<br><br>Then again Luffy has said No spontaneously before with little to no effort.<br><br>DOES Luffy want a fleet even?</br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck, why did anyone tell me that this was a thing?<br><br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004<br><br>Weren't shuesha going to release their own color chapters from the beginning? Whatever happened to that?</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>That's what created the mystery of his other eye in the first place, so no.</br>  <br>well... shit</br>  <br> implying he won't get more allies like barto and the heart pirates <br>Plus vivi is behind him too. In the end he'll have a huge fucking army behind him, I'm almost certain.</br></br>  <br>no in the very second chapter he names the amount of members he wants <br><br>or was it when he first talked to zoro<br><br>I cant remember if it was zoro or coby</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>are you serious?</br>  Manga and Anime Comparisons:<br><br>Punk Hazard:<br>http://imgur.com/a/GIKgR/<br><br>Fisherman Island:<br>http://imgur.com/a/szS6X<br><br>Marineford:<br>http://imgur.com/a/Xvbnt</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br><br>take a look at that "ass" on the left<br><br><br>no wonder doffy went full gay</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the anime Whitebeard gets his mustache brunt instead of his head? What the fuck is this?</br>  <br><br>Lel.</br></br>  <br>Toei should be ashamed of how bad this shit is.</br>  So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now?<br><br>If the Gorosei go over Akainu and ask Luffy to become a Shichibukai to replace Doflamingo's seat, he'll be even more livid, but he won't be able to do shit about it<br><br>And it would be a smart political move if the Gorosei figure out that Luffy is not in collusion with his father to overthrow the World Governement, they could get Monkey D. to join the navy, similar to when Hitler joined the US Navy, and get him back together with his grandfather so they can use him to their advantage and in their eyes hopefully try and bring him over to their side<br><br> but anon, Luffy would never accept being Shichibukai <br><br>He may not have a choice if Fujitora won't let him off Dressrosa without accepting the position first, and Luffy will be in no condition to fight it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  First time until the haki countdown that I've actually fully enjoyed a chapter again  <br> Luffy <br> Schichibukai <br><br>If Fuji doesn't disband it, fuck no. It goes against Luffy's entire philosophy.</br></br></br></br>    <br> So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now? <br><br>hopefully not, it's retarded even for these threads' standards</br></br></br>  <br> if Fujitora won't let him off Dressrosa without accepting the position first <br><br>uuuh... did you forget that fujitora fucking hates the shichibukai title and wants to abolish it? What are you smoking?</br></br></br>   Yes. His father Barrels was a marine officer, and Drake dreamt to become a marine while he was admitting his father. But something happened and his father became a pirate, and used violence even on his own son, he really became a cruel man. Drake believed in his Dad and followed him, he was 19 years old at that time. Yet he, who feared his own father, looked much younger. And then Drake was protected by the marine and became one himself. Despite him being able to make it up to a marine officer, he dropped his career and became a pirate. What did happen to him!? I'm curious what will happen soon!! <br><br>Get hype for X Drake arc.</br></br>  <br>I'll miss him. Hopefully the Dofly crew will get a mini story. Just like the Baroque works and CP9</br>  <br>You mispelled Kaidou arce with X Drake being Law 2.0</br>   The groups the strawhats split up in during punk hazzard was the same as dressrosa. <br>just realized this</br>  <br> So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now? <br>Nobody with a brain no<br> Implying Akainu wouldn't shit fire over this decision <br> Implying the WG would just overlook Luffy's heinous acts against them up till this point <br> Implying Luffy would accept </br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep saying that Scopper Gaban is Kaido?  <br>Probably ZoSan, yeah. <br><br>I need him to fuck me in the ass, right now.<br> I'm going to miss him so much. </br></br></br></br>  <br> +100 chapters of Drake-wanking </br>  <br><br>I didn't know anyone still was.<br><br>It's supposed to all be in the smile Scopper had matching Kaido's original silhoutte's smile isn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Praise Toei <br>Not even once.</br></br>  <br>Because everyone wants Kaido and other characters like the unknown 7th Shichibukai to be characters we met before, as stupid as that sounds</br>  <br><br>Or 100 chapters of mecha Franky fighting Indominus.</br></br>  <br><br> mfw the ship group are the shit members and brook </br></br>  <br> Because everyone wants Kaido and other characters like the unknown 7th Shichibukai to be characters we met before, as stupid as that sounds <br>That does sound stupid, and considering the hype being built around him, who would even qualify to secretly be Kaido without being a huge letdown?</br></br>  <br>and after that<br> 100 chapters of Urouge wanking <br> 100 chapters of Capone Bege wanking </br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4806850  <br>We've seen part of Kaidous face.

And I was thinking of that, but also of one of the color spreads that featured him. But either way, Big Mom's silhouette looks like her, I have no reason to believe Kaido's wont. looks like her.</br></br></br>  <br>Urouge is directly tied to Enel, and KidHawkPoo are after Big Mom. <br><br>Capone is shit though.</br></br></br>  <br> KidHawkPoo are after Big Mom <br>Wait, was this confirmed?</br></br>  <br>yes it's pretty much confirmed when they started sinking yonkou ships</br>  <br> Whatever happened to that? <br>It's in your link.</br></br>  <br> Not knowing that kid is a psychopath that fucks shit up for no reason <br>Sinking ships means nothing m8</br></br>  <br> Sinking ships means nothing <br><br>Apoo kid and Hawkins didn't start an alliance for shits and giggles.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant they are definitely going to be involved because no yonkou let's that slide.<br><br>it's an open declaration of war and if you dont take care of it every snotnosed pirate will think you are weak<br><br>it's like letting someone have your fruitcup in prison</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Cuz they're going after Shanks.

And Fuji just apologized.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part were an admiral and all the marines with him bowed down and asked forgiveness to everyone in Dressrosa, blaming the WG for all these years of suffering and that all that is already going around the world? There is no way this can be silenced at this point.</br>  Will Fujitora be fired from the government?  <br>I would honestly be surprised if Luffy even offered. The chances are literally zero that she would take it after finding out about the family she didn't know she had.</br>  <br>Good luck with that.</br>  <br>No, but maybe there will be some more tension between the govt and marines from now on.</br>  <br><br><br>And you two missed the part where as of right now that is only broadcasted to the three closest islands.

Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.

She wears a skin tight outfit, that's what being a strong female character means.</br>   That sorrowful theme that plays when Ninja Slayer has to put down NeoLobster=san   Why was Nancy drooling? Is she starting to like it?  <br>She's accepted her destiny.</br>  <br>She's actually a faux action girl. But that just makes her scenes funnier.</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br>YEEART!</br>  <br> the doujins write themselves <br> none get written <br>it's sad. do Kancolle and Touhou really deserve all that hype?</br></br></br>  Yukano when  <br>HS gets the mood better for an anime like this/.<br><br>Viewster's subs are more in line with a shitty fansubbed anime in the mid 00's, while HS gets the proper mood of buying a mid-90's official anime VHS.</br></br></br>  Oh, look, a new manga cover.  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07238<br>Viewster's up, sorry I'm late</br></wbr>  Viewster whe--<br><br>Oh thank you</br></br>  <br>Yep, thanks, that's exactly how I was getting the episodes before they were actually up in their list.

This is the comedy of the season</br>  Koki has the tightest pussy and I would kill each and every one of you for a chance to penetrate her.  Ninja Slayer &gt; Nancy &gt; Koki &gt; Boobs  <br>What are we comparing here? Because it's a well-known fact that a girl's personality gets more elaborate the smaller her breasts are, at least in Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br><br>Titty Ninja Slayer when</br></br>  so, is it shit?  <br> more likely than you think </br>  <br>Episode 1 of AgK atleast gave you a setting. Apart from the asian money, I got nothing about the world of Gangsta. Their town might as well be the only on in existence as far as the first ep goes.</br>  So what’s the deal with this series? The manga has been on my backlog for 2 years or more, but I've always avoided it, despite recommendation from other Anons, mainly because it has a female author and looks like a fujobait. Now I decided to give the anime adaptation a go, given that it's done by Manglobe, which did an excellent job with Samumenco. I am a bit shocked, to be honest. The episode was filled to the brim with stereotypes and tropes that one wouldn't expect from a woman author, such as:<br> prostitution <br> rape or at least sexual exploitation <br> powerless women in a patriarchal society <br> men taking away the job of a woman and pretty much oppressing her <br> men forcing a woman to serve them as a secretary <br> constant sexual innuendos <br><br>Seriously, what's up with the author? Does she get off from all the rape and depravity? The rest of the series seems to be relatively alright, with the exception of the typical fujo male MCs: bara bear and another more boyish bara, both super strong, sociopaths, aggressive, violent, yet reliable and secretly kind, especially towards the female MC, which is not only a reformed prostitute (favourite troupe for women) but also appears to be the author self-insert character. I really don't know how to feel about this whole thing. There are some enjoyable bits, but it just screams of fujobait from a perverted rape-loving slut of an author.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   watched 1st episode and enjoyed it <br> think this anime will be about criminals, hookers and gang wars <br> read the first couple chapters of the manga <br><br> demihumans with superpowers <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The episode was filled to the brim with stereotypes and tropes that one wouldn't expect from a woman author, such as: <br>Underage urban westerner detected. Not my fault your only notion of woman writers are SJW trash woman.</br></br>  I think 5 centimeters per second was Shinkai's greatest work and is one of the best romance anime movies of all time.  <br>Have you ever watched the movie? The surfer girl was pining after him and he got a bitch girlfriend, but it was by no means a harem.</br>  Baccano! is a writing disaster and for all its 'muh cast', half of them are the same edgy gangster guy and each character except a handful have like 10 minutes of screentime through 13 episodes. What the fuck was the point of Dallas Genoard and why did we watch his sister look for him? Why did Chane get forced into a romance ending with the villain, whatever the fuck he was supposed to be?  <br>So?<br><br>"refusing to live in the moment" isn't a good reason to be sad.<br><br><br>did you read my post?
