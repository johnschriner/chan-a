[ Would you be okay with your sword being this lewd?<br><br>Also Blade Dance thread.</br></br>   swordsmen <br>ech, no<br>I'm a driller bitch</br></br>  <br>No.<br> Want to sheath my sword <br> It's drenched from lewd juice. </br></br></br>  Claire a shit  inb4 THK.  <br> Post above you <br><br>GG.</br></br></br>  I come to post best girl.  FIANNA VOLUME<br><br>F I A N N A V O L U M E</br></br>  <br> This thread shows up after THK's other thread got deleted <br>Coincidence? I think not. What is this, the third thread he made for the night? I guess settling for a BD thread he can shitpost in will fare better than the two previous tsundere bait threads he made that got deleted.</br></br>  Est &gt; Restia &gt; Claire &gt; Rinslet &gt; Fianna &gt; Ellis  Axes &gt; swords  <br>Spears &gt; Swords &gt; Axes</br>  <br>claire a cute</br>  Chaos Dragon is airing soon. A young boy and young girls are fighting against evil together in a fantasy world. This is very unusual. I've never seen this before in an anime.<br><br>So /a/, how excited are you for the upcoming AOTY, Chaos Dragon?</br></br>  This is supposed to be satire right?<br><br>The Japanese don't actually think their "ONE MIRRION TIMES FOLDED STEEL" is actually impressive do they?<br><br>Also GATES thread I guess</br></br></br></br>  That's it. I'm sick of all this "Masterwork Bastard Sword" bullshit that's going on in this thread right now. Katanas deserve much better than that. Much, much better than that.<br><br>I should know what I'm talking about. I myself commissioned a genuine katana in Japan for 2,400,000 Yen (that's about $20,000) and have been practicing with it for almost 2 years now. I can even cut slabs of solid steel with my katana.<br><br>Japanese smiths spend years working on a single katana and fold it up to a million times to produce the finest blades known to mankind.<br><br>Katanas are thrice as sharp as European swords and thrice as hard for that matter too. Anything a longsword can cut through, a katana can cut through better. I'm pretty sure a katana could easily bisect a knight wearing full plate with a simple vertical slash.<br><br>Ever wonder why medieval Europe never bothered conquering Japan? That's right, they were too scared to fight the disciplined Samurai and their katanas of destruction. Even in World War II, American soldiers targeted the men with the katanas first because their killing power was feared and respected.<br><br>So what am I saying? Katanas are simply the best sword that the world has ever seen, and thus, require better posts in this thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice falseflagging nerd.<br><br>How long did it take you to type that?</br></br></br>  <br>Good one, Anon.</br>  <br>About 5 seconds considering I only had to change the D20 references</br>  <br>They mean any fucking thrusting sword. Rapiers are large thrusting swords. Dress swords came in a lot of sizes(~80-120+ cm), rapiers just came in large and very fucking large. A rapier bears little resemblance to a modern foil or epee.</br>  Did this show turn out to be any good?  <br>She should have been more forceful. Like little boy Roger.</br>  <br>Its good but would have liked it if they included both</br>  <br>Those new versions are cool.</br>  <br> It's <br> not <br> fair. </br></br></br>  <br>What are the rewards for full combos? I'll probably never find out for myself  ;_; </br>  After seeing so many people wank this shit off on here, I decided to give it a try.<br><br>What the fuck? I couldn't make it past episode 36. It's legitimately horrible, I don't even know how I made it this far. Does it get any better? Good enough to even actually watch?</br></br>  overrated shit  <br> 2014+1 <br> not watching Silver Spoon instead <br>Shiggy diggy</br></br></br>  Nope, it is overrated shit.  Which one of these four is the best tactician?  This motherfucker right here.     comparing tacticians in shows full of inconsistencies and asspulls <br>If you look at how each anime describe them, Lelouch is the best tactician, but you don't see him actually coming up with any amazing tactics that are described in the show and make sense.<br>The one who came up with the best tactics that actually made sense is Light, at least in the first half of the series. Archer and Kiritsugu are not great tacticians, they're just characters with a shred of common sense in shows where the other characters are irrational.</br></br>  <br>B-but. Jibuun Wooo!!!!!</br>  <br>Enjoy your loss. I guess I was the better tactician. Can you keep up with me?</br>  What are you hoping for in tomorrows chapter?  <br><br>I saved your comments. I will be on this thread the day when Pernida's identity will be revealed, and I will laugh at you.</br></br>  <br>You don't know what story telling is don't you?</br>  <br>I doubt it.<br>Personally, my favorite SR are Lille Barro and MdM.</br></br>  <br> I saved your comments <br>One's telling you that being called a genius for thinking the obvious question doesn't work that way. The other is saying, who cares because it hasn't been relevant for months.</br></br>  <br>The fact they survived until then kinda shows that Baa, liltotto and Giselle are all popular.<br><br>And that's not surprising since they're among the only good quincys.</br></br></br>   yeah we had oral when you were backstage, I asked him for anal too but Ash said there was no more time   Whoops, I forgot about the livestream again.<br>I blame PM for being two episodes behind.</br>  <br> asking about a dub <br> on /a/ <br/></br></br>  <br> Sorry anon </br>  /u/ is going to have a field day  <br>Don't worry Adamant said they'll probably sub this one first before Tom and Jerry: Pokemon Edition</br>  Super Idol Minase Iori-chan desu~!  My muse.      <br>Does anyone know why tumblr gifs have this effect? Is it done by the site to save bandwidth or the users for hipster cred?</br>  <br>Tumblr has size limits or something so they do it so the gifs look less like crap.</br>   1.5 days <br> 2 volumes <br><br>Before the end, let's do some beginnings.</br></br></br>          <br>That was one of the best chapters of the entire series.<br>Also, Fujita's women are always fantastic.</br></br>  Heaven or hell?  <br>Put on your trip, Lelouch.</br>  <br>Her red eyes are fascinating, too.</br>  kato a cutie  <br>I'm bigger Led Zeppelin fan, but I'd still pick hell here.</br>  <br>The goddess.</br>  Cowship is the best warship  <br><br>Everytime, damn, her summer sprite ias so good.</br></br>  <br>He was just being tsundere.</br>  <br>Those hai hais.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br> meme <br>I don't understand</br></br>  Please read the guide before asking questions<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  Got this several days ago.  Huge muramasa ass  <br>mind posting a couple pages? I'm still on the fence on whether or not I should buy it</br>  <br><br>Out of curiosity, are you married, anon?<br>If so, how does your partner deal with your waifu stuff?</br></br></br>  <br> not being white </br>  Cucked till the very end  <br> implying he wasn't legitimate happy here </br>  Karin wasnt salads mother<br><br>she just <br> Delivered her <br><br>fucking RUSE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> useful stuff <br> wandering round the woods looking for aliens </br></br>  <br>Vegetables did a whole lot worse shit than Sasuke did so him being expected to have darkness still in his heart was expected. He was actually conflicted because his family life clashed with his warrior prince who exterminates worlds persona.<br><br>But that wasn't the point. Sasuke avoids his family for 12 years and comes back for one night when it finally dawns on him that maybe his family needs him once in awhile while he's waiting for the plot to catch up to him. Vegeta was at least involved enough in his son and wife's life that it caused huge problems inside him. Point is, Sasuke having a rough life doesn't excuse him, maybe his job does, but that's another argument entirely</br></br></br>  <br>yes.<br>he probably does it with his dick after he's finished banging the street whores.</br></br>  Doflamingo and the squad is locked up. What's going to be Fuji's status now that he bowed in front of kings and let a shiton of pirates loose.<br>Do you think he will even let the pirates loose?</br>  <br>post more sugar pls</br>  The StrawHeart alliance is ending. The StrawHeart alliance is ending. The StrawHeart alliance is ending. <br><br>How do I cope</br></br>  <br> 3 bellamys <br>Luffy can just one punch him like he did on Jaya,the only reason he didn't was because Bellamy was too fucking pathetic</br></br>  <br>I don't know. Now that I think about it, what DOES Shachi do? Did I miss anything? Maybe I should read again. Dear god. Shame on me for saying I love the Hearts Pirates and not know this. I'm sorry, Law.</br>  <br> The StrawHeart alliance is ending <br>But it's not<br>Law dick sucking will continue for at least 100 other chapters</br></br></br></blockquote>]
