[ ITT: Girls that didn't deserve to lose  What went wrong?  Toe Sucker kept her clothes on.  I could have given you a pretty long list of the problems with the show, but after seeing episode 25 I seem to have forgotten about them.  <br><br>The fanbase</br></br>  The shitposters and hipsters (most shitposters are hipsters shitposting on a popular show, actually)  Nothing.  Really fucking shitty directing  <br>not enough dolphins or rhinos</br>  <br>nothing, it was better than Zero</br>  Archer is CUTE! CUTE!  <br>I want to marry Archer!</br>  <br>Literally nothing went wrong except the shitty fanbase</br>  What went right?  I thought it was decent. Not sure why people shit on it like it's the worst thing ever created.  should have been fate route to flesh out kotomine and girugamesh more<br><br>that's literally it<br><br>good adaptation</br></br></br></br>  wait so like I'm lost by the ending so Shirou still ended up becoming Archer? or was that just Archer's last thoughts and a memory of him on his journey not regretting a single thing?  is /a/ actually full of hipsters  <br><br>All anime fanbases are autistic as fuck.<br><br>Giving a shit about the fanbase is fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Got any more?</br></br>  So. Are you still GAR for Archer? It's been how many years now? 8 I believe.  <br>This.<br>a 5/10 route with a 5/10 adaptation that lead me to irrationally hate it.<br> Heaven's Feel was better </br></br></br>  I was impressed by the first cour but I dropped it on the shitty answer adaption.<br>Does the quality get any better?</br>  There were small things, it was good though. Shitposters are just contrarian for the sake of it.  <br>Last two episodes were beyond amazing.<br><br>LONDON<br>OOOHOHOOHOHOHOHOH<br>N<br>D<br>OOOHOOHOHOHOHOHO<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The split cour kinda fucked up the second half  <br>Would you rather have a full 25 episode anime with a smaller budget?</br>  <br>Bad OST<br>Archer vs Shirou</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know that one in particular found a way to really put themselves out there. It's one case where I think the fanbase of a show and the show itself just kind of go hand in hand and you don't really get one without the other.</br></br>  They didn't adapt Tsukihime.  <br>Why not just stay away from the fucking Fate threads then? Most of the autism is either technical shit, which the ones who are in the fanbase don't mind, or the shitters and naysayers arguing with the elitists, which wouldn't exist if people just didn't act like shit and complain about the stupidest shit like the fucking ground of UBW in one scene.<br><br>Alas, shitposting will never disappear from /a/, so might as well just avoid the threads.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Asking anime fans to stop acting like stupid ignorant fucks for any extended period of time seems like a tall order. In like it's in their nature to act as stupid and predictably as possible to everything. Wouldn't really be the kind of business it is if that weren't the case.</br></br>   mfw El Psy Congroo   <br>El Psy Kongray?</br>  <br> C </br>  <br>El Psy Konaglee?</br>  <br> Draw a girl <br> Call it a boy <br>I'm still mad.</br></br></br>  <br> Congroo </br>  <br> he wouldn't tenderly kiss this boy </br>  <br> That voice <br> That personality <br> That character design <br>Fucking 10/10.

It's just that the person asking was talking about getting it on vita. I do prefer it on handheld though.</br>  <br>Portability. Trophies. A different opening.

I wish I had friends who were into VN's, but sadly that's not the case. All my friends would think I'm fucking weird if I told them I was into this shit.</br>  <br>One. I have no idea how I could explain I play VN's to anyone I know.</br>  <br><br>It's like you don't know several autists who are into the same shit as you.</br></br>  <br>Is that a fleur-de-lis on Rimi's disword?</br>  <br>I don't. All my friends are a bunch of normies. Only a couple have ever watched anime, and only one watches it regularly. And even he doesn't read VN's.</br>  <br>post &gt;yfw when Steins Gate was predicting the EMDrive.</br>  <br>It's a little hard to find people who are into this kind of things when you work in a especially serious environment.</br>  <br>What's the relation of Chaos;Child to Chaos;Head? Why is Seira-Tan on that picture?</br>  <br>It seems like it, you're an interesting Frenchman for spotting it.<br><br>Here is another picture for comparison, seems like you're right.<br><br>Seems like I have been blessed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's the relation of Chaos;Child to Chaos;Head? <br>Chaos;Child is a direct sequel to Chaos;Head Love Chuchu, which is a direct sequel to Chaos;Head.<br> Why is Seira-Tan on that picture? <br>Because that picture is for Chaos;Head Dual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Nips putting unrelevant symbols on everything.</br>  <br>All Di-Swords have some sort of symbol engraved unto it.<br><br>Look at Sena's for example.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, thank you my friendly anon. I might start Chaos;Head VNs on Android as soon as possible, since the anime quite made me interested on it.</br>  <br>...Aquarius?</br>  <br> since the anime quite made me interested on it. <br>You poor soul.<br><br>May you forget everything that you saw, so you can experience it in the true way it was meant to be.<br><br>But seriously, if you know Japanese, why did you start with the anime?<br>Just why?<br><br>I don't think so, the Aquarius looks different.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like the fucking symbol for resistance</br>  <br>It's easier to look at on the Dual picture</br>  <br>Thanks for the image. Do you have any where the swords are clearly visible? The CGs aren't generally the best for that. I'd love to see Taku and Ayase's in particular.<br><br><br>I'm not sure if it's irrelevant. It's a symbol of purity  and Virgin Mary, among other things. . Make of that whatever you want.<br><br>That said, I've been autisming recently about whether there's some hidden layer of symbolism in C;H. I think there's a pretty good case for it, but I need to replay the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In the Dual image above, it reminded me of NOZOMI's logo a bit, but otherwise I'm lost.</br></br>  <br>   and Virgin Mary, among other things <br>Wow, never heard of fleur-de-lis symbolising that too. I always connected it with Joan Of Arc in my mind though.</br></br>  <br>If he's a guy, why he's wearing miko outfit instead of kannushi one? Is his dad into incest traps?</br>  <br>Apperantly  his dad and sister forced him to wear girls clothes when she was little. </br>  <br> His sister liked to dress him as a girl when he was little. </br>  <br>I don't have any official art where their Di-Swords are visible, but doesn't the hilt of Taku's sword not have an eye on it?<br><br>Well, one can play the 2deep4u game until one is sick of it, so I hop you'll have fun in your autism.<br><br> she </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a tradition to lead misfortune away, yes, but he's not a child anymore.</br>  <br> Kurisu in Miko <br><br>I NEED MORE</br></br></br>  <br>My mind and  my dick  is confused about that matter.</br>  <br>What kind of place do you work in, anon?</br>  <br>He is a homosexual male, there is nothing to be confused about.<br><br>Are you a homosexual male?<br>If the answer is yes, I wish you two well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm happy to oblige. She looks beautiful in it.</br>  <br>I work in a court.</br>  <br> He is a homosexual male, there is nothing to be confused about. <br>Which looks, acts and sounds like a girl.</br></br>  <br>Once I rented out two rooms to weebs for two semesters and slept on the couch. Scenes like this were common where I'd play Japanese VNs on the PS3 and explain the gist of the story while one roommate built gunpla (or in this case the Muv Luv Takemikazuchi).</br>  <br>Please don't judge me for my tastes.<br> Do you get it, judge me? </br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's an eye. I thought so, but doesn't it it look more like an arrow?<br><br>And thanks. I know I will.</br></br></br>  <br>Announcements when?<br> Please. <br><br>We went over this so many times, I'm tired of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it looks like an eye, but after digging out this CG here, I know better.</br>  <br>I  do  get it.</br>  <br>I get it, anon.<br><br>Also, why the hell is this thread moving so fucking fast? Are meme OPs really that effective?</br></br></br>    <br><br>It looked like an Imperial Eagle to me for some reason.</br></br>  <br>Japanese wiki says that the original Di-sword designs are based on flowers.</br>  <br>There is no fist on Takumi's Di-Sword though.<br><br>Because now we have actual discussion about hidden symbolic meanings on Di-Swords.<br><br>I can see it, but if it's a Reichsadler, it doesn't have a head.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why flowers?<br><br>And who is what flower?</br></br></br>    <br> it doesn't have a head. <br>I can't quite see if there is even something in the middle because of the light though. It might just be that I'm blind too.</br></br>  <br>You do me a great favour. Though, what the hell is that. Explosion? Radiating light? I've no idea. <br><br><br>Hmm. That's very interesting, though I'm not sure how that translates into shapes like that of Rimi's or Nanami's.<br><br>Also, does that mean I'm correct in thinking that Nanami's got a tulip in the centre of the crossguard?<br><br> googling tulip symbolism <br> see this: http://www.proflowers.com/blog/hist<wbr>ory-and-meaning-of-tulip</wbr> <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know one person most definitely buying it, a bro that may be buying it and another with a very slim chance of buying it. May buy a second copy for someone though.</br>  <br>Incest being perfect love is nothing new.</br>  <br>Why do you have to ruin everything?<br><br><br> Still waiting on that copypasta. </br></br></br></br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>What do?</br></br></br>  <br>Stop having delusions.</br>  <br> KURISTINAAAAAAAAAAAAA </br>  <br> I want to wait for the anime to be honest. I'd like to not spoil people with a copy pasta. You'll get it one day. </br>  <br>I know, it's just kind of hilarious if that's what they had in mind when they put it in the middle of the sword that's a manifestation of her delusions.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Wouldn't that imply that Nana subconsciously craves oniichan's dick?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Took you long enough to realize, isn't it plain obvious, that Nana wants her Onii to love her?</br>  <br>Well duh, of course. But loving your onii is not equal to LOVING your onii.</br>  <br>She wants him to give her a good bang le </br>  <br>She loved her Onii, but started LOVING (as you put it) the man who she thought was her Onii.</br>  <br>Who thought the buying of the fake Di-Sword would have such far reaching consequences?</br>  <br>Okay, that would make sense.<br><br> I WANT DUAL AND I WANT IT NOW </br></br></br>  <br>Moeka a  best.

USA is a direct extension of 5pb. They'd win every time. Blick and Steiner aren't with 5pb either, so the translation would be different.</br>  <br>Settle down, Brohan. There's nothing wrong with liking girls.</br>  <br>They won't do a shitty insider translation, will they?<br>They will hire Steiner again for the job, yes?</br></br>  <br>Blick and Steiner are freelancers, they can be with whoever they want.</br>  <br>If Steiner was going to be on it, he would've probably been contacted by now. And he clearly isn't due to a tweet he made to 5pb.<br><br><br>Right but 5pb isn't as likely to hire them because they're Japs and don't know their western reputation. Japanese people are apprehensive, too, so they'd probably pick their own people like that Italian chick they used to poorly sub the Steins;Gate movie.</br></br></br></br>  So we will finally get all SciADV, but in the most terrible ENGRISH imaginable?<br><br> Despair </br></br>    <br> PQUBE does C;H, Chuchu, R;N, C;C with Steiner and Blick <br> 5bp do all the S;G related shit with   Zakobot or shit inhouse </br></br>  <br>Would not fucking mind. Hell, I could even put up with my husbando's name being misseplt with an R if it meant all other sciADV being uncontaminated.</br>  <br>Sounds fucking awful.<br>Zakobot's a cunt anyway.</br></br>  <br> my husbando <br> husbando <br><br>We went over this already</br></br></br></br>    <br>I ain't some kind of... straighty, alright?</br>  <br>I don't mind Renri and Phenogram's translation to be bad, but I do mind Zero's translation, because it's canon.</br>      C;H looked really interesting to me at first with all the murder stuff, but these characters with all their stupid looking giant fantasy swords really turn me off. Can anyone tell me what the deal is with them?  <br>How about you play the game and find out?</br>  <br>It's all explained and reasonable.<br>Explaining it here would spoil it.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather just know now instead of buying or downloading it.</br>  <br> reasonable <br><br>Hmm.</br></br></br>  <br>S;G looked really interesting to me at first with all the time travel stuff, but these characters with all their stupid looking hacked together gadgets really turn me off. Can anyone tell me what the deal is with them?</br>  So where the fuck was she?  <br><br>auditioning for sao, she got sick of beta kirito</br></br>  <br>Bell is op enough to one shot goliat. She mostlt is not needed.</br>  Out of the dungeon.  <br>oh shit, she left like 2 days before didn't she? I can't believe I forgot that</br>  <br>Freyja also not present i'm dissapointed. It's will be better with proper closure but probably the action and animation takes too much budget for proper ending party or explanation about bells skill.</br>  <br>  implying kirito is not beta </br>  So, can all we agree that vanilla is best flavor?  <br>He can one shot kill goliath level 5 florr boss he is not beta.</br>  <br>I prefer my icecream to be chocolate and mocha flavored.</br>  So it's confirmed in lastest eps that bell stronger than ryuu and mostly at average level 5 adventurer.  S2 when?  But really, is Vanilla actually the best flavor?<br>Or is chocolate objectively superior?</br>  <br>Beru-kun would still get raped by Ryuu and a lot of other adventurers, but he has a nuke for when shit hits the fan.</br>  <br>Vanilla all the way, brother.</br>  <br><br>That sag...</br></br>  <br>Hopefully Never.</br>  <br>What do you mean. Ryuu cannot even scratch goliat let alone killed it. So do 500 people there.</br>   there are people on /a/ RIGHT NOW who wouldn't fuck Hestia <br><br>Explain yourself, homosexuals.</br></br>  <br>500 is over kill. Probably 1 hundred people.</br>  <br><br>It depends whether she is going to be clingy afterwards. She is completely dependent.</br></br>  <br>Not enough source material.</br>  <br>Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag.</br>  <br>Scrap this i missed the ending scenes.</br>  <br> literally 4 to 5 better looking girls in the same show <br> ''hurr everyone should like Hestia'' </br></br>  <br><br>You have 10 seconds to name a single better better than Bestia Hestia.<br><br>That's right, you can't.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They killed Goliath at the 17th floor and went up.</br>  <br>Bell is shit compared to her, she dealt most of the damages with her magic, Bell could charge Argonaut because he was protected, and his allies had done most of the work.</br>  <br>No, have you even seen the anime bell completely obliterated goliath with itd full powered regen still intact. Ryuu cannot even pierce that meat.</br>  <br>Ryuu is merely distractor like the rest of the people there.</br>  <br><br>I don't care about your stupid opinion. I won't even try to state the obvious anymore.</br></br>    <br>Are you stupid. Please watch carefully or try lurking before posting. It's that clear in the anime where the regen try protect the core luckyly bell agi is very high to give a final blow before covered by the regen.</br>  <br><br>I want to fuck Aiz but I feel guilty trying to fuck an autistic girl.</br></br>  <br>Your opinion is stupid and I am not even one of those guys you replied to.</br>  <br>Bell.</br>  <br><br>Bell isn't a woman.</br></br>  <br>No, he's not, your point?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, samefag.</br></br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br>Is okay if you're autistic yourself?</br>  <br>  more than 1 people disagreeing with you, it's must be samefag <br>Nice logic you have there.<br>Newfag pls</br></br></br>  <br>Sure thing bro.</br>  <br>fug</br>  <br>Can't argue with that.</br>  <br>Is there any info what skill bell used against goliath? He make himself pure white or emit light on his entire body.</br>  <br>Argonaut. Now fuck off.</br>  <br>nobody know waht the fuck hapening in this ep</br>  <br>Argonaut cannot make his entire body pure white. It's mostly emit light on his weapon peak if it skill attack or in one of his hand if it's charged firebolt.</br>  Where was the giant skelator?  <br>It's easy. It just mean bell is stronger than any level 4 and mostly stronger than average level 5 adventurer. Espescially in terms of power.</br>  <br>Goliath without full armored regen is in form of skull. The flesh is its shield.</br>  Smelling her armpits in the corner  The sexual tension between these two is unbearable. Can anyone spoil me when will they fuck in the novels?  <br>One brings the toys, the other brings the beer</br>  <br> sexual tension <br><br>They're both straight, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Straights is nonexistent species in the anime world.</br>  <br><br>And one of them is elf, so it doesn't count as straight or homo.</br></br>  https://twitter.com/hegame/status/6<wbr>14474394509799424<br><br>Anime producer, editor, and LN twitter account making bait post about animating Oratoria.</br></br></wbr>  Does anyone have a quoted version of the incantation they were saying in full?  <br>Adhd avatar. ...nice</br>  this shit is so bad it's not even funny<br><br>i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people</br></br>  <br> i'm embarrassed the author wrote this and thought it was good enough to show people <br>You haven't read Zhan Long where the chinese MC university student takes on roughly 20 elite usa special forces and wins by killing most of them and taking the others prisoner for interrogation. The MC even does better in the game. Unlike a lot of other stories, this MC also has a lot of patriotic power leveling activity outside the game.</br></br>  <br> implying you know what the author hasn't explicitly explained </br>  <br>Just like every anime ever right? Fuck off.</br>  Surprised they didn't show Freya either, I still liked the ending but it really needs a sequel.  So how exactly does Argonaut work? Assuming it isn't a chargeable "I win" button  <br>Not really an "I win" attack, but it is basically a charge based on desire to win/time that significantly boosts his attack power, balanced by an extremely long cooldown.<br><br>In terms of adventurer abilities, it's not hugely impressive, but it definitely has utility.</br></br></br>  <br>It is a charge, but not I win.<br><br>The one he used against Argonaut took 3 minutes of charge up time, which for all intents and purposes are too long to be worthwhile in most fights. When he went against the Goliath in volume 8 again, without Ryu and Asufi, they can't do shit against the boss (which is only Level 4 compared to this one) and was actually on the losing side. Argonaut has an insane drawback that is supposed to drain all your stamina, so he is a sitting duck for a while after using it (depending on the charge time).<br><br>It wasn't until Tsubaki (Level 5) came that they could win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one he used against Argonaut <br>The one he used against Goliath***</br></br>  <br> not hugely impressive <br> let him one shot a level 5 area boss just after turning level 2 </br></br>  <br>I thought the point was his first shot did jack shit? <br>And even after the rest of the group did their shit his second shot wasn't enough to finish it. <br><br>Didn't Aiz actually solo a level 5 boss by herself?</br></br></br></br>  <br>His first shot obliterated everything it hit. He just stupidly aimed at the head that quickly regenerated.<br><br>Isn't Aiz level 6 though?</br></br></br>  <br>Ryuu looks like she can solo a normal Goliath herself</br>  <br>Welf did more damage than Bell that fight.<br><br>Ryuu and Asfi were undisputed MVPs there though. <br><br>All Bell did was get the final hit, which in turn let him hog all the glory.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. It didn't one shot the boss. The boss did not die after the hit, and was in the process of regenerating. If Bell wasn't quick thinking while everyone was retardedly going "oh no", it would've just come back.<br><br>2. If it was just Bell v. Goliath, or Bell with Welf and Lili v. Goliath, they all would've died. He only had the time to cast due to 2 Level 4's, another Level 2, and a strong magic item (along with every other adventurer on that floor) distracting the Goliath.<br><br>3. Compared to the other, higher level adventurers, it's a very unimpressive power, it's just an attack power boost, and those are a dime a dozen. Lefiya at Level 3 gets to break one of the rules of adventurers and can cast any number of magic spells, albeit with some restrictions. Most other adventurers are hard-capped at 3 spells.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ever played Monster Hunter? Do you know how Great Swords work?<br><br>A full charged greatsword will outdamage weapons a bit above them and can do more damage in one swing. That's the Argonaut ability in a nutshell.<br><br>And Bell still didn't kill Goliath with it, just exposed the magic stone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. In a fight he'd be destroyed by any lvl 3+ adventurer, they have better stats and abilities. His nuke won't do shit since he wouldn't have time to charge it and even if he would, he'd probably never be able to hit them with it.</br>  <br><br>Is DanMachi an accurate depiction of Monster Hunter?</br></br>  <br>It's been already explained in the previous threads.<br><br>The boss has a regeneration ability that's based on its mana. So to kill it, first you have to drain the mana.<br><br>Even though it looked like it was regenerating all the time, at the same time its mana reserves were being depleted.<br><br>At the end when everyone used their strongest skill was when it took the largest hits to its mana pool, Welfs OP sword being the last straw.<br><br>All Bell did was the final blow at a point where the boss couldn't regenerate.<br><br>The crystal scene is anime original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't when she did it, it's how she got to level 6.</br>  <br> fairlyoddparents.webm </br>  <br>Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom.</br>  <br>hestia.dance</br>  I just learned a Light Novel, is actually a Nirmal novel with a picture inserted every couple of pages. It's for writers that never found a Manga artist to team up with them  <br>I can barely imagine Bell defeating a Velocidrome.</br>  I love how these LNs with Gary Stu protagonists always have faggots coming out of the woodworks to defend the Gary Stu in detail, saying that the Gary Stu isn't asspulling, he's taking advantage of established mechanics.<br><br>Meanwhile it's clear to anyone that the Gary Stu is asspulling and the writer makes shit up as he goes.<br><br>Touma, Kirito, ONII-SAMA, Bell-kun, same shit different face</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck is it offline?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d5I<wbr>hpNYy5Dg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Please no. They already ruined one season. If they animate Oratoria too they'll probably find a way to give Hestia more screentime than Ais, on top of ruining all of Ais's scenes and design. Hasn't the author seen the BD sales?</br>  <br> Shoehorn more Hestia into Oratoria <br><br>I don't dislike Hestia, but that would be so completely retarded dear god please no,</br></br></br>  Finished the anime, does the light novel worth reading?<br>Does the anime skip a lot of thing?</br>  <br>They already did it to the main series. What makes you think they won't do it in Oratoria?<br><br>Not to mention they've flat out said that "we don't know how to animate/draw Ais". Why then would they think it would be a good idea for them to animate Oratoria, a series that is entirely focused on Ais? Fucking greedy incompetent cunts.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean someone should "shop" a cumshot on his teeth and add the brazzers logo.</br>  So glad I wasn't turned off by the series title.<br><br>Mmm...Vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Too poor.</br>  <br>No, it's weak only able to destroy the ripped head that has been attacked numerous time. It's uncomparable to bellmore than half body attack.</br>  <br>It did one shot the boss. He already obliterated it but Regen help him survive with few hp because the attack is not focused to the real core because it's hidden.</br>  <br>No, this the longest charge because the limit off and aimed attack. In reality argonout charge is very short even bell never like he charge anything when use it.</br>  <br> implying he is </br>  <br>Yeah you're right. Plot Armor is one hell of a defense.<br><br>Get real dumbass, "Beru-kun" is a piece of pure shit who gets powerups out the ass when his shitty friends lives are on the line. It's like he's pussy mode 24/7 until a big monster comes threatening MUH FRIEZENS</br></br></br>  <br> It did one shot the boss <br> Regen help him survive <br> He survived the attack, therefore he got one shot <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So where the fuck was she? <br>You missed TWO separate anime episodes where it was stated the Loki party was heading up and out from the dungeon. The analogy from elementary school is that your reading comprehension skills need improvement. Reading comprehension used to be taught in elementary school, but with the republican party "no child left behind" act, lots of courses were made much easier by teachers and school administrators in order for their schools to look good with high GPA and high graduation rates. The higher the GP and graduation rate, the bigger your salary is how the NCLB act sums up. <br><br>Due to the NCLB, it's no wonder your comprehension skills are lacking. Such skill training was moved out of elementary school into the high school realm as optional courses for AP students. I grew up in my area, had kids, and saw how those classes were moved in our school system thru the years since NCLB. NCLB was good for the good schools as they made even more money. But almost all other schools became worse because they watered down courses in order to keep their current level of federal funding or gain more funds.<br><br>I apologize to OP if "comprehension" training in school was not the cause of your problem. But I've seen so much comprehension problem between average students of my time period and today's average students and your question fit neatly into those symptoms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> son of mutherfucking Zeus <br>Yeah why the fuck is he so garystu?</br></br>  <br>This os not argonaut but limit off. Argonout charge is very shirt he one shot baby dragon without charging he also one kill 3 minos without passive move. His charging is as shory as he is chanting firebolt.</br>  <br>I'm getting real fucking sick of gay people.<br>Every fucking thread it's "I'm gay and everybody has to know lol"<br>Fucking faggots</br></br></br>  <br>Ryu would slice him up before he could react.<br>Remember how Aiz was destroying him with just a scabbard without even trying?</br></br>  <br> Because she's not vanilla aizcream you filthy hestia-fag. <br><br>Ice cream has been made from human milk. With Hestia's breasts you can make a lot more ice cream than from Aiz. Furthermore, I bet Hestia's milky motherly flavour is a lot better than Aiz's lean flavour. <br><br>As to what ice cream names Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream company would give to ice creams made from Aiz or Hestia's goodness, I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best outfit</br>  <br>Well in anime the regen is still fully intact and full powered. So bell did one shot goliath to the half his body with its regen ability still strong.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>   Zeus is his grandfather <br> I'm so special <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>No, bell is stronger. This charge was not argonout. It's far stronger. Argonout not even need Him stand still and doing passive move. No bell is never charging anything have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br>If only it was just a meme.</br>  I really hope cute MCs become the next big thing.  <br> Damn.. someone should shop a sparkle on his teeth. And then the Crest Toothpaste logo on the bottom. <br><br>It probably has been professionally done in japanese TV ads. Marketing may even insist on Bell having different types of big toothy smiles in various episodes to help the toothpaste marketing. Remember, Attack on Titan had such giant marketing that even bread shaped like titan footprints was marketed. Certainly, cleaning products were marketed due to Levi's cleaning habits.<br><br>It would be unbelievable to not have DanMachi toothpaste. I've already seen lots of toothpaste for everything from Sailor Moon to Totoro to My Little Pony. Franky Cola pepsi is allowed to have 1% alcohol in it to give it that Franky kick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell is still level 1 without argonaut and limit off and bell is not good fighting non monster because of his soft spot furthermore she is woman.</br>  <br> cute MCs <br><br>Oh please.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Bell-kun wasn't even that cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bell and Aiz both drink alcohol (ale?) at Mama's tavern style restaurant, so Bell must be old enough to drink.</br>  <br><br> bell is not good fighting non monster <br><br>The arc that would have taken place after the anime ended is Bell fighting other adventurers. As is the arc after that, he's fairly capable in both though that's after getting even more Aiz training.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He missed the core the real body because he doesn't know but when he knew it he one stab it. It's very large area attack but it's un aimed because the core is hidden.</br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>No, he is fighting it without any intention to kill. Like when he fought the hades head fighter. He doesn't use firebolt because he cannot control the damage and have big casualties</br>  <br> Attack eradicates the entire upper body down to the hips and exposes the gem, including the flesh on the opposite side of the gem from Bell. <br> A significant amount of the gem would've been in the path of Bell's attack <br> "Oh he didn't hit the gem with it" <br><br>Sure thing bro.<br><br>As retarded as that thought is, it's still more proof that Bell didn't one shot the Goliath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's un aimed attack at very large area. It would have been different or one shot f it's more focused or consentrated attack at spesific area or target.</br>  What do you call a girl like this?  <br>He seemed not be pulling any punches during the Apollo duel, same with his big fight with Ishtar. He didn't want civilian casualties/damage, when he was running from Soma's group, but he'd still choose to use it in a pinch even though it cause property damage, and might have killed someone who couldn't flee from the now burning building.</br>  <br> Bell can aim and focus that attack <br> If it was more concentrated it would be more powerful <br> Flat-out making shit up to support your argument <br><br>Sure thing bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My waifu.</br>  <br>Perfect.</br>  <br>Of course he can control it. It's giant swing the core only got the damage from the far left corner attack not in the middke which is more powerful attack. Have you even seen the anime?</br>  <br> seasonal waifu <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>He has soft spot like it's shown also in the latest episode</br>  If someone is interested.<br>Lossless creditless OP - https://mega.nz/#!7E0HTB7D!YC2yufSp<wbr>gylNmf3GrgAhZ7RsETDqoaKih2sJ6TQlBLk<wbr><br>Lossless creditless ED - https://mega.nz/#!KZUEBYZJ!DzahHwgu<wbr>2tq5nncbeFq53xlbWjiWI-QmzBnVmL-QK9E<wbr><br><br>I'm also uploading the first 2 episodes, single file, but it will take at last another 8 hours.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Find me one scene that shows the Goliath "only got the damage from the far left corner attack.<br><br>Find me one line that says "the middke which is more powerful attack".<br><br>Find me anything that says or shows Bell could've focused that attack to do more damage.<br><br>You have the episode, so go get some pictures and quotes that support your argument and come back.<br><br>Otherwise, kindly shut the fuck up with your retarded assumptions and broken english.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone make a stitch of this shot yet? It seemed like a good moment for it IMO, what with the full frontal panty (leotard?) shot and slight underboob.    <br>Thanks bro</br>  <br>waiting a while to say that newfag?</br>  <br>That's a badass elf.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame this beauty is a dyke.<br>Am I the only one upset here?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br><br><br>Now in the sky, above a distant forest,<br>O Infinite stars, scattered across the cloudless night sky,<br>grant my foolish voice the blessing of starfire,<br>and grant your compassion to those who abandon you.<br><br>Bear within thee the light of stardust<br>and destroy my enemy!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>    <br>So wait, I'm reading the manga, and so part of the reason she likes Bell is because she has huge daddy issues. I mean sure she relates to Bell because she was in a similar situation to him, but you can't deny the fact that her Father looks exactly like him as well.</br>  <br>It's a futile effort to discuss any sort of settings with the Brazilian fanfictions in these threads. If Oratoria get announced, we'll be rid of them cause they're all Hestia fags.</br>  <br>I'm slowly beginning to understand this, and I wish someone had told me sooner.</br>  <br><br>It's a shame Aiz is going to lose to these literal goddesses.</br></br>  So guys is Ryu like one of the top fighter or something?<br>She is way too op.</br>  <br>She's Level 4, so she's stronger than most, but not crazy OP like the First-Class Adventurers.</br>  <br><br> Best Girl always loses.</br></br>  <br>Wait are they blood related or something?</br>  <br><br>I just see two of them.</br></br>  Season 2 when?<br><br> They can't end it like that, r-right? </br></br>  <br><br>I would not be surprised if that was revealed at some point, considering that they both lost their parents suddenly, and Aiz is probably just enough older to be able to remember her parents while Bell was probably too young. Also considering that she suppressed her memories until she saw Bell, who reminded her of her Father, It could be that she doesn't have any memories of a younger brother who was separated from her at an early age. It would be pretty fucked up if she was inducted into the Familia that helped murder her parents though.<br><br>That would also be an adequate pretext for Best Girl not winning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering season 1 sold like shit, 2ch hated it, and JC Staff's investors are jumping ship, I think it's safe to say season 2 never.</br></br>  <br><br>Read the thread </br></br>  <br>Damn, it's not a great anime but I've had a lot of fun watching it and want to see where the story goes.</br>  <br>You know that a copypasta troll post right?</br>  <br>So where did you get that info from?</br>  How do Hestia fags feel about their character inevitably losing to Vanilla?  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/i<wbr>nvestors%20jumping%20ship/<br>Just some of the variations.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>Vanilla is probably Bunny's long lost sister though.</br></br>  <br> this fanbase is so obnoxious that they reply to pasta and ask for sauce </br>  <br> This fag replies about fags that reply about pastas <br><br>Come on man.</br></br></br>  <br> 2ch <br>Their opinion is about as relevant as /a/'s when it comes to sales.</br></br>  Is she and the shota the only ones in the guild who like Bete?  <br>She gives furfag his puss allowance, so he has to listen to her</br>  <br>Hestia is working 3 part time jobs for her Bell-kun.

I can go back and pick out screenshots illustrating every single thing I state here.<br><br>He did not one-shot the Goliath. There's no evidence it's some sort of retarded wide-angle bullet or arrow type attack (wide-angle arrows lol). There's no evidence that that particular attack could be focused to target a specific area. There's no evidence that focusing it on a smaller area would increase its damage. There's no evidence that even it it could focus on a smaller area to increase its damage, that it would've killed the Goliath outright.<br><br> If it's a blast or shoot <br><br>I'm glad you used "if", because it shows you're coming to terms with the fact that all of those retarded theories are pure fantasy and not at all what was shown in the episode.<br><br>The only good thing to come of this show ending is retards like you won't pop in to ruin threads with absolutely idiotic theories based off of fanwank and opinion.<br><br>Now, unless you can show up with any sort of proof other than more retarded opinions, please kindly keep your stupid to yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they made him use the dagger just because it was hestia dagger. ive read the LN 3 times and its not there<br><br>https://michinium.wordpress.com/201<wbr>5/03/03/danmachi-volume-2-4-pdfs/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>This post is relevant to you <br> The guy you're responding to is one of those people who thinks the translation is more accurate than the raw. </br></br>  Wish this was longer. <br><br>I'm getting post-anime depression.</br></br>  <br>Man, I'd be pissed too if I missed a fight like that.</br>    <br>same, the summer list is looking bad also</br>    <br><br>The newfags edge.</br></br>    <br>The targeted area mean the focused area. Bell should have attacked or targeted the core location Instead above it if he knew its location and that is its core.</br>  <br>Sure, but how could he have known? Who keeps their gem in their hip area instead of chest or head?<br><br>They blasted the giants head off and that did jack shit, so they blasted his whole upper body off next. Makes sense to me.</br></br></br>  <br>He have fought it once. He will have known it the next time he fought it.</br>  <br> he didnt watch youtube of other people beating him <br><br>fuking noob</br></br></br>  <br>That it's the pattern of the skill in the anime. His hand glow if it's magic or firebolt. His weapon glow usually his peak if it skill attack.</br>  So who is the strongest in the danmschi world and if ranked which ranking would Bell belong to?<br><br>Low tier<br>Mid ter<br>High tier</br></br></br></br>  <br>High tier because he is able to one shot goliath if it's not because he has not known the location of the core.</br>  <br>Mid tier</br>  <br>Boipussy tier</br>  How far bell's level now ? For single minded pursuit user his growth is not quick enough.  So, even with all those high level experienced adventurers there, only Bell could destroy the monster. Why not just suck his dick? Fuck this shitty story.  <br>He has rare skill items and zeus grandson.</br>  <br>So, he's basically a gary stu? I knew it.</br>  <br>Away being Her Goddessly self. Relying on Her "Hero". <br><br>Besides, if She DID join in it wouldn't have even lasted long enough for an entire Episode.</br></br></br>  <br>The ln pacing is quite slow to confirm that.</br>  <br>The problem here is not her chest bat her manshoulder.</br>  <br>Anime did a piss poor job at showing the contribution of the higher level adventurers and even welf crozzo's...<br>IT was a good anime up to the ending where they somehow had to shoehorn bell doing "what seemed like" a one-hit ko followed up by a tap.</br></br>  <br>Even before that Bell was destroying higher level monsters himself.</br>  <br>Nah, him destroying the higher level minotaur had tension and he obviously had extreme difficulty killing it. That was a really good fight wherein he was not gary-stu at all.</br>  <br>It was and it still is. Stop defending shit when it's shit.</br>  <br>Look anon, we share the same dislike of the final episode but you are just raging uncontrollably here if you cant appreciate the minotaur fight for what it is; a well choreographed fight scene of a boy who wanted to be a hero against a foe greater than himself.<br><br>The fight had him getting beat up and be in excruciating pain. Destroy his armor, break his spirit yet even against this odd he stood up and he pondered a thought "how to defeat the minotaur".<br>Up to that point he was being trained by Aiz and learned how to counter attack. He was honing his skills from grinding mobs. He got magic from an old book and he had the blessing of his goddess in form of a really good knife.<br>He accepted that he was a coward and that is good. Not getting hit is better than being stupidly heroic.<br>He knew that every slicing attack he did with the knife was not enough to pierce the minotaur's hide; his firebolts were not enough to put a dent into the minotaur.<br>He had the knowledge from lili that larger weapons are better against larger foes.<br><br>With all these he then put things in motion by:<br>Disarming the minotaur<br>Using it;s own large weapon agaisnt it to create cuts and openings where he can land his knife better,<br>Stage a fake bull rush attack into a counter into the belly of the beast.<br>And with his weak magic, BURST the ever living crap out of the minotaur from inside out.<br><br>It did not matter how much mana he had left, he had to do it at that moment and he did till his mind went numb!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nerf Argonaut</br>  <br>Sucking ma dick</br>  <br>Ottarl has:<br>Boars' Blood- health passively regen<br>Achilles Heel- can't be damaged unless damage at one region<br>Divine Devotion- immunity to all magic damage<br>Goddess' Protege- Self level boost</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's level 2</br>  <br>we dont know when ottar got those skills, how about if he had achilles heel at lvl 2?</br>  <br> comparing end-game skills to a level-2 skill </br>  <br>what if he had those skills at level 4-5? <br>I can speculate too</br></br>  <br>That immunity.

My suspension of disbelief went away when his attack actually manage to hurt the minotaur.</br>  <br>This is weak in comparable.</br>  <br>B-but it's a skill.</br>  <br>Not really OP, they could before boosting themselves to ridiculous levels</br>  <br><br>Unless your Spartacus with EX level in endurance</br></br>  Can we all agree that the Hestiafag producer ruined most of the show  Riveria Ljos Alf <br>Rea Laevateinn : Wide area annihilation Magic<br>Wynn Fimbulvetr: Extreme cold Magic that is said to be able to even freeze time <br>Veil Breath :Green Protection Magic that raises defense against physical and magical attacks<br>Via Shilheim : Barrier Magic that completely blocks physical and magical attacks <br><br>so she has magic that makes her immune to physical and magical attacks<br><br>not that she is a going to judge your shit skills or anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rises strength after takes damage losing sanity and taking damage mean less hp.

Unless you think that Bell is a half god, it isn't unique to them.</br></br>  <br>Block mean you still receiving damage.</br>  <br>how come the other elves dont have it then?</br>  <br>Because when they can have those skills doesn't mean they will have those skills. Maybe there are other broken skills that other elves have.</br>  <br>He was never described as similar to him and she never thought that, it's only manga readers forcing that idea. She thinks of her dad and mom because their death/disappearance changed her world, not because Bell looks like him. Bell reminds her of her younger self.</br>  <br>Bell is level 2 and level 3 in the last volume so mid tier. Ottarl is the strongest, Ais second, Finn is probably third, Riveria, Gareth are level 6 as well and there is Allen and two elves level 6 in Freya familia, Bete, the twin amazons, the four gulliver brothers, Tsubaki, Phryune are level 5.</br>  <br> it's only manga readers forcing that idea <br>I mean they do look alike. Aiz not noticing/commenting on such a similarity may be proof that in universe it's not true. However, she could just not be thinking about it since she is an airhead after all, and in to some extent it could explain her fondness for Bell, that she might not be aware of. Though I'll readily admit that the only base of this speculation is that the two characters have similar hair, and as such her dad looks like an older bell.</br></br>  <br>How would Bell, who doesn't look like her at all reminds her of herself but not her father if they are so similar? Especially when she was a daddy girl, it doesn't make sense. The time she compared the two was when he beat the minotaur, thinking that he had the right to be a hero, like her dad, there's no mention of resemblance and it's in a series where Revis noted that Ais looked like her mom and called her Aria, in the LN itself there's no such thing.</br>  <br>He is.<br>He acts like a shy anime girl love interest.</br></br>  <br> How would Bell, who doesn't look like her at all reminds her of herself but not her father if they are so similar? <br>She's dense, and could just not be drawing the conclusions. That's to say that I don't think it would be farfetched if she didn't think about visual similarities in their features that are apparent at least in the manga depiction of her father.<br><br> That said it's just speculation, valid as speculation until we actually know who both of their parents were, and know they weren't the same people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Valid as a speculation yes, but she never thought or mentioned that they looked similar so it changes everything when someone post this so <br> is definitely wrong. Ais not thinking about resemblance with him while looking at him and seeing him so many times is ridiculous even tough she's an airhead and it's not like her mentors Finn, Riveria and Gareth didn't know her parents as well, yet they never thought of a resemblance. It's a theory born from visual pictures of the manga, heck, is face is not even seen in the manga and yet he's supposed to look exactly like him.</br></br>  <br> Finn, Riveria and Gareth ... never thought of a resemblance <br>We don't know that. We only know that they've never commented on such a resemblance. It's entirely possible they didn't consider it, due to it being outside of their expectations. Another possibility is for whatever reason didn't want to comment on it, but did notice a resemblance. It can't really be definitively settled as speculation until we know who Bells parents were.<br><br> Them having the same parents would mean that Aiz's friends were keeping that Loki familia/Loki are/is responsible for their deaths from her, and it stands to reason that that they wouldn't want her to know that if such a thing is the case.<br><br>There's really not enough information to make much of an assertion either way, and the only information we have is a similarity in hair style, and a assumed similarity in hair color, and other features. I concede that that's not solid enough information, and I'd really like a color depiction of her father, but it does make for interesting speculation, and speculation that can't definitively be disproven, at least not yet anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   take a liking to jealous background yuri crush elf character <br> take up Sword Oratoria because Berserk Amazons  <br> turns out Lesfiya is a major character <br>PRAISE THE GODS!</br></br></br>  <br>Riveria and Finn at the very least know about both her parents. It's a speculation that can't be disproved but which is weak to begin with. Ais not thinking about resemblance coz she's an airhead despite all these scenes is beyond ridiculous, there's no mention of resemblance in the LN. Loki made Zeus familia quit Orario so she wouldn't be able to take Ais, unless it was in some rules, everything points out that her dad died facing Ziz.</br>  <br>Cute elf girl is cute.</br>  <br><br>Can you explain me why do you ave that yurishit elf as a fav? I understand that you can like her, but as a fav? She has some of Bell character in her but the rest make her extremely annoying, the only good thing about her is her magic.</br></br>  I wish I could capture Riveria and hatefuck her until she breeds a smaller army of half elves.  Why is Loki such a best everything?  <br>They can change the staff though, it's the same for Raildex animes.</br>  <br>I'd give her a ride too.</br>  Nice view. They just couldn't finish without it I guess. Not that I'm complaining.  <br>Those bountiful mamaries</br>  <br>They're bigger than beru's head</br>  Would you?  <br><br><br>How can anyone hate Hestia?</br></br></br>  <br>He already gains levels more than ten times the rate of everyone else.<br><br>He got to level 2 in 6 weeks, while the record beforehand was a fucking year. Who knows how slow is the average rate.</br></br></br>  <br>She should be universally loved because she has a nice body? If you are a Hestiafag you're a pretty bad one. She has a nice body, her character is shit.</br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Liking Lefiya's bait post, just like people liking Kuroko.</br>  <br>Kuroko at least isn't as useless. The better answer would be being into /u/</br>  <br>6 weeks compared to 1 year is not 1 : 10.</br>  <br>Lefiya isn't useless either. She's a mobile artillery as of Volume 4, she is actually useful even in Floor 59, which I don't think Bell is yet.  She's still annoying as fuck though. </br>  <br>Fine, 8.6 times. Happy?</br>  <br>Not him 1 year was the record, they take normally more than 1 year. And I think it took him 2 months not 6 weeks, I could be wrong though.</br>  <br>Does she use anything other than magic now? Like fight with her staff or hand to hand? Are there elves other than Ryu who do that?</br>  <br>Loki is a guy, you know?</br>  Why is the spinoff more interesting than the main story?      <br>It's actually fun to watch OP people being OP.</br>    <br>The murder and crime things really intrigues mes</br>  <br>The cutest.</br>  <br> loki <br> cute <br><br>gay.</br></br></br></br>  Whats with the levels in this anime anyway? When Bell &amp; Crew arrived on the save floor it did not look like Aiz and her party had any trouble fuckin up the floor boss. If the other half of her party is close to the same level as hers (lvl 6), why did they have problems with a, even somehow powered up, lvl 5 floor boss? They even had help from the elf and andromeda, and I'm sure they are atleast Aiz level too.  <br>Aiz party had no trouble beating Goliath. The dungeon spawned an OP Goliath because of Hestia divine power, Loki familia had already gone. Ryu and Asufi are not even close Aiz level, they are level 4, they don't even compare to the level 5s. If Ryu had her status updated she would be level 5 though.</br>  <br>thanks, it seems the difference of a single level is realy big then.</br>  <br>Very big.</br>  <br><br>All magics are unique to the caster, there is no skill lister here. Riveria is an anomaly who can use more than three magics, she is an heroic vessel, and the strongest mage of Orario, author didn't reveal her status but she has a a rare development ability which works like mind potion and reduce the amount of mana her magics take, at full power, mana can't ever be depleted, it's very rare and an ability any high level magic users dream to have, and <br>Aiz got it when she became level 6.</br></br></br>  <br>listed*</br>  <br>Strawberries and Cream</br>  <br>doing cute and autistic things on the surface.</br>  <br>Lefiya right now has<br>1 super long cast aoe ice spell<br>1 super short cast shield<br>1 long (?) aoe fire<br>1 short auto-homing nuke<br>Can cast while moving.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>those tights...</br>  <br> The dungeon spawned an OP Goliath because of Hestia <br>Is this speculation or proven?<br><br>Also, what was that limit?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>It's weird because the other adventurer like aiz already level 6 in such young age so he is not special.</br>  <br>Proven<br>Argonaut charged to the max<br><br>Aiz started raiding dungeons at 7.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably bell is demi god he can glow like hestia.</br>  <br>Aiz is sepcial, don't think anyone can become adventurer at 7, survive and even break the record.<br><br>He is human, his two parents were human, Zeus only adopted him. He was using Argonaut at full power.</br></br></br>  <br>It's because the main story is literally Sword Art Offline.</br>  <br> dropped after watching the whole series. <br>I don't think you know what you're talking about, anon</br></br>  <br><br>Argonout never make your whole body emit light. Skill attack only make his tip weapon emit light and nothing else. This skill change his body color to light</br></br>  <br>Argonaut at max = citation needed. Argonaut is not making limit off skill.</br>  <br>All floor bosses are called 迷宮の刺客 in the Web Version (刺客 = assassin) instead of 迷宮の孤王 in the Bunko Version. People speculated these "special monsters" are given birth out of the hatred from the Dungeon for the Deities' suppression. This is why Deities are forbidden to go in, because it would cause all kind of irregular event and spawn uber bosses.</br>  <br>I got raided by my dad at age 7 as well ;_;</br>  <br>Her friends mostly young too.</br>  <br> The thing is he shouldn't be able to do stuff like that yet but he does it anyway <br>Why shouldn't he? The feat of defeating a higher level monster is pretty much how most adventurers level up. And there's only a difference of one level, so it's not all that special.</br></br>  <br>All I am, saying is Vanilla with chocolate sauce covering her is my fetish...</br>  <br>All her friends also at that age. So she is not special.</br>  <br>Goliath is floor boss and rare level 5. Red minotour is much stronger minotour so mostly level 3. So at level 2 bell already defeated level 5 goliath with his regen still strong.</br>  Ranking of females who want Bell's wee wee:<br><br>1. Hestia (Obvious first place);<br>2. Freya (She can even have a orgasm just watching Bell);<br>3. Lili ("Bell-sama");<br>4. Eina (The "date" and that hug at the ending credits... she totally wants his dick);<br>5. Syr (She even confess but Bell doesn't believe in his own luck);<br><br>About Aiz i don't know but taking in account Sword Oratoria she likes him too. I want to see more of her in the future second season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can Bell resist this literal sex goddess?</br></br>   Aiz wants to be the strongest <br> her whole existence is about getting stronger <br> Bell has a bullshit power that lets him level up rapidly <br>Do Japs just hate the concept of hard work?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah he can. That's what Realis Phrase is for. Bell's libido for Ais makes him immune to all other Charm effects.</br>  <br>too old</br>  <br> too old <br><br>You're think of Hephaestus.<br><br>I believe I speak for everyone here when I say Hephaestus is too old to be attractive. She's like 35.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the Web Novel further along?</br>  <br>He just kid he is immune because he is pure and doesn't know about sex because ishtat is god of sex. Her power of charm is not that special because he also got rejected in myth.</br>  <br> Lili <br>Takes a fucking super drug that mindbreaks everyone who has ever had it, and fucking retains only her undying love for bell winning soma's favor, and helping bell. Nobody probably loves bell more than lili.</br></br>  <br>She. Isthar charm works with horny people she is rejected by warrior.</br>  <br>Aiz is looking for a hero stronger than her ready to save her.</br>  <br>Hestia is bottom tier.</br>  <br><br>The same idiot again, Argonaut emits light, it was at full power so the effects were bigger. It is a charging move, and he charged it at the limit, which is 3 minutes.</br></br>  <br> Bell has a bullshit power that lets him level up rapidly <br> gets nerf so hard in vol 8 because gotta pander and throw a bone for hestia. </br></br>  <br>LN surpassed it long ago.<br><br> Eina <br>No.<br> About Aiz i don't know but taking in account Sword Oratoria she likes him too. I want to see more of her in the future second season. <br>Not yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please fuck off and go away idiot newfag.</br>  <br>Charm is the same for every beauty goddess, Freya is more powerful though. It works on everyone, even gods, she charmed adventurers with it. Bell is immune because Realis Phrase completely stops Charm.</br>  <br> Eina <br> No. <br><br>...</br></br></br></br>  Does being Bete ever stop being suffering?  <br> Embarrassment=/=love <br>She doesn't love him. Bell is blushing too, do you think he loves her? No. Hestia, Freya, Lili, Syr and Haruhime are part of his harem, Eina is not.</br></br>  <br>You are wrong. The myth and the logic prove it. Ishtar more of god of sex than beauty. Bell is still underage that doesn't know sex. Ishtar got rejected by warrior so she is rejected too by bell cranel.</br>  <br>That armor design is so stupid. If someone landed a thrust anywhere on her upper body, the metal boob socks and throat piece would literally guide the blade into her throat instead of a less harmful part of her body. All of her vital organs and main arteries are completely exposed. The only thing she's being protected from is getting her nips pinched and tripping and falling over on her knees.</br>  <br><br> people actually find this half-breed attractive <br><br>why</br></br></br></br>  <br>He gets friendly with Bell and even help him when Hyacinthus was trashing Bell by telling them to fuck off.</br>  <br>In your myth Hestia is a loli goddess? Hephaestus is female? This is not IRL mythos, Danmachi has its own set of rules. Ishtar and Freya are both beauty goddess with the same Charm ability, but Ishtar owns the red district with all the prostitutes.</br>  <br>It's fantasy armor. It doesn't have to be practical to be effective. If you can't stomach shit like this in fiction you're better off watching Knights Templar documentaries on Discovery</br>  <br>It goes beyond simply impractical though. Being unarmored would be more protective than this shit.<br><br>I can deal with all the completely unarmored people in this show. But that stupid boobplate, what the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>So he acknowledges his inner cuck</br>  <br>She actually doesn't need armor. Loki tricked her because she wanted her to wear this. Aiz used her Ariel for offense and defense.<br><br>That's a new one.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Why? Really?</br></br>  <br> It goes beyond simply impractical though <br>You're watching a wish fulfillment fantasy almost harem with people that have changing stat sheets on their backs, gods walking among them and a guy with HACKS that can kill almost anything and you complain about one fucked up breastplate?<br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes, sure...</br></br>  <br>She's responsible for him, was worried about him, and was relieved that he hadn't died.</br>  <br><br>So... that means they fucked, right?</br></br>  This show gives me a really bad case of not giving a fuck about Hestia and Bell and wanting to know more about the other characters.<br> More spin-offs when? <br><br>Is Hestia this fucking annoying in the written works? I didn't bother since I was already looking up the spin-off</br></br></br>  <br>It's seems that you're new over here.</br>  <br>Cant blame Eina<br><br>Every adventurer under her care often dies and Bell is like a little brother to her and is protective and is bias when it comes to anyone under her care.</br></br></br>  So how many months will it take for this shitty LN to be forgotten after the anime ends?<br><br>I say... two.</br></br>  <br><br> Hug=love <br>Seriously? Don't you know someone of the opposite sex, or even of the same sex can hug you if that person was worried? Because she did it it means she's in love with him? Are you retarded? Or just an anon with an horrible social life?</br></br></br>  <br>They toned down Hestia's annoying behaviour a lot especially in the first episodes. She's a little shit. In the spinoff there are more about the other familias as well, more teamwork, like with Hermes familia, Dyonisus etc.</br>  <br> quickmeme.com <br>Fuck off</br></br>  <br> quickmeme.com <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  Lili a cute.  <br>The fuck? You mean to tell me this shit is toned down?<br>Fucking hell, why do authors think this is a good thing?<br><br>Oh well, but I do like the other familias more, guess I'll just focus on that shit since from what I seen it goes into the main story for all the important shit I need to know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sick meme dud</br>  <br>Hestia is so shit in the wrtten works<br><br>Her appearances is just going with the same jealous tone every time that its annoying as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>He is loli because her cult is small in greek. Hephaestus female it's just because hephaestus born from goddess without any male counterpart. And god gender is not problem in danmachi because god can shapeshift and this is not only contain greek god/ goddess but in many myth and cult where gender of god is not clear too .</br>  <br>game of thrones threads are on /tv/</br>  <br>unfortunately, it's hot shit right now</br>  <br>It shows part of the main story when he and Ais interacts so it's not everything and lately, author is showing Ais less and less in the main story and it slows down Bell's growth RP is better when he's with her. Bell's party is starting to work more with other familias though, mainly Takemikazuchi since the gods are good friends.</br>  <br>Gender is matter only in greek in other cult or religion he god itself often has no fixed gender</br>  <br>Eh, I do wanna learn about those guys but fuck.

But if she finds out about how Bell wants to be a Hero this is going to be relevant.</br>  who /aizwithdrawal/ here  <br>Right? I haven't read the LNs or anything but I read somewhere that Welf and his magic sword beat some fucking ass which is what earned him lvl 2 after the fight. In the anime it created a giant fireball but it didn't seem like it was actually hurt by it. Also didn't explain what 'original' his sword surpassed. That being said the fight was pretty awesome other people just need more props, like if Welf and the others had melted the Goliath down to its bones I doubt people would be as mad about Bell blowing its upper half away.</br>  <br> he'll never know the joy of a hard cock in the mouth <br> he'll never slurp burning hot cum from the still-twitching cock of some girlyboy <br> he'll never be gangbanged until he's left on the floor in utter bliss as cum dribbles from his mouth and asshole <br><br>A moment of silence for anon, ladies and gentlemen.</br></br></br></br></br>  Dick status: muh.

Serena's next on-screen duel will result into a loss, then it will be followed by more. That's always YGO tradition.</br>  <br>Either way she still has the most wins out of any female duelist in the series already.</br>  <br>Sawatari a best, Serena a cute, Tokumatsu a bro, this episode a good</br>  <br>Personally, I prefer the moxen since they're still worth something if they're not in your opening hand.</br>  <br> Serena will never get to lead her pet dog Sawatari around on a leash  <br> Dennis will kidnap her <br> Sawatari will get carded trying to save her <br> Yuya vs. Yugo will get Yugo poofed by Yuzu to Fusion where Yuri will eat him <br> Yuzu will then get kidnapped <br> Dennis destroys all of them and escapes with the Ruris <br> Sawatari and Ninja are carded and out now <br> Reiji shows up and is like JUST AS PLANNED WE FOUND THE TRAITOR, LETS GO GANG </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When the ruris don't get a daily dose of being crude and strong they pout.</br>  <br><br>Anzu literally never lost a duel</br></br>  <br>She's probably just upset she hasn't had her sweets or Sawatari to yell at.</br>  <br>I can't wait to see Gon and Shun's beautiful combo next week.</br>  <br>Neither has Serena, also Anzu only dueled 3 times. She may be undefeated but almost every other YGO female has more wins than that because they actually got to duel more than 3 times.</br>  <br>Where is Aki in her benchwarmer outfit?</br>  <br>Gon comes out with strangely situational cards and uses up his hand to make it easier for Shun to bring out Rise Falcon. Rise Falcon uses an overlay unit and brave claw revolutions. Enemy's LP hits 0.</br>    <br>Will Ebina's love for Ruris at least make it a well animated duel, with new Moonlights?</br>  <br> new Moonlights </br>  <br>I hope to God, I'm tired of seeing Moonlight Cat Dancer and Moonlight Blue Cat and then her opponent losers. The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out.</br>  <br> Shun mercilessly beating Synchro Nico Smiley </br>    <br>She needs a new level 4 Moonlight monster so she can  OVERLAY  them.</br>  <br>She would never do something so disgusting.</br>   her face when she has to ride bikes now whether she wants to or not <br>CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES, YUZU<br>CARD GAMES ON MOTORCYCLES</br></br>  <br>Yeah, she and everyone else in the Lancers should Pendulum Summon since they're part of the Sawatari Generation</br>  <br> What Shun sees when he looks at Yuzu </br>  <br>Fucking bird hair</br>  <br>She would if Kurosaki-sensei taught her how.</br>   Yuzu will finally stop wearing her Nazi outfit.   <br>She should keep wearing that shorts+sleeveless shirt combo.<br><br>And her riding suit should have no sleeves too.

They seem to have the potential to be quite fun.  <br>What is this?</br>  <br>BAD END CONFIRMED</br>  <br><br><br>Ruri~</br></br></br>  <br>Chances are we'll get it when Sawatari tries to save everybody, comes close to winning, and ends up carded. Like Jonouchi's Shadow Realm duel with Marik. <br><br>I'm gonna guess he stays in EGAO mode once Yuzu gets mad at him for eating Yugo.</br></br></br>  <br>W H E N</br>  <br>You've got it backwards. You won't be seeing any more Moonlights, unless the cards are coming out.</br>    <br>Yuzu is going to be leg locking and telling Yuya to come inside so much when they reunite that their kid will probably be able to take over by Arc V 2</br>  <br> The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out <br>Cookmates say otherwise</br></br>  <br> Cookmates have enough cards to fill out a deck. <br> Print Aqua Actress' instead. <br><br>Ironically this is what gives me hope that anything can be printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc V writers are a bunch of waifufags, which means Serenas cards will probably be printed</br>  <br>Your Tomato knows how to ride a motorcycle, why can't you?</br>  <br>Free token cards from the official Konami girls-only Yugioh meetup they have every month or so</br>  <br>Not how that works, they rarely push cards that come out before they do in the anime. It's why I'm baffled seeing people assume Ryo or Jonouchi are coming back solely because they're pushing Cyber Dragons and Red Eyes cards.<br><br>A few archetypes say otherwise, like the Dinosaurs from GX. Either way he is right, the more cards you see in the anime the better chance they have of coming out at least a little bit. <br><br>I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly, especially when we have so many other more deserving cards that need to be printed, and not just in Arc-V, we still have tons of cards from the other series that need to be printed, let alone about half of the archetypes in Arc-V. Konami really needs to try and start producing more cards instead of focusing on the Entermates, there are a ridiculous number of them already, or trying to push older cards that half of them don't even fit into any decks people even use anymore, even with some of the new supports.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  <br> I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly <br>Because they had to print SOMETHING for Arc-V.</br></br>  Yuya may be the cutest and most perfect looking and sounding and acting and everyt- <br>Just answer the question<br>http://strawpoll.me/4770619</br></br>  <br> there are a ridiculous number of them already <br>Is the number of Entermates Blackwing level yet?</br></br>  <br> No Yusei <br> Dub Judai name </br></br>  <br>Could have printed a lot of different shit instead.<br><br>It's getting there. I feel with how much Shun gets pushed in the anime, BUY RAID RAPTORS is gonna be the new one along with BUY ENTERMATES and BUY ODD-EYES.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya and Yuzu fuck the multiverse up bad  <br> both go their own separate ways <br> miraculously save child individuals that reminds them of their former selves and raise them. <br> 10 year timeskip Yuya becomes an Archer-tier EdgeLord and Yuzu becomes morally grey. <br> Try to travel back in time to change what they did wrong but multi-verse theory happens meaning no matter how hard they try it won't affect their recent world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot that blonde girl with glasses on the first Yugioh, you know the one who actually kissed Yugi.</br>  <br>If you count anime only, there totals around 40 Entermate monsters.</br>  <br>Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? Most of his cards stick to an archetype (hence, Entermates and Magicians) since in the past the MC's deck would be more mish mash.</br>  <br>Yuzu confirmed MC for Part 2.<br><br> Gongenzaka  confirmed MC for Part 3.</br></br></br>  <br> no yusei <br>i know he would get all the votes, but come on.</br></br>  <br> Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? <br>I cant imagine he comes anywhere close to all the garbage Hero cards Judai had printed</br></br>  <br> 40 Entermate monsters already and we're not even halfway through the show <br><br>For what purpose</br></br></br>  <br> Meanwhile Reiji is time traveling with Yliaster and Paradox trying to save the worlds from utter destruction <br> yfw the Domino City Paradox comes from is Synchro Dimension after Fusion is done with it <br><br>Elemental Heroes got a lot, but for the most part, yeah Yuya is getting tons of cards printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's his time to shine</br>  <br><br>Judai probably will forever hold that record.<br>Yusei and Yugi probably have similar amount of cards printed, but it's harder to keep track of the number of their released cards because they don't stick to a specific archetype that much</br></br></br>  <br>Arc-V 2? Incoming Yuzu taking the spotlight. Which makes me ponder just what exactly they are gonna do to Yuya to take him out of action for a good chunk of the season. I mean, it's not like Judai got a replacement during his time as the supreme king</br>  <br><br>No</br></br>  <br> there are people here RIGHT NOW dumb enough to take that post seriously <br>You guys are not often the brightest, even for 4chan</br></br>  <br><br>More like 30</br></br>  <br>Yusei had nearly all of his cards printed didn't he?<br>All the Synchrons, Warriors, Effect Veiler, Ghost Gardna, the Stardusts, Armory Arm, Quillbolt, Level Eater<br>Fuck, what didn't get printed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yugi at first didn't have many at all, by now he probably does yeah. But solely because they re-release cards, they've added tons of supports for older cards the past year or two with DM cards, they've been trying to give them Synchro/Xyz shit and everything. <br><br>From a straight show base I believe it goes.<br><br> Judai <br> Crow <br> Yuya <br> Yugi <br> Yusei/Yuma <br><br>I'm not even sure if we can count Yugi as the OCG/TCG was just coming out so of course they'd get cards printed. <br><br>Chances are it'll have something to do with Yugo getting nom'd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Eita won't be the new protag </br>  <br>I know right<br> There are people who dont know Arc V 2 will follow Neo New Sawataris revolution </br></br>  Just saw the movie, gotta say it felt like watching the original DragonBall than a DragonBall Z movie<br>Plus<br> Tenshinhan not being shit <br> Roshi being a complete badass again <br> Krillin not jobbing <br> Piccollo being his badass self again <br> no kid trunks or goten <br> Gohan going Super Saiyan, still jobbed but worth seeing fighting again <br> Freezer being his badass self <br> Freezer army actually being a threat <br> Vegeta actually doing something and not jobbing or being a coward  <br> Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan isn't that ugly  <br> Freezer mocks himself for calling his form Golden freezer <br> Trunks x Mai OTP confirmed  <br> Dragon Balls actually being used <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127318486#p127318486">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Roshi is strong.  <br>What about this guy?

Don't seek it, just stumble on to it while you're reading, happy fapping, anon.</br></br></br>  Anime looks like absolute QUALITY.   those tits <br>With Yuuko from Triage this season, her and Cerea from Monmusu next season, are we finally returning to the age of anime with mega tits being common?<br><br>I feel like they've dropped off significantly since around the Dragonaut days.</br></br></br>  <br>That's youtube voice analysis thinking the spoken language is French and trying to transcribe it as such not official subs.</br>  <br>Yeah, that was my bad, I should have put that in spoilers. Regardless, knowing about it wont tarnish the scene too much. You know it's coming you just don't know when, or the why.</br>  <br>Cowtits banzai!</br>   Hiroshi Kamiya (Levi in Attack on Titan) <br><br>What the fuck?<br><br>Why not say Arararagi when Kiyoshi is literally Ararararagi 2.0</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I mean i'm 20 chapters away from being caught up so I have no need to spoil myself by skipping just to fap. <br><br><br>But youtube doesn't do that automatically, at least I don't think it does.<br><br><br>You don't need to spoil that in a thread that's mainly composed of people who are caught up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>France are bigger weebs than americans will ever be</br>   Levi (Attack on Titan) <br> not Zetsubou Sensei IN PRISON </br>  <br>You heard one Kamiya role, you heard them all.</br>  <br>As if that's a bad thing, I love his voice in anything he's in.</br>  <br>I have a better chance learning french and moving to France than staying in America hoping for more localizations and people who like the same kind of anime as me</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127304958 <br>You're a fucking moron.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127305257 <br> namefag <br>Go attention whore on some other site.</br></br>  Prison school's censorship in Japanese's street  <br>What's up with the random shading on the colors? I really don't like it.</br>  <br>Kamiyan fucked up Manlet, but he is Zetsubou Sensei, he is perfect for Kiyoshi.</br>  I'm guessing this is going to be a guarantied hit regardless of the studio or people behind it since the manga is so popular  <br>Are you nuts?The anime will cover the first arc, or perhaps only till the date with chiyo.</br>  <br>It's airing at the same time and channel as Triage X did. Take that as you will.</br>  <br>they can't censor this show as much as they did with Triage X because it isn't about action but about comedy that rely on comedy</br>  <br>Chiyo has bigger breasts than Hana?</br>  <br>I think, everyone except risa, and the boys minus andre has bigger breasts than hana</br>  <br>Yes but Hana has a better ass.</br>  <br><br>Isn't it obvious who is going to lose then? He is a Titsman.</br></br>  <br>As long as he's not a shitty tsunderefag, she's toast anyway.<br>He literally called their last experience together "well, at least it's better than shit"</br></br>  <br>that's a great picture of it</br>  <br>Those tits are deadly weapons.</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br> Katsuyuki Konishi <br>Muh dick</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127306144 <br>Well I mean just look at the faces or shit. the darkness/lightness varies for no reason. Look at this image more closely, do you see what I mean?</br>  Am I the only one who finds Risa to be really cute? Both in looks and in personality I think she's cute. I like how hard she tries to make Andre happy  I wish she was interested in another character though   <br>so much ass on the screen it's unreal</br>  <br>She is easily best girl.<br>She's actually one of the best girls in manga overall.<br>Decides who she wants.<br>Gets over her embarrassment.<br>Is open about the fact she wants to do stuff with him.<br>Tries to improve for his sake.<br>When the average girl -in this manga and in general- would blush/freak out/lash out at kinky stuff, she not only goes through with it, she has him tell her "no, you failed" in her face, accepts it and tries to learn from his advice.<br><br>She's beyond perfect.<br>Seriously, compared to the rest of the cast, it's not even funny. The rest are either totally clueless -with possibility of upcoming dark side- or nasty cunts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know she is trying to be like Meiko? Too bad the real version is always better than the copy so..</br>  <br> Subs when? <br><br>It's not airing yet retard.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet on best boy andre to settle this and choose risa in the cavalry even after meiko awakes. Risa is miles better than meiko, she's trying to please her man. We don't even know if meiko likes men.</br>  <br> He is a Titsman <br>Blasphemy!</br></br>  <br>If being an assman leads you to be like principal-kun, then being a titman is the right choice.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon. I don't feel ashamed of my Risa love anymore</br>  <br>Being an Assman is what brought about the Principal's rise to power. The ravages of time dulling his senses is what brought about his downfall. Being an Assman is what will lift him back up.</br>  <br>There's literally no reason to be.<br>She's anything I ever wanted and couldn't find in manga girls.<br>Upfront without being pushy, accommodating without being a doormat , eager for kinky stuff while being loyal, loving and devoted.<br>A best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga, this man has done some major fuck ups that we don't know about.<br>Either he lets his daughter treat him like that for no reason, which is a fuck up.<br>Or he has done some really bad stuff and ruined his family, so he lets her act like that out of guilt.<br>Either way, major fuck ups.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon this is exactly how I feel. Only reason I don't talk about Risa is because I feel like she is completely overshadowed by the other female characters. I mean I like literally every important character in Prison School but Risa is the best.</br>  <br> overshadowed <br>well, narrative wise, hana and chiyo are the mc bowl fighters, kate and mari are the antagonists and meiko is the fanservice.<br>But quality wise she overshadows them, easily. Which is a good thing. Let the other fight over screen time, she'll be on the sidelines with her fat husbando.<br>Seriously, that scene when she wanted to cuddle a bit after she managed to subdue him. <br>Wow.<br>As a  dom  I was really touched.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know. It wasn't always like that. Remember the Meiko flashback? Remember how proud Mari was of her father? The manga starts after Assman's decline. What we've seen is a man who had lost his way, one who no longer had the courage to stand tall and bare it all. His faith had faltered.<br>Andre and Meiko aren't the only ones who need reawakening. The true Assman has lain dormant for years, and only now is he starting to re-emerge.</br></br>  hana is literally worst girl  <br>Yes.<br>And he'll awaken with mc's help.<br>Who is a titman.<br>He'll help assman realise that both tits and ass are great and one most love everything a woman has to offer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never thought I'd say this, but Meiko's tits are too big.</br>  <br> worst girl <br> when pick related exists </br></br>  <br>Worst = Most interesting</br>  You can't really get the same quality out of the manga if its going to be animated. Sure it will make a ton of money but it looks like shit and feels like selling out. I guess integrity means nothing in Japan.  Kiyoshi is literally best girl.  Do you think it'll live up to the manga  <br>I meant overshadow as in nobody noticed her and payed more attention to the others.</br>    <br>I think it looks fine besides the random burning like  said and how Meikos tits are handled, they don't look the same as in the manga, imo. Plus that fucking VA cast though<br><br><br>Only if it isn't censor or remove any scenes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>being a slut is key to winning the kiyoshibowl</br>  <br>That voice cast is perfect.</br>  <br> Mari Kurihara: Sayaka Ohara <br>What the fuck? She would've been better as Meiko.</br></br>  <br>How is she a slut? Her heart and mind has only been for Kiyoshi.</br>  <br><br>Not gonna lie, while i was reading the manga i always read Kiyoshi's lines with Yato's voice, from Noragami. They looked so similar that it was almost impossible not to.</br></br>  <br>You don't seem to know when to use that word.</br>  <br>talking about the linked video you retard</br>  <br> coughing during the introduction <br>made me chuckle</br></br>  <br><br>Yup she's the best. <br><br>Her efforts are what's making her better than meiko. meiko a shit!</br></br></br></br>  <br>meiko isn't a shit.<br>risa is better than meiko, by far, but meiko isn't shit.<br>we just have to see her treating a guy like she treats mari.</br></br></br>  Guys, everyone is a good character except for Chiyo and Shingo.  <br>Shingo did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Chiyo is a total bro what the fuck.<br><br>Hanafags need to fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Shingo is good though. Chiyo is a little boring but still better than most girls in manga</br>  <br>Every other girl in the manga is much more interesting that Chiyo. <br><br><br>Shingo is a horrible friend. Kiyoshi talking nonsense in 180 and Shingo ran away from him.<br><br><br>I like every other girl in the manga.Don't need to be a Hana fan to even dislike Chiyo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ANN provided translations retard</br>  <br>being interesting while being an insufferable cunt isn't a positive trait</br>  <br> Hana Midorikawa: Kana Hanazawa <br>Did they think they were being clever? Fucking japs. I'm legit somewhat upset about this.</br></br>  <br> But youtube doesn't do that automatically, at least I don't think it does. <br>It does.</br></br>  <br>I see a lot of videos that don't have it though and I mean new videos. Also how would it fuck up and think it's french.</br>    <br>Why?</br>  <br>Hanazawa is perfect for fake cute but actually batshit girls.</br>  <br>you nuts?<br>people in these threads have been asking for hanzawa for possible anime adaptation before the anime was even announced.<br>she's perfect for such roles, as <br>said.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hanazawa was born to play this part.</br>  Are there any subs?  <br> Hana voiced by HanaKana <br>Well the already did something right</br></br>  <br>They all look dead as fuck, holy shit</br>  <br>And she chose the best day to be born.<br> My birthday </br></br>  <br>They're probably overscheduled as fuck, man.</br>  Will the bit with the guy's model and the vice pres be animated?  Anybody else think the artstyle isn't that bad?  except meiko, she looks terrible   <br>I actually give me a boner the first time I saw that...</br>  I haven't been keeping up with this, do we have a confirmed date/season for when it's coming out? Any confirmation for how many episodes they'll be adapting initially?<br><br><br>I'm going to die if she doesn't cosplay as Hana at least once</br></br></br>  <br>Next season.</br>  <br>11 days and 18 hours.</br>  <br>I know, she kinda looks like Hana.</br>  <br>That doesn't help since this season just ended and you might mean next next season<br><br><br>Thanks, I can't wait.<br><br><br>Dye hair blonde and put the school uniform and trousers on her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this season just ended <br>There are still unfinished things.</br></br>  <br>It's still a little confusing.</br>  I'll take this moment to say something I said before.<br>About the anime.<br>It's going to be shit.<br>The only place for it to end is after they get out of jail and the pacing will be fucked if they do 12 episodes -or even 24, but who are we kidding, we'll get 12-.<br>But I don't care.<br>I DON'T CARE<br><br>WANNA KNOW WHY?<br><br>MAIDOLL-FEI<br>MEIKO<br>DOUJINS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shit man were her tits always this big?<br><br>Anyway how many eps will this be? I hope its not going to follow the recent trends of 8-10 episodes.</br></br>  <br>Can you believe that I'll be legitimately happy with a 10 episode run, provided it has  anime original ending? </br>  <br> Warner Bros <br>Ruh roh.</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>They were</br>  <br>It only got shit reviews because they outsourced like jews the game development to some console no name team who made it for PC, something they never did before<br><br>Turns out it made the PC port fucking garbage trash</br></br></br>  <br>i hope not</br>  <br> 8-10 episodes <br>Wait what anime has done that recently?<br><br><br>I really can't tell what it is that makes the anime tits look so off</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Triage X</br>  <br> MAIDOLL-FEI <br> MEIKO <br> DOUJINS </br></br></br>  <br>If that's literally you're only example then you can't call it a trend and shouldn't be worried</br>  <br>oh fuck<br>dude, artist name?</br></br>  <br>And a total cunt to just about everyone.</br>  <br>as far as girls in the manga go, only chiyo, cake and anzu are less cunts than her.</br>  <br>Have you just read the first chapter she's in or what?</br>  <br>shindoL</br>  <br>Nope,still a bitch.</br>  <br> those ridiculous knockers <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qWQ<wbr>3AoaP27k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>She's the only girl who worked for her man's love.<br><br>If we ignore bro moments and focus only on romantic relationships, she's the only freaking girl in this "girls rule boyz drool" manga that worked her ass off to make a guy happy. <br>Give her some fucking credit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And none of the other girls are? I don't see your stupid point</br>  <br>they are in prison.</br>  <br>Post more Meiko Shiraki.</br>  <br>It's part of the gimmick</br>  Even if it's bad I will still watch this, I don't even care.  <br>As long as they don't get rid of any scenes and don't censor it (at least in the BDs) it'll still be better fap material</br>  I miss the times where Meiko's tits were smaller than her head.  <br>I'm glad those times are behind us</br>  Those tit's are way too big  <br>I think it would be impossible to fit over 80 chapters in less than 12 episodes, I bet it will be around 24 like Shokugeki.</br>  <br>That's the point.</br>  <br>Her breasts are supposed to be that big, that's the point.</br>  I really can't imagine someone on a/ who didn't read this yet, but are you manga readers going to, purposefully, spoil it for the the anime only watchers? You're not going to do that, right?  <br>You mean that thing /a/ does for every manga ever?</br>  <br><br>I don't remember them being THAT big in the manga.</br></br>  <br>They are, currently. But in the early chapters they were big but still attractive size. rather than I just tied two balloons to a gumball machine physique.</br>  <br>I dunno how I'll deal with Moeiko</br>   Tits too big <br> Hana has too much ass <br>Wat.</br></br>  <br>You can't even see her ass.</br>  <br> Post more Meiko Shiraki. <br>here.</br></br>    <br>Still don't swe her butt.</br>  <br>You won't unless theres a season 2.</br>  <br>season 3</br>  Am I the only one bothered by the fact that Meikos hair is white/gray? I started and caught up with the manga like a week ago and never saw that her hair was white and it bothers me  <br><br>It's Hirame, ShindoL looks way different.</br></br>  <br>I'd say it's more platinum. Doesn't bother me a bit until I remember that she's a teenager.</br>  <br>She's always been a bit, well, "advanced" for her age.</br>  <br>Tits too big. they are not sexy, but comical.</br>  <br>Bless them bovine growth hormones that were shot right into her tits.</br>  <br>Well from the flashbacks it doesn't seem like she dyed it.</br>  <br>What..<br>Is this a fan made or a future chap?</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing no, the style doesn't look the same at all.</br>  <br>Doesn't hurt if it is or not <br>They're gonna end up with each other anyway</br></br>  As long as Meiko turns out well then it will all be worth it.  <br>It's too late anon, they already fucked her design.</br>  <br>Why is this allowed?<br>Hyped</br></br>  <br>Aren't her hips the widest compared to the others?</br>  <br>Those tits just look so fucking bad and we're going to have to deal with it. I hope they do something about it in the BDs at least</br>  <br><br>Are the Vice Presidents tits TOO big?<br><br>Y/N</br></br></br></br>   Prison School and Monster Musume are getting anime. <br>What the fuck kind of world am I living in?</br>  <br>What makes you think it wont just be 2 seasons of 12 episodes</br>  <br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br> Himouto!

I'm starting to get burned out with monogatari. How many novels are left to animate?   Still waiting for commie   <br>You'd think the name suggests something but of course it's not the last one.</br>  Still no Kizu.<br>I'm not bothering until I can watch it.</br>  <br>Koyomi<br>Owari<br>Zoku owari</br></br></br>  <br>is this sequel of Oremonogatari?</br>  <br>It's a spinoff of Owari no Seraph.</br>  <br>And the prequel, Kizu</br>  You just know there is gonna be a giant ass collection that includes all the books and the anime for an exorbitant price.  <br>It'll probably be one of the biggest BD releases in the history of anime. Similar to that one TTGL release. It's probably going to sell out too.</br>  <br>everything  except for kizu </br>  <br>but it's just about to get good man. Tsukimono was utter shit, but Owari is GOAT.</br>   still no kizu <br>Well, at least it's something.</br>  <br> off by one from a palindrome </br>  <br>I got dubs anyway. Can't wait to tell my mom, she will be proud as fuck.</br>  <br><br>Sweet</br></br>  Good keep pressing and get this shit over with already. Its long since worn out its welcome and getting it done and all possible money made should convince them enough is enough  <br> mfw they decide to animate kuzi last <br>At this pace I wouldn't be surprised if it gets released 202X</br></br>   skipping Koyomimonogatari  <br><br>why?</br></br>  im still on fucking nise slow down fam  <br>Its been years nigga</br>  <br>and all the future ones nisio is yet to release</br>  But SHAFT already animated Kizu  <br>The novels are ongoing and will most likely continued to be animated for at least 5 or 6 years.</br>  <br>No, fuck you where's Koyomimonogatari</br>  <br>It's not like they've ever given a fuck about the novels' release order.</br>  <br><br><br>What happens in it?</br></br></br>  <br>alot</br>  <br>They are just a bunch of short stories of Araragi and all the girls he have met, but the sories are a little after he meets teh girl, for instance Koyomi Flower is with Senjougahara before they were a couple.<br>The important thing about Koyomi is that the last chapter is important for what happen next because  Gaen "Kills him" and we don't know what happens next until Owari Vol. 2 , If they animate Owari Vol. 1 it's okay I guess</br></br>  <br> The novels wrapped up for now as far as I understand. I know the guy teased he'd write more but time will tell if that's just a gag or not. Personally i still think it wore out its welcome quite a while ago but I could say the same for a lot of light novel trash</br>   Still no Kizu <br>FFFFFFFUUUUUUCK YOU SHAFT</br>  <br>Bakemonogatari aired 6 years ago<br>How much longer until the series is over? It's kind of sad to think we're near the end.</br></br>  <br>Kazui Hiroko is the one who storyboarded that. She may be implying something there too.</br>  <br>No Kizu until 2020.</br>  <br>I'm glad it's still going actually<br><br>SHAFT could've stopped after Bake but I think they love it too much. Also money.</br></br></br>    <br> I'm glad it's still going actually <br><br>Same, it's nice to have a story that might actually get completely adapted. The endless 1-2 season adaptations and then learn to read Japanese or never see the rest of the story do get annoying.</br></br></br>  <br> The endless 1-2 season adaptations and then learn to read Japanese or never see the rest of the story do get annoying. </br>  <br>Isnt the time to start laughing 379 days away still?</br>  <br>I'll give you an idea, Ian Flemming's James Bond novels spanned from around 1952 to his death in 1964 being written , it took the films from 1962 to 2006 to catch up.</br>    <br>Awesome, I'm a little disappointed if they don't adapt Koyomimonogatari but that's currently being translated so hopefully it won't be an issue.<br><br> The novels are ongoing <br>no they aren't</br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, tsuki was ok</br>  <br>Based shaft</br>    Who is ready to see Kiss Shot again?  <br>Nice. <br>We're talking about how much episode for this arc?</br></br>  <br>Confirmed.</br>   Numachi <br> Tadatsuru <br> Sodachi <br><br>Why would NisiO think it's a good idea to introduce characters at the end of a series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll say 4-5 per arc: Ougi Formula, Sodachi Riddle, Sodachi Lost</br>  <br>I was thinking about it and it makes more sense to animate Koyomi between Owari vol. 2 and Owari vol. 3.</br>  <br>5-6 would be ideal.

My pleas were attended. Best girl shall not be irrelevant by the end of the year anymore.  <br>She's an extremly intersting character.<br>I'm glad we'll know more of her.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127304065 <br>Autism Speaks.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127301521 <br><br>What's worse is a lot of writers in Japan are starting to emulate him and badly at that too. Frankly I'm just about done with Japanese writing period. Why settle for that sort of shit when I can throw on Netflix and find a good show like Daredevil or Cosmos pretty easily.</br></br>  <br>Ougi formula arc is basically this</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127303301 <br><br>You know I hate Monogatari series a lot too and think it's one of the worst things to ever happen to the anime scene along with Haruhi for the kinds of bland characters talking at each other with occasional flashy fan service and absence of actual storytelling that it's lead to but even I think this is a bit much. If you're going to criticize something at least attempt something resembling proper sentence structure and clarity of thought otherwise how are you better than what you're criticizing.</br></br>  <br>I'll take 10 copies</br>  <br>why are you in this thread then?</br>  <br><br>Hey faggot, stop replying to yourself. Put your name back on.</br></br>  <br> actual storytelling <br>Please explain what you mean by this? Just because you don't like how something is presented, doesn't make it not storytelling</br></br>  So when are we gonna learn what the fuck Araragi was doing during Tsubasa Tiger?<br><br>And don't tell me he went to the past, cause it was when he was seperated from Shinobu.</br></br>  <br>he was [fucking snake].</br>  <br> He was off fighting Shinobu's previous servant which is why he shows up in ragged clothes. It also explains why Episode showed up because Gaen wanted a vampire hunter. </br>  <br>For a thread about Owari, there aren't very many pics of best  ____ </br>  <br>okay I'll give you the real answer. he was running away from the dark void with Mayo and shinobu, and then mayoi passed on</br>  <br>That makes sense I guess.<br><br>What novel is this?</br></br></br>  <br>Am I missing something, I don't see shit about Owari on that website.</br>  <br>This thread is a trainwreck because of the namefag shitposter. I'll make another one later.</br>  <br>maybe it was removed after they people found it</br>  <br>He removed it. They are probably waiting for the new BD boxes to come out before making the official announcement.</br>  <br>Shinobu Mail, Owarimonogatari<br><br>Remember when Gaen says she also wants something in return for helping with Snail? She's talking about fighting Shinobu's old servant.</br></br></br>  Are we gonna get a full season or is this just another 4-5 episode thing?  <br>at least that's only next month. I'd appreciate a PV too</br>  <br><br>Another source: http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>75</wbr></br></br>  <br>I'd say full season if they include zoku + the last story in koyomimonogatari</br>   More Monogatari <br>I love it.<br><br>I feel bad for anons whose favorite series are doomed to one cour adaptions with no second seasons.</br></br></br>  <br>It should be enough with one cour and the last episode dedicated to Zokuowari. I don't think Koyomimonogatari will happen at all, maybe as BD specials like someone said before.</br>  <br> favorite anime are durarara and monogatari <br>feels good man</br></br>  <br> 1 episode for Zoku owari <br><br>It's going to get at least 4</br></br></br>  <br> the last episode dedicated to Zokuowari. <br>This doesn't make much sense.</br></br>  <br>I wish.</br>  <br>8 episodes to Owari and 4 to Zoku? No way considering Owari is three volumes long.</br>  <br>Yes way, SHAFT will find a way to rush the hell out of it.</br>  <br>Isn't this outdated?</br>  <br> I don't think Koyomimonogatari will happen at all <br>there's no way they don't include the last story as it ties directly into mayoi hell. and if they include zoku it will be a 2 cour adaptation</br></br>  <br>I imagine it'll be something like this <br><br> and if they include zoku it will be a 2 cour adaptation <br><br>Let's hope so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it is. If you have a newer version please do post so I can save it.</br>  <br>Monogatari got a blank check ages ago.<br><br>Nisio can doodle something in his sleep and Aniplex will fund a SHAFT adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't rush anything except Nise 2 and Second Season, and I'm still blindly believing the excuse that SS was due to making Rebellion at the same time.</br>  <br>Yeah me too.<br><br>We're guaranteed to get everything adapted   well maybe except Kizu but that's being translated officially and has already been translated unofficially  so it's great. That means 2 series of Nisio's are going to have been fully adapted.</br></br></br>  <br>And I would watch it.<br>And I would love it.</br></br>  Second date incoming. ARA finally gonna get some.   we will literally get the end before we get the beginning   <br>do they kiss in that date?</br>  <br>He calls her by her first name at the end of the date. Take that what you will.</br>  <br>The cgi was from 1995, it didnt have a blank check or the producers were stealing it to get ferraris. if not nisions since he only wrote the monotone dialogue.</br>  <br>Oh my god, what is this fucking faggot still doing here. Go back to /co/, namefaggot crossboarder.</br>  <br>How about you stop shitposting? it is monotone. period, repetitive dialogue and overdetails about nothing interesting compared to....well any anime.<br><br>Just because you dont like your anime criticised does not mean this is your tumblr hugbox.</br></br></br>  Owari will definitely be a 1 cour 12 episode adaptation. They've been doing 4 episodes per novel for a while now so this fits. Koyomi will most likely be an OVA. Zoku will also be an OVA. Then Kizu movie.  <br>The dialogue paves the way for excellent character development. Monogatari is a character drama. Nisio has many quirks in his writing that don't translate well into English also.</br>  <br>Hana was 5 episodes<br>Koi was 6 episodes<br>Karen Bee was 7 episodes</br></br></br>  <br>Is there any reason why the movie got delayed so long?</br>  <br>The Tsubasa Cat arc was 5 episodes and it wasn't even a complete novel</br>  <br>People are more receptive to criticism when the writer is capable of coherent thoughts</br>  <br>Again, its his monotone and overuse of lines where few is enough, even when its not and you just read a few, its kinda boring.<br><br><br>That said he does like many other animes likes to make puns, the japanese are obsessed over this since 1980's in manga and anime media. cant figure out why.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Stop fucking replying jesus fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>Gaen kills Araragi so his bond between Kiss Shot will be broken because she wants to make Kiss Shot the god that Nadeko accidentally became to help stabilize the neighborhood.<br><br>Araragi goes to Hell because saving a vampire's life is a Hell-worthy sin in Monogatari-world. Gaen knew this would happen because she knows everything, and she planned for it in advance by coordinating with Teori, who was actually in Hell all along and didn't really get killed by Yotsugi because they were interacting with a puppet Teori's able to make and control from Hell rather than with Teori himself. So when Teori's puppet told them he was cursed to never walk the Earth like Kagenui, he really meant he was cursed in his attempt to become an immortal oddity to die and go to Hell, only able to interact with the world through puppets, in contrast with the more straightforward not being able to walk the Earth curse Kagenui has where she literally can't step on the ground.<br><br>Anyway, Mayoi's in Hell and meets Araragi when he first gets there. She's in Hell because she died before her parents, which is also a Hell-worthy sin in Monogatari-world. Eventually, Araragi is brought back from Hell, and in the process, he grabs Mayoi at the last minute and she's brought back too. But now they have a problem because she'll just get swallowed by the darkness again like last time. So to solve that problem, Araragi makes her the new god instead of Kiss Shot, which is fine because Kiss Shot is demanding that the bond between her and Araragi be restored, something that is more important to her than having full vampire power.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  find a flaw  <br>Whats the most canon lore of vampires in japanese culture? they usually are very rare. not in manga and anime, but thats mostly a western influence.<br><br> She's in Hell because she died before her parents, which is also a Hell-worthy sin in Monogatari-world. <br>Wait what? Nisio what the fuck, what kind of hell universe are you creating?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nisio fucking hates kids with Leukemia. Save it for after you've graduated school and got a job, dummies.</br></br>  <br>Emotionally crippled and suicidal from centuries of isolation. Has killed thousands. Incredibly vain and egotistical.<br><br>She's still best girl by far.</br></br></br>  <br>Her existence. <br><br>Also Princess Beauty.</br></br></br>  <br>not monkey/10</br>  <br>the things I'd do to Tsukihi in that Situation</br>  <br>She's not next to me.</br>  <br>Stop using proxy, janitors already delete all your shit and ban you retard.</br>  <br> finally </br>  <br>Thanks anon, also where is that "sacrifice" from Hitagi?</br>  <br><br>There is no sacrifice, that was other anons rusing you. Kiss Shot has two swords from her first servant, one that kills oddities and one that brings them back to life. Gaen used the first one to kill Araragi and the second one to bring him back to life.</br></br>  I'm a huge faggot, please rape my face.  <br> one that kills oddities <br> used the first one to kill Araragi <br>But Araragi isn't an oddity?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a weakened vampire. Kiss Shot used to be a human before becoming an oddity by virtue of being made a vampire too.</br></br>  <br>At that point Hitagi knows all of this ? because on owari zoku which is the last novel is supposed they stay together and shit right?</br>  <br>I thought Araragi was a vampire-like human whereas Shinobu was the human-like vampire.</br>  <br> not real </br>  <br>Eats humans.</br>  <br>And you don't?</br>  <br>Her backstory.</br>  <br><br> I thought Araragi was a vampire-like human whereas Shinobu was the human-like vampire. <br><br>That distinction is totally arbitrary. Shinobu used to be a human too hundreds of years in the past.</br></br></br></br>  <br>YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR SO FUCKING LONG JUST FUCKING GO</br>  <br>Not before I suck your cock first, honey~</br>  <br>Ignore him.</br>  <br>Thats the distinction Meme told Araragi at the end of Kizu and at the beginning of Bake.</br>  <br><br>Meme says stuff sometimes just to make people feel good.</br></br>  <br>Why is Meme so based?</br>  <br>He's just like that, dank.</br>  <br>Meme is meh meh. He's not even a particularly good exorcist. Can't even get that good balance.</br>  <br><br> He's not even a particularly good exorcist. <br><br>Exorcism isn't a competition.</br></br></br></br>  <br>gaen looks ugly as fuck</br>  <br>newsflash</br>  <br>Doesn't need to be a competition. He's just not particularly good at his job.</br>  <br>Everyone but meme does</br>  I'm pretty sure Kizu will be out during the airing of Owarimonogatari, since it would probably boost the sales. <br>Kizu soon, I can feel it.</br>    <br>maybe in an alternate reality where anyone gave a fuck about kizu</br>  <br>My body has been ready for 5 fucking long years.</br>  What is Sodachi like?  <br>Kizu will be out just before Monogatari's popularity starts to wane. SHAFT has this all calculated.</br>  How do you guys watch subbed anime?<br><br>I don't have fast eye coordination to read the lines at the bottom of the screen and watch the anime scenes at the same time.</br></br>  I watch raws. Get good  I watch it once to read the subtitles, then I rewatch it to get what's going on onscreen.  <br><br>Is this actually a legitimate problem people have?<br><br>Your reading comprehension skills should be good enough that you can passively pick up on the words at the bottom of the screen without needing to lose awareness of what's going on, Unless English is not your first language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I just listen to music while it's running.</br>  <br>I just pretend I watch anime.</br>  <br> tfw I only watch dubbed anime, muted and lip read <br>Get on my level</br></br>  <br>I have this problem, even if I can pick up on or infer most if it from what I see as subs I worry I didn't read it right so I always pause</br>  <br>Not him but yeah, I'm pretty stupid and have to read things over multiple times in my head to actually grasp what I'm reading.</br>  You don't have to pay that much attention to what's going on on screen.<br>That's why we watch little girl shows. There's little to no action or anything going on while they're talking, except for mouth flaps moving, so you don't miss anything.</br>  That means that everyone else that watches anime is just more used to it.<br><br>I was like that when I started too, focusing so hard on the subtitles. The problem is that every other form of reading asks you to focus heavily on the words themselves. When you read subtitles, reading should become second nature instead of a conscious effort. Watch more and you'll get to that level.</br></br>  Dubs are just better in general if you're in a setting where the actors of both versions are equal quality. You can pick up on subtlety in the voices in your native language, like how "I didn't say she stole my manga" means a completely different thing depending on which word the speaker focuses on. You just can't get that in subs unless the subs italicize/bold the word that is focused on, but subs don't do that in almost any case. There is a reason humans developed speech instead of using sign language, there is a lot of subtlety in voices we pick up on subconsciously, and a good VA gets those subtleties across. <br><br>There are a lot of benefits for using dubs. The only big benefit of subs is just that you can learn the language being subbed bit by bit if you pay attention (and this doesn't change the quality of the show at all, it doesn't matter unless you're learning Japanese anyway).</br></br>  Just read the subtitles. It'll be like reading a book.  I feel like watching anime has contributed quite a bit to how fast I can read. Only time I've had a problem was with Tatami Galaxy, but it's not too fast for me anymore.  <br> We <br>Not everyone on 4chan's a closet pedophile. Speak for yourself.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Funimation shill. Your dubs are garbage.</br>  <br>You can pick up on the subtleties in a language you dont speak, especially one like Japanese</br>  <br> The only big benefit of subs is just that you can learn the language being subbed bit by bit if you pay attention </br>  <br>extract the sub and put them in text to speech, put it on 135% volume and put the anime on 85%</br>  Just read manga  <br><br><br>How do you guys function in real life it takes you 30 seconds to read and understand a single sentence?</br></br></br>  its not actually difficult unless youre a mongoloid. learn to a. read multiple words at once and 2. just pay attention to whats happening and the words at the same time  <br>This. I never get how people can miss a whole episode/movie because they had to read the lines at the bottom and focus on the words more than the visuals I guess.</br>  <br>Autism.</br>  Jesus fucking christ, unless this is Tatami Galaxy or shows with equally as quick speaking, there should be no problem.  I'm not ESL and I never have any problem reading subs. Just sometimes in shows like Tatami Galaxy or Teekyu where everyone talks in light speed.<br><br>Does that mean I'm a genius? Or are just all Americans dumb?</br></br>  <br>I'll agree that dubs are better if you want to understand the background stuff, otherwise; i completely disagree.<br><br>The voice actors have to try and match the mouth flapping with the words the characters actually say so they have to come up with inventive ways to translate the words the characters are saying. It can't just be a direct translation. It's a translation that ALSO works verbally, which means the original meaning can sometimes be skewed quite a bit.<br><br>Dubber's have a lot of skill here but they change up a lot. Also, when they pronounce Japanese words, they fuck up a lot. Usually varying in pronunciation between voice actors.</br></br></br></br></br>  watch the american dub like a true patriot  <br>i also change the resolution to 640x480 so the window is smaller so i have to move my eyes less</br>  <br>youre of standard intelligence everyones just FUCKING RETARDED</br>  <br>I don't even look at the screen.

Anyone fluent in English will know the difference between<br><br>I never said SHE stole my manga<br><br>and<br><br>I never said she stole my MANGA<br><br>easily, but if you translate it to another language and subtitle it you won't be able to tell the difference. Yes there are context clues usually, but it just doesn't always work. Subs are fine if you like them, but dubs are a solution and subs are a crutch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually mean I AM ESL.</br>  <br><br> function in real life <br><br> I don't. </br></br></br></br>  <br>They're on /a/, they don't.</br>  Once you've watched over 20 animes like me, you won't even have to spend time reading most of the subs.

They rarely ever have anything important to the show or story, so it's just a waste of time, I think.

Most people watch the opening once in the beginning and once in the end. Skip the rest in the middle.</br></br></br></br>    <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Me. Check em.</br>  <br>  dubs are a solution and subs are a crutch. <br>No. The original gives you a certain voice pronouncing certain words with certain meanings in certain ways. The biggest issue is that you don't have access to the meaning, and the smaller issues are that you don't grasp all the importance/subtleties of the other elements (like the pronunciations and such). Subs and dubs give you effectively equal access to the meaning. Dubs also allow to understand more of the importance of the other aspects, which subs don't, but in order to do this they deprive you of the other elements themselves, which subs don't. You no longer have access to the actual words, the voice, the pronunciation (you have some form of English analogue to the pronunciation, but it's different in terms of what you hear). It's an inferior reproduction compared to subs.</br></br>  <br>Most people here watch dubs, in normal threads I pretend I don't to fit into the secret club, because /a/ is srs bsns. People here pretend dubs are the devil because that's just the way things are done around here.</br>  <br> Most people here watch dubs <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  Eventually you get fast enough so you can distinguish entire sentences at a glance and comprehend it a little bit later.  <br>Almost no one watches dubs because they're terrible.</br>   Those kids in high school who would get called to read and you'd spend 20 minutes on one page <br> Those people grew up <br> They didn't die trying to read a stop sign <br><br>I'm still cringing</br></br></br></br>  It is difficult to resist all this b8  <br>I would call the original the Jap dub, and obviously it's the correct choice most of the time. A nip can watch English dubbed with Jap subs and runs into the same problems.<br><br>The problem is: How do we let English speakers understand anime?<br><br>The crutch is: Type out the words<br><br>The solution is: Make it English.<br><br>Yeah, both have benefits, but in a perfect world (perfect sub translation and dub actors) dubs would always be better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There is a lot of generic OP and ED music, what are you talking about? <br>Generic doesn't mean bad. The amount of OPs that really stand out are low, but most of them are at least good. Hardly unlistenable.</br></br>  <br>Oh, so THAT's how dubbing companies make so much money. They make a product that no one watches, let alone buys, and money magically appears!<br><br>Sorry kiddo, but enough people buy them to make dubbers big bucks, and that includes most of /a/ that spends money on stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>He was obviously talking about /a/, just like you were you fucking idiot.</br>  My name is Dark Word Master.

It specifically says the new monkeys never figured out why they were stopped, so the showers never went off.</br>  <br>They can't learn. They're subhuman.</br>  <br>I post in buyfag threads, but I would never post my boxsets there, because it would derail the thread with arguments. THIS is a thread made for arguments, so I'm fine with bringing it here.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=AXIttXbhxs8#<wbr>t=123</wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br> murikans </br>  <br> mfw this is true <br>It can't be helped.</br></br>  <br>Both are crutches, the solution is to make English speakers into Japanese speakers.<br><br>It's "English" either way. Written English is still English. But you erase the Japanese with the dubs, whereas the subs only add information without taking any away. They preserve the elements of Japanese that do not map well into either spoken or written English (ex: the mouth motion relative to words spoken, auditory puns, etc.), many of which that even an English speaker can grasp when hearing it.</br></br></br>  Only anime I ever struggled with was pani-poni.<br><br>That shit is too fast.</br></br>  <br>This is actually true in terms of tumblr images.<br>A bunch of people think it's because /a/ has some vendetta or grudge against SWJs or whatever is the boogeyman that /v/ hates there so much, but it not for that reason at all.</br></br>  <br>That experiment never actually happened; it's just a made-up story to bash social conformity.</br>  <br>The heck is a SWJ?</br>  <br>This is where most of /a/ should be. Experienced enough to only need subs for more complex sentences. <br><br>Eventually you want to progress to  's level and leave the bullshit sub group drama behind.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate tumblr gifs because they're low quality pieces of shits with overused filters.</br>  You just get a feel for it over time, some phrases you pickup, and really only refer to the subs to get context.<br><br>Non-verbal, or at least the tone of speech is more important than what is being said a lot of the time. If there were more quality dubs i'd probably watch those, but NA voice actors for anime are typically horrible, and the scripts have to go so far outside of what would normally be said in regular english dialog that is becomes obnoxious. <br><br>To me it's like the difference between reading subs vs listening to stephen hawking voice act dubs. The intonation and emotion just isn't there for NA anime voice actors, or at least the differences between japanese and english intonation and emotion in certain situations is culturally different to the point where it just gets frustrating.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because English is not my first language so its easier to read than listening. <br>And subs in my language are more horrible than in english.</br></br>  <br>Scheming wily jew. It's a /pol/ thing.</br>  <br> And subs in my language <br>I mean dubs</br></br>  <br> Non-verbal, or at least the tone of speech is more important than what is being said a lot of the time. <br>This. I really hate when there's a pause, but the subs just pretend there isn't, and it takes away all the feeling the pause was supposed to have because you read it already.<br>This isn't the only thing either. Grammar also causes words that are meant to be last in a sentence come first too. Also, stress on a specific word.<br><br>Only option is to learn moon though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But what about people like me? I'm too old and too white to learn Japanese.</br>  <br>post pic</br>  <br>I watch the opening and closing once, then skip it every time after that. Unless it is exceptional, like Eureka Seven opening 2.</br>   not watching the OP and ED only once then browse /a/ the other times they play   <br><br>I'm not autistic so I can read that fast. <br><br>I also have been learning japanese for a while so I pretty much understand most of what people are saying. It's also pretty funny when some people just completely sub something entirely wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand Japanese, so I usually don't have to read the subtitles</br>  <br>Then you will forever be casual and denied access to /a/'s secret club. I'm sorry.</br>  <br>I've seen over 500 anime and still understand no more than a few words. I'd be completely lost without subs.</br>  <br>To be fair subs take away a bit of the screen, which isn't bad but it sucks when beautiful fight scenes or tits are covered with text. They don't "take away" the Japanese audio, but they take the ability for someone who doesn't understand Japanese to get the subtleties.<br><br><br>It sucks, I hated the dub for this one and I never tried the subs past episode 1 because it seemed like the anime was pretty bad at least at first. Does it get better? I loved Nichijou and Azumanga Daioh, this seems like a similar show, but somehow a lot worse.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How many OPs wold you say are "bad" this season?</br>  <br>You'll get used to it after a few seasons.<br><br>It's even easier these days since you don't have to deal with eyecancer-tier bright yellow hardsubs on shit-quality video.<br><br>Unless you stream, that is. Don't stream. It's bad for your eyes and your soul.<br><br><br><br><br>Clearly you weren't reading at a post-college level by the time you finished up middle school.<br><br>You guys really should do more casual reading. Even non-fiction is good enough. It's good for your mind and familiarity helps with speed/comprehension, which helps you better enjoy the art since you aren't spending 90% of each scene staring at the bottom 10% of the screen.<br><br>Usually I just flick my vision down to the sub track each time it swaps in new content, then let the words process in the background while I'm watching the scene. It works well, try it sometime. If nothing else, it can't be worse than your current method.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  <br>  too old to learn something  <br><br>Good excuse mate.</br></br></br>  <br>I watch it every time if I'm watching as it comes out. If I'm watching sequentially, I watch it the first few episodes and then start skipping when I get bored of it, and then watch it at climactic episodes or whatever. I get annoyed when I want to watch the ED on the final episode but they replace it with something else, though.</br>  <br>How many OPs were there?</br>  <br>  but they take the ability for someone who doesn't understand Japanese to get the subtleties. <br><br>I was talking about "take away" relative to just watching the raw without knowing Japanese. You lose nothing there with subs (except for some of the screen, you're right), and quite a bit with dubs, since they're replacing it with a translation, rather than supplementing it with one</br></br></br>  <br>I manage to read it and insert it into what I hear. I may read something before it is said, like, as you said, there is a pause and because of sentence structure, the suspense word in japanese that comes after, comes in the first part in english. <br><br>To me it's kind of like if you read something like a quote from a movie, and you hear it in the actors voice in your head, even though you read the whole thing before "hearing" it in your head, you forget about what you read and only consider what you "heard". For me it's kind of the same for subs at this point; I read it but I overlay that with what I'm hearing and match up some words I know the translation for to get emphasis and intonation.</br></br></br>  <br>b-but a parsec is a unit of distance...</br>  <br>Excuse me, are you insulting my power?</br>  I've always been a good reader so for things where the subs are completely mangled I'm still able to read them, reorganise what the fuck it's actually MEANT to say, and keep track of what's going on. It's not overly difficult.  <br>But between /a/ and anime, there's no time for reading. Unless it's manga.</br>    <br>Text takes up space, anon. Do you have any idea how much space 10000000000 googols of words in size 10 font takes up?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0lF<wbr>QOmb6mVs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>It's right up your ally if you like azumangah and nichijou. Same type of humor.</br>  Fuck you all for reminding me. Now I can't finish the show I'm watching without the realization that I'm focusing on the subs.  <br>Yeah, I get that, I think what we disagree on is that I believe this doesn't have to be a bad thing. I think Ghost Stories proves a dub can be a separate thing, an even BETTER thing, than the original. Taking away from the Japanese isn't bad if they give back just as much in English, as long as they aren't doing the kind of shit 4kids did.<br><br>I always get dual audio files when available, for the record. It doesn't have to be all dub or all sub, you can get both in one file for rewatches or comparisons.</br></br></br>  <br> casual reading <br>I'm only interested in hardcore reading.

Will KyoAni find a way  in S2/movie ?  <br> At school? she hand't seen it before? </br>  <br>Anon if you want to know about it just look up the old threads.</br>  <br>Yeah I remember being mentioned, but the full context for it was never given unfortunately.<br>Would you be kind enough to tell me? I'd appreciate it for eternity.</br></br>  <br>Probably wait for graduation, on the assumption. Doesn't Taki tell Reina something that leaves her all smiles, a possibility there. <br><br><br>I like your style.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just really happy that she finally got to tell him.</br></blockquote>]
