[ I've just finished reading Jojo Part 5, and what the fuck happened?<br><br>It sure did deliver on the "Bizarre" aspect of the title. Holy fucking shit.<br><br>Also, eventually I just had to give up entirely on understanding anything that was happening on every Bucciarati fight.<br><br>Anyway, I'd rank the parts up to now as:<br>4 = 3 &gt; 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 &gt; 1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gay Priest is here now.  <br> every Bucciarati fight <br>Are you sure you don't mean every Diavolo fight? Cause compared to King Crimson, Sticky Fingers' power makes total sense.</br></br>  <br>Have fun with 6. It's interesting having a girl MC in Jojo.<br> I just had to give up entirely on understanding anything that was happening on every Bucciarati fight. <br>He puts zippers on things. He can open them and separate things/open things. Fights are easy to understand when you know what the stands do.<br>Pic related.<br>Also the parts are 4=7&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3<br>8 excluded since it hasn't ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(Not OP) The one thing I never got about Sticky Fingers is why sometimes putting a zipper on things opening up some weird voidspace where you could hide stuff, and why sometimes the zipper would lead to the other side of the object. Does it depend on how thick the surface is? Is it based on which one would help Buccelati more at the time?</br>  <br>Oh, I just thought of another one. How come Buccelati can hide a cell phone in his own head, but splitting apart his heart is suddenly a problem?</br>  I just finished part 3<br>Why hasn't any Jojo had a brother or sister yet?</br>  I skipped part 5 till we get better translations/scans.  <br>Because then we'd have more than one MC. Don't worry though, you'll get your wish in Part 6. Giorno has a few half-brothers that show up working for Pucci.</br>  <br>Giorno has half-brothers<br>Johnny Joestar had a brother<br><br>I'd think he decides that when he uses the ability. Like he'd just think "I want the zipper to go all the way to the other side". Maybe it's based on how hard he hits the object. As in you can easily tell how much strength you need to lightly grab a balloon rather than gripping it so hard you pop it<br><br>The space isn't the actual inside the object, otherwise he couldn't hide in the person when he first means Giorno. Splitting your heart up means the parts can't function, he essentially cut his heart up and then sewed it back together.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but if he can hide inside someone and keep a phone in his head, why would dividing his heart up even be an issue. Aside from that one organ, dividing any other part of his body doesn't seem to matter, even if they'd be immediately vital, like the brain.</br>  <br> Dio <br> Holly <br> Ungalo, Rykiel, Donatello <br> Nicholas <br> Kira's sister in part 8 technically counts <br>Those are all the jojo siblings</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read part 5 in awhile but did he ever do something like take off his head? I pretty sure the reason is that the blood can't be pumped through his body and such and that's why it's an issue. The void inside the object may not be part of the object but if he unzips something the 2+ parts can't interact with the body.<br>I'm just making shit up as I go I'm not Araki so if my shits all retarded that's why.<br> the reason it's taking me so long to write up this shit is that I woke up 11hrs ago at 1am so I'm getting a lil tired </br></br></br>  <br>Not quite, Sticky Fingers had some weird elements to it, Like what exactly happens when he used the zipper on the ground? It wouldn't connect to anything, and Buccelatti did that a couple of times but it was never explained, Araki just drew a black hole inside it, are we supposed to assume its leads to some blank dimension Buccelati can just hang out before using his zipper somewhere else or what? Makes no sense really.</br>  <br>Except Dio isn't a blood sibling which is probably what  was asking, and Holly is so insignificant outside of being Part 3's damsel in distress that she doesn't really count.</br>  <br> 1 above anything <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>You're right, let me fix that.<br>4=7&gt;2&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3=1<br>To clarify part 6 is without the ending.<br>2&gt;1&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;3  <br>For anime only</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so</br>  <br>Zipper dimension dude. Remember he unzipped a bathroom and put a bunch of treasure in there before zipping it back up? No one can fucking get that treasure ever. They could demolish the fucking bathroom and he could sticky finger the area near the treasure and get that shit out. Sticky finger zipper man is the best thing in part 5.</br>  <br>Honestly, I read part 5 a while ago, and after finding out some of the memes about it, I was really confused on why people couldn't get what King Crimson did.<br><br>4&gt;5&gt;1&gt;3&gt;6&gt;2</br></br></br>  <br>If you're so enlightened, care to explain it in a way that covers all the weird shit like Buccelati seeing his past/future self?</br>  <br>King Crimson erases time, that's a given. The interactions of things during that time are also erased, and the only thing that remains after it is the movement that happens in it. Using Epitath, Diavolo can see into those ten second and use King Crimson accordingly.<br><br>The whole thing with Buccelati seeing his past/future self is  bizarre , and doesn't show up again if I remember right. The only way it would work is if Buccelati somehow saw the insides of Diavolo's bangs, which could honestly be something that happened.<br><br>This is all of course assuming that my memory is holding up in regards to VA.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He erases the cause but not the effect</br>  The final fight in part 5 really sucked. It's a shame because they built up Diavolo so much and King Crimson was a cool stand.  <br>I'm pretty sure he never actually uses it to kill someone, which he could if that was the case. Is there actually an instance where the effect remains?</br>  This fight was awesome as fuck.  <br>It was really anti-climactic, yeah. Really wish that GER wouldn't have been so strong as to curbstomp Diavolo like that. Just nullify the time erasure, and let Giorno and Diavolo fight it out in real time.</br>   all these niggas rating part 6 better that part 5 <br>/a/ is retarded, I'm not even surprised.</br>  <br>Part 5 is shit and Giorno is shit. I don't get why people think a different translation will make him seem like he was actually doing shit. Fucker didn't earn GER at all, he just lucked into that shit.</br>  <br>I know you are buttblasted by Jotaro fucking up,but part 6 is far more consistent and has a vastly better protagonist,villain and side characters than part 5.</br>  <br> better protagonist <br>No. Jolyne a shit, dumb protagonist and a whore<br><br> better villain <br>No. Diavolo is one of the best villains in the series<br><br> better side characters <br>Yes, that's true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone else fucking hate Karera  <br> No. Jolyne a shit, dumb protagonist and a whore <br>Doesn't matter, she's better than fucking "I have a dreeeam" Giorno. Unless you're talking about Bruno when you say part 5 protag, which I could see being better than Jolyne</br></br>  <br>Diavolo is as weak a character as can be.<br>He would be fine as a random villain, but it doesn't make any sense that the secret boss of the organization would be as insane as he is without losing all secrecy about his identity.</br></br>  <br> No. Diavolo is one of the best villains in the series <br>Literally retarded: the villain. Everything he does is fucking retarded,his whole behaviour is inconsistent and stupid. His only good trait is that he's sexy.</br></br>  <br><br>Diavolo is a fucking drug dealer and junkie. He's moved by greed and his addiction. There are many people like that in our world. I find him an awesome villain for that.</br></br>  <br> No. Jolyne a shit, dumb protagonist and a whore <br>Very nice arguments but Jolyne had to put up with a lot of insanely overpowered stands with a Hierophant-green tier stand. She's by far one of the most competent jojos and you're likely blaming her for the universe rewrite when it was entirely Jotaro's fault.</br></br>  <br>Eh he's not as good as Kira who is motivated by his fetish for hands on a beautiful dwang. There are many people like that in our world. I find him an unsettling villain for that.</br>  <br> She's by far one of the most competent jojos <br>I'll give you this. She sure knows how to use what she has.<br><br> and you're likely blaming her for the universe rewrite when it was entirely Jotaro's fault. <br>But this is straight bullshit. Not that anon, but there are more reasons to disliking her than just the universal rewrite. Jolyne faggots are honestly one of the biggest shitters in this entire fanbase, only being surpassed by meme posters.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Jotaro's fault Made in Heaven and even C-Moon were completely out of Stone Free's power to actually fight, Star Platinum was pretty much their only hope.</br>  <br>Did you even read the post? I don't care about the rewrite, I just don't like Jolyne as a character as much as I like almost anyone else in JoJo.</br>  <br><br>What? Is this opposite day? The side characters and stand fights are make part 5 better than 6.</br></br>  <br>Why would you hate Karera?</br>  <br> are we supposed to assume its leads to some blank dimension <br>Of course! Remember when they were chilling inside the turtle? It didn't have a bathroom so they used Sticky Finger to pee in the Unexplainable Zipper Dimension. They asked themselves where the pee was REALLY going and Buccelati briefly implied that it might give some nutrition to the turtle. Weird shit.</br></br>  <br>Everyone in Part 6 that's not Pucci, Dio's bastard sons, or Weather Report took a backseat to the plot once they got out of prison.</br>  <br>Okay?</br>  Anime-only fag here<br><br>2 &gt; 3 [Egypt Arc] &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 &gt;&gt; 1<br><br>Can ANYTHING top Roundabout as an ending theme?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly liked the fights from part 6 better than most of the part 5 fights.</br>  <br>Sure Close to the Edge as an opening theme.</br>  <br>Fuck off.<br>Gyro dies.</br></br>  <br>Even better, Jotaro dies.</br>  <br> 1 below 3 <br>Step up your game, son.<br><br>Jojo<br>1&gt;4&gt;5&gt;3&gt;2&gt;6<br><br>Brojo<br>5&gt;1&gt;3&gt;6&gt;4&gt;2<br><br>Stands<br>5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3<br><br>Fights<br>5&gt;4&gt;6&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1<br><br>Villain<br>4&gt;3&gt;6&gt;5&gt;1&gt;2<br><br>Story<br>4&gt;2&gt;1&gt;6&gt;5&gt;3<br><br>Overall<br>4&gt;5&gt;1&gt;3&gt;2&gt;6<br><br>In the middle of SBR, so can't say about post MIH.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hierophant-green tier stand <br>Are saying HG wasn't strong? Because he was and both stands are very useful. Jolyne getting around those enemies is a credit to her stands ability. Also C-moon and Mih is particularly powerful stands she fought.</br></br>  JoJo&gt;JoJo&gt;JoJo=JoJo&gt;JoJo&gt;JoJo&gt;JoJo  <br>This is a lot more indepth than just simple part rankings, I like it<br><br>Jojo<br>6 &gt; 2 &gt; 8 &gt; 7 &gt; 1 &gt; 4 &gt; 3 &gt; 5<br><br>Brojo (this means: Zeppeli, Caesar, Kakyoin, Okuyasu, Buccellati, Hermes, Gyro and Yasuho right?)<br>7 &gt; 6 &gt; 8 &gt; 2 &gt; 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 3 &gt; 1<br><br>Stands<br>6 &gt; 4 &gt; 5 &gt; 7 &gt; 8 &gt; 3<br><br>Fights<br>4 &gt; 7 &gt; 6 &gt; 2 &gt; 5 &gt; 8 &gt; 1 &gt; 3<br><br>Villain<br>4 &gt; 1 &gt; 7 &gt; 6 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 5<br><br>Story<br>6 &gt; 4 &gt; 7 &gt; 8 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 5<br><br>Overall<br>4 &gt; 6 &gt; 8 &gt; 2 &gt; 7 &gt; 1 &gt; 3 &gt; 5</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone likes part 6 a lot.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/7jfRnc0M15Y?t=1688<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Huehue.  Also there's a bit just before that one in the video with No Homo by The Lonely Island that was pretty funny </br></br>  <br><br>Alright then, in that case I guess it all came down to Araki's poorly managed powers, which is no surprise because if Sticky Fingers has a whole dimension to chill around you figure they'd use it way more and might be even better than a goddamn turtle prone to aging attacks. Or hell, sticky finger us the fuck outta this decaying town for all that matters...</br></br>  Does anyone have that edit of a page with Pucci and Dio where Dio is like "you know how the arrow gives people stands maybe if I fucked you you'd get powers?" and Pucci is like "do you have any idea how painful it would be for you to stick your spiked dick in me"  <br>It's weird because I prefer part 4, but part 6 has a lot of stuff which I prefer over it. But overall part 4 is a better experience, if that makes any sense</br>  Who will be the final boss of part 8  <br>Pucci</br>  <br>Has anyone actually tried making edits with both Diego and Part 6 Dio in the same picture?</br>  <br>you know, in retrospect, a lot of their issues could of been fixed, if they went into his dimension, unless it was specified only he can enter it.</br>    <br>But really do, can't people have more than one disk at the time inside them? Didn't emporio use Weather's disk while having his own stand? Couldn't Pucci just insert every goddamn disk into his own ass, or for that matter wouldn't Dio have had the idea of collecting does disk for his own use and having like 30 goddamn stands at once?</br>  Wow, exactly the kinda thread I was looking for<br><br>anyway<br><br>I heard that Part 5 has some really bad translatiosn<br><br>What's the best one to read?<br>I wouldn't mind downloading, but I'll use batoto if I have to<br> I'd prefer the colored versions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's on Batoto at the moment.</br>  <br> I'm afraid to check. I was hoping I could get spoonfed </br>  <br>You are. This is just baby steps.</br>  Part 5 is great because the fights are actually back and forth, like the enemies are on the defensive sometimes and need to figure out a counter to the protagonists stands  <br>Cheers m8</br>  <br>I think in that moment the discs of Weather and Burning Down the House swapped places and it didn't matter because both were inside.</br>  jojo<br>7 &gt; 6 &gt; 5 &gt; 4 &gt; 2 &gt; 1 &gt; 3<br><br>brojo<br>7 &gt; 5 &gt;4 &gt;3 &gt;2 &gt;6 &gt;1 <br><br>team<br>7&gt; 5&gt; 6&gt; 4&gt; 3&gt; 2&gt; 1<br>stands<br>5 &gt;7 &gt;6 &gt;8 &gt;4 &gt;3<br><br>fights<br>5 &gt;6 =7 &gt;4 &gt;2 &gt;3 &gt;1<br><br>villain<br>7 &gt;4 &gt;6 =5 &gt;1 &gt;2 &gt;3<br><br>Story <br>7 &gt;6 &gt;5 &gt;4 &gt;1 &gt;2 &gt;3<br><br>overall<br>7 &gt; 5=6 &gt;4 &gt;2 &gt;1 &gt;3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed how despairing most of the fights were, every enemy was a major threat.<br>It's also probably the least protag-centric part.</br></br>  <br>JoJo's Colored Adventure<br>JoJo Project<br>/a/nonymous<br>Ignition One</br></br></br></br>  Why doesn't Jojo's Colored Adventure update their download page?  <br>opening a zipper "creates space" the opposite of okuyasu<br><br>King Crimson is the one that gives people a little trouble since some things Diavolo does we only see the effects of, and not the process.<br><br>D4C from part 7 still kind of confuses me honestly</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Are you on the blogspot because iirc they only post downloads on facebook now.</br>  <br>Shit, time to make a facebook</br>  <br>You don't need to.</br>  <br> selling 3 short on fights. <br> ranking 8 yet. <br> 8 having better stands than 3 <br>Also dat bias for 4 and against 5.

The battle wouldn't start because "lolnope" wouldn't let Superman exist for an instant.</br>  <br>Some of PB's art look great, some look like dogshit. There's not much in between.</br>  <br>Is Superman Prime One Million basically SSJ 1 million? Cause if all it does is make him stronker, GER still wrecks his shit.</br>  <br>Mostly due to the fact that it is nostalgic, but also I liked the shading, even though the anatomy was shit the faces looked nice and certain pages looked really fucking good</br>  Is fightcade kill?  <br>Superman Prime is literally god.</br>  <br>Fightcade was never real.</br>  <br>And GER is beyond the reality that etches his fiction. GER is like the author's pen behind the Superman Prime mythos and pathos, as well any other character or place or thing you can imagine.</br>  <br>Yeah but GER is more then a god</br>  <br><br>They both have the abillity to bend reality to their will,though.</br></br>  <br>GER needs to punch Superman Prime so that its ability will work.</br>  <br>You'd rather have OC stands?  Not going to lie, some are pretty neat but most the time people just ctlr+v from the power generator </br>  <br>Okay, then answer this. Can Superman Prime shift pure universal binary from a one to a zero? If he truly could, why is his power still dependent on the sun? He could get deny that plot element entirely.<br><br>We don't know that, because GER's power was left unexplained by Araki. All we know about its limits is that GER is completely independent from Giorno and will protect him at all costs.</br></br></br>  <br>Won't win. To beat GER, you need to be at least as high as the Presence.</br>  Part 5 is remarkable for making Jojo make even less sense than normal...  <br>No, that's Part 6.</br>  <br>Diavolo should stick as a side character than a villian. Everything about him was cool, but let's be honest that he's nothing more than being evil for the sake of it. While reading as how secretive and smooth the team was in following his orders, by the end of the ride he's just leading them on a death sentence. He let his fears and arrogance get to him.<br>We never got to see other sides to him. Other villians like Kira, DIO and Kars we got to see how he interact with their minions and what they do aside from being cartoonishly evil because "muh god status/happiness." DIO had two-three parts solidifying his personality, Kira's life was displayed as side chapters (meanwhile, he's busy indulging with his hand fetish) and Kars respected his comrades despite being a dick to everyone. The only person Diavolo ever talks out of character on-screen is Dioppio, literally himself. We know how he got into power, but we never got to see it. His whole upbringing is just being born bad or raised abused as a child. Every other villian had their own reasons for their goals. Kars wanted to ascend his species on top of the food chain, DIO ravaged the world and finally realized he wanted to be happy and Kira just wants to live his life as he pleases. Diavolo wanting to put his own drug on the market for mere greed pales in comparison and him not being around until the last arc makes him have less presence than the others.</br></br>  meppz are you here  <br>And above all, he's not entertaining or charismatic enough as the rest of them.</br>  <br>You can fucking kill yourself.</br>  <br>The good thing about Diavolo were his scenes where it didn't involve the main cast, but most of the other villains had better moments like that as you said, so yeah, Diavolo isn't a lot of people's favorite villain because he's  a shit </br>  Remainder that a twelve year old boy being a dick to another twelve year old boy resulted in the literal end of the world  Could DIO beat John Cena?  <br>Do you think that Sports Maxx killed John Cena so he can be invisible?</br>  I found decisive evidence that jojo is gay  <br>And if he wasn't a dick the world would be ruled by Aztec gains gods.</br>  <br>You have to do better than a website concerning a subject matter that half of its supporters deny that it's gay.</br>  <br>They would've never woken up if it wasn't for Straizo.</br>  Please remember  <br>Post someone that's more forgettable, like Caesar.</br>  <br>I have the worst taste.<br>  5 = 3 &gt; 2 = 1 &gt; 4 &gt; 6 &gt; 7  </br></br>  <br>indeed you do</br>  <br>Please remember</br>  <br>You have the best fucking taste</br>  <br>That's the stuff.  A goddamn Nazi. </br>  ホット・パンツ<br>ット<br>・<br>パ<br>ン<br>ツ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jonathan's a man from start to finish was that of a gentleman through and through. All the other Jojos have a flaw being an asshole to those gave them a bad impression. Jonathan's good nature as pure good is refreshing in comparison and only a small portion of this good nature is passed on to every Jojo. In a way, you can appreciate him like fine wine. I'm not saying he's the best but definitely not the worst. Not every character has to be a smug. clever and dashing rogue. Less is more.</br>  <br>That shit is all sorts of jumbled</br>  4&gt;6(almost finished reading)&gt;2&gt;3&gt;1&gt;5<br>fuck part 5<br>such a slog trying to get past it so I could see Jolyne's glorious body</br></br>  <br> the shortest and best part <br> "slog" <br> "slogging" <br>fuck you too faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can understand why people prefer 4 and 7 over all my favorites;<br>But why is 5 hated ? and what is so great about 6 ? It had a lot of plothole that ruined it for me.</br></br>  <br>He's the pure good to Dio's pure evil.</br>  <br><br>i hated 6<br><br>i think. I honestly don't remember what i thought before other than that it was really fucking bizarre, but if i had a part i wouldn't want to reread, it would be part 6</br></br></br></br>  <br> liking 6 just because of waifuism <br>you are an insult to fans of stone ocean</br></br>  <br>You aren't alone.<br>6 made me stop reading. And I started reading at 3   after watching 1 and 2 in anime   and I read Part 3 to the end of 5 in one streak.<br>It shows how much I hate 6.</br></br></br>   <br>I'm not a fan of giorno but I never got the complaints about him and jotaro. It seems like if they aren't cracking jokes all the time people claim they have no personality. Calm collective and determined is still a personality even if it isn't exciting to read about.</br>  <br>Giorno isn't the best character in his own group, that's either Mista or Bruno, and the story isn't benefited by possibly the worst villain, albeit he has a cool stand. Plus GER doesn't do the story any real favors, and the fact that Gold Experience has a shit ton of useful powers at the beginning which are never used again, like "overflowing life" or reflecting normal shit (which GER took to an absolute extreme). It does have cool fights, I personally enjoyed Mista's train antics with the "build up kinetic energy" stand, but overall it falls to other parts in most departments</br>  <br>I thought the whole "sees past/future self" thing was how Araki initially wanted to show how KC's "erasing" time. If, for whatever passes for 10 seconds is KC's weird dimension, there was no time, there'd be little to no distinction between past and future. Buccelati saw ghostly images of himself as a result of this. I'm assuming this effect would only apply to stand users while they had their stands out. I'm also assuming that one can only see oneself in the past/future because otherwise Diavolo would be giving a huge advantage to everyone else when he used KC's power. Perhaps an early version of Epitaph was for Diavolo/Doppio to see EVERYTHING (or select parts of it) this way without actually doing the time warp again.<br><br>Then none of this ever showed up again because lol Araki forgot.</br></br></br>  <br> 5 best at anything <br>come on man<br><br> waifuism <br>I wouldn't say that<br>While I like Jolyne's design, the part would be nothing without the good fights. Some of the later ones like Underworld, the one that made people only remember 3 things and the green baby were pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why we say that King Crimson just works.</br>  <br> 5 <br> not the best fights <br>I love underworld but that end was ruined by bullshit</br></br></br>  <br> Caesar as good as Okuyasu </br>  <br> Villain <br> 2 </br></br>  <br>but you're missing out on the later parts which are good imo<br><br>if you're salty about the ending you can easily think your way out of that feeling. it's what I did. Just because certain characters died doesn't mean what they did didn't happen, just like in real life. Araki already forgets characters and never does anything with them in later parts, and it's more or less true that when he brings them back they suck  because plot armor lost </br></br></br>  <br> Not liking ween ween </br>  <br>I'm not mad because they died, I'm mad because Part 1 to 6 has no fucking impact and feel completly pointless after reading Part 6's end.</br>  Part 4 anime never  <br>Sometimes things in life don't mean anything. Are you really so autistic that you think every story has to have lasting repercussions to be valid? Nothing that happened in Part 6 made anything that happened in parts 1-5 less valid or awesome. You can even go back and read them again if you want. Araki wanted to end the Jonathan plotline, and he did. If you read SBR instead of complaining on /a/ you'd understand</br>  <br>"WHERE ARE YOURE PANTS.....?"<br>"i took them offbecause i was banging your mom for a minute there jostar......"</br></br>  <br>this is exactly what I was saying, it doesn't mean that there wasn't any meaning.

Not only that, but I also want her to show the girls their sex tape when they get together one time.<br>Their sex tape would be one of the most genuine with the most amount of sexual frustration and sexual debauchery:<br><br>(1/3)<br><br> Haruno begins by giving 8man the most amazing foreplay of his pathetic life. She starts by roughly pushing 8man to the wall of their room and then proceeds to whisper nothing but dirty talk into his ear while gently stroking his hachi through his pants. She progresses to a long session of deep kissing by sucking on his tongue and uses their saliva as lubricant to further indulge in their passion for each other. <br><br> 8man breaks and he wants to be the more dominant of the two, but Haruno only reacts by pushing him to the bed and mischievously states that she will the dominant one in here. <br><br> They continue to kiss each other, but now that Haruno is on top of him, 8man feels the greater stimulus of her boobs pressing against his chest with all her weight on him. With 8man's genuine rod roaring to be released, Haruno unzips his pants and unleash the 8incher in all its glory. <br><br> She gently teases his dick with an impish smile and then kisses the tip while stroking his shaft with both hands. She moves on to using her tongue all over his shaft in a manner analogous to sealing a mail letter. Finally, Haruno deepthroats the 8incher in one go while looking at him the whole time with a naughty expression. 8man, unable to resist Haruno' playfulness, announces that he is about to cum, however, he is only met with Haruno grabbing him by his balls and saying, "not yet, not before I get to feel good with this 8incher inside of me". </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(2/3)<br><br> Haruno then takes her completely soaked panties off and makes 8man sniff them and lick them while she watches his throbbing cock scream for physical contact. She watches 8man’s expression in awe and realizes that he is completely enveloped in the stimulus brought upon by her panties. She teasingly laughs and gets excited to see his cock jumping from the anticipation of physical contact. <br><br> Shortly after, she straddles his dick with her pussy and uses his precum and her own juices as lubricant to comfortably take the 8incher. After making sure that it's lubricated enough, she rides the 8incher while she whispering how big his dick is and how good it feels. Those whispers then turn to gently bites on his ear and quickly proceed to rough hickeys throughout his neck and upper chest. Haruno and 8man orgasm at the same time and they just deeply stare into each other’s eyes without saying a word; they take a moment to enjoy the pleasure of their drug-like induced orgasm. <br><br> After coming back to reality, 8man falls on Haruno’s chest and she praises 8man by telling him how she loves his thick and warm loads. <br><br> 8man gets hard again and finally finds an opportunity to be the dominant one. 8man switches spots with her and gets on top of her. He forcibly grab her by both of her wrists and Haruno's only reply to this turn of events is: "did I finally break you to the point where I actually feel like being the submissive one?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(3/3)<br><br> 8man’s animalistic instincts materialize and he tongue fucks her again while he penetrates deeply inside of her. Haruno’s answer to this new position does not come through words but by body language and body fluids. Her body convulses like never before and she squirts all over the bed making it look as if a small child wet their bed sheets. Haruno comes back to her senses, but is unable to make a single coherent sentence. 8man proceeds to shut her gibberish by caressing her slender throat in one hand while grabbing her wet tongue with the other. <br><br> After she stops having her wild orgasms, 8man starts thrusting his dick with slow, long strokes back into her pussy; Haruno comes again in no time due to her sensitivity. 8man stops for a couple of seconds and is quickly ready for another round. However, Haruno tries to get away from 8man by pushing him off and tries to crawl away from him to rest for a bit. <br><br> 8man's swiftly grabs Haruno’s weak calves and roughly pulls her closer to him. He puts Haruno on a rear naked choke while whispering how good it feels inside of her. Haruno is unable to do anything besides biting the bed sheets mix her and 8man’s fluids. 8man continues to fuck her until the both of them orgasm again. <br><br> After their long session, both of them are stare at the ceiling in a trance-like manner and they enjoy the pleasure of their debauchery while breathing heavy. Haruno then rests her head on his shoulder and whispers how much of a monster he was tonight. She jokingly states that he is no longer a monster of logic, but a monster of sex. <br><br> Both of them fall asleep and try to recharge their energy and restore their body fluids for tomorrow's morning sex. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Did anyone save the Haruno fic someone wrote before, where it included her taking a pic with 8man and posting it on her social media  <br><br><br>It is hard to keep my boner contained.

Reverse search gives me nothing.</br>  <br>Something along those lines. I will finish writing their conclusion later but that's the gist of it.</br>  <br><br>This was the only thing I found:<br><br> The gardens were green and full of flowers. There were stone steps and bamboo walls that resembled the gardens in the old capital like some forgotten temple for blown off course onto Chiba. <br><br> Yukinoshita Haruno led the way. <br><br> It was only now, following her brisk short steps, that I noticed what she was wearing. Elegant and colorful, with a cool blue kimono that appeared a softer shade in the moonlight. Her hair was bound up, and being behind her I was given an exquisite view of her pale nape. <br><br> For a while, we said nothing. Then we turned a corner. <br><br> In an instant, she pulled me close, the distance between our lips were nearly zero. <br><br> I'll admit, for a moment my heart fluttered. <br><br> "You know Hikigaya-kun… when a girl asks a man to be alone with him… there are always other motives." Her breath was sweet. Her skin was smooth, and without pores. It looked ethereal in the pale moonlight. <br><br> I gulped. <br><br> Her hand was pressed against my chest. The scent of her air was causing my mind to wander. <br><br> Flash. <br><br> Huh? What? <br><br> "Oh wow! This is a great picture!" Haruno-san giggled to herself. In her free hand, she held her phone that now possessed a picture of myself and her. If anyone else saw it without the proper context they'd definitely get the wrong idea. <br><br> "H-hey now…" <br><br> "Wow! This is going to go on my Twitter…" <br><br> "That's a bit much… no…" I tried reaching for her phone. I just wanted to hold onto it long enough to delete it. <br><br> "There, there, don't be such a prude," Haruno-san smiled. "Aren't men supposed to be happy they are taking pictures with lovely women? Or perhaps you aren't into women…? Or maybe you think I'm an old onee-chan that's too withered for you, eh? Eh?" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The self-deprecating humor suited her as the flower patterns on her bosom blossomed with each jest. It appeared that Haruno-san was a master of masks, able to take any form she so desired or needed. The garden was her natural habitat, full of tall grass and plants, that hides the viper that is her beneath. <br><br> "I just think people might get the wrong idea here…" I said looking around, worried I was getting caught up in her rhythm. If things continued at this pace, I think the situation could become irreversible. <br><br> The woman didn't pay attention to me as she fiddled with her phone. <br><br> "Voila! Uploaded! I'm going to be Twitter famous," Haruno-san giggled to herself. "Aren't you excited Hikigaya-kun? You'll be known as the latest and only in my list of lovers…" <br><br> "Latest… wait, only? Does that mean you've never-?" <br><br> A finger silenced my lips. <br><br> "Feel special now, don't you?" She tucked the phone away into her carry-on bag and walked away to the beat of her own drum. She was happy. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>my dick<br><br> making it look as if a small child wet their bed sheets <br>best line</br></br></br></br></br></br>  See this<br>What do?</br>  <br> Yo'sup <br>and then I walk back out to go find best girl</br></br>  <br> walk back out to go find best girl <br>But then you'd go outside, immediately turn around and go back inside.

We see people from 2-F, including a Yumiko holding in her tears.  <br><br>  We see Iroha giving birth to a boy in the hospital with Hayato with his dumbass smile. <br><br>  Two years later, we're at the Hayama mansion. <br><br>  "Iroha, you're going out? Don't worry, I'll take care of our son. Say hi to Yukino, Yuigahama, and Hikigaya for me." <br><br>  "Thanks! You're the best husband and father. Will do." <br><br>  Hayato monologue time. Hmm, I'm glad I took time off from work so Iroha has been going out to socialize lately. She's been really down last year, and I don't like that she has been taking all of those depression pills. <br><br>  Minutes later. What's this? Iroha left her phone. Better call Yukino and let her know. <br><br>  "Hey Yukino? It's me, Hayato. Can you let me know when Iroha's done hanging out with you guys? I'll pick her up with my car." <br><br>  "Huh? Iroha-san? I haven't seen her since the baby shower." <br><br> "W--what? But hasn't she been hanging out with the old Service Club gang? Hikigaya-kun dropped her off home a few times." <br><br>  A fuck ton of flashbacks. <br><br>  Looks at his son. Notices his hair has been growing pretty fast. Might need a haircut. Wait a second... <br><br>  Has an ahege. <br><br> Haven't done one of these in a while. Sorry if it sucks. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Irohafags are NTRfags <br>shit taste confirmed</br></br>  <br> Iroha and Komachi on the top 2 <br>Surprisingly good taste in this fanbase.</br></br>  <br>Saika without doubt</br>  <br><br>komachi a perfect</br></br>  <br>Your first line had me vomiting.<br>By the end I was still gagging but I still don't know what to make of it.</br></br>  <br>Why are you even bother when the Irohafag is going to proxy the poll anyway</br>    <br>KomachIroha a best girls</br>  <br>Now this is rich.<br>You can't even accept that people like Iroha.</br></br>  Every thread until I'm bored.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ] <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm264<wbr>84384<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PNK<wbr>sCa9Pwgg</wbr>  [ ] <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm220<wbr>75326<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3QZ<wbr>7x1t2iB4</wbr>  [ ] <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lij<wbr>swIzQC9c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jej<wbr>Myfs5K0E</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> http://animaru.jp/shop/e/eoregaiu/<wbr></wbr> <br> Saika's daki sold out before YY does  <br><br>YYfags BTFO</br></br></br></br>  OTP  <br>Saika's daki is a limited release.</br>  <br>OTP</br>  <br> 数量に限りがあります。 <br> There is a limited quantity. <br>Sorry your waifu didn't even warrant a limited run daki, Irohafag.</br></br></br>  <br>It's limited, retard<br>Typical Irohafag<br> inb4 &gt;falseflagging this hard </br></br></br>  <br>That's not Zaimokuza</br>  <br>OTP</br>  OTP  <br>Megu Megu Megurin Megurin~ Power!</br>  <br><br>a best<br><br>A BEST</br></br></br></br>  <br>Truly the greatest miracle of this series.</br>  <br><br><br>Meguri-senpai will always be in our hearts!</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> tfw 8man isn't into older girls <br> blatantly ignores his cute as fuck senpai instead of going after her <br>you fucked up 8man</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she deserves happiness (not the cunt)</br>  <br>They should have done more with her ruined makeup.<br>She looks nothing like a panda here.</br></br>  <br>It's alright, anon. 8man just has shittaste.</br>      <br>I like the first one, the others are mediocre at best.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> all these OTPs <br> none are the only true OTP <br>I am disappointed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Yuckynofag.</br>  <br>You got the wrong Yukinoshita, anon.</br>  Does anyone actually like Yukino?

This would be the girls’ conclusion to watching the tape:<br><br>The tape ends, but instead of a black screen they are met with a picture of Haruno’s smug face. The three girls are left speechless. Yui’s and Yukino’s face depict nothing but absolute horror; it’s as if they just witnessed the most horrific live murder ever shown to humankind. Iroha’s face demonstrates admiration and jealously, but she diligently takes notes of 8man’s sexual likes.<br><br>Haruno thanks them for watching something so dear to her and proceeds to tell them that she has to go because she is running late to her date with 8man. She explains how frustrated the both of them have been because they have not been able to see each other due to Haruno’s busy life with her family.<br><br>As she says her goodbyes, Yukino tries to stand up to stop her from her rendezvous with 8man but her knees are too weak (for multiple reasons) and she falls to the floor. Haruno leaves and the girls are left dumbstruck.<br><br>After calming down, Yukino and Yui get their 8man facemask and find the biggest cucumber in their fridge and use it as a strap-on. Meanwhile, Iroha practices the kisses that she saw in the sex tape with double YY and they have the most explosive sex while screaming their respective nicknames for 8man.<br><br> I wish I could edit my posts, I had a lot of stupid grammar mistakes in the fanfic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Glasses Yukino &gt; Twintail Yukino &gt; Shitty Normal Yukino</br></br>  <br> my love comedy is wrong as expected <br><br> False <br><br>Am I the only one who has noticed this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, nobody else in the history of the world noticed it.</br>  <br>It was only wrong in the beginning because he made it go another direction.</br>  <br> http://strawpoll.me/5057196 <br><br>Hahahahaha!

For some reason, Yuigahama was the one who took it. <br><br> “I-I’ll do it for you!” She started digging out rice from the wooden container with gusto, humming as if she thought this was all fun and games. “Here you go!” <br><br> Oh wow. She whipped me a mountain of rice that wouldn’t look out of place in a Japanese folklore tale. Well, whatever. I was thinking of eating another serving, so I wasn’t complaining. “Thanks…” <br><br> With great solemnity, I let the bowl fall on my wrists and held it over my head in worship. Only then did I start eating a second time. <br><br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>Just what kind of poison did Yui put in 8man's rice bowl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just fuck already, it's clear to everyone that you're both tsundere for eachother.</br></br>  <br>She tried to slip in some pseudo love potion.<br><br>Real answer: <br>His previous bowl had natto, seaweed flavouring and a raw egg.<br>He didn't like it so plain rice was better.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Oh man, it's been a while since I last went there since I don't need the TLs either.<br>Seems like he changed the layout, huh.

They strike me as the type of people that get triggered by NTR threads and shitpost on them, read vanilla exclusively and behave like insecure cucks that always go for the most beta girl since in their mind such a character is the only one capable of "pure" love.<br>This is merely a hypothesis, mind you.</br></br>  <br>Shiromeguri and Ebina needs more love.</br>  <br>Megurin is too pure for this threads.</br>  <br>She has a decent reason to be a bitch to YY2.<br>She's very insecure and has abandonment issues.<br><br>She hates Yukino because she has a history with Hayama she doesn't know the details of.<br>She's afraid of Hayama being taken away from her.<br><br>She finds out Yui started skipping out on their girl time to go spend time with Yukino.<br>She's afraid of Yui being taken away from her.<br><br>She knew Yui was going to have lunch with Yukino, but couldn't outright state her insecurities.<br>So she decided to stall and play dumb, but came off bitchy.<br><br>She tried to get along with the service club by playing tennis with them, when Yukino wasn't there.<br>They didn't let her join in on their reindeer games, so she had to try to force her way in.<br>She even offered to practice with Saika, if she won.<br>She never said that she wouldn't let them help out too.<br><br>Also putting Haruno at the bottom clearly shows you need their character and intentions spelled out for you to appreciate them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My problem with Haruno is that she needs to fuck off, or in less edgy terms, stop fucking with high school kids too much. I get it, she's a worried Onee-san that cares about her imouto, and is going 8man style about it. Why the need to treat people like her personal clowns?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128740813 <br>Oh also, about Miura; being a cuntblocker to Iroha without making moves on the cunt and mocking Saki without knowing why she even wanted to make chocolates.</br>  <br>I smell an NTRfag pretending he's better than anybody.</br>  <br>I have a theory Haruno didn't actually start fucking with Yukino like that until she met 8man; she used to lightly tease her like during the mall date.<br><br>She sees how much 8man can get shit done by being an asshat, during the Culture Festival. She also knows 8man has gotten closer to Yukino than she has in years, so she tries to emulate him.<br><br>She becomes the villain in 8man's stead because she doesn't want Yukino to lose her friends. She even tries to brace Yui for her eventual jealousy and make her keep in mind to make choices where Yui wouldn't hurt herself or Yukino too badly.<br><br>8man and Shizuka are the only ones who understand what she's doing, but don't really accept her methods either.<br><br>I'm going to go through the LN's again for various other reasons, but I want to confirm her character development.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have a theory Haruno didn't actually start fucking with Yukino like that until she met 8man <br>Problem is we've had at least a couple scenes in 9 and 10 that indicate Haruno has always been a terror to Yukino, and probably Hayama to a lesser extent.</br></br>  <br><br> Nice first experiences that totally happened during elementary school. <br><br>They are still first experiences. First crush, first time holding hands with a boy, first time kissing a boy. Age does not change a thing.<br><br> More like didn't bother to stand up for her so she decided to do it herself by becoming better than everyone else. <br><br>More like the rejection fucked with her so much that she developed an inferiority complex and always tried to match her sister in order to make the cunt like her.<br><br> She was cold towards Yui during this part because Yui was being a slut talking about how embarrassing it is to be a virgin while Yukino says placing importance on losing it is completely stupid. <br><br>Of course Yukino says that it's stupid, she can't relate to it.<br><br> She gave those exact same chocolates to Haruno before starting grade school. <br><br>I'm assuming you are not a retard and that you have heard of double standards before, right? Giving chocolates to your dear older sister and to a boy, who also happens to be your crush, and the same age as you is not the same thing.<br><br>Instead of insulting Yui and making a fool out of yourself, you should probably read what you type before posting. Besides, the fact that she is concerned about being a virgin and how embarrass she gets when she talks about it just further emphasizes her innocence, especially when she is still a virgin albeit the fact that she could literally pick any guy from the school (besides 8man) to lose her virginity with. <br><br>I know that realizing that your waifu is beyond used goods is a hard pill to swallow, but you have to accept it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> giving chocolate when you're 3 makes you beyond used goods <br>This is what Irohafags actually believe</br></br>  <br><br> age doesn't matter <br><br>not even that guy but you know there's reason why you're more held liable for the choices you make as an adult right? same logic here, she isn't even as matured nor has experience anything before.<br><br>as for your other points, they all revolve around baseless assumptions. <br><br> she can't relate to it <br>are you serious? she said it's normal to be a virgin at their age, not that I have anything against Yui but she was literally the only one making a big deal out of it. she calls it stupid because she thinks it's trivial.<br><br><br> double standards <br>calm down pre-edgelord 8man, stop misinterpreting kindness for flirting<br><br> tried to match her sister in order to make the cunt like her <br><br>are you serious? is that why she has never showed any heed to him throughout the novel?<br><br>obvious bait is obvious but i'll bite anyway</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's also pretty ironic since Iroha gave chocolate to Hayama before she gave them to 8man too<br><br>Who knows how many countless guys got chocolate from her before</br></br></br>  <br>She and Yumiko forced Hayama to try their chocolates, so technically neither have given him chocolates on V-day that we know of yet.<br>He'd have turned them down, he said he never accepts chocolates <br> anymore because Yukino put her blood, spit, and pubes in the chocolates she gave to him years ago to make him fall in love with her <br><br>She let 8man try the chocolates first.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3-5 year old <br> pubes <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br> pubes  <br> 3 years old <br>Trying too hard?</br></br></br>  <br>We literally saw Hayama eat the chocolate retard, of course he had it<br>Also<br> pubes </br></br></br>  <br>Obligatory <br> pubes </br></br>  <br>Unrelated question, but did you have pubes at 3 years old?

Why don't I just break her heart completely wouldn't that just solve the problem?"<br>He wouldn't hate Yui just because Iroha can't handle her.<br><br> Mall date was on a Sunday. School rules states students must wear their uniforms, when going out to protect their purity? <br> Or Iroha is poor and that's her only decent outfit because she's poor and 8man decided to wear his too so she wouldn't feel bad. <br>That doesn't really fly with the way Yui, Komachi, 8man, and Yukino were dressed during the animal expo, and the Iroha dressed in Vol11.<br><br> She knows Yukino has no friends because of her shit attitude and wants to seduce this half-decent guy with 8/8 looks to befriend her loser sister. <br>That doesn't work either since Yukino isn't in the club, the reason she's alone in the club most of the time is because her classmates tend to annoy her, without having her place to be alone she's constantly approached.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Iroha dressed in Vol11. <br>The way Iroha dresses in 10.5.<br> Fuck I'm tired. </br></br></br>  <br>Sure. I just really wanted a way to keep Haruno in the story.<br><br><br>I never said he hates Yui, it's just she's putting Iroha under diress.<br>He already rejected Yui and maybe breaking her heart to protect Iroha will help Yui get over her crush and she can grow as character.<br><br>Also it's a fanfic anon. A couple people like the Iroha poorfag shit. I'm pandering to Irohafags since it's an Iroha fanfic.<br><br>Yukino can join the go home club and eat her lunch on the rooftop or in the restroom to avoid people.<br><br>I'll compile this shit and actually try to write it out half-decently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to add that since Haruno knows the name Hikigaya because of the car accident, she probably knows he is going to the same highschool. <br><br>She could casually ask him about Yukino thinking she wouldn't be so autistic and forget to apologize to the one she ran over and be surprised by 8man's answer since they never talked before and how he sees through her façade</br></br></br>  <br> He already rejected Yui and maybe breaking her heart to protect Iroha will help Yui get over her crush and she can grow as character. <br>I doubt jabbing the knife then twisting it really helps anyone, just because Yui wants to eat ice cream with her this somehow causes Iroha to cry out to 8man.<br>This just seems really weird.<br><br><br> Yukino can join the go home club and eat her lunch on the rooftop or in the restroom to avoid people. <br>Rooftop is off limits according to Yumiko and she isn't that autistic to resort to that just to be alone.<br>Since she never joined the club she never sought any need to save people her whole "noblesse oblige" does not exist.<br>That would mean she is by all means just the Ice Queen, she would've either been surrounded by those girls that idolized her or she would've have sought any of the "loner locations" which 8man knows all about.<br><br>But eh, it's fanfiction and I have an autistic sense for crap like this,  sorry. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Iroha breaks into tears and rambles on about how Yui is being sulky and trying to get her to go out and eat lots of icecream(Iroha can't go out unless someone else is treating her and Yui is not a desperate boy) <br> &gt;His onii-chan instincts kick in, he devises a plan to pretend to go on a date with Iroha and act all affectionate to make Yui leave the club(A skill he uses quite often, when he goes out with Komachi to ward off boys) <br><br> Iroha is a manipulative bitch even in her own fan fiction </br></br></br></br>  Stop talking about that shitty OoC fan fiction.<br>You were fueling him.</br>  <br>Ok, let's talk about Sensei's panties color, then.</br>  <br>It helps make the story more consistent, so thanks editor-kun.<br><br>Well let's just say 8man also rationalized turning Yui's sadness into hatred would make her more productive. (Fuck Terminator 3 was bad)<br><br>I'm going to reread Azumanga Daioh and try to make Yukino like-able by giving her some of Sakaki's traits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What panties? </br>  <br>Visiting other boards is one of the best ways to learn what kills a board.</br>  <br>Are you retarded why do you think she wears the labcoat? because she want to hide dem pantylines on her tight ass <br><br><br>Color?

How people can even vote for her is beyond me.</br>  <br> Iroha finds Yui extremely annoying and hard to handle <br>Nice projecting, considering Yui is the person Iroha gets along best with after 8man.<br><br>This shit just keeps getting more and more out of character, you really need to reign in your Iroha-boner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she gives him MAX COFFEE™</br>    <br>There was a new season of anime and back then I would just watch everything new that came out.</br>  <br>To be fair, there's a reason why she has no friends and she is shunned. However, I wouldn't go as far as to say she finds Yui extremely annoying, but a bit hard to handle after 8man's "rejection".<br><br>Anyway, if you don't like his fanfic, just don't read it.

A girl who tells him I like you go out with me. Not hehehe ebin I would go out with you or M-MUH I don't really like you, you know?! Watari you fuck. Just add a honest cute girl in this fucking shit.  <br> Why won't Watari write a series without conflict?! What a hack! </br>  Yukino is the biggest liar  <br>And another pasta was born</br>  <br> “If wishes could be fulfilled, then I wouldn’t wish for anything. The things you’re handed on a silver platter are never genuine or everlasting. And that is why I will always keep searching.”  <br>That would be so easy he wouldn't even believe her.</br></br>  <br>I wish Yukino was a loli</br>  <br>Bit she still is, in a way.</br>  <br>She's actually a good leader according to her class but she started falling under pressure, was overshadowed by Yukino's superior leadership, then pretty much twisted by Haruno.<br><br>And she did apologize for acting like a bitch towards them.</br></br></br>  <br>His logic is flawed. In a relationship, one always ends up chasing after the other. Only in a fairytale would two people fall in love with each other at the same time.</br>  <br><br>Here.<br>By the way, didn't someone talk about YYx2 Friday threads?<br>Is it still on?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on if the BTBs are still going on the day in question<br><br>But then we could just borrow from the Irohafag playbook and report the current thread to get it deleted</br></br></br>  What the hell Yaharifags, why aren' t you dead yet?<br><br>  I don't want to be alone.

I doubt he could've done any different if he wasn't one back then. Even so, Hayato keeps on insisting that fact that they couldn't have been friends.<br><br>As you can see, Hayato and Haruno are in the same syndicate. They might just be worried about Yukino's well being and if Hachiman can really give her genuine.</br></br></br></br>   harem animes <br><br> inb4 yahari isn't a harem </br></br>  <br>Yes, YY Fridays still on<br>Hoping for the thread to die is unrealistic so we'll see what will happen</br></br>  <br>W-When is the full colored version coming out?</br>  <br>Yahari isn't an  anime. <br> :^) </br></br>  <br>Yahari is a love triangle, not a harem</br>   drama the anime <br><br>Why is watari such a fucken hack?

The last bit of volume 9 especially stands out since it prominently featured Yui smoothing things over between Iroha and Yukino (one of the people she really has issues dealing with)</br>  <br>I'll bite<br> NTR <br>I don't see 8man getting butthurt over it.<br>Faggots who actually voted for the NTR tags are cucks like you.<br><br>You don't like seeing girls getting deepthroated to the verge of tears?<br>You don't like seeing girls forcing their female friends to orgasm?<br>You don't like seeing girls fucked so hard they wet themselves?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she finally got the femininity she always wanted.<br>Slut.</br></br>  <br>Yui smoothes things between Yukino and Iroha because she doesn't want them to fight. However, their relationship is shallow<br><br> “Okay, okay, so about making that free newspaper, why don’t you go look up how to make it first? Try asking some people with the know-how and get their help… After that, we can make it together with you!” <br> “You’re so kind, Yui-senpai!” Isshiki made an elated smile when Yuigahama addressed her warmly. But after careful examination of her words, Yuigahama was certainly kind, but she was actually saying to “come back another time.” <br><br>She literally told her to fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you know what the word "literally" means.</br>  What is a "coming-of-age" picture?<br><br>Also could it be that Iroha didn't show the picture by accident but rather a declaration of war?</br></br>  <br>Get with the times gramps.</br>  <br>I'd say there's an argument for it that that's the closest your average japanese person could get to saying "fuck off" but he's still clearly exaggerating because of his personal bias. The goal of the service club is "teach a man to fish" after all, and not playing emergency labor force for the StuCo.</br>  <br> The goal of the service club is "teach a man to fish" after all <br>Somehow I don't think they're doing a very good job of that.</br></br>  <br>Retards defending incorrect use of their language.<br><br>Your a retard</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for trying to defend me but you misued "Your" there.<br><br>You should have used "You're" and you forgot a period at the end of your sentence.</br></br></br>  <br>literally<br>adverb lit·er·al·ly \ˈli-tə-rə-lē, ˈli-trə-lē, ˈli-tər-lē\<br>Definition of LITERALLY<br>1<br>: in a literal sense or manner : actually &lt;took the remark literally&gt; &lt;was literally insane&gt;<br>2<br>: in effect : virtually &lt;will literally turn the world upside down to combat cruelty or injustice — Norman Cousins&gt; <br><br><br>Take it up with Merriam-Webster, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wretched philistines.</br>  <br> "teach a man to fish" <br>That's not my point but how she didn't tell her directly that they didn't want to help her</br></br>  <br>She wasn't she was telling her to research how to make it to see exactly how hard it is.<br>The service club didn't want to do it because they've already experienced it when they made the wedding article.</br></br>  <br>So your point is Yui is a bitch because she turns Iroha away in the same way most Japanese people would?</br>  <br> But after careful examination of her words, Yuigahama was certainly kind, but she was actually saying to “come back another time.” <br><br><br>No, if you read carefully you would know that my point is they are not as close as it may seem</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Not that close" isn't remotely the same thing as "doesn't get along" and the scene is only questionable evidence of the former and says nothing at all as to the latter.</br>  <br>Yui is just a bitch in general</br>  <br>You're the reason I come to these threads Irohanon.</br>  <br>Imouto a best.</br>  <br>Oh yes.</br>  What if Yukino became such a moeblob because her and Yumiko finally got along?<br>She no longer has any enemies, she has no need for the Ice Queen act anymore.</br>  <br>Yumiko isn't her only enemy though</br>  <br>Maybe not but she's the only one we've seen that would bring out the worst in Yukino.</br>  <br>Do we seriously have this many posters around?</br>  <br>Multiple choice + lurkers</br>  Isn't 8man an asshole for leading the girls on and telling them to pursue their feelings regardless if it hurts them but then denies they exist?  Would it bother Yui if 8man was with another woman?  <br>He knows about Yui's feelings, not Yukino's.<br>He doesn't believe he's misleading Yukino because he doesn't believe there's anything there for him.<br>With Yui he's hoping that he isn't misunderstanding, he's hopeful her feelings are real.</br></br></br>    We have some serious shit to discuss.<br><br>For example: I think 8man would divorce Yui if it means he can have a cat<br><br> In all seriousness, do you guys think Yui is the type to be fully dedicated in the relationship or will she eventually start regretting having such a misrable marriage with a boring guy? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. Grammar Nazis forgive me.</br>  <br>I think 8man will NTR Yui unless she does something about her betaness <br>Also, love between mentally different (in terms of intelligence) couples seldom lasts long. The only example I can think of where this wasn't the case was William Blake, but that is only because William Blake was a genius who would never find his (female) mental equivalent at those times.</br></br>  <br>But that's not genuine.</br>  <br>Oh wow, finally someone with a taste.</br>  <br>8man isn't the type to go for the divorce himself unless his wife if cheating on him, he's stated that himself.</br>  <br>Schopenhauer concluded that denying life and becoming an ascetic was the correct thing to do. Deussen, Nietzsche (during some time) and Wagner believed Schopenhauer on this as well, and all of those guys were some really, really serious geniuses but none of them really lived that way; except for nietzsche they were all well lived. If those faggots couldn't remain loyal to their thought what makes you think 8man will?</br>  <br>They weren't a Japanese male living in the 21 century, so that's irrelevant</br>  <br>This. Iroha is too seductive and 8man won't be able to keep his hands off Yukino (she'll be relucatant in yhe begining but woild definitely give inti her inner desires). Even if Yui finds out she won't have the balls to made him stop/divorce him.</br>  <br>No, it's more like a lack of opportunity to live out their expectancies. Had there been Buddhist temples it's likely they would have gone and joined them at the heat of the moment, but alas they were living in the victoria era where hedonism was at its height.<br>8man has too many girls going for his dick to like to remain genuine, not to mention Yui doesn't seem like the type to protect her meat. I think that if Yui does change and becomes more aggressive instead of holding back for the sake of Yukino or others then she will have a very good chance but as it stands I just can't see it happening.</br></br>  <br>If she does end up getting NTRd I doubt it'll be because she was weak or it was easy.<br>It's because of her simpleminded nature that 8man doesn't want to see people take advantage of her either.</br></br>  <br>It is obvious to everyone else that Yukino likes him.</br>  <br>Yui knows, Haruno knows, Iroha knows, Hayama probably has some idea about it, Shizuka probably knows.<br>Everyone but fucking 8man knows.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Do you all realize how stupid you sound? Proposing that a main character who is driven by logic first and emotions second would throw away "genuine," his raison d'etre, because of his sex drive?</br></br></br></br>  <br>All of those guys I mentioned were logic monsters.</br>  <br>You can't think when you have a boner</br>  <br>You can when you devote your life to Buddhism as Hikki did.</br>  <br>8man figured it out, but he's in denial about it. <br>He's not dense, he's just afraid of what it means</br></br>  <br> afraid of what it means <br>what does it mean?</br></br>  <br>He thinks it's dependency because of the words Haruno put in his head.</br>  <br> He thinks it's dependency <br> think <br>But it's is.</br></br></br>  <br>She depends on his dick to get off.</br>  <br>She used to depend on Hayama's dick to get off, too.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that before Hikki's appearance every girl used Hayama and Tobe to get off.</br>  <br>Read her memorandum. Her dependency and her crush are separate things.</br>  <br> implying she knows. </br>  <br> Saki   was too busy working to have time to get off, though.</br>  <br>She has her crush but she's dependent on genuine.<br>8man already made his move so he won't just be someone for her to depend on.</br></br>  <br>Saki clearly masturbated with her brother's pantsu</br>  <br>The penguin only choose a partner its whole life, and I'm pretty sure it's  Hayama the cookie man. </br>  <br>He knows that Yukino is just using him to reconcile her broken relationship with hayama. She is being dependent on him to fix her problems.</br>  If Saki was on the date to the aquarium, you think she would have a crisis of conscience when seeing the penguin sign?<br><br> After all, she loves all her siblings equally. How the fuck can she choose?! </br></br>  <br>"That's stupid, people aren't penguins."</br>   “Well, I don’t have a problem with taking a picture. I’ll go ask someone to take it for us.” <br><br> “We don’t need to do that since we can just do this.” <br><br> When she said that, Yuigahama stood next to me. She then faced the camera lens toward us and positioned it, ready to press the shutter button. <br><br> “I think we need to get a little closer or else we won’t fit in…” <br><br> Slowly, the distance between me and Yuigahama became nonexistent. Once she got closer, our arms linked. <br><br> “Here we go. Okay, cheese!” <br><br> Coming from the shutter button was an awfully light electronic noise. <br><br> My eyes wandered in the opposite direction from Yuigahama. Thanks to that, my eyes probably looked more rotten than usual. It was on the level of a spirit photograph.  <br><br>Did Yukino ever find out about the 8man photo Yui keep under her pillow?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you take   responsibility   ?  <br>Thanks to Iroha I'm leveling Naka in KC.</br>  <br>of course  yes </br>  <br>They all have their secret pictures with him.</br>  <br>Whether or not Yukino's feelings for him are truly genuine, how deeply she likes him<br>He's also afraid of how he will act because he likes her back</br></br>  <br>For Zaimokuza's mistake? Hell no.</br>  <br>Is that even a question?</br>  <br>It's pretty amazing how she was able to handle his Zaimokuza Crusher!</br>  Can someone tell me what anime this pic is from  I present to you, Shrimp-chan.

How did a normal human keep up with him?  ever read the story of the rabbit and the turtle run ? SAME HERE!  <br>He didn't have enough weapons in stock.</br>  <br>Shirou is hardly a normal human. Regardless, how about you read the VN you faggot</br>  <br>Come back when you put attention to the dialogue and visuals of the show.</br>  Because Nasu is a terrible writer.  <br> sentient sword colony <br> normal human </br></br>  <br><br>Something something time paradox something something reality marble something something nasu is a hack</br></br>  He's the strongest because of his swordspam and Ea, Shirou had answers to both.  <br>Also something something my swords are moving on their own and you get the gist of it.</br>  I should remind people that Gilgamesh has an Agility rank of C, which is the same level as Archer.<br><br>Take from that what you will.</br></br>  <br>Shirou is strong only in he reality marble.</br>  <br>The same way G3X killed an Apostle of God in Agito TADA NO NINGEN!</br>  <br>Shirou didn't have an answer to EA, but Gil had already said that if he drew EA against a faker like Shirou he lost by default.<br><br>That's what gave Shirou the upper hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Shirou can defeat people who have not mastered any weapon. If Shirou was fighting anyone who had mastered any weapon, Shirou would lose.</br>  <br>That doesn't make sense.</br>  <br><br>nice meme</br></br>  Why didn't Gilgamesh just hide in the Gate of Babylon?  <br>How can Shirou be so terrible at fighting with swords if he's practiced for years and also is a sword? He moves around like an idiot most of the time.</br>  <br>Of course Shirou had an answer for Ea.  Gil's ego </br>  CAUSE HES A FUCKING JOBBER!  <br>tl;dr: both Gil and Shirou are lousy swordsmen that rely on swordspam, and inside UBW Shirou can spam much faster than Gil</br>   you will never see a weapon once and autistically be able to almost perfectly recreate every detail including its entire history within the span of a few hours   <br>Because he's chuuni as all hell. It's like 3D faggots who copy their running style from Naruto.</br>  <br> can do the exact same thing Gil does <br> actually even faster <br> Gil dominates every other servant <br> But Shirou can't beat any of them </br></br></br></br>  <br> if he's practiced for years <br>He never practiced real swordsmanship.</br></br>  <br>All the projections within Unlimited Blade Works have also copied the combined experience and skill of its original owner, so Shirou can essentially use it close to as skillfully as the original owner. Minus a rank because all the weapons in UBW go down by 1 rank.  I don't actually fucking know, Nasu is a hack </br>  <br>Supposedly that works out pretty great for Gil against other Servants.</br>  <br> normal human <br>He's not.<br><br><br>  if he's practiced for years  <br>If by "years" you mean "about a week" then yeah. Being trained by Saber and copying his future self can do wonders to improve but there's no real substitute for experience.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Shirou is a gary stu and bad writing.<br><br>In the VN he beat Gil only because he CAME INSIDE Rin, which gave him enough mana to create a fucking reality marble.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not necessarily faster in that it can reach from point A to point B faster than the GoB but rather he has a fraction of a second less lag because the sword is already flying before Gil gets his out of the Gate.</br>  <br>Shirou isn't a swordsman. He'd never studied swordsmanship until Saber started teaching him. <br><br>He's an archer. He was formerly a member of the archery club at school til he had a fight with Shinji that made him quit. His skill with archery was such that he actually had to try to miss the target, because his body would naturally perform perfect shots if left on autopilot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shirou copied every sword Gil had in the gate, with every other servant he would just copy the one weapon they have and proceed to fight with the little collection of swords he has.<br><br>Imagine that Shirou made a downgrade copy of Excalibur with the abilities that the sword gives. Now put him against Saber who has mastered the sword by years of training, who wins?</br></br></br></br>  Is Nasu the most pretentious writer in the business?  <br>Wow just wow</br>  <br>I don't know why they didn't just skip the mana transfer in the anime. It didn't really add anything of value.</br>  <br><br>Didn't he do some kenjutsu under Taiga in the dojo at home too?</br></br>  <br>The one who can machine gun swords from all directions?</br>  <br>Gil can counter pick, Shirou can't apparently.</br>  What would happen if Shirou fought  Lancelot ?  <br>He'd just grab all the swords Shirou fires at him then beat his shit with the rest.</br>  UBW Spam &gt; GoB Spam<br>Muh pride<br>Muh mana transfer<br> Gilgamesh was only good in the Fate route anyway </br></br></br>  <br>The point is that UBW is established to be superior to GoB, yet nasu still claims that it's useless against other servants</br>  <br>The KnK ova is legitimately one of the most pretentious things I've ever watched.</br>  <br>Gil doesn't seem very picky. At least in the VN, I think the only time he actually cares to be selective about what he fires is against Heracles.</br>  <br>Ha, look at those scrubs fighting.</br>  <br>Gil wins because he overwhelms his enemies with raw power from a rain of noble phantasms. <br><br>Shirou beats gil because he has a hard counter to the NP rain. Overall, his copies are weaker than Gil's originals. He doesn't have that kind of raw power. Furthermore, he can only copy what he sees, so the more weapons Gil brings out, the more weapons he gives to Shirou. <br><br>Against a normal Heroic Spirit, Shirou only has one weapon to copy. Furthermore, he's a total novice with that weapon compared to the legendary hero who is an expert with it. He could try using UBW to do swordspam, but the difference in power between a NP wielded by its owner and copies created by a poseur are telling when they meet in true combat.<br><br>Just look a the first fight between Archer and Lancer, and how many times Lancer destroys Archer's swords. And that's just Lancer messing around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's thing has always been archery. I think he did some kind of physical training at home back when Kerry was alive, but his true martial talent has always been archery.</br>  <br> Wouldn't UBW swordspam plus broken fantasm be pretty much perfected GoB? Fuck Nasu.</br>  <br>It really is. It had a nice atmosphere thanks to Kalafina though.<br>Fate/Stay Night is easily the most pretentious thing I have ever read. Its so far up its own ass that calling it shit would be a literal description.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh was never good in any route. Everything is made worse by his inclusion. This doesn't just apply to FSN; he's also easily the most boring character in both Zero and Strange Fake.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean he has no training with a sword before Saber/Experience Bleed Archer</br>  <br>Gil doesn't counter shit. He just throws a sword without even using its ability. His NP could be called Gate of Long Chunks of Metal and it wouldn't change anything.</br>  <br>He isn't Gil, he can't do that.<br><br>Shirou ability isn't a portal that can open everywhere to shoot sword, his ability is both to copy every sword he sees. That's why he could win against Gil, he copied every sword he launched.<br>Against Saber he will not be capable of summoning UBW and he doesn't have enough mana for a drawn out fight. Remember that against Gil Rin made a contract with him to supply him with mana.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't recall him ever mentioning having sword training, and given his total lack of ability in that area, I don't see why you'd assume had any. Up til high school he'd been doing archery, then he quit. He specifically asked Saber to teach him to fight with a sword because he didn't know how.</br>  <br>So the problem isn't the principle of how UBW works, the problem is just plain fuel deficiency?</br>  <br>Not to mention he's not anything like his mythological counter part. Everything in terms of appearance, personality, weapons, history, etc are different. What the fuck was Nasu smoking when he designed this character.</br>  <br>Gil basically never counter picks anyone. He spams NPs against people he considers worthless, uses his chain to stop them from moving sometimes, and if he actually takes a fight seriously he uses Ea, which fucks everything.</br>  <br>Either it's super early in the VN or a one off line in the anime that he talks about actually dueling Taiga, and Taiga's known as actually being good with a bokken.</br>    <br> people <br>Servants.<br>Against a simple human swordmaster, unless it's some kind of a saint, traced sword skills of legendary heroes will probably be enough. And for anything harder he has swordspam and nuke arrows.</br></br></br>  <br>If he were trained by Taiga he wouldn't be shit. Taiga was actually good enough that Saber respected her.</br>   hercules losing to anyone <br> archer losing to shirou <br> basically any fight involving lancer or caster <br><br>S/N is entertaining, but as far as logic goes it's a complete trainwreck</br></br></br></br>  Do people actually like Fate fight scenes or is it all a meme? They look horrible.  <br> Because Shirou can defeat people who have not mastered any weapon <br>Enkidu</br></br>  <br>There are people out there who actually think Fate/Zero has the best animation in the industry. What do you expect?</br>  <br><br>Prisma Illya has some good ones.</br></br>  <br>Not really. I think they're really boring and stupid.</br>  Stop the hate guys, let's have a cute song instead.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GFK<wbr>q1FIj7oE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Explodes at 1:20+</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, basically.<br><br>UBW uses two main fuels, the swords that Shirou has seen in his life and the mana he has at hand.<br><br>GoB doesn't have any of those problems since the vault is almost infinite and it is very mana efficient.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So the problem isn't the principle of how UBW works <br>It is that. UBW doesn't work anything like GoB. UBW lets him summon copies of weapons he's seen. Unless he actually manifests his reality marble, his ability to summon swords is limited. He can't launch nonstop like Gil can. <br><br>If he actually manages to manifest UBW then he can pull of something similar to what Gil can do, because the battlefield is his conceptual landscape.<br><br>The powergap between his weapons and Gils is still real though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are people complaining about how the new release of umineko is going to "ruin" the original artstyle. VN fans are just delusional</br>  <br> Yeah, basically. <br><br><br> It is that. <br><br><br>Stop hurting me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget the number of times that Shirou or Archer pulled out swordspams without being in UBW?</br>  <br> Shirou <br> Normal human </br></br>  <br>If the powergap is real then how is he able to fight Gil at all? The fact that Shirou can counter Gil's weapon by flinging the same shit he does suggest they are both pretty much the same.</br>  <br>It isn't superior. It's a counter. The quality of its weapons is lesser, the stock and variety of its weapons is lesser, and its power is lesser. The one thing it has over the GoB is that the weapons are out and ready.</br>  <br>Bad writing.<br><br>Welcome to '05.</br></br></br>  <br>Completely useless unless he's mastered a weapon.</br>  <br>Both posts say almost the same.<br>Only that one extend on how the mana difference makes UBW and GoB so different.</br></br>  I don't think this black blob of bad feels has mastered any weapon. Could Shirou defeat the Birthday Ghost?  <br>See </br>  <br>Depends, can you cut a sickness?</br>  <br>As a swordspam (which is what Gil primary uses GoB for) it's far superior<br><br>As for the quality of the NPs they are only a rank lower, but Shirou ca just break them, which increases their rank by 1.<br><br>So yeah, if Gil can win fights against other servants with just GoB swordspam there is absolutely no reason why Shirou can't do the same inside UBW.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Masamune's (blacksmith) sword at some point managed to uncut leaves back into their original form (Murasame had cut them in clean halves earlier), so there's already a sword that heals by cutting.</br>  <br>There's a difference between "fixing back a cut leaf" and "healing a tree that is rotting away" by slashing. <br>Pale Rider is pretty much a force of nature by itself, so I doubt you could beat it by something as "standard" as sword spamming.</br></br>  <br>It's not better. The fact that Shirou fires them before Gil fires them does not mean they have greater speed or power. It just means they're already on the way to point B before Gil's weapons are going. They would normally reach point B first and have more power behind them, but they're meeting the same sword already in transit.<br><br>Breaking NPs is not an easy task and could not be done more than once or twice before he'd be out of energy.</br></br></br>  <br>Because GoB is infinite, UBW isn't.<br><br>UBW only copies and save swords Shirou has seen, against any other servant it isn't very useful.</br></br></br>  Why didn't she just tell Bazett about the eighth card in the beginning and avoid all the fighting?  <br>Could he cure autoimmune hepatitis by cutting it, though?</br>  <br>That posts states that the weapon is less powerfull in every possible way and yet Shirou is able to craft weapons that are on par with what Gil pulls out or else Gil would curbstomp everything Shirou has and win. Having the sword earlier doesn't make it more powerful. That doesn't explain shit.</br>  Was Gilgamesh even able to even use his weapons from the GoB? From what I understood, Shirou was spamming so fast he didn't even leave him a second to breath, because the second he had time to bring himself back on equal grounds, he could win.  <br>Rin also wants the cards.<br>Telling your enemy where is the prize you want can't be a good idea.</br></br>  <br>Why is it that people can't understand that strongest does not mean invincible?</br>  <br>It's explained in the fight that Gil is using his weapons to break both weapons together to make up for the time difference.</br>  <br>Bio-weapons are also weapons.</br>  <br> that girl I fucked gave me some mana so my powerlevel tripled or something <br> I am still weak, but my power counters your powers perfectly <br> it may look like I'm suddenly overpowered as fuck and could take out any servant, but it's just that I counter the main villain, I swear <br><br>Asspull. It was especially stupid in the anime since they didn't even attempt to properly explain the bullshit reason he gave in the VN.<br>Still, it's horribly written either way, with the way Shirou and Gilgamesh were presented and developed so far there should've been no way Shirou could win. He just made Gilgamesh too strong for the fag to be able to beat him without any kind of asspulls.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The fact is that they appear instantaneously rather than the delay from Gil having to open GoB between volleys, which means that UBW should have a higher firerate.<br><br><br>They are only disposable projections, he could just keep spamming multiple copies of the same sword all day long ad still overwhelm other servants the same way Gil does with GoB</br></br></br></br>  <br>gil underestimate shiro aka plotarmor<br> hurrdur read the novel <br>I did, this is overrated as fuck</br></br></br>  <br> Because GoB is infinite, UBW isn't. <br>You got that the wrong way. GoB just contains a lot of shit, but not an infinite amount of shit. UBW literally contains an unlimited amount of swords.</br></br>  <br>So why was he still getting pushed back then?</br>  Why didn't Gil just punch Shirou in the solar plexus?  <br>Doing that is why he's able to even attempt to retaliate at all. Shirou is always right ahead and Gil is barely making up the difference.</br>  <br> that girl I fucked gave me some mana so my powerlevel tripled or something <br>Glad to see you didn't pay attention to the scene at all.<br><br> I am still weak, but my power counters your powers perfectly <br>No shit, that's the whole point of the tension between Shirou and Gil.<br><br> it may look like I'm suddenly overpowered as fuck and could take out any servant, but it's just that I counter the main villain, I swear <br>That's just Nasu usual underplaying of his MCs so they don't come out as OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Punching in a sword fight is dishonoraburu</br>  <br>Shirou fought like five minutes inside UBW and was out of mana, it would be impossible for him sword spam more than that.<br>Gil has never defeated anyone in less than five minutes without using EA.<br><br>It is true that post-UBW Shirou has a chance of defeating a servant, but it is extremely low.<br><br><br>The VN clearly said that everything there is a copy, which means it contains a lot but less than GoB.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The VN clearly said that everything there is a copy <br>Infinite copies, tho</br></br>  <br>It contains an unlimited amount of every copied object.</br>  <br>Losing to a plebeian ginger is dishonorable.</br>  If Shirou can't defeat anyone who has mastered a weapon, does that mean Gilgamesh can't defeat anyone who has mastered no weapon?  So according to some of the people in this thread Shirou was only able to counterspam Gil in UBW because he immediately copies Gil's weapons and against any regular servant his UBW would be mostly empty.<br><br>But what's this then. This cg shows that UBW has a whole bunch of swords before they even start fighting.</br></br>  <br>They don't even spam in the VN, Shirou just somehow managed to keep Gil locked in melee and Gil suddenly forget that GoB can materialize almost everywhere.</br>  <br>Shichika could easily kill Gilgamesh.</br>  <br>Read the RN version. It makes it much clearer that swordspam is going on, even though the text in the original makes it clear as well.</br>  <br>Most of them are already copied because he directly inherited UBW from Archer, including Archer's copies.</br>  <br>You were talking to secondary retards.</br>  <br>Who said or implied that? That's counter to how UBW works.</br>  <br>Stop pulling shit out of your ass, secondary-kun</br>  <br> Gilfags showing their low IQ points once again. </br>  <br> tension <br>He just made MC look useless and villain look too strong, but it was still obvious MC was going to win through asspull. I could've write it better when I was 12.<br>Having your MC be weak as shit during the entire series just to suddenly become strong enough to take one of the most powerful characters in the end is plainly stupid. <br><br><br>How does that even make sense? That's just plain bad writing, he said the GoB weapons are a lot stronger, but when he gets to the fight they're actually the same. If they were better they would destroy Shirou's stuff without having a scratch, even if launching them wasn't as fast.<br><br>I really don't see how people can still defend Fate writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh is the most powerful servant because he possesses a counter to every heroic spirit. That's how he beats Excalibur, Caliburn, Herc, and Rider. He loses to Avalon, UBW, and Lancelot because those abilities can counter what makes him strong in the first place. Shirou doesn't have the power to counter everyone he faces in combat, so he just has swordspam at best in UBW which other servants can handle.</br>  <br> Who said or implied that? <br><br><br> Shirou copied every sword Gil had in the gate, with every other servant he would just copy the one weapon they have and proceed to fight with the little collection of swords he has. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Then how does it work?</br>  <br> reading comprehension </br>  <br>That would actually be correct. He'd have no way of having Rho Aias and enough swords to counter Gil if he hadn't copied/osmosis'd all of Archer's stuff.</br>  <br>Ryougi or Tohno?</br>  <br>I'm rereading the VN fight and it does clearly show that Shirou at least keeps on creating swords to counter whatever Gil pulls out of GoB which eventually forces him to pulls out Ea.<br>Well, that doesn't stop that he could technically materialize them elsewhere, I guess.</br></br>  <br> Gilgamesh is the most powerful servant because he possesses a counter to every heroic spirit <br> He loses to Avalon, UBW, and Lancelot because those abilities can counter what makes him strong in the first place <br>So Avalon, UBW and Lancelot counter the counters to other servants and that's why they can beat Gilg? That makes no sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Archer&gt;Shirou&gt;Gil&gt;Every other servant.<br>It's not "rock-paper-scissors", it's "scissors-rock-bigger rock" with the bigger rock beating the shit out of the smaller one.</br></br>  <br>Avalon is a one-time, very specific usage that only happened because he was fucking around, UBW is a very specific hard-counter that only happens because he was fucking around, and Lancelot never beats him other than firebombing him because he's fucking around. There's a key element in there that may not be obvious on the first-read.</br>  <br>You must have been a very deprevived child if you never played rock paper scissors growing up.</br>  <br> because he possesses a counter to every heroic spirit. <br>We never see him use any counter though. He just throws stuff at his opponent and gets his chains out when things get in close range. He would have been punched in the face by Heracles if not for these chains.</br></br>  <br>Avalon is pretty much the absolute defense itself. Is there any Servant that could even bypass it?</br>  <br>UBW stores a copy of every sword Shirou sees, those swords are most likely just the ones he saw during his encounters with Archer and the swordspam exchange he had with Gil before deploying UBW</br>  <br>Because he doesn't care to do so. It's mentioned despite Kid-Gil being weaker that he might be better overall because he can properly use the weapons without hubris.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh is the most powerful servant because he possesses a counter to every heroic spirit.  <br><br>Nope, Nasu only said that applies to PROPER heroic spirits and Fate has plenty of IMPROPER heroic spirits.</br></br></br>  <br>I literally gave four examples of him using counters.</br>  <br>Rho Aias is right. But Shirou copied whatever swords he needed if he didn't have them already.</br>  <br>The chains are a counter to anything with divinity.<br>Heracles has divinity, thus a chains counter Heracles.</br></br>  <br>But in VN during final battle Archer uses Rho Aias for first time to protect Shirou from Ea. Second Rho Aias was Shirou's.</br>  <br>He cannot copy swords inside UBW. Once it's up, making new swords costs an arm and a leg.</br>  <br><br>king of jobbers</br></br>  <br> He cannot copy swords inside UBW. Once it's up, making new swords costs an arm and a leg. <br>????????????????????</br></br>  <br>Bad writing and MC armor.</br>  <br>Neither Gil or Shirou see or notice it happen, so it would be quite impossible for Shirou to have analyzed it on the fly. He brings it out with no hesitation, so he knows about it far before he uses it.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you smoking?</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>You're talking to a retarded Gilfag.</br>  <br>He fires them as Broken Phantasms, thus increasing their rank by 1. Making them equal to the originals.</br>  Was Shirou floating or flying, am I right?  <br>I'm going to go out on a limb and say Nasu always meant for the first Rho Aias to be Shirou's, and that him pulling it out again in UBW was trying to add credence to that, but I guess people will still believe the first was Archer's.</br>  <br>But that's his strategy for absolutely everything. Divinity or not.<br>The point is that he doesn't give a fuck about countering so that is not why he is strong.</br></br>  <br>No, reforging a broken sword is expensive as it's no longer a projection but the actual item on the hill of swords (where he pulls projections from). Tracing, the creation of a weapon, is literally free. His soul does it just by seeing a weapon.</br>  <br>Deploying weapons not present at the start or recreating destroyed weapons takes up a shit-ton of energy.</br>  <br>Ｑ：「無限の剣製」内で壊れたり、使ったりした剣は魔力の使用なしに再び作<wbr>られるのか？<br><br>Ａ：固有結界形成から維持には魔力消費はされ続けるが、結界形成時に用意さ<wbr>れている武装に関しては 魔力消費 はしない。 しかし、破壊されたものを新しく製造する、または形成時に無かったものを新<wbr>造するには激しく魔力を消費する。</wbr></wbr></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Nasu out-and-out said the first one was Archer, the second one is Shirou in Complete Material III.<br><br> Q: In the end of the Rin route, was it Shirou that projected Rho Aias in the Shirou vs Gilgamesh fight? Or was it Archer? In Fate/side material, it's said that it was projection magic from Archer, but in the story, there was the depiction of Shirou "pulling the shield from the hill". Does this mean that this switched to Archer's scene? <br> A: This has been easy to misunderstand, but the part about Archer supporting Shirou was the time before Shirou pulled out Rho Aias, before Shirou came to his realization. <br> After Shirou's monologue about him being surprised that he was still alive after taking Gil's attack, "If I survived, there must have been a reason why I survived. But　that was simply something I didn't have any control over." <br> That was the "Rho Aias" that Archer made to help Shirou in a way that wouldn't let Gilgamesh know there was someone else waiting to ambush him. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>My point was that this rock paper scissors is horribly written. Characters don't win or lose because they're supposed to, but because the plot demands it and we're given some stupid, nonsensical reason for it.</br></br></br>  <br> Avalon is a one-time, very specific usage that only happened because he was fucking around <br>Actually it was because he wasn't fucking around at the last second, it only worked because he fully committed himself to using max Ea, which occupies his limbs and prevents him from moving.</br></br>  <br><br>Your argument is weak. The direction is fine, the plot gives completely valid reasons for what occurs. You just don't like the reasons, this does not in any way make them nonsensical. They are all completely justified and rationalized.</br></br>  <br>The situation leading to its usage is all him fucking around. He could have killed her any time in the fight before then, but "muh waifu" is his only though until then.</br>  <br>Have you seen Gil other fights?<br>From what I remember the guy countered Saber with Excalibur prototype, countered Iskandar by using EA and the chains and countered Heracles with the chains. <br>He uses the chains because they are a counter to anything with divinity which many heroic heroes posses.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, that's just Gilgamesh being Gilgamesh. And not "murderbot 9000 with Gilgamesh's powers".</br>  <br> They are all completely justified and rationalized. <br>If you ignore all the holes then yes everything makes sense I guess.</br></br>  <br> From what I remember the guy countered Saber with Excalibur prototype <br>No, he meets Excalibur with Enuma Elish.<br>He counters Caliburn with its prototype, Merodach.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Name a single hole and maybe we can discuss that instead.</br></br>  <br>There is already a thread full of that.<br>Here, go read it </br></br>  <br>Gil doesn't need his limbs to shoot something.</br>  <br>Shirou mastered the skill of plot armor.</br>  <br>Herp derp power levels. I don't think you've ever seen a fight outside of DBZ before. Saying "this person is stronger" means fuck all against a good plan or trick.</br>  <br>Sugoi circular logic</br>  <br>No it's not. For instance in the UBW fight there was no valid reason why GoB weapons didn't simply destroy Shirou's weapons while suffering little to no damage themselves, since they're supposed to be superior. Also the fact that Shirou who has very little experience could keep up with Gilg in close and range combat, leaving aside the quality and speed of weapons is complete bullshit.</br>  <br>Single gate of babylon shots wouldn't save him from being bisected by Excalibur at that point. It would just be being a sore loser.</br>  <br> For instance in the UBW fight there was no valid reason why GoB weapons didn't simply destroy Shirou's weapons while suffering little to no damage themselves, since they're supposed to be superior. <br><br>How about the entire point of "there's no reason a copy can't defeat the original"? They were destroyed together because they weren't superior enough.<br>Notice they weren't destroying Gil's weapons outside the reality marble. They were just deflecting them.<br><br> Also the fact that Shirou who has very little experience could keep up with Gilg in close and range combat <br><br>Also explained, he was receiving Archer's skills and knowledge in their battle, raising him far above his previous station. Archer is in fact a superior combatant to Gilgamesh in terms of skill.<br><br> leaving aside the quality and speed of weapons is complete bullshit. <br><br>Quality and speed are perfect within the reality marble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When an object gets shot out and meets another object of similar make at the same speed, what happens? The stop. They crash.<br>Are you done showing you know nothing of simple physics?</br></br>  <br>Did fuck all good against True Archer.</br>  <br> there's no reason a copy can't defeat the original <br><br>So what happened to the "projections are one rank below the original" rule?</br></br></br>  All the fight scenes in this anime were retarded chuuni shit.<br><br>It's not efficient to do twirls and spinning mid-air.<br>It's not efficient to run Naruto-style with arms behind your back.<br>It's not efficient to do backflip to dodge things when a sidestep is enough.<br><br>The only good fight scene was the ones Kiritsugu was involved in because he wouldn't do stupid chuuni ballerina dancing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou can recreate the history of a weapon so it fights by itself without even knowing what the weapon is or its history.<br>Shirou needs to be able to perfectly recreate a weapon visually inside and out in his mind to project it, yet he can do that just by glancing at it one time.<br>I'll excuse the "be able to cast a complicated spell that barely anybody can use because he fought himself from the future just hours prior" because its magic, ain't gotta explain shit.</br></br></br>  <br>UBW is just a database that stores the information for every single piece of close combat equipment he's ever seen. Since sword is his origin, it's what he primarily specializes in and what appears when the RM is deployed, but he still has access to other shit like Rho Aias, and Rule Breaker. Archer's in particular has stored weapons numbering in the thousands so there's no lack of options.</br>  <br> So what happened to the "projections are one rank below the original" rule? <br><br>That only ever existed in the statistics, it's never shown in the narration or acknowledged by the characters. If we didn't have the stats rulebook, we'd never have known it at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok cool you didn't like it. Thank you very much.</br>  I wish someone would pick up Fox Tail. Apparently these are the two other great monsters of Japan or something.  <br> For instance in the UBW fight there was no valid reason why GoB weapons didn't simply destroy Shirou's weapons while suffering little to no damage themselves, since they're supposed to be superior. <br>The whole point of UBW is that it can perfectly replicate any weapon, its rank as an NP has nothing to do with its durability.<br><br> Also the fact that Shirou who has very little experience could keep up with Gilg in close and range combat <br>Except that it's explicitly stated that Gil is a shit fighter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't make that distinction. You're thinking of Servants, which don't have to be proper heroes.</br>  <br> Shirou can recreate the history of a weapon so it fights by itself without even knowing what the weapon is or its history. <br> Shirou needs to be able to perfectly recreate a weapon visually inside and out in his mind to project it, yet he can do that just by glancing at it one time. <br>What's wrong with these?<br>They're compatible with the metaphysics of the setting, so yes.<br> I'll excuse the "be able to cast a complicated spell that barely anybody can use because he fought himself from the future just hours prior" because its magic, ain't gotta explain shit. <br>The spell is only so complicated because it normally requires a form of enlightenment that Shirou doesn't need as he lost his higher consciousness in the fire.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Efficiency only applies in simulationist settings, in a world of magic efficiency can be tossed out the window.</br>  <br>He can recreate something he doesn't even know.<br>That is impossible even in the Fate universe.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=NSg<wbr>XOZKSt20</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F_5<wbr>Q0QDaH5w</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Despite all the QUALITY and the same track being repeated several times and the fight being frustratingly interrupted several times by Seiba's shit, the bat bunker brawl is still a better climax than the temple showdown.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When does he do that? I'll remind you once more that he copied many things from Archer by absorbing his skill.</br>  <br><br>IMO, they should have brought the guy who directed the 5th KnK movie, he knew hoe to make a fight look dynamic and intense without all the unnecessary retarded flourish</br></br>  <br> He can recreate something he doesn't even know. <br>That's wrong, Shirou instantly knows what a weapon is by looking at it. He identified a numerous amount of Gilgamesh's weapons in the Fate route from sight, Rin was shocked.<br><br>He also identifies Merodach despite "Merodach" not being a famous legendary weapon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean Ryougi "spinning like a buzzsaw" Shiki? Watch KnK5 again sometime, man.</br>    <br>Hmm, how should I explain this...<br><br>Imagine having a raw power Tyranitar with all attacking moves that had +6 stats in everything. Also he was holding a Life Orb. Imagine this Tyranitar is Gilgamesh.<br><br>This Tyranitar could sweep every single Pokemon.<br><br>But a Wobbuffet is switched out, holding a Focus Sash and Tyranitar doesn't switch out. He instead uses Crunch on Wobbuffet. Wobbuffet survives and Counters Tyranitar, which Tyranitar dies to.<br><br>Against any other Pokemon, Wobbuffet would get Toxic'd, Confused, Encored, etc. It's only against Tyranitar he'd be able to beat (in the one turn).<br><br>Same thing like that. Shirou is the Wobbuffet. Gilgamesh is the Tyranitar. Every other servant is every other Pokemon.<br><br>And even then, Gilgamesh could easily beat Shirou had he used Ea from the beginning. So there. Have a collectable bait image for your trouble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can we talk about Kayneth instead? It's much more fun to talk about Kayneth.  Why didn't Archer just rip Shirou's head off the moment Saber was rule broken? It's a pretty big plot hole.<br><br>He had so many chances, we see Servants move so fast they might as well be teleporting. Archer can fight with Cu who is known to be one of the fastest. <br>Neither Shirou nor Rin would have chance to react before Archer just punched a gaping hole in Shirou's head or decapitated him.</br></br></br>  <br>I would have liked to see more of his abilities. In the end we only got liquid metal fun times from a high level magus who should have dozens of spells and mystic codes.</br>  Shirou only won because Gil was cocky. <br><br>It wouldn't have been a fight if he use Ea right away.</br></br>  <br>Archer never really wanted to kill his past self.<br>More than anything else, he wanted to be proven wrong.<br>It was one long temper tantrum.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he didn't really want to kill him.</br>  <br> he knew hoe to make a fight look dynamic and intense without all the unnecessary retarded flourish <br>I'm not sure if you're being serious or not. On the one hand, that webm together with that comment makes me think you're being sarcastic. On the other hand, I know that there are more than a few people who actually believe that.</br></br>  <br>The bigger plot hole is why didn't Rin just use a command spell to call Saber when she and Shinji were alone in the castle.</br>  Why didn't Gil just activate the NPs of the weapons he owned instead of just throwing them?<br><br>He used Vajra against Lancelot and in S/F he wielded Merodach which was supposed to be Adam's sword or something that was lost when he fucked off from Eden.</br></br>  <br>Other that the retarded spinning before the fight there is barely any flourish, just look at how she deals with the flying arm, she just stabs it slashes and immediately returns to facing Araya with the same movement.</br>  <br>Kenneth is only good for bully. Though I will point out that Kerry's team contained way more NTR than the actual Team NTR.</br>  <br>Why bother? She was never in significant danger.<br><br>Even when Kotomine was talking about taking out her heart, she had frontline seats to seeing Cuchulainn get up in front of her.</br></br></br>  <br>Because Shirou has a very disarming personality...</br>  <br><br>The weapons he knows how to activate aren't that numerous, and it would mean treating an enemy seriously to do so.</br></br>  <br> Wasting a command spell on trash </br>  <br> Why didn't Archer just rip Shirou's head off the moment Saber was rule broken? It's a pretty big plot hole. <br>Because he was under Rin's command spell. Did you just forget why he teamed up with Caster at all?</br></br>  What a beast.  <br>That makes it a little better, but copying the fighting style to the point where it fights by themselves is still a stretch.<br>When it first talks about Shirou's projection it hammers it in your head how you have to perfectly recreate every little detail and Shirou even has trouble with it, yet goes on to instantly recreate a sword he could barely see flying faster than a bullet in less than 3 weeks?<br>Even if his origin is swords, a meaningless pipe he's been practicing on has a lot less information than a famous sword used by some guy over a thousand years ago that he just happened to see flying out of magic circle in mid air.</br></br></br>  <br> Why didn't Gil just activate the NPs <br>1. He probably didn't know how to use them. He said himself he isn't aware of all the treasures he has in his vault.<br>2. Why bother? It's much easier to sword spam instead of bothering to individually train in and use any one of them.<br>3. Many of them weren't the actual NPs that servants use. Many of them were the "prototypes" of those NPs, or the original legends those NPs descended from. See, many NPs came into existence after their wielders trained in them, slew mythical beasts, became heroes wielding them, etc. etc. etc. and since Gilgamesh had the ORIGINALS of those NPs, they hadn't yet had time to become the legend they were going to be. In other words, Gilganesh shot fetuses, while Lancer, Saber, etc. used the fully grown adult.<br>4. He's too arrogant to do so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not true, the only thing he'll hold back for actual enemies would be Ea</br>  Because in the Nasuverse when someone is called the strongest or the best, it is completely disregarding things such as intelligence, ability to perceive threats, tactics and basically the entire "thought" part that makes the best fighters the best.<br><br>It's mostly just a way to make Shirou look cool when he inevitably beats them</br></br>  <br> gilgamesh shot fetuses </br>  <br>That fight is the same as every other animated fight.<br>It isn't realistic, but it just looks good which is everything animation needs.<br>Taking the hand as an example and applying your logic, can you tell me why did she cut the hand four times instead of just one and why did the villain stayed without attacking in those seconds?</br></br></br>  <br>The real question is will there ever be another servant as much of a bro as Cu?</br>  <br>Wait I just watched a few episodes of the new series, I thought archer was gilgamesh before he was summoned wasn't he?</br>  <br>that was pretty pathetic to be honest and I suspect why anime people were shocked to discover magi can actually do shit that matters</br>  <br>This post is beyond secondary.

Come on dude.</br>  <br>Fuji don't do this to me.</br>  <br> again <br>he was never even close to zoro level</br></br>  <br> straiteubé <br>Took me a few minutes to get the joke, it sounds so forced.</br></br>  <br>Your bait is weak as the actual translation is linked in the OP<br><br><br>Yeah it was really weird that he shot it (?) in front of everyone making Big Mom his direct enemy just like drake</br></br></br></br>  Lucci is a very good boy.  <br>I didn't expect it, but I expected even less that Doflamingo would be revealed to have an incurable disease because of tenryubito inbreeding.</br>  <br>yes I think it's Ki-oon edition. no problem.<br><br>yeah but "teubé" isn't really something you would expect in 1939.</br></br></br>  <br>The one that's the most bullshit for me is Conis Dad on Skypea. Like come on, does even a single person actually die from that fucking huge thunder!?</br>  <br> Tsuru </br>  <br>Good thing green bull is there to stall her, or there's no way the supernovas would be getting out of this one.</br>    <br>yeah I didn't imagine that Akainu would send him instead of Kizaru to dressrosa to get Fujitora's head</br>  <br>a beating is not a fucking nuke exploding under your feet.</br>  congratulations guys, this thread won the meme award  <br>You guys are all talking about Pekoms and Sanji, Green Bull and Big Mom. Does nobody notice the GODDAMN egg on Big Moms ship? It's the same one as on the Oro Jackson. It drives me insane..</br>  <br>Oh yeah, now that you mention it.<br>...How did the delinquents/bad boys of the 1938 even talk like though ?</br></br>  <br>That wasn't a egg you retard that was her personal toilet in form of an egg, we even saw the open door are you blind?</br>  <br> personal toilet in form of an egg <br> implying that wasn't the peko peko no mi <br>Are you actually so retarded you didn't notice ?

Does this make Shakky's anecdote here the oldest known pirate exploits? <br>And she's ageless too. I'm so used to there being a million theories on every detail of the story that the one that's still a complete mystery is the most interesting</br></br>  <br>Roger was a rookie on Brooke time, so they found her somewhere in their journey.</br>  <br> he didn't get what I was trying to say <br>Not sure if I didn't express myself well enough or if it's just you who have bad reading comprehension. Oh well, I can't find it in myself to care which one's true.</br></br>    <br>I suppose the thing that comes to mind would be the Op-Op immortality operation. Even then though, she's still a bit of a mystery.</br>  <br><br>if she was a pirate 40 years ago, she could very well be only 60 today<br>nothing out of the ordinary</br></br></br>  thoughts?  <br>8 Nakama.

Maybe it's about a movie? They do wear different stuff in the movie.</br>  <br> let's post het it'll get rid of fujos <br>Fujos don't get triggered by het like you get triggered by slightly homoerotic pics. At least I don't.</br></br>  <br>What is that tattoo in Monet's arm?</br>  <br>there's no fujos here tho, just that one autist who admitted to being hetero and to just save gay pics on his own pc to shitpost. the ones who do get triggered are just a few children and fatty girls who do get scared by drawn tits. In fact, their reactions are the easiest way to tell the amount of newfags and cancer on a thread.</br>  <br> there's no fujos here tho, just that one autist who admitted to being hetero and to just save gay pics on his own pc to shitpost <br>I never admitted to it, that's just your own headcanon.</br></br>  Why is Fujitora willing to flush his career just for Luffy and Law?  <br>You did admitted that and can't even sace face. It's like an autist who thinks saying no after fucking up will be enough and everybody will just believe it. -1 level shitposter.</br>  <br>He's a fujo too</br>  <br> you did admitted <br>Do I really need to defend myself against this ?</br></br>  <br>Fucking fujishit</br>  Chapter's out everyone  <br>I keked</br>  <br>xD</br>  <br>Nice catch, I never noticed.<br>It's  another proof she's alive and we'll get to see her backstory </br></br>  <br>No, he was fujo-tored, because fujoshi cunts from japan were so ugly, he tored his eyes out.</br>  <br>He's not doing it just for Luffy and Law. Reread ch 793 without speedreading and maybe you'll understand his motives a little better.</br>  <br>I know why he did what he did, but I don't see how it's worth losing his career over it when all he has to do is catch Luffy and Law to "make up" for it</br>   tfw Sugar still doesn't now that Ceasar and Doflamingo killed her sister <br>hello darkness my old friend</br>    does any have you have the interview in which Oda states that the One Piece is not an imaginary or conceptual things?

Any sight of the Chapter? Or can I go sleep, knowing the chapter will release in around 7-9hrs as usual?  <br> I managed to let them convince me to be stupid, so can you <br>I don't think so.</br></br>  <br>I remember a doujin about that being top-tier.</br>    <br>I don't think we're getting the chapter anytime soon. Just a feeling though, I don't know it for a fact</br>  <br>Adolf Hitler<br><br><br>nice trips, but ceasar pierced her heart m8</br></br></br></br>  <br>Va dormir.

Monet is a logia. Your point ?</br>  <br>Here is the spoiler:<br><br> Chapter name: Pirate Tendency<br> Fujitora bets with Maynard <br> CP0 is seen discussing the treasure Doffy found on Marijoa and how they have to retrieve it <br> it was a golden bow and arrow that could give people Devil Fruit powers without a fruit, even for who already ate one <br> Smiles were made from part of this arrow materials <br> They try to kill Luffy on his sleep <br> Robin appears behind them <br> she scream "gigantesco mama" <br> all 3 cp0s are shown drowning on some white liquid <br> no chapter next week. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>left bottom is pic related</br>  Pika is one huge lump of beta shit but his devil fruit is fucking useful.  What is it about pink haired crybabies that makes me rigid?  <br> :^) </br>  <br> Monet is a logia. <br>her heart was seperated from her by law, so she could not turn her heart into snow and there was blood coming out from it after ceasar pierced it. Or are you suggesting that smoker could have turned tashigi's (or rather his in that case) heart into smoke when he was in her body? We now that when they changed body's the powers remained in smoker's original one, further proving that the heart itself (when manipulated by law) is vulnerable no matter if you ar ea logia or not.</br></br>  <br>It's called white knight complex.</br>  <br>I think it's called not being gay.</br>  <br>A body part is still yours, even if it's cut and far away. It has nothing to do with switching personalities.</br>  <br>seconding, someone get on this stat</br>  <br>Good to know. Too bad it doesn't work for 3DPD.</br>  <br> A body part is still yours, even if it's cut and far away. It has nothing to do with switching personalities. <br>you completly missed the point. Her heart was pierced and when that happened it did not turn into snow, no, it began to bleed. On another note it was suggested several times that a heart seperated by law can no longer be manipulated by the owner. For example smoker could have turned his heart to smoke and recreated his heart by smoking. Nothing like that happened and he was depending on law himself as he was unable to do anything related to his heart when it was already stolen.</br></br>  Bellamy new nakama until you like it<br><br>Bellamy is love <br>Bellamy is life</br></br></br>  <br> implying people are killed when their heart is stabbed <br> in fucking One Piece <br>I'm not denying that the heart wasn't pierced, I am denying that Oda can't find a way to keep her alive despite this.</br></br></br>     people still arguing about the heart bullshit <br>if she was unaffected by the stab, why was she coughing blood and fainting?<br>if the heart could turn into snow then she wouldn't have felt anything but that wasn't the case<br>she was stabbed in the heart, she started to cough blood and was fainting, there was blood coming out of the heart<br>those are the facts, stop with your delusional bullshit</br></br></br></br>    <br> I'm not denying that the heart wasn't pierced, I am denying that Oda can't find a way to keep her alive despite this. <br> implying there weren't case of people dying from a bullet <br> being delusive <br>Good for you</br></br></br></br>    <br>It will be fucking hilarious if monet shows up sometime during the next arc.<br>That will be the biggest asspull in the series.</br></br>  <br> if she was unaffected by the stab, why was she coughing blood and fainting? <br>Manga cancer.<br> if the heart could turn into snow then she wouldn't have felt anything but that wasn't the case <br>Plot convenience. She needed to be stopped and she was. She doesn't need to die for it.<br> she was stabbed in the heart, she started to cough blood and was fainting, there was blood coming out of the heart <br>Again, not something Oda can't bypass.<br>Mock me all you want, but someday you'll be just as mad as these guys who thought Sabo was dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pell</br>  <br>retard</br>  <br> implying there weren't case of people dying from a bullet <br>Ah flashbacks. Sure are relevant when it comes to present timeline. Not to mention women. Oda always go out of his way to avoid that his female characters fight and/or be harmed in any way, yet you guys are convinced he killed off not only a woman, but a pretty woman with a distinctive character design and a mysterious backstory.<br>And I'm the delusional one.</br></br></br>  <br> Oda always go out of his way to avoid that his female characters fight and/or be harmed in any way <br>fuck off tumblr<br>Nami was raped by miss doublefinger<br>Robin was beaten up by crocodile<br>Vivi was beaten up by crocodile<br>Rebecca was beaten by diamante<br>and the list goes on you delusive fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Easily my third favorite pink haired princess in one piece.  <br>unless oda is high as shit I highly doubt he would do something like that. What would the point be anyway? I see no reason for something like that to ha-<br><br>...never you mind</br></br></br>  <br>It wouldnt be worse than surviving a point blank nuke. Your body is suppose to disintegrate, let alone surviving it. There's magical powers in this universe, im sure stab wound can be healed, but it would be way too convenient. But there should be NO WAY someone can survive a point blank nuke. Know why? It was meant to kill TWO ARMIES, who where ALOT further from it than Pell was.</br>  Not saying she is alive but Oda can always come up with some bullshit saying how monet regenerate a new heart using a devil fruit or she took some drug to give herself a new heart at the last minute. Some stupid shit like that.  <br>let's just hope he doesn't</br>  <br>Perona a first you faggot</br>  <br>And they all survived because they were saved at the last minute. Except for Nami, but only because she was fighting against a woman.<br>Stay mad cis scum, the thing is tumblr is right in calling out Oda for being a cancerous white knight.</br></br>  <br> says stupid shit <br> gets proven wrong <br> n-no you, I didn't mean it like that <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>her power is fucking broken. Saddens me she apparently went back to thriller bark. Poor Mihawk.<br><br><br>do you really have to start with this shit? Shut up you retarded motherfucker, no one gives a single shit, go on tumblr or whatever if you want to argue about this retarded stuff</br></br></br></br>  She's not bad either.  Is Hancock supposed to be in her thirties now? Damn shame.  <br>I wish Franky, Robin, Sanji and Zoro kept those outfits, they look based as fuck.</br>  <br> gets proven wrong <br> on a general idea I didn't mean to developp because that wasn't even the main point of my argument <br>Next I'll say all x are like so and you'll tell me "No because they are some who are y" and it won't end because you're an autistic fuck who's obsessed about being right rather than find out the truth.</br></br></br>  Moneygrabbing whore coming through.  <br><br> he's come after me before <br><br>More like he's cum inside me before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vivi a shit.</br>  <br>If the thread goes to shit because of this single post, then it was never worth that much anyways.<br>I do mean it anyways.</br></br>    <br>Meh trying to copy Robin's elegant sexiness. No one can beat her in that regard<br><br>If you're not Robin go lewd or go home! Though Robin can beat anyone in lewd as well?</br></br></br>  Oda really needs to get his shit together with Chopper and Brook. I barely even remember what the first one is supposed to do, and the second while being somehow funny has been borderline useless for a long time.<br><br><br>with the kind of retards in these threads it wouldn't be unusual, just please keep that shit away from here, we'll have enough after the chapter gets released</br></br></br>  <br>At least she can take a punch and start hitting Luffy back. She gets my respect for that. Most of the other girls introduced after her have been like cheap replacements.</br>  <br>he may as well be smoker considering he's high 24/7</br>  <br>Its literally not fair for other OP girls, how can they compete with this?</br>  I'm downloading the tanks and I've been faced with the horrible decision between MangaStream and PowerManga, which is the lesser evil?  <br>Guess you're right.</br>  <br>No you literally said something retarded and then you were called out. No amount of damage controlling can change that.</br>  <br>Mangastream by far.</br>  <br>Powermanga is much better, both in terms of scans and translations</br>  <br>I heard powermanga is very good, but I've never seen it for myself. I think Mangastream is good enough, there are a few errors but they're easy to spot. <br>You should probably check the viz dump though.</br></br>  <br>Okay, I did. Do you feel better now ?</br>  <br>huh</br>  <br>First off what the fuck are you talking with the tanks?<br><br>Secondly PowerManga is not a lesser evil its the only scanlations that are good for One Piece. It's translation is 2nd only to viz. Its ony flaw is its slow release schedule.</br></br></br>  <br>tanks = tankoubons</br>  <br>Why would I?</br>  <br><br>Are the Viz releases downloadable somewhere? Madokami doesn't seem to have them.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, Viz is the best of the bunch obviously, although the tanks fuck with the sound effects by translating those too. Still, the quality has been top notch for a long ass time, though some of the earlier volumes are a bit sketchy. Still better than any of the unofficial scans.<br><br>No idea where you'd find that shit online for free though, I just buy the physical tankobons and use mangastream for fresh chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>You cant download tanks moron.</br>  <br>Are you serious you nigger?<br><br>Powermanga is far and away the most accurate translation this series has. If you're going to download the series in bulk go for PM. Its only downside is that it's slower in releasing new chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>You seemed pretty mad. I just hope I eased your suffering.</br>  <br><br>Soon you will.</br></br>  <br>Try "vizanon" in the archive.</br>  My issue with Viz is how they like to ne special snowlakes on things.<br><br>EVERYONE says Enel, they say Eneru. Sure that's how the nips say it but its not how WE say. Many more examples of that shit, and its so annoying tio read.<br><br>So up on their high horse, that think everything they say is the standard.</br></br></br></br>  <br> still trying to damage control  <br>Let it go m8</br></br>  <br>I think they still keep Zoro as Zolo too for whatever shitty reason. Even Oda confirmed it as Zoro.</br>  <br>Have a Lawlu pic.</br>  <br>Of course they do, they think because they are paid to translate they cant be wrong. So they wont ever change.</br>  <br>They have license issue with zoro's Name because of 4kids or some shit like that</br>  <br>yeah I cant read viz because of that, also the fact that they translate some things wrong like doflamingos last name, etc.</br>  <br>Nah its solely because Zolo has been printed for so long now. Does 4kidz still even exist?</br>  <br><br>Thats for copyright reasons. Zorro is/was a registered copyright, and now they've done Zolo for over a decade so they stick with it. <br><br>My biggest issue with Viz is the font's they use and the illegible crying text. I don't remember either being as big a problem when I was a kid</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's mostly just due to continuity rather than licensing, although licensing issues are the original cause. They started with Zolo for whatever reason and as a result have stuck with it because you can't just change a name in between publications even if it is technically wrong. I don't really understand why people are so upset over it though, doesn't really bother me at all. Though it is a bit retarded in the sense that you can see the actual spelling of his name in his bounty poster very early on.</br>  <br>Actually, Oda confirmed Donquijote is the correct spelling. Check the Law flashback, he spells it out in English for the first time on Rocinante's marine picture, the one Sengoku has in his drawer.</br>  <br>I refuse to believe that. Why don't they go after Oda? I think you can go after anyone for copyright shit, regardless of country. That's why they went after the piratebay people.</br>  <br><br> not Tanjiahdo Lofulamingo </br></br>  <br>In the US/West its apparently a big deal<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro<wbr>#Copyright_and_trademark_disputes<br><br>I think Viz just wanted to avoid any trouble back then.

Like all the Cinderella Girls.</br>  <br>N O</br>  <br>This is true.</br>  <br> that face <br> my dick <br>every time</br></br></br>  <br>I prefer boys to have boy's haircuts so she's fine as it is, girls with really short hair and boys with long hair just looks wrong.</br>        <br> 1007+1008 <br> still thinking haircuts are gendered </br></br>  <br><br>Have some salt.</br></br>  <br>I usually prefer long hair. But in case of Miki she's so arousing that I don't care.</br>  <br>Good thing miki has a condom, impregnating the other girls in the middle of a zombie Apocalypse would've been a bad idea.</br>    Is it just me or are the zombies in the Gakkou universe pretty much harmless?<br><br>If you survived the initial onslaught it seems like you can get by pretty easy. <br><br>They are slow as hell, get distracted by noise, hell I mean a 16 year old high school girl with a shovel can mow down masses of them, I'm surprised there are not more survivors, unless the virus is airborne or something something seems off./</br></br></br></br>  I watched this show without knowing anything about it.<br><br>I have no reaction face to convey enough shock at the end of the first ep. I thought it would be cute girls doing cute things, I was settling in to be comfy.<br><br>Pretty glad I didn't know anything, made the first ep hit harder.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be a crime to allow such thing to happen.</br>  <br>When the hell did that happen? A special I missed?</br>  <br>Hika a sex.</br>  So I'm thinking of cosplaying Gakkou-gurashi! as a way of showing my appreciation for the series. Is it too early? Has it been done already?    <br>I think that might be why, actually. All the initial survivors got cocky and did something stupid, got bitten, and killed their group who didn't realize it sooner. Pretty much exactly like what happened to Miki and Kei's group</br>  <br>Unless you're a cute 17 year old girl, you'd be better off cosplaying as pilot-kun or bike helmet man.</br>    <br>He might get away with cosplaying Senpai, not like he has a face anyway.</br>  <br><br>It depends<br><br> How fat are you? <br> Are you even a cute little girl? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the case in pretty much all slow zombie fiction<br><br>There is never, ever a scenario that does a good job of explaining how armed governments were done in by a bunch of plodding, easily duped wieners who are less intelligent than most modern calculators <br><br>Try not to worry about it and enjoy the show</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this.<br>considering that a fairly normal group of highschool girls survived this, it's weird that not many more people survived</br></br>  <br>Or Yuki since people say she's just an old man in disguise.</br>  <br>No point in a Kurumi wig if it's going to be neatly brushed.</br>      <br>Initial panic at the beginning of the breakout probably caused most of the deaths.</br>    <br>What the fuck is wrong with Rii and Miki, do they not understand what beaches are?</br>    <br>Is short okay?<br><br><br> BMI 16 <br> Cute is subjective </br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>They love to dress extra sexy for the beach.</br>  <br>Why is there a strong gust of wind coming out of Yuki's left hip? Why is Taroumaru trying to jump on her back? He's a good boy, he knows better.</br>  <br><br>in terms of capabilities, uniformed japanese highschool girls are ranked above the US armed forces.</br></br>  <br>Reposting my theory (which was in relation to Helicopter-kun):<br><br>We know there are multiple strains. Let's say they hit the town at the same time. A fast-acting (mostly) non-lethal airborne/contact strain that cripples you up very quickly, and the regular zombie strain passed through bite/scratches.<br><br>The first strain knocked out and crippled a sizeable chunk of the town very quickly making them easy-pickings for the zombie strain, giving it enough of a foothold to be effective.<br><br>Because of the earlier outbreak in the 60s, though, anyone whose parents or grandparents survived that could have a natural resistance to the milder strain (which is how the girls survived). They could however still be carriers.<br><br>When the military discovered the note, they were very cautious, with full haz-mat suits, etc. and the note is clearly bagged. However later we see the pilot handling the note outside the bag. THAT'S when he was infected (with the fast-acting mild strain off the girls).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi is using kneepads and Yuki a fucking hat, I doubt anyone knows what a beach is aside from Megu-nee.</br>  <br>No. She's hot as hell the way she is.</br>  <br> Extra sexy <br><br>Rii is just being a slut<br><br>REMOVE RII</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unless the virus is airborne or something <br>It's hinted that there were spores from mushrooms. And it's possble that it has some evil sexret  I hope the omnious corporation thing is a red herring, wpould be a nice twist </br></br>  <br>Put brackets around the text and fix that cancerous font, and it's perfect.</br>  The college girls are gonna die right?  <br>There's no way all of them are living</br>  <br> Megu-nee <br>Why the fuck would you wear Daisy Dukes to the beach</br></br>  <br> sexret  <br>Well, that got unintentional freudian.</br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  <br>Kettle calling pot black?</br>  <br> Living a perfectly safe and secure lifestyle <br> Suddenly new people arrive <br> "Hmm... Maybe we should change how we live." <br><br>Of course they're going to die.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well if the virus was that fast acting and potent that would explain why there are no attempts(I guess out side of pilot kun) by any kind of military organization to seek out survivors or eradicate the zombies. <br><br>I mean we don't even know how widespread the outbreak is, could be that it's just in the girl's town/city and government just decided to quarantine the area and let everyone rot.</br></br></br>  <br>She's just an 11 year old girl, she doesn't know any better!</br>  <br>And I thought Yuki being 18 was a stretch.</br>  <br>Let's be honest things break down those solar panels and whatever reserves of food they have left are going to run out they always knew they had to do something about it but just put it off till tomorrow so they could drink, play video games and finger each other. <br><br>But the arrival of the high school girls(who are a lot more resourceful than their sempais) are wake up call for them to get off their asses and do something.<br><br>Although I'm with you all 3 of those girls are dead as fuck, I think the mangaka just introduced them so he can kill them off since the original 4 are untouchable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's too young though, so you can't blame her. She probably doesn't even know what a dick is. Hence why she is temporarily in love with Koma-chan.</br>  <br>What if  Rii kills them instead of the zombies  ?</br>  <br> miki goes to highschool <br> it gets destroyed <br> miki goes to uni <br> it (presumably) gets destroyed <br>it's all her fault.<br><br>also i noticed that rii is taller than any of the university girls.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which girls do you think are going to die before the series end and how will they die, /a/?  <br>Cant do, since miki is a boy.</br>  <br> girls doing laundry <br> one of the college girls throws the bear into the washer  <br> rii comes in <br> finds her imouto in the washer <br> stabs the fuck out of her  <br><br>I can see it happening</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> temporarily <br><br>IT'S PURE LOVE</br></br></br>  <br>Would you kiss an infected ? where ?</br>  <br>Are you saying boys don't get cuter when they have long hair?</br>  <br>Right on the sumptuous rotting pungent pussy.

She may be a slut, but garters are one of my weaknesses. <br><br> If only we had a pantyhose gurashi </br></br></br>  <br>Miki being a slut is just a meme.

And pointy. Like Batman or something.</br>  <br>I do, I just couldn't post when the question was posed.</br>  <br> Prevents people from seeing her huge bulge* <br>fix'd</br></br>  <br>What people?</br>  <br>You</br>  <br>It's a known fact that anime wind only blows up skirts of girls that are sluts.</br>  <br> Like Batman or something.  <br>Now I want to see Batman as it would be if you replaced Batman with Yuki and she beat all the villians by challenging them to sports day competitions or took them on a field trip and made friends with them.</br></br>  <br>I'm a long hair fag, but she's an exception to the rule<br><br> whyd she have to lose the sexy eyepatch </br></br></br>  <br><br>Miki is a cute trap as well.</br></br>  <br>She should've really kept the eyepatch</br>  <br>But then you wouldn't be able to lick the scar that it left.</br>  MIKI IS A PURE GIRL<br><br>PURE</br></br>  <br>I don't even know where to begin</br>  <br>Why is Yuki's uniform blue while everyone else's is green? I thought it was by year, but isn't Rii-san in the same year as Yuki at least?</br>  <br>invert the colors brah</br>  <br>Stopped by to say this is wrong</br>  <br>Because SYMBOLISM</br>  <br>You're right, she's shit like all idols.</br>  <br>You begin from the mouth obviously.</br>  <br>Is it lewd if they exchange bandages?</br>      <br>Their uniforms are negatives of each other, and all the kids in Yuki's delusion have the same color as her. It represents her detachment from and stark opposition to the real world, and the delusions she's having which are literally the opposite of reality.</br>  <br><br>In that case, shouldn't Yuki's blouse be black?</br></br>     Wearing garters during a zombie apocalypse <br> Pure <br><br>Pick one</br></br></br>  I just realized next episode will confirm whether or not miki is a slut  <br>She isn't.</br>  <br><br>She is</br></br>  <br>I hope after the next episode will spur a few more Kei fanart.</br>  <br><br><br>Who to belive?<br><br> It's  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Properly checked and agreed.</br>  <br>Isn't she?</br>  <br>Check these quints.<br><br>Trap with ass and thighs confirmed.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to bury my face in her thighs and die.</br>  <br>Reverse trap, maybe.</br>  <br><br>Those quints don't lie<br><br>Miki is Saika confirmed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, no one in the entirety of the series has ever even thought that Miki is a boy. When the School Life club found her in the mall, they immediately referred to Miki as a girl</br>  Are the guys at the university gay or something? Why would they stay in a place full of dudes instead of fucking girls and playing games all day long?  <br>Is Miki's hair is getting longer?</br>  <br> Because fucking women is all that matters in life. <br><br>Also, they're not all dudes. There's at least 1 women with them based on the silhouette.</br></br></br>  Worst Gakkou Gurashi right here.  <br>That's a pretty small bath</br>  <br>I will fucking kill you and feed your corpse to the dogs.</br>  <br>Say that in my face, nigger.</br>  <br>He didn't say that Rii was bad, just that compared to the other Gurashis, Rii is the worst. This is true</br>  <br><br>A SLUT</br></br>  <br>Looks like two girls imo.</br>  <br> in my face <br>How do I get in your face?</br></br>  How can anyone hate this girl.  <br>Rii is shit. Shit.</br>  <br>It's not that we hate her, but her competition is Yuki, Kurumi and Miki.</br>  <br>Her symbolic bear ear looked like a tiny tophat in the thumbnail. I was disappointed when I realized it wasn't.</br>  today's the day we finally figure out if kei is kill or not<br><br>are you hype</br></br>  <br>Says the Kurumi fag</br>  <br>Doesn't it come out tomorrow?</br>  <br>Jokes one you I'm a Yuki fag.</br>  <br>Depends on time zone</br>  <br> yurupfag </br>  Why is Rii the worst slut?  <br> Before fighting me you must defeat my generals first </br>  <br>Isn't it just going to be a mall flashback ep? It won't tell us anything new, kei is a shit person anyways abandoning miki like that.</br>  <br>Because she is against three best girls.</br>  <br>Because Miki is already best slut.</br>  <br>We don't know, it might be expanded on like Megu-nee was. There's certainly room to do so, Miki and Kei trapped in the room and Kei leaving was like a page long. But at this pace, I do wonder what's gonna happen for the ending</br>  Megu-nee has the best body  even after rotting   <br>The anime seems to be expanding on some of the backstory that the manga didn't cover. If it is a flashback episode, we can probably expect at least a couple of minutes of Miki and Kei shopping/chatting/whatever.</br>  <br>The logical place to end it would be helicopter and aftermath/graduation, I forget what happened after they got miki and before the helicopter but iirc not much</br>  <br>Literally the whole point of Miki's arc was her learning that people need more than just surival to live, Kei was an illustration of that and outright bluntly said it.<br><br> Of course they could have solved this by just learning to reaffirm their existence by being inimate with eachother at all hours of the day. </br></br></br>    How would you comfort her after she gets bullied?  <br>I'd still hit that.</br>  <br>A ton. Sports Day, Miki finds out about the shelter, Kurumi goes to explore and gets infected, Miki kills Megu-zombie and gets the serum for Kurumi, Yuuri has a breakdown and Yuki snaps out of her delusions for a bit</br>  <br> Yuki snaps out of her delusions for a bit <br>You mean permanently</br></br>  <br> checked </br>   this thread <br><br>Why am I even here anymore?</br></br>  Why do I keep thinking that Miki is actually a trap?<br><br>And what's with the different, blue and white uniform Yuki wears, as opposed to the green and white uniform everyone else wears?</br></br>  Miki is literally worst girl.<br><br><br>That's not true either.<br><br><br>She's not Kurumi or Miki.<br><br><br>Because they got shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah that one's after the helicopter. This one is just where Yuki enters a classroom, finds it wrecked and freaks out</br>    <br>People here literally hate her.<br><br>And she's better than at least Kurumi and Miki, who are seasonal waifu tier.</br></br></br>  <br>Transforming this shit into a permanent general is what ends up killing a franchise. There are several manga examples</br>  <br>Because you can't escape, and so can't I.<br><br>But arguing about taste and making this a general turned it into shit.</br></br></br>  <br> thinking anything on /a/ even remotely affects the anime industry <br>Don't go full blown idiot.</br></br>  <br><br>It's just shitposting until the next ep. comes out<br><br>I want to get out  but I just keep coming back </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, /a/ threads will kill a franchise.</br>  <br>He's talking about the fanbase, obviously.</br>  <br>I really need to re read the manga I have no recollection of the sports day at all.</br>  <br> /u/fags forcing their shit <br> muh shovel <br> Trapfags <br> I want to marry shovel <br> "Why did helicopter-kun gave up?" every single fucking thread <br> ShovelxMikii OTP <br> Metal gear derail <br> Why is shovel so sexual <br> muh epic edits <br> Shovel <br> "why should I read the manga if this is getting animated?

I hope we get scans for that too.</br></br></br>  <br>Some new info<br> As Wakaba is Sonoko's ancestor, this story will reveal many things about the Nogi household <br> Will also touch on the subject of how important a miko is <br> In Nowayu, the existence of Heroes is not a secret. The whole mankind are aware of Vertices' threat. </br></br></br></br>  <br> also touch on the subject of how important a miko is <br>Tougou confirmed for Messiah.</br></br>  <br>YuYuYu also kind hinted at Tougou is quite important as a messenger, further increase the chance that Yuuna got boosted into godhood</br>  I wonder how soon we'll find out what their Yuuna looks like and get to start speculating beyond wild guesses on what their connection is.  <br>I'm fully expecting her to look exactly like Yuuna.</br>  <br>If she does, we probably won't get an actual picture showing it till it's halfway through, and we'll never get to see what she's thinking.</br>  <br>Don't know how reliable this bit of info is but apparently   grade school Wakaba had to see her new friends getting slaughtered in front of her.  </br>  <br>Are you getting this from 2ch and/or other nip sites?</br>  <br>From here: http://otakomu.jp/archives/284065.h<wbr>tml<br>The spoiler bit is not included in the main article so I don't know if it's valid or not.</br></wbr></br>  Wait what's happening? I didn't follow the other threads.  <br>This is really old news so I don't know how out of the loop you are but, a new LN is being released. It's set 300 years before the anime when the vertex first attacked and the protagonist is Sonoko's ancestor, Nogi Wakaba, hence the name NoWaYu.<br><br>There was also a new LN chapter with the usual Yuushas set after Sonoko After and confirmation that there will be more stuff released with the YuYuYu team, though format was not specified.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I thought it was an anime announcement or something like that.</br>  <br>When the new LN is getting released?</br>  <br>The newest LN chapter is the one where the Yuushas find the old diary in Sonoko's house, right? And it's only 3 pages long?</br>  Does the new VN already have a full translation patch?<br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Read the OP again.</br>  <br> no male characters <br>I'm glad they know how to keep policies that are working.</br></br>   Wakaba's hair style and personality are somewhat similar to Sumi <br> Hinata's Hinatas and personality are somewhat similar to Tougou  <br>This feels so weird.</br></br>  Definitely seems like this is going to be another darkness-absorbing LN so they can give Yuuna a happy ending in the anime. I hope they at least manage to reincarnate or something.    Chikage and Hinata's last names now are different than what we got about a month ago, right? Is it a mistake? Or will we have a story explanation?  <br>They got mistranslated the first time.</br>  <br> There was also a new LN chapter with the usual Yuushas set after Sonoko After <br>Can I get a link?</br></br>  <br>Yuuna remembering the girls who sacrificed themselves to let her return to her own time.</br>  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#!bEkXnSRK!UTcDo<wbr>kywlhMvp3u1qlL6DviKC80yigoPzAoPGARV<wbr>H3k</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br> Thanks. I forgot, wasn't there a blog with info on YYY compiled? I remember there being one with VN translations </br>  <br>Japanese names are a bitch. Even if you know how a name is written you don't necessarily know how it's pronounced, so people have to make guesses and sometimes those guesses turn out to be wrong.</br>  <br> http://otakomu.jp/archives/284065.<wbr>html</wbr> <br>Do they   lose their families as well? Are they living by themselves on Shikoku? Like the Inubozaki sisters do in the future? </br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3930730756<wbr></wbr>  <br>They show them as both 14 and as 4th graders.<br>Looks like there'll really be a timeskip then.</br></br>  <br>The story begin at 2018 but most of the chapter being recalling on what happen in 2015, then towards the end it back to 2018.</br>  <br>Only 3 years. So they are going to show the original attack and then skip to the girls life as heros defending Shinjuu on Shikoku after escaping.</br>  <br>whoa, so fast</br>  the vertex attached in the chapter doesn't look like the 12 zodiac vertexes...  Is translator-kun still around?  <br>The one in the black and white picture looks like the mini vertex.</br>  so if I read correctly, there are only 2 characters have made their debut this chapter?  <br>the B&amp;W one is stardust (so-called vertex cells)</br>  <br>PRAISED BE SHINJU-SAMA<br><br>Now where are our resident translators?</br></br></br>  <br>This afternoon,<br>I peered over the Seto Inland Sea from Marugame Castle.<br>Each time I stand here, I renew my vow.<br>I swear to take back the world stolen from us.<br>We as heroes are the weapons to achieve that goal.<br>Small may our numbers be, but we must fulfill our duty.<br>Among our comrades,<br>A proactive stance like Yuuna's is hard to find in this world.<br>I can see an unstable side to [censored by taisha], but...<br>Hero Record Aug 2018 AD<br>Nogi Wakaba's Record</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> [censored by Taisha] <br>Chikage?</br></br>  <br> A proactive stance like Yuuna's is hard to find in this world. <br><br>Oh damn, so is Yuuna like a legendary hero or something?</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br> no glasses girls <br>Oh for FUCK'S sake.</br></br>  <br><br>One of Chikage's kanji may have actually changed a bit though. 群 to 郡.

Ever since before she could remember, Wakaba had been training in iai, and thus the weight of that sword felt quite familiar to her body.<br>The midsummer sunlight poured down from above, causing sweat to seep from her skin.<br>Cicadas were chirping busily around her.<br>She closed her eyes.<br>She still vividly remembered-- the despair and anger from that day.<br><br>* * *</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>July 30, 2015<br>Nogi Wakaba, a fifth grader at the time, was taking refuge at a shrine's kagura-den in Shimane Prefecture.<br>She was on a field trip from Kagawa to Shimane when an intense earthquake occurred. Earthquakes kept happening intermittently after that, and so the teachers decided it was an emergency situation and evactuated the students to the shrine, which was the shelter in the area. The number of people in the shelter, which included nearby residents, was quite high.<br>Wakaba's school was holding a field trip in the middle of summer break due to the number of lesson days, but it was completely unexpected that they would get caught in an emergency situation like this.<br>As class president, Wakaba took a roll call of her classmates and informed their homeroom teacher that all were present and accounted for. According to what she heard from the teachers, apparently, the earthquakes weren't happening just in Shimane, but everywhere throughout the country. Fissures and tsunamis were happening as a result, and damage was happening throughout Japan...<br>However, Wakaba and her classmates seemed to actually find it exciting how this turn of events happened during their field trip. Friends were talking amongst each other and those with smartphones were checking news sites.<br>"You think we'll have to stay here until tomorrow?"<br>"Wha? But we're finally on a field trip and everything."<br>"Anyone have cards?"<br>A group of three girls was chatting amongst themselves. Wakaba looked towards them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the original stardust design. Just the mouth and no body, more alien feeling.</br>  <br>  However, Wakaba and her classmates seemed to actually find it exciting how this turn of events happened during their field trip. Friends were talking amongst each other and those with smartphones were checking news sites <br><br>Stupid kids</br></br></br>  <br>(I should probably warn them... no, there's no need to go that far. Letting them chat like this might actually help soften their anxiety.)<br>As she had that thought in mind,<br>"...Ah, Nogi-san's glaring at us."<br>"Are we being too noisy?"<br>"Let's quiet it down before she gets angry at us."<br>The girls who had been talking softened tehir voices.<br>(Ah... I wasn't particularly mad or anything ...Does my face really look that scary...?)<br>"Wah-kah-bah chan!"<br>Wakaba turned around as the voice called to her to see a camera flash before her eyes. It was her classmate and childhood friend, Uesato Hinata with a smartphone at the ready.<br>"Mmm... Wakaba-chan... you're so picturesque with that listless look on your face. The shrine building in the background is great too. That's one more picture in my treasured Wakaba-chan image collection."<br>"Hi~na~ta~... Don't collect photos of me! Delete it!"<br>"No! This image collection is my lifework!"<br>Hinata boldly declared something incomprehensible.<br>"Please don't make such a scary face. Your forehead's gonna get wrinkly, you know! Squishy squishy."<br>"... Could you please not press on people's foreheads with your fingers?"<br>"I'm just trying to loosen you up. It's because of that strict face of yours that classmates get scared of you just like what happened now."<br>"You... you saw that?"<br>Wakaba's face heated up in embarrassment.<br>"Now, now, Wakaba-chan, it's because you're always so serious. Ever since first grade, you've been an honor student and class president. Our classmates have this image of you being an 'iron woman'."<br>"Uggh..."<br>She was aware of it herself, but it was still a shock to hear it again.<br>"But... You just gotta shatter that image yourself!"<br>Hinata grinned and took Wakaba by the hand as she lead her back to that same group of female classmates.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Wakaba is Sumi and Hinata is Sonoko?</br>  <br>"H-hey, wait!?"<br>"Good evening!"<br>Hinata ignored Wakaba's confusion as she called out to the girls. The girls were just as confused.<br>"Sorry about that. The truth is that Wakaba-chan wanted to join in on your conversation."<br>"H-Hinata, what are you--!?"<br>"What are you being so embarrassed about? You see, she wasn't thinking of giving you girls a warning. She was actually having a cute little inner struggle of how to join in on the conversation."<br>"Wha? That's not--"<br>When Wakaba tried to deny the story, Hinata covered Wakaba's mouth.<br>"Mmm! Mmm!"<br>The three girls were confused for a second--<br>But eventually that confusion seemed to blow away and they smiled.<br><br>"Hmm, that kinda changes my image of Nogi-san."<br>"Well, she always seems precise, and she's quite the honor student, after all"<br>"Yeah, yeah. I thought she was a scarier, stricter person!"<br>"I see what you mean-- Oh, and Wakaba-chan's unsociable, so she's at a disadvantage in that regard, I think."<br>It was a bizarre progression of events, but Wakaba and Hinata joined the group of three girls and talked with them. Hinata spoke with them as familiarly as one would speak with years-long friends.<br>She had the sociability to get along with anyone, which Wakaba lacked. Because of Wakaba's overly-serious nature, she felt a little disconnected with the rest of the class.<br>"But she's a super cute girl on the inside. I, Uesato Hinata, can attest to that. So please get along with her, okay?"<br>"C-c-c-c-cute...? What are you talking about!?"<br>Despite Wakaba glaring at her, Hinata didn't shy away and just said 'now now'.<br>"Ahahah, that's so funny. Don't worry. We're already friends with Nogi-san now."<br>The girls smiled and said that as they saw Wakaba and Hinata's interactions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>that one out of frame girl</br>  <br>Is that Youko in the back?</br>  <br>Hinata has boobs already in 4th grade?<br>She must eat the same food as Hotaru from Non Non Biyori.</br></br>  <br>After they had talked for a while, Wakaba went outside the kagura-den. Though it was already evening, the July heat was still substantial, so she wanted to feel a little bit of the evening breeze.<br>From time immemorial, a shrine's torii was said to be a boundary to an outer world. Back in the age before people had forgotten religious piety, a shrine was treated as another world. Wakaba did not know that shrines held that meaning, but she was able to feel the place's tranquility.<br>When she looked up at the sky, she could see the twinkling of countless stars.<br>"So this is where you were, Wakaba-chan. It's getting late. Aren't you going to sleep?"<br>Hinata had gone outside as well and she stood beside Wakaba.<br>"Well, a problem could arise while we're sleeping for all we now. I thought I'd stay awake just in case."<br>"The teachers should be the ones to stay awake, though."<br>"I'm class president, so it's my duty."<br>"Haah~... Really, Wakaba-chan. I don't know if you're just being way too serious or what."<br>Hinata smiled slightly in resignation.<br>"So I'll stay awake with you."<br>"... You don't need to accompany me, you know?"<br>"No, it's because I'm your childhood friend. I'll always be with you."<br>When Hinata answered in such a clear tone of voice, Wakaba had no more forceful words to say.<br>"... Hinata."<br>"What is it?"<br>"Thanks for what you did back there. If you weren't around, I would've ended up distancing myself from our classmates again."<br>"No, no, I just don't like it when people misunderstand you, Wakaba-chan."<br>Hinata spoke as if she had only done the natural thing to do.<br>But Wakaba wasn't satisfied with just that.<br>"A reward for everything. That's the Nogi way of life."<br>That was a commandment that Wakaba's grandmother often spoke of. Wakaba loved her grandmother dearly, and so she treasured those words of hers.<br>"So I want to reward you for your friendship, Hinata. If there's anything you want me to do for you, then just ask.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So this is 4th grade. So they are Nanoha/Fate age? Or the age of Vivio in Vivid?</br>  <br>I'm expecting rest of the chapter be about Wakaba rewarding Hinata.</br>  <br>"Well, if you insist... hmm, then how about you help me grow my treasured image collection by wearing... some sort of cosplay? ... While we're at it, how about something a little extreme..."<br>Hinata muttered something improper.<br>Perhaps Wakaba spoke too soon... she was starting to regret her decision a little.<br>"Well, I'll take my time to think of what I should have you do, Wakaba-chan. Anyway, for now, it'd be great for you to be more at ease when you talk to people in class. If you do, then everyone else will start to understand you and get along with you better. If you ever get nervous about talking to someone, I'll help you out just like I did now."<br>Hinata's words slowly sank into Wakaba's body.<br>(I can get along with everyone better... huh?)<br>Wakaba was a little detached from the class, but perhaps she herself had been unconsciously distancing herself from her classmates. Perhaps if she actually tried talking to people like they did now, it would be simple to get along with everyone.<br><br>"Ah, but then if you get really popular, you might not care about me anymore, Wakaba-chan. You'll toss me out like a woman of the past [TN: basically an ex-girlfriend, but I don't think Wakaba caught that part], won't you... yoyoyo."<br>"Wh-what are you talking about!? Of course I wouldn't do that! No matter what happens, you're my best friend!"<br>As Wakaba struggled to put together words, Hinata smiled strangely.<br>"It was just a joke. Oh, Wakaba-chan--"<br><br>Suddenly, the ground shook intensely.<br><br>(This... is on a completely different scale than the other tremors...!)<br>The tremors made it difficult to even stand. Wakaba kept her stance lowered to prevent herself from falling down. Beside her, Hinata let out a small shriek as her rear fell to the ground.<br>After a few dozen seconds, the tremors settled.<br>"That was a huge tremor, huh... Hinata, you okay?"<br>Wakaba held her hand out to Hinata.<br>But without taking her hand, Hinata just muttered with a ghostly pale look on her face.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   When she looked up at the sky, she could see the twinkling of countless stars. <br><br>I don't think they are stars Wakaba...</br></br>  <br> Shimane Prefecture <br>Seems like the setting is some totally irrelevant backwater again. It's probably safer to stay away from the cities when the gods themselves want to exterminate your species.<br><br><br>They should be around 10 years old, so they're about as old as Vivio in Vivid or Nanoha in A's.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuna, what are you doing slightly off panel 300 years ago?</br>  Did we get anything new at wonfes?  <br> Shimane Prefecture <br>Also home of the Izumo Shrine, one of the oldest continuously operating shrines in Shinto.</br></br>  <br>Could anyone else see her or does she only appear in camera shots like in Re-Kan?<br>I guess this confirms Yuuna was "spirit traveling" during her vegetative state?</br></br>  <br>Also those other 2 girls have different eyes without circles. Probably not important though.</br>  <br>Whoa, you're right. Isn't the Izumo Shrine also the one where the legend about the war between Amaterasu and the gods of the Earth came from?<br><br>Seems pretty likely that Izumo even is the shrine where Wakaba and her girls are taking shelter in, considering it's just about the only location of interest for a school trip in the region.</br></br></br>  <br>According to Wiki, another name for the shrine is Izumo-TAISHA. Coincidence? I think not.</br>  <br> Isn't the Izumo Shrine also the one where the legend about the war between Amaterasu and the gods of the Earth came from? <br>Yup. That leak is sounding more and more legit the more we learn.</br></br>  <br>"I'm scared..."<br>"Huh?"<br>Hinata's body was trembling slightly.<br>"Wa-Wakaba-chan... s... something really, really scarey is..."<br>She looked up to the sky as she spoke.<br>Thinking there was something up there, Wakaba looked up as well.<br>On her first look, what she saw was an ordinary starry sky.<br>But she was mistaken.<br>The countless stars in the sky squirmed as if they were drifting about on the surface of water.<br>At first, Wakaba thought the star-like objects were birds or something.<br>But their movements were irregular and it would be strange for so many birds to be flying in the sky so late at night.<br>And then several of those stars got bigger and bigger--<br><br>Despair fell from the sky.<br><br>One of the star-like objects fell onto the roof of the kagura-den. It definitely was not a bird at all. Its entire body was an almost unnatural white, its size far more gigantic than a human, with an ominous mouth-like organ. It appeared to be like a deep sea animal that had evolved far differently than terrestrial animals, or possibly an invertebrate that was born under imperfect conditions. In any case, it was clearly different from any living being known to mankind, and therefore, the simplest name to call it was-- a "monster".<br>And it wasn't alone. Two, three... several came falling from the sky in quick succession, tearing apart the kagura-den's roof and walls with their teeth and breaking in.<br>"What... are those things...?"<br>Wakaba stood stock still at the bizarre sight unraveling before her.<br>On unsteady feet-- Hinata stood up. A strange light imbued her eyes and hex-like words leaked from her mouth.<br><br>"--...----......----......----"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Despair fell from the sky. <br>The happening</br></br>    <br> A strange light imbued her eyes and hex-like words leaked from her mouth. <br>Hinata is a miko?</br></br>  <br>It looks like Chikage has them as well.</br>  Should i continue with creating a pdf version of noginovel?<br> http://www.mediafire.com/view/met38<wbr>3707ycggib/Nogi_Wakaba_is_a_Hero.pd<wbr>f</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br>Yes, please do it dear anon.</br>  <br>Yes please</br>  <br>Everyone has them, just not those 2.</br>  <br>The moment Wakaba tried to ask what was wrong, people darted out from inside the kagura-den, screaming.<br>"Kyaaaaaaaah!!"<br>"Wh-wha-what are those monsters!?"<br>(Khh!)<br>Wakaba immediately rushed to the kagura-den. Hinata grabbed her by the hand.<br>"I'm going too."<br>The strange light had disappeared from Hinata's eyes, and instead, they displayed an intense will. Her tone of voice was firm as well.<br>Wakaba began to wonder what was with her bizarre state just a few seconds ago...? There was no time to think about that. All that mattered now was to protect their classmates for now.<br><br>Wakaba and Hinata rushed into the kagura-den. And what they saw-- was people being eaten.<br>The bizarre white creatures were eating the people who were too slow to escape with their mouth-like organs. Their mouths became stained red by blood and beneath their giant bodies were pieces of half-eaten people. Including the completely disfigured remains of students from Wakaba's school.<br>"Ah... ahh..."<br>A groan leaked out of Wakaba's mouth.<br>She couldn't believe the scene unfurling before her eyes. It felt too unreal. The friends she had been enjoyed talking to less than an hour ago were now reduced to unspeakable remains.<br>"Waaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!!)<br>Wakaba rushed towards the bizarre creatures. She was driven by rage for her murdered friends and the sense of duty to prevent any further death. As she ran, she picked up a fragment of wood that had probably broken off when the roof was destroyed, and pierced the fragment's pointed end into one of the monsters.<br>But... for some reason, there was no feedback.<br>The white giant flung Wakaba away like a bug. Her small body fell onto an altar inside the shrine. The altar broke, sending a shock and pain through Wakaba's entire body.<br>"Ugh... gh..."<br>Her body wouldn't move.<br>She moved just her head and saw the bizarre creatures looking her way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The classmates don't.</br>  <br>I rechecked some parts of anime and everyone has those circles.</br>  <br> Their mouths became stained red by blood and beneath their giant bodies were pieces of half-eaten people. Including the completely disfigured remains of students from Wakaba's school. <br><br>fucking brutal</br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking about the other two in </br>  <br>Okada is that you?</br>  <br><br><br>Ok, she's dead, she wasn't neither of the 2 Yuunas.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't jink it, anon.</br>  <br> The friends she had been enjoyed talking to less than an hour ago were now reduced to unspeakable remains. <br>I could pass on an anime adaption of that</br></br>  <br>Don't worry. Anime adaptation would be Taisha censored.</br>  <br>If there's spirit-time-travel shenanigans going on, then anything could have happened with Yuuna. I doubt they have time to count the bodies.</br>  <br>I hope there's no time travel, that would be pretty fucking stupid.</br>  <br>Nah, I bet Miss Out of Frame is hiding somewhere else. Why give her eye circles when those other two clear nobodies had none otherwise? I doubt Wakaba was specifically surveying the remains to check that absolutely everyone was dead, she just recognized a few, and assumed the rest.</br>  <br>Seems the most straightfoward explanation for Yuuna being familiar with Wakaba.</br>  <br>Why? They already showed in the WaSuYu manga that Shinju can make them time travel, it makes sense he did the same with Yuuna too.</br>  <br>There was wasuyu manga?</br>  <br>Did I miss something? Because I just remember that Yuuna was silent when they found the 2nd hero diary, I'm not sure how that means she's familiar with her.<br><br>Really? Well, if that's canon material, then that opens up a whole bunch of plot holes like "why don't they go back in time to save Gin from dying" for just one example</br></br></br>  <br>It had like 30 chapters of 4komas, this one was an special:<br><br>http://pastebin.com/k4tYcrXm<br><br>There's a link to download it there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> However, Wakaba and her classmates seemed to actually find it exciting how this turn of events happened during their field trip. <br>It's just Wakaba's classmates who find it exciting. The whole phrase 若葉と同学生の生徒たち can also mean simply Wakaba's classmates. I made the same mistake while reading and got confused because it seemed to contradict the rest of the scene so I came to check.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's just memories of previous Yuushas coming back like in Vivid?</br>  <br>I also think this might be the case.</br>  <br>The people who were quick enough to react had already fled the building, but some of the children in Wakaba's grade were paralyzed with fear.<br>(Run... away...)<br>Wakaba tried to yell that, but she could hardly even muster a whisper. The children who were too slow to run away, and Wakaba herself were all being cornered by the monsters.<br>But then, Hinata's voice rang out.<br>"Wakaba-chan, please reach out your right hand! It should be there!"<br>(My hand...?)<br>Wakaba reached out her right hand as told.<br>She felt it touch something.<br><br>A sword.<br><br>A sword and scabbard rusted from the passing years had been inside the broken altar.<br>(Why... why would a sword be here...?)<br>Wakaba grasped the grip and pulled it in.<br>Throb. Blood suddenly started pounding through her entire body.<br>She felt like she was on fire.<br>She felt like she was drowning.<br>And at the same time-- an unknown strength welled up inside of her as if to reconstruct her body into something else entirely.<br><br>In ancient times, there was a king of the gods of the land whose name was 《Musuu no Buki (無数の武器/Infinite Weapons)》.<br>He and his fellow gods tried to protect the children of their country.<br>Among the king's sacred treasures was a sword from the underworld.<br>Simple. Yet beautiful. A weapon unmatched in murderous power.<br>Its name-- 《Ikutachi (生大刀/The Life Force Blade)》<br><br>When she snapped back to her senses, Wakaba was standing up with that very sword in hand. She could've sworn the blade was rusted, but before she had realized it, the blade was tinged with a vibrant, almost living, brilliance.<br><br>Wakaba sheathed the sword, brought her left foot forward, and held the grip,<br><br><br>You're right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the end?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>There should be few more pages, link to raws is in this thread too.</br>  <br>There is another 5 pages of text</br>  When will the second chapter be out anyway?

She had trained in iai since childhood. Her accumulated experience moved her body naturally.<br>The white monster's giant body approached.<br>As Wakaba drew it from its sheath, her sword was light itself.<br>The being that entered its range was instantly split in two.<br>As Wakaba resheathed the sword, the split monster let out a hard-to-describe cry and vanished.<br>And then one by one, Wakaba cut down the onslaught of bizarre creatures, each with a single stroke of her sword. It was a mysterious sensation. The sword was easy to handle, as if it were but an extension of her arm, and her body moved as swiftly as the wind.<br>In the blink of an eye, all the monsters in the kagura-den were eradicated.<br>"Wakaba-chan! Those strange things are overflowing outside too!"<br>Hinata screamed that as she ran towards Wakaba.<br><br>Before they had realized it, tremendous numbers of the monsters had the kagura-den surrounded outside. The people who tried to escape began to despair at their loss of escape routes.<br>As Wakaba left the kagura-den, she gripped her sword.<br><br>No matter how many dozens of enemies there were, she would not falter--<br>"... Wh-what...?"<br>Something unusual happened with the monsters.<br>Several of them lumped together in the same place and conglomerated like clay, changing form into something even more gigantic...<br>Some changed into a form like a centipede.<br>Some changed into a form like a body surface with an arrow.<br>Some changed into a form like the edge of a section of body tissue, stiffening and rising up.<br>(... They're... evolving...?)<br>Perhaps they had learned that they individually could not defeat Nogi Wakaba. The means they had chosen to oppose an existence stronger than themselves was to "evolve".<br>The evolution of animals was to begin with the simplest single celled organism, take several of those single celled organisms together to create a colony, and from colonies, complex multi-cellular organisms would arise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The evolution of animals <br>I meant biological evolution, whoops.</br></br>  <br>Take your time, no need to rush.

Not to mention the "Gods of the Land" being mentioned in the story. Going by it<br><br> 2015 A.D. - The gods of heaven seeing how mankind has prospered, decide that they have to purge them because they are growing impudent. They send the Vertexes to do execute that task. The gods of the land sided with mankind and took the form of Shinju-sama.  <br> 2018 A.D. - Vertexes invade Shikoku. Some humans are granted the power of Shinju-sama. The first heroes appear. The following year, mankind has managed to repel the vertexes, but they barely have any defenses left. Mankind got the vertexes attacks to be stopped on the condition that they don't leave that land.  <br><br>We're going to be seeing a lot of dead heroes. And<br><br> 2023 A.D. - Taisha and the Gorvenment establish a new system. The Anno Domini era ends. The following year is year 1 of the era of the gods. The era of worshiping Shinju begins. <br><br>We'll have a time skip at some point, perhaps just an epilogue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So are we going to see Wakaba becoming the head of the Taisha? Wakaba obviously has to survive seeing as how she's Sonoko's great great great great great grandma  <br><br>What the white monsters were undergoing was truly biological evolution itself, except at an abnormal speed.<br>It took billions and billions of years for life on earth to evolve from single-celled organisms to multi-cellular organisms. And yet it took these monsters mere minutes.<br>In a certain sense, those monsters could perhaps be said to surpass all life on earth. They were beings like "gods" or "demons"--<br>One of the creatures that had conglomerated and increased in size shot out the arrow that its body had produced. The arrow pierced through all the people in its trajectory, wrecking the kagura-den at the end of its path. With just one strike, a third of the kagura-den crumbled to the ground.<br>Meanwhile, the number of the smaller monsters grew and grew, repeating the cycle of conglomerating and changing form, giving birth to countless numbers of the large monsters.<br>All thoughts of winning disappeared completely from Wakaba's mind. How could she win against countless numbers of enemies with unthinkable destructive force?<br>Right as her entire body threatened to collapse out of despair--<br>What supported her was her best friend.<br>"Please don't give up, Wakaba-chan."<br>"... Hinata..."<br>"I won't let you and everyone die, Wakaba-chan."<br>Hinata spoke with a resolute, and somehow confident tone.<br>Hinata turned to everyone there and shouted.<br>"Everyone follow me! I'll guide you to a safe place!"<br>Hinata then walked forth at an unfaltering pace. Her visage was calm and collected, so much so that it was hard to believe she was a mere 10-year-old girl.<br>"Hinata, where are you...?"<br>"Wakaba-chan, I need you to be the outrider."<br>The current aura about her suggested she would not take no for an answer.<br>"... Okay."<br>There was no time for hesitation. Wakaba had no choice but to trust her friend.<br>"Come with us if you want to live!"<br>With Wakaba and Hinata at the lead, other people followed, though confused. Wakaba cut down any enemies that stood in Hinata's way.<br>(cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Btw pic related is the page before this one</br>  <br> "Come with us if you want to live!" <br><br>I think this is one for the drawfags.</br></br></br>  <br>The group lead by the two reached the shrine's honden. The honden was surrounded by gates and walls, and for some reason, not a single one of the white monsters had appeared within.<br>"They cannot enter here."</br></br>  <br>Most likely Hinata will survive too and will be her Miko.</br>  <br> 2023 A.D. - Taisha and the Gorvenment establish a new system. The Anno Domini era ends. The following year is year 1 of the era of the gods. The era of worshiping Shinju begins. <br><br>That's the part that doesn't match. If this was right that would mean that the year 300 of the Divine Era is 2324 A.D. and Karin's birthday would be on Thursday but in episode 3 they show that 12th of June falls in Sunday.</br></br></br>  <br>The true question is whether Hinata will be the ancestor of the Tougou family, since she's a pretty obvious expy of our favorite lesbian nationalist. <br><br>It is nice how Hinata and Wakaba are the mirror image of Wasshi and Sonoko, with Hinata being the pervy, playful friend and Wakaba being the straight man.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they made a calculation mistake or simply didn't think about keeping the days of the week straight? It's hard to believe that guy didn't have inside information when he got those details right. The thing about gods of the land had never been mentioned anywhere, not the fact that the vertexes first attacked in 2015.<br><br>That said, since it was an unofficial leak they could still change anything they want from it, so it doesn't really serve as a reliable prediction of what's going to happen.</br></br></br>  <br> mfw canonically the main character is implied to have had heterosexual sex <br>I wonder how the /u/ folks will react.<br><br>Then again, they could always dodge that bullet by saying that Sonoko is just from the same clan and not a direct descendant of Wakaba.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sonoko is just from the same clan <br>This could be possible, seeing as how Wakaba is a girl and girls usually take the man's family name.<br><br>Then again this could be a case of Wakaba being so important that the husband takes her name. <br><br>Or maybe they had perfected IPS cells in that time and Wakaba became the man in her and Hinata's relationhip. It's nice to dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry.<br>ぶっちゃけていうと、園子のご先祖です！<br>To put it bluntly, she's Sonoko's ancestor!<br><br>The magazine explicitly states Sonoko is a direct descendant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who knows, maybe Hinata can invent iPS.<br>It isn't really important anyway, the story of these yuushas is only to help develop the main story 300 years after.</br></br>  <br>What if Wakaba was impregnated by Shinju-sama and gave birth to a little Sonoko Jesus?</br>  <br>I don't think that most people here will seriously care about Wakaba being a degenerate heterosexual other than Crack-kun and t/u/mblr. At worst it'll just inspire some shitposting.</br>  <br>She seems like the kind of character who'll lose her love interest towards the end and go full edgemaster in the epilogue, heading the Taisha in a utilitarian manner and marrying for the good of humanity's future rather than herself.</br>  <br> Each time I stand here, I renew my vow. <br> I swear to take back the world stolen from us. <br> We as heroes are the weapons to achieve that goal. </br></br></br>  <br>Hinata spoke with relief in her face, as if a weight had been taken off of her shoulders.<br>The people who had followed Wakaba and Hinata didn't look like they could believe it, but they still sat down as if they had lost their strength.<br>"How... did you know this place was safe?"<br>Wakaba asked Hinata.<br>Hinata tilted her head a little to the side as if in thought as she answered.<br>"Hmm... a hunch, I guess."<br>"A-a hunch...?"<br>Wakaba smiled wryly. Hinata sounded a little too confident back there for just a hunch... but it was quite like Hinata to do something like that.<br>"But it's not like we can stay here forever, can we?" <br>"Right..."<br>Such a cramped place could only serve as temporary shelter.<br>"It's okay. I know a safe route from here, too."<br>"Another hunch, huh?"<br>"Yes."<br>Hinata nodded with a smile. Her unwavering tone of voice sounded mysteriously trustworthy to Wakaba. Perhaps Hinata had been endowed with some sort of power in the same way Wakaba had been endowed with the power to fight.<br>Wakaba looked at her sword-- if something were to happen, she had the power to fight.<br><br>After a short break, Wakaba and Hinata left the honden with the refugees. They proceeded under Hinata's guidance and for some reason they came across next to none of the white monsters, and when they did, Wakaba was able to eliminate them.<br>The group headed southeast. They walked for days and days. And yet the sun never rose during all that time. It was as if the entire world was suffering from a nightmare from which it could not awaken.<br>Wakaba saw every building was in ruins. The town was half submerged in water. Countless corpses that had likely been eaten by those monsters. A gigantic fire blazed endlessly beyond the horizon. Darkness and grotesque white shapes covered the sky, filling the atmosphere with the stench of death.<br>Wakaba was understood--</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So either Hinata or Yuna or Chikage are kill. <br><br>With the way things are being described it sounds like everyone's clamoring to be Wakaba's lesbian best friend, although it looks like Hinata has a head start. <br><br>Also Chikage is gonna betray the group at some point, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With all those dead i wonder if they forced Takahiro to write good ending for anime.</br>  <br> It was Ueno who wanted a harsher ending, I think that Takahiro was planning a Good End from the beginning. <br><br>Then again, it was also supposed to be more of a battle bishoujo series rather than magical girl, so who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Clearly Hinata.<br><br>I'm predicting her and one other dead or missing, Yuuna gets called back by Tougou's voice, others survive.<br><br><br>It was always supposed to be a happy ending.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was the very initial draft. By the time it was in its current incarnation, everyone knew it had to have a good end.</br>  <br> With the way things are being described it sounds like everyone's clamoring to be Wakaba's lesbian best friend <br><br>We don't know anything about Takashima besides her name. It seems that Wakaba and Hinata are like Sumi and Sonoko and that Chikage is very attached to Takashima but only that.</br></br></br>  Wonder if there are any chances for this and wasuyu to be turned into ovas.  <br>But NoWaYu is not written by Takahiro, he's only in charge of planning.</br>  <br>I can see WaSuYu getting an OVA or a movie. It think it might happen after we get an S2 announcement though.<br><br>NoWaYu is setting up to be super dark, I dunno if they would risk turning that into a movie.</br></br></br>  How often will new chapters come out? Monthly?  Feels good to not have a dead YuYuYu thread.<br><br><br>If this is what you are talking about I'm pretty sure this is the most up to date one.<br>http://pastebin.com/2wEJvDjv<br><br><br>Thanks, I love the pdfs.<br><br><br>Thank you so much for all these translations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is reminding me of reading Deverry books.

On the other side was the homeland, Shikoku. The Great Bridge that connected Honshu and Shikoku remained intact in all its original majesty, as if to guide the people across.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Three years later-- Nogi Wakaba was now a second year in middle school.<br>"Wah-kah-bah- chan~"<br>Wakaba snapped back to once she heard a voice from behind her.<br>When she turned around, she heard the sound of a camera shutter.<br>It was Uesato Hinata smiling with a smartphone at the ready.<br>"Got a picture... of a beautiful girl holding a sword while gazing at the ocean. One more for the treasured Wakaba-chan image collection."<br>"Hi-na-tah....!"<br>Wakaba reached for Hinata's smartphone, but Hinata nimbly pocketed it before she could grab it.<br>"Heh heh heh. Now you can't reach for it, can you?"<br>Hinata spoke triumphantly.<br>(Khh... One day I'll delete Hinata's incomprehensible image collection for sure.)<br>Wakaba and Hinata's relationship still hasn't changed. The two of them are best of friends.<br>Suddenly, Hinata put on a serious expression and turned to the sea.<br>"You came here again today, huh."<br>"... Yeah."<br>Three years ago on that day.<br>The bizarrely-shaped white monsters they saw that day-- which later came to be called "Vertexes"-- appeared all over the world and trampled humanity.<br>Apparently, an extremely limited number of regions-- such as parts of Nagano and Shikoku-- were able to escape the invasion. However, other areas no longer belonged to mankind, but could now be said to be under the control of the Vertexes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess they must end up losing all of the other Japanese regions, but I wonder if this means there could be some other safe spots there weren't aware of that could have made a barrier.</br>  A reminder that there's a google spreadsheet with a few translations of the Vita game's events.<br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/14U73IGc__bpIgEIRBP5SZYXQHUCoO6<wbr>fnZ9knwlTXenM/edit?pli=1#gid=0</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Apparently, an extremely limited number of regions-- such as parts of Nagano and Shikoku-- were able to escape the invasion. <br>Oh boy, the Yggdrasil hype is revived</br></br>  <br>So is Hinata basically Tomoyo?</br>  <br>Yggdrasil hype ?</br>  <br>Year 1 = 2024AD<br>Year 301 = 2324AD<br><br>but the point still stands,<br><br><br> Nagano <br><br>So, what's there to keep the gods away?

Still died in the first episode though. <br><br>I love Gin and Kanade but I'd have to agree with them being about the same significance, and not actually main characters. Gin dies halfway through an LN that's whole point was to set up the plot of YuYuYu and can hardly stand on it's own without it.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't dismiss Nowayu and Wasuyu as supplementary materials like that.

They're equally important.</br>  <br><br><br>More to the point, they need some way of shaking the fights and emotional issues up now that Sange isn't a thing and Vertex fights are old news after twelve episodes beating them up already.</br></br></br>  <br> Thanks Anon, that was as harsh &amp; bloody like I imagined it to be and that was just one chapter.</br>  <br>They're really not. On its own, WaSuYu really wouldn't work at all. It's a setup for the main story.</br>  <br> Muv Luv Yuuna </br>  <br> Nogi Wakaba was now a second year in middle school. <br>The world basically ends and Wakaba saves one of the final remnants of humanity, and she still has to go to school?</br></br>  <br>Just make the new recruit descendent or reincarnation of the old heroes then and they're good to go. <br><br><br>Dying and permant cripple would be a thing now. Vertices can aslo evolve.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Past Yuunas always in the same spot in all photos </br>  <br>And Yuyuyu on its own doesn't work either with that kind of ED and how shoehorn Sonoko looks like.</br>  <br>In Takahiro's own words<br><br> By the way, in this project (NoWaYu) we had the "Yuuki Yuuna" staff gather and check the contents like we do in script readings for the anime. This really is the third official project of the series, okay? </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt just saying they've become more threatening giant monsters would be very convincing. They need a new angle.</br>  <br>She will probably have to quit being a hero in high school before the exams too. Can't do those silly things like saving the world if you want to be a working member of society.</br>  <br>She only saved the people that walked all the way to Shikoku with her. I imagine inside the Shikoku barrier most people survived unscathed. The group Wakaba brought in is probably overwhelmingly small compared to the whole population left in Shikoku.</br>  <br>Sonoko already talked about "seeds" in Sonoko's After.<br><br>They will go outside to plant more Shinju</br></br></br>  <br>How about the gods actually going into battle this time?</br>  <br>Does anyone here read Kase-San?</br>  <br>Wakaba is the protagonist, at the end of the story she will most likely create Taisha and leave school</br>  <br> Vertices can aslo evolve. <br>When you think about it, they already hinted that in WaSuYu. Not surprising considering how they like to put thousands of little hints here and there.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean they have the same weight. WaSuYu simply doesn't work as a complete story.<br><br><br>Seems like a good opportunity to find out more about the world.</br></br></br></br>  <br>12 episodes of hardcore yuri action with Yuuna and Tougou.</br>  <br>None of them work as a complete story, all of them are parts of the same story.</br>  I want to fuck Wakaba  <br>Hinata pls.</br>  <br>It won't sell</br>  <br>How many Wakaba panty shots does Hinata have on her phone?</br>  <br>YuYuYu definitely does. It builds off WaSuYu, which is unsurprising since the whole purpose was to provide background and setup, and has bonuses for those who've read it, like a better understanding of the Tougou reveal, but all of its narrative and flow is nicely self-contained. We've no idea about NoWaYu yet.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1552<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1539:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1551 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting Sylphy lifting Salama’s dress so its bottom is at her ribs, lustfully licking her navel as saliva dribbles down Salama’s cheek in ecstasy.<br> The cycle must be completed. </br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please.
