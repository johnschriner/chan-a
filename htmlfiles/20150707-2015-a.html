[ Non Non Biyori; best slice of life anime ever?<br>https://<span>youtu.be/Y-JUFg2gAIw  [ ]</br>  What is this expression trying to convey?<br><br><br>You're just stupid. I knew almost immediately because they weren't in Okinawa and Hotarun didn't show up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him but I didn't realize Hotarun wasn't there</br></br>  <br>Source is a blog that gets posted here. And quite often mind you. You should know that.</br>  <br> because they weren't in Okinawa <br><br>The OVA didn't really make it feel like they were ever going to show them physically there.</br></br></br>  <br><br> the non nons go to okinawa <br> they get raped by american soldiers </br></br></br>  One of these panda thread things.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/830320/ebeba4<wbr>019b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830318/21b816<wbr>0774/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/829271/23b902<wbr>3b9e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830245/603201<wbr>2c28/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/s/93897c7769/70<wbr>8523-192<br> 新鋭デビュー <br>This is his debut.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>That's a demon turning a shota into a slave though.</br>  <br>Its by San Se Fang</br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  Does anyone know the name of an h-manga about a couple in high school where the girl pretends to have big breasts but they're actually small and all the sex with her boyfriend ends up giving her actual big breasts?  Iconic anime scenes  <br><br>This is probably bait but<br><br> Gundam <br> Fucking Evangelion <br> Fist of the North Star <br> hipster <br><br>How low is your powerlevel you sad faggot<br><br>If you haven't seen at least two of those you shouldn't be posting on /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not "never knows best" <br>come on faggot</br></br>  "Iconic" does not mean "your favorite scene from an anime you like", you dolts.    <br> gundam <br>already explained, people dont ever even have watched it they just say that they did so they feel superior for watching old anime no one watches a shitty 100 episode toy commercial and claim they like it<br> evangelion <br>another hipstershit, people ahve watched it a lot but they dont get the plot and say they do to feel smart its a shitty fucking show<br> fist of north star <br>another one no one has seen but they say they did because "hurr its not bug eyed moeshit"<br><br>my powerlevel is much higher than yours you /v/ kiddo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anon, can you just be human?  <br>I imagined Linda as a slim asian girl with pale skin and raven black hair slightly longer than military regulation.</br>   Objective: Survive <br>I know Halo Reach gets shit on a lot by people, but that ending was damn great.<br>The last Bungie Halo game ending where the first began was nice.</br></br>  <br>Same here anon. Sucks we wont ever get to see Kurt animated. Heres to hoping we get some sort of movie or series based off Ghost of Onyx. Kurt is based as fuck. Most bad ass Spartan of them all.</br>  <br>Linda was always described as a Red head anon, although she shouldn't have that man face.</br>  <br>Its the opposite for me. Sure, they're finally in a game, but half the game won't even be about them, it'll be about Locke's squad that no one gives a shit about except for Buck. And knowing 343 they could very well end up killing some or all of blue team by the end of it.<br><br>I'd seriously consider getting an xbone for blue team, but not for THIS.</br></br></br>  Goodbye and good riddance to this Gaiden, it really soured toward the end. Hey, it's just like the original series!<br><br>It seems like the latest arc in Black Clover is ending. I'm going to give the series a few more chapters to get entertaining otherwise I'll be knocking it off the list until it does.<br><br>There's still no new series in the English magazine. I don't know if there WILL be at this point. If there is, I hope it's Straighten Up!, because apparently it's doing well right now and should probably last a decent while  Maybe it'll take another month or so for a new series to enter Viz Jump. I remember when Black Clover entered they did like two weeks of multiple chapter releases to catch up.<br><br>If you read Blue Exorcist/Ao no Exorcist, here is a DDL of chapter 69: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/NtuB5<wbr>1C5/file.html<br>I don't know why you read this, but I won't judge you. To me, it looks pretty dull!<br><br>Boku no Hero Academia <br>Shokugeki no Soma <br>World Trigger </br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well in reality Naruto also being really should be older than the other rookies.</br>  <br>Nah, that scene was when Sarada was 3 or 4.</br>  <br>He was clearly the same age in all his flashbacks, he probably just took the exams when he wasn't ready and failed. Kakashi graduated at like, six or something.</br>  <br>That got retconned too, otherwise he wouldn't have ended up with teammates around his same age.</br>  <br>Fuck, why is this timeline such a fucking pretzel?</br>  Who's the better wife?  <br> ultimate waifu <br> bad when she became an actual waifu and mother <br>Anime fans.<br><br>Truth.</br></br></br></br></br>  Chichi had 3 outfits ever.<br>4 if you count dragonball super.<br>She also had 1 hairdo ever.<br><br>Bulma had a new hairdo and outfit liie every five minutes, she more down to earth but still stinkin rich and intelligent while chichi is the dumb hillbilly daughter of fatman mc beardface.<br><br>Bulma all the way<br> dat blue hair hnnnnghffff </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   post Sneeze launch.  <br>B ianca </br>  <br>Bulma, chichi is a dumb bitch.</br>  Was thinking of picking it up based on this pic.  <br>YOKKORA<br>O<br>K<br>K<br>O<br>R<br>A</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear is #1</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127718327 <br>Works everywhere. The girl with the panties on her face can say whatever she wants for 3 minutes a day.</br>   Go to doctor <br> Can't use anatomical words <br><br>Also, how isn't there a mass of teen pregnancy? Studies show that areas that lack health education end having lots of unwanted pregnancies. Actually, considering Japan is going extinct, they're just digging a faster grave with this policy.</br></br></br>  I thought it was just going to be a show about meaningless fanservice and boring dick jokes, but it was actually pretty funny. They have a good boke and tsukommi routine going on so far. Picked up.  Seems like subs are out now. So how did you like it when you could understand it, /a/?<br><br>Also it seems many people say it was badly animated. I guess watching raw without knowing what happens gives you more time to analyze the animation.</br></br>  There's been subs for a couple days now, people say it's animated badly because it's animated badly.  Translation of prologue soon  <br> Is your self-esteem so low that you need approval from other people and a shitposting-free environment to talk about things? <br>The discussion had the "approval" of everyone except for one shitposter who went on an all-out lying, shitposting, character assassination campaign who didn't hesitate to shitpost live threads into the ground. It's hard to talk about birthday presents when outnumbered in posts five-to-one claiming that Frenda is basically Hitler. Might as well try to discuss politics on Stormfront without being shouted down.</br></br>  <br>No, he needs the actual Rensa body to revive any of the 13 remaining Rensas. He'd need 13 Rensa bodies to revive them all.<br> &gt;Kamijou sighed and said, “This one is #028 and this one is #029. Apparently they’re still alive even like this. …Up to #40 were stored in Yakumi Hisako’s lab. They were all forced to operate that cyborg and they were left on standby when not in use. When not placed inside the mechanical cerebrum and cerebellum prepared inside Rensa, they cannot even think.” <br> &gt;The possibility for a flawless victory had never been there. <br> &gt;That was what #029 had told him from within Rensa. If enough cyborg bodies identical to Rensa were created, they could be given a certain sort of freedom. But that could not happen. The meaning behind Rensa was so great that even an amateur high school boy like Kamijou understood it. <br> &gt;There was no way to save them. <br> &gt;At the very least, there was no way in the current social system of Academy City. <br> &gt;Kuroyoru Umidori stared at the finger-sized brains and asked Kamijou a question. <br> &gt;“What are you going to do with them?” <br> &gt;“I gathered all of them up to #40, so for now I’m going to have them put in cold storage. I don’t like it, but all I can do is buy them time until some real method of saving them is found. I can only hope that a method of allowing them to walk around like normal people will be completed with the next generation of technology.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touma literally ran up the school building wall from the third floor and succeeded <br>What</br></br>  <br>Heaven Canceler doesn't have a cyborg sitting around. He could probably wire her up to a tank that would allow her to talk but he's still a doctor who works in a hospital, not an engineer.<br><br>You could vaporize Touma's jaw and everything south of it and he could probably regenerate it with magical dragon energy, he doesn't count.</br></br></br>  I WANT TO ARCHIVES! JUST END IT ALREADY!!11 I CAN TAKE IT ANYMORE!   has ability that can grant him the easiest life possible <br> still bothers with a fucking highschool <br>So this guy is like a retard version of Rerouch?</br></br>  <br>You can get people to piss their pants.<br><br>Then giggle at their distress.</br></br></br>  <br>I see you didn't go to previous threads. It was worse than here, people keep complaining <br> M-MUH NON MORALFAG MC! <br>It was terrible.</br></br></br>  <br> has ability that can grant him the easiest life possible <br> use it to skip the easiest part of life <br><br>That seems a little counterproductive to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually wish there were more justice warriors, but not your usual "i'm good guy with good intentions and a moralfag who saves people in the name of justice!" but pure justice in a way like Piso's justice.</br>   really interesting premise <br> fun main character <br> suddenly a bunch of superpowered retards appear <br> JOIN US SO WE CAN DO GENERIC SHONEN SHIT <br>Goddamnit, this is why we can't have nice things.</br></br></br></br>  Do something about it    I already claimed her last season though.

Carla was a Reiss.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pointy ears <br>I doubt that's genetic and simply just because of the serum.</br></br>   You live your entire life as a criminal in a desert.  <br> The only companionship you have a talking cat.  <br> One day, desperate for something of worth in your dirt-ridden existence, you try to rob a teenage girl, a pig, and a small boy.  <br> The small boy kicks your teeth out after seeing a girl makes you bashful and embarrassed, and peeping a titty makes you pass out. <br> When confronted with the possibility of having any wish granted by a magical dragon, your wish would be "I don't want to drop spaghetti while looking at a lady" <br> You then spend days creeping on these folks, watching for a way to achieve this lofty goal, you are forced to hit a little girl (one of your few [only?] victories) and then hit on her. <br> Eventually you are captured and saved only when the little kid turns into a giant monkey. &gt;The pig does more than you to save the day. <br> But it's okay, right? You finally got a girlfriend. &gt;Well, kind of. You don't really see each other that often. <br> You decide to show the world your stuff and enter into the Tenkaichi Budokai, the greatest martial arts tournament of all time.  <br> You are immediately eliminated in the quarter finals by an old man nobody's heard of before. &gt;You embarrass and humiliate yourself by insisting that it's a different old man in disguise before being proven a fool. <br> The next time you hear from Goku, he's taking on terrorist Nazis or some crazy shit.  <br> So you gear up to raid the Hydra base and... you're not needed at all.  <br> You get a sinking feeling in your heart, like this won't be getting old soon. <br> You help Goku fight the fortune teller's fighters.  <br> An invisible man beats you up and you barely win when your girlfriend's boobs are gawked at by an old man. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127703594#p127703594">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't want to defile his best friend, will just have to use Oolong instead.</br>  <br><br>Is it still considered beastiality if puar became an adorable cat-girl?</br></br>  <br>Considering Yamcha can both fly and use ki attacks, while Mr. Satan can't...<br><br>Yeah I'm in agreement.
