[ The Namek/Frieza Saga was the worst because it took itself FAR too seriously despite how goofy the concept was, and dragged slower than jury duty<br><br>The Cell Saga was better because of the faster pacing, but it still suffered from trying too hard to create unironic drama<br><br>Buu Arc was perfect because it was closer to Dragonball's inherently silly roots and didn't give as much of a shit. about being 100% serious all of the time. <br><br>Toriyama's best work is when he's either intentionally going for humor or just plain stops giving a shit about his work<br><br>Taking Dragonball seriously is stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unpopular? I thought it was a commonly agreed with fact that DB did everything from pacing to adventurous, charming story better, while DBZ was utter garbage.</br>  <br><br>Buu was a shit villain.<br><br><br><br> dbz <br> utter garbage <br><br>maybe not</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Welcome to /a/, OP.<br><br>In the future do not make threads without lurking.</br></br>  <br>I think DBZ is fucking shit.<br>unpopular enough for you?</br></br>  <br> maybe not <br>How? All of it is so poorly paced and formulaic it even makes Naruto look like a masterpiece.<br><br> a new evil awakens <br> don't worry gang, we can take him down, right? <br> oh no, he's much too powerful <br> quick, goku/gohan, fuck off to some place for 90 episodes and train/become stronger through some deus ex machina while we feebly try to save time by fighting this dude who will totally wreck us <br> 90 episodes later <br> I'm here, and I will put an end to you <br> cue another 90 episodes of constipation and screaming </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Danmachi was one of the best, if not the best anime last season.  <br><br> watching the anime </br></br>  <br>Not to mention the fights are utter shit too. At least DB had some animation going on. DBZ is just 40% powering up, 40% one fighter being a smug cunt bragging about how powerful he is to the other and 20% boring as fuck energy ball attacks, that is if that 20% of the fight timeslot isn't wasted charging up an attack instead.</br>  anime &gt; manga  <br>I said DB*Z*<br>Obviously the conversation was about the anime, you illiterate mongoloid.<br><br>Does the manga fix the shitty formulaic stories by the way? As in were the storylines in the anime anime-unique and completely different from the manga?<br><br>Thanks a rhetorical question.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think the longest fight in Dragonball lasted two, maybe three episodes.<br><br>The Buu Saga after Buu was awakened was one long, nearly never-ending fight. Never mind that entire shitshow that was Goku vs Frieza.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Buu was fun. A super-powered retard who turns people into candy is horrifying</br></br>  <br><br>I like it because it's good at being bad.</br></br>  <br>Namek only took itself far too seriously at the end when they started fighting Frieza. Cell was the arc that took itself way too seriously<br><br> Goku has a disease <br> no one uses the dragon balls to cure him <br> The Androids aren't funny or quirky in anyway <br> Cell doesn't bring any humor  <br> Trunks is all depressed and serious <br> Gohan focused (and I like Gohan a lot) <br><br>Buu arc was fun, but at that point, everyone was too powerful and it truly felt at that point that Toriyama was just milking the story.<br><br> Goten/Trunks hyped to be the heroes <br> then Gohan <br> Nah Goku is going to save the day...again. This time with the spirit bomb that's NEVER worked. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You like it because nostalgia.</br>  <br>If I remember right the Piccolo Jr. fight in the tournament took quite a few episodes, but even then there was always something new and interesting going on in the fight and didn't manage to lose charm. The fuck happened between that and Frieza?</br>  <br> The Buu Saga after Buu was awakened was one long, nearly never-ending fight. </br>  <br><br>Correct.<br><br>The kid in me unironically likes it because kids have terrible taste. <br><br>Present me likes it just for how absurd it is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the Androids were really funny</br>  <br>Cell was pretty funny too at times.</br>  <br><br>I think TFS handles the Androids the best as dry snark machines</br></br>  <br> Goku has a disease <br> no one uses the dragon balls to cure him <br><br>Because everyone assumed Goku took his medicine. Which he didn't do. And by the time people found out Goku was fucked up, getting the dragonballs was impossible in the timeframe because Piccolo fused with Kami.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Toei happened.</br></br>  <br>Still goes back to my point that the Cell saga was the least humorous saga of all of DB. It took itself way too seriously in areas that no other dragon ball saga did. To me, Cell/Android is the low point of the series. <br><br><br>In the manga they're a lot better--at least 17 and 18, but in the anime, they're pretty unfunny</br></br></br></br>  I fall asleep to most SoLs  Unpopular opinion? <br>This is bait opinion.</br>  <br>Pretty much this.<br><br>Also the Frieza saga was totally my favorite.</br></br></br>  <br> implying everything on 4chan isn't bait <br><br>faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>  <br><br>What's the difference?</br></br>  <br>I guess they caught up with the manga a bit too quickly and deciding that a shitton of Bulma filler would have been great.<br><br>Which it probably would have if not for one glaring issue. Namek is a fucking wasteland with nothing and nobody particularly interested.</br></br></br>  Broly was the best villain the series has ever seen, and was forced to job for no fucking reason.<br><br>Cell is the second best villain, and the cell games/great saiyaman arcs were the most enjoyable.<br><br>I'm getting a little tired of NTR.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no reason <br><br>The movie was already over.</br></br></br>  <br><br> nearly never-ending <br><br> What is English and how to use it? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gunbuster sucks<br>Lain sucks</br></br>  <br>The World is the best Jojo stand. Dio is best villain, then Kira, then Valentine (if he counts).</br>  CHICHI A FUCKING SHIT<br>WORST WIFE<br>WORST MOTHER</br></br>  goku vs freiza pre super saiyan is my favorite fight before he got overwhelmed  The Frieza saga had some of the most ridiculous characters in the whole series, the Ginyu Force  Index &gt; Railgun   no one mentions Saiyan saga   <br>he said unpopular opinios anon</br>  <br><br>Flavor of the month stuff is more enjoyable then most cult classics. FotM has actual production values and a certain tightness to it that is achieved through a solid budget and experience level by the studio. A lot of the old stuff that gets picked up as classic is just nostalgiafagging, like how Akira is just the first 1 1/2- 2 volumes smashed together with shitty voice acting.</br></br>  <br><br>Sometimes I forget that so much shit actually happened in the Saiyan arc but all that really sticks out is Goku vs Vegeta<br><br>And pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're pretty dumb</br>  <br><br>Well that's wrong. My vocal chords work, I know how to talk.</br></br>   DBZ should have ended with Cell <br> Buu was the worst villain in the show <br> Super Saiyan 12 year old's is retarded <br> Most characters at this point are completely useless (only Goku and Vegeta are relevant, maybe Gohan sometimes) <br> Goten ruined the show beyond repair <br> Fusion was pretty cool though </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DBZ itself is complete garbage and the only redeemable thing to come from it was the TFS series.</br>  <br>I remember Piccolo saving Gohan's life at the cost of his own.</br>  <br>Those are popular opinions, anon.</br>  <br>This</br>  The Ladies vs. Butlers OVA(s) made me regret acknowledging the series in the first place.  Kill la Kill was mediocre.  <br>can I just ask if there's a clip of this scene online or which ep?</br>  <br>Athens&gt;Rome<br>Deal with it scrub</br></br>  <br>That's a very muscular schoolgirl.</br>  Fanservice/moe/loli/harem anime are shit and I'm genuinely creeped out by people who actively watch those genres.  Hunter x Hunter is meh. Extremely overrated.  <br>Season 2 never.<br><br>Good.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't mind spoilers?</br>  <br>The biggest reasons Akira is a classic is the animation, which still holds up fantastically, and the fact that it was the first major steps toward anime having a presence in the west. Everyone knows that it condenses the manga for the worse, and everyone knows the dub is either delightfully cheesy or godawful (depending on how old you were when you first saw it).<br><br>Furthermore, a "classic" work is often such because of how it contributes to the medium/genre, moreso than entertainment value. Fotm works are often made with the intent to entertain moreso than to evolve the medium/genre, so it makes sense that they would be more enjoyable.</br></br></br>  SSJ4 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Super Sayain God<br><br>Design and lore wise, I prefer SSJ4.</br></br>  <br>Toei did Dragon Ball as well though.</br>  I still think Guts will somehow end up forgiving Griffith for what he's done    shitty meme manga  <br> meme <br><br>Name one from berserk</br></br></br>  <br/>  I'm just glad that Miura is taking a break from idolmaster again.  <br>still on the boat...</br>  <br> boat <br> man bag <br> le rage face </br></br></br>  I don't know what's funnier. The moron who misused the words shitty and meme because he wants to fit in or the moron who still blames The Idolmaster for Kentaro Miura's lazyness because he wants to fit in.  <br><br>Not in a thousand aeons</br></br>  <br><br>everytime I read this new chapter I feel this fear creeping up on me. I don't know why and I don't know how but only when reading Berserk this fear comes to me.<br><br> tfw Iwata, Robin Williams and Christopher Lee died before reading the new chapter of Berserk <br> tfw I may die before finishing Berserk <br> tfw I may not finish Berserk and HxH in my lifetime <br><br>Maybe my children will finish them but I'm afraid that I'd die and wonder how will it end?<br><br>;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way I see it it's going to go 2 ways.<br><br><br>1. Griffith/The other God Hands sacrifice Falconia<br><br>2. Guts becomes the bad guy by fighting Griffith and thus not allowing the people to have their "paradise"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm still in disbelief at the fact that a chapter came out.  <br><br><br>/a/ never change</br></br></br>  <br>But the question is, will you forgive the magaka for dragging out a series for so long?</br>  <br>Casca a shit</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up you stupid namefag</br>  <br><br>Hell I can forgive Miura for "dragging" out Berserk since the art is nice and the story is rich. And you have the author of Hajime no Ippo after 1000+ chapter Ippo is still a punching bag that uses his head literally to block punches and be the champion. Ippo should just die already and have the manga focus on Sendoh instead</br></br>  <br>I just saw the source yesterday. I'm still mad.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus the Berserk threads have been awful lately.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be more worried about Miura dying before he finishes Berserk.

What exactly does this sentence translate to?<br><br>"大学の近くに何がありますか。”<br><br>What do you have at Chikaku University...?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not "Chikaku" University. 近く is a word, not a name. Try looking it up.</br>    <br>Woops. I got it now. Thanks.</br>  <br> intermediate listening hell <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Be very aware that they should not be your only source of studying. I found that the 読解 book is actually a little bit easier than the real N2 test. Complete them and then try to move on to Kaiten Master if you can.</br>  <br>You can hear stuff if it's spoken at non-native speed and with known vocabulary but can't hear anything else without rewinding and looking up words, I presume.</br>  <br>You could almost watch stuff raw, but there's always going to be a few spots per episode where you just can't catch what's said and need to check with subs or replay several times until you get it and it ruins the immersion.<br><br>So basically, normal intermediate hell except with stuff you can't 聞き取る rather than words you don't know.</br></br></br>  <br> Kaiten Master <br>Kanzen Master?</br></br>  <br>Yea that, I've never used it on my own but one of the students in my volunteer class brings in his book. With the teacher there helping us I can understand it, but as a study guide on my own its still a little too advanced</br>  <br><br> tfw never had this or didn't notice it <br>Starting studying after already watching anime raw might have something to do with it</br></br></br>  <br>why dont you just ignore the line you dont get?</br>  <br>Why would you do that? That's like just skipping over vocabulary words when you're reading at an intermediate level. Sure you could still understand most of it, but I don't know how I would improve if I don't try to find out what the hard to hear line was, and then play it a few times until it sounds natural to me.<br><br><br>Well yeah, I started learning japanese when the only anime I had seen was rozen maiden and I watched it with the sound off because I didn't have headphones.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because it ruins the immersion?</br>  <br>Not knowing what was said ruins the immersion too.</br>  <br>do you think kids pause a tv show and rewind several times until they understand a word they missed? no. they don't, they just take it and are immersed anyways</br>  <br>No it actually teaches you a good skill to have if you ever actually have a conversation with a Japanese person, becoming good at guessing the meaning. The worst thing is having a conversation come to a halt because you don't understand a word or two. Normal people will just try to end the conversation politely and your friends will just be annoyed</br>  <br>I thought we had all accepted by now that learning languages like kids do isn't very smart.<br><br><br>Yeah so I might as well actually try to improve my listening comprehension when I'm alone watching anime and won't bother anyone by relistening 10 times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you said that it ruins the immersion, but kids do it all the fucking time while still being immersed</br>  <br>Kids are kids, they are used to not understanding shit, because they have to filter shit out every time adults are talking.</br>  <br>go filter it out then you retard. you were a kid, so you did it once before</br>   ～みたい <br> ～らしい <br> ～っぽい <br><br>The meanings all the same to me.

So please, kill yourself now and do us all a favor.</br>  <br>Suggesting a beginner not worry about learning the nuanced differences between みたい、らしい、っぽい、until they can understand a video on youtube is either stupidity or advertising. <br><br>The concepts are explained well enough for people in English.

With your arbitrary reasoning they may as well not study grammar at all and just grok everything till things start to stick. <br>No, because I am not advocating against learning them at all. There is a big difference though, in learning something well enough to understand it when reading, and in learning it well enough to use it properly in production. Aiming for the latter as a beginner is a waste, because you're likely to fuck up anyway because of lack of experience, and even if you get it right you'll be fucking everything else up.<br><br>And either way, DOJG just doesn't answer the question, so you just blindly suggesting it for everything is not helpful at all.<br><br><br>Watch the nihongonomori video, then look at DOJG again and show me where it explains the difference like that.

The Empire ended up mistaken Japan's desire for peace as a sign that the JSDF has major weaknesses. Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital. Thus most assumed Japan is bluffing.</br></br>  <br>Well all it takes is just taking some high ranking people to show what Japan is like to convince them they're strong but desire peace. And they did exactly that.</br>  <br>That's actually really funny.</br>  <br> Because they don't understand why an army with such advantages don't just sack the Capital <br> tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br> WE'RE OBVIOUSLY WINNING GUYS. LET'S GO IN FOR THE KILL. </br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tens of thousands of troops die in completely one-sided battles, with absolutely nothing to show for it <br>The point is the Capital is unharmed. It makes no sense, to them, that an invincible army would AVOID conflict. So the conclusion is that the JSDF has some unknown weakness and that is why they want a peace treaty so badly.</br></br>  <br>Just to elaborate, in the ancient world you sign peace treaties if you are exhausted and don't see any chance of defeating your foe. You don't start talking peace unless you worry about not being able to win. The Romans simply suffered from cultural clash and misunderstood what the JSDF was doing.</br>  I've been wondering, how do they power lights in the capital? A generator out the back would create too much noise and constantly shipping in charged batteries would take a lot of effort.  <br>If it's not generators, powerline directly from the base ?</br>  <br>Is my absurd attraction to Kuri soley based on the fact that she sort of resembles Lili from DanMachi even though Kuri's already a better character?</br>  <br>Solar panels are a thing together with car batteries.</br>  <br><br>Just imagine how GATE would've played out if the Gate opened up in Showa-era Japan (Pre-WWII).

There'd be a fuck-ton of raping, pillaging, torturing, executing, etc. Shit'd be brutal. <br>Err... That's normal for the Empire, so nothing they don't already do.</br></br>  <br> Imperial Japan conquers a whole fucking world and enjoys untold amounts of resources and is ultimately able to conquer most of Asia, as the US would never be attacked due to them being able to find an untapped oil reserve in the not-Rome. </br>  <br>I mean the Japanese would rape and murder everyone they come across.

They're not legit today, they're a ridiculous extravagance at the expense of taxpayer money that the JSDF didn't even need to fend off some 200k+ troops anyway. But lets just build the motherfucker anyway to show dem stupid Americans that forts shouldn't be made out of trailers and crates - even though the JSDF could be ordered to abandon the base and RTB at any time.</br></br>  How mad are you that Tomato-kun gets the fuck Booze every night while you can only jerk off to her doujins?  <br> brain-damaged <br><br>Hate to defend Chibi Usa but SMC and the manga both go into further detail as to why Chibi Usa behaves the way she does despite being 900 years old.

They wouldn't even need the tanks and heavy artillery to fend off another assault now.</br></br>  <br>I still believe, that modern medicine can help Rori to get more womanly forms to tease Itami, with the help of hormone therapy.<br>Meanwhile they would get huge benefits from doing research on her immortal body.<br>Just one hint from Kurokawa.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? She's fine the way she is. Although I won't deny the benefits of research.</br>  <br>Fortifications also serve to project power and impress the local yokels. The message is<br> we built this impressive shit, so don't rise up in revolt </br></br>  <br><br> literally mutating immortal DFC loli </br></br>  If you were Itami, would you have continued posing as Tuka's father knowing that she'd be open to an incestuous relationship?  <br>Why the stupid Americans? They can't see it.</br>  <br>What do you mean? <br><br>She wasn't open to an incestuous relationship ever.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Assuming they don't trip over or get stuck on the hundreds of dragon corpses littered around the hill.</br></br>  <br>The gypsy natives are already stripping the dragons. Corpses won't last long as warnings.</br>  <br>She climbed into Itami's bed naked and wasn't exactly disgusted when she asked if he was having a lover's tiff with her.<br><br>Seems like she wouldn't have a problem having her father inside of her.</br></br></br>  Don't mind me, just posting the page where Rory won through her insurance policy.  <br>Nah.

We don't know how gods fuck.</br></br>  <br>I think he's getting confused how Hardy want's to marry Rori.</br>  <br>She wants to marry Rory</br>  <br>hate to tell you anon, but wanting to marry does not equal wanting to fuck. Plus she's already ascended.</br>  <br><br>For all we know she just wants to "own" Rory, and marriage is the closest/easiest way to have a god as your property.</br></br>  <br>as believable as any other story we got right now.</br>  <br> reddit held a contest and mushoku tensei won <br>Gate was #2 though.<br>Which says something when you consider that every other series that was in the top 10 were at least partially translated to some reasonable degree, or has regular translations ongoing.<br><br>Yeah, the poll results annoy me.<br>So anyone think someone will pick up the novel? or maybe even the Light novel?<br>Yen Press seems to be in the habit of picking up anything that looks pretty, and has a good following?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you're confused as to the point I'm trying to get across.<br><br>Hardy wants to marry Rory, so I'm simply implying that she retained her ability to feel human emotions, I guess until the specifics of why Hardy wants to marry Rory are explained, this could be the best reason</br></br></br>  <br>  http://ak-scans.wikia.com/wiki/Nove<wbr>l_Translation</wbr> <br>muh /b/ grade grammer<br>Might it be intentional ?</br></br></br>  <br>of all the companies you had to mention, YP is your choice?<br>YP don't even translate that fast. it's like 1 volume per year. <br>they put a C&amp;D on web trans even if they don't got one book out yet. they're the devil.<br> mushoku tensei won <br>fucking reddit MT ain't even that good.<br>i enjoyed it and was here when it was translated.<br>didn't last the whole way but read the whole thing.<br>but it don't deserve to get its LN translated someone legit is gonna pick it up anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yen Press seems to be in the habit of picking up anything that looks pretty, and has a good following? <br>And then just like most companies, they just sit on the copyrights and don't do shit with them except mail out C&amp;D letters.</br></br>  <br> YP is your choice? <br>Simply because of how they seem to be picking up the most in the last year or two.<br><br> YP don't even translate that fast. it's like 1 volume per year. <br>3 per year. Which is slow, yeah.<br><br> they put a C&amp;D on web trans even if they don't got one book out yet. they're the devil. <br>Really? For what series?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They haven't been doing that though. Their releases are slow, sure, but they've actually be putting out releases.<br>Unless there's a case I'm not aware of?</br></br>  <br>When volunteers can put out content faster than paid translators, something is wrong.<br> inb4 they have a lot of projects to do <br>Well maybe they should finish those projects first before they fucking buy up more licenses.</br></br></br>  <br>Gizelle says that she likes men more (but Hadry is fine too).<br>So she compares fucking men VS similar intercourse with Hardy. This implies she has lesbian sex with Hardy somehow.</br></br>   you will never cuddle with a christmas cake military waifu with huge breasts, and is built like a brick shithouse.  <br><br>Why does it hurt to live?</br></br>  <br> something is wrong <br>Yeah, I'm guessing they want to pad out release dates. They can clearly output more; SAO translator translates for all SAO material, including the manga and spin-off novel, which means instead of 3 books a year, SAO get 6 books, and 3 or so manga volumes a year.<br><br>One theory I've read is that it's to give more "breathing room" between release, for the fans that don't really have much money (teenagers) to be spending on a bunch of books so often.<br>If that's the case, I think they're padding too much; every other month should be sufficient, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where is the christmas cake? All I see is an 18 year old idol.</br>  <br> Really? For what series? <br>Haruhi<br>Spice and Wolf<br>Hataraku (before it even started too)<br>Durarara<br><br>least pirates can do now is offer scattered translations here and there since YP is shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You meant "the most", not "the least" right?</br>  <br> On the other hand, it made a peace treaty 100% harder. <br>So? An insurgency and symmetrical warfare would've been a worst bitch to deal with later.<br><br><br>She's in her early 20s at most. Unless you're trying to perpetuate that stupid chapter 35 meme.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh yeah i meant the most</br>  Cutie pie.  <br> I'm guessing they want to pad out release dates. <br>This is alright if the padding between release dates weren't so absurdly long.</br></br>  <br>How would symmetrical warfare be worse for the JSDF?</br>  <br>Typo</br>  <br>asymmetrical</br>  <br>Cutest potato.</br>  <br>It's shit, for the record.</br>  <br>SHE ANSWERS QUESTIONS FROM OLD MEN FOR MONEY</br>  <br>Kuri is 24 hardly a christmas cake</br>  <br>You know that was a gigantic dick move from Rory.<br><br>She basically forced her way into the dragon expedition and then says it comes with a price. What price is that? Well she just takes Itami's soul without bothering to get his approval.</br></br></br>  Damn. Just one chapter into the manga and it's obvious the anime totally butchered the adaptation. So many character defining scenes were cut...  <br>But she's 35</br>  Kuribiyashi a cute. Very cute I tell you.  <br>She looks like a shota.</br>  <br>Did you upload the wrong image? That looks nothing like Kuribiyashi.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't you guys know anything about LED luminaries? They make LED that fit the T8 florescent tube nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking electric stoves and coffee makers</br>  <br>  2015 <br>  you don't know about fuel cell electricity generators working on methanol or LPG without any moving parts <br>how you even got to 4chan</br></br></br>  <br>100% Kuribayashi. Cute.</br>  <br>I thought she was supposed to have a small frame.</br>  <br>You don't need to be an engineer to shitpost.</br>  <br> dick move <br> making sure that her and itami will be together forever, even after she transcends to godhood and he outlives his mortal life <br><br>Definitely a dick move putting an insurance policy in place on the one you love</br></br></br></br>  <br>But this is common knowledge. You better get out your basement and check if your mom has already installed one in the kitchen to save on the bills and sell surplus electricity because you got ain't no job.</br>  <br>Kurokawa a cute in the anime<br><br>A CUTE</br></br></br>  <br>That 35 you are talking about is the number of a chapter not her age</br>  <br>Actually, Rori is best girl, because absorbing damage while Itami dicked around the dragon kinda hurted a lot</br>  <br>She please herself with comfort women</br>  <br>Yes anon<br><br>I said Rory was best girl a few posts above<br><br>She tanks for Itami<br><br>Makes sure that Itami will be hers after death<br><br>Wants to spend her last 4 decades before godhood with him<br><br>Who can beat her</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to mention, that Itami can now drink any amount of liquor with her without giving a shit about hangover and health, while listening cool stories of her exploits in Emroy's service.</br>  <br> heavy as fuck <br> flammable <br>Not that anon but the solar panel thing was more plausible. Lighter and safer imo.</br></br></br>  <br>Funny enough, this is actually canonically false. <br>Tuka was in an actively lesbian sexual relationship with her cousin (who was eaten by that dragon)<br><br>I suppose incest is may not be as taboo for elven culture due to their extremely low birthrate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>when itami gives her the dick she'll relinquish pussy forever don't worry boys</br>  <br><br>And people said she wasn't a slut.</br></br>  <br>So they used elven transformation magic to grow dicks?<br><br>What a slut. Only used twice my ass.</br></br></br>  <br>Who wore the pants in that relationship? Her or the cousin?</br>   write a harem <br> Lelei is the only virgin <br><br>that's not how you write a harem story goddamit</br></br></br>  Where are they going to stop story-wise?  <br>Probably after they kill the fire dragon.</br>  <br>Her past relationships aren't really touched upon in detail, so who knows. <br>I would assume Tuka though.<br> <br>She did grow up around a super playboy father, and when she found her father fucking around she wasn't surprised. <br>Dude currently has like 5 wives, 8 lovers, and countless other non-steady pussies</br></br> </br></br></br>  Mortars are love. Mortars are life. <br><br>Just putting this out there.</br></br>  <br>Now I have fuel to burn when people say it's some generic harem</br>  <br>This isn't a harem story you retard.</br>  <br> Chuka <br>more like<br> CYKA </br></br></br>  <br><br>Princess Pina is likely virgin too, although her "I can only handle 50 men at once" statement is fishy.</br></br>  <br>I KNEW IT<br><br>ELVES WERE RUSSIANS ALL ALONG<br><br>BLONDE, WHITE, AND SLUTTY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you kidding? At this rate they'll have tons of new material.</br>  <br>I'm sure she can handle 100<br><br>And I'm supposed to believe that these women haven't broken their hymens in training yet?</br></br></br>  <br>How is it not a fucking harem? He has like 4-5 women lusting after him.</br>  <br><br>Which is fucking hilarious, because that's all on the Empire's head. They're dead wrong about why Japan wants a peace treaty with them, and do the thing that ensures either A( they are as humiliated as possible, and/or B( there's no Empire by the end of this whole thing.</br></br>  <br>But Chuka never tasted a dick, she is a virgin!</br>  <br>3 at most.</br>  <br>Harem usually has the "negative" connotation of SoL ecchi hijinks with a beta MC.<br><br>But if what you mean by harem is that the MC has a number of girls chasing after him then yes it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Five. Officially five. <br><br>The five girls even get their own gaiden books. </br></br></br>  <br>remember pina's pubic hair will never be animated</br>  <br>Wasn't Rory going to town with the agents manga only?</br>  <br>You mean Delilah's.</br>  <br>RODS<br>OF<br>STEEL</br></br></br>  <br>But russian faggots abandoned it in favor of metro</br>  <br>Probably because there's hasn't been a recent Stalker game.</br>  <br> shitting on metro <br>Get out.</br></br>  You know Rory loves sucking dick.  <br>Nice try gook, but China's claims are twice as absurd and the rationale for them is analogous to a britbong pulling out a map of 13th century Europe in order to prove to France that they have a right to own Calais and Bordeaux</br>  <br>first metro was great but second was meh</br>  <br>No he means Pina's.</br>  <br>I want to take a bath with Lelei.</br>  Where's muh OHOWOWOWOWOWOWOWO <br>OP Single? Where's muh cozy ED Single?</br>  <br>You think the second OP will be as good as the first.</br>  <br>Also here's Delilah's bush while I'm at it.</br>  <br>what a try hard.</br>  <br>Yanagida's injury was totally worth it.</br>  <br>bunch of impotent japs. <br><br>Shitty manga harem mcs too. <br><br>Fuck it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> would touch fluffy tail </br>  <br>That motherfucker got the best deal ever, he got a small cut and in return got one of the hottest women in the whole manga, hell I'd be willing to give an arm or a lefg if it meant I got someone like Delilah.</br>  Why does she seem like a rapist or stealth marriage types?  <br>let's face it Delilah would kill us all from sheer exhaustion</br>  <br>It would totally be worth it though.</br>  <br>Not to mention, that Delilah has sworn in loyalty to death and is actually useful besides hot sex.</br>  <br>Then she would breed multiple cute bunny daughterus.<br>Damn, I'm jellly</br></br>  <br> Then she would breed multiple cute bunny daughterus. <br>Amusing that instead of making the bunnies sing-gender, the author decided to just make male bunnies rare. And this justifies the complete lack of family structure, making it normal for the bunnies to breed with other races and yet with no expectations of having a family.</br></br>  <br>male bunnies are rare cause most of them die of exhaustion obviously</br>  <br>She's just a dirty whore enabler.</br>  <br>Because she isn't a pure girl like someone thinks here.<br>In the whole 3rd recon or between the girls Itami knows she is the most malicious and probably the most lewd one</br></br>  <br>how is every monster girl is best girl</br>  <br>She's pretty skilled if you think about it I mean <br> she's a skilled fighter since she was a warrior bunny <br> probably can do most housework since she was one of clan Formal's battle maids <br> was able to become the head waitress in just half a year <br> can do assassinations/espionage if needed </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it can't be helped</br>  <br><br>Yes, but they aren't going up against a modern enemy at all. The design of the fort is perfect for enveloping fire to ensure every single angle is more deadly than it would have been before while also providing one hell of a demonstration of "Where is your god now" knee jerk reaction from any local who saw it.<br><br>War isn't about fighting the enemy as much as destroying the enemies resolve to fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>enlightened.. or rather a pervert<br><br>God bless him</br></br></br>  <br>He was a nice man.</br>  <br>Tyuwaru is too cute for be a whore.</br>  <br>It really can't.</br>  <br>Tyuwaru and Sherry are probably cutiest girls in the manga so far.</br>  <br>Aurea and Mohmu are pretty cute too, especially Aurea</br>  <br><br>I wish he would've survived, I really wanted to see interactions between him, Itami and Kurata.<br><br><br><br>Aurea is definitely up there with Sherry in my book.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really, REALLY want to fuck anime Rory.</br>  <br>Science must do something about that.</br>  <br>I wish, unfortunately neither SJW's nor religious nuts would ever allow such research to take off.</br>  not using radio-isotope fuel cells<br><br>fits on a flatbed truck.. bury it, can power a city for 25 years</br></br>  <br>Sad.</br>  <br>Great way to jinx whole gateworld:<br>let in nips with fissile materials.</br></br>  <br><br> <br>Next time we see her, she's going to be in worse state than Noriko. Gangraped and beaten to near death</br> <br><br>My dick is going to be rock hard while my face is going to be red with rage, I won't know what to do</br></br></br></br>  <br>radioactives might fuel Hardy's powers or something</br>  <br>What? I thought the JSDF ended up taking all the prostitutes back with them to the Alnus community.</br>  <br> with her boyfriend corpse next to her, died trying to protect her. Nips saved her just in time. <br>The JSDF gives her an home and a job out of the streets though</br></br>  <br>no, people have to moves on their own to Arnus town.<br>The JSDF can only pick up refugees</br></br>  <br>Nah only member even entertained the thought and then figured they'd just end up whoring themselves BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE IDYLLIC ALNUS LIVING COMMUNITY ONLY CATERS TO MONSTER RACES AS WHORES. She had a serious derp moment there.</br>  <br>No, she stayed behind with her boyfriend. <br>When Zorzal started his bloody uprising many demihumans in the capital fled, including Tuwar and her boyfriend. <br>Prince's men caught up with them at a village<br> murdered her boyfriend while they raped and beat her. JSDF found her barely alive next to her boyfriend's corpse </br></br></br></br>  <br> BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THE IDYLLIC ALNUS LIVING COMMUNITY ONLY CATERS TO MONSTER RACES AS WHORES. She had a serious derp moment there. <br>You missed the point. The girl said outright that she doesn't have the skills to learn a trade so she choose prostitution. Moving her to another town isn't going to make her change her career.</br></br>  Zorzal also tells his own sister (Pina) to be his fuckwhore at one point, much to Pina and Diabo's horror. <br><br>The guy's dick is out of control.</br></br>  Does anyone else get their time to shine besides Itami and Kuribayashi?  I wonder how Lelei and Rori would react on Stargate movie and series <br>and Tuka on The Lord of The Rings.</br>  <br><br>That's pretty fucked up, now I hate that faggot Zorzal even more.</br></br>  <br>She could had worked as a nurse for Kuro clinic</br>  <br>Or as a waitress, or help in removing dragonscales.</br>  <br>I hope they cut his dick and balls off and made him swallow them before they killed him.</br>  <br> Zorzal also tells his own sister (Pina) to be his fuckwhore at one point, much to Pina and Diabo's horror. <br>sounds like a lovely chap</br></br>  <br> Bunny sex slave kills him. <br> Zorzal had the time to moral injurying her but nothing of value was lost, she was a an evil cunt like him and actively tried to fuck up relationships between Japan and the Empire. </br></br>  <br>Kengun and Sugawara. <br><br>Kengun disobays direct orders by the government to retreat, and goes in to save the Rose Knights. Vifeeta develops a huge crush.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't I remember this. I even read up to the latest chapter yesterday.</br>  <br>It's from the LN which is way ahead of the manga.</br>  <br>Oh.<br><br> tfw you will never princess carry a cute tomboy female knight <br><br>Might as well kill myself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Sugawara<br> <br>Sugawara the diplomat, goes fuck all to diplomacy you can't have my wife to the inquisitors who came for Sherry's head. <br>This is the catalyst to begin the final full conflict between Zorzal Empire and JSDF.</br></br> <br><br>Failed as a diplomat, but succeeded in growing a pair and spine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Or as a waitress, or help in removing dragonscales. <br>And once she did that, why would she not want to get extra money on the side by walking the streets at night? It is fine to give her better prospects, but if she wants to sell her body it is still her right. The difficulty with Japan of course is that prostitution is still technically illegal there.</br></br>  <br>Technically by that time, the dragon corpses have already been cleaned up and there hasn't been any attacks on the base, so no more dragon scales, it's full blown PX trade center now.</br>  <br>The thing is she doesn't want to work as a prostitute she and the others do it because they have no other way of feeding themselves as they have no special skills that can help them get a job, they even outright state that in order to do their work they have to be high or they wouldn't be able to take it.</br>  <br>All because cute sage knew that you need invest to save capital.</br>  The Cobra will be retired in your lifetime. ;_;  It's out http://manga.redhawkscans.com/reade<wbr>r/read/the_seven_deadly_sins/en/0/1<wbr>34/page/2</wbr></wbr>  Awww yiss  Meliodas is at fault in this situation as well but it's certain that he has something that seriously prevents him from just telling everything to everyone.<br>King is a huge fucking hypocrite though.

I'm getting the feeling she's Taihei's genetic litter sister, and Umaru is a step-sister or something. Loft girl also knew the constellations Taihei was teaching.  <br>wait.. the manga has a plot??</br>  <br>More like she is Umaru twin sister that got separated early when their mother divorced.</br>  <br>Vaguely, I suppose. In a tiny thought bubble, Taihei thinks "Didn't I teach you these before?", and a couple of chapters later, we just see a girl naming constellations. Pretty sure it's the same girl Alex visits in the latest chapter.</br>  <br>Yes, is the one that won that award, I just hope the author don't pull out some shitty plot or drama like in yandere kanojo</br>  <br>me on the left</br>  <br> SHE HATES IT. </br>  <br> Umaru confirmed to be non blood-related sister <br><br>Manga suddenly become "How to raise a spoiled wife-to-be"</br></br></br>  <br> Umaru confirmed to be non blood-related sister <br><br>As long as they don't pull an Usagi Drop it's okay</br></br></br>  <br>Well, Umaru is hinted to have feelings for her oniichan in that business trip chapter.<br><br> Usagi Drop <br>That's remind me there is a Vietnamese novel that was translated into Japanese (called Tsubura na Hitomi iirc) that has the same theme: unrelated father raising a child, when the girl grows up she falls in love with her father.  Except that that story was depressing at fuck, he raised the child of his childhood crush who was fucked (and ran) by some random city playboy, and he didn't return the feeling of his daughter in the end. Fucking depressing </br></br></br></br>  Delusion Kanau is nice, too.  Post more sylphy. She is going to be the best girl after the next episode  <br> Umaru is hinted to have feelings for her oniichan in that business trip chapter. <br><br>Oh god, No!!!!</br></br></br>  <br> I wonder why I followed my oniichan to a different city just for 1 day <br><br>My heart went doki doki</br></br></br>  <br>It was so obvious.</br>  <br>Why is she so beta? She needs to learn from Anna and rape Taihei in his apartment.</br>  <br>True that. Or use some business excuse to go on a full week business trip with Taihei alone. It will work out in the end.</br>  <br>Ehhhhtooo<br>NO.<br><br>Taihei will mary Manager-san</br></br></br></br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA</br>  <br> HAHAHAHA <br><br>What is so funny ?</br></br></br>  <br>Kanau will never ever win.<br><br>She's had like 7 pages of screentime the whole manga.</br></br></br>   Kirie has seen Umaru naked and doesn't even realize it <br>why are she and bomber so retarded, bros?<br><br><br>I think she's going to become a character that's at least as important as the brothers are, if you believe SnacksLoli is going to be a part of things</br></br></br></br>  Why is there so much hate toward the series in general? i dont understand i think its genuinely good.  <br>This is just /a/ being tsundere as usual.<br>They will go 'nope, it's shit' and watch it every week.</br></br>  <br><br>It's a  meme </br></br>  <br>It seems like most series I enjoy become meme shows now.</br>  <br/>  <br>what do you mean? there like 10+ thread about this show every day.

Maybe she will be the one who  reveal that Umaru is just a non blood related sister. </br>  <br>fuck that shit</br>   +w+!   <br>I do prefer Kanau end, though. 10 years is a very long time span, she deserves it.</br>  <br>(´＋ω＋`)　シュバフィーンッ</br>  <br>  シ <br>fucking reddit</br></br>  <br>Having a giggle?</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>Rich girl is the best. At least they always smell nice. Ebina is a glutton so I bet she smell like oil, and Umaru may have cavity from drinking too much cola.</br>  How many duel between TSF and UMR there is in the next episode?  <br><br>Why is Sylphy so best</br></br>  <br>I hope the fifth episode is about Taihei and his work crew. Really want to see his manager.</br>  <br>what a stunning display of logic and deductive reasoning.</br>  <br>She probably thinks she's already lost her chance at approaching him since they've known each other for so long. It's pretty heavily implied that they lost touch with her after graduation, while bomber and taihei kept being friends.</br>  <br> It's pretty heavily implied that they lost touch with her after graduation <br>Nothing a little rape on her part can't fix.</br></br>  Sylphin's soccer chapter animated in the next episode?  <br>Honestly, I just want to see her skid in on the soccer balls.</br>  She's got those crazy eyes.    <br><br>Honestly, she looks like Umaru with brown hair. (is she her long lost sister?)</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure there were hints at Hikari-whomever being related to Taihei, with the interest in constellations.</br>  Next episode when?  <br>From the apartment building where she lives, she probably used to be a childhood friend with Umaru and oni-chan in their neighborhood, but somehow they forget about her while that girl is the only one who remember.</br>  No incest, No yuri, No homo so this anime can be AOTS  <br>This being Himouto, I doubt there will be any drama involved.

Pretty much everything and everyone revolves around her.<br><br>Though to be fair, Dogakobo is currently shuffling things around to introduce the other girls and is skipping over Umaru's development, so animeonlyfags only know the worst parts of her character so far with only a little bit of her being cute with Taihei.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm assuming they're making her awful early on so that over the course of the series you'll see her growth and it'll be a much more stark contrast as time goes on</br>  Kanau &gt; Ebina &gt; Kyrie &gt; Sylphie &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br>Sylphie&gt;&gt;&gt; aLLL</br>  <br>Yeah I'm worried about that. I'll be so pissed off if this new girl moves in with Umaru &amp; Taihei, or if it turns out that Umaru &amp; Taihei aren't blood related or some stupid shit like that.<br><br>I don't mind Umaru having a step sister, so long as she doesn't invade and change the relationship between Umaru &amp; Taihei somehow.</br></br></br>  Great name, great title.  I'd chest her if you know what I mean.    Is nashetania retarded or something?    <br>That MILF tits</br>  <br>She is merely pretending.</br>  <br>Adlet a shit also weakest hero.<br><br> Bunny is the 7th <br><br> Adlet also the 8th cause he was brainwashed <br><br> Hans is best boy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So are they stuck on namek temple for few more eps figuring out who's the traitor before actually proceeding with their quest?  why does our mc call himself the strongest when he seems to have no abilities whatsoever  <br>Yeah probably 2 episodes this whole arc is the rest of the 1st LN</br>  <br>You mean that he's not a saint of whatever or something? Saints are chick exclusive.</br>  <br>He doesn't need special ability to be the strongest.</br>  <br>He is the weakest in terms of the saints abilities  cause he has non whatsoever <br>, but he is actully extremely intelligent or at least smarter than all the other 5 4  combined.<br><br> He stopped the other 5 heros from killing each other which was about to happen cause they're retarded </br></br></br></br>  But I liked the 1st ED.   new ED <br> it's about Bunny <br> title is "Dance in the Fake" <br>Not to mention it sounded cray cray like Nadeko's Mousou Express.<br>There's foreshadowing, hinting, and there's this.<br>Is there any reason to believe that she isn't the 7th? Could Bunnyfags defend this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's cute, and most cute anime girls aren't traitors.</br>  <br> Everyone was spoiled that she was the 7th as soon as there was a thread for the first episode. Bunny's and everyone else's bullshit goes way past that. </br>  <br> title is "Dance in the Fake" <br>the fuck how obvious do they wanna make it</br></br>  <br>But Flamy is cuter.</br>  <br>All this time I've been laughing at Chester, but didn't notice the double joke. Or even triple.</br>  <br>I completely agree, but Bunny is still pretty cute in her own right.</br>  <br>dude whats her deal<br>she won't explain anything and is a bitch<br>if it wasn't for the weird ass mc she would be dead right now<br>what is her fucking deal?</br></br></br></br>  <br>abandonment and muh trust issue</br>  <br>If it wasn't Adlet she wouldn't even meet the others.</br>  <br>her goal is the demonlord<br>she would have to cross over eventually<br>sooner or later she would run into the other 6 and get killed wildly outnumbered</br></br></br>  <br>Bunny isn't the 7th. That was Adlet. Bunny is just someone pretending but isn't related to the Majin.<br><br>Adlet's the real bad guy.</br></br></br>  <br> Because that's Adlet.<br><br>She's a fake hero too, though.</br></br> </br>  <br>She looks like shit. Every other girl looks better.</br>  <br>At first i think it's QUALITY.<br>But now i think it just anime staff don't like bunny.</br></br>  What idiot thought 30 seconds of spinning at 5 fps was a good fucking idea.  Also some of the most god awful, jarring 3d ive ever seen  I think she's not daijoubu.  <br>Probably had the same director as webm related.</br>  Ending kind of pandered to Gondolf/Bunny.  Her hairstyle looks as if she tried to pluck her hair.   mfw all QUALITY this episode <br>Might as well wait for the BDs, judging by Rail Wars the animation won't get better</br>  <br>This physically hurts my eyes.</br>   Episodes: 12  <br>What are they even trying to achieve with this?</br>  <br>Only volume 1</br>  <br>You mean vol 2. Vol 1 is about to end.</br>  <br>There still are 3+epilogue chapter of vol.1 left, for now anime just ended 38% of vol.1</br>  <br>My eyes</br>  I was starting to have some respect for Adlet but he's starting to annoy me with his MUH FLAMIE SHE A GOOD GIRL, also it's funny that's she's called Flamie because she's always starting shit.<br>At least he's still the only character that isn't completely retarded.</br>    <br> Flamie <br>Where the hell did this come from?</br></br>  <br><br>But she's a good girl</br></br>  <br>He's reasoning was that she's a brave willing to kill the demon lord and that she was choose. <br><br>Doesn't matter anyways because everyone is a fucking retard is about kill each other.</br></br></br>  <br>You gonna love the fact that he's brainwashed into loving that bitch.</br>  <br>The first episodes had all the names written properly. Why did they feel the need to change now.</br>  <br>http://rokka-anime.us/character/fla<wbr>mie+/<br>because the official names are out</br></wbr></br>  <br> Saint of Pond </br>  <br>Hans a annoying fag.</br>  <br>Swamp is just too uncute</br>  <br>Is that English site more official than the LN? </br>  <br>He's deluded.

Whoever's subbing this should kill himself.</br>  <br>Aren't LN character images edited by the translator?</br>  <br>No, and the one I posted is volume 5.</br>  <br>Yeah I hated that. I liked the TDKR reference though.</br>  <br>They should totally do it faster.</br>  <br>36 YEARS OLD</br>  <br>Whoever's made the official english site should kill himself.</br>  <br>Actually the author changed the names on the official anime site.</br>  <br>Author should kill himself.</br>  <br>Isn't she 26 or so? 29 maybe?</br>  <br>Source, your ass?</br>  <br>Its like World Trigger all over again.</br>  <br>I just try to only look at the backgrounds and ignore anything that moves.</br>    <br>Delicious Saint. I'd climb her mountains. Shame they got her eye alignment messed up on her intro.</br>  <br>Not sure if real,  She's the one who killed THE STRONGEST MAN's family and the love spell from that Kyoma is undone, THE STRONGEST MAN will probably sink the ship.{/spoiler] </br>   I'm the strongest man in the world <br><br>shut up!!!!!!!!!!!!!</br></br>  <br>Rabbitrayal.</br>  <br>Why is that boy wearing such clothes</br>  <br>Sometimes you just need a little self-reassurance.  Dumb frogposter </br>  <br>I have trabbles believing this bullshit.<br>Fortunately, it's a matter of time before I get to volume 5.</br></br>  <br> boy </br>  <br>Could Adlet defeat Dio and his World?</br>  Friendly reminder: <br><br>Aztec batman really is the STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD.</br></br>    <br> Aztec batman <br>Doesn't this mean Adlet is technically a spic?</br></br>  <br>That doesn't speak an once of spanish.<br>He is "native american".</br></br>  <br>Only if the Spaniards raped them and had a child.  They didn't. They wiped them off the face if the earth. </br>  <br>he's not even close to strongest<br><br>maybe, post yfw pillar men show up</br></br></br>  <br> implying you need a curse to love best girl </br>  <br>You would when your halfbreed qt gf slaughtered your family.</br>  <br>NO, what the fuck is this atrocity?</br>  <br>And still so fine, her husband is a lucky bastard.</br>  <br>Still stronger than you.</br>  <br>Are you saying that the original is better?<br> muh tits  <br>That bra looks so silly</br></br></br>  <br>Where is her husbando anyway?</br>  <br>Keeping the temple running in her absence.</br>  <br>Being a househusband</br>  <br>living the dream</br>  <br>Their daughter is dying though.</br>  <br> being agile and smart useful in combat <br> tricksters never win any fights <br> only magic flashy powers count as strength! <br>yeah, fuck off</br></br></br></br>  <br> name that sounds like a a 14 year old chicks MMO username <br> no emotion <br> kill everyone and run, talking never <br> also pretty much shadow the hedgehog <br>bunny girl is pretty shit too, i will give you that</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> skinny and lanky body <br> awful haircut <br> ugly face <br> bitch personality </br></br></br></br>  <br>NYA-HA!</br>  <br>we trouble in terrorist town now</br>  <br>Free excuse to make more</br>  <br>Old habits die hard I guess.</br>  <br>Fuck him. Worst Brave.</br>  <br>That's shit. Stop that.</br>  <br>I think she's cute personally but I'm not sure that'll be the case after she starts using her saint powers.</br>  <br><br>This is still absolutely haram, make her fully covered in burka</br></br>  I like her the most!<br><br>Any Mora fans?</br></br>  <br>can I sniff her ass</br>  <br>He's gone back to revenge mode now, and thinking about killing Fremy.</br>  <br>source?  so I can avoid it </br>  <br>No, because he  actually has genuine feelings for Fremy and the thing about killing his sister is more mind manipulation shit. </br>  Did whoever designed her character not think this might look strange? Or is her right eye magical?  <br>I will believe 2ch and not you.</br>  <br>Of course it's magic. This is anime.</br>  <br>try watching more than 5 anime</br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he's referring to the fact that she's aiming down the gun with her blindfolded eye.</br>  <br><br>again, watch more anime</br></br>  <br>It's an obvious animation mistake, she should be aiming out of her other eye.</br>  <br>It's literally the demon eye.</br>  <br>But anon,  I am 2ch. </br>  <br>I watched nearly 200 series. I don't get your point. Unless you're just saying it's like that cos anime. In which case, fair enough.</br>  <br><br>Again, stop trying so fucking hard.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to Snake.</br>  <br><br>It's fuckin obvious her eye has powers are you guys this stupid?</br></br>  <br><br>I am gonna assume you are saying that her right eye is indeed magical, not merely trolling. In which case you could've just said so.</br></br>  <br>Well he did ask if it was magical or something. So instead of just answering the question you just went full retard. Round of applause to you sir.</br>  <br> never mentioned directly <br> never alluded to <br>For all we know this could have been QUALITY or negligence on the studio's part. Your suggestion that its "obvious" is naive. The typical "it's magic, i ain't gotta explain shit" explanation is lazy and ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>Best girl and best mom.</br>  She removes the eyepatch when she fights.  <br> dat reddit response <br><br><br>It's not QUALITY if she does it every time</br></br></br></br>  <br>So it is anime QUALITY.</br>  gun girls are best.  <br> I watched nearly 200 series <br>You're a big guy.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad she doesn't wear retarded plateau boots like Chaika. Between the eyepatch and the boots, Chaika's outfit annoyed me more.</br>  <br>only fag wouldnt tap it/10</br>  <br>Nope, both manga and anime are same so it just that.</br>  <br>Well we know THE WORLDS STRONGEST MAN isn't a fag unlike Goldov.</br>    <br>Rokka no Detective</br>  Was she flailing about like a retard mime so she could "accidentally" break the tablet on the altar?  <br>We got master detective here</br>  <br>Of course, got to get rid of Dog and Rabbit's cum fluid evidences.</br>  <br> why does our mc call himself the strongest when he seems to have no abilities whatsoever <br><br>1) no. 1 dirty fighter in the world<br>2) no. 1 hardest to hit in the world<br>3) no. 1 best swordsman in the world<br>4) no. 1 best thrown weapons fighter in the world<br>5) no. 1 poison master in the world<br>6) no. 1 survivalist in the world<br><br>yeah, i'd say it would be pretty fucking hard to find someone tougher to kill in a fight, worse, his ninja ass would probably disable/kill your ass before you even knew the fight had started. <br><br>He might have zero wisdom, and be easy to con but he's still absurdly powerful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3) no. 1 best swordsman in the world <br> 4) no. 1 best thrown weapons fighter in the world <br>He literally gets destroyed in both categories by Hans in the first volume</br></br></br>  <br> no. 1 best swordsman in the world <br>No</br></br>  <br>This part was too obvious, they should have made it more subtle. I didn't really notice a thing when I read this part of LN,</br>  I'm sure if they all went to fight demons as 7, the first one to die would be the fake, since that person would be weaker than the others.  <br>You mean the first one to run away.<br><br> Because they weren't Brave. </br></br></br>  <br>I like that the LN stresses that the rest of the world sees him as a tricky, dirty fighter.</br>  <br>Also<br> no. 1 hardest to hit in the world <br>should be Hans, fucker dodged lightnings.</br></br></br>  <br>she was originally supposed to be the fake hero. Her job was to kill the braves, which she started to do. then she was betrayed and abandoned by the demonking. she wants to kill him, and she's super powerful, and she killed other good brave possibilities, so she was chosen as a legit option.<br><br>during this time she learned there was a legit traitor (she knew at the time she tried to kill Arlet). But being autistic, and knowing there was a 2nd plant from the demonking, she decided she wouldn't trust the other braves, and simply kill them all then kill the demon king herself. that's why she told him that the other braves would start to kill each other; because she knew they would once they learned that there was a traitor in their midst, furthermore she (correctly) assumes the real traitor will probably take advantage of the situation to fully destroy any possible trust or teamwork between the braves.<br><br>that was her plan till arlet broke through her trust barrier with his MC plotpowers; now she's simply too autistic and simply doesn't trust the other braves to speak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wants to bang Bunny <br><br>Nah the word is cuck. Not fag.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still confused on who activated the barrier?</br>  <br>And it was all a ruse from Tgurneu, literally everything about her.</br>  <br> Nashetania .</br>  <br> 36 YEARS OLD <br>which is why she's a fake brave as well. braves can't be older then mid 20's</br></br>  Iam the strongest man in the world.  <br> and dog too? But why? Why is she pretending to be a brave? </br>  <br>UUMEOWMEOWMOEWMEOW!!</br>  <br>she's a fake brave, they can't be much older then 20. <br><br>she killed (ate) her daughter who was chosen to be a brave and made a fake tattoo for herself.</br></br></br>  <br>So there is an explanation in the LN? Because that outburst seemed way too weird to me. The first thing that came to mind was that she was being possessed by the sword.</br>  <br>Is that supposed to make me like her less?</br>  <br>Because  she and Dozzu have different plans regarding the whole Majin thing. Also, the three Kyoma commanders made a deal where the first one to kill 3 heroes will take control of the whole Kyoma army. </br>  What others gadgets does Adlet have in his belt?  <br>Thread theme:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=G-B<wbr>OTFmimoA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>nothing is more manly than singlehandedly taking on guards like that<br><br>Thank you based Adlet-sama, you truly are The Strongest Man in the World™</br></br></br>  <br>not really at the start of the series, however <br><br><br>once Hans was killed he probably is.</br></br></br></br>  QUALITY issues aside, the soundtrack in this show is fucking great and does some nice heavy lifting dramatically.  <br>Goldof is still better than him. Adlet can't compare to them in a direct fight.</br>  <br> Is that supposed to make me like her less? <br>when she goes nuts and runs away, yeah i'd say so.</br></br>  <br> welp </br>    <br> Goldof is still better than him. Adlet can't compare to them in a direct fight. <br>no, in a one on one fight without bunny backing him up, Adlet would kill Goldof.<br><br>Adlet is a killer, Goldof is a warrior. there is a big difference when in a solo, one on one fight. Adlet would disable him with a trap/trick, and slit his throat. the only reason why it hasn't happened yet is because Adlet is an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goldof already beat him in volume 3.</br>  <br>Is he batman?</br>  <br>But Goldof is an unstoppable juggernaut when in muh hime mode.</br>  <br>Could someone explain to me how Flemy isn't terribly outclassed by Bunny? Her rifle seems to only hold one round at a time and it also takes her a bit of time to generate the new shell for the gun, so her loading speed isn't all that different from just a normal rifle. The only advantage I see here is that she can reload as many times as she likes and that her firepower is good, but bunny can cast at a moments notice and shoot many projectiles all at once, continuously.</br>  <br>Bomb spam.</br>  <br>Higher crit percentage.</br>  So wait, both bunny and adlet are fakes? Then there are only 5 braves?  <br>Based on how it's been moving so far, most of the season will be them stuck in the temple grounds.</br>  <br>6 braves.</br>  <br>Aldet is carrying her ak47</br>  <br>Bunny only has a certain number of simultaneous blades. She can either use them for defense or offense, but if she's forced into total defense, she might not be able to spare one to throw at Flemy, whom would be shooting consistently back at her, flanking and changing positions to go for the headshots.</br>  <br>If it's true that bunny and adlet are both fakes, and there are 7 people claiming to be braves, then that implies that there are only 5 real braves and the other is either missing, hasn't shown up yet, or has been killed. Assuming that they're both fakes, if they're not then which one is the real br ave?</br>  <br> Goldof already beat him in volume 3. <br>but Adlet wasn't fighting to kill him. this is a huge difference. Adlet hasn't' seriously tried to kill him yet.</br></br>  <br>6. Mora is a traitor too.</br>   STRONGEST MAN IN THE WORLD <br> loses to everyone 1v1 <br><br>EPIC</br></br></br>  <br> she sees your dick </br>  <br>He was, he knew Goldof was also seriously trying to kill him.</br>  <br>Who are the real braves then? <br>How come traitors can become braves?<br>What benefits does becoming a brave offer other than not getting instakilled by the miasma leaking from demon territory?</br></br></br>  <br> So wait, both bunny and adlet are fakes? Then there are only 5 braves? <br>no, this is a misreading or possibly due to bad translation. <br><br>Adlet is a real brave (brainwashed though he might be). It's the saint of mountains who is the 2nd fake. She killed her daughter who was chosen as a brave and carved the symbol into herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, oh man. Three traitors? <br><br><br>Seriously my head is full of fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So how is he brainwashed?</br>  <br>Only 2 heroes have fake crests.<br><br> One of them is Nashetania. The other one hasn't been revealed yet. </br></br></br>  <br> carved the symbol into herself. <br><br>Well this answers my question as to how the fake braves get the symbols. I thought maybe they were tattoos or something.</br></br></br>  <br> He was, he knew Goldof was also seriously trying to kill him. <br>knowing Goldof was trying to kill him doesn't mean he was trying to kill goldof. as i said, Adlet is absurdly strong, he's also an idiot. those two have a naruto - sasuke thing going on.</br></br>  <br>Look, I like SuzuKen and all, but he's fucking unstomachable in this.</br>  <br>Then shouldn't there be 8 heroes in that room last episode? Or is one of them missing/dead ?</br>  <br>Demon magic is how.</br>  <br>You really should stop believing every piece of inane shit you read here.</br>  <br>So you're just a retarded fanboy.</br>  <br>Roronia joins them after the barrier is lifted.</br>  <br>She only appears at the end of volume 1.</br>  <br>This is a -sama that really should be praised.</br>  <br> You're being rused, anon.   When a Brave wants to pass their crest onto someone, it simply moves to that person.   If I remember correctly, Nashatania's crest belonged to the Saint of Time, Hahayaha or something like that. </br>  <br> Roronia joins them after the barrier is lifted. <br><br> She only appears at the end of volume 1. <br><br>Then am I correct to assume that traitors can't become Braves and that they have to intentionally fake it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Starting to think that I should.</br></br></br>  <br>Added: way too much conflicting information. <br><br>I see no point in lying.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Nashetania's crest belonged to saint of time the previous generation flower. Adlet's crest came from saint of flower herself, she made a 7th.</br>  <br>So what's the actual deal with Mountains?</br>  <br>You can get the crest from another hero ().<br>You can also be a "traitor" without actually being the "seventh".</br></br>  <br> So how is he brainwashed? <br>he was brainwashed by a demon into loving Fremy, the plan was he would betray the braves for her. back then of course Fremy was killing the possible brave candidates, so this made plenty of sense. <br><br>basically Fremy and Adlet were set up to be another version of Bunny and Dog. only thing is Fremy decided to kill the demonking, so the plan went awry, also the love curse was broken. <br><br>I suspect in time we'll learn that Dog was cursed to love bunny as well, you see the condition to be chosen a brave is the following <br>1) around or under 20 yo<br>2) super good fighter<br>3) incredibly strong design to kill the demonking<br><br>Dog has just as much desire to kill the demon king as the others, else he wouldn't have been chosen as a brave. I suspect he's probably been cursed to loving bunny like Aldet was cursed to love Fremy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are quite large.</br>  <br> Adlet's crest came from saint of flower herself, she made a 7th. <br>Wait are you telling me that there can be 7 legitimate braves?<br><br><br>So a hero who doesn't know any better could pass his/her mark to a traitor?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He's got a gadget of his own  just for you. </br>  <br> Tgurneu took his daughter hostage. <br><br><br>Obvious bullshit, just in case someone falls for it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> his <br>her</br></br>  <br>The 7th is special crest with unknown function, saint of flower used Tgurneu to use Adlet so he can bring the crest to the demon god and pass it to her.</br>  <br>by her I mean the demon god.</br>  Is there any LN illustation of Sheniera?  So what I'm gathering is that everyone is a fucking traitor. Good to know.  <br>cant you all see that he is BATMAN, he just needs to lose a loved one to become complete</br>  <br>Why would the demon god want a crest, why would saint of flower use a demon to use someone else to do something for the majin?</br>  <br><br> I will also add that Hahayaha is a brave from at least 300 years back. The other braves disliked her since she was a rowdy drunk and a slut or something. She was doing whatever she thought was fun. Five days after beating the Majin thanks to slowing it and hasting the other braves, she left for the demon continent and stayed there until she died.  She wanted to drink with demons, since she thought it would be interesting. A certain three demons humor her, and they become friends  Saint of Time wanted the next six braves to lose, since she wanted to see what would happen. For fun. <br><br><br>Mora Chester?  Her daughter is being taken hostage by the demon responsible for killing Adlet's family and orchestrating Fremy's birth. If she can kill one Brave, her daughter survives.   At the very beginning of volume two, we learn she kills Hans Humpty. </br></br></br></br></br>  so all the braves are fucked up or been fucked up  <br>His sister died, so his prerequisites are complete.</br>  <br>That's the end of volume 6, wait for more. The demon god is related with the saint of flower somehow.</br>  <br>Every one is fucked up. They should all abandon this quest.</br>  <br>Wow, not only did I type hella slowly, I fucked up my spoiler.</br>  <br> volume 6 <br>You aren't even trying anymore</br></br>  <br>Volume six just came out.</br>  <br>You don't have to believe me, I don't care.</br>  So I'm assuming we're going to get an ED for each of the braves right?  <br>That's only like 2 days ago without any digital version available.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>We're going to get one for fremy.<br><br><br><br>Spoilers still exist. Hell if I know whether they are true though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's not limited to just her gun.</br>  <br>Good thing we live in such a comfortable era with Internet.</br>  <br>Did bookstore stop existing in the other parts of the world?</br>  <br><br>Question everything in these threads. At all times.</br></br>  <br>Are you telling me people would lie on the internet?</br>  <br>Don't you recognise Russel Crowe? It's Aronofsky's Noah</br>  <br>Somebody lied to me on 4chan once. Now I have a trauma.</br>  <br>Yes, Buster.</br>  <br/>  Will Adlet be killed off in a surprise anime original ending twist?  <br>This is a potential running gag in his seiyuu's career.</br>  <br>YES. Best girl has arrived.</br>  <br>They all look kawaii as fuck in the anime.<br>Just remember how ugly the cow girl is in the novel...</br></br>  <br>I hate to be that guy, but I didn't read the LNs.<br><br>Also if I'm looking for doujins, do I search Flamy or Fremie?</br></br></br>  <br> Implying there will be doujins </br>  <br> doujins <br> ever </br></br>  <br>   we learn she kills Hans Humpty. <br>Nice. I hate that guy already. I knew she'd be the best.</br></br>  What does bunny girl want anyway?  <br>Dog dicks</br>  <br><br>Well she can have that without killing everyone else right?</br></br>  <br>No she is just the traitor</br>  <br>Abandon the quest, and just search for treasure and start questionable business enterprises and money making schemes, like real heroes would do.</br>  So i guess next episode will be full of talking.  Why does she aim with her covered eye.  <br><br>she has compound eyes, like a fly.<br>the different angles allow for accurate shots with only one eye.<br> she's a transforming kyouma. </br></br></br></br>  <br>You will know why she is called "the saint of spewing".</br>  <br> streaming </br>  Nashetania is now "Nachetania"   Those retards implying the MC is the 7th (or 8th)   <br>No need to imply, he is.</br>  <br> 4 volumes translated <br> No mention of that <br><br> Would directly conflict with everything we know (Demon aid being in contact with the 7th for example) </br></br></br></br>  <br>Come on, anon. Fake spoilers are fun.</br>  <br>They had to fill in a, niche.</br>  <br><br>Keep being retarded, I'm sure you can make this a meme.</br></br>  When will we see Fremy smiling?  <br>when she finally gets a faceful of dick</br>  <br>Morafag here. For some reason her mountains seem less mountainous in the profile art, but I can live with it either way.</br>  <br>Maybe in a flashback. I don't think there's anywhere else.<br>Well, maybe there could be a bitter or mocking smile somewhere.</br></br>  <br>She was looking at the sword and got "irritated" with nothing working and smash the sword against the pedestal iirc</br>  <br>it looked pretty silly, but I think she's a childish control freak. Which actually makes sense since she's a princess</br>  <br>At one point in volume 2 Adlet got everyone to laugh or smile by being a retard. It said she turned away but hopefully the anime will show it.</br>    <br> ANIME </br>  <br> mfw this is accurate </br>  Does Adlet even have special powers, or can he just do alchemic stuff like potions and bombs?  <br>Kinda funny that my Skyrim looks better than this shit.</br>  <br>He's the strongest man in the world, he doesn't need special powers.</br>  Backgrounds        <br>For you.</br>          Overall a meh episode, 2nd and 3rd had much better backgrounds  Why do so few people like this?<br><br>It's AOTS by far</br></br>  <br>Adlet is like Batman.<br><br>As long as he prepped before hand he can beat anyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Has the board even had a strawpoll, or are you talking about the BD sales? It's in my top three atleast.</br>  <br>It's a one cour advertisement for the LN, m8.<br><br>And the novel gets boring pretty fast. It's the kind of series you can follow simply by reading summaries and spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>You aren't watching very many shows are you?</br>  If the studio didn't have much budget to start with does that mean that they don't need that many sales for season 2?  <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>There's probably zero chance of this getting another season considering how poorly it seems to be doing.</br>  <br>I guess we have very different interests</br>  <br>Pretty sad, was reading the LN back from vol.2 and really wanted to see some of this shit animated.</br>  <br>Best we cane hope for is that the anime brings some more interest to the LN.</br>    <br>Six with Rolonia who isn't introduced in the anime yet.</br>  <br> AOTS <br>Was, then this episode happened.</br></br>  <br>I was calling bullshit at that part.</br>  <br>It's very popular on  streaming sites  and the like, it's just that /a/ would rather talk about Ilya and stuff. I like Ilya, by the way</br>  I like the MC because he's a trickster. I like his fighting style.<br>Truly the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br> token loli <br> best anything <br>Not even any fanservice, and ugly clothing in general.</br></br></br>  Am I the only one who loves the OST and how they're using it?  <br> /a/ would rather talk about Ilya <br>/a/ certainly doesn't talk about Ilya. It had a movie which people was hyping up to be very lewd at the first shock moments, but then everyone realized a kiss scene is just kiss, it has been done, and the first episode was very underwhelming if fanservice, especially when Prison School, Shinometa and Okuu-sama is airing.</br></br>  <br>This pretty much sums up why too many seasons of the same fansarvice aren't always that great.</br>  <br>Isn't the Saint of One Flower  a living mummy in that Temple? </br>  <br>The thing about Adlet having the seventh crest sounds plausible, but the rest of the post you quoted seems like bs (or badly maybe just badly expressed).<br><br>I thought Adlet had (or was) the anti-crest Black Barren Flower thing at first.</br></br></br>  I've just finished vol 1<br>mfw</br>  <br>I'm finding it hard to get Adlet's version of that wallpaper. This is the best I've found and it's probably a shitty upscale because of the retarded extra pixels.</br>  <br>I'm glad he claims to be the strongest without having to be the stuest.</br>  <br><br>The Saint of Mountains is certainly Mountainous. <br><br><br><br> I'm assuming Adlet is the 7th and doesn't know it.  Consider:  He was the only one at the Altar, and someone activated the barrier. No one came out. He was the only one in there. What if we saw only his perception of things? We never actually his "person that he didn't see" on screen, we only have his word for that. The reality is he activated it to trap them all in there because he was conditioned to, or something. Perhaps he was just temporarily controlled by something? But my assumption that he is the extra suggests he's a fake from the core. <br><br> I also assume the Bunny girl is a fake, but a more obvious fake. Like she faked the Tattoo because she wanted to go off adventuring or some such. <br><br> If my assumptions are true then it will mean there are only five Braves trapped in the mist barrier currently. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I imagine there are worse places the Goddess could have places a mark you HAVE to show off to prove on an underage girl. There are worse places. Not many.</br>  <br> girl <br>Really?</br></br>  So how far into the novel is anime going to reach?  <br>Vol 1 with an original ending. Probably.</br>  <br> all saints are females <br> chamo is a boy </br></br>  <br>Looks like only vol 1</br>  <br>Adlet is gonna got shot in the heart by Fremy, while Sweallow in CD will die via impalement in the chest.<br>RIP in peace.</br></br>   12 eps <br> one volume <br>DAMM</br></br>  <br> not many <br>The fuck are you talking about? Hers in on a place that isn't even considered lewd at the slightest.</br></br>  <br>Mora is shit.</br>  <br>He comes back.</br>  <br> Adlet is gonna got shot in the heart by Fremy <br>Well that depends, did America exist at the time this show takes place?</br></br>  <br>Is this good?</br>  <br>your assume is all wrong   except for Madlet and Bunny are the 7th (first and second)  </br>  Well fuck you too.  <br>It's fantasy Mesoamerica, close enough.</br>  <br>Oh course it does.</br>  <br>Watch it and tell us.</br>  <br>There's not much to talk about. LN readers have spoilers on everything in the anime and far beyond it. So there's no real mystery to anyone who lurks the threads, and not much to discuss unless you move from animeonlyfag to LNfag, which many don't.<br><br>Well. There's the standard praising and shitting on characters or the anime's exeuction, at least. But that can only last so long between episodes.</br></br></br>   That spinning <br>Make it stop.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Still a pleasant a collection of views. Thanks for the caps, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The jumpiness of that spinning was painful. Haven't bothered checking a raw to compare. I remember reading that an Overlord episode had some butchered framerates that were fine in other raws.</br>  <br>Mfw vol 2<br>mfw finals are next week</br></br>  So since adlet is the 7th, is he actually a bad guy?  <br>He is the baddest man in the world.</br>    <br> an original ending <br>doubtful <br><br>It'll join the club of the long list of animes that'll never get another season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How are sales looking?</br>  <br>bad</br>  Why does roronia look like shit?  So why are people saying adellet is a fake brave when his seal works just like everyone else's? In vol 2 when Hans dies one of the petals on his flower seal faded away.  <br>Roronia is pure</br>  <br><br><br>Pussy ass motherfuckers.</br></br></br>  <br>It's on the official site, bruh</br>  Has vol 6 spoilers out yet  <br>One of them hasn't showed up yet.</br>  <br>the strongest is always evil</br>  Reading the novels, and holy shit goldof is a dumbass.   show seems great <br> look up the studio <br> its the same people who made rail wars <br> loved RW's first ep then dropped it when the next few had 0 budget <br> all the fucking QUALITY this ep <br><br>God fucking dammit, I knew this was going to happen. Still though, the show is damn good, but fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe he got brainwashed as well when he was a kid. No one could be that fanatic for a pussy.</br>  <br> not wanting to see Passione's latest trainwreck </br>  <br>  Could Bunnyfags defend this? <br> The bunny ears is a lie. Not a chance. </br></br>  <br>Goddamn Japanese people are stupid.</br>  <br>Was this supposed to be a danganronpa reference?</br>  <br><br>Have you seen bunny?</br></br>  <br>Why you didnt like the train wreck?</br>  <br>You are trying to make sense but it sounds stupid while I read it . Obviously you read spoilers and are trying to make us thing otherwise.</br>  <br>That pussy ain't worth it.</br>  <br><br>But I like dogs. We have a lot in common.</br></br>  <br>Adlet and Flamie makes a more entertaining combo, that's for sure.</br>  <br>No<br>Adlet x bunny has more chemistry</br></br>  <br>No bunny is a liar and a whore.</br>  <br>still would give better fuck than deadfish like fremy</br>  <br><br>Adlet has such an asshole fighting style. It reminds me of Usopp's if he was competent  and likeable. </br></br>  <br>Fremy's physical abilities are above Nashetania.<br><br>Usopp only fights with tricks, Adlet has tricks + martial training.</br></br></br>  All this deception and deceit. This is more of a mystery novel than anything else.   I just got done reading volume 1 <br>I don't know if I want to get off of Mr. Bone's Wild Ride anymore <br>All I know is I want that bunny dead</br></br>  <br><br>Leave bunny alone. Best girl.</br></br>  <br>Bunny is a cripple in vol 3 if that makes you feel better.</br>  <br>If it crippled to death than yeah, I'm ok with it <br><br><br>I'm writing down all the ways I want her to die, and there's nothing you can do about it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Clearly best girl. Only downside is we had to wait through almost a third of the season before she shows up.</br>  <br><br> implying the best solution is not to reform the majin <br><br>pls<br><br>Bunny did nothing wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm bullying the Bunny and I'm enjoying it</br>  <br>Because Flemy has actual combat experience while Bunny does not. Also magic flintlock is probably bullshit with insane accuracy, penetration or something. And Bunny's 'sword' handling is limited (they tend to move predictably and can only move within certain range from her).</br>  I wonder who the better warrior is between Daryun and Goldof.  <br><br>Goldof in hime-modo. Otherwise Daryun.</br></br>  <br>What about Daryun in denka-modo?</br>  <br><br>Not stronk enough. Hime-modo is new level.</br></br>  <br><br>Goldof is better  __at being cucked </br></br>  <br>looks like your typical bossy hard-ass typ that's never happy.</br>  <br>Daryun can take on Heracles. It's gotta go to him.</br>  <br>Right? Perfect in every way.</br>  <br>She's gonna be wet for Adlet after this barrier ordeal</br>  I love me some QUALITY   just finished reading all the translated novels <br> hyped as fuck <br> wants to share the love <br> all its threads are shit <br><br>Why are you doing this to me, /a/?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> people spoiling shit from the untranslated volumes <br><br>Fucking weaboos.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Rokka is great.

He's sick?</br>  <br>I remember how he got offended when Mora told him he didn't know about love.</br>  <br>Adlet ain't either of those two though.</br>  <br>Read his afterwords, he got sleeping problems.

For almost every night that I went to bed I would have some bad dream, snap awake, and then jump out of my futon. <br> I would be strangled by some woman I didn’t know, a hand would reach up from the floor and drag me down beneath the ground, something extremely heavy and repulsive would be set on my stomach, or I would have to go to the restroom but someone would be grabbing my legs and I couldn’t move….those were the main situations I encountered in my nightmares. <br> On somewhat rare occasions I would have crazy dreams where I was holding the ripped-off legs of an eroge character I had played with before going to bed, or one where a strange plump man around his forties, who I’d never met, would be in my room and then proceed to defecate all over the place. <br> I would have those kinds of dreams at least once a night, and on a bad night I would have them twice or even three times, waking from one after another. <br> Nightmares have accompanied me in one way or another for over ten years. And I have tried again and again to solve the issue. <br> Using a mental approach of deliberately taking a bath and listening to music to relax before going to bed had somewhat of an effect, but it did not lead to a definitive solution. And exercising until I was out of breath then getting into my futon, or staying up late until I could no longer keep my eyes open before going to bed actually only made my sleeping worse. <br>Placing salt at the crack of my bedroom door, visiting temples, chanting sutras then going to sleep, sitting cross-legged and engaging in Zen meditation before going to sleep, and trying various spiritual methods also had zero effect. It seems that somehow this problem is not within the power of gods and Buddha to control.<br> When I drink to my heart’s content I don’t have any nightmares, but from a health’s perspective it is not a sustainable solution </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a shape shifter.</br>  <br> I wanted the majin to be a mighty terror, not a moe carpet muncher.<br>Women ruin everything.<br/></br> </br>  <br>He finds love in dakimakura.</br>  <br>How do the novels sell anyway?</br>  <br>It's not dakimakura if there's no drawings on it.</br>  <br>It's the only way.<br><br><br>As well as non otaku pandering can pretend to. 4 digits.</br></br></br></br>  <br> S2 never </br>  <br>What about Fremy ?</br>  <br><br> or one where a strange plump man around his forties, who I’d never met, would be in my room and then proceed to defecate all over the place. </br></br>  <br>The best lie is the one peppered by truth.</br>  <br>I bet his true form is even more hideous than the Majin itself.  And bunny would still suck his dick </br>  <br>The guy who manages to translate LN volume within 1-2 weeks after release.</br>  <br>Problem is, no one cares about Rokka while autists have been clamoring for the likes if Shieldvictim and Mushishit since way, way back.</br>  <br><br>But the Majin is confirmed bishoujo.</br></br>  <br>Well I only know him through his translations of the Index LNs</br>  <br>She's literally an ugly mud.</br>  <br>Was.<br>It's a ball of darkness with human limbs growing right now.</br></br>  <br>Nice fake spoiler.</br>  <br>Fucker translates Owari and Horizon and gets them done fast while retaining a decent amount of quality.</br>  <br>I think I got it now.<br><br>Saint and Majin used to be friends but Main went DARKNESS and Saint needed to kill her to save the world.<br><br>But then, she couldn't kill her so she made her immortal marked by that single flower near the Majin.<br><br>She hoped someday there would be heroes that could save both her and the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh boy, chapter four got translated  <br>Slowpoke</br>  <br>It had taken over a month for him to do it, so I hadn't been checking recently</br>  <br> a month <br>I'm so fucked.</br></br>  <br>She's cononically ugly.</br>  <br>Why? Do you plan on dying?</br>  <br>I don't have any other good LN to read.<br><br>Unless Jinrui has been translated.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it's quite surprising that people don't always believe everything they read here. I mean, so far, all the spoilers posted here are 100% true.</br>  <br>read someWNs anon, I heard bunch of them got  machine  translated</br>  <br>There's a difference between leaving rooms for doubts and being outright retarded and deluded into thinking no one can access the source or spoilers.</br>  Who is the better writer?<br><br>Oshii wrote anime like Urusei Yatsura, Ghost in the Shell, Mobile Police Patlabor.<br><br>Urobuchi wrote Fate/Zero, Madoka, Psycho Pass.</br></br></br></br>  Gaim is better than any of those so Urobuchi.   Fate/Zero <br>shit<br><br> Madoka <br>overrated<br><br> Psycho Pass <br>absolute shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must have been really bored to make this thread</br>  <br>This is some really bad bait. <br><br><br>Oshii. I wish he'd make some good live action but I guess he really is an anime director.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka is only overrated while other two are shit. <br><br>Moefag pls.</br></br></br>  Madoka is dead set garbage.  Don't forget about Urobuchi's masterpiece: Blassreiter.<br><br>Such a great anime writer.</br></br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br>buyfag.moe</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm just waiting for someone to buy her and fill the glass with cum. Then perhaps drink it</br>    <br>I'm not even talking about getting a refund or anything because I don't care about that. They're just doing amateur hour shit which is, for a distributor, embarrassing.<br><br>Let's say that container box full of figs was going to a retail store. You don't sell damaged box items for full price. Amazon doesn't do it. Best buy won't do it. Etc. They drop the price on it. If it's really bad it gets damaged out. Items coming from the manufacturer's factory to the distributor should going to be packaged properly because if that shows up and shit is fucked up that means lost sales and revenue. And when it's going from the distributor to end consumers it should be given decent packaging. One or two packages get dented, items/boxes get damaged, okay, that's a fluke. It happens. But if it's regularly happening? That means the process is fucked up. They're setting themselves up for failure from the get go by not packaging properly. Yeah, they want to ignore customer complaints. That's their perogative. They wouldn't be getting these complaints if they just paid for some fucking bubblewrap. Paper is fine most of the time as many amiami packages can attest (although even they switched to cardboard frames for things like figma). But even amiami knows to put a buffer between the outer wall and the actual figure box.</br></br></br>  <br>Any aussie that complains about their exchange rates being lower than america's is an idiot.</br>  <br>Fun fact: Hockey wants to ditch the tax-free threshold for imports, too.</br>  No Im@s thread; then lets make one.<br><br>Did /a/ enjoy the top cake?</br></br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy whenever she talks. <br><br>I know how you feel. It's the same with Akane too. It's nearly impossible for me not to smile whenever I see and/or hear her.</br></br></br>  <br>This with pretty much all the idols with some kind of unique speech, it feels refreshing to hear when everyone speaks plainly.</br>    Would Chihaya and Kaede be a good unit? Or would they kill their fans with their no stop puns?  <br>Azusa and Kaede would be better, Chihaya and Kaede stand on 2 different ends of the spectrum it feels weird putting them together.</br>  Beef Suturoganoffu did this  <br>Well she have something in common with you then</br>  <br> /m/ <br>please go wash your hands now</br></br>  <br>But we saw those keywords several days ago...</br>  <br>Who had a harder life, Nana or Bikkie?</br>  Chris is the weakest and worst nymphogear.<br>this is a fact</br>  another yuru yuri thread  It comes to this.<br><br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Himawari pls,  you know what to do, tickle her into submission and then drag her home </br>  I've heard that a freshly tickled brat makes a good blanket.  <br>meant to reply to<br/></br>  <br><br>I still can't get over how happy Sakurako looks in that pic<br> you'll never have a brat blanket <br> youll never have a boobie monster bed </br></br></br></br>  Is it worth it to wait for Hiyruu, or should I be a horriblefag and watch horriblesubs?  <br>The problem with Funi's translation is that it's more of a dubsub than a true translation. Even the signs are wildly incorrect at times (but in the name of localization). As long as you're OK with this, then Funi's translation is fine. The spirit of what's said does make it across. However, Hiryuu is the only group actually translating as we have come to expect a translation to be - as literal as practically possible.<br><br> being retarded <br>Funimation translations = senketsu subtitles = clawhammer "fansubs"</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't.</br>  fuck claw hammer's quality is shit and i thought it was uncensored. Is this gesture she makes censored regardless?  <br>Yep. I guess it´s for comedic effect.</br>  <br><br>It's not CR, it's Funi.</br></br></blockquote>]
