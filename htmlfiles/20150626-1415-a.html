[ Read the guide: http://buyfag.moe  Rock was right.  you have no taste, Revvy. Take that hawaiian shirt back.     tfw no kumiko figure   The wait begins.   It's inevitable, just have patience. At the very least, everything under the sun gets a nendoroid, if you're into that shit.     wait for wonfes. That's when most of the latest season figures are announced.  Please let there be an Auska figure too    Finally got around to buy some acrylic risers for my display cabinet  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848  Oh fuck off already.    Who pissed on her towel?    Around 30 acrylic risers..    corner looks fucked up for the one in the cabinet pretty shitty riser for your fancy ass cabinet imo    I've beard the naked body is exclusive, but that seems like a strange decision. He doesn't seem to come with anything else except this stupid Shinkawa face.   Oh well, I'll buy at least 2 regardless       soon     How much did you pay?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848   Not the Tokyoshitmode shills again. Can we get you banned?     I just hope (with Orange Rouge and everything) that there will be Kekkai Sensen scales.    But I'd take Kumiko too.       That's the protective film which I haven't bothered to take off, they're all clear.    Where did you buy them?    What's wrong with that site?    Oh that's much better then Have fun setting up your displays     They removed the commercial spam reporting option, but it's worth a try anyway.    Overpriced. Shills come here every once in a while and people got tired of hearing about that site.     Can you post pics of your display when you're done adding them?    Who is this? I don't know kanji or the character, but that little arcade cabinet is way too much.   £176 in total including shipping. The 3 tier riser were £12.49, single riser was £2.96 and the book holders were £5.49.   Site called displaysense, I previously bought my display cabinet from them.   I plan on doing so, but I'm currently dreading setting up all the Nendoroid Petits I have.          That particular figure seems like it's decently priced. Considering it's a retailer for Aniplex, you bypass the need to pay BiJ or N-Y their profit + proxy service.    Character from a dead manga. High score girl.     I agree that the Aniplex exclusives are the only thing worth ordering from there.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848   Ok.  Either way, how likely is that NY will open pre-orders for her again? Never used them before.      Etotama figs at Wonfes please.   What are the chances of a complete Etotama nendoroid line?  Don't answer.      High Score Girl. A story set in the early 90s about a boy and a shy, cute and very angry girl who's pretty good at video games. Notorious because all the games and consoles appearing in the story are real.  SNK then sued Square/Enix because apparently somebody forgot to ask them to use Fatal Fury, etc. This caused the manga to stay in an eternal hiatus. In the end it was dumb move because it's pretty much free advertising for SNK Playmore and all the games shown get praise from the main character.  Now this is intriguing because it's hinting the manga might return soon.        Fuck, it's dead? I only have the first two volumes but I figured I'd buy the rest once it's finished because it was really enjoyable. Was it just not popular enough?      __ 0%   Pretty mode nendos of some of the girls would nice though.       Where did you buy them?    Thank SNK.    Thanks for answering my question before I asked it. I couldn't connect to the server for whatever reason.    2nd response.    Buying male figures   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127167848  No one cares, shill.    That's a super-movable nendoroid, right? Is it true that those are really brittle?     lovelive     Yes and yes   Stop posting this every thread.      Post figures of death anons. I need to find one looking all badass and deadly.   Brittle implies they break, which they don't, but they're pretty poorly designed. The joints fall apart constantly when you're posing them.    Seriously? Why would they even do that? Alright, /a/ might not have that much problems with it, but I thought that other boards were rather prone to get targeted by shilling.     The only choice      That's annoying, I wish they'd stop with those.    Anybody pre-ordering this?   I guess it's just encompassed by the 'rule violation' option. Either that or the new administration plan to sell-out to shills.     Ask /m/ or /toy/  I think most mecha designs are ugly as fuck      Not bad. Looks like it'll be hard to find, and no doubt expensive, but cool. I like jojo, so good suggestion anon. Ill see if i can find a used one on mfc.   I got an email from GSC saying my paypal payment has failed, I called paypal and they told me that there wasn't any transaction from GSC and that I should just place another order. I gave up trying to explain what a pre-order was and how I can't just place a new order. I have sent GSC a request to try again or do a manual payment. Is there anything else I should do?    not wanting to fuck a takemikazuchi    Kirarin when   I don't know. They act like it's some cool feature that increases poseability but then they give you far fewer parts to pose with so it works out about the same in the end. It's just a nendo that looks worse and falls apart.  HMO Miku is the only one I like, and that's because she comes with a shitload of accessories.      Not him, but they just always look either boring as fuck, or ridiculous to me.    Yes /toy/ have TF generals, I just wondering if Buyfag likes TF MP or not    She never even made it to the PS4  ;_;      Probably before I get my KWSM    If there's a god, never.    I like how this one actually has a sense of volume to it and looks decent in both forms as opposed to those shitty ones that look really awkward when transformed. Not too big on these so I don't know, maybe there's better ones out there.  Price tag is a little hefty for my tastes though.      Don't be like that, anon.       My ears hurt just from looking at pictures of her. Whoever thought up her character should be executed for crimes against humanity.      Yeah, I want her too    There's probably some sculptor out there who has a fetish for giantesses and motherly women who don't act their age, and a manager who will okay that piece.  I don't see any sculptor being okayed to make a modest christmas cake idol unless it's part of a set like Phat's Takane.       TOM and the rest of the M.A.G buy it   all the other anime related boards get purged   crunchy account needed to post    posting anime screenshots or manga pages will get you banned    nyaa and co. will trigger the spam filter   stream shilling everywhere    you can't post in threads about series that aren't licensed in your country   this site is brought to you by aniplex, thank you for supporting the industry :^)            That'd probably make buyfag better though.    290k, 100k, 140k  Fuck, Japan loves their red-headed dolls.    Any buyfag supporting licensed garbage might as well kill itself.     hurrr Takane is a granny  I want this meme to stop. If someone is a christmas cake from the old cast it's Piyo-chan and maybe Azusa, at least if you have some retarded arbitrary definition where everyone over 20 is too old for you.      Japan loves their red-headed dolls  And yet I can't find a good one of Kurisu     Takane is fucking 18.    Takane is not a granny but you cant tell me that the phat takane figure doesnt look like a granny. Its the only figure from their im@s line that i find really disappointing. Well yayoi's face looks retarded but i heard its fine in person but i dont own it so i cant say.     Always trust your dick.   Yeah I thought it was pretty obvious when people said that they were talking about the figure, not Takane herself, but I guess not.    Where did you get that from and why is it so blurry? Is it legit from an artist who does sculpts for figures or just a personal work?    So we should only buy bootleg things? Or did you mean to say something else, but just said it in a retarded way.  It doesn't matter her actual age, the only thing that matters is who will buy the figure and what impression that figure gives on the buyer.       you cant tell me that the phat takane figure doesnt look like a granny  I don't think she looks like a granny. I always just thought she looked refined. I never even thought granny until it came up in these threads.     People would just buy more shit from series they have never heard about, leading to more autistic arguments, killing these threads once and for all. Also no buying from filthy resellers anymore, only valid partner shops allowed who faithfully contribute to your local economy.      not recognizing the filename  it's from the premier source of figure sculpts called  pixiv     I just want Phat to make Azusa and Ritsuko already, is that too much to ask?   People call her granny in other threads too, not just here where it might be only in regards to the figure.    It's the shawl. Nobody under the age of 60 wears a god damn shawl these days. Not one like that, anyway.    I wear shawls, I think they're comfy.  Fuck am I an old woman?      There's a difference between a shawl and a jizz blanket, anon.    cancelled 1st AmiAmi order this month   feel like utter scum     I meant localized.    I would rather have more Ranko figures first. Perhaps one with her being darknessed from behind by her tomodachi     I'd love Ranko or Kaede figures but I will always want my 765 girls first.       Girlfriend  As long as her name is Amico.     you can cancel up to 4/5 before getting banned.    those red heads have nothing on this rozen slut    that's just delusional, I saw her in YAJ for around 290-310K    Well that's a 1/1 doll; of course there's no comparison.   Do I buy the Houki?      £176 fot a bit of plastic     we made that crap in DT for pennies        I ordered something by accident once, and I couldn't bring myself to cancel it.   Her nose is too big, yuck I don't think she looks that different compared to my grandma's dolls.   That's a SD, if you want vanishing noses you need to look at DDs.     There will never be a doll that properly captures the Rozen's faces.     I know, my point is that you could get some doll who resembles her for far less.     oh god. Could you imagine that fuck'in thing walking around?     If its exclusive that really would suck.      Bought a PS4   Forgot about my preorders on amiami   Oops might get banned       is that shit still an exclusive      go in fetal position and cry, you dun goofed      choosing ps4 over figures  I hope you will.     you probably would get used to it. certainly prettier than many pets people keep around.    Walking around, demanding tea, attacking your shins ...    I have cancelled 5 orders, after the last one I got a warning.    cute!    It actually takes a lot to get banned. People here just try to scare you.    several Revy figures   a Roberta one   a Balalaika one   no Sawyer one  Life is suffering.       Thanks, it's not like I wanted to sleep today anyway.    I'll just wait for GSC's reply that my order has been cancelled and that my account is banned for non payment.   A gal I know cancelled 22 orders at amiami, but then again she had over 10K points at the same store   use your credit card (If they accept them)    Pretty sure that Commercial/Spam just gets reported like any other rule violation now. I don't think it actually changes anything in terms of moderation, rule violations are rule violations.    I got banned for posting a youtube's link to a figure review (which wasn't even mine)   Alleyne by Megahouse.   Boy this site just gets worse and worse.    Still not as goos as the OS one    Based off of this art.    I was going to try that next if Paypal didn't work, I'm pretty sure they accept them.    I'm getting bored of my ps4    The post was still got deleted. Results matter.    Is blush like this really that hard to do with a pad printer? How come we always get like three blush lines on each cheek instead.   So, I could get banned if I post a Mandarake or Amiami link?  Has anyone here cancelled "all future orders" spanning over multiple months, before?  Curious as i've been out of work for awhile, made pre-orders before I was redundant, and am in a situation whedre a bunch of those orders are coming up, mounting into the 100,000's of yen in total, something obviously an unemployed person can't afford.  I mean, obviously I can just not pay, but has anyone cancelled a large amount like that and not been banned?        once it's finished  Truly the worst kind of fan. Leaving the publication with a shrinking number of copies and untimely death.    <br/>  Does Fukuoka Manda still undervalue?   Nowa is better.  Please more Nowa.     I actually think she looks nice.   Wo is here   It's not even like they posted a referral link Saying that a store has an item e to no benefit to themselves is hardly even shilling, especially when the shop in question is an official retailer, resulting in a far cheaper price than any other forwarder you guys paying forty extra dollars for. It's no different than the mentions of something going up on AmiAmi.      I canceled almost all my orders with Amiami before. It was around 10 orders. I'm not sure how much you plan to cancel but they were fine with mine.    Take a proper picture, not one with your shit cellphone    Worst elf.  Call me when they make some more Echidna.      people who buy your figure on ebay with a 1 feedback account and ask for no tracking shipping, and then don't pay when you refuse.   people who buy your $3 item on ebay, and then buy your $300 item on ebay and send you a fake payment received email.  Not sure if this is better or worse than having to deal with teenage girls on mfc.     I don't really like the streamlining, gives me the feeling that they just delete stuff that has enough reports without even looking at it anymore.    I'd say worse because at least you don't have to deal with eBay's shitty fees on MFC.     using ebay  I found your problem.     Blue elfs are better    This is not true you goddamn idiot. When will people realize that it's not the same for everyone?  There are three main influences that decide whether or not you get banned, and those are as follows: how much you've spent on their store, the mood of whoever reads your sorry e-mail/sees that you've ignored your payment notices, and lastly how often your dumb ass has made a stupid order that you had to cancel.      sorry elves    So if i've spent 10k USD in the past year, I should be fine?    I guess so, just send them an email explaining your situation.    Echidna also comes in that flavour.    If this is your first cancellation, then yes, you will most likely be fine.    Shit man, I basically only buy manga when I'm in Japan and was planning on buying whatever had come out since last time when next I went. I just didn't feel like typing out the entire situation like I'm fucking blogging.    I've gone through 3 accounts so I'm an experienced canceler, pal.     send you a fake payment received email.  What the fuck? people do that?     Why don't you apply for a loan, I got 4k the past month, and I'm buying like crazy .     Taking out a loan to buy Chinese plastic  Don't do this.     Talk about being an unresponsible moron.    thats not a slope that's a steep cliff    Keep it up, anon. You're the pride of the thread, sacrificing your future for the sake of PVC.    RIP       Shit cellphone is fine. Just take it in direct sunlight.     If it gives you any comfort, they were probably already doing that if such was the case.   Anyone ordering this?   Shitty fees don't matter, because Ebay is a global marketplace and you can charge well over those shitty fees. I get that 1000 free listings ad like every month.     FunnyKnights  Literally who?    I got all these for 60 at a local dvd store Did I do good?    There's worse. Some faggot in a previous thread didn't go to the dentist because he wasn't sure if a figure is going to get delayed. That's like pants on head retarded.    So which would you rather give up to obtain PVC? Your teeth or your credit rating?    kongou is my waifu, but I will not be ordering it. Funnyknights havent made much, and what they have made certainly isnt worth 14k. If it were 8k I would jump on it. Also  that mouth  I dont have much hope for Phat's Kongou either. Please wonfes give me an actual good Kongou.      Neither because I'm not a retard.    My exwife already ruined my credit score but I have enough PVC to fill a large mausoleum.    Excel is good shit     my waifu   nor getting everything fir the shrine  My waifu is rikka and I got every damn bad qc, stupid pose, dumb face, and low quality figure that existed of her and spent stupid amounts of money regardless of quality. If she's your waifu, she's worth it      I disagree. I've got some mediocre figures that have grown on me over time, but if it's just plain terrible I wouldn't buy it.    ill wait till it bins. Not gonna waste the money. Thats $120 I could save for an actual good release.     have a waifu   buy even the stuff that shits on her image and name just because   You're worse than shit as a husbando.       Like you're mom.     My waifu is rikka    kongou is my waifu       Quality over quantity. Why buy things that look like shit you don't even like?   I preordered a thing.   I have taken my first step into a larger (and more terrifying) world.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127176668  Oh you troll them hard, kid   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127176668  What does the World Taekwondo Federation have to do with buyfagging?    Tell us, why her?    Good choice.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127176668   The World Taekwondo Federation is fine with me.      a thing   Why do people say this? do they think its cute or something?     Amiami wants me to pay for a preorder, but I already bought the figure earlier in a local store. Wat do? Should I leave the country?    My sides!     Yukari requires no justification.     I think you're cute.    I bet you're not even fluffy.    Why do people get a bug up their ass about shit like this? Do they think it makes them look superior or something?    I need more fluffy in my life.   Pre-orders when?   I am actually.    I like her exuberance and love of tanks, I guess - plan on collecting the whole crew at some point, but that one in particular jumped out at me.   Christ I don't know what's happening to me - I place one pre-order, now I'm eyeballing display cases, lights, and more and more pieces to display. This slope is slippery indeed.      Wait till you get into dolls. I only have one but have 4 pre ordered.    Buy it, resell it on Amazon or ebay for 1.5 times as much. Some dipshit will buy it.    I want to touch your hair     Limited to 1500 pieces.   Pre-order for non-attendees of San Diego Comic Con begins Friday, 6/26 at 10AM PST on kotous.com      well to be fair at least she looks better than the original ver    That all?    Go back in time and stop yourself from being a forgetful/impatient/brain-damaged retard.     <br/>      Fluffy an undisputed best.     Most likely, but it was still nice to pretend.    Saori was the best though.     Isn't she out soon?    Placed my order yesterday, cant wait to pokerface the taxman........ fuck sweden.   Help me  I'm losing control      what? it's not like I'd buy her anyway.     !!!   ........  go drown yourself.       &gt;!!!  who are you quoting?     Why the hell do you care about what other people might think?     implying the filename isn't part of the post     Just embrace it. Eventually you'll grow tired of it and sell the ones you don;t really display thus providing more room and money to buy more. Soon you'll have entire rooms dedicated to different franchises. Past that separate houses to store your hoard. There is no reasoning with it there is no pleading with it there is no escaping it. Embrace us.    Looks like July-ish, although knowing release dates could be later.   Captcha asks for pizza   Shows me stop signs        Same shape. Sorta. Not really though.    I thought he meant lying to them about the price or something?    And you forgot the fact that around 90% of people sell all/ most of their collections in the long run.     wait.  It's like you think it's inevitable. There's some things that are inevitable if you stay in the hobby long enough. Becoming an idolfag is one of them. Outgrowing edgemaster shit is another. Buying dolls is not one of them.   But we don't all cross the event horizon. Most of us are content without playing on the edge of the abyss.        And now I'm pricing plexiglass and lights to turn a wooden cabinet into a display case. Should be working but fuck it, my clients wont get any more dead.     becoming an idolfag is one of them  If you were born with shit taste, maybe.     You're just not mature enough to understand. Graduate from college, and don't get married for a decade and a half. You will understand idols then.    Uh what that's doesn't make any sense     And you forgot the fact that around 90% of people sell all/ most of their collections in the long run  I keep wanting to go to Ebay, to try my luck at used stuff but...well, I've seen the threads here. I know what people do to them. And it frightens me.  As an aside, I get a kick out of picturing myself in a nursing home at 93 years old, staring at a GuP Figma, mumbling about drifting in Panzers.       Because red skin is god tier.     They're all good girls.       As an aside, I get a kick out of picturing myself in a nursing home at 93 years old, staring at a GuP Figma, mumbling about drifting in Panzers.   I've heard similar things countless times, in the end just a tiny percentage keeps their collections.        People change. I no longer care for the things I liked 10 years ago. Who knows what I'll think 10 or 20 years from now.    I didn't know they fixed her face, I'd buy her but then again I don't want to collect many bishoujos    Oh I don't doubt I'll end up selling it a ways down the road, I just found the idea amusing.  Unless I end up a hopeless shut-in for the rest of my life. But hey, what are the odds of that?      When did this 90% meme start?    You should be fine; I've seen comments from people saying that they needed to do a manual payment with GSC. They're not going to just straight up cancel your order and potentially lose money, after all. I think they give 30 days after a failed payment attempt.  I can't find the pending charge for Ren anywhere in my PayPal account, but the order is there in my GSC account, so I'll probably have to ask for a manual payment too. I can't remember when PayPal changed their site, but I think that might have something to do with it since pending charges don't just disappear on their own, and if it had been cancelled there still would've been a listing for it.     Is it just one fag that keeps posting all these non-/a/ images or what?  So I found this Tell Your World Miku at a local shop for $45, where on amiami and BIJ they sell for about ¥9200. Is this a steal or did I not look hard enough?   Yeah, buy it. It's a great bargain. I'm totally not going to filter you either.     Nice bootleg    Isn't that a bootleg? does the box has the Hobby japan hologram?    I was thinking the same, honestly. At least he's on topic.    Yes you should definitely go for it.    Please God, not another retarded tripfag.  But yeah, you should totally buy that.      True enough. It could easily be worse.    I better don't get fed up with anime then. Looking back and thinking that all those hours watching anime were just a a huge waste of time sounds rather uncomfortable.    Your board is a strange and foreign land to me, so I do not possess suitable images in a great enough quantity to suit my posting needs.    I thought it was common knowledge, unless you're too young, know very few collectors, or new in this hobby.      This is the bootleg box.      Yes, and filter    That's not how it works.    I'm sure I wasted more hours on this shitty site than watching anime at this point. Thinking about all the lost meaningless hours.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216  &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/    What a steal, I would totally get that if I were you.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216  fuck off.    No worries.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216  Now this is the true cancer.       You're right, you should stop doing what you enjoy because you might not enjoy it anymore in ten years.    Interests change. But you can still look back and have fond memories of your old interests.  Like I barely play any vidya these days, but I still had fun in MMOs.      That's reassuring, thanks. My order is the same, pending on GSC but not anywhere on my PayPal. Hopefully this gets sorted out quickly, I want my Re.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216   I got my boyfriend to buy his first figure recently, he's envious of my collection.     Well, the only thing that I stopped caring about from my past is reading big three shit and I definitely think that I wasted time and money on that.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216  I knew you would ask this question again.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216  It's already happened. My friend came over and saw all the figures and shit i have and she took a picture and put it on Instagram and made me look like a pervert fag. I don't care really.     That's nice.    Hey man, nice blog, where can I subscribe?       Well there's no sticker. But I've seen three different box styles now that I watched this video. It's different from this. Packaging is the same, and the bases are different. Also box in bad shape because last one = floor model.  https://youtu be/79p_MvgfAeQ         I thought /a/ reaction images spill onto other boards like toxic waste.     Nobody gives a fuck, you stupid cunts.      only replying to my comment but no replying to any of the other ones who shared a story.     Sticker probably fell off, might as well buy it.    Yeah but in that case I still wouldn't get rid of the stuff.  Maybe I just have a slight thing for hoarding though.     Well I already did, now I'm trying to figure out if I got gyped for not knowing my shit. The paints are different from on the box as well.    They usually do, but I'm at work right now, so my folder of images is small and malnourished. I was basically grasping at straws to find anything remotely relevant when I did.    There's obviously multiple bootlegs.    It's just the lighting, I'm sure. You did great.       What is this thing called, searching for "curtains" doesn't help    Don't feel pressured to post an image with every post, especially in the buyfag threads.    If it doesn't look like this it's a bootleg. I can't really tell by your pictures but tou should be able to see the difference.    I love you too    roller blinds   I wonder what they were thinking when they designed her.       Everytime you've heard of someone selling their collection, you're hearing it from an at least semi-social type, to think they amount to anywhere near 90% is retarded. You don't hear shit about the collectors who don't see fit to talk about their figures and things, they keep it to themselves. The quiet ones, who I figure are more likely to keep their collections until they die, will never factor into any shitty estimate you pull out your ass.    Well fuck me gently with a chainsaw. I need to learn my shit.    Would normalfags actually honor those kinds of don't look boundaries or do I just have the most autistic friends with no sense of respect?     roller blinds  Thank you     Fuck off.    Meant for .  But I guess it's appropriate for both of you.      some people are nosy, some aren't.   So, did the fellow who dls every picture in these threads upload his folder in the end?   It's probably the first thing people will look at when you leave the room.    I want glass doors like this, but they're too expensive.  I also want a mirror back, but that makes taking pictures without showing your face and room also impossible. Look at the retarded angle the person had to take the picture at.  That cabinet looks like a typical "closet" for many Japanese people living in a 1ldk. Most people would think clothes were in there, unless they got a sideways glance.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178914  seriously though, you really should fuck off    It doesn't matter if you're a social type or not. Interests change, people change. Having someone that knows or doesn't know that you have a collection is meaningless if you're no longer interested in collecting.     my friends are nuuurdy so I'm totes not a normalfag teehee  People need to stop this.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178914   Agree. This is the wrong forum for you. Definitely go to Reddit. They'll treat you how you want to be treated and won't insult your shitposting.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127178216  If they didn't like you for who you are they why would you want to date them?     No need to quote your life.    I want normies to leave.  Fuck off already. This thread is atrocious.  Nobody cares about how nosy your friends are, or whether some hypothetical 3D whore will accept you.  These threads are for talking about plastic butts, other pointless stupid shit that people here spend their money on.        but that makes taking pictures without showing your face and room also impossible     American statues  Laughed a bit.    That has nothing to do with my post, unless you're trying to say that 90% of people in general rid themselves of their collections before they die, regardless of what the collection is or what kind of person they are. In which case, fuck off you complete retard.     Putting yourself into jewish debt slavery for the rest of your life over chinese PVC figurines   The happy merchant is very pleased right now.      To be fair, they have to work off weaker art.    that's nice for a gk    Doesn't look bad actually Too bad it is from a piece of shit show     there is worse stuff out there     Most of us are content without playing on the edge of the abyss.   implying you are not all irredeemable faggots      Wasn't trying to say that. I'm not talking about %'s but the reason people quit.    Why won't they outsource to Japanese companies? I bet it would sell a lot.    I'm so proud. I made that image.    It almost looks good. If alter made it, in their standard quality of course, I would buy it.   Fucking Solaris Japan, I bought something there on Monday and got EMS for it and it still hasn't even been dispatched. I knew they were jews but not slow fucking jews.    Alter wasting time on such shit as Korra      They did, RIOT just don't like money.     they had an official nendo, but I think it was only available at one event.    Okay.   Finally came in after all these months. Very pleased with it.    all of those hot LoL bitches   not a single scale worth mentioning  Okay.      prize figure quality maybe.   can't go wrong with fox girls. didn't they also add a precure clone as character or something like that?        I'm not going to worst korea to pick up a nendo.     now learn to take pictures without flash and we might actually have something nice to look at    At least that doujin is pretty good.   Who is  ready  here?  How does one determine if a seller on amazon is legit? It's a last resort, but they've got something I've been wanting for a while and haven't been able to find. The seller is based in japan, and their reviews are fine, but I'm still unsure.   Has anyone taken decent pictures of her?    Never had any issues with Amazon, I always shop around for the best price. As long as its based in Japan you should be fine.    I definitely am.    Isn't their figure stuff pretty overpriced or did you order something else?   I'm amazed Shiki's pre-order in NY closed so fucking fast while Hestia is still up.   Yes their stuff is usually very overpriced, but they can be slow to react to market prices changing so you can sometimes get stuff for cheap.    She's lovely, isn't she?    Aniplex has preorder limits, Hobby Japan doesn't.    Is this lala?     Does it? Her fucking pre-order period ends in September.     Every time I scroll past this thumbnail I keep thinking it's Poison and then I get disappointed when I remember it's not.    Dorama  Cute    fucking preorders when    Preorder limit - How many can be ordered by everyone How many can be ordered by a single person. How many can be ordered in a single order.   Thinking isn't that hard, you should try it next time.        <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127181002  Oh there's a trip user on r9k that uses yams   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127181002   :/     The empty gaze is captivating. It's like staring into an  abyss     We're all maladjusted in one way or another. Not all of us are loners, some of us are acquainted with other maladjusted freaks like ourselves, to varying degrees. Some of us have brothers or family which are basically our only friends, some of us don't.      Just report and ignore it.     I am increasing convincxDed there are 4chan bots that screen for smiles to shitpost at.     Or maybe the crossboarding shits who use them get called out for it by regular users.    Your post is more of a shitpost than what you linked.   Preordered this butt, my noodles cant wait till November.   Don't care. Already have OS leaf swimsuit one, don't need more of her. Give us a different QB Girl.     I'm getting paid this week, and going to be in Tokyo next semester. What do I cop while I'm over here, and what should I wait to try and find in Akiba?      one of my grails  Fuck you too.     What?    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127182515  I don't enjoy the thought of other people getting my grail, no need to invoke a boogeyman like a paranoid retard.     Like you'll actually be able to find the grail of grails over there and be able to afford it with a single /a/ paycheck.   Who's a M like me?     Fuck you people and your 'grails', it's not that there are so few of anything in the picture that you'll never see it again, you're all acting like those cunts on MFC.       deletes post   makes another one afterwards, much more hostile than the first      I didn't delete that one, it must have been a janitor or mod.    Dat ass, but shitty show.    The tripshit and his shitposter buddy had their posts wiped.    Ledy   People of buyfag, post your grails, thanks.  What temperature do I have to start worrying about my figures getting sticky?  I'm not going to have air-conditioning for the next month.    The part of the guide that links to the forum post about figure maintenance mentions it.    Depends on the humidity and the figures themselves, you can have some leaking at not even 35°C, while others can handle way higher temperatures.      Once I have a job again I'll start saving up for Miku.     ffs I don't even know which one you guys are referring to. Shiki? Like I don't know the rarities of things, that's why I asked in the first place.     I have a lot of grails to choose from    There's some on Ebay, but I'll be fucked if I drop $450 on it.      I'll never get her unless there's a re-release though   That miku is overrated as fuck       Just like that Yoko     That miku is overrated as fuck  Maybe to you, but I don't care. She's hands down my favorite Yuki Miku design to date and I want her.      1/1 doll of a 1/3 scale doll character      not having everything you want already    Its Time! I wonder how much the forced ems shipping will be.        50-60cm of resin is going to be a lot.      Hopefully one day.     Scale 1/3  Fuck it will be mismatched with my 1/2 Sonico.     Good luck, it's good to have a couple of extra big scales.    It's a shame that almost all 1/2, 1/2,5 scales look pretty bad, including that sonico.    No, the Miku's great. Can't say the same about that shitty overpriced Yoko though.   <br/>    ordering this fuckhuge whale   paying 200+ for shipping   buying a resin scale that may be smashed to bits by shipping company   If I had the money I would totally gamble on this Pochaco.         Paying 200+ for shipping   Are you dumb or what?       hair not touching shoulder   misaligned eyes  I'm so sorry for you.      So are they gonna make a pochan on a mobility scooter?    This would be it   Of course, she goes at the front.       The 1/2 Sonico was $230 to ship, so im sure Pochaco will be around the same.     1/3  I would actually get this if I had room to display it. I love big figures.       hair not touching shoulder  It's like you *want* paint transfer.      inb4 some Jap gets it and cuts off the arms to get the bra off     Only after many hardships and mistakes. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6cuymdra<wbr>b1pwyqs/AABOAkeMdx-If8R_vRXaT4DLa?d<wbr>l=0  I will probably start going through and pruning the folder for a June + May leftovers edition.  </wbr></wbr>     It's weird because with larger scale you'd expect more detail but they look way way way less detailed and more basic than smaller scales.     cuts of the arms to get the bra off  Are you retarded?      That's because, contrary to popular belief, the bigger the figure/statue, the harder it is to make it more detailed. The amount of work they'll have to put to make it as detailed as a 1/8,etc would be like 4 times over.     Why even bother though if it's going to be sub-prize figure detail, just bigger.    If two parts of the figures naturally touch why is paint transfer an issue?  If it does transfer, you'll never see it.       sub-prize figure detail  You don't own any prize figures or large scale figures do you?        I don't know, don't even get why people buy them when they look so awful.  I would only buy 1/1-1/2 if they looked like this  But then again the price would be in the millions anime dollars since they have actually work put into it.        'Murrican Edition     Does anyone have that pic of the guy walking with the 1/2 Sonico box slung over his shoulder walking through a crowd like he doesn't give a fuck?   QUICK GIVE ME ALL YOUR ANIME FIGURES OR I'LL BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT   The wait was definitely worth it.   Could not agree more.         Not to some faggot who doesn't know basic trigger discipline.   What a lewd Queen's Blade   Do your worst!     tanned     Nice airgun.   Don't think it's contextually relevant given that he's threatening to shoot you.       I would honestly rather die    The ass is lacking.    Glazed ham    end of the month   waiting for shit to release   watching order go in-stock one by one   and there is always one thing that delay the whole box.       I hate when faggots mention trigger discipline for scenarios that don't call for it. It's like when a kid learns a new word and shoehorns it into every conversation thinking they sound smart.     Will N-Y charge me right away for her?    Who is your favorite loli?   Illya.   don't you mean shota? You can see his balls right there.    loli   clearly balls  you are the reason why middle eastern countries hate us...      That's a puffy vulva, you fucking imbecile, and together with loli it's the greatest thing to be drawn.    I want to touch her puffy vulva.      puffy  balls is balls anon, you will learn to accept your true feelings......some day.       ........   Kill yourself     Vanilla  Is she too big to be called loli?   Every loli. I even wait in front of a local school. Man, Gradeschoolers are the best.   There are simply too many outstanding lolis it's impossible to choose.   Cute trap dude.     loli     Let's post all of them!  Posting #1 on my list: Loli Nanoha.   Now a MILF she really doesn't count anymore. But hardcore fans of her series will always reminisce about how she shot this spin-off into fame in her first series.         I heard she adopted so she isn't really a MILF   VN Illya &gt;   I'm not really in a mood to argue since adoption = becoming a parent = becoming a mom. And since MILF means "Mom I love to fuck", it fits.   Second we have the girl who everyone loved to hate recently, just because she isn't Nanoha:  Vivio         Unless she pops out a baby from that slit between her legs then she hasn't earned the MILF title.    Every vampire loli in existence.    there can be only one     cannot unsee     wrong one        <br/>       unfinished    DA BEASTO     Whatever  My #3      Try making the outer curve of vulva less visible. And delete the outline on the lower part while you're at it.    Keeping this thread alive with more best lolis    this       Mikan         What? This is a loli thread, if you hadn't noticed or something.    My waifu.   fuck off pedo, i dont see any anime discussion in this shitty pedo thread   They made a fucking movie of that trash? And yeah, she is real cute.  I want her to curse my dick if you understand my implication-      OMG dudes have you seen the newest episode of Gurren Lagann? Kamina is so EPIC and GAR!!  Shit, I failed the entrance exam again.  it's summer   Now this is the 2007 /a/ I know and love.

I miss old /a/   I did it for the lulz.    some faggot whipped out the ecks deee   see guys totally everyone did it back in the glory days, this one post proves it!     GEDDAN     If they didn't tell him to fuck off, that means they accepted it.   /a/ is literally no fun allowed: the board now   You will never get hyped by these simple stupid tings again    Boku &gt; Kashira &gt; Desu &gt; Teabitch &gt; Junk &gt; Nano &gt; Banana    They are both shit. Koutetsushin Jeeg is better     Mudo walked around the outside of the school building   Sorry, 2007 was when I stopped watching anime for a while due to Lucky Star's popularity souring me.   I like Gurren Lagann   So, what's the freedom is like?   Wow, Rebuild of Evangelion 1.0 was very good, I hope they don't mess it up  I want to  play video gaems  with Konata!   And it's stuck in my head, again. Fuck you, faggot.    A simpler time.   Subs are here 3 days later, hayai!   You fucking idiots are such stupid fucks it pisses me off to no end, you literally got your stupid ass handed to you fucking 2 posts later.    It doesnt even have Karaoke Op, what a shitty group     The only ones who can actually remember what it was like on here in 07.    ITT: Morons who are butthurt because 8 years have passed since it was 2007.     Blowjobs are better than sex.  Partly why I can't get into doujins completely because they always have like 3 panels of blowjobs and then 6 pages of shitty sex.  Also, one can catch fish for you and the other can't.     HEY GUYS LETS GO RAID GAIA   guys, remember when rozen maiden aired... like 3 years ago   AOTY prove me wrong    Those threads don't work anymore since almost no one was here in 2007.   The archive is down so I can't go grab pics from there and change the filename so it looks like I've been here since 2004 this time. You win this time, true oldfags. I'll be back next thread though.   NOW I'VE LOST IT  Guys, I think there's something wrong with Mecahazawa but I can't put my finger on it.   You guys don't actually do this, do you?    You do what now?    The archive has only existed since 2007 , newfag.    I had forgotten how cancerous this was    Fuck.    It will never be the mid-2000's again  JDIMSA Then again I probably wouldn't enjoy this site if I were as old as I am now back then.     Actually it started around February 2008. And what you think all the "post the oldest pic in your /a/ folder threads" are for?        There's some things I miss about 2007, but then I remember shit like this. The Jump generation were the worst weeaboos.  raiding habbo is pretty epic u guise I did it for the lulz  I was an enormous /b/ shitter newfag in 2007      What generation are we living in now?    Its been long since I've seen this.    The moeshit fanservice generation    I KNOW I CAN KILL    Crunchyroll generation    Jojo Phantom Blood was so bad it was shitcanned and killed Jojo for good   Steel ball run is selling like shit, we barely get fucking scans  Fuck, Jojo is dead.    MY DRILL IS THE ONE WHO WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS ROW ROW FIGHT THE POWAH      L DIES    lol i was there so epic nigra lulz ftw      no nigra here boss     That's what I call them, or Crunchy Gen for short. This was discussed a while back on /cgl/. I name the generations the following:   Fansub gen (I've also called them Bootleg but I think Fansub is better)   Toonami gen   Jump gen   Crunchy gen           Toonami gen best gen     This was discussed a while back on /cgl/         Me too. I participated in the one year anniversary raid, but didn't officially became a newfag /b/ tard until the fall       holy shit ichigo's dad is a soul reaper!   I assume there's a Robotech Gen somewhere back there?   God damn, 2006-2009 really was the seventies of the internet.   haha simply epic blogspot, anon!.   Riddle me this, /a/. Why people like uninteresting, dull characters like this? I get it, tsundere was a mistake and people hate noisy girls. But this can't be the answer.   In more and more shitty mangos can you find this archetype of the negative character building where you have the A supergirl, who can do shit and have a personality type, B supergirl who can do other shit and have another personality type and so on...  and then you have the contrast blob; a big pile of FUCKING NOTHING, they goo. And the MC likes her, because she has a cunny. I'm so mad about this. Why do authors do this? Why do they make 5 Mary Sues and a Shitty Susan?      Fuck you, m8. You're a fucking pedophile.  Onodera a best.     Kill yourself    Nice response, pedo.    Betas like boring-ass girls because they relate to them.    Blow your brains out, you fucking retard     what I also don't get, how can people fawn over her, when the original didn't even had the character she was only introduced in the serialization.   And it's a huge mistake. Also they dumbed down the MC and left the heroine untouched. Harem settings corrupt everything. It'd have been a nice, straightforward story with only CHitoge but now it's all about shitty fanservice for Derafan otakushit,       Kosaki is shit. Chitoge is superior.       retarded tripfag can't look at poster count and just assumes everyone on /a/ is the same person    Just end your life you fucking attention whore. Did the lack of love you received from your parents result into you becoming a trip fag or did you just want to show everyone that you're retarded?      Wait for him to claim he's not avatarfagging while he posts an image with every reply.    I wanted to fuck that bitch pretty hard and mindbreak her into a cockslave    More like Shitoge, amirite?   Aw, poor baby. Look at how upset he is.       Plain and boring no personality deredere has always been the worst dere. Even hajidere is better and more interesting.    Everyone in Nisekoi is shit  Except Ruri       calls a tripfag out   l-look how mad he is!   You're not impressing anyone, just stop.       You Are (Not) Kevin-kun    Liking Kosaki Onodera    Even Lelouch has better taste than you.      Keep making your shit up, m8.     replying to an attention-whore who will keep a shitty thread alive for hours with his mental illness  Fucking retard.     Then why are you replying, you clearly want attention. Just admit it already, it's kind of pathetic honestly.    He's a Sayakfag in the cancerous Madoka generals too    This. There is nothing worse than deredere girls.    You're right, I should just let him continue being retarded.    How is it pathetic? I've been around here for over 4 years. Do you honestly think you're the first person to "crack the code".  It's more so pathetic that you truly think you're somehow better instead of loser who thinks he's smarter than everyone else.  Get wrecked, m8. Boring girls a best.        because beta nips can only handle bland doll charaters like onodera Rei     Bait  Chiwa isn't deredere like Onodera. She has a personality and bite to her. She's too spunky and competitive to be anything like Onodera.      I'm not even necessarily against deredere, but there's nothing to Dera's character, but that she can decorate food.    What a top quality thread, 10/10 Kill yourselves.     More like Shitoge, amirite?  its funny because you like the worst tsundere Louise      Why people like uninteresting, dull characters like this?    /a/ is mainly comprised of lonely spergs who are too ugly irl to get a gf, so instead of letting themselves get rejected by women over and over they just settle for cartoon girls since they cant reject them. it doesn't matter how poorly written the show or character is to these types of people, as long as the anime can provide them with cute grillz to ease their loneliness they will think it's a masterpiece. i call these types of people "shit eaters".       whole thread getting baited by a single tripfag   Stay mad his name isn't "anon"     Orange is genkidere. Get it right, shiteating Silverfag.   Normal girls are literally the best.   This is scarousing.    Chitoge is better, but Louise is good too, faggot. LN Louise is even great.    put your trip back on    Is she even relevant anymore? I stopped keeping up with the series.   Bset girl is Chiharu        Implying I only like Louise from ZnT.  And get the fuck off of it, m8. Louise a qt.    I'm too good to be here   or  Butthurt woman detected.   Not sure yet.            They're cute.   cunny  Kill yourself.        They sure are.     Maybe if you're a homosexual, faggot.    Ayumu had that one side plot with Hayate getting confessed to by a random minor character.   I'm gay tbh.   Literal perfection.   Because they represent that one girl they could never back when they used to be into 3D.   No one cares.    You do.   Here's the deal with liking so called "boring" girls and why people hate on them.  These girls are literally perfect. They don't have that stupid glaring character flaw that all other characters have nor are they perfect in every way like a Mary Sue. They are simply perfect for everything they do. They are what you expect the ideal girl to be like.  Pedophiles and women hate this. Pedophiles hate this because there's no such thing as a "boring" loli. They all fall into shitty character tropes and it offends them when they see a "boring" of age character. Women on the other hand are threatened because they know they'll never be as perfect as these 2D girls.        people will actually reply to this bait  You're a sad, pathetic attention-craving autist who wants a literal cardboard cutout to fuck.     Still replied.       Megumi    normal   A girl that ditches her family vacation on the other side of the country and gets back home to help the loser of a MC with a heroine act, dragging the other two haremettes with her can hardly be called normal.       No, she's exactly what a woman should be. She is perfect, bro.     She's just a girl in love.      Megumi is awful. Almost as bad as Onodera.     I'm just saying that she's far from being a normal girl. She has her own quirks and does things that a truly average and normal girl wouldn't do.    fuck off you goddamn stupid retard     Eririfag get out.     Explain further.    Nuh-uh, you big stinky poo-poo head!   The "pure Japanese waifu" is a popular archetype. That's literally all she is. The girls in Nisekoi are pretty flat in general, and Onodera is just the best waifu material out of the cast. Her sister is pretty cute though.     dont call me that    Megumi is a literal goddess. Kill yourself.      literally perfect   Onodera in the post:   borderline retarded   although the MC loves me and I (should) know that, I better cuck myself   I have no talents whatsoever   I have no personality whatsoever   doushio, Ruri-chan, please people let my cling to you since I can't do anything on my own               A personality is something that can be formed over time. Besides that, wouldn't you rather have a woman who is easy to read and please?     Yamato nadeshiko    Nisekoi is just a collection of lazy attempts to blindly follow archetypes, it shouldn't represent any of them in any significant way    I should have known that term. I never bothered to look it up.    There are people right now who likes dull deredere  Literally why. Might as well waifu a rock.    boring characters   in nisekoi  Wow who would've fucking guessed. Trash series trash characters.     It's not really that obvious he likes her due to the fact that he's still (fake) dating another girl. The simple fact is that he should notice that she likes him not the other way around.  Her talent is the ability to make sweets look good, not taste good. She also has a soothing voice and feeling.  She has a personality. She's kind of shy and she tries really hard, but she's also very easy to please. Giving her phone number to a guy is good enough for her and she's not rushing to get fucked in the backseat of a Buick like all the girls you like.   It's an amazing thing.           Kosaki isn't a vindictive bitch. She's better than Megumi.    Its cute. That's all it is but I love excessively dere characters. It would get boring after awhile though. Genki is best archetype.      I think Megumi being a little vindictive isn't so bad.    She bounces off the other characters in the cast and ends up having the most presence in the group, ironically going against the initial 'lack of presence' gags about her. She's just subtle. The other girls being extremely archetypical and cartoonish help in create a stark contrast as well.   There's nothing wrong with deredere girls. Onodera is a bad example though.   Eririfags are really bad at baiting.     cute   friendly demeanor   not a slut   shy but tries her hardest and things happen  I don't think you know what dull means.  You're the type to say Vanilla is plain when it's the best and most flavourful ice cream.            Only Eririfags can hate boring and dull dereshit  Megumifags are seriously bad.       Only an Eririfag could hate Megumi.     Only Eririfags hare enough shit taste to hate her, yes. The sun is hot too.     Megumifags think she loves Aki   Reminder that her feelings for him aren't romantic.

They're practically a married couple by Volume 8.      Proving my point. Awesome.

I always assumed the clothe was part of the guy's shirt, it's the same color      I'm more bothered by the fact that we still don't have a proper, uncensored release of the Dragon Ball manga in English.         100 times better than black bar/fog censoring that is becoming popular.       I don't understand what is being censored     stop or i'll activate the spring to bonk him on the head    Where's the Zabuza on the floating handle. Come on guys.      at least it made sense. a chef shouldn't fucking smoke. Thats probably the least horrible censor that 4kids did.    Show me one canon scene in which Sanji has smoked while cooking.     Show me at least 20 scenes where he hasn't.     i mean in the sense that it ruins your taste buds.    Terraformars was shit, and that scene made me drop the manga completely because I realized what kind of series it was: lets job every fucking character to the nhojs to hype them up then run out of ideas.   that racist    The entirety of Tokyo Ghoul TV or Netflix.   kek    This can't be real...     It's funny because neither version is realistic.      I don't really mind her censorship. It only looks ridiculous in frames like this, and she's already an adorable busty fetish magnet even without the cleavage. I bet boys are discovering their weewees even with the edit.

The heart is actually surrounded by a membrane which partitions it off from the rest of the human body. Most organs have it. I like to think Togashi knows a bit of anatomy and the bag is that membrane.   Is Rebellion better than original Madoka?   TV: 7 Rebellion: 6      "Rebelion" and "original Madoka" are from the same whole. Rebellion isn't better than original Madoka, It's necessary.    No, but it was better than I was ecxpecting.   Yes    I would say yes.   homu:10/10  It's the best answer to the series's depressing ending.   Yes    nah it's worse. Too much meta powerlevel wank   so there will be any new series, ova, movies? or madoka is kill?  tfw the game will never get localized       Is Rebellion better than original Madoka?   Better or not, Rebellion is indisputable magnum opus of Gen and a piece of art.      HOMURA GIVE ME MORE HOMURA!   perfection   If season 2 isn't SoL written by Ume I'd rather there not be anything at all.   I really hope you've got both of them to support Shaft and PMMM crew.    No. In the first place, Urobuchi has outright stated in interviews that he didn't want to do Rebellion and that he thought Madoka was totally complete with its anime series (and anyone who says Madoka had a depressing ending is a fool). If you've read other works of his, he actually talks about themes central to Madoka every so often (F/Z Vol. 1's postface, for example) years before it was being planned and, in many ways, it's noticeable how he was finally able to start writing relatively happy endings after concluding Madoka. Shinbo coerced him into writing Rebellion by saying if he wasn't on board, they'd get someone else anyway, so he might as well. He generally seems so-so about the affair, thinking it turned out well, but it is what it is and he doesn't seem incredibly proud of it.   What it is amounts to what could have been a mindless cash-in and in some ways was treated as such, but is in fact a product with a lot of thought and effort put into it. This in no way means it's perfect, as there are various factors which diverge from the original anime, while pandering and fanservice (not necessarily of the titillating sort) abound.  Rebellion's first 45 minutes drag on too long, having too many pointless or prolonged scenes to drill in a point which could have been grasped in 20 (and almost certainly would have had Rebellion had been released as a series as opposed to a movie). Homura's feelings about her situation (she was content at the end of the anime) are basically retconned to accommodate the new narrative direction. The fight between Homura and Mami is flimsily justified and rather OOC for both of them (this is commented on quite a lot), basically just a somewhat poor excuse to have a cool fight between the two.  (cont)            Bebe is an absolutely pointless character in every way that didn't really need to exist, her every contribution being something Sayaka could have fulfilled on her own; she really only exists to pander, since Charlotte is so well-liked amongst fans. Speaking of Sayaka, her character is definitely altered to allow for shoujo ai subtext between her and Kyouko, something the original anime very much rejected in their interactions. All over the place, the personalities of characters are subtly altered to reflect the fanbase's memetic portrayal of them rather than how they actually were in the original series.  On the other hand, Rebellion's animation is absolutely superb, it has excellent symbolism, its themes are very concrete and in-line with what is typical of Urobuchi, and the plot honestly isn't bad at all in spite of aforementioned pandering. Homura skyrocketed to be my favorite puella by the end when I previously felt lukewarm about her. So, while Rebellion definitely has problems and the original anime certainly didn't need it at all, in a vacuum it is undeniably very good. Unfortunately for it, being a sequel, it really can't exist without the original work to establish it and its failures as a continuation of the plot have to be considered. That in mind, I can't in good conscience call it as good as the original series, which Urobuchi desperately wished to create and thus poured his heart and soul into. But is it a proper successor to the original anime's legacy? I would actually say yes. Although it is imperfect and unneeded, few if any stories are flawless and just because something isn't necessary doesn't mean it can't contribute to the whole.  Also, Homura did nothing wrong.          Also, Homura did nothing wrong.  Except being a bitch like Sayaka.      Hilariously, Sayaka was my favorite puella before Homura beat her out in Rebellion.   Her misery made by dick rock hard.       Reminder that ribbons &gt; time   The real tragedy is no sequel to Grief Syndrome    They're both great.      Whether Urobuchi wanted to do it or not, and what he thought of it don't actually have any bearing on the quality of the movie    Hey, Apple.    Hi. I gotta stop communicating with the dead.    But you're dead yourself.    No, I revived.    spoopy    That must have taken a lot of grief seeds.    Yes.    So how do you plan on making it up to Kyouko?   I think it's better because unraveling the finer points of the plot and motivations is something you have to do yourself, rather than having it told to you. It's more rewarding when you have to think and engage yourself to assemble all the pieces presented.    Mm, that wasn't the main thing I was trying to illustrate by mentioning that. Mostly, I wanted to note that Rebellion fundamentally wasn't necessary and Urobuchi felt Madoka was definitively finished. While I agree Urobuchi's stance on the project doesn't have any direct bearing on its quality, what it does do is reflect on how certain elements of the movie were handled that DO result in a lesser product. Rebellion was created not because Urobuchi had new ideas for the direction of the series, but because Shinbo and SHAFT saw an opportunity and decided to take it with or without the original writer. The mentality of Urobuchi and SHAFT here gives context to why the movie approaches things a certain way even though they damage its quality overall.     It completed Homura's arc fantastically. There is the issue that it could be a retcon of how Homura felt at the end of the series, but we don't know exactly what happened between the series ending and Rebellion. Could be that Homura was in denial, putting on a front (unlikely), or just didn't realize the severity of her emotional problems just yet. Even if it was a retcon, it was far more faithful to Homura's character than her quick acceptance of the circumstances at the end of the anime.  Also I think that the stuff that people like this homie   complain about like Charlotte and Sayaka/Kyouko actually weren't too unfaithful to the series. Charlotte was kind of necessary as a plot device and to make Homura/the viewer a little confused/uncomfortable. And with hindsight (which she has a lot of time for, being dead and all), it makes sense that Sayaka would recognize she could have been happy if she'd gotten closer with Kyouko and accepted her help. Rebellion was her short opportunity to live that out.      What better to make Kyouko happy than to satisfy her  hunger  needs? I'll take her  to an all you can eat buffet  around town.    I dislike how the film hesitated near the ending by having Madoka almost come back so that they can have an easy sequel hook if they ever need one. Is there even a good reason for it to happen?    Shinbo coerced him into writing Rebellion by saying if he wasn't on board, they'd get someone else anyway, so he might as well   Source on this?     Rebellion's animation is absolutely superb   The film might be pretty, but it is not due to the animation. By itself it is functional and far from bad, but at the same time nothing special.     and Urobuchi felt Madoka was definitively finished   If I'm not mistaken the closest he ever said to something of the sort was when he commented on the lack of a sequel hook in the episode 12 ending and how he had to work a bit harder to circumvent this while working on Rebellion.   Or is this related to the 'Rebellion is a sequel to the recap movies' thing? Was it even Urobuchi who said this, or was it Shimbo?                       That's wise.     I dislike how the film hesitated near the ending by having Madoka almost come back so that they can have an easy sequel hook if they ever need one. Is there even a good reason for it to happen?   It actually happens in the opposite way. Remember when Homura tells Sayaka that the more time she spends in her new world, the more natural it will feel for her? If it goes the same for Madoka - and it should - then it makes sense that she would be at her hardest to keep in place very early on in the Homuverse timescale - soon after its inception. As time passes and Homura successfully maintains Madoka contained, the better Madoka will be able to blend in with her surroundings. Given how this was the reason for her to almost regain her Madokami consciousness, it would thus lead to an easier time for Homura.      Indeed. Seeing her happy makes me happy.    That's a rather good point that I will keep in mind for when I rewatch it. Guess there goes my major complaint about the movie.    Doesn't take much for Kyouko to be happy. That's lucky in a way.     While I do like some of the spinoffs, in general it's lower quality than the original and doesn't really offer much but 'play as ur fav madoka' or 'let's follow some other girl in the same universe who is less interesting but don't you want more stuff in Madoka style?'  Rebellion was complete shit.  Madoka never loved Homura and will be satisfied making her suffer and die alone. Think about how awful a character Homura is and how much she ruined for shallow selfish reasons. Everyone will love her being gone. Fuck her, the crazy slut.     And no matter what, always seeing her happy is best. Now if only I can stop her late night screams.     if only I can stop her late night screams.  Maybe be a bit gentler.     It takes a lot actually, and the cost is for the ideals she had as a child to prevail. Either through Sayaka not dying a horrible death, or her wish to not destroy her family.  Turns out the first was made possible through two different girls rewriting the universe, admittedly with other/greater goals in mind for their actions.    There is the issue that it could be a retcon of how Homura felt at the end of the series   Does it really? I have never understood how people say this when she was shown to abandon every acquaintance she ever had to go fight wraiths for no reason in some desertic place stated to be far away from Japan. Well, for no reason other than the new promise she made in literally the last scene before the epilogue; said promise hanging on the duty she felt she still had to Madoka, now that Madoka was fighting for her and for everyone.          A lot of it was a shameless pandering cashcow which is to be expected of Shinbo. Like, I can't even stress how fucking pandering this movie was.  lets give Mami GIGANTIC tits and focus on them a lot because people meme'd about them so much!   lets give Mami Charlotte as partner because people meme'd about the pairing!   lets add copious amounts of SayaKyou because shiteating retards love this shit tier pairing so much! lul dey canon now cause they held hands xD   et cetera  Still the conclusion to Homura's arc was pretty dope. She basically saved the universe, made everyone happy, and people are pissed off about it anyway because irrational MUH FREEDUMBS shit. The "controversy" was basically just baited by the spoopy imagery and Homura calling herself a devil, but objectively nothing bad happened.  I really liked the open ending that left things ambiguous, "is this world really fine like this?" is probably the closest thing to a good ending you could get. Of course, that won't stop $hinbo from making some sort of sequel. I have little doubt that it will happen eventually. He'll make his waifu Slutyaka the protagonist for sure and since Gen is gone it's probably going to be a huge clusterfuck and make people mad, like Rebuild of Evangelion. That's what you get for being faggots.                but objectively nothing bad happened  She had to actively give up eternal life alongside Madoka to achieve all this.  Also, she had to actively make some people forget things for them to be able to live in her new world. With Madoka it just happened without a hitch... With Homura being the exception, but a convenient one at that since she wanted to remember her past struggle for Madoka anyway.       She killed off Madoka's heaven, doomed the universe, brainwashed everyone, made them dead and miserable inside, Madoka canonically despises her, and Madoka is more miserable than ever before.  They were better off dead. Madoka will enjoy killing her.      Huh? No, I mean her dreams.    Writer Gen Urobuchi stated in the planning stages of Rebellion his idea was to end the film with Homura being taken away with Madoka to the Heavens. “I thought the story would end this time for real!” he laughs. However, the producer and director insisted the story should continue, leaving Urobuchi with little choice. “I really feel that Madoka doesn’t just belong to me anymore” Urobuchi says. It was the director who suggested the upcoming twist.  Found on a random website. How true is this shit?     He'll make his waifu Slutyaka the protagonist for sure  I recall some interview available at the time this film still was a hot topic that the Butcher actually talked about this in detail and pointed to the possibility of this being in the possible sequel.  Did all this get discarded? I mean, following it he never touched the topic again, though I'm not too sure about what order were these thoughts from him actually made/published. Did he just give up because there just was no room for something of the sort?       Tell me about it.   Even if it was, it's not criticism of the film. How or why they got the ideas isn't important, only how good the ideas themselves are.       Welcome back.     random website  If you will take your time anyway, why not search the PMMM wiki for the presumably accurate, folded over a thousand times translations they might have?     Fake and gay. Just like your value as an individual.    It's true.   It'll be Madoka and everyone killing Homura. They'll remind her she was never important to them. Homura is cancer.         I still can't believe that happened.      Couldn't find links to the wiki by throwing parts of the quote at google. I'm just assuming it's accurate enough--that there was a conflict between the director and writer regarding Homura's choice near the end.    Still cannot believe these threads are extremely vaguely madoka related chatrooms    Just google PMMM wiki.    I still can't believe it's not butter.         Huh?  Come on, you know exactly what I was referring to.     Yes I do. I myself was referring to her dreams.    To a certain extent, yes, there was conflict. There has also been an interminable amount of shitposting about this - mostly casting the butcher as someone with artistic integrity, beaten down by THE MAN (shinbo) - to deride the film as a cash-in with no value. Thus, bringing it up only casts the dark shadow of past faggotry upon such a topic.   Why would that change?       Conflict? What I'm sure about was that Shimbo 'suggested' an alternative path - for Homura's and Madoka's interests to conflict in some way. According to Butcher all he did was to follow this suggestion; everything that followed afterwards was made by himself.  This happened pretty early on the development cycle, which puts it around sometime in middle to late 2011.          I know what the wiki is. Just couldn't find that quote so I wasn't certain if it was legit.  Shit, I wasn't aware of that. I watched the series a long time ago, but always hid Rebellion threads to avoid spoilers and only watched it recently to see what the hype was about.     This is literally how it went down:   Gen: Okay lets end it with Homura being taken to Yuri Valhalla   $hinbo: No, no, it must be an open end, I want to write more sequels in the future   Gen: Fuck... What the fuck do I write, then?   $hinbo: Why not make Madoka and Homura enemies?   Gen: Well if that's allowed then I got an idea   There's a reason the ending is open. It's because $hinbo LITERALLY ORDERED IT. See you in season two.            Dude they aren't gay. No one is but ambiguously Homura and she doesn't even love Madoka. Madoka never loved Homura.   Good night PHG and the rest. Sweet dreams.   Oh and should I call you Anonymous now?   What?       Rebellion is the high-budget low-intelligence version of original Madoka and if you like it you value fanservice over plot   Forgot to say that the exchange happened in the first place because Butcher was having issues writing down a story that ended with Homura being carried to Valhalla, didn't you?      Why on earth would this even be important? If it were a bad ending, you'd be able to just pick it apart rather than having to resort to painting the creators as bad artists.   Nah. We're still friends, silly.         Urobuchi character assassinated Homura and retconned her into the worst non character of all time as sequel bait when we know Madoka never loved her and the sequel will just be her ruining things even further until Madoka and her true friends murder her.     Why on earth would this even be important?   Because there will be a sequel and it will be terrible because Gen is gone and Shinbo is a terrible writer and moneygrubbing jew.         tfw Apple doesn't appreciate your jabs          Madoka never loved Homura. Stop insulting her character with this dumb shit.     It would be interesting to me for the same reason "director's cut" versions sell. People are curious about the director's vision unconstrained by editors. Likewise, they're curious about the writer's vision unconstrained by directors. I'm       fanservice   Wtf, the only thing that was fanservice was Homura's devil outfit.       happy demon hunting keiki funtimes are not fanservice      demon hunting is fanservice     Heh.    Ugly slut Madoka never loved.    Definitely is when nobody is dead, dying or depressed and there's a cute little song and Charlotte is their cute little mascot as if they're a legitimate magical team      It was Homura's degenerate mind playing with them like objects.     fanart is insulting   Canonfag.      Doesn't matter because it looks cute on the surface and the surface is the most important later when appealing to fans    Yes, yurishit of her with her mortal enemy is. Stop it.   Fanservice would be Homura not being character assassinated or showing Homura fuck her bald bulls on screen for a change.        Neither of those things follow from your comments about their creative process. To find out whether or not the fiction is inconsistent or sloppy, you look at the fiction. Anything else is silly sophistry from goofballs who are clamoring to find anything bad to say about the film because they dislike it for no good reason.     He shit on the series for potential profits. He and his shit tier waifu Homuwhore can go to hell.      Sounds like you have a stick up your ass to be unable to accept a lighthearted scene even if it was part of Homura's scenario. I know Madoka threads are pretty, extremely, irrevocably shitty but relax   I want to rape neo Homuhater and mindbreak him.    not ignoring them    i want to marry homu   Homura was treating everyone like toys, not people. She is shit, all she ever did was stalk and hurt others. That shouldn't be forgiven. Madoka never loved her because she was totally rotten to the core.   No homo.       It's just a dedicated troll that find his joy in hate speech on all forms against Homura. He is not even the original, he just picked up from where the previous one had left (a couple weeks gap, different posting styles).  A sad individual.      There's nothing wrong in him not being the original.    It wouldn't matter even if it's homo.    It's best to just ignore, don't post HomuMado to spite/bait them and they'll just fuck off somewhere else or get banned.    I ain't sad, I'm euphoric!   I am eternal. Not until Madoka kills Homura will I die.        2dank4me Also please stop samefagging.      Fuck you, and your waifu Madoka. You can both go to hell together for all I care.    Madoka isn't a fit waifu after what Homura did to her.    Oh, she is. Just wait 'til one of her classmates takes a liking to her. Cuckmura will be forced to watch it unfold while being unable to do a single thing since her motivation is Madoka's happiness.    Her motivation is control, but yes, she'll watch Madoka fuck a boy she loves and do nothing. Madoka's pussy full of semen will be enshrined in Homura's memory alongside the words I never loved you.   Series 9.3/10 Rebellen 9/10    Series 10/10 Rebullshit 0/10 Series after Rebullshit 1/10 Series after Madoka tells Homura she never loved her and kills her 11/10       Surprised to know you didn't hate Homu in series.   Remember me /a/ ? Remember when you had fun watching my show? You haven't forgotten about me have you?     I couldn't get past the fourth episode honestly.  It was just the same shit over and over. Boobs and boobs. I've been told I need to give it another shot... for years now I think...       We had a thread a few hours ago and one yesterday with 300+ posts, now fuck off    Well you should at least watch 5 since it's the best and prettiest episode in the show and were all the budget in the show went to.   I remember you. I just finished your show recently and loved it. Especially the part where  you and Mako were canon lesbians  and /a/ couldn't accept it.   unless you are a characters from a chinese browser game, yeah /a/ will forget you    i demand proof in the form of pictorial evidence     Also there's Mako imagining herself preparing a futon for the two of them but I can't find a picture of it     I wouldn't forget about you ever You were the Geassbowl of the 10's  I'll never forget those days       Mako might be, but Ryuko is a clothingsexual.    I won't forget but I had more fun with CA.    If you haven't enjoyed it yet you probably won't. The fan service doesn't go away, and if you didn't enjoy the comedy or fight scenes there's no point   Dropped it 8 episodes in. I remember I stopped watching shows like yours when I graduated from adult swim and ani-mondays on scifi channel.   What she and Senketsu have is platonic but Mako and her? Unless any memories of Disco Mom and Nui's rape pop up that relationship probably won't last long if Ryuko does go lesbian.   KlaK is good as far as silly anime that doesn't take itself too seriously, anyone who didn't like it probably expected too much from it.    Remember when you had fun watching my show?  hard to remember the first few episodes of a 26 episode series    do you want a Ragyo mom /a/?    do you want a Ragyo mom /a/?  No. There would be three outcomes for me. 1: Rape. 2: Death. 3: Villain backstory.        Kind of hard to forget when it's circlejerked everyday    What Ryuko and Senketsu have is all encompassing, Mako herself admits Senketsu is Ryuko's one true love (word for word), and backs him.   Mako=Tomoyo Ryuko=Sakura Senketsu=Syaoran        only if I get to be a cute young girl with a sentient sailor uniform as my best friend    Remember when you had fun watching my show?   had fun   the ebin ayylium knitting war animay   fun        fun watching Kill La Kill  That show was visual cancer.    Yes. It was  fun     This is part of the reason I don't bother with these threads anymore. You're always here. Sometimes reading these kind of posts is even worse than reading the clueless shitposts, greentext and usual hate the show gets.      I love Ryuuko   Why people still can't get that Ryuko and Senketsu were siblings?    oberstein pls you really need to unwind man    My Anon.   Why people still can't get that Ryuko and Senketsu were siblings?   MFW        I do dig boobs and I thought parts were funny. It just was the exact same joke/boob scene over and over. Were they even trying?      Why can't people get that Ryuko and Senketsu's relationship doesn't have any one label, since it's supposed to be beyond human relationships   FTFY        i ejaculate into a jar of marmalade   we now share the DNA material   he's my son   I don't think so.         Ryuko's DNA is spliced into Senketsu's, and Senketsu's threads are woven into Ryuko. They complete each other.    I certanly have forgotten about the fanbase, I would like to keep it that way.     and I ate from the jar before and after. We're one now.     Frankly, you only became popular for a while because everyone was curious about Imaishi and his brand new studio Trigger and the otakus were pissed off for Kyoani "betraying" them with Free    I haven't forgotten. And even when I do inevitably forget, I won't lose my way.    Nah.  I could never forget your sister.     Just watch Toonami.   You say that, but Senketsu always eats Ryuko when they henshin. And he's ducking her blood 24/7.     You haven't forgotten about me have you?  Never    it was fun until the fucking survival fight happened and we got that pink bitch and aliens     I could never forget a girl as cute as Ryuuko-chan.   Mako was clearly best girl of show.   Excuse me but if two people are DNA related then they are relatives.   Never!    Ryuuko reincarnated as a catgirl and became cutest of the season again  It's like poultry.       That took me a few seconds to get anon, and I had a mouthful of juice at the time. It didn't exactly shoot out my mouth, but I made an O shape with it in realization and now my keyboard is sticky.  No this isn't supposed to be an innuendo.      pretty good for a 3dpd tbh    It sounds like it, Anon.     Remember when you had fun watching my show?  I didn't really, though. I dropped this around ep 5 or so and have no regrets. I don't "hate" it, I get what it was trying to do, but it just ended up.. so disappointing.     I don't give a shit about you, but I can't get him out of my mind...   Yeah of course I remember you because every little faggot on this site keeps bringing you up  Matoi is sugoi  Whose wild ride did you like more. Ryukos or anges?  I'd be able to forget it if you faggots stopped making these threads.   Why are Power Girl's breasts so small?    Ange's. It helped a lot we could stick to one thread instead if irc-shitposting the whole fucking board.    Fuck you. Your sister on the other hand I'll never forget.    Judge the show not by the fandom, faggot.    I always fast-forward through your show instead of watching it because I can obviously see that you're doing it live, dumbass    Yeah I remember how the show got progressively worse until it became garbage    oh yeah, well I only watched like the first 10 or so episodes of the first version, but it looked like it was getting pretty good once they started doing it live. I don't know where it is now though    yes I remember you! Turn that frown upside down. I know just the thing to perk you up. Meet me in the bath for some more full purification. I know how much you love it. I love you little sis!    why does sad ryuko make me sad?      Shinji-D..dad who is this woman?!   Gendo-Hmm? Oh her..That's your new mother! Kuriyuin Raygo. By the way your last name is Kiryuin now.    Shinji-WAT?!   Gendo- anyway i'll leave you two to get to know each other, i got science shit to do    Ragyo-BATH TIME!    Shinji- Mommy, NO!!!    Blumenkranz intensifies               Epic post! Upvoted!    Ragyo wouldn't go for a man, let alone a spineless boy She's only into strong women who are also directly related to her     Never. Ryuko is still the best girl in the entire universe (not just anime).  And her sister is still the worst cancer in the entire universe, liked only by subhuman Betas from /v/.      Satsuke would make a fine in law         I'm sorry if I come off as shitposting or something. I'm genuinely not a yurifag usually, but I was delighted that the pairing happened at the end of the show. It felt fresh and different.     She would make a fine trophy wife for Takarada, or a fine corpse for the maggots to feast on.     She would make a fine trophy wife for Takarada,  Hates his guts.  or a fine corpse for the maggots to feast on.  Where is that coming from?       But it didn't happen. And you are just a shitposter.    No, it was shit and the shitpost was bothersome.     Hates his guts.  He is the only man interested in that ugly cunt other than the jobless mohawk loser from Nudist Beach whose name I can't even remember because he was so unimportant.        He is the only man interested in that ugly cunt other than the jobless mohawk loser from Nudist Beach whose name I can't even remember because he was so unimportant.  I can think of someone that could suit her better than Takarada. And to me it seemed more like he just wanted to get under her skin.      which sento would you sento?     The softest    why is Koboli pulling her skirt down when her normal outfit shows her crotch?   S2 or riot.   RIOT   Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  http://www.zero-tsukaima.com/        What is character development  Animation studio had nothing to do with it. Author just wrote a complete perma PMS bitch at the start and over the course of each volume she got less and less bitchy and actually embraced her feelings for MC instead of still being a bitch and going "i-it's not like I like you or anything, b-baka!" This is how you do Tsundere. Sure she started really out there but that Dere was fucking worth it.        FIRST KISS kara hajimaru futari no koi no HISTORY  This series forever will have a special place in my heart      Yeah but then turned to trash at the end when both Louise and Saito do frequent complete character swaps and ruin their relationship for the sake of drama.    Although not much can be said about saito who only had marginal character improvement. He is still cruel to Louise by not straight out rejecting the other girls.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Rasengan/Chidori Mix - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127178584#p127178584">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   Naruto's "Because I got to watch you grow up as your father" line in the trailer reminds me of this.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5JA<wbr>HAFvcr2o</wbr>  [ ]     Which makes me wonder. What if Salad and Boruto got married? I mean, Salad does have Uzumaki ancestry and so does Boruto. Since Naruto and Karin are cousins, then what does that make Boruto and Salad?    That was objectively the second best Rocky move after Rocky IV    distant cousins.   They are further apart than the Uchihas marrying uchihas or the Hyuugas marrying Hyuugas  Also you have to remember in Japan they aren't as crazy about cousins fucking like the US are.        Naruto considers Iruka as an older brother and father.   You could say an uncle.    You won't get anywhere with putting a tag on it since Naruto doesn't have any idea about families. He's just precious to him.        How do Zerofags exist? I don't get it. It boggles the mind. Every fight in Zero feels like something from Naruto (He caught his sword and used it to deflect the other one!), and the plot is like a less mature version of Fate but with Heaven's Feel for an ending. This is ignoring that Zero is full of shitty CGI.  Even after Ufotable decided to remake UBW into the same sort of adaptation as Fate/Zero, Zerofags manage to actually bitch about UBW and how it isn't as "smart" or "mature" as their shitty spinoff.      Urobutcher edgy shit  Like when Gil cut Ilya's eyes, watched her cry and wander around blind, and then tore her heart out?     In comparison to Ryuunosuke's crap he did with all those kids, that's extremely tame.    except illya eyes can bind person fucking secondary  also funny faggots complaining about sex scene in FSN but forget that FZ had also sex scenes:  maiya got rape sakura wormrape kerry and maiya kerry mother sucks his semen (she is half succubus) Waver and Rider Kariya and Berserker yeah and kerry also is pedophile because irisviel is 8 year old              It's starting     Iri  He banged Iri while she was under that age. We should take Iri's age &amp; subtract Ilya's age from it.  Will S4 come out before the Tsukihime remake?      I didn't know this anime existed until today, I watched the first 6 episodes and it's bretty gud so far. Has anyone else seen this or have I been living under a rock? It only has 13 episodes so I'll probably finish it tomorrow.   Are you on your period or something? Do you scream loudly at your bar of soap when you drop it in the shower?     No worries. Take some smug anime faces it's their greatest weakness     Naw, you are just an easy target to take a piss on, hulkamania is running wild on you brother.    goddamn, well I can't even be mad because Steins;Gate is that greatness     w-when you discuss animu you are watching and make a thread you have to follow these set of rules because...reasons?  Oh, okay. But I'm only finding your posts amusing, I don't mind if you continue "pissing" on me since I'm enjoying your weeb autism.    Yet another MonMusu thread.    worse handwriting than suu   Fucking impossible, that bitch can grow to the size of an apartment building, but can't hold a pen straight.      Suu can make fully functional thumbs. Papi can't.      given how many new side characters there are I don't think you can.   Please be Spider or Snake        getting this fucking angry over genderswap  chill out    So when is there going to be an update with modern animation and extended fight scenes?   modern animation and extended fight scenes   Why do you want a CG Gurren Lagann remake with filler?     I wouldn't call extended fights filler, and I just meant cleaner/more animation. Something like DBZ kai     modern   Are you fucking kidding me.   </blockquote>]
