This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

I ignored this thread for a bit because shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Names in the credits were for the $300 tier backers. Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting. This is hilarious.</br>  <br>Yeah. It was a backer listed in the credits.</br>  <br>BASED<br><br>10/10</br></br></br>  <br> We Gurren Lagann now <br><br>I'm okay with this</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't realize she had long hair.

I hope LWA3 makes them canon.  <br>When they make another Kickstarter.<br><br>Would you guys back it all over again? I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception. It actually stands for God.<br><br>Source: I'm a gangster.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't ship them, but I do like seeing them being friendly.<br><br>LWA2 gave me just enough of that to prevent a riot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko x Sucy &gt; Akko x Diana<br>Look into your heart, you know it to be true</br></br>  <br>Not like I've got a better way to spend a hundred bucks right now. (cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

Waited so long that I had pretty much forgot about it.</br></br></br>   Sticky <br><br>More Amanda now please</br></br>  HORRIBLESUBS SAVING THE DAY   not saving it for halloween   <br> Also I didn't even know the second ep had come out. <br>there were threads about it for weeks how did you not notice?</br></br>  I honesty thought the fat girl was going to go apeshit when people steal her snacks.  <br><br>Neat. At least that solves the font issue.</br></br>  <br>It makes me happy that this faggot typed all this inane bullshit out and didn't even get a reply. Hope he killed himself.</br>    WE STICKY NOW  Which tiers are the various witches in?  <br>Can't wait for the fanart of catsuit Amanda.</br>  Can we all agree that this was as delightful, if not even more, than the original?<br><br>Can we put the cynicism aside for this one?</br></br>  HORRIBLESUBS!!!  <br>Perfection</br>  <br>I love how they didn't make the characters stereotypical in all respects. A sharing fat girl who is cute, the cocky tomboyish girl who isn't a bitch, and the short helpful mechanic.</br>  <br> I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb <br>thats kind of the point for her</br></br>  <br> Two left feet </br>  <br>All S tier<br>Fat-chan is in A tier.</br></br>  <br>YABBA DABBA DOO</br>  <br>Gurl's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.</br>   Donated but didn't see my name in credits <br> Scanned through multiple times just to make sure I didn't miss it <br><br>Oh....o-okay.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris). The orchestral score was performed by the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra. Pretty neat.   Vimeo <br> an hour long <br> only 550mb  <br><br>Fuck this, I'll torrent it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything with 5 a's?</br>  <br>Torrent is a rip from vimeo, though.</br>  <br><br>Even 24min could if they throw money at it.<br><br>Look at Wizard Barristers; I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/?

He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different.

You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

It's easy to spot stuff that's ripping off 90s Glen Keane-core Disney (John K calls it "Cal Arts style") and LWA is not even fucking close.<br><br>It's not like they even attempted and failed, the two styles are worlds apart.</br></br></br></br>  <br> LWA The Chalice of Flames <br>Akko is mistakenly entered into an inter-school witches tournament and must battle other witches to the death.</br></br>  <br>that fucking kamina smile</br>  <br>Busterbeam stop.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about? LWA2 had an upskirt butt shot with NO panies. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;7570485 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just puffy clothes.</br>  <br>Did you forget about me?</br>  claimed  <br>Brad Bird will save western hand-drawn animation, I hope.</br>  I never watched the first one and I think KLK is mediocre.<br><br>Should I try it just for the lolis?</br></br>  <br> and "furry" is not a sexual orientation. </br>  <br>Westaboos<br><br><br>Probably</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can watch cute girls do cute things for hours. Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it.

When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy.

You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

They would have that unmistakable sweaty, musky butt smell; but each rear would have its own unique characteristic that makes them all worth sniffing.</br>  <br>That's because they already have Precure (for the bigfriends) and Kamen Rider (for lonely housewives).

The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  <br>A common mexican name.</br>  If I'm a backer, where can I watch this without torrenting?<br><br>Haven't gotten any emails nor am I seeing anything on the Kickstarter site.</br></br>  <br>ok premise if they had a tv show</br>  Holy shit Akko almost made this unbearable to watch.

When you watch the first episode it becomes clear that the dresses are not designed that way.</br>  <br>It's not. You can actually see her bare butt in the episode if you happen to pause it at just the right moment.</br>  <br>Exactly when?</br>  <br>Sensory overload. <br>The wand represents my penis.</br></br>  I just naturally assumed that their school uniforms have some sort of censorship enchantment on them to prevent upskirts and panty shots  <br>A Little Witch Academia without "The Void" it's simply not Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>33:55<br><br>It's near the start of the parade, when Akko is dancing with the brooms.</br></br></br>  <br>That image is fanart.</br>      <br>Literally everyone leaves to go jerk off to Akko's ass. <br><br>Wasn't it from the trigger art book?</br></br></br>  Will Akko ever find out Ursula-sensei is her beloved Shiny Chariot?  Will they have sex?   <br>Akko is a lewd girl that likes to flaunt her booty around.</br>  <br>I bet the third movie will be about Shiny Chariot's backstory and Akko and Diana will finally see eye-to-eye in something.</br>  does anyone have a pic of the scene where Amanda does the broom dance and you can can briefly see her ass? Also, I hope this is popular enough to get made into a series    Was there color turn arounds for all the characters?<br>I need references badly.</br>  Is it me or is Diana kinda obsessed with Akko?  <br>if you look carefully, it becomes obvious that she is wearing panties</br>  <br>its you</br>  <br>Excuse the quality face.</br>  We need a TV series of this so we have more material to scour for loli witch asses.  Is Diana still voiced by the girl who voices Rias Gremory?  Best fucking $110 I ever spent. Thank you based Trigger.  Oh God, I'm super-duper excited and really want to watch it right now, but I'm dead tired.  So this isn't the BDs?    <br>is you</br>  if they are not going to do another kickstarter will they at least sell merch so I can throw money at them that way?  <br>ESPURR!<br>She reminds me of an Espurr. God, it's been bugging me since I watched it.</br></br>    <br>never ceases to amuse me</br>  <br>Yes, Yoko Hikasa.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would really love some LWA merch. I already bought the LWA1 BD off of Trigger's store, but it's not enough.</br>      Nendroid Petite LWA pack with Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Amanda, Constanze and secret Yasumineka.  <br>BEST</br>    <br>I want it!</br>      <br>Thanks nigga.</br>  <br>I want it. I want GSC to make some LWA nendos.</br>      Akko was kind of bitchy in part 2 but it's okay to have a bad day sometimes. <br>I still love you, girl.</br>    <br> that iMac on the left </br>  <br>That does make sense, as much as I don't like petites.<br><br>Gimme a Sucy scale with mushroom base.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't that bad. She got a little grating when she was being selfish about the whole parade, but she's a teenage girl and she's passionate. It happens.</br>  i want to have a ride on sensei's shiny chariot  <br>I still think they could have toned her down a bit</br>  <br>This. In the first half, it seemed almost out of character (compared to the first installment).</br>  The last moments of the episode just screamed Ooshima Michiru's work, so I wasn't surprised when I saw her name on the credits. Based Michiru, making the best soundtracks ever since SnW.   tfw I almost backed the kickstarter but an anon convinced me not to, because the business model was bad for the animation industry or something <br><br>Why was I so stupid</br></br>  <br>the one that did that folk music?</br>  <br>I wasn't able to back it because I had no money at the time. I would have gladly thrown dosh at the kickstarter for all the cool stuff if I had been able to.<br><br>Guess I'll just wait for the BD to be put up for sale.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was it stupid?<br>You got it for free.</br></br>  <br> folk music <br>What? All I know from Ooshima are these big orchestral stuff like you hear in Sora no Woto or LWA.</br></br>  <br>so what percentage of that outfit is life fibers</br>  The cutest witch.  I'm watching Enchanted parade right now. This stuff is Studio Ghibli tier in terms of story telling and near studio Ghibli tier in terms of animation.  <br>I want her to teach me how to dance.</br>  <br>So it's a convoluted mess that looks pretty?</br>  So, if they do a Kickstarter for Little Witch Academia 3, would you donate?<br><br>Assuming similar stretch goals and reward tiers, how much would you donate next time compared to what you donated this time?</br></br>  <br>She did apologize.</br>  <br>I would donate about $50</br>  <br>that fucking gif</br>  <br>I wouldn't go so far in terms of story telling, but I love the art style and it's very refreshing. Characters are also very varied and powerful. I was pleasantly surprised with everything in general. Would donate again for sure.</br>  I want her to tie me down with magic while she   insults my dick and then proceeds to rape me   Was it worth the money you put in?  <br>now that i have some money i will donate!!</br>  <br>Exceeded my expectations. <br>they should have focused on doing a series out of that instead of doing kill la kill imo. This has great potential to become a great series. A shame.</br></br>  I didn't know about this till today, the sticky made me curious and well, it was pretty good, even being that short the story and his little world envelops you, you really care for the characters even when you barely know them, I had a really good time. Is there going to be a full series about it? I would like to see that, all this have lots of potential for more.<br> Sucy best girl! </br>  <br><br><br>I was half reminded of Flash Dance with her routine and was expecting a bucket of water to be dumped on her at the end.</br></br></br>  <br>My nigro.<br>Sucy and Amanda, best girls by far.</br></br>  <br><br>My brothers!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br>I know that Luna means moon in latin, but what is Lana supposed to mean?

Do all artists have shit taste?</br>  <br>This is why trigger is one of my favorite.<br><br>They go off-model all of the time, and aren't afraid to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd donate at least $50.</br>  <br><br> That old ass witch going wands akimbo </br></br>  <br>Stuck up bitches are a turn-off for me personally. Speaking as an artist. </br>  <br>I have faith about they'll make a full serie of this.<br>It was said two or three days ago that Trigger anounced a new anime original, maybe it's LWA.<br>Even if they don't make it we'll still have the Inferno Cop X LWA.</br></br></br>  <br>Lana is wool in italian and spanish, but I doubt it has any relation to it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br> not wanting Sucy's upside-down isosceles triangle body </br>  <br>Same here bro. I didn't know about this series until today either and i was completely drawn in.</br>  <br>Probably enough to get my name in the credits.</br>  <br> Yoshinari will never do a spinoff for his favorite LWA, Diana <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised there were people that haven't seen this yet.</br>  <br>That would be the best news in years. It has enough elements to become a very rich series with lots of stories. It could become an improved version of Shitty Potter.</br>  <br>good post<br><br><br>i commend</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br>  Trigger said that they're working on 3 original things; the next original TV series (some sort of serious-looking show that has Persona-like character designs) a shorter thing for USPTime and another original that is farther on. Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 but for now fixes and retakes for the BD and theatrical release.  My personal ranking:<br><br>Sucy = Amanda &gt; Diana &gt; Akko &gt; the rest</br></br>  <br>It was everything I wanted, but even better than I expected it. Well worth it. Looking forward to the BD and the tons of extras I get with it even more now.</br>  <br>Amanda stole my heart, but that's not particularly dangerous.</br>  <br>She would be part of the main story in a third sequel; this movie set-up the seeds for her and Akko finally teaming up.</br>    <br>I'd rather draw Sucy  or lotte </br>  WIPs.<br>http://i.imgur.com/A7q6j16.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/AjoNZv3.png<br><br>Maybe do more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 <br>Really? I thought he wasn't too jazzed about LWA. IIRC he wanted to do a psychological drama thing.</br></br>  <br>He said it's still not the perfect LWA for him.</br>  <br> lewds of the LWAs <br>For what purpose</br></br>    <br>Doing God's work. Needs more Amanda and overall broom action.</br>  <br><br>Well, if LWA 3 is the Parent's Day it could have all the drama he'd want.</br></br>  <br> More Constance please. </br>  <br>Will /a/ save anime again with LWA3?</br>  <br>Funded in 3 hours or less this time.</br>  <br>Would be funny if the anime industry's western-like studios caught up with Kickstarter's possibilities by watching LWA and started competing for attention with great projects.

Trigger's track record isn't bad (KLK was a massive hit, Inou Battle was lukewarm, Ninja Slayer is a meme show on Niconico) but LWA is under most elevens' radar, so they'll have to depend on the West again if they decide to do more.</br></br>  <br>I think she  grew up .</br>  Anyone else like how Sucy is drawn without arms until she uses them for something  <br>Oh shit, you're right.</br>  <br>I really appreciate you namefagging, it's much easier to hit the button every time.<br><br><br>She matured.

The studio focused on other projects on the side.</br>  <br><br>It was way less because they were working on KLK and other animation projects for most of that time.</br></br>  <br>Not that kind of "quality"</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/BX1H948USbI?t=16  [ ]<br><br>there are also items that cause meteor showers, elemental explosions, cause floods, and in general cause natural-disaster levels of damage. atelier may be comfy but it knows when to step it up.</br></br></br>  <br>LWA is a love-letter kind of project that they can only afford to do to the side while the horridly panderish stuff like kill la kill and their other lesser products are done by word of mouth.<br><br>Watch the documentary for LWA1.<br>LWA is a project that they actually wanted to do and not one that they needed to do for the sake of having company-welfare. They had newbies work on it even.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please, this god please.</br></br>  <br>You mean her one butler. Pause again.</br>  So /a/'s mods are Triggerfags?  Just finished watching the AotY. What a superb piece of work, and by TRIGGER no less...<br><br>I smiled, I almost cried, I was so engrossed in this OVA. <br><br>Stuff like this is why I watch anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>LWA is to Trigger as RSFWoH was to Gainax. <br><br>An all out in house production to showcase their technical abilities.</br></br></br>   know LWA3 won't be happening for at least another two years <br> already getting hype for it anyway <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>what's it referencing</br>  <br>KLK might have seemed panderish but knowing Imaishi it was definitely heartfelt. It wasn't intended to make lots of money and they had plenty of risks associated with it.</br>  <br> lwa sequel is out <br>well fuck</br></br>  <br>who did klk pander to ?</br>   project manager <br>Confirmed for anti-NEET anime</br>  <br>More like Daicon IV.<br>Honneamise was a theatrical movie. It was a flop of a movie, but it was still more of a commercial product than the showcase of raw talent that the Daicon shorts were.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck calls honneamaise as RSFWoH?</br>  <br>you wouldnt have given a shit about klk unless it had layers and layers of anime tiddy and all that pandering shit.<br><br>If they deployed the story in another handwriting that didnt involve some girl's ass or tits being on screen for 40% of any episode then you wouldnt have given a shit about it.</br></br></br>  <br>SJWs, normalfags, casuals, any buzzword that /a/ doesn't like this week.</br>  <br> Getting hype for show that wont come out for years. <br>It hurts just thinking about it.</br></br>  <br> GSC is the first logo we see <br> I hope you like figma </br></br>  <br>Newfags who think they need to abbreviate its full title.<br>Or NWTTNTAIFT.</br></br>  The music was too loud and too many scenes didn't have music at all. Felt kind of weird.  <br>Honestly, my opinion is that your style doesn't suite this show much at all. your anatomy is far too thick and muscly which is nothing like the film itself.</br>  <br>Royal space force sounds dumb<br>and i can't spell honeymayonnaise.</br></br>  <br>  Squid and shrimp on pizza <br>Why can't we get that at regular pizza places in the US?</br></br>  <br> too loud <br><br>Fuck meant "too low".</br></br></br>  <br>I liked KLK because it was a crazy, over-the-top parody of battle shonen with a vibrant cast of fun characters. I liked the anime breasts, but I liked them because they were comedic and made the experience even more ridiculous.</br>  Does anyone have the Inferno Cop/LWA crossover episode they showed?  KORE HA KUSO-ANIME DESU  <br>The sound itself was a little too loud.</br>  <br>Because it's disgusting.</br>  <br>Because there are many American faggots who would die if there's anything other than pepperoni on their Pizza. Hell, the best pizza I've ever had was in Normandy, had a ton of shit like potatoes and onions on it, but I haven't seen anywhere in America that would serve something like that. All we have here are the disgusting Chicago deep dish garbage.</br>  So as someone who didn't throw his shekels at the kickstarter, where can I get the blu rays of 1 and 2?  but where can i watch it  <br><br>I get a gut feeling that was whatever Imaishi wanted to do.</br></br>  <br>squid and shrimp are expensive</br>  <br>The annoying part is that even the non-chain pizza places in the US have pretty much the exact same menu as the chains. On the plus side, the chains are actually starting to branch out a bit. Pizza Hutt will put a balsamic vinegar reduction on your pizza now if you want and they even do white sauces.</br>  <br><br>Make her a mother bear-like character. Which she kind of already is.</br></br>  The whole thing was magical and I couldn't get the smile off my face the whole day. Worth every cent and I eagerly await more.  <br>The upside is that if you want to go out, you can find a decent wood fired place in pretty much any decent sized town, and they're likely to have decent specials on top of better options in general <br><br>So much of this acting like Murikka has shit food is just an ignorance of the options you have available</br></br></br>  <br> I eagerly await more <br>When asked about whether there would be a third LWA, the director said he hoped so. So nothing in the works yet.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I actually really like Papa Johns, I just wish that some more actual restaurants would branch out more with their pizzas. Even places that let you choose your own toppings don't have anything that you wouldn't find at any ordinary place.</br>  <br><br>not<br> you're gonna carry that luggage </br></br></br>  <br>my nigga that was the shit<br>as in it was shit</br></br>  <br>there's a will</br>  <br>First episode can still be bought from Trigger's online store: http://trigger-global.ecq.sc/lwa-bl<wbr>uray01.html<br><br>Second episode will probably be there as well when it is available.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A will without kikestarter money is useless. I doubt the sponsors would be willing to give them the money to do another 50 minute OVA either.</br>  <br> The music was too loud and too many scenes didn't have music at all. Felt kind of weird. <br>They haven't finished production yet, that might be why</br></br>  <br><br>inb4 Jeff Goldblum image</br></br>  <br>All we have here are the disgusting Chicago deep dish garbag. Found your problem.<br><br>not to say I don't appreciate non-traditional pizza (goat cheese and artichoke is some 10/10 shit). But I think pep pizza is pretty damn good as it is.</br></br></br>  This was so good.<br><br>There were a few cool references thrown in, too. <br><br>I hope Trigger makes this their next project after Ninja Slayer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Futafags need to be wiped out.</br>  <br>Will have to buy that when I get a bit more shekels.

They also worked on KLK and Sushio said in an interview that they weren't very good when they started, though a few of them did vastly improve. It depends on who's helming the project and how they drive the team. Yoshinari and Sushio are about the only artists at Trigger who can draw consistently well at a fast pace.</br></br>  Do the impossible.<br><br><br>I also liked the spirit bomb at the end.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Spats, thighs, intense blushing.</br></br>  <br> the spirit bomb <br>You meant the genki dama?</br></br>  <br><br>Well shit I didn't know that.

Akko is supposed to be a mediocre student after all.</br>  <br>I'm sure it was intentional, considering things like the note Lotte was reading was in flawless English. Akko also spelled Lotte's name "Rotte".</br>  <br>It seemed like the headmaster didn't give more than a cursory shit about that sham of a "parade" and just dumped it on them as a halfhearted punishment for being failures.</br>  Anyone else notice how early Lotte started working on the Shiny Chariot hat? You can see it in the corner.<br><br>It looks done in this image, but she still showed up late.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the parade is a pretty shitty gig and nobody would volunteer for that shit.

Stop crying like a little bitch that there are lots of people who enjoy what you dislike.</br>   <br>It sure is interesting going back in time and seeing some of this stickies. It's strange that they only count from 2012 forward when I am pretty sure Eksopl's original archive dates almost as much back as the /a/jp/ split. Shame we can't' see again things like the modcat sticky in 2009 or the CODE GEASS insanity of 2008.<br><br>The funniest thing is that when moot left he said that his decision was a year or two in the making, and exactly that much time earlier there was a surge in moot shitposting on /a/. Can't help but think that at the time he was trying to re-bond with /a/ and find reasons to keep on trucking, and we offered him none of it.</br></br></br>  <br> or the CODE GEASS insanity of 2008. <br>My biggest regret is not being on /a/ in 2008 for that. I've heard stories, but it just isn't the same.</br></br>  As soon as I can I need to watch this...<br><br><br>Liked this enough I saved it,then fiddled with it to make a wallpaper,and I'll share it:</br></br></br>  <br>Reddit love Trigger and Kill la Kill.<br><br><br>It's not just that I dislike it, Trigger generally produces garbage, which in turn, attracts hordes of idiots (like yourself) to /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Will we ever get doujins of Amanda?  ive never heard of this anime before, what about it warrants over 3,000 replies?  <br>I hope so.</br>  <br><br>I want my dick between her thighs now.</br></br>  <br> Trigger generally produces garbage <br>I wish what Trigger produced was garbage.<br>Anime as a whole would be amazing then.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a really fun and memorable watch you should check it out.</br>  this was good and i liked it <br><br>thanks for reading my opinion /a/ have a nice day</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should watch it and see for yourself, retard.</br>  <br>Here is your reply.</br>  Why is this garbage stickied  <br>It's like when Disney was good.</br>  I put in a few bucks, I suppose I may as well watch it.  <br> triggerfags this delusional <br>Having all their anime abide by "the rule of cool" trope, and being incapable of doing anything else just proves they're shit.</br></br>  <br>subscribed</br>  <br>To make retards angry.</br>  <br>I know a place in Boston that does just that. It's fantastic.</br>  <br>To piss you off.</br>  <br>So you haven't even watched this.<br>I hope this is stickied for another week.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>It's because the mods are triggerfags, and this summer's reddit horde has arrived for another season of crazy, wild trigger shenanigans!</br>  <br>If he were holding a wrench, Orange Star CO.</br>  <br>I don't think the time you wasted on /a/ is brag-worthy, but if you weren't here for Code Geass you haven't experienced true /a/.<br><br>It's a shame that it's basically impossible now for a show to unite the entire board under a single banner, even if you do have enough people interested in a single topic to dominate the board, like in the KLK ending, there will also be enough contrarians to make sure half the board is threads complaining about it. <br><br>Unless, of course, we go in a spam-happy mode like the one we engaged back when Haruhi S2 was announced, but that's also a long shot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Haruhi S2 <br><br>Oh man now I wish I had been on /a/ when KYON-KUN DENWA was happening, it must have been a riot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Get off my board nerds</br></br>  <br>And now we're here.</br>    <br>CG didn't really unite the board either. There were people who disliked the show, myself included, but it was a time when the board was much smaller, there were no catalogue, people didn't have a mentality of keeping it to one thread nor were the concept of "generals" even a thing back then, and threads didn't live for very long. As a result, the people who liked CG spammed their threads on all pages, just like what happened with TTGL.</br>  <br>Not him, but<br><br>Alas, the cancer /v/ and /r9k/ spilled onto the rest of the board has done its work.<br><br>People are just too obsessed with upkeeping the "mood" of 4chan up, they confuse the old elitism and absurdity with being a retard on purpose as a "joke" or projecting on the attitude of others.<br><br>I think Guilty Crown was close. Where the MC turned into Mag-"Fuck Hitler, I can do his job better"-neto for all of two episodes, but it wasn't nearly the storm CG was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a commendable sketch analysis.</br>  So many indignant tightwads hating Trigger these days. <br><br>I would hate to be that much of a faggot.</br></br>  <br>So, this is the "after" shot?</br>  <br>The suffering was real.  I ended up droppign it on the second episode of Endless 8 and never finished. Been enjoying Yuki-chan, though. </br>  <br>Don't let the shitposters make you loose your way anon.</br>  <br>B-butt, that's Lotte =(</br>  <br>Probably newfags who weren't even on /a/ when the original LWA aired as a part of the animation training project, long before KLK was even a thing.</br>  <br>There were colored versions of this!?!</br>  <br>It's on Vimeo?</br>  <br>  <br><br>Might as well post a small update.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice point.</br>  <br>More Sucy Akko please. Your work is great.</br>  <br> just like what happened with TTGL. <br><br>Not even remotely the same and you know that yourself. <br><br>TTGL /a/ made modern /v/ look like when Deathnote and Higurashi were /a/'s darlings, and the ex-Big Three could be posted with no irony. <br><br>CONSTANT CONTRARINESS, SAGEBOMB EVERYTHING WE DON'T LIKE, CUTE THINGS ARE SHIT EXCEPT NIA!<br><br>Lucky Star's main segment was bad, but the specific discussions about what was good about it were the only things I liked in the board at that time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just filing it under all the other shows without a S2/3/4</br>  <br>  ;_;  </br>  <br>unf</br>  <br>It's odd, even when intentional, since LOOK was spelled correctly. So not exactly a Japanese romanji error?</br>  <br><br>do you have a  tumblr  or somewhere you put your shit?</br></br>  <br>Sorry but no. It was exactly the same thing. The fans of both shows spammed threads for the sheer fun of seeing the pages flooded with threads. It was great fun if you were a fan of either show, but very obnoxious if you weren't. I'm guessing that as a fan of CG, you were probably blind to the other side of it all. After the second season of CG, in late 08 and throughout most of 09, meta threads were very popular, possibly triggered by increasing amounts of spammers, downtimes, and the like, people talked at length about whether or not the board was becoming irreversibly shit or not. And in those threads, you saw lots of people voicing unfavourable opinion about what happened to the board culture in the wake of very popular shows like CG or TTGL.</br>  <br> http://kyderdraw.tumblr.com </br>  <br>You can still find some stuff by searching.<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/974381<wbr>4<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/139597<wbr>27/#13959755<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/139599<wbr>93/#13960457<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/139708<wbr>59/#13970993<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/273207<wbr>82<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/312365<wbr>41</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  neat  Akko is a fucking cunt.<br><br>Needed more Sucy.</br></br>  Best girl<br><br>Old thread <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127612855 </br></br>  <br>Why is Piccolo stalking Gohan and Videl?</br>  subs fucking when  Just got home.

I don't think I'm nostalgiafagging when I say that it doesn't compare to any opening from previous series.

Am I alone in thinking that some of the best episodes throughout the Dragon Ball franchise were the random one off episodes that had nothing to do with the main story?<br><br>I really liked the early DBZ episode where little Gohan runs away from Piccolo's training and encounters the homeless kids who are trying to avoid government agents trying to take them to a home.<br><br>Or the episode where Goku and Piccolo learn to drive.<br><br>Even in Dragonball GT, the best episodes were the first arc where they're looking for the dragonballs throughout the universe, before the Baby bullshit kicks in.<br><br>Personally, I don't mind if there's a lot of filler thrown in everywhere. As someone who grew up with these characters, seeing the random episodes with the characters out of their element is fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Remember when random anime no one picked up would get anon speedsubs without anyone asking for them?<br>Hell, even stuff picked up got them.</br>  <br>My wish is that Dragonball Super is going to be 75% slice of life fun, 25% badass fights.</br>  <br>Everything is shit compared to Bruce Faulconer's stuff.</br>  The spanish subs are unsurprisingly shitty, in case you wondered.  <br>I like the early Buu episodes where Gohan goes to highschool and is a superhero, up to the tournament before they leave.</br>  <br>I remember back in 2005 when Eureka Seven came out, I often had to wait weeks at a time for a subbed episode to come out.<br><br>It didn't help that the original airing of the show had a clock in the corner that was really annoying. There was a group called Nanashi Subs that did a good job of removing the clock, but they were also the slowest subbers around. They didn't finish subbing E7 until a few months after it ended.<br><br>I'm sure this is all surprising for newer anime fans, especially given how Eureka Seven is a fairly well known show nowadays.</br></br></br></br></br>  where the fuck do the spanish sub groups post their shit  <br>People got too spoiled with HorribleSubs ripping CR, Funi and other streams.</br>  <br>One of the few times I enjoy knowing Spanish. <br><br>Usually it only helps in understanding Telenovelas, which are complete bullshit besides the hot women.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't.<br>They edit an annoying logo into it and post it in their stream sites with the shittiest encoding</br></br>  <br><br> Goku and Goten having fun <br> Mystic Gohan <br> golden SSJ forms <br><br>I like it better than the recent movies already.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't Funi simulcasting this show?  <br>Because they are assholes.<br>I hope CR picks it up for non-english speaking countries. They do that with One Piece here. At least that way I could watch a decent spanish translation.</br></br>  <br>Dub</br>  I hope this series guarantees us more DBZ doujins.  <br>Who really enjoys ATB?</br>  <br>Because Sabat and co. are lazy assholes who will get around to it when they feel like it</br>  Videl voice is making my dick to go even further beyond  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DJc<wbr>uDgVYjgI</wbr>  [ ]<br>BEST OPENING</br>  <br>They're an incompetent company. They never released the OVAs and specials either. This is the same company that makes such shit subs Anno won't let them release 3.33 because of it.</br>  <br>Seriously, even I've resorted almost exclusively to Horriblesubs the past few years. <br><br>I kind of miss the old days of subber wars. There used to be a group called Shinsen-subs that everyone hated, but they used to be quick and subbed a lot of stuff, so everyone begrudgingly downloaded their stuff. It was a running gag to complain about them while continuing to watch with their subtitles.</br></br></br>  <br>I do. <br>Turn based RPGs&gt;"Action" RPGs.<br>The combat in ARPGs is shallow as fuck most of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YgH<wbr>NtzxO0y8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>FFX was best Turn based combat<br>X-2 was best ATB</br></br>  Milk is best girl!  So Goku was a farmer he have to get money he have to have a job  <br> implying the Murican voice is any better </br>  <br> more like buushit </br>  <br>I remember when a show called Kurokami came out in 2009. It had a simulcast dub for some reason. I remember thinking back then that the days of simulcast subs and even dubs were right around the corner (and maybe even shows reanimated for English dubs; a key reason why dubs don't compare to subs is that the show isn't animated for different languages).<br><br>The simulcast subs part came true, which is enough for me. I still wish foreign companies had more influence on the original Japanese producers, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably just for food, seeing as Mr. Satan gave him a briefcase full of money I doubt he's in bad shape financially.</br>  <br>because their stoopid</br>  <br>Not just the Murican voice. Every dubbed version of DB in every other language is better than the original. FACT.</br>  Is it or is Hercule voiced by Sugita?  Funimation really shit the bed by not securing this for simulcast. Dragon Ball is the only reason they even exist, the streaming service had one fucking job if/when a new DB ever came to exist. Way to go Funi  <br>They don't treat DBZ like anime because half of the DBZ audience is intolerant towards the japanese version.<br><br>They'll probably just put a dub out after a while.</br></br></br>  <br>They're probably setting up a deal with some kids channel to air the dub, and I wouldn't be surprised if part of the deal is that they can't release subs until after the dubbed version is aired.</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't blame them. Keeping Nozawa on to voice Goku after he grew up might have been Toriyama's wish ‚Äì<br><br>But Toriyama is a fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br>  Is there anywhere that I can read the Jaco the Galactic Patrolman manga? Can't seem to find all chapters in one place anywhere.  <br><br><br>I am now realizing Toriyama's plan for this series is to simply remake GT following the remakes of BoG and RoF.</br></br></br>   you will never suck on Trunks' boy penis   <br>Best girl no more</br>  <br>It was a somewhat common thing in anime at the time. High schoolers and even older male characters had the voices of little kids. <br><br>Thankfully the trend died down after the turn of the century.</br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!kxoTFKoa!TGLTd<wbr>qCrMTYKXaFzr96Kw-5ZWQIkzBvE1iaydokh<wbr>ybg</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is 6 months after the buu saga, GT was 10 years after<br><br>Unfortunately I'm pretty sure this means GT is canon</br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta is a man of his word, that's all</br>  <br>I used to hate the japanese version same as you, but then I just knuckled down and watched it. <br>Not only was I surprised at liking it, I actually enjoyed it more than when I watched it in english, and it was solely down to the consistency.<br><br>Having said that, these are all opinions and you know damn well Funimation won't leave this alone for long. A dub will be done before you know it, and it's not like 2001 anymore, these dubs are actually really damn good now. BoG's english dub is far superior to the japanese version, so I'm hoping they do the same here with Super.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Goten and Trunks will never have cute gay sex with each other </br>  <br>Trunks has a gf you faggot.</br>  <br> Krillen is 5ft <br> Vegeta is 5'5 </br></br>  <br>Why do people hate Baby?</br>  <br>Because he can't cut his hair.</br>  <br>Don't be a fag,/ss/ is where it's at.</br>  <br>Exactly what I was looking for, thanks /a/non.</br>  <br><br>Not really? Maybe a little? I think it's just most noticeable with Nozawa because she did typically voice little boys, but once boys became teens or men, no, that shit didn't really happen, and if it did, not with something like Nozawa's voice.</br></br>  guys, srsly pls post link to a subbed version<br>even spanish is good</br>  Where the flying fuck are the subs.

Going by the Kaioshin this episode, he's apparently awake 6 months after the whole Buu thing, despite BoG taking place 4 years after it.</br>  <br> bills <br> not beerus </br></br>   BoG is not canon <br>Good, Vegeta degrading himself never happened then.</br>  <br>Actually it will happen all over again within Dragon Ball Super.<br><br>DBS will be retelling BoG and RF.<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He will. The only difference is that now he will do it for 25 episodes straight instead of just for 20 minutes</br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting. <br><br>Fuck Toriyama.<br>Fuck Toei</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm fully on board with this.</br>  <br>he is now a comic relive character just like gohan and yamcha<br>deal with it</br></br>  <br><br>he will be locked in the hyberbolic time chamber and forced to relive it in an endless loop for 1000 years</br></br>  So in the ROF arc in Super will Gohan wear his green track suit?  <br>But it resulted in the second moment Vegeta was stronger than Goku after the Saiyan saga.<br>Wasn't it stated that SSJ Vegeta enraged at Beerus slapping Bulma was stronger than SSJ3 Goku?</br></br>  <br> milk <br> chichi no suena bien :c </br></br>  <br>I want the 14 dollars, 7 each one, I paid to watch those movies in the cinema back.</br>  <br>Fuck you,Yamucha could solo Goku</br>  <br>Yes.<br>I expect that to be kept in. One final "Fuck You" to Vegeta fans from Toriyama.</br></br>   having to see red god mode goku again <br>pls kill me</br>  <br>Naw, we're going to get some more insight into why Vegeta is so neutered next episode. It should feel more natural and then we see a return to form when he fights Freeza again.<br><br>Vegeta already acknowledged his fall from a high-class warrior position when he fought Goku in the Buu Saga. This is just Vegeta now, constantly struggling between the man he wants to be and the man he has to be.<br><br>Actually, Vegeta is one of the deepest characters in Dragon Ball and that's pretty fucking rad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was all resolved in Buu Saga.</br>  <br> they finally depart from this universe. <br> they‚Äôre chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls <br><br>oh, so its GT 2.0</br></br></br></br>  <br> giving money to Toei <br>You deserve it, idiot.</br></br>  <br>Milk really roll off the tongue better than Chichi, but eh, whatever.</br>  <br>Chi cha chichi oppai boing boing</br>  <br>How did Gohan or Videl react to kissing each other for the first time?</br>  "Retelling" as in a new fucking arc for each movie<br>or just a one episode flashback or some shit.</br>  <br> milk <br><br>reminds me of this one hentai pic from the old days called vegetamilk</br></br></br>  <br>Get the fuck out of here Folgore.</br>  <br>hey it's Flea</br>  <br>paralyzed with embarassment.</br>  <br>toriyama: yo what kind of plot you want Vegeta's daughter?<br>her: just retcon my shit up</br></br>  <br>Arc seems to imply spanning multiple episodes. But everything with "Super" has been so fucking hush-hush so who knows?</br>  <br>I think Videl made the move on Gohan. Doubt he'd be brave enough to make the first move</br>  <br>arc<br>you don't saw goku clothes?</br></br>  <br>I'm going to guess 3 episodes for each movie.</br>  <br>Okay ;_;</br>   Bulma - shoots Goku in the head and plans to use the Dragon Balls and the wish for herself <br> Oolong - Kidnaps village girls and fights Goku <br> Yamcha - tries to rob Goku <br> Pu'er - helps Yamcha <br> Chichi - attacks Goku <br> Kuririn - cheats and tries to screw Goku over <br> Tenshinhan - tried to kill Goku <br> Chiaotzu - assists Tenshinhan <br> Piccolo Jr. - tries to get revenge on Goku and take over the world <br> Vegeta - tries to blow up earth along with numerous other evil deeds <br> #18 - planned to kill Goku <br> Mr. Satan - stole all the credit from Goku and his friends <br> Buu - turned the people of earth into food <br> Uub - reincarnation of pure evil <br><br>Goku has some fine friends<br><br><br>GT may not have been bad if it wasn't for the huge fucking mistakes they made</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Official DBS episode 1 rating:<br> 10/10 <br> Would watch again </br></br>  <br>You wish, we will have 20+ episodes for each one for sure</br>  <br>Rehabilitation doujins are canon as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>8 from me. Snake fight was dumb.</br>  <br>Oh my fucking God no it isn't. Toriyama hates GT. He wasn't a even a part of it. He's stated himself it's not.</br>  <br>Chill</br>   Super Saiyan 2 form is dead <br>why? it was the best one.</br>  <br>Toei too cheap to animate the lightning effect half the time.</br>  <br>GT was great in the initial arc when they were looking for the Dragonballs. If they leave that adventuring aspect in it, then it won't necessarily be bad.</br>  <br>You forgot Roshi taking away Goku's deserved first tournament win.</br>  <br> lightning effect <br>cheap bastards....it made it look even cooler</br></br>  Everyone: Shut the fuck up about GT. It's not even worth wasting your breath on anymore. We have much better and more important Dragon Ball shit to talk about now.  <br>Because it would mark a return of awesome Gohan. Gohan is no longer allowed to be awesome.</br>  <br> Goku's deserved first tournament win. <br>you mean thte fight where roshi had to not only fight off goku but monkey form goku and blow up the moon? Roshi deserved that first win all the way.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I remember the same kind of situation with Hadena, like 4 ot 5 years ago.</br>  <br>If GT is ignored, then first female super saiyan in the anime?<br><br>Or do we have to wait til Pan shows up somewhere?</br></br></br>  <br>Why is planet busting so easy in Dragon Ball?<br>Roshi's max power level ever is just shy of 300 IIRC,and he can blow up the moon.That's fucking crazy.</br></br>   No epic fights like in Z <br> No Faulconer score <br> Main enemy is a fucking purple cat who isn't even serious <br><br>Super confirmed for utter shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>if any female goes SSJ first you know its going to be from Goku's family because toriyama and MUH POPULAR CHARACTERS.<br><br>though toriyama did say in some interview a few years ago that bra was actually very strong so if we get that far then maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>You're trying too hard.</br>  <br> taking DB seriously </br>  <br> Goku has Super Saiyan 3 <br> Gohan has all his potential unlocked and Super Saiyan is useless for him <br> Vegeta looks exactly the fucking same <br> Gotenks just skips it <br><br>Not to mention that Goku and Vegeta both achieved it off-screen through training alone, while only Gohan ever made it really cool and made it apparent that it was a new transformation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's your reply</br>    <br> No epic fights like in Z <br> Main enemy is a fucking purple cat who isn't even serious </br></br>  <br> Main enemy is a fucking purple cat who isn't even serious <br>That part was correct though.</br></br>  <br><br>Delete these,please.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is sort of a problem with the series, though. DBZ gets forgiven for being DBZ, but a good shounen series starts off small and unassuming and slowly grows to its full potential, which makes the super powers at the end more impactful. <br><br>I've always thought Gurren Lagann to be a good example of the proper way of doing this. Kill la Kill's attempt at imitating it failed by powering up the characters too fast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about you delete your shitpost first, summerfag.</br>  <br> Falconer  <br><br>Amerifag</br></br></br>  <br> I've always thought Gurren Lagann to be a good example of the proper way of doing this <br><br>And you're an idiot to do so.<br><br> Kill la Kill's attempt at imitating it <br><br>Further illustrating my point</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,I'm telling you to delete them because all they're doing is feeding the guy who's obviously shitposting.<br><br>This can go too.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Toriyama's intention with the power levels stuff was to show how you can't rely on them at all (Vegeta even pointed it out). So why do people still take them seriously?</br>  <br>Yup Gohan really is the only one to pull off Super Saiyan 2. which is sad to think because its pretty much pointless now.<br><br>loving SSJ2 is hard...</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want to change the best anime tsundere?</br>  <br><br>Only because characters can hide them. It was still established early on that characters are capable of blowing up planets, which makes it weird when they somehow aren't blowing up solar systems now that they're thousands of times stronger.</br></br>  <br>You're an idiot for trying to get a point across with name-calling.</br>  <br>Why do Americans have such a shit taste?</br>  <br>Stop.</br>  <br>All the burgers do things to their sensories.</br>  <br>as if there was ever any doubt</br>  <br>All the planets are filled with dynamite</br>  <br>the game has dual audio, You can switch to Japanese. I know I did.</br>   Goten is a midget at his DBSuper age <br>we saw goku change in height slightly throughout DB (huge jump at the end of DB) wonder why Goten isn't?</br>  <br>Because Goku is also a midget at Goten's age?</br>  <br>He stopped training and became a scholar, like his mama always wanted him to be. I don't understand why so many people have a problem with this. The whole point of Gohan was how different he was from Goku. He wasn't some selfish battle crazy nutjob who was in it for the thrill , he was a kid constantly thrown into life or death situations to protect his family and friends. This is a huge plot point at the end of the Cell arc, when Piccolo is chewing Goku out for throwing his son into the battle and not realizing how his son really felt about things.</br>  <br>Goku barely changed in height, also it's only 6 months after buu saga.<br>They said that at the start.</br></br>  <br>I have no problems with Gohan being study/family first kind of guy, but the whole he forgets to go Super saiyan and he's just thrown into battle just to get his shit kicked in to show off some villains strength.<br><br>that is shit that shouldn't happen. take him out of the show or leave him out of the fights.</br></br></br>  And the misleading OP award goes to....<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UNj<wbr>HxhljAck</wbr>  [ ]</br>  I have a feeling its gonna be different next episode.  <br>Seriously, their eyes give me the creeps<br>Who picked this design choice?</br></br>  <br>Its shit. Honestly expected better from Mosaic.wav<br><br>Sumomo still the best<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FsM<wbr>Kky4Njx0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Ln<wbr>WNohEaII</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Misleading? What are you talking about. It's a great representation of the story. The only downside is it doesn't show enough Megu-nee, even though she's basically one of the main characters herself.</br>  You go into Narutaru thinking its a pokemon type story by the OP. Its so fucking wrong you have no idea.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SIF<wbr>5BLyh3Mk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>What misleading about it? Is it not another iteration of girls doing shit? Because thats what I got from the OP.</br>  Its honestly hard these days to tell if people actually don't know what the story is or if they're just pretending.  Subs when?  <br>Little bit of column A, little bit of column B<br> Where do you think the show'll end? Grad? </br></br>  <br>What story? Yes it has a particular premise but it's still SoL which the OP conceived.</br>  <br> yfw episode 2 has the same OP, but half-way through it shit goes down with zombies eating people and getting their skulls bashed in and shit with death metal replacing the opening song. </br>    <br>Yeah, no matter how misleading the OP's OP may be, nothing tops Narutaru.</br>  <br> girls in thigh highs <br><br>thats all it takes for me to pick up a show</br></br></br>  <br>*not conceived, some other word that makes sense</br>  <br>Last i checked it wasn't out for another 4 days.<br>What are you on about?<br><br><br>Look if you actually don't know SPOILER   It's set during a zombie apocalypse.  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even better, garters!</br>  <br>Is that some big reveal in the manga or something? Seems pretty integral to the premise.</br>    <br> Yfw the OP changes with each episode <br> Yfw the last episodes OP where it   goes back to being happy </br></br>  <br>holy shit the OP makes a lot more sense after finishing the manga.<br><br>GRIMDARK disguised as cute</br></br></br>  <br>You spoiled me you cunt nigger.</br>  <br>Are you purposely trying to ruin peoples' fun?</br>  <br>Its in the first chapter, pretty much everything that makes it seem "normal" is in the main characters delusions, she's a crazy.</br>  <br><br>Ruining fun is what i do.</br></br>  <br>I guess the studio just wanted to give viewers a surprise then. Seems like the whole thing would work better if the zombie thing went unacknowledged.</br>  Hype<br><br>Let those fuckers be deceived.</br></br>  <br>It reminds me a lot of Alien Nine.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WKP<wbr>cHCAkOpQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>The show is real cutesy but in the end is just basically an allegory for rape.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yes, it works a lot better if you don't already know.   You asked so don't blame me, please   <br><br><br>Unless they have zero interest or have been living under a rock, i doubt they don't already know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Muh nigga!<br><br><br>Exactly!</br></br></br></br>  <br>As expected of  worst  girl</br>  So what's this anime about? Just girls doing cute stuff?  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel. I am trained in shovel warfare and I‚Äôm the top shovel wielder in the entire US armed forces. <br><br>  haven't used this in a while  </br></br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> &gt;haven't used this in a while <br>Did it for you</br></br>  So is this a zombie anime or not?  <br>What the hell do you think.</br>  <br>I don't know man, I mean is this a after the zombie apocalypse deal or is it lolis fighting zombies trying to survive. I want a loli DayZ man!</br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br>Its loli DayZ, rejoice shounen.</br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHHA. No.</br>   Project Hrunting <br> Get arrow that never misses <br> Project and attach Caladbolg <br> Arrow that never misses + nukes everything <br> Project and attach Rule Breaker <br> Arrow now never misses + nukes everything + breaks servant contracts on hit, so if they survive they're fucked <br><br>Why didn't Archer do this and turn the grail war into a done deal? It beats literally everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  nice strat which Servant are you and why are you on /a/  But that would just win him the war. Why the fuck would he want to do that?  he needs to fuck rin to get at em MANA  Is there a single Servant who can beat a serious Archer?  <br>Why didn't Archer just win the war and wish on the Grail to stop being a Counter-Guardian if he hates it so much?</br>  <br>A serious Gil?</br>  <br> Is there a single Servant who can beat a serious Archer? <br>Apparently Berserker.<br><br>But that makes you wonder why he didn't just use Ruler Breaker. Berserker takes tons of mana to upkeep, so if he was disconnected he should go poof very fast.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot to add the part where Archer also projects himself five times so he can shoot six nukes at once for each servant.</br>  <br>Because he should know by now that the grail doesn't actually grant wishes.</br>  <br><br><br>Would Archer have truly won the war easily if he was serious?<br><br>Rin could've seriously stayed in her basement till it was over?<br><br>How long would it take?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because rule breaker would be a D rank NP in that case. Even then, he wouldn't disappear instantly with a severed connection. Even Lancelot didn't disappear that fast, just got stalled for a bit.</br>  <br>Serious Gil.<br><br><br>I don't think Berserker can take him easily. Remember he killed him 5 times without UBW? Now i'm not saying Archer has 100% chance to win but he definetely can do it.<br>It could go either way or they would kill each other</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Red batman would only need one night to win the war.</br>  <br>How does he take out every servant?</br>  Is fate literally just "I could've won if I tried" - the franchise?  <br> Serious Gil beating Serious Archer <br><br>Surely you watched UBW 24?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>    <br>Sola-Ui could have won it all.</br>   realizing both Archers could've mopped the floor with the other Servants had EITHER of them actually been fighting seriously <br><br>Archer killed Berserker 7 fucking times in close-quarters combat. Just imagine if he had been able to pop off a few headshots first.</br></br>  <br>Serious Gil would be Gil using his armor and Ea.<br><br>If he doesn't use Ea he gets destroyed more than easy but if he uses it's his win</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just take out every Servant/Master except for Saber and then take care of Shirou before Rin got them involved with them?</br>  <br>If Archer knows everything that's about to happen the why doesn't he try advert things such Illyas death, Sakura's suffering at the hands of the Matou<br>and not tell Rin that the Grail is actually a humanity-ending machine?</br></br>  how come archers never use modern weapons? at what point did the grail just decide to stop collecting the souls of heroes?  <br>Because storytelling. <br><br>Also Berserker is a hard one, he has 50%50 chances</br></br></br>  <br>Read OP</br>  Why didn't Archer just project the grail?  <br>Wow, that's so scary. Yawn.</br>  <br>Too much effort</br>  <br>Why didn't archer project the world?</br>   There are people in this thread who will be retarded enough to believe that "serious Archer" is actually a thing.   <br>Original bow &gt; fake bow</br>  <br> archer throwing roadrollers at servants </br>  <br>Can stands kill servants, or vice versa?</br>  <br> There are people in this thread who will be retarded enough to believe that "serious Gilgamesh" is actually a thing. <br><br>When you borrow my memes, you owe me.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would he care? I mean did it looked like he cared? He even left Rin tied up to Shinji.</br>  <br>You could've saved us a shitload of time.<br><br>How many hours did people spend on the VN because of you being a lazy bum?</br></br></br>  Because Gilgamesh outright says that modern humanity is basically shit-tier, and the Throne of Heroes agrees. <br><br>Humanity is so overpopulated. Achievement is spread too thinly amongst too many so no one human can achieve the greatness necessary to attain a legendary stature anymore; EMIYA only made it because he made a deal with the Guardian Force.</br></br>  Can anyone beat a serious Rider?  <br>Yeah? Isn't that the whole reason why he's angsty in the first place? Because he couldn't save anyone in the end?</br>  <br>Shinji beat her all the time!</br>  <br><br>He can't, Archer can only project his old stand, Atum.</br></br>  <br> EMIYA only made it because he made a deal with the Guardian Force. <br>Citation</br></br>  <br>where this from?</br>  <br>I don't think he would be able to take out lancer and berserker at least.</br>  <br>And after he was forced into Counter Gardening, he stopped giving a shit about everything except breaking the contract/anally ravaging Shirou.</br>  <br>But it is stated that post UBW Shirou has the chance of being way stronger than Archer ever was in life since he already knows things he was supposed to learn like 10-15 years later. <br><br>Post UBW Shirou can reach legendary status. I mean I know he's an exception but I think it applies.</br></br></br>  Gorgon Rider is roughly the same as Shadow Sakura. Both of them fuck shit up in Monster form, but they lose their humanity.<br><br>Then again when Caster summoned a massive shoggoth to try to eat the city all the servants were able to repel it, so if a few servants went at it together they would probably win.</br></br>  <br>Fate readaptation.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/biL1Dbe6BC0  [ ]</br>  <br>RN probably</br>  <br>Depend on who is Rider's master</br>  <br>That is wrong. Archer was boosted by Alaya to be as powerful as he was. He was kicking the shit out of Shirou even at 10% of his strength. UBW Shirou is a scrub who can't even beat Budget.</br>  <br>I don't like the song as much as This Illusion but It's nice.<br><br>Also the character design is really good. Hope they had stayed like that</br></br></br>  Heaven's feel Shirou (kaleid Shirou, fuck I don't know) seems to be more OP I far as I know.  <br> use Ea <br> UBW shattered <br> projecting now depletes archer's magic juice and takes more time <br> can't keep up with gate spam <br> dead archer </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes<br>Einzberns could've won the third war if they didn't try to cheat and summon someone who only amounted to a pagan Jesus combat wise.</br></br>  <br> post UBW Shirou has the chance of being way stronger than Archer ever was IN LIFE <br><br>You can't into reading now can you? <br><br>Also heroic spirits weren't that powerful in life, they get boosted by their legends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HF is shit at long term, great at bursts.</br>  <br>Read the VN.</br>  <br>No, were you even watching the show? He was way past that point and thinks the whole trying-to-save-everyone is pointless. He just wanted things to end.</br>  <br> Sakura dressed as Arukeido </br>  <br>You dense motherfucker. It was downright stated that Saber under Rin was closest to her past strength. Archer also made a deal with Alaya while he was alive.</br>  <br>What's that from?</br>  <br>If everyone could have won if they tried, then doesn't that just balance everything out in the end anyway?</br>  <br>Did Shirou wants to be a seiji no mikata in the kaleid? Haven't read any manga of that yet.</br>  <br>Fate HA (vita) intro</br>  <br>Would Archer be more happy with his afterlife if <br>the Throne of Heroes let him be with Saber?</br></br>  <br>Fate/hollow ataraxia PS Vita.</br>  <br>Not really, at peak strength (without plot armor bullshit), it will be a tie between GIl and Berserker.</br>  <br><br>Nice. <br><br>Vita emulator when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because killing with fire weapons any retard can do</br>  If the point of their school is to prevent dumb teenagers from using their dumb powers to do dumb things, why was this guy allowed to cause thousands of dollars worth of collateral damage chasing after somebody who wasn't even running all that fast?<br><br>I get that MC was cheating at things and maybe hurt some peoples feelings or something, but this guy wrecked several uninvolved places for no real reason. And then he claims the moral high ground???<br><br>also imouto best girl</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, his cockyness was more appealing to me than the regular Beta MC's faggosity.</br>  <br><br>She could just make herself invisible to glasses and switch her power back to MC after five seconds.</br></br>  <br> The only way to do it would be to kill the,both, <br>Not really. The two are obviously not acting on their own, so even if they died, someone else would come after him.</br></br>  <br> "You can't control me because not even I can control me." </br>  <br>They were never going to expose him for cheating. There's no way that they want anyone knowing about his power. They just wanted to force their will on him with the threat of blackmail.</br>   not getting a tattoo of your favorite anime   <br> anime tattoo  <br><br>At least yours is subtle and you can cover it with a watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Are you Mexican?<br>black?<br>yazuka member?<br><br>No? <br><br>Then don't get a tattoo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  My waifu  <br>It's almost more retarded than just a regular anime tattoo because it looks like a fucking Linkin Park lyric and makes you look 16<br><br> I still write it on the first cigarette of every pack, no bully </br></br></br>  <br>You can fuck off :)</br>  <br>there must have been a way to take this picture that wasn't so gay</br>  <br>Which one?</br>  <br>I have it on my wrist.

Most enjoyable so far.  <br> At the end of the manga, it's discovered that all of them were repressing lewd thoughts the whole time, and spontaneously the whole of Japan decides to act on them, concluding in half the final chapter being dedicated to one giant orgy of everyone corrupting each other and experiencing their first orgasms together. </br>  <br>lowest sales of the season</br>  Look at her /a/, this is litterally the purest waifu in fiction, she doesn't know about any evils of this world.  <br>Best laugh of the season</br>  What's the name of the blonde girl with glasses and when will she appear?<br><br>Great show so far.</br></br>  The laugh is perfect.  <br>Shizuka Ishigami has a better DO-HOHOHOHOHO! than Lduvia's Shizuka Itou</br>  SOON  <br>how long?</br>  <br>muh dick</br>  <br>did anyone care before she put on the mask?</br>  I just want more seitokai.

It's so shit that even the western fanbase doesn't give enough fucks to sub it.</br>  <br>But what does that have to do with the image at hand? Do you just pull that image up every time you criticize dragon ball?</br>  <br>I thought that was Ninja Slayer for Japan?</br>  <br>Fansubbing is dead.</br>   All these secondaries embracing adaptations of stuff you've known about <br>Feels  good </br>  <br><br>Well they hyped themselves up to impossible degrees just because of the big names.

Actually, this is actually where the three ep rule can apply to the most.</br>  <br>Looks like a gear to me. I thought asshole is usually drawn as *. In either case, people in that society would never figure that out.</br>  Bitches and whores, man.  <br>Well, duh. The main theme is fighting censorship, and why censoring everything that SOMEONE may find offensive is wrong. It seems to me the point of the lewdness isn't to appeal to the lowest common denominator. If that were the case, we'd have had at least one panty shot and cleavage closeup. No, this show is about fighting censorship, so censoring everything that is normally censored is THE POINT. Anyone who says "lowbrow" about this show misses the point, I think. It's more hilarious than lewd.</br>  <br><br>That's the joke.<br>I don't see what's wrong with it.<br>It's meta, m8.</br></br></br></br>  what are the chances the audio will be uncensored in the BDs?  <br><br> it's intentional <br><br>It's not a joke or meta, or at least not an intentional one. It's japans real life censorship laws not letting the show say those things out loud.<br><br>The only "joke" here is the irony that the show in unable to follow it's own lesson. And that wasn't written in by the author or the studio that made it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> An insult to all things lewd and comedic <br><br>Even Seitokai Yakuindomo?</br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/smzqakytba.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Man, Tumblr must be going full Shut It Down mode right now.</br>  <br>Why didn't they just tazer her?</br>  <br>Hurting a woman is illegal. Did you even pay attention to that scene or the one immediately before it?</br>  <br>Gate thread is that way.</br>  Why is she so terrible at math? everbody knows females have  seven   <br> Why is she so terrible at math? <br>You already said she's a female.</br></br>  <br>It needs to be slowed down just for the sections where she laughs.</br>  <br>It is so obvious that is in the entire Ending.</br>  <br>I don't think showing examples of ridiculous censorship within the show itself is not following its own lesson. If you screamed, "Help, I'm being oppressed!" and nothing was actually happening to you, you'd look like a prick.</br>  <br>No, touching or removing her clothing is illegal, pretty sure they have the power to tazer people they deemed lewd.</br>  <br>I think she stated any act on their part that may cause the towel to fall off, or even move just enough, would make them criminals as well. That's how retarded the fictional laws are.</br>  <br>She's purer than she lets on.<br>See <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>He gets tied up way too much</br>  <br>purity is no excuse for stupidity. she still cant count.</br>  <br>this is about modern japan as it is today right?</br>  <br>A hyperbole but yes.</br>  <br>Alright bro, so lets look at what you're saying.<br><br>It's a known fact (or at least it is as long as you've watched a reasonable amount of anime) that lots of words are censored by japanese law. <br><br>But you're saying this show somehow had a choice to not be restrained by the same laws as every other anime, but decided to instead willing censor itself in the exact same as the laws anyways, despite it's entire theme being about not having censorship.<br><br>And this makes sense to you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not to turn this into /pol/, but one political party likes to push for abstinence and to remove sexual education. The other isn't much better in tolerating speech that might hurt feelings, though. I don't think free speech is a thing particular to a political party, but openness about sexual desires is a more liberal thing.</br></br>  Matsuki Miyu will always make my dick rock hard. She should get more roles.  <br>not quite. Japan still allows pornmags and porn in general. but soon...</br>  <br> ahhh, you think lewdness is your ally <br> You merely adopted the lewd, I was born lewd </br></br>  <br>thought they were getting rid of porn mags being sold at corner stores?</br>  <br>It's 2020 Olympic games Japan.</br>   OHOHOHOHOHO   <br>you realize they literally have zero choice about obeying censorship LAWS right? those things we all have to abide by whether we like them or not? all the more serious for a commercial product that can easily just not be shown or sold anywhere if it doesn't follow those laws?</br>  <br>like I said, soon.<br><br>First they come to the corner stores, within a decade all porn stores shall be closed, doujinshi circles will be forced underground or face serious criminal charges. exhentai will be starved out of its materials.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they write in jokes that have to be censored on purpose, for the sake of having more dialogue censored. I think they take a little pride playing with the censors, and that's not a new thing in anime at all.</br>  <br>Women are going around making money off of exploiting innocent men via extremely biased laws. It's clearly a liberal paradise.</br>  <br>I don't understand.</br>  <br>exhentai is shit these days anyways. its all spanish translations, danmachi and kantai stuff. nothing interesting gets scanned anymore.</br>  <br>The one that's censoring the show with stickers is actually Funimation. The japanese broadcast didn't have them</br>  <br>Which part?</br>  <br>can "subbers" not be lazy fucks and actually translate this show then?</br>  <br>The entire rest of the world has moved on to internet porn, if anything forcing japan to get with the times should be good for them.</br>  <br>I'll be watching it uncensored in my native language then, Even if it means waiting a few more hours.</br>  <br>Why the fuck am I watching HorribleSubs. Who should I watch with then?</br>  <br>Is this bait? The raw was censored.</br>  <br><br><br>You guys could just use this<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>08010 + the raws http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07836</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>   an entire generation deciding that their kids won't breed and their race will die off within a generation <br> allowing yourself to be collared <br> not just taking the fucking collar off <br>The premise of this anime is too stupid for words.</br></br></br>  <br>So she's an hypocrite bitch? She wants everyone else to be ignorant of sex while she gets all the fun?</br>  <br>Funi added even more stickers. They censored the handjob movement she does with her hand when she unmasks herself, for example</br>  <br>You'd be amazed what an all-powerful government and decades of brainwashing can do to a society.</br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>708010</wbr> <br>Is this going to be a contstant thing where as this person just releasing the .ass?</br></br>  <br>And added one over the word Sex in the chalkboard</br>  I want to teach her about cucumbers.  <br> show about lewd words <br> .ass </br></br>  <br>Read the novel, the council as a whole is lpretty much like that.</br>  <br>I assume it's not that they don't breed, they just don't tell them how it works until the very last second.</br>  <br>Good thing the premise isn't important in a comedy show.</br>  not a bad season for lewd anime so far  <br>What do we do now that fansubbing is officially dead?</br>  <br>Best first episode of what I've seen<br><br> JC Staff is doing this and Prison School <br>Lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br>But wouldn't Japan then become the laughing stock of the world because people don't even know what sex is?</br>  Does CR just not pick up whatever Funi picks up?  <br>I'm going to actually watch this to verify that the sticker censorship is non-existent, but I'll prematurely say thank you. You do good work.</br>  <br>no one cares as long as they keep producing electronics and cars</br>  <br>Imagine a stereotypical teenage American couple going to Japan and doing lewd things in public.</br>  <br>It has dirty jokes written in to it because that's the point of the show. I highly doubt they're doing things just to get them censored to try making the show a martyr for it's own cause.</br>  So I just watched a censored episode? <br>Why is Funi so shit? I mean, CR is shit too, but Funi is even more terrible, fuck you too Daiz, this is your fucking fault.</br>  <br>This webm is a fine example for the people that won't believe me</br>  <br>I don't visit CR much, but I'll assume they're going legit now and if they don't have the simulcast license, they won't air it. That's kind of how a license works. One company gets the rights to distribute.</br>  <br>It would be the same thing with the flies, except with two manatees. No one would understand what's happening without lewd voice overs</br>  <br>Shouldn't CR try to avoid that to stay in business?</br>  <br>this too.<br>I don't remember if Funi added censorship for any of the others</br></br>  <br> censoring the word sex <br>Why would they do that? The person in charge of that decision HAD to see the irony, right?</br></br>  <br>They wouldn't care because in their eyes, the people laughing at them (the world) are just indecent, uneducated idiots who aren't as enlightened as them.</br>  <br><br>I think it was a joke from Funi anon</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, what the fuck?</br></br>  <br> This is something people actually believe <br>Never change, internet. oh my god</br></br>  <br>Alot of people who fansub or like fansubs have nasty things to say about CrunchyRoll monetizing. They were, in the beginning, no different from the other animu stream sites. They'd take fansubb'd stuff and host it. They got big, started charging money for 720p streams, bought rights to simulcast, and turned right around and started screaming "Stop fansubbing, you're taking all our money!". So, these days, yes. They will avoid infringing on a lisence.</br>  <br>Why isn't there a muxed version of this? Fuck Funi.</br>  <br> funi has a sense of humor <br>I don't think thats true</br></br>  <br>Well, their jokes suck major cock.</br>  Worst thing is, funi picked up Gangsta and Prison School too, so brace yourselves for more funi censorship. I'm expecting that scene where some guy fucks the whore of Gansta in episode 1 to be censored in Funi even though it wasn't in the Underwater release  <br>I meant, shouldn't CR try to avoid Funi getting everything for themselves?</br>  <br>Except lewd lolis<br> inb4 Prisma Illya won't have the guts to show anything </br></br>  <br> unironically being a woman </br>  <br>the teasing and not showing anything in Illya is why the show is so great though</br>  <br>That's just the bidding war. I have no idea what their localization operation looks like. They may only have a capacity for x amount of shows per season. They may not have the capital.

I know it's based off of what their user desires one they gain Requiem but why doesn't their Stand gain that power in the first place when it's first developed?  I like Jojo because it's surprisingly well-written for shounen trash.<br><br> I love the song "My Funny Valentine" </br></br>  <br> shounen trash <br>Nice meme but it's been a Seinen almost longer than it's been a Shounen now.</br></br>  <br>I thought it's only been in a seinen magazine since Part 7.

I would like it more if it was just a super boost in a stand's power.<br><br>What if part 5 ended with Giorno fighting Diavolo in a big ass forest created by GER?</br></br></br>  <br><br>By the time it's finished, it will definitely be more seinen than shonen.</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/Lghg0-H1-CM  [ ]  <br>It all ties into the series' musical references, and how Bob Fosse once said that most songs are either "I Am" songs or "I Want" songs. Normal stands are like "I Am" songs, which are about the character's personality, job, or role in the story. Requiem stands are like "I Want" songs; they are about desires and goals.<br><br>There are also "I Am Becoming" songs, which tend to mix aspects of "I Am" and "I Want" songs. Typically they're about how someone is growing as a person or how they're achieving their goals and desires. Stands with multiple "Acts" like Tusk are like "I Am Becoming" songs<br><br> I just pulled that out of my ass, but it works. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more like 7 and a half. also, the first 23 chapters were in shonen jump. chapter 24 is the first ultra jump chapter</br>  <br>It's been Seinen for so long, and Part 7 took so long to complete because it went from publication in a weekly Shonen magazine to a monthly Seinen one. There's more Shonen content than Seinen, but it's always sorta been on the border between Shonen and Seinen.</br>  <br>It's based on what you need, not a direct upgrade.</br>  <br>What if what you need is a direct upgrade? :^)<br>Aside from GER.<br><br>Let's assume possible requiem stands are just upgrades then, what would Star Platinum and Hermit Purple requiem be like?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I would like it more if it was just a super boost in a stand's power. <br>They pretty much are. Making everyone fall asleep and switch bodies is way more powerful than "purge armor and stab really fast".<br>And of course there's GER and Bitzadusto (the latter technically is what you wanted albeit not Requiem).</br></br></br>  Hamon or Spin? Which one is your favorite?  <br>Hamon<br> It'll never ever come back ;_; </br></br>  <br>I meant "super boost in a stand's base power".<br>Which means SCR would have something to do with "purge armor and stab really fast".</br></br>  <br> What if someone was able to use both hamon and spin? </br>  <br>Spin</br>  <br>I've always wondered, if requiems are based on what you need and stands are based on who you are as a person, was MiH influenced by Pucci or was it always going to be the go fast gravity horse and Pucci was just the person who got to it first?</br>  <br>You'd rather SCR have infinite speed like Stairway to Heaven? Boring.</br>  <br>How's come you weebs always call it Hamon in these threads and not Ripple? Is Ripple not a direct translation? <br><br> INB4 muh untranslatably subtle Japanese </br></br></br>  <br> Not calling it sendo </br>  <br>Did Dio want the power to attain Heaven?

So it's how it appears in official translations.<br>I think Ignition-One made the right choice, but their scans are over 10 years old and it's not worth shitposting over.</br></br></br>  <br>Because I'm  Brazillian  and Ripple sounds stupid.

Its user is a weak human which can be boosted like in the finale of Pt. 3, but that's not enough in later parts, such as when Jotaro stops time to beat KQ. Thus, a direct upgrade would be to either remove or increase the range limits of the stand, or boost the user itself.</br>  <br><br>Soon hopefully. I kind of dig the way KQ looks in the newer art for some reason.</br></br>  Hey, I got an idea that might be fun. What if we did a duwang coloring of part 4?

He could have been much more interesting with his quirks he got after he came back and Magicians Red is actually pretty powerful but he just let him have a few jokes scenes then he's dead.</br>  <br> Iggy's stray dog hijinks with him becoming the top dog of Morioh <br> Abdul giving wise advices to Josuke, Koichi and Okuyasu <br> Polnareff trying to pick up jap chicks <br> tfw all of that will never happen </br></br></br></br>  <br>Hard to pick up chicks when you don't have legs</br>  <br> those ankhs <br>Pagan, not muslim.</br></br>  <br>He could have made his goal to be "I must stop DIO to defend my homeland" or something. It really shows that he wanted to initially just get rid of the character and didn't plan to bring him back.</br>  <br>I was just looking at the pastebin, is there a difference between the OSTs for the anime and the Pat Metheny Group Essential Collection? Is it different stuff? <br><br> Haven't watched the anime yet but I plan to, so sorry if this is a stupid question. </br></br></br>  <br>Don't remind me of that, anon.</br>  More nep when.  <br>What, you don't like  Roly-Pol? </br>  <br>It's really a shame. When I got to part 7 I was happy to see Abdul only to be let down after he crashed into a fucking Cactus. I think Araki just hates him.</br>  Filenames<br><br>Jojo filenames</br></br>  <br>I think the problem is that Magician's Red is too useful for fights in a conventional way. There's not as much room for creative outcomes as the others.</br>  <br> implying we don't know <br>We are just humoring him, anon.</br></br>  <br>Araki confirmed racist</br>  <br>Iggy would probably be dead by part 4 because of old age</br>  <br>I'd give him a stand user-boost of 5-10 years over your average dog</br>  <br>SUTANDO POWAH won't let that happen.</br>  <br>Then give him an epic battle before dying instead of killing him with a fucking bullet.</br>  So guys, Iggy vs Stray Cat<br>Who would win?</br>  <br> Avdol survives instead of Joseph and apologizes to Josuke for not protecting his father </br>  <br>I was going to say that he was killed by a dimensional vortex, but that's technically just a really big bullet</br>  <br>Iggy.</br>  <br>I don't know, I actually liked that his deaths are both attributed to him caring about his friends a lot. Avdol's a standup guy.</br>  <br>Iggy.<br><br>The Fool is a retardedly versatile stand, like most from Part 3.</br></br></br>  <br> Muhammad Avdol </br>  <br>I'd say Iggy. He can move while Stray cat is planted, and I'm sure iggy coud use the fool to block air bubble attacks, and he wouldn't take damage due to his sand stand's ability. if he got the fool close enough he could swipe the cat a few times and end it</br>  <br>But it's the fact beyond that what exactly is his character? We never really get to learn and he doesn't get any decent fights other than Polneraff and he wasn't allowed to kill him.</br>  <br>5 hours late and it's still worth it to post this<br>BS is best OP</br></br>  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  <br>he's a mystic who knows about tarot cards and stands<br> plot device </br></br>  <br>A child born in a muslim family has a muslim name, so?<br><br>Doesn't mean he didn't change religions as he grew older and explored the world.</br></br></br>  <br> OSTs: Soundtrack of the anime <br> Anthology Albums: Different albums made by the singers of the OPs, the songs are made for jojo and usually talk about individual characters <br> Pat Metheny thing: Just a collection of songs that was put together and released for the anime since one of the EDs is a song from them. </br></br></br>  <br>I think all OPs are great, and it's pretty close for me but I'd say Sonochi and EotW are tied for first, with BS in second and stand proud in 3rd. but it's a really really close match for me, it depends on my mood.</br>  <br>Thanks, you're a gem.</br>  <br>He's basically mature wise dude that wears his heart by his sleeve. I wish he got more fights, I guess burning people to death is too violent for one of the heroes to do. That and Magicians Red is too strong.</br>  <br> Dubs <br>  Zeros. <br>  0 equals nothingness <br> Nothingness = Void <br>It's Cool.</br></br></br></br></br>  If Kars had a stand, what would it be?  no jorge joestar shit <br><br>I'd make it a continuation of his light mode ability, basically it'd be a really weak stand that more or less is like johnny's tusk act 1, but it can perform solar flare esque moves like tienshinhan. I feel this would fit well with kars' nature of being a cheating bastard as in the lisalisa fight with the fake clone. Just flash really bright, and when they're blinded, slash em or eat em.</br></br>  <br>„ÄåFAST CAR„Äç</br>  <br>Is it really too strong? I mean I guess having fire is useful but I don't see it being any better than SP or SC. Or are you saying that he just had so many special moves that it seemed like too much could be done with it?</br>  <br>Ultimate Kars would have„ÄåACROSS THE UNIVERSE„Äç<br><br>It has the power the replicate the abilities and appereance of every (active) stand in the world.</br></br></br>  <br>Still doing the secret technique Joseph?</br>  <br>Dude, it's Pyrokinesis.<br><br>That shit is by default dangerous.</br></br></br>  <br>GER tripped and touched him, he's stuck like that now<br><br><br>Should it be only 1 at a tme though? So he's basically the ditto stand?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 3 Stands really didn't have anything special though.<br> Precise and can punch <br> Can use a rapier <br> Burn things <br> EMERALDO SPURASHU </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that's definitely possible, and the fact that he has the ankhs makes that pretty believable.<br><br> I'm an apostate so that would make him my favorite Crusader. </br></br></br>  <br>They were still very useful, just not particulary creative.<br><br>And SP's true power was Time Stop. Jotaro never fully used the potential of his stand until his fight with Dio.</br></br></br>  <br>nice  dubs <br><br> shoot things <br> swim <br> control dead <br> magnetism <br> metal benders </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I like all. Probably BS&gt;Sono&gt;SP&gt;EotW, but all are good. I just like the first two more, and BS the best. It's my main theme for my Smash character select screen.</br>  <br> true power <br>You mean other power. Stands have been shown to have multiple powers in the series.</br></br>  <br>Metal Benders are pretty rad bro.</br>  <br> super fast <br> super strong <br> flight <br> time stop <br>fuckin jotaro</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, out of all the abilities, Heirophant was the most unique. <br><br> Fast, precise, and strong <br> Uses Rapier, super fast <br> Shoots fire <br> Can take pictures of things user wants and can be used as a whip <br> Can glide and is made of sand <br> Has really long range, can control people, can shoot emeralds at people, can make webs </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> forgetting accuracy/precision  <br>That's the most useful ability he has</br></br>  <br>yeah I really liked hierophant, which is one of the reasons I'm sad kak died. <br><br><br>yeah her stand (High priestess???) was one of my favorites</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, true power. As the future parts show, strenght and speed are common factors that come with close-range stands, but they always have their own special quick. The World is basically a reskin of SP, and his defining power was always "can stop Time".</br>  <br>oh shit, can't beleive i forgot that. I like to think thta it kind of ties in to his time stop ability, but it's still distinct enough that it's a separate one<br><br> SP   super precise  star platinum</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if High Priestess was used by a more competent user and was used in the way Metallica was used in part 5. Midler could've really fucked them up</br>  <br><br>Her stand is Bastet<br>High Priestess was the one in the submarine</br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember exactly what happened, but I think they just got really luck as usual. Also plot armor, I mean when she was pol's breathing mask she could have slit his mouth and throat then and there, but I'm too lazy to recheck how they got out of that one</br>  <br>It's never been stated that The World has SP's precision though, and that goes for most of the later stands too. It just so happens that TW and SP had a handful of the same abilities making them "the same type of stand".</br>  <br>fuck ignore me<br>Wait no<br>Some people are talking about Bastet and some are High Priestess<br>Bastet is the metal one<br>HP is the take any form submarine one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hierophant and Hermit Purple dragged her out.</br>  <br>Uh, I'm pretty sure he got the name right. High Priestess was the one that controlled minerals/metals. Bastet was the magnetism one.</br>  <br>I'm talking about High Priestess, not Bastet. That's why I said Midler</br>  <br>Yes it did. DIO literally says "The World's strenght and precision surpass that of Star Platinum!", all thanks to his vampirism buffs.</br>  <br><br>yeah my bad<br>I need to go to sleep<br>night jojobois</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, must have had insanely fast reflexes and she must have been slow as fuck<br><br>What if Holly did have control over her stand, it's ability was to kill it's user though   or anything it touches, Holly just couldn't move it off of herself <br><br><br><br>watch out for death 13</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok but I still don't see how Timestop can be considered SP's true ability when it has others. The same could be said of The World.</br>  <br>What would you say is Crazy Diamond, or Gold Experience, or Stone Free's most defining power?</br>  <br>Alright you win, goddamn.</br>  <br>After he got time stop that pretty much became his main feature.

Do you think CD has strong rushes than the others?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean the only actual proof of that is Jotaro saying CD is stronger or whatever. I mean in the manga there has never been a point where it's like "Man, Stone Free is so weak with those punches, if it was CD punching that person would be dead already"</br>  <br>I got the impression on here that Stone Free wasn't that strong, I don't know why</br>  Does All-Star Battle still have a decent amount of people playing online?<br><br>I was thinking about picking up the game.</br></br>    <br>It's really hard to get a match but there are anons here who you can play with.</br>  <br>Did Stone Free ever win a rush against Whitesnake?</br>  Can we have a bit of serious discussion? <br> Which main antagonist would you want to get fucked in the ass by?<br/> <br> I personally would love to be fucked by DIO. </br></br>  <br>probably one of my favs, I love that lines<br><br>Kars<br> light mode <br>Esidesi/ACDC<br> heat mode <br>Wammu/Wham<br> wind mode <br>Santana<br> Swooce mode </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably the body type but what about Soft &amp; Wet? He's a really lankey robot so his strength could be weaker, though he hasn't thrown that many punches out.</br>  <br>My fucking sides</br>  <br>Yeah, when she cuffed them together.</br>  <br>Its strength is higher than Crazy Diamond and Gold Experience in the stat sheet.</br>  <br>I don't think they ever went at it, whitesnake isn't an Offensive stand and isn't used for it's strength.</br>  <br>Then why is it swole as fuck?</br>  <br>The wiki says he broke an apartment wall with a backkick, and because of that says it has superhuman strength.<br><br><br>oh nice I'm glad, it must be that Kujo fierceness <br>yeah pucci just jacked off all over jolyne  but he was thinking of Dio-sama </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, they definitely fight, I remember Whitesnake is a punch ghost too .even when he's way from pucci.<br><br>Ah, Is that the only time there fight?</br></br></br>  <br>Because aesthetics</br>  Hato chapter when  <br>Yeah, the only other time is during C-Moon.</br>  <br><br><br>Fuck me, I was wrong. Just checked the wiki and Super Strength is one of his abilities which is stupidly OP since he's also a ranged stand. Pucci was OP even before Green Baby</br></br></br>  <br>fuck piccu</br>  post jojo dubs/checkem gifs/pics    <br>We only actually got like, 2 stats for Whitesnake. I think people only say he's strong because he fisted some people, which is strong but who in jojo doesn't do that. When Jolyne cuffs them together Whitesnake loses pretty bad and Pucci has to throw Jotaro's disc to win.</br>  <br>This about how fast Whitesnake is to be able to dodge Stone Free's Rush.</br>  <br>So they seem pretty evenly matched?<br><br><br>no fuck YOU I need checkem gifs stat you megaturd</br></br></br></br>    Look kids, the SDF is cool!

The problem is that you cannot prove yourself against someone who is much weaker than yourself. They are in a lose-lose situation. If you are strong and fighting the weak, then if you kill your opponent then you are a scoundrel... if you let him kill you, then you are an idiot. So here is a dilemma which others have suffered before us, and for which as far as I can see there is simply no escape. Now the Israeli army has not by any means been the worst of the lot. It has not done what for instance the Americans did in Vietnam... it did not use napalm, it did not kill millions of people. So everything is relative, but by definition, to return to what I said earlier, if you are strong and you are fighting the weak, then anything you do is criminal."<br><br>-some jew</br></br>  <br>Meh having unlimited access to American military technology helps.</br>  People who enjoy S;G are mentally challenged and should seek more education and story comprehension immediately.<br><br>Protip: The next time you see an S;G thread, look at the posts.<br>Most of the posters have blatant misspellings in their posts. Capitalization and punctuation is forgotten, and Youtube-style<br><br>idiocy is emphasized.<br><br>This exemplifies the low intelligence level of Shit;Gates fans. It isn't without reason either.<br><br>S;G is simply a story that was overly dramatic and fictional, a story that should've appealed to anyone with the attention<br><br>span of a 14 year old. However, most people have seen this strategy in the forms of books, movies, real life, or some other<br><br>medium.<br>The dramatic, tragic, and science fiction story has been done many many times, and a single accomplishment of an<br><br>pseudoscience experiment should no longer affect the intellectual in a drastic way.<br><br>However, S;G's target audience consists of 13 year old boys who have never experienced forms of higher literature or story.<br><br>If one were to watch S;G without having experienced stories with sci-fi in them, they would use S;G as the base value for the<br><br>genre. However, if one were more educated on the aspects of dramas and science fictions, one would regard Shit's;Gay as a<br><br>poor attempt to appeal to their audiences.<br><br>Once the dramatic and sci-fi elements of S;G are removed, the remaining dregs are composed of poorly characterized boys and<br><br>pitiful fanservice scenes. Essentially, this is what S;G is to the educated and informed. A dull show which has no appeal<br><br>whatsoever.

I'm not a normalfag. I swear! </br>  <br>Pretty sure loli is the gateway for normalfags that don't want to risk going to jail for CP.</br>  <br> what is Nisekoi </br>  <br> normalfags <br> ever becoming interested in loli <br>Doesn't work that way.</br></br></br>  <br>There are more important things to a girl than her chest size. People who rabidly fight over subjective tastes are retarded.</br>  <br> Nisekoi <br> Literally every girl looks like a girl, even the god damn reverse trap </br></br>  <br>But loli and incest were the first fap I had thanks to the internet.</br>  <br> damaged <br>Other cancerous normalfags ITT will defend this fag.</br></br>  <br><br>Tsugumi passed for a boy,</br></br>  <br>yes!!</br>  <br>You were born that way.</br>  <br>Back then when I used to browse /b/, there were loli threads practically every day.

In any case, /b/ is for all the sick shit on this site. Your point means nothing.</br>  <br>But they also love 3DPD, cowtits, etc, and by your logic they are normalfags.</br>  <br>You're either a lying piece of shit or you care a bit more about character than what makes your dick hard.</br>  <br> how come my favorite is Megumi and not Eriri? <br>Because personality trumps design any day.</br></br>  <br>Sounds more like you've got issues accepting Eriri is not best girl and in fact is on the run for worst girl.</br>  <br>No one goes to /b/ to have loli threads, newfag. There are tons of normalfags there and not all of them are memetic towards loli that is used as troll material more than anything there. Quit grasping at straws.</br>  <br> Eriri already looks like she has short hair when ties it up as twintails <br><br>Not really. Twintails are a distinctly feminine feature. Cut Eriri's hair, put her in male clothing, and you have someone who could pass for a boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Fact: your taste is wrong.</br>  <br> Typical Megumifag <br>My taste and opinion &gt; your taste and opinion</br></br>  <br>Sounds like you're in denial. Loli isn't as niche and exclusive as you want to believe.</br>  <br> majority of the fanbase somehow has the wrong taste <br><br>I think you need to get your facts checked.</br></br></br>  <br> She could pass as a boy if we made her into a reverse trap <br>No shit, really?</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, Eririfag.<br>Maybe you and I should settle it right here on the board if you think you're so correct.</br></br>  <br> only taste is right! <br>  if you disagree, you're wrong! <br><br>Eririshitters are this desperate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Majority always have worst taste. Checkmate.</br>  <br> Naruto is good because of how popular it is </br>  <br><br>Yeah, the reason she can pass for a reverse trap is because of her flat chest. The flatter your chest, the closer you are to looking like a boy. It just isn't very attractive.</br></br>  <br>That's called being a hipster, you normie.</br>  <br>Imagine seeing Eriri's dick peaking out slighty on a windy day.<br><br>How can you not see why she's the best girl/would be boy?</br></br></br>  I want to protect that smile!  <br> muh fact is better than your fact! <br>Typical, Megumifags calling the kettle black.</br></br>  <br> Godwin's Law </br>  <br><br>I'm not attracted to guys.</br></br>   Megumifags are normalfags <br>Makes sense. She is normal as it gets as an average and boring girl.</br>  <br>Stop samefagging already, Eririfag.</br>  <br><br>Megumifags like their girl both because she has a great personality and because she is beautiful. The only reason Eririfags like their girl is because she makes their dick hard.</br></br>  <br> isn't as niche and exclusive  <br>Prove it.

It's always Megumifags who discuss the novel and characters.

Fuck off.</br>  Megumi a shit. A SHIT.  <br><br>Does this look anything like a cow?</br></br>  <br>It's funny because Saekano is a pure otaku series, the last thing a normalfag would like and follow. Yet Megumi is the most beloved girl in the fanbase.</br>  <br> Eririfags <br> Not always discussing and arguing for her character <br>Newfag detected.</br></br></br>  Nice thread guys. You're really showing the Yaharifags who's boss.  <br> Eriri* a shit. A SHIT <br><br>Fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>Disgusting udder.</br>  <br><br>We haven't had a serious waifu war in nearly a month. Megumifags drove off the Eririfags and Volume 8 sealed the deal when it hammered home that it's the Megumi route now.</br></br>  <br>Nice backpedal.</br>  <br>I refuse to believe there is more than one person autistic enough to get mad and start calling everyone who doesn't agree with him normalfags.</br>  <br>I'm not seeing any back to back threads here.</br>  <br>Notice how threads are only shit when Eririfags are actively posting. It's been demonstrated over and over again.</br>  <br><br>Even in that month, there was still discussion about the novel, just that only Megumifags participated. Before that Eririfags got BTFO every single thread.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sad how delusional Megumifags have become because some Eririfags are less autistic by being busy with other shit on some days.</br>  <br>You lost and are not making shit up. Stop posting, Megumifag.</br>  <br> always <br><br>More like ONLY when they feel forced to defend and whiteknight her. Otherwise they will never discuss shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Megumifags started shit first and are going full normalfags <br> It's Eririfags' fault, guise. Look! </br></br>  <br> some Eririfags are less autistic by being busy with other shit on some days. <br><br>You mean for an entire month? Even when Volume 8 summaries were posted, threads were largely peaceful.</br></br></br>  <br>How come none of this shit happens when there isn't an obvious Eririfag posting? <br>You faggots are the most rabid and obnoxious fans, always derailing threads and being defensive over subjective opinions.</br></br>  <br>Except Eririfags blow haters and trolls more than not. Most detractors can't argue for shit. It is easy when most of them are ignorant and based their shitposting off bad source:the anime.</br>  <br> forced <br>Eririfags generally only want to enjoy and talk about her in peace. You fags are the one who make war and thus force their hand, retard.</br></br>  <br><br>The majority of novelfags are Megumifags.</br></br>  <br>He means when Eririfags obviously start shit and get their ass handed to them. I mean, you have to be really stupid and ignorant to say things like "Eriri is more popular than Megumi" or "She has more fanart".</br>  <br> majority <br>You might had been believable if the LNs were translated. But they're not. The vast majority of the fanbase are not LNfags.</br></br>  <br>No one says that. Straw man harder.</br>  <br><br>I'm talking about people who know moon. Most of them are Megumifags. For the past month it's just been them discussing the novel.</br></br>  <br> talk about her <br>That's the point, idiot. You barely even talk about her. Even Utahafags start some discussions and talk about her character sometimes.</br></br>  <br>This. Proof is here  .

In fact, I would say it is generally quite good.</br></br>  <br>Too bad for you anon's waifu for various reasons that is their own is the most important thing. Waifu is serious fucking business.</br>  <br>As usual, Megumifags being worst and even autistic normalfags is the cause.</br>  <br> waifufags <br>No. DFCfags are the worst. At least keep your shit contained in your threads.</br></br>  <br> Links a thread that have Eririfags posting in it </br>  <br> Eririfag failing to shift blame </br>  <br><br>Maybe a couple, but the the thread was largely nice and comfy.</br></br>  What the fuck? I thought these shitty arguments were over already. I guess the underage faggots are back to shitpost again.  <br>One Eririfag != Eririfags. Also it's quite obvious he's the rare type of non-combative Eririfag. You can tell when only those are in a thread when you don't see suspicious posts repeating the same old muh twintails, dfc, etc, praises and jerking themselves.</br>  <br>Waifufags can shit on each other in all sort of ways, but the worst are undoubtedly "normalfags". There are generally unwritten rules of what is acceptable and what isn't, and normalfags are cancerous to the board. It has always been like that (eternal summer). Point is, you can't go posting just anything when you're on /a/ (true for other boards too that have their own culture and acceptance). Much to /a/'s annoyance, there are quite a lot of normalfags that do lurk /a/. But most of them actually don't make posts that would point them out as a normalfag. Why? Because they know better and learn how to make decent posts that won't trigger /a/ going crazy on them.</br>  <br> Hasn't learned how to deal with Megumifags and Eririfags being terrible and ruining threads </br>  <br>People only react badly if crossboarders talk about gf, 3DPD and so on. The dfc thing is hardly the same, and most /a/nons don't get autistic about muh normalfags when someone expresses dislike for it. The non-autistic stock reply is "DFC is justice!".</br>   Megumifags are the worst <br>Sasuga.</br>  <br><br>Megumifags are nice, chill posters that contribute greatly to discussion. Eririfags are usually angry shitposters.</br></br>  <br> look mom, I said it again! </br>  <br>It's a fact most of /a/ hates normalfags. There must always be post that calls out the normalfags out of a sense of duty, for elitism' sake, or for simple and pure hate for them. Hate should be expected. How a normalfag response and whether he engages to shit back will determine the course of action /a/ might take.</br>  <br>Doesn't that go against the point earlier? <br><br><br>Unless you want to believe only one person can like her, there has to be at least a couple, maybe a few.<br><br>And please, Megumifags and Utahafags are not any better when they circlejerk saying the same traits and praises over snd over again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Same Megumifag failing to shift blame </br></br>  <br><br>Megumifags praise their character for her personality. Utahafags barely exist.</br></br>  <br> Same <br><br>Stay delusional.</br></br></br>  <br> Shifting blame <br>It takes two two tangle. See this thread. You guys are not better.</br></br>  <br>Only sometimes. Megumifags going on about how Megumi is most beautiful/prettiest and why all the time. Even passing it off as truth when they use the author's card.</br>  <br> Defensive reply <br>Definitely samefag.</br></br>  <br>I'm saying that threads are good whenever the Eriri defense force isn't on.<br><br>And yes, they're better by the virtue of discussing things beyond that. Megumifags especially discuss her personality, her relationships, future plot points, etc. Refer to the threads since volume 8 came out.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The problem is that most Eririfags probably can't pass this simple character test. <br><br> Describe Eriri WITHOUT saying what she looks like, what kind of costume she wore, or what her profession or role in the anime was. Describe her to your friends like they ain't never seen Saekano. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night.</br>    Feels good being a utahafag.  <br> Only sometimes <br>That's 100% more times than other fans. As said earlier, Eririfags only discuss Eriri when people are shitting on her. That's also limited to the events of the Izumi arc and volume 7. It isn't even a wholesome talk about her character.</br></br>  <br> liking someone irrelevant </br>  <br> having Lelouch on your side </br>  <br>Speaking hypothetically for slandering purposes is a distasteful way to troll. If most Eririfags only likes her body and external traits, then they would only care for body. Kinda like with Louise for some people. But that isn't the case most of the time since they argue for her character and personality whenever she gets heat.</br>  <br><br><br>Megumifags are delusional as fuck. So sad.</br></br></br>  <br> since they argue for her character and personality whenever she gets heat. <br><br>Which they can never describe beyond saying "she's tsundere!"</br></br></br>  <br>She's a generic blonde twintailed tsundere with flat chest and zettai ryouiki.<br><br>Oh shit, it's hard.</br></br></br>  <br> rabid  <br> obnoxious  <br>Megumifags are the Senafags of this series. Fails hard to pass off as their that don't shitpost or act militant, but that's far from being true.</br></br></br>  <br>Apply yourself.</br>  <br>Neither, she is a scary person.</br>  <br>Quit with the lies and slander. And tsundere itself is a valid and easy to understand personality description, so you can't badmouth that.</br>  <br>Except you're wrong and it was already explained why.</br>  We had a nice thread yesterday and some before and I noticed there were barely Erishits posts. <br><br>Now that some of them are posting here, look what happened...</br></br>  <br><br>It's a very cheap and lazy way to describe a character. Megumi forces people to think about why they like her and what they seek in a heroine because you can't just dump her into a pre-existing archetype.</br></br>  <br> Two-faced girl with an angelic front and an abrasive, sorta mean girl-like persona with a bark that's louder than her bite, which makes her endearing instead of vicious. Strong willed, stubborn, full of pride, but has passion, sincere, and is pure to her dream and to those she opens up to. <br><br>Rocket science stuff, amirite?</br></br></br>  <br>Remove Eririfags.</br>  <br>You forgot backstabbing and cowardly.</br>  <br> Strong willed <br> sincere <br><br>Honestly a good description, but those parts are questionable. If she really was strong willed she would have told Tomoya directly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your personal dislike for tsundere doesn't mean other people will feel and think the same way you do when they use tsundere to aid them in discussing her personality.<br><br> can't just dump her into a pre-existing archetype. <br>You think so, but yet there are people who dislike her for various reasons that hits home to certain other plain, boring, dull, normal, etc girls.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Eriri &gt; all.</br>  <br>That's just your  delusion. </br>  <br><br>No, I just dislike it when people half-ass their descriptions of characters using pre-defined archetypes. <br><br> people who dislike her for various reasons that hits home to certain other plain, boring, dull, normal, etc girls. <br><br>Their criticism is usually poorly written and easily disregarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Utahafags don't use kuudere as much as Eririfags use tsundere to describe her.</br>  <br> Typical Megumifag <br><br><br>Emotionally delicate and strong-willed aren't mutually exclusive. Look up the term strong-willed, it doesn't mean what you think it means. Eriri is the willful type. You know how fathers say his daughter is a very willed girl that causes trouble and can be hard to deal with? It's like that. Eriri is simply a determined girl once she sets her mind to what she wants to do.<br><br>Eriri is sincere. That is the main driving force behind her passion and motivation and also in respects to how she feels about Tomoya.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying she isn't a traitorous cunt and a coward <br>Typical Eririfag.</br></br>  <br>Adults are talking now. Unkindly fuck off, troll.</br>  <br> Has issues with defined archetypes <br>You're proving my point.<br><br>I'm sure any opinion that doesn't fit your high standard are deemed poor. That's an easy way for you to disregard whatever doesn't suit you, eh.<br><br><br>Utahafags don't post nearly as much either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Typical Megumifag </br></br>  <br>Stating facts isn't trolling. You only see what you want to see.</br>  <br> facts <br> " Unkindly fuck off, troll." </br></br>  <br>Utahafags are undoubtedly better posters than Eririfags at least.</br>  <br><br>If you define "strong-willed" as determined, I guess that works, though I thought she really wanted to tell Tomoya personally but couldn't muster the nerve to do so. Does a strong-willed coward make sense?</br></br>  <br>So you're denying Eriri of some of her core traits? That's not a good thing to do.</br>  <br> He can't into subjective opinions <br>Typical Megumifag being more worst than usual.</br></br>  <br>You don't need to reply twice.</br>  <br><br>I don't have a high standard for character descriptions, it's just that I have never seen a well-written criticism of Megumi. Perhaps you could explain why Megumi is a bad or boring character.</br></br>  Everyone in this show is so delicious <br><br>Utaha a best but damn it was hard with all these best girls, cousin was the worst though without a doubt</br></br>  <br> Typical DELUSIONAL Megumifag. </br>  <br>I'm just a mirror.</br>  <br>You can only say that since Utahafags generally aren't involved in the shit-flings.<br><br><br> personally <br>I don't think so. Eriri had a reason why she didn't want to face Tomoya. But she sure wanted to tell Tomoya why she left this time, and she made that clear in the mail she wrote, which included a nod to the past via an extra apology. <br><br>Being strong-willed doesn't necessarily makes a person have stoicism to emotional trauma. Eriri can be weak, but she isn't a coward to pain or hardships. Coward has the nuances that implies an excessive degree that is usually reserved for a person who can't handle any of the sort.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are better even leaving the shitposting and waifuwars aside. Though there's that delusional Utahafag who is possibly one of the worst shitposters on /a/ currently, period.</br>  <br><br>Her reason was "I didn't want to see Tomoya hurt" which is a pretty shitty reason.</br></br>  <br>What about  Lelouch? <br><br><br> Doesn't want to see with her own eyes a person she loves in pain <br> And this is despite the fact she will be part of the cause for that pain <br>Seems emotionally romantic to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Define boring <br>See to a dictionary, Megumifag. Megumi will be one of the definitions of boring. Fun avoids Megumi for it fears her.</br></br>  Piano fag here. I'm bored so I'll post a song, if you guess right I'll pick up a request. <br><br>After the request, I'll do the same thing all over.<br><br> not the best audio but it's ok, also it's a elecpiano <br>http://vocaroo.com/i/s08CutNfzewE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I find practicing fun when i'm at the point that I've learned the song and can just play it without having to look at any sheet music.</br>  <br>Alright i'll have to find a book on that so I can learn and practice those.</br>  <br> I don't really know or practice and exercises, I usually just jump right into practicing the songs I know <br>Me too. I don't really care for them if I'm capable of learning them myself. I'll only rely on them when I hit something in a song I can't do. And I can't recommend anything because like I said, because I don't know any. My teacher had me doing them at the start but at some point realized it was useless and now just helps with pieces.<br><br><br>I used to care about practicing, if you're talking about exercises and such. Now I just care about the end result.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> without having to look at any sheet music. <br>How do people do this? I find sheet music holds me back so much. I learn far far faster when I just memorize. I memorize things far before I'm able to read them on sight.</br></br>  <br>You just gotta read a lot of simple pieces until you get used to it. Are you memorizing using sheet music? Because personally I find memorizing a lot easier with sheet music.<br><br><br>Personally I enjoy practicing as much as the end result, of course I enjoy practicing a piece much more than a set of scales.</br></br></br></br>  Drawfag Thread 1530<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn (embed)<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1529 <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127506259 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to fucking hate myself anyway, so I might as well put it to good use.</br>  <br>I'm working on it</br>  <br><br>I like to imagine an artist's path to getting good being a straight line, but if your ego gets too inflated you start floating to space and if you shit on yourself you'll start burrowing into the dirt.</br></br>  Alright dudes, take this scene from Little Witch Academia 2 and draw me something out of context  Well I guess a Little Witch Academia suggestion isn't so unexpected with the new anime out-and since Sucy is apparently into mushrooms howza about a paring with her and another mushroom head?  Berg Katze is so lucky. I wish I could be trapped inside that ribbon and spend all day resting against Hajime-chan's boobs.  <br><br>How is he the Hajimes? explain</br></br>  <br>She appears genki, but seems to have an explosive temper and is bad with crowds.</br>  <br>Watch the directors cut of episode 12 m8.<br>He just gets absorbed in there  probably because Hajime wanted him to. </br></br>  <br>Watch this http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>54774<br>It's one of the many added scenes into Embrace</br></wbr></br>  When I was her age this was my dream as well.  What's the best kyoani show?<br> It's Hyouka </br>  Possibly Hyouka. Disappearance of Haruhi is a close second, but that's a movie.  <br>Likely Hyouka.</br>  <br>If someone is still crying about FMP more than 10 years later chances are he won't ever grow up.</br>  <br>In terms of animation, I'd say Kyoani outdid itself with Hyouka. Newer shows like Hibike really stand out but I don't think they they can match Hyouka.<br><br>Nichijou is more enjoyable. and also very well animated, but I don't think it ever strove to be like Hyouka. I'm also saying this off memory and not by looking at these shows side by side so please rape my face if you think I'm wrong.</br></br></br>  <br>The show is a mystery but doesn't try to overwhelm the audience. It also preserves the nature of an average SoL if you find yourself liking those as well.</br>  http://bato.to/read/_/330448/pok%C3<wbr>%A9mon-dating-a-team-magma-grunt-do<wbr>ujinshi_ch10_by_mms-mechanical-scan<wbr>s<br><br>Thoughts?</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  </blockquote>]
