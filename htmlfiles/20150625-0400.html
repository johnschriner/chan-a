[  from Ishibumi's blog  The BD's for S3 will be coming with a 6-part novel called "Highschool DxD EX"  We don't know how it fits into the timeline, but this may be a preview at the sequel to the series.   God from another world   4th user of Durandal   Black haired boy that uses lightning   RED HAIRED BOY WITH DRAGON AURA   Brown haired Angel with Dragon wings   Asia-kaasan   In xx years from now, a big war will occur.   The title:  High School DxD EX -- Crimson-haired Sekiryuutei --   Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?                   Issei dies   Saji becomes MC   How would /a/ feel?      Heads up.  Ishibumi was inspired to do this because of Naruto Gaiden.    Shit series, don't care.  Eh, probably a "what-if" alternate universe plotline   From what I read on the blog, it sounds like some time machine Azazel created.    It's most likely a teaser for a sequel after DxD ends. That's pretty fucking hype.  Info I gathered from the quotes I could understand:   Azazel says this is the telling of the forbidden story.   In xx years from now, a big war will occur. Some of those who have been imprisoned achieved a revival. - Mysterious boy with black hair that uses lightning   Red haired SWORDSMAN boy with dragon aura    Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?  One of the quotes is from him, so no.  Hopefully Code-Zero'll get on translating this pretty soon.               Ophis better be in it or else my interest will fade quickly.    Issei confirmed dead after knocking up the girls?  good isseis hair fucks me off   So, what happened to the side stories being adapted to anime form? Was that a troll?   They're coming in each Dx vol it sounds like. Riser ova coming in December with Dx.2    The OVA "Unresurrected Phoenix" is with Dx2.  This 6-part Novel is with the BD/DVD Volumes.  Each season there is a 6-part Novel included with the CDs.  I don't know what Season 1's is.   Season 2 is about Issei having a date with every member (yes, including Gasper and Kiba) of the ORC in a single day            Red haired SWORDSMAN boy with dragon aura  Kiba is the father    Is ShindoL a fucking vegan or something?  Japan comic book creators doesn't usually shove lifestyle choices into their works you fucktard.     Implying ShindoL is Japanese        He thinks ShindoL is a Jap      pretty sure he is a Jap  he just lives in New York     That's what I spend my days doing, pondering the political philosophical undertones of my hentai, not ya know... fapping to it.   Also maybe he is a vegan, who fucking cares, eat meat if you want, don't eat meat it's your choice, stop acting like a bitch because suddenly you're made to feel bad about it.    all of this 'appealing to our humanity' and he's probably still not going to give Saki a happy end.  Or the guy just wants to see degraded cow lolis  either way I'm fappin'      he   oh anon, what a world awaits you      I wonder if drawing manga is cheaper while living in New York than in Tokyo.     He still faps to manga   Instead of reading it's deep and intricate commentary on society  I bet you think drainage city is bad too.      Last time I checked japan was pretty expensive, so I'm going to go with yes.    Great hentai stimulates the mind and the penis.  A gentleman's fap       I wonder if drawing manga is cheaper while living in New York than in Tokyo.

New York is pretty expensive. We got the market price for rent averaging about 3432... Food is expensive with an average meal if you try to be health conservative for about 10-15 dollars and getting by with 7 dollars.  Only plus side is that public transportation is at a flat rate of 2.75 per ride with a transfer.      See  .  In fact it seems that NYC is more expensive than Tokio on average.      americans in charge of understanding basic dairy farming  CHEESE COMES FROM CANS MEAT COME FROM BURGER USA USA USA      Nobody in their right mind would call that thing cheese.   Hey i know that's not that kind of thread but does anyone know where this come from, i've looked through all ShindoL works and didn't seems to find it  Care to tend a (clean) hand to a fellow fapper ?    https://www.patreon.com/shindol?ty=<wbr>h  holy shit she makes twice my wages  </wbr>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr>   You first faggot.   Is it hard to want good discussion? You faggots always shitpost with your Iroha or Death, memes, and waifuwars.      That's you, m8.    The date between Yui, Yukino and 8man is the promise date.    From what I've read from 2ch, it seems like Yui treat this as the promised date.  But in 8man's monologue it's implied that he thinks otherwise and he still intended to keep his promise. (Destinyland date with Yui)       Yukino will win. It just that might not be what you're probably thinking of right now. Of course assuming WW is a decent writer and not jut a Maruto poser.

In terms of dumb people knowing nothing, yes.    But that stuff that gifted people wouldn't learn outside of school? They probably don't remember most of it too well from school either. You learn to memorize it for the test and immediately forget it afterwards, because you have no internal interest.

Though it's most the most essential one: reading.      Kaga is love Kaga is life    hey hey smile Again.      gahahahaha so good        out. You're dangerous chara.     That new Shiranui doujinshi is quite good.  Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?   yes     But it was not the end of it.   Someone laughs   Gogogogogo       He's been spamming One Piece threads with the same shit.    If these spoilers are true than DoFlamingo is defeated but Bird Cage is still closing on the city    don't tell me you actually believe that shit?   We wait for summary anon  Link for those who missed last thread <br/>     I know but at least we are getting a translation and considering he is the only translator working in DAL we are lucky.    Well I can understand why. Too detailed kind of kills your motivation due to it being pretty much already done. It's why we asked the guy summarizing this to keep it concise. The only part I want in real detail anyways is the Mana section.    but a summary it's no the same as a fully translated novel. Summary anon summaries are good but they still lack some details    and we still need a translator for the short stories.   Waiting.   Gotta day, Kotori's date was great. Yoshino and Natsumi's date are a close second best. Other dates were alright. My least favorite is Miku so far though.    Is Photoshop CS6 enough to scanlate or do I need another program to? Or should I rather use Gimp or something?   It got better, at least Accel now looks like Accel after the hair change. Well, kind of. At least he stopped the thin white lines on black hair bullshit that kept being an annoyance.     that's retarded, have you ever even read an actual physical manga?     Clip Studio Paint   How about paint.NET?  Are anon black's typesetting tutorials the best one or are there any better ones? Also what does he mean with "Do not use text boxes"?  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  Roundabout ED: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=izF<wbr>qa0i_EwI</wbr>  [ ]    Infinity &gt; Zero confirmed    No offense, But Jo2suke is a black guy, He just look too black for me.      DIO used to have dark hair   So did Giorno      This is probably due to the fact that Araki does Jin Yong style characterization. Jin Yong is a super famous Chinese Wuxia author, and one of his trademarks is giving stories to pretty much every named character that appears. On top of giving them backstories, he doesn't feel the need to write extremely complex characters and instead tries to make them all striking, whether they are 1-dimensional or multi-dimensional. And it works. Araki pretty much does the exact same thing, just to a lesser extent because we don't have biographies of every character. But the effect is still the same, it just works.

I'll be posting summaries and dumping pics. This is my first time doing a summary, so I wasn't really sure what was fine to omit and wasn't, so if you have any questions or anything to add, please do so.    Being dragged to ReR because Eriri couldn't go alone   Being forced to inform Tomoya simply because Eriri can't   Being Eriri's babysitter no matter how I look at it  Those're true but  Being happy to see her drawing gets better  As an Utahafag I am feeling complicated now         Will he ever learn to be softer to everyone? I mean, not everyone is like Megumi, who seems to be the only 1 on Earth that can listen to him well. Thought he's really changing until vol.8....WTF?     Honestly, Utaha never had a chance, so there wasn't anything to fuck up. Too much author worship.      &gt;&gt;/Animesuki/      The girl who get the first kiss of Tomoya   The girl who loves Tomoya (vol 7)   Eriri got BTFO and Megumi is just the best example of heroine   Utaha still the most important girl for tomoya on vol 8   Still being delusional you retarded only animefag.      </blockquote>]
