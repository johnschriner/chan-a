Making graphics better, taking the scenartio to another level, but the base stays the same. <br> They want to make the player think "nostalgic but fresh" about some things they see in the game, move his feelings by some things, suprise him, and to give it all Type-Moon has. <br><br>[About the setting change]<br> The setting now change from a city that resembled "vaguely Tokyo suburbs" to pretty clearly "Tokyo metropolitan area". The scale of the incidents doesn't change, but the new scale of the setting might affect the story in some way, pls look forward to it. <br> Long talk about how different settings might feel. Original Tsukihime and Mahoyo are kinda like "what if something happened here" to new "big cities are scary, isn't it, things like this happen in big cities". <br> Takeuchi says a big city is more fit for modern vampire stories.  <br> They're talking about how they did location scounting around Tokyo, but won't say which specific places are inspired by. They don't want the players to know what to specifically look forwatd ro yet. <br> The Toono mansion and the school are being remade in details. The mansion will still be Western style and will feel like the best place for murder incidents to happen.  <br> They're talking about the 3D image of the mansion that's on a different page. Takeuchi is making a 3D model of it, which makes drawing easier, but it's also hard, since he needs to create all the details and mind object collisions.  <br> Nasu says that when you add the characters and text it really feels like a proper mystery/horror etc. and is really happy to be making a hype of game he likes. <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127386767#p127386767">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course he says it in more Japanese-y way.<br> I was thinking people could maybe have already gotten used to the new designs... </br></br>  <br>where you get this? j</br>  So basically this story is going to take place in 2015?  <br>Nope it will always be the 90's<br><br>Any other time would fuck up the Nasuverse. Same way Mahoyo is set in the 80's.</br></br></br>  <br>Beast's Lair and Mobius Space.<br><br>http://z13.invisionfree.com/Mobius_<wbr>Space/index.php?showtopic=248&amp;st=13<wbr>5</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  The best.  <br>Or the elite security could have just had a bad hand.

What's up with the weird shirt with only one button? This is probably the weirdest uniform in anime.  What the fuck did I just read?<br><br> I take back everything bad I ever said about Miyazaki. He deserves respect for this manga alone. </br></br>  <br>In our dreams.</br>  <br>Isn't Anno doing one?</br>  <br><br>To be fair, a lot of that was written long after the movie came out. The manga continued serialization until, what, 1990 or so? The movie was basically a prototype of the story.</br></br>  Ohma best kaiju  <br>In his dreams, too.</br>  We still wait for the LN scans / photographs.<br><br>Everything awesome from the last thread:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Will a moon guy post them scans or do we have to wait for an anon to get them?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Actually i dunno.
