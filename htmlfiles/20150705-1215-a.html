This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed? The LoGH remake news got a sticky.</br>  <br>It was</br>  <br> stickying an old series getting licensed </br>  <br>Everybody saw LoGH already, who the fuck cares where it's licensed?</br>  <br>Quite the oblivious faggot you are.</br>  LWA made me realize how much anime costs to make.

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple. We need some other rules.  :^) </br>  <br>I'm no doctor but you might have legit autism Anon</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Do you really not see that you just answered your own question?</br>  They sure put up a fun show.  <br>A lot of TTGL's episodes made /a/ go nuts.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're not getting it. Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre.

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it.

When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy.

You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

There's nothing wrong with liking mlp. I watched it along with every other show back way when with my sister.</br>  hihi  <br>And my stream had constant buffering, so I just ended up downloading the fucking thing despite paying for it.</br>  <br>what do you think little witch butt smells like?</br>  <br>Cute girls + cute things + magic = "INDUSTRY SAVED" AMOUNTS OF MONEY</br>  <br>LWA2 kickstarter started late in the evening USA time and was completely funded in under 3 hours.<br><br>Tumblr/leddit/jewtube didn't even fucking know it existed until after it was already fully funded (in no small part by /a/).<br><br>So fuck your shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't have to be the case though the show does air in japan, animators love other animation and they will throw nods into shows they like in their own work</br>  <br>Or moe</br>  Sucy is for _____  <br> funded in under five hours <br> crammed <br>I think we donated pretty fucking willingly there.</br></br></br>  <br>futa</br>  <br>Are you saying that stickying money begging threads is not cramming something down one's throat?

They would have that unmistakable sweaty, musky butt smell; but each rear would have its own unique characteristic that makes them all worth sniffing.</br>  <br>That's because they already have Precure (for the bigfriends) and Kamen Rider (for lonely housewives).

At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it. <br><br>Well, aside from the endorsements (from Hideo Kojima etc), it started out with some well-known people as well, as Studio Kinema Citrus is mostly ex Production IG staff. <br><br>Wikipedia is telling me that Kinema Citrus also did Yuyushiki and Black Bullet, so I'm starting to understand the whole "artistic differences" spat with Creative Intelligence Arts, which was big on the whole "anti-moe" thing. <br><br>Anyway:<br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/06/2<wbr>2/under-the-dog-getting-an-anime-ki<wbr>ckstarter-back-on-track/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm enjoying it.</br>  <br>Tell me some more how much you don't care.</br>  <br> i can't find myself </br>  <br>I feel kinda sad that the artist had to draw in the shadows for Sucy.

There are some shots where the animation doesn't always seem quite finished, but I wouldn't want to be presumptuous enough to assume I can tell whether or not they are intentionally that way...</br></br>  I really loved it, even more than the first one. This should be a series, too bad it's impossible.  <br>Why aren't all those kids dead?</br>  <br>It's not shooting by itself now is it?</br>  <br>They weren't really trying to hurt them and their power was nerfed anyway because they weren't near the Sorcerer's Stone.</br>  <br>Semi-auto = 1 trigger pull, 1 shot.

Semi-auto is a weird workaround to divide automatics into burst-fire and not.</br>  <br> gets put up deserves nothing but contempt until it can prove itself otherwise. <br>Which Trigger did with the first LWA. Without it, I wouldn't had backed them two years ago. Imagine trying to justify backing LWA if Trigger only work up to that point was Inferno Cop.</br></br>  Was it worth the weight?  <br>I see, that makes sense.</br>  Thank you all backers in this thread.<br><br>I wasnt able to this time due to funds but enjoyed it thanks to your efforts! <br>i'll make sure to contribute for the next one if it gets a kickstarter again.</br></br></br>   Akko - Harry Potter <br> Lotte - Ron <br> Sucy - Hermoine <br> Amanda - Cho <br> Constanze -  <br> Jasminka -  <br> Diana - Draco  <br> Hanna and Barbara - The Draco fat twins <br><br>everything is better as little girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>semi auto reloads semi automatically<br>you pull the trigger and it shoots, you pull again and it has reloaded and shoots one bullet again<br><br>full auto means the reloading cycle will work and therefor the gun will shoot until you let the trigger go or it runs out of ammo<br><br>no auto means you have to manually reload after every shot, bolt action etc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  That was really fucking good, based Trigger.

It isn't like we're digging through a decade or two of previous works.<br><br>I also got to argue that making a game is harder*. The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

The /a/ I knew is dead.</br></br>  would you be ok if these never became a full anime but were just ovas that were released every 2 to 3 years but with the same quality?  <br>Nigga did you not read the backer rewards? Did you not check the rewards for your tier?</br>  <br>It's a /tv/ joke</br>  <br>They thought it was broken, maybe the rod chooses its user.</br>  <br>Philippines albino witch doctor</br>  <br><br> being this new </br></br>  <br>better version</br>  We still need a third movie to deal with Chariot's story; we still don't know what the Shiny Rod is or what made Ursula quit her show.  So, let's get this straight. She did absolutely nothing, right?  <br>not <br> you're gonna swallow that load </br></br>  <br>She was adorable. That's good enough for me.  But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  If the point of their school is to prevent dumb teenagers from using their dumb powers to do dumb things, why was this guy allowed to cause thousands of dollars worth of collateral damage chasing after somebody who wasn't even running all that fast?<br><br>I get that MC was cheating at things and maybe hurt some peoples feelings or something, but this guy wrecked several uninvolved places for no real reason. And then he claims the moral high ground???<br><br>also imouto best girl</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a dumb LN/VN or whatever it is.</br>  Imouto of the season!  Is this the Plastic Memories of the season?  <br>That's a dumb post/reply or whatever it is.</br>  The MC is a faggot and the love interest is a dumb bitch, its like the imouto was made to be the only likeable character  by my point of view... i fucking hate that tomori-slut , and the the Mc is a good-looking guy faggot with no real ability or good intelligence (at least he know how to use his useless gift)... give me back a genius like Inaho Kaizuka right now!!  <br>As in best original of the season? Absolutely.</br>  <br>No. It might be good.</br>  <br>As in AoTS? You bet.</br>  <br><br>No, this is X-men.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br>ebin</br></br>  <br> Plastic memories <br> best anything <br>Good one.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked as far as establishing just how fucked his power is. There was no other way besides show and proving.</br>  <br><br>So the word "faggot" is pretty much interchangeable with "person I don't like"?<br><br>I'll just going to go ahead and assume you guys hating the MC are just haremshitters who can't self-insert.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am the only one who just wanted 12 episodes of MC being a smug asshole?<br> Fuck that bitch and her prison school.<br> At least I hope MC doesn't lose his assholery completely, just becomes a little bit nicer or something, because I was really enjoying such an unusual MC.</br></br></br>  <br>  Fuck that bitch and her prison school. <br><br>It's totally reasonable. Power users need to be controlled.</br></br></br>  All of the characters are really unlikeable, especially the MC.  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>How can MC have such a rotten personality when he has a little sister like that?</br>  <br>o-okay</br>  <br><br>Who knows.<br><br>At least he's a good big brother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than shitline, hipster.</br>  <br>that guy is a useless "person i don't like" that will probably screw the whole series with his fagotter... i mean personidontlikeness :I , no really the only hope is that "probable Broth" that he could have , this will give us some kind of emotionals hit and onionshinobis like the peoples from air-clannar-etc would do ... so<br>Who said about the plastic memories of the season ?... well screw that , screw this anime , i'm going to stick to some other trash like Gate rather than this one!</br></br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br> It's reasonable but I find it weird how this faggots are fine with being imprisoned and kept under surveilance 24/7.<br> If it wasn't for his imouto, I would expect MC to just control her, destroy the camera and tell them to go suck a dick. Not like he can't start all over again or find a new way to have fun with his powers.<br> I mean, you get cool powers that will only work for a few years and instead of having some fun with them you choose to waste those precious years in a place where they will restrict your use of those powers? That's fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly makes him a faggot? If he was you're run of the mill, plain jane MC then he'd be a beta faggot. There's apparently no middle ground.</br>  Waiting for the proper subs. Fucking when!?  <br>The opinion of the minority is not worth anything anyway.</br>  <br> reason and logic <br> anime <br>Logic consistency is something I'd never look for a series like this and for the person in charge of the writing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He didn't have a choice, there was also a guy with super speed and he would still need to find a way to avoid being expelled.</br></br>  <br>What's wrong with HS?</br>  <br>When MC gets his shit pushed in for being a faggot.</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  Rin is the cutest!  <br>But that is Ruri.</br>  GX &gt; Arc V  <br>this gave me a hardy chuckle</br>  Ruri~  Gon is keeping Benni's duel disk, right? It'd be a shame if someone wanted to take a look at his deck.  <br>They brought their decks with them though, just not their duel disks.</br>  Best dimension invading when?  <br>Not fair, shirtless Yuu when</br>  <br>Remember when Dennis gave cards to the lunch ladies so they would give Gon's goons some food?<br><br>Those cards were Polymerization and Instant Fusion</br></br></br>  <br>Never, dem bitches getting invaded instead.</br>  <br>You should be ashamed of your lewd thoughts!</br>  <br> best dimension <br> fusion <br>laffin</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was Negate Attack and Wonder Wand.</br>  Shun had a hard life  <br> Negate attack <br> Wonder wand  <br>Those are some pretty trash cards.</br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit<br>Negate Attack &gt; Mirror Force</br></br>  <br>Wasn't it Magical Stone Excavation?</br>  <br>The trash effect monster Gottoms was considered rare.

Your friend is now a spirit guide, kinda like they did in two previous Yugioh series except for some reason he doesn't do shit. He likes to talk about smiles though.</br>  <br>Shun remember when you said you would beat Yuto if he got in your way? Good news.</br>   Yuto isn't aware Yugo isn't evil <br> He contacts Shun through spooky ghost powers and tells him what he did <br> Shun seeks revenge for him <br> Duels Yugo and fucks him up <br> Yuya appears <br> Tries to explain Yugo isn't evil and it's just a misunderstanding  <br> Absorbs Yugo </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuto could have lived and had another ally if he pronounced Yuugo's name correctly </br>  I'am surprised they are waging on only 3 elites to handle Neo New Sawatari Underworld troupe deck, still is unlikely they can beat him as long he gets his pendulum cards turn 1 since we all know pendulum summoning is THE BEST.    Jesus that Gusto doujin.  Tell me anon why does she wanna be DA PERFECT  <br>I just realized Yuto is the Atem, Winged Kuriboh/Yubel, etc. of Arc-V.<br><br>Well I'm stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Well let's see what Sawatari amd his Underworld Troupe has accomplished so far.<br>In episode 48 he removed a monster and damaged somebody by 500 points, but that only resulted in a trap happening that only brought the monster back and damaged him and his partners even more.<br>In episode 56 he just straight up lost by means so prompt and so embarrassing it wasn't worth going into details over, and in Episode 62 he managed to put a monster on a boat.<br><br>I'm starting to think Sawatari really is a joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kinda wish he was, because giving an hourly reminder to smile doesn't really compare to Atem/Astral/etc.</br>  <br>Will Underworld Troupe get released in Breaker of Shadows? (I hope the set code either BROS or BOSS)<br>More importantly, will we finally get Moonlights?</br></br>    <br>Different Dimension Dicking</br>  <br>I want this one.<br>Though I'm not sure if there are many worthwhile level 11 monsters that can be freely special summoned.</br></br>  <br> THE MAN Gongenzaka sets the best possible scales <br>Now THAT'S alpha.</br></br>  <br>The Pendulum statues are never gonna get released.<br>It would be interesting if Yuzu's bracelet recontract universe'd her pendulums into being Melodious support</br></br>  <br>Name?</br>  <br>Well he's definitely Winged Kuriboh, his weird noises are smiles.</br>   Break out your Elemental Hero deck and get ready to duel!

If Arc-V was on crunchyroll I'd watch it and would no longer need to wait for subs</br>  <br> I eat shit and I pay for it because it's legal </br>  <br>We're all pirates who use AQUA decks here scrub, I bet you use non-AQUA decks huh?<br><br>Nerd.</br></br></br>  <br> Being this mad </br>  <br> calling someone that doesnt torrent a nerd <br>The acceptable terms here are "filthy causal" or "normalfag".</br></br>  <br> using those words <br><br>FIRE deck bitch I see.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> streaming  <br>Kill self etc. etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seeing Yuya get his asshole torn open by Jack probably isnt the way Yuzu wanted to see him again.</br>  <br>Does that mean Aqua Actresses are the official deck of these threads.</br>  <br> tfw Yugo ends up beating Jack though and she is torn between her new bad boy and her old soft toy </br>  <br>No, I do it because I believe that if you get enjoyment out of somebody else's work, you should try and support it somehow.<br>Crunchyroll is cheap, so I don't mind paying a bit for it.<br>If you think that's bad dumb, good for you. I'll just have you know I have no problem with downloading.</br></br></br>  <br>Those are some pretty trash cards.</br>  <br>Who do you think pushed Konami to add those and Teppei's cards?</br>  <br> those things were printed <br> Phantom Knights, Moonlights, and Underworld Troupe have no signs of being printed </br></br>  Will Reiji enter the Friendship Cup? Would he be able to beat Jack?  <br>Take that back</br>  <br>Teppeis cards are partly DM nostalgia stuff<br>Aqua Actresses are kind of random, but maybe they wanted some shitty new water cards to go with Atleantean Prince fuccboi</br></br>  <br> Crunchyroll supports the animators </br>    <br>Moonlight will get printed eventually because all waifu decks do. UT will also since it has pendulums, because PENDULUMS.<br><br>He'd have by far the best shot at doing it outside of Yugo who is just Yusei but adorably dumb. Also no he probably wont enter the Friendship Cup.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I remember Teppei's cards, but you're right, they were pushed because of the Atlantean OCG shit.</br>  <br>I hope you don't actually believe they pay animators in any shape or form.</br>   watching Ushio to Tora <br> hear Yuma's VA as the MC <br> and then hear Kotori's VA as the main girl <br> mfw I look it up and I wasn't just imagining things </br></br></br>  <br><br>There's obviously going to be a rematch where Yuya wins</br></br>  <br>As much as I love Yuuya, I dread this</br>  <br>Shit I just noticed, that Yusei and Yuya will be the only protags to beat the KINGU</br>  <br>Normally, the rival of a series doesn't show up in another to duel again. Unless you count Kaibaman.</br>  <br>Yuya has nothing that can beat Jack.</br>  <br>Vortex ;)</br>  <br>Dark Rebellion</br>  Yuya seems to have common things with the other protagonists:<br><br>Yugi: Atem<br>Yuya: Ancient Dragon/Dark Soul in him<br><br>Judai: Loves Tanoshi duels, will risk everything to save a person he likes<br>Yuya: Likewise <br><br>Yusei: Being good friends with Jack and crow<br>Yuya: Eventually he'll be in good terms with Jack, Crow already likes him<br><br>Yuma and Yuya are also the youngest protagonists</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DEF-pendulum stalling.<br><br>Plus action cards. If Yuya plays Crossover as a field spell from his hand, you know they're gonna get them in motorcycles.</br></br></br>  <br>Even so, he'll come up with something, either way Yuya and Jack will have a rematch in which Yuya will win</br>  <br> Yuya has nothing that can beat Jack. <br>Jacks deck was fucking shit</br></br>  <br> Crow already likes him <br>And yet he still wasn't chummy enough to include the Lancers in the escape plan from the start without Gon pressuring him to spill the beans</br></br>  <br>Also Yuya's overall design bears resemblance to Yugi's.<br> Ancient magic necklace <br> Uniform worn like a cape <br> Choker <br><br>They both also seem like softies despite their appearances.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 jaku has piercing damage</br>  YAMEROOOOO  BA BA BA BURN  <br>I want the new Goyos and Ancient Gears to get released</br>  <br>Ëñ´È¢®„ÅÆÊπøÂú∞Â∏Ø</br>  MIRAKURU MIRUKU  <br>Don't start that. I just got that song out of my head this month. I don't want it back.</br>  <br>LET'S START</br>    <br> Will Underworld Troupe get released in Breakers of Shadows? <br>I'm confident that yes, they will. I don't know how to explain but many things points out to their release soon.<br><br>Moonlights may wait a little longer though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://<span>youtu.be/nEk5Eudltu4  [ ]</br>  <br> Isshun no senk≈ç kara</br>  <br>BOKU NO YUME</br>  <br>He's got a new Ace now.</br>  <br>Ano kumo wo tsukinukete mabushƒ´ yume wo aozora ni egak≈ç</br>  <br> no Fang of Critias <br>Man if only Yami's dub voice wasn't pure sex, I'd have no reason to watch it</br></br>  The YGO anime Twitter has .2k followers until 30k <br>WHICH MEANS JACK AND CROW MANZAI CHIBIS SOON</br>  <br> That Shun <br>Every fucking time</br></br>  Why do the writers hate this guy so much?  <br>Are you joking they have a raging hard on for him. After all he is best boy.</br>  <br>what is she saying?</br>   Yuzu in the cast list <br>She's going to see Yuya duel the KINGU.</br>  <br> took away his people <br> kidnapped his sister <br> destroyed his homeland <br> made him relive said destruction twice already <br> removed his best friend  <br> made him DDDDDDDDDDD's tool </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I forget, does Yuzu know Yuya is in Synchro?</br>  <br> Yuma's VA <br>To be fair, I read a bit about the manga, and it wasn't that bad. But choosing Yuma's VA? Fucking really?<br><br>I'm sorry, I don't have any choice but to dropped Ushio to Tora.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope<br>I wish I could give Yuya a hug, he's gonna get rekt beyond belief</br></br>  <br>Yuya will eclipse Judai in the end.<br><br>I mean, seriously, this arc ends in literally anything but Yuya and Yuzu being reunited.<br><br>Yuzu gets sent off to prison, Yuzu gets kidnapped by Yuri, Slifer Red invades and Yuzu ends up with them through a wacky MISUNDERSTANDING, Yugo and Yuya go full DRAGON, Reiji acts like a dick, Bennis goes Ballistic...<br><br>Bad end city.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuya impregnating Yuzu when? <br><br><br>Nope.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I really doubt this would happen. If it was Yugo though, he could maybe beat King.</br></br>  <br>No, she doesn't. Seeing Yuya duel KINGU will probably kick her ass into first gear.</br>  Can't remember, was it ever explained how Yuto and Shun were able to get to the standard dimension?  <br>Willpower</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you so sure about that? Did you really hate Jack that much, or you're just fanboying Yuya too much?</br></br></br>  <br>Their duel discs let them dimension hop.</br>  <br>Makes sense</br>  <br> he's one of the strongest duelists defeating LDS teachers and top students <br> he's the goddamned BATMAN <br><br>His suffering only adds to his dark persona.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want Jack to be beat, even with my intense Yuuya fanboying, but it's going to happen. Yuuya's the MC, he's gonna surpass everyone that isn't a previous MC sometime down the line.</br>  <br> Yuuya's the MC, he's gonna surpass everyone that isn't a previous MC sometime down the line. <br>Well just want to let you know that I screencapped all your post, so that I can laugh at you for being over confidently wrong.<br><br>See you at the end of Arc V!</br></br></br></br>  I can see the Yuya vs KINGU duel being the precursor to Yuya vs Yugo duel.  <br>Will we ever see him laugh? <br>Alright Captcha how the hell is an empty plate considered food?</br></br>  Alright /a/rc-V<br> Best girl <br> Best boy <br> Best card <br> Best duel <br> Best soundtrack <br> Best   meme </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ruri <br> Shun <br> Rise Falcon <br> Shun vs Sora 1 <br> The Evolving Falcon <br>   YAMEROOOOOO </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Best girl <br>Yuzu<br><br> &gt;Best boy <br>Shuzo, the world owes him for fathering Yuzu<br><br> &gt;Best card <br>Creation Magician<br><br> &gt;Best duel <br>Yuzu vs Yuya<br><br> &gt;Best soundtrack <br>Yuzus trumpets<br><br> &gt;Best meme <br>Making cards that look like Yuzu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuya<br>Shun<br>Dark Rebellion<br>Shun vs Sora 1<br>Something to Protect<br>Bane?<br><br>Shun will you be my boyfriend</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br> Yuya <br> ODD-EYES REBELLION DORAGON <br> Shun vs Sora <br> Duel of Rebellion <br>   YUGO JA NE </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuuya~~~<br>Shun~~~</br>  <br>He's already getting there with the whole willing to abandon his friends for Yuzu and seeing hallucinations of Yuzu. At this rate he's gonna cry about Yuzu to Jack.</br>  <br> Jack walks up and punches him <br>Oh god I'd be heartbroken and laughing my ass off at the same time</br></br>  <br> Scarright Dragon! Direct attac... Why are you crying? <br> Yu.. Yuzu used to clobber me with her crude strong arms as well! </br></br>  <br>You realize crunchy subs are uploaded to nyaa right?</br>  <br>Anyone have this in something better than 2 frames per hour?</br>  <br>In the form of HorribleSubs, yes. Still doesn't justify streaming.</br>  <br>But you're not streaming. You are downloading their subs and watching them.</br>  <br>Nobody said anything about sub quality</br>  <br>But I am bashing streaming, not downloading. Are you missing something here?</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Still doesn't justify streaming  <br><br>What's the difference? You are still watching the same subs. Why is downloading the subs and then watching them on your computer instead of simply watching the exact same subs online seen as a superior complex?</br></br></br>  <br>Why not? Crunchyroll releases a sub 1 hour after it broadcasts in Japan and it's in HD.</br>  <br>I never thought Yuma's VA was that bad. Not super great, but he uses a lower pitch for Ushio than Yuma if that makes anything better. I just thought it was a funny coincidence. <br><br>First episode of the show was pretty good overall, too. It's a little like what Kotori and Yuma's dynamic might have looked like if there was a little more effort put into it, even though it's the typical 'tsun girl calls main guy a baka' sort of thing.</br></br></br>  <br> oooh watcha say </br>  5Ds manga guy here. Anybody want me to start working on uploading Volume 2? I would have had it up sooner, but I had to move some stuff around and need an electrician to continue scanning.  <br>Cause it's not a superior complex. There are multiple advantages over streaming by downloading.<br><br><br>Only for paying users.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No watermarks from shitty streaming sites <br> Can use hardware acceleration to improve quality  <br> Can watch the episode without an internet connection. <br>Not that guy but the difference is clear.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Only for paying users <br><br>Of course. The fact that you shun streaming yet you download the subs that came from the stream sites is hypocrisy.</br></br></br>  <br>We are talking about streaming. Not subtitle quality.</br>  <br> Can watch the episode without an internet connection. <br>You need an internet connection to download the episode<br><br>And we are talking about Crunchy, who don't have watermarks and only require you to pay an INCREDIBLY small fee which is justified.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crunchyroll is a streaming site.</br>  <br>No shit. What's your point?</br>  <br>But I don't actually use HS.</br>    <br> Will we ever see him laugh? <br><br>One day, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I download FFF. Checkmate atheists.</br>  <br>Serena of all time and forever<br>Reiji<br>Clear Wing<br>Shun vs. Sora 1, Reiji vs. Yuya 2, Sawatari vs. Yuya 2, I'll give the edge to Shun vs. Sora 1<br>DDD<br>YUGO JA NE or the constant &gt;Yuzu gonna snap at Yuya or &gt;Shun will never be happy is gonna get carded</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel bad that Yuya is going to get beat down by the King, but I feel good that Yuzu is finally going to know that Yuya is in Synchro.  <br>Yuya pls leave</br>   people actually defending streaming <br>what has the world gone to.<br> i hope you stream retards dont think that you arent downloading anything by streaming. have you cleaned your cache folder today? </br></br>  <br>Yuya pls marry me</br>  <br>You just said we aren't talking about subtitle quality. We are talking about streaming, and I said Crunchyroll is a site for streaming. Say you insult somebody for streaming GX's or 5D's crunchy subs but then you still download the crunchy subs via HorribleSubs on nyaa. That's hypocrisy. <br><br>Downloading Crunchy's subs yet bashing someone who rather watch the same subs online makes you sound like a dumbass<br><br>If someone rather watch the exact same episode with the exact same subs online than doing what you do and download the subs and watch them on your own time, then that's fine. They could use that time that you would spend downloading the episode, watching it online.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Yugo gets sad that Yuzu leaves him <br> tfw it triggers him the same way Rin 'left' </br></br>  Could Jack beat Serious Gil?  <br> Yugo getting jelly <br>Probably going to happen. NTR-V is real.</br></br>  <br>None of that fee goes to the original staff. Streaming is never the answer, you're just trying to justify wasted money.</br>  is shun the batman of arc v?  <br>Batman doesn't attack innocent people.</br>  <br>Well, I'm just happy Yugo and Yuzu will have actually things to do now.<br><br>Even if it is a retarded tournament arc.</br></br></br>  <br>RIP nameless LDS employees who were lost to the wind forever. At least Marco-sensei and Hokuto are sitting safely in a drawer somewhere.</br>  <br>Not that anon but downloading the episodes or subs online is just as bad. Just as bad as people downloading music online.</br>   Shun finally meets up with Ruri <br> She doesn't recognize him <br> Leo used the same brainwashing technique that Reiji did against Masumi and friends <br> Acts like Sora has been her ally from the start </br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> Yuzu snap at Yuya <br>That would never happen.<br><br>What could happen is Edge Yuya accidentally hurting Yuzu, as the same thing was hinted to happen with Yuto and Ruri, but even then I don't think Yuzu would snap at Yuya.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure if he hugs and kisses her, the memories will come rushing back.</br>  <br>She's your sister, Shun.</br>  <br>When I say streaming, I mean the actual video quality, the framerate, the resolution. Not some fucking words on a screen. In fact, you are making yourself look like a retard for not getting the point after all this time. <br><br>Also, people download HF subs because there is no faster and consistent subbing group substitute. Take the time when SNAFU was airing. CommieSubs churned their episodes out a full day earlier than any other subbing group. Their episodes were watched more than HorribleSubs and even got Nyaa's blue seal of approval.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Reiji is. Reiji has a NEET cave, a boy sidekick, overwhelming power, prep time, and keikkaku. All Shun has is acrobatics, gadgets, and fights. <br><br>Shun is like Nightwing, the first of Reiji's pupils grown up. Sawatari was the next to enter the cave, he's the second Robin, I forget his name because he sucks and unfortunately so does Sawatari right now, Reira is the next boy wonder.</br></br></br>  <br> he doesn't hug and kiss his sister </br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>Will this ever be available for download though? I still don't think there is a rip of Crunchy's 5D's subs. <br><br>Chances are good that these subs will be the far superior subs for GX though.</br></br></br>  <br>cards that are available in standard polyimerization was a card in the first anime</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4827753  <br> allowing people to votebot </br>  <br>The subs for GX are fine though as long as your'e not using gx_st. I believe there was an anon taking the better subs and throwing them over the DVD rips.</br>  <br> Sawatari was the next to enter the cave, he's the second Robin, I forget his name because he sucks and unfortunately so does Sawatari right now <br><br>You mean Tim Drake?</br></br></br>  <br>Someone on NAC is ripping the crunchy subs for 5D's and an anon recently fitted dvd raws of GX with GLL99's subs  https://mega.co.nz/#F!UZEESKjB!8XT8<wbr>uUu5_j9k57Jyvdz34Q</wbr> </br>  <br> I believe there was an anon taking the better subs and throwing them over the DVD rips <br>There was, and he finished, subs are pretty great</br></br>  <br>I guess, I don't remember the Robins other than Nightwing.</br>  <br>He was the third, second died.</br>  <br>Jason Todd.</br>  <br>Oh sorry, then it was Jason Todd.</br>   Sawatarifags still salty <br>My favorite characters are Yuzu and Yugo, and they've been off-screen putting up posters for the last month. At least your boy got screentime.</br>  <br>YUZU PUTTING UP POSTERS? SIGN ME THE FUCK UP FOR THAT EPISODE KAMISHIRO-SAMA</br>  <br>Oh that's good news that he finished. Is it up on nyaa or what? I'm interested in checking out an episode or two to see how he did.</br>  Is it just me or does it make Arc-v a little more likable when Yuya‚Äôs mostly treated as another member of the group like all the others or the voice of reason, rather than being the leader with people clinging to his heels, and we all know how the latter situation ended up for most of the protagonist. They even have the main rival being the leader.  <br>Ebina pls</br>    <br>It was a mega folder, you should be able to find it in the archive, the name he used was something along the lines of GX subber Anon</br>  <br>see</br>  <br><br>It`s here<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>One of my favorite things about Arc-V. It feels more like an ensemble with a focus on one certain character than it does "14 year old's quest to become Card Jesus"</br>  <br>I remember seeing this way back, and thinking "of course I fucking would, and I'd download a house to go along with it".</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons, I completely missed that post.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh. This arc has been the Yuya and Shun show, with Selena, Gon, and Sawatari starring as glorified meatfields and/or distractions.</br>  <br>My dreams of the Yugo and Yuzu show have been crushed. But at least we're diving right into the Friendship Cup, and with a name like what could possibly go wrong?</br>  <br>Hey at least Sawatari got a piece of Serena multiple times. Why do you think she had to duel so much? It was like her after sex cigarette.</br>  <br>Sawatari pls</br>  <br>Shingo, your delusions are starting to get out of control.</br>  <br>(Ko)Tori's dub voice actress was the same as dub Iris in Pokemon BW.<br>Annoying main girl in both big "kiddie" animu of 2011-2013. How pitiful.</br></br>  <br>Please what? Want me to get my father to pull a few strings for you?</br>  <br>When you download an episode from a fansub group you are directly supporting them. Do you think they do this for free?</br>    <br>Why does nobody believe me, why else would she be sent to her own special cell away from me? I'm too handsome for her to resist.</br>  So according to summaries, Yuya and Pals DON'T escape from Prison, but Reiji strikes up a deal with Jean Michel.<br><br>As a show of good will, the Lancers are entering the Friendship Cup.<br><br>We all know Reiji is going to stab Jean Michel in the back and say "Checkmate" or "PERSONALLY I PREFER CARD GAMES", but for now he and the Lancers are on the side of the oppressive regime. <br><br>Sasuga, Akaba.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More like Reiji made a bet with him that if even one of his Lancers win the friendship cup and beats Jack they'll ally with him against Fusion and all crimes pardoned.</br>  So Jack is for sure staying along right? I don't see how Reiji would pass up taking him along unless Jack literally tells him to suck his dick for him to go along.<br> And even then </br>  <br>God I hope not.</br>  <br>Could be some Dragon Age bullshit where Jack will join for the final battle.<br><br>Honestly that will be for the best, because Gundam Seed Destiny style plot will kill development for everyone who isn't Shun</br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu pls contain your raging girl boner for Yuya pls and go shill some new Melodious/Fantasia tunas and synchros so you can powa up your tomato husbando's deck with solitaire powa for his inevitable rematch against KINGU.</br>  <br> Tfw no cute baka blonde dream boy to cuddle </br>  <br> Yuzu pls contain your raging girl boner for Yuya  <br>This is harder to do than you realize Reiji</br></br>  <br>Suffering isn't it Serena?</br>  <br>Though to be fair, Yuya has created or possesses 3 waifu cards in the anime, 4 if you count Master of Pendulum and Noble/Superior Dragon Magician who is the most usable of the Yuzu waifu cards out of her, Trump Witch, Helprincess, and Creation/Synthesis Magician. How many more Yuzu waifu cards will he create before the end of ARC-V?</br>  <br>What is it with hungry Serena and why do they fanartists portray her like that?</br>  Is Arc-V the first yugioh series not to have an awful second season since the original?  <br>Until his entire deck is Yuzu.wav.</br>  <br>The entire first two episodes of Synchro were all about Yugo and showing how great at riding duels he is</br>  <br>Serena has a literal waifu deck though</br>  <br>Because her being a spoiled princess and just wanting snacks is adorable.</br>  <br>Eh, Synchro started good but it got pretty shitty after the first City episode</br>  <br>Serena is actually a Hungry Burger card</br>  <br>Depends on who you ask. Despite only being ~10 episodes, people will declare Synchro to be gutter trash. Personally I don't really have any major issues to pick with it so far.</br>  <br>So far that seems to be the case</br>  <br>So, if Shun is the new Yusei and Crow, will he be the one to beat Jack and re-ignite his Burning Soul?</br>  <br>I'm not a huge fan of Synchro, but I'm sure the Friendship Cup will be hype.</br>  <br>Shun is the new Crow. Yugo is the new Yusei. Jack is the glorious KINGU.</br>  <br>I'd much rather have something like Yugo vs Yuya be the 'big duel' at the end of FC and see more about what's up with the summoning method dragons than a Jack rematch.</br>  <br>We'll find out now that we're out of boring Prison.<br><br>Then again, I'm a simple man. I just want some Yuzu episodes and for my nigga Sawatari to get past the first round.</br></br></br>  <br>The first two episodes with Reiji VS Yuya were great<br><br>Then it got pretty shitty when Yuya VS Yoko was made into a two parter and it was literally a 3-turn flashback duel<br><br>Things looked like it would get great with the Yuzu and Yugo episode but the Riding Duel episode probably turned a lot of people off, including me<br><br>The Lancers VS Security episode was really shit<br><br>The Dennis VS Gongenzaka and Dennis VS Shun Riding Duel episodes were great<br><br>Then the Crow VS Yuya episode was really stupid<br><br>The first Prison episode was also pretty shit<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127581061#p127602021">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yugo/Yuya will be highlight if it happens.</br>  <br>Sasuga Neo New Man</br>  <br>People didn't like the riding duel episode?

I'm in love.<br>I haven't read the manga but I hope  she gets gored to death while screaming and crying. </br>  <br> It almost happens on multiple occasions </br>  <br> That may even be better. I just want to see her crying and in pain, so it happening multiple times will only make my dick harder. </br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br>Read it now.</br>  <br>I'm going to Japan at the end of next week, so I've been holding off on picking up any new manga until I can buy some volumes while I'm over there.</br>  <br> Zombie apocalypse in a grimdark world <br>God damn.

It's kind of inevitable.<br><br>It actually only takes about a night to catch up to the current chapter and is a fucking fantastic read, so yeah. Same goes for any other lurkers wondering if they could watch the anime and not get spoilered; basically you'd probably have to stay out of the threads altogether.</br></br></br>  Is this yuri?  <br>No. It's full-blown zombie apocalypse.</br>  It's over. Impressions are rolling in on Twitter now. So far all I've been able to glean is that it's heart pounding.  https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%81<wbr>%8C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%93%E3%81%86%E3%8<wbr>1%90%E3%82%89%E3%81%97&amp;src=typd&amp;ver<wbr>tical=default&amp;f=tweets<br><br>Twitter's getting excited</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  https://twitter.com/Tamashari/statu<wbr>s/617238353855934464<br><br>Uh oh.</br></br></wbr>  I really hope I'm google translating some of these tweets wrong.  So is this some Madoka wanabe?  <br>This is the dumbest thing I've heard all day.</br>  <br>The actual mangaka wrote the screenplay for this though, so changes from the original were totally his call to better fit things; I bet he had a goal of having the anime end on Graduation at all costs.<br><br>Besides some of the early chapters weren't exactly good in my honest opinion; it kind of dragged for a bit while waiting for the "fucking duh" moment of Miki joining.</br></br></br>  Cute<br><br><br>How so?</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is cute!</br>  <br> tfw you'll never have a megu-nee tulpa </br>  <br>Believe, anon!</br>  <br>That doesn't say that Miki is with the group from the beginning, does it?</br>  <br>Megu isn't dead. Miki starts out with them. That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible.</br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible. <br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br>That's what I gathered.<br><br><br>Now that I don't believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku's with the group since the beginning. <br> The reveal at the end of the episode hit harder than the manga's. </br></br>  <br>Well, if you want to see her suffer, you're  in luck. </br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Explain why she's not in any promo art then.</br></br>  Just read the latest chapter.<br> Rii rescued her little sister in a swarm full of zombies, who survive months just by hiding  <br><br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  Twitter's responses seem for the most part very positive. Even with some changes to the manga's plot, the anime is looking like it'll be good.  <br>No shit it's bullshit. Think harder.</br>  <br>It's the teddy bear anon, she's just delusional. Why do you think Yuki is the only one to react while Kurumi and Miki look on worryingly?</br>  <br>Maybe don't skim through it so quickly next time.</br>   Finally get a loli <br> I-It's just a bear! <br>Fuck that shit. I won't believe it until it's 100% confirmed.</br></br>  <br>I'm much more worried that she got fucking bitten in the process and was expecting to see a mark revealed anytime. What does she even do about zombies again? I don't even remember if she uses the flares a lot or had some noise maker, basically only Miki and Kurumi can actually hold their own alone so I assume full and well that Rii's fucked.</br>  <br>Please don't start.</br>  <br>Is this moe/yuri shit?</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>She hoses down zombies early on to save Kurumi, and she uses the glowsticks constantly.</br>  <br>Yes, better leave now.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks anon, I'll stay far away from this garbage.</br>  <br>Start what? I'm not calling the rest of them lolis like the shitposter. Ruu is a loli though.</br>   https://twitter.com/MAJ_Karso/stat<wbr>us/617241201838718976</wbr> <br> loose character animation <br>Google translates "yuru" as "loose", so I'm not sure if this post referencing the SoL fakeout or bad animation<br><br>Another post used the same "loose" yuru and made it sound like a reference to the SoL fakeout https://twitter.com/efutty/status/6<wbr>17241893605277696</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I could help.</br>  <br> Rii thinks she hears her sister in the room somehow <br> No one else can hear shit no matter how they concentrate, while at the same time Rii is positive she heard someone <br><br>Wouldn't surprise me if Rii is also going looney. Her sister might have never even existed for all we know and she's going schizo or something inventing things; I don't see how she could have gone all this time and totally forget she even fucking existed until just a second ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not liking your chances. Chapter 36 spoiler.</br>  <br>ha ha holy shit</br>  <br>He used kana for "yuru" which suggests he doesn't mean "loose".</br>  <br>I'm always having a hard time reading between the lines, but damn can't believe she fucking snapped despite being the most rational one.</br>  <br>Fuckin google translating shit wrong</br>  <br>Why bother if you're just going to use google translate. It's completely wrong.</br>  <br>She snapped during the helicopter chapter</br>  What will it take to fix Rii?  <br>I'm trying to get some sense of what they're saying.</br>  <br>When she has to choose between saving either the teddy bear or one of her friends.</br>  <br> Miki starts out with them.  <br>Acceptable, although cutting off her life in the store and later rescue is a shame, i guess it's done to reach a decent halting point in 1 cour.<br> Megu isn't dead.  <br>That doesn't make much sense, if you have to cut stuff (see above) why do something like this that would add pieces? Unless it's going completely off-rails.<br> That one girl no one knew is the MC.  <br>Now that has to be fucking bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Where'd you get that?</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is the "girl no one knew" supposed to be? Kei? If so then basically I think we are going to see a condensed prologue (and basically a retcon from the author, in a tacit admitting that it took way too fucking long for Miki to officially join).</br>  <br><br>It's just obvious bait lads<br><br>Also, if Miki is with the group from the beginning, what happens with Kei? She has a character design for the anime and everything.</br></br></br></br>  https://twitter.com/mosaicwav/statu<wbr>s/617247520314396673<br><br>What staff role does MOSAIC.WAV have? I'm pretty sure they're not doing the OP or ED.</br></br></wbr>  <br>General OST, no?</br>  <br>You can't make a whole OST out of akibapop.</br>  So can someone who actually knows Japanese summarize for us  I have this thing where I go crazy for cute girls that seem normal on the outside but are actually partially insane on the inside.<br><br>I just want to hold her and tell her it's all going to be okay. <br><br>So what's really going to happen is that somehow she and the teddy bear gets separated, and so she goes out of her way to try and get the teddy bear back, which will result in bad things happening.</br></br></br></br>  Is there a thread on 2chan/futaba about this?  <br>Maybe the anime switches it up chronologically and starts after they save Miki, though her rescue is revisited in a flashback?</br>  <br>Maybe, all it is is that the bait and switch had to be extended from, what, eighteen pages to almost an entire episode, so maybe they just included Miki in the bait part just for the first episode.</br>  <br>You only just now come around to Rii for this and not fucking Yuki? <br><br>I kind of laughed when Miki chucked the pistol because I bet she thought at some point, "oh god, what if Yuki got her hands on this".</br></br></br>  My hunch is that the anime will end in the chapter where they left their school behind.  <br>First ep is probably all bait, then the ending it's revealed what's going on, then real shit starts 2nd ep.</br>  <br>How are they going to fit 30 chapters of a monthly manga into 12/13 episodes, especially considering episode one is just chapter one?</br>  <br>I bet she wished she didn't toss it now, with what's happened in the recent two chapters. Could have really made a difference, even if it was simply used for intimidation.</br>  is there a WEG about this?  <br>Skip some unimportant parts and revamp the pacing, it's not that hard to do in anime.</br>  <br>They'll ride off into the sunset / ominous desolate landscape in the camper, I'm like 90% sure of that. <br><br>I'm also wondering if they'll combine the initial field trip and radio-chan seeing that if Miki is not longer at the mall then that part would be kind of useless now. That also also address something that's bugged me in that they never turned on the radio for the mall field trip but did later after graduation; it's not really a plot hole, but just a bit contrived-feeling; without the mall trip happening so early on that can be fixed too.</br></br></br>    <br>It's not going to be a 1:1 adaptation, they've already announced they're going to "change" stuff and the author is working on the screenplay. They'll change, add and drop a lot of stuff so they can make it to that scene. Sadly, this makes it feel like they're not really planning on a S2, even if they sell decently.<br><br>Also, Miki is in every promotional art, even though they don't go to the mall until a lot of shit happens, meaning she'll probably appear a lot faster, if not from the beggining. That's already a sign of fast pacing.</br></br></br>  <br> You only just now come around to Rii for this and not fucking Yuki? <br>Yuki isn't physically attractive to me. On top of that, her crazy is the pantsu on head variant, whereas with Yuuri you can watch her slowly descend into her madness and I find it really attract ive, both her looks, personality and the entire process of her going insane.</br></br>  <br>I don't see something like this selling decently, so having an end at the end of the season would be good.</br>  Fuck, I really wish I could read this over for the first time again.  <br>I know it's kind of cynical but I hope it doesn't get really popular. I get's just popular enough for faster translations and a respectable amount of fanart.</br>  <br>I don't mind it being popular, so long as it's not popular in the west.</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>She's the Mami of the group.<br>Seems rational and mature, but it's mainly a facade put up for her friends which will lead into her snapping after one event too far.</br></br>  <br>What'd be particularly wrong about that? I mean, even with the zombies and focusing on drama, the fact that the character designs are the same sort of thing you'd see in moe SoL shows like Gochiusa and Kinmoza are huge limiting factors to Western popularity.</br>  <br>My hands were trembling bad the whole time for the couple chapters after Kurumi got her special gift from Megu-ne. I can't remember the last time any media got me that panicked; I really thought she wouldn't make it and was about to cry. I'm still beyond spooked at her current condition.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Right. It'll get brushed off and swept under the rug without a second glance by a lot because it must be "pandering moeshit"</br>  <br>Like the Hidamari art style was a barrier to Madoka being popular in the west?</br>  <br>I guess you're right. I hadn't thought of that. It probably was a limiting factor, but with these sort of things, once it goes beyond a certain point, it becomes self-sustaining and that factor stops being limiting in the same capacity.</br>  <br>until they know it has zombies so its going to turn in the walking dead 2.0</br>  <br>I can see it appealing to /co/ or /v/ types, maybe worse (.. edgy bronies or something), looking for some bridging excuse to get into moe designs without completely leaving their comfort zones. With this they can explain to their faggot friends "l-look I don't read it for the girls, you see it's really a brutal zombie story" etc. <br><br>Maybe I'm projecting/fearmongering too hard or something; hopefully I'm wrong. Realistically though I see the chances of this being actually done really well as an anime (as in feels like the manga) as less than 10%; it'll probably sell between 2-6k, 8k max etc but it doesn't matter as we'll still have the manga, of which I think the char designs are 10x better than the anime's anyway so it's no big deal.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been nervous ever since that happened. I don't know how she can be saved, or if she'll suddenly start twitching like the helicopter pilot, or if she'll get colder and look more and more like a corpse as time goes on, or what. I don't think any other story has made me feel so apprehensive. I want new chapters to hurry up and come out but at the same time I hope they're never released.</br>  <br>I think the heli pilot at least showed that apparently, you're fine as long as you keep re-dosing the medicine whenever symptoms come back bad. <br><br>Apparently it's hard to do it yourself though once your body starts to lose control, so, it might depends on whether anyone's close by her when it acts up again on whether she can re-dose to stave it off. Fuck, that brings up so many terrible possibilities, now I wish I hadn't thought of it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Higurashi all over again. Remember when people called it "Killer Lolis"?<br><br>This shit will be "zombie lolis xD" all over the internet if it gets popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, but imagine the journey during all of that. First, she'll get a little twitch or two every day, and she might brush it off as stress or that her muscles are fatigued. But over the course of a few days, it gets worse and worse, and she realizes what's going on. When someone notices and tries to say something about it, she'll brush it off with a laugh and change the subject. And then, a day or two later, it gets to the point where it can't be ignored. She spills water when trying to drink, has difficulty picking up food with a spoon, and then she almost breaks down because she can't do basic everyday functions and her body isn't hers any more. Someone gets the idea to reuse the medicine, and the twitch goes away. But that's not the end of the ride. With every dose, the medicine's effectiveness wears off. The time it takes for symptoms to show up decreases, and its intensity increases. Soon, it never completely goes away.<br><br>And then they have to abandon the RV with all of the medicine onboard in an incident.</br></br></br>    Why did Yuyushiki change it's name?  <br>And add a fourth main character.</br>  <br>and a shovel</br>  <br>And most importantly, twintails.</br>  <br>And even more importantly a  dog that fucking dies </br>  <br>Speaking of, I didn't see anyone on twitter mention the dog.</br>  <br>The dog doesn't come in till later, unless they do a flashback early.</br>  <br>I thought the dog would be there from the start, since it did have a significant presence in the artwork and the trailer. Even has its own character page.</br>  <br>It's probably just to fool people into thinking it's some slice of life. That dog only lasts for 3-5 pages in the manga.</br>  <br> bear plush with mustache in the promo </br>  So, official conclusion is, its shit with anime orignal plot?  <br>Could someone translate some of the comments?</br>  <br>What's wrong, don't you like cute harmless bears?</br>  <br>It sounds like it's going with an anime original plot, but not in a bad way.</br>  <br>But certainly not in a good way, either.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It could end up even better than the manga.</br>  So, it's shit right?<br><br>Damn.<br><br>Why couldnt they just follow the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why you're saying this so authoritatively.<br><br>Granted it's probably shit, but it's not certain.</br></br></br>   „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ„Åê„Çâ„Åó„Åå„Å©„Çì„Å™ÂÜÖÂÆπ„Åã„ÇíÊäΩË±°ÁöÑ„Å´‰æã„Åà„Çã„Å™„Çâ„ÄÅ„ÅäËä±Áïë„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´ÁÅ´ÁÇéÊîæ<wbr>Â∞ÑÂô®„ÅåÁΩÆ„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÇ„ÇãÊÑü„Åò</wbr> <br><br>wwwww</br></br>  <br>I've looked through a couple dozen but pretty much no one's talking about the actual content of the episode.

And I have read the original is the school Gurashi one episode for people who could not come to the prior screenings in rural areas. Ikansen snow is a lot scene running down the hallway, there may be a place where it is ambiguous place and wrong. Since the main are reading series might be some place you do not know where you're saying is people who do not read only book. (Example of the beard of flies were stuffed animals, etc.) <br><br><br> start from the scene where snow is sleeping peacefully in the futon. You have a beard of flies were stuffed example  <br>Taromaru is cause licking the snow. And it tries to wake everyone, but there are only snow in the bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of snow where snow trimmed the dressed. Snow running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. OP after Megu not the encounter. Megu downlink 's not not. To school life part of then it had arrived. Morning by adding the Me-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of one Volume eat the rice it has been modified to the scene. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Me-kun is not liked by Taromaru. Lee is scold Taromaru. Then introduced a scene that the original four volumes Nomi kun eat rice deliciously. Snow I impersonation eat deliciously. Snow toward the classroom for day duty. It can be stopped by to not Megu here. Shadow thin and is Ru dis. Character and conversation in the entourage two people and classroom ‚ë† of image. ‚ë° teacher also appeared.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Junior Nomi-kun comes to classroom lesson started, but it should but sleep in the beginning as class one volume is in class. Snow but say'm no good to come because in class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Me kun visited because gone is Taromaru. To Yukiwami kun says while walking to be "tense Me kun. Do will be nervous from entering the senior," but it is immediately denied. Looking Taromaru from here. Yukigami say tension has come undone and in-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Although if they closed the window could not be sure it was intentional sound effects) cries of Taromaru here. Voice I going to hear direction. <br><br> Here A part end. After Al CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Here from the B part <br>to chase the Taromaru but Taromaru is to enter the barricade front of the classroom with dexterity, but go towards the dead end (barricade of desks). Me-kun is also tries to enter the classroom is stopped and is said to be in class on snow. Confused look of Me-kun. Me kun enters the classroom from the greeting. However Taromaru the grabbed is not Taromaru getaway. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taromaru is directed to the roof. Go to the roof and walnut and joined a good capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel is walnut there are Lee again Taromaru and nephew foot race. But I get angry in Taromaru to Taromaru entered the rooftop garden. Angry to other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life part knowledge of the downlink. <br>Because you Taro capture, scene change school life part. Put lead in Taromaru. The contents of the combined content and 19 pages of from here on page 11. Snow to the classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Also Me kun became worried to act alone and decided to go after the snow. Descended of also "I like school recently." Snow will arrive in the classroom and the character we and Taromaru conversation about ‚ë†. While here in the real over-kun is coming, but the disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of here with snow roughness of pages 22-23 is Itemi kun in the classroom is the classroom door. Snow that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall together with the actual over-kun, also wind blows. I close the window because the window is left open. So snow of the face is made up ed rush. <br>ED after the next notice<br><br>Notice next time <br>Taromaru times ish. # 2 Memories</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   https://twitter.com/hail_st/status<wbr>/617279675769860096</wbr> <br> Gold Moza for novelty school Gurashi from one episode and I was bought enough to advance if promoted to not only despair gradually increasing despair </br>  <br>Contents of the episode.

Would marry.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're going to have to change her anime character design to get what you're hoping for, and that's asking too much, unfortunately. <br><br>It's something I can live with, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh god I didn't notice that</br>  <br>Its not like i have a problem with the anime design shovels still cute as fuck, i just still prefer the manga design.<br>I guess that's the case with almost all adaptions though.</br></br>    <br> mfw this is a fake opening and the real one is the dark, corrupted, bloody version of this with 28days later music </br>    <br>I like this new maymay</br>  <br> it gets darker and more corrupted with each episode </br>  Shovel a cute!<br>Would marry and repopulate the earth with.</br>  fuck   Shovel girls is slowly turning into a Zombie once the serum runs out <br> Onee-chan has become crazy <br>Pls no, someones going to die at this pace.</br></br>  <br> Shovel dies <br> disappears from opening </br></br>  <br>Shovel will never die!<br>  Because she's already undead ;_;  </br></br>  What changes did they make exactly? I don't want to panic, but is seems it's time to lose hope  <br>Far too lewd.</br>  <br>You're gonna do this every time, aren't you.<br>Not that i blame you, shovel is a goddess.</br></br>  <br>I expect that they added filler so they can finish the first episode with the twist.</br>  <br>I think Ep 2's gonna be the bait and switch. From what I read here, it seem to have ended in a good tone without the darkness that's gonna come.</br>   EVERYTHING <br> IS <br> FINE </br></br>  <br>I feel like my soul's being judged.</br>  <br> know nothing about this anime/manga <br> see the opening <br> look like healing anime <br> start learning more about it <br> start seeing page like this  <br> get scared, check wikipedia <br> &gt;Yuki seeks out fun school activities every day whilst Kurumi and Y≈´ri protect her, because in reality, they are the sole survivors of their school after a zombie outbreak overruns the city. <br>What the hell is that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well  says the reveal's at the end of the episode.</br>  <br>They look like frog's eyes.</br>  <br>Wait, Mikis with them from the start?<br>That's fucking stupid.</br></br>  <br>clearly not something for you, you fucking newfag.</br>   WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU   <br><br>With the extra characters they showed, I figured there was a high chance of anime original stuff.<br><br>They could still incorporate Miki's background into the story well. so all is not lost</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it'll still be good.<br><br><br>Damn, that hurts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if Miki's with them from the start her snapping at yuki for being delusional sounds like it would be out of place.<br><br>The anime is starting to scare me, i really hope they don't screw the story up.<br><br><br>Like i said in the previous post, i hope they make good of it being like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> While here in the real over-kun is coming, but the disturbing bgm.  <br> Snow that conversation alone. <br>Going by this, the reveal is indeed in the last minutes of the first episode. The second line probably means "Yuki is talking alone/to herself".</br></br></br>  <br> You couldn't guess the significance without having read the mango <br>That's why it's a good, subtle hint.</br></br>  <br>It hurts to watch.</br>  <br>I hope the next few episodes are a "one week earlier..." type of thing, so we can see when it was just the three of them and see Mii-kun's rescue.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br> Lerche <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br> Makes it look like shovel is walking around in a normal school with a shovel <br>That's way too cute, shovel moe best moe.<br><br>That zoom in on megu-nee looks like a reminiscence ;_;<br><br><br>That could work, but how the hell are they planning to do this while wasting an entire episode on SOL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's all over the first episode: </br>  Rii-chan is my waifu  <br>This is way too upbeat. They must be changing it later on.</br>  <br>You know, this really does not sound like just a generic moe SoL OP. It sounds almost too cutesy to the point of feeling artificial.</br>  <br>No, I don't think so. Think of Woto's ED. It's there for the contrast.</br>  <br>Shovel is my waifu!</br>  <br>Get ready for the storm of people calling her their waifu over the next few months.</br>  <br>The real ruse is that full show will be happy sol without zombies to make mangafags really mad.</br>  <br> Aijou Yuujou <br><br>But yeah, it'll probably change.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind this as much as you'd might think. Since I like the manga so much, I'd scrutinize the anime if it skipped over something or didn't do a scene as well as in the manga. But if it went full cutesy SOL, we'd get to see how their lives would have been like without the zombie apocalypse, which in turn make the manga that much more upsetting.</br>  <br>I got used to it a long time ago, there's already two of us in here.<br>Plus i don't care because they're all just seasonal waifu fags who move on to a new waifu once the shows done.<br><br><br>I would be fucking furious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I would be fucking furious. <br>But then you're waifu wouldn't become a walking corpse.</br></br>  <br>She also wouldn't be the same girl i fell for, would she?<br><br>  At least thats what my time travel movies tell me.  </br></br></br>  <br>He'd also get NTR'd by the track and field senpai that shovel had a crush on.</br>  <br>I'll bash that kids head in.<br>In secret of course.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't seem like it'd be too hard. Looks like a girl.</br>  <br>He honest to god looks like he belongs in Free! the clothing and all.</br>    There's something wrong with me, i cant stop watching the OP   and I'm enjoying it.    <br>If you've downloaded it and are playing it on MPC, hit ctrl + down arrow. Fun times.</br>  W-Will they all die at the end?  <br>Fake op. they'll change it at ep3 with Magia.</br>  <br>If they go for that sort of ending its likely that yukis gonna be the only one to survive.<br>;_;</br></br>  <br> yfw this is the actual OP for ep2 onwards </br>  <br> implying they're not already except Yuki </br>  <br>Oh my fucking christ.</br>  <br> they all die at the end besides Yuki and she gets saved and cherishes the graduation book <br><br>Oh god</br></br></br>  <br> anons react to the GG anime.png </br>  <br><br>pls no</br></br>  <br>I really want a happy end, but I can't see it happening.</br>  <br>Jesus anon don't make me think about that sort of shit ;_;<br><br><br>Haha, that's kinda accurate considering the dogs there for like 5 minutes and then's gone.<br>In the manga anyway, who knows about the anime.<br><br><br>Zombie stories VERY rarely have happy endings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just have to believe in the power of friendship, love, and the shovel.</br>  <br>Did they confirm the outbreak was worldwide or only in Japan? If it's only in Japan maybe there's a chance.</br>  <br>The happiest end I can see is one of them surviving.</br>  <br> Start from the scene that Yuki is sleeping peacefully in the futon. Taroumaru bring stuffed toy with a beard and cause licking Yuki. Although tries to wake everyone, there are only Yuki to bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of Yuki where Yuki has established a dressed. Yuki is running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. Encounter with the OP after Megu-nee. "It's not Megu-nee" scene. Then follow arrived for the school life club. It has been modified to the scene to eat rice morning by adding the Mii-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of first volume. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Mii-kun is not liked by Taroumaru. Rii-san is scold Taroumaru. Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. Yuki toward the classroom for day duty. Here it can be stopped by to Megu-nee. Shadow is thin (and censored?). Conversation ‚ë† of character of image and its entourage two people and the classroom. ‚ë° teacher also appeared. <br> Start of classes, as beginning one Volume and even though it is sleep in class, such should be in class junior of Mii-kun comes to the classroom. Yuki can say as no good to come because during class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Mii-kun visited because gone is Taroumaru. Yuki to Mii-kun "Mii-kun are tense. We'll got to nervous from entering the senior" says while walking, but is immediately denied. Looking Taroumaru from here. Yuki say that unraveling tensions in Mii-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Or it is closed windows could not be confirmed, but it was a deliberate sound effect) Here Taroumaru barking of. Headed in the direction in which voice is heard. Here A part end. After there is CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br></br>  <br><br>I'd say more the assault alarm thing is a hint than a kitchen knife next to cooking stuff, that isn't normal school life stuff.<br><br> Running past happy cardboard cutout students. <br> Every week <br>No. No no no.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not believing in the shovel <br>There are people who do that?<br>What filthy people.<br><br><br>They're teenage girls stuck in a school for 4/5ths of the manga, we know jack shit about whats going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who do that? <br>Shovel's going to go zombie someday (probably while they're at the university or on the way to the Randall Corp. building). I have faith in Cat Hat growing to become the competent leader of cute schoolgirls that I know she can be, because god knows Shovel won't be around for too long, crazy's too crazy, and garter's more of a follower than a leader.</br></br>  <br>Realistically these zombies wouldn't be too much of a threat in countries that have a well-armed military and are spacious, like the US and Russia. And honestly with all the "Zombie Hunting Permit" and "Zombie First Response Team" bumper stickers I've been seeing recently this seems like every redneck's wet dream.</br>  <br> Shovel's going to go zombie someday <br>M-meanie ;_;<br>You just have to believe in the shovel anon, even with her dying breath she'll save everyone!</br></br></br>  <br> every redneck's wet dream. <br>Everyone with a gun's wet dream, really. World War Z (the book)'s a pretty interesting read on how the fuck a zombie outbreak would occur, or at least a somewhat believable take on how one would happen.</br></br>  The last time they'll see her it'll be like this scene. Her back will be turned towards them as she faces off a horde of zombies. They'll shout her name in desperation, as if shouting could save her. In response, she'll turn her head and give one last soft, small smile that tells them she's accepted her fate. She'll thank them, tell them that she loves them, but that they have to go. She'll turn forward, close her eyes and take a deep breath, unaffected by the voices crying out her name, then quietly say, "goodbye," and run off to her death.  <br>Anon, please.<br>As if we haven't had enough of these today ;_; <br>What makes it even worse is the fact that something like this is extremely likely and something shovel would do.</br></br></br>  <br>And later, like with Garter's friend we will see her as a zombie in the background.</br>  <br>But zombies don't detect her anymore. She won't die to zombies.</br>  <br> Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. <br>Is he saying that this scene is in the first episode? That's got me worried. That means they aren't planning to do it later. It was an important scene, too, since it happened after 4 chapters of shit hitting the fan and it finally showed them being able to relax a little bit.</br></br>  So /a/, are you prepared for the inevitable zombie apocalypse caused by scientists experimenting with fungi? What weapons do you have? How many supplies do you stockpile? Do you have any military/survival experience?  <br> While chasing Taroumaru he go towards the barricades of the desk but then turn to classroom before the barricade. Mii-kun also tries to enter the classroom, but is stopped and is said to be during class to Yuki. Confused look of Mii-kun. Mii-kun to enter the classroom from the greeting. However Taroumaru escape without being grabbed. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taroumaru is directed to the roof. There are Kurumi and Rii-san, Kurumi is joined to said capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel, again Taroumaru distant foot race. But Taroumaru is I get angry in that entered the rooftop garden. Angry also other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life club knowledge part. Because it Tarou capture, scene change to school life club. <br> Put lead in Taroumaru. From here the contents on page 11 to page 19 combined content. Yuki is to classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Mii-kun became worried to act alone was also to be chasing after Yuki. "I like school recently" part. Yuki to be arrive in the classroom and conversation to the characters of ‚ë† about Taroumaru. Between here Mii-kun is coming, but as disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of where Yuki roughness of pages 22-23 is at classroom and Mii-kun is a at classroom door. Yuki that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall with Mii-kun, the wind blows. While the wind raging since windows and close the window because it left open has broken windows. So face of Yuki becomes up ed rush. <br><br> ED after the next episode notice <br><br> Taroumaru ish times. <br> #2 Memories <br><br>So I've tried to make that Japanese paste about the contents of the episode more understandable (still using google translator). Though I guess nobody cares anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about that. I dunno then. Maybe other survivors will get her, but I get the feeling the author won't do that.</br>  <br>Maybe the anime is supposed to be a prologue for the manga, just like FTWD.</br>  <br>Well actually it would work as we saw with the scene with Miki they react to her if she does something sudden like the shout.</br>  <br>Thanks anyway anon, now it's time to panic</br>  <br> western art </br>  <br>Sounds quite a bit different. Why couldn't they have just followed the manga? There's absolutely nothing wrong with the manga's plot in the initial chapters.</br>  <br>They just want to make the twist at the end of the episode and without filler that was impossible.</br>  <br>They're gonna fuck it all up. The more I think about it, the less hope I have. Damnit, someone sound the alarm.</br>  <br>The twist is literally the most important part of the opening episode. They'll put more budget and talent into it. Don't worry.</br>   not a faithful adaptation <br><br>All hope is lose.</br></br>  <br>sausga Lerche</br>  <br>Who knows, the author might opt to have a complete surprise happy end.<br>Given the overall tone and context, I doubt there'll be a BAD END for the sake of it. Somehow even with all the suffering going on, the story is in essence about how people who understand each other and stick together can manage to make it through hardships, even if there's no guarantee of beating any and all obstacles.<br><br><br>Yeah but the author is in charge of series composition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop thinking if you're just spiralling down into forced negative thoughts.</br></br>  While the adaptions unfaithfulness is scaring me I think its best to wait till episode 1 is out to judge it.<br><br>I just hope so much they don't fuck up.</br></br>  <br> have a complete surprise happy end. <br>The ultimate bait and switch, the whole manga was a story Yuki was writing.</br></br>  <br>Now we don't know what's going to happen. No one is safe.</br>  <br>Doing that without giving any hints pretty much sucks though</br>  <br>I don't deny that.</br>  They have the manga writer, of course they aren't going to follow the source material.  <br>They haven't done that much worldbuild8mg. I kind of wish they would, kind of wish they wouldn' t. I love worldbuilding, but I can also see how the story can be better told if things like that are kept mysterious.</br>  <br>I'm the same. Part of me wants to know more about the virus and what's happening in the world but I also want that the manga stays with 4 girls trying their best to survive.</br>  <br> the whole manga is actually Yukis dream, while she is stuck in an even worse reality </br>  <br> Yuki killed her friends and is in an asylum trying to come up with an excuse for why they died </br>  <br> The whole last chapter is Yuki waking up every few pages, every time in a different reality, sometimes a good one, sometimes not, and ends with her waking up for real and we don't know if the reality is good or not. </br>  <br><br><br>Anons stop, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br> but I get the feeling the author won't do that. <br> other survivors try to murder/rape them for their shit <br> Shovel offers herself in return for the safety of her friends <br> Shovel goes full zombie as her friends leave and... </br></br></br></br>  The entire series was actually  Miki's  delusion after she snapped and made up a scenario where she was rescued and found friends.  <br> it's actually Yuki remembering all the time he passed with her friends just before he gets eaten by zombies </br>  <br>That would be awesome, but I wonder if she's actually infectious already...<br><br> Unholy forbidden love </br></br></br>  <br>I'm sold.</br>  <br>I'd love me some of that unholy forbidden love.</br>  <br>It would make sense if she was trying to commit suicide via drugs, which would be ambiguous and a pretty fitting ending.</br>  <br> Yuki, who is scared, alone, infected, and without any supplies makes her way back to the school and finds a gun <br> Yuki then... </br></br>  <br>Please this OP only apply in episode 1 only.<br>I can't stand this amount of illusion  ;_; </br></br>  <br>That would be pretty good, i'm a sucker for ambiguous ending.</br>  <br> Yuki has reverted to insanity <br> From the perspective of the other characters she is holding a gun <br> "Say cheese" </br></br></br>  Might someone translate this shovel?  <br>What would make you think this?</br>  <br>the handle says gaku gurashi.<br>fuck me if I can decipher the writing on the actual shovel but I think its just autographs</br></br>  and also  <br> tfw you'll never own a shovel signed by shovel herself </br>  <br>there seem to be some words in some autograph</br>  <br><br><br><br>I want my shovel signed!</br></br></br></br>  <br>those are just names</br>  <br>yeah just names</br>  <br>Taroumaru...<br>LOVE...<br>*sob*...<br>Miki<br><br>SHOVEL<br>LOVE<br><br>School live club<br>is "the best"<br><br>I love everyone so much ‚âß‚àá‚â¶<br>[heart]Yuki[/heart]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She snapped before that.<br><br>She was always the most responsible one and tried to be the strongest of mind. First sign of trouble in paradise is when she flips out at Miki for suggesting Yuki shouldn't be playing around. Shit really starts going downhill when  Kurumi is bitten  and after that it's just a matter of time.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't see anything weird. It's just Yuki hugging a little girl, probably because she's afraid.</br>  <br>Why would you hire the original writer if you weren't planning on changing or adding new shit?</br>    <br>It would probably be another Madoka sort of deal.</br>  so apparently in ep1 we get happy 23 mins plus shaky last minute.  <br>I'm going to screenshot the comments on nyaa, just so we can see what the reaction might have been.</br>  <br> yfw it's Yucky Tuna all over again </br>  <br>it hurts</br>  <br>To think this is all happening in Yuki's head</br>  Yuki and Miki are loli.  healing anime of the season  BTW I've just remembered that aside from the designer who's working on character designes they also have another designer who's doing „Åã„Çå„Çâ„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥. „Åã„Çå„Çâ„Éá„Ç∂„Ç§„É≥ translates as "their design". At first I was confused about who do their mean by "them" but then I've remembered that Yuki and co. don't have a name for zombie, right? So I guess it's a nice touch that they actually have a different designer for "them" (who's also a character designer for Carnival Phantasm).  <br> the people in the background of Yuki's shot are paper cutouts <br>They aren't even suffering yet and I can't take it.</br></br>  <br>That sounds perfectly fine, I'm not sure why people are worried.<br><br>My only concern is how Kei will be included if Miki is already there.</br></br></br>  <br>You ruined half the fun of the manga which is reading it completely blind. Just read the manga before you get spoiled.</br>  Next chapter scanlation when?  <br>It'd be cool if "them" is the government soldiers or something</br>  <br>Ask deel.</br>  <br><br>I already downloaded it on my own, but someone should put it on nyaa.</br></br>  <br>Will this be the Aijou Yuujou of our generation?</br>  <br>The Yuuki Yuuna of 2015.</br>  But Yucky Tunda didn't have a diabetes OP/ED like this or Aijou Yuujou.  <br>Brilliant</br>  <br><br>Meant to quote.</br></br>  <br>You know the only reason they posted the OP before the show aired was because it will inevitably change for episode 2, right?</br>  Can someone post the OP on /wsg/?  <br>This is fantastic, the Megu-nee shot especially.</br>  <br>So misleading. I love it.</br>  <br>I hope they don't change the OP throughout the show and have all the PV's look all happy and such just for added misleading</br>  We have to wait four more days.  <br>Holy fucking shit, I can't stop laughing. They are totally going for catching the anime-only audience completely, entirely off-guard.</br>  Have you guys properly read the spoilers? It's pretty much just an extended version of the first episode that ends with the exact same destroyed classroom shot.  <br>My body is ready to be healed, if that's the case. The adorable SoL shenanigans in Yuki's head are enough to prevent suicide. Just ask Shovel and CrayCray.</br>  <br>The only significant change is Miki being there, right? Unless we've mistaken that as well</br>  Let's take some hints from the OP<br><br>Does this mean field trip is confirmed?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Why else would Garters be there in the first place?</br>  <br>It's cute how they think they'll fool the watchers when the vast majority already knows what happens. Especially when they can get spoiled by simply googling the title.<br><br>But they are trying at least, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Most people don't know about the psychological thing.</br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>They won't be expecting the twist at the end of the episode, or at least not the twist they were expecting.</br>  <br>How come? Again, if you google the title you'll see it's nothing like the OP and Lerche is trying to bait the few fools going in blind. It could have worked if this was an original project but this is an adaptation.</br>  <br>Lyrics could be worth looking at if you fancy typing it all out<br><br><br>People would just call it the Madoka of Zombie films.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This kind of bait and switch is obviously not gonna work on people who browse anime discussion forums. But there are many "casuals" who picks up shows based on poster alone, and not to mention japs who don't know about the show and just happened to watch it when it's broadcasting on TV.</br>  Maon Kurosaki songs are pretty chuuni so the ED should be fitting:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ffN<wbr>4ayEkKcc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Good thing I read the manga</br>  <br>I lost it at the 'genki desu' note.</br>  <br>desu note you say?</br>    I want to heal Mii-kun with my dick.  <br> RIFE ON ZA GAKKOU </br>  <br>I wlll never despair.</br>  <br>It hilarious that it starts with a 3 second cheesy terror intro before going full cute girls mode.</br>  <br>Most of the guys who pick this up are there for the "twist" and just that. They must have read it in other forums, but never bothered to go inside the source. They may seem to be prepared for it, but no, they're not. It's like expecting to get shot.<br><br> After that, they either stick to it or drop it.</br></br></br>  <br>More like wonderful.</br>  <br>Especially since it seems to air at 23:30 which is pretty early for anime I think.</br>  <br>who is this semen demon.</br>  <br>A little early, but stuff like KinMoza S1 was 10pm. It just depends on the intended audience.</br>  <br>Her name is Love.</br>  <br>Holy fuck there's a boy there.</br>  <br>No it isn't.</br>  <br>dont worry hes dead</br>  WATASHITACHI<br><br> Shit's stuck in my head now. </br></br>  <br> TANOSHINDERU </br>  <br>Bless you.</br>  Miki doesn't get enough love, I say.  <br>I thought she was the most loved Gurashi along with Shovel.</br>  <br>She's the most canon sexualized gurashi.</br>  <br>No one likes Shovel.</br>  <br>u wot m8</br>  <br>I give her more than enough love.</br>  <br>That's just wrong.</br>  <br>GA KOKONI IMASU</br>  <br>Shovel is a ho.</br>  <br>Ssh, you'll make Shovelfags mad</br>    <br>She's a zo.</br>  <br>THE ERA OF BLUE BACKGROUNDS ENDED LONG AGO GRANDPA</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I just call it retro and get on with life.</br>  <br><br>How is this even possible?</br></br>  Shovel is not really going to die is she?  <br>How is what possible?</br>  <br>Dead as a door nail.</br>  <br>No, she won't because has already been dead for a while.</br>  <br>YOU FOOL</br>  <br><br>Stop that!</br></br>  <br>Only if you stop instigating me to do it.</br>  <br>Oh I get it. You can only do it twice.</br>  <br>You got me.</br>  <br>At least you admit your defeat honorably.</br>    <br>Fuck, having flashbacks of that chapter now.</br>  There are no subs yet? I want my loli suffering  <br>It hasn't even aired yet</br>  <br> subs <br>more like dubs</br></br>  <br>Nigga, it airs on thursday.<br><br>Nice quints though</br></br></br>  <br>that get won't make it come faster, anon. just be patient.</br>  Even the animation staff likes her the most.  <br>That's just coincidence</br>  <br>I asked DDY if they were going to sub the OP before the first episode comes out, and they said no.

I don't know if they're supposed to be semi-super-deformed or something but it looks really unnatural.</br></br></br>  <br>This one. He said that we will see how Erwin joined the SL and became commander.</br>  <br>i guess we wont see the basement this year.</br>  <br>I thought the anon who translated that said it wasn't confirmed for this month?</br>  <br>The only Asian I would let cum inside me.</br>  <br> During the press conference, Isayama also mentioned that he has drawn young Erwin again in chapter 71 of the SnK manga, to be officially released next week on July 8th! </br>  <br>I'll be pretty annoyed if this is all we get this month.</br>  How young will we see Erwin? Jailbaitwin? Shotawin?  <br>I do want the story to pick back up and move faster after that last several chapters shit, but Erwin is cool so I'm divided</br>  <br>He mentioned that he would draw young Erwin again, that we would see how Erwin became a leader, and that young Erwin related to Erwin in terms of his early days in the SL. <br><br>The thing is that Isayama didn't use too many concrete terms except for mentioning Youngwin in the next chapter, so it's hard to say if we're going to get all of it this month or so. <br><br><br>Young SLwin going by the news articles out.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this is shit, again some filler which we do not simply need...</br>  <br><br>Tumblr please leave.</br></br>  Anyone know where I can read SnK for free? The site I used to use isn't working anymore.  <br>Maybe YOU don't need jailbaitwin, but I sure do</br>  <br>mangapanda</br>  <br>Didn't someone say that the flashback is short?</br>  <br>not sure if troll or... you can read on mangapanda.com/mangafox.com or any other leeching site.</br>  <br>I want some background infos about Grisha and possibly some mysteries, not more filler to drag out the story.</br>  <br>So we could only get a single panel of him huh. Maybe this involves his dream.</br>  <br>we all need that anon</br>  <br>Maybe it's not even about him and we see him just in the background.</br>  erwin's dream is to be fucked by hanji's colossal dick  <br>How is that even close to tumblr?</br>  <br>Yeah, you can tell halfway he just started adding shit to fluff it up and keep it going. Seems like now he doesn't know what do with it or how to end it</br>  <br>I like how those game collaborations always include FT.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127587950 <br>Reminder that if you ship at all you are the definition of a shit poster.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127587950 <br>Yes.Tumblr also supports these ships, as you can see here <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127587802 </br>  <br> not knowing the-only-Asian-I-would-let-come-ins<wbr>ide-me anon</wbr> <br>Newfag please leave</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127587950 <br>eh lm and br are the only canon ships</br>  Who BA here?  <br>I can't imagine anyone liking BR would like either of LM as characters or vice versa</br>   2010+5 <br> not shipping CS </br>  <br>that sounds obnoxious to say. I like both ships and all four characters.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  I'm glad the shitposting finally gets deleted, mods = gods  <br>My nigga</br>  <br>What is LM?</br>  <br>levixmikasa</br>  Why is Armin such a faggot?  <br>That's his eyelash curl and she has pink eye</br>    <br>They all seem to have the same expression to me.</br>  <br>Please no more flashbacks that aren't relevant. Erwin is so damn boring. I want more details on the basement arc not fujobait pandering.</br>  <br>He even has nice hips jesus christ, no wonder molester-kun is not normal anymore</br>  So was he/she born a woman or man?  <br>Please kill yourself.</br>  <br>Armin's cuteness is ruined by his awful hair. He just looks like an annoying faggot.</br>  <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br>And his pig nose.</br>  <br><br><br>He's perfect what the fuck are you talking about? Even if he has hips wider than mine and his haircut makes him look like a grade A jabroni...</br></br></br>  <br>She's an Innovade.</br>  <br><br>Xir's nonbinary you transphobic scum. Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>He's the shittiest of them all and a plot device.</br>  <br>We're not talking about Eren here, anon</br>  <br><br>Fuck off, at least he's better than the manlet.<br><br>BY A WHOLE TWO INCHES.</br></br></br></br>  <br> better than the manlet  <br>Not really.<br>But they're both terribible, I agree.</br></br></br>  <br>This, this, this, this!!<br><br>Hanji and Ymir are genderfluid at the very least. Anyone who denyes this is a shitposter.</br></br></br>  <br>How is manlet better than Armin?</br>  <br>He didn't say one was better than the other, they're both just terrible.</br>  <br>Reporting in.</br>  <br>I am the biggest BA fangirl you can find!!</br>  <br>Who gave Annie her ring?</br>  <br>It sounded like even if he thinks both are terrible, Armin is still worse than manlet.</br>  <br>Their kid would just be a nose</br>  <br>Is it gold? That's what important for annie.</br>  <br>According to the VN it wasn't her father, so maybe it will become relevant later on.</br>  <br>2qt4me</br>  <br>Maybe it was BR.</br>  <br>That would be sweet. It's not a ring you can buy somewhere in the walls so it's either another shifter or Annie made it herself.</br>  <br>I don't think this is going to be brought up again, it might as well have been a mass-produced accessory in BRA's village.</br>  Bert is a total buttdart and an all-around bad person  <br>It's the only reason I can think of where she would actually want to lie so nobody would suspect anything if something happens.</br>  Why did Marco cover up the right side of his face right before he lost it? What's the purpose of this foreshadowing?  <br><br>Who the fuck is Marco?</br></br>  <br>'cause he is actually final boss, special type of titan, Jean's lover, Mikasa's true love, Armin's grandpa, manlet, Annie and Erwin's father and he rapes MT all the time.</br>  <br>To show that he's half the man he used to be</br>  <br>I like this explanation.</br>  <br>This would be gr8</br>  <br>Is he Ackerman Jaeger Reiss too anon?</br>  <br>True, if she made it or bought it there would be no reason to lie.</br>  <br>Nope, that's Almighty honoris cause Dr. Lance Rivaille.</br>  Why does Levi no longer want to kill Erwin?  <br>I keep saying he still does and probably will but nobody listens to me</br>  <br>We don't really know. ACWNR doesn't even gave an answer. But as well as Kenny, for someone who lacks will and purpose and only have strength, finding meaning in someone's else dreams must be reassuring.</br>  <br>He realized he's useless on his own and just a dog.</br>  So which ACWNR is now canon?<br>OVA, Manga or VN?</br>  <br>It's weird seeing her as Krista still in this kind of stuff when it's been a bit over 2 years now since she's acted that way</br>  <br>He's arrogant as fuck and probably thinks he's hot shit</br>  <br>None.</br>  <br>All of them are about as canon as chuugakkou.</br>  <br>What makes you think so?</br>  <br>He must have said he's better and stronger than anyone else about a dozen times.</br>  <br>[Citation needed]</br>  <br>When?</br>  <br><br>Really?</br></br>  <br>Why would anyone but fujos care?</br>  <br>Sorry for your lost of reading comprehension skills.</br>  <br>OVA. I cried when Levi found out his first true love was died so much. Levi is such a deep and complex character why do you 4channers hate him?</br>  <br>Levi is so ugly.</br>  <br>He isn't complex he's just a retard.</br>  <br> instead of going to a therapist he just keeps his problems to himself <br>What an idiot.</br></br>  <br>Is up to you, anon!<br>Want a manlet who kills as many horses as titans? Then pick VN.<br>Want a manlet who looks like jailbait and thinks deeply of his tomodachis and only kills titans? Pick manga.<br>Want Manlet who did it for jan? Then pick OVAs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to sniff Niffa.</br>  <br> replying to obvious reverse shitposting </br>  <br> implying landwhales don't come here and actually say that </br>    <br>Where the fuck this is from?</br>  <br>They look like trannies.</br>  <br>Holy shit, you're like a little kid who can't accept they were wrong.</br>  <br>Anon what,</br>  <br>You're just a little kid who can't accept you worng.</br>  <br>No, you are.</br>  <br>No, you are.</br>  <br>Nah, I always see it as reverse shitposting. At worst they'll say that Levi is a good waifu.</br>  <br>This manga isn't for you.</br>  <br>Of course, Ymirfag would be the master of telling what reverse shitposting is. He has the most experience of us reverse girls.</br>  <br>  If raviola were a grill she would be  </br>  <br>I still don't understand why he threatened Historia.</br>  <br>Because she was trying to steal his husbando, Eren.</br>  <br>That was the only way she could understand at that time.</br>  <br>Because he's all bark. He has to overcompensate for his manlet status</br>  Also why did she call him Aniki and not Onii-chan? Does that mean she wasn't as attracted towards Levi as a typical younger sister should be?  <br>Mah nigga.</br>  <br>Kill yourself, incestfag.<br>You're the scum that rids this earth.</br></br>  <br> tumblr <br>fuck off back to /y/</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should leave /a/ then? I don't think this is the place for you, respectful nodder.</br>  <br>She likes to be abused by ugly men such as Ymir and manlet.</br>  <br> what a man </br>  <br>am I the only one who wishes these two would die?</br>  <br>Unironically? Yes.</br>  <br>No, you are not alone.</br>  <br> did it for jan </br>  <br> unironically </br>  <br>I unironically wish both of them would die and I'm not him. Pretty sure a lot of anons here feel the same.</br>  <br>https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/un<wbr>ironically<br> Implying you can learn something. </br></wbr></br>  <br>Marco was a part of BRA</br>  <br>Sounds like you're in denial, landwhale.</br>  <br> tumblr Out. </br>  <br>my nigga. historia an oozing shit.</br>  Are the Erwin spoilers confitmed?  <br> &gt;tumblr Out <br>Here, landwhale, learn how to <br/></br></br>  <br>According to OP<br> OP is a nigger tho </br></br>  <br>Because Levi is actually a good person who understands others, and knows what to give them when they need it to get them to be their best. <br><br>He always says the right thing at the right time. That's why he treated the Boss and Flegel with kindness and got them on his side. <br><br>Historia was in a place where should only respond to violence/a direct order from her superior. Even though all the other characters were shocked, she reacted well to his treatment of her, just as he knew she would.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  official top tier ship list<br>erenxhistoria<br>levixmikasa<br>levixeren<br>bertholtxreiner<br>anniexarmin<br>erwinxhanji<br>jeanxmikasa</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>abuse is what historia needs. manlet a best.</br>  <br>You faggot just love to ruin everything, don't you?</br>  <br>She's way better than levi or Eren will ever be</br>  <br>Yes, But is not like 40 pages about shotawin doing cute things. Just a few panels or pages linked to Keith/I have a dream.</br>  <br>Kek the only reason Historia "responded well" is because Isayama can't risk making the manlet look like a jackass so other characters must find his abuse to be beneficial to them and helpful. He's a stu that anytime someone has good reason to hate him something happens to make that character rethink their dislike towards him.</br>  <br><br>Well, you got one of them correct.</br></br>  <br>All of that is shit. YH is the only good pairing in this garbage series.</br>  <br> "Hey Bert, I fucked your girlfriend" </br>  <br><br>"YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!! I KILL YOU!"</br></br>  <br>Anon, Manlet knew any thing Historia would have answered lacked meaning, so he just wanted a superficial immediately answer, that at least showed she wasn't go and fuck up the group with her doubts and angst.<br>Also, I think as you, he was well behaved with Reeves and even Flegel because they weren't hesitating. Flegel was just intimidated by his attitude and he wasn't a risk. Manlet never answers with violence when someone mocks him.</br></br>  Shitlet defense squad needs to go back to Tumblr  <br><br>But they will probably call on your bullshit once again.</br></br>  <br>Because Historia's objectively shit.</br>  <br>What bullshit?</br>  Speaking of, Manlet's too happy. Something will probably happen this chapter to crush that. Like Erwin injecting himself with the juice.  <br>Hopefully manlet dies.</br>  <br>He'll get a new waifu who'll be killed off a couple chapters later</br>  <br>Too soon.<br> Implying it will be Erwin. </br></br>  <br>No, manlet can't die until he feels true happiness, unless it's to save any of his husbandos.</br>  <br> Happy <br>It's the opposite</br></br>  <br>I hope he dies.</br>  <br>Erwin's ready to die right now, since he lost his arm and is ready to hand command to Hange. He'll probably inject the serum to try and fight monkey trouble.</br>    <br>This.</br>  <br>this<br><br>the only good ackerman died, may as well kill the other 2 shits</br></br></br>  chapter 71 was fucking boring ntohing happened  <br>too bad there is no 71 yet</br>  <br>welcome to SNK generals</br>  <br>What's with the Historia hate recently?</br>  <br>Why did he smile when getting punched?<br>Is he retarded?</br></br>  <br>emfags salty af</br>  <br>Nobody but fat tumblr landwhales hate her.</br>  <br> recently </br>  <br>This. It's not even because EH (since that is a delusional non-ship that nobody outside of /a/ takes seriously) it's because she's just a shitty character blonde bimbo mary sue.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>You're a shitty blonde bimbo mary sue</br>  <br>Nope, I am not, I am a strong independent feminist who is proud of her body.</br>  <br>Got a lot of screentime. Some liked her okay as a support but hated seeing her as a quasi-main, others hated her all along.</br>  <br>Mikasa pls. You're just as shit if not the shittiest grill in the series.</br>  <br>She's no longer a depressed, toodeep4you moe.</br>  Is everyone a virgin in SnK?  <br>Yes<br><br>Except for Reiner. He's the top alpha who gets all the puss he wants.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually she's in Tumblr's top ten now.</br>  <br>Don't know but she's one of the few decent characters. It's probably Ymirfags and Mikasafags jealous that she's better than their favorites. Notice how most of the insults towards her tend to consist of just "bimbo" when she's nothing like one.</br>  <br><br>Now tumblr loves her because she's a strong independent womyn and 4chan doesn't like her because she's not 2deep. When she was 2deep, Ymirfags hated her because they wanted her to be muh Ymir all the time and she was more than that.</br></br>  <br>You're saying this like there are actually 50 characters in snk they might care about.</br>  <br>I'm so glad she isn't muh Ymir anymore but I don't really care if here or Tumblr likes her or not.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br><br>Nope, it's mostly manletfags and a few mikasafags. Apparently a lot of manletfujos also constantly shit on her on dumblr too.</br></br>  <br>Manletfujos shit on everyone even Erwin.</br>  <br>Well one Erwinfag likes to do that too. The one that adores penguinfag. The extreme hate pretty much started when manlet manhandled her and his defence force showed up. From that on it got even worse with her depression.</br>  <br> even Erwin <br>Rightfully. Erwinfags treat Levi like shit even if both characters are equally bad.</br></br>  <br>She ruined Eren. <br><br>He used to be fired up and ready to take on the world. Now he's just a little cry baby, and it's because of her.</br></br></br>  <br>He used to be an annoying brat, which is not that much better.</br>  <br>Nice stealth shitposting, EHfag. She didn't ruin Eren at all because there is nothing between them, nothing.</br>  <br>Actually it's mainly because of his father.</br>  <br>Eren changed since Hannes died ya idiot</br>  <br>Eren was always terrible. How can you ruin shit?</br>  <br>Levi is the most popular character, gets the most merch pandering and pandering in general and even has spin offs dedicated to him. They have no reason to be bitter because a minority is tired of him or rightfully dislikes him.</br>  <br>Grisha trusted his son when he said humanity needed to fight back. Guess that was a mistake.</br>  Levi is the best characters and guys hate him just because they're jealous that he gets all the girls (us).  <br>The retarded Erwinfag hates everyone who isn't Mikasa or Erwong.</br>  <br>I'm a girl and I hate him. He's like baby's first husbando and attracts the Sasuke crowd.</br>  <br><br>IM A GUUURRRRRLLLLL</br></br>  <br> I'm a girl <br>Same</br></br>  <br>Sasuke, Hiei, Izaya, Law, pretty much every edgy popular side character from any series.</br>  Am I the only one who doesn't like Levi and Erwin  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127598757 <br> XD <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>I don't like them either. Now hide before a horde of fujos get us and kill us.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I hate them both. They're overrated, boring as fuck and neither are attractive.</br>  <br>No.</br>  Ymir and Historia are the best characters and anyone who disagrees is a fujo with shit taste or a Shitkasafag.  <br><br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127598757 <br> grills <br>Nice try, neckbeards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Butthurt Erwongfujo detected.</br>  <br>I only speak the truth.</br>  <br>Sure you do.</br>  <br>Nice try but not a single decent Historiafag likes Dykemir.</br>  <br>A decent Historiafag likes Ymir too.</br>  <br>Calm down butthurt ErwL fujo.</br>  <br>They're even worse than Erwin and Levi.</br>  <br>Reiner is a super virgin.</br>  <br>See<br>Your reverse shitposting was too easy to detect.</br></br>    <br>Funny thing is I'm not reverse shitposting but stay mad fujowhale.</br>  <br>It's horrid, isn't?</br>  <br>But I'm not the one pretending not to be an ErwLfujo.</br>  <br>I'm a YHfag.</br>  <br>Not even close.</br>    <br>This</br>  still no spoilers?  <br>No, just that there will be a flashback, which was to be expected.</br>  <br>A Keith flashback I hope?</br>  <br>Even tumblr is less cancerous, mods should just fucking permaban snk generals and only allow monthly threads</br>  <br>Erwin</br>  <br>That's what I'm thinking. Maybe Keith remembers something from his past, and Erwin just happens to be there. It might involve Grisha too.</br>  <br>Most likely. It'll include Erwin.</br>  <br>How come the daily generals are allowed again?</br>  <br>Wasn't Erwin in Keith's squad?</br>  <br>Mike and Nanaba too, and they are kill.</br>  <br>I want it to be something about Keith instead of Isayama postponing answers again.</br>  <br>I don't know, why are dykes the most worthless kind of people?</br>    <br>I don't remember that being mentioned in the manga but I would assume he was since he was with him during this expedition.</br>  <br>By far. Ymir at least, because Historia is decent.</br>  <br>SnK generals = tumblr generals = landwhale generals</br>  <br> Ymir <br> Worse than Levi <br>Yeah okay.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> Sasuke crowd <br>The problem is not manlet but your shit taste that allowed you to being familiar with sauce-chan.<br>imgrillbtw!</br></br></br>  <br>That's how we should call it from now</br>  <br>Easily.</br>  <br>Forgetting furfags.</br>  <br> posting this on every thread more than one time. <br>Insecure much?  it's kill </br></br>  <br>Maybe that titan they fought was someone important?</br>  <br>Eren/Historia is boring and forced.

It literally came out of nowhere. They're just friends and everyone is forcing them together.<br><br><br>YH is even more canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Grisha knew too much to not be from another village.</br>  <br>EH is shit and so is Eren and I say that as a Historiafag. YH is much better.</br>  <br>Just Historia.</br>  <br> It's the same dynamic with YH <br>Eren and Ymir are completely different personality-wise. The pairings' dynamics are nothing alike, I personally prefer YH's dynamic.</br></br>  <br>It's kill anon. You're just making yourself look like a delusional retard in damage control.</br>  MODS  <br> It is forced. It literally came out of nowhere. They're just friends and everyone is forcing them together. <br>It's called development and it's not forced. Not everything has to be set in stone from page 1 to be accepted.</br></br>  <br>Both Ymir and Historia.</br>  <br>That's a good thought actually. <br><br>Maybe Keith was in on Grisha's experimenting while he was affiliated with the military? They could have brought Grisha along on that expedition and that's where Grisha worked his magic.  Oh shit and what if Erwin knew this whole time? This would explain what his dream actually is. </br></br></br>  still no fucking spoilers? WTF?  <br>Their friendship isn't forced I can give you that, but seeing as Eren is the MC, it's like every single character must have had some sort of interaction with him which makes EH less believable as a romantic couple.</br>  <br>these are all of the canon pairs so accept it butthurt em, yh, ba, erwl, lhfujo</br>  <br>Do you plan to keep yelling this every time someone hates on muh Ymir? Because so far there has been lots of hate and you didn't seem to care.</br>  <br> His fucking bolo tie <br>Was he from any military branch?</br></br>  <br>Did Grisha knew about the Ackermann's and their special power?</br>  <br> WTF <br><br><br> no capitalization <br> no punctiaton <br> Delusional shippertrash <br>SnK threads never cease to amaze me</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are Ymirfag, not a girl.</br>  <br>Eren's never really interacted with Sasha or Connie though.</br>  <br> trying to be slutty 2.0 <br><br>Slutty was funnier   in my opinion. </br></br></br>  <br>I bet he got info from Asians or Ackermans.</br>  <br>With Connie? He has.</br>  <br>I hate Cuckmir and the cuckposter as much as you do anon, I just want these threads deleted cuz its literal cancer</br>  <br>yeah WTF, where are the spoilers...</br>   responding to lesbian shitposters   <br>Sasha too.</br>  <br>Oh thank god. Slutty was one of the worst posters in these threads.</br>  <br>Pretty sure he's still around.</br>  <br>I've always theorized he had his own private medical research branch.<br><br><br>There's no why he didn't know. It's obviously the only reason why he was so eager to adopt Mikasa.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you hate it so much then go back to your tumblr hugbox.</br>    <br>I don't have a tumblr hugbox, can we share it?</br>  <br>I doubt he was capable of stopping his attentionwhoring so I very much doubt that.</br>  <br> They're just friends and everyone is forcing them together. <br><br> YH is even more canon. </br></br></br>  <br> Ymirfags being this butthurt <br>How typical.</br></br>  <br>He stopped the soc shit after someone found out his name and posted a pic of him. He's still here shitposting without the attentionwhoring.</br>  <br>But it is, the anime director confirmed it.</br>  <br>He just heavily implied it, not confirm it. That's it.</br>  <br>Yes, cause you were there and you know more about it than a translator that was right there.</br>  <br>So just so we know, how many people agree these threads should be banned?</br>  <br>It was a misunderstanding. He said "it's whatever you think it is" not "they're a couple".</br>  <br>He said "it is how you want to see it", which is a default diplomatic answer.</br>  <br><br>See</br></br>  <br>Someone who was there confirmed he just heavily implied they have mutual feelings. Saying that they already are a couple is weird and makes no sense.</br>  <br>I agree with you.</br>  <br><br><br>Why is this such a widespread belief? Fact is that an official translator translated it as such and it seems like you guys want to debunk it by making this up.</br></br></br>  <br>Perhaps it makes no sense because you're responding to bait.</br>  <br> translator <br>The translator wasn't the one who made the article, it was a tumblrina fangirling about it. A germanfag who was there already cleared it up.</br></br>  <br> Someone who was there <br>Source? You mean someone from /a/ was there? <br><br><br>Agreed.<br><br><br>Sounds to me like you're in denial about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>a german guy translated it. no body said yh and em are not the final ship. It just isn't .01 percent confirm. Beside this isn't a romance manga.</br>  <br><br>That's what the german text said, that the director gave a non answer. Tumblr thought it was a confirmation and the article was posted like "YH IS CANON" with no sign of that in the actual article. And more people from the convention commented on it later on and it wasn't a confirmation.</br></br>  <br>Even /u/ knows it's a misunderstanding, and they're delusional. Why insist about it so much?</br>  <br> That's what the german text said, that the director gave a non answer. <br>I'm a Germanfag and the text said that they are a couple.</br></br>  <br> a german guy translated it <br>Source.<br><br><br>Someone hasn't read the article. <br><br><br>/u/ is a shit place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  People do know that people are allowed to have more than one relationship in their life, right? <br><br>Historia and Ymir could have been in love, and Historia and Eren could be in love. Historia might stick with Eren, or she might go back to Ymir. Eren might find himself having feelings for someone else. That's how people work.</br></br>  <br> Furthermore, he confirmed the characters Christa and Ymir to actually be a couple </br>  <br>Ok. How a doctor as Grisha manage to reunite a lot of information about titans and secrets on his basement without getting the attention of many enemies?<br>For the moment, we know he wasn't a subject of interest, at least not like in episode zero when Eren mentioned military police was looking for Grisha. Rod didn't seem to know about him. Also he was capable of cure an epidemic disease. Maybe, Yeager is not even his real last name? I mean, he married Carla using a fake name.</br></br>  <br>The guy who wrote the article probably took the implication as a confirmation.</br>  <br>Secret tunnel.</br>  <br>I think people here can't understand that characters change and don't have to do the same thing from the beginning to the end.</br>  <br>As a YHfag I think that YH needs to have a conclusion to it, that's why EH seems so unbelievable to me, it would have seemed like Historia literally jumped from Ymir to Eren just because Ymir disappeared for a while with no confirmation of her death;</br>  <br>Because this is a shonen manga, not a SOL.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/search/text/G<wbr>erman%20wada/</wbr></br>  <br> assumptions <br>I want an actual source on this. It's literally written out that the anime creator said that. No vagueness about it, plain-out confirmation.</br></br>  <br> implying Eren and Mikasa won't end up together </br>  <br>Because you weren't in them, Ymirfat.</br>  <br> It's literally written out that the anime creator said that. No vagueness about it, plain-out confirmation. <br>Yeah, you were there, right? The article couldn't be more vague.</br></br>  <br>I like YH though, but it's plain obvious it was a misunderstanding.</br>  <br>You expect me to believe a random anon, who probably also screamed "tumblr" the moment he read the article because his hopes and dreams were crushed?</br>  <br> The article couldn't be more vague <br> producer George Wada confirmed that Ymir and Krista are "indeed a couple" <br> vague </br></br></br>  <br> as a Historiafag. YH is much better. <br>The number of people who believe this statement: 0.</br></br>  <br> You expect me to believe a random anon, who probably also screamed "tumblr" the moment he read the article because his hopes and dreams were crushed? <br>Eh? Are you retarded? You're the only one affected about the misunderstanding.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127601623 <br>get the fuck out of here you faggot, go kill yourself</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127601623 <br>Islamfag has a tiny one.</br>  <br>You are right. It is completely natural to expect LGBT propaganda in a manga aimed at 12 year old Japanese boys.</br>  <br>That's Ymirfags, not mine.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127601623 <br>Too small, not thick enough, you have the legs of a girl. 3/10 would not suck.</br>  <br>What misunderstanding? All I see is anons being in complete denial.</br>  <br>It's also aimed at fujos.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127601623 <br>You have a cardboard bed and a tv from 2001. Noice</br>  <br> producer George Wada confirmed that Ymir and Krista are "indeed a couple" <br>In what context? What were his exact words? Who asked it? Where's the video of it? Japanese to German translation where?<br> Not vague </br></br></br>  <br>Not surprising.</br>  <br>And fujos are all about Yayoi, not Yuri. Yuri is a male fetish. It even says so on the fucking wiki.</br>  <br>I'm sure fujos really give a shit about lesbians in an invisible relationship.</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127601623 <br>Samefag. Ymirfat trying to post his dick and pretend it's mine. The skin color doesn't even add up.</br></br>  <br>So you rathe rbelieve a random anon who probably made up the story than an official article by Crunchyroll with pictures of the anime director actually being there? Ok. <br><br>Where's the proof that this anon was even there?</br></br></br>  <br>They claim he used the romantic word for couple</br>  <br>Stop trying to deny it.</br>  I have no ill feelings towards YHfags.<br><br>I only support EH because I dislike Mikasa, and enjoy her suffering.<br><br>Would prefer EA though, but what can you do.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was there and I can confirm that Wada said "yes, you are right, Yummy Curry is canon and I support it too myself".</br>  <br>I believe the one that makes more sense.</br>  <br>EH will sink soon enough just like EA</br>  <br>As far as I know "couple" means that they're going out.</br>  <br>No one cares what you believe in Islamfag.</br>  <br>The anon's history is as believable as the article, but at least the anon give some actual conversation in both japanese and german to it.</br>  <br>who care if the anime director said anything. Unless it from ISAYAMA mouth nothing is canon.<br>Most of you ymir fans don't even like historia as a character. You just want your sweet princess to have a royal girlfriend.</br></br>  <br>EA sunk first, then EM, EH will sink as well. Sasha will get the Erenb owl, mark my word.</br>  <br>Unfortunately, all Eren pairings are ultimately doomed.</br>  <br>Disgusting. I'm not that cancer.</br>  <br>So you agree with me that believing an official article is makes more sense than a random anon on 4chan who posted a story that's probably made up. <br><br><br> The anon's history is as believable as the article <br>Hilarious<br><br><br>I like the both of them equally actually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes you are, stop trying to hide it. You are the only one who's autistic enough to hate our safe spaces and get triggered by non-hetshit.</br>  Who LH here?  <br> So you agree with me that believing an official article is makes more sense than a random anon on 4chan who posted a story that's probably made up. <br>No, the opposite, since saying that they're couple is weird.</br></br>  <br>I get the feeling that people will start to ship EA more once there is a falling out between them (someone did say this would happen, right?)</br>  <br> official article <br>Post it again, I want to check something out, denialanon.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself, Islamshit.</br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>Hange being paired up with anyone other than Moblit makes me uncomfortable</br>  <br>You are Islamshit, not me, Islamshit.

I can't into moon. Can anyone confirm this?</br>  Since Pony Canyon is willing to do S2, its question of time.  <br>He only said „ÇÑ„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ though.</br>  <br>It just says Nakamura said he wants to do S2.<br><br>Hardly a confirmation.</br></br></br>  It's just the producer saying that he'd like to at Anime Expo. We already knew that.  <br>Its legit, but does not mean its in production. Just means Pony Canyon (one of Producers, doing all music publishing for it and stuff), is willing to go for another season. So its up to KyoAni if they`ll want it (which they likely will).</br>  <br>Dreams don't come true unless you wish them out loud.</br>  THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN, you're truly the patron saint of second seasons.  <br>Thanks god</br>  <br>If the producer wants another season and knowing KyoAni wanted to do it in the first place I'm now hopeful for it to happen. Inshallah before Winter 2016.</br>    <br>Its just one of 3 producers (the one responsible for music sales). Shirobako should have taught you its not that easy.</br>  <br>But anon I can't get enough of the Kumiko. I really want to belive a 24 episode season 2 is happening. And that's the announcement they're having next KyoAniDo event.</br>  <br>It's obvious that there will be a second season. I doubt they'll confirm anything anytime soon though.</br>  Euphonium was AOTS no contest, so I'm hoping for more.  Looks like Euphonium might be AOTS for another season.  Please make it 2 cours and 1 movie as a finale  <br>It's not confirmed. Learn 2 Moon before you post threads like this you tard.</br>  <br>the quads demand s2</br>  Hibike feels like the kind of show kyoani typically does 2nd seasons for.  Wheres the KyoAnus sticky?<br><br>Oh wait , there has never been one.<br><br>KEKkai Sensen.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You fucking SHIT OP, My hopes and dreams gone in a instant.</br></br>  <br>Not gone, just unconfirmed.<br>Probably not even decided by kyoani yet.</br></br>  Here's the video.<br>http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/6612<wbr>3452</wbr></br>  Hell yeah  <br> Minute 26 <br> Some feminist bitch complaining about male dominated band clubs <br> Didn't even ask a question <br><br>Holy fuck America get your bitches on a leash already.</br></br></br></br></br>   clickbait the OP <br><br>Do you have a job at Sankakucomplex?</br></br>  Didn't the anime sold like shit?   „ÇÑ„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ <br><br>OBOE-CHAN WILL SAVE US.<br><br>THANK YOU BASED OBOE-CHAN</br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni standards, kind of, but sales-wise it did okay. 6k isn't really impressive but many anime can only dream of such sales.<br><br><br>If only. The world needs more Hazuki.</br></br></br></br>  And so the baiting continues.  <br>Quads confirmed S2</br>  How would you improve season 2 to make it sell even better? I found the show boring until episode 5.  <br>Make it focus either exclusively on het or yuri. Don't make the show row on two rivers.</br>  <br><br>More marching band too.</br></br>  ÂêçÂâçÔºöÂêçÁÑ°„Åó„Åï„ÇìÊäïÁ®øÊó•Ôºö2015Âπ¥01Êúà01Êó•<br> <br>4ch„Åß„ÇÇË®Ä„Å£„Å¶„Åü„ÇÑ„Å§„ÅÑ„Åü„Çè<br>„Åù„Çä„ÇÉ„ÇÑ„Çä„Åü„ÅÑ„Å†„Çç„ÅÜ„Å≠<br><br>What does that jap say about us?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> okay, we will try. </br></br>  <br>I've literally never heard that idiom before.</br>  <br>Neither will happen.<br><br>Shuichi has even less presence in volume 2 than he has in volume 1.<br>Reina has more scenes with Kumiko, but they're far less emotional that volume 1 scenes and Reina spends a lot more time obsessing over Taki-Sensei.<br><br>If they wanted to give a conclusive romance ending, they would either need to increase Shuichi's screen time and advance the romantic plot faster, or they would need to drop Reina's love for Taki-Sensei. And since they're deliberately making it ambiguous to mess with fans, they'll probably keep doing it in season two as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Season 1's romantic aspirations were nil. The western viewerbase really wanted to make it a horserace with winners and losers, and the show never tried to do that. Now if they stick to the novels going forward, it will be a singularly developed romantic relationship and no one will get btfo except shipping faggots.</br>  <br> It's obvious that there will be a second season </br>  <br>it was also cheap to produce<br><br>didn't KnK sell even less while also being expensive as fuck to animate?<br>and it still got two movies god damn</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Who gives a shit about romance in the first place?<br><br>all I want is pic related and some good fucking drama</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> they'll probably keep doing it in season two as well. <br><br>God the threads are gonna even be more shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Who gives a shit about romance in the first place? <br><br>Probably 90% of the people watch this show.</br></br></br>  <br> Reina has more scenes with Kumiko, but they're far less emotional that volume 1 scenes and Reina spends a lot more time obsessing over Taki-Sensei. <br><br>Let's not forget that most of her presence even in this season was anime-original. I doubt they're going to double back on that especially now she's gotten popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, it feels good to be part of the 10% that doesn't<br>I love the themes, the music ad characters<br><br>don't really care who ends up with whom</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair no one will if some fags didn't ship and derail the thread with their delusion on the first place.</br>  <br><br>No shitstorm will happen if Kyoani stops putting fuel into the fire. I like how they made Reina relevant early in the story, but the obnoxious yuri pandering needs to stop if they don't plan on yuri-end.</br></br>  <br>Good, good.</br>  <br>That's true, they'll probably add more anime original scenes in season 2, like they did in season 1.<br><br>But the thing is, adding Reina scenes in season 1 wasn't done just so they can "yuri bait". It was done because Reina is the second most important character in this part of the story, right after Kumiko.<br><br>Season/volume 1 is about Kumiko and Reina. Kumiko experiences a lot of character growth because of Reina - she learns to stand up for herself, she realizes she loves her euphonium, she realizes she also wants to become special. All of this happened directly because of Reina. So giving Reina more screen time in the first half of the anime where she had almost none made sense since it made the pacing of the story better and the episode 8 scene didn't come out of nowhere.<br><br>Season/volume 2 is about Asuka, Oboe-chan, and Oboe-chan's friend. Even Kumiko isn't a really important character here, and all Reina scenes are basically "muh Taki". If they were going to add strong yuri scenes like the ones from episode 8 or episode 11, Kyoani would have completely new, important plot points, and not just change things up like they did with e.g. second audition.<br><br>The only way I can imagine Reina playing an important role in season 2 if they decide to include an anime original plot about her slowly getting over Taki-Sensei. But I don't believe Kyoani would do something drastic, especially considering they added even more anime original scenes focusing on Reina's obsession with Taki-Sensei in season one than there were in volume one of the novel.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Reina scenes in season 1 wasn't done just so they can "yuri bait" <br><br>Changing a cheek poke to a finger slide down towards lip isn't bait? And the other 'super intimate' moments in the show? Please this is Kyoani we're talking here. You wish it wasn't yuri bait, but it is.</br></br></br></br>   mfw finally we couldn't know why Asuka was acting weird   <br>It gets explained later in the story, S1 didn't get that far. Go check the archive, spoileranon explained it.</br>  <br>You've got a pretty low opinion of KyoAni writers' abilities if you don't think they'd be able write in Reina as part of the existing plot rather than just tacking on a new story about her. I'd say that kind of adaptation is where KyoAni's writing is strongest, and it's something I'd probably expect from the sequel anyway, finding ways to tie originally disparate elements like Reina and Kumiko's "dates" in with the main plot rather than just being breathers.<br><br>I also think you're kind of overstating novel Reina's importance to Kumiko's character arc as a person rather than just as a concept or ideal.</br></br></br>  <br>I think anyone who doesn't trust KyoAni's writers is just being realistic. They suck ass at doing anything original except for K-On.</br>  <br>I never said Kyoani didn't add more yuri bait, or made the existing yuri bait even more yuri bait-y. What I'm saying is, Reina's increased presence isn't done just because of yuri bait.<br><br><br>I'm sure they'll give her more screen time and try to tie her into this plot by getting her involved, but that wouldn't make her the focus, like she was in season 1. She'll get more screen time, but I don't think she'll get a lot more relevance, unless they shake things up and add anime original stuff.<br><br>I imagine that in season two, Reina will mostly be Kumiko's support character (like the scene in episode 12 where Kumiko was practicing and she brought her water and tried to comfort her) or a comic relief character ("yandere" scene in the same episode). I don't expect a "major" yuri scene comparable to episode 8 or 11 ones in season 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rewatch and accept your otp  <br>Best news possible even if it's unconfirmed, couldn't help but scream YES.</br>  <br>Actually Pony Canyon is the one responsible for disc distributions (BD, DVD), no? Lantis would be the one for music.</br>  <br>I can't get over how fluffy her hair is</br>  <br>Yeah that's expected considering how music rights go. And trust me, there has been a huge upswing in Japan on all the music they showed in the series. I bet the OST will sell over 50K alone. Plus all the publicity with all HS bands playing them.</br>  <br> pic not related </br>  bump for someone translating it  If this has anything to do with the Pony Canyon panel at Anime Expo yesterday, all they said about season 2 of Euphonium was literally "we are in talks". There's no confirmation whatsoever that S2 is happening.  I want to see more Reina obsessing over Taki. That's all I ask for based kyoani gods.  <br>Season 2 is only a question of time. It's fated to happen</br>  <br> 90% <br> only IRC and /u/ degenerates shitting up the thread  <br><br>You are legitimate retarded, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni obviously wants to do it with the S2 hints, and they lead the production committee<br><br>Pony Canyon wants to it<br><br>The only one left is Yamaha.<br><br>So if you want more Hibike, buy Yamaha brass instruments with Hibike stickers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't trust Hanada. At all. If it was Yoshida (K-On, GuP) sure. But Hanada is just plain inconsistent. Chuuni 1 was good. Chuuni 2 sucked. KnK was meh. The only really good thing out him was Steins Gate. <br><br>If they bring Gatoh into this, then well, thing will get a whole lotta lewder.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't trust Hanada. At all. <br>Yeah, me neither.</br></br>  <br>Even Steins Gate had some problems because of him.  Fuck, Zero is going to end up shit, isn't it? </br>  <br><br>So it's basically like the stock answer they'd give any fan asking the question that isn't a confirmation or denial of anything either way but gets people off their back a bit and paying a little attention. Realistically the only answer that could be given.</br></br>  <br><br>You mean shitposting anime of the season with dozens of completely unnecessary threads of people jacking it to the show and memeposting.<br><br>Seriously that shows been over for less than a week now and the new seasons started and the quality level of posting on 4chan already feels like it's improved a fair bit from utterly insufferable to cresting tolerable. I can only imagine what it's going to look like a couple weeks from now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> So if you want more Hibike, buy Yamaha brass instruments with Hibike stickers. <br>Where?</br></br>  So you tell me that this anime is about a school band and... who else??? What is the big deal of it cause the argument is shit.  <br><br>From what I gather it's band + shipping wars. A lot of which involves /u/-bait.</br></br>  <br>The same as any anime that involves competition really. They want to reach the nationals and drama starts from there.</br>  <br>Yes it is.</br>  <br><br> good thing out him was Steins Gate.  <br> Even Steins Gate <br> plebs normalfags first anime  <br><br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mmm... interesting</br>  You just wait.  How much screen time do you think Oboe and Flute will get in the second season?  <br>That's not true. If you make a wish on a shooting star or when you blow out the birthday candles everyone knows that you can't tell what it is or it won't come true.</br>  Reminder that even if we get S2 all the 3rd years are gone forever.  <br>No.</br>  <br>No they're not, there are still two volumes of the novel before their graduation.</br>  GOMEN ASO BASE?!?!?!  <br>the novel's lore has officialy ended, and it only covers the first year</br>  <br> That hand <br> That back <br> That Not fluffy Kumiko <br>if you're going shitpost at least use good bait</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127593063 <br>hey</br>      <br>I'm really tired of this meme.</br>  <br><br>how can an old guy be this hot?</br></br>  <br/>  I'm an idiot for feeling some shred of hope towards an unconfirmed "we're in talks" rumor.<br>But goddamnit I love Kumiko.<br>Another squeak compilation is too sweet an idea to not get excited for.</br></br>  Can someone please post the girl's shoes?

Reina. </br>  <br>  Isn't this the kind of shit you'd do when you're happy and you've got a friend close to you? <br>9/10 bait.</br></br>    <br>I hope KyoAni fixes her knees in the BD</br>  <br>Prove me wrong you piece of shit. I just watched the episode and it was shit. This whole show is shit.</br>  <br>I'll never understand this sentiment.<br>Fair enough if you like a particular ship, but having it make or break a show for you?<br>Was shipping really the only part of the show you enjoyed?</br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko and Reina's relationship was the highlight. It was crystal clear in the ED too. What the fuck do I get in this end?<br><br>Fuck kyoani.</br></br></br>  Just watched the final episode and was hoping for a season two. I really enjoyed the music in this series. It was really faithfully reproduced. Speaking of, does anyone know the name of the piano interlude that gets played when Kumiko and Reina are together like in episode 8. I play the piano and I'd really like to get the sheet music or atleast a clean version of it.  So /a/, what is a rare Kumiko?  <br>You should've just avoided this anime if you were expecting explicit yuri.<br>The red string wasn't entirely wrong it did fated Kumiko and Reina to meet up and form a relationship again (least that's what I got out of it).</br></br>    <br>A rarely posted picture of Kumiko.<br>I've only seen this one posted once.</br></br>  What is the problem that the moderates AnimeSuki forum.<br>It has a user.<br>It has a User Eragon, he Accuses any User who does not like the genre yuri homophobic.<br>It attacks anyone who does not agree with their opinions</br></br></br>  <br>That ribbon is ridiculous</br>  <br>Wait, technically speaking, fan art of Kumiko doesn't count as real rare Kumiko, right? It's more like a counterfeit Kumiko.</br>  <br>It's cute.</br>  <br>It's distracting.</br>  <br>Do women wear ribbons in real life, or is that just an anime/cartoon thing, like those ridiculous sleeping hats?<br>I can't even imagine how it would look in real life.</br></br>  <br> going to anime forums </br>  <br>What more do you want? The show was never about romance and this is nice enough.<br>Seriously.</br></br>  <br>Some tryhards do yeah</br>  <br> giving antimugino replies </br>  <br>I've seen women wear ribbons but not as big as Yuuko's.</br>  <br>‚Ä¶but also refusing to turn down her offer of kindness, Shuuichi reluctantly wrapped it around his neck. Whether or not it was from Kumiko‚Äôs own body heat, its fabric had roughly felt warm to the touch.<br><br>‚ÄúIt suits you.‚Äù<br><br>She laughed in a somewhat curious way, and then suddenly placed her hand on his shoulder. Pressed against such force, Shuuichi spontaneously tilted his body towards Kumiko. The lifting of her heels had playfully come into sight. Kumiko stood tip-toed and she held her hand close to his ear, with her lips following suit. This froze Shuuich‚Äôs body in place, even while his heart was bouncing ‚Äî with Kumiko ever so close to him, Shuuichi found her presence difficult to ignore.<br><br>Kumiko‚Äôs voice had flowed, with the sigh of her breath tickling his ears, and the sweet fragrance of her shampoo striking his nose. Shuuchi did not move, but he was absolutely certain of the words she had just imparted to him.<br><br>‚ÄúI love you too, Shuuichi.‚Äù</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now do the one where they link their fingers together.</br>  <br>I've seen him posting his anti-yuri copypastas in the Aquarion thread earlier today.</br>  <br>That two-timing strumpet couldn't shut up about how much she loves UFO. What about UFO, Kumiko? What about UFO? I bet she'd fall for anything she can blow.</br>  <br>You don't have to keep posting this.</br>  <br>And that's as much as we'll get. What's the point? kyoani didn't fin a way. Fuck this.</br>  <br>There's yuri in Aquarion now or what</br>  <br>Oboe and Flute seems to have something going on. Plus if we get a season 2 we get more Yuuko/Natsuki shenanigans.</br>  <br>physical and real evidence.<br>different from delusions and hallucinations and fanwank created by fans of yuri Animesuki and /u/</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>The point is that the story isn't about romance at all.<br>Considering this, they got pretty far and this is gay as fuck. It also shows how much they're mutually attracted to each other. You're not 12 right? Kissing and/or sex isn't the only way to depict love between 2 characters.</br></br>  I wanna die, no more hibikes  ;_;   <br>Honestly they really don't give a shit.</br>  <br>What were you expecting? Regardless of what route they want to go down, there was never going to be a conclusive romantic end at this stage. They finished stronger than any of the other character pairs, and they'll doubtless find a way to put more of them in the second season if it gets one.</br>  <br>hibikek indeed</br>  <br> everyone replying to this weak bait trying to fuck up the thread  <br> <br>Jesus /a/ please die.</br></br></br>  It's because you do not know the Eragon User's AnimeSuki forum.<br>It is completely crazy.<br>Clearly he is not a yuri fan or sujhou-ai, she is a feminist revolucinaria.<br>She openly expresso hatred against men, and heterosexual relationships romanticism.<br>She Accuses anyone who does not like the genre or disagree with his view homophobic.<br>Mocks the other users who do not agree with it clogs the forums of fanart<br>Eragon has clear mental deficiencies</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reina isn't even that relevant besides the Taki plot in the second novel. Mizore, and the second years are the one's that will get the focus.</br>  <br>Still not buying it. They should be doing all kinds of shit after ep11 but all I got were some elbow nudges and that shit at the end? what's the point<br><br> Holding hands because they're expecting their results is finishing strong. <br>You're way too optimistic.<br><br>Sorry for questioning shit and not taking yuribait kindly, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They finished stronger than any of the other character pairs, <br>No they didn't. Anime made it pretty obvious that Reina has a huge obsession with Taki-Sensei. They even added anime original scenes to reinforce that.</br></br>  <br>Reina wasn't relevant for most of the first novel, either. They're hardly about to stop playing her up now that she's gotten really popular.</br>  <br>I understand the source material but no one really cares.</br>  <br>por qu√© me da la sensaci√≥n de que este post es un texto en espa√±ol traducido con el traductor de google?</br>  <br> obsession <br>I wouldn't call a crush that.</br></br>  <br>And it did the same for her and Kumiko. Of all of the potential (relevant) pairs, they finished strongest, and that's not likely to change once they have time to take the response on pixiv into account.</br>  <br>Adding anime original scenes in the first half of the season for Reina made sense since Reina was so important in the second half of the season.<br>Reina in season 2 literally doesn't matter. They might increase her screen time and involve her in the plot, but they would have to go completely anime original to make her the focus of the plot like she was in season 1.<br>She'll be around for more, but we probably won't get any "major" yuri scenes like the episode 8 or 11 ones.</br></br></br>  <br>She is though, the first novel was all about Kumiko and Reina, who made her change.</br>  <br>Kind of doubt it honestly. Reina doesn't give a shit about band drama, which will be most of the issues concerning second season. Kumiko and Reina already finished their character developments. Now Kumiko is learning about friendship while observing Mizore and Nozomi's drama. Of course Reina will still play a role but it will still be connected to Taki and that's it.</br>  <br> Pixiv <br> Less than 2000 results <br>kek. Rin and Haru were going strong in pixiv yet they added Sousuke to level the thing, regardless of its fanbase.</br></br></br>  <br>They are literally not a pairing at all since Reina loves Taki-Sensei. KumikoxShuichi is more likely than KumikoxReina.<br><br>And KumikoxReina might be the most popular pairing amongst the fans, but the anime itself and the pairing itself are not anywhere near as popular enough to start speculating that Kyoani might listen to the fans and change their plans for the story. And that's not even bringing up the fact that large majority of Japanese yuri fans don't actually want explicit yuri. You even had a minor backlash from "yuri fans" after episode 11.</br></br></br>  <br>It has been a while since i visited that shithole, but seems Hibike LNfans there kinda based. There was user who seems baiting yet no one replied, that's a nice one from them.</br>  <br>She was barely around before the festival, with even important plot strands like Kumiko being worried about what she said in middle school just not being present, and even after it she wasn't as important as she was in the anime - she inspired Kumiko to change, but mostly just served as a catalyst.</br>  No shit, you don't end it like that and not have a S2.  <br>They'll have a season 2, but Reina won't be the main focus.</br>  The story isn't about yuri shit, they added the pandering just to rile up the viewers and downplayed whatever het content the novel had. Kumiko and Reina have a relationship that's essentially a romantic friendship which is forged through mutual understanding, encouragement and respect which is perfectly fine given their circumstances. She's waifu material and KyoAni is going to milk her for all she's worth but they've already given her more screentime than she originally had in the novel and I'm saying this as a Reinafag. I would love it if they forced her in more but any more and it'll detract from the original story which is honestly a masterpiece that I'd hate to see wasted.<br><br>In the grand scheme of things the only relevant "protags" are the Euphonium trio since all the crap revolve around them and how they deal with their surroundings (arguable with the Mizore/Nozomi drama). Asuka is literally final boss tier in terms of plot relevance.</br></br>  <br>a few more fans of yuri think so especially /u/,<br><br>as well as charlotte, Aquarion Logos, Jitsu wa Watashi wa, Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou, Danchigai, Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan, Okusama ga Seito Kaichou!, Joukamachi no Dandelion, Gate: Jieitai Kanochi nite Kaku Tatakaeri, Classroom Crisis and Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai.<br> In all these animes have existed in topics / u /, with several ships already created, and various female characters turned into lesbian magically via distorted mind yurigag.<br>Fans of yuri live in another world, they watch anime differently, they try to rewrite the anime and characters, through their delusions and hallucinations for them all female characters are lesbians, and all her friends are girlfriend.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But how will the fans take it if Reina is obnoxiously all about Taki?</br>  <br>She'll matter if they decide to make her matter. When it comes to adaptations, KyoAni are great at finding more elegant ways to tie together elements from the original work,</br>  <br>Shuu got his moment with Kumiko which was pretty cute, and she blushed. So they didn't deviate from that bit of the novels plot line.<br><br>However the episode ended with Kumiko and Reina holding hands.</br></br></br>  <br> So they didn't deviate from that bit of the novels plot line. <br><br>They were supposed to link hands and intertwine their fingers.</br></br></br>  Pure and true love.<br>The only approved and created by God.<br>The one who love fruit can generate new life.</br></br>    <br>This is so cute, but you should really fix that cut in the thigh</br>  <br>Stop hurting Kumiko</br>  <br>Where?</br>  <br>those<br><br>you have to understand que vast majority of the fans are yurifag movement feminists. and follow his Nazi ideals.<br>They follow the Nazi ideals, instead of hating Jews and subjulgalos.<br>They hate men, and romanticism and relationships<br>heterosexual.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They toned it down from the novels. They toned down a lot of stuff from the novels. In the novels, when Kumiko heard Hazuki is going to confess to Shuichi, she felt sick in the stomach.<br><br>If they made them hold hands at this point, it would have been too much out of character for their portrayal of their relationship in the anime. <br><br>The scene we got was quite romantic on its own.<br>Look at Kumiko's face from ~00:15 to ~00:30. You can't honestly argue that this can't be seen as romantic.<br><br>And remember, Kumiko does not yet realize she loves Shuichi at this point, even in the novels. Merely that she missed having him around.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   (You)<br> Stop hurting Kumiko </br>  <br> wiener in hand <br>Why is Kumiko getting between the OTP?</br></br>  <br>I think this one will be hard though. Honestly I have a sick feeling its going to a chuu2 disaster again. Especially since its Hanada writing.</br>  <br>here</br>  <br>She's just being a tsun, tsun.</br>  <br>This. Eupho trio are the best girls in the novels.</br>  <br> Fans of yuri live in another world, they watch anime differently, they try to rewrite the anime and characters, through their delusions and hallucinations for them all female characters are lesbians, and all her friends are girlfriend. <br><br>Well, it's a good thing I'm not that type of yuri fan.</br></br></br>  best  <br>Don't worry. I'm absolutely certain that Kyoani won't butcher the season 2 here by going anime original like they did with chuu.<br><br>Chuu was originally a LN written for Kyoani. And it didn't even win the first place at the Kyoani awards, it only got a honorable mention.<br>H!E, on the other hand, was an original novel that was published by a third party. And this third party didn't even approach Kyoani for an anime adaptation, it was the other way around. A couple of people working for Kyoani read the novels and liked them so much that they started pushing for Kyoani making the anime adaptation of it, and eventually got the rights for it. Kyoani is doing this anime solely because they loved the story itself. <br><br>Also, look at other stuff Kyoani has done. KnK was also a light novel, and Kyoani heavily changed it. The second KnK movie (not the recap one), was literally made as an apology to the author of the LN and is written in such a way to bring the story back in line with the LN story. This, coupled with season 2 of chuu being a disappointment compared to season 1 (which was different from the original LN, true, but still, you know what I mean), makes me think that Kyoani has learned their lesson and isn't going to shit all over source material anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some nice photoshop.</br>  <br>Would be better if she had her geh face on.</br>  <br>Why does she sit like that?</br>  <br>What's the issue? Too jagged?<br><br>There is meant to be a gap there.</br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani is doing this anime solely because they loved the story itself.  <br><br>One of the things you do when you love a story is think about how you'd have told it differently.</br></br></br>  <br>The pixels don't look as smooth as the rest. You should draw a line there.</br>  <br>KumiRei is the popular choice. Nothing else to it.</br>  <br>True, but when it comes to professionals, that's mostly ironing out the details. Which is what Kyoani's been doing here.<br>Only people in the amateur, fanfiction crowd are the ones who want to "fix" the story by having it end "their" way.</br></br>  <br>KumikoxReina is popular amongst the fans, but as it stands right now, both in the anime and in the novels, it has 0% chance of happening.<br>Reina loves Taki-Sensei.<br>KumikoxShuichi is more likely because Shuichi does not have a canon love rival, so even if Kumiko isn't completely warmed up to him, he's still the only one in the running.</br></br></br>  Kumiko and Shuicchi OTP  <br>It's possible to love more than one person, anon, especially when you're a confused, hormonal teenager.</br>  I'm not very into kumiko and shuuichi but I fucking adore Taki and Reina.  <br>I'm trying to tell you that your opinion doesn't matter. The majority outweighs the minority.</br>  <br>This is /u/'s saddest excuse and it always makes me laugh. Keep 'em coming!</br>  <br>And I'm trying to tell you that what fans want doesn't matter. What matters is what the anime does. Anime gave us Reina's love for Taki-Sensei. End of story. This is not a popularity contest.</br>  <br><br>He's just popular because any user who manifests against that vessel is banned from furuns accused of homophobia.<br>So it's easy, anyone who does not like yuri, or disagree with the delirious obini√µes of yuri fans are banned and wrongly accused of homophobic<br>You must understand that ban other users, there opossi√ß√£o, it seems that is popular</br></br></br></br>  <br>What exactly is that an "excuse" for? Even her seiyuu thinks she doesn't understand what love is.</br>  <br>To be fair, you are massively, almost ludicrously homophobic.</br>  <br>Kumiko is the mc. She likes Reina. That's all that matters.</br>  <br> Shuichi does not have a canon love rival <br><br>While I agree that Kumiko/Reina has no chance, if we look at episode thirteen, it likely that Hazuki still has a crush on him. I'm not saying that it's going to happen or that a Shuichi/Kumiko ending is impossible, but it seems like an odd choice to leave in, especially for a character that will have little screentime if they decide to make a second season.</br></br></br>  <br>Seiyuu's opinion have neve mattered at all. Anyways, that article you're refering to was actually about Reina's feelings for Kumiko. In which she said they were of admiration rather than actual love.</br>  Soon  <br> Where did it say that? <br>Two chapters ago, I think. It was what I got. So is that? They need to give him high quality RC Cells to help him become a Kakuja?</br></br>  <br>I think I remember reading that in translated spoilers but when the IS translations came out it was different. <br> They need to give him high quality RC Cells to help him become a Kakuja? <br>Yeah that's how I saw it. He's been wanting to eat so much they have no choice but to bring him low class food. Because of how stupid his family is with that incest shit they now have easily manipulated rc cells, that while with others ghouls wouldn't really bother them it fucks up the tsukiyama family and sorta gives a reason why Shuu became the gourmet.</br></br></br>  <br>The only problem is that Shuu's a picky eater</br>  <br> why Shuu became the gourmet <br><br>Good point you make.<br>So Homo prince became goutmet because he is naturally driven to Good Food or because he knows he needs it.<br>His obsession with Kaneki points me to the first option.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only problem is that Shuu's a picky eater <br>Anon, don't make me to go back to not understand this shit.</br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127541<wbr>837/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Does the JCAT charge you or something?
