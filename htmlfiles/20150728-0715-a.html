Because I really want them but i'm a poorfag.    Why doesn't Reiji just maindeck three vanitys emptiness?  <br><br>If Yugo didn't give any contact data, how did they know they were approved?</br></br>  Ok /a/;<br>Just finished the 65th episodes of 5D's, and just like you said, It doesn't seem to be as great as the first 64 ones.<br>Do I really have to continue ? Will Crow stop stealing screen time ?</br></br>  <br>It's up to you. You might enjoy it, but it's a lot of filler until the WRGP starts.</br>  <br>Letters?<br><br>Sherry is around and then utterly ruined, that's about it. Also no Crow will not stop stealing screen time in 5Ds.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Part 2 Crow is actually better than Part 1 Crow because he actually steps back for others to take the spotlight and gets fleshed out with a proper background story<br><br>I'd say watch it for Crashtown and Aporia. Skip the filler though (except for Jack trying to search a job)</br></br></br></br>  <br>see </br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm261<wbr>17250<br><br>They actually managed to make a better OP.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>If you want to send a letter you need an address to send it to.<br>My bet is Yugo just waited a few hours in whatever building he went to fill out an application, till they were approved</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thank you. I'll give it a try then.</br></br></br>  <br>BUY RAIDRAPTORS</br>  <br>This really makes me wish Arc-V had Shun as the MC and Sora as the main villain.</br>  There is nothing wrong with touching Reira.   mfw Crow is the one who gets into the finals against Yuya   <br>What<br><br>Crow doesn't even steal screentime in the Dark Signer arc. I don't even think Crow does that much in Episode 65 bar getting mad at Jack and Ghost.<br><br>Fuck off with this Crow hate meme, it's getting annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow beats Yuya and it's Crow vs. Jack and it completely ignores everything about Arc-V and turns into a 5Ds duel </br>  <br>I like how he went to Yuya's room first</br>  <br> Crow wins by spamming Blizzard <br>Best boy, cant remember the last duel that so closely resembles real ones</br></br>  <br>Sawatari vs. Security, so not that long ago.</br>  So why doesn't Yuya go searching for Yuzu now that apparently the doors are unlocked instead of hugging on Reira  <br>I wouldnt be surprised if that's not part of the reason he left his room, but calling Reiji a piece of shit comes first</br>  <br>A YGO MC can only be straight for so long.</br>  <br><br>He misses his shota Sora. Reira is just a temporarily replacement.</br></br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm263<wbr>13298<br><br>They also managed to make adorable Serena videos.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>He was about to leave, then Reira comes running to him. Reiji comes in after his little bro. Either takes his little bro back with him or leave Reira to cool himself with Yuya's presence. Meanwhile he closes the door behind him as he leaves.  :^) </br>  Why is thi scene so based  <br>Because it's the power rangers</br>  now that I think about it Johan's crystal beasts got two pendulum monsters, does that mean we'll see him in Arc-V?  <br>Yuya look like he wants to punch the viewers in the face</br>  <br>Possible, but I doubt it. CyDras got Infinity but unless Kaiser is running a Xyz/Fusion Resistance within Academia then what cards come out don't mean much.</br>  Why were people in the last thread saying Gon handed Crow the win? He attacked, same as he was planning on doing before he heard the story, and he didnt have any follow up plays  <br>Blizzard is the only non trash card he used.</br>  <br>Listening to the story gave Crow enough time to get to an Action Card, or something to that extent.</br>  <br>Trying to shit on Crow while justifying Gongenzaka. Crow could have easily put his monster in Defense Mode to keep off the attack and Crow could have re-done his Blizzard combo. Crow was going to win the whole time, Action Card or not.<br><br>But you know, hate clouds the eyes of judgement.</br></br></br>  <br> Stopping to monologue and listen to backstory <br>But everybody does that in duels</br></br>  <br>It is. Not our fault you have dirty thoughts when watching a anime based on a children's card game.</br>  Will Moonlights ever get printed?  <br>Right after fossils.</br>  <br>The only shot for them is the manga (assuming she uses the same deck) or the friendship cup. <br><br>If it's just more OTK/FTK Cat Butterfly stuff then we'll never see them sadly.</br></br></br>    <br>but now that action duel's are the new thing you get punished for it, Gon didn't let Crow win he took a risk that ended in Crow's favor</br>   Want to get into the new yugioh <br> Watch the latest episode <br> Crow motherfucking Hogan <br> oh shit nigga <br> Plays all his old Blackwings that I used to love playing <br> suddenly Assault Blackfeather <br> mfw <br><br>When did he get these?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   I was only nine years old <br> I loved Crow Hogan so much, I owned all the Blackwings and merchandise <br> I pray to Crow every night, thanking him for the food I have been given <br> "Crow is love," I say, "Crow is life" <br> My dad hears me and calls me a filthy commons <br> He is obviously jealous of my devotion to Crow <br> I called him a traitor, a sellout to the Tops <br> He beats me 2-0 because of Red Demon's Dragon <br> I am crying now, because I'm hungry <br> I post about it on /a/, and they tell me CROW SUCKS <br> I feel a warmth moving towards me <br> I fell something touch me <br> It's Crow <br> I am so happy <br> He whispers into my ear, "Buy Blackwings" <br> He grabs me with his unwashed hands and puts me on my hands and knees <br> I'm ready <br> I activate my duel disk for Crow <br> He summons a gajillion Blackwings <br> I have no skill, but I do it for Crow <br> I can feel my hand emptying as my field starts to fill up <br> I push against his force <br> I want to please Crow <br> He yells a mighty yell as he tunes his synchro monsters to summon another Synchro monster <br> My Dad walks in <br> Crow looks him deep in the eyes and says, "For the children!" <br> Crow jumps out the window after stealing all of our cards and all of our food <br> Crow is love, Crow is life </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to impregnate Selena!  And not take responsibility.  </br>  <br> but now that action duel's are the new thing you get punished for it <br>And everybody still does it, it isnt treated as a significant thing. Nobody said Meiru handed Yuya the win when she talked so much about MUH FUTURE and he ended up grabbing an Action Card just in time</br></br>  <br>exactly</br>  <br>This is suposed to be an alternate version of Crow, Arc-V has a multiverse plot (with Fusion, Synchro and Xyz having their own dimension, the main characters come from the "Standard" dimension that can use all the summon methods plus the New Pendulums.<br>Crow either got his cards from his mentor like in 5Ds, got them in a dumpster or stole them from some rich people</br></br>  My sides. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bvP<wbr>NNSiGQbo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br> spoiler <br><br>What is wrong with you?</br></br></br>  <br> He's a Fusion </br>  <br>Have you ever taken care of a baby? It's hard work.</br>  <br>It's more that Gon decided to help Crow out with his problems and he did this after contemplating what would happen if he won. Besides the fact he could have put his monsters in defence position doesn't matter when he didn't. Just like Hokuto could have used Pleaides in the Battle Phase even though he didn't.</br>  <br> not wanting to marry Selena and have many children with her <br><br>Ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably in a Fusion based version of Highspeed Riders like the Phantom Knights are getting printed in the XYZ booster version of that. Ancient Gear support would probably be in that too and maybe Yuri's archetype as well.</br>  <br>what will Yuri's dragon do?</br>  <br>I don't think it matters either way, if Crow had not told his sob story, he was still going to grab an Action Card that would help him either way. You can literally see a bunch of Action Cards just planted into the ramps.</br>  <br>Disgusting.<br><br>You take care of those crude and strong children you create.<br><br>This Anon knows whats up, even if he pairs Shun/Serena together like a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  Since LDS is called LID in the dub, what will the Lancers be called since the Lance Defense Soldiers title doesn't work  <br> It's more that Gon decided to help Crow out with his problems <br>He did that with Yuya as well. Stuff like that happens plenty of times, people just apply double standards for this because they have an unreasonable hate boner for Crow and they think Gon should stay in the tournament, ignoring the fact he's already gotten a fuckton of duel time</br></br>  <br>My guess is that it will be a dark dragon level 7 2500 ATK/2000 DEF Fusion that has something to do with level 5 or higher monsters.</br>  <br>Yuya: Offensive Double Attack<br>Yuto: Offensive Double Attack + Attack Raise<br>Yugo: Preventative Negation and Destruction + Attack Raise<br>I'd assume Yuri's will have a stronger effect than Yugo's but be similar.<br><br>Especially considering Yuzu's Fusion monster (which was likely on the field at some point) was no longer on the field.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lost In Dimensions</br>  <br><br>But they devoted 3 entire seconds of the 2nd OP to her summon.</br></br>  <br>They'll be Lancers In Distress once I get ahold of them~~</br>  <br><br>Yeah I know it's scripted. I'm just explaining the viewpoint. He could win by spamming burn action cards if Hikki decided that. <br>People are annoyed Gon didn't just attack Crow before the sob story.</br></br></br>    <br> implying Yuri stands a chance against the strongest Lancer </br>  <br>You best sit down little boy, if Shun couldn't beat me, then you sure as hell can't. Hell I wasn't even at full strength dueling you.</br>  <br>You never even dueled Shun, Reiji. Stop taking Reira's drugs.</br>  <br>Who? The hippo? Well, at least he can bring a Dragon like mine with hi- Wait, no he can't, that's his real effect. Silly me.</br>  <br> forgetting that Reiji said Shun could do whatever he wanted if he managed to beat Reiji before walking away <br> Shun is then Reiji's bitch who listens to every word he says <br><br>It's implied they dueled at some point and Shun lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying someone who lost to a fusion is a good measurement of skill </br>  <br>Lightning Inter-dimensional Defenders.<br><br><br>Not enough Time/Stargazer fanart.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it isn't. Reiji said he would duel Shun after the tournament.</br>  <br>You talking shit?</br>    <br>Man if Ryo return he's going to fuck shit up badly<br><br>I want him to get a duel like Jack where he just utterly detroys someone<br><br>Maybe.. Sawatari? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to marry Yuri!</br>                <br>Done.  Trump Witch &amp; Girl are still best. </br>   yfw Crow didnt use lv4 at all this duel <br>will he ever use Black Whirlwind?</br>  <br>NTR!!!<br><br> Incidentally, there is a new Frightfur, but I guess I'm being a slowpoke here now <br><br> http://i.imgur.com/eM2DTK9.png </br></br></br></br></br>  You guys are never going to give Crow a chance. You're going to hate him no matter what. I wanted Gon to win though I didn't expect him too and I'm not getting mad over it.  Daily reminder to say NO to fusion degeneracy and join the resistance.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K-q<wbr>LR-uGLWQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> say NO to fusion degeneracy and join the resistance <br> Judai <br><br>Anon...</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would have cried tears of joy if Crow picked up an Action Trap.</br>  <br> expecting /a/ to be reasonable </br>  <br>Crow hater usually butthurt Akifag and Rua/Rukafag that still cant get over from 5d's.</br>  <br>The Tigers are really good, only other good cards are Sheep and Wings.</br>  <br>Well his victory in this first duel was undeserved. Not a good sign in getting me to like him. His sob story didn't move me either. Gon's hand was very obviously designed to help Crow and it's rare that it feels like that. Crow might as well have had two turns in a row.<br><br>Believe me I would have probably died of laughter.</br></br></br>  <br>i want to see timegazer's meaty dick inside yuya's tight boipussy.</br>  <br> Well his victory in this first duel was undeserved <br>Says you<br><br> His sob story didn't move me either <br>I liked, the dynamic of him needing the kids to give his life some actual purpose as much as they needed him was nice<br><br> Gon's hand was very obviously designed to help Crow <br>It really wasnt particularly bad compared to lots of MC duels (e.g. Harold summoning his Nordic God against Yusei then drawing nothing but normal monsters support)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I actually kinda want to see that happen. Crow vs Jack is something I already wanted to see in 5D's. <br>Weird how that never happened</br></br></br>  <br><br>b-bu muh Aki</br></br>  <br><br>Out of all GX characters Johan and Yubel have the best chance of appearing</br></br>  <br>i want to have a threesome with yuya and reira.</br>  <br><br>His finisher was really based<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IYo<wbr>OX3FO6tY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaiser, Edo, and Manjoume have better chances to appear than Johan and especially Yubel. Hell Asuka (considering she became a teacher there) has a better chance of appearing.</br>  <br> Yubel <br>Yubel has a complicated as fuck backstory, and wasnt actually in the series for all that long comparatively. I'd put Manjoume above both for likeliness</br></br>  <br><br> Reiji walks in to see this <br><br>What will he do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>Its head is too small, it looks too stupid to take seriously. That's nothing compared to the Centaur that Gon summoned.</br>  <br>Absolutely EROTIC</br>  <br><br>Did you get that pissed when Gon used that very same move to block Security only to get his monsters stolen and then for Shun to come and save the day?</br></br>  <br>I'd like to think Kaiser, Edo or Chronos have a decent chance of showing up.</br>  <br><br>I think Level 4 darkness winged beasts are Shun's thing now<br><br>Wonder if we'll ever see Sirocco, Bora, Gale combo again</br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Sora is canonically more lewd.<br><br> Shota duel when? </br></br></br>  <br> Johan <br><br>Why?<br><br>He doesn't have any Fusions</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really considering at least they did something in being used to summon Rise Falcon. <br>The Magnets did literally nothing but deplete Gon's hand of two cards so they could justify the loss easier.</br></br>  <br>Shut up<br><br>Gon's deck is based on samurais yet samurai centaurs doesn't sound stupid?<br><br>Shut up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he has PENDARUMU.</br>  <br>But he doesn't have any Fusions</br>  <br>It's actually a Samurai Centaur Fox</br>  Why is Crow so shit he ruined the series again  <br> samurai centaurs doesn't sound stupid? <br>It does sound stupid but it looks great. That Blackfeather is just bad. Raikiri was more threatening than that thing. Same for the old stuff like Armor Master.<br><br>Just like in 5Ds it was already becoming meh. Crow just happened to be there both times.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And if some different Arc-V OC donut steel character replaced Crow it wouldn't be anything different and you guys wouldn't be throwing your panties in rage<br><br>Fuck off faggots, or you know what, stay here so I can drink my coffee while laughing at all this ass devastation</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Magnets did literally nothing but deplete Gon's hand of two cards so they could justify the loss easier. <br>Gon wanted to stall while he gathered his Pendulum Scale. It isnt remotely an unreasonable play by anime standards</br></br>  <br><br>Its name is Superheavy Demon Beast Kyu-B. So it's technically not a Superheavy "Samurai", but rather treated as one. Same for the two Pendulum Gon used</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah though he could have stalled with his hand trap monster anyway. Could've used the magnets as Synchro fodder.<br><br>But regardless Crow needed to show of the ability of Raikiri. We haven't seen it in the anime yet so breaking through a stall barrier was the best way to do so</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah though he could have stalled with his hand trap monster anyway <br>That would have required him to take a direct attack first, and doesnt establish as much field presence as the lock monsters<br><br>  Could've used the magnets as Synchro fodder <br>That was probably his plan for next turn</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Join in.</br>  <br>Crow butthurt is pretty much the only thing that keeps these threads going recently. Even the Ruriposting has decreased massively. This is one of the lowest hype points since the Eita duel but at least we had a plot episode after the Michio and Eita duels.<br><br>More or less this. What I'm saying that if Crow had two turns nothing would have changed since the Magnets were obviously there to die to Raikiri.</br></br></br>  Think Yuya will learn how to Accel Synchro and Rank-Up Magic?<br><br> I hope they introduce an advanced Fusion method. Or would that just be single monster "fusions" like Masked Heroes? </br></br>  <br>The Synchro Arc sucks. It might as well be a Filler Arc with a Filler Villain because we already had a main villain in Akaba Luthor.<br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Synchro Arc is the new Crashtown.  I hate this 5Ds flavour. ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Contact Fusion?</br>  <br>I'm surprised OERD wasn't a Rank-Up<br><br>But I guess all Odd-Eyes monsters can't be any level under 7 or else shit</br></br></br>  <br>I love art of characters with their monsters.</br>  <br><br>You're getting butthurt over nothing. Stalling until Gon has the right cards and can start his play is what he's always done. Remember his first duel against Yaiba? Gon didn't do anything his first turn except play some weak ass monster to stall. His new attack lock strategy is pretty advanced compared to his old Kabuto play</br></br>  <br><br>Super poly</br></br>  <br>You're just jealous he's stealing Yuya from you, Sora.</br>  <br>Sora vs. Reira when?</br>  <br>Well this won't end with him getting fucked in every hole by them</br>  <br>Hopefully once they reach Fusion. I want to see Reira's horrified face when Sora summons his fusion monsters.<br><br><br>doujinshi when</br></br></br></br>  <br> Reira ends up beating Sora with his own Fusions <br><br>How pissed would Sora be?</br></br></br>    <br>I'm not remotely butthurt at all since I'm not really interested in this arc anymore. I'm just saying that the Magnets accomplished literally nothing whatsoever but losing him two cards. Gon more or less had one turn where he did something and Hikki made him use really bad cards because muh Blackwings. The restriction on the Synchro is hilariously designed. So are the Pendulum effects especially the increase level by one effect. He couldn't think of anything beter than that could he.</br>  <br>A lot.<br><br>I want Sora to card Reira and Gongenzaka.<br><br>(Only first one is a serious one. Second not-so-much because Sora seems to care for his inmediate friends).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do you keep posting this. It isn't even an impressive duel and shaddoll guy played like shit</br></br>  <br>Chances are Reira is gonna betray the Lancers anyways, I remember reading something yesterday or the day before from an old screencap about the Akabas and how Reira is basically the Lancelot of them.</br>  <br> So are the Pendulum effects especially the increase level by one effect </br>  <br>I want Sora to try carding Yuya so he can keep him forever.</br>  <br>What if Reira betrays them and joins Fusion to be with his father but Sora betrays Fusion because of Yuya's EGAO and joins the Lancers?</br>  <br> Reira will ditch Mommy and Big Bro for Daddy Luthor. <br> Then he'll ditch them all for Yuya. </br></br>  <br>"Shiiiiishoooo... Shiiiishooo..."</br>  <br>Reira just wants a big brother who loves him.</br>  <br>Silly Sora, I'm sure if you asked nicely and faked it well enough, Yuya would probably follow you of his own accord.</br>  <br>Not everyone can be this guy, anon.</br>  <br>Reira is definitely betraying, and Sora is definitely getting carded by Dennis or Yuri after he starts having fun and EGAOing.<br><br> Reira is then immediately carded by Leo <br><br>Reiji is King Arthur who loved Lancelot/Reira, but is betrayed anyways.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm just saying that the Magnets accomplished literally nothing whatsoever but losing him two cards <br>They made Crow go into Raikiri to get over them, its not like they just died during the end phase for no reason</br></br>  <br>I wish Mari gave him a fucking chance.<br><br><br>What's the timeline, more or less? I got the impression that Leo left for Fusion shortly after Reira was born, so I can see him winning him over and then carding him first chance he gets because he doesn't really care about him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Leo seems to have left 3 years prior to the story, right before Xyz was attacked, because that's when Reiji went to Academia and tried saving Serena while he was there. <br><br>Depends on how old Reira is I guess. He could be anywhere from 5 to like 8 or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Leo seems to have left 3 years prior to the story, right before Xyz was attacked, because that's when Reiji went to Academia and tried saving Serena while he was there. <br>Its also about when Yushow dissapeared, and when extra deck methods appeared in standard</br></br>  <br>And when Jack became King. WHAT IS THE TRUTH ABOUT 3 YEARS AGO!?</br>  <br>Synchro was a mistake<br>Konami</br></br>  <br>Well Extra Deck methods is probably Reiji becoming aware of the other dimensions and just making cards.<br><br>Yusho though is interesting, considering the shadow figures he has behind him, two of them are Sherry and Ushio, and one looks like Jack, another looks like either Bruno or Kaiser. I'd imagine Yusho has his own Lancers after finding out about Xyz's destruction.<br><br>Probably knows Yusho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IS THIS HARUHI SUZUMIYA OR SOMETHING?!<br><br><br>Indeed.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Well Extra Deck methods is probably Reiji becoming aware of the other dimensions and just making cards. <br>But it's more likely Leo first brought ED methods and used them to establish an LDS monopoly</br></br>  <br>It's possible, who really knows though.<br><br>Also picture in question. <br><br>Looks like Jack on the middle left, Sherry and Ushio on the right, other girl, I guess might be Droite, closest I can figure out, top or bottom left is Bruno, I can't tell, the other might be Kaiser, one above Jack, who knows?<br><br>I know someone had a bigger screen of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Probably knows Yusho. <br>Probably the exact reason why he has a card like Tuner Magician in his deck. Remember Yusho's only known monster is Sky Magician and it's name written exactly like the other magician cards.</br></br>  <br> Looks like Jack on the middle left, Sherry and Ushio on the right, other girl, I guess might be Droite, closest I can figure out, top or bottom left is Bruno, I can't tell, the other might be Kaiser, one above Jack, who knows? <br>Those were people he beat in his entertainment duel climb to the top. It was just a cute reference, not an actual canon description, it makes no sense for actual Jack to be there</br></br>  <br>Don't underestimate the power of magicians.</br>  <br> it's name written exactly like the other magician cards. <br>Tuning Magician, yes, but if you're talking about Sky Magician, then no it's not the same.</br></br>  A gift  <br>Why would you want to bully Reira? He deserves nothing but good things and happiness.</br>  <br>And the best thing is with solid vision all of their scenes could actually happen if the staff ever wanted.</br>  <br>Bruno, Gauche, Dunno, Johan, III, Sherry, Ushio.</br>  <br> Hey little fella, this is an interview for the winner, do you have anything to sa- <br> "Give me back my fucking teddy, nobody touches my fucking teddy, fucking background-ass NPC charac-tater." </br></br>  If we were to get one more cameo for Synchro from 5Ds, who would you want it to be? And I mean only one (so if that means only one of the twins for example), and no Yusei.  <br><br>But of course. They need to shill Black-Winged dragon's equivalent to Scarright. Crow confirmed for winning friendship cup.</br></br>  <br>Aki.</br>  <br>BRUNOOOOOO</br>  <br>I need to see that racing suit. And you know exactly which one.</br>  <br>But there's only two of those and three of them..</br>  <br>Maybe we'll see Female Bruno from the Tag Force games.

They had Crow win after all.</br>  <br>Since KoA makes them they hire most probably western artists and since DA is western i see why they remind you of it. They want to capture a certain flair but they end up over-designed. As for the effects it's simple, they try to make new and unique playstyles, Kozmo banish themselves, BA are all lvl 3, ss themselves when you dont have S/T and have effects that activate when they are sent to the grave. They try to create a unique playstyle and make them relevant by adding extra effects that are good in the current state of the game.<br>The result is an overdesigned card with an average of 3 unique and good effects, what you would do when you would create a card.</br></br>  <br>Carly really does have some huge tits.</br>  Is there a reason why we still haven't seen at least a flashback of Ruri?  <br>Because Ruri is yandere as fuwark and releasing her too soon will cause the series to implode.</br>  <br>Hadn't he only lost to the MC before once after being in charge 90% of the duel. Doesn't seem like an always lose to me.</br>  <br>Konami loves your tears.  And mine too, why Sora hasn't appeared yet?! ;_; </br>  I can not understand why people run this deck  <br>I feel your pain, anon. I'm hoping Academia invades before the Friendship Cup ends so we get to see Sora again.</br>  <br>Maybe he'll finally win onscreen. Preferably against someone decent</br>  <br>Yes, she does, I wonder who gets it from her.</br>  <br>It's PERFECT.</br>  <br>It really is, even Yugo's clothes are similar.</br>  <br><br> Sora <br><br>Who was he again? Oh yeah the blue haired kid that used Entermatchines</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yugo confirmed to be Yuya's Bruno when he's in his soul</br></br>  <br>I just had a pretty fun one with the AI: it milled almost the whole deck, triple danted, and activated Vanitty's, and my T R A I N S had no out, so I went and tried to survive until it decked out. I end my turn with it having two cards left in the deck, and as it draws I realise I can survive only one more battle p-<br> AI activates Upstart Goblin <br>In my turn I then proceeded to honour the current Synchro arc and (since Upstart destroyed Vanity) proceeded to OTK with 300LP left instead of endiing turn to win by deckout.</br></br></br>  <br>He's just the best character in Arc-V.</br>  <br><br><br>Oh shit, now after that whole Kotori shit with Shun and Sho/Sora, I'm kind of curious if all of them have some relation to other characters at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>The BA deck on ygp's AI mills the living fuck out of it's deck, it's crazy.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>No dude, that was against some guy named xgrimmx<br><br>Whenever I play the AI BA I usually don't even get to the point where they summon 3 Travelers</br></br></br>  <br>Clear Wing is a direct counter to Dark Rebellions effect.<br>Odd-Eyes Rebellion is Dark Rebellion evolving to overcome that weakness.<br><br>I'm thinking Fusion Dragon will counter Clear Wings effect but be weak to Dark Rebellions.</br></br></br></br>    Wait... so did Crow do an Accel Synchro summon? That was pretty lackluster. <br>You guys had hyped it up quite a bit more than it was worth.</br>  <br>A picture of a pile of bodies doesn't answer the question.</br>  <br>I fucking hope that's the case of Yugo's parents.</br>  <br> Because that's wrong, he only lost to Yuya before now <br>He also lost to Olga, m8.</br></br>  <br>Not just an Accel Synchro, a Delta Accel Synchro.</br>  <br>SOON<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rcL<wbr>3kAtbcYE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>But robots don't have reproductive organs.</br>  <br><br> Shun uses Xyz Change <br> music, flames, CGI, audience is freaking the fuck out <br><br> Crow uses Delta Accel Synchro <br> no one fucking cares </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So the fact it was treated as a standard-ass Synchro summon more or less shoots down any hopes of fancy Clear Minding? Hope you like Rank Ups.</br>  <br>Yugo might get to do Accel.<br><br>Or maybe the staff really is a bunch of filthy fucking Shunfags</br></br></br>  <br>Still better than Des-Toy Mad Chimaera, a Triple Fusion of Fusion monsters.</br>  <br>You wanna run that by me one more time</br>  <br><br><br>Nah, only a monster with<br>"1 Tuner Synchro Monster + 1 or more non-Tuner Synchro Monsters" like Quasar can be considered Accel synchro.<br><br>Crow's blackwing could still be summoned without using synchro monster as material. So nope.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It wasn't an Accel Synchro Summon. You can use a Synchro Tuner to Synchro Summon normal Synchro monsters. Or was it stated that it required a Synchro Tuner?<br><br> The term "Accel" Synchro Summon was 5D's/Anime only. In the OCG/TCG they were just normal Synchro Monsters with Synchro Tuner restrictions. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Krillin literally wished 18 back to a human before Gero made her a cyborg, fuck off.</br>  <br>Or maybe a Synchro summon with Synchro monsters is so goddamn plain it's not worth getting excited about.<br><br>XYZ changing is at least turning a monster into a different one, whereas chaining monsters together is what Synchro is all about, whether Synchros are involved is besides the point.</br></br></br>  <br>18 is a cyborg thus has reproductive organs. Bruno is an android version of a dead man tasked to carry out his will. He's just mechanical while 18 just hasy cybernetic implants.</br>  <br><br>18 is still a cyborg. Krillin's wish couldn't come true, so he just wished the bomb inside her to disarm/disappear. She can and always could have kids.</br></br>  <br>And the dragon said "No,I'm fucking useless so I can't do that"</br>  <br>18 is still a cyborg, Krillin only wished for the self destruction bomb to be removed<br>do you even DragonBall?</br></br>  <br>Or maybe, Accel synchro means you can summoned it on the opponent's turn?<br>That was the case with formula synchron and Accel Synchron, right?</br></br>  <br>You should really watch something properly before making up bullshit about it.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Caught me :^)</br></br></br></br>  http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Accel_<wbr>Synchro_Monster<br><br>http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Accel_<wbr>Synchro_Summon</wbr></br></br></wbr>  <br>That was a Synchro that can be treated as a Tuner not a real Synchro Tuner. It wasn't an Accel Synchro. You could summon that Blackwing with anything, it just gets bonuses from Synchro Monsters as material.</br>  <br> Jokes on you! I was only pretending to be retarded! </br>  <br> says something retarded <br> gets caught <br> admits it <br>I don't understand.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you expect them to explain that technicality in future? <br>There's a good chance we won't see any Accel, considering the amount of time we have in Synchroverse is limited as is.</br></br>  My dad works at Arc-V, turns out that the backstory is actually a Warcraft Crossover. The cardgames switch over to Heartstone when Face Hunter Yuya goes up against Miracle Rogue Yuzu  <br>I will forever pray to hear Clear Mind once again.</br>  <br>But it's on YouTube.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V33<wbr>eMYC5C0Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> There's an even more powerful kind of Synchro summoning, the Accel Synchro summon!  <br> But Crow, didn't you do that before with your three Black Feather Synchros? <br> No uh, see, that was with a Synchro monster that was treated as a Tuner, not an actual... also you need to be in a mystical state known as Clear Mind, which allows you to- <br> So it's like Rank-Up except harder and more stupid? <br> IT'S NOT LIKE RANK-UP! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's a good chance we won't see any Accel, considering the amount of time we have in Synchroverse is limited as is. <br><br>We're not stuck here for an entire year?</br></br></br>  <br>Is there really any doubt at this point that the staff is nothing but a bunch of dirty Shunfags?</br>  <br>He lost to Aladdin actually. If you can even call it a loss when it went exactly as he planned and Yuzu gets wrecked without him.</br>  <br>Well they're doing a good job with show, they have great taste in characters; can the devs do no wrong?</br>  <br>I doubt the business in Synchroverse will extend past the Tournament, provided the whole thing isn't interrupted.

What's that? <br> Umm.. uh... oh! The almighty CONTACT FUSION!  <br> Huh... a Fusion summon that doesn't leave you with a card disadvantage? Neat, Beast Eyes can do that. <br> Oh?

They might as well always be face up.<br>Other than Blackwings, why is Crow here?</br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile, Leo wins by doing absolutely nothing.</br>  <br> There's an even more powerful kind of Ritual summoning!  <br> What? No there isn't.  <br> lol, I know right? </br></br></br>  <br>I TRIED TO WARN HER<br>DONT SPEAK I SAID<br>DONT DUEL I SAID<br>YUUMA I SAID<br>BUT NOW ITS TOO LATE, THE BITCH IS FUCKED, I HOPE THE CUDDLES WERE WORTH IT<br><br><br> Then what is 'B-Force'? <br>Shinjis insect themed deck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Synchro was a mistake<br>Konami</br></br>  <br> Why didn't Gon use Flutist on Action Card that Crow got? <br>Anime flutist doesnt have that effect as far as I know.<br><br><br> Other than Blackwings, why is Crow here? <br>He's done plenty to move things along<br> Syncro native <br> Clued in Yuya in what was going on <br> Possible relationship to Jack <br>Why is anyone here?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> There's an even more powerful type of Pendulum summoning!  <br> What? Really? <br> GOD I HOPE NOT </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why Crow and not some other generic Synchro thug? Why Jack and not some other generic Synchro jackass?<br>Why is Konami so damn good at vacuuming up money?</br></br>  <br>Taking into account that the whole plot revolves around alternate dimensions based on previous series, they would have been complete idiots not to bring back a few old characters for nostalgia and merch money.</br>  <br>We have Pendulum Xyz. Pendulum Fusion and Pendulum Synchro eventually.</br>   Yuzu absorbs Selena   <br>Quick-play Pendulum and Pendulum trap soon.</br>  <br>I'd rather have it the other way around. It'll make the eventual reunion between Yuya and Yuzu more emotional.</br>  <br>Until we're able to overlay two Scale 4 Pendulum monsters, or tune a scale 2 Tuner Pendulum monster with a scale 6 non-tuner Pendulum monster, we'll be A-ok.</br>  <br>How is that cliff face able to talk?</br>  Who has the best eyes?  <br> Anime flutist doesnt have that effect as far as I know. <br>Wait really. I thought that he was made to use Flutist so it would have some significance other than a random LV3. Then he didn't activate it Ugh, as a Samurai player it is annoying that it wasn't retconned so it was actually good. Whatever thanks for explaining. Gotta have Gon lose so we can wank Crow I guess.<br><br> Syncro native <br> Clued in Yuya in what was going on <br> Possible relationship to Jack <br>Yeah but he isn't interesting at all. Are Japan happy to see him? Is the reaction anything like the west which ranged from meh to oh great more Blackwings. Most of which will be gatbage anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit a floating lollipop</br>  <br>No no Pixiv artist, you've got your headcanon all wrong.<br><br>Evil Yuzu should be glowing with LIGHT as a contrast to Evil Yuya glowing with DARKNESS</br></br></br>  <br>Dunno, but Strong Ishijima has some killer makeup.<br><br><br>Japanese fans are going fucking crazy over Crow being back. They seriously love him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mieru for sure.</br>  <br><br>Holy shit Sho, get bigger glasses you blind midget.</br></br>  <br>Wait, I could swear Michio opened his eyes once.</br>  <br>Shuns eyes are the best.</br>  <br>Masumi's eyes look lewd.</br>  <br>It would've been cool if they'd given Crow a new archetype altogether, like Dark Feathers or some shit. That way there'd be more contrasts to 5ds, as Jack now has a Red Demons Titties archetype to himself.</br>  <br>Is that puff of smoke claiming it's strong? <br><br><br>That's because everything about Shun is the best.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought that he was made to use Flutist so it would have some significance other than a random LV3 <br>It still lets you special summon a Superheavy from the hand, Gon used it Yuya, where i'm pretty sure he could have used that effect if it had it. And it isnt even that bad a reduction, look at what they did to most of Yuzus cards in the anime<br><br> Is the reaction anything like the west which ranged from meh to oh great more Blackwings <br>Crow does actually have fans of the character</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wow, you could mistake a lot of characters genders by looking at only their eyes. Masumi looks butch as hell.</br>  I want Shun to impregnate me!  <br>It's funny because when Shun first showed up, I thought he had the stupidest looking hairstyle to date. Now it's possibly the most badass in my eyes.</br>  <br>I want to impregnate Shun!</br>  <br>Only if your name is  Ruri .</br>  <br>How does his hair even work? Is all of it his hair? It looks like he's wearing some retarded hat thing and the lighter shade is the actual hair.</br>  What if Jack the hack uses accel synchro?  <br>Yugioh hair seldom works</br>  <br>So how much of a brocon would FemShun be to Male Ruri?</br>  <br>I want to have a cute daughter with him named  Ruri~ </br>  <br>Crow diddit<br>Nobody cared</br></br>  <br>I would that Michio<br>Food and titties<br>Perfect</br></br></br>  <br> There's an even more powerful kind of Fusion summoning! <br> Oh really? What's that? <br> THE ADVANCED FORM OF MASK CHANGE <br> How does it work? <br> Well it's basically a fusion summon but it only requires a single material <br> Oh that sounds like rank magi- <br> IT'S NOT RANK UP </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Basically Shun would be that kid with black hair and part of his bangs bleached.</br>  <br> female sawatari <br>I like it.</br></br>  <br>Ha,  that invisible kid that doesn't exist  looks exactly the same.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Accel Synchro Monsters actually have that written on their card in the anime "Accel Synchro" is their monster type instead of just "Synchro"<br><br>That difference doesn't exist in the OCG and Accel Synchro might not even exist at all in Arc-V.<br><br>Maybe we'll get more DOUBLE TUNING</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the new Red Dragon Archfiend monsters summons a Tuner from the Graveyard and the Deck, so there might be another one that requires two Tuners.</br>  <br><br>Cyborg =/= Android</br></br>  <br>Didn't it exist as part of the study board on LDS?

Does anyone know if this will cover the whole Washizu arc or just part of it like the anime did?  <br>The arc isn't done in the manga yet, but they might go into original content. They did spoil Ten's ending in the first episode.</br>  I was pretty surprised when I heard it, I didn't think that Akagi had the popularity with the Nips to warrant a live action adaptation.

Angle and pose is up to the artist.  When does the Waifu thread "end"? Tonight?  <br>Yeah, depending on who's been delivered it can end early tonight or early monday. Why do you ask?</br>  <br>Because these threads are practically dead until then and I like these threads.</br>  <br>Yeah the general is normally pretty cool. I would try to avoid it monday though, if there's drama from the WWD the day before its gonna be awful.

The fuck is an Oora?</br>  <br>Wow.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128632257 <br>Whether he was aware of it or not they weren't going to come in to save him from the shitposting.<br><br>Honestly I just wish they would keep their stuff to themselves, we could have more weekends like this is that was the case. <br><br>I saw someone mention they have something going in the IRC but they never involve their antics in the thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  Can I get a pregnant Tsugumi in a white dress having Raku's head on her lap listening to the baby  <br><br> no Immortan Joe and his Warboys collage </br></br>  <br><br> Immortan Jo Jo's Bizarre Adventure </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Fund it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You won't get hate unless you're a faggot though.</br>  <br>Maybe he was ban evading, but that still doesn't mean it was because of drawthread drama.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Why isn't this a thing? Take my money please.</br></br>  <br>This thing</br>  <br> tfw was witnessed this weekend by my small group of warboys <br>Feels good.</br></br>  <br> and anyone who knows anything knows mass delivery recipients are more victims than greedy cunts. <br>no, the only "victims" were the ones that acted like greedy cunts after the fact</br></br>    <br>Nice!

You just tell everyone what to do.</br>  <br><br>Which one do you want the most? If I am left to pick the character I'd much rather draw Misaki again. I like her design.</br></br>  <br>give me 1 reason not to do it on /h/ and /e/ instead of /a/?<br> b-but that means changing boards! </br></br>  <br>They're literally the rules. What's the point of the /h/ drawthreads if there's no requests there?</br>  <br>I've just picked my board and I'm sticking to it. I like cute lewd and non lewd requests just as well, I've just been reading smut all morning and it got me into picking lewd requests. For all the reasons to not do them here, I don't see reasons not to do them here. It's anime, we use external links for the nsfw content. Seems all perfectly fine.</br>  <br>the /h/ thread is so cozy also, no retarded waifu drama, kinda like an eternal weekend, a shame most of the drawfags still want to draw here for some reason</br>  <br>Not him, but I want him to do requests on /h/, /e/ and probably /u/, as well as here. Those boards need some activity too.</br>  <br>Oh right, got that mixed up... <br>Need to watch Boondocks again</br></br>  <br>Because people don't want to. Which is literally the only reason they need. Hell, if I REALLY wanted to request something pornographic, I would dump it in /e/, /h/ and here, because the smart thing to do.<br><br>There are plenty of drawfriends in these threads that like to draw lewds only sometimes that never look at /h/ or /e/, so you are just kicking yourself in the foot if you want something lewd and only use those two boards. Especially with how slow those threads are and how few drawfags they have.</br></br></br>  <br>Lewd requests are fine if the offensive content is posted elsewhere like /i/ and linked to the thread. <br>This isnt WWD, theres nothing wrong with lewd.</br></br>  <br> I'm too lazy to change boards <br>yeah fuck off. its literally changing 1 letter and you're there. request in the proper board.<br>if you want to request/draw lewds do it where it belongs, not on /a/. your reasons are pathetic and basically amount to you being too fucking lazy to change boards for your porn.<br><br>/a/ is a sfw board, /h/ and /e/ are designed for lewds. go to the correct board.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>B-but some people like to demean their lovely waifus.</br>  <br>They're slow because we have so many lewd enablers in SFW threads, dumbass.<br><br>The problems you're calling out are the product of drawfags accepting NSFW requests here.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry no. You fuck off. This bothers YOU. I don't give a shit. And you can't make me give a shit. So sit there being mad, because no one cares about your impotent rage.</br>  <br>Everytime I meet self righteousness on 4chan I ponder life and the universe. Albeit self righteousness is actually a very common thing here, it just seems extremely contradictory to what I expect of members of an anonymous image board. Are you going to be surprised when we shrug and say "nah?"</br>  this is pretty much what happened to /gif/ and why there are two separate boards now  <br> /a/ is a sfw board <br>Theres nothing against the rules in posting your lewd deliveries on /i/, and referring the OR check them out, though.</br></br>  <br>There isn't. Hes just angry people aren't taking his requests on /h/ or something.</br>  <br>This is the board for people who don't want lewd shit. YOU go to the correct board for YOUR interests. you don't come to /a/ to discuss cartoons and you don't come to /a/ to have porn.<br><br>you have to start somewhere, laying over and accepting everything just because of a few assholes means nothing gets done.<br><br> b-but rules don't say we can't! <br>there's better places, go to those places.<br>enabling lewd requesters means thats what we get, but there are boards for those requests if you want to do them. If I don't want to do lewd requests I don't have another board to go to.<br> b-but just ignore them! <br>you enabling them means the ratio of lewds gets skewed because you're doing them.<br>just go to /h/ if you want to draw lewd, you literally have no reason not to.<br><br><br> hurr he's just jealous <br>or I want actual fucking requests in the general rather than Lewd request #50 because dumbasses like you can't type /h/ instead of /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like anyone is going to read that post of yours.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dTA<wbr>AsCNK7RA</wbr>  [ ]  <br> I'm going to tell someone I didn't read his post, that'll show him! <br>you're an idiot aren't you?</br></br>  <br>Oh nice thank you kindly anon! Love how it looks.</br>  <br>The largest problem with your argument is that lewd requests don't inhibit regular requests. And whatever it is that we want to draw we will draw it regardless. And personally, I like having everything in one board so I don't have to browse multiple threads all the time. It's always only this thread or WWD. Concise, convenient, no one bats an eye. Am I lazy? Sure, not like being called lazy would ever bother me. Or virtually anyone.<br><br>I commend your effort but making me think about the subject actually convinced me I like things as they are and am now actively against dividing my lurking up across multiple boards (I only browse /a/ these days at all anyways)</br></br></br>  <br>Can't pick just one, haha<br>I think they're all good candidates, but how about Kanase if that's cool</br></br>  Requesting Stocking as a US Vietnam Soldier. Preferably the full loadout but just the helmet and rifle will do.  <br>Anyone?</br>  <br> making me think made me realize that I'm a lazy fuck who can't have 2 threads open <br>good for you.<br> doesn't inhibit regular requests <br>actually it does because people see it going on and decide its fine to request that instead. and regardless it speeds up the threads and clogs it with irrelevant requests even though there's a perfectly fine thread on /h/. its annoying having to go through 50 lewd requests to find 1 decent one, its better to have a slow thread than have one filled with stuff that doesn't belong.<br><br> i don't care about other people because I'm too lazy to open another thread <br>I love how you guys don't even try to hide that you're just pathetic idiots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure. Lets make people angry in color.</br>  <br>do tribal Tamamo-no-mae</br>  All this talk about NSFW requests got me thinking.<br><br>Requesting Crab doing Monkey doggy style, either with a strapon or futa dick, up to artist, with Monkey looking extremely happy and Crab having a very apathetic look on her face except maybe some slight redness.</br></br>  <br>I know, I'll insult everyone. That'll show them who's smart and who's right, and maybe motivate them to recognize they're making the wrong decision. Not subjectively, but objectively.<br><br>You should live by the motto of the WWD.<br> Don't you dare not take it easy </br></br></br></br>  <br>My last Tamamo was unfortunate. I'll consider but expect nothing.</br>  <br> objectively <br>because you have no ground to stand on, and you openly admit it as if it means something.<br>you refuse to go to the correct board because you're too lazy to click 2 buttons which literally takes 10 seconds.<br>Now tell me objectively why you request in /a/ instead of /h/.<br>oh wait, you can't. because there's absolutely no reason for it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This. I'm not going to go to /co/ to talk about /a/ and I'm not going to go to /x/ instead of /tv/ when I want to talk about a paranormal show. If you want to make /h/ posts then you go to /h/, that's the rules.</br>  <br>But who's the uke and who's the seme?</br>  <br> I like having everything in one board so I don't have to browse multiple threads all the time. It's always only this thread or WWD. Concise, convenient, no one bats an eye. <br><br><br>When you subdivide things over and over for organizations sake it becomes more hassle than worth. I don't like having many tabs open, it conflicts with some sense of minimalist organization standard in my head or perhaps a remnant of old habits from owning a pentium 4. Regardless, whether it's only an extra tab and an extra few clicks, it's still better by my perception to have it all in one, because then I don't have to pick a subject matter before browsing, I can just view both. The drawbacks are things you infer and think happen, but you don't have grounded logic to prove your meager points. I think your way of thinking is perfectly fine, it encourages a good sense of organization. But I don't care in the least. That's the end of it, that's my point, inarguable.<br><br><br>Lewd is still anime. Just the same as people requesting anime-style game characters here. Such as pokemon characters that never existed in the anime, or things like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea.</br>  <br> Posts of girls being fucked by animals and dripping with cum is still anime! <br>No, it's /h/.<br><br>And mods always get rid of anime styled game characters requested here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People get ripped apart for requesting any game character here, at least in my experience.<br><br>I've been on the receiving end of the hate, too.<br><br>If it's remotely anime you get ignored on /v/, if it's remotely a game you get ignored here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny you talk about /co/ and /a/ because where the two intersect, they are actually, by rule, allowed to discuss the same things, such as transformers or digimon. This steel curtain you want to put between each board doesn't exist like you think it does.</br>  <br> lewd is still anime <br>its a separate subset of anime which is not allowed on this board, therefore its not /a/.<br> 2 threads is a hassle <br>maybe you should get your intelligence checked instead of shitting all over this thread.<br>/h/ is a slow board, you request and can come back in a week and it'll still be there, you do not need the thread open 24/7 to get your porn.<br> b-but you have no proof! <br>I have proof it doesn't belong on this board.<br>but you're ignoring it because you're too lazy to open another thread. that's YOUR problem not mine. meaning YOU should be the one to leave.<br><br><br> allowed to discuss <br>only if they involve blatantly /a/ related things. such as goku vs superman, goku is anime so its related <br>you cannot however have a superman thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this steel curtain doesn't exist <br>Then why are anime styled video game threads deleted here? Why are threads about Avatar deleted here?</br></br>  <br>Why are threads about videogames that got anime adaptions not deleted here?<br><br>You are being pointlessly obtuse.<br><br>Why can I request Persona stuff in these threads and get deliveries?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that get anime adaptions <br> ANIME <br>jeeze I wonder.<br>but you'll notice if the thread is blatantly about the game it gets deleted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>None of these lewd requests are hentai that got anime adaptions, retard.</br>  I mean, when I get shit kicked by a mod, I'll stop. If you think whining will ever change our attitudes, continue to do so. I don't look at h here, that's incredibly uninteresting. I draw it, exclusively. And it's not easy to get off to your own art, when you've spend like 4 hours staring at it bit by bit before it looks like something that could be sexy. But maybe that's just me.<br><br>I must be fucking stupid because I don't care about organization on an anonymous image board. Fuck me right? I hope your shitty /h/ threads crawl to a halt and die because your attitude is so pitiable.</br></br>  <br>See <br><br>I made a Blazblue related request the other day, about a character which appears in the anime, I promptly got told (in a very unkind manner) to get out and go to /v/.<br><br>Not arguing in their favor, but there really are some strange situations where only certain franchises fall into place here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Right, they are anime. Good thing you realized that.</br>  <br>then draw on /h/ or /e/ if you want to draw porn.<br>literally 1 actual reason is all it'll take.<br>being lazy is not a reason, it you being a dumbass.<br>drawing on the correct board is beneficial to both you and the requesters and to /a/'s drawthreads, I do not see why you're too fucking stupid to realize this.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Blazblue <br> anime <br>Does not exist.  Joke aside, let me remove it from my memory, anon. </br></br></br>  <br> only if they involve blatantly /a/ related things. <br>/a/ has sadpanda threads, lewd manga discussion /a/ related.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, calling people stupid will really convince them to do what you want. Thats a good plan.</br>  <br>Yeah,  it was pretty god awful .<br>Sadly, my point stands though, and /v/'s been just as bad in regards to said request.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, maybe he should go spam the panda threads next. See how they react to his shit.</br>  <br>sadpanda is not inherently lewd and there are non-h doujins on there which would be /a/ related.<br>but regardless this is not the sadpanda thread<br> they do it so we can! <br>is not a good argument.<br><br>well clearly logic doesn't work with you idiots either otherwise we wouldn't be doing this in the first place. you have no valid reason for being here other than being too lazy to click 2 buttons taking less than 10 seconds, I just did it in 4 seconds.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one ever said I had an ounce of consideration for others. I gave my reason, I prefer things organized in such a manner that there are no boundaries between my subjects. I am not a skid who looks at 4chan on his work computer. Whether you're on /a/ or /h/ there will be borderline ecchi incriminating content, that is permitted by the literally defined rules but up to interpretation by people with different tastes and circumstances. I, am not one of them, I am at complete freedom with my browsing and subjects of interests and I draw both lewd and non lewd. This could not be simpler, if you want to define me liking everything in one place as lazy, that's nice. If you think laziness implies counterintelligence, that's also nice. I look forward to reading your doctrine on the inverse relationship between activity and intelligence.<br><br>I'm kidding you're just being bullheaded and moronic, even more so than I am typically which both impresses and annoys me. If this was an issue it would already be resolved. We circumvent it and behave how we want to. We know these threads get the most exposure and traffic so we flock here. I like seeing other artists. Could I always look here as well as other places? Yeah. I could also not, just because someone asks me to. Yeah, that sounds convenient and reasonable. I'll go with that. Wow that was a fucking stupid decision, I must be an idiot and lazy.</br></br></br>  <br>anime doing /h/ topics. <br><br>anime videogame posts and threads are deleted here, so should /h/ threads and posts. <br><br>And despite what you guys seem to think, the users on this board can stop lewd requests. Look at all the /a/ characters adapted from /v/ being told to fuck off.<br><br>Hell, /co/ was able to convince the mods to delete lewd requests from the drawthreads a lot of times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And you can stop posting entirely, but you don't. <br><br>I'm glad we all keep doing what we want here. Its very 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br> Thats a good plan. <br>it's the tumblr plan</br></br>  <br>I'm not breaking any rules, unlike lewd requesters.</br>  <br>Mods don't agree. If they did, those posts would be deleted and sad panda threads would be /h/ only. So, what can anyone say but you don't understand the rules.</br>  <br>I'm fairly certain a mod is more likely to clean this stupid debate from the thread than to remove the lewd requests getting filled. Without anyone goading them.</br>  Someone should request or deliver some NSFW stuff right now.  <br><br>Like I said, just because the mods don't understand the rules doesn't mean we can't get them to. /co/ did it and debates like these could very well do it.</br></br>  <br> I have no consideration for others <br>then your reasoning is not objective and you're still an idiot<br>Your reasoning is based on the fact you're too lazy to change boards to get what you want under the guise of "organization" even though that's the opposite of organizing things. <br><br>I love seeing how many paragraphs you can turn<br> I'm too lazy to switch boards <br>into<br><br><br><br>mods don't care about a lot of things until people start talking about it. I am bringing it up so it gets brought to the mods' attentions. <br>as the other anon said, if /co/ could do it so can we. it does not belong here and has no reason to be here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was there a time that the anon who requests Mai Natsume gets called off despite her debuting as a manga character?</br>  <br> The mods are wrong <br> I'm right </br></br>  <br> Doing this right now, which I should have done a week ago. </br>  <br>Ironically, that sentence is actually against the rules. You have now officially broken the rules you claim domain over.</br>  /r/ing a picture of Akane lifting her sweater/shirt up like this, but showing more leg and wearing underwear like this: http://i.imgur.com/tiXHz21.png preferably with a camel toe  <br>That sounds amazing.</br>  <br>the mods are usually content with ignoring shit until it generates enough problems that they need to react to it.<br>hell if we try hard enough we might get the WWD's mod in here and have him just ban everyone who talks.</br></br>  <br>But they are wrong, what's your point? Can a police officer do anything he wants just because he enforces the rules? Can he just let someone go for robbing a bank?<br><br>We've been having a mod in the WWD who bans anyone that calls shitposters out.</br></br></br>  <br> legs on this smug thug <br>hnng</br></br>  <br>I want smug lolis raping poor defenseless men.<br><br>Where our loli NSFW artists at?</br></br></br>  <br>Loli's with stomach bulge are my fetish.</br>  <br>Yes for literal semen demons</br>  <br> stomach bulge <br>That would work well with x-ray impregnation</br></br>  <br>Heikatsu was in the thread a while ago but i think he's gone.</br>  <br>Only really makes sense. You can't stick something big in a small body and have no bulge. Its just weird.<br><br><br>Pregnant lolis are too rare, even though they don't really make sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to draw some lewd lolis</br>  <br>Got some nice ideas.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Go for it. Hell, can combine them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I know that a lot of people are triggered by Sabo('s backstory), but you can't tell me that this right here isn't way worse writing.<br><br> hurr durr let me use Gear 4 which I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br> You're going all out? Hurr let me show you my "awakening" that no one used at marineford and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy </br></br></br>   I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.”  <br><br>Oda has clearly been a gardener for those parts of the story. So what's the problem?</br></br>  Wait a minute, that design on Sanji's cloak...  <br> hurr durr let me use Gear 4 which I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br><br>You don't start fighting with nuclear bombs m8. Conventional arms first.</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  I dont think Doffy being OP is bad writing<br><br>He's supposed to be bullshit<br><br> because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy <br>it's like you don't know Doffy's personality at all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I stopped caring too much about OP after the timeskip. Oda only disappoints now.</br>  <br>no<br><br>there's a sun on his cloak because they're in a desert</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded, neither Luffy nor Doffy had any reason to use their strongest attacks prior to these situations. Hody was fodder, so was Caesar. Why use Gear 4th against such weaklings when you know you will be fucked for 10 minutes after using it? It clearly is an attack that is meant to be used as a last resort. And Doffy already used his awakened ability before officially talking about awakened abilities you dumbass mach 20 speedreading faggot.</br>  <br>He is both, the main plot (the 4th level of writing as One Piece podcast put it, above sagas) is clearly the work of an architect, sagas too, but everything inside them is the work of a gardener.</br>  <br>nice minority opinion<br>but I bet you are still reading every new chapter instead of dropping the manga like a sane person should, right?</br></br>  <br> I know that a lot of people are triggered by Sabo('s backstory) <br>I don't usually frequent One Piece threads. Why exactly did people find it triggering?</br></br>  <br>If Luffy's so streched to use it as a last resort, what the fuck he'll do against bigger opponents of NW? Doffy was just the appetizer and Strawhats hardly won against him.</br>  <br> and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy <br>You didn't understand what was going on at all, did you ?<br>Doffy can't help but have lingering affection for Law, he wasn't going to kill him.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabofags delusioned themselves with their own head canon so when Oda didn't do the same thing they got mad. So basically they are just butthurt.</br>  <br><br>He'll probably have more last resorts which fuck him up even more.</br></br>  <br>because their "m-muh secret mission" fanfictions did not come true</br>  <br> Are you retarded, neither Luffy nor Doffy had any reason to use their strongest attacks prior to these situations. <br> law gets shot infront of you <br> Whole country gets captured by a birdcage and people are in actual danger <br> meanwhile the rest of your crew is facing big mom all alone <br> let me try to fight doffy as he was hody, I might win that way <br>Are you retarded? There were enough situations at dressrosa forcing luffy to use gear 4, but he just ignored it and didn't on the other hand doffy did not use his awakening as his main force and instead played with his enemys while losing one subordinate after the other. That's shit-writing right there, but you keep deepthroughing oda's dick.<br><br><br>We really shouldn't bring those sabo discussions in here.<br><br><br>Affection didn't stop him from killing his own brother who didn't damage him nearly as much as law</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There were enough situations at dressrosa forcing luffy to use gear 4 <br>Not really, if you have a strong attack with such a huge backlash of fucking course you will try to avoid using it as long as possible. Are you not able to form coherent thoughts?</br></br>  <br>And yet Doffy didn't kill Law while Luffy was busy recovering from a previous attack, even though he was weak and defenseless and all he had to do was stretch his arm.<br>Don't you think it's likely that he didn't want to kill someone dear to him again ? <br>Well sure it is but interpretation, but I think it's rather obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize you are complaining about typical battle shounen tropes do you? Pro Tip: Stop reading this type of manga.</br>  <br> , if you have a strong attack with such a huge backlash of fucking course you will try to avoid using it as long as possible. <br>Nope you're just delusive. There was no need to fight doffy for this long, when the danger was as big as it was and luffy could use gear 4 willingly. When Luffy was facing Trebol and doffy with law, it was the last moment that would hav emade sense to use Gear 4, but instead they fucked around until trebol off'd himself further supporting that shit writing.<br><br><br> And yet Doffy didn't kill Law while Luffy was busy recovering from a previous attack, even though he was weak and defenseless and all he had to do was stretch his arm. <br>He was clearly focusing to kill the bigger danger of those two first, which was luffy and his potebtial second usage of gear 4.<br><br><br>Nope, if you want it or not, One piece is the best WSJ series atm and I enjoyed, but that's exactly why I have so much hope for it to be good. Saying<br> hurr it's a shonen <br>Is basically evading a discussion, because you have no real argument left.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was clearly focusing to kill the bigger danger of those two first, which was luffy and his potebtial second usage of gear 4 <br>Well yeah that too, It's not like both these opinions are mutually exclusive.</br></br>  <br>It was precisely because Trebol was still there that he did not use it. What if he would have managaged to defeat Doffy (which would certainly would have been impossible since even with the damage Law inflicted on him he still survived the Gear 4 assault) but then would be helpless due to the backlash and get fucked by the still standing Trebol. What you don't seem to understand is that Luffy has to exclude all contingencies before using Gear 4th. The perfect time was when he was 1vs1 against Doffy without any other interferences and Doffy being badly wounded by Law on top of it.</br>  <br> Is basically evading a discussion, because you have no real argument left. <br>Literally what? One Piece being the best WSJ series or not has nothing to do with it being full of typical shounen tropes or not. If you really are denying that you are deluded beyond belief.</br></br>  <br> Doffy can't help but have lingering affection for Law, he wasn't going to kill him. <br><br> And yet Doffy didn't kill Law while Luffy was busy recovering from a previous attack <br>Did you miss Doffy asking Law like 3 times to perform the immortality operation on him, something Law has to be alive to do? He didn't murder the guy straight away because the power to bestow immortality was right in front of him and he was seeing if he could bribe Law somehow. Lingering affection didn't stop him from asking the guy to suicide for him multiple times.<br>Like how he probably liked Monet but didn't hesitate to ask her to sacrifice herself for a greater purpose.<br><br>One of Doffy's first fucking lines after the timeskip is "Hey Vergo, murder Law as brutally as possible for me and bring me a souvenir", he just wasn't aware that Law's current power level would allow him to manhandle Vergo.<br><br>13 years ago literally the first thing he did when he learned Law ate the fruit was say "Lel guess I'll have to brainwash that kid into dying for me."<br><br>Even if I give you your point that Doffy has some feelings deep down in his satanic heart, that didn't stop him from murdering his brother or asking his main squeeze to die. Extending this to the top executives, who are aware of Doffy's true nature and way of doing things, Pica was immediately ready to kill Baby after she jumped ship. Doffy explicitly says to Viola that he doesn't forgive traitors, and Law falls into that category. Waterloo's status as secondary shounen protagonist in a series where 2 non-flashback characters have died in 18 years/Doffy's desire for muh immortality protected him.<br><br> I think it's rather obvious <br>The only thing obvious here is that you're a Doffy apologist</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br>Awakening was mentioned before and hinted many times.<br>Also what asspull? Doflamingo got rekt. It's called foreshadowing.</br></br></br></br>  So Drum Kingdom is going to be independent of the WG, right?  <br>Then Luffy could have easily made Law fuck off with trebol, that isn't really the issue.<br><br><br>I did not deny that, you have no reading comprehension. I expressed that I expect more from it that other series especially because it is the best WSJ series. That does not mean that it has no shounen tropes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying those are not also a foreshadow to Smile </br>  <br> Lingering affection didn't stop him from asking the guy to suicide for him multiple times <br> Like how he probably liked Monet but didn't hesitate to ask her to sacrifice herself for a greater purpose <br>So ? That's the way that guy works. Don't judge him with your own morals, you'll miss the subtleties of his character.<br> The only thing obvious here is that you're a Doffy apologist <br>There it is, the OP thread Godwin law. No point in discussing with you any further.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;hurr durr let me use Gear 4 which I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br> Implying you shoul use lightly something that makes you unable to move for a lot. <br><br>Nice bait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, I suddenly think Chopper can be considered an awakened Zoan. At least pre-TS, he could 'Awaken' with the Rumble Ball but he can do that naturally post-TS although Monster Point still requires a Ball. Then again, maybe MP is Chopper's Awakened form?</br>  Strawhats partake in the world's hottest chili challenge. How will each member fare?  <br> Awakening was mentioned before and hinted many times. <br>Awakened Zoans were, nothing else. That's clearly a difference. It was suggetsed back than that zoans got the awakened ability to balance (with the paracemia/logia) them more and allowing others to transform like Chopper. All of that was fucked by Doffy. Weird that Rayleigh didn't tell luffy about it and that it was in no form mentioned nor *directly* used at the war of the best.<br><br><br>You would if that stops the problem/situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then Luffy could have easily made Law fuck off with trebol, that isn't really the issue. <br>Holy shit how hardheaded can you be? Fuck off, I really don't care anymore.</br></br>  <br>Zoan and Paramecia are different things. <br>What should an Awakened Zoan do? Morph people and things into animals?<br>The whole point of Zoan is that the user increases his physical abilities. An awakened Zoan simply does it more (like Chopper with RB).</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? Law power basically allows him to take any retard away. Just radio knife trebol's little ass and then teleport to some of your nakamas to fuck him up.</br>  <br>  It was suggetsed back than <br>Where? In the manga? Not really.</br></br>  <br> You would if that stops the problem/situation. <br>That's not the safest tactic. <br>You try with all your strenght in base form before using a transformation with a very high cost.<br><br>Also why are we discussing this? Luffy made a mistake using Gear 4 so soon. If Law+guys didn't help him he was going to lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No I meant in the discussions, of course not in the manga. <br><br><br> Also why are we discussing this? Luffy made a mistake using Gear 4 so soon. If Law+guys didn't help him he was going to lose. <br>because luffy can't see the future. How would he knew that he would lose when he uses Gear 4 too soon? It was best technique, so there shouldn't have been anything holding him back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, MP is probably awakened. Other forms are just more control over partial transformations.</br>  Are the things Kuma shoots compressed air or energy balls?  <br>then why are you here faggot</br>  <br><br>Compressed air.</br></br>  <br>As I thought, thanks.</br>    <br><br> Implying ground secco was removing water from ROCKS <br>That was fucking awakening 10 years ago.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Ursus Shock certainly is.<br><br>The Pad Ho on the other hand is him pushing the air, so it is similar to compressed air in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro, Luffy and Brook would go on until they pass out at the same time.</br>  <br>But I saw these things go through people without making holes in them, how can air do that?</br>  <br><br>Ask Oda.</br></br>  <br>I believe Kuma just made shockwaves by repelling air. That's why it can pass through stuff and leave a mark.</br>  <br><br>Its basicly sound. Compressed airwaves. Except he only sends out one and not a wave. And guess what strong airwaves can do? <br><br>Loss of hearing is just the start, you can get eye damage, and internal bleeding, to straight up destroyed internal organs.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The more information we get about Crocodile the more it becomes clear he was a fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>Zoro wins by far, he just has too much endurance. Or Sanji because he is a cook so might be sued to it.</br>  <br>Sanji got wrecked by some cyan "flavouring" though.  It was spoiled </br>  <br><br>Implying Brook wouldn't eat himself dead.<br><br> If he already were not dead YOHOHOHO </br></br></br></br>  <br>It might be a tie. Spicy food is Sanjis favorite at least.</br>  <br><br>That's has sense, thanks.<br><br> Kuma too OP please nerf </br></br></br></br>  <br>Awaken but shitter than Luffy with no Gears.</br>  <br>Even Ace was probably weaker then Luffy now.<br>Having a logia makes you skip haki and body training sometimes.<br><br>Crocodile relied too much on his pseudo-invulnerability</br></br></br></br>  <br>Him being completely brain dead might be the nerf.</br>  <br>And Marine arc Crocodile can draw with Doffy.</br>  <br>Or maybe he is even stronger due to being merciless.</br>  <br><br>That's due to him relying on his fruit too much - Pekoms summed it up perfectly.</br></br>  <br>Doffy wasn't taking him seriously. Was just playing the whole war giving no crap.</br>  <br>And Doffy can't finished Moria if he use awaken it's easy to beat all</br>  <br>dude what?</br>  <br>Invisible guy saved Moria, you moron. And probably Doffy made him go for the lol of it.</br>  <br>Why Crocodile didn't used his awaken to break that prison?</br>  <br>fucking agalmatolite prison shit.<br>do you even read the manga?</br></br>  <br><br> b8 <br><br>Sea-stone shackles...</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was known as merciless and Tyrant before.</br>  Would you anons get mad if Kid alliance actually win against Shanks ?  No OP, this was by far the most retard thing to came out of Dressora. <br><br>God just thinking about her retardness make me angry.</br></br>  <br>But he actually had a kind heart, like a teddy bear.</br>  <br>only if they kill him</br>  <br>fuck off she is cute and has nice tits</br>  <br> Sea stone <br>Hmm</br></br>  While I'm in a One Piece thread, what do you think is the likelihood of Aoikiji being a member of the Blackbeard pirates now? Because I'm starting to see this come up here and there and I'm worried if I missed something with this plot  <br> Shanks gets shanked off-panel <br><br>Blood would flow</br></br></br>  <br><br>He had the shackles taken off him at that point.</br></br>  <br> yfw Sabo was out of nowhere involved in shanks killing and he didn't knew that Luffy and Shanks are friends <br>I think /a/ would break on that day</br></br>  <br><br>I get the point, but why would Sabo be involved though?</br></br>  <br>She was annoying as fuck. Literally spent the whole arc being a useless bitch and crying for men to save her ass. Definitely one of the most poorly written characters Oda made yet.</br>  <br>Fucking read the whole arc before saying bullshit.</br>  <br>Just belive. Goda finds his way.</br>    <br>nice quads</br>  <br>Shineh</br>  <br> Shineh <br><br>Yeah that Screenshot does look a bit too bright.</br></br></br>  <br>It's only been hinted to so far. It hasn't been confirmed yet whether he's a full fledged member or merely an ally to them.</br>  The one piece world itself is created by an awakened power.  What are the odds that any of the other supernovas are gonna get as much time and attention given to their backstory as Law?  <br>both the bitches look fine.</br>  <br>Kidd is basically a certainty at this point.<br>Drake and Bonney are also fairly likely.</br></br>  <br>They won't get as much attention, though some of them will certainly get a lot of time too. But Law is the first and Luffy's favorite ally, so he gets special treatment.</br>  How come the WG never conquered or at least destroyed Fishmen Island? With that place gone, the number of pirates swarming to the New World would have dropped drastically.  <br>I'm sure well learn about all of them at some point.<br><br>Law will always be Odas favourite though</br></br></br>  <br> One of the Yonko defending FI <br> Let's attack guys! We did so well against Whitebeard, what's the worst that could happen? </br></br>  Enel awakened when  <br>Ussop wins as he's built up a minor tolerance to spicing things accidentally dosing himself while building spicy ammunition.</br>  <br>A lot of Paradise pirates get weakened and weeded out in the New World. they lose their dreams and beg to go back to their families. The New World is actually quite bad for Pirates. You can't just waltz in and expect to be fine.</br>  <br>This and the dwarves... What the fuck was he thinking? No wonder he takes every-other week off...</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the straw hat pirates did</br>  <br>Usopp can handle it but he can't keep going. He simple does not have as much will as Zoro.</br>  <br>I don't really care, I'm not expecting masterful writing from one piece. I'm just expecting something enjoyable. Although I really love how gear 4 is super Japanese theater.</br>  <br>Gee, I fucking wonder why.</br>  Nami would win<br>If money was involved <br>Also I swear she abandons her draw a map of the world dream right after Robin joins to care more about money<br>Or at least it's never mentioned again</br></br></br>  <br>They did after separating, training and preparing for 2 years.</br>  <br><br>Because they got 2 years of training.<br><br>They wouldn't have even made it there if not for Kuma.</br></br></br></br>  <br> im pretty sure the straw hat pirates did <br><br>u have to be trolling, please dont be that retarded.<br><br>the only reason they had it easy is because they prepared extra hard, they didnt just waltz in, they literally took a 2 year break just to prepare</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy's gonna learn awakened abilities, isn't that obvious? Why else would Doflamingo name that shit.</br>  I hope we get useful Sanji back again sometime.  <br><br>Can't wait for Gomu Gomu: Bouncy Castle<br><br> opponents can't do shit because they are bouncing everywhere <br> Luffy's attacks are intensified, Gear 4th is ridiculously stronger </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ... <br>get out</br></br>  <br> What the fuck was he thinking? <br>That you will see after the next 200 chapters or so</br></br>  Why is Garp so based ?  <br>I really don't get the power levels in One Piece anymore.<br><br> garp the hero <br> apparently fought equally with the pirate king roger <br> denied the admiral seat promotions <br> gets one shotted by pre ts luffy <br><br>Oda what the fuck?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> someone will fall for this </br></br>  <br> one-shot <br>He jobbed on purpose, anon.</br></br>  <br>Nanda korea?<br><br><br> jobbed on purpose <br>There's literally no proof or hint of that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He sure bled a lot for a pre-timeskip Luffy punch.<br>With the power scaling now, that attack would just tickle Doflamingo.</br></br>  <br><br>kekked.</br></br>  The amount of baiters. Over Garp, of all people. What happened ?  <br> "Haa.. Hold me back just like that, Sengoku" <br>LEWD.</br></br>  <br>That's because Garp ate the blood blood fruit and now he's a blood man.</br>  <br> Garp <br> Not Zoro </br></br>  <br> implying Zoro's not the Devil Fruit in human form </br>  <br> There's literally no proof or hint of that. <br><br>Look at his faces before taking Luffy's punch. He is clearly hesitating because he still cared about Luffy and Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> falling for it <br>What are you doing ?</br></br>  <br>What you interpret on the situation doesn't matter.<br><br>Look at the image posted by this post <br><br>That's like saying Luffy closed his eyes before he punched Garp because he didn't want to punch him.<br><br>Its all speculation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 5000x5000 </br>  <br>Nah he's the MM fruit in human form making him a masochist man.</br>  <br><br>Is there an issue?</br></br>  <br> falseflagging this hard to stir up shit <br><br>You can keep raiding but it will never work.</br></br></br>  Which one, /a/?  <br>Nothing, OP himself was the one doing it. He is an autist from outside who thinks he needs to shitpost to "keep the thread" alive which is just an excuse to ask a mod to ban the threads really, which will never work.</br>  <br>Obviously both.</br>  <br>Both and Tashigi and Bonney and human Monet and the others I forgot about.</br>  <br> that robin <br><br>I've never wanted to love an indian in my life as hard as I do now.<br><br>But If I have one choice the obvious choice would be the one in her prime Nami.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not both. </br>  Alright, speculation time. <br><br>I think Crocodile used to be in Whitebeard's crew. He was the 2nd Division Captain before Ace. He probably realised that he wanted to become Pirate King himself instead of supporting Whitebeard and decided to fight him. And lost badly. He might have been left on his own like Usopp was after the fight. He might have been rescued by Ivankov, who gave him the same treatment as Sanji, with the cross dressing and what not.</br></br>  Look long and hard at this jobber.<br><br>Do you think he made a crew of his own<br>Or is he sucking another old man's dick?</br></br></br>  <br>He's supporting the survivors of WB's crew. He's not fit to a captain.</br>  <br><br> caring about writing and annoyance on delicious tits <br> getting mad about it <br><br>Either literal underaged faggot or literal landwhale cunt. Hard to tell, their opinions and anger are often similar.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They want to get fucked hard by Rebeccafag's delicious sadisitic wordings.</br>  Has BB awakened his fruit and that's why he has his special body that can hold more fruits and even absorb devil fruit powers and such? Or are those really just base abilities of the yami yami no mi?  <br> supporting the survivors of WB's crew <br><br>Anon didn't we tell you not to trust strangers? Who told you this?</br></br></br>  <br>Robin with all my lovin'</br>  <br>I think is a chance thing, most people die with a second fruit but some survive. Blackbeard is one of the chosen ones.</br>  <br>He can eat more than one fruit because of his "weird body", not because of the yami yami.<br>He just ate the gura gura after the death of WB because it respawned in an empty fruit of the same kind he was carrying with him.</br></br>  <br>I thought he had another fruit that allowed him to have more than one fruit. Like the Chimera Chimera no Mi or some shit giving him two more fruit spaces.</br>  <br><br> inb4 D's can have 2 fruits </br></br>  <br> Luffy gets a second devil fruit <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe is D. related thing but maybe not.</br></br>  <br>I'd hope it isn't. Likely a unique effect due to his weird body.</br>  <br>It was just my opinion. I don't think he'll ever be relevant again. He's probably gonna job/support.</br>  <br> Awakened Zoans were, nothing else.  <br>Please God, tell me this is bait. You can't be that dumb.<br>Why is everyone saying we don't see these awakening powers in marineford or anyone else talking about it? Why does everyone rule out the possibility that skill is evolving, much like actually life would. Something hard today would be impossible years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy gets another devil fruit <br> It's just another Gomu Gomu no Mi fruit so now he's a rubber man x 2 </br></br>  Huh, never noticed before but someone actually managed to give Doffy a scratch during the war.  <br><br> he gets Bellamy's fruit or some shit <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  Are really all awakenings going to be about turning the environment into your DF power instead of yourself? Because there are a shitload of fruits that wouldn't work with it at all  <br>Not to mention Gear 4 is limited and drains nearly all his Haki.</br>  <br><br>Anons, please. Obvoiusly Sabo dies protecting him and he gets the mera mera no mi.</br></br>  <br>No he just gets an artificially manufactured version of the Gomu Gomu no Mi created using SAD.</br>  <br><br><br>Dropped harder.</br></br></br>  <br>The Impel Down guards already shot down your speculation.</br>  <br>What? Oda even foreshadowed that with Red Hawk. Come on. That's cool. A rubber fire man? He kills Akainu in the same way Akainu killed Ace. This could be great.</br>  Is this the biggest asspull thus far?<br><br>What will Oda pull out of his ass next?</br></br>  <br><br>Nah I'm done with it if he does that.</br></br>  <br>Gear Fifth.</br>  <br> One Piece <br> asspulls <br><br>Shitposting is a bannable offense</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Guards at ID were Zoans. All Zoans are essentially the same. Paramecia's are vastly different. If anything, the guards at ID support his speculation since all the awakened Zoans were similar. <br><br>I don't think all awakenings would be the same for Paramecia's though. Some would be but not all.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah not really, with all the samurai's and Japanese imagery going on since Punk Hazard, Luffy turning into a noh theater guy isn't that out there. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if he as just lying about whatever and just came up with this while talking to Kinomon.</br>  <br> Why is everyone saying we don't see these awakening powers in marineford or anyone else talking about it? Why does everyone rule out the possibility that skill is evolving, much like actually life would. <br>Are you retarded? Are implying taht doffy awakened during the two years timeskip? Are you really this dense?</br></br>  <br>Nah man<br> Luffy beats Akainu <br> Akainu dies and the Magu Magu no Mi respawns <br> Luffy eats it and becomes a molten rubber man <br> Inherits Akainu's will and uses his new abilities to beat the living shit out the most pirate-y guy in the series, Blackbeard <br>It's like poetry</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you think gear fifth will be?<br><br><br> that pic <br>You calling me an idiot sandwhich?</br></br></br></br></br>  Some anon wanted to know how Law's submarine could cross the Calm Belt a few threads ago. If that guy's around, this should answer it.  <br>5 = 2 + 3</br>  <br>I think it's both. The Yami Yami ability to absorb anything allows him to absorb other fruits' powers without actually eating it. That's why he avoids death.<br><br><br><br>the "wierd body" thing is just a supposition my by other caracters. I think it's because he can naturally absorb other people's powers thanks to the Yami Yami.<br><br>also, i don't really think he has all that control over the new gained powers. As far as we could see at Marineford, the Gura Gura powers were unstable at best.<br><br>Also, it gave me the idea that his new power was significantly weaker than Whitebeard's. He could barely stand up to Sengoku and completely avoided Shanks where Whitebeard proved more than capable to take both head on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it must be nice, being like the empress's slave... <br><br>Who is the sidecharacter that put out that speech bubble?<br>He deserves an apple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't exist nothing will be stronger than Gear 4th.<br><br><br>Why are you calling yourself an idiot sandwhich?<br>Don't be a victim to that pink flamingo's bullying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Two same-sided swirly cues <br><br>And people wondered what was under Sanji's flap, it was already there.</br></br></br>  <br> yes </br>  <br>Penguin</br>  <br>the answer is obvious<br>not that I would not a Nami like a mad dog in heat but Robin is just superior</br></br>  <br>You so stupid.</br>  <br>OOOoohhh. Yeah that makes sense to me. He held the right kind of fruit there to absorb the power after he died. Then instead of eating that fruit, used the yami yami pwoers on the fruit. <br><br>As for his control over it, I think I get it. He and Whitebeard were not close. They hated each other. But then, look at Ace and Sabo, brothers who loved each other, and Sabo is pulling off amazing mera mera attacks right away. I think maybe that has something to do with it. Like the previous users spirit gets locked in there or something maybe. Could just be an issue of training I guess. Sabo is a pretty well-trained guy and BB seems to rely on his crew and abilities a bit more.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's jsut supposition by other characters. Marco said that the Whitebeards should all know about Teach's body. Considering that Teach spent 20 years with them, it's completely possible that the WB would know something about Teach that we don't. <br><br>And Teach literally used the Gura Gura after 30 seconds of getting it. Of course it would be unstable. Every character who had recently eaten a DF found the powers to be a bit unstable. Teach is no different. <br><br>Teach doesn't fight battles where victory isn't certain. Fighting Shank's crew with his unstable fruit and tiny crew would have been suicide. Especially if the Marines sided with Shanks, since he's the lesser 'Evil'.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't support anything. The ID guards, if anything, suggest that the entire Zoan class won't have powers related to the environment.<br><br> Paramecia's are vastly different <br><br>By your own logic wouldn't Paramecia's have vastly different Awakenings then? Doflamingo knowing that every Awakened DF has powers like his is as retarded Pell somehow knowing the entire world only has 5 flying DF users. I believe people misinterpreted Doffy's statement, which I understood as Doffy only suggesting a possibility of Awakened powers -- to change their environment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you even fucking read my post ? I literally said ''I don't think all awakenings would be the same for Paramecia's''<br><br>Don't just read the first two sentences and reply Anon. Read the entire damn thing.<br><br>Also Pell said that only 5 were discovered. Which is reasonable since there's a fucking whole book about Devil Fruits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gomu Gomu no Mi awakened <br> Turns your body back to normal <br> Nobody said it would enhance your abilities <br> You're shit out of luck son </br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I just realized this Den Den Mushis swirls mach Sanjis </br>  Anyone have that kinda lewd Hancoku image made by so-ru or whatever her name is.  <br>Luffy and Doffy pulling a Frieza is just typical Battle Shounen writing; it's horrendous by professional writing standards, but it's what the primary demographic wants and it's at least exciting<br><br>Sabo's backstory was Oda trying to fill in the plotholes created by his existence in the story.</br></br></br>  <br> That's a stretch </br>  <br>both</br>  <br> a technique gets revealed after the protagonist trained for 2 years <br> asspull <br>I know this is bait but there are actually people who truly believe this</br></br></br>  <br>Of course both and at the same time</br>  <br> Also Pell said that only 5 were discovered. Which is reasonable since there's a fucking whole book about Devil Fruits. <br><br>Seems more reasonable. Nobody probably ever went to Green Bit and saw the flying Bug Zoans there.<br><br>Still, I don't expect for Oda to ever clarify such a retarded statement. This was back in the days when Oda planned then end of Alabasta to be 50% of the entire manga, far from the length it has reached now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo dies <br> Luffy gets the Mera Mera <br> Luffy activates Gear 5,   Burning Rubber </br></br></br>  <br>I don't but have this one in the mean time</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Boa Hancock is a pedo</br></br>  <br>That doesn't cut it out for me man.<br>Her tits are like too huge here.<br><br>So-ru's Hancocku and me have like a special connection you know what I mean?<br>You wouldn't understand.<br><br><br>Daily reminder than Hancocku is sexy as fuck and waifu material.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>still a pedo</br>  <br>Even better.</br>  <br>Still sexy as fuck and waifu material.</br>   A bowl of salad counts as a bowl of soup, according to CAPTCHA   <br><br><br> 17  <br> pedo <br><br>U wot m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people are too stupid to tell the difference.</br>  <br>How is it retarded though ? As far as Pell, a random fucking character in a random fucking Island, is concerned there were only 5 flying DFs that were discovered. Which means, at that point in time, Vegapunk only identified 5 flying fruits. Obviously the number isn't exact and Oda made sure he left room for expansion.</br>  <br> A 29 years old woman <br> Falls in love with a 17 years old boy <br><br>pedo</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is really mature for his age though</br>  <br> 29 years old woman <br> pussy probably deeper than the elaware queduct <br> finds stretchy dumb kid <br> strechy dumb kid easily satisfied <br><br>She too smart for you anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to cuck Hancock with Luffy</br>  <br> I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br><br>he didn't use it before because of the strong drawback that forbids him from fighting for 10 other minutes<br><br> Hurr let me show you my "awakening" that no one used at marineford and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy <br><br>a lot of people use it in Marineford, you just didn't see it<br>he didn't need it against Law, he wrecked him without</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Elaborate - 17 isn't illegal.</br></br>  It was "identified" fruits. It wasn't "this many fruits exist because reasons". There are likely plenty more.  <br>It is in my country</br>    <br>Exactly. It's "Only 5 are known". Not "Only 5" as people seem to think. Places like Green Bit and Wano are gonna have fruits that Vegapunk probably doesn't know about.</br>  <br>of course he's awakened<br>I just hope we'll see other zoans with more than 3 forms<br>especially against Kaidou<br>the opposite would be pretty bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>American child please go</br>  <br>good, that means we have something in common</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>No matter.<br><br>12 years of difference is to be considered a pedo, even if they both are over their 30s.<br><br>It's also disgusting</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this fucking doujin <br><br>muh diiiick</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you European fags still awake?<br><br>Go to sleep you dopers.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would Vegapunk be the one spreading this information to 'a random fucking character in a random fucking Island'? He is one of the World Government's most precious assets, leaking his knowledge to pirates around the world would be a huge problem. Franky could only learn from Vegapunk by going to homeland and looking at his prototypes when he was young, everything else is still a huge mystery. Does Vegapunk leave his lab at all? Him cataloging DFs around the world doesn't sound right to me.<br><br>BB's booklet could simply be assembled by the underground network where Doflamingo worked his trade.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 12 years of difference is enough to be considered a pedo <br><br>I think you need to look up the legal definition of a pedo. <br><br>It depends on the age of consent, not the age gap.<br><br>So it some countries, it may be 17, but for most it isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ace was marineford luffy tier</br>  <br><br>She's a cougar, not a pedo you dingus.</br></br>  <br> She's a cougar <br><br>I'm trying to pounce on dat pussy naw wadda mean playa?</br></br></br>  <br>not the entire world but red line was created by a DF obeying the tenryuubitos<br>reminder that the red line is a conglomerate of islands<br>islands that will go back to their original state once the SH reach raftel<br>also creating the all blue (one and only sea)</br></br></br></br>  <br> says Whitebeard Pirates <br> Crocodile chilling there as well. <br>Yeah I can see where you're coming from.</br></br></br>  <br>Vegapunk didn't go to Arabasta and tell Pell about it over tea, you dingus. Why does everyone forget the book about DFs ? Vegapunk might be with the Marines but he still let Kuma protect the Strawhat Ship for 2 years. The DF book was probably screened by the WG and they probably didn't think of it's ramifications. Even Sanji has read the book at one point. It's not something special. Arabasta had a huge library at the palace. The King could have asked someone for it.</br>  <br>the dwarves were kinda forced to appear since he foreshadowed them a long time ago with norland<br>but I agree they brought only confusion to this arc and were not funny or useful</br></br>  <br> Crocodile was there <br> the whole time <br><br>WADDA FUCK?!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Oars the Continent Puller destroys the Red Line <br>So hyped for late game OP<br><br><br>Yea, that was the only thing that made me think he used to be a Division Leader. He looks like he belonged there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Robin seems to have had the chillest timeskip<br>sure she got into custody at first but she soon got fred by the revolutionaries<br>and then did... nothing???<br><br>or is there a lot of misteries we don't know about?<br>I wish there is</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She probably did a lot of shit with the Revs.<br><br> inb4 she helped uprisings we haven't heard about yet </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh she helped with some uprisings alright.<br><br> NAW WADDA MEAN PLAYA?</br></br></br>  <br> yfw a lot of people actually believe this <br>reminder that people thought that Law was able to teleport</br></br>  <br>didn't she meet Dragon offpanel? I remember something about that</br>  <br><br>Sure he switch places with objects, but it is pretty much teleportation - he gets to somewhere instantly.</br></br>  <br>nami is an insufferable slut<br>robin all day every day<br>then bonney</br></br></br>  Tashigi a best.  <br>No, she just sat and drank coffee for 2 fucking years.</br>  <br>they obviously had some kinda past since croco was full tsndere for shirohige<br>but part of his crew... I think we would have a hint at that if it were the case<br><br><br>wasn't it said that he was somehow the new captain of shirohige's crew</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think is a chance thing <br><br>it would be completely stupid to think it has no connection with his flag</br></br></br>  Who is the best One Piece Character and why is it pic related?  <br>thankfully you're no writer<br>at least I hope</br></br>  <br>Cerberus fags please go</br>  <br> I don't think all awakenings would be the same for Paramecia's though <br><br>there's no need to overthink that anyway since only very few DF users will be able to awaken their power and we'll only see a handful of awakened paramecia<br>Oda will just show us awakened paramecia that can actually make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br> Best character <br> Dead </br></br>  <br>That's not a very convincing argument. There is no reason why Vegapunk was has to be one behind that illustrated DF book. Any scholar can put together bits and pieces information and illustrate that incomplete book.<br><br>Oda has hinted that Vegapunk knows far more about DFs than the rest of the world, so the idea that the WG 'probably didn't think of its ramifications' sounds like massive incompetence in their part. If they were really threatened, the book would have banned and burned around the world.</br></br></br>  <br>I like this one better </br>  <br>Alright then, some no name fucker published the book. Same damn result.</br>  <br>I really hope Oda doesn't add much gears<br>gear 2 was kinda mandatory since luffy needed a technique to keep on with enemies' speed<br>I hated gear 3 but thankfully we won't have to see it a lot anymore<br>I hate gear 4 design but it feels like with it he can actually hurt anyone with his king kong punch, even yonkous<br>and eventually he'll learn to reduce the drawbacks just like he did with the other gears</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MANliest apple!!!!</br>  <br>doffy's eyes for you son</br>  <br>Also, what kind of a fall would that be?<br> Division Captain in the crew of the strongest man alive <br> Get's beaten by a kid with 30m bounty </br></br></br>  <br>MEN!</br>  <br>Shut up you feathery faggot</br>  <br>There could be something about this theory.<br>Oda doesn't draw shit with without a reason. <br>Why would he include Croc if Akainu was adressing the WB pirates?</br></br></br>  who was whitebeard's greatest ally and why was it her? <br>hope we see her again some day</br>  <br> that mustache <br><br>I think that 'she' is a 'he' dude.</br></br></br>  <br>probably but we have no hint in her doing anything useful<br>but she's so introverted anyway...<br><br><br>it's teleportation but only in a limited area<br><br><br>not even talking about the cerberus theory<br>but he must be able to have 3 powers for some reason<br><br><br>don't worry you're both equally idiots</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Pedophilia <br> The same thing as statutory rape <br><br>You fucking serious?

There's was a shorter version of that translated in one of the threads.</br>  <br>That Hugo Boss model still keks me.</br>  <br>only have this</br>  <br>We still have at least 3 major arcs with bigger and bigger fights ahead of us. I don't think 350 Chapters is enough to finish the normal story AND explain everything that we don't have an explanation for yet.<br><br><br> Q2: How far along is the story right now, percentage-wise? <br> A: He told me that the first part of the story, the part prior to the time-skip, was around halfway through. That was about 60 volumes, so maybe we’re at 70%? I don’t think it’s at 80% yet. Something like that. </br></br></br></br></br>  Soon.  <br>Only the ones with stars are confirmed.</br>  <br>Oh shit right it was the other way around</br>  <br>Gear 4 reminds me of him. You think he can teach Luffy and others fishman karate once he joins?</br>  <br> Michael Jackson <br> Hody <br> not Jango <br>what?<br><br>also who the fuck thinks of Michael Jackson when they see Hody?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you assumed that much anyway when one piece will still be around for the next decade. Don't be so impatient.</br>  <br>Because between them and Fishman Island there was a little someone called Whitebeard</br>  <br>Robin. That outfit is so fucking hot</br>  <br><br>They should do a movie.</br></br>  <br>The original Hody looks a bit like Michael Jackson. Also fishmen are niggers and Hody become pure white.</br>  <br>He's  dead </br>  <br>Well, why not? Look at how much powerful the Strawhats became. Doffy's goddamn strong, but he started out at the level of a child as everyone else. To become this strong he had to improve step by step. Why would he suddenly stop improving during the period of two whole years? He's obviously grown a lot stronger every year to get to where he is now.</br>  <br>A warlord also lost to a guy with a 30mil bounty.</br>  <br>Nami Cowgirl style</br>  <br>An ex warlord killed a man that was considered the "Strongest in the world"</br>  <br>aaahahahahaha no</br>  <br>Whichever I could get. They're both great. A Bonney is fine too.</br>  <br>Yeah, BB <br>his entire crew<br>Akainu<br>Squardo<br>Kizaru<br>and the unforgiving backhand of time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's the hair and the hat, before he transforms<br>that's pretty much it</br></br>  <br>Fucking Squardo man. I don't even know what to say about him.</br>  Alright this thread is getting slow. There are people that think Zoro can take Fujitora. Zorofags come thru.    <br>Fujitora with DF or just sword?</br>  <br>I'm a Zorofag but not a retard. Neither of them has shown their full potential. Zoro's not the Strongest SM but Fujitora is part of the Marines greatest combat force.</br>  Threadly reminder  <br>Why would it be one or the other ? Fuji's used his DF by swinging his sword so both.</br>  <br>seing how dressrosa was a complete clusterfuck I'm sure he'll manage to put everything in it<br><br><br>every OP flag has a kind of meaning</br></br></br></br>  <br> his sword ate the df </br>  <br> There are people who don't understand that Fujitora, the GAMBLER, has been bluffing throughout the entire arc, and that being blind is literally the ultimate poker face. <br><br>Oda couldn't point this shit out any harder if he used a hammer made out of symbolism.</br></br></br>  <br>dat ugly flat uma thurman as robin<br>yeah... no</br></br>  <br>Well, I think Zoro is at least Fujitora's equal as as a swordsman, but I doubt he could win against a Fujitora using both sword and DF.<br><br>Really? I stopped reading a few months back in order to let the chapters pile up.</br></br></br>  <br>no, it wasn't revealed yet<br>just a theory</br></br>  <br>Let the shit posting commence.</br>  <br> dressrosa was a complete clusterfuck <br>Is it just me or was Dressrosa really not that hard to follow? Maybe it's because I got to read through it, but it wasn't confusing for me at all.<br><br> that or my reading comp is far superior from you plebs kek </br></br></br></br>  <br> Really? I stopped reading a few months back in order to let the chapters pile up. <br><br>You should start reading again if you're going arc by arc. Dressrosa arc is finished.</br></br></br>  <br>Uma Thurman is cute in Pulp Fiction.</br>  <br> Dressrosa arc is finished. <br>Not yet, we have a few more chapters. The main fight is done though. We'll probably leave around ch 800.</br></br>  <br>better ship is here</br>  <br>You're 300 posts too late.<br><br>Not hard to follow but there is so much going on its hard to get emotionally involved in the side stories, especially with a fuck ton of transient new characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, I don't see why it's one or the other. If Fuji is going to fight Zoro, he's gonna use his full power. Not just swing his sword. There's no reason to not use the DF.</br>  <br>only a theory supported by idiots though<br>also having a DF yourself + having a DF object wouldn't be a way of becoming OP?<br>surprised nobody did this before<br><br><br>never said it was difficult to understand<br>it's still just a shonen<br>I'm sometimes astonished to see people failing to understand even the most basic stuff in one piece<br><br>I'm just saying Oda put so many things in dressrosa:<br>the SH<br>doffy and his crew<br>law<br>fujitora<br>sabo and the rev<br>the dwarves<br>the royal family<br>the happou navy<br>king elizabello<br>bartolomeo<br>hakuba<br>big mom<br>a bit of kaidou and the other alliance<br>ceasar and the smile<br>etc...<br><br>and Oda said the NW will always be like that<br>so thinking 400 other chapters is not enough to wrap everything up...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> better <br>Best ship coming through</br></br>  <br>Arlong has you all beat.<br><br>So far the best ship in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it just my virgin hormones talking or is Nami the sexiest mother fucking piece of ass in any anime or manga?</br>  <br>They're just friends though. Neither of them see each other like that.</br>  <br>filler isn't it?<br><br>I must agree with <br>shanks' is so fucking awesome, with the drakkar design and the jungle trees in the back</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's your hormones. Nami is 4th (at best) behind Robin, Perona, and Hancock.</br>  <br>For now.</br>  <br>Someone else who sees through all the shit and that Shanks' ship = best ship</br>  <br>That's a really nice image FOR ANTS.<br><br>She's up there. You rarely see so much energy in Thai tax declaration women.</br></br></br>  <br>The Oro Johnson is the baddest looking ship around.</br>  <br> Shipping God with the weakest link </br>  <br><br>plebes</br></br>  <br> Nami behind Perona and Hancock <br>Perona is barely Top Ten and Hancock's proportions are fucking disgusting. I can't do with legs twice the length of one's torso.</br></br>  <br> Nami is pointing at me telling me she wants to fuck <br><br>S-slow down babe.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but it was the Pirate King's ship. The guy who won the seas. It doesn't count.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say Robin and Perona are "sexier" than Nami. They're hot and all but "sexy" isn't the word I'd use.</br>  <br><br>My virgin cock is telling me Nami is in first place.</br></br>  how sad will the next crew members backstory be?  <br> Perona is barely Top Ten <br>I'm sorry you were born with shit taste</br></br>  <br>We're gonna get a better Zoro flashback next. His is the least sad one for me.</br>  the cutest  <br>His/her planet was bombed by terrorists and their fathers tryed to eat him/her.</br>  <br>Zorofags please. His backstory is done, and it will always be the shittiest.</br>  <br> Neither of them see each other like that. <br><br><br>we already know  Viola 's backstory<br>and yeah  being raped multiple times by the entire doffy's crew  is pretty sad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I got a bonner for Bonney.</br>  <br> Oro Johnson <br>That's lewd anon.</br></br>  <br> tunnel of love boat with glasses <br> not this huge piece of deliciousness </br></br>  <br>I'm a zorofag but I agree on Zoro's backstory being quite shitty<br>but to be fair I was also very disappointed by Luffy's</br></br>  <br>I always heard that 4chan was full of homosexuals, but before now I didn't believe it.</br>  <br> I'm a ship <br> I'm a ship </br></br>  <br><br>watch her be as old as doctor kureha. <br> having sex with based bonney <br> gets too in the moment and she loses control of powers <br> look down <br> banging a shriveled old raisin <br>have fun</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. Luffy's is the 2nd least sad back story for me. Having Sabo alive made it even less sad. <br><br><br>Come on mate. Everyone knows Oda gives special attention to Zoro.</br></br></br></br>  <br>alright. i'll give you that one.</br>  <br>Nah anon you're looking at it wrong. <br>She can literally turn into any age fetish you have.<br>Best waifu.</br></br></br>  <br>Big Mom will be defeated just by Luffy eating her entire fucking ship, calling it now.</br>  <br>Nami, Robin, Bonney, Marguerite, Nojiko, Tashigi, Alvida, Domino. I count all of these and probably more as hotter than Perona. It's tough competition, and there's undoubtedly more that I can't recall off the top of my head.</br>  <br>But Ace is dead. He's the only strawhat that we got to experience the sad back story first hand in present time.</br>  <br>And I stand by my statement. The word "sexy" just doesn't apply to Perona. I agree that she's hot and attractive and what not but Nami's outfit makes her more sexy than Perona. In my opinion.</br>  <br> Hansel &amp; Gretel: The ship </br>  <br>Why do they need to have a sad backstory? I want someone who just woke up one day and said "You know what I need? Some motherfucking adventure and some badass friends!" And on that day the Strawhats met their newest crewmate, with a take no shit attitude. Like Lobo. They need Lobo.</br>  <br>because tragic events give them motivation for muh dream</br>  <br>Yea but Ace's death didn't make Luffy's flashback sad for some reason. I know it should have but it just didn't. Maybe because he didn't suffer as much as the other SHs, except Zoro. Luffy suffered in the present.</br>  <br>Sanji and Usopp didn't exactly suffer all that much either.</br>  <br> having sex with based bonney <br> gets too in the moment and she loses control of powers <br> look down <br> banging a loli Bonney </br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know who Lobo is but every Strawhat has gone through some kinda shit before joining. Don't ask me why it's "needed", it's just something that's has always been.</br>  <br>That's not the only thing that gives people motivation. I don't go to work every day and do an amazing job because my mother's throat was ripped out and raped by some gangster. I do it because I WANT to be the best at something. I take pride in my work. There are other motivations besides tragedy. That's why I like Whitebeard so much. He was the baddest, strongest human being around for at least 2 decades, and his whole motivation was just to have a family.</br>  <br> Domino <br> Tashigi <br> Alvida <br> hotter than Perona </br></br></br></br>  <br>agreed on Usopp but Sanji got it pretty hard</br>  <br>90's dark and edgy comic hero, bad boy doesn't play by rules, loves to murder, etc.</br>  <br>And then Big Mom will eat Luffy.</br>  <br> Domino <br>Finally someone with good taste</br></br>  <br> blushed Domino </br>  <br>Compared to the others Usopp didn't really suffer all that much.<br> mother died  <br> father still alive and kicking in shanks crew <br> the end </br></br></br></br>  <br> Dark and edgy <br><br>If you mean parody sure. He's clearly satirical. Well, that was his purpose anyways, to mock anti-hero's like Wolverine.</br></br></br>  <br>No way, man. Sanji lost his buddies at the old ship and starved for months. He remember wasting all those left overs and it felt like payback. That kinda stuff hits hard for a child. <br><br>Usopp basically lost both parents. He was dedperate and did everything to make his mother be happy but it all failed. He ended up being a compulsive liar for the rest of his life as a result. His lies are pretty much him trying to console himself. <br><br>They both suffered pretty damn hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is this semen demon?</br>  <br> Luffy suffered in the present. <br>That's what I'm saying. The 'sad' experience for him that he had to overcome was the only one we got to experience in present time. Not through a flashback like the rest of the crew but through the story itself. I think Luffy's hardest moments to overcome were him losing his crew at Sabaody and Ace's death.</br></br>  <br>The problem is a bunch of his writers forgot he was supposed to be edgy as a joke and played him completely straight.</br>  <br>Yea but think about why Whitebeard wanted a family. Probably some depressing shit.</br>  <br>He lost his testicles and/or his dick was too big for woman pussies. He was also an orphan.</br>  <br>Didn't seem like it in the one flashback we got for him.<br><br>I know....damned shame.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea, I get where you're coming from and Saboady and Ace did hit me hard. But Luffy still had a flashback and that flashback was weak. That's all I'm saying.</br>  <br> sexy as fuck <br> gives off sadistic vibe <br> she looks bad as fuck outside <br> she actually submissive inside <br><br>Fucking.<br>Marry.<br>Me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw bonney probably seduces men and then turns into a loli at the last moment to get them arrested for fun </br>  <br> But Luffy still had a flashback and that flashback was weak. That's all I'm saying. <br>yeah, agreeing to that too.</br></br>  <br>If Otohime could birth Shirahoshi and take Neptune trident then I'm sure Whitebeard could stick it to someone.</br>  I think Akainu will have a sad backstory. His hometown was probably raided by pirates, and his parents killed as well. His child drawing showed him holding a knife and very bloodied, like he was fighting for his life.  <br>Sanji hasn't ever been shown thinking about his old crewmates, and it's not like he received any lasting injuries (except maybe to his brain) or traumas. A bit of a guilty conscience towards Seff isn't all that. Usopp seemed able to live a good life despite being an orphan, and it's nothing compared to most of the Strawhats. Zoro is never shown having parents either, for that matter. Is he an orphan?</br>  <br>I could never get off to Perona because her eyes make me think of Animal Crossing and it kills my boner</br>  <br> Luffy and Bonney teaming up to eat the ship and   Big Mom and her crew because, surprise, they're also made out of food. <br> Sanji standing in the background unappreciated because nobody will eat his cooking now. <br>Please Oda</br></br></br>  <br>Shit. My buyfag dick is throbbing again and I just ordered some figures. Anyone else bought any OP merchendise?</br>  <br>How could you forget best Impel girl? She's the head jailer that works under Hannyabal.</br>  <br> she looks bad as fuck outside <br> she actually submissive inside <br>Exactly. This is exactly why she is best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Those eyes and those pigeon toes are the best parts. And her demeanor.</br>  Haki killed one piece  <br>I'm not saying Sanji and Usopp had the hardest childhood, bro. I'm saying they did actually suffer. <br><br>And Zoro probably wandered off from Wano and ended up in East Blue.

He used to go to Level 5 half naked to show his resolve and his fight against Luffy was touching. He's also funny as shit.<br><br>Too bad the same can't be said about Sai and Baby5.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Haki was necessary to continue the story in the New World in my opinion. Else Logias and DF users would be overpowered. It gives more balance. Plus people like Usopp getting observation haki is pretty badass and makes sense with his progression as best-to-be sniper.</br>  <br>I don't agree with him, but I did find logia powers more interesting when I figured they had to be worked around or countered by other powers. It made the users more like untouchable obstacles, not just people to straight-up fight against. Like the swamp logia guy, he could swallow anything so they locked him inside a barrel which he couldn't swallow from the inside. Much less fun if they'd just punched him unconscious.</br>  <br>Post-TS Tashigi is  smokin'  hot.

Besides, as least as far as Luffy, he's always had to work around enemies, it just boiled down to how &amp; how hard to hit the enemy.</br>  <br>But that's a legitimate and we'll established way to write.</br>  <br>Yea. But I always just accepted a character's looks.

I find it better than the manga    Shokugeki no Soma threads are pretty dead, aren't they?  The anime is pretty much following the manga exactly. You're not missing out on much if you decide to go in it anime-only.<br><br>Plus we get great scenes like this in the anime<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Guc<wbr>0wnMdYhw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the last one?</br>  Good because Erina ZR looks nicer than manga.  <br>BEST ENDING? BEST ENDING!</br>  Fucking hell, I love this show. It's stupid, yet it does everything right.<br><br>Would you let Meat Master master your meat?</br></br>  It's doing a pretty good job, but a few things that annoy me:<br>-Much less well stylised than the manga<br>-Doesn't say his trademark "it wasn't much"<br>-Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga<br>On the plus side, it makes a lot of scenes more hype</br></br></br></br>  <br>The scanlations have a much darker image than the original. And shadows don't really count as part of good adaptation. So far as adaptation is concerned it doing great and is almost a 1:1 accurate. They even added Erina's background from the one-shot and given her more screen time compared to the manga. The only major difference so far is the Karaage arc was rearranged after Jouichirou's visit which didn't do any harm to flow of the story.</br>  <br> Doesn't say his trademark "it wasn't much" <br>Yes he does, it's just that the sub for it is different. It's a pretty hard phrase to translate into English anyway.</br></br>  <br>Oh, does he still say it in nip? Wonder why they'd change the TL, the way they translate it in the manga works fine</br>   Best villain shows up once then never returns <br>How horrible. I wanted to see more of the sexy URBAN RAIFE PURANNER</br>  <br>Good, but I worry they are not going to be able to fit the entire tournament arc in the eps left.</br>  <br>Plot twist: She is actually the end game love choice. Turns up to cheer for Souma in his final shokugeki, causes him to win</br>  When will one of the girls bet their hair in a challenge? At least one of them has to get some character development right?  <br>if she grew her hair out, yes</br>  <br>They won't. Not with 8 episodes left. There's still the Karaage arc and they still have to introduce Hayama Akira and Shiomi Jun. At best it will end at the preliminaries.</br>  <br>they made him sound like a dewgong</br>  <br>but....the short blonde hair is her best feature<br><br><br>in a heartbeat</br></br></br></br>  <br>about as good an adaption as you could expect. definitely the best JC Staff adaption i've seen. that said nothing can match Tosh's art. and at times the anime seems lacking</br>  <br> Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga <br>But Takumi is never annoying?</br></br>  <br> nothing can match Tosh's art <br>I agree with you on that. The anime's art style is still pretty good. It's just Tosh's is not easy to replicate.</br></br>   there are people who think Erina is NOT going to win the soumabowl <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7l4<wbr>ESr0PdSQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Learn your place, plebs</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Where is this from?

Something light hearted before shit goes down again. Just can't wait to see what goes down and how. My expectation is that it will involve Erina quite heavily since she has had so much presence recently</br>  <br>That was cute as fuck.</br>  <br> it was only 10 chapters <br>the thing is 10 chapters of the same thing. the autumn election was not only based on ONE fucking fight.<br>yes there are many different movements souma is taking. but it took really long. it could have been simplified to 6 to 7 chapters. with the other 3 or 4-5 chapters still being the same festival but with different things to do.<br><br><br>I didn't think the karaage arc was shit, but like you said it has the same feeling. the arc itself was also long.<br><br>Seeing some Erina happening would be nice and would give some progress FUCKING FINALLY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This scenario they did for the drama CD would have fit perfectly with that limo scene they had after leaving Tootsuki resort.</br>  Hisako and Souma teaming up again when?  <br>Is suppose to be what happened in that scene.</br>  Color chapter is here   I just want Erina to find out that Souma is Jouchirou's son.<br><br>Just, do it this year please.</br></br>  <br> fucking soma's humming voice </br>  <br>I didn't mean that the karaage arc was shit either, just that the 2 arcs have a very similar 'calm before the storm' feeling to me. I know what you mean though, we really need some Erina progress. Hopefully shed some light on her relationship with Jouichirou and help her relationship with Souma in a serious way</br>  <br>-They're completely different mediums, as far as the art style goes it matches it very very well and the animation has been way better than expected.

The animation is really good, but I feel like the character designs are a lot more generic in the anime than the manga.</br>  <br> and we are already in the 100 numbers <br>This manga will go for more 400-500 chapters.<br>Jouichirou back story never.</br></br></br>  <br>I would kill for it because they literally have the best chemistry.</br>  <br><br>*Edit wrong quote.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather not have flashback arcs, but certainly some more info on the backstory would be nice. I'm just hoping the success doesn't cause the manga to overstretch itself for sales</br>  Did the Shokugeki x Isobe collabs get removed from Batoto again?  <br>God damn it. Fuck Batoto.</br>  <br>Why did they get removed?

First OP was really fucking great, just energetic boyish singing<br>UMARE KAWARU IMA KOKO DE</br>  <br>I don't really like 2nd OP either. Feels like it's missing something. Actually OP 1 felt more shounen to me, and it fit considering what kind of manga this is anyways.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> Meat in a summer dress <br><br>So fucking cute</br></br></br>  ED1 &gt; ED2 yes?  <br>Yes. <br>But ED2 is still cute.</br></br>  <br>fura fura was so catchy. But there was something shoujo-ish about ED2 which I kinda liked and I don't even read or watch shoujo.</br>  <br>OP 1 &gt; OP 2 as well.</br>  Do people still believe that Erina doesn't want Jouichiro's dick after the latest episode? <br><br> Hurr she just respects him as a chef that cooks with love. <br>Can't remember how many times I heard that bullshit. Reminder that all it takes for her panties to get for Soma is realizing that theyre father-son.</br></br></br>  <br> unironically being an animeonlyfag and shitposting about it </br>  <br>Who says I haven't read the manga? I've been saying this shit before the anime even aired. The latest episode just confirmed it even harder with all the colorful bubbles and blushing illustrations that Erina gets whenever Jouichiro's involved. <br><br>It's just sad that there are delusional idiots that refuse to believe that Erina salivates for Jouichiro's dick because they self-insert into Soma hard.</br></br></br>  <br>If you read the manga then you'd realize that Erina is a sheltered child who probably doesn't know how babies are made, and that she deeply respects Jouichirou for his amazing cooking and views it as perfect. There is literally nothing to suggest that she's after him sexually.</br>  It's a solid, straight-forward adaptation that doesn't really take many liberties with the source material. Not a lot of QUALITY moments either so far which is cool (not like this has high-impact action scenes with tons of elaborate motion but still).<br><br>It's pretty good, OP. I typically bore of harem-anything but the manga has kept me reading and the anime was a pleasant surprise.</br></br>  <br>It's nothing like that. It's more like a 1st grader having a crush on their teacher. Though I think she just really admires Jouichirou like a hero/idol or something. She's probably too innocent to even know what a dick is.</br>  I wonder when we're going to find out about Souma's mom.<br><br>I'm just assuming that she's dead since she hasn't shown up but who knows.<br><br>Think it'll be really sad if she's dead whenever they get around to talking about it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't mind OP2 but I definitely like OP1 better as well. I feel like this time, they're trying to convey in the music and the animation how much more serious, intense, and shounen battle-ish the second half is (which it is). But fuck it, I miss my UMARE KAWARU</br></br>  <br><br>Alright, I'm being facetious when I say salivating for his penis.<br><br>What I'm pointing out is a matter of whether or not she's crushing on him and longs for him in a sort of fantasy romance-sense, which I would argue that she does (FFS, she carries around a hidden photo of him with her.)<br><br>But some idiots on this board are so hung up on self-inserting that they refuse to believe that it's possible that Erina to develop romantic feelings for anyone beside Soma and that 'her feelings for Jouichiro is just respect for his skill as a chef!'</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I'll eat my own dick if those romantic feelings for Jouichiro don't transfer over to Soma as soon as she discovers their father-son relation (albeit following a serious case of denial for several chapters probably).</br>  <br>Yes<br>And OP2 &gt; OP1</br></br>  <br>A few implications kind of make you want to guess that she's kicked the bucket. Remember the shop was closed with no one else to watch it after Souma went to Tootsuki. I think if she was on a business trip she would have been phoned at least during that time Soma made a call to his dad after the Hayama/Kurokiba 3 way shokugeki. Probably a truck accident seeing how things usually are with manga plots nowadays.<br><br>Fucking truck-san.</br></br></br>  <br>Source is always better than the anime, but the adaptation is good, some parts obviously skipped so the manga is nice because you can get a different perspective</br>  <br> offscreen takoyaki date <br>IS THIS CANO<br> Best grill arrives and ruins atmosphere <br>Meh. 9/10, it's alright.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see it as more likely being sickness. Jouichiro falling in love with a fragile girl. After traveling around the world, his search for a 'key ingredient' ends right back in Japan and ends up being 'love' or something cliche like that. As she gets sicker, he continues to nurse her and cook for her various dishes he learned while traveling, allowing her to 'visit' places she was never able to since she was too sick.<br><br>This shit writes itself.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't expect a upbeat song for the 2nd track.</br>  <br>Either that or some stupid shit where it turns out Jouichiro's wife was basically Soma's Erina in terms of plot development (Starting from the bottom and winning the heart of an Ojou).</br>  <br>So she gets pregnant and dies in childbirth due to her weakness from the sickness coupled with labor? I guess I could buy that. But why would they agree on conceiving a child while she was that sick anyways?</br>  <br>But they have a family photo together, she died later.</br>  <br>She was alive when Souma was a kid.</br>  <br>Well she doesn't have to die in childbirth. Maybe she sucuumbed to sickness when he was really young.</br>  What I don't get is, why do Soma and Jo live like middle class people when they're clearly wealthy? Jo is a world class chef, and the fact that Soma can even attend this school is proof that they're loaded.  <br>Erina-fags, haters, non-erina fags, and shipperfags alike will have a week long war with that sort of revelation.</br>  <br>We still don't know. That's why we need a back story.</br>  <br>Probably wants to instill in him humble roots. The first chapter sort of emphasized the errors of thinking you're hot shit because you're the heir of a top class restaurant.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah. Well still, that kind of stretches it.</br></br>  <br>My guess is Soma's mom was probably a poorfag, and he just went with it.</br>  <br>Takes a lot of money to run a business, and Jouichirou needs travel money obviously. Housing in Japan isn't cheap either as I heard. Souma is also attending Tootsuki, a prestigious school for upcoming top chefs.</br>  <br>It also lets him learn how to do things in new ways instead of relying on older proven methods which seems to be one of the main themes of the show.</br>  <br>Souma's mom was probably as wealthy as Megumi but not so skilled as cooking and likely had anime cancer. While she was sick, Souma noticed she brightened up whenever his dad cooked for her so he tried to use his same tool and ended up cutting himself.<br><br>Otoh, it'd be just like Souma to getcut doing something frivilous and there's no deeper meaning behind it.</br></br></br>  <br>With the academy, they likely give scholarships since Megumi is a bit of a poorfag and she was able to attend.</br>  <br>Mehgoo's village probably saved up to send her there which is why she REALLY doesn't want to fail.</br>  <br>Then I guess Jouichirou isn't a lavish spender, he seems kind of like the type to live modestly, and not be materialistic. I'm guessing a lot of expenses just went into his shop and savings.</br>    Erina met joichiro one day <br>  gets mellowed a lot <br>  talks with him, asking about joichiro's wife <br>  he tells her she's ded on an accident while holding soma. And tells her that's how he got his scar <br>  the ice queen defrost speed increases </br></br></br></br>  New hot glue target.  <br>It's shit just like the manga</br>  <br> Fucking Truck-san <br><br>Seriously, they keep doing that. That shit came out of nowhere in Fuuka.</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna see someone cook her in a frying pan and douse her molten remains with ketchup.</br>  <br>Erina is beautiful but that throne is pig disgusting.<br><br><br>Want a band-aid for that cut?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Son of a bitch. Again!? What should I do at this point?</br>  <br>Nevermind me, I'm a moron who didn't check the time.</br>  <br>Osomatsu</br>  <br>I will pay to see that.</br>  sometimes I have to wonder if there are actually 12 year old jumpbabbies posting in these threads. I can't imagine any other explaination for the posters who can't understand why erina is popular.  <br>She's a competent character that can give the MC a run for his money, and facilitate his development, while at the same time is interesting/entertaining to watch herself. She's a character that helps the manga keep going, when properly utilized by Tsukuda, our writer, instead of getting stale.<br><br>^There's some reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand, I just don't agree because I'm not sheeple.</br>  <br>It was a good bait and switch by the anime adaption.</br>  <br>She might win but she'll always be shit.<br><br>Besides, we all know that best girl never wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell me anon<br>Who is the best girl?</br></br>  <br>Best in Souma bowl: Megumi<br>Best girl (technically): Alice<br>Best girl (unofficially): Takumi</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you.<br>Takumi a cute.</br></br>  <br>Good taste anon.</br>  <br>Megumi a shit A SHIT</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br> Best girl (technically): Alice <br> Best girl (unofficially): Takumi <br>Good taste</br></br></br>  <br>pleb</br>  <br>No that's Hisako as in best girl.</br>    <br>Souma is such a smug motherfucker.</br>  <br>lol holy fuck i guess i better read this instead of just watching the animu now</br>  After a certain point, does cooking skill really matter anymore? They all know how to cook the food, the real conflict comes from how well they make their recipes.  <br>see <br>they both think it matters at any rate</br></br>  So which one was better?  <br>The author of Koufuku Graffiti complained that he came up with the idea of foodgasms first, so I'm guessing that means Shokugeki is better.</br>  <br>Shokugeki is better.</br>  <br>Anyone doing the BDs?</br>  <br>I can understand not liking her on account of shit taste, but the people who complain "durr she's a bitch she was mean to souma what's good about her" have to be trolling or literally 12 years old.</br>  So when does Erina learn that her idol and mentor is Soma's dad?  <br>Never</br>  <br>That's be lame as shit if she never found out.</br>  <br>If anything, it turned her from an unknown hospital nutritionist into a celebrity chef.</br>  <br>Shokugeki is obviously better, but koufuku was good in its own right. One of my favourite anime from winter 15</br>  <br>The brass ones Souma has are mind-boggling sometimes. His entire attitude is basically "call the cops, I don't give a fuck". I love it.</br>  <br><br>Current theory is that she died in an accident that also gave Souma his scar.</br></br>  <br>Does Nikumi have a CD/track too? What's it about?</br>  <br>https://mikorin.wordpress.com/2015/<wbr>06/24/shokugeki-no-soma-volume-11-b<wbr>onus-drama-cd/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga <br>What, if anything he is more likable in anime, they somehow made him less bitchy. Plus his voice is pleasant to hear.</br></br>  <br>"It wasn't much" is better than "happy to serve" if only for the much-matsu sound.</br>  Oh, the things that I want to do to Hisako  <br>"Happy to serve" is such a western phrase which doesn't quite follow what "Osomatsu" conveys.</br>  <br>Poor Nikumi, it must have felt bad to learn that  she got dancecucked by Megumi. <br>I would've enjoyed seeing what Nikumi dancing with Souma would be like.</br></br>  <br>Its always fun to see him just whip out his shit-eating grin and piss someone off without giving a single fuck</br>  <br>Hah what</br>  <br>Would probably be awkward and terrible as Nikumi stumbles and steps all over her own feet, since she was probably never taught how to dance, since thats "girly"</br>  <br>I plan on making the Gotcha Pork Roast this thursday, is there a translated recipe of it?</br>  <br>hahaha yeah my fav part cucked by Megumi. Dam wish i got to read Megumis reaction to being asked to dance with souma</br>  <br> My father didn’t let me have any of the toys or games that girls did. But because I didn’t complain about the lessons necessary for business, ballroom dancing was the one thing that allowed me to be like a girl. <br>She says and demonstrates as well that she knows how to dance.</br></br>  <br>Don't you dare talk shit about Truck-san.</br>  <br> call the cops, I don't give a fuck". <br><br>That does sounds like Souma.<br><br><br><br><br>You know, I'm starting to think that Souma will not defeat Kuga, but instead drop his sells a bit so Kuga will end up losing first place to some other club.<br>Considering his "two more days" foreshadowing, his bet with Tsukasa is being first all five days and Souma will fuck it.<br><br>Then he will be pretty mad and accepts Souma shokugeki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  erina's so flat  <br>This is just a couple shops away from becoming Takumi.</br>      <br><br>What have you done?</br></br>  <br><br><br> the city of batoto </br></br></br>  Is he going to get cucked by his old man?  <br>Yeah.<br><br>And the kid will inherit the diner.</br></br></br>  <br> cucked <br> <br>we use here NTR</br></br></br>  <br>I guess Jouichirou must have been in Senzaemon's good graces to work for him after not graduating.<br><br>He probably dropped out voluntarily instead of being expelled through shokugeki or disciplinary action.</br></br></br>  <br>It's great. I can actually watch it with my family, even. My mom gasped when Shinomiya failed Megumi (she had been out of the room when this fact was spoiled early in the episode).<br><br>It's solid as Hell as an adaptation, very pleased with it. Can't believe this is an adaptation for a Shounen Jump manga.</br></br></br>  The new ED is massively disappointing.  <br>well the first one was godly not a surprised the new one isnt as good</br>  <br> I can actually watch it with my family, even <br><br>Sounds fun.</br></br></br>  <br>It is!</br>  <br>It's excatly like the manga, that's why they haven't progressed that much yet. It's adapting every chapter without skipping anything (even the details). So watching the anime or reading the manga it doesn't matter it's the same. Only the manga is a lot further that's the only pro I can think of off.</br>  <br> So watching the anime or reading the manga it doesn't matter it's the same <br>Despite I consider the anime an excellent adaptation it's not exactly the same as the manga. Different media have different execution, presentation. and storytelling. The anime also does not lend well to Tosh's art style though still quite good.</br></br>  <br> Fucking hell, I love this show. It's stupid, yet it does everything right. <br><br>The general idea and setting was good along with the initial "everyone against the protag" deal. <br>I think that the execution is what lets it down and is what turns it into just another bland shounen with an OP protag that makes friends and shit easily. It doesn't feel like a struggle and massively hurts the tension and excitement.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They aren't his girlfriends in the first place yet and most of them are only interested in Soma because they imagine his dad when they look at him.</br>  <br>Is your mum single?</br>  <br>No, but there's this one. Try ignore the autism:<br>http://anitay.kinja.com/food-wars-r<wbr>ecipes-in-real-life-1-fake-pork-roa<wbr>st-1703359028</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Man, this is total bullshit. There is literally NO. WAY. her tongue would ever accept generic takoyaki.</br>  <br> I think that the execution is what lets it down and is what turns it into just another bland shounen with an OP protag that makes friends and shit easily. <br> OP protag <br> Souma <br> OP <br><br>nigger there 2 other students just as good as him and one much better just in the first year , with the second and third years being hinted as being much better than them.<br><br> but he shows no effort! <br>just because some one is not crying and bitching 24/7 about having to try too hard doesnt mean they are not having a hard time.<br><br>though I do agree with the friends thing, it would be good to have more people who just dont like him like Eizan showing up and trying to take him down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's pretty much lost more than he's won so far I don't know what that guy is talking about.</br>  <br>Just to be clear, all three of the Drama CD tracks were written by Tsukuda himself. They mention this several times in the VA interview section. Also, apparently he and Isami's VA are old friends.<br><br>Also, the drama CD is only available with the limited edition of vol 11 of the manga. It's literally a supplement to the manga.<br><br>Erina's track is the one that's most obvious in how it fits. It's simply the rest of the car ride back to school after the manga cut away. Megumi's track is somewhere between the end of the hell camp and the elections. So there's a window of like a month or so where it's set. I honestly don't know when Meat's track takes place though, other than obviously after she's beaten and joins the Don RS.<br><br>On an unrelated note, Akira's been added to the official site.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Suwabe is confirmed then?<br><br>God damn. I called Okamoto and him to voice Ryou and Hayama, can't believe it actually happened. Based JC Staff.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, he was confirmed a week or two ago. New announcement was Sugita as Eizan.<br><br>Also vol 2 cover preview image. Vol1 should be out in a couple of days. Hope we get onsen tapestry scan.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Crazy, when I saw Hayama, I kept thinking how I can't stop hearing Suwabe's voice as he spoke since his dark skin, white hair reminded me of Archer. <br><br>Now it's actually happening. For Sugita though I somewhat tied him to voicing Dojima but I ended up loving the one they got instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is the anime sales still doing poorly? I know its irrelevant for producing another season but they're getting some big name seiyuus.  <br>  dat erina-hishoko <br>Muh heart</br></br>  This ad.  <br> ***,191位/***,227位 (**1,322 pt) [*,*10予約] 2015/07/29 「食戟のソーマ」第1巻＜初回生産限定版＞ [Blu-ray] <br>It's gradually getting better, two days ago it was 1,295 pt.</br></br>  <br>I can honestly see Shokugeki sell 10k since Hayama and Ryou joining in will bring in the fujobucks if Ishiki hasn't already.</br>  <br>At least it will never sell as poorly as hanayamata</br>  <br><br>SnS is in a pretty nice spot.

Considering Jo seems to know Erina already, who's to say there's not an arranged marriage?</br></br>  <br>He's a travelling chef and best friends with a close business associate of Totsuki and the Nakiri. It's not implausible to have them meet with no pretext</br>  I'm sure they are all naked under the sample banner and that this is in no way misleading.  <br> Yaranaika? </br>  <br> arranged marriage <br>Maybe. If I remember correctly in the novels  Alice's father organized a competition to find a good husband for her . Probably the same happened to Erina.</br></br>  <br>Tapestry will come with the fourth volume.</br>  <br> inb4 Souma and Erina are finally dating. <br> fiance comes out of nowhere. </br></br>  <br>Its very unlikely that there would be. Jouichirou doesn't seem to be the type of person who would force his son into that kind of predicament.</br>  <br>yeah honestly, he's the kind of guy who would take his kid to the supermarket, misplace him, and go home forgetting that he brought him there in the first place.<br><br><br>you're breaking my heart. I guess they just give you the redemption voucher when you preorder 1-4 together?</br></br></br></br>  <br>what about the tapastry</br>  <br>  <br>?</br></br>  <br><br>There is a ticket inside the first three volumes, which must be sent along with what comes inside the fourth volume.<br>I want to buy them just to get the tapestry but I dont know tho whom I must sent them so I can claim it. Until I learn about it, I wont buy anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously the fiance trope is so overused. Besides it wouldn't make sense if Souma was unknowingly betrothed to some girl already.</br>  <br>Anon's talking about an arrangement for Erina in that post. As in "some new dude butts into the picture"</br>  I like food  <br>Everyone likes food. That's why this manga is popular.</br>  <br>Still a step down for Tosh from sex, though.

It would be pretty funny if she did and  as a possible protagonist joining up too. </br>  <br>someone once said that it'd be fun if she came back as Yuuma being all sweet and with no memories of what she did<br><br>That'd be awesome for all the awkwardness it'd bring</br></br></br>  <br>not really ashy lover , she is dead and gone.<br>Loki came back because he was left alive in the LNs.<br>ashy tits is literally erased from existence , the only way for her to come back is some one actually going out of their way to get her from a previous point in time, and she really fucked so many people over that no one would actually do it .</br></br></br>  <br> Mention Raynare <br> omg ashy lover! ashy lover! <br>Fear not though, my dear basement dweller, for I really am not a Raynarefag. Im simply pointing out the possibility of her coming back since this entire series is pretty much out of wack for me and its gotten pretty shitty to be honest. I didn't think Ishitbumi would go as far as doing this whole time travel bullshit, but it seems like he really wants to milk in the cash now. I'd expect a lot of things to not make sense if he's really going to continue on this route, especially with the whole 'expect things to be different from the novels' theory.</br></br></br>  Still best girl.  <br> especially with the whole 'expect things to be different from the novels' theory. <br><br>Not that guy, but that was only for BorN. The sole purpose of all of this was EX. That's it. We're done. With a big fuck you to anime-only viewers.</br></br></br>  <br> Bring her back! <br> but have her completely different! yeah! <br> no one will mind if she jjust doesnt remember how much of a cunt she was! they will just be awkward about it <br><br>Fucking those ashes is messing with your head, Rias alone would burn her again as soon as she sees her, Akeno would probably do the same, Koneko would punch her head off, hell even Kiba would just stab her ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> there are Asiafags </br>  <br>But the whole point of EX is to stop the differences anon.

I dont even like the series!  <br> side story that has no effect on the novels and after its resolved has no effect on the anime other than fixing the Loki related bullshit <br> HE WANTS TO MILK THE SERIES!!!! <br><br>So did you loose your shit this hard over the sex changing gun side story ? or about the 300 clone side story?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that webm  <br>My dick thanks you.<br><br>Also, Rias a best and I want to marry her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I dont even like the series! <br>I don't believe I've said anything of the sort. I did mention that it felt too out of wack but that's about it. But it seems like you're the one getting too defensive, kid. As far as I'm concerned, yes he really does want to milk the series at this point, and your point being? I don't see how the side stories would be grouped into it considering they actually got their own novels and were in the timeline of the entire universe. This time travel bullshit is definitely crap.</br></br>  <br>FINALLY<br><br>Now all I need is a full BD scan of BorN 01 and this is the best day ever.</br></br></br>  Why she was so tempting?  <br>I have no clue where the rip is for volume 1.

Why are all DxD and F/SN fanfiction "Shirou in DxD"? Why not Saber? Imagine the fallout if they find a True Excalibur and King Arthur. Or why not Issei getting summoned as a Servant?   <br> There are at least two that I know of with Saber. </br>  <br> The only good crossover one is the one with Harry Dresden.  </br>  S4 when?  <br>Next year at the earliest.</br>    <br>Highschool D×D BorN Special 1</br>  the fallen angel girls is all so hot  <br> qt3.14 Yuuma gets revived <br> Raynare is kept in ashes <br> mfw </br></br></br>  <br>Only been out for a couple of days.

Also it takes no effort for Issei to make a new armor, that's a trait of Divine Dividing and Boosted Gear.</br>  <br> I hope they adapt the actual story in s4 <br><br>They are, they released a statement about it two months ago, and why Ishibumi wrote EX where Loki basically caused the changes in BorN.</br></br></br>  <br> Also it takes no effort for Issei to make a new armor <br>It was because Rias sucked him that she could sync to the dragon swarm?<br> captcha: nice boat </br></br></br>  <br>Is anyone going to translate EX?</br>  <br>We will get summary.</br>  <br>No idea. I don't think any of the main guys on DxD have gotten the online raws yet. They are just going by Japanese blog posts and sources.</br>  <br>It's basically a story that tells of why the anime was so shit (and badly deviated from the LN), and it's due to Loki fucking things up.<br><br>It's some sort of Inception.<br><br><br>Well, as mentioned in previous threads, it's not easy for pure devils to get pregnant and have children. Rias, being a pure devil, is the least fertile of the 6 in his current harem (the special chapters are set pretty early on; so no Ravel, Valkyrie, or Witch mamas).<br><br>We have Koneko, her sister, Rias, Xenovia, Irina, and Akeno's children mostly confirmed (mostly, as we could always get a curveball with Koneko having 2 children instead of her and her sister having 1 each).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pure devils can't get pregnant easily.<br><br>Like elves and other mythical long-lived beings, the price of longevity is low fertility/birthrates.<br><br>So even if each of them fucked Issei once a day and assuming he did not shoot blanks after the 3 or 4th round, Rias is the least likely to get pregnant compared to Kuroka or Koneko, who both can go into heat and ready to procreate.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude had to bust at least 10 nuts a day<br><br>Sounds fun</br></br></br>  <br>The raws were posted, but they're shitty cam raws and they're very blurry.</br>  <br>He has BOOSTO so his balls are always full.<br>I'm more on the side to see him fucking side girls.</br></br>  <br>Did the same happen for the side stories that came with New? Or did people not really bother with it since they were just dates with the girls?</br>  <br>It did, but you'll have to look for those. The western fanbase has been absolutely garbage at doing any sort of work to gather spoilers and scans. Mostly it's just those who edit the wiki who bother looking on tieba at all.

But jop isn't certain on the reading either.</br>  <br>Is there anything on the age of them? Other than Ixis being the youngest that is.</br>  <br>I suck at Kanji. Basically the character 紅 can be read as Kou and Kurenai. So the child's name is most likely Kou and Akeno picked that kanji to bully Rias.</br>  <br>No, just that ones introduced so far are all males. I will laugh my ass off if Issei doesn't have a single daughter.</br>  <br>I would fucking cry.<br><br> Although the more boys, the more they can repopulate the entire universe. </br></br></br>  <br>Koneko/Kuroka should be a safe bet.</br>  <br> Quarta <br>Wait, Issei hooks up with Sister Griselda? What?</br></br>  So Akeno is the first huh?  <br>That's Xenovia's last name as of volume 19.</br>  <br>Zenovia's family name is Quarta.<br><br>Before Rias at any rate and she's flaunting it.</br></br></br>  <br> 07-20-2014 </br>  <br>yep, the slut is first</br>  <br> Zenovia's family name is Quarta. <br>No she's an orphan.</br></br>  <br>She's had the name since before meeting Rias and co, but yes you are right.</br>  Rias' son's name is strange as fuck.<br>イクス my guesses are Ixis, Ichs, Ixs and Iks.<br>Does anyone have any other suggestions? It's definitely not Japanese.</br></br>  <br>I would assume Ixis or Ichs. The latter maybe, because isn't his name a combination of Issei and Sirzechs?</br>  <br>Maybe something related to Issei? Kinda sounds around the ballpark. <br><br>Any details on why Akeno's the first or is it just "these guys had the D first and well so here are their kids".</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing that confirms Akeno is the first. All we know is that Rias is likely last.</br>  <br>she was getting ready for some sex with him using Jamal and Tyrone so it probably isnt isseis kid</br>  <br><br>It is a combination of Issei and Sirzechs, but only of Issei's informal nickname. Issei's real name uses the kanji for one and truth.</br></br>  Have the girls or Issei aged at all? Probably not Rias. Mainly hoping for adult Koneko. I wonder how Akeno would be for a mother. I'm sure she'd have...questionable... mothering techniques. Not questing her feeding skills though.  <br>It's the children coming back in time, so we won't see any of the main cast from the future most likely.</br>  <br>Issei is dead for real.</br>  <br> using Jamal and Tyrone <br>The heck is this guy talking about?</br></br>  <br>Also there is no mention so far of Kou being the firstborn, just that he calls Ixis his little brother.<br>Ixis' title is pretty metal though. Dragon god of destruction, fuck 666, this guy can handle it.</br></br>  <br>That's so hilariously unfortunate.</br>  <br> Dragon god of destruction <br>That isn't even fair. This kid is basically the second coming of dragon christ.</br></br>  <br>He has some sort of BBC fetish. Sounds really fascinated with them to be honest.</br>  <br>That anon sucks so many bbc that he can't stop thinking about it. Don't mind him anon.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Ise is going to be the one to breast 666. Especially with Diabolous Dragon.</br>  <br>The full title is crimson sword of the divine destruction dragon (dragon god of extinction).<br>I don't know of any divine dragons that go by that moniker, so he is definitely the divine dragon of extinction. Also according to jop he already has quite the reputation as the strongest swordsman of the house. Fucker surpassed his own master Kiba.</br></br>  <br> breast <br>I meant beat sorry. Fucking swiping piece of shit phone</br></br>  <br>He probably surpassed Kiba in pure power only.</br>  <br> typo sounds better than originally intended <br>Your phone knows what's up.</br></br>  <br>Fuck, mistranslation. It says shinmetsuryuu-ko, so he is the child of the divine dragon of destruction. Issei leveled up to dragon god confirmed.</br>  <br>Ishibumi is on crack when he thinks of these titles.<br><br>And I fucking love it.</br></br></br>  <br>Ophis + Great Red. Of fucking course he's going to be a dragon God. His own kids won't even get to surpass him in pure power. Looks like Ishibumi is taking the dragon ball Z route where Goku's lineage isn't stronger than him.</br>  Can't Rias have more than one kid? Or is it confirmed Ixis is the only one?  <br>The two strongest beings in existence gave him a body and he can tap into their power. I don't think it's remotely possible for him to be surpassed especially considering he's immortal and won't ever grow past his prime.</br>  <br> Can't Rias have more than one kid? <br>She can but she'd be pregnant for quite a few hundred years. Walking around pregnant like that probably won't be comfortable. Makes for one hell of an image though.</br></br>  <br>The kids are from xx years from the future. Double digits.<br><br> Imagine how many times Issei had to fuck each girl daily to reach that result </br></br></br>  <br>Except they are, they're just a bunch of layabouts who would rather study, or have a social life than train 24/7 to attract bigger and badder enemies to the planet like some sort of fighting magnet.<br><br>Of course she can have more, but keep in mind that Rias and Sirzechs are 400 years apart and Sirzechs and Grayfia have been together since the last war with the old satan faction, so it might take a while.</br></br></br>  Knowing Issei has kids with all of 'em is interesting but I'd like to see a little bit of their daily lives. Maybe Issei goes around, order his highest-ranking minions to go do stuff, He comes home to Rias, Rias says something like "Do you want dinner, a bath, or maybe me?" Something like that.  <br> implying he's not living in his familiar just floating around the Dimensional Gap after kicking Great Red out </br>  <br>They're in a war, so not much time to enjoy SoL family shenanigans.</br>  <br>What if it is somewhat connected to the title?<br><br>EX read as eks ... -&gt; Iks?<br><br>So, maybe the name should sound like that as well. So, the best "looking" would be Ixs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is gabriel blessing dead or something? </br>  <br>In a war? I'd want to see that even more! To be honest, my interest in the LN sorta tapered off after volume 12 since no other subsequent volume could top it in terms of interest though the Gasper family fight was sorta interesting. It was the last LN I read.</br>  <br>That is also very likely, which is why I am personally leaning towards an Ixis due to the X sound. jop edited the post and now says he has no clue on the readings.<br>It's a shame that oppai dragon, or sekiryuutei are no longer in use as Issei's titles though. Ddraig must be glad that he is no longer the titty dragon. Maybe Issei finally calmed down after getting his dick wet for the first time.</br></br>  <br>Volume 20 is the best of the new arc so far.</br>  <br>Really? So should I pick it back up? I hear Vol 19 is a trudge to get through.</br>  <br>v17 ... kinda.<br>v18 is a dud.<br>v19 has its moments.<br> Dulio's story <br> Strada being badass. <br><br>v20 is definitely a must read. There are summaries, if you can bear with that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is, but it's basically the calm before the storm seeing as all hell breaks loose in Volume 20.</br>  <br>Wait for translation and skim through it, vol 20 is based on vol 10/11 so it's good.</br>  <br>Ishibumi tweeted that the nips really liked this volume, I think it was referred as one of the best Volumes in the series.<br><br>Also some Stalker stats on the other Volumes of BorN if you all wish to see.<br><br> http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/inde<wbr>x2.cgi?smd=title&amp;tn=%83n%83C%83X%83<wbr>N%81%5B%83%8BD%81%7ED+BorN</wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br></br>   watching episode 12 of Born <br> they kiss <br> "Oh I don't remember what happened lol" <br>Fuck, triggered my annoyance of when that shit happened with Lina and Goury in SLAYERS</br></br></br>  Correction from last time, the name of the foreign god is Melvazoa, not Valvazoa.  <br>I guess you're  Devil Triggered. </br>  <br>Admittedly, I feel triggered by that too.</br>  Can anyone tell me why people aren't telling Issei that he already has a harem?  <br>No clue, Issei has all the pieces there, all he has to do is put two and two together. Kinda hard with the whole Trihexia scenario to deal with.</br>  <br>I thought he already realized. That's why he asked Azazel on tips on how to keep them all happy</br>  <br>There is the "This is this, that is that" kind of thing Issei is always talking about.<br><br>Maybe, that is what is being reference when Issei is talking about getting a harem.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I just remember reading that Venerana did absolutely NOT want him to know for some reason.</br></br>    <br>I hope there will be a day when we don't have to "imagine" and we can see it</br>  Oppai  do we have an eta on vol 19 translation?  <br> I hope there will be a day when we don't have to "imagine" and we can see it <br><br>then you are past being delusional, DxD is rated for all ages and it wont show anything besides what they are doing with EX, a time jump and then "they fucked some time in the past and had kids!" , in the very best of cases a fade to black with no cock blocking happening but we wont get to "see" anything at all.</br></br></br>  I want to marry Akeno  <br>I want to marry Rias and have an affair with Akeno, with all out threesomes with both of them every other night.</br>  <br>I like how you think.</br>  <br> It's simple anon. Shirou is better for self-insertion.  </br>  <br>Onesan duo stronk</br>    <br>Probably to make sure her own daughter gets the most attention.</br>  <br>Probably she wants Rias to have actual control of it as the manager of the harem before Issei just goes and fucks them all 24/7</br>  <br>Pretend you're Issei dumbass.</br>          <br>are these card designs or something? where are all these from?</br>  Anyone has the hand holding gif/webm?  <br><br><br> yfw Grayfia cosplays in lewd outfits to divert Sirzech from his siscon tendencies. </br></br></br>    <br> Sakuya after getting the D </br>  <br><br><br>OH GOD MY DIIIIIICK</br></br></br>  <br>Raynare's ghost, stop shitposting. You're the one who's always talking shit about her simply because she only takes a healing role.<br><br>Asia is pure and cute.</br></br></br>  <br>All ages? People are gettin horny younger and younger</br>  <br>anally</br>  <br>Mobage. There's a shit ton over at a certain website 4chan circlejerk hates over</br>  <br>Why is Asia so bad again? Sure, she  used to partake in  cockblocks and doesn't do much in battle besides heal. But how can you hate the person who  got a pact with best Dragon Fafnir? </br>  <br> yfw Issei fucked them in their armors </br>  <br> Fafnir is IN the armor but cant do anything <br> has to be there while his precious Asia chan is defiled over and over again <br> Ddraig keeps apologizing while Fafnir cries <br> Issei keeps traumatizing all the dragons in the DxD universe <br><br>well I guess when you are Dragon jesus you have to show the others who is the boss.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Those tits <br>I know the illustrator is notorious for constantly fucking up the character designs but I don't get why Issei constantly describes Asia's breasts as "Still growing" but not Xenovia's or Irina's even though they're the same age.</br></br>  <br>Because Asia just has more potential than them. There was oppai stats in a magazine back in May and Asia had an 8/5 potential rating.</br>  <br>Jeus when did Asia get so big</br>  <br>Becuase Xenovia and Irina both have bigger breasts , he probably means Asia's "look" like the breast of a girl still growing, while the other girls have tits the size that you'd expect on a grown woman... even though they also should still be growing. <br><br>Breast sizes in the harem go<br><br>Kunou &gt; Koneko &gt;Asia &gt;Ravel &gt; Irina = Xenovia &gt; Rose &gt; Kuroka = Shirone mode Koneko &gt; Rias &gt; Akeno<br><br><br><br> Because Asia just has more potential than them. <br>That has nothing to do with it. <br><br><br>Miyamanatomy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Being exposed to dragon get you that, not even Yuumi could escape from it despite just being close to Issei.</br></br>  <br> That has nothing to do with it <br>Apparently it does because Ishibumi himself said Asia was growing.</br></br>  <br>Has nothing to do with how miyama just fucks up from time to time and draws bigger tits than she needs to, or smaller tits in some cases...or double jointed legs , long ass necks, t rex arms, etc. <br><br>Ishibumi said that because he is actually expanding her abilities and actually making her useful.</br></br></br>  <br> the size that you'd expect on a grown woman <br>Realistically, on a porn star.</br></br>  <br> She can but she'd be pregnant for quite a few hundred years <br><br>No she wouldn't, devils have a low fertile rate meaning Rias and Ise would have to fuck a lot.<br><br>Also from looking at EX spoilers:<br> While continuing as the people's heroes, is full of openings……っ！ <br>That's precisely why i'll deny that person！<br>――Crimson haired young swordsman<br><br>Is Rias kid bashing Ise here?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirone Koneko is best Koneko</br>  <br>Yeah it was in one of the early previews, he seems to not be all that happy about how good and kinda inocent issei is even in the future, forgiving enemies and shit, and he looks up to Vali.<br><br>Basically classic teenage kid being angry at his dad for no real reason and thinking his uncle is way cooler.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he's just tsun for his dad.</br>  <br> fuck a lot <br>I'd still watch it</br></br>  <br>She is pretty fucking great.</br>  <br> Is Rias kid bashing Ise here? <br><br>Oh god is he going to be another Boruto?!</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if he will look up to Ise when the future is changed.</br>  <br>he probably looks up to him already but thinks he is immature  which IS kinda true  and just wants him to act "cooler" , again like a lot of teenagers think their dads are lame for no other reason than "he is my dad he cant be cool" , its a weird phase a lot of teenage boys go through.</br>  So when will Saji get cucked exactly?  <br>I dont think that word means what you think it means, you need to be in a relationship to be cucked .</br>  <br> in fanfic </br>  <br>I wonder if she looks like that in the future.</br>  <br>I hope all of them aren't stupidly serious like Ikusa because he's turning out like a fucking stuck up brat. So what if your daddy doesn't kills his enemies?</br>  <br> While continuing as the people's heroes, is full of openings……っ！ <br>Is Ise still a scrub at this point?<br><br> full of openings  <br>kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes the transformation is suppose to show how her body will grow, or how some people think she would look if she had used her powers and had grown normally like Kuroka did.<br><br><br>They all seem to be more agressive than the cast , which might be because of the mission, or because of their dragon sides... but he seems to be the only try hard edgy like kid, the whole thing might come from him being the youngest/younger than the others that came back in time, which could lead to some delicious shenanigans with the others teasing him and shit .</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its been a while sinse issei has been considered a scrub, the fucker bitched slapped grandpapi vali and left him defenseless so Vali and Fafnir could finish the job...which is what Ixis has an issue with, the openings he mentions are in his personality not his power.</br>  <br>Just remember what Azazel said in volume 4.<br> Dragons are always angry, one way or another </br></br>  <br>One of the best design waste on one of the shittiest role in the story...truly a shame.</br>  <br> Dragons are always angry, one way or another <br>So I'm guessing Ise is an abnormal dragon then since he's kind?</br></br>  <br>That's offset by his short fuse and temper.</br>    <br>He is angered pretty fucking quickly after he gets his dragon body, <br>Remember that they all try to hide the fact that Rias and Kiba are help captive by the vampires for a whille out of fear he would just loose it again and punch a hole in reality or fly down there are start some unnecessary extra beef... or how he was running around tearing shit apart with his dragon arms when the wizards invaded the school.<br><br>Also his lust kinda pushes the anger away.</br></br></br></br>      <br><br><br>Why are you posting plank pictures anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, no reason</br>  Raynare was a bitch but fuck all if her character design in dere mode wasn't fucking terrific.  <br> dere mode <br><br>There was no dere mode anon, that would imply she cared and its seems a lot of Raynare fans forget that there was no "Yuma" there was no separate personality that was actually nice, it was only Raynare being a very dumb cunt , so its silly when people post " Raynare was a bitch! but Yuma was nice! " .</br></br></br>  <br>I am really worried anon, it seems like all the pictures you post just get erased from existence as if some one used destruction magic on them or something.</br>  <br>Would still sex up.</br>  <br>Oh dont get me wrong, there is nothing bad about wanting to fuck her brains out its just silly when people trick themselves into thinking she was nice , thats why I can respect that one ashyfag that posts the copypasta all the time he likes her character as a whole and not just her pretend "nice" persona.</br>  <br>Bully pls</br>  <br> That's my secret Rias, I'm always angry. </br>  Her facial expressions are golden.    <br>You know what else is golden?<br><br>DAT ASS</br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck where is this from</br>  <br>High School dxd.</br>  <br>I meant like specific episode or OVA that I apparently missed. Same for your new image. Oh is it from the new OVA?</br>  <br>How long have you been waiting to do this joke anon?<br><br>Good job, by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>The ass picture is from S3 ... episode 5 i think.<br><br>Koneko one is from one of the specials in S1.</br></br></br>  <br>OH FUCK I REMEMBER THE KONEKO NOW HOLY SHIT. Akeno one still isn't ringing any bells. I guess I'll have to watch the entire series from start to finish again.</br>  <br>Its the episode they all cosplay for Issei.<br>the girls start with transparent miko costumes, then Rias gets the devil one, and Akeno just pulls the microkini out.</br></br>  <br>Damn. I don't know how I could've forgotten it. You've got a load of these pics now don't you?</br>  <br> you will never fondle Rias' oppai  <br>Life sure is suffering.<br><br><br>Cosplay Rias was hot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually dont have that many</br>    I felt sorry for Rias this season but I thought Akeno shined pretty well. Especially during the date. Sad there was no obvious Kiba though.  <br>We need more teasing Akeno. This is important.</br>  <br> Akeno shined pretty well. Especially during the date. <br>Except they butchered her whole arc, the date had way more meaning in the novels but i guess cutting the entire rating game kinda fucked over the real reason why the date happened in the novels which sucks because showing Akeno emotionally upset about issei being hurt and straight up trying to murder the sitri team was a nice touch that shows the girls reacting and standing up for issei instead of him always being their hero.</br></br>        <br> what I expected <br><br><br> what I got </br></br></br></br>      <br>Asia's Asias have been confirmed to be growing as the time passes</br>    I can't fap to Rias even if I tried. I'm a faggot, kill me it hurts to live  <br>Is there a particular reason or you just dont find her atractive ?</br>  <br>Time to cure the gay out of you.</br>          https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-2/<br><br> When will Spyro return with the new translations? </br></br></wbr>   Never   <br>What is Iroha supposed to be?

All we know animal-wise is that she's allergic to cats.<br><br>For my money, I think rabbit since her mom and dad sure do fuck like one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that supposed to be an insult?</br>  <br>Not at all, it's what the manga showed her as.</br>  This thread is even slower than the Iroha one.

Yukipasta Yui buns  <br>I want to make this Yuigahama a Yuigamama.</br>  <br>Side bun yukinon is almost as cute as the genuine article.</br>  Maybe Yui should just kill herself and solve 90% of the problems.  <br>That would just be running from the problem and not solve anything.<br>Perhaps you should do it Anon.</br></br>  Imagine Yui and Yukino's feelings when they attend the wedding between 8man and Iroha.<br><br>It's only a matter of time.</br></br>  <br>Why would he take responsibility for Zaimokuza's mistake?</br>  Doesn't matter who ends up with who, I just want this guy to be happy<br><br>Although I prefer Yukino, but she has to grow too. Maybe rejection will facilitate that?</br></br>  What would Yui and Yukino think if they saw 8man playing with Keika? Would they tell Komachi she may have been replaced? Would they get jealous? <br><br>Would they imagine having him care for their own children?</br></br>   no Iroha to look down on me   <br>Not sure how being rejected again will help her grow.<br>Only reason rejection helped HIkki grow was because he was rejected over and over until it didn't even phase him anymore.</br></br>  <br> you will never smell her fluids </br>  <br>Rejection didn't really help him grow though. Just because he was going through some major growing pains before doesn't mean he wasn't still completely stunted by all the rejections.</br>    Couldn't say thanks for the Irohasu thread in time. <br>But yeah, thanks, brothers.<br><br><br><br>Stop it you, I can't do it right now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not getting what you want gives people a backbone, there's a reason why spoiled brats exist. Although she doesn't seem like a spoiled brat in terms of physical needs, she isn't well versed in relationships. Might also pass the genuine lesson from Hiratsuka where being in a relationship with someone means you're ready to hurt/get hurt. There's a lot of things that can only be realized through rejection.<br><br>But then again I'm not saying that I don't want Yukino to end up with 8man, I just want both of them to grow which is exactly what the major premise of the story. I would be really happy if all the little things the novel showed be brought up again such as <br> the picture she bought from the Christmas trip show up again in their living room once 8man and her settle down and have a family  <br> having 8man's third question result in not being friends but lovers.  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei and 8man would be head over heels for him. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino's final form becomes like sensei <br> Drinks <br> Smokes <br> Ancient anime references <br> Punches <br>Do you really want this?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that's not what 8man found alluring in sensei.</br>  <br>She probably can't handle drinks and with her condition smoking is the worst she can do.<br>She does tend to go on rants about the things she likes but not as intense as Hiratsuka does.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but that's the point.</br>  <br>Was it really necessary to continue these threads under a trick like that? Let's just let them die. It's time to move on to new series and new discussions. Really now at this point there's nothing left to discuss about the series. At least the Irohafags are honest about only wanting to waifu worship.</br>  <br>This will happen if 8man rejects Yukino, what will make her realize she is actually Sensei from the past, then they'll battle it out to see who is the real Yukino</br>  <br>We have important things to talk about such as...<br><br>How would Yukino initiate sex? Would she bluntly state her need to have children or would she beat around the bush (like she often does) and imply it only to shyly reject the idea once 8man catches on?<br><br>This is important information dammit!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious how she'll act by the end of the series.</br>  <br>Is that before or after she goes super Yukinon when Hachiman dies?</br>  <br>She would keep teasing him until he's unable to resist. She wouldn't be the first to initiate early on in the relationship.</br>  <br>I think it'll be 90% hormones when she does it, but it'll start with her working a jab at 8man's sexual prowess into her banter and escalate to a "yeah, well prove it" moment when she gets right in 8man's face. Then finally realizes what the hell she's doing and that she really, really wants to pin him down and take a ride on the 8 inches, and from there it's just a matter of who caves first.<br><br>I'm wondering how Yui would work it now too. I think the shy hint-dropping would be more up her alley, though I can see her just showing up in the bedroom in new lingerie and letting nature take its course too.</br></br></br>  Rank the following Yaharis by order of intelligence (currently in random order): Yukino, Yui, Iroha, Hachiman, Saki, Komachi, Sensei, Yumiko, Cunt, Tobe, Zaimokuza, Saika  <br>I'm also quite curious about what their family interactions would be like<br><br> The hikigaya family goes to the beach <br> 8man unconsciously stares at girls <br> "Hachiman, what are you looking at?" <br> "N-nothing really" <br> "Is that so? Hey, have you heard? There were news yesterday that a wife killed her husband" <br>"R-really? why?"<br>"She had believed he had been cheating on him, shows that people shouldn't underestimate a woman's jealousy huh.."<br>"I-I suppose.."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn. I'll give you Yukino-fags credit. Y'all have great imagination</br></br></br>  <br>Excuse the filthy site I got the image from.

Yui<br>  + She is the only known girl in the series that is canonically a virgin <br>  + She only has eyes for her one true love and when other guys try to approach her she turns them down without a second thought <br>  + She is fill with love and although she might call her loved one gross or creepy, she would do anything in bed to make her significant other happy <br><br>2. Saki<br>  + family oriented girl <br>  + Ignored the cunt’s advances on her and protected her dignity as a pure girl  <br>  + she will not cheat on you because of how domesticated she is <br>  - Who the fuck is Yuu???  <br><br>3. Iroha<br>  + She wants something genuine and is working towards attaining it <br>  + Once she sets her sights on her true love, she does everything to obtain him <br>  + sly, yet genuine to her true love  <br>  +/- She hangs around random boys (although that might change now that she wants something genuine) <br>  - She used to like the cunt (even if it was a superficial) <br><br>4. Yukino<br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br><br>Komachi, Rumi, and sensei are not included because we do not sexualize best imoutos, loli idols, or Christmas cakes<br><br> What about Orimito? <br>She doesn’t belong in this ranking because Brorimoto is just as her nickname implies, the biggest bro; she will be 8man’s best wingwoman. She will tell her cute friends all about her adventures with the new, cool, and hilarious 8man.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is cunt ranked so highly?</br>  <br>Not him but he's perceptive as fuck</br>  <br>Not only is he book smart but he can also apply that intelligence in the real world. We have also seen that he is as attentive if not more attentive that 8man, which demonstrates how he is able to read behind people's intentions.</br>  Rather just let the thread die now and wait for TL.  <br>I remind  Spyro. </br>  <br>Yuckyno a shit.</br>  <br>You mean a cute.</br>  <br>You mean Yukino a best. Don't make Spyro cut you, shitposter.</br>  <br><br>No, I meant Yuckyno a shit. A SHIT.</br></br>  <br>I remind them.</br>  <br>All I see is cute.</br>  <br><br><br><br>You're 3 hours too late to start this. Unkindly fuck off with your spam.</br></br></br></br>  Delete meme threads  <br>That picture is horrible, it's so uncharacteristic of her. Komachi would be a better fit.</br>  <br>Fuck off cuckinofag</br>  Ignore it, you guys.  <br>She's channeling Kamakura.</br>  <br> Uses "cuck" after he is bored with Yucky <br>And there are Yuifags and Irohafags who dares say THK isn't the worstshitposter in Yahari threads who forces these memes of his.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the only competition THK ever had was KONOKON and I haven't seen his ESLfaggotry in ages so no, nobody says THK isn't the worst single poster here.</br>  <br>Both cuck and yuck are fitting for Yukinoshitters though.</br>   4h <br> 86 / 34 / 22 <br>Is this a new low?</br></br>   You'll never be Pan-san for Yukino <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>   That THK-forcing Yuckynofag is here <br><br>Ignore and move on.</br></br>  <br> cuck  <br>Iroha is the only one still actively going after Hayama aside from Yumiko.<br>Yukino didn't even bother to try to be friends with him again after they made up.</br></br></br>  <br> 4:1 ratio <br>average was about 5 at the peak of S2's run so not really, no.</br></br>  <br>The thing is, some of them deny what THK does.<br><br><br> Both cuck and yuck are fitting <br>Point in case of his obsession.<br> Yukinoshitters <br>And then there's this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  IR<br>O<br>HA</br></br>  <br> The thing is, some of them deny what THK does. <br>Of course, not everyone is braindead.</br></br>  <br><br>  - Has had many of her first experiences with the cunt <br>Nice first experiences that totally happened during elementary school.<br>  - Loved the cunt so much that when he rejected her she became an autistic ice bitch <br>More like didn't bother to stand up for her so she decided to do it herself by becoming better than everyone else.<br>  - She seemed experienced and nonchalant when she was talking to Yui about sex and being a virgin in their 1st meeting (implying that she wasn’t a virgin); she even looked proud and spoke with an air of superiority when she was talking about it <br>She was cold towards Yui during this part because Yui was being a slut talking about how embarrassing it is to be a virgin while Yukino says placing importance on losing it is completely stupid.<br>Even 8man comments on how Yui saying that it's for the sake of "femininity" just makes her sound like a slut. <br>  - She gave the cunt chocolates (beyond used goods) <br>She gave those exact same chocolates to Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I will remind everyone.</br>  <br>So THK got online almost an hour ago? I gotta remember this to build a schedule of his lurking hours.</br>  <br> obsession <br><br>Yuckynofags are pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br> Redirecting to your trollpasta <br>Has this ever work? It's so full of bullshit and biased.</br></br>  <br>Hmm. That fag going to sleep 18-19 hours from now seems about right unless he forces himself to stay up.</br>  いろはす～  <br>So flat.</br>  <br>Flat is justice</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>someone's sad he didn't have the hugbox he wanted last thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And curves are love. 8man needs both to lead a fulfilling life.</br>  <br>So you're saying that he should pick the girl with the mixt of curves and flatness.<br><br><br>He must have missed it, we had a good time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Flat is perflat.</br>  <br> he will never pick both <br>8man why</br></br>  <br>Why would he take an inferior example of either when he can have a perfect example of each?<br><br><br>Because the world is still too full of biggotry and fear to accept a true 3P end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Iroha is already in her love triangle with Tobe and Zaimokuza, 8man doesn't have time for a slut like her</br>  <br><br>top lel, YY a shit, Iroha out does both of them by far.<br>Yui a dumb<br>Yukino a autist<br><br>Iroha is best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You could at least put forth a little effort.</br>  <br>Balance is the key, you know.<br>Picking double YY is everything but balance, with all the drama and stupidity that they bring.</br></br>  <br> flower pattern </br>  <br>You'll only get a response of the same level of effort you put in, if my response seem like blatant shitposting then it's obvious yours are as well.</br>  <br>Do you want me to feed you some replies?<br>I remember you being left alone in the Iroha thread, you poor soul.</br></br>  <br>Man, I be 8man never washed that shoulder again.</br>  <br>You sure got him anon</br>  <br>Considering that sexualizing the girls brings him PTSD it's probably the first thing he did. I think Hachiman will be fully healed once he can entertain the thought of having a girlfriend without getting triggered by his past.</br>  <br>You were the one that got pissed off weren't you<br>Nice to see that you still are</br></br>  <br>All me</br>  <br> balance <br> for a girl like Iroha <br>she's probably gonna dump 8man after she sees another alpha, she's a one night stand for him at best</br></br></br>  <br> implying Iroha wouldn't make the perfect wife when Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother and Yui would drive 8man to suicide since it's likely their chilren would get killed by a easily preventable accident since she's stupid </br>  <br>If anyone's going to drive him crazy it's Iroha and her manipulative ways.</br>  <br> Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother <br>not after muh character development<br> Yui would drive 8man to suicide since it's likely their chilren would get killed by a easily preventable accident since she's stupid <br>Yui will kill 8man through diabetes and he'll never get to father children because she's too sweet and cute<br> Iroha wouldn't make the perfect wife <br>right, then she'll be coming home later and later after meeting a publishing editor<br>sluts never change anon, let that be a life lesson to you</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino<br> Divorce after a couple months of marriage because she bitches about everything <br>Yui<br> Boring marriage (Yui too dumb) <br> 8man ends up either in the hospital trying to save the suicidal dog or child from the truck or NTR her with a coworker </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll drive him crazy from all the teasing and get him to fuck her rough.<br><br><br>Yukino wll take after her bitch mother, this is a 100% guarantee<br><br>Yui is retarded and would downgrade 8man's genetic stock.<br><br> right, then she'll be coming home later and later after meeting a publishing editor <br>sluts never change anon, let that be a life lesson to you<br><br>Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yukino becomes a bitch like her mother <br> not after muh character development <br>So for you a Yukino character development is a complete change in her character? You might as well say you like her because of her japanese beauty traits</br></br></br>  <br> Nope, she also wants to be genuine and will be loyal to Hachiman <br>So do the other two girls, and they're the only ones we've seen putting any effort into it.</br></br>  <br>The other girls only want 8man to reach his genuine-ty, what Iroha wants is genuine for herself.<br>If anything, Yui is the biggest transgressor against genuine since she wanted to keep the status quo and I have no idea whats up with Yukino but going back to the destinyland she wants something neither 8man or Haruno have which probably alludes more to independence than something genuine.<br><br>Only Iroha and 8man share the same goal.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Still better than ending up with Iroha. She may want genuine but once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train</br></br>  <br> Still better than... <br><br>At least put some effort into defending your waifu</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> thinking 8man wouldn't like Yukino's bitchiness <br>he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional<br> the only reason they're going to divorce is because he's been accidentally fucking other girls behind her back </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was never a waifufaggot like you, it's just clear to me that unloyal girls aren't worth anyone's time</br>  <br> once she hears another guy getting emotional she'll hop off the 8man train as fast as she hopped off the Hayama train <br><br>how nice you ignored the efforts 8man is spending on Iroha. Helping her win the election, helping her organizing Chrismas event, caring bags, boxes and other things (this is important), remembering birthday etc.<br><br>Traditional and cliche course, but from other (and Iroha) perspectives it's obvious that he is hitting on her (and winning scores also).<br><br>Meanwhile Yukipasta is too busy copy other, and Yui still wet-dreaming about "someday dates"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm a Yukinofag <br>Yes, I meant that once she reaches final form she won't be bitchy anymore to 8man, it's barely a complete change in character</br></br>  You know, I think it's strange how Irohafag arguments against Yui and Yukino as relationship partners never amount to more than meme-tier nonesense like "Copypastanon" and "Yui a dumb"<br><br>It's almost as if they don't have any real ground to stand on or something.</br></br>  <br>She will drive him mad, alright. Just not the way you were hoping for.</br>  <br> he literally said he liked her bitchiness because it was refreshing and not superficial bullshit, if you think he's going to divorce her because of that you're delusional <br>It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? That's the number 1 reason of a divorce<br><br><br>Oh okay, so you are just a shitposter/hater</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> efforts 8man spending on Iroha <br>so the next guy who sees a cute girl and flirts with her she'll fall for? <br> boxes and other things (this is important) <br>you're saying that a for a girl like Iroha, a guy helping her out will win her heart too. If you don't think that's sluttiness then your waifu goggles are on too tight.<br><br>At least the other girls won't whore themselves out, loyalty is miles better than being a slut.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dragging out that poorly written copypasta again?<br><br>I mean the concept is amusing sure, but it's worse than that time I tried to actually read 50 Shades of Grey.</br></br></br>  <br> if he isn't a cancerous waifufaggot he's a shitposter/hater <br>You believe whatever you want, friend.</br></br>  <br>Let it flow.</br>  <br>The truth my dear friend, is that Yuifags and Yukinofags have nothing going on for their generic waifus which leads them to lash against each others and other girls</br>  <br> But hearing the bitching 24/7 after being married? <br>Did you even read the fucking LN? 8man was never tired of her banter. Sure he complained about it but he legitimately enjoys his interaction with her. You have literally no basis for the argument of that he'll leave her if he's bitchy.</br></br>  <br> Implying you aren't a shitposter <br>It's like you don't even read what you post</br></br>  <br>I'm still not hearing any arguments. I'm gonna assume you ran out of them.</br>  This fucking thread.  <br>Why are Yukinofags and Yuifags such slutloving fucks?<br>Give me a proper post and you'll receive a proper reply.</br></br>  yukino with cat ears is too much  <br>Yes, I read the LN. And if your reading comprehension wasn't this low, you would realize I said<br> It's refreshing when you only hear them for 1 hour a day in the club room. <br><br>They don't spend all the day together and banter, they just do it when classes are over and they are in the clubroom. Another different story is when you live 24/7 with someone with whom your only interaction is just insults</br></br></br></br>  <br>Before asking for arguments, present yours instead of this low quality bait</br>  <br>The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse.<br>And I was just judging the girls based on how I saw them, if you that triggers you I don't give a fuck</br></br>  <br> I can't present any arguments so I'll just call the other girls sluts based on no actual fact <br>Nice one</br></br>  Just posting the best girl  <br>Yukino offers 8man an intellectual equal and a mental sparring partner to keep him on his toes.<br><br>Yui provides him with emotional support and validation that he's sorely in need of along with gentle pushes to become a progressively better person.<br><br>Iroha is cute, manipulative, and claims she wants something genuine.<br><br>And last but not least, 8man actually cares about his relationships with Yukino and Yui.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yui is dumb and wouldn't be able to hold a stimulating conversation with 8man. <br><br> Yukino's feeling are not genuine, she has redistributed her feelings for hayama to 8man (being her white knight and a person she can rely on). Furthermore, she is confusing love with dependency. <br><br> Iroha is still unproven in being genuine. <br><br>That's why he should get together with Saki or just date one of Orimoto's cute friends (Orimoto will be 8man's wingwoman).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think Yukino will be 24/7 bitchy with him? You're lying if you think that every interaction with him is just her 100% insulting him.<br><br>You're also projecting too hard, just because you won't be able to take bitchiness doesn't mean 8man can't. He has taken it and given it back, you have no proof he will leave her if she acts like she does.<br><br>Not to mention if he enters a marriage with her won't he be prepared to face that? Assuming he would be dating her after high school ends, that leaves several years where he would experience it. I'm 100% sure 8man can deal with it, no matter how far you want to project yourself onto him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact that you're implying waifufaggots aren't shitposters is even worse. <br> Didn't even present an argument about not being a shitposter <br>Yes, you are a shitposter, and a very retarded one if you are saying all waifufags are shitposters</br></br></br>  <br>Are we reading the same LN?<br> Everytime they talk Yukino throws some insults to him or mocks his family name <br> 8man tries to get back at in his inner monologue but he's too beta to speak his mind <br><br>Apart from the drama dialogues and unfunny cat jokes, she has always talked to him with one-sided insults</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like you beat out Cap Cunt nowadays.</br>  The funny thing is, not once have I talked bad about the YY girls until today and I was proud of that fact.<br>Guess we should let these threads die.</br>  <br>He stopped the cuntkilling after 4 months. These threads should also stop, there's nothing to discuss and 28 IPs after 6 hours is just lame</br>  I didn't see any new Yahari figs in the Wonfes threads yesterday, I thought this series was popular!  <br> Considering that sexualizing the girls brings him PTSD <br>That's only new 8man, he has no problem sexualizing Yukino and Yui in the past.<br>Up until the camping trip he kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind.</br></br></br>  <br>You just won't stop, huh?<br><br>Fine, here's your reply, seeing as this is your second attempt this thread.</br></br></br>  <br>And yet she gets disappointed when he doesn't fight back, it's not like she insults him out of malice.<br>Rather she's pretty similar to Haruno in this regard, just like how Haruno likes etasiing and scaring Yukino, Yukino likes to tease Hachiman but she likes it when he at least bites back.</br></br>  <br> Yukino <br> Putting in any effort <br>Don't skip your meds friend, take it from a guy with ADHD.</br></br></br>  <br> girl a draw <br> boy it a call <br>Let we keep do why happening this?</br></br></br>  <br> Iroha <br> loyal <br><br> not a filthy slut who chase after two guys at the same time <br><br>Irohafags sure are delusional.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying that isn't the only reason because we love him</br>  <br> Yui is a two-timing slut chasing after 8man and cookie guy <br> Yukino is Hayama's sloppy seconds <br> Iroha is an innocent kouhai who is going after the cool senpai which is usual of cute kouhais, besides if you arent a dense MC you would know this is just a masquerade of her own, extending her slyness even further </br></br></br>    Please don't war about waifus<br>Why can't we just appreciate our 8.8/8 male model Hikigaya-kun? He's leading on three girls at the same time and is going to  reject  them all because he's just that alpha.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/oallemjcap.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>This Ikemen</br>  Hello faggots, anyone have the link of 8man and Saika doujin? No sadpanda  <br>Does Iroha still admire Hayama? Yes.<br>Does she still has a shallow crush on him? Quite likely.<br>Has a more serious interest on 8man? Yes.<br>Going after him harder and harder as time passes? Yes.<br>Does she lie about all of those? No.<br><br>Iroha is the most honest one out of the girls, both Yui and Yukino are full of shit. It's almost as if she's  genuine. <br>Besides, Iroha is precisely his type, whether you like it or not.<br>No wonder 8man has no complaints about her and is busy lusting over her, trying not to fall for it while having to deal with double YY bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “Yui’s pretty nice too, but she’s kinda air-headed, ya know?” <br><br> Oh, yeah. She was pretty air-headed. But for someone as idiotic as him to say that was pretty much the pot calling the kettle black. <br><br> “Also, it’s obvious she’s popular, so there’s lots of competition.” <br><br> … <br><br> Well, yeah, I guess <br><br> Nice girls are popular. It’s scary how unpopular and clueless guys are so attracted to them. They reeled you in hook, line and sinker. You ended up blue in the face like Grander Musashi. <br><br> That’s why I won’t get surprised I won’t tremble I won’t get taken off guard I won’t be shocked I won’t tremble I won’t get surprised. What the hell? I was trembling like a leaf. <br><br> Indifferent to my quiet sighing, Tobe went on <br><br>Meh, 8man is such a hypocrite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being genuine and having "something genuine" aren't the same thing.<br><br>8man gave an abstract definition of an idealistic relationship. Just because a person is honest with themselves doesn't mean they'll be able to understand and be understood by others.</br></br></br>  <br>If she was genuine she wouldn't use Hayama as a pretense to get with 8man and actually go after him genuinely. She's his type but he's lusted after the other girls as well. <br><br>And in the end, no matter what you say, he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning.</br></br></br>  <br>She isn't genuine, not yet at least.<br>None of the girls are genuine yet except for Miura.</br></br>  <br> And in the end, no matter what you say <br>Welp.<br> he still cares for YY much more than he cares for her, and his limited interaction with her shows it. She needs to jump through a shit ton of hoops to hope to get the feelings 8man has for YY, which is why she has literally no chance of winning <br>Is this going to become a meme?<br><br>Didn't know WW posted here, I'm sorry.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iroha is precisely his type <br>Kek<br><br>Come back when your waifu gets the beauty description like Yukino does.</br></br></br></br>  <br> miura <br> implying <br>if anything it'd be Dayone who is genuine - genuinely gives no fucks.<br>Something is hilarious? laugh at it<br>Something sounds good? preach it<br><br>She's honestly too good for 8man. Glad she isn't part of the 8bowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No wonder 8man has no complaints about her <br>Because he doesn't care about her enough to complain about her? <br>And if you think she's more genuine than the other girls then you're delusional</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha is much further from genuine than Y+Y, and there's no more damning scene than the cooking class. Almost immediately after 8man inadvertently sideswipes her with his "but I don't hate it" what does she do but run off to Hayama. She's not remotely ready to be honest with her feelings nor do we see any signs that she struggles with the fact that she should be like Y+Y are.<br><br><br> Is this going to become a meme? <br>If calling out things you hate that are blindingly evident is a meme, then yes.

If you're really so shortsighted as to think things won't change then I suggest you read/watch a few more stories to get a better understanding of how literature differs from reality.<br><br> Being genuine yourself is already a big step foward, regardless of what "something genuine" means to somebody else. <br>How would you know? Like I said just because someone is honest with themselves doesn't mean they will suddenly be understood by others or understand others.<br> 8man might not understand Iroha at all, but she sure as hell understands him. <br>I'm going to need to know why you think that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason why you waifufaggots like Iroha is because you're all self inserting and want an aggressive slutty girl to make the first move <br><br> inb4 Iroha has no emotional baggage <br><br>Relationships are all about overcoming those, what do you expect? Happily ever after?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to need to know why you think that. <br>Because she lied to him to get him to do something, which apparently means she understands him.</br></br>    <br><br>Iroha is a fox.</br></br>  <br> "Hikki, here, to thank you for that time." <br><br> And with that said, Yuigahama took something gently out from her bag. A beautiful wrapping that contained cookies was held reverently by both her hands. <br><br>It was just confirmed recently that cookie man is Hikki all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,  Totsuka is the little fox. </br>  I was better off lurking.  <br>A relationship with literally no emotional difficulties is destined to crash really hard in any story<br>8man and Iroha's relationship is no different</br></br>  <br>I am sincerely biting just becasue there is nothing else to fuel these threads: and look, it has even spawned some conversation relating to the current psyche the girls have right now. Maybe it wasn't that bad to contribute to the shitposting a little.</br>  <br>Well, they're right that she understands how 8man thinks, but that's hardly unusual. both Hayama and Haruno have a pretty good grasp of that too, as does Yukino when she's not busy building more pedestals to put him on. Yui understands him too, just on an emotional level instead of an intellectual one.<br><br>The reason Irohafags shout so much about Iroha understanding 8man is because she weaponizes it to get her date. Whether that's anything to actually be proud of is a completely different story though.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, me too. I was totally biting all those times just to makes the threads go longer. I in no way responded for any other purpose.</br>  <br>My brother in arms.<br>We are the real batmans, sacrificing our integrity for the sake of discussion.</br></br>  <br>and they call her the most genuine when she uses Hayama as a front to get closer to 8man<br><br> inb4 3rd grade hikigaya certificate <br><br>that's only because she understood his tendency of being a shut in, but let's be honest. who doesn't out of the three? that line gets way too much credit than what it actually entails.</br></br></br></br></br>  This shit is almost as bad as Haganai threads back then, almost.<br>But it's still a disaster.</br>   we were supposed to be discussing about best guy <br> instead we go back to waifu wars <br>I hope cute coffee fearing 8man will change your minds</br></br>  <br><br><br> disagrees with what is being discussed <br> can't find any arguments against them <br> resorts to posting 3D reaction images straight of funnyjunk instead of just ignoring it <br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets called out on bait <br> continues to bait <br>We get it, you really like the b2b threads</br></br></br>  <br> Sees irrefutable arguments <br> Calls it bait <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yet you keep responding and bumping the thread<br>Again, just because you disagree with it doesn't give you an excuse to shitpost</br></br>  <br> But (surprise, surprise!) this time the rice was damn good. <br><br>8man is a qt when having a crush.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he no longer batman.</br>  <br>Batman can feel emotion<br>but he still does what he as to do, like when he told Yukino do fix her shit herself</br></br>  I don't keep up with these thread so sorry for asking, but has Volume 11 been completely translated yet and If so, where can I find it, since spyro only did chapter 1?  <br>Spyro's been busy with work or some shit. That or Yen Press kidnapped him.</br>  <br>Spyro is dead buddy<br>some anons translated the Iroha spoonfeeding scene, I can't spoonfeed the link to you because I didn't read it<br>they also translated the final scene which I'm too lazy to find</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, that's unfortunate, thanks for the answer.</br></br>  <br> translated the final scene <br><br>http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br></br>  Anybody got the scans of the BD special volume n ?  <br> kept trying to etch Yukino half naked figure into his mind. <br>I'm interested in Yukino's lack of reaction to this, she didn't get mad, she didn't blush, she just kind of stared back.<br>Second time he does it she doesn't pay his staring any mind.<br>Third time she just casually covers herself up.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people still think 甘すぎだな means the same thing as just 甘すぎ?  Where I can read the raws of the last chapters?  <br>We don't. And I tried talking about his final line "甘すぎだな " on the Iroha thread but there was no interest.<br> I still think he meant "too naive", and not "too sweet". </br></br>  <br>Come back when 8man actually sexualizes Yukino in a recent volume.<br><br><br>8man lied about that. He likes spoiling Komachi, just like he likes spoiling Iroha.<br><br> says Komachi takes care of him <br> yet his "big brother instinct" is always as a caretaker <br><br>8man's central conflict as a character is that he actually wants to be a good person, but he's so jaded/self-conscious that he pretends to be a lazy asshole instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What did sensei imply by this?  <br>That it's fine for them to go at it raw.</br>  <br>Surely they're too smart to try something so risky.</br>  <br>The reason the discussion died is that, as the biggest flag in the series so far, it's been shitposted the hardest. It's also pretty ambiguous.<br><br>That said the statement is too significant for it just to be talking about the chocolate. There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition.<br><br>That said, the statement itself isn't that important so much as what it's referring to. If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes, he just didn't have time to do it in volume 11 because he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner.</br>  <br>He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis but he doesn't sexualize Yukino anymore since he seems completly focused on her beauty instead to think of anything like that.</br>  <br>What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? I ask you to reconsider this, my man, for this type of thinking is what lead to British men avoiding helping young children in distress in fear of being accused of being a paedo.<br><br>If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure 8man will probably sexualize Yukino and Yui in the interlude volumes <br>My dad works for Yen Press.<br><br> he was too focused on his actual relationships with them to worry about something as minor as his boner. <br>The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I was using the term in a more generalized sense to include those.<br><br><br> The irony here is that you're calling their relationship platonic. <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>nigga you can't actually be that dumb.<br><br> Holy shit i got a number captcha.

If it's referring to the rejection then the story is basically asking you to re-examine the rejection, as 8man is retroactively assigning significance to the scene from the beginning. To begin with, the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That's pretty much what I stated on that thread. He had no reason to just walk up to Iroha and praise her while she's doing her thing.<br><br>Even less reasons to say "too sweet" in the end if he's just done licking the remaining choco and when he loves sweet tasting stuff.<br> There is an argument to be made that the word 甘すぎ was never used in the chocolate discussion (嫌い was used instead) as well, so he probably is actually referring to her earlier rejection, thus making "naive" the correct definition. <br>I like this. Iroha herself asked him if he disliked the sweetness, but we know that she wasn't talking about the damned choco taste.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the fact that he went out of his way to talk to Iroha and compliment her cooking was really suspicious. <br>That was 100% onii-chan instincts. Everything else not so much, but his initial approach was very obviously just him playing the kind older brother.</br></br>  <br> What, a senpai looking after his imouto-tier kouhai is suspicious now? <br>You're ignoring this senpai is 8man, who avoids social interactions like the plague and vehemently denies any kind of positive relationship with Iroha whatsoever.<br><br>You're also ignoring the additional connotations to the compliment he went in with ("You're amazing") which Watari specifically created within the story.<br><br>Iroha immediately rejected him for a reason you know.<br><br> If you analyze it deeper I'm sure that Iroha and 8man interactions could literally happen with Komachi the same, and therefore remains entirely platonic. <br>If it were Komachi he'd say "I love you".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll keep sexualizing Yui because of her Yuis <br><br>I don't think so. Most of time 8man just bothered by her Yuis than sexualizing her because he knew how dangerous it is to him(possible make him out of control) and tries his best to avoid it.<br><br>Just like in this scene. <br><br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he only avoids them because he has been alone, Iroha is something different than just an acquaintance, she's like a second little sister to him -- and 8man is deep down is an amiable man whom if close to will definitely respond with some warmth as he does with double YY.</br>  <br>This general has deprived the ability for me to distinguish whether this is satire or not</br>  <br>That's because you've finally realized that there's legitimate arguments to be made for practically any argument about a character or relationship due to how consistently unclear or ambiguous the author is.</br>  <br>There is literally nothing in this<br> Isshiki pulled Yuigahama down and forced her body forward. The added effect of her body leaning forward emphasized her chest and the flickering glimpses of her skin from behind her flapping collars. In keeping my gaze from instinctively latching onto that view, I forcibly turned it away. I won’t lose! Humans won’t lose to things like desires! <br>That's not sexualized.  What the fuck dude, really? <br>You're blaming WW for being ambiguous even though you are literally retarded to not think that it's not sexualization</br></br></br></br>  <br>That means he still thinks of her Yuis as sexual and fears them as such.<br><br>This is what looking at someone's chest non-sexually looks like.<br> Stop it! Don’t squish Yukinon anymore! She already has to deal with the blowing wind that runs across the open fields of Kanto, namely, her chest! If you’re going to keep pressing her together like that, at least do it in an upwards-like manner! </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure you believe in your opinions very strongly.<br><br>I however choose to understand that there are many different perspectives to be had on any topic and that any one of them could be correct.<br><br>There are times when you can analyze something further to gain a better understanding of it but in cases like this the knowledge gained is all but entirely irrelevant so it's simply not worth it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> legitimate arguments <br> posts 8man sexualizing Yui and say it's not him sexualizing Yui </br></br>  <br>Let's say that they are, Iroha still recognized it as 8man making a pass at her, and it was still significant enough that 8man was thinking about his rejection after the encounter. <br><br>Maybe now that Iroha is aware that 8man has an imouto he dotes on, she drew the connection between that and how he treats her. So when he compliments her, he calls them "sweet nothings", IE she recognizes that 8man's being non-genuine by being affectionate to her like an imouto, and she's telling him that she sees through it.<br><br>Here 8man fails to tsukkomi her rejection for the first time, and just sighs, and she shoves the spoon in his mouth. Maybe she thought he felt the rejection and did it to give him a pat on the back.<br><br>Then there's the chocolate conversation which is significant but I still am not really sure what she's referring to. If anything now it's even more unclear because she could be confirming 8man's feelings toward her, or she could be asking 8man to confirm his feelings toward her. It's really hard to say.<br><br>In any case the scene actually draws a huge parallel between 8man and Iroha, because it turns the tables and says that 8man's (intentionally or not) flirting with Iroha with Komachi as a pretense, whereas the usual interpretation is that Iroha flirts with 8man with Hayama as a pretense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant<br>That doesn't mean you should even remotely entertain retards like this </br></br>  <br> Romantic relationships are entirely defined by sexual arousal <br>Sexual desires are precisely what sets apart platonic and romantic love.</br></br>  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br>Interesting. What is your reasoning behind this statement.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand. Why did they make eye contact after sensei said that?</br>  <br>And yet there is still so much more to them than just sexual desire. It's almost as if romantic relationships aren't defined solely by that one factor.</br>  <br>They considered for a moment what they would do if they didn't have to fear the repercussions of their actions.<br><br>Really though it's probably just to reaffirm that they understood that sensei was talking about the service club's problems.</br></br></br>  IROHA OR DEATH !  <br> Literally all knowledge is useless and irrelevant <br> this i know btw </br></br>  <br> Iroha accuses 8man of being "sly" on multiple occasions <br><br> Iroha learns 8man has an imouto <br> immediately suspects he's a siscon <br> later gets 8man to declare being a siscon <br> this shows Iroha understands the nature behind how he treats her <br><br> 8man nonchalantly walks up to Iroha and calls her amazing for being able to cook <br> Iroha rejects 8man and calls his compliment "sweet nothings" -- In other words, Iroha rejects 8man for being non-genuine. <br> 8man sighs <br> Iroha shoves the spoon in his mouth to get his attention <br> Asks him if he likes sweetness <br> Asks him if he likes her sweetness/the kind in their relationship <br> 8man answers favorably to both <br> "Thanks for the reference" then immediately drops the conversation to talk to Hayama <br><br>I think I finally understand what happened there. Iroha called 8man out on being non-genuine, then makes him confirm his feelings, then gives him a taste of his own medicine (by pretending their flirting was a reference for Hayama) to show him how he's being "sly" to her.<br><br>Basically the conversation was Iroha saying that she's interested in 8man, but he needs to get his act together first. This is also consistent with how she encouraged him to be a publishing editor in 10.5. She likes him but doesn't want to enable a manchild. 8man's "甘すぎだな" shows that he was contemplating the exchange that took place, showing that she managed to get through to him at least on some level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not up for a philosophical debate<br>I'm just here to shitpost like everyone else</br></br></br>  <br>You wouldn't try to communicate such ideas unless you wanted them heard.</br>  <br>Scene was different in the LN.<br> “I see, then let me scold you properly.

But wait, that’s actually my goal all along… <br> While I was restless about various things, Yukinoshita looked perfectly calm. <br> “I don’t mind since I’ve never been scolded before.” <br> “Yukinoshita, being scolded isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It just means that someone’s looking out for you.” <br> Yukinoshita’s shoulders dropped slightly from Ms. Shiratsuka’s words. She lowered her head and looked downwards. I hadn’t the slightest idea if something had caught her eyes or not. <br> Ms. Hiratsuka gently patted Yukinoshita’s shoulder. <br> “I’m looking over you, so don’t worry and make all the blunders you want.” <br> We got off the taxi that drove us back and Ms. Hiratsuka began walking in the opposite direction of the hotel. <br> “I’m going to go buy some sake for a good drinking session. See you. Be careful on your way back.” <br> Is that really okay? <br> Ms. Hiratsuka waved her hands and we responded in the same fashion. Yukinoshita and I began walking towards the inn. We were both silent but I felt this was completely natural for the both of us. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yahari Ore no OVERANALYSIS Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru  <br>Yahari is the Monogatari of this generation.</br>  <br>The people that had no idea what happened in this show left ages ago so now we're stuck with faggots that analyze everything.

Why do they like talking about those things so much?” <br> W-What kind of conversation could that be… It wasn’t of any interest to me, but it felt like she’d get angry at me if I asked about it so I kept it to myself. Instead, times like this were where I should say something to ensure my well-being. <br> “Well, you should consider getting into it yourself if you’re going to get asked about it. Not a bad thing, right?” <br> “You talk like it has nothing to do with you. In the first place, during the Culture Festival, you…” <br> The stare that looked down on me turned into a sharp glare that pierced at me halfway through. <br> “M-Me…? No, wait. I’m not at fault here.” <br> I hadn’t a clue what she was referring to, but for now, I made sure to be insistent about it. When I did, Yukinoshita pressed against her temples and closed her eyes. She opened her mouth in resignation. <br> “…It’s nothing.

I literally can't into serious relationship but having someone to mess around with is pretty fun. I understand that people can fall into situations where until a certain point they can't choose between one person or the other. All those poorfag Iroha theories just sort of make me like her more, it contributes to her character in a way. I like the sweater she wears under her blazer and its long sleeves. I like the colors of her eyes and hair. I'm an absolute sucker for her VA.

It's all good if the relationship between them is good enough (I know it's rare but it still happens sometime)</br>  <br>It wasn't even subtle if you read the LN. There was even a scene when 8man having a vague promise with Yui which made his face flushed. Or a scene when 8man liked Yui's rice serving. Or a scene when Tobe talked that Yui is popular made 8man restless. Or a scene when 8man felt being pulled in when Yui indirectly asked him to take her out.<br><br> And yes, it was all in a single vol which has been butchered to death in anime adaptation. </br></br></br>  Hey look at that! The threads are dying, maybe we're finally free!  I want 8man to actually kill that fucking cunt  <br>And you had to remind him</br>  <br> Iroha is the female 8man <br>Nice try Irohafag but the true female 8man is RumiRumi</br></br>  <br>Fuck, I wish Rumi was real, I will never get to experience that loli ass</br>    <br>She has a pretty decent amount of similarities with 8man, and in particular has a lot of parallels with him, but 8man shares a fair number of traits with Komachi as well so it's no surprise.</br>  We used to have 90-110 people per thread, now we're sub 70.<br><br>How long will the few of us that keep these threads alive remain interested?

This means it's safe from being axed right?</br></br>  <br>Is there a way to see all the votings they did until now? I am a sucker for rankings but I doubt I can navigate 2ch.</br>  <br>There's been series that started off strong and then get canned later on because popularity took a nose dive.</br>  <br>Yeah, I know. I really want someone to translate it, it looks fun.<br>A lot of people in the Shokugeki threads wanted to read it after that special chapter.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully that doesn't happen this time.</br>  <br>Ever since it been ranked it got 2 color pages &amp; ranked 4th, 5th, &amp; 2nd. I think it safe to say that it's doing well but it may still be too early. We have to wait to see how it first volume sells to see if this end up like BnHA or if it end up like Hinomaru Zumo. I'm optimistic that it will succeed since there other series on the chopping block even if it popularity drag a bit.</br>   PSI Saiki still ranking this high <br><br>How I dont understand</br></br>  <br> Westerns don't find Japanese puns funny <br> Japanese find Japanese puns funny <br>It's really not that hard to figure out</br></br></br>  <br>It's from the author of Molester Man, right?<br><br>I guess I'll pick it up.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's from the same author.<br>This manga is pretty cute, I'm really liking it.</br></br>  <br>Shit hit the fan last chapter<br>I wonder if Watari will find it in her to dance</br></br>  GUYS.

It's in this week's issue of Jump itself: http://www.vizmanga.com/reader/3438<wbr>-weekly-shonen-jump-184</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>its def not from molester man.<br>you might be thinking of the Doujinshi "Onani Master Kurosawa" which is what he is known for</br></br></br>  <br>try http://shonenjump.07-27-weekly-shon<wbr>en-jump-survey-for-all.sgizmo.com/s<wbr>3/<br><br>Or go to http://shonenjump.viz.com/ then to Community &gt; Survey. Put your age and there's is the poll, the 4th question is the BnHA poll</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Thank god. I was so scared it would get canned, but it looks like it'll keep gong through the end of the year at this rate. Feels good man.</br>  <br>Molester Man and OMK are from the same author.</br>  <br>molester too</br>  <br>How low the mighty have fallen. <br><br>I remember when Jump actually had good manga series.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>there, thanks!<br><br>there goes my vote for  Stain .</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cry more.</br>  <br>Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>Like?</br>  <br> I just did the survey twice without clearing my cookies or even changing the IP. <br><br> It's not protected. <br><br> have fun fucking with the japs so we stop having nice things. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>boring<br>o<br>r<br>i<br>n<br>g</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just a separate western poll like the Nisekoi one</br>  <br>HxH<br>JoJo<br>Slam Dunk</br></br></br>  <br>hope this don't go like those inazuma polls where the ugliest secondary character won just to butthurt the fujos.<br><br> implying nips will give a fuck and use those votes for something other than laugh. </br></br></br>  <br>Nisekoi had two? Hmm</br>  <br> &gt;JoJo and Slam Dunk <br> better than Black Clover and Boku no Hero Academia. <br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br>Once again, cry more.</br>  <br>Oh these type of polls, they did the same thing with Nisekoi ranking the best girl. <br><br>If I'm correct viz poll and japan wsj polls don't correlate with each other. I definitely remember Onedere getting first in WSJ but for Viz Chitoge got 1st place. These polls will be separated.</br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87<br><br>last one just died, let's go kids.</br></br>  <br> It was never explicitly mentioned <br>Yea but when you are so obsessed by a man that you absorb his flesh with pleasure and rewrite the entire universe for him you gotta be a bit gay</br></br>  <br>Most of the duos that attacked the group were bros</br>  <br>Why does Giorno remind me of the Disturbia twink in that picture?</br>  <br>He didn't do it for Dio though.
