[ Anime needs more alien chicks.  Season 2 when?  <br>I don't think it will be for a while.</br>  <br>B-But I want it now.</br>  <br><br><br>alien chicks as in human girls with odd skin tones and hair colors?<br><br>The deep end has barely been touched!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blueberries are best</br>   Take a human <br> Paint his/her skin with an unusual colour  <br> It's totally an alien </br></br>    <br><br> posting a cumdump </br></br>  <br>That's an odd way of spelling 'Best Girl' anon</br>  Original &gt; 2199<br><br> 2199 better girls though </br></br>  <br>It just works.</br>  I liked how the recent movie decided to explain why the various races looked so human-like.  <br> Original &gt; 2199 </br>  <br> Original &gt; 2199 <br><br>Glad you agree, my nakama</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really agree.<br><br>I love the original, and for its time it was amazing. <br><br>But it hasn't aged particularly well, and it had a lot of really, really bad 70s sci-fi built in right out of Star Trek's rejected episodes. The Gamilans were also paper cutouts aside from Desler.<br><br>2199 on the other hand basically takes the best parts of the original and extrapolates on them, creating better characters (on the whole, and massively so on the Gamilan side) while moderating the Yamato's ridiculous OPness and creating a more complex plot that really works with some incredible set pieces. It also added in its own sci-fi spin episodes, which were just fantastic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The Gamilans were also paper cutouts aside from Desler. <br><br>Don't forget Domel.<br><br>In 2199 all Gamilans are paper cutouts, including Dessler.<br><br> 2199 on the other hand basically takes the best parts of the original and extrapolates on them <br><br>no.<br><br> creating better characters <br><br>I disagree, it actually stretches the cast thin and makes them even more shallow by doing so.<br><br> a more complex plot <br><br>The plot is 1:1 except they shoehorned in subplots from Yamato S2/movies/S3.<br>I'm glad 2199 is doing well because I love the girls, but the original will always be better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I was so mad they didn't include this in 2199.      <br>They did it so much better than Ridley.</br>  <br>This fanart is too cute anon.</br>     chocolate super pilot born on Mars <br> lose to plain Earthling girl <br><br>Dreams and hopes gone</br></br></br>  Alien chicks?  <br>Thank you. I was about to be disappointed in this thread.</br>  <br> Don't forget Domel. <br><br>Original Domel was extremely paper cutout and basically just Desler's thug<br><br>The other Gamilans are hardly so in 2199. Folken, Melda, and Cellestela were all pretty well done and strong characters<br><br> no <br><br>Yes<br><br><br> I disagree, it actually stretches the cast thin and makes them even more shallow by doing so. <br>In the case of the Human side characters, yes. Aside from Yuki and Kodai, they suffer a bit, but not that much and are pretty close. Most of the important ones still fare pretty well as characters (Sanada, Niimi, Shima etc).<br><br> The plot is 1:1 except they shoehorned in subplots from Yamato S2/movies/S3. <br>That and generally enriching the setting thanks to the Gamilan/world development. It's 1:1 as far as what happens in the big picture, but the mechanics and details are all much more fleshed out because, let's face it, the original was kind of bare when it came to that stuff.<br><br>As much as I can appreciate the original, 2199 refined it and cut a lot of the 70s fat without losing what made it so good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Best Alium  <br> and basically just Desler's thug <br><br>He did owe his life to Dessler you know.<br><br> Folken, Melda, and Cellestela were all pretty well done and strong characters <br><br>I only remember Melda of them, and only because she's fapfuel. The others were just shallow cutouts, Domel in the original had intense devotion to his homeworld. You don't know it at the time that he was so serious in his battle because the Yamato was going STRAIGHT to their homeworld.<br><br> Aside from Yuki and Kodai <br><br>Yuki gets a bit more treatment, but Kodai really suffers badly in 2199 because of the way they cut out all his communications with the captain.<br><br> Most of the important ones still fare pretty well as characters (Sanada, Niimi, Shima etc). <br><br>Coasting on their crew-bonding from the original. They don't really bond the same way in 2199.<br><br> the original was kind of bare when it came to that stuff. <br><br>If it wasn't abundantly clear to you, this is done on purpose so they remain fucking alien. 2199 gives away the big twist early on that Iscander is beside Gamilas.<br><br> As much as I can appreciate the original, 2199 refined it and cut a lot of the 70s fat without losing what made it so good. <br><br>Disagree, 2199 bloats it with too many unnecessary subplots that it borrows from S2 &amp; 3 of Yamato. It had far too few episodes with what it wanted to do. Even the DEFINITIVE Domel showdown had focus split on a Yuki subplot.<br><br>poor move.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's good but her daughter is better.<br><br>No, not the pink haired one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2199 on the other hand basically takes the best parts of the original and extrapolates on them, creating better characters (on the whole, and massively so on the Gamilan side) while moderating the Yamato's ridiculous OPness and creating a more complex plot that really works with some incredible set pieces. It also added in its own sci-fi spin episodes, which were just fantastic. <br>Spoken like a true secondary</br></br>  <br>He was a fanatic, yes, but that doesn't make him complex. I'd say that 2199 did a better job with him.<br><br> I only remember Melda of them, and only because she's fapfuel. <br>I could understand (but only kind of) forgetting Cellestra or the toss in Wakamoto, but if you forgot Folken I don't really know what to tell you.<br><br>Kodai is developed well enough in 2199, he's just developed differently from the original. I would probably agree that the original Kodai is superior, but 2199's is well enough.<br><br> Coasting on their crew-bonding from the original. They don't really bond the same way in 2199. <br>Seemed pretty equal to me, really. <br><br> So they remain fucking alien <br>Which has its virtue, but considering that 2199 is a remake that trick won't work twice. They had to develop the Gamilans, and they did a good job of it considering how blank slate they were aside from Desler and (but only kind of) Domel. <br><br>On the last point we've basically reached the My Opinion &gt; Your Opinion stage so yeah, might as well just go back to posting blue girls.<br><br><br> Secondaries guy arrives to commence his shitposting <br><br>Ah fuck, and it was such a nice thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2199 on the other hand basically takes the best parts of the original and extrapolates on them, creating better characters  <br><br>Top fucking kek. The new characters in 2199 are terrible and they turn Dessler into a fucking cuckhold.</br></br></br>  <br> creating better characters <br>Nimi, Akira and the other female characters are terrible and just waifu bait, Kodai is shittier in 2199 as well as Analyzer, Sanada and Dessler. This is how easy it is to spot a secondary whi has never watched the original say people who say The Origin is better than 0079.</br></br>  <br>Cut it out</br>   Space Waifushit Yamato Secondary Edition  <br><br>Every fucking thread</br></br>  <br> He was a fanatic, yes, but that doesn't make him complex. <br><br>He wasn't a fanatic, what are you even on about?<br><br> but if you forgot Folken I don't really know what to tell you. <br><br>Was he perhaps the submarine captain or something? Pretty forgettable.<br><br> I would probably agree that the original Kodai is superior, but 2199's is well enough. <br><br>The unfortunate thing about being a remake that isn't TOO wildly different (roughly following the same course, ROUGHLY) is that the comparison between what was and what it is now only makes the lesser elements seem all the more weak. This extends to the girls, 2199 has excellent girls and God Bless XEBEC for this, it blows the original out of the water in this regard but the original gets a landslide victory for practically everything else.<br><br> Seemed pretty equal to me, really.  <br><br>No, it really wasn't close. Original didn't have to juggle all the new female characters so ample time was given just having them joke about on the bridge or talk shit.<br><br> On the last point we've basically reached the My Opinion &gt; Your Opinion stage so yeah <br><br>I agree with posting blue girls always, but I'm objectively correct here. It's clear as day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Sanada <br><br>Oh my god this guy was such an unrelenting badass in the original. How did he and Analyzer even get away with it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I agree with posting blue girls always, but I'm objectively correct here. It's clear as day. <br><br>I disagree, but now that the shitposter has arrived it's not really worth the time to hold an argument any more.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly Analyzer doesn't even need to be in the remake since they stripped him of what made his character fun in the original and his own subplot about falling in love with Yuki.</br>  <br>He hardly was anyways.<br><br>His episode with the Gamiloid is gold, however.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I disagree, but now that the shitposter has arrived it's not really worth the time to hold an argument any more. <br><br>No fuck you I want to talk about how old Dessler was the best thing ever, how Sanada was the coolest guy ever and how Shima was actually a character.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br> Maetel <br><br>She's absolutely batshit insane, step away. Nobody is this insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br><br>The best thing about Analyzer was all the funny little bits they had him doing in the background. In one episode when everybody is taking their breaks and relaxing you see him out fucking suntanning<br><br><br><br>Doesn't this have BDs now?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's killed billions over the most inane reasons possible.</br></br>  <br>At least Sanada got a few good moments in 2199. <br><br>The guy was OP as fuck in the original since he was basically Spock with balls of steel</br></br></br>     [HorribleSubs] Tesagure!

Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>Come on guys, keep it to one, no wait, three(?) threads.</br>  <br>Hellow.</br>  RIP /yahari/ BTB threads  So how did Irohafags react when Iroha gets rejected?  <br> So how did Irohafags react when Iroha gets rejected? <br> He doesn't know </br></br>  <br><br>I've been avoiding yahari threads since spoilers came out. I'm still digging through the archives.</br></br>  <br>Sometimes, people post stuff beyond adaptation point directly in thread. That's the risk in /a/. Judging from those spoiler they put, we can pray for good selling that will lead to 3rd season. I'm aware as someone who doesn't contribute to selling I have to right to speak about it though.</br>  Oregairu is relentless, Anon. When I first read about Iroha, months ago, I did not fathom the true power of knowledge. To know the best girl. To see her charm and grace tracing out into the infinite. As a man, I could never have contained such forbidden truths, but each of us is so much more than we once were. Do you not feel with all your soul how Irohafags have become like gods? As such, are we not indivisible? As long as a single one of us stands, we are legion. Our futures are predestined. Watari foretold mine months ago, we each play out the parts he has written for us. Free will is an illusion.  <br>When will secondaries learn</br>  Best subs for S2?  <br>How did it all begin again?</br>  I've made a pastebin for links to all of the interesting Iroha videos out there on Nico<br>for those that don't know how to use jap Nico or don't bother.<br>http://pastebin.com/meEsfDWW (HTTP)<br>Irohasu~</br></br></br>  <br>It is impossible to grasp that answer now, From deep within the flow of time</br>  <br>Personally FFF but yahari. This one is not their priority.<br>HS for Japanese lover<br>Commie if you don't want your brain to remind you this is something that occurs in Japan.<br>Don't bother with song's subtitle, they don't change the op/ed. FFF's old stuff can be used as refference.<br>These are just my opinion, I swear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>chata?</br>  <br><br>Commie is objectively the best, really. Most natural sounding dialogue.</br></br>  This was a fitting end to an insightful and emotionally rich series. SNAFU's second season has risen above all the faults of the first to emerge as a piercing, evocative exploration of not just adolescent identity, but trust and identity in general. I'm sad to see it go, yet somehow feel encouraged by how far these lovably unlovable characters have come.  If only threesome was their genuine answer.  <br>Thank you Irohabro.</br>  <br>If I bite at you directly</br>  <br>You've read about the penguins. Threesome can't happen nor is it genuine.</br>  So, I guess this is how you sort the LNfags from the anime-onlyfags?  <br>I thought Shirou was an egoistic, dense man. After think about it, &gt;=3some are win-win. Male want to make female happy, females want to stay with male.<br> but female gave her all while male only give 1/x due to sharing <br>That problem mostly occur for girls. Women are less susceptible to it. They are more understanding.</br></br></br>  <br>IROHA AKBAAAAAAR</br>  <br>jesus that was almost as poetic as the story of the service club</br>  <br>Good thing they're higher-order lifeforms and aren't bound by purely instinctual behaviors.</br>  <br>This end was just bait to get you to buy volume 12.</br>  <br>I just don't like people bringing 2ch interpretation of sweet cookies and over discussing it into making me think it has deeper meaning.</br>  <br>Confirmed side character. She has no place in the overall plot for the service club to find genuineness.</br>  What is her face trying to covey?  <br>It bite him back now. Will the ride end?</br>  <br>The only reason she found out about genuine, is because she was listening in on them. Hachiman's "wanting something genuine" request wasn't even directed at her.</br>  So did Yui offer friendship end and 8man shit all over it?  <br>If Yui doesn't win the 8bowl I wonder how Yuimom will react when she realize Yui hasn't talked about Hachiman in a while.<br><br>I kinda want Yuimom to become overprotective and tell Hachiman that he is turning down a good girl and to look at her (her being Yuimom) at what he is missing out on and he lucked out.</br></br></br>  <br>I tried anonsub for episode 11. It horrifies my how much thing HS cut from their release. I'm just hoping anon/FFF will take stand to sub final.<br><br><br>Also summer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She offered to end the love triangle, by taking him and making Yukinoshita just stay as friends. Yukinoshita almost accepts, 8man stopped her. Next volume they'll have to make up their minds or Yui will proceed.<br><br> Two volumes from now since WW releases 11.5 first. </br></br></br>  COMMIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE-   that ending <br> that cliffhanger <br> tfw you don't understand what the fuck is happening until you read anon's analysis on it </br></br>  So how is it genuine that Hachiman lets the girls decide who wants his dick? I mean he's not oblivious to what's going on right? Isn't not picking one girl the issue here?  <br>I came here to post this.</br>  <br>It's not that she wanted to take him, it's that she basically confessed her feelings by giving him the chocolate and have Yukino confess her feelings to, then have 8man choose. <br><br>But that wasn't the genuine thing to do</br></br></br>  <br> not putting a joker face over popularfag <br><br>Can you at least mean thoroughly if you're gonna meme</br></br></br>  https://archive.moe/a/thread/127224<wbr>860/#127227777<br><br>This thread is history</br></br></wbr>  <br> joker <br> not 2face <br><br> not putting mask on Iroha <br> not putting cat ears and tail on Yukino <br> not switching Yui for another girl </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and making Yukinoshita just stay as friends. <br>That is the only part that pissed me off, I can understand Yukino dependency issue but I would have found her choice and felt more acceptive if Yukino rejected Yui's proposal. And then Hachiman interjected with what he told them. <br><br>Fucking Watari, derailing Yukino character for the sake of drama for drama.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, 2 face. Thats what i meant.<br><br>Joker on that tobi faggot<br><br>Swap Yui for fujoshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> quads <br> history </br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  Does this convey season 2 correctly?  Someone's gonna die confirmed!  <br>Alright, I'm interested.<br><br>What's the name of the film?</br></br></br>  <br> Getting used to silence is a terrifying thing <br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, this sums it up pretty well.</br>  <br> Hachiman will commit suicide. <br><br>He is aware of how No Longer Human ends.</br></br> </br>    <br>Gooks. Its obviously garbage</br>  <br> not linking the 127222222 get </br>  I like it, it's a good series. Though it is unfair how you end it in cliffhanger and basically forces the audience to read the LN to understand the ending (I'm an LNfag btw) but overall it's a great show. It focuses on the entirety of human relationship and how we deal with it to achieve the genuine part of it all. This episode leaves a lot think:<br>-Yukino's pussy-ness is thoroughly blasted in this. I don't know if it's because Feels condense the volume but holy shit was her copying 8man in Yui room scene was awkward.<br>-Yui being the active one. At this point Service Club knows that they are in stagnant point of their relationship. They could very well act all oblivious until Yui step up and save the day.<br>-Yui acting the villain is the highlight of the episode. For those who don;t know she basically offered to solve Yukino's problem by winning the bet and using the reward to force 8man into relationship with her and by so dictating Yukino's choice. Why is Yukino glad by this? Recall what Haruno said. Yukino is incapable of making a decision of her own. All her life what she does is copying what people do and never once takes her own wants into account.<br>-8man rejecting Yui's proposal (just as she planned) and uttering what Shizuka said to him. It brings back the main point that "If you don't suffer for it, then it can't be called genuine"<br>-Haruno being the voice of reason to remind 8man what is it he wants and to warn him of his getting too chummy with living a lie (acting as friends with Service Club)<br>-Yukino is blatantly showing her feelings toward 8man<br>-All their problems can be solved by simply having a 3sum end.<br>-Commie Batman mask (they did it again!)<br>-Yui's endgame plan may involve her sacrificing her feeling, or perhaps strive to make it friendship end for the three of them<br>-Yuimom wants to talk to Hikki~<br>-8man BTFO-ing Haruno in public is GOAT<br>-Aquarium scenes. All that budget swimming around.<br>-8man is the  Cookieman  all along</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So why did the Iroha thread get deleted?  <br>Here's the gag ending for side characters. Still interested?</br>  <br> cookies made with pure love as well as being a recurring item from the very beggining <br> mean nothing <br><br> Iroha winked at him for a fucking attosecond <br> oh my god it's true love kyaa! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that feel anon.</br>  <br>   8man is the Cookieman all along <br><br>This, really a big revelation for me. I thought it was gonna be  Cookieman </br></br></br>  <br>It has to be the girl he chooses, so with her dead he can go out with the other one.</br>  <br>Eavesdropping and copycat bitch. Saitei da.</br>  <br> Yui will never be grossed out at me with a titanitc smile on her face <br><br>Why even live.avi</br></br></br>  <br>He never read the end. Was too afraid to find out.</br>  <br> please sauce </br>  <br>Huh? I thought the end of chapter nine, volume ten, hinted that he did read it all through.</br>  The show is end. Stop making these threads so I can stop checking them  Yukino doesn't love 8man. In the beginning of the episode she didn't give him her treats and later in the episode she didn't give him her treats when Yui gave him cookies. She brought them with her but never gave them to him.  What would you do if the sea had 4D fishes?    <br>She tried to give her cookies 3 times:<br>1) In the clubroom, she was too spaghetti and couldn't give him cookies without giving Yui some first, and she didn't give 8 the bag of cookies, just her own in a dish.<br>2) At the school gate she was frozen by autism and made things awkward for everyone.<br>3) She decided not to give her bag of cookies because doing so would just be like copying Yui. It wouldn't be genuine anymore.<br>None of these things indicate that she does or doesn't love 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention 3) refers to the aquarium</br>  <br>It's to illustrate her inability to make her own decision. See <br><br>This show purpose is about relationship and how one person with a specific mindset can save someone that suffers from it. The entirety of S1 is to prepare 8man for his role. Think of S1 as the alleyway shooting of Batman's parents, with Orimoto rejecting him as the trigger.<br><br>The series ends with Yukino being able to decide what she wants. At this point it's either her standing up to Yukimom or her confessing to 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're going to be here until we're all  skeletons </br>  <br> All about my Wife. </br>  <br> All About My Wife (2012) <br>Sorry for the delay.</br></br>  <br> either <br>What if both?</br></br>  Who /sha~/ here?

It's more military vs military with the protagonists being on the side with the supernatural tech, and they didn't start the war, but otherwise it more or less fits.</br>  <br>Correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I read somewhere that the decks of those "Destroyers" currently wouldn't be able to handle the downwards blast from an F-35B.</br>  <br>Humanity getting their shit pushed in by aliens is accurate though.

It'll be shit like ancient ground aliens or giant intelligent spiders or something and we'll always lose.<br>At least in  Halo , humanity started adapting enough to fight back and win battles.</br></br>  <br>Not strictly speaking. There's nothing that really prevents them from having ships that launch fixed wing aircraft. It's just that it's argued that the said ships aren't defensive in nature which is why carriers are viewed as a violation of the constitution. <br><br>With the planned amendments and strong 'emphasis' on how that Japan needs to project airspace superiority as a defensive measure, the case for a carrier is not a pipe dream anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh huh, defeating the least competent navy ever that had to travel around Africa across two oceans doesn't exactly make you competent.</br>  <br><br>"Competent" as in the deck can be upgraded or modified in future to fit the purposes of being a carrier. Haven't you heard about their future plans to build more Izumo class destroyers for obvious reasons?</br></br>  <br>Ah, Cold War weaponry. The only time when real life actually had too much dakka. Probably why I can never believe US can ever lose to alien invasions or creatures from the ocean. Also, I see your Tsar Bomba and raise you a Project Pluto. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proje<wbr>ct_Pluto</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Even despite this, the military is often portrayed as completely incompetent.</br>  <br>The TV series was an abomination anyway.</br>  <br>You can't be this dumb</br>  <br>What about laughing at the British and the commonwealth over Malaya, Hong Kong and Singapore? I will ignore the whole invasion of the Philippines to make you feel better.</br>  <br>did you not watch Jormungand?</br>  <br>It is a shame that any plane show will be cgi now.</br>  <br>And the Japs are still mad about Khalkhin Gol. They literally lost against guys with swords riding horses with the Soviets. Imperial Japan was competent, but they had their rough points. A ton of them.</br>  <br> sound travels faster than light </br>  <br> IJN  <br> Competent </br></br>  <br>The Manchurian curbstomp by the Soviets. Yep. Japan doesn't like to think about it at all.</br>  <br><br>I see your Project Pluto and raise you Project Orion<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proje<wbr>ct_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)<br><br>It does not get any more insane than this, I'm sorry. And this was all banned under an international treaty simply for being too cool.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, British units in the region were very poorly reinforced at the time.</br>  <br>Sad that the IJN of 1905 &gt; 1940</br>  <br>Those were lightly garrisoned, thousands of miles away and we already had the Germans breathing down our necks in Europe.</br>  <br><br>Do you seriously believe humans have even a slight chance against an alien invation?</br></br>  <br>pretty much<br><br> slay dragons <br> rape elves <br> fuck bitches <br> everyone bows in fear <br> loli demon goddesses want your dick <br><br>feels good man, join the military today</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's going to be so bad, and the threads will be so good.</br>  <br>The closest thing I've seen in the old experimental videos was something boiling for a quick second before being blasted away. When they tested it on pigs, they started steaming and charring (so it seemed) before the blast wave hit them. The video was just too exaggerated. If it showed their face bubbling really quickly before vaporizing, it would've been much more accurate.<br>But that entire scene was to remind the American Devils that they're evil and should've lost the war instead.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Cat shit one.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair at that point the Japanese navy was in absolute shambles.</br>  <br>Yet they couldn't manage to have the British dominion of India, Canada and Australia/New Zealand to shoulder the brunt and fight the Japs, who weren't superbly supplied in the first place? Go ask the pathetic tale of the Winnipeg Grenadiers for an example of humiliation.</br>  <br>I'm not seeing what's so incompetent about this battle. The US has carriers and overwhelming numbers of aircraft while the IJN does not. It's almost a forgone conclusion of victory for the US side, isn't it?</br>  <br>What? Americans won but lost a ton of shit in comparison to win that battle. IJN did pretty good there</br>  <br>The bombs dropped on Japan didn't have a traditional fuse or a timer. They used a change in atmospheric pressure to trigger detonation. Little Boy and Fat Man didn't use a chute, but instead had a fin behave as an air break for stabilization purposes.<br><br>The parachute is from the following plane dumping instruments.</br></br></br>  How fucked would invading demon armies be if they attacked the military in 50 years from now when we have perfected laser tech and begin to construct gundams?  <br> Imperial Japan was competent <br>They were? Because every anime featuring Yamato seems to point out how they never used the most badass battleship ever build to do shit</br></br>  <br> What about laughing at the British and the commonwealth over Malaya, Hong Kong and Singapore? <br>I'm laughing at your knowledge of history though. Hong Kong literally wasn't defended. Malaya was defended by 2 understrength divisions + bunch of native conscripts, and it was the place where Britain dumped all the lend-lease aircraft it didn't want for home defense, mediterranean, or for giving to the Soviets. That's right, Asia was a lower priority than being a freebie to the Red Army.<br><br> the whole invasion of the Philippines <br>You should've just ignored it, since Japan can only look worse in an operation where the Japs needed 8 months to defeat a small US + Flip force that was unsupplied. But no, you had to bring it up. Good job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The detonation altitude was around 300ft <br>It was 1,800 feet, if the National Museum of the US Air Force is to be believed. <br><br>http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/fa<wbr>ctsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1026</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not using the Yamato was the only competent thing the IJN did in WW2.</br>  <br>And people are afraid of aliens from outerspace, meteorites, nibirus and so on. Fucking humans will destroy earth long before theres any danger of that..</br>  <br> But that entire scene was to remind the American Devils that they're evil and should've lost the war instead. <br>Or maybe it's supposed to portray the inhumanity of being on the receiving end of a nuclear device and the unimaginable human suffering it causes.</br></br>  <br>And then there's this. IJN has its share of being misguided with kantai kessen decisive fleet battle, but then there's shit like this as well.</br>  <br>Singapore wasn't.</br>  <br>They don't need to repel article 9, just reinterpret it like they already have. The SDF isn't an army, it's a defense force. Japan's invasion of Iraq? Collective self-defense of the US-Japan alliance. In the future when they want to invade a country that hasn't attacked yet? Preemptive peace keeping operation.</br>  <br>The bombing of Pearl Harbor was executed relatively competently (despite the fact that they picked a day when the carriers weren't in port).<br><br><br>You do realise that those are escort carriers? And they were in gun range of the Japanese cruisers and battleships.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Yamato was an impracticable ship through and through. They should've torn it down for parts.</br>  <br><br><br>Even though the SDF is well-funded and well-equipped, most soldiers aren't in it to protect something by fighting. It's quite a bit different than most other militaries actually. There are books you can read on the subject. The Japanese themselves might not be completely OK with the SDF due to paying more taxes for having a military while being a self-defense only country, but I don't think they hate it, especially since the organization intervenes at disaster zones and does work that actually matters, even though their response time has been sometimes problematic.<br>Military getting rekt against this or that unconventional enemy has nothing to do with hating the military, it's a pretty old trope (earliest example I can think of is War of the Worlds, the military wasn't completely useless but mankind would have been kill if not for martian illness) to demonstrate that said enemy is a pretty big deal.<br><br><br>So is the manga. It's a shit series overall.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those were escort carriers, which were basically slow merchant ships with a flat deck slapped on top. Their aircraft were equipped for ASW and for anti-ground missions. On a scale of 0 - 10, their threat to actual warships was a 0.</br>  <br> literally biking through Malesia to strike Singapore from land <br> brits shit their pants, enemy isn't supposed to come from land and surrender while outnumbering the japs <br><br>Singapore is just one of those gigantic derp moments of warfare.</br></br></br></br>  <br> unimaginable human suffering <br>Then where are the films depicting the Japanese involvement in Southeast Asia during the 20th century? Oh right.</br></br>  <br>They should've spent the budget on more carriers and more carrier-borne planes. You can buy another Zuikaku and her planes for the price of one Yamato. 120mil yen in late 30s was the price for the ship as I remember.</br>  <br>PRC makes them.</br>  <br>They did, It was called the Shinano.</br>  <br> such trickery <br>I see that the Jew is indeed right to fear the Samurai. <br><br><br>Yeah, some really shitty decisions made by the IJN command that day. They probably could have stormed through the blockade with minimal damage, but instead decided to run. <br><br><br>To be fair, at the start of WW2 Japan had more carriers than any other navy in the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well their armed forces are called the JSDF even though it's a fucking army.<br><br>The United States in our infinite wisdom wrote a new constitution for them saying they cant have an army, bunch of other shit. Same with Germany.<br><br>I might be wrong but I don't think they're "allowed" to have Aircraft Carriers so this kind of thing ends up happening.<br><br>We should let them be independent now, it's been over 60 years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you a butthurt chink or just a dumb american.</br>  <br> outnumbering the japs <br>Japs had 3 elite divisions each having 4 brigades. Brits had 2 divisions, each having 3 brigades. There were also malaysian militia, but they were useless.</br></br>  <br>That's not true. Both detonations occurred at ~1800 ft.<br>http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/fa<wbr>ctsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1016<br>http://www.nationalmuseum.af.mil/fa<wbr>ctsheets/factsheet.asp?id=1026</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Roast or perhaps a more accurate term would be broil. The heat is extreme but the duration of exposure is near instantaneous. This is why you can still make out silhouettes and bodies still maintain their shape somewhat.</br></br>  <br>Shinano was a last-ditch effort in trying to make something out of a steaming pile of rotting shit. They can't fit her with the guns anymore, and the navy didn't know what to do with this hull that's almost done, so they turned it into a half-assed carrier that couldn't carry more plane than the half-assed mass-produced Unryuu class.</br>  <br>CGI can be good, just watch Knights of Sidonia. Full CGI still great action. And recent episodes of fight on planet is really well made. I recently watched OVAS of Gundam Unicorn and its easely supperior to it in every way.</br>  <br>Some bore width as many tank cannons.</br>  <br>And the German army in WW2 was called the Wehrmacht, which literally means defense force. So what.<br><br> We should let them be independent now, it's been over 60 years. <br>They are, and they have been since 1952.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the IJN did horribly. A destroyer taking out a heavy cruiser?<br><br>They had 6 Heavy cruisers!</br></br></br>  <br>Well if you ignore their Constitution we forced them to accept, and the thousands of troops we have stationed in Japan,sure.</br>    <br> Cat shit one <br>There was one short OVA and thats it. It was well made i give you that.</br></br>  <br>America has thousands of troops stationed literally all over the world.<br><br>Just because there are american troops in the UK means the UK isn't independent anymore?</br></br></br>  <br>Keep it up, Jap. Barefoot Gen added so much shit to the event that it wasn't even funny.<br>There's being a survivor of the attack and reciting it, and there's adding dumb shit like radioactive zombies.</br></br>  <br>Imagine DOOM 1&amp;2 and Quake 1&amp;2 mixed together without any Doomguys/Quakemen and with enemies not designed to pose a fair challenge to the player.<br><br><br>I really love this kneejerk response. "The suffering inflicted on Japan doesn't count because they never made movies about the suffering Japan caused on others". It's pure concentrated idiocy.<br><br><br> Japan's invasion of Iraq? <br>Some invasion, where troops were forbidden from engaging the "enemy". There is a gigantic leap to take to stretch the interpretation of "Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes." to actually attacking people. Japanese troops being deployed to Iraq for peacekeeping and humanitarian work isn't outside the frame of Article 9.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese can change that Constitution if they wish, but have steadfastly refused to make such changes to it. So far at least. <br><br><br>The actions of the ISN Destroyers on that day were insane.</br></br></br></br>  <br>JP wants those US bases. The military relationship between both countries is mutually beneficial at this point.</br>  <br>They can change their constitution anytime they want, in fact there's been growing support for removing the clause regarding the SDF so that they can have a regular army. As for the troops, those are there by treaty and have no extra-territorial power, the Japanese could kick them out if they really wanted to. If you apply those conditions to Japan and say they aren't independent you might as well say the same of Germany.</br>  <br> not to mention the battleships <br><br>I'm pretty sure that the tonnage of one of those battleships was greater then the whole of taffy 3</br></br></br>  <br> nighttime naval battle <br><br>8 destoyers on torpedo runs in a night time battle, that's actually not outrageous. Not quite a mismatch like in the Battle off Samar.</br></br></br>  <br> To be fair, at the start of WW2 Japan had more carriers than any other navy in the world. <br>Japan didn't have any edge in aircraft carriers. While there was a parity of carriers on 7 Dec 1941, it was only because the Brits had lost 3 carriers due to actually being in a serious naval war for 2 years. On top of that, the Brits were building a bunch of new carriers and the US was building 18 Essex-class carriers, the first of which was due to be commissioned in 1942. Japan only had the Taiho in the pipelines.</br></br>  <br>The IJN didn't know about the true capabilities of the carriers until much later. The initial thought was that bigger ships and gun sizes was what wins naval fights. By the time they realized that way of thinking was wrong, they had lost most of their pilots and wasted away their scarce resources on everything but carriers.</br>  <br>The Yamato was among them, yeah.</br>  <br> By the time they realized that way of thinking was wrong <br><br>They never did</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much, yes. They don't call america the world police for nothing.<br><br>I mean, they followed us into Iraq and lost many of their soldiers for no reason.</br></br></br>  <br>And they lost so many of the carriers they did have in Midway.</br>  <br>BUT ANON<br>WHAT IF THEY HAVE PERFECTED LASER TECHNOLOGY?!?</br></br>  <br>then we lose</br>  <br> pic <br>Not funny!</br></br>  Since near the whole show is based about Military doing competend stuff and tactics <br><br>It also shows incompetent Admirals and their lack of will to hear their staff out<br><br>also: Sieg Kaiser</br></br></br></br>  <br> The suffering inflicted on Japan doesn't count because they never made movies about the suffering Japan caused on others <br>It's not that. If you're going to do a story on a historical event, don't bullshit it with fairy tail shit like zombies or eyeless, demon Americans just to get reactions from people. I wouldn't mind an actual recollection of a survivor of the bombs. If I got bombed by Americans, I'd hate them as well. But don't exaggerate the event just to get off on your anger.<br>Japan loves to play the victim card and stupid fucking weeaboos love to back them up.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course. It's a lot better now but look up how Germany was treated in the afterwar years. <br><br>Wu hung ip posters saying "ITS ALL YOUR FAULT" and forced people, children, to dig graves and bury bodies, but that's another story. <br><br>Point is, yes, I'd say the same about Germany.<br><br>I mean, we tap their leader's phone and she's just like "Oh its okay everyone hehe dont worry dont piss them off pls"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, they did. But at the point, the leadership had gone full retard and stopped listening to the competent people who also have been telling them that they cannot win a war against the US.</br>  <br>Broil eh? I just can't help but think about electric arc burns, the arc basically momentarily vaporises the water at the point of impact, which is rather different from heat burns. With the nuke explosion you have light, ionizing radiation and then heatwave?<br>Yes, it is rather disturbing day to visit /a/.</br></br>  <br>Germany can't kick them out because their own military is incompetent. Funding also seems to be a word that is unknown to Germans.</br>  <br>Then we shall cover our cities in smog!<br><br>http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-<wbr>from-elsewhere-26322868</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>At first. It quickly flipped with the United States building a ton. Like over 200</br>  <br>I know. I meant the mortar tube itself. I've seen plenty of 60s, those things are tiny, one guy can carry the whole thing if he's beefy.</br>  <br>What's with this bullshit hippie narrative. Every single US base around the world was built because the country asked the US to. Even with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the countries asked for the US to stay. The US is guilty of a great many things, but they were always the better option to the Soviets because they grant autonomy.</br>  <br>You mean only the JSDF is competent. And no lets not start, either.</br>  <br> But don't exaggerate the event just to get off on your anger. <br>Good thing that's not what the movie does.<br>As for the "fairy tail shit", it's a form of impressionism. The aim is not to be realistic. Japan isn't the only country to have made impressionist representations of the aftermath of the atomic bombs either, in later years.<br>Like the other anon said, the idea is to stress the horrible effects of such bombing. It's not to reflect a hate for Americans or anything of the sort.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do they really though? Why? What purpose do they serve but the US's sphere of influence?</br>  <br>Full metal panic</br>  <br> CGI can be good, just watch Knights of Sidonia <br>Ha</br></br>  The new LN releases today.<br>Let's all wait warmly for it while discussing cute yuushas</br>  it's late.

Still, it would've been impossible without the guy who provided the mediafire files for inserting the script into the VN (see above), so kudos to him.<br><br>If someone else wants to do other ones, I'd be happy to provide editing/translating work for the other 2 crappy translations ( http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg and http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy ) but I'm not going through that line-spacing nightmare again.

See you in 8 hours  <br><br><br>OK what's even supposed to be happen on these pics?</br></br></br>  Wait, so it's just a LN? No second season or whatever? Well damn.    <br><br>*happening</br></br>  S2 when?  <br><br>Scans when? Mine will take one month to arrive.</br></br>  <br>Why are they so gay, god damn.</br>  hey, remember that time Yuuna punched a thing.  Hey guys, script anon here. I've been really busy lately, but now I have some time to work on adding translation data.<br>Also some good news, while fiddling with the data files I found how to remove the text size limit, so separating lines won't be necessary anymore, I also found how to translate the color codes for names so adding the @ won't be necessary either.<br><br><br>Yeah the most annoying part is getting the line breaks right, but the crashing issue should disappear with this fix, if you can edit the other translations I'll gladly add them to the script file.<br><br>After I'm done re-editing the existing translations so they work with the new fix I'll upload them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, good times</br>  <br>There's still 3 unannounced news so I'm pretty sure a second season will be one of them. I'm not surprised they haven't released any information about a s2 yet considering it was only a short while ago s1 aired and they didn't expect it to get the popularity it did. I rather wait for them to pan out the details than rush it.</br>  <br>i l-love you anon</br>  <br>You're doing God's work anon!</br>  Got some tiny bit of information<br> The new LN chapter doesn't directly connect to the supposed S2 but to Nowayu. <br> Highlight is Wakaba's picture. <br> Chapter has an unrest atmosphere. <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned this picture up a little bit.<br>Though, having a scan in 1200 dpi and original size I'd be able to make it look better.</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly.<br>During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry.<br>God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_; <br>Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna may turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>c-come on anon,,, t-tell me it's a joke ;_;</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>Why this</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>So she's an immortal divine being with the  soul of a lion  now.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>W-which Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>REAL HUMAN BEAN</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  Okay, guys. Brace yourself for chapter summary, as well as a tiny snapshot of Wakaba. <br> Chapter starts with Sonoko and Karin in the bath talking about candidates for the next club head. <br> When Sonoko went home she found an old Hero Record book. <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br> However, at the last page there's a picture of a girl that looks like her. <br> The name is Nogi Wakaba, the year is 2015. <br> Sonoko shows the book to the club. <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Last illustration is of the entire club looking at Wakaba's picture. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br> Chapter ends. <br><br>Inb4, the old Yuuna's soul hijacks our current Yuuna's body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br>damn not again Taisha</br></br>    <br>I'm scared, /a/. Also, <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br><br>I bet her soul is  burning as hot as the sun .</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>I don't want to see her cry...</br></br>  <br>Guys, we got too used to the cute SoL moments in the vita and VNs. This is the true face of Takahiro. Brace yourselves.</br>  <br>E-everything will be ok.</br>  <br> Yuuna suffering continues <br>I can't go on guys, this is too much for my heart.<br>Can't she just punch things back into daijobu again? ;_;<br>God I need NoWaYu now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y-yeha be postive guys!<br>The healing will feel even better after Yuuna dealt with the next shit happening. She is a hero she won't lose! let's just belive in her!<br>You're likely to succceed if you try!</br></br></br>  Okay, prediction time:<br>Yuuna absorbed a part of Leo's soul when she touched the core. She was in coma because of the adjustments in her soul that had to happen.<br>Leo's soul is now sleeping inside her waiting for a trigger to wake it up. I can see two different paths from there:<br>1. Yuuna becomes a combined hero-super-vertex and the final boss, Tougou calls out to her, Yuuna fights within her soul against Leo and wins.<br>2. Leo is actually an observer and messenger and its task is to see what's going on inside of the walls of the Shinju-sama and to assess if they should continue trying to destroy humanity or if the Shinju has a point.</br></br></br></br>  we evangelion now  <br>I'd like the first thing.  Actually as long as Yuuna is fine in the end I'd love any ending I guess. <br>The whole Takashima deal makes all this a bit complicated though. I think because of the <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br>we can assume that Yuuna either has <br>A. The memories of Takashima<br>B. Is Takashima<br>Just being named after her won't work now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God I need these YuYuYu Character songs now.<br>I am in need of healing.</br>  <br>Or may be Takashima   is Leo </br>  <br>Or maybe Takashima got absorbed by Leo, and now both got absorbed by Yuuna.</br>  <br><br><br>It would make a lot of sense that the humans dying within that small world reincarnate over and over again as they have nowhere else to go.<br>I like this idea a lot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Yuuna unintentionally absorbed Leo as fuel and is slowly becoming a godess theory. As time goes on she is becoming more aware of the past events and her blacking out is the recalling of past events triggered by her immediate surroundings. That play that they put on may have actually occurred word for word in the past.</br>   mfw all the people who got crazy about Yuuna's fainting after ep.12 aired were right after all   Guys, I think we're too naive to thinks that there'll be any scans in the near future. Remember that this is from a Visual Fanbook, not a magazine, not many people are willing to dissect their book to scan it.  <br><br>Makes me wonder why there are no paper-thin flexible scanners. There are paper-thin flexible displays, shouldn't be too hard to create something like that using a combination of microscopic light sources and detectors that basically create a snapshot of the surface they're put on.</br></br>  <br>T-try not to give up ;_;</br>  i need more healing already...  <br>Just gives me incentive to buy the books myself.</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Healing when ;_;</br>  <br>Staying true in her time of struggle, eh?</br>  <br>Alright, here's Yuuki Yuuna 24-hour coverage, edited/retranslated: http://pastebin.com/QpW8Dys6<br><br>Note that the original TLs don't distinguish between Tougou dialogue and Tougou narration - I've left it as is, but if you get confused anywhere let me know.<br><br>Actually, the original translations were a lot worse for this one, reading like a machine translation at times - my favourite parts were the copy-paste definition of 顔パス - "free admission for being well known" and the translation of 国語 as "national language" instead of Japanese. <br><br>Note everyone that this scenario contains the most information about Yuuna's post-recovery status that we get in the VN.<br><br> Tougou: There are still mysteries left, but with everyone, I'm sure... <br> Tougou: I casually raise my head to the sky. <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou is becoming a stalker.<br><br>Also<br> Tougou: However, did they really return? <br> Tougou: Could it be that we were granted something new...? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Takahiro! i'm not ready for this!</br>  <br>No need for that, my copy will arrive in about 4 days. If there's still no scans for 2nd translator anon, I'll take up the task myself.<br><br><br> Yuuna's soul (consciousness) fused with Leo and then got taken away as offering. <br> When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br>I can see this happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tougou: ...I let them know about being chosen as an offering. <br> Tougou: However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Tougou: Just being delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>About this part, I think it should be<br> ...My parents knew about me being chosen as offering. <br> However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Just seeing how they're so delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>As seen in Wasuyu, Taisha only hid the truth from the heroes, not their parents so it'd be weird for Tougou to be the one letting them know. Her parents knew the truth and didn't do anything about it, however, seeing how they still truly care about her, she doesn't blame them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Such a mature behaviour from a teenaged girl really strains my suspension of disbelief.<br> Just kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 喜んでくれただけで, which definitely means that the parents are the one's being delighted with Tougou's recovery. I think I intended it to be "Just them being delighted with my recovery is sufficient" but accidentally a word. Sorry.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>However, the "let them know" is correct, 知らされていた definitely implies Tougou imparting the information to her parents.</br>  <br>Wait nevermind, I'm an idiot. The information was imparted to the parents but not by Tougou, you were right.</br>  <br><br>I love Karin</br></br>    <br>She looks like a mix between Sonoko and Wasshi.</br>  <br><br>That's a fucking glorious hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>Hot damn, she looks like some bad-ass Taisha hitwoman</br>  <br> Or may be Takashima is Leo <br>Or may be Takashima Yunna is   Yuuki Yuuna, when she is in coma. Mental time travel yo. So they actually foreshadow it in the spin off?? Damn. </br></br>  <br> time travel shenanigans <br><br>Now we're talking.</br></br></br>   Standing on top of Kamagura castle's inner right citadel in Kaogawa prefecture, Nogi Wakaba stared at Seto Inland sea.  <br>6 main characters:<br> Nogi Wakaba <br> Kamisato Hinata <br> Takashima Yuuna <br> Gun Chikage <br> Doi Tamako <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br><br>Tfw Wakaba's flower is the same as Tougou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention, for this one, Takahiro's just in charge of planning, Akashiro Aoi'll be the one writing it.</br>  <br> Gun Chikage <br><br>I hope that is also her weapon of choice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I missed a few threads, this is going to be another LN series like WaSuYu?</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll be about the very first group of hero back in the time before they changed the calendar.</br>  <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br>Actually, it's "Iyojima Anzu".</br></br>  <br>Elysium works fine, Bloatgirls if you desire so.<br><br> Lesbian <br> LESBIAN <br>You delusional fuck she even writes that her dream is to become a wife.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's Marugame Castle, which is the one that Sumi visited with her mother in episode 10.<br>So the setting will probably be the same as WaSuYu's, meaning that the old Yuushas won't have to see their homes turn to fire at the end of the LN.</br></br>  <br>Elysium's release is overfiltered garbage.</br>  <br>Yeah, my mistake, it's Marugame castle.<br>Their home won't turn into fire but the rest of the world might. <br><br>Got another interesting detail in the new chapter<br> Sonoko talks about the type of person she likes. <br>  &gt;It sounds exactly like she's describing Wasshi.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>19<br> 2018 <br> mfw 2015 nao <br>THE SUFFERING NEVER ENDS<br>WE HAVE NO FUTURE</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I don't really know how to tell the difference man, the only thing I can measure is blurriness and even that I'm not very good at.</br>  <br>Tfw Vertices's attack is in 2015. We'll never get to read it. <br>All joking aside, they probably just fucked the release date. Officially, the Visual Fanbook's supposed to be released on 30th yet they're selling it now.</br></br>  Still no scans.  <br><br>2018.7.30 is the date when the novel events happen.<br>The novel starts being published in September's Dengeki this year.</br></br></br>  <br>The Hero Record was written starting from 2015, though.</br>  <br>Then maybe it doesn't start with the very first event?<br>I mean what the fuck else could 2018.7.30 stand for.<br>Alternative idea: maybe we're starting off with a few members and gain a big party by that date, there are 6 people to be collected after all.</br></br></br>  It can't arrive soon enough.  <br>We're counting on you, anon.</br>  Even if we get no scans this time there'll still be translation as some of us also bought the book. The problem is when Nowayu starts, there're no guarantee that each chapter'll get scanned as soon as it comes out or at all.  <br>I wasn't arround when WaSuYu got scanned but there were no problems that time as far as I know so why would it be different now?</br>  <br>WaSuYu has been out for months before the anime started and translations began.<br>We only really had to wait for the final chapter.</br></br>  <br>And the final chapter never got scanned, an anon had to the digital version released half a month later of the magazine. If Nowayu has no scans, who in here has enough money and is willing to keep buying the magazine for ~8 months straight?</br>    <br> High quality scan <br>is it happening!?</br></br>    <br> I'm feeling healed already </br>    <br>glorious school girl with Japanese sword and ponytail.</br>  <br>I want to touch their marshmallows<br><br> that underwater navel peek <br>too lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br> Katana <br>Meh.<br>Hopefully they have someone with a mace/flail/staff/anything blunt in the new old crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we're going to get an axe again. <br>Her sword looks quite special to not be used in actual combat. Maybe they're going to fight without transforming and just got some stats boost this time. <br> No fairy <br> No magical armor <br>I wonder how many of the main 6 will pull a Gin before the final chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or get one hit killed by scorpion in the guts.</br>  <br>Its been three hundred years, They could be related.</br>  <br>Where does this leave Gin now anyway?<br>There were six Yuusha in the past- not seven.<br>So either Gin or one of the six remaining girls in 300 cannot be a reincarnation of one of the six girls in the past.<br>Could this mean- Gin's death was an accident? She was never supposed to have been a Yuusha?<br>Or is one of the current girls not supposed to be a Yuusha? Which one would it be? Itsuki? She only became one to be with her sister. Or Karin? Who only became one because another Yuusha died?<br> They are creating way more questions with this story than they are answering.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody said they have to be a reincarnation.</br>  <br>Is it back in stock? Or did they really sell out in the first 30 minutes it was on sale?</br>  <br>so last night I posted this<br>and today I come home and find this: <br>She even carries a sword as her weapon.<br>An Ikemen mahout shoujou named Wakaba who even carries a sword! At least they changed the hair and eye color.<br>Will this Wakaba princess carry loli's as well?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hoenstly think the chance of one of the Yuushas being a loli is pretty high.  Gotta please the audience. </br>  <br>I don't care as long as there's a megane Yuusha.<br>Seriously.<br>Come on.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this? Sonoko's little sister?</br>  <br>Sonoko's ancestor.</br>  <br> 2014 <br> yuuna punches a thing <br> 2015 <br> yuuna is a thing <br>What went wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This really makes it look like Sonoko is entering the Karinbowl. To win.</br></br>  <br>Don't lose hope. Sonoko After got translated based only on cellphone pictures.</br>  So will Takashima finally get an awesome red scarf of badassitude  <br>I thought Itsuki was the acting loli since she was only 12?</br>  <br> &gt;When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br><br>Who in the name of fuck is Takashima?</br></br></br>  <br> Only leaves wincest route left <br>Praise be to Sonoko.</br></br>  <br>One of the original yuushas, along with Wakaba.</br>  <br>But when asked what type of person she likes, Sonoko basically described Wasshi, or so I heard.</br>  <br> Itsuki &amp; Fuu <br> non-straight <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I pick Itsuki  x  Fuu</br>    <br>Yes, but she has to face reality like Karin had to. Maybe that was the real reason Sonoko cried in episode 8. If the Vita game is canon she already knew Togo had lost her memories.<br>So it makes more sense that when she saw Yuuna with her that she realized that Togo had found someone else.</br></br>  <br>What's going on? Where did this scan come from? Why isn't there more?</br>  I wish Gin was here.  <br>I think having flowers floating in the bathwater is pretty gay.<br>Especially if the flowers are all the character flowers of you and the other girl you are sharing the bath with.</br></br>  <br>It's Vertices, not Vertexes.</br>  <br>Well we will find out now if its true she died because Taisha made her fight with 300 year old weapons.</br>  <br>probably of someone who made a scan of the cover.<br>Probably no scans of the insides because it might hurt the book.</br></br>  <br>But anon, it'd be really dangerous if she drops her megane or if it's broken in the middle of a fight.</br>  <br>But the cover is . That oughta be a page in the middle. Unless the LN chapter comes in a separate booklet.</br>  <br>noun [C] uk /ˈvɜː.teks/ us /ˈvɝː.t̬eks/ (plural vertices or vertexes) specialized</br>  Got the details of Sonoko's type now<br> Someone who is serious, good at taking care of people but also gets out of control sometimes. </br>  <br>She'd like Shirou.</br>  <br>Cant that apply to Karin? She is certainly serious.</br>  <br>Why are Sonoko and Karin sharing a rose bath together?</br>  <br>Well it was one of the sleepovers.<br>But the flowers were Sonoko's idea.<br>(She is also the only one with enough yen to buy a couple dozen roses just to cut up to do this)</br></br></br>  <br> She is certainly serious. <br>About muscle training and supplement. And she certainly isn't that good about taking care of people, Tougou and Fuu have to force her eats proper foods from time to time.</br></br>  <br>Sonoko is making some advances</br>  <br>Flowers smell nice.</br>  <br><br>It doesn't work like that if you take the future setting into account where loads of girls can become heroes.</br></br>  <br>I want to smell Karin.</br>  <br>It's more about genetics.<br>Those girls who have the most compatible genes (aptitude) can become Yuushas.<br>Thats why the big familys close to Taisha came to exist. But because those families couldn't always produce offspring that could be used they changed it to look for girls outside those familys.</br></br></br>  <br>It is not same as Tougou. It is Balloon flower [as analyzed by communities i am in], which is very similar but still different. Its flower language is endless love, honesty, the return of a friend is desired, obedience, changless love, amiable romance and so on.</br>  <br>Gin became  Yoshiteru. </br>  <br>Fuck</br>  <br>It's been pretty clear for a while now that Karin's subtext-endgame is Fuu.</br>  <br>Who is Itsuki's subtext-endgame with? Why is there always an odd number?</br>   The Yuuna at the end of episode 12 and who returned to Togo is actually an ancient Yuuna imposter from 2015.  <br><br>what</br></br>  <br>what</br>  <br><br/></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>84327<br>Is this another remix album, or maybe unused music?</br></wbr>  <br>Music that wasn't included in the first OST, VN exclusive BGMs, Forestize Warning, Emergency Warning, and Emergency Warning "Censored Version" (the one from episode 10) and Inori no Uta.</br>  Wait, are we gonna get a S2 and things are gonna go back to being fire instead of fine?      <br>everything was on fire from the beginning</br>  <br>Cool. I can't get enough of the warnings.</br>  I refuse to believe these spoilers until I've seen the scans for myself.<br>I invite you all to do the same.</br>  さあさあ has never been the same after Karin's awesome fight. I grin like an idiot every time I think of it.  <br>I hope so</br>  <br>And I think of it every time I hear someone say it.</br>  <br>They sound pretty believable. Can't say the same about a lot of the speculation done after them in this thread.</br>  <br>too bad the one i ordered still haven't leave Japan...</br>  <br> 2015 <br>is this legit</br></br>  <br>  The Yuuna at the end of episode 12 and who returned to Togo is actually an ancient Yuuna imposter from 2015.  <br><br>Wouldn't Yuuna-15 freak out what the hell is going on and who all those people are?<br>Or does she not give a fuck and just rolls with it? Because that would be hilariously awesome.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she has the memories of current Yuuna</br>  <br>I think she understands whats happened and doesn't want to cause issues so is trying to impersonate Yuki to the best of her ability.</br>  <br>No, it's the real Yuuna! It has to be. I won't believe it...</br>  <br><br>Absurd.</br></br>  <br>I'm with this anon. All of those happy moments at the end can't have been lies. I think it's more likely that Yuuna's soul traveled back in time somehow while she was a potato and that's why she recognized Wakaba. My bet is that Takashima Yuuna is none other than Yuuki Yuuna.</br>  Yuuna was never taken by Shinju in the first place, it was because of the Leo core. If anything, she's the one who was sent through time during her coma and is impersonating Takashima in the LN.  <br><br>This sounds like the most plausible explanation and I like it.<br>Also<br> 1 post apart </br></br></br></br>    <br>NERD</br>  <br> Yuna and Togo finally get to fucking <br> Yuna stops halfway <br> Can't proceed knowing she's not the same Yuna Togo loved <br> Angst ensures </br></br></br></br>  <br>I posted that as a joke tweeeeest when we first learned Takashima's name, but it's actually looking surprisingly plausible now.</br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>Aaaand here we go again or, more accurately, the ride never actually ended. It was all just an illusion to dull our senses into a false state of security.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yep.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yuuna going back in time certainly sounds more plausible than "lol ancestor hijack".<br><br>In b4 Yuuna's time fuckery is the trigger that caused the gods to fuck humanity in the first place</br></br></br></br>    <br>Well, if she caused the whole problem it makes sense she's the hero that has to solve it, then.</br>  <br>Well.... most time travel war story ends up like this<br>Like Achron.   Inb4 Leo is built according to Yuuna.  </br></br>  <br> Yuuna going back in time is what caused the vertexes to attack earth <br> the vertex invasion is what ultimately led Yuuna to go back in time <br>That's why time travel shenanigans aren't a very good idea.<br><br>Still, we do have a precedent for time travel if you take that special 4koma chapter to be canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Anon, that's how the Shinju-sama ACTUALLY fight the infinitely regenerating heavenly god! Trap them in a stable time loop!</br>  <br>If anthing, Yuuna would bring the Vertex core with her that is used a base for Vertex back in 2015.</br>  <br>We'll go full Night Watch. Whatever caused the time travel fuckery gets original hero Takashima Keel killed early, Yuuna has to take her place and preserve history (and humanity) by establishing the Hero System and beating back the first wave of Vertex in order to ensure that there even is "present" left for her to return to.</br>  <br> Takashima Keel <br>  Keel <br><br>Wait, was that name confirmed before?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>I don't follow these threads since the end of the anime, what does than mean? What is shen then?</br></br>  <br>we don't know either, we all still waiting for actual scans and then the translation.</br>  <br>Vertex, probably.<br>If you watched the last episode you might have an idea.</br></br>  <br><br>So Yuuna was never human or maybe the human Yuuna got replaced by the Vertex Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Keel was the character who died at the start of Night Watch.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she writes that her dream is to have a wife.</br>  <br>Why are bloatgrils so bloaty anyway?</br>  Why is Niboshi so good?<br>Karin has some god tier taste.</br>  <br>  Tougou got her waifu killed and replaced by an alien bodysnatching murderbot <br><br>I could smell the angst if something like this happened.<br><br>What if Yuuna's soul actually never returned and we got Shinju-sama occupying her body instead?</br></br></br></br></br>    Observe the imouto in her natural habitat, waking her onii-chan in the traditional manner.      <br>do little sisters really do this?</br>   tfw no imouto ride me <br><br>;_:</br></br>  <br> yes </br>  <br>All the time</br>  Get off me.

But here's what I've gotten done so far on 70. Most of the hard stuff is over with, now it's just the tedious detail work left.<br><br>In the following two posts I'll put up 76 and 77 from the previous thread, which remain undone.<br/></br></br>  Never really got how people redraw things.<br><br>By the way, wouldn't a marker-type font work better with these?</br></br>      <br>That's pretty good, how did you do it?<br> Did you draw the missing parts yourself?</br></br>  Put a white stroke onto the text, anon. It's easy to do.  Mediafire this shit when you're done.    <br>The ear is copied, scaled, and perspective-d from another image. The rest I'm doing with the line tool, pencil, paintbucket, smudge, and airbrush. For the texture in the shadows, I'm copy-pasting from unaltered parts of the image.</br>    <br> she falls asleep </br>  <br>Go home Kariya, you're drunk</br>    <br>Is this some kind of Japanese meme? I've seen another image in this exact style.</br>  <br>this font choice doesn't really capture any of the excitement of the hiragana in the original.</br>  <br>What font would you use?</br>  <br>What man is she talking about here?<br>I don't really get this one.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh</br>  <br>oh, right. I get it now.</br>  <br>This tl seems wrong.<br><br>The only thing she has in common with Gil is blonde hair and being a king.</br></br></br>    <br> Other than me having "blonde hair" and being a "king" <br>This line doesn't make sense. Does she mean that those are the ONLY things she has in common with him?<br><br>Not your fault, the other guy translated it this way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's talking about how Gil has the original versions of every Noble Phantasm.</br>  <br>Well Shirou saying she's over-thinking it so...<br>I don't know</br></br>  <br>Marker felt was my first choice. If not then letteromatic. Wild Words italic for thoughts. If you don't like italics then augie. White stroke on text if there is any.</br>  <br>Heh. Saber always seems to get into wars with jerkass archers.</br>      <br><br>Not good enough, I'd willingly become an imouto for Trude.</br></br>  <br> implying you are cute enough to be Trude's imouto </br>  <br>I want Trude to be my imouto.</br>  Want to get this off my chest.<br>I'M IN LOVE WITH SANYA!<br>Okay go on with the thread guys.</br></br>  <br><br>Eila?</br></br>  Araki really out did himsself in terms of waifu material with Yasuho.

Yes it had slow times that even I hated, but in the end all I wanted was more of those. Yes it had pretty plain characters, but those characters developed and I felt the departure crush them. The ending is exactly what I expected from the beginning, but the journey is what made me not want it. However, it was bitter-sweet. Anime like this only comes once in a blue moon.<br>ITT: Show Plastic Memories and Isla some love.</br></br>  <br>Nice double</br>  <br>Forced sadness the anime I dont need it.</br>  <br> hoping a show about robots that die quickly would end similar to an episode about a robot that never dies and has to be abandoned <br><br>You what.<br><br>God tier episode though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bittersweet </br>  <br>Isla would have dropped her spaghetti to be in a shower room almost completely naked with him in a tub if she wasn't already past that point with him before.
