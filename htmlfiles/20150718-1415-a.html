[ Why would Vegeta need to look for the moon when he could just create one whenever he wanted?  Because Toriyama wrote himself into a corner and he needed a way out.  <br>The power ball uses a lot of energy</br>  <br>He's just gonna turn into a giant ape and destroy everything anyways</br>  <br><br>Why would you have a cheese toastie when you can have the same nutrients by eating all the components seperately?</br></br>  <br>Ki conservation. Why waste ki making an artificial moon when you were led to believe there was a perfectly good one there already?<br><br>Dragon Ball is literally the easiest thing ever to understand, yet retards still fail to grasp even the most basic things that happen in it. You pick this to have a "problem" with? Something that makes perfect sense?<br><br>Here's a real problem. In Future Trunks time, Gohan lost all of his family and friends, and fought to the brink of death for over 10 years against the Artificial Humans, and yet he never got strong enough or angry enough to ascend beyond Super Saiyan.It's utterly ridiculous.</br></br></br></br></br>  I always assumed because it was a knock off it wasn't as powerful<br><br>It was mentioned early on that transforming into an ape gave Saiyans 10x the power level... By all means Vegeta should have been stronger than Ginyu at that point... but instead he got beat by Yajirobe.</br></br>  Kaga's song is rather gay.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FFz<wbr>ZbKKMI3c</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Weeb translation of this should be coming.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Decade <br> shit story <br> shit cast <br> shit AR Riders <br> budget lost by the 4th or 5th episode so blatantly you can see the strings on Kivala <br> terrible movies <br> inspired all the MegaMax garbage trends since <br>Tsukasa is a shitty Tendou clone.<br><br>Also best DD is clearly Kiyoshimo.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaga is a traditional Japanese waifu</br>  <br><br>Are you going to reply to every Kaga post?</br></br>  <br>Super cute and waifuish</br>  <br>I love Kaga's enka song</br>  Translation here: <br><br>http://pastebin.com/23mRRdEi</br></br>  <br>He should bang them too.

Okay, I'm sold.  <br>The more I look at her, the more disgusted I am at the anime.</br>  <br>what's up with the awful editing?</br>  <br>I actually wouldn't mind it that much if they  cover the sex slaves with some rags and use sheets for the rape scene  I fear however that they just won't show it at all.</br>  <br>/ak/</br>  <br> you now remember there's an onsen scene when nearly all the girls' boobs are naked and uncensored <br> you now realize you won't see shit in the anime </br></br>  Last ep today and no thread?  i thought they ended this after season 1.

Spoiled cunt. <br><br>A lot of people did, myself included. I never felt she was MC though, she's like a prop.</br></br></br></br>  I would to discuss a topic I feel is important. Not only to me personally but to all of us.<br>Does Tomoko smell bad?<br>While she is sometimes described as "stinky" I think of her as having a distinct but not unpleasant odor. Others disagree and say she would smell quite bad. Tomoki tells her that she doesn't smell bad when she is sweat, so why then do people continue to spread this malicious rumor?<br><br>If possible please list some odors you think would be part of her scent.</br></br></br></br>   DMJii is usefull and willing to help everyone <br> Kirika gets a cool henshin scene <br> Hibiki becomes more useless than Maria and stupider than she was in the first 2 seasons <br>What the fuck is happening?<br><br>At this rate, shit's getting so crazy that I expect Genjuro to borrow her Gungnir and transform into fucking Odin while solo'ing all the dolls at once.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If Chris and Kirika fucked, who would be on top?</br></br>  <br>We've been calling Tsubasa autistic this whole time but it was actually Hibiki.</br>  <br>I know you're extremely aroused after today, Maria, but you need to calm down.</br>  <br>You can't save or protect dead people so why bother?</br>  <br>Shirabe.<br><br>Threesomes are always an option.</br></br></br>  Will demon save the animu?  <br>thank you guys</br>  Reading the manga again I realized that this girl looks similar to Durriken.<br><br><br>I'm the one who posted that, so thanks for that.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course not, the only character I thought was going to make this AOTS was glasses girl, and clearly, they don't want that.</br>  succubus looks pretty bad to me for some reason  I want to fuck Grandumber   http://bato.to/read/_/333062/tomo-<wbr>chan-wa-onna-no-ko_ch102_by_love-li<wbr>ve-scanlations</wbr></wbr> <br><br>The sexiest</br></br>  <br> implying Misuzu has a shell <br>You saw how badly she reacted to the news of molestation. Her shell was taken against her will.</br></br>  <br>Anon, please. Everyone has a shell they show to the world. People are like onions. They have layers.

But I want to strip them all off, touch her heart and embrace her true self.</br>  <br> right over his head </br>  <br>You lost me.</br>  <br>She's just protective of her friend.

The Oboe is one of the most difficult instruments to play, and this girl can play it flawlessly when she's stable.</br>    Just finished Evangelion today and uh........ I am emotionally distraught and I have no clue why. I mean I understand what happened but jesus christ.  Also it was good how they made me hate all of the characters at the beginning of the end just so I didn't kill myself after I watched that ending.   <br>Fresh: 1<br>Rotten: 3<br><br>in other words, 1/(3+1) makes 25%.<br><br>How does it feel to be literally retarded?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your post hit me way too hard. last summer the first time I watched Evangelion, I dropped acid a couple days later and I started thinking about it. it gave me the worst trip I've ever had in my life, hell the only bad trip ive ever even had. <br><br>I started to identify with Shinji. Feeling fear like he must've felt . Wondering if my actions were wrong or right and constantly doubting everything I did. <br>It fucked me up man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah man, question everything, you fucking feel me? Sounds like you had a downright crazy trip, man, like woah. Absolutely, you just gotta be one with the earth, my dude. Just open your eyes, know what I'm saying? Good on you.</br>  <br>Nah, 2.0 was decent. It still felt like Eva, but a more optimistic version of it where the characters actually make an active effort to become better people instead of being weighed down and basically destroyed by their flaws and traumas like in the original. Though you could argue that the depression and bleakness was what made the original compelling in the first place, I'd still say 2.0 was a good movie for what it was. Shallower, yes, but still enjoyable.<br><br>3.0, on the other hand, was just a poorly written, badly paced mess that relied on retarded miscommunications for the sake of conflict, effectively ruined Rei's character, focused too much on Kaworu without actually developing him, introduced too many throwaway characters they did nothing with, timeskipped 14 years while not showing anything that happened in the meantime and not aging up the pilots because of some convenient unexplained "curse", and generally did a shit job at pretty much every front except the animation. It was just a bad movie, Eva or not.</br></br></br>  <br> Q <br> 2.99 <br>http://movies.yahoo.co.jp/movie/%E3<wbr>%83%B1%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E<wbr>3%82%B2%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B2%E3%83%B3%<wbr>E6%96%B0%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E7%89%88<wbr>%EF%BC%9AQ/343233/<br><br> 2.0 <br> 4.46 <br>http://movies.yahoo.co.jp/movie/%E3<wbr>%83%B1%E3%83%B4%E3%82%A1%E3%83%B3%E<wbr>3%82%B2%E3%83%AA%E3%83%B2%E3%83%B3%<wbr>E6%96%B0%E5%8A%87%E5%A0%B4%E7%89%88<wbr>%EF%BC%9A%E7%A0%B4/333212/<br><br>top kek</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></blockquote>]
