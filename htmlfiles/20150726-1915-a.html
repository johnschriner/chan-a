[ /a/ has now daily naruto threads. what happend?  moot got tired of them spamming /q/  There are worse shows, honestly.  The dream is dead.  <br>Because we're plebs<br><br>On another note, just started reading Yotsuba, I love it so much goddamn.</br></br></br>  <br>Name 5</br>   Watching evangelion for the first time.  <br> everyone warned me shinji is a little bitch <br> so far all of his reactions have been completely justified <br> he became a competent Eva pilot in a really short time <br>What's everyone's problem with him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because he isn't doing the standard hot blooded anime shit, which is like the entire point of the series.<br><br>It reminds me when I read fs/n and kept getting bad ends every fucking time because the options are always <br>1. STUPID SUICIDAL SHIT <br>2. Sensible option<br>and you're supposed to pick 1 every time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people just seem to really hate Shinji for no reason.</br>  <br>They probably thought he was going to be the usual shounen protagonist.</br>  <br>He won't fuck their waifu.</br>  <br>I'm so fucked up.</br>  If anything its Rei that I hate. I hate the trope of the girl with seemingly no emotions.  <br>Shinji does plenty of heroically retarded shit. He charges angels and trades stabs until one of them dies, he reflexively jumps into a volcano, he piloted in the first place so a weird girl wouldn't have to.</br>  Where can I torrent this guys?  <br><br> &gt;Watching evangelion for the first time. <br><br>Sure m8</br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuka best girl.</br>  <br>yeah, but he also runs away twice and bitches before doing the things you've mentioned, which is the non-standard bit</br>  <br>Wait until next month if you're being serious.</br>  <br>For real. I thought it would be some philosophical bullshit which is why I put it off this long.</br>  We just finished this same thread. Do you really want more of that?  <br>why? I don't have that kind of time</br>  <br>The difference is the motivation of his actions. Shinji does heroic things because of pure terror. A lot of the time he does things out of obligation rather than intrinsic value. Emiya does shit because he doesn't value his life whatsoever.</br>  Didn't we have this exact same thread just an hour and a half ago?    <br><br>The literally first real robot has a MC bitching and running away.</br></br>  <br>To be fair, Shirou is crazy.</br>  <br><br> tfw you get fucked by the Red comet </br></br>  <br> literally first real robot <br><br>Try watching some more anime.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw you are the red comet </br>  <br><br> waah 0079 is a super robot anime <br> inb4 Dougram was the first real robot anime <br> inb4 tomino is a hack <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tetsujin </br>  <br><br>wat</br></br>  <br><br>Eva is a story that repeats.</br></br>  <br><br>Is this bait?

I find his reactions fairly realistic, especially considering how introverted he is.</br></br>  <br>what's good wasted</br>  <br>Yea does his dad ever stop being a shit?</br>  <br><br>Final Fantasy XIV, /a/nonymous.</br></br>  <br>so nothing is good, got it</br>  <br><br>I'm enjoying it.</br></br>  <br> He does, 10 secends before his death </br>  <br>the blu-ray release is in a month</br>  <br><br> Le Rei is a doll faec <br><br>Somebody post the face compilation.</br></br></br></br>    What I don't understand is people giving Asuka any more character depth when the entire purpose of her existence was just to spam "anta-baka" and be the generic tsundere love interest.<br><br>It's like these fool think they can become psychologists by watching EVA.</br></br>  <br>The characters are kinda bad in this show. But I really like all the detail they put into the technology of the world and how the city hides from the angles.</br>  <br>He's too real and child-like and the edgy 14 year olds that flood this board hate it because it reminds them of what they're like.<br><br>He's just a messed up kid in a messed up situation, that's all. The only thing I really fault him for is for going after red-heads.</br></br></br>  Shinji IS a bitch. <br><br>Not because he's not doing the usual MC bullshit but because he's a coward with serious daddy issues. <br>Got mad because a guy that he just met turned out to be a traitor and an angel. <br><br>And a lot of other stuff that I don't remember.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ow fuck I remember. <br>I fucking hate people getting butthurt over something anf just saying "no one understands (me) anyway" <br><br>Is there something gayer than in this world and the others ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I object to that notion. Rei does have plenty of emotions, she just doesn't understand what they are.<br><br>Personally, it's Asuka who I hate, as she actually is the one who whines more than Shinji and doesn't do enough to make me feel sympathetic for her, regardless of her backstory.</br></br></br>  <br>There is a bit of Shinji in all of us, some people get the shits about it and react poorly when the show reveals that to them.</br>  <br> the entire purpose of asuka was to spam 'anta-baka' <br> the entire purpose of shinji was to be a crybaby <br> the entire purpose of rei was to be werid as fuck <br>You don't have to be a psychologist to realise there was a little more to it than that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I choose best albino.</br>  <br> seemingly no emotions <br>Rei is pissed off about one thing or another for like 90% of the show</br></br>  Describe this emotion to me, Reiautists.  <br>You seriously picked that over all the other times she showed emotions? <br><br>Anyways though, I believe that that was when she first encountered Kaworu (if I'm correct. This show has so much fricken recycled animation). There, she was showing unease and suspicion, though that was in the scene after he told her that they are the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is she blushed at Kaworu? Is she gay?</br>  <br>Yep, really hoping this 404s quietly.</br>  <br>What I really don't get is why people like Gendo for being a "badass" and liking Asuka when she's really shit.<br><br>Then people bash Shinji for not getting in the robot</br></br></br>  <br>Gendo is more autistic than shinji</br>   mfw people call eva a mecha anime   <br>Gendo is literally an adult Shinji, with Yui being his Kaworu.</br>  <br>From what I've seen Gendo isn't even doing much during the attacks. Misato is the one leading ops and taking care of the well being of these incredibly important children all by herself.</br>  <br>Gendo is busy keikakuing</br>  <br>Is that code for sucking dick?</br>  <br>English BD when?  Where's my dubbed 3.33 Funi you fucking hacks. </br>  <br> Eva dub <br>g r o s s</br></br>  <br>I mean if all I ever had to do was say "Fuyutsuki take over" and just ride the elevator down to chill with mai waifu's perfect teen copy, I would have signed up already.<br><br>It's got to be more than that. Although I have no idea what.</br></br></br>   Asuka shows up <br> American Cowboy Music intensifies <br>come on japan you and Deutschland tried to take over the world, you should know them better than this</br></br>  <br> taking care of the well being of these incredibly important children all by herself <br>That was all her own idea, too, she was the only one objecting to just setting them all up like Rei's living situation. And she doesn't get any credit for it but Ritsuko teasing her about playing house.</br></br>  <br>The irony in your post is palpable.</br>  <br>too bad he doesnt do it when it really matters<br><br>  like when he couldve stopped toji;s eva instead of being a bitch  </br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't she offer to take Rei into her apartment, too?</br>  <br>Oh and the one fucking time Misato isn't running the op the fucker almost kills Shimji's friend right in front of him. He could've stopped the Eva after it took out the entry plug but nooo you gotta kill the fucker.</br>  <br> that feel when no-one appreciates your offer to take them to a steak dinner despite your meager finances <br>suffering</br></br>  Who's going to be the most annoying kid born from Darling and the girls?<br><br> Little spiders <br> Little sneks <br> Mermaids <br> Slimes can have kids (?) <br> Horse  <br> Harpies  <br> Dullahan can't have kids? <br><br>As always the playlist.<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>For the casual faggots or the people who doesn't read the last chapter of the manga   go to prettyanonymus and download the chapter  </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Little spiders since there will be millions of them  head waifu &gt; mlp waifu  <br>Either spider kids or centaur kids.

I am more than happy for this to go on for a while yet.<br><br>And I am also more than happy with a harem end.

Or is that just brutally honest?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think an ending where we somehow get 7 darlings would be great because everybody is happy and it's a neat callback to the original strips with the twins</br>  <br>While Miia seems most likely, I would prefer it were Suu. She is by far the most helpful around the house and is easily the most likely to lend a helping hand that actually helps rather than hinders. It's not likely but it would be nice.</br>  <br>I guess you can't really call them daughters actually, the man had nothing to do with it. Two thoughts here: her clone has the same knowledges and experiences as her, or it doesn't and has to learn like a child.</br>  <br>Would she be all shy and bashful and quick to retreat into her shell?</br>  <br>Paladin fags are the worst<br><br>they want to tie you down to some shitty human who probably doesn't even love you</br></br></br>  <br> Go Shadow Knights </br>  <br>maybe end it with a branching what if story where it shows the endings for all girls</br>  <br> YFW Monster Girls were the true wives meant for men <br> YFW "Human women" are just corrupted monster girls who have lost all feature <br>I WAS SO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH BEFORE THEY GOT M</br></br></br>  <br>Thing with Suu is.<br>I can clearly see that she would reject being Darling's wife cause she realizes that others would be hurt if he'd choose her over them even if they wouldn't want to admit they are.</br></br>  <br>Remember, all my dear MonMusu-bros:<br> Be excellent to each other. </br></br>   Darling's in the bathroom <br> suddenly, the roof caves in <br> twister mat on the floor <br> Cerea, Tio, Miaa, Papi and Polt all on the floor <br> Suu in the room above <br> spins the spinner <br> "Right hand yellow?" </br></br></br></br></br></br>   Papi's mom   <br>All of them except maybe sealand.</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>I could see this.</br>  Newfag here. Where's the best place to start read? Batoto only had the last few chapters.  <br>This logic supports giving everything to the girls, and supporting selfish behavior patterns. While I want all the girls to be happy, and this would fulfill that, it would not fulfill it in a satisfying way.<br><br>The harem end is the only end where the girls actually develop. Kurusu doesn't have to have a magical cloning mishap/shenanigans to please all the girls. He's already making them all feel like family. All a 'lel clone end' would accomplish would be a quiet acceptance of the waifufags that want to pretend like all the other girls don't exist and they can headcanon 'Darling x ??? OTP' bullshit like MALtards and Gaiafags.</br></br></br>  <br>Suu wants everyone to be happy after all, rather than prioritizing her own desires above those of others.</br>  <br>*start reading. hit post before finishing.</br>  <br> Where's the best place to start read? <br>From chapter 1.</br></br>  <br><br> you'll never have a family with Rachnee <br><br>this fucking hurts ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> The harem end is the only end where the girls actually develop </br>  <br>I'd smack you, but I don't want to mess up those dubs.</br>  Suu and Papi are there for fun, Centorea is a horse and Mero wants to lose. Rachnera and Miia are the only girls who could win  <br> Centorea is a horse  <br><br>and Miia and Rach are just a spider and snake ...the top two would be Miia or Centorea those two would prob feel the most rejected</br></br></br>  <br> Suu wearing a bra <br>What blasphemy is this?We sholud have the head of whoever made this.</br></br>   Smith drops a new girl on Darling <br> It's a chimp in a dress. </br>  <br> and Miia and Rach are just a spider and snake <br><br>Horse vagina, darling is a nice dude but I don't think he's into bestiality</br></br></br>  <br>*should</br>  <br>It's true. Instead of being standoffish and pushing the other girls out of there lives, the harem end would actually let them grow closer to each other, thus becoming a true family unit.</br>  <br>Its prob going to end with something happening to Miia and making darling realize shes the one and the other girls coming to terms with it</br>    The girls are way too selfish with darling for a harem end. Fuck. Even Centorea is okay with stealing him    <br>please go read the OP again</br>  <br>Swell... just like every other harem-turned-nonharem ever.<br><br>I'm sure the majority of the fans will just love an ending like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh.Now I'm interested in a Monkeygirl.<br> When she's mad she literally goes apeshit. </br></br>  <br>I'm in top 50 for horse pussy. Top 300ish overall.</br>  <br> those hips <br> those scales going up the sides <br><br>Miia really is best</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ya, i remember i was only a bit behind you before, but i went on vacation and just blind picked answers from my phone <br><br>it sent me super behind</br></br></br>  <br> UKEE UKEE! <br> The fuck are you saying <br> brown gunk hits the wall <br> NO <br> wrecks the place </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What game is this anyway ? <br><br><br><br>better than an open ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Monster Girl based on Candlejack wh</br>  <br>Her face and hip scales are moe</br>  <br> bestiality <br>I don't think that word means what you think it means.</br></br>  I think cerea is the best but I've loved lamias since I first play breath of fire 20 years ago. Also I'm not fond of horse pussy.  Cerea can't win cause she has a horse vagina. Sorry  Everyone, shh, the Yetchi is examining the fish.  <br>Comparing 'Utter shit' to 'garbage' and saying it's 'good' is a logical fallacy. I'm on this ride because this is one of the very few harem's I've seen where a real harem end seems likely. I'd rather hold out hope for glory than be contented with mediocre rationalizations like "Well at least 'Utter Shit' didn't happen. At least I got some decent garbage out of this deal."<br><br>A part of me thinks the majority of people supporting the 'one girl' ending are overzealous Snekfags, but I know that selfish people come in a variety of flavors. I'll just never understand why some people would willingly settle for less.</br></br></br>  <br>What would the other girls answer?</br>  Best girl is sleeping  Jesus fuck, TL when?  <br>Why does that have the shitty tumblr gif filter on it?</br>  <br>Fatty</br>  <br>Actually, the ones directly related to the show are the easiest as well as the hardest. You either get 20, or you get 0. It's the more hypothetical ones that require careful planning. Of course I could always get a fourth account for all for answers, but I enjoy challenging myself to pick the right one even if I have three accounts to pick from.</br>  <br>Trans is out, anon.</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/836254/d2d21d<wbr>0f1b/</wbr></br>  <br>Now<br>http://exhentai.org/g/836254/d2d21d<wbr>0f1b/</wbr></br></br>  <br> monmusu.tv/family </br>  <br><br><br>I keeping hoping for a happy end...</br></br></br>  What is the highest point reward on that question game?

I hate to tell you, but the vast majority of people can smell if you've masturbated, the only reason you can't smell it is because you get accustomed to the smell after a couple minutes, and most people are too pleasant to say "yo did you really jerk one out?"<br><br>Literally the only way to mask it is just before you're about to take a shower, and if you're doing it with clothes on make sure you don't wear those clothes until they're washed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, pic related is best girl.</br>  <br>Untrue. nice try bud.</br>  <br><br> I jerked one out hours before visiting my girlfriend and she commented on the smell, it's noticeable. </br></br>  <br>Im telling you, that isn't fucking true.</br>  <br><br>Are you saying that in the "no, it's impossible" way, or you know it's not true?</br></br>  <br>Im saying no as in impossible. The chemical makeup of semen does not allow for any statement of smell to be true. If you clean up right away instead of letting set in your clothes i guess, there is no fucking smell.</br>  If there's one thing I hope that comes out of this anime is the song "Everyday Animal Ears" from episode 3.  <br> The chemical makeup of semen does not allow for any statement of smell to be true. If you clean up right away instead of letting set in your clothes i guess, there is no fucking smell. <br><br> He doesn't know about the musk. <br><br>More than just sperm is getting kicked up by your fapping, anon, or haven't you noticed a distinct odor when you're really getting into the mood?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You must be a nasty retard if someone can actually smell it.<br><br> my girlfriend <br>Great blog, subscribed</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That has never happened to me, either, you nasty person.<br>Do you take a shower once a week or something?</br></br></br>    Is this all they had to announce?  <br>It can't be.<br>J-just wait til tomorrow.</br></br>  So I just started watching this yesterday and what is wrong with this taco girl?

Yeah, I can see it.</br></br>  I really like this new role of Saki-san.  Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released.<br>Please look forward to it</br>  <br><br>Confirmed.</br></br>  If you could write Rord of the Rings, what would it be about?  <br>I think that Saki is connected to Shino, at least as a fan, maybe as family.<br>I hope that Shino won the Zenkoku and found her mom, and then gave up on mahjong in a way like how Frodo got rid of the ring.<br>So Lord of the Rings is about Shino.</br></br></br>  Continuing from the last thread:<br>Posting Saki, Chapter 4</br>  <br>non sequitur taco page</br>  <br>Reporter Nishida wants to interview Nodoka.</br>  <br>Stop this shit.

It all depends on how the filter's settings. <br><br>No. Topaz filters are global. This means that they effect every pixel in the image. <br><br> image is just for you <br><br><br>This is the first time I've been in a scanlation thread for a long time. I was told that someone was spreading misinformation and I came to see it for myself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need to learn to stop replying to shitposters.</br>  <br><br>Looks good but you made two Japanese people into negroes.</br></br>  <br><br><br> &gt;No. Topaz filters are global. This means that they effect every pixel in the image. <br>Blending modes and leveling fix that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know Photoshop lets you select parts of the image, right?</br>  <br> samefagging three replies that amount to nothing more than "nuh uh ur wrong" </br>  <br> No. Topaz filters are global. This means that they effect every pixel in the image.  <br><br> What Is the polygonal lasso <br> What Is the pen tool </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not arguing against the use of Topaz. I will use it myself, mainly on colour scans. It's effective at smoothing out grain and moire, while keeping the original tones. What I'm asking is why  would apply a Topaz filter when the using the dodge or burn tool on a few spots of dust and speckle would be a more efficient way to do it. Why spend the time selecting the area you want to clean and then applying a filter, when you can just swipe it over with a tool?</br></br>  <br> Because Daiz is a nobody <br>ftfy<br><br>Cancer patients trying to act like they're relevant doesn't actually make them relevant</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why spend the time selecting the area you want to clean and then applying a filter, when you can just swipe it over with a tool? <br>Why spend the time swiping over it with a tool when you can Topaz the whole layer with settings that'll only get rid of the dust and nothing else, then batch the entire chapter and do other shit?</br></br>  <br>Because with the correct commands in Topaz you can clean the dust without affecting any other part of the image.<br><br>You don't even have to select it. Just make to the pixel and depth radius is not large enough to alter anything other specs of dust.</br></br></br>   TFW don't know any translators  <br><br>There's so much shit I want to work on</br></br>  <br>Learn japanese fag.</br>  <br> tfw able to translate but nowhere near enough time to work on everything I want to </br>  <br> Japanese  <br> Raws are usually in Chinese or Korean  <br><br>Waste of time boss</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> then batch the entire chapter and do other shit? <br><br>You win. I can't be bothered to explain why that is not the correct thing to do. You obviously have no understanding of how raster works or how to use a histogram.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally what I did for the entire chapter of </br>  <br>Now THIS is fucking bait. Look at how you COMPLETELY NUKED all of the screentones and over-sharpened the line art. In your version, you can't even see the gradient of the screentone on the last panel. The lineart is so thinned out that you destroyed detail on the arm in the top left panel. Disgusting.</br>  <br>Man, it's almost like you could have just made an example, a compare sample group, shown the results, and this would all be over with.<br><br>But nope.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, you just suck at finding raws.</br>  <br> blacks overleveled <br> dust in the whites everywhere <br>Keep trying.</br></br></br>  <br> destroyed screentone gradient <br> thinks it's overleveled because he destroyed the page with sharpening and thinned out all of the lineart <br><br>You can comment when you've actually been able to preserve screentones, shitter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you could tell me what a histogram is.</br>  <br>What you said here  was right but you're exaggerating a lot, and  is right too. You've really destroyed the blacks, look back at the raw.</br>  <br>I'd hate to see what you think a good magazine clean looks like.</br>  <br> refuses to provide proof <br>Obviously just shitposting.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off amateurs. The topaz image has so much sharpness applied that the original screentones have been mashed into moire patterns.<br>Topazfags will defend the far right and they will be wrong every time because they fucked all the tones.</br></br></br>  <br> can't provide an answer that would be a sentence at the most, while expecting me to work on actual raws <br><br>I don't need to say more because those with any understanding of cleaning already know I'm right.</br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned with topaz. Find a flaw.<br>http://a.uguu.se/pgrbcz.png<br><br>Pic related is my settings.</br></br></br></br>  <br> back to posting reaction images <br>Okay, shitposter, enough is enough.<br>And how do you not realize that if your question can be answered by the first result on Google it's something you shouldn't have to ask. It's not a test of what anyone knows, because they could just google it and copy the answer.</br></br></br>  <br> Using clean 3 at that resolution. </br>  <br>You destroyed the screentone on the far left of the second panel and all the other tones of that lightness. gg fuck off</br>  <br> And how do you not realize that if your question can be answered by the first result on Google it's something you shouldn't have to ask. It's not a test of what anyone knows, because they could just google it and copy the answer. <br><br>I'm aware of that. That's why I expected you to be able to answer such a low effort question.</br></br></br>  <br>Calm down, I don't like Topaz being used for tank scans either and I even said you were right, no need to get upset. All I'm saying is that you overleveled the blacks.</br>  <br> take all screentones on the page <br> destroy all of their gradients and create moire patterns everywhere from a raw that had none <br> "you're exaggerating a lot" </br></br></br>  <br><br>You're wrong, and no about fake replies, or using leet speak, or meme text will change that.<br><br>State your posts clearly and articulate yourself with examples/proof.<br>This image the raw and cleaned version under a 235 black dusting leveling layer. As you can see, nothing was destroyed.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You're retarded. Here's the comparison. You leveled your whites too much while underleveling your blacks and thus the lightest screentones on the page are far too light. Here's an actual comparison. <br> P.S. you can call samefag all you want but it won't help you <br><br><br>Fucking disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and for good measure, here is your topaz'd page scaled down. Just look at what you've done to the screentones, it's sad. That corner on the second panel sure is missing its screentone right about now.</br>  <br> "Now THIS is fucking bait." <br>I'd say you were exaggerating. Sure there are problems, but it's not exactly as if they've brought out something that looks like it was done by Imperial scans or shit like that. You were getting pretty angry about it as well, which made it sound like you were making it more of a big deal than it is. That or you're insecure and have to angrily declare how awful any flaw you find is to assert your superiority, whilst refusing to acknowledge and work towards improving your own flaws. Anyway, I've got to get some sleep, if this thread is around later hopefully you'll have learned how to level properly.</br></br>  <br>Back when "Daiz's format" was being discussed that same format had popped up. The problem is that it can cause various issues when parsing filenames. We went over pretty much every edge case to make sure that filenames could be parsed accurately without making assumptions that may not hold true for all files. By rejecting a better naming scheme for your own inferior one you are an asshole that makes things more difficult for everyone else. As someone that has had to try to parse out data from all of those other shitty naming schemes, I hate you.</br>  <br><br>How did I do?</br></br>  <br>A magnificent work.<br>Remember to add a good and bulky watermark and you're ready for internet publishing.</br></br>  <br>All kinds of problems.<br>Blurry, too small, details in the finer tones are gone, much more.<br><br><br><br>You do realize there is nothing missing, right? You are either just saying things to avoid admitting you're wrong, or the contrast on your monitor is too high.<br> 1500 <br>Oh, you're that shitposter. I don't know why I even bothered.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> just don't use it for tank raws <br>Surface blur and topaz are good for paper/dust removal if you have decent scans with 600dpi and more. At that resolution they can't destroy anything important.</br></br>  <br>Sorry, but your page is fucked. The darks are too light and lights are too light.  False flagging samefag isn't going to help you. </br>  <br>Friendly reminder to myself and others, to not reply to shitposters.</br>  <br>This thread would have no discussion otherwise.</br>  <br> can't level <br> can't resize <br> can't edit <br> monitor not calibrated properly <br> assblasted that his shit going outed for being shit <br> uses the "I'm going to leave now but I'm right" move <br>I ain't even mad this nigga is sad</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has this been scanlated yet?  Well apparently Inari Konkon is completely translated on Bookwalker. And scanlators haven't touched it for like more than half a year. I wonder if they did a reasonable job. It can't be worse than the shit Shoujo Sense put out.  <br>kiraboshi</br>  Why are scanlation threads so autistic?    <br>Not a lot more autistic than the rest of /a/ threads.</br>  <br>It's just this one.</br>   the shitposter who made this thread is not going to let it die until it reaches the bump limit <br>I can't wait for all the page 10 bumps</br>  <br>You obviously haven't actually been to the previous ones.</br>  <br>The last one was really good.</br>  If I want to learn to typeset and a bit of redrawing what do I need? Are there any good and/or update and relevant tutorials anywhere? My specific goal is to typeset Yokohama Kaidaishi Kikou from chapter 101 onwards using the tank scans from the french group Iscariote and the english translation from whatever group did the magazine scans.  <br>And adding to this, what are some of the more common fonts used by typesetters? And where do they find good fonts?</br>  <br>1 decent thread out of 6+ others with GIMP vs PS threads. It sure isn't 'just this one' you filthy liar.</br>  <br> what do I need <br>To avoid these threads.<br>Use Google instead.

I'm using the clone stamp tool now, but that takes fucking ages, although the result is pretty good.  <br> Clone tool </br>  <br>Make your own pattern.</br>  <br> Patience </br>    <br> Sorry </br>  <br>Depends on pattern. CAF, clone, or both. There's not much choice in it.</br>  <br> 1663 </br>  <br>This isn't for scanlations but I think the naming format the guy who put together the CoR in the DJT thread is great for raws. It's pretty straight forward: [name of series]_[volume number]_[file number]<br><br>Why do people put in [group] and [ch]? Don't most groups usually throw in an extra page at the start or end of the volume saying who did it? Chapters seem a bit redundant given whoever is reading it already knows, surly. Seems like redundant information obscuring what people need to know to keep up reading: the exact file and where to find it in their library. <br><br>Never got into reading scans which probably explains any presented ignorance. It's good that these threads are here, though. Interesting to read about the process you guys go through.</br></br></br></br></br>  read the guide buyfag.moe  I hope someone is recording this Cinderella girls.

I fear for seven.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what's wrong with your screencap?</br>  Do we have a release date for Glorious Break yet?  <br>I always wonder how do those things work. Besides that, Micha's jet drills were cool.</br>  <br>Got a message on Steam and apparently my computer thought that was too much to handle and MPC proceeded to shit itself. Even going back to earlier points in the episode didn't fix it</br>   shitty Hibiki going "hurr it's my Gungnir, give it back, you can't have it" to Maria <br>Not only is she a bitch for pulling that after Maria risked her life to save both her and her dumbass friends, but isn't the Gungnir she has now the one that Maria gave to her at the end of season 2? What a cunt.</br>  <br>I hope Shirabe's charmpoint will be a closeup of her cunt.</br>  <br>It's fine when Hibiki does it though because she had a depressing emo childhood.</br>  <br><br>Since Kirika's transformation included pretty much everything of her body, I presume it will be the same for Shirabe. I'm expecting a focus on her butt though.</br></br>  <br>Bullshit. Tsubasa and Chris went through a lot more than she has, and they don't act like whiny hypocritical bitches.</br>  <br>They're also not mentally retarded.</br>  <br>True enough. Miku needs to fuck some sense into Hibiki already.</br>  Why is Kirika's transformation so much lewder than Chris' and Tsubasa's?  <br> wanted to post the "Let Me Tell You Why That's Bullshit" caption <br> I didn't save it <br> Even though I was the one who thought of it in the first place <br><br>Ha ha time for sudoku.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm thrilled that Miku managed to pull Hibiki's head out of her ass enough to explain to her that she's been saving people with the Symphogear by fighting since she got it. She doesn't have to kill them with it, she can just punch them till they're not a threat and then try to talk to them. I'm amazed that Hibiki couldn't figure this out on her own through simple observation.</br>  I wonder how Nana feels about current Bikki. She could probably relate.  <br>Because Chris and sword don't need time for lewds.<br>Kirika on the other hand needs to lewd it up for   the dual transformation with Shirabe. </br></br>  <br><br><br>Shirabe henshin when</br></br></br>  <br>most likely episode 6.</br>  <br><br>Surprise, people have different personalities, different talents, different faults.<br>Just because one person deals well with something doesn't mean everyone can.<br>Chris and Tsubasa are certainly more resilient than Hibiki, but without Hibiki's positive traits and power nothing of what they achieved together could have been achieved.</br></br></br></br>  Guy working his way through season 2, just hit Genjurou singing the goddamn Police Story theme and Yuka Iguchi insert song.<br><br>About damn time this season got good-ish.</br></br>  <br>nothing belongs to you</br>  <br> but without Hibiki's positive traits and power nothing of what they achieved together could have been achieved. <br>Nanoha would have gotten it done in half the time with fewer casualties and would have solved everyone's emotional issues while she was fighting.</br></br>   Micha's face when you force your dick inside her non existent ass.   <br>The last disc of the soundtrack on the last BD.</br>  When do the BDs go up for pre-order? Also anyone else going to try to go to Symphogear Live?  Is there an updated list of keywords for this season yet, or are they just translated randomly throughout the threads?  <br>It looks like she has little heart-shaped pupils.</br>  <br>Nanoha's magic is not lethal so she's no reason to be afraid of accidentally killing someone. And why did you bring in someone in an entire different show with an entire different setting here?</br>  <br>Nanoha is Nanoha, Hibiki is Hibiki.<br>Hibiki has had troubles in every season, she was never intended to be a Mary Sue and that's good, Mary Sues are boring as fuck.<br>Are you judging the characters depending on how well they perform to achieve an overall desired outcome the best and most efficient way possible?<br>If you do that, Symphogear might actually be the wrong show for you.</br></br></br></br>  So, why they keep using heavenrend instead of Ame no Habakiri?  <br>It's not like Hibiki survived something she should not survive, which then caused her and her family a lot of suffering. Something like that would probably fuck her mentally, but thankfully that didn't happen, so comparing her to Nanoha totally makes sense.</br>  <br>They like seeing us get mad.</br>  <br>It's either because they want to be consistent or want to tease you.

There can even be good videogame adaptations, but it's not something that you would normally expect.<br><br>If the vampire is just an old school motherfucker it can be okay. If there's a vampire girl in an ensemble cast like Pokaan it doesn't count as a flag. If the vampire is the protagonist then it's a massive red flag for angst, homoeroticism and edginess.

Do you think the pure innocent waifus in anime are realistic? What about tsunderes, yanderes, any cliche archetype? Are girls typically like that? No, it's a fantasy created to appeal to a male audience. Men don't necessarily want smart, competent females as either characters or real people. They want pretty, kind, females, which is fine in real life but creates bland as fuck characters. I'm not sure how your examples are supposed to help your argument, they are good characters regardless of how realistic they are.</br>  <br> OP is russian </br>  <br>what if they put an different angle on that<br>like if the guy has paranoid schizophrenia , and can only interpret a bunch of girls suddenly taking an interest in him as part of some conspiracy against him.</br></br>  <br><br> What is Legend of the Galactic Heroes? </br></br>  <br>Now that could be interesting.

How would the show be entertaining anyway? Are we going to fuck over the girls? Otherwise, either girls just make MC miserable and that's that or MC is Chad, which you will also complain about.<br><br>It does make me wonder though, what strengths are there in a female character? Besides sex, what can they do a male cannot? They are constantly portrayed as being more caring and understanding but we know that's bullshit. What unique personality or perspective do they bring in a story?</br></br></br></br>  <br> which is fine in real life <br>That's the reason why real females are generally dumb, entitled scum, Because no one expects anything other than beauty from them. Men on the other hand are conditioned to be smart, competent, to know right from wrong. You know, everything females can't be because everybody mollycoddles them which results in obnoxious, dumb, lazy cunts waiting for men to fix everything they broke.<br><br> they are good characters <br>No. They are not.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Females can be caring, just because your mother wasn't doesn't mean they all aren't.</br>   Great production values with all star cast <br>It's always a sign that they blew their budget and will look very bad soon enough.</br>  <br>Tension in action shit, since they are weaker so logically fight scenes should be more tense for them.<br>Of course thanks to feminists being responsible for shitty untouchable mary sue trope we can't have that too, but it works in theory.</br></br>  <br>it was better than tamako, knk, and hyouka certainly.</br>   it's made after 2000 and it's not a continuation of old series/based on old manga   <br> For all the bait, how would a show with "realistic" girls be enjoyable? <br>People enjoy Jinrui and Watashi is an unlikable dumb cunt just like real females.</br></br>  <br>What?

She wants to fuck Souma's dad, but doesn't know he's Souma's dad, so she'll probably want to fuck Souma too once she's realizes. Only Ameritits and Moeblob have shown any romantic interest in Souma so far, and Moeblob only just recently.  I wonder what "Have you worshiped Erina-sama today yet" anon thinks about this.  <br>Moeblob is more like, admiration. Ameritits is head over heels about Souma tho.</br>  Shit scans never.  Wait, is Erina actually the official love interest of the MC?<br><br>I thought it would be Tadokoro, because she's cliched enough to make it work. And you know how the Japanese love their cliches.</br></br>  <br>That one looks great.

Erina a shit. Megumi is the only actual perfect candidate for Souma, and Meat is 10/10 breeding stock. Why waste your time with a subpar bitch who wants to fuck your dad?</br>  Why care about Erina if Tadokoro is so much better?  <br>There is no official love interest. All girls in this series can be considered a love interest. The most popular girl will win.</br>  <br>  Liking Meat </br>  Right now Erina respects his skill butt hates his style and methods and goes full spaghetti when talking to him. But unlike in the election she is in full "you are never allowed to fail ever" mode because he wormed his way into minor cooking fame.  <br> All girls in this series can be considered a love interest <br> All girls <br>Really anon?</br></br></br>  <br>She's actually developing at a really nice rate. In the latest arc she manages to have a conversation with Soma without being a bitch, she was even somewhat helpful. It helps that Hisako (due to plot reasons) goes wingman mode for Soma. I think the turn is being made very believable.</br>  <br>A Fumio-san ending is coming. I can feel it.</br>  <br> All girls <br>No.</br></br>  <br>I like Megumi better than Erina but the chemistry and interactions Erina has with Souma is more entertaining for me.</br>  <br>This. It will take many moons.</br>  <br> All girls </br>  anyone actually want to discuss the manga instead of devolving into the usual best girl/ takumi takumi shitposting?    <br><br>It's a Jump manga. Just by being the poster girl she has a 99 percent of winning. Although at the current pace, It'll be a while for anything romantic to happen.</br></br>  <br> All girls in this series can be considered a love interest <br>We read the same manga?</br></br>  <br> Ryoko wants the Smokebowl. <br> Yuuki doesn't care. <br> Alice will probably get Ryou   or Hayama <br> Hisako, Houjou and Nao are bro tier. <br> all girls. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Nisekoi is Jump's, too <br> Tadokoro = Onodera <br> Erina = Chitoge <br><br>I see.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   muh MEHgumi getting friendzoned   <br> Nisekoi: Cooking Edition <br><br>Excepting the fact that Chitoge is a huge bitch <br>And that Tadokoro admires Souma but doesn't love him deeply or anything   Yet  </br></br></br></br>  No one will win, you fools. Have you learned nothing?  <br>*Isn't<br>Fuck me</br></br>  <br>The author said someone will win.</br>  Doesn't seem like anything definitively romantic will happen ever. It'll probably end with some generic timeskip ending where the girls welcome Souma back from some world training thing.<br><br><br>She definitely loves him. She's had a few of those "why did Souma-kun just flash through my mind and why is my heart going doki doki" moments already.</br></br></br>    <br>only two girls have romantic interest in him at the moment, and Meat was a bitch at the beginning. So you are rooting for Kurase. Interesting choice.</br>  <br>My feelings are so hurt that I guess I'll stop posting forever.</br>  <br>  She definitely loves him <br>The author says otherwise</br></br>  <br>Gonna need a link to something dude.</br>  I need proofs that display souma's skills as a lolimancer.  <br> She definitely loves him. She's had a few of those "why did Souma-kun just flash through my mind and why is my heart going doki doki" moments already. <br>No (word of god)</br></br>  <br> jun　　　  will turn soumasexual soon enough</br>  <br> Oh, and during that talk they also mentioned Erina is not actually Souma's true route but just the first candidate for it (and that Ikumi has two older brothers, but I guess that's kinda trivial) <br> When they were talking about that topic they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br> What they did mention about Megumi is that she's not actually in love with Souma yet, that so far she just admires him <br><br>Source: Eru13, Casanova's translator.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask casanova translator</br>  <br>Around which chapter was this? Because this shit seems plain as day.</br>  <br>Post Autumn Election's</br>  True route is  Takumi's boypussy   <br> When they were talking about that topic they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br>So...aka I'll choose the ship when I need to end the series. I hope my fans enjoy the wars and keep reading my shit until then.</br></br>  <br>Souma lost his chance  now that's gigganigga's </br>  <br>And you'll still read it every week. Those dicks!</br>  <br>More like, Erina is the default, but I can change my mind whenever I want to and pick candidate #2 or #3 or whichever.</br>  Erina a shit.<br><br>Worse than Emi and Kirino.</br></br>  Where are shit scans at? Even black clover gets translated quicker than SnS why?  <br>this<br><br>why are people assuming that Megumi has a romantic interest on Souma?</br></br></br>  <br>We're always the last one to get translations. At least we don't need to wait until Monday for Viz  sometimes. </br>  <br>To be fair, it's basically a given that both she and Erina will eventually.<br><br>Unlike what some people think though, I don't believe Tsukuda will stack more girls in though. The series has a bunch of other good looking, talented guys. Unlike harem series which tend to have a passable MC and ugly, useless, or super perverted side guys to try to make sense of all the girls liking one guy instead of having different tastes in guys.</br></br></br>  I "root" for Megumi to elevate the levels butthurt when their delusions are outright denied.  <br>It literally says chapter 61 on the scan</br>  <br>I know his phrasing is odd, but he's asking when jump festa was, which another anon already answered.</br>  We'll never get scans of this, right?  <br> during that talk <br>Was this an interview? Can I read/watch it somewhere?</br></br>  <br>Is it new? Because maybe. We've been getting more scans lately.</br>  <br>Yes, it was at Jump Festa. <br>https://mangahelpers.com/forum/show<wbr>thread.php/2999410-Shokugeki-no-Som<wbr>a-103-Discussion-104-Predictions/pa<wbr>ge12<br>Read Eru13's posts.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>It will be out at Comiket 88.</br>  <br> The most popular girl will win. <br><br>So Erina then?<br><br>She basically disappeared for like 60 chapters (or however long the Fall arc was) and still beat every other girl by a good margin.</br></br></br></br></br>  So while we are still stuck waiting for a translation, in this arc, we still need to learn what Kuga's deal with Tsukasa is, what Eizan and Rindou are up to, and who the mysterious figure Souma gave a key to is, right?  <br> they also mentioned Erina is not actually Souma's true route but just the first candidate for it <br> they only made it clear that the girl who Souma will end up with isn't set on stone yet <br>Literally what else can they say? "Oh yeah, Erina is going to win the Soumab owl, she was going to win from the very beginning." They would have killed the manga if they said it outright because as we all know, WSJ mangafags are filthy shippers who throw autistic shitstorms when their waifu loses. Noncommittal answers are the norm in these sorts of interviews. Shit, Shokugeki is only in its second year.<br><br><br> that argument <br>Holy shit, this is why I avoid forums.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a Jump manga.

As for being best prodigy in the school, yeah, probably. The school has apparently never had a first year as strong as her.</br>  <br>Next year Isshiki or maybe Yugi will get First seat, not Erina.</br>  <br> only 10th seat <br>Reminder that she's probably better than Kuga and Eizan but got 10th because seniority.<br><br>And that white hair looks terrible on Tsukasa, they should've made it silvery like Alice's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that looks beautiful from this angle</br>  <br> Isshiki <br>almost certainly<br><br> Yugi <br>don't fuck with me, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this</br>  <br> Yugi <br> will probably be raped by Souma within the year, if not in this festival <br>Right.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Isshiki or Yugi next year. I don't want Yugi to be First Seat but who knows.</br>  <br><br> implying it won't be based Aizen </br></br>  <br>wrong manga m8.</br>  <br>I'm glad you realized that Orihime will win in Bleach.<br><br>Not many people know.<br><br><br>I wonder how much this costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn that's amazing.</br>  <br>I wonder who is stronger, Aizen or Isshiki.</br>   you can finally make her taste your cum   <br>ALL ME.</br>  <br>Glad she won she was best girl and his childhood friend was shit.</br>  https://mega.nz/#F!6oBxSK6R!WE_h49q<wbr>ll-J-NjqTuJ1kaw<br><br>Recipe pages.<br><br>Was to lazy to do a proper crop and edit, if anyone want to do all that hard work, there you have it.<br>Still missing some pages, had some trouble scanning them.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>Orihime is cute.<br><br>It looks even better up close</br></br></br>  <br>Drop it. Also please consider getting some taste when watching anime.</br>  <br> dat cute smug face <br> dem thighs </br></br>  <br>She wasn't entirely dissappeared though. She was there for the most chapter on the election but mostly just a few panels and that's it. She always appeared when soma is on the stage, and when she was asked by soma to taste his stew. But yeah, she wasn't as much of an important character that time</br>  <br>I asked earlier but this is her 5th figure isn't it? Also, I see they put up a space on the official site for Meat's figure but they have no image up yet. I remember seeing the prototype for hers and Megumi's though.</br>  <br>Read the manga faggot<br><br>She doesn't want to fuck Souma's dad you illiterate, she was amazed by his cooking and wanted to taste it as a child</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br><br>We laugh at Aizen because he hadn't backed up his threats from the Autumn Election, but keep in mind Mimasaka was only one of many goons he has. And we know he's great with business. Souma must not underestimate him.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm here and I think this is amazing.<br><br>Have you worshipped Erina today, anon?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, based anon. Will you scan the missing pages later?</br>  <br> doesn't want to fuck <br> blushes every time she sees / hears about him <br> sleeps with a photo of him <br><br>Okay, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina will get 4th - 5th seat by her second year.</br>  <br>Yep, gonna post them tomorrow.</br>  <br> Hotgluing figures <br>Fuck no that damages them.</br></br>  <br>I'm usually not a buyfag, but I may just have to get this.</br>  <br>Thanks. Now we just need to translate this and the novels  translations soon. </br>  <br>He's also up to something during the festival it seems.<br><br><br>Honestly won't be surprised if she hits 3rd. With 5 people graduating, 5th would appear to be a given though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was said last thread or thread before last, but not every emotion a woman feels for a man has to be lust, you depraved degenerate.<br><br>He's her favorite cook and she wants to taste his food, it's called admiration.</br></br></br>  <br> anime only <br>It's taken about 130 chapters but she's finally defrosting from maximum tsun to casual tsun. <br>She'll be full dere in about 500 episodes, just you wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to taste her D.</br>  <br>I don't think you understand human emotion. She's shown all the signs of wanting to fuck him, all that is left is for her to meet him again.</br>  <br>Erina has no such thing</br>  Honestly I want Hisako to win because out every female character in this series she has the best chemistry with Soma. Better than Megumi's and definitely Erina. You cannot say other otherwise. I mean when both Hisako and worked together they actually looked like real couple keeping a restaurant together.<br><br>But seeing this is a Shonen manga best girl will not win and worst girl will win fucking Erina. In the millionth chance Hisako wins the Somabowl I would shit my pants.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but since it was directly addressed in the manga, she does not. Alice even asked her if she had any interest in dating this mysterious man, and Erina was confused about why on earth she would want to do that.</br>  <br>Hisako won't even fall for him.</br>  <br>Do you think she might try to rise up on her first year?</br>  <br>Eh, more like he stirred up Giga and just let him do his thing. Eizan's been pretty passive since his big threat and his personal showdown with Soma probably won't happen for a long time.<br>Especially since Kuga is probably going to wipe the floor with Soma in an actual shokugeki after Soma wins the right to d-d-d-duel him with his festival shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>No. She's a rival to be impressed, nothing more.</br>  <br>Alright c'mon, you can't be serious, fucking Hisami is more relevent than Hisako, why would she even be in the soumabowl to begin with, she was a hater of souma, she was there to represent the hatred of the student body for Souma, he showed her he wasn't just talk and helped her out without thinking about her as a obstacle or a rival, you can be delusional as a meat-fag, but Hisako, c'mon Anon.</br>  <br>Are you actually retarded?<br><br>Erina is only now being gradually introduced to the concepts of love and relationships, but you want to imply she wants to fuck Saiba?<br><br>She even asked Alice why she would ever date him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soma has chemistry with all the grills, but Hisako a best because she's the perfect interim between Dereless and Goomy.</br>  <br> chemistry <br><br>You're delusional. Contempt is not chemistry.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is Hisami?</br>  <br> false flagging <br> muh chemistry <br>You're probably one of those bandwagonfags who didn't give a shit about her before she was named. This manga hasn't even hit 150 chapters and they're all in their first year, developments happen slowly.<br><br>Christ, I hate faggots like you who proclaim the "literally perfection" girl as best and MC's fated waifu when they've no reason nor room to improve. Girls like Hisako are wonderful in their own way but it won't make for a satisfying story in the long run. Also, she would probably want Erina to win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I took a random generic Japanese name to emphasize my point</br>  <br>To be fair she was completely clueless about love at that point.</br>  <br>Dish anon, this a christian board.</br>  <br>I don't know if she has interest in the shokugeki for a seat method. She's definitely been doing the increasing her resources, influence, and standing part though. We'll have to wait and see.</br>  <br>Hisako would be the ultimate Serina shipper</br>  <br><br>Are you serious, I thought you meant Isami.</br></br>  <br>I-I knew that anon</br>  <br> Soma has chemistry with all the grills <br>This</br></br>  <br> probably thinks Erina is best girl <br><br>Even with improvements she's still going to be shit. Pretty much every girl is better than her.</br></br></br>  I imagine we'll have to wait until monday for confirmation on Sugita voicing Eizan.<br><br>He should be in the next ep on the phone with that woman, right?</br></br>  <br>Oh, I might have done that subconsciously</br>  <br>The Erina haters have arrived</br>  <br>I knew it was you when this was posted <br><br> Even with improvements she's still going to be shit <br>What does this even mean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the very 1st</br>  Am I hallucinating but where the fuck did all these Erinafags come from?  <br>It's the same deluded fuckstick, no one sane likes Erina or wishes her well.</br>  <br>Glad I waited, almost bought the bikini one.</br>  <br><br> being stuck in 2013 </br></br>  <br>will souma get the first seat?</br>  <br>You must be new here</br>  <br>He is a stupid anon that can only look at Erina for what she was in the first chapter and will ignore all development. It kinda sucks but it seems like the wrong people finally picked the anime up from their backlog and are now starting shitty waifuwars. There goes the decent threads this had.</br>  <br>Too bad for you, Erina is going to win the Soumabowl, there were more hint for this dropped troughout the whole manga than foodgasm, I'm a Yoshinofag ( that fucking exist ) but you have to be autistic to not see it</br>  <br>We've always had the largest fanbase<br><br>It's just there's tons of false flaggers and othergirlfags are more aggressive towards Erina.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe his third year. Second year he'll be seat 3 and be raging that he's not sitting in at least his dad's chair already.</br>  <br>No until 3rd year</br>  <br>  hurr durr they don't like what I like they must be insane <br>Sure anon</br></br>  What's the problem of not getting the Soumabowl?<br><br> All the boys are best boys </br></br>  <br>MMMMM yes imagine the fat loads she going to received.</br>  My old HDD crashed and I lost my Erina folder<br><br>Help me rebuild fags</br></br>  <br><br>Samefag. Go take your crazy meds, loser.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> all these figures of Erina <br> not even ONE in her cutie chef outfit with toque <br><br>Why even cook?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not the purple swimsuit <br>Damn it.</br></br>  <br>Souma will make it into the E10 for 2nd year, but he'll be in the bottom half along with any other non Erina first year who makes it.</br>  <br>Correct.</br>  <br>Fuck off Erinafag. I've liked Hisako ever since she cut the turtle's neck off. So saying I've liked her just now is stupid. The only reason she was like that in the beginning was because she was stuck with Erina.</br>  <br>Unlike LN harem MCs, Souma is actually a great guy all around. OP cook, witty, friendly to everyone, fun-loving. Even the guys love hanging out with him.<br><br><br>Sorry to disappoint you.</br></br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>You could be right. He could be down at #6 or something, but the butthurt would be more immense if he made it to #3 and his dad finds out and fucks with him about it.</br>    <br>This<br>She doesn't consider fine to me also but is getting better recently<br> Try convince me that she couldn't become actual best girl after beaten by Soma if by chance </br></br></br>  <br> Meat still relevant.  <br><br>This is the last time we'll see her in a popularity poll, right?</br></br></br>  <br>You're late today</br>  <br> with any other non Erina first year who makes it <br>Hayama,Ryou and Alice?</br></br>  <br> Non-Erinafags confirmed for full blown /a/utists <br><br><br> You will never teach your kid how to cook <br><br> Because nobody will ever likes you </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't believe it, you're always here to faithfully spam those renders.<br><br><br> reading comprehension </br></br></br></br>  Holy fuck are Erinafags cancerous. I just want a decent discussion about cooking not all this waifu shit of Erina.  <br>Hopefully.</br>  <br>Doubt it. Big tits are usually all that's required to keep a Nip's attention.</br>  <br>Not really she seems to have gotten a power boost. Depends on the author.</br>  <br><br> 15 years old <br> looks like she's heading beeline for chirstmas cake bracket </br></br></br>  <br>yeah, still no chef outfit. If I remember correctly, the figures are<br><br>bikini<br>uniform sitting<br>uniforms standing, arms crossed (this was sold as a set with a Souma one)<br>standing and offering a dish<br>and now this one sitting on the throne.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ can you seriously fuck off the only retard being cancerous is you.</br>  <br><br>Didn't someone say they were going to scan the cookbook? What happened with that?</br></br>  <br> HISAKO IS BEST GIRL <br> MEAT IS BEST GIRL <br> MEGUMI IS BEST GIRL <br> I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ALDINI <br> Erinafag sure are cancerous </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br><br> complaining about waifufags on /a/ <br> /a/  <br> a board about anime/mango where waifufaggotry is an integrated part of the board's community <br><br>That's like complaining about paragraphs in /lit/<br><br>Then go to </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where were you guys when Spice won the Alicebowl?  <br>I uploaded some on imgur before the fall<br><br>More pls</br></br></br>  <br> I just want a decent discussion about cooking <br>Yes, we all know Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga.<br><br>Honestly though, the cooking part of recent chapters has been covered over and over. And in this arc it isn't cooking so much as business strategies and self-marketing.<br><br><br> I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ALDINI <br>This is a thing now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am enlightened. Thank you.</br>    <br>I am strangely attracted to this idea. The skin contrast alone would be erotic.</br>  <br> I just want a decent discussion about cooking <br>Go make a Hells Kitchen or Oishinbo thread, then.</br></br>  <br> &gt;This is a thing now? <br><br>This wouldn't even surprise me if it were<br><br><br>I have anime ones if you want</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Erina be the type to accept running a Home Family Restaurant with Soma? That's why I can't see Erina winning the Somabowl because she isn't the type to drop her status and everything to run a family restaurant with someone.<br><br>Someone who accepts that and together run a little Family restaurant will win the Somabowl</br></br></br>  <br>Boy do I not like that Indian. Kuro and Takumi are fine, so it's not like I want only Souma as the male character, but man do I not like brown town guy.</br>  <br>Yuuki and Ryoko want the Souma from an investment standpoint, assuming he'll grow up into a man like Jouichirou.</br>  <br>In that case, Megumi has this in the bag.</br>  <br>N-n-no<br><br>S-s-stop<br><br>Any Erina is fine for me</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit,Currynigger a shit</br>  <br><br><br> someone bash on Megumi with "mehgoomy"  <br> no one bats an eye and that one megumibro tries to talk it out but gets circlejerked the fuck out <br> someone bashes Nikumi  <br> everyone circlejerks that she's irrelevant and one-dimensional when the nikubros tend to keep to themselves and not shit on the thread <br> bash on Hisako <br> everyone calls her "lel erina second banana" and treat her like a consolation prize <br> someone bashes Erina <br> OMG MEHGOOMY FAGS ANIMEONLYFAGS WHY ARE YOU SO BLIND SHES PERFECT I WANT TO CUM INSIDE HER SHES LE DERE IN LATER CHAPTERS YOU SECONDARY FUCK REEEEEEEE <br><br>Truly they are the cancerous waifufags in SnS. I really wish Tsukuda ends up BTFO them by letting her lose the Somabowl. Sadly, that won't be the case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought most of /a/ liked cocky faggots? What happened?</br>  <br>This strategy meeting was after the second day, right? I wonder how they've turned things around now that we are reaching the 4th. Where do you guys think this team will rank at the end?</br>  <br> Ryoko  <br>She want smoke D ick </br></br>  <br>Her settling down and just being a humble chef of the people would be some good character resolution, but it would definitely feel like she's squandering her talent. <br><br>Then again, so is Souma's dad. And he still goes on little outings across the world every so often, so that could work too.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the guy is a supreme douche with no sign of slowing his douchetrain down anytime soon, so there's that.</br>  <br>Report and ignore.</br>  <br><br>I thought Souma wanted to surpass his father? And Saiba is on top of the world (literally), serving VIPs and converting monks in NY with his god-tier cooking. I don't see Souma returning to the family restaurant anytime soon, he's too ambitious for that.<br><br>Even if he does, Erina would probably be dere enough to follow him there.  Her backstory in the LN says she's always wanted to see the outside world and is often bored being surrounded by beautiful things all the fucking time. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Megumi carries the hopes and dreams of her town. She is the heir to her mom's ryoukan at the center of her little town.<br><br>No, whoever ends up with Megumi will have to go there and run her inn. She won't abandon her community. She's attending tootsuki for all of them.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, you asked for it.</br>  <br>Ryoko's got decent taste. I'm terrified Shun's not going to make it, though.</br>  <br>That looks nothing like her.<br><br><br>Judging from pixiv and toranoana, C88 will see quite an increase in SnS doujins. It's a pity the Leonora being orgied by the three Autumn finalists was just a single image, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When it's the main character sure, as you are obviously supposed to root for them, but that doesn't apply so much to tertiary characters.<br><br>Although for me it's sort of like how I hate Superman. Characters that are just born with godly abilities are boring and dumb, characters like Souma that are evidently pretty average talent wise, if Jouichiro is correct, but work their asses off to become good, are far more endearing.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny how half the tripe in that post weren't even true.</br>  <br>Stop it, anon. Alice already has Ryou.</br>  <br>Probably first, I mean come on this are the top 2 best and a top 8.</br>  <br><br>Then I'll give you some<br><br><br><br>Yea, reread the thread, Hisakofags are really smart people, not sarcasm, I swear.<br><br><br>At least cut the other side, to put her out of her misery<br><br>Can Erina live without her Nakirimandibles ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> AliceXRyouXSpice threesome doujins when? </br>  <br> Can Erina live without her Nakirimandibles ? <br>Of course not that's her trademark hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>For me he just isn't a very interesting character. And I did expect him to trump Hisako but what he said to her afterwards was mean and petty, even if it was true.<br><br><br> replying to it </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I would totally buy a love triangle between Alice, Hayama and Ryou if it was written with a humorous and not so serious take. Maybe have cute moments between them but at the end of the day, Alice is ultimately unaware that she's in a love triangle despite her being a tease. Have Hayama spill spaghetti and Ryou being whatever.<br><br>It could work as a comical one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Aldinis keeps the first place, for a change.</br>  <br>But the thing is her settling down to run a little Family Restaurant does not fit her character at all. Especially if we're looking at it at her standpoint. She literally has a huge fucking status through her family and has a over confident attitude. She wouldn't drop all that to run a Family Restaurant. Soma's Dad is different though because he doesn't have a huge wealthy as family that's status is huge.<br><br>Also Soma doesn't seem like a type that would run a huge Restaurant business, but a small Family Restaurant. The person to win the Somabowl will be someone who accepts that. <br><br> Childhood friend ends up winning </br></br></br></br></br>    Is there no chapter this week, or is it just slow?  <br>I just want Ryou/Alice doujins that starts with rape and ends with vanilla.</br>  <br> She literally has a huge fucking status through her family and has a over confident attitude. She wouldn't drop all that to run a Family Restaurant <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ydf<wbr>H7iuLR0I</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Don't bite to that, it's clear that he is here to start shitty waifuwars. Hisakofags have never been that aggressive it's obvious that's just a falseflag.</br>  <br> We'll never know how Ibusaki smoked that French restaurant out of bankruptcy <br>Stagiare arc was best arc but they should've showed more of the other students' training.</br></br>  <br>They've got several days lead, so it's possible. On Souma's end, he obviously can't do anything about Kuga's total sales. Those have become ridiculous at this point.</br>  <br>http://www.jifengi.com/5646<br>Shit scans never etc.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if something like this might happen. I am wondering why the author mixed them up.</br>  <br>Raws have been out since Friday.<br>It's an actual cooking chapter with Yugi possibly about to get rekt.</br></br>  <br>The obvious route is that second years will just occupy vacant seats without changing the order, meaning Nene would be 1st seat.<br><br>But Isshiki has been built up to have hidden hotblooded streak, and will be an obstacle Souma must overcome. Thus, he shall take 1st seat.<br><br>Yugi and Eizan are just side monsters in this vidya game.</br></br></br></br></br>     Everyone bickering on who's going to win the Somabowl with Erina, Megumi, Hisako, and etc <br><br> Childhood friend ends up winning in the end <br><br>I wouldn't even get mad because so many people would be BTFO.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying once Erina falls in love she won't forget about her status as the god's tongue <br> implying she wouldn't use her status as the god's tongue to make yukihira more popular than ever before <br><br>You have a poor grasp of the way stories and characters develop</br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 Alice just wanted Ryou to be friends with Hayama </br>  <br>Alice makes Hayama bearable, that's why.</br>  <br>Looks like they are setting it up for her to be with Erina in a lesbian relationship.</br>  <br>Wow, I didn't expect it to come with color pictures of the RL food, Morisaki sure works hard for this. Thank you anon.</br>  <br>He's so underutilized it makes me wonder why he's a character at all. I want to believe it's because he'll suddenly reveal himself as the Big Bad that Souma has to beat and just didn't pay any attention to until it was too late, but if it's going that route they're sure playing it close to the chest.</br>  <br>That works too.<br><br>This too.</br></br></br>  <br>You please the apostle of Erina</br>  <br>I will laugh so much if this happen.</br>  What are the odds that Souma doesn't win against Kuga in this arc? He'll sell enough to save himself from expulsion, but he also tastes defeat and retreats to lick his wounds while coming up with a new strategy.<br><br>The obvious development from this outcome would be him enlisting another Elite's help to improve himself and become truly Elite-tier. Erina is the most likely candidate he'll turn to, but I can also see Isshiki or another alumni stepping in. Or Momo, because she took 1st Place in the festival and hears about that crazy first-year who tried to take on Kuga. Maybe she'll come over curious and drop hints.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Doesn't Spice already have his senpai waifu?</br>    <br>Yeah, he'll most likely lose and use it as an opportunity to regroup and come back stronger.<br><br>Like how he wanted to get better after losing to Shinomiya</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he completely sonzoned.</br>  Souma Chemistry Tier:<br><br>Top tier (hobbies and sense of humor in common):<br>Nao<br><br>High tier (respect both ways):<br>Megumi, Hisako<br><br>Mid tier (play well together):<br>Alice<br><br>Low tier (Cunt who fails him when he gave her a foodgasm):<br>Erina<br><br>Dead in the water tier (One sided love, the kiss of death):<br>Mayumi, Meat<br><br>Are you even trying tier:<br>other girls</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My dick is confused but erect anyway.</br>  <br>I mean looking at it logically, yeah only the nondescript mob character girl he knew before Tootsuki and we still know little to nothing about can win. Nakiri has her tremendous status, Megumi is going back to her home for her own thing, and Nikumi is the heiress to a meat conglomerate herself. Those are the top 3 girls that stand a chance, so if it isn't them, it is no one, which is not the kind of ending anyone reading this is after.</br>  <br>Add your post number under the "Are you even trying tier".</br>  <br>I feel like the day by day ranking system was introduced to let Souma somehow win the last day, though of course, he loses overall.</br>  <br><br>There is still a chance that he will lose. I am just not so sure that he is going to lose right after he had a training arc.</br></br>    <br>Meant that they are setting Hisako to be with Erina.</br>  <br>I concur with this listing, though I still think Megumi's going to win it.</br>  <br>Souma litteraly became his Father after the stagiaire arc, there's a retarded chance that he get on the level of a Elite Seat</br>  <br>You sure don't give up. I think you should try a different fanbase.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>I want Megumi to go for the Isshikibowl.</br></br></br>  <br>They would make a good couple.</br>  <br> Isshiki and Megumi get married <br> Isshiki shows up naked at the altar <br> All the regrets of megumi </br></br></br>  <br>Too bad Tsukuda is playing with Megumi x Isami</br>  <br>Interesting to consider, though to be honest I haven't seen anyone I'd consider worthy of Isshiki.</br>  <br>&lt;Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga<br>If you want a romance manga you could read a romance manga.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather see him with Yuuki.

This is how it goes in series like this. Everything outside the main focus (food in this case) shouldn't be taken seriously.</br></br></br>  All girls are best girl.  <br>This is what I wish Tsukuda improves on. Both in stagiaire and festival arcs, he focuses only on Souma even though he has many secondary characters among which readers have found favorites. I think he should try to be less linear in the storytelling and show, actually show, other people's side story. That would make the manga longer too so more money for him. <br><br>So far he only shown glimpses of others with little payoff, like what is Megumi doing in the ryokan? Did Smoke manage to save his restaurant? What's the deal with buttbros? Same with the festival, we're almost at the fifth day but only Souma and Kuga's dishes have been shown. We get glimpses of Alice trio's trouble but not even shown their booth.<br><br>Tsukuda can capitalize on the characters he has made likeable, but he's not doing it enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's gone to festivals and stated that there will be a romantic ending.</br>  <br>especially takumi</br>  <br>I don't mind this outcome at all.</br>  I don't remember this. Is this from the novel?  <br>Sensei.<br><br>But she doesn't realize his feelings and sees him as a son.</br></br></br>  <br> His father basically says you'll reach your height when you cook for someone you love <br> Souma won't find a love because hurrr not a romance manga <br>Right, so it'll be some shitty ending where he never reaches his dads level, cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you not read the tourney arc? He develops a ton of characters there.</br>  <br>She's the forgotten childhood friend. The variant of the archetype that stays behind when the MC goes on a great adventure outside of their small world.<br><br><br><br>no, romance is a sub plot. And one that keeps to the background. Although sometimes people don't notice when it becomes relevant, like throughout the elections with Hayama and his "for Jun".<br><br><br><br>No, Souma actually is ending up with a girl. It's not a romance manga though, so it won't be the focus. The cooking and the competitions always will be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Souma is going to drop out before graduating with Erina traveling around the world, after some years they will get married and set their family restaurant. Megumi will happily work with his husband in their  trattoria  who happens to be right across Souma's restaurant.<br>Hisako decides to support them and becomes an employer for them.<br><br>Hayama becomes a teacher in Totsuki and still hangs out with Alice and Ryo the former being a icon of the molecular gastronomy and Kurokiba just feels comfortable supporting her and being by her side.<br>Smoke and Marui, with their waifus, associate and create a famous restaurant who has the buttbros as their main and most importants chefs. The restaurant being supplied with natural ingredients from Yuuki's and Isshiki's farm.<br><br>Isami is back in Italy living a normally life with Bianca and occasionally helping his brother when he needs.<br>Don senpai finally made meat accept him and he is now living in luxury.<br><br>All of them being stalked with the powerful duo of gigganigga and Nao.<br><br><br>Trust me, I'm Tsukuda's cousin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> romance <br> chapter 2 <br><br>Anon, I don't think you know what romance is. There was no romance displayed at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand what you're arguing against. You said it yourself, the MC will end up with a girl, it's just a matter of when/who.</br>  <br>Isami is fine too, he's kind and gentle but not a pushover.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128607080 <br> yamada-kun and the 7 witches <br><br> all girls good <br><br>The series with invisible witch Asuka. A genuinely unlikable person.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128607080 <br>Didn't you get range banned or something?<br><br><br> Marui <br> ever scoring <br>Other than that I like your scenarios.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meat and Don. What a power couple.<br><br>All of this seems somewhat likely, good on you anon.</br></br></br>  <br> Takumi not ending with Meat <br>Their love for Souma and their jobber status will pair them up.</br></br>  <br>You should go back and read exactly what was said, in specifically what was said to Souma, in chapter 2.</br>  <br> Croque Monseur <br>No, it's an original recipe.</br></br>  <br>The problem with this one is that he never knew, and Bianca moved away. And then they moved away to Japan. Even if they fly back home between school years to visit their parents, she won't be there.</br>  <br>I think that would amuse the uncles from her village instead. Isshiki seems like the type who'd enjoy going home to the warmth of countryside family life after the occasional highbrow business trip.</br>  <br>I can't even imagine what Marui would be like if he actually got laid.</br>  Which of the relevant named characters can Megumi beat in a Shokugeki?<br><br>As far as I see it, just about everyone beats her.</br></br>   300 posts <br> 60 posters <br><br>Damn the autism is on the rise today</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>He didn't. In the tournament arc, he just introduced them.</br>  <br> expecting love from porn+food the manga </br>  <br>I'm fine with this.</br>  <br>Didn't say it won't feature it to some degree. I'm reading the same thing you are, I know it's there. But will it be at the forefront? What reason have we been given so fat to believe that? <br><br><br>  It's not a romance manga though, so it won't be the focus. The cooking and the competitions always will be. <br>I agree. I doubt it'll be with generic ice princess trope, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takumi with Meat <br>Disgusting</br></br>  <br>What?<br><br>Did you really take that out of context?<br><br>Anon, that shows absolutely nothing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was in the top 8 in the finals, so she's probably better than most of PSD. Meat and Nao and Houjou too.<br><br><br>If you think this is autism, wait till you visit the Yahari threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It depends on what you mean by relevant named character. I mean, while the elite 10 and the election finalists are out of reach, I think Megumi would beat Meat, for instance.</br>  <br>Well of course he had to do that. Now he can start developing them, I guess my point was that he does show that he wants to focus on them just not all the time.</br>  <br>Wait he's indian I thought he was a nigga<br><br>Now I have a reason to like</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't know about Babbo Natale in Italy </br>  <br>Hojou,Nao,Yukki and Ryoko</br>  <br>I hope Jouichirou banned that customer.</br>  When will Ryouko get her time to shine?  <br>It's beautiful anon, I would love the double tsundere dynamic.</br>  <br>When she gets pregnant by smoke.</br>  <br> no custom about santa to begin with <br><br>what the fuck? they invented santa claus</br></br></br>  <br> megumi would beat meat <br>lewd</br></br>  <br>not that anon, but I have to say is disgusting as well.</br>  Reminder that there are people in this thread that think Erina, who didn't even know how to use a robe to cover herself as she changed, is sexually aware and wants Saiba inside of her  <br>when her cooking is stagnating and souma has to fix her like he fixed megumi and based hishoko</br>  <br> mangafox </br>  <br> mangafox </br>  <br>That would be the dutch, but yeah </br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br><br>Just went there to pull the page anons<br><br>I didn't have it saved</br></br></br></br>  <br> went there <br> there <br>That's the problem.</br></br></br>  <br>There are better places to do that in which you don't get shit quality images and a giant watermark, you ignoramus.</br>  <br>it began as roman tradition, with a different name but the same idea of a gift giving pope</br>  What's on her hand anons?   Nakiri   Souma    <br>I think she was a rejected design for Rindou or Nene.</br>  <br>You misspelled Smoke<br><br>And she'll be the one who does the fixing though, then with the new waifu powerup he challenges Isshiki to a Shokugeki</br></br></br>  <br> Soma and Erina getting Married  <br><br>Next you're going to tell me pigs are flying. Childhood friend will win the Somabowl. Watch, it will happen and I ain't even a supporter either.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like lotion.</br>  <br> He doesn't have Casanova, Viz, RAWs and full color chapters archived </br>  <br> You stole a picture. . .from THERE!?! </br>  <br>Why would she take his first name, and not family name?</br>  <br>Looks like semen.</br>  <br>Anon, are you alright?</br>  <br>Well, the celebration of Christmas comes from the Roman saturnalia. That's where we get the tree and the gift giving and all that. It's part of Christianities success in spreading by absorbing pagan traditions into the faith so as to not upset converts.<br><br>But santa goes back to sinterklaus.</br></br></br>  Erina definitely wants to fuck Souma's dad<br><br>Right guys?</br></br>  <br>Basically, there's a Santa Claus-esque tradition in every corner of Europe, that pre-dates Christmas as a holiday. Claiming there isn't one in Italy is just blatantly incorrect and the comic writer should be ashamed of his ignorance.</br>  <br> Ikumi has two older brothers <br><br>I want them to show up.</br></br></br>  <br> thinking that autist will do anything <br>he'll do nothing with anyone and realize that's his mistake too late</br></br>  <br>Gin's got a better chance of having Joichiro inside him than Erina does.</br>  Smoke gets Ryouko all to himself<br><br>Why even live</br></br>  <br>Forgot the fucking picture</br>  <br>I can't wait for her to discover that her idol is Souma's Dad.</br>  <br>Just another anon misinterpreting chapter 2.<br><br>It feels like this happens every thread.</br></br></br>  So in the end, we still don't know what business Jouichirou had at Tootsuki when he visited Souma. He wasn't seeing Gin, since he wasn't at the school. Could he have come to see Senzaemon?  <br>What a lucky motherfucker indeed. He better do something great to win her.</br>  <br> Could he have come to see Senzaemon? <br>Possibly he cooked for the Nakiri's after all.</br></br>  <br> Could he have come to see Senzaemon? <br>Maybe.</br></br>  Ryou x  Ryouko   <br>How cute. They could call their restaurant "Ryou's" and it matches them both.</br>  <br>What a impossible ship.</br>  What are the chances that I might get the tapestry from the first 4 volumes of the anime for a good price?  <br>Souma is a lolicon.<br>Momo-chan will win the Souma bowl.</br></br>  Hisako x  Soma <br><br>I know it ain't gonna happen but can't a man dream. I would protect that smile.</br></br>  That feel when Rindou is best girl despite not having said a word yet.  yukihira  tak umi  <br>That's even less likely than Erina winning, though not for the same reasons.</br>  <br> screams Yukihira at the mirror <br> suddenly blushes </br></br>  <br> 15 year old girl wants to a late 30s to early 40s man <br><br>What is this a hentai</br></br></br>  <br>I'll never understand why this is such a popular ship.<br><br>They've only spent, what, two chapters talking to each other?<br><br>Furthermore, Hisako supports Erina with every part of her soul. She would never, ever do anything contrary to Erina. It's somewhat obvious that Erina is developing feelings for Souma, Hisako most likely notices.<br><br>The only way for this ship to happen is for a (new) rift to form between Erina and Souma.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wants to fuck </br>  <br><br><br>You don't understand sarcasm or have much reading comprehension, do you?</br></br></br>  <br> fags getting married </br>  So what are the pairings /a/ mostly agree?  <br> I'll never understand why this is such a popular ship. <br>are you also dumb or just a faggot?</br></br>  <br>Erina x Hisako</br>  <br> Daily reminder <br> pic related foreshadows the winner of the Somabowl  <br> Hisako <br><br>Well I rest my case.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>With this series? Impossible to tell. Even the logical ones like Ryou X Alice are suspect.</br>  This is all smoke's<br><br>I want to fucking kill that guy like a cliche anime background character who gets upset when MC gets attention from women</br></br>  <br> I'll never understand why this is such a popular ship. <br><br>You must be a dumb nigger or a Erinafag if you don't understand.</br></br></br>  <br>soul travel back in time, became his mother, you know the pasta.</br>  so should shino know saiba?  <br>Only Ryou/Alice and Smoke/Ryoko.</br>  <br>Shinomiya x Hinako<br>Alice x Ryou<br>Smoke x Ryouko</br></br></br>  <br><br>Could you please explain? Apparently I'm a dumb faggot.<br><br>I guess people like unrealistic ships.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Know as in know of him? It's possible. Know as in actually met him seems less likely.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Also, I notice Daigo has a sweater tied around his waist like his chapter 7 appearance in addition to Shouji wearing his election arc t-shirt.</br></br></br>  <br> Alice x Ryou <br>He is too ugly for her.</br></br>  <br>You don't know that, she might find his Danish complexion delicious.</br>  <br>The actual ending won't nearly be as satisfying as all this, I bet.</br>  <br>I want a seinen drawn by Tosh about Jouichirou's travels post-Tootsuki.</br>  <br>But 15 year olds want older men all the time, particularly rich, handsome celebrities.</br>  <br> random anon's made up ending <br> satisfying  <br><br>Yeah if you were a Erinafag. I would rather take the childhood friend ending.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want one of Joichiro and Gin's adventures at PSD, all the way up to when Joichiro broke the news that he was leaving and why.</br>  <br>Do you even watch anime?</br>  <br>Reread the chapters and you'll see why people like Hisako x Soma ship. It has to do with their great chemistry and how they were able to connect together. It felt like they were a couple running a little family restaurant. It's not really hard to figure out anon.</br>  Is this how your better-adjusted siblings see you?  rip thread    <br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br>  <br>NANI KORE?</br>    <br>What if I am the better adjusted sibling</br>  <br>I knew you'd come!</br>  <br><br>Thank you for joining us today faglords.
