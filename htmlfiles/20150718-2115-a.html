[  airing in an hour <br> no thread <br><br>Dead show.<br>Dead fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  I could list everything wrong about it, but it's 1:00 AM here.  <br>I thought this aired on saturday.</br>  <br><br> Classroom <br><br><br>This is a complete turn off for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to watch it live, I was just too lazy to make a thread.</br>  Igarashi SB today, hyped  <br>It's a corporate drama with betrayal and intrigue. Or something like that.</br>  <br>It has much more than a school setting since they have on the job training as engineers as well as a corporate plot line</br>  Please don't mock sensei today. He's trying his best.  <br>isn't that tomorrow?</br>  <br>I want to marry Sensei.</br>  <br>Is it though? Is it anything?</br>  <br>No, you're confusing it with A/Z again. It's today.</br>  <br>Supposedly it will be clear by ep4.</br>   Motivated by his own speech.   <br><br>Great, he's turned into the jaded veteran who drinks instead of doing something useful. I hope he gets over it off screen.</br></br>  <br>Sensei a shit.</br>  who /Engineer/ here?  Half an hour to go.  Who /purple Inaho/ here?  <br>She's the reason I'm watching this.</br>  Who /yuriOTP/ here?  <br>Engineers best A-TECs</br>  <br>Girl Inaho/Orange Girl best couple. The guys can fuck each other, everyone's happy.</br>  STARTING  Sensei got rekt<br>Also dat Kobayashi Yuu</br>  <br><br><br>Me</br></br></br>  What was that about a spin-off about Iris and Mizuki?  Well done sensei, now they're all unemployed  <br>I can't into moon. What happened?</br>   that part where Iris tried to console Mizuki   Is Nagisa homosexual?  <br>how was it I missed it</br>  I want Nagisa to look down on me.  Suddenly Nagisa ass.  <br>  grill?  </br>  Too much dialogue, I didn't understand shit.  This seems to be shaping up what I wanted Plastic Memories to be, company stuff + a group actually working together instead romcom drama. Also Christmas cake flirting with underage man. Lot of good faces thanks to Igarashi.  <br>Dat ass though.</br>  <br> Dead fanbase. <br>There was no fanbase in first place, retard. To die something must exist.</br></br>  <br> bullies Sensei while encouraging him to try and drag him down <br> ignores hot woman in a towel <br>You tell me, anon.</br></br></br>   no capper on futakuro <br><br>Completely RIP.</br></br>  <br>I can't figure out my opinion of this show is. It's kinda shit, but I'm still intrigued.<br><br>Pilot best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Same. I'm still watching for GirlNaho, Mizuki and maybe Sensei. Also they said episode 4 was going to be important.</br>  I watch it for OreImo art style  <br>Sera was made for bullying</br>  I just want a show about mechanics ding mechanics things. . . <br><br><br>Pretty sure this is as close as I'm going to get.</br></br></br>  <br>Same.</br>  The only consistently good thing about this is Iris giving zero fucks about absolutely everything (except of course Mizuki).  <br>Iris is the only reason I watch this crap.<br><br>Her blowing off the Edgelord Buisiness guy is great</br></br></br>  <br> Igarashi storyboarding this episode <br>Can't wait</br></br>  Sensei was moe today.  <br>To be fair, there isn't any caps of Shokugeki no Souma episode today on futakuro as well.</br>  <br>TBS must be fucking up something then.</br>  Episode was 95% talking and money drama, the rest was Sensei drinking, Nagisa shower scene and 1 second of Iris/Mizuki. Still going to watch the next one.  <br><br>That only means that no one cared to be capper in there</br></br>        Who's this bitch    <br><br><br><br>Reminder that Nagisa finds this less interesting than working on the computer and angsting in the shower.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how successful men are made. You can't get to the top if you're weak to flesh.</br>    <br>Dat ass.</br>  Why do people link Purple with Inaho? I thought she looked more like Yuki.  The cutest.<br><br><br>Which Inaho are we speaking?</br></br></br>  <br>What other Inaho do you know?</br>  <br>She acts exactly like Inaho. So she's either Female Inaho or Inaho and Hime's lovechild (because she has Hime's VA)</br>  <br><br>I guess you mean A.Z Inaho then? I didn't watch A.Z S2 and wasn't sure if I'm remembering the name right.<br><br>I see the similarity but the fact that she's not MC and is openly recognized as a super-talented person who's been fished out from all over the nation as opposed to just being coincidentally there makes the whole thing much more believable and less obnoxious.</br></br></br></br>  Sensei will save A-TEC next week. I believe in him.  <br> complaining about mecha MC coincidentally being there </br>  <br>Because they are retarded newfags<br><br>Except Inaho was planning everything and was backed by the eye, Iris is completely reckless</br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched almost no mecha shows in my life but going by the only other one I remember, Buddy Complex, holy shit you're right.<br><br>Didn't know this was a thing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inaho was completely reckless whether he planned things or not.</br>  HS is up now    <br>Yes! I can finally understand boring business crap and Nagisa angst.</br>  <br>Inaho confirmed for beta<br><br>Iris confirmed for alpha.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get why you bother watching it if you find the business stuff boring.</br>  <br>Is she also female L-Elf/Yuuki Kazami as well?</br>  <br>It has potential. I'm waiting for A-TEC to start fighting back not just them getting BTFO because their fucking around isn't profitable.</br>  How long until Iris will fall for Nagisa for real?  <br>fuck off, this is maruto's first attempt at yuri</br>  <br>They're both gay, so never.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are brother and sister from the same mother, you mongoloid.</br>  <br> Oreimo character design <br> MC is a 20-something old dude <br> Male ass shoot <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br><br>Just who is this show aimed at?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're both reckless but stoic types who do everything for a girl. They're whatever that means.</br>  <br> yuri <br>Stop it<br>She obviously was disgusted by gay antics of her friend in this scene<br>Yes, even autist like her showed real human emotion</br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>    <br>Everyone other than shounen, haremshit and straight romcom fans.</br>  <br><br>Take off those anti-yuri goggles.</br></br>  <br>Maybe there's some medication that could help with your autism, anon.</br>  <br>And if you think that's not enough, read the lyrics of the very same OP.<br><br>It couldn't be any more blatant really. Absolutely no holding back on this one.</br></br></br>  <br>Iris seems pretty into Mizuki, but it doesn't seem to be the same way in reverse</br>  <br>Lyrics about her and Nagisa, retard</br>  <br> ED takes place in Yuri Land <br>Like Hyouka's first ED?</br></br>  <br>Anon, you're cute.<br><br><br>The ED has Mizuki being all over Iris, and the show showed us Iris being all over Mizuki.<br><br><br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking retarded<br><br> takes away all the tools <br> use your creativity <br> told to top-end R&amp;D </br></br></br></br>  <br>He is going to get orange as a rebound.</br>  <br>Iris and Nagisa are sibling, retard<br><br> Nagisa knows her name <br> ED shows Iris being all sad and shit, hinting sad past <br> Nagisa is a bastard child <br><br>HURR HURR</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is dumb.  Not enough female Inaho.  No I don't want the cute nerd boy to leave  I still don't get the point of this garbage anime  <br><br>Maruto wanted to try something different from haremshit. Unfortunately, it backfired.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? It was pointed out the most simple way possible in this episode. Just drop it if you can't follow it even that much.</br>  <br>It's a clusterfuck</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/notcycaiyt.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Don't worry, it'll catch fire eventually, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br>  Podracing when?  <br>How exactly, or are you just spouting out words? So far it's very simple story of two plotlines, Nagisa VS his brother and Sera trying to save A-TEC. And both of them are getting connected together.</br>  <br><br>Your face is a clusterfuck.<br><br>How fucking ADHD do you have to be not to get what's going on in this show?<br><br>Well, some parts are complicated. Nagisa's exact intentions aren't clear yet, but that's all.<br><br>One of the better shows of the season so far if you ask me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Salarymen are right - the anime</br>  <br>now rei clones are called "female inaho"</br>  <br>It's just for the Mars setting retard.</br>   she sees your budget management   <br>Monstershit and haremshit prison are right next door.</br>  <br>That makes even less sense though given the amount of mecha newfags on this board its no wonder they think A/Z invented everything</br>  <br>Is Yuu Kobayashi typecast nowadays?</br>  <br>Yeah, A/Z is now also the only mecha anime that did the generic Mars/Spacenoids VS Terrans setting. Now I get why everyone on this board compare anything to that forgettable show, it's the only war themed anime they've seen.</br>   there are people that honestly haven't realized that edgy oreimo-man and girl inaho are going to end together   This ending reminds me of the Hanamonogatari ED.  <br> I am this blind </br>  <br>Without a doubt. It's sad considering the range she can do.</br>  <br> there are people who are honestly going to force this meme in every thread from now on <br><br>We need context-sensitive mods so we can successfully report shit like this.</br></br></br>  I really enjoy Nagisa and the accountants side of things compared to the A-TEC team. To see Sensei get absolutely laid into both Nagisa and Accountant in the beginning felt so satisfying to watch.<br><br><br>The engine the class was working on in the very beginning looked like Anakin's podracer engine.<br><br>When it gets up and running, someone better shout "IT'S Working, IT'S WORKING!" or else I'll be very disappointed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's the only war themed anime they've seen <br><br>While that might be true, A.Z is still fresh in the board's memory, hell there have been comparisons a lot of comparisons with Valvrave too. There's no need to get all butthurt only because you watched some other entry level mecha like Gundam.</br></br></br>  <br>If you've seen lot of robot war anime then it's just another forgettable one among many others. It did nothing special and it doesn't really deserve the attention it gets, whether it's positive or negative attention. Comparing CC to AZ because both have Mars setting in them(when you can barely even notice they live on Mars here) is just ignorant. I'm surprised people still even bother remembering it.</br>  <br><br>I hate it.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter if it deserves the attention it gets or not, people still keep talking about VVV or Cross Ange despite both being absolutely horrible too, they just happen to be quite recent or left some impact in the board, for one reason or another, when they were airing. That's all there's to it.</br>  <br>It's even worse when A/Z never actually explored the Mars setting at all so the comparison makes even less sense. I would have went with Rei-clone, female Chirico or hell even a female Setsuna since at least they're more popular.</br>  <br>Do you actually think this will be a thing? /u/ bait very rarely becomes anything more than bait.<br>There probably won't be any romance at all.</br></br>  <br>You've never had a job with a shit boss?</br>  They have no creative spirit. Terrible engineers, all of them.<br>This anime hits me in the right spots though. I'm enjoying it.</br>    <br><br>Yup, she's also Smith from Monmusu lol<br><br>Well, Iris is Miia, and Mizuki is Papi as well...</br></br></br></br>   tfw your teacher fucked up with his naive dreams and you now have no education or experience for any real job <br>Becoming a boipussy is the only choice.</br>  <br>10/10 hank hill ass.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br>I have yet to watch the episode... they fired shortpants?</br>  <br> boipussy <br><br>Wait isn't that a girl?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure you understand how art works.</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you so autistic about this? At this point you're just bringing more attention to A.Z. Let it die in peace.</br></br></br>  <br>Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you?</br>  <br><br> Get OreNoImouto character design <br> Do a speculator ass-shot with it <br><br>Sure, why not?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He left on his own, he's the rocket tester and can't do shit in those conditions.<br>Though I'm hopeful they all come back and can do podracing again.<br><br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was a girl called Subaru last season.</br>  <br>Fuck these kids and fuck the teacher. Bunch of spoiled self-entitled cunts.</br>  <br>He quit.</br>  <br>Well, yes.<br> Also most Japanese names are gender-neutral, newfriend. </br></br>  <br>I hope we will see them cry like bitches the moment they realize they did the wrong choice.</br>   nii-san   So Nagisa's broher is hogging the money to his own pocket and uses A-TEC as excuse?  <br> Does Subaru sound like a girl's name to you? </br>  <br>MC saved A-TEC. Had he left them in their state they would have disbanded in less than 3 months.</br>  I want to fuck girl Inaho and watch her stare blankly into my eyes.  I'm really enjoying this. It's Maruto and all, but I hope this continues to ignore romance for the business and regular drama.  Is MC a faggot?  I skim through the episode now after the first ep.<br>It's so fucking boring.</br>  The Glasslip of the season.  <br>He has no time for needy Christmas cakes</br>  <br>Fuck off, retard</br>  <br>He's alpha. Wanting to fuck constantly and doing it when presented the opportunity at the drop of a hat, is a sign of a virgin.</br>  <br><br>Next episode looks like it's gonna be hijinks...<br><br>He said to watch out for ep 4, but it's probably another bait and switch episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you people understood that wrong. He said that by episode 4 you have the whole idea what kind of show this is, as it's more slow-paced and we still aren't entirely clear what Nagisa is about to do.</br>  <br><br>Yes, end-game pairing are Iris x Mizuki and Sensei x Nagisa</br></br>  The best transfer student  <br><br>Guess that's when Nagisa lays out his goals then</br></br>  <br> his goals then <br>Become CEO<br>Destroy brother<br>Get some student pussy</br></br></br></br>  DISREGARD BITCHES<br><br>ACQUIRE INFLUENCE AND POWER</br></br>  At the same time I think it's good if the cast size is being cut half but then again I don't want some characters to leave. How can the smug boy leave his nerd bro behind, at least keep him.  <br>Whit dat ass nobody notized the scars on his back.</br>  <br>But anon, I too would prefer to work on a functioning spaceship than wasting my time with a girl like that.<br>It's much more thrilling and satisfactory.</br></br>  Not you too.  So, is the CEO secretly embezzling funds for some shadow project? <br><br>I hope it's not going to be that the Kirishina company is somehow trying to create weapons or new types of military craft because that is more profitable, or even fund a private army of mercenaries to take over stuff. That would be too cliché.</br></br>  <br>Asumin leaving, THAT really broke my heart. Though now that they have Angelina I guess she's become actually superfluous. If only they had listened to her all along, they could've prevented this.</br>  <br>I think the brother is incompetent and the company is going down the drain.</br>  <br> posting Korrashit <br><br>Now you have me convinced you yurifags are just trying to stirr shit up. That is, if you even are the real thing and not just some bunch of falseflagging shitposters who are still riding high after your success of killing countless Hibikek threads.</br></br></br>  STOP BULLYING  <br> yurifags <br>You realize that's an anti-yuri poster?<br><br>The yuri in this show is overt. Go watch it.<br><br>Also I don't remember a single time I've seen "yurifags" ruining a thread, but I've seen countless times people were complaining about "yurifags" supposedly shitting up threads, and actually shitting up the thread in the progress.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But they're selling laser-guided vehicles and are some sort of huge insurance company now. <br><br>By having made the A-TEC R/D department irrelevant, surely the company wouldn't have any financial problems anymore. <br><br>Unless the big brother CEO did some really terrible investments.</br></br></br></br></br>  You guys seriously have nothing better to discuss than the potential yuri or lack of thereof between a background character and the MC's sister? Really?  <br> The yuri in this show is overt. <br> This is what yurishitters actually believe <br><br>Here we go again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first time witnessing shitposting on /a/? Forcing straigh vs yuri wars has become the method du jour for that.</br>  <br>Thank you based Christ. I got about three minutes into this episode before realising I needed to start 120Sing it.<br>Returned for dat ass, though.</br></br>  Just finished ep 3. First episode was ok, second was meh but this one was actually good, just need a little more of this and we are good to go.  <br>Shame it's starting out so slow and takes some sweet time for getting into gear. That's a risky road to take for an anime original show, since a substantial portion of the brain dead general audience suffering from ADHD will have dropped it by the second episode. Just look at our very own threads.</br>  For what purpose?  <br>Yes I have, what is Subaru going to do from now on, will he ever come back, will he ever be smug again.</br>  <br>yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom<br>gotta bait those fujo bux if you want to turn a profit<br><br>kiryuu is a true business hero, saving a-tec and disc sales at the same time</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I'm saying. Despite the company he's still managing to fuck it up, and due to the brother complex, he don't want to be seen as inferior to his little brother. So he's thrown him at all the toughest problems and given him impossible jobs, but he's still managed to save every company he worked for and give them V shaped results. <br>Now the older brother is getting even more angry and has thrown him at the A-TEC department, hoping he won't be able to save it.</br></br>  <br>There's lot of man ass this season. Kobayashi's little boy butt in Chinpo Kitan, shower scene in Prison School and now this.</br>  What's wrong with alpha-females?  <br>Only faggots let themselves be pushed around by women.</br>  <br> Angist in the shower <br> Sensei red face shows up <br><br>I thought he was going to fap to sensei.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri people are wearing their goggles tighter each season, anon.<br><br>Soon they'll claim that BL-shows are yuri.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean, why did she got mad when she was called alpha?</br>  I love the faces, it was especially good with Igarashi's SB this episode. Also that Iris.  So did DDY drop this show or what?<br>they had the only good release of the first episode.</br>  <br> yuri doesn't sell, it's conventional wisdom <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders </br></br>  <br>I think they're aware the material might be a bit boring for some, so they add in some fanservice to keep people interested until something exciting happens.</br>  <br>nobody watches this shit</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be easier for the big brother CEO to simply promote his little brother into a position where he'd have absolutely no influence? Also, there would still be that problem with the funds for A-TEC that aren't being reported to the rest of finance and administration. They do say that the money has to go somewhere. Would the big brother CEO really use it to pay some huge debts that were caused by his own incompetence?</br>  <br>Igarashi and his sunsets</br>  <br>And since when that stop they keep making yuri?<br>Probably is a sucess but you are ignoring other things</br></br>  <br> episode 8 Euphonium skyrocketed preorders <br> and yet the show as a whole barely sold somewhat decently <br><br>your revered hibikek was no smash hit, anon</br></br></br></br>    <br>you are cancer<br>kill yourself</br></br>  This show is really bad. I think it's only going to get worse. The only shows this season less deserving of threads are like:<br><br>- Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan<br>- Dandelion<br>- Shimoneta</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's professional baiting.</br>  <br>okay</br>  <br>i am the quimioterapy</br>  <br>Japan likes their women to be subservient Yamato Nadeshikos. Therefore instead of calling her "alpha woman" she might as well have called her an unlovable hairy bull dyke.</br>  <br> Kuusen <br><br>The only one you got right.</br></br></br>  <br>Engineer Flamenco just wanted to dream</br>  <br>You're probably just some random shitposter who's into roleplaying. In a way, it's even worse than tripfagging. So yes, you should definitely kill yourself.</br>  What is this show even trying to do?<br><br>They marketed it with the two girls, but they don't do anything and Kaito and Nagasa are for all intents and purposes the protagonists. Then they yuribait in the ED while having the actual show focus only on Kaito and Nagisa, complete with gratuitous man-ass of Nagisa. Commit to one thing and stop trying to pander to everyone, holy shit.</br></br>  <br>Either you're retarded, or you're commenting despite not having watched the show yet, which I guess also makes you retarded.</br>  This show needs more of the shota.  <br>But he left  ;_; </br>  <br>He and the IT guy are the best characters.</br>  <br><br>That's why</br></br>    <br>This director's last work ignored the cutest smug shota most of the time after episode 1, I don't trust him anymore.</br>  <br>FFF is doing it, though I have no idea how their release is.</br>  I'm not picking this up until the ending is confirmed to not be edgy drama relationship garbage like WA2.  <br>At the very least they're better than Crunchyroll</br>   Claris ED <br><br><br>I thought they had split up?</br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't much better than CR, which they were likely editing from. They did typesetting and fixed some of the more blatant errors, but name orders were still getting switched around.</br>  <br><br>WA2 was an exception, the last anime he worked on was very fun to watch.</br></br>  <br>One of them left the group, remaining one brought in another friend.</br>  D-did they fuck?  <br>Saekano was also edgy relationship garbage with that bully tsundere.</br>  <br>Apparently not. She did intend to, he on the other hand just baited her by allowing her to use the bath.</br>  <br><br>I see. Still sounds more or less like before to me. Not that I mind.</br></br>  <br><br>That was only one scene in episode 9 and it ended with the tsundere getting BTFO</br></br>  <br>He's gay.</br>  <br> shower scene immediately cutting to this face <br>No wonder</br></br>  <br>Please, even if he was gay he wouldn't have such low standards.</br>  <br> hot teacher <br> low standards <br>pl--<br>oh, you mean teacher about Nagisa. Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Nagisa is rich, ambitious, powerful and good-looking.</br>  <br>He's scarred to hell and back, probably ass raped used goods.</br>  <br>Ahhhh, corporate politics and embezzling fraud. I love this so much it hurts.</br>  <br>But Sensei is hardworking, cute and kind<br>Please don't bully</br></br>  I wanted to drop this show, but god damn that cast. It even has Chiyo-chan. I can't do it.  <br>I like him, that's why I bully him</br>  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>Thought that was her voicing Angelina<br><br><br>Didn't he call her Hattori-kun before going to the shower?</br></br></br></br></br>  I watch this for her.<br><br> Yes, my autism is at such level. </br></br>  2cute4me  <br><br>Only reason to watch this show. I want to see more of her racing.</br></br>  Nagato a cute   Subaru quit <br> PR qt quit <br>Will they come back, /a/?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Of course. Theres going to be that generic scene where the characters that didn't leave are all working towards some goal which has time constraints and then all the characters who left start showing up one by one saying stuff like "Heh looks like you can use a hand." and all that.</br></br></br>  This is bullying.  <br>Nothing wrong with that. Those sensei and those kids were running things like lockheed martin.</br>  <br>Literally the only reason I'm still watching  but to be honest I'm still kind of interested in all the business drama. </br>  <br> probably ass raped used goods. <br>This, you don't go from illegitimate child from rich soon-to-be-CEO without pleasing few old-men for money.</br></br>  He wants A-TEC to succeed ultimately?  <br>Seriously, she was the best.</br>  <br>Probably. Even if it's just to spite his older brother. Of course, officially, he will comply with his orders and do whatever is necessary to downsize A-TEC, but in a way so that it actually still retains enough efficiency and really forces the staff to be extremely creative, searching for new ways to be cost-effective, environment-friendly, cheap, and yet good.</br>  Who Subaru here?  I really like the ED song. Full version when?  Nagisa wants to fuck Kaito right?  <br>They actually the spoiled kids, they really should known that money is serious problem.</br>  <br>Yes. Chief said Nagisa needs him sexually.</br>  another show that could have been great with maybe half the characters. I feel like the other half is just there because they had some anime cliche quota to fill.  <br>Ehh. R and D should be the last place you cut money if you're a megacorp. Google pisses away billions on its new hires, and they do so because one good innovation can literally change or even create an entire industry.</br>  <br>Well you're in luck because half the cast just left forever this episode</br>  <br>Yeah, he's the tough love boss.<br><br>...AKA totally fucking boring, give more screentime to Iris</br></br></br>  <br>Is it really R&amp;D if it's a group of sixteen-year-olds pissing away their money with nothing but a busted rocket to show for it?</br>  <br>Yup. Have you seen the first few Space X launches? The early days of Nasa? Shit's on fire, yo.</br>  <br>Was Space X created by sixteen-year-olds?</br>  <br> Chinpo Kitan <br><br>How have I not heard that before? Also, what the fuck is up with all these shitters watching this show and complaining about it not being haremshit?</br></br></br>  <br>What about F-35-chan?<br>What's the excuse?</br></br>  So will sensei plow the delicious Christmas cake?  All auditors as scary as Angelina?  <br>This show is about business. Like all this shit is about business. Next thing you know, they're going to be doing six sigma or some shit as well as have someone do the quality and process management.</br>  So, do they expect us to be on the side of A-TEC? So far, I'm feeling Nagisa has the better side.  The A-TEC students and Kaito are spoiled as fuck. That much money wasted on a rocket that ultimately got destroyed, and they request even more? Angelina was 100% correct with everything she said to them. All that money with no innovation. Terrible. And they wonder why they're downsizing.  <br>That seems to be why most of them left after the huge budget/facility cut.<br>Being used to being pampered with all that nice shit and to fool around in because of how special they are.</br></br>  <br> MC </br>  is this the worst thing maruto has written?  <br><br>Yes. How did he go from writing masterpieces to writing this?</br></br>   generic fanservice harem romcom <br> /a/ hates it, demands that studios drop the cheesy romance in favor of plot and subtle characterization <br><br> office drama with heavy dialogue and no apparent romantic arc <br> /a/ hates it, wonders why nobody is having sex </br></br></br></br>  Who exactly is this show pandering to? There aren't really moeblobs, not a lot of action, and I wouldn't say any of the characters are self-insert worthy.  <br> Engineers </br>  <br> Who exactly is this show pandering to? <br><br>Me.</br></br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>As engineer I feel cringeworthy having some fucking office rat take away all their tools and equipment.<br>What are they expecting them to make? Hammers?</br></br></br></br>  <br>As an engineer, I cringe at the vague way they talk about the technology.</br>  <br>Because its a fucking anime. They can't talk about technology in detail, because authors themselves have no fucking idea.</br>  <br> because authors themselves have no fucking idea. <br><br>and even when they do it's not like the audience does so they'd have to dumb it down anyways</br></br></br>  <br>Tough love boss &gt; rei clones</br>  <br>I enjoy it, guess that means it's for me.</br>  <br>You and me brother.</br>  <br>Well at least it didn't panders to those harem or romcom. So it's okay in my book.</br>  <br>Will take in your ass.<br>Does not begin to soil the anime like you did in Hibike.<br>If you're going to start with yuribait of shit, go Bostar their delusions and hallucinations in / u /.<br>your trash miserable</br></br></br></br>  Who is this shit mc anime?<br>I still do not know who is the MC?<br>anime rotten</br></br>  <br><br>Go back to animesuki you stupid fuck</br></br>  <br>it's going to be<br><br>sensei x angelina<br>sensei imouto x nagisa<br><br>rei clone will be nagisa's half sister.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they will end up being siblings to match up with Kaito and Mizuki.</br>  <br><br>2016 Hibiki Love Story</br></br>  <br>Shit's kinda dry. I wouldn't mind so much if there was some sort of greater intrigue going on in the background.</br>  Nagisa and Angelina make a hell of a team. Oh wow. I very much look forward to seeing how A-TEC gets through this.  <br>It was quite clear the previous episode.</br>  <br><br>Will take in the ass.<br>There is no yuri this show is so delusions and hallucinations yurifag.<br>You have mints diseases, Hibike wires were all aruinados for you guys desgraçaos yurifags.<br>Forcing your tastes disgusting other users.<br>Va post your shit on / u /<br>I read the wire Hibike, you disgusting yurifag destroyed the anime<br>Do not destroy this anime as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I very much look forward to seeing how A-TEC gets through this. <br>They don't.<br>The focus on A-TEC is just a ruse. The real focus is on Nagisa vs. his brother. A-TEC people are just side characters.</br></br></br>  <br> actually shitting up the thread in the progress. <br>It's both. Them and the stupid yurifags.<br><br><br>On a separate note, I can never take Angelina's seiyuu seriously when she's trying to be serious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nagisa wants to help them though.</br>  Is it improving? Should I pick it back up?  <br>Yes, that is quite obvious.</br>  <br>nah, it sucks, and goodbye</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128242547 <br> 10k sales <br> failure </br></br>   R&amp;D guy gone <br>I'm not an engineer, but isn't this a huge blow?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128242547 <br> fem/a/nons <br>You poor, desperate fools.</br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br>I'm expecting some stupid asspull to make A-TEC relevant.</br></br>  Nagisa did nothing wrong.  <br>And his brother is up to something quite wrong for sure.<br>I await to see how based Nagisa busts him and ruins him.</br></br>  <br>He didn't fuck Angelina</br>  What is this anime actually about? The first three episodes all seem like they should be from different shows; their tone and direction all seem wildly opposed to eachother.  <br>Giving thirsty hoes what they want when they demand it is how you stay beta, pleb.</br>  <br>Serious question: are you retarded?</br>  <br>You gonna answer the question?</br>  <br>Are you intoxicated?<br>High as the int'l space station?</br></br>  <br>I'll take that as a yes.</br>  <br>Don't do drugs anymore, son.</br>  <br>He's underage and she's an old lady.</br>  <br>and?</br>  <br>Well his brother already tried to get him killed</br>  <br>I don't get why you people like her, I find everything except her interesting about this show. Boring quiet girls suck, bring back Subaru or PR girl in her place.</br>  <br>I mean, whatever he's cutting budgets for.</br>  <br> if a girl doesn't have super exaggerated emotions she's boring </br>  <br> her </br>  If they're bleeding so much money, then why don't they get involved in projects than can bring them so much money in the first place?  <br>because of traditions faggotry</br>  <br><br>They don't want to do stuff they don't like.</br></br>  <br> They don't want to do stuff they don't like. <br><br>this is the problem with the "Artistic freedom" mindset. Everyone has to do shit they don't like, you're not exempt</br></br></br>   Combustion Tester <br> Designer <br> Accounting/Administration <br> Materials Engineer <br> PR/Promotion <br><br>All a bunch of faggots who left. At least best girl is still here.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Won't the others have to take up the slack?</br>  Isn't Hattori a boy's name? Did Angelina have some surgery?  I remember being very disappointed with episode 1 of this show, thinking that it was going to be the same old highschool kids and their wacky hijinks. I am actually really liking the direction episode 3 took, and I hope it will stay along that route.  <br>Wasn't Maruto saying something about episode 4 is where things start really picking up?</br>  <br>Well, that would make sense because of all the shit that happened in this episode. It all depends on how good their comeback from now on is.</br>  I was hoping this will be a show about space travel and life in a Martian colony<br><br>But this is just an anime about Japanese corporate culture</br></br>  <br>Salarymen who hate their bosses</br>  <br>Along those lines. Episode 4 is when you should have a clear idea of what the show is about and where it's going.<br><br>Somewhere earlier in the thread, someone clarified it.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea. I never check source material or previews etc.<br><br>I used to but I'd rather just let myself be surprised nowadays</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, considering how the japs force some high school stuff into pretty much everything, I can perfectly understand why some people are fed up with it.<br>Especially whne it has absolutely no place in a show (not really the case here).</br></br>  <br>Yes, literally.</br>  <br>Well, if somethings BL, it certainly makes yuri-sides (perceived or confirmed) somewhat less unlikely if there are female side characters. But this show is neither, there is just Fuji and /u/ bait.</br>  <br>I think it panders to people that work and know the value of money. I don't hate my boss but it did irk me when the characters would just go on about 'we need this and that' and simply demanded it as if they were entitled. <br><br>It's a good thing that the show is about them coming down from cloud 9, having been born and growing up there, and working their way back up.</br></br></br>  Why does barely anyone ever consider gravity on Mars?<br>Those guys should be either over 2 meter or walk very long low-gravity steps or both.<br>Honestly, that it's on Mars is so secondary, the setting might as well be a Bishop Ring or some other gigantic habitat.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they wear gravity shoes</br>  <br>Most science fiction is basically "normal stuff, but in space!" anyway. However, most also pay attention to some special technological/social situations. This show, so far, doesn't (which isn't bad per se, Cowboy Bepob and LotGH are the same here, but they would lose a lot of charme without the space setting).</br>  <br> fuji  <br>Fujo<br><br>Sounds impractical.</br></br></br></br>  My fucking god. Angelina and Nagisa are making it real hard for me not to drop this.<br><br>I'm going to severely disappointed once the inevitable 'happy end they don't get decommissioned' but holy shit it feels fucking glorious to see the cast get their shit pushed in hard.</br></br>  <br>Probably helps with lifting but they don't show it? Artificial gravity adding to Mars' gravity to create a comfortable 1G environment?<br>Or at worst, it's a forgotten detail.<br><br><br> going to severely disappointed <br> Yes, my autism is triggered. <br> I think I should go to sleep already, I'm tired. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it feels fucking glorious to see the cast get their shit pushed in hard <br><br>THIS</br></br></br>  <br>I like the idea of "Normal stuff, but with sci-fi tropes!", but this barely feels like it.<br><br>This might as well be taking place on Earth. The enviornment looks just like earth (which can be explained to be on purpose, but we still need to hear the explanation). Gravity is the same, length of days are the same. Had I not seen the start of the first episode, I would assume this just takes place in futuristic Akihabara or whatever.<br><br>Even the other interesting concept, of privatized cities owned by companies, is hardly explored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's her family name, dumdum.</br>  <br>Mars days are 24 hours and 39 minutes.</br>  <br>That would probably still require a special time system, but fair enough, we can ignore it.<br><br>Still doesn't answer everything else.</br></br></br>  Am I fucking supposed to feel bad for them?<br>Because all I'm feeling now is absolute bliss knowing that those spoiled little fucks have finally gotten a well-deserved taste of their misgivings. <br><br>Almost eight god damn years in a shit office job having to deal with red tape, bureaucratic bullshit, and a more than corrupt executive management is making me appreciate every other character aside from the class and teacher far more than I should be.</br></br></br>   Non engineers say BE CREATIVE THAT'S ALL IT TAKES! <br><br>Yeah no fuck you guys. You can't shove people in a corner and tell them to think their way out of it when you don't know an engine from your dick.</br></br>  <br> I had to put up with shit so fictional characters in a far more complex field than I could even imagine have to as well </br>  <br>Are you saying you can't simply unlock the power of friendship to help you after strengthening your bonds with coworkers?</br>  I came in for the girls but now the guys have my attention. What the fuck?  <br>So this is "Idea Guys" vs Engineers, the anime?</br>  <br>Well Nagisa is carrying the plot</br>  All I can say for now is it is going to be a business-wars type  <br><br>he's doing nothing more than making snide remarks and foreshadowing, he may have a plan but he's a right cunt</br></br>  How would you feel about a boss like this?  <br>Indifferent. If we do our job properly and don't make stupid decisions then he won't lash out.</br>  <br><br><br>well We're also assuming he's not out to get us like he is A-tec</br></br></br>  <br>what you say is true, but in ep3 where the teacher asks for parts with the cost and nagisa exploding on him telling him that that isn't sufficient paperwork to warrant him to accept his request, shows the level of competence these people are at.<br><br>I understand that the executives of companies and accountants etc don't understand fully the complexity of engineering but then it goes both ways too. The students+teacher had to understand that money doesn't just simply grow in a garden and you have to earn it. It's a compromise or take a hike situation, and growing from this is the direction that I hope this anime will kind of go to. Undoubtedly there's the drama between the two brothers that will take precedence though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd be wholly satisfied by a boss with a work ethic like his. Of course, barring whatever power struggle he's doing in the sidelines.</br></br>  <br><br>well for whatever reason the higher ups are suddenly out to get A-tech. We don't know the reason yet but this extremely sudden shift is a bit much,<br><br>You can't pull the rug out from under your employees like this and say "HUR DUR USE YOUR HEAD" you have to give them something instead of setting them up to fail harder <br><br>right now they're just throwing shit at them till they quit on their own, which happened with a number of students and that's a right dick move</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they've already thrown science out the window with this one. I mean fuck, all the spaceships fly like airplanes. And in the first episode they just accelerate straight into a space station and crash land like a plane! They don't even do a counter burn. Couldn't they have at least played KSP for like 5 minutes before making this shit?<br><br>I mean fuck, if they want to pander to engineers they need to get their science together<br><br><br> &gt;Artificial gravity adding to Mars' gravity to create a comfortable 1G environment? <br>if you can manipulate gravity, then you don't need whatever engine they're supposed to be developing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty good, I had similar one and there was no problem with pay, vacations, breaks or anything. <br>Then he changed the place and was replaced with more irresponsible boss who didn't have enough authority to keep the shit together, which lead to the slackers not doing their job properly. That only leads to bad atmosphere and you're surrounded by Tarous who can make your job a lot harder because the boss doesn't care.</br></br>  When will we get Amagi 2nd season animated by Kyoani? I miss the fairies already.  Never. Next season will be by DEEN.  Okay, I'm sold.  <br>Anime Is not terrible but just plain bad.</br>  A loli shinigami will never sit on your lap because of how your killstreak reached the THOUSANDS  Reminder that "pandering" isn't a meme. Sometimes it makes perfect sense.  I've only seen a few minutes of goth loli and I'm already in love.  Goth loli confirmed for girl of the season  Anime Rory a shit  <br>Fuck off manga nerd</br>  <br>right. The show itself is kind of meh, but she has smugfu levels of show carrying potential. Her animated scene are nicely done as well. Very satisfying choreography.</br>  <br>Make me animeonlyshit</br>  <br>Have you ever been in a fight? Because i have.<br>Im pretty sure i could hit you so hard your mother would start bleeding.</br></br>  <br>The only good thing about the anime is Itami's VA, he does a superb job.<br><br>Everything else is off.</br></br></br>  So far the anime has been better than the manga. <br><br>I'm completely serious; the manga is objectively terrible pacing.</br></br>  Join today!  Manga &gt; anime.<br><br>It doesn't even matter what the anime may have done better. Fucking up Rory and Kuribayashi's designs is just too much.</br></br>  <br><br>No Fair!</br></br>  <br> better than the manga <br>So you don't mind butchering of characterisation due to censorship/cut scenes?<br><br> objectively terrible pacing <br>How? The manga did things like explain how the elf was in the well when they found her which the anime hasn't done yet. Also Spending 15 min on how otaku Itami is in the first ep was terrible.</br></br></br></br></br>  gothic loli (rori?) saved the show  <br> butchering of characterisation due to censorship <br><br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>    <br>Her voice was the best part of the episode.</br>  <br><br>Same here OP. I watched these three today, and said fuck it and read all the manga.<br><br>While it still has a bit of a harem going on I really do enjoy  the fact the Military is still a strong giant force to not even be touched in their world. Like the premise of something existing that could actually take down the stationed Japan Military just doesn't exist. I wonder how the manga will end, setting up all these different things. I think the most recent chapters where they take down the Fire Dragon was pretty nice, especially with them flying in on the fighters and just demolishing everything. Generally if a character meets a hurdle in the manga and the military can't do anything it's for diplomatic and real reasons instead of some stupid anime tier reasoning. <br><br>But now that I read it all I'm kind of sad. Is there any manga/anime similar to this? Basically two worlds meeting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The they cut out things like how Rory and her goddess don't believe murder or even rape to be a sin just "human nature".</br>  <br><br> vlcsnap </br></br>  Help me, anons, I have become the lowest common denominator. I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime.<br><br><br>Well, there's Outbreak Company. The anime is really good but it's way more focused in politics and pacific relationship than the use of military.<br>There's really one episode where they BTFO a dragon and everyone gets impressed but it doesn't really affect the anime in any way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much the only things so far (it could still be inserted on Italica, though)., also in my opinion her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself Other than that they added a bit of characterization for both Itami and the female medic.</br>  I don't really mind things getting cut. It's easy to understand why they can't fit everything due to time constraints.<br><br>Besides, if I have read the source then all that nice background info is in my head already and I still understand. If I haven't read the source then I got something to look forward to if I decided I like it enough to go read.</br></br>  <br>I agree, i kinda wan't to drop it but i will give it a chance if it gets better.</br>  <br> could still be inserted on Italica <br>Hopefully they won't censer that battle and how she gets when near battles.<br> her whole speech in that scene is contrived and contradictory by itself <br>It just gives people an early idea of how she isn't just some simple goth loli who has a different sense of justice to normal. Anime only people may miss out on that point.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I know of Outbreak Company already. It was semi enjoyable. I feel the the MCs tendency to be a giant weeb and start teaching everybody "otaku" culture was a bit too much, but it wasn't terrible. It feels like these two are the only ones though.</br></br>  <br><br><br>How do I get me a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped?</br></br></br>  After seeing the first episode I thought this would be one of the best animes in a long time. But now it's quickly diven headfirst into a pile of mediocrity. It's like when you see a commercial for a delicious burger and then you try it and it tastes like the frozen burgers you get at safeway.  <br><br>Would No Game No Life suffice?<br><br>Not quite military vs. military action but definitely two worlds colliding in a way. Very good anime in general, either way.</br></br></br></br>   that bemused knowing look <br> diamonds <br><br>It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. The dragon was nowhere near as threatening as in the manga. Why do they do this shit?</br></br></br>  Why aren't they studying the sky?<br>They should research astrological stuff, like how much a year takes, if they are still on the milky way, no, if they have any similarities between the constellations and super-clusters.<br><br>If they two worlds are actually in the same universe it would be pretty fucking neat.</br></br></br>  <br> that bemused knowing look <br> "perhaps I have finally found the right group of men who can finally successfully rape me" </br></br>  <br> I couldn't help but keep laughing continuously at this scene. I'm loving this anime. <br>ya, you're hopeless.</br></br>  <br> Japan <br>Better keep looking.</br></br>  Lips make every female character 10 time better<br><br>We need more lips in anime</br></br>  <br> lol those lovebirds, so hopeless! <br> meanwhile... <br> "can't wait to get back to my porn video tonight!" <br><br>Don't let your dreams be dreams, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already a thread, no need to make another one.</br>  <br> trying so hard to appear tough you start lying on the internet </br>  Same VA.<br><br>Yes</br></br>   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/17/<wbr>world/asia/japans-lower-house-passe<wbr>s-bills-giving-military-freer-hand-<wbr>to-fight.html?_r=0</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Coincidence?</br></br>  <br> Saki from Shinsekai Yori <br> Yukari from Yuyushiki <br> Ayaya from Kirino Mosaic <br>Is she going to be the new HanaKana?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not at all. Abe Shinzo actually wrote Gate under a pen name.</br>   Finally get home from doing stuff with my daughter <br> "Maybe this episode will have more blood and gore..." <br> Disappointing lack of gore <br><br>Jeeze theyre starting a pattern</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is cumming when you eat good food only limited to girls?</br></br>  The scene with her in the truck was nice. Where she just watched them talking.  <br> yfw there is literally a librlul "anti-abe" movement in japan who wants no war ever under any circumstances because lol war fuck the reason </br>  <br>I totally agree with you. This show could definitely use more gore, because you know... Chinese cartoons with sex and gore are for mature adults like us. Right? <br><br>Anyway, I honestly don't mind that they toned it down for the show. I think that they are still covering the things that most deserve coverage. The omissions haven't been major yet.</br></br></br>  <br>It's miles better than the manga, Rory is actually sexy here.</br>  Why the fuck was the horse making the noise of a baby crying?  <br>No, the male judges strip too.</br>  <br> It bugs me that the anime doesn't have the blood and guts that the manga does. <br>That's because you're edgy, and probably underage. The "blood and guts" added nothing, and was even a bit of a distraction.</br></br>  <br> It's miles better than the manga <br><br> Rory murders bandits with not a drop of blood in sight </br></br></br>  <br>Take off your /pol/ goggles dumbfuck, Abe's approval ratings take big hits from LDP voters as about much as any "librul" groups, it's pretty much across the board in Japanese society.</br>  <br>They have been, it mentions it later in the novel. Particularly because they want to launch satellites.<br>It's a big invasion force, not everything happens around the MC's group.</br></br>  Will they ever find this slut some clothes?  <br><br>It's censored to shit.</br></br>  <br>Watch the preview.</br>  <br> elves <br> clothes <br>The only clothes elves should wear is semen and their blood.</br></br></br>  <br> Where's muh gorefest? </br>  <br>It was a rhetorical question.<br><br>http://www.helpguide.org/articles/a<wbr>utism/autism-symptoms-and-early-sig<wbr>ns.htm</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>If they omitt muh Myuute im sending them a box of horse turds.</br>  Its a kids cartoon, why is everyone expecting blood and gore?  <br> &gt;/a/128213971 </br>  <br>Are you Korean or Chinese <br><br><br> It's censored to shit. <br>Which is a huge improvement, this story didn't need the Michael Bay treatment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's an important part of the story and her character you fucking retard.</br></br>  The dirtiest sluts always have the purest smiles.  <br> priestess of a god of murder murders people <br> Michael Bay treatment <br><br>I don't even...</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>How many dicks has Rory taken? Over 100 would have to be the lower bound, right?</br></br>  <br>Necrophilia doesn't count, so she's still a virgin.</br>  <br>How old is she? I thought she was a few hundred years old, in which case 100 might not be enough.</br>  <br><br>900 years Anon. Even if she fucks somebody only once per month (yeah, right) the number is quite a bit higher than 100.</br></br>  <br><br>she's an Elf, she thinks that little sheet are her clothes now</br></br>  I thought she was telling him off in this scene. Don't Japs have a thing about showing your inner eyelid as being akin to sticking your tongue out?  <br>They do, but they also stick their tongues out while doing it.</br>  That scene was so much more dramatic in the manga  <br><br>The manga gives her the unexpected characterization of a girl who actually prefers long term relationships with interesting people.<br><br>Still, I bet it's quite a few.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that breast line thats not a smooth curve <br><br>Augh</br></br></br>    <br>Japanese people need more subtlety. Im sick of reading LNs and having the faggot of an author spend pages explaining minor details.<br><br>It's implicit from her being part of a religious cult and slaughtering people.<br><br><br>Blood and guts takes a fair bit out of budgets. This isn't the 90s either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The manga sure has ugly art.</br></br></br>  <br> a gothic loli who actually WANTS to be raped <br><br> men who can finally successfully rape me <br><br>Did I miss something here or does she actually want to get raped?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>She was acting like a semen demon the whole time.</br>  <br>It's just /a/nons screwing around</br>  <br>okay im convinced. going to horriblesubs now.</br>  The jeep scene needed more animation  <br>It's a good thing they fucking FINALLY introduced the girl characters in this piece of JSDF propaganda trash. This show was up until now failing my 3 ep test.</br>  <br>Did he kick her off, or did she just not like sitting on his "pistol"?</br>  How the fuck will they animate  the prince raping the bunny queen and dragging his sex slaves over the ground with chains on their necks and then getting completely beat up? <br><br>They can't leave that out since it will just ruin everything.</br></br>  <br>Too costly, it's easier to just loop the jeep shaking.</br>  <br>This is supposed to be wholesome nationalist propaganda. Not porn.</br>  <br> showing your inner eyelid <br>what?</br></br>  <br>Kicked her off, went back on, had some petty fighting and then settled for leaning on to him from the side.</br>    <br>Ah I'm silly. That makes sense.</br>  <br>That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well. Continue for 900 years.</br>  <br>Watch more anime. Jesus, dude.</br>  Speaking of gestures.<br><br> pointing to an opened mouth <br>this is the international sign for fellatio</br></br></br>   she'll never climb on your lap   <br>Censor like a motherfucker.<br><br>My question is how are they gonna have Kubayashi beat the shit out of that bitch when they've made her look like a moeblob</br></br></br>  <br>The more I look at her, the more disgusted I am at the anime.</br>  <br>what's up with the awful editing?</br>  <br>I actually wouldn't mind it that much if they  cover the sex slaves with some rags and use sheets for the rape scene  I fear however that they just won't show it at all.</br>  <br>/ak/</br>  <br> you now remember there's an onsen scene when nearly all the girls' boobs are naked and uncensored <br> you now realize you won't see shit in the anime </br></br>  By the way, wasn't Lelei supposed to have silver hair or am I remembering it wrong?  <br><br>No. It was always blue. Because her family are aliens.</br></br>  <br>Also  Itami washing off Rory after her killing spree there. <br><br>I don't get why they went this way for the anime, doesn't fit the series at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well fuck it the anime's not gonna live up to the manga or LN any possible way so I may as well fuck around with edits to enjoy myself. Was planning on doing a side story following the adventures of bane and cia in this magic world if I felt like it or it was received well. <br><br><br>Pic related(resized for file limit) is 1st(or 2nd if I plan on editing the invasion) and the 2nd(3rd?) is the one I did earlier with cia standing in front of the jeep titled "Gate: Thus The CIA Crashed There!" Tell me what you think took like an hour to make the bane exploitable since apparently no one bothered to make one before. <br><br>Also manga Rory is better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The anime made me pick up the manga again after putting it on hold.<br>Currently around the 4th tank.<br>Is the princess added to Itami's harem?  looks like it from the garden party. <br>Same with brown elf right? hope so at least, even if we already know who's gonna win.</br></br></br>  Leilei a cute<br>That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though.</br>  <br> That has got to be sad. Be in a long relationship with a human who you genuinely love. They die of old age. Eventually you find someone else, they die of old age as well. Continue for 900 years. <br>Well she only got 39 years left, so Itami is her last partner in this world.</br></br>  <br> That scene with the horse was pretty underwhelming though. <br>Most of it is</br></br>  <br> 720p </br>  <br> anime </br>  Blimey that .50 Cal was weak as shit<br>Sound design guys step yer game up</br>  <br> /a/ </br>  <br> Blimey </br>  <br>I'm not the only who think the anime art is a big improvement over the manga, right?<br>I like the manga but it's fucking ugly.</br></br>  <br> Not contrabanding your porn using fish <br>works everytime</br></br>  <br> contrabanding <br>You mean smuggling?</br></br>  <br>Yes, i do.</br>  <br>When you eat the porn to get rid of the evidence, it becomes contraband.</br>  <br>One more reason to dl shit instead of being a buyfag<br><br>lol "offensive to moral standards of reasonable adults". How did you determine who's a reasonable adult, cunt?<br><br>I fucking hate censorship</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How did you determine who's a reasonable adult, cunt? <br>Welcome to the redpill.</br></br>  <br><br>Redpillers are basically feminists, except that they serve male interests instead of female. They're a bunch of hypocrites.<br><br>They're not the good-willed, rational, egalitarian-minded people that are needed to weaken and ultimately destroy feminism, along with its bigotry, fear mongering, and double standards. Every time a red piller opens his mouth to speak on gender politics, it reinforces the idea in the minds of neutral observers that feminism is right and women are the victims.<br><br>"You're only as strong as your weakest link."</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What does this word even mean in Australia? When I see you guys writing things on the internet, I can only think that you speak a separate language than we do.</br>  <br>Will the Dark Elf waifu appear this season?</br>  <br><br>It means the same. Equate it to bitch in American English.</br></br>  I don't know what's more erotic.<br>The girls, the /ak/ porn, or a contemporary army wiping the fuck out of a stuck up and stubborn old one.</br>  <br> Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br><br> Sequel has started, don't know what happened in the interval but it seems like nobody has made babies with Itami yet. </br></br></br>  <br>No I'm just not a retard.</br>   Show sucks <br> /a/ loves it anyway because it has a cute girl in it  <br>Every time. You see the same thing on /v/ and /co/ as well. It's amazing how willing people on this site are to forgive bad quality in exchange for some T&amp;A.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't mean the same. In American English, "cunt" is one of the last, most sacred dirty words that we have yet to dilute through mass, common usage.</br>  <br>   Rory doesn't win. Nobody wins in Gate. It ends with Itami and his harem stuck on the fantasy side. <br>Disgusting. But I guess expected from the country that has mastered unsatisfactory endings.<br> Is the sequel in form of LN or the standard Novel? Is it about him going back or dealing with stuff inside the gate? is he the only one? <br> Are these spoilers easily found in baka tsuki or something similar? </br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>It's really annoying how quickly people change their mind on a show just because of some cute girl and/or loli.</br></br></br>  <br>Show sucks in some areas but manages to do an alright job in others.<br>If you can ignore some plot elements, the nippon steel folded a thousand times propaganda, and other shit, it's an enjoyable dumb ride.<br>Although to be honest, I only expected /ak/ to watch it.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been having fun since the first ep</br>  <br> Not wanting assploding corpses. <br>Faggit.</br></br>  <br> I believe it's LN format. Just lurk around Gate discussion sites, like /a/ or Animesuki. Basically, Leilei figures out how to control Gate magic and they start opening Gates to try and find their way back to Japan and end up finding other alternate universes instead.    Bozes and Tomita have a kid though, so make of that what you will regarding Itami and his ever-growing harem. </br>  <br>did you miss the pol bait threads?</br>  <br>Why would that annoy you? Unless you base your own opinions on what /a/ thinks....?</br>  <br>I rather watch 1 mirrion Obama swordsmen than any redpilling /pol/ shit like oni-sama!</br>  <br>I don't know what /pol/ has to do with my comment, did you mean to reply to someone else?</br>  <br>The last part of your comment actually, back when the anime got announced, both /pol/ and /int/ fuckwards came in like rats, droving /ak/ away.</br>  <br>lmao<br>Can't find he panel from "Crecy" where the narrator mentions it's punctuation.</br></br>  <br>I don't follow vocal opinions on /a/ at all. (That's probably the worst thing to do).<br>But shit like this happens all the time, that's what I find annoying.</br></br>  <br> Shimoneta <br> runaway censorship and indecency laws gone crazy <br> thought crime <br><br> Monster Musume <br> promoting race-mixing and possibly bestiality <br> immigration of animal-like races of "humans" into human nations <br><br> Gate <br> Japanese nationalism <br> JSDF/Japan Army promotional material because Japan wants the ability to wage war again <br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> promotes delusion-enabling (the girl is mentally ill, and instead of making her confront reality, they try to accommodate her delusion, letting her live that way) <br><br> Joukamachi no Dandelion <br> only royalty can rule over us because they have special powers that we don't have bluepill </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, it's annoying because it's common? Are you also annoyed by commonly occurring buyfag and loli threads? I don't think you understand your own opinion.</br>  <br>Actually I like it because I enjoy the idea of a civilized democratic country using obscenely advanced technology to teach backwards authoritarian regimes the errors of their ways. Rory is just the icing on the cake</br>  <br>She looks much better in manga.<br>Hat doesn't look like ears.</br></br>  Best Girl  <br> face slapping <br> banned in australia <br>Literally worse than UK</br></br></br>  <br> You will never see her again so enjoy her. </br>  <br>No, the best girl would be Shino. Unfortunately, the anime has no Shino.</br>  The BDs will have all the censored parts right?<br>I doubt because if they do the average episode would move up from 22~25 mins to 35~40 mins.</br>  <br>I know it's polbait but whatever:<br><br> Shimoneta <br>I like the commentary, especially with japan right now passing decency laws in light of the 2020 olympics.<br><br> Monster Musume <br> nothing wrong with race mixing if the races aren't retarded or disgusting, especially if they are delicious like rachnee <br> immigration isn't retarded if the countries can't hold a steady birthrate, blame white people being cucked and not having babies <br><br> Gate <br>It's retarded as fuck in that front, but they tend to be like that. They are still a cuck country no matter what they wish to be, so whatever.<br><br> Gakkou Gurashi <br>Their priority is survival, if her facing reality makes the group be at risk (by her going into a panic attack and fucking up their safe area for example) then it's better to be conservative when making decisions such as that.<br><br> Dandelion <br>Power rules, if the population hasn't gone through revolution already it means they don't have the means to suppress them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's so sad that although she has good chemistry with Itami, she isn't in the running for Itami's dicking.<br>Cute as fuck.</br></br>  <br>What's annoying about it is the fact that it'll change in a instance and suddenly it's the new meme opinion. It's a really 'sigh and roll you eyes' moment.<br><br>As for those threads they can be filtered, I sometimes poke around the buyfag treads anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> the fact that it'll change in a instance and suddenly it's the new meme opinion. <br>Again, why does this inconvenience you?</br></br>  <br>Fuck you nigga, Elf best girl.</br>  Anyone else boiled with rage when  the prince mentioned the japanese slave? <br> Fuck, I just wanted the jsdf to deploy without mercy upon their ass. </br>  <br>She will appear again to deal with  monster prostitutes  and  Tuka's trauma , then when she and the rest of the squad disappear from the spotlight.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Great. Another anime to watch.<br><br>God fucking damn it.<br><br> How's the backlog? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By how much is being censored i doubt we will see her in the  prostitue saving  and she only was for some pages in the  trauma .</br>  <br>Try asking any American.</br>  anyone else thought those two female squad members looked like grown up versions of naru and hina?  <br>kekd and saved</br>  <br>They surely will be more similar to hostess, being seductive and all but not showing her nipples like the manga. About the other thing this episode made me feel the director has a soft for her so she should at least have a decent appearance secured (not that they'll give her more than a couple of minutes, obviously).</br>  <br> Why does inconvenience you? <br>I think you're mistaken, I've just grown sick of the same cycle. It doesn't overly 'inconvenience' at all. Surely you'd rather see a nice mix of opinions about something rather than a bunch of similar opinions that gives the impression that everyone is thinking the same?</br></br>  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Here's the executable I made if anybody wants to play around with it.</br>  <br>You are this  Faggot, aren't you? <br> All depictions of violence are edgy hurr </br></br>  <br>I agree but when you say the anime anything is better than the manga on /a/ people start having aspie breakdowns.</br>  <br>Not him (and not that it matters), but the violence itself is not edgy, the edgy are the babies who believe that the series is worse just because there's not rape and guts.</br>  I was considering dropping it but the goth loli kind of peaked my interest a little.    <br>Remember /a/non, anime is for entertainment. If you start going OCD, just fucking drop some shit, it's not a fucking job</br>  <br> peaked my interest </br>  <br>961 years old.</br>  <br>So Australia has a giant warehouse of offensive and immoral content they have stolen.</br>  <br>Oops meant<br/></br>  <br> tfw they censored Rory's breasts. <br> mfw this is the result of the retarded pointless morafag law about depictions of naked DRAWN children being illegal <br> mfw it doesn't even matter she's the oldest member of the entire fucking cast </br></br></br>  Haha you guys are so easily pandered by cute girls.  <br>It's being "studied" by top men.</br>  <br>It directly impacts on the severity of the narrative. I didn't even feel real when the dragon's arm was cut off, let alone when her fuckhuge axe was slicing goons to pieces with nary a blood splatter. It will likely omit the 'we might have to give them out bodies' scene, and if they keep this shit up, the prince scene and consequential beating will also have no impact. The violence and rape is hardly hamfisted in GATE as it is in other shows, and to omit it adds nothing and only takes away.</br>  <br>I wonder if that warehouse actually exists. Imagine how box castles you could make in that fucking place. The 8yr old in me is getting shivers</br>  <br>My dick knows what it likes.</br>  <br> this <br><br>When Rory goes medieval on those guys, you know it's for a good fucking reason in the manga</br></br></br>  <br>No but i cant resist girls in military uniforms, my only weakness</br>  <br>Damn, man. You gonna cut someone with all that edge!<br>Go get wasted or something.</br></br>  <br>I had a feeling it was wrong, I'm so sorry anon I know I'm a failure ;_;</br>  Why is the opening so shitty.  <br/>  <br> Edge <br>...what? What exactly was edgy about that post?<br><br><br> And now we proceed to never get a rational reply </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone needs the gore to understand the severity of the situation depicted, but to each his own.<br><br><br>We already knew they were murderers. The dead raped bodies are nothing but shock value.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Every country has one.<br>Most of that shit gets destroyed in a timely manner.<br><br><br>I wonder how someone as young as you cannot comprehend the world he lives in. Children are supposed to be fast to adapt.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gore <br> Michael Bay </br></br>  <br>You shouldn't have to "understand the severity", it should be immediately apparent to you. If you're relying on the audience to piece together the scene and mood, you're a fucking failure of a writer.</br>  <br> Most of that shit gets destroyed in a timely manner. <br>Except in the UK it seems, where heads in the gov are apparently mayor players in the pedo market.</br></br>  <br>Gotta start a twin thread for this type of thing that starts every new episode. Call it Gate Bane and friends editors or something.</br>  <br>We have a temporary storage area in Adelaide where confiscated goods are held for about a month if things are wrongly taken but at the end of that time everything is burned at the local CBC mill</br>  <br>Isnt michael bay obssesed with dick mutilation?</br>  <br> censorship <br> good <br><br>Pick one, retard</br></br></br></br>    <br>When we capture shit like this in Eastern Europe - Russian pedo underground flicks mostly - they destroy that as fast as possible. Some times in front of the TV crews on site.<br><br>I wonder what will happen when we get thought crime laws like in the West, some pedo might get his lolishit sliced up on camera.<br><br>I'd personally laugh my ass off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're just nitpicking at words. Who said that such "understatement" was a long process devoid of responsibility from the author. Good lord.<br><br> Not everyone needs the gore to see the severity of the situation <br><br>There, happy?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> "Yo bruh, the manga is edgy as fuck." <br> "How so?" <br> "It has blood and corpses." <br> "Many animes and movies have blood and corpses." <br> "Only Michael Bay movies and animes do, fuck off." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No that's RoboCop.</br>  <br>The problem with thought crimes is that they always seem far away from you until you're being the group being targeted.<br>So while it would be funny entertaining to see pedos get their dick chopped on tv, it stops being funny when let's say... one can't watch hentai, or gets 10 years in prison for watching anime.<br>Also, I'm a bit of a conservative myself, but let's say the far left goes into power... then I'd fall out of favour and get fucked in the ass for not supporting leftist propaganda.<br>Not cool, but I don't know what first world countries are safe from being en route to thought control.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Yo bruh, the manga is edgy as fuck." <br> "How so?" <br> "It has fucking Yellow Eyes, Red Dragon." <br> "W-Wha-" <br> "YELLOW EYES, RED FUCKING DRAGON" </br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't know who the JSDF chick with long black hair is meant to be.  <br> Who said that such "understatement" was a long process devoid of responsibility from the author. <br>Now who's nitpicking. This is anime, there's no 'long process' to understand anything. That said, the author is most definitely passing the responsibility onto the responder. <br><br> Not everyone needs the gore to see the severity of the situation <br>Have you even read the manga? The tone is vastly, vastly different to the anime. It's like if the manga were MA15 the anime is trying to get a PG adaption going, and it's just fucking stupid. Face it, that kind of gore goes hand in hand with GATE. It's all about modern weaponry meets asshole-roman medieval fantasy, and the result is messy as fuck. Cleaning it doesn't just do nothing for it, it actively harms the adaption. <br><br><br>The tall beauty in his squad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First aid? the "nurse" of the team. Sarcastic, has like 3 lines in total, sadly.</br>  <br>Kurosawa, the medic chick, elfs best friend</br>  <br> I wonder how someone as young as you cannot comprehend the world he lives in. Children are supposed to be fast to adapt. <br>What is that supposed to mean?</br></br>  <br> animes </br>   comfy GATE thread with no shitposting or excessive complaining about anime secondaries <br>What universe am I in?</br>  <br>Nah, it's still funny.<br>We already had a thought police once in this part of the continent, you know? <br><br>I'm pretty sure leftism will come back and in force. It's inevitable. And then the robots will kill us all.<br><br>~Good end~</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a joke.  Nice trips. </br>  <br>Gate threads are like that actually. Not much controversy except for the anime pussyfying the manga</br>  <br> Now who's nitpicking. <br>Not sure, but sure you're contradicting yourself (or the other guy if there's such). Why are you saying that passing the responsibility to the responder cannot be avoided when you previously said that such thing makes you a failure as a writer. And how can the audience piece together the scene and mood if everything is immediate.<br><br> Have you even read the manga? The tone is vastly, vastly different to the anime. <br>Of course it is. It relies vastly in shock value and usually fails at portraying any other type of scenes, making them forgettable. THAT is being a failure as a writer/author.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Michael Bay treatment. <br>Uh, it did get PG13'd</br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure leftism will come back and in force. <br>With the recent development in Greece I doubt that. Many consider it a failure of the left.</br></br>  <br><br>Improved version</br></br>  <br> Now who's nitpicking. <br>Its not nitpicking when you have this much to select from.<br><br> Select food <br> select dog and meat <br> Captcha passes </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What am I reading.</br>  <br>oh god just stop<br><br>if your shitposting it isnt funny and if you're serious its just fucking cringeworthy</br></br></br>  <br><br>This.<br><br>Precedence is a major concept in the law system, which in turn makes the law very prone to the snowball effect. Furthermore, the law is an ax, not a scalpel. It's not good for only picking off one very specific case that people don't like.<br><br>The minute that you see something in the law that belongs to a general concept that's outright dystopian in nature (such as producing or possessing something that offends someone else being a prosecutable offense, simply because someone is offended), you need to chop the head off of the snake before it has a chance to grow.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't illegal because it offends someone anon, it's because kids by definition have to be abused to make it. As far as drawings/animu are concerned, banning that or not is not exclusive to either right or left.</br>  <br><br>That's both wrong and retarded. I could draw a picture right now and say that it's a naked 10 year old. Number of children existing outside of my head that I would have abused in doing so: 0<br><br>This is a claim that you'll have to substantiate. You can't just push it because it makes sense in your head. What do you have to prove? That a real child is made to model naked, and that this model is transferred directly into the work, essentially making it his or her image.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to real shit in the first sentence, not art.</br>  <br><br>People weren't really talking about the real thing in regards to thought crimes, though.</br></br>  <br> kids by definition have to be abused to make it <br><br>I guess that's why kids sexting themselves for their underage romantic partners are prosecuted for producing and distributing child porn. They're abusing themselves.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is one of the many cases where the law has failed miserably to catch up with modern technology.<br><br>This would have been a fairly rational policy 30 years ago, in 1985. How would images of underage b7 make it into the public arena back then? It would take a bit of work, at least. The odds of it being abusive in nature are overwhelmingly high, and prosecuting the distributor would be relatively free of complications. What about in 2015, where devices to take and send pictures are exceedingly commonplace and easy to use? This is most likely done at the volition of the kid, and needs to be treated completely differently than if adults were found to be pressuring them into it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This sounds like a pile of horse shit.</br>  <br>No wonder people shitpost over there.</br>  <br><br>ayyy</br></br>  Yes  <br> inb4 children can't consent to abusing themselves. </br>  <br><br>No, I'm not picking this up for the goth loli no matter how perfect she is. I already fucked up when I watched danmachi for Hestia</br></br>  <br>No, but you WILL pick it up for the goth loli, wizardess, and the elf trio.</br>  Just caught up with the manga.<br>It's monthly right?</br>  I wish to be the garter  <br><br><br>I still prefer her armored dress</br></br></br>  <br>In a perfect world</br>  I tell you, these design decisions are ruining it for me Rory looks too old, Lelei looks too young<br><br>It's like they switched their apparent ages</br></br>  Leilei a cute.  <br>Nice try but I'm waiting for Delilah and Persia, goth loli is just a bonus.</br>  So, Rod of steel Inn story next episode right?  <br> Why are you saying that passing the responsibility to the responder cannot be avoided when you previously said that such thing makes you a failure as a writer. <br>I'm not. I'm saying that that's what who ever is in charge of the story for this adaption is doing, not that that's what all authors should do. <br> How can the audience piece together the scene and mood if everything is immediate <br>It's not up to the audience to piece together the scene and mood, it's up to the writer and his creative cues to demonstrate it.<br><br> It relies vastly in shock value and usually fails at portraying any other type of scenes, making them forgettable. <br>I disagree. The tone is there to support the point and add flavor to the scene, an overarching flavor that is carried out well and consistently from beginning to start, mind you. I don't see it as pointless shock value, as you so obviously do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>First image if you guys wanted it</br></br>  <br>Does Persia and Kurata get the happy ending they deserve?<br> First Japanese demihuman son/daughter </br></br>  So since this is based of a complete novel, I can pick this up without worrying that it'll stop somewhere in the middle, right? <br><br>People have been saying it's really censored to hell though. What have they skipped or glossed over so far?</br></br>  "Oh no! Oh no!"  So i'm two episodes and from what I'm getting this is going to be a haremshit anime. Damn and the premise of the show was pretty good with the whole modern military vs old fantasy warriors settings.  Real quick, is the opening for this anime the same artist that did HotD OP? Sounds extremely similar.  <br>yes</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>The only one that seems to be gunning for the MC is Rory the magician doesn't care and the Elf is to Preoccupied with her PTSD.</br>  which is better novel o ln?  smug goth loli shoujo  <br>We don't really know. They may be promoting the LN version and it's sequel.<br>Censor is basically just gore censor plus one or two missed pantsu shots.<br><br><br>It's very light on the harem subplot and hijinks. Most of it involves infodump, politics, and retarded medieval fucks who never took a class in anything despite being royalty.<br>Harem as of now consists of:<br>Gothloli, blonde elf, sorcerer, and later on  brown elf, and probably the princess. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>yeah, though the UK does this shit too, a friend of mine has fallen foul to customs a few times.</br></br>  <br>The mage just wants knowledge and the Elf has Issues. Rory is the one who actually wants the MC's D</br>  <br> Living in NSW <br><br>Fucking degenerate, live in any other state and they don't give a shit about this garbage.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, I see. Pretty impressive knowing for a fact that I never rewatched HotD and sure enough 5 years later I recognise this particular artist.</br>  <br>I love the manga art. I love how it goes off-model all of the time to express character.</br>  <br>It's like 'motherfucker' you can use it as friendly greeting to one or multiple people, or use it to insult people.<br><br>In Australia it makes a heavier insult, but still has the same weight as a greeting.<br><br>Or at least this is what I have learned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 'motherfucker' as friendly greeting to one or multiple people <br>Real life America is not like Hollywood America.</br></br>    <br>To where she looks like a she-Krillin?</br>    <br>I see, you can use motherfucker like that in Aus too, so I just made an assumption.<br><br>But it's like that anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> Kurokawa <br> Forgetable </br></br>  <br>What this cunt said.</br>  <br>She does in the manga  and soon to be in the anime </br>  <br>+1 maymay</br>  <br> lagging bounce </br>     A-1  <br> LN <br> Expect piss <br> Get Generation Kill the Animation <br><br>Seriously as an Armoured Recce solider I usually hate "military: anime but Gate is alright.</br></br></br></br></br>  As someone reading the novel and having glanced through the web novels, it's pretty intense.<br>I haven't taken to reading the manga yet but from a glance, the scales of political message taking priority over story from 1 to 10, the manga is a 4, the LN is a 6, the novel is a 7, and the original webnovels were a 8~9.<br>We aren't far enough in the story to see how much the anime will go on the whole political rhetoric route.<br>By the by, it's not just anti-US sentiment. It's more anti-China, as well as anti-Japanese politician. The author has a huge bone to pick with the Japanese political system and believes the most virtuous people in all of Japan, are of course, the JSDF. The author clearly believes that if people of JSDF character (and military character in general) were calling all the shots, Japan would be the #1 superpower.<br>The political message is a little more complicated than that, and the author isn't some caricature of 'NIPPON BANZAI'. He has complex views on war, peace, etc. But there's no doubt that his political views often get in the way of the story.<br>It's the kind of right wing 'moral panic' that the average Japanese people are weak, sheep minded people who should re-aspire to greatness instead of wallowing in recession and complacency of peace.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a fucking failure of a human being if you failed to understand that a fuckton of people died in every large engagement in these 3 episodes.</br>  <br>what diferences are between ln ,novels and web novel?</br>  <br>even if Pina get corrupted by Itami ex wife BL doujinshi she isn't shit</br>  <br>Now that I think of it, I like her anime axe design better. It looks more like a ritualistic tool, which makes it more intimidating in action.</br>  <br> I haven't taken to reading the manga yet but from a glance, the scales of political message taking priority over story from 1 to 10, the manga is a 4, the LN is a 6, the novel is a 7, and the original webnovels were a 8~9. <br>Having only read the manga, this makes sense now. Everyone bags on Gate for being hyper nationalistic, but it really didn't seem like that at all, so I chalked it up to general shitposting. Turns out I just had the best version of it to judge on, and the rest really lived up to the criticisms.</br></br>  <br> Implying the street brawl in the first episode in anyway reflects the wholesale slaughter of the first invasion In which just the closest streets were littered with enough corpses to build the mountain of corpses the not!romans planted their flag on <br>ha</br></br>  <br> street brawl in the first episode <br>Guess some people really do need to be spoonfed gore to really grasp what's going on then.</br></br>  <br>what anime is this?</br>  <br> Implying </br>  ED song is nice. Release date when?  <br>i have a feeling its the thread title,</br>  <br>constant jump cuts are annoying and immersion breaking<br>especially for a show where the whole premise is lets watch a modern army fuck up medieval armies</br></br>  Being stuck in the role of MC's friend is suffering. ;_;  <br>He get the waifu of his dreams</br>  <br> constant jump cuts <br>The goddamn show would be slow as hell if they didn't. So much talking.</br></br>  <br><br>When the only thing that you're shown is people running away and a couple of people laying down, you don't really get the feeling of a massacre. That's not the viewer's fault, that's the fault of bad directing.</br></br>   mangafags once again ruined the thread <br>so far i enjoyed this show as dumb entertainment</br>  <br>As usual, mangafags just can't stand to see people enjoying something that is good, without having to spoil the plot for us and complain about how "so much was censored."</br>  <br>He's a blessed man.</br>  <br>just read it, everything was spoiled already in the first and second thread since the episode 1 airing</br>  <br>At least /a/ only complains about the designs.<br><br>The people complaining about the gore censorship are redditors.</br></br></br>  <br>I really don't care about spoilers. At this point, I've pretty much seen everything in anime and manga, and I am so emotionally detached from all but a few characters in all but a few anime each season that if you told me someone was going to die (the loli goth, for example), I would only be disappointed that we wouldn't be getting any further fanservice or cute scenes with her. Gate is purely a wish fulfillment manga/anime anyway, so you really shouldn't feel so special about having read the manga.</br>  <br>You can't infer people dying from invading horseback knights and hammer orcs?</br>  <br><br>It could have been one hell of an ineffective invasion where only a few dozen people died before the invaders got driven back. It wouldn't be the first. We're also not given any emotional attachment to deaths that might have happened, which is something that the ugliness of gore is good at providing.<br><br>People who only saw the anime thought that maybe the riot police could have beaten their asses. That should tell you something about just how ineffective they looked.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Seriously as an Armoured Recce solider I usually hate "military: anime but Gate is alright. <br>As former armored recon I find that I have a hard time watching media with depictions of the military now.</br></br>   Secondaryscum acting haughty <br>Sounds about right.</br>  <br>who say i feel special?<br>The manga is nice but thats all</br></br>  Why the pink pantsu? This is heretical to Emroy  <br>The riot police did beat their asses. Held off the first wave until the JSDF got there.<br><br>I don't think we needed emotional attachment to people we barely know, but had enough knowledge to know that they all got slaughtered. It's like a by the numbers event where you know it's terrible if the military is called upon downtown Tokyo to respond to it.<br><br>Besides if they took their time animating the gore and the human mountain, the anime would be slow as hell. We wouldn't be seeing the girls until episode 5 with all the setup they had to do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not you specifically, but one only has to read any Gate thread to see all the mangafags claiming superiority for having read the always infallible and superior source material.</br>  <br>Its not exactly spoiling considering the manga and novels have been going on for a couple of volumes you special little shit</br>  <br>Case in point: </br>  <br>The manga isn't even the source material.</br>  Waah, people are being mean and discussing how the adaptation is different from the source. Waaaah  <br> Gate is purely a wish fulfillment manga/anime anyway <br>Every show is a &gt;i wish to see this premise being animated/acted out so technically, all forms of fictional entertainment is wish fulfillment since you're fulfilling the wishes of people wanting to see it on the silver screen/boob tube</br></br>  <br>This is literally the only thing that pisses me off when comparing the anime to the manga.<br><br>So the anime is insanely watered down for a more widespread audience because JSDF advertising. Fine.<br><br>I can easily tolerate that as long as it's still entertaining, and treat the anime separately from the manga.<br><br>But turning Kuribayashi from the Japanese equivalent of She-Hulk into a moeblob is something I won't tolerate, especially given the scene where she makes that prince her bitch. If the anime does it, it'll be part hilarious, and all nonsensical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon, if any organized military force showed up without permission on US soil, the US military would be right there, even if there wasn't a single casualty. It's the same for any country. This isn't indicative of anything.<br><br>Just admit that the anime staff didn't do a good job at representing the parts of the invasion where the empire was on the attack as being anything more than a minor, relatively pathetic little skirmish.</br></br></br></br>  I hate how her voice is completely different from the novel  <br>No, that's not what wish fulfillment is. There is such a thing as telling an interesting story... Shinsekai Yori would be a great example of this. It has a story to tell and it doesn't let the characters get in the way, as can be seen by the numerous time skips. But then you get something like Monster Musume, as an extreme example, which doesn't really have a story to tell. It's just a set of scenes about what if a character lacking any defining traits were to live with a monster girl, that would be neat huh. <br><br>As you say, a wish fulfillment anime is just an animated "premise." That's the problem. There's no real story, and the characters are fitted to the premise, rather than the other way around.</br></br></br>  <br>Shinsekai Yori was something else besides bamboozling an autistic pretty girl to give you her virginity?</br>  <br>I prefer how she speaks in the manga, her voice is noticeably more flat.</br>  <br>I hate this fucking country sometimes. At the very least if something gets banned by the ratings board it's only barred from sale, rather than prohibiting importation or possession.<br>But seriously, we have an insane amount of government-run coddling.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Taz<wbr>HNpt6OTo</wbr>  [ ]<br>Gonna be soon</br>  <br>JSDF ain't US military anon.<br><br>I think we got everything relevant from the portrayal of the invasion anyways, we didn't need to spend more time on it than we needed to. They portrayed people getting killed by knights and orcs and we fought them back with guns. The little girl was there to portray people losing their loved ones in the invasion.<br><br>Didn't need gore for that since it would slow the pacing down by a mile too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MELL has a pretty specific sound, anon.</br>  Won't be getting that whoring out discussion, there are less capable girls  The real question is how does the army know what is supposed to be the body temperature of an elf?<br>Do we just say it's 37°C and be done with it?</br>    <br>Would they have a slower metabolism? <br><br>Also, I can't wait to see based rory BTFO that loud dyke cunt in the conference.</br></br></br>  <br>The premise of modern tech vs fantasy world means it's wish fulfillment and can't tell an interesting story now?<br><br>Kids with special snowflake powers dealing with adult matters is nothing new. It's the same reason why people loved Evangelion.<br><br><br>You're thinking of something different.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not?<br><br>Or rather, MC and his team went in after others did, so they went in more informed. He even has a little book to help him translate, you know.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't</br>  <br> The premise of modern tech vs fantasy world means it's wish fulfillment and can't tell an interesting story now? <br>What's the story, then?<br><br> Kids with special snowflake powers dealing with adult matters <br>Is that really all you got out of Shinsekai Yori? Be honest, did you drop it after the first episode?</br></br></br></br></br>   despite the superior technology and weapons a gothic loli is still stronger when fighting a Dragon <br><br>Never change Japan.<br>That said I'm glad the waifus are finally showing up or else I'll have to stick to nitpicking every wrong military related thing they do.</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking anime is soo plain and shit compared to the manga.<br>And due to it becoming an anime, it got licensed and now I've to find somewhere else to read the fucking manga.</br></br>  <br>Read up the latest manga chapter.<br>Rory is best girl, not even a fucking contest.<br>Blonde Elf a shit, worst girl with queen bunny.</br></br></br>  <br>There's probably some elf mercs in the POWs from the invasion.</br>  <br>Her axe is a holy relic and she is an apostle of God, on her way to her own ascension. I bet she could have solo'd that dragon.</br>  <br> "It would be suck" <br>Zapp of dick suck? What's he doing in GATE?</br></br>  <br>It's an adaptation of the LN, so comparing it to the manga useless and stupid.</br>  Rod of steel is a dumb name for something they think as magic  When is chapter 48 of the manga coming out by the way  <br>Gate is just a haremshit in the end no matter the medium.</br>  <br> queen bunny <br>get a load of this faggot who can't appreciate a girl going all out in her quest for revenge</br></br>  <br>Too bad she's a loli though. Why do they always have to make gothic girls lolies. Cant we have a normal woman with a gothic look? And I'm not talking about making her wear edgy black clothes with black eye makeup, just a normal dress.</br>  <br> What's the story, then? <br>Read the manga. The premise isn't everything because if it was, I wouldn't have known that Haruhi and Apartment had time travel done better than Steins;Gate or that DxD was a good action shounen if tits were removed.<br><br> Is that really all you got out of Shinsekai Yori? Be honest, did you drop it after the first episode? <br>Did I say it was bad? I said it was nothing new. Coming of age stories are dime a dozen and overused as shit even if they don't fail to garner high reviews from teenagers like you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can only imagine how much that must ruin media for you. A basic understanding of science and a bit of Arma has spoiled many of my favorite things for me as it is.</br>  <br>Does their enemy have someone as strong that can take on the military?</br>  <br>If the aime is worse than the manga, we don't give a fuck about 300 years of semen making a plopping noise.</br>  <br>I've heard this from before. Was there ever a confirmation that it's directly based off the LN from the author or director or whoever?<br><br>If that's the case, then it's just more reinforcement to treat the two as separate entities.</br></br></br>  <br> Their enemy <br>Not THEIR enemy per se, but they run into another apostle who isn't friendly. Things could have gone bad if not for the fact that<br> They were already fire dragon hunting, and just happened to find her and the dragons atthe same spot, blowing the fuck out of everything with heavy artillery.  </br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Steel ain't magic.</br>  <br>Oh, but water and fire is totally magic, right?<br>That's moronic.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't sound magical</br>  I was excited for this. I've always wondered what would happen if modern warfare met medieval fantasy. I didn't even make it past the opening. :(  <br>The original Japanese pretty much straight up says "The Iron Penis".<br><br>In trying to sound more acceptable the translator chose a vanilla word.</br></br></br>  <br>What if it's enchanted steel?</br>  <br> haremshit <br>Her ex<br>Rory<br>???</br></br></br></br>  Would you kill yourself on the chance to make Rory tingle her dingle?  <br>Impervious to all attacks , except jet fuel. </br>  <br>0.0137/10<br>Way too obvious, try to be more subtle next time.</br></br>  <br>What's next? Are you gonna say that a "Flaming Sword" is an unsuitable name for an enchanted sword?</br>  <br>The story is about a fantasy situation where teens get stuck in.<br>But instead of a band of angsty teenagers we get rational adults in a genuine military outfit tackling problems angsty teens would need 1-2 episodes to mull and get angry over.<br>Besides the obvious gore censorship, it's why you don't see much character introspection from this series like SSY.<br>It's because they're developed and mature enough to calm down and try to think of the right thing to do.</br></br></br></br>  <br> But turning Kuribayashi from the Japanese equivalent of She-Hulk into a moeblob is something I won't tolerate, especially given the scene where she makes that prince her bitch. If the anime does it, it'll be part hilarious, and all nonsensical. <br><br>They turned her into a moeblob, so doing the beat-up scene would probably clash too much with that.

Since her hands are for holding, not hurting and all that jazz.

What fucking do?</br></br></br>   You will never start a loving family with Rachnera. <br><br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>Naw dude. She dresses like a basic bitch. As far as cute goes, Mero and her wardrobe got it locked down. Sexy award goes to Rach. And best clothes goes to   Cerea-chan </br>  <br>Loen is a drawfag around these parts. I don't see what the problem is here.</br>  <br> miia  <br> a best <br>Pick one and only one.</br></br></br>  <br>Goth loli is embarrassing and Rachnera dresses like a slut</br>  No working thread? I'm disappointed.  <br>Aight thanks<br><br><br>Even when I'm so desperate I'll never touch deadfish</br></br></br></br>    <br>Picture has some punch to it</br>  <br>She was able to serve male customers and hasn't punched anyone since the 3rd season started. She's going to make it!</br>  <br>No shes going to go maybe four episodes without punching boil over and nearly break Takanashi's jaw then they both decide it's best to go back to the way things were.</br>  What?<br><br>Who was the fucking nigga that recommended this shit? If by any chance you can see this please kill yourself</br></br>  Just enjoy the ride and don't try to think too hard.   is this what they call the calm before the storm?   <br>These threads were gold. One of the few times almost whole /a/ went  apeshit  insane over something.</br>  <br><br>What was his name again?</br></br>  <br>3 boards finally convinced me to give this a second chance, fuck all of you. It was good, turned to boring shit for infants.</br>  <br>VIVA TORTURE!</br>  <br>Sir, please don't stand up while the ride is in motion. Thank you.</br>  <br>I think its time to rewatch samunenco. Thanks for reminding me.</br>  <br>slim shady</br>  <br>Derrail ape, mind fuck ape, autis trigger ape, rape ape.</br>  <br>Punitive Primate</br>   he expected shitmurai hurrmenco to be good because it had a vocal circlejerk on /a/ <br><br>Mein sides</br></br>  <br>Samunenco was good, but was a fucking wild ride.<br><br>You just have shit taste anon go back to your shonen, harem threads.</br></br></br>  <br>ex dee</br>  Keep going, faggot.  <br>Slicing Bonobo</br>  <br>Rustled Simian</br>  <br>Same here. I started watching this because I saw a lot of people recommending it.<br>I stuck with it until episode 9. The first few episodes were fine, but then it turned into kiddie shit.<br>I skipped through a few of the later episodes, it doesn't get better.</br></br></br>  <br><br>New fags and crossboarders. Get out.</br></br>  <br> disliking low budget trainwrecks means you are newfag or crossboarder <br><br>lol hipsters</br></br></br>  <br>SUMMER HARDER</br>  <br>Summer is a myth anon, this guy is just a troll or baiter.</br>  He has the pendant, what if by mistake EMIYA appeared instead of Gil?<br><br>He would probably have won.<br><br>None of the other servants would have any chance against EMIYA.<br><br>Saber would be pwned easily.<br><br>Also the Holy Grail wouldn't have burned the city, thus making this Shirou Emiya having a normal life and not becoming Archer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The exact same thing that happened to him when he had gil: death by Kirei.</br>  <br>Why would EMIYA betray him? I'm sure he would remember Kirei and I'm sure he hates him too.</br>  <br>Emiya is an average Servant that is good at being Batman.</br>  <br>Archer<br><br>Going against his dad AND Saber<br><br>Anta baka?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirei would have withdrawn from the war if he hadn't been sitting in on Gil's philosophy class.</br>  <br>Emiya only won in Round 5 because his fight with Shirou made him pissed off enough to kill everyone else. In HF and Fate he does well, but ultimately performs pretty poorly.<br>I mean, let's be real here, he had the will to kill everyone in his way just to shit on this kid, and he still lost the War.<br><br><br>You don't need a betrayal for death by Kirei.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kariya would have died from being transformed into bacon.</br>  <br>Archer can beat everyone in 4th war.<br>Well not everyone(JETS) but he can make some tough fuckers kill each other(Saber fight JETS).<br><br>When any of the other servants of the 4th war has a chance of killing Heracles 5 times without using their hougu (pretty much the same as him not using UBW, except UBW is more broken) then you can tell me they can beat archer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rider gets hrunted<br><br>Caster dies like he did.<br><br>Lancer is shit<br><br>Saber can't win against him.<br><br>Lancelot can probably beat him but I don't know. Best chance here is making Lancelot and Saber fight then kill the one who wins.<br><br>Assassin is shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also<br><br>Archer&gt;Kiritsugu<br>He would read all of kerry's shenanigans and beat him playing the same game</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do people think EMIYA could beat Saber?</br>  <br>Because he can? Unless she has Avalon he's stronger.<br><br>He's not going to get in laser beam range since he's not dumb and he knows everything there is to know about her.</br></br></br>  <br>Hes Nasu's Batman.<br><br>Pulls some bullshit out of his ass to beat someone he has no business beating because TACTICS.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not tactics.<br><br>He's just strong AND batman.<br>He didn't kill heracles all those times with tactics</br></br></br></br>  <br> he's not dumb </br>  <br>Why would Archer want to win a war he knows has no point?<br><br>why do you think he never wins in SN? He just doesn't care.<br>He knows all the masters and he knows all the servants, he can tell rin and kill them all.<br>He doesn't want to.<br><br>He can tell Tokiomi about the grail and about Sakura. Then Tokiomi being a retard would try to deny the fact that grail is shit, Archer would kill him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hercules said Archer's swordsmanship was so good that it gave him a sword boner and made Hercules regret being summoned as a Berserker.<br><br>Archer was acknowledged by Hercules</br></br></br>  <br>He'd probably just follow Kerry around to see how he was like.</br>  <br>The real question is:<br><br>What if Kerry had summoned EMIYA?<br>I want to see that so much</br></br></br></br>  <br>What would kerry use as a catalyst?</br>  <br>Nothing.<br><br>It's his son. They also have similar personalities</br></br></br>  <br>What if Shirou summoned EMIYA?<br><br>He can use his penis as catalyst no?</br></br></br>  <br>What would hercules know about swordmanship? He was known for carrying around a gigantic wooden club with which he beat dudes to death.</br>  <br>Shirou will always summon Saber 'cause Avalon.</br>  <br>In Nasuverse, Hercules used 9 Lives with his club and basically anything he got his hands on.<br><br>9 Lives is Hercules's swordsmanship.<br><br>It is Hercules's everything and can be applied to anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2006+9 <br> There's people that still don't understand Archer class is known for "he can end the war but doesn't fucking want to" </br></br>  <br>Sometimes errors happen in the world which causes things to go in an unintended way even without the proper set up. Kind of like in SMT games when you get a fusion error.<br><br>Like in the most recent drama CD, where Medea accidentally summoned Nero.<br><br>Shirou himself is just an error in the world, they aren't too uncommon.<br><br>Might take some million different world lines, but mistakes happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Phoenix Wright got an anime?<br><br>No but seriously guy looks like Edgeworth from afar just with darker hair and no cravat.</br></br></br>  <br>Tokiomi still fucks up somewhere really important.<br><br><br>Tell that Robin, Chiron and Atlanta</br></br></br></br>  <br>EMIYA is a shit tier servant even with a perfect master.<br>He'd be even worse with fucking Tokiomi as master</br></br>    <br>In a fight, who would win, Hercules with his gigantic wooden club, or Andrew 'Bitches don't know about my stick' Jackson?</br>  <br>He hasn't won a single fight.</br>  <br> buttmad Saberfag <br><br>every time</br></br></br>  <br> He can tell Tokiomi about the grail and about Sakura. <br>If that was really such a big deal to Aacha, why didn't he do anything about it in FSN, and what would be different in Zero that he would act differently?</br></br>  <br>He won against Gil, anon.</br>  <br> literaly useless if the enemy isn't mindlessly running towards you </br>  <br>Andrew would be invincible if it was a one on one duel<br><br>If you challenge him to a duel then you're already dead. His endurance shoots up three ranks and he can ignore blows while giving you a fatal hit in turn.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he doesn't want to?<br><br>The only one he lost and he actually wanted to win was the shadow</br></br></br>  <br>Herc would force Andrew to pay denbts.</br>  <br>Andrew would wail on Herc so hard that the cabinet would have to pull him off.</br>  <br> Because he doesn't want to? <br>Wow.<br>Archerfags<br><br>Denial isn't just a river in egypt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont think EMYA can kill Rider.</br>    <br> I dont think EMYA can kill Rider. <br>Literally anyone can kill 4th''s rider.</br></br>  <br>That's nearly as pathetic as counting "Assassin's" wins in HF where the Shadow plays plot</br>  If Gilgamesh is the strongest Servant, and EMIYA can functionally do pretty much the same thing Gil can but better, and Shirou can do the pretty much the same thing EMIYA can, does that mean Shirou is stronger than any Servant?  <br>Hrunting</br>  <br>No.<br>Do you intentionaly ignore the "I can ONLY beat Gil" lines?</br></br>  <br>Hrunting isn't strong.<br>Did you even read that scene in HA?</br></br>  <br>No.<br><br>Shirou can't.<br><br>Archer can beat a fair share of servants. The one that gives him most trouble in 5th war is probably lancer.<br>Not even berserker.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you familiar with rock, paper, scissors?</br>  <br>Those didn't make sense.</br>  <br> Hrunting isn't strong <br><br>please shut up.<br><br>Also Iskandar is not strong either, Zero servants are all weaker than SN not counting Saber of course</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Assassin notes that Shadow isn't on his side, it would just as soon kill him as anything else nearby. It's nothing more than a stage hazard. <br><br>He lures other servants close to the stage hazard, and tries to bank on their pride getting the best of them as they don't retreat immediately.<br><br>What he's doing is entirely fair, and within tactics.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they do make sense.<br>You just chose not to believe them because they contradict your headcanon</br></br>  Much better question is, how hard everyone around is fucked against this combo?<br>Mage that can kill any other mage.<br>Versatile as fuck servant who can straight assassinate masters from a distance.</br></br>  <br>Wait are you actualy defending the Shadow as a plot device?</br>  <br>Lancer, Berserker, and Rider say hello</br>  <br>Let's assume that for some reason Archer actually wants to help Kiritsugu win.<br><br>They win.</br></br></br>  <br>Bazett and Lancer would win easily.</br>  <br>I agree, servant fights should be no noble phantasms saber only</br>  <br>He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. He still kills berserker 5 times. Which part of he didn't want to win the war was difficult to understand?<br><br>Rider in HF? That was because of the field</br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. <br>Dude just stop<br> Against a normal opponent this is little more than a mildly annoying ability, but it is the natural enemy of a certain King of Heroes. </br></br></br>  <br>Why can't Shirou?</br>  <br> Also the Holy Grail wouldn't have burned the city, thus making this Shirou Emiya having a normal life and not becoming Archer. <br>That's the reason why he can't summon EMIYA</br></br>  <br>Same guy each time, go fuck yourself trying to turn what we're talking about into "I hate shadow, its a terrible anything, Nasu also hates it confirmed, oh wait it was confirmed he actually liked it a lot?, doesn't count, everyone hates it, its the worst anything, it sucks, don't defend it its just objectively bad and sucks and everything".<br><br>Can't mention it without that same autist showing up and trying to be an autist.<br><br>No that's clearly not what was being talked about in that last post. The last post was entirely about how Hassan in 5th war had victories that counted because he used strategy. Has nothing to do with how it worked, it was all him luring the opponent into fucking themselves up and it worked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bazett and Lancer <br>Caladbolg'd to death.</br></br>  <br> He doesn't use UBW against Berserker or Lancer. <br>It is borderline useless against anyone who isn't Gil<br> Rider in HF? That was because of the field <br>No he gets petrified by her eyes.<br><br> b-but he didn't want to win </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hed try to stop dad from saving him and thus would kill himself like he tried to do in fate stay.</br>  Archer probably would have pissed off Saber, Lancer, and Rider because of his complete lack of chivalry or heroic honor.<br><br>I would love to see Emiya VS Lancelot though. I think Archer would have definitely saved Sakura if he was in the 4th war.</br></br>  <br>Just beat EMIYA with superior firepower</br>  <br>You actualy think only one person dislikes the Shadow?</br>  <br>Why do you always take like ten times the words to say stuff than it requires</br>  <br>There is literally no way for him to beat Lancer who isn't being fucked by a command seal.<br><br>To be fair relatively few people could.<br><br>Hell Archer was lucky as shit that war, he was the only servant to not be actively fucked by a shitty master.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you dumb? Seriously are you dumb?<br><br>He can project more weapons to kill Heracles all the time he needs you retard.<br><br>Against Lancer he didn't have any mana nor his intention was to EVER win the fight. <br><br>Do you go through the VN with ctrl? Hell even the anime implied he didn't want to win against Lancer at any point and that he didn't have much mana anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Archer would have definitely saved Sakura if he was in the 4th war. <br>You base that on?<br>He didn't give a shit about her in HF and was trying to kill her before he got BTFO by Rider</br></br></br>  <br>Because he's nasu</br>  <br>He doesn't use UBW against anyone you mouthbreather. Using UBW or not is not an indicator of him going all-out. He's at his strongest when he uses tactics, not swinging swords around like a nut.</br>  <br> Ranged attacks  <br> Against the Choo Choo baby <br>Oh you</br></br></br>  <br>It's only one guy that goes autist on it in the same way with the same words each time. Tr</br>  <br> Are you dumb? Seriously are you dumb? <br>Considering you are actively disregarding Word of God i'd return that question<br> Against Lancer he didn't have any mana <br>Dude he was powered by Caster<br> Hell even the anime implied he didn't want to win against Lancer at any point and that he didn't have much mana anymore. <br>What part indicated that?<br>And yes he obviously didn't have mana anymore after the Aias got busted by Gae Bolg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was going to kill Rider before the Field kicked in and then Rider used the Mystic Eyes.<br><br>Read it again.<br><br><br>He knows everything about lancer, he can just use Rho Aias and defend himself against Gae Bolg. <br>That is if he actually has a master and if his intention is to actually win the fight. He didn't want to kill Lancer in that fight at he church.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 5th Wars anti-Emiya is Rider since the Pegasus since he doesn't have enough mp for those delicious A++ BPs. Second is technically Assassin due to some absurd terrain advantage stopping Archer from just sniping him.</br>  <br>Lancer has no protection against AOE.<br>Caladbolg is a huge and powerful AOE which he can launch from a distance not even aiming at Lancer directly.<br>Even if it won't kill him it will obviously kill Bazett.</br></br></br>  <br> he can just use Rho Aias and defend himself against Gae Bolg. <br>Oh yeah that turned out so well.<br>Archerfags are worse than Shikifags</br></br></br>  <br> The result was Preta! </br>  Face the facts. Archer knows every single servant identity.<br><br>He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody.</br></br>  <br>Fucking bullshit son of a whore</br>  <br>Word of god says Shirou can't trace cool shit when we see him trace Caliburn and fucking Avalon.<br><br><br>Word of god means nothing</br></br></br></br>  <br> He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody. <br>And he still loses every fight.<br>That should tell you something</br></br></br>  <br><br>OP there's a upcoming novel that depicts this scenario but I can't for the life of my find it. Anyone know what i'm talking about?</br></br>  <br>Reading is hard apparently</br>  <br>Which part of <br> He doesn't have a master <br> He doesn't want to win against lancer <br><br>Did you miss again? He just wants to kill Shirou, and not even that.<br>Jesus read the VN or watch the anime again</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A fanfiction of that already existed.</br>  <br>You didn't want that Mara anyway.</br>  <br>No.<br>There was random art in TMAce</br></br>  <br>Why can't people simply understand Archer has no interest in other servants or the war?<br>He doesn't want to win the war, why are you counting fights he has no interest in going all out as fights to count his full power?<br><br>Did you all miss UBW?</br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't have a master <br>But he fucking does?<br>Did you read the VN or even watch the anime?<br>Caster is his master<br> He doesn't want to win against lancer <br>God damnit<br> h-he didn't want to win </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Caster was not his master anymore, he used aias and run out of what he had</br>  <br>Archer clearly beats any other Servant in a butler-off</br>  <br>Yeah, he's classy as fuck.</br>  <br>you know when someone starts a type moon thread and you know they have no idea what they're talking about?</br>  <br>You really think someone would do that?</br>  <br>Just look at Archer's track record<br> 1st against Cu <br>Saved by Shirou and commenting that he would have died had that not happened<br> 1st Saber <br>Saber stomps him<br> Berserker <br>kills him 5(?) times off-screen and dies<br> UBW Berserker <br>Takes a live with sniping while he's distracted<br> Sasaki <br>gets completly fucked up <br> Caster <br>Yeah he beats Caster.<br>Everyone beats Caster<br> 2nd Cu fight <br>barely manages to stay alive<br>baits Cu into thrown Gae Bolg thinking he can block it<br>gets BTFO<br>Cu loses interest in killing him<br> Shirou <br>loses<br> Assassin <br>Same as Caster<br> Shadow <br>dies</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ill-mannered guido with an attitude problem <br> classy <br>If you're scraping the very bottom of the barrel, sure.</br></br></br>  <br>He's right tho.<br><br>In the 4th war aside from Lancelot who has a chance nobody can beat Archer. <br>He can just make Lancelot and Saber kill each other.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please get your timeline straight.<br>Caster only stops being Archer master when he betrays and kills her<br>Where do you think all the mana to heal himself up after Gae Bolg came from?</br></br></br>  <br>1<br>Didn't use rho aias that can deflect normal gae bolg easily<br>2<br>protected Rin, said by herself it was her fault for counting stars<br>3<br>Kills him 5 times and doesn't use all his arsenal<br>4<br>Fanfiction tier, he can just trace more and more powerful NP<br>5<br>No he doesn't<br>6<br>Sure<br>7<br>Doesn't want to fight and kill Cu, stated when he revealed the whole point of the fight was distracting Caster.<br>Cu understands and goes away<br>8<br>Doesn't want to kill him<br>9<br>Sure<br>10<br>Sure, no servant can beat the Shadow, several times said by everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about the one where he snipes saber in F/HA</br>  <br>He serves Rin pretty well.<br><br>He's one of those Otome games classy dudes</br></br></br>  <br>But that's wrong. Emiya isn't even above average. He's only especially strong against Gil. He'd get fucking trashed in the fourth war without being part of a significant team.</br>  <br>Not even same dude but this is kinda dumb.<br>Archer is hellish strong, definetely stronger than 4th war servants.Or do you mean because of the stats? those mean shit and we all know it, especially with Archer's hability when using NP.<br>Hell the fact that he can kill basaka is proof enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, look, Emiya loses when he doesn't use all of his tools.<br>SERVANTS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO USE EVERY ABILITY IN EVERY FIGHT</br></br>  <br> Didn't use rho aias that can deflect normal gae bolg easily <br>Dude no<br> Takeuchi: So, would Archer get hit? <br> Nasu: For sure. But since he knows about it, he wouldn’t approach Lancer in the first place. If it looked like Lancer was seriously getting ready to use Gae Bolg, Archer would already be frantically getting as far away as possible. <br>CM 3<br> doesn't use all his arsenal <br>You base that on?<br> Fanfiction tier, he can just trace more and more powerful NP <br>I'm counting what he did not what your fanfiction says<br> No he doesn't <br>Please read the fucking VN<br> Doesn't want to fight and kill Cu <br>that is literaly never said<br><br> the rest <br>b-but he didn't want to beat them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How about the one where he snipes saber in F/HA <br>You mean the one where he tries to snipe Shirou and Saber easily destroys the first 4 Hruntings?</br></br>  <br>If you can somehow convince Emiya to actually fight the war in earnest, it doesn't matter how shit his master is since he will pretty much turn into Kiritsugu and use any means to win. Stats don't really mean shit for him when Mind's Eye basically means he can hold his own even when way over his head, and his skillset is bullshit enough that he can kill Heracles 5 times in melee. <br><br><br>To be fair, Nasu mentions Archer would have gotten out of range if Lancer really tried using Gae Bolg, and the Saber fight wasn't really much of a fight since he was too busy having flashbacks of her. Also, killing Berserker 5 times in melee is far more impressive than what practically every other Servant in the war can do save for a full-power Saber and maybe Cu, and he's pretty much never serious save when he finally tries to kill Shirou, or when he notices shit is getting real in HF.</br></br></br></br>  Archer killed Heracles 6 times.<br><br>Just wanted to correct that to he ones saying it's 5</br></br>  <br> He enjoys battle, and he would have grieved that his match with Archer "deserved better" had he been a normal Servant. He displays a brief sense of rationality while thinking this, wishing to have matched sword techniques with Archer to his heart's content and passed a satisfying time. </br>  <br> Nasu mentions Archer would have gotten out of range if Lancer really tried using Gae Bolg, <br>that's a nice formulation for "run as away as fast as he can against the fastest servant  besides Achilles "</br></br>  <br> literaly quoting the wiki <br>Just kill yourself</br></br>  <br>It's not wrong so why would I not quote it?<br><br>I'm not going to play Fate again to find a screenshot mouthbreather</br></br></br>  <br>I want people to tell me the servant aside from Archer than killed Heracles 6 times in melee.<br><br>Six times in melee, please tell me a few names.</br></br></br>  <br>It's an incredibly good tactic so long as Cu can't maintain the Gae Bolg charge while he's running after Archer.</br>  <br>Considering he drops the stance and jumps towards the enemy before using it I don't think Archer's tactic works that perfectly.<br><br>Gilgamesh does 12<br>Saber with one Strike of caliburn does 7</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Atalanta is effectively faster than Cu.</br>  <br>Emiya Shirou/Seibah. 7 times in one strike.</br>  <br> in melee </br>  <br>In that case Herakles jobbed too fast for others to do it.</br>  <br> Melee <br> Gil <br> Killing anything <br><br>Sure a team-up and it's said several times it was becaus the two of them did it. <br>And I should say that Archer can do something similar since he can trace Caliburn too.<br><br>Now tell me anyone else</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know how Archer told Rin to spend the war in her basement?  <br> And I should say that Archer can do something similar since he can trace Caliburn too. <br>No he can't.</br></br>  <br> Shirou can <br> Archer can't <br>'k i'm out</br></br></br>  <br> Now tell me anyone else <br>There are only 3 routes.<br>Fate: Jobs against Saber/Shirou<br>UBW: Jobs against Gil<br>HF: Jobs against the Shadow, Jobs even harder against Shirou afterwards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only in the anime, and even then that was probably still within it's 10-meter range. Cu has never been shown charging Gae Bolg while on the move (outside of the technicality of his throwing it in midair).<br><br><br>He should have it in UBW considering Shirou does, and unlike in Fate he had no Saber dreams to see it there. Not that it matters since Caliburn having that level of power is a one-time deal only possible because Saber was holding it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you completly miss the context of that scene?<br>Caliburn by itself doesn't do shit.<br>It was the "Miracle of being reunited with it's owner" that made the 7kill strike possible</br></br></br>  Something I can't understand.<br><br>I mean I know Nasu sucks at writing things without plotholes but hey.<br><br>Why doesn't Archer has Avalon as a NP? Say what you want but the dude has it on his fucking body since forever.<br>It doesn't make 1 bit of sense him not having Avalon's powers or something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did you not read the many times where he is successful</br>  <br>Avalon doesn't do anything without Saber around.<br><br>Likewise, he might simply have lost it. I think only UBW Shirou gets to keep it.</br></br></br>  <br> Only in the anime, <br>Read the fucking VN<br><br> The beast jumps. <br> Lancer instantly appears in front of the girl, as if he teleported, and… <br> Thrusts his lance at the girl's feet. <br><br> "" <br> It was a bad move, even to my eyes. <br> With the lance already lowered, it wouldn't be effective to aim low at the girl. <br> To prove my point, the girl jumps over the lance and moves forward to slash Lancer away. <br> At that moment. <br> Gae... <br> Bolg <br><br>And he covers 30 meters in "an instant" with one jump in the VN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Avalon only works while connected to Saber in some way. Outside of that, the image essentially "fades away".</br>  <br>You mean the ones where he kills Avenger while he sucks at imitating Shirou?</br>  <br>Fate <br>Plot bullshit.<br>UBW<br>Enkidu, okay sure but he rekt Saber before. Hard<br>HF: Everyone loses against the shadow what's your point?. <br>And who's ARM(one fucking arm) is giving Shirou power to kill Berserker?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think only UBW Shirou gets to keep it <br><br>Avalon prevents you from aging, right? Does that mean Shirou has eternal youth in the Good End?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't understand how people can say this. We got more than enough proof to realize Archer is really good at fighting, thinking and using his broken projections</br>  Can Archer beat anyone in melee combat?  <br>He'd get wrecked if he goes and fights like a Saber instead of Hrunting everybody's ass from a safe place like the Tohsaka manor.<br><br>We all know he's not going to do the latter, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker<br>Gilgamesh<br>Medea<br>Medusa<br>For some reason not Saber even tho she's weaker than Berserker</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lancer and Saber would wreck his ass unless he starts symphatizing abilities from other weapons which is what he probably did to somewhat survuve Hec</br>  <br>Even if his stats aren't the highest, his skills are noted to be top notch, to the point that even Saber must admire his purity.<br><br>He kicks Hassan away without even trying in HF<br><br>Julius in Extra says he's a servant who excels in drawn out battles. Not sure you get if if you're asking, but he is a master of his blade, without tracing anyone elses abilities. If he was simply tracing he could never match another master, he can only match masters because he too has learned his style completely.<br><br>Anyone who hasn't mastered their style cannot fight him in melee.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Medea <br>Anon please</br></br>  <br> For some reason not Saber even tho she's weaker than Berserker <br>Maybe because Berserker doesn't have any technique?<br> unless he starts symphatizing abilities from other weapons <br>Copying other people won't help him he has to rely on his own skills/techniques<br><br> He kicks Hassan away without even trying in HF <br>Yeah but that's Hassan#<br> Anyone who hasn't mastered their style cannot fight him in melee. <br>That is so fucking stupid considering we're talking about servants</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I still don't understand how Archer was able to kill Berserker even once. It doesn't make any sense.  <br>He asked.<br>I just listed the ones he can.<br><br>He can't Lancer for sure.<br><br>I won't believe he can't beat Saber in Melee because of what I said about him beating Heracles while Saber can't do anyhing against him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's really strong?</br>  <br>Woops, for some reason I thought it was the opposite. My bad.</br>  <br>My bad, meant you were talking about that dumb scene with him breaking through the ground like some bulldozer. Regardless, the fight in Shirou's backyard is still damn close range and (more importantly) still doesn't show him charging Gae Bolg while on the move. Nasu makes no mentions of whether Archer's attempts to break the fight would end in either result, so there's still grounds to believe it's possible. <br><br><br>He stands a good fight against anyone who isn't like Saber/Lancer and aren't complete masters themselves. Even then, he still won't lose just because Mind's Eye can make up for the difference in stats/skill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you're replying to me what other anon said.</br>  <br> Emiya <br>We should note that this is an Archer class Servant. He does surprisingly well in close range for any non-Gilgamesh of his class.</br></br>  <br> Tohsaka's my Master? Yes, YES----- <br> fuck, it's her dad <br> tfw your lifelong partner is a little 6 year old girl <br> tfw your dad is alive and being a mega edgelord cheating on his wife instead being of a hero <br> tfw your sister isn't even in Japan <br> only 1 female Servant <br> no exclusive female Masters <br>Yeah, fuck the 4th War.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And faggots like you are the ones saying Archer is weak.<br><br>He's just strong, there's nothing weird about it. He's fucking strong, intelligent and has a large arsenal of useful weapons. That's it.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserker against normal servants wins because they're really good at one thing; the servant will do that one thing, kill one live and then lose.<br>Archer gets to kill him many times because <br>a) he has many weapons<br>b) Berserker doesn't bother to parry attacks a normal servant would</br></br></br></br>  <br>Rin wasn't his partner</br>  <br>gar</br>  <br>At minimum, that quote is very alike the one from the VN.</br>  <br>People really hype up "Can trace abilities and stats" when that's not how it works. He's not ditto who can have A+ in all stats if he wants. There's a reason he doesn't use the whole "Tracing others abilities or skills" so much as a servant when he's perfected his style. Tracing someones skill he can only get to maybe a 7 on the scale, a master is at a 10 on the scale, he's more suited to just using his own custom fighting style that he's created along the way where he's also a 10 in it. Gilgamesh has a 4 in skill, but a 15 in firepower.<br><br>Tracing someones fighting ability to fight another master of their blade, it would surely lose. Tracing Arthur's ability to fight Lancer, or Lancer's ability to fight Arthur, he'd surely lose. Against a true master of their craft, an imitation of someone's craft could never help him match up. Its not his style, it doesn't fit his body like his own style does, its just an imitation, its not him knowing it inside and out but rather just mimicking the form, there's a difference between mastery and simple imitation. A master would know everything about it inside and out.<br><br>He can use different weapons to figure out a path to beat others, but if he wants to match a master in close combat its gotta be in his own field.<br><br><br> That is so fucking stupid considering we're talking about servants <br><br>Any caster would probably lose in Melee, aside from maybe Tamamo who's also mastered CQC ironically, or Cu. Gilgamesh hasn't mastered his melee skills so he can't compare to Emiya who can fight up close on his own, but Gilgamesh has his own skills that let him had the edge on others.<br><br>Whether Archer can beat another master of their craft is a toss up depending on pure skill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Berserker does bother to parry tho.<br><br>He protected himself against Caladbolg II because he noticed it would kill him</br></br></br>  <br>Oh right.<br>Then maybe Archer uses lots of distraction to take him by surprise, or attacks from many angles at once.</br></br>  <br>Was he at peak condition at this time?</br>  <br> aside from maybe Tamamo who's also mastered CQC ironically <br>She's directly mentioned to be shit at CQC in Extra<br>Also pretty sure there are a lot of potential Caster's who are good in melee.</br></br></br>  <br>Tamamo of the Crotch Kick Explosion style of fighting<br><br>Castration is her specialty</br></br></br>  <br>She mastered a fighting style inbetween Extra and CCC. Her strongest attack in the game is now a melee.<br><br>She talked about learning this move in the seventh week of Extra.<br><br>Her fighting ability isn't too bad, she's about the only Caster that won't die immediately in close combat. Against enemy servants and random viruses she stands up tall with her little hand mirror. Her combat ability sucks as per Casters, but among Caster's she stands out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?<br><br>Berserker? Yes.<br>Or Archer? He was ok but he didn't use UBW that could help him take a few more lifes maybe</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was immediately post-Archer fight. He got killed so many times so quickly his regen was just kicking in and he was somehow thinking lucidly compared to his normal madness. <br><br><br>And shown to somehow hold her own versus a fucking Saber in CQC.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember. It should be noted that ANY Archer minus Gil would have a far harder time in close range.</br>    <br>Please never again argue with Game mechanics<br> Also the reason why any off your servants win even one match is that Hakuno is the bestest ever who could win a grail war with Avenger </br></br>  <br>Gil would just get killed in close range. In like 2 swings or something</br>  <br>She's a Caster who stood up to Gawain in close combat, withstood and blocked his blows, and managed to come out ahead.<br><br>She's also a Caster who managed to magic blast someone with the same magic resistance as Saber in F/SN to death. Completely breaking the dragons magic resistance.<br><br><br> "These things didn't happen, they don't count" <br><br>Except they did happen, it was an entire point that your servant fought these people who had these skills in particular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was ok but he didn't use UBW that could help him take a few more lifes maybe <br>It's borderline useless against anyone but Gil.</br></br>  <br>Of course. MC is broken as fuck that's why you can kill everything on extra.<br><br>I really want to play CCC why the fuck is it not translated?<br>Extra looks awesome on my phone</br></br></br></br>  <br>Likely so but Gil's the kind of guy who would use Enkidu or a weapon like Ea if ever forced to go close range against Berserker-Herakles.</br>  <br> ANY Archer minus Gil <br>Gil is absolute shit at close range. Any redheaded high school kid with a week's worth of training could easily beat Goldie in a sword fight.</br></br>  <br>Its maybe being translated, but it'll take ages.<br><br>If you're impatient, there's a blog that has most of a route translated.<br><br>https://tsukinoura.wordpress.com/<br><br>Game has almost as much text as F/SN, plot custom written by Nasu as his big project recently, and probably too lewd for western audience.<br><br>This is some ultimate level lewd right here</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> borderline <br>Well said. It can give him the edge in speed and distracting enemies with sword showers while he plans/traces something powerful enough.<br><br>It's not useless, you fags can't understand that it's not all about direct power, if it was like that then he would be like gilgamesh.<br><br>I doubt he can kill Berserker 12 times but a few more yeah</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil's at least average in melee.<br>He relies on hard counter though.</br></br>  <br>He is but this is considering a Gil with crap like Ea &amp; not being overwhelmed. if Shirou have Gil enough room to breathe then Gil would have won.</br>  One thing that's great in CCC, the interaction between the cast is way up since they're all working together from the start and playing off of each other.    <br>Enkidu would work but taking Ea would result in his arm getting btfo like shirou did</br>  <br>Two weeks. And he technically cheated since he stole a lifetime's worth of CQC skills from his future Servant self within those two weeks.</br>    <br>Considering that Gawain is in charge of cooking, this implies that everyone else is worse.</br>  <br>I thought Shirou survived the fire due to Avalon being put into him by Kiritsugu, but wouldn't it have already become practically useless by that point since Saber was gone then?</br>  <br>Not always. Gil didn't have Ea ready initially &amp; had to pull it out.</br>  <br> I mean I know Nasu sucks at writing things without plotholes but hey. </br>  <br>Well, he was disconnected from a master and receiving little to no mana at all.</br>  <br> fuse it into something else <br> five minutes later <br> preta in the field <br> preta used macca beam! <br><br>GOD DAMN FUCKING SHIT SON OF A BITCH KARMA</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was one of his key traits anon, I mean the author is retarded and doesn't know what smart is but he is supposed to be.</br>  <br>[crotch violence intensifies]</br>  <br>Supposedly it still had a little bit of her mana left in it. It's the reason why it healed him there and then stopped doing shit during the rest of his life.</br>  <br>He still had to be hospitalized. Avalon probably had a minimal effect at best.</br>  <br> he can kill basaka <br>when did that happen?</br></br>  <br>No, he just felt like making it that day because he always thought he was the best back in the day, since Arthur never had the heart to tell him he sucked. He tells stories about how Arthur sat in front of his cooking with dead eyes unable to say a word as she slowly ate, clearly she loved it.<br><br>Sakura, EMIYA, and Tamamo seem to be the types that can cook well.<br><br>Gatou, Leo, maybe Rin and Julius have very minimal skills at best<br><br>Gawain and Elizabeth are the worst at this but can't realize it themselves.<br><br>When the Student Council is just shooting the breeze one day they think about opening up a cafeteria to make things a bit more fresh here, and experience the dorm life style a bit more. While talking it over they sort of realize none of them can cook too much. Rin seems to have the basics down, Gatou can only make rice gruel, Gawain is a vegetarian who only believes in quantity, and Julius cooks curry out of an oil drum when he's on the road.<br><br>They have to keep things light and joke around because the situation is so hopefulness, yet they try to stay upbeat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, CCC has a translation?</br>   Snipes the shit out of everyone in HA <br> Again and again <br> On every damn loop <br> The only way Saber was able to beat him there was through nearly infinite repeat and error where after getting her shit sniped every time she finally found a infinitely small opening she could finally exploit <br> And even then it was just barely <br><br>How in the flying fuck people think Archer is a weak servant is beyond me. Damn secondaries.<br><br> If he's so strong why didn't he win the HGW then? <br>In case you did not notice, which you most likely did not because you are a secondary retard literally no fucking Servant of the 5th, except Miss MUH BRITAIN gave a fuck about the Holy Grail. The 5th is a fucking joke of Holy Grail War.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Archer and Kerry do not have an ultimate attack. Unless you count the totally useless STRENGTH MOVES MOUNTAINS thing.</br>  <br>Keep dreaming</br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br>Fate</br>  <br>You forgot Team BAHSAKAH also wanted to win the war, well the old man.</br>  <br>He kills Berserker several times in the Fate route.</br>  <br>Caster is most definitely his master during that fight. <br> being this retarded </br></br>  <br>Rin can cook in Stay Night. If that matters</br>  <br>Don't bother.<br><br>People still say Archer can't beat anyone and he's weak.</br></br></br>  <br>They really are retarded. Even if they have noble phantasms, he has an infinity of them.Even if each of them were a tenth of the strength of each noble phantasm, infinity/10 still equals infinity.</br>  Has there ever been a HGW where everyone is actually fighting for the Holy Grail instead of being nothing but retarded petty squabbles?  <br> because he always thought he was the best back in the day <br>But what if Arthur allowed him to because everyone else was worse?</br></br>  <br>The third one?</br>  <br>I like when people actually know what they're talking about.<br>Thanks</br></br>  <br>Where are anti-archer fags now? Why are you ignoring this?<br><br>Archer is a weakling right?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Some just don't die when they are killed</br></br>  <br>secondaryfags BTFO</br>  Why does no one in Fate actually own a car?<br><br>I remember there are a couple of parts where people have to rent taxis and stuff.</br></br>  <br>HA is non-canon fanwank.</br>  <br>HA is responsible for Prisma, the most important part of this franchise.</br>  <br>it's canon tho secondary</br>  <br>who doesn't? nearly anyone has the age to drive</br>  <br>Extra Rin is a middle east terrorist, in the resistance against the plutocracy in the West.<br><br>She knows about survival and killing, she's far more skilled than normal Rin in some fields, but she's far more awkward in some other fields that might be considered "playing around" since she grew up in nothing but a battlefield.<br><br>She probably knows the basics of cooking for survival and how to treat poisons, but nothing too complex. Seems to still like Chinese food at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>UBW isn't Archer's trump card, Broken Phantasms are. Those are what trigger Fragarach's autokill in F/HA.</br></br>  <br>She's armed all the way down to the panties.</br>  <br>No one owns one that I can think of unless you want to get into stuff like the racing episode of Carnival Phantasm.<br><br>Closest thing is that Shirou owns a lot of bikes.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Iri's Mercedes is still on the Einzbern mansion so Illya owns it.

Too bad she sticks to those twin tails since she looks up to a certain someone else perhaps.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a fucking second.<br><br>Extra Rin's ZR is actually just really long boots?</br></br></br>  This was supposed to be a costume in CCC  Faces  <br>Yes</br>  For someone who hasn't touched the Extra games yet, can someone tell me if there's an actual legit waifu sim element to it? Can you get with your servant, or Rin, or whatever?  <br>Jesus Christ. That /and/ being blonde? Why is Extra Rin so inferior?</br>  <br>You get with your servant in the CCC endings, you have a brief "we'll always have each other" servant thing at the end of Extra original before things happen, you kiss either Rin or Rani in Extra and have some minor chemistry with them, you get with Sakura in the final ending of CCC but really its a different Sakura from F/SN so don't complain<br><br>CCC is a game all about love, but not entirely in a dating sim way.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, the Grail is corrupted, so it has a really high chance of picking shitty Masters.</br>  <br>You mean superior<br><br>Don't worry, I'm looking out for you and corrected you.</br></br></br>  You were seconds away from penetrating Saber during her route of CCC, before Rin interrupted by calling on the phone.  Then there's this whore, who won't stop getting naked.  <br>Flat ass.</br>  Every day I come home to this  Being able to dress up the MC sure has enhanced the game as well.  <br>Depends on who you're looking at.<br><br>Mages can't be assed to fiddle with something as fancy as a car.<br><br>Average Japanese high school students, at least in anime, always walk, ride a bike, or take public transportation. I don't know if that's just a thing in anime or if it's really that rare for a teen to drive in Japan.<br><br>Some Servants have their own means of transportation, so there's no need for them or their Masters to own a car.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its like Persona 3 in a way<br><br>Even if the plot underneath is solid, there's certainly that layer on the top where they allow you to fuck around and fun moments with the gang, before the shit hits.<br><br>Then someone dies and its sad</br></br></br></br>  <br>3 was a bigass full out war that the nazi's got involved in and THATS when angra mainyu finally joined the mess as a servant instead of fucking around in the grail causing corruption problems, in addition i'm pretty sure both acht and zouken were in the war fighting each other in their youths.<br>honestly i wish we one day got to see the full version of the 3rd.</br></br>  <br>Yet the second war is still noted to be the bloodiest.</br>  <br> blonde blue eye Rin <br><br>So who was the pitcher and receiver in RinxLuvia hatesex?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it'll happen.

He also wielded a sword called Galatine or another romanization. Apparently its name means "Gawain's sword" or something in another language.</br>  <br> Perfect <br>No, those would be the French fanfiction knights. Gawain is a reasonably flawed character unlike those mary sues.</br></br>        <br>You mean Galahad, the knight so knightly he made Arthur look like a common brute. <br><br>Galahad is the personification of chivalry and martial discipline.</br></br></br>  <br> b-but EMIYA will engage in melee like a retard </br>  <br> Galahad is the personification of chivalry and martial discipline <br>He's the personification of a shitty mary sue.

He noted that for the other servants in the war he'd only give them a simple warning shot, but only for the faker trying to fool them all would he aim to kill.<br><br>It was a strategy where Saber didn't have a single change within her boundaries, outside of her master formulating a plan outside of countless loops to create a single change<br><br> But nyeeh it would work any other time, it was all about Shirou there <br><br>You don't get it worth shit if you're saying that. it was a strategy entirely designed to aim for Shirou. If he was just aiming at Saber he'd come up with a different plan more suited, but this plan was suited entirely around catching the most effective means of death for the opponent. It wasn't a situation where Saber had a single chance because Shirou was there and he knew it, and his range was perfect within that area. If you take out the master, you have won entirely.<br><br> But nyeeh if Shirou wasnt there... <br><br>He was only doing that in the first place because Shirou was there.<br><br>meanwhile Nasu directly says Archer vs Saber is a toss up between who manages to hit who first, both of them have an advantage at their desired range. Its noted EMIYA has an equal chance of killing her no matter what you say.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That fucking scene with Kirei still ending up being the  final boss  in HF is just weird.</br>  <br>Galahad's legend is "Get the grail". He's the insta-win servant no-one will be able to summon because he's too OP and no-one who wants the grail would be pure enough to get it. <br><br>Fisher King having it doesn't work because the Grail isn't in his possession when he's summoned, so effectively Galahad is the better option since he's basically a guarantee to get it due to revisionfaggotry.</br></br></br>    <br>It would love Mapo Tofu but it'd be too broke to afford it, having inherited Bazett's terrible luck and Kirei's need to donate to the church.</br>  <br>He might get the grail, but it won't be the correct grail.<br><br>There's an entire point that the Fuyuki or any other wish granting grail is not the grail of Christ.</br></br></br>  <br> He really is like a self-insert character <br> is like <br>He isn't like one, he is one. I don't mean metaphorically, I mean HE IS ONE. As if being the son of Chrétien de Troyes' OC DONUT STEEL Sir Lancelot wasn't enough evidence.</br></br></br>  <br>OK.... not sure if you're trying to negate my point...</br>  <br>Either way, anyone who's legend involves the grail in any positive way including Percival, Galahad and the like would probably have sick advantage in a grail war due to legends alone.</br>  <br> Galahad's legend is "Get the grail" <br>The entire Grail story was an unfinished tale by Chrétien de Troyes staring Sir Percival. There is no knight more connected to it. No Percival, no Grail altogether.<br><br> Grail isn't in his possession when he's summoned <br>No, the Fisher King had the Grail during the story. If Galahad spawns with the Grail then the Fisher King should spawn with it even more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't Galahad be summoned Ruler at that rate if he has that auto Grail ?</br>  <br>I say he'd be summoned as "Faggot" or "Thief". Percival wants his story back.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure there's at least one 2hu in there.</br>  <br>  If Galahad spawns with the Grail then the Fisher King should spawn with it even more. <br><br>Sorry, should be more clear. Galahad wouldn't spawn with it. I doubt anyone would spawn with it. I'm more talking about Galahad would get overwhelming advantage just because his legend was "Get the grail" get in the "Link opens a chest to get the hookshot" get, not as in "Starts with the hookshot when you start the game"<br><br>Also I'm cool with Percival being Galahad hax tier. Percy if I recall was right there in the legend with Galahad and even if French revisionism changed who was getting the grail, the legend still heavily includes Percival.</br></br></br></br></br>   He has the pendant <br>Well, it isn't Rin's pendant at that point yet, so its impossible for him to summon EMIYA.</br>  <br> Galahad would get overwhelming advantage <br>He should be nerfed for being an even bigger piece of fanfiction than his namesake &amp; dad. If I decided to summon my Mary Sue self-insert who apparently predates Gilgamesh, would it work?<br><br> the legend still heavily includes Percival <br>He only got a glimpse while Galahad undeservingly got the Grail. Under that logic, Lancelot should be heavily nerfed for being unable to get the Grail &amp; Gawain &amp; Bors should be buffed for getting the Grail in some versions of the tale.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best explanation.</br>  <br>He should be nerfed. Galahad too OP, plz nerf but as regrettable as the balance in HGW 2.1.1 is, there are going to be servants which embody poor design and balance. <br>Galahad would be one of them. Gawain with Numeral is one of the others. Percival, Bors and technically Bedivere should be hax-tier as well since if I recall Bedi was boss as fuck in the earlier tales.</br></br>  <br>She would've been sniped if Shirou wasn't there to notice Archer's attack coming after all of his loops.</br>  <br>Thing is, many Servants are definitely weaker than their originals. Karna, Cu &amp; even Diarmuid count. Mahabharata-Karna would make Gil piss himself.<br><br> Bedivere <br>He fights better with one hand than three people. A strike from his spear is worse than nine from most others.<br><br>Sir Kay, Sir Bedivere, &amp; Sir Gawain in "The Rise of Sir Gawain, Nephew of Arthur" could take down Sir Lancelot easily.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"No, how did you detect it before I did...!?" just means Shirou detected it earlier, not that she would never have.</br>  Can Servants beat True Ancestors?  <br>I still don't understand how Saber was able to kill Berserker even once. It doesn't make any sense.</br>  <br>every servant can beat every servant under the right circumstances. Archer CAN kill every single servant in the war under the right conditions. Hassan wins in those cases because he is an assassin and wins only when using assassin tactic. <br><br>Archer can only win when playing batman, not a frontal battle. That is why he lost to Lancer.<br><br>The problem here is that we have too many people who think strength is defined as face-to-face fights. Some servant classes are not designed for that.</br></br></br></br></br>  Would Lancer have won the war if he didn't have a rubbish master holding him back?  <br>A-Ranked NPs go through God Hand.</br>  <br>You can always learn Japanese, EOP secondary scum</br>  <br>Reddit please leave.</br>  <br>Indian Mythos is fucking hax. Letting any Indian near their proper strength is asking for the world to get fucked. <br>It's basically the DC of ancient myths. <br><br>As to the Lancelot thing. Again, it's all down to which source people choose to follow. <br>Either you pick Age in which case Gawain solos Lancelot or you pick popularity which means Lancelot stalls Gawain until sundown. <br><br>Both are annoyingly in conflict with eachother and asshole-ish restrictions for these types of conversations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He is 1000 steps ahead of everybody. <br><br>Can you keep up with him?</br></br></br>  <br> DC of ancient myths <br>It's closer to thousands of years worth of power level discussions &amp; fanwank. The DC universe, even with its 'omnipotent", are nothing next to it in sheer implausible power.<br><br> which source <br>I prefer the ones which don't constantly remind me of Lancelot's perfection.<br><br> Both are annoyingly in conflict <br>Not always, they used to be best friends before Sir Lancelot killed Sir Gawain's brothers &amp; son.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why did Fate/stay night take off better than Tsukihime or Kara no Kyoukai?  <br>No way of taking out Herc.</br>  If Archer is so good why did he get killed by Berserker, especially if he had a reason to live (which was to kill/mindbreak Shirou)?  <br>You mean besides using Gae Bolg on Illya?</br>  <br>Close-Range isn't an Archer Servant's forte.</br>  Why do you cucks sit around talking about powerlevels all day every day?  <br> Implying Cu would ever do that </br>  <br>Logic dictates, he should win if he goes gay bulging the right people, but he's a battle-addict so he'll fight for enjoyment.</br>  <br> Harming Ilya </br>  <br>Lancelot does get shilled a lot. For me personally, I don't really get bothered by it. You can say someone is powerful, you can make them perfect but whether or not I like them is really just up to chance. <br><br>I would wonder what the people who heard the myths during their heyday would think about them. <br><br><br>Waifus and Shonen Fightin. Fate Grand/Order is the culmination of all Fate series. It's is all waifus and all fightin'. <br><br>Tsukihime had the waifus but the actual "Fighting" wasn't really that "Shonen"<br><br>Kyoukai just never stood a fucking chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does the Fate/stay night fanbase hate the UBW anime so much?  <br>He should have miles of range inside UBW.</br>  Can Shirou Emiya beat Kishima Kouma?  <br><br><br>What if he had a master who actually wanted to win and command ordered him into doing it?</br></br></br>  <br>HAHAHAhahaha. <br><br> Probably yeah due to plot convenience but I'd say no if it was a straight fight. </br></br></br>  Can Shiki beat Kuzuki buffed by Caster?  <br>Cause he's really not that good against anyone other than Goldie. He's gotten his ass kicked by all the 5th war Servants except Medea and Hassan, who are notably shit-tier.</br>  <br>He'd get killed by Herc the moment he loses Gae Bolg/takes attention off him. Every Servant could target the master too.</br>  <br>Shiki or Shiki?</br>  <br> during their heyday <br>The French loved Lancelot &amp; enjoyed putting Gawain down. The English loved Gawain yet didn't seem to hate Lancelot too. Modern day people know more about the French fanfiction OC than the original Welsh sadly.</br></br>  Can the Crimson Moon be reincarnated into Gilgamesh?  Soon.  <br>In the VN, Archer apparently didn't use UBW. He did so in the DEEN anime though.</br>  <br> throw gae bolg at illya <br> kite herc while waiting for impact <br>ez</br></br></br>  <br>It's just the purists here who would never be happy with anything short of a word-for-word recreation and Zerofags who were disappointed to find out their dark, mature, adult-cast series turned into kiddy shit.</br>  <br>Which brings me back to my original question. Why did he lose if he's supposedly so good?</br>    <br>Why doesn't Cu just steal every female Master's prana &amp; virginity using his charms?</br>    <br>That's sadly how myths go. Chinese Whispers and all that.</br>  <br>Because he couldn't use his best attacks without killing Illya in the crossfire</br>  <br>Rough situation, match-up, etc.</br>  <br>That's because he was melee-ing like a dumbass instead of throwing/shooting swords, for whatever reason.</br>  <br> Implying Bazett would ever do that or Kotomine would waste a Command Spell on something so petty <br><br>He'd resist it to the end and kill his master right after.</br></br></br>  <br> kite herc while waiting for impact <br> ez <br><br>no</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why does Lancer lose against Gilgamesh lmao <br> Why does Rider lose against Kuzuki lmao <br> Why does Caster die lmao UBW? XD <br> True Assassin &gt;Beating Saber wut? <br> If Berserker is so powerful how cum shirou beatsh im thats not far <br><br>That's what you sound like.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep, it's odd. I wish Key got more attention. He could grow taller than trees, hold his breath underwater for days, etc.</br>  <br><br>Seems easy enough to drag them both into UBW then have a 1v1 in all that free space.</br></br>  <br>Most his weapons were B-class.</br>  Can someone explain to me how exactly Angra Mainyu corrupted the grail? He obviously hated everyone for the reason of hating them. He was a "hero" because of his affect on the people of his era. Was it the wishes that his people put onto him that corrupted the grail, or was it his existence that defined what a heroic spirit was that changed the standards for the Greater Grail? Or is it just convenient.  <br>Not always as Shirou can testify.</br>  <br>So he was Superman basically? <br><br>Some of those old myths were fucking hardcore. Bitches be cutting mountaintops off with just some hard-light.</br></br></br>  <br>Great, give Heracles a clear path to you. That'll work real well. All the swords are a degraded rank, so God Hand laughs at UBW.</br>  <br> killing your competition, which is literally the aim of the game <br> petty </br></br>  <br><br> Not even berserker. <br><br>Nigga what? He went all out against Berserker and lost. He fired his strongest trump card off at Berserker from an optimal distance and full surprise, and Berserker blocked it in an instant and emerged unscathed. So he<br><br> can't beat Berserker in a straight fight <br><br>and <br><br> can't beat Berserker under the most optimal conditions for his fighting style, which is having range and surprise </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends, it isn't asspull-heavy as Pre-Crisis for one.</br>  <br>I swear she says that she drives in HA.</br>  <br><br>Archer does go all-out against Berserker. He's joyful about the chance to really let loose for once with no distractions, no unfair tactics, just him versus one enemy, no holds barred.</br></br>  <br> All the swords are a degraded rank, so God Hand laughs at UBW. <br>Yet he still managed to kill Herc several times, so even if they're -1 rank they're still good enough to hurt which is all that matters. I don't understand your point.</br></br>  <br>I dunno, man. If the myths had moved at a similar speed as comics, Kay would've ended up with super-origami and super-washing clothes powers. <br><br>Kay's powers all seem greatly unrelated THOUGH summoning him as a servant would be pretty sweet because they are unrelated and as such, it would be hard to judge him based on any given power.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Iskander weaker than Medusa? I was just never really impressed with her ever.</br>  <br>He was summoned as a Servant but when he died the Grail registered him as a human soul instead of a Heroic Spirit. The Grail it's trying to fulfill his wish (All the Evils in the World and all that jazz).</br>  <br>Anon, your secondary is showing.</br>   &gt;The only way Saber was able to beat him there was through nearly infinite repeat and error where after getting her shit sniped every time she finally found a infinitely small opening she could finally exploit   <br><br>No, no, and no. Archer didn't kill anyone during his sniping stint in HA except Saber and Shirou. The rest of the Servants didn't bother trying to defeat him, because it would be a pain in the ass. <br><br>It is stated during the scene that if Saber was not forced to protect Shirou, she would have been able to make her way to Archer before his Hrunting spam became too strong for her to block, and the situation would have been very different.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's been fucking long. I read through fate as soon as translation was 100.

Berserker is more than capable of preventing Ilya from coming to any harm, no matter what Archer tries to use.</br></br>  <br>lol no. That's not even a contest.</br>  <br><br>Sure, most True Ancestors aren't monsters like Arceuid with the world's full support and Crimson Moon ready to reincarnate into them.

Shadow was an equal threat to him, these other servants are far beyond him in battle ability, yet he still managed to fuck them over just relying on what's around.<br><br>That's MacGuyver level almost, rather than Batman.<br><br>You might have no power on your own, but you can still fuck over those strong guys by applying a bit of thought.</br></br></br></br></br>  So which class is the worst, assassin or rider?  <br>Rider has won two wars, and they've known to have powerful NP.<br><br>Assassin is only good if its not Hassan.<br><br> But Assassin is never good <br><br>Assassin was one of the last bosses in Extra when it was Shuwen, he was overpowered as shit, and in Apocrypha it showed what Jack could do on occasion. Not to mention that other bitch in Apoc, Semiaritas. She was last boss material.<br><br>Assassin is good, but not when its Hassan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Caster is the worst class, then Assassin.<br><br>Rider's fine. The combat classes speak for themselves. Berserker drains too fast without an Illya tier mana battery.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, Assassin's is Saber's final boss in UBW.</br>  Let's talk about how based True Rider is.  <br>If you think Caster is worse than Assassin then you're pretty retarded<br><br>Caster is a Batman class where they have been known to get very powerful when left unchecked in several wars. Prototype Origins, CCC, Extra, Apocrypha, Zero, F/SN, almost all Caster's to date have in one way or another had a bullshit level powerful moment before finally falling, or they won. Caster is one of the few classes to win a grail war before.<br><br>Assassin has never been taken seriously, you're stupid if you think so. Caster is an actual threat, Assassin is shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was it ever explained why only Hassan can be Assassin in the Fuyuki wars? What's the precedent other than being guaranteed Grail fodder?</br>  <br> Prototype Origins, CCC, Extra, Apocrypha, Zero, F/SN, almost all <br><br>I mean that's basically ninety percent of known grail wars already, they've all had a Caster that's had a moment when they were powerful as fuck more than other servants and almost won it all.<br><br><br>That's how the families set it up<br><br>They made sure that was a rule. Even if other heroes can qualify for it, they made sure to disallow it and force it to be Hassan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was still shit though.<br><br> supposedly so skillful that his swordsmanship was basically his np <br> still loses in a regular sword fight </br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude was half dead already.</br>  <br>Caster, by design of the riutal, is a shit class. <br>At least 3 Servants are strong against its attacks and it has the lowest requirements, usually ending up with bad stats. The fact that setting up a workshop is a requirement says how much they need to make up for their low power. The individual Heroic Spirits can be great, but the class container is the most gimped of the bunch.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm asking why did they make that rule to begin with?</br>  <br>Assassin is the most shit, it literally cannot fight any other servant by nature. It will lose for sure.<br><br>Saying "But Caster has a hard time against three...." doesn't change shit about that. Assassin would lose against any other servant directly, and you say this is the weakest because knight classes give it trouble. As though we haven't seen direct examples of Caster's bypassing such weakness time and time again.<br><br>Casters have been shown to be the most versatile in most ways to date. Not just "Well individually...", but rather just about every Caster to date is what I said earlier. They've all had their powerful as shit if left unchecked moment, they all have a good mix of abilities, and can sometimes be the final boss. Assassin can't ever be a final boss or do anything but kill masters. Against any servant directly it would lose, rather than a Caster where there's a chance.<br><br>You're saying one is the worst because it has a hard time against three classes, compared to one that can't fight a single other servant saying its better.<br><br><br>Few reasons<br><br>Other classes other than the knight classes were designed to lose, if you're an assassin but you're legendary then you might not be very good at your job, a lot of famous assassins wouldn't be called heroes, blah blah.<br><br>They made that class to lose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about SHIKI?</br>  <br>Lancer.</br>  <br>Enkidu, Elizabeth, and Karna have about A rank luck.<br><br>I think Vlad and Benkei also aren't too bad there<br><br>Its mainly the Irish guys that have no luck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strongest Lancer. <br> mfw you watch him pulling an Excalibur out of his ass. </br></br>  Archer class is best class. Every Archer ever would end the war in one day.  <br>Would literally get rekt by Lancelot. Not like Gil would do any different, as him without EA would have gotten killed too, as confirmed by the Kayneth entry and Prisma Illya.</br>  <br><br>I thought it was cool the first time you saw it.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/M0k2FB3fuZ0  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>How would Kenshin fare if he was summoned into the war?</br>  <br> Arthur above Lancelot <br>It's not like she didn't almost die in 10 seconds while using her entire force at defense.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Oh, you're you're that retard again.</br>  <br>Actually, I think retards would say you're twice in a row.</br>  <br>It has nothing to do with Archer being more clever. He just isn't tethered down by anything akin to pride and honor.</br>  <br>He's clearly just a shitty troll.</br>  <br> Shirou tells Miyu to get the fuck out even though she is using Gilgamesh card <br>Even Shirou knows Gil wouldn't stand a chance with GoB alone.</br></br>  <br>An emotionally compromised girl lobbing little more than a dozen NPs would get wrecked. Wow, what a find.</br>  <br> This is what Gilfags actually believe <br>Both Julian and Shirou have seen the Gate power, both think it would get fucked, Julian even goes and says regardless of how many you throw. It has nothing to do with the user.</br></br>  <br>You'd almost expect better bait with all they have to work with.</br>  <br>Cause all the greatest assassins never got caught and never revealed themselves thus never leaving behind a legend. Only the old man in the mountain is known on account of their notoriety being tied not a specific name but a title. Then Nasu went ahead and retconned that so everyone can be assassin.</br>  <br>Plus the name 'Assassin' comes from Hassan</br>  <br>Gilfags literally have one quote that was proven wrong in the later volumes against Iskander and then by Saber in Fate, against one Material entry and the now Illya Route. Not saying Gil isn't strong, it's just that Lancelot KoH is his counter. He was even called Gil ARCH NEMESIS in Volume 2. Gil would have to play it smart if he wants to win, and we all know that ain't happening.</br>  <br>Assassins would make pretty shit servants even in their particular class, all told. I mean their entire methodology with killing in broad daylight and letting everyone know they were the ones whodunit don't exactly fit the specifications of the class.</br>  <br> True Ancestors aren't monsters like Arceuid with the world's full support and Crimson Moon ready to reincarnate into them. <br><br>Go play Kagetsu Tohya and sleep with Arcueid</br></br></br>  <br>I thought that only reveals that the True Ancestors  were made so that they could host Crimson Moon in them, but none of them were 'perfect' enough; the only one close enough to that state of 'perfection' was Arcueid? </br>  <br>It was actually said in Volume 3, but yeah, it is indeed said once.<br><br> Berserker as his Servant also had the mysterious ability of being able to seize others' Noble Phantasms, considerably the arch-nemesis of Archer. </br></br></br>  <br>I want to say that now, I definitely can't take you seriously, but that's been the case for the past half-dozen threads this same tired argument was posted in.</br>  So if EMIYA can beat all Servants, and Shiki can 「kill」 Servants, then could Shiki beat EMIYA?  <br>I have only posted it twice, and last time was like a month ago. Seems like others have taken it seriously enough to post it again. <br><br>You don't even try to address the point. That's just being delusional in the face of truth, it's on the same level of the people that refuses to believe that UBW isn't as good as they think.</br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about True Assassin here</br>  <br>This is probably meant to be a personality issue, like a lot of other servants' "natural enemies" category. Seizing his stuff is, to Gil, likely even worse than counterfeiting them.</br>  <br> Then Nasu went ahead and retconned that so everyone can be assassin. <br><br>You'd be pretty stupid if that's what you think happened<br><br>Its still a class very few can get into<br><br>So far its mainly just Jack the Ripper and Li Shuwen, and Heracles since he stalked a deer once for a few years.<br><br>It was noted Heracles could be Assassin in the original game, its not a retcon. But due to the way the Fuyuki ritual was set up it was supposed to disallow him from being able to get in even if he "could".<br><br>Original game it was noted Heracles could get into six different classes, and it was noted he could get into all of them but Caster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   well… I hate to say it, but the only reason Lancelot was able to fight Gilgamesh as well as he did was due to the parameter boost from being maddened.  <br><br>Fate Zero material<br><br>and even then Gilgamesh was noted to only need to push a bit harder to overwhelm him. It was also said Gilgamesh could end the entire battle in a night if he wanted directly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe, but he is again called a strong enemy in the Zero Material, so that doesn't seem to be the case.</br>  <br>That doesn't tell you much beyond Lancelot being exactly that, which no one is denying.</br>  <br>Nah, Archer isn't weak at all. He's a fairly strong Servant who can convincingly win against a large portion of the cast. That being said, he's overhyped as fuck, with a fan base that are about as bad as the rampant Gilfags, and it's only gotten worse with the UBW anime attracting secondaries.<br><br>I still don't think he could beat Cu even with 'tactics' though. There are quite a few Servants I don't think he has favorable odds against when he doesn't have intelligence from his life as Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>That's with Kariya as a Master, someone who was stated to nerf him.Quote is saying he was doing good, even without the parameter boost, he just wouldn't do as good.<br><br> Gilgamesh was noted to only need to push a bit harder to overwhelm him. <br> That was the same for all the other Servants.  <br>Proven wrong by Iskander and Saber.<br><br> It was also said Gilgamesh could end the entire battle in a night if he wanted. <br>Serious Gil against a Mad Dog, what are the chances of that happening? If it for some odd reason does happen, then yeah, he wins. No one here is saying he can beat serious Gil.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why don't they ever focus on the Church and the people who inhabit it?  <br>He's just going to cite Iskandar and Saber again when Lord knows they have nothing to do with Lancelot surviving GoB in its entirety. Iskandar endured 80 for a short period of time; who knows how long that would've been if Gil hadn't stopped him in his tracks. Saber was heavily wounded by even less, but Avalon allowed her to heal off most of the damage. Lancelot is more skilled than she is, so it makes sense that he'd be able to handle that number without getting torn to shreds, but that says nothing about the hundreds we've seen Gilgamesh fire.</br>  <br>No anon, he's just a boring character. I don't care about a self-insert fanfiction scenario where I get to play at Grail Wars.</br>  <br>Iskandar was heavily wounded by those, too.</br>  <br>It's easier to bullshit a Harry Potter knockoff than an actual religious institution.</br>  <br>Alexander was dead on his feat after the first few swords, but due to his will power of ambition along with the three command spells boosting him he was also at something of the peak of his life.<br><br>Right in front of him was Oceanus, the promised yet unreachable dream. Even if it was impossible, to expect any other servant to pull out that kind of will power in that situation is a bit much.<br><br>He could push that hard because literally he could see all of his hopes and dreams just ahead, fueled further by the command spells telling him to push harder.<br><br>People may say desire doesn't mean much, sure he had no chance against Gilgamesh, he was dead after the first time he was struck, or when his army was wiped out; but his ambition was great enough to keep going even with several mortal wounds. He was little more than a pin cushion, but its supposed to be this moment that symbolized his life and everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would they do that? That would be interesting and great for world building.</br>  <br> Iskandar endured 80 for a short period of time <br>Survived more than 32, proven wrong.<br><br> Saber was heavily wounded by even less <br>Survived more than 32, proven wrong.<br><br> but that says nothing about the hundreds we've seen Gilgamesh fire. <br>Hyperbole. In the final battle vs Saber he started with "hundreds", and she could deal with it just fine, even pushing Gil back. Then he increased the Gate like 3 more times and she was still fine, then for some reason she got injured by 47. Against Lancer, a thousand "swords" appeared, yet we clearly see Gae Bolg Prototype in there. Something similar is said in Zero, when Saber "became the target of a thousand arrows", and she apparently believed she could dodge that if she was uninjured, not even block, dodge.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alexander was dead on his feat after the first few swords, but due to his will power of ambition along with the three command spells boosting him he was also at something of the peak of his life. <br>Nice fanfic. No, that's not what happened, he doesn't have Battle Continuation, the 3 Commands only gave him extended supply of prana, that's pretty much all they did. If he had actually taken a fatal hit, he would have died right there, but he didn't, hence, he survived.</br></br>  Why does Berserker's strength always change throughout Fate/stay night?  How come Gilgamesh forgot how to use swords in UBW?  <br>Yes, no shit it was proven wrong that Lancelot can deal with 32. That says nothing about much higher outputs, which are pretty clearly not hyperbole:<br><br> Seeing this, Gilgamesh again used his Noble Phantasm to float into the sky. Then, his treasury — the King’s Treasures Gate of Babylon — opened in the space behind him, and dozens, then hundreds of Noble Phantasms emerged. <br> Simultaneously, the ends of Enkidu’s earth tentacles transformed into countless different weapons, from spears, to swords, to bows. <br> One breath later, over a thousand projectiles thundered into each other. <br><br>She was getting torn to shreds by 47 simultaneously. Yes, Gil made a thousand swords appear. Yes, she became the target of that many arrows. No, that doesn't mean he fired them all at once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the 3 Commands only gave him extended supply of prana <br><br>Nice fanfic<br><br>I suppose you'll say next the command seal Rin used on Archer in the prologue only lowered his supply of mana, because that's all the can do to you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The headcanon is stronger in your post.</br>  <br>He doesn't, Shirou's just able to keep up with him.</br>  <br>Inside UBW itself or did you just mean the route in general?<br>He barely knows how in the first place, beyond merely swinging them. Furthermore once he and Shirou were inside UBW he was barely able to react to Shirou constantly pressing him with attacks.</br></br>  <br>You should ask how come Gilgamesh didn't use NPs that weren't swords / blades.</br>  <br><br> While the method of usage made little impression, since the three Seals conformed to the Servant's own will and furthermore were activated in succession, Rider received a definite effect from Waver's Command Seals. As long as he aspired toward the action of 'victory', Rider would receive an amplified amount of Prana support compared to normal.  <br>I don't even have to say anything else. It's all there.</br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Gilgamesh use axes, spears, knives or scythes?</br>  <br>Was it implied he had anything else in the original novel?</br>  <br>What is it with headcanon in TM? Is it caused by people copypasta of fanfics or what?</br>  <br>Shirou could trace any of those regardless.</br>  <br>was he summoned as a different class here? In AR he can be summoned as Caster, Berserker, and Assassin and those throwing knives remind me of Assassin.</br>  <br>What does that have to do with Gilgamesh not summoning axes, spears, knives, scythes or thick pots of honey oak?</br>  What if Lancer of Red was summoned by Kayneth in Heaven's Feel IV?  <br>Nothing I guess. <br><br>I know it's the DEEN movie, but here he is countering Gil's stuff, and there are clearly some lances in there.</br></br></br>  <br>It would take him more prana. Even swords he didn't have in UBW would take a good amount to download. If Gil had thrown more of them, Shirou would have run dry sooner.</br>  <br>Double Unlimited Blade Works.</br>  <br>If they are not hyperbole then Lancelot can easily deal with hundreds x3 if Shirou Saber could without getting injured.<br><br>And no, you got it wrong. The thousand arrows comment was made in Zero, he never actually launched them, but Saber seems to believe she can dodge that number. In FSN she was fighting "hundreds" from the start. Also, I would like to think Gilgamesh would throw more at Enkidu than at Lancer or Saber, but apparently this isn't the case if this shit isn't hyperbole as you seem to believe.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Shirou straight up countering Gil blade for blade in UBW? He was using Gil's weapons against him, and as long as its got a blade attached to it, it's fair game as far as being easier to trace.<br><br>If he started throwing shit like shields and his ship of his, it might be a different story.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou gets shanked by EMIYA.</br>  Can any Servant survive Shirou's Triple-Linked Crane Wings?  <br>Hundreds increased 3 times, my bad.</br>  What if Lancelot claimed ownership of Kanshou &amp; Bakuya Overedge? Could he then beat Gilgamesh?  <br> "Reality Marble. So this is your ability…!" <br> I take a step forward. <br> Stuck in the ground next to me are the swords that are floating behind Gilgamesh. <br><br>Yeah, Shirou was just out and out copying Gil's stuff, at least at some point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like he's an assassin or something. They wouldn't have him using weapons like that if he was his typical Archer class.</br>  <br>No, I didn't get it wrong. That was addressing your statement about Zero. <br><br>Shirou Saber never dealt with a hundred during their final battle. He ''loaded'' that many. Nowhere does it say it fired them at her at once like he did with Enkidu. Same with Lancer, whose fight you, and everyone else, have no clue about, because we never saw what ensued after Gil prepped a thousand swords.</br></br></br>  What if Archer used Hrunting and not Caladbolg against Berserker and Caster?  <br>Isn't Arondight better for going against Gil? Those doubled saving throws sure sound convenient for dealing with the unknown abilities of the weapons, and also the SSJ Boost he gets and a Captain America Shield tier Sword.</br>  <br>"Art thou my master?"<br>"Dayummm girl, ain't seen many like you round Compton.

He has armor, why not a shield?</br>  <br> redsakuya.png </br>  <br>Maybe he's dumb? Even Shirou used Rho Aias.</br>  None of the servants could survive a surprise broken phantasm aside from berserker so all he has to do is act like an assassin and blow up their base when they least expect it ( The only servant who has strong enough protection to withstand a noble phantasm is caster who Archer can beat easily)  Will Type-Moon ever make a “legitimate sequel” to Fate/stay night?  <br> No, that doesn't mean he fired them all at once. <br>I thought you meant that he actually fired the weapons, when he never did.<br><br> Shirou Saber never dealt with a hundred during their final battle. He ''loaded'' that many. Nowhere does it say it fired them at her at once like he did with Enkidu. <br>Never said it against Enkidu either. Just that he opened them, he could have used any number at that point going by your logic. And she actually dealt with it. He had hundreds at first, after he increased it like 2 or 3 times, he fired, and she dealt with it.</br></br></br></br></br>   Granted Karna's fiery attribute, one blow is likened to a nuclear weapon. <br><br>Now this is just becoming ridiculous</br></br>  Nao is an anime nerd.  <br>Isn't it great?</br>  <br>Natsuki is a fucking babe</br>  <br>Nao is cute.</br>  Who /triadprimus/ here?<br><br>We did it lads.
