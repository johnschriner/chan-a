[ A side character has never deserved to win more than this girl.  <br>Danchigai was too damn short though,</br>  <br>I agree <br><br>It's a really fun show even though it's only 4 minutes. Haruki and Yayoi best.</br></br></br>  <br>The two pink incest machines are expanded upon. Kanade lusts after her twin. Shu has great incest love for Akane.</br>  <br>Tsundere imouto is best, though.</br>  <br>Is it confirmed that Kanade and Shuu are twins? Shuu could be born early in the year and Kanade at the end of the year. They don't look or act particularly twin-like, even for fraternal.</br>  Why hasn't there been a furniture-based harem/romcom anime yet?<br><br>How long will it be until I can look forward to the anthropomorphic home-deco hijinks of "My House is Falling in Love With Me!", airing in the next season?</br></br>  <br> objectophilia anime when <br>You sick fuck</br></br>  <br>Aren't papers, graphite, and computers objects?</br>  <br>Furniture can't love humans!</br>  It's just a matter of time, OP.  You're crazy, anon. Love between man and furniture is immoral and illegal.  <br>Is that a Buchla on the floor?</br>  <br> Love between man and furniture is immoral and illegal. </br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #7<br><br>Previous thread: <br><br><br>Take it easy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not /a/</br>  <br>Hype.</br>  <br>Inabro, what is your waifu doing in my pantry?  dont mind the shitty instant ramen </br>  <br>Hope you will add Akari next time</br>  <br>Holy cute</br>  Is lolicon really a sickness ?  <br>Perhaps something to trigger a wave of smug could trigger a "smug overload"?<br><br>Non Non Biyori or Nichijou</br></br></br>  <br>Monogatari ones.</br>  <br>Miu.</br>  <br>Miu is best girl.</br>  <br>Sorry I meant to reply to </br>  Do you agree with the Prez?<br><br>Chapters 183 and 184 are up on yomanga for all of you slowpokes. <br><br>Japanese RAWs are out as well for 184, for those inclined.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because idiocy isn't something that I tend to encourage, you mouth breathing idiot.</br>  <br>You mean Gakuto comes up with all the plans and Kiyoshit carries them.<br><br>Gakuto is the true mc of this manga</br></br></br>  <br>pretty sure that's a basic bitch</br>  <br>Kate a shit. A god damn shit.<br><br>Hana used to be a shit when I thought she was just another generic bitch like Meiko, but she's turned into best girl. <br><br>dat body.</br></br></br></br></br>  I think I've been converted to utter submission by Hana. <br><br> she pulls kiyoshi's hair as she kisses him <br> kisses him after she pisses on him <br> psychotic </br></br></br></br>  I don't understand this anime at all. First it claims to have an internal logic. The anime clearly establishes that servants are much more powerful than any human. Why does Shirou then defeat Archer, who clearly is the most op servant? He never had any significant training. Back in middle ages they trained knights from small children. Compared to even normal knights Shirou is a fucking nobody. And what is this this bullshit about his body being made swords? So is he a human born out of a woman or is he some just some sort of deus machina? This anime is like first explaining the rules of chess and then Shirou just flips over the chess board and says he won.  <br>That was when Shirou was significantly weaker.</br>  <br>He was already disappearing before he fought Shirou<br><br>He noted he was at one tenth of his power by that point, and would fade if he lost focus at all.</br></br></br>  <br>You're implying he doesn't have armor in his treasury of every treasure and weapon ever?<br><br>He also makes gold bars out of thin air, surely he could buy the best armor in the world even if the mud ate every suit of armor in his armory.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, that's a shame but yeah Chibichuki seems to be getting little to no attention at all which is kind of ironic considering it's crossovers galore and in a super cute art style.</br>  <br>Its the Carnival Phantasm, One Day, or Take Moon of its age.<br><br>These things are almost never appreciated in their own time. Then someone eventually translates it on an absolute whim, and people suddenly why no one was working on this before and why it wasn't a discussion all this time since its pretty good.<br><br>In order for something to receive attention, it needs that initial investment out of nowhere by someone who just feels like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_3#Part_7</wbr></wbr>  <br>What delusions</br>  <br> implying Dengeki Bunko/Miki will allow this to happen. </br>  <br> She had felt he would truly leave for some place she would never be able to reach. <br><br> So she did not care how pathetic it was. She did not care if everyone treated her like a weed or stone on the side of the road, if her pride as Tokiwadai Middle School’s Ace was torn to shreds, or if Academy City’s #3 was entirely useless in the face of a “true conflict”. <br><br> Magic? Magic God? <br><br> She did not understand the words everyone else was using. She could not share in their meaning, she could not imagine what they were talking about, and she could not keep up. That fact was a powerful blow. <br><br> But she could put all of that off until later. <br><br> She could go through it all bit by bit based on what she did understand. <br>This volume is really opening up plot for Mikoto to become stronger in the future. What else is there besides Mikoto getting her awakened wings? Perhaps being Aleister's favorite toy will amount to something.<br><br> Niang-Niang <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128328212#p128330859">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your projections of your desires of course.</br>  <br>It's already happened unless the spoilers are wrong</br>  If you like incest anime you are degenerate.    <br>Do it, faggot.
