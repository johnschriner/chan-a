I'm gonna miss this show though.</br>  <br>I watched it until the slow pace killed me, it was just too much not even the cuteness could save it</br>  bitch ass motherfuckers click this shit more<br>http://nyanpass.com</br>  <br>I still don't know what it was even about.</br>  <br><br>You guys sure love SoL anime!</br></br>  <br>I actually do it's the genre I love the most, this one however was really weird, like they would take a pause in between a sentence and another and it was really triggering. I watched about half of it and then I figured the rest is gonna be like that as well so why bother</br>  Give me all your swets, you virgin scum!  <br>good show<br>8/10</br></br>  <br>I'm glad you like it, anon.</br>  <br>same, best show so far, gotta check the manga later</br>    No one talks about this show. Is it good?  <br><br><br><br><br><br>this was fukin MEEEEEEEEEEH,<br> Manga is better <br><br>Also, learn to check the catalogue, there is already a thread: </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, learn to check the catalogue, there is already a thread <br><br>I hate generals.

It gets better later. Not that I dislike the anime art.</br>  <br>Unless they do the principal's face right I refuse to watch it.</br>  <br><br>This shit is already out?</br></br>  <br>Yes<br><br>It's happening.</br></br></br>    So why doesn't Akari just clone three Asahis?  BEST GIRL WHEN  <br>Cause cool kids drink Kirin.</br>  <br>She's into NTR.</br>  <br>They got the reaction faces right, and at the end of the day, that's the best part of jitsu wa.</br>  <br> That shitty voice in the animu <br><br>RUINED</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Hestia?</br>  <br>I imagined alium with a stronger voice.</br>  <br>All of their voices are really light to me. But it was the first episode, so I'll give them time to work themselves into the role.</br>  <br>Well, it's much stronger than how the Seiyuu normally sounds anyway. I don't know how much further she can go.</br>  I was more worried for this than anything else this season. I actually don't mind the art anywhere nearly as much as I thought I would. Also Shiragami is illegally cute. <br><br>I am among the anons that have been participating in jitsu wa threads since forever. I despaired at seeing the concept art with you guys a while back, but I don't think you other guys will mind it much either.<br><br>Expressions are pretty good so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They greatly improved the artstyle since the original picture.</br>  <br>At least it wasn't her El Dorito voice</br>  <br>I kinda feel if she's to...cute. Cute in the moe since. We need more of her goofy expressions, which makes her how cute she really is</br>  <br>Hope to see that in the next episodes</br>  <br>M-maybe it'll be like the Katteni Kaizou adaptation and the art style will evolve every episode, mirroring how the art style in the source material changes.</br>  <br>Yes, this.<br><br>I don't blame them for not having it this episode, because this was before the artstyle change.<br><br>But goofy is what this series needs the most of.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who ED here?  <br>i liked it</br>  <br><br>Speaking of voices, I can't help but imagine Asahi talking about eggs.<br><br> I SAY CRYYYYY </br></br></br></br>  <br>Not bad, not bad at all.</br>  <br> Speaking of voices <br>Remember when the guy was singing the OP and Shirgami was mouthing the words? That was gross.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't look at the lower-right panel without laughing help</br></br>  <br>It was ok, but I would have preferred a female vocalist. Same goes for the OP.</br>  <br>I felt she was somewhat too cute too.<br><br>I think they took her being as cute as she is in the current mango and then moved it back so she would be that cute from the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br>Karen the cutest</br>  Some parts of the current OP animation are pretty dull, hopefully they'll be altered as secrets are uncovered.  <br>It's alright, but it really does not fit.</br>  <br>She's not Marina Inoue.<br><br>Seriously though, that's who I always imagined Alium to sound like.</br></br></br>  <br>OP &gt; ED<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/kgebiuhlrr.mp3<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>   Dumon ;-;   <br>They'll do the doteyes right, at least.</br>  are vampire girls fertile?<br><br>can i cum inside them without any fear?</br></br>  <br>That's what I like about it. More anime need random R&amp;B EDs.</br>  I'm not entirely sure why people rag on this show so much. True, the art isn't as good and it doesn't seem to have the pace of the manga, but I feel like everyone is forgetting that it takes about 5 chapters (until the introductions are done) for it to get the pace and the tone the manga generally has. I willing to wait and see if the anime ever lets itself go crazy.  <br>If her pure-blooded vampire dad was fertile then so is she.</br>  <br>It's not like the manga art didn't suck at first.<br><br>Maybe it will get better or grow on us like the manga did.</br></br></br>  <br>i liked it, it's not the best, but its definitely refreshing, glad they tried something different this time.</br>    <br>Why do the skirts in the anime look so shit compared to the ones in the manga?</br>  <br>Reminder:<br><br>Jitsu threads before <br> mangafags <br> love shit happening <br> dumpire winning  <br> everyone was happy <br><br>Jitsu threads after the announcement and designs<br> Fucking garbage <br> terrible designs not equal to the manga <br> blasphemy! <br><br>Jitsu threads after the first episode<br> animeonlyfags trying to fit <br> people defending the actual adaptation with no arguments <br> Mangafags leaving these threads until this shit ends <br><br>/a/ confirmed for worst board. <br><br>Also the adaptation is terrible, and everyone who likes this is a fucking retarded ANIMEONLYFAG.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The art is technically good, though. Which is the real issue people are having with it, it doesn't match up to the manga's (current) overly stylized look. J.C. Staff did a really good job adapting a similarly stylized style while making it more suited for animation just a couple of seasons ago.</br>  This chapter was fun.<br>I kinda avoided the manga because the art looked terrible tbh but the anime looks good. Does the art improve in the manga? Or is still the same?</br>  <br>Maybe you just need to learn to enjoy things and not be so bitter. I for one love the new anime art style, it's miles above the manga and actually makes dumbpire look and sound cute.</br>  <br>You've posted this like three times today. Fuck off with your copy pasta.</br>  <br>More detail</br>  <br>You're just instigating shit by posting this.</br>  <br>(Not that I necessarily dislike how the anime looks standalone, but it is quite a difference from the manga art. Another example would be Level E; though I feel the anime designs are a significant improvement over the manga art, I'm sure there are people who prefer Togashi's originals.)</br>  <br> Enjoy bad designs <br> Enjoy awful VA <br> Enjoy QUALITY <br> Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br><br>Are you really trying?<br><br><br>Stay mad animeonlyfag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Try reading this chapter http://bato.to/read/_/263183/jitsu-<wbr>wa-watashi-wa_v4_ch28_by_underdog-s<wbr>cans</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> implying you're not an animeonlyfag falseflagging to make the mangaonlyfags look bad </br>  <br><br>Please, stop.</br></br>  <br> Enjoy bad designs <br>See my post. I disagree. The new designs look cute actually enjoyable.<br> Enjoy awful VA <br>Again, I disagree. Dumbpire and MC's voice were pretty good and fitted the characters well.<br> Enjoy QUALITY <br>Haven't seen any yet, nor does it matter. After reading the disaster that is HxH for years, I'm used to shit art.<br> Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br> Implying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Enjoy how a good manga is ruined <br><br>I don't get this<br><br>How the fuck can a bad anime ruin a good manga?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was sort of surprised by the girl's VAs. I sort of expected Mikan's and Shiragami's voices to be lower. We'll see if it ends up screwing to much with the work.</br>  <br><br>It is going to be awful when animefags try to start Dumpire v. Alium. Our broship is not meant to falter.<br><br>Besides<br>Pic related</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here you go. Chapter 1 of the manga was pretty awful, at least compared to everything that came after it. And  is absolutely right, chapter 28 is the best chapter to read if you're trying to decide whether or not to pick up the manga.</br>  <br>Anime is generally a way to revitalize a flagging manga. If the anime is good, it boosts sales of the tanks, which tells the magazines the manga is worth a damn. A bad anime can turn off people on the fence about starting a new manga, and can attach a stink to the name (think Kampfer).</br>   alium is being voiced by the same seiyuu as pic related <br>It just seems so weird.</br>  Fat chance in hell but I'm hopingthat the change the artstyle like the manga happens. <br>But already the VA's are dog-shit. And this thing breaks of low budget. The art is generic as it gets. Part of the attraction for the manga is the art. Everyone has this shit-eating stupid look on their face by default.</br>  <br>Man look at this kid trying to fit in with the Mangafags</br>   no chance in hell we'll get the school trip animated and see Dumpire having fun and being uncomfortable in moving water at the same time <br>Uwow~</br>  MC has THE most punchable face I have ever seen in anime.  <br>  Mikan's <br>How much lower do you want it? I don't think the VA could have gone much lower when she got pissed at the boys.</br></br>  <br>Karen chapter soon.</br>  <br>Well Mikan is pic related.</br>  <br>She went low went talking to the boys, but i meant her general talking voice seemed high (i was expecting altos from most of the cast, but most seem sopranos).</br>  <br>Did she even get any lines outside of that scene?</br>  <br>Would you happen to know how soon?</br>  <br>You can find out for yourself on senmanga.</br>  <br>I don't think she did, but her first lines were in a seemingly normal voice, I believe.</br>  Just so we are on the same page, the manga will still have it's own threads devoid of anime faggotry right?<br><br>It's too far and animeonlyfags will get spoiled, and nobody reading the manga would attempt at discussing the anime over there, right?<br><br>Can we agree on this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It will happen all the damn time. Just look how pissed fatefags get when they try to discuss the vn and not the UBW adaptation.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>The manga didn't get good until the girls were somewhat established and all the characters started interacting with each other.</br>  I still have my hopes up for this anime.  <br>Are they trying to save up on ink by drawing really tiny noses? The best thing in this manga is the noses </br>  <br>I thought the best things were the giant crazy eyes and cheeky toothy smiles</br>  This art is terrible. What new studio is doing this shit ?  <br><br>The only thing you have up is your dick anon.</br></br>  Quiet animeonlyfag here. I wanted to ask why that girl has a screw on her head but you people are too scary, I guess I'd better ignore the threads unless something stitch-wrothy happen.<br>And don't worry about that animeonlyfag status, if I enjoy the show enough until the season ends I'll pick the manga up. <br>Now be nice to each other.</br></br>  <br>I imagined something along Rukias voice from Bleach</br>  <br>Just like Youko is a vampire, Aizawa is a frankenstein.</br>  <br>She has a monster secret. You'll find out in a week or two.</br>  Why was the animation of her bobbing up and down here so awkward?<br><br><br>Read the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait never mind being catty about it, they showed her in the cockpit right at the end of the first episode.<br> AIZAWA NAGISA = AYY LMAO </br></br>  <br>Are you saying you came in here and asked a question before finishing the episode?</br>  <br>I cannot get over Alien's design. There is something blatantly wrong with it.</br>  <br>No on both accounts. I'm not the asker, and I'd forgotten about that stinger until I was in the middle of posting something unhelpful.</br>  <br>It's the eyes.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/iwggfofooj.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Jitsu Wa: Speed Force version.</br>  <br><br>Funny, I gave it the same rating. It's not as bad as I thought it would be, and while it does have some quality issues(And we were all expecting that), it hit all the right notes and most importantly, kept the Kansai-ben.<br><br>Chapter 85 is going to be a little late because everyone was gone at Anime Expo. As soon as it's proofed and the last page is redrawn I'll typeset it and send it out. Sorry for the delay.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I... I'm OKAY</br></br>  Shiragami seemed a lot bustier in the manga  <br>So, can we just have a show about the these three dudes? Seriously, they're more entertaining than the main characters.</br>  So, will the anime get to the point where Mikan stops being a terrible person?  It was so sweet and moe it gave me diabetese.  <br>Pretty much the only part of this manga that isn't complete trash</br>  <br>Insufficient levels of :&lt;</br>  <br>What other shit shows have you watched in order for this to be the best one, it was a horrible first episode. Just setting it up to be harem shit with romance that goes no where.<br><br>Want to talk about a romance with a good first episode look at Akagami.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Out of the whole cast Mikan and Sakura sound the worst.</br></br>  I liked the episode<br><br>Then I heard it was going to be a harem. Fucking hell Japan stop ruining everything, not everything needs multiple girls on one dick.</br></br>  <br>But only around three girls are actively hunting the MC's dick (until Durriken comes in). All the rest either will take any dick, are related to him, are actually men, or have horns.</br>  <br><br>Wait, was Teekyuu out already?</br></br>  I like that the male lead is very straightforward and makes solid, well-reasoned decisions all the time only to have the female lead be a dense moron. Interesting reversal on the classic formula.  <br>I also like how he kept making good decisions and they kept having even better outcomes, like how he accidentally used the word "friend" and that made her fall in love with him when using "couple" wouldn't've because of her constant insecurity about not having friends specifically.</br>  This is just like a sign of things to come for OPM. Threads aren't typically that huge for the manga, but the roaring sea of anime only cancer new friends is going to be horrific.  Holy shit. It's like they just made everything as moe as possible.<br><br>Also when the fuck are we ever going to catch up in terms of translations?</br></br>  <br><br>Never. Like I have said before, we're not going to catch up. Tank raws are much easier to work with than magazine raws. If we run out of tank chapters(Which we won't if we keep a chapter a week), we will stop scanlation until the next one comes out. We will never catch up.</br></br>   all these fucking series I was supposed to watch this season <br> nope, they're all shit <br><br>Gakkou Gurashi damn better deliver so I can watch something.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a week tomorrow. Will I see a new chapter?</br>  <br/>  <br>Welp. I couldn't go to Anime Expo and I can't read Jitsu. Might as well kill myself.<br><br>Thanks for the redirect.</br></br></br>  <br>TMS, there aren't new</br>  <br>Don't worry tripfag, everything will be daijobu.</br>  <br> horns <br> sweater <br> necktie <br> loves sweets <br><br>Best girl spotted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  they knocked it out of the park with Shiragami, she's cute as fuck, however I'm not a fan of Alien's VA. Her voice sounds nothing like what I'd pictured beforehand. Sensei and mikan are good too.  <br>The  Old woman[/spolier] is even more kawaii than in the manga </br>  <br>Didn't even watch the anime and i see this green hair shit <br>Im disgusted ruined her</br></br>  <br> /a/ confirmed for worst board <br> go to /v/ <br> literally just Reddit spilled all over <br> people using emoticons and acronyms unironically <br> unironic shitposting constantly <br> 8/10 threads nothing to do with video games, thread talking about pewdiepie and markiplier <br> very obviously an open underage scourge community attached to the board <br><br>And that's without even bringing up /b/ and /x/.

I guess this is confirmation  Nothing on Kizu?  <br>Where is this from?</br>  AOTY confirmed.<br><br>SHAFT is going to save this shit year.</br></br>  <br>A wallpaper I made to trick you guys.</br>  <br>Hi sense</br>  <br><br><br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/656<wbr>81</wbr></br></br></br>  So what about Koyomimonogatari? Koyomi Dead is important, though maybe they'll just stick that into Owari somewhere.  Guess this is the confirmation of the infos we got last week.  <br>They can adapt it into an OVA or something later.</br>   announced right after the BD box for nise and neko black comes out <br><br>Props to whoever been calling it in the last few months.</br></br>  <br> That chinese ad on the background + that chinese tv brand <br>This looks legit</br></br>  So this will be a full season and not another 5 episode special, right?  <br>Owari is 3 novels. Shaft ain't fitting that in 5 episodes.</br>  <br> Kizumonogatari <br> Never <br>Chose both.</br></br></br>  <br>3 novels in 12 episodes maybe.</br>  <br>There's probably a mini PV in the box? I remember Neko Black's BDs came with PVs for Second Season.</br>  <br>That would still be horrible, but they could do it. I'm hoping for 15 episodes or more.</br>  <br><br>Will come out in 201X</br></br>  <br>that would suck so much ass</br>  <br>Do I need to watch Owari no Seraph to understand this?</br>  <br>Koyomi can come out any time before Owari Vol. 3 is adapted. Or if SHAFT want to be bitches they can tack Koyomi Dead onto the beginning of Mayoi Hell.</br>  <br>I doubt it<br>Probably 2 cour or 1 cour and a half</br></br>  <br><br>They'll make as many episodes as they need, -gatari prints money. There's no risk of overspending on it.</br></br>  <br>I hope they somehow include the last two Koyomi short stories in Owari. It would be perfect.</br>   there will be a time when Monogatari will be finished <br> it'll be   somewhat  soon<br>pls no</br></br>  <br>SHAFT will never make another 2-cour show after SS.</br>  <br><br>Yes, but Boku no Pico is the prequel to Owari no Seraph, so you should pick that up before that</br></br>  <br>all good things must come to an end, anon.</br>   tfw you never participate in non-waifu wars Monogatari threads because some new piece of information is spoiled every single time you do <br>feels bad man</br>  <br>They could go for a split cour.<br><br><br>It's almost like good discussion requires the use of all available knowledge.</br></br></br></br>  I hope the series finale is Arararararagi actually beating the piss out of someone and not him talk no jutsu'ing every enemy again   Monogatari will soon be over <br><br>It'll be interesting to see what SHAFT does after it's finished.</br></br>  Thank god it's finally fucking over.<br><br>Now Shaft can work on a new IP</br></br>  <br>Probably adapt Tsugi.</br>  <br><br> Here's hoping for more Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei </br></br>  <br>Maria Holic S3</br>  <br>Didn't nisio just announced more monogatari novels? I don't think Shaft will ever stop making them since their other shit barely sells</br>  <br>That actually happens in Kizu</br>  <br>Not until they finish Kizu.</br>  <br>Unlikely. The last few volumes of the manga did not do well in Japan.</br>  <br>Hope you like Nisio since SHAFT is more than likely doing Okitegami Kyouko next.</br>  <br><br>Since when has that mattered for SHAFT ever? People tend to forget since they had Monogatari and Madoka, but SHAFT makes whatever the fuck they want. Madoka and Monogatari just happened to be popular.</br></br>  <br>It wasn't that fun anyway. I want more SoreMachi and that's about it, aside Bake and Machi I didn't like any of their shows.</br>  <br><br>Not only there are still 6 unadapted novels, there are still more to come, at least one more</br></br>  <br>w-what about kizu</br>  <br> new IP <br>There's unfinished business, Anon</br></br>  <br> not wanting the SZS ending adapted </br>  Who will be Sodachi's seiyuu?<br><br>My guess's on Y.Aoi</br></br>  <br>who</br>  <br> not 2xxx </br>  <br>Sprinkling diamonds on shit just makes your shit sparkle.</br>  <br>Thank you shaft for skipping more novels<br><br>At least we'll see Araragi getting hit by Ougi</br></br></br>  <br>Will never happen until this man comes out of hiding.</br>  <br>They're only skipping koyomi right? or am I missing something?</br>  Has anyone read the Okitegami novel.  <br>And that's exactly what the image shows.

Would anyone care to give me an update? Last I heard she was the one responsible for giving araragi his if "you make friends you lose" mentality.</br>  Reminder that Shaft can't decide if they take on more monogatari or not it's up to Aniplex to contract them to.   run out of time to introduce three witches in the show <br> three movies <br> still don't show them <br>Are you guys ready for more Madoka after this?</br></br></br>  <br>She hates Araragi because he didn't helped her<br>Meet him in middle school, teach him about math just so he could go to her home and see her family problems, so he could report that to his parents <br>He didn't do shit<br> her mom is ded </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes and Aniplex doesn't like money so they're going to can Monogatari.</br>  <br>middle school araragi is a dick<br>and I was wondering when his parents being police officers would become plot relevant.</br></br>  <br>he also grabbed her boobs the absolute madman</br>   crab getting in a catfight <br> spaghetti-filled date with crab <br> fighting the first servant <br> not-romance between araragi and shinobu <br> kanbaru getting pissed at araragi NTRing another person <br> gaen being a smug fuck <br> mayoi back <br> meme back <br> ougi btfo by kurayami </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kizu<br>Fucking<br>When</br></br>  <br> kanbaru getting pissed at araragi NTRing another person <br>you wot</br></br>  <br>Never. According to a source of mine who is close friends with an anime industry insider who knows someone inside SHAFT familiar with the situation said that Kizu has been scrapped because using resources to animate a story where everyone already knows the outcome is just not worth it for them.</br>  they could just make kizu an ova ala Tsuki/Hana and be done with it  Thank God, I'm so sick of shaftfags pretending this mediocrity is good because they animate less and sometimes put their name into a frame.  <br>they should hurry and adapt the rest of the series because sales are falling</br>  No surprise but I want to know if it's going to be one or two cours and whether or not Zokuowari is going to be in it.  <br>They'll probably adapt them all before that number reaches 10k so there's no need to worry</br>  <br>That's a common thing in anime though. Any long running series will constantly lose sale numbers as time goes on. One of the main reasons SayonaraZetsubouSensei ended was that the sale numbers for Zan showed that the series was gonna stop being profitable if they kept going on</br>  <br>What the fuck is this faggot talking about.</br>  <br>They can always adapt another Nisio LN</br>  <br>That's never going to happen</br>  <br> SHAFT makes whatever the fuck they want. <br>You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.</br></br>  <br>http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/656<wbr>90</wbr></br>  <br>Turns out having Shinobu by his side was NTRing an ancient vampire.</br>  <br> Final Season <br>Damn, considering how much they have left to adapt even after that I thought they'd keep the gravy train rolling. I was really hoping that we could get a full 100 episodes.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they're doing now. They've really sped up the adaptation rate of this to a pretty much bi-seasonal rate now.</br></br>  <br>No, they will spend all their money animating 7 seasons and 3 movies for Koufuku Graffiti!</br>  <br><br>Aniplex doesn't actually control the Monogatari franchise, they just exploit it. It's owned by Kodansha.</br></br>  <br>there would be a movie or something, shaft likes money</br>  <br>30k is still good business for them. I can't imagine they spend a crazy amount making monogataris either, the series has been declining in quality since Nise.</br>  <br>And Kodansha is going to piss off a profitable business partner by pulling the plug on Monogatari for no reason.</br>  Literally who gives a fuck? Adapt Kizu you monsters holy shit.  <br> The best SHAFT works are always the ones that sell like shit. <br><br>Bake and Madoshit aren't even that interesting why did they have to be such hits? I want more SoreMachi, Graffiti, Pani Poni and Denpa Onna</br></br></br>  <br> 30k is still good business for them <br>30k is good business for everyone. I wish Kaiji had managed that amount of sales</br></br>  <br>isn't the one guy that's animating it busy</br>  <br><br>Aren't most of those just short stories?</br></br>  <br>Good business for Aniplex, I doubt SHAFT sees a single yen of the revenue. They get paid to adapt it and that's it.</br>  <br>The common excuse is that they spent all the effort during Second Season on Madoka Rebellion, and it seems to hold at least some water since the Hana and Tsuki OVAs were pretty high in quality.</br>  <br><br>If people still care about it after it's obviously been extended well beyond where it was meant to go than what does that say about the fanbase really.</br></br>  <br>I DON'T KNOW THE SEASON OR WHAT IS THE REASON, I'M STANDING HERE HOLDING MY BLADE</br>  <br>There's also the change in director</br>  <br> extended well beyond where it was meant to go </br>  <br> Final <br>I thought we had a while to go?<br><br><br>You have the worst taste of all time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We do. There's also the Next Season.</br>  <br>and koyomi. and  Kizu </br>  <br>Oh, wait, that's just the title? Nevermind.</br>  <br>I haven't watched Tsuki yet but I thought Hana looked very average. Chock full of crappy CGI and boring environments.</br>  <br>The Final Season already started with Tsuki</br>  <br>It may not have dawned on him that he should report anything. I never had any red flags about my friends "Adopted grandpa" until he decided that I was his next toy.</br>  Happy birthday Hitagi.  <br>I don't know, when I was a middle schooler, I probably'd never have recognized or thought to tell my parents about abuse.  Unless it had been a Scoutmaster, because the Boy Scouts were so paranoid that we had safety lectures on sexual abuse every few months. </br>  <br> like those SYD animators <br><br>Explain the syd thing</br></br></br>  <br>Has been confirmed.<br>I can't wait for this.</br></br>  <br>Everything besides Koyomi and Kizu, but even so all those short stories added up could make a few OVAs/bonus material</br>  <br>The crappy CGI was mostly used for the basketballs. It was a turn-off but it was no Koimonogatari snake pit. Most of the environments were great except for the empty field and the basketball court, although we admittedly spent a lot of time in those two. Kanbaru's room, Kanbaru's dream world, the desert scenery during Numachi's first monologue, Numachi's flashback, Kanbaru's bath, the scenery for the running and driving scenes, and the final basketball court filled with water were all very good.</br>  <br>happy birthday</br>  <br>it's not the 7th yet</br>  <br>It is where she lives faggot.</br>  <br> What are time zones? <br>Sasuga Americans</br></br>  cant wait for this btfo love live   Final <br>There's still a lot of volumes to cover, it better be a long season. Or a deceptive title.</br>  <br>that's the name of the season retard, Final season started since Tsuki</br>  <br>can I have sauce for this cute animu girl?</br>  <br>Final Season as in the Final Season of the books<br>First Season: Bake, Kizu, Nise, Neko:K<br>Second Season: Neko:S, Kabuki, Hana, Otori, Oni, Koi<br>Final Season: Tsuki, Koyomi, Owari, ZokuOwari<br>??? Season: Tsugi</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think that's going to realistically happen in any possible area where they could go head to head except maybe who has more rabid fans stateside and even then I'm still not convinced as Love Live is slowly catching on here.</br></br>  <br>Tsugi had better be about the exorcists.</br>  <br>Don't forget Ore monogatari</br>  I've never thought about this before, but what is the point of the monogatari series? What is the overarching story Nisio is trying to tell? Is it just your standard Bildungsroman or is it a bit more than that?  <br> what are diminishing returns </br>  <br> the point of <br>For us to watch/read it and be entertained.</br></br>  <br>well actually with this new anime it's only Kizu, Koyomi, and ZokuOwari. And then whatever shit Nisio is writing next but that doesn't count yet.</br>  <br>Aniplex isn't that greedy. If they were, SHAFT would've pulled a KyoAni on their ass.</br>  <br>There's no point. That's the deceptive truth of the Monogatari series. There is hardly any plot, and the whole show is driven by two things. <br><br>1. Interesting Characters<br><br>2. SHAFT's ingenious animating style/Shinbou's eye for direction in a series like Monogatari<br><br>It's basically because of 2. why Monogatari is the hit it is. If some other studio adapted it normally I doubt it would've become the phenomenon that it was. SHAFT's style is the ONLY style that's 100% compatible with Monogatari.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can we just skip summer and go to fall already? This season is shit.  <br> &gt;not-romance between araragi and shinobu </br>  Will we finally get more Madoka?  <br> There is hardly any plot </br>  <br>Yeah. Shinobu only turns down everything she ever wanted as Kiss-Shot in order to stay with Araragi. Totally platonic.</br>  <br>so platonic it hurts</br>  <br>Well, to be fair, she's probably going to actively refuse any sort of romantic advances, even without any other girls in the picture, for a few years because she's got five centuries of isolation and crippling loneliness in the back of her head to remind her what can happen if they fuck their relationship up.</br>  <br>They use bake to make money for madoka, then they use nise to make more money its just a back and forth. The circle jerk of shaft.</br>  <br>They have to. They've developed the monetary version of Perpetual Motion. <br><br>Use Monogatari to fund Madoka, skim what you need off the top then make more Monogatari, use that to make more Madoka ad infinitum.</br></br></br>  <br>Kizu fucking when</br>  I only care about Bird.  <br>Don't stop beleiving</br>  <br>HOLD ON TO THAT FEELING!</br>  <br>Streetlights, people<br>Living just to find emotion<br>Hiding somewhere in the night</br></br></br>  <br>well the LN is being released in english soon at least</br>  <br>It's already available, but hopefully Vertical's translation isn't shit.</br>  <br> Everything she ever wanted as Kiss-Shot <br>Although the only thing she wanted was to die.</br></br>   "final" season <br> he's already shilling new novels on twitter and has been for months  <br>Suck my dick Nisio.</br></br>  <br>Or all of her power and beauty along with her first servant acting as good company rather than killing himself.</br>  <br>Why are you assuming that it's Araragi's story that is continuing in these new novels. <br><br>I mean your point is still valid, it is shilling new novels to take advantage of the mad cash he's making but Final Season could apply to just Araragi's story. <br><br>We might get a new POV character either from our current cast of characters or a new set.</br></br></br></br></br>  Sasami-san season 2 when?  <br>Hopefully <br><br><br>It's true, she had all that stuff, but all she wanted was to die. Did you read Kizu?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Next season will be worse if Funi picks up everything</br>  <br>That anon is right. It had better be about those damned Exorcists. <br>Add in Tooe, if you do that, we get to see Kaiki during his teenage years.</br></br>  <br> Teenage Kaiki <br>It's possible that back then he was similar to Araragi, that'd be pretty interesting.</br></br>  <br><br>so long as shaft can still lewd, does it matter?</br></br>  <br>He probably was to be honest. At the very least, he'd be one part Senjou snark, one part Araragi helping. <br><br><br>Yes, it does. <br><br>Why would you willingly want to watch Monogatari go to shit so NisiO can get paid?<br><br>Don't drag on something after it's run it's course.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> shaft can still lewd <br>And yet it's not lewd enough for me to fap to it. fuck that shit.</br></br>  <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br>  <br>You need to lay off the hentai for a while. Wait a week and then come tell us about how you can't fap to it. <br><br>You are a disappointment, anon. You disgrace the standards and practices of men everywhere. <br><br>Through dick, unity. Never forget that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very nice. Does ougi continues to be a cunt?</br>  <br>I'm like him, I can't fap to something if it's not entirely porn. I just find sexual fan service boring, but if the lolis show up I'm simply more interested. I do fap to the lolis, but separate.</br>  <br>Ougi is  very helpful, actually </br>  <br> if the lolis show up I'm simply more interested <br>what is wrong with you</br></br>  <br>Damn, so many people numbing themselves these days. <br><br>Back in my day I had to walk 500 miles through snow to find a half-torn page of a 1920' porno mag and I WOULD walk 500 more just to get that other half. <br><br>But yeah, I don't doubt that there are people who can't fap to just generic fanservice. It's the internet, you can do better. You don't need to mislabel your VHS anymore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, just mentioning that fan service does appeal to me, just not sexually. I watch it for the character interactions first, but the plot and all the rest aren't far behind.</br>   anime monogatari will end in two years <br>Damn.</br>  <br>If only.</br>  which book has hitagi's birthday in it?  <br> October  <br><br>I expected some new year's special again. Good.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh no, he was a conman and always will be, thats why normal people dont steal from children, hence why they are conmen.<br><br><br>see other lines, someone who steals from children would be the same in their youth, and im talking about when he was a child.<br>Too bad nobody strangled him as a child, I would happely do that to clowns like him. (and yes he litterly looks like a clown, hair and makeup) im glad he died from blood loss and cardiac arrest. real life logic beats nisio's terrible writing everytime even if there was a different chronology.</br></br></br></br></br>  Korean scans.<br><br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>461441</wbr></br></br>  <br>That's definately Japan. Their nation is a tiny island in the east. Look at the master's outfit. It screams Japan. Not to mention the sword. I didn't expect him to be this young though but I'm glad he is not an old man.</br>  <br>He looks like he is in his mid/early 20s.</br>  <br>Is he pondering about the water splash he made?</br>  Also Koumei freaking the fuck out is just amazing. I like how he predicted that it was the Nips who were Hakuryuu's mystetious allies but the moment he heard about Sassan attacking him, dude his lost his shit.  Nanaumi a qt!  <br>Yeah, Im not expecting him to be older than 27.<br><br><br>That was a cool entrance, that's for sure. And yes, I wonder if his djinn is a water element.<br><br><br>It's one thing to have a tiny nation attacking you but when you have to go against soldiers like the ones from Sasan who are experienced in battles and are around 10k, not to mention SSA, everyone would lose their shit.<br><br>Man this is going to work so nice for Sinbad, I swear.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nippon STRONK!</br>  <br>His name is Yamato Takehiko and he is king of Oniyakko Kingdom.</br>  I finally decided to get back into this series after dropping it in the middle of the endless flashback arc.<br><br>Catching up again I can say it's really getting better. I like how things are really picking up, there's really no way out for Hakuryuu at this point. Adding to that they gave a real sense of danger to the fights and consequence for people's decisions.<br><br>My chief concern at this point however is  Kougyoku's safety.   It's amazing to see her as the center of attention but she's also in the most danger alonside Kouha </br></br></br></br>  Has there EVER been a proper live action adaption of an anime?  <br> Z Edition <br>What the hell does that even mean? Did they drag out some scenes to make it last 5 times longer?</br></br>  I liked the first 2 death note movies  <br>Nah, Goro is just a legit movie star now.</br>  <br>Initial D</br>  <br>If Phoenix Wright counts as anime, then its movie is stupid fun.</br>   You live your entire life as a criminal in a desert.  <br> The only companionship you have a talking cat.  <br> One day, desperate for something of worth in your dirt-ridden existence, you try to rob a teenage girl, a pig, and a small boy.  <br> The small boy kicks your teeth out after seeing a girl makes you bashful and embarrassed, and peeping a titty makes you pass out. <br> When confronted with the possibility of having any wish granted by a magical dragon, your wish would be "I don't want to drop spaghetti while looking at a lady" <br> You then spend days creeping on these folks, watching for a way to achieve this lofty goal, you are forced to hit a little girl (one of your few [only?] victories) and then hit on her. <br> Eventually you are captured and saved only when the little kid turns into a giant monkey. &gt;The pig does more than you to save the day. <br> But it's okay, right? You finally got a girlfriend. &gt;Well, kind of. You don't really see each other that often. <br> You decide to show the world your stuff and enter into the Tenkaichi Budokai, the greatest martial arts tournament of all time.  <br> You are immediately eliminated in the quarter finals by an old man nobody's heard of before. &gt;You embarrass and humiliate yourself by insisting that it's a different old man in disguise before being proven a fool. <br> The next time you hear from Goku, he's taking on terrorist Nazis or some crazy shit.  <br> So you gear up to raid the Hydra base and... you're not needed at all.  <br> You get a sinking feeling in your heart, like this won't be getting old soon. <br> You help Goku fight the fortune teller's fighters.  <br> An invisible man beats you up and you barely win when your girlfriend's boobs are gawked at by an old man. <br> You are then beaten up by a mummy. <br> But the Turtle Hermit, greatest living martial arts master, has taken you in.  <br><br>You'll do well in the next tournament!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Nope. The heel you challenged beats and destroys you in front of a crowd.  <br> You are helpless. Like a child.  <br> Your legs, broken.  <br> By the end of the tournament, the man who brutalized you is declared champion, but he decided to be "nice" now, so you have to pretend that it's okay and you're friends after he annihilated your pride for all to see. <br> A demon king attacks the world and you stay with the peanut gallery.  <br> The bad guy doesn't even bother to go after you despite specifically targeting martial artists. &gt;Jesus Christ. Speaking of God, Goku is training with God now.  <br> You feel so very small and weak. M-maybe the next tournament.... ?  <br> The next tournament sees you headbutted in the junk and defeated handily by a middle aged tourist.  <br> True, it's God in disguise, but still.  <br> Nobody knows that.  <br> Yamcha, the desert bandit.  <br> His tournament career ended by an old man.  <br><br>That's your public legacy.<br><br>(Also you have a scar for some reason, which is kind of pathetic considering that the children who underwent the same training didn't get maimed like you.)<br><br> Oh, and Goku gets married before you, and he doesn't even know what marriage is.  <br> Years pass and you become a baseball player.  <br> That one glorious period of fame and recognition is going to come to an end.  <br> You learn that Goku's dead and it's time for you and the others to take the lead.  <br> Time to train under God himself to protect the Earth from deadly alie- <br> nvm you died.  <br> Krillin destroys several saibamen with a single attack, while you lie lifeless in the dirt. good try though.  <br> Yajirobe and the five year old do more than you.  <br> For the next few months you sit on a planet while King Kai teaches you jack shit. <br> You come back to life!. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>shitting on my nigga Yamcha, get the fuck outta here.</br></br>   Your girlfriend breaks up with you and immediately starts flirting with the guy who got you killed less than a year ago.  <br> His power is so strong and big compared to yours, flaccid and tiny.  <br> You can only stand around and cry when Frieza comes to Earth, and are filled with joy when he's defeated by a mysterious stranger from the future who gives you a dire warning that... <br> you're going to fail in another timeline as well. <br> After three years of training your ex hooks up with the evil spaceman and they make a baby &gt;who you have to help change the diapers of whenever you swing by <br> You get punched through the chest by an old man without doing anything.  <br> You try to explain that they can steal your energy,  <br> but you could have done something before that.  <br> You just don't care anymore.  <br> You wait until Goku's nearly dead to explain the energy stealing bit,  <br> and then take him back home to babysit him as you openly acknowledge your uselessness. <br> Oh and the future stranger is Bulma and Vegeta's badass robot fighting son, and thus the whole fate of two worlds depended on Vegeta and Bulma's amazing sweaty unprotected lovemaking.  <br> Nothing has ever depended on you or ever will <br> Tien does more than you when he holds off the bugman.  <br> You just do nothing. Krillin gets a robot girlfriend who barely ages.  <br> You get nothing.  <br> A tournament comes around again and the gang is getting together for old time's sake. &gt;Even Krillin is going to enter.  <br> Good ol' Krillin.  <br> Always there for the team.  <br> Always in the fight even when he's outclassed. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   You stay in the stands with Krillin's daughter to babysit her.  <br> Your ex-girlfriend cheers on her husband and their son, who wins the junior division.  <br> You have no son.  <br> When they all fly off to fight Majin Buu nobody even thinks about inviting you to come and help <br> Nobody ever thinks about you.  <br> Nobody ever will. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>good night sweet prince</br>  <br>Yamcha is /a/</br>  <br>... fuck.<br>I'm Yamcha.<br>I think I'll kill myself now.</br></br></br>  In the manga, Future Trunks states that after Bulma and Yamcha broke up, Yamcha found a new girlfriend. Although she never appeared in any Dragon Ball media, Yamcha's new girlfriend is mentioned at the end of the Cell Games Saga, when Shenron asks for a wish and Yamcha jokingly proposes he wish for a necklace for the said girlfriend.  In an interview, Toriyama stated that the best cooks in the Dragon Ball universe are Ox-King and Yamcha.  This is wonderfully written. Thank you.<br><br>But I'll always love Yamcha. He kept living the dream, no matter what happened.</br></br>  <br>Yamcha's girlfriend is Poochie?</br>  <br>It makes sense, I suppose.</br>  <br> i should have never left the desert </br>  <br>But they were in a desert.</br>  <br>Someone tell me where Toriyama lives, he's had a hard kick in the dick coming to him for a very long time.</br>  <br>Maybe the konta desert?<br>All dat milslurp.</br></br>  fuck you yamcha is and always will be the main side nigga of the DB series  Is there anyone more useless than yamcha? <br><br> inb4 i am </br></br>  <br>You are.</br>  <br><br>#rekt</br></br>  <br><br><br>plz no bully</br></br></br>  <br>Hearing this story of Yamcha's life makes me feel his depression. Kind of reminds me of my own life.</br>  <br>I'm Yamcha too...</br>   Your girlfriend breaks up with you <br> your ex hooks up with the evil spaceman and they make a baby <br> MFW Im Yamcha </br></br>  I don't think I've ever had the experience of having my ex-girlfriend hook up with the space alien that blew me up.<br><br>Or having a girlfriend in general for that matter.</br></br>  why does toriyama hate yamcha so damn much  Could Yamcha even 1v1 Mr. Satan? I don't think he could.   morons still like Yamcha and they still defend him <br>What a surprise.</br>  Yamcha is pretty much the only still around so we can laugh at him  <br>What's wrong with that?</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>This is what I always wanted to know. Don't think they brought that up in any interview. At least the ones translated. Yamcha is not just a joke character in a gag manga fashion, you have plenty of those in DB and even some of these guys accomplish more than Yamcha. Toriyama turns him into a husk of a man. It would be better to just fade away and be sidelined like Chaozu. But Yamcha always came back for another quick death, jobbing against henchman and to top it all he lost the girl. <br><br>Toriyama even tries to retcon his never seen girlfriend in on one interview from those Dragon Ball guides saying Yamcha was still pretty shy around girls in the end. Despite he cheating on Bulma being the professed for their break up. But then again he doesn't really remember much about his works at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Do not forget about when Frieza came back in the Movie, he wasn't even invited while Roshi was there.</br>   Battle of Gods director's cut <br> Beerus challenges Oolong to a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors for the fate of the world <br> Yamcha explains to Oolong that Beerus thinks he's a pig, so he can only choose scissors <br> When in fact, Oolong is a pig-man with all five digits and can choose anything <br> Yamcha tells him to go with paper to beat Beerus' rock <br> Oolong does, but Beerus uses scissors instead because he could hear Yamcha explain <br><br>Also OP, you forgot Yamcha getting his arm broken by a Cell Jr.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  OC donut steal.  <br> His best friend is a cat that can transform into ANYTHING <br><br>Living the dream, I say. Puar can literally become any girl of his dream, and he doesn't even have to be awkward around it because it's his best friend.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't want to defile his best friend, will just have to use Oolong instead.</br>  <br><br>Is it still considered beastiality if puar became an adorable cat-girl?</br></br>  <br>Considering Yamcha can both fly and use ki attacks, while Mr. Satan can't...<br><br>Yeah I'm in agreement. I'm sure Yamcha would fuck it up somehow.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is puar a girl or a guy? If it's a girl then it's a-ok isn;t it?<br><br>Puar can, if I remember correctly, transform indefinitely, technically s/he could transform into the hottest woman ever and just stay like that./</br></br></br></br>    <br> Is puar a girl or a guy? <br><br>Does it even really matter anon?</br></br></br>  <br> what is chiaotzu </br>       Wait there, Yamcha. I'll let you know when I'm finished with her.   This one always makes me kek.  <br>Pretty good but you forgot to mention this. Start at 4:07 and pay attention to Yamcha.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fxA<wbr>4KnpGnMA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> 4:07 <br>4:00</br></br>  <br> there is actually a yamcha pose tag for extreme failures <br><br>goddamit yamcha</br></br></br>    Going to dump this set.

I'm not even British and I can see that from a mile away.

I don't know what kind of workout she'd need for that.

Got kind of funny looks using a 5 pound dumbbell, until people realized I was doing sets of 100 at fairly high speed. Mine was weird old chinese stuff though, not karate.</br>  So what will it be like when Tomo finally wins the Jun bowl?    <br>The manga will end.</br>  <br>One chapter dedicated to him confessing to her on their way home form school.<br>The next chapter dedicated to her staring at him, the blush getting more intense as she catches on to what he said.<br>The last chapter will be her saying she loves him too and they walk home together not hand in hand though because that's too embarrassing right now.<br>It will be beautiful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A no holds barred fist fight will turn into shagging somehow</br>  <br>High impact sexual violence.</br>  <br>10/10 would read over and over again</br>  <br> is that how they do it in Britain? <br>Inch'allah m8</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Implying he hasn't already cracked and glued the pieces back together again several times over by now. <br>The man is seriously desperate to preserve their current state of affairs.</br></br>  So...Tomo, Misuzu or British? and why?  Misuzu &gt; Tomo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit &gt;&gt;&gt; The British slag  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  <br>BAKA!</br>  <br>There will be no confession, they will merely be at home, fighting each other and throwing punches until they suddenly rip off each other's clothes and engage in furious angersex before they even realize what they're doing.</br>  <br>Misuzu.<br>So much sexual tension every time she talks to Jun.</br></br>  <br>Tomo and Jun are best couple, but Misuzu is best girl.</br>  Fuck everyone already with muh sexual tension. There's no sexual tension between Misuzu and Jun. It's just banter.  Is this any popular in Nippistan? Any chance for an adaptation?  <br>Anon, if two people of the opposite gender aren't all over each others' genitalia then it's obviously because they want to fuck really badly.</br>  <br>So the manga is a contest between Misuzu trying to crack Jun via Tomo and Jun trying to maintain his act regarding Tomo? Nice.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're having some sexual tension with /a/.</br>  <br>Only if it gets published like Danna ga nani</br>  <br>I want Tomo and Jun to get together, them to have a drunken threesome in college that leads to a short ménage à trois before they go back to how they were before.</br>  <br>I guess you're right. There's no plot to speak of an scenes are rather short.</br>  <br>Even if it is popular, there's no enough material to adapt properly. Out of 100 chapters you have enough material for maybe one 24 minute episode.</br>  I guess it could be an anime if they adapted around eight chapters into two minutes episodes. Like Teekyuu.  <br>My DICK.</br>  <br>You have to admit, if this was a different manga with no Tomo and just these two, everyone would be obsessed with the inevitable hate fucking.</br>  <br>Banner potential.<br><br>Mos tof Misuzu and Jun's panels together are actually.</br></br></br>  so does jun like her but doesnt think she likes him/doesnt want to ruin their friendship or is he just dense mc and doesnt realize she likes him or that he likes her.  <br>I think he's starting to like her but doesn't act on it in case it ruins their current relationship.</br>  <br>Probably as he got older he developed feelings and is trying to suppress them to not ruin the greatest friendship he has ever had. I don't think he is dense and understood what tomo meant but he didn't want to risk it.</br>  <br>Read </br>    <br><br>I have no idea what you expect that anon to do. I don't think you understand how cropping works.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sometimes, in panels like these, it looks like Misuzu's scrunchy is actually her hand. Like she's holding it up and doing a scratching motion, as if she's pretending to be a catgirl.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love to see some Tomo related banners</br>  <br>They could have changed the width of the window before taking the screenshot.</br>  <br>That's true. Still, I don't mind the picture as it is anyway.</br>  HERE'S WHAT  I think  HAPPENED.<br><br>Jun fell in love with her back since when they were kids, but she was too dense to notice/care about that. He confessed and she did the same shit he did (I love you too bro!). Feeling bad/guilty about potentially ruining his good friendship with her because of his selfish desires, he promised to never see her as a love interest again.<br><br>What's your theories?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i want her to push me down and wrap my dick in tomo's spats and jerk me off but squeeze and stop me from ejaculating whenever i get close until it becomes unbearable and she makes me beg her to let me cum where she finally gets me off by stepping on my dick.</br>  <br>My favorite part about this manga is seeing how far can Misuzu go in breaking Jun and what's the next childish act that Jun will do to make her shut up.<br><br>Saying shut up, pushing her in the rain, scrunchie throw, forehead flick. Bringing her face close like that is just asking for it.</br></br></br>  Fucking britfags.  <br>And Misuzu actually likes Jun but loves Tomo too much to step in but instead is doing what she can to drive them together since it is obvious to her Jun and Tomo's true feelings.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>They're all bakas.</br>    <br>Misuzu is actually in love with Jun but realizes she never had a chance since Tomo is so close to him. She got over it in due time but Jun's continued naivety regarding Tomo's feelings triggers her own guilt and insecurities, which is why she's so passive aggressive with him.</br>  <br>tfw you will never have tomboys falling for you ;_;</br>    <br>How many raw chapters are out?</br>    <br>Stop posting that in every thread<br><br><br>I would a Misuzu but my heart belongs to Tomo</br></br></br></br>   try to don't be too lewd   <br> 91 </br>  Jun loves Tomo but because Misuzu is trying to set them up he doesn't want to "lose" to Misuzu. Misuzu actually loves Jun and she is cucking herself.  <br>The proper term is britbong, anon</br>  <br>  I'm actually gay <br>  :D ? </br></br>    <br>I CAN DO IT<br>I CAN DO IT NINE TIMES</br></br>  <br>Not cool man</br>  <br>And now the wait begins.</br>  <br>At this point my guess would be something along those lines. Jun obviously likes Tomo, but he doesn't want to ruin their BFF relationship and so to stifle his desires tries to convince himself as hard as he can that Tomo is a guy. The reason he's so terse with Misuzu is because she's constantly trying to break his resolve.<br><br> Also Misuzu likes Jun but is repressing it for the sake of her friend. Her relationship with Jun's friend will kick off when he realizes this and starts teasing her about it. </br></br></br>  <br>Part of me hopes the scanlators will keep releasing in batches of ten so that these threads actually have purpose.</br>    <br>I can smeel the bloodbath from here<br><br><br>New chapter fucking when?</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>I really really need to know the reasons behind this "Misuzu loves Jun", i just don't get it</br></br></br>  <br>Delusional headcanon because they just want them to fuck.</br>  <br>L-lewd</br>        <br>The best friend who plays wingman while secretly liking the one they're trying to help their friend get with is a fairly common archetype. Doesn't mean it's true here, but that's why people keep bringing it up.</br>  <br>Why you didn't do these one for the latest chapter of Nisekoi? Goddamn it anon</br>    <br>Because the way Misuzu is so hostile and teasing to Jun exudes some sort of underlying frustration. The fact that the three of them are childhood friends makes it a strong possibility that Misuzu also had a crush on Jun at some point. She seemed to be demure and girly and could have been attracted to Jun's rough and tumble personality.<br><br>While Tomo and Jun's relationship is adorably awkward, Jun and Misuzu's is more dark and spicy for lack of a better simile.</br></br></br>  <br>How lax is the dress code in that high school?</br>  <br>We Nozaki-kun and Isshuukan Friends now</br>  <br/>      <br>Heyyy, nice too see you here satan.<br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>Real talk, broccoli really didn't do anything wrong and I was genuinely surprised to find out how /a/ reacts to that scene after I read it.</br>  <br>I agree, he didn't. Kurosawa should have done something about his crush on Takigawa. It's his own fault he lost her to Broccoli.  I was happy when he started dating the bully. </br>  <br>RULES OF NATURE</br>  How many chapters have been translated? The place I read it from has them group together like 1-10 is together, but it's only 10 pages which seems off to me.      <br>Because it feels like NTR, even though it isn't.</br>  <br>I assume both of you are talking about that manga where the guy with afro gets a girlfriend and the girl teased the hell out of MC, if not then i don't know</br>    <br>90 chapters out of 91. Its a daily webcomic, every chapter is a single page. The batches of 10 were the translators catching up with the backlog</br>  <br>Ah, thanks. It just seemed odd that each chapter was 1 page.</br>  <br> New chapter fucking when? <br>Not soon enough</br></br>    <br>Guess its time to wait for another half-year to see a new one</br>   Thread dies upon revelation that TLs are caught up.   <br>Why does this only happen to the best manga?</br>  <br>Dont forget the 10-days wait for another dump<br><br><br>It hurts to live</br></br></br></br>  <br>How often is it updated anyways?</br>    <br>It updates every day until caught up to the manga. The manga does a page. At best, once caught up we will get a chapter every week and a half</br>  <br>It's weird to see /pol/'s Arabic improving.</br>  <br>Every day, but since posting 1 page every day is kinda dumb we wait for at least 10 days</br>  <br>Read the scanlator's website.</br>  <br> Dont forget the 10-days wait for another dump <br>Have they confirmed how often they'll be TL-ing it?</br></br>  <br>I see it too</br>  <br> the girl teased the hell out of MC <br>But she didn't.<br>They were book buddies, nothing more, all the teasing was in his imagination.</br></br></br>  <br>See: </br>  nigga wtf  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br> wtf </br>  <br>I need some hints about that manga to read it, please anon<br><br><br>There's powerful niggatry at work here</br></br></br></br>  All this tomboy love.

But she wouldn't understand why they are sexy or why guys like them so much</br></br>  <br>If her legs get too strong, when she leg locks Juni wont be able to shake her off and he'll come inside!</br>  <br><br> But she wouldn't understand why they are sexy or why guys like them so much <br><br>Then how the hell would she know which panties were sexy for her to buy then?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Jun wont be able to shake her off and he'll come inside! <br> Implying that's not what she wants </br></br>  Pool chapter when?<br><br>Beach chapter when?<br><br>Hotspring chapter when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>because she will have seen them in a women's magazine during her research on how to get Jun to like her more</br>  <br><br>That's dumb - Tomo wouldn't know a women's magazine from a Playboy.<br><br>Unless Misuzu let her borrow one</br></br></br></br>  <br> Tomo wouldn't know a women's magazine from a Playboy. <br>That's the point<br>She'll pick up a softcore porn magazine because she'll see a bunch of boys looking at it and try to emulate it</br></br></br>  <br>It was YOU whom killed Gaston wasn't it!</br>  <br><br>Wouldn't that just end up with Tomo in a leash and collar with cat ears and a tail wearing sailor uniform?</br></br>  <br>fuck, has there ever been a series with hatefucking. My dick has never been this hard from all this sexual tension</br>  <br> whom <br>nope</br></br>  <br> Yes <br> She'd hate it, and Jun would laugh at her, causing poor Tomo to throw the cat ears and collar down out of frustration. She would cry adorable tomboy tears </br></br>  <br>misuzu</br>    <br> She's got HUGE...personality. </br>  <br>Is she really defenseless?</br>  <br>I feel like girls with small breasts being self-conscious about it is the one trope in anime/manga that will absolutely never die</br>  <br><br>She would be the worst possible person to ask though</br></br>  <br>An accredited university in Texas.</br>  She likes it.  <br>That's like saying the trope of people worrying about money will never die. Its a trope for a reason, it commonly happens in real life and most people (even those not afflicted with it) can relate to it</br>    <br>As much as I hate it and wish more anime girls would be proud of their DFC, you're right. It's too common in the real world for it to die. Maybe if flat became stylish again, but I doubt it'll happen.</br>  <br>But it's not like the vast majority of anime or manga creators can relate to being a girl with small breasts, or like the vast majority of the audience can either. I think it's just more of a cute thing that is thrown into every series because it's been done a thousand times before and no one's complained yet.</br>  They're probably gonna kiss and fuck without officially confessing. Like one day after a sparring session at the dojo the two find themselves inexplicably grappling, then Jun starts smelling her  <br>I complain about it.

The fact that in the future I'll be able to bang anime girls at any time is actually one of the things motivating me to keep going in life.</br>  <br>I'd drag her to a pool and stuff her long hair in the pool drain, she would be stuck and then she would drown.</br>  <br>Why do you want to bully the Tomo you horrible horrible person?</br>  <br><br>Can't be because Naoto is obviously by far the superior tomboy</br></br>    <br>No, I want flatchested girls to bully the Tomo.

It just feels as if there's something personal to her attacks at Jun. The next closest person she showed her 'dark' side to, was to Tanabe and that was when he was trying to interfere in Tomo and Jun's life. Call it delusional shipping, but there is just has to be something going on between Misuzu and Jun. Maybe it was a failed confession, or a rejected childhood romance, or even stood up at their promised meeting, but it just feels as if there is something more than a simple dislike between the two.</br>  <br><br>I'm not even about shipping, I just want her to be able to sometimes join in with Jun and Tomo for sex when she finally gets them together</br></br>  <br> You will never cuddle with Chie on the couch while watching Kung Fu movies after a big steak dinner </br>  <br><br>You realize you're going to have to cook that steak dinner, right?</br></br>  <br>I just wanted you to know anon, I got your reference.

I've done a few from this pic actually.  </br></br>  <br>How much for everything?</br>  <br>That's mai daughteru and I'm really unsure about selling her, actually.<br><br><br>That's lewd, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good don't sell her, I was just interested in seeing how much you were going to charge for her.</br>    <br>WHY WHY WHY WHY?<br>OH, It's from the show!</br></br>  <br> enuma elish <br> those two Rita doujins <br>I like you</br></br></br>  <br>How much for that magical nia?</br>  <br>How much for Tsukihi?</br>  <br>I would scan every single doujin and manga I own if I could do it without damaging them. <br>I'm tempted to get that book scanner someone posted in the other thread but I'm not 100% sure it's worth it. Seems kinda unstable too. <br><br>I just want to share.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Browse around and see which ones are good.<br>If I owned doujins and mangos I would prefer to scan them so I can read them easily without worrying about wearing out my books.</br></br>  <br>How much for both Nichijou nendies?</br>  <br>I kinda want that shredded one but 8" is titchy. Think I'd get the school girl. What're the shapes like?</br>  <br><br><br> shoot me a pm <br> asks in the thread anyways <br><br>Quit being retards.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This looks like it could work too. One of these days I'll have to go over to Staples or Best Buy and see if they have any on display that I can fiddle with. Seems like it'd be more convenient than trying to get a book to balance on the scanner bed just right.</br>  <br>That thing looks like a toy.<br>I'd be surprised if it were good quality.</br></br>  <br> Hook Ups board company is kill <br>Disappointed. <br><br><br>Was it your second deck or something I get razor tail within a few a weeks and they normally don't last me more than two months because they snap on me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> scanning &amp; damaging doujinshi. <br><br>For me, If I don't feel too strongly about a doujinshi, I won't scan it since I find scanning in general to be bothersome. <br><br>But, If I really like a doujinshi, I might not scan it since I want to keep by book in good condition. On the other hand I feel strongly enough, I'll rip it apart without hesitation (well maybe slight hesitation) since, it's worth scanning and sharing. <br><br><br>That looks pretty neat. Depending on the price/image quality(most important) I might get that. If it makes scanning faster and non-destructive (although it might be since some artwork goes directly into the spine, and you'd have to pry it open anyway) then I'm all for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one I'm considering costs close to $300 so it's pretty average. There seems to be some really nice and big ones, but those cost over a grand.<br><br>Yeah, I don't like touching them too much either. I prefer digital over physical when it comes to reading so it would benefit me too. <br><br><br>I've looked into those for a long time too and honestly none seem to be good enough to produce high quality scans. They seem to have problems keeping things strait and the image quality isn't too nice from what I've seen.<br>You'd have to get one yourself to really test it out, but I don't think it's worth the money and trouble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Got another fig of my beatiful waifu Rikka</br>  <br>Rikka is shit and also already has a boyfriend.</br>  <br>It was during a leg injury so I'd say maybe 3 of those 5 months weren't skated.</br>  <br>Shit fig.<br>Shit waifu.</br></br>  <br> not cucking yuuta </br>  <br>I just grabbed an image from the first result off Amazon. It only saves in JPEG or PDF, though supposedly it scans at 300, 600 or 900 DPI.<br><br><br> If it makes scanning faster and non-destructive (although it might be since some artwork goes directly into the spine, and you'd have to pry it open anyway) then I'm all for it. <br>Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I have a hard time keeping things balanced on my scanner, which is quite old now. Sometimes I don't dare try to scan something because the binding's too stiff and I want to keep damage to a minimum.<br><br><br> They seem to have problems keeping things strait and the image quality isn't too nice from what I've seen. <br>Most of my scans with a regular scanner end up crooked anyway so that doesn't bother me so much. Sucks about the quality though. I probably won't be buying one for a while, anyway; have other things to get first that take priority.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  filename <br>same</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry but I wouldn't be caught dead with this kind of stuff in public. I'm a lay-low faggot that likes anime and occasional cute girls doing cute things but how can this be socially acceptable to parade outside publicly?</br>  <br>Also got Ryuko while I was at AX</br>  <br>Please scan the Ran Yakumo one. She's been my waifu for like 10 years.<br><br>If you have other Ran ones or foxgirl ones scan those too.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit taste.<br>I wouldn't be surprised if you overpaid for those shitty prize figures too.</br></br>  <br>And Satsukki</br>  <br><br>How much did you pay?</br></br>  <br>normalfag get out</br>  <br>$20 each</br>  <br>That seems pretty neat. I've had a bunch of stuff I've been meaning to scan, but it is a pain in the ass.

I'm just not getting why they'd be bootleg. That would be weird, though.</br>  1 more week  <br>They even made it out with my name.

Here are my general reasons.<br><br>Legitimate covers:<br>-Unlicensed doujin art sold only at Comiket or commissioned at Toranoana<br>-AJ two-way tricot material<br>-Retails for around 12,000 yen<br><br>Kinokuniya x Animate covers:<br>-Same art<br>-Peach skin material<br>-Sold for 40 USD<br><br>Some covers included exclusives that were sold only on one website and limited to 100 pieces. There is no way it would go for 40 USD at some convention in the United States.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I mean, plenty of official covers have been on shitty smooth knit and sold at low(er) prices. But yeah, if it's the same design as some exclusive then it's definitely a bootleg. That is strange.</br>   get dio fig <br> face where he grins has defects <br>Damn it.</br></br>  <br> -Peach skin material <br>Confirmed bootleg</br></br>  <br> -AJ two-way tricot material <br>There are other makers besides AJ, you know. And comiket is just a fraction of what comes out, plenty of covers are done through mail order or other events (like ore no yome). I know what you mean, but it's a bit misleading.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and Maxima.</br>  I just got a couple of Dragon Ball figures in today, Goku and Gyūmaō. I'm amazed that Japan can sell these figures so cheaply. American equivalents at these prices (Funko Pop! for instance) are pieces of shit. Gyūmaō is especially impressive. It's incredibly solid and has some great detail and paint apps.  <br>Reasonable.</br>  <br>You already posted this exact post in the other thread.</br>  <br><br> all that shit taste <br><br>please off yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one replied  :( </br>  Is it possible to recover from the slope without quitting cold turkey?<br>Like, just buying shit from time to time.</br>  <br>wait a minute I seem to remember seeing a pic of the gun wielding Bulma post-hotglue session</br>  <br>Not mine. It's a cheap figure though, so it wouldn't suprise me.</br>  <br>You sure it wasn't yours?</br>    <br><br>It's actually what would anyone pay for a prize on release.<br>Prize figures usually retail for 1.5k~, add 1k from RSAL (and the 500 yen fee from Manda if you ordered there) and you end up with 2.5/3k, which is $20/25.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty pissed I missed the sketch sessions.</br>  <br>I did that for half a year telling myself that the figures I want are going to bin when they get released anyway.<br><br>They fucking didn't and figinstock is not being helpful.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, I managed to buy fewer figs but now I'm making up for it by purchasing more Manga and Importing BD's.<br>There is no getting off the slope, you just slide in a different direction.</br></br>    <br>Aw shit I'm guessing that is the Yukino that's coming soon</br>  <br>Such a beautiful pose.</br>  <br><br>But when is Yukino going to get an actually good figure?</br></br>  <br> mfw "Nichijou didn't sell well, the Nendos will be like 10 bucks a piece, don't wanna pay 30 for 'em" </br>   Here're some pictures of the fig. The window's popping out in that corner, but the rest isn't damaged.    <br>Why do you have this saved on your phone?</br>  <br>Not that guy, but I've weirder shit saved on my phone.<br>Applocking and gallery hiding is a thing, so it's fine.</br></br>  <br>Well I wasn't asking you now was I?</br>  <br><br>Because hotglued figures get me hard</br></br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I've got porn all over my phone.

Piece of shit of them to do that.</br>  I want it to be WonFes already.  <br>I like your hand, very nice piece. How much is it?</br>  <br>Alright. I'll PM you on MFC so you can let me know if she opens back up.</br>  <br>Me too.</br>  <br> wanting the threads to be filled with humongous faggot tumblr users </br>  <br>Sounds more enticing than spending time in your company.</br>  <br>This is me and I don't give a fuck.

Anime tiddies is anime tiddies</br>  <br>I've had this happen to me a few times and I'm almost convinced it's just customs because nothing has ever been damaged despite the boxes being ripped all over.</br>  <br>Nah man, just nah. I thought people had a point about not all doujins ending up scanned, but there is no point in reading a doujin without translation.</br>  <br>Some of this isn't officially printed and translated in every country, and some people want to give back to the creator in some way, so you just buy it in nip.</br>  <br>You're silly, and cease these assumptions.</br>  <br> but there is no point in reading a doujin without translation. </br>  <br> TWO YEARS </br>  <br>It motivates you to learn more. Besides, the majority of what /a/ is buying isn't exactly Shakespeare.</br>  I haven't added to my doujinshi/h-manga collection in a little while<br>There are so many that I still want</br>  So how do you guys take care of your doujinshi? Do you just toss them on the self or do you put them in sleeves first?  http://shamoe.taobao.com/<br>https://moes.taobao.com/<br><br>Are taobao goods good?<br>Is it ironic that the name is a combination of sham + moe?</br></br></br></br>  Someone commented that you should complain to Amazon about their packaging in order to get better packaging for overseas customers.<br><br>NO.<br><br>Do not do this.<br><br>Amazon is a domestic seller. Countries have their own Amazon for a reason. It is part of their organizational structure to focus on domestic shipping only. <br><br>International shipping for figures is a service they provide as a favor, not request or demand. They will not bow to requests and disrupt their domestic shipping speed and processes to accommodate international customers further. The result will be that they will deem it too big of a hassle if too many people complain and will scale back their sales.<br><br>Amiami does this consistently. There is a reason that the Seven Sins figures are not sold overseas. It's because too many people cancelled or complained about the exorbitant shipping prices. Similar things will happen if you complain to Amazon about their boxes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the store. I haven't bought from that one before, though I have a number of products from slolita. Their stuff is all pretty good quality, though not as nice as most Japanese makers. The biggest thing to be worried about is if they're just using generic images, because there's likely very little quality control and they're just printing whatever they can rip from pixiv or whatever.</br>  <br> Being this much of a beta faggot </br>  <br>I'll just pick out my favorite and compliment that.<br>Shougono!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127712756 <br> hotgluing a shit figure with   shit hair <br>Have more respect for your husbando, Anon.</br></br>  <br>Retards ruin it for everyone.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127712756 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127712808 <br>Holyshit, fuck off and kill yourself</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127712756 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127712808 <br> hotgluing a JoJo <br> not hotgluing a Pochaco or Sonico or literally any other figure </br></br></br>  <br> Countries have their own Amazon for a reason. <br>Mine doesn't.</br></br>  <br><br><br> Not hotgluing a JoJo <br>What are you some kind of faggot?</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127712808 <br>Use your dickpussy instead of your snotty nose.</br>  <br>what about my boypussy juice?</br>  <br>My husubando is Joseph, I want to practise on his  best  son so I can know what I'm doing and give my him justice.</br>  <br>How much for the Wo Nendo?</br>  <br><br>Don't need to be able to read moon to understand porn.</br></br>    <br>The seven sins line is not sold overseas for copyright issues, nothing to do with shipping considering most of them were made to order and people paid for them in advance.</br>  <br> there is no point about how a dick goes into a girl's asshole at a rapid motion, but in Japanese </br>  <br> not reading hentai for the engaging plot and witty dialogue </br>  <br>nigga gonna get beat if he skate up with that to any skate park i ever been to</br>  <br>The seven sins figures were not that expensive to ship, retard.

I'm looking up Treasure Festa right nowIs it purely a garage kit convention?  <br>What are you talking about?<br><br>I simply expressed my desire to crucify shitposters because they do not contribute to anything.</br></br></br>  Where do people preorder prize figures from if not from HLJ?  <br>From  the guide </br>  <br>You buy them from people who have won them in the games.</br>  <br>It's so cringeworthy hearing people do that, or literally saying<br> Shiggy diggy  <br>It's amusing to listen to but embarrassing at the same time.</br></br></br>  <br>BIJ, amiami.</br>  <br>Could I request a link for that specific daki?</br>  <br>From recent memory the Pochaco noodle stopper was up on BiJ and I believe that amiami sometimes has the ones that FuRyu makes. I don't believe very many people here actually buy them so getting information might be tough.</br>  <br><br>Where have you been?</br></br>  Cute.  Panda.  <br>Not really, her face looks weird.</br>  <br>It's shit</br>  <br>Face and hair are nice, but I don't like the pose, those arms cover too much of her body.</br>  <br>I'm surprised you didn't get ripped off.<br><br><br>Is it an Amazon jp thing for you guys? I had it happen with a bunch of Amazon com packages, they just can't pack for shit. Books that were supposed to be new had dents that made them look like they were used.</br></br></br></br>  I really thought I wanted a Fight Club Mako nendoroid, but now I'm starting to feel like I don't give a fuck. I just want a really good display case and the Alter Yuri Lowell  <br><br>Vacation<br><br><br><br>.jp is rough on their packages, yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     was meant for this post    one and only nendoroid from 2009 <br> kinda want a new one </br>  <br>your shit</br>  <br>Amazon in general cuts costs far more aggressively than any other company that I know of, including Wal-Mart, and they still manage to operate at a loss.</br>  <br> dat shirt opening <br>I think I can peep just a little belly. What a slut!</br></br>  <br>God bless</br>  Do newer nendoroids still suffer from plasticizers leakage?  <br>yes.</br>  Does anyone know a store which sells 160 x 50 cm pillows for dakimakura? I want an actual Japanese brand, but I don't want to use a proxy.  <br>You can buy them at the  guide. </br>  any day from now  <br>Her face is so beautiful. I just wished her arms didn't cover her whole body.</br>   plasticizers <br>I'm eventually buying the entire set of BRS scales sometime in the future; like when they reach their 1st decade. Is there any visible signs when a figure has already lost it's plasticizer and had to be washed? I could probably use this as a way to get a better deal.</br>  <br><br>My mom works for Alter and she said she's gonna get delayed to January</br></br>  <br> decade <br>not even, maybe like 6 years max if you keep some interchangeable parts inside the box</br></br>  <br>really?<br>my dad works for amico and i already got it<br>can't post pics though because someone might get fired</br></br></br>  <br>lies<br><br>The guide gives no info for 160 x 50 pillows.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry lemme rephrase; so a good estimate when a scale fig starts leaking it's shit is 6 years?</br>  <br>Make your own. Fill your dakimakura with pillow fluff directly. Or try ebay. You can probably get a 160x50 pillow-inner case with a zipper for like $8-10 and stuff it yourself.</br>  I'm in Japan and I bought these tankoubon and this doujinshi. Going back to Canada in a few days and I'm wondering if I'll get in trouble if customs saw these. I deliberately avoided buying anything that didn't have huge breasts on the cover ( a shame, really) except for the shirobako one. Should I send it all by post instead? Canada really doesn't like this sort of thing.  <br><br><br>Who do I believe?</br></br></br>  <br>That is actually a pretty good idea, thanks.</br>  <br>Your heart</br>  <br>it really depends on your room's temperature</br>  got these this year at the AX. i have more stuff, but these are the ones that stand out  <br>Are you people really living in an egalitarian, crime free society without any kind of economic problems so your gov has nothing else to do except to crack down on loli?</br>  <br> $20 for tankabou <br><br>Seriously. Why manga so expensive in burgerland?</br></br></br>  <br>meh didnt mind the price really. bought it on the last day and that was the only bosshi related thing they had</br>  <br>supply and demand, bosshi was at ax</br>  <br>Don't underestimate the plight of the 2d girls.</br>    <br>I wish these weren't based on their S2 designs. I just want a good figure of Ponkan's art.</br>  <br>I go to parks all the time in my Miku t-shirt. People give me wierd looks for a bit but then they start talking to me and stuff after I skate for a bit.</br>  <br>to be fair that section was for the covers, not inner pillow.</br>  <br>Damage control intensifies.</br>  <br>Manga is around 10 at normal book stores. I assume it's the licensing that jacks up the price.</br>  <br>more middlemen means it's more expensive.</br>   tfw probably too early to expect paint at wonfes   <br> The HGH of Haruhi Suzumiya <br>gettin HUGE</br></br>  Do people like or hate Broly? i personally love him, but i've seen so many people who hate him, and the same amount of people who love him.<br><br>i can totally admit that he has the absolute worst backstory of all dbz villians, but still, he annihilates all of the saiyins and piccolo post fusion.<br><br>does he suck? or is he cool?</br></br></br></br>  Never watched the movies so I don't know who he is really  <br>here's the full movie<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=HgN<wbr>QhF-QBCY</wbr>  [ ]<br>decide for yourself, bro</br></br></br>  <br><br>Toei original shitty stories starring your favorite characters being out of character and fodder to everything.</br></br>  <br>dude what does that even mean?</br>  His movies suck, he's retarded and he looks cool as hell.  <br>space hulk has a particularly annoying place in the fandom</br>  <br>even if his movies suck (which is true) does Broly suck?</br>  <br>he's suppose to be like Jason voorhees</br>  Let me guess:<br><br> first movie is good <br> second movie broly gets pissed on <br> third movie broly is literally a green piece of shit </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wanted to be Broly as a kid because his power's maximum.</br>  <br> second movie broly gets pissed on <br>He wrecked a SSJ2. And unlike the real timeline, in the Japanese version Gohan did state he was stronger than before. So he pretty much beat the shit out of someone on SSJ2 Goku tier.</br></br>  <br>Was needed at least one ss2 and 2 full power ss1 full kamehamehas to send him to the sun</br>  <br>Not even harm it just pushing him to the sun to let it make the job</br>  I loved Broly but that's mainly because I've always loved the Venom type enemy in shounen series.  How strong would Broly be after training for 4 months?  <br> giving a shit about filler garbage </br>  <br>People like him because of his muscles and he is strong.</br>  Posting in a broly thread  <br>What the fuck is wrong with the music? Did you burgers really have to watch and listen to that piece of shit as kids?</br>  I like Broly. He makes the whole cast look so weak in comparison when he fights them. And I don't care about his lame story, his motivation is about as reasonable as every other dumb villain in the series.<br><br>Fight me.</br></br>  He literally gives fantastic experience in Xenoverse.  <br><br>ah yes because vegeta would totally never shut down and become a total bitch towards someone he knows he doesn't stand a chance against.<br><br>BoG never happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no chance of the love/hate population being comparable. <br>Hell, I almost never read of someone hating him. <br>He's easily one of the most liked DBZ villains.</br></br></br>  <br> English <br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it has a horrible fanbase that does nothing but jerk him off as the power maximum strongest (like your pic OP) when he's weaker that Cell.</br>  <br><br> not listening to best-language <br><br>is the white-mans dick scary?</br></br></br></br>  1st movie is GOAT as far as DBZ is concerned. Just pretend the ending never happened and Broly killed them all.  <br>I hate Broly personally. For the sole reason that he's not enjoyable. He has what borders on no personality, is just rediculously powerful for the sake of power. I can't for the life of me see Broly as a person. He's a thing. Like a train or an asteroid.<br>I can at least relate to most DBZ villains,<br>Freeza,Cell, Buu. Even movie villains like Garlic Jr. at least make sense to me.<br>Broly feels like a concept that was started and never fleshed out. Like he's the beggining of an idea that was never completed. <br>Broly is basically the original "But is he stronger than Madara Uchiha?" of anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Cooler movie was worse.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9fu<wbr>WU-8WwLM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Venom type <br>Wut?</br></br>  <br><br>who would win between broly and madara?</br></br>  <br>Which Madara?</br>  <br><br> I actually like that version when I was like 13 <br><br>Am I a bad person?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had to guess I'd say like Venom from Spider-Man, the antagonist that's basically a bigger, stronger version of the protagonist with a personal grudge against him.</br>  <br>Make sense.</br>  <br>Yeah this. I fucking love those types of villains. Same with  Kevin Eleven from Ben 10.  Why the fuck did they have to turn him into one of the good guys again?  ;_; </br>  <br>It's actually pretty funny<br> peter parker gets bullied daily  <br> gets superpowers <br> wow now I'm not going to get bullied anymore <br> the very same bully get possessed by alien symbiote and beats his shit again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Flash is a good guy.</br>  <br>He's a shower not a grower.</br>  I just really want to know where all the popularity for Broly came from.<br><br>I thought I had a pretty similar experience to some people growing up with DBZ, but I always feel like I just missed something when Broly comes up. His movie was fine like any of the others, not great but not terrible, and then the sequels were pretty shit. As a character he's always just been one of the movie villains, like any of the rest, but some people act like he's more important than the TV bad guys.<br><br>Is it really just an overdone meme or is there something to it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you asking what made Broly stick out in popularity among other DBZ movies? He has a great design and personality. That's it.</br>  <br> personality <br>Who were we talking about again?<br><br>I mean I guess he's more interesting than Lord Slug.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shonenfags are powerlevel circlejerkers <br> Big guy is introduced <br> Legendary super saiyan <br> Buff as fuck <br> Literally, just fucking ripped <br> Man handles the entire cast <br> Only through the power of friendship was he able to be beat <br><br>Kids love their maximum</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Imagine how far Broly's cum would shoot with his muscle dick force.  Why does Kagami have such good taste in music?  why are miyuki's tits so weird?  Kagami's looking as flat as Konata.  <br>Is this a joke?</br>  Because she's perfection.    <br>Because it's an incredibly blatant attempt to pander to middle-aged men? 0% chance a Japanese high school girl knows who ACDC is</br>  Is Tsukasa looking at Kagami's fine butt?  <br> Izumi Konata is a stupid otaku stick insect! <br>10/10 banter</br></br>  <br>DELETE THIS</br>  <br>What if she's just rebelling against her religious parents?</br>    <br>I had my cursor hovering over submit when the page refreshed and you already posted it.</br>  <br>Are you thunderstruck by what a best girl Kagami is?</br>  <br>Kona pls, that pun was bad.</br>  <br>Bad puns done dirt cheap.</br>  Happy birthday~  <br>When I first read Lonely Kagami I didn't think my life would turn out like hers</br>  <br>At least you probably don't play pachinko, so you've got that going for you.</br>  <br>Yeah it's only one of the most famous rock bands in the world and has toured japan since the 80s</br>  <br>That's the pattern of her shirt, idiot. There's nothing weird about Miyuki's tits.</br>  <br>Miyuki's tits are pretty fuckin weird mate.</br>  Can we just post some bummed out LS?    <br> All my teeth fell out! </br>              Well this was a nice thread while it lasted.    <br>please stop it wasn't suppose to end like this</br>     Kagami thread <br> On Tanabata <br> No one here has realized that it's her birthday today <br>What the heck /a/?</br></br></br>    <br><br>see </br></br>  <br>I might do a KonaxKagami thread tomorrow, for her birthday.<br><br>I guess this thread can't be helped anymore.</br></br></br>    Best girl  <br>It's Kagamis birthday tomorrow? that's weird to think.<br><br> Assuming she was 18 when she left highschool, she would be around 25 now </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, time goes fast.</br>  <br>Lucky Star is 8 years old, it doesn't even feel like it should be 4 years old to me.</br>  Why are the girls shit-tier compared to Miyuki?  Kagami is love.  <br>Dunno, the boobs?</br>  <br>Her boobs are weird but, see the OP; they're all upwards angled and freaky and shit.</br>  Surely I'm not the only one here that doesn't think ACDC is very good.  <br>That's the headcannon I follow.<br><br><br>You've got that entirely backwards.<br>Miyuki is too irrelevant to even be shit tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukasa bullying someone? <br>Is that possible? <br>Are you the same guy who posts tsukasa weird images?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't reply to that shit.</br>  <br>Please post more.</br>    <br>  M E M E S </br>  <br>;__;</br>  <br>That doujin was great.
