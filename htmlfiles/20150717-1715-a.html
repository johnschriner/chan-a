The important thing is that your reference image is not overcluttered with pictures that probably won't be used, but it needs a good view of the whole body, outfit, haircut and references with colour.</br>  Requesting Teto with her top opened in a cumshot picture on her face + chest or into her womb, smiling and double peace no ahegao.  <br>Thanks, I'll clear the final image up a bit, then</br>  Requesting Shinji making the facial expression and gesture on the right, please.   sniff lolibutt <br><br>Requesting her on all four.</br></br>  <br>Requesting that guy on the right making Shinji's facial expression and gesture, please<br> Would be ideal if the same person drew both, it'd be good practice </br></br>  <br>it's not like there is a limit of the requests you can post,<br>i'm posting one on each thread like everyone else</br></br>  Requesting Hibiki Tachibana from Symphogear and Madoka Kaname from Madoka Magica doing the Sekiha Love Love Tenkyoken  Requesting a creature documentary session with Steve Irwin.  <br> requests after getting deliveries <br> insults people who call you out </br></br>  Requesting Sawyer laid out on the couch, in her panties and a t-shirt, enduring the sweaty heat of the South East Asian summer.<br><br>Optionally with a SNES controller in one hand and a running fan in the background.</br></br>  <br>Pacifica instead</br>  Requesting this fusion chart, thanks in advance.<br>Of Futayo Honda, Angela, and Jun the Swan</br>  Patchouli holding on to a huge burger and large drink.  <br> requests after getting deliveries <br>pretty much like everyone on these threads<br> insults people who call you out <br>never happened</br></br></br></br>  Rea as a futa fucking Ranko and pumping her womb full of cum<br>Rea is a partial zombie so make her have only fucking her on her mind, and power of a zombie (really strong) and her eyes are supposed to be red  I do not mind balls </br>  <br> pretty much like everyone on these threads <br>Except you do it in the weekend threads too<br> never happened <br>Yes it has<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127736<wbr>213/#127751856</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh</br>  <br>cute</br>  <br><br>cute</br></br>  <br>Nigga why do you think we have WWD threads?</br>  <br>kawaii</br>  Requesting Kanna Kirigami receiving a headpat (from a feminine hand)  <br><br>You should design the next generation of pocket monsters. <br>10/10 would put to sleep, pound, and capture.</br></br></br>  <br>He does go to them, he just rerequests even after getting deliveries.</br>  Requesting your waifu wearing the "November Rain" wedding dress.  <br>That's what's I'm getting at. He obviously doesn't understand the purpose of the WWD as a containment thread.</br>  Can I get lewds of the two silver haired girls from Strike the Blood? Together, solo/staight, or like /u/ whatever is okay.  <br> Except you do it in the weekend threads too <br>at least I request the same character, unlike most of people who are actually haremfags<br> insults people who call you out <br>i don't see any insults</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, I mean he rerequests in the WWD even after getting a delivery that same weekend.<br><br> at least I request the same character, unlike most of people who are actually haremfags <br>You're not any better seeing as you're rude to everyone and rerequest.<br> i don't see any insults <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127736<wbr>213/#q127752686</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128181067 <br><br>Too bad Flatchouli doesn't look like that.</br></br>  <br>So people like koborifag can double dip</br>  <br>Stop trying to shitpost yourself koborifag</br>    <br> He obviously doesn't understand the purpose of the WWD as a containment thread. <br> Waifufags made the WWD to contain themselves <br> Tfw there are people that still think the WWD are some kind of "Waifu Request Containment Threads" </br></br></br>   Prim and proper in public, but a sub-human beast in bed who screams hard and bites her lover's shoulders whenever she is fucking him. And she loves raw anal. <br>Draw both sides of Ikaruga, perhaps the former mainly in a sexual act, suggestive, or completely SFW.</br>  <br>I don't see any Koborifag requests here or last thread.</br>  <br>That's what they started out to be. Otherwise, what's the point in having WWD in the first place?</br>  <br> That's what they started out to be. <br>Tell me when the WWD started.</br></br>  <br>Did you see who opted for the OP of last thread?</br>  <br> Guns &amp; Roses </br>  <br> Never happened <br>I wouldn't know about getting called out for anything, but you certainly were being rude over somebody expressing their opinion over trivial matters.</br></br>  Requesting Birdy riding a thick cock and being creampied.  <br>Fuck off, that doesn't count. SSF asked for waifus and waifufags responded. That's not normal requesting.</br>  <br>Nice job dodging my question.</br>  <br>I don't know how close they are to the original style but for references you don't usually want strange poses unless you're requesting the pose itself. <br>You want good resolution shots of every angle.</br></br>  Requesting Sailor Jupiter cosplaying as Mai Shiranui, preferably in her jiggle-crouch pose on the bottom right.  Requesting a cute feet pic of Nepgear, would greatly appreciate it!  <br>I can use fan art too.</br>  <br>So you don't know when the WWD started. You understand that making up claims when you have no idea what you're talking about makes you look like a fool, right?</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>Araki's characters are always doing strange poses so that's not a problem I guess, this may be fan art but it's close to his style and is one of the clearer shots of her outfit from the back</br>  <br>The threads were started by Ristyfag and Gwenbro in order to limit the same generic waifu requests in the general. Do you know what you're talking about?</br>  <br>reminder that nepgear is an evil bitch who kills the rest of the cast.</br>  <br> titty monster Rukia <br><br>ruined</br></br></br>  <br> The threads were started by Ristyfag and Gwenbro in order to limit the same generic waifu requests in the general. <br>And you're still wrong. They were created specifically to summon drawfags to get more deliveries. Do you know what you're talking about? <br><br>You should try not to parrot other anons without a clear idea of what they are saying.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ristyfag <br> The first waifufag on the WWD threads <br>I learned something today.</br></br></br>  <br>True, but she's still cute</br>  <br>For some reason I want a really busty and curvy Nepgear</br>  <br>It was Lilianabro to Gwenfag.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128182174 <br><br>Kill yourself both, scum.</br></br>  <br>So tell me why we even bother having separate threads then, if they're just going to be used for the same purpose?</br>    <br>The weekend thread are specifically and only meant to be for waifu/husbando/daughteru requests. They are meant for general, one character, simple requests for drawfags to draw. The general threads have more complicated or specific requests of a different variety. When those WWD threads were started, they were started with the idea to attract lingering drawfags because waifufags wanted more drawings and hated waiting for threads to randomly pop up. The summoning threads were just threads left so that hopefully if a drawfag were interested, they'd draw some waifus for them. <br><br>These threads evolved into the current system of threads, where they became a Weekend only thing originally proposed as means for starter up drawfags or other drawfags to practice on simple requests that aren't "General Drawthread" tier requests while simultaneously satiating the endless hunger for waifufags to get pics of their waifu. They were never meant to contain anything. They were made by waifufags out of pure lust for deliveries, not to limit themselves.</br></br></br>  <br> daughteru <br>I'm tempted to request my daughterus in them.</br></br>  I want lewd with Misaki Shokuhou from Railgun and Miku Izayoi from Date a Live<br>Both have mind-controlling abilities.</br>  <br>They've always been fine to request. Just don't be a faggot and request your daughteru and waifu/husbando separately, though there is no way to actually enforce "house rules" like those.</br>  <br>My birthday is coming up soon(right when the weekend ends), is a request involving my waifu and two daughterus too much to ask for? I actually got something involving my waifu and one of my daughterus a while ago.</br>  <br>Should be fine if they are all in a single request as a theme.</br>  <br>Nothing is too much to ask, whether anyone will take it is a different story.</br>  <br><br>Might as well try, I'll probably have a simpler back up request just in case.</br></br>  <br>This is true<br>Safest bet is to just draw for the ones you've already drawn for.</br></br>  <br>I do it all the time. Requesting my waifu with my daughterus, don't see any problem with it, just that it's a pretty big request so it's doubtful anyone will take it.</br>  I have 2 requests<br>1.) Remove tentacle hair and give Ika 10 legs<br>2.) Squid for a head Girl</br></br>  Requesting an adult Kise Yayoi from Smile PreCure getting her dream job  as a member of a tokusatsu team.   <br>Are they actual daughterus as in OC or "these are characters I like im calling them my daughter"</br>  <br>As in they are canonically my waifus daughters.</br>  <br>Are you implying that daughterus aren't "actual" unless they're oc donut steal?</br>  <br> daughteru  <br>This sounds like a bullshit excuse to get another character drawn honestly.</br></br>  <br>Unless they canonically dont have parents yes</br>  <br>Thank you for telling us what you think as though nobody else has ever thought the same.</br>  Requesting Piccolo playing the piccolo  <br>You must be a special kind of stupid.</br>  <br>Top cuck</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br>I see you live somewhere that doesn't have the concept of "Loving someone like their your own kid"</br>  <br> My waifu is from a video game and when you marry her with your Avatar/self-insert player character you get two daughters, no cuck shit here </br>  <br>Counter requesting vegeta playing piccolo's piccolo.</br>  <br> abducting kids just so you can have people draw them </br>    Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  Want to share your list of daughteru?  Something of Catherine: some porn of any kind of taking a shower/bath  <br>No.</br>  How many haremfags were now going to see this weekend?  <br>I only have one.</br>  What happens if anons share the same daughteru?  <br>They take care of her together, I guess?<br> Two daddies. </br></br>  <br>The trips have spoken</br>  Requesting Turn-A fighting a bunch of Mass Production EVAs  <br>I have two daughterus, but you will never know who.</br>  <br>They request each other in the WWD and 34 has someone besides her requesting 3D.</br>  <br>Unless they actually reassemble you in a way you'll always be cucked</br>  <br> requesting 3D <br>Why is this allowed? No, seriously, why is this allowed?</br></br>  <br>That sounds pretty dumb.</br>  <br>I'm cucking myself with a player character that the developers made out to be an extention of the player themselves? Ok then.</br>  <br>Because she's a drawfag<br>Are you going to argue against that?</br></br>   or<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128044<wbr>549/#q128055744<br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>You've improved a lot, a couple months ago your stuff looked like shitty tracings with dead flat colors.</br>  <br>That's super good, all of them!

Except I don't like gyaru make-up. Just have her be dressed like a cum dumpster with a horse a foot and a half up inside of her.<br>That's the stuff.</br></br>  <br><br> a majority of those are sites that debunks your claim <br><br>good job</br></br></br></br>   implying pure gyaru girls aren't the best <br>Please.</br>  <br>I'm not autistic enough to count them up for you, but anyone who isn't wishful thinking hard can see the reality</br>  <br>Thats why I said it should be a pure girl. But then like <br>said put a cock at least 18 inches inside her. Thats how you do it.<br><br>I guess you can go backwards too, but thats a different thing altogether.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sourcee</br>  <br>that anus doesn't look THAT good, IMO.</br>  <br>Pure Love Mellow.</br>  <br><br>google search gave me this<br>http://exhentai.org/g/364466/23456b<wbr>d937/</wbr></br></br></br>  Anything ever happen with that Kohaku unleashing Gilgamesh's weapon a few threads ago?  <br>That's it.<br>Pure Love Mellow is just the entire volume of this and more.</br></br>  <br>But it looks so clean and succulent. I'd tongue that asshole all fucking day.</br>  <br> entire volume of this and more <br>thanks bruv.</br></br>  <br>I prefer ones that look like the doujins from Mizu</br>  <br>No problem, brah.</br>  <br>Which Mizu?</br>  <br>the one that does loli doujins with a lot of anal.<br>they're on sadpanda.</br></br>  Did you draw the Neko Nepgear drawing?  In response to the -tan arguments and some of the responses from previous threads about the way some could be turned to snuff crap or not:<br><br>There are examples of fanfics written for dunk tank stuff that involved death either in the form of drowning (top lid closing or weights/rocks tied to them) or eating by shark/piranha (in the one coming to mind, the girls being dunked still got off on it...go figure).<br><br>There are also fics involving girls being asphyxiated by various forms of gags, or the gag being a mask/tube of some sort that pumps gas into them and kills them.<br><br>There are also fics, and drawn pictures (even in actual games), of everything from pillories in the form of guillotines where when the girl cums the blade lops her head off, to horse-dicking to the point of bursting out of the girl and killing her, to bondage/torture involving crushing parts of girls bit by bit, to girls being strung up by their clothing and killed, to apron-wearing girls being shoved into ovens and burned.<br><br>So you see, the problem isn't the dunkfags, nor the gag-fags, nor the pillory or bondage or horse or clothingfags or the apronfags. They aren't the ones getting off to horribly maiming and damaging waifus.<br><br>The real problem is the deathfags/snuffags, the people who will take anything at all, no matter how normal or how kinky, and turn it into straight horror and guro. Sure, everyone's got their own kink, but if you get off to bloodletting and murder, that's a special kind of fuckery that everyone and anyone should be able to unite against.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, no, I forgot. Did you?<br><br><br>Yeah but I don't know any of those here. If I did I'd rage three times as hard as the dunk haters at them.</br></br></br></br>  REQUESTING:<br>Battle of the Bands with BECK Mongolian Chop Squad against Ho-kago Tea Time</br>  Requesting these two fucking like http://imgur.com/a/YWsZE or http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=31057 or or something competitive like mud wrestling; alternatively this with any of the other goddesses and their counterparts (ie Vert, Blanc)</wbr>  <br> no, you should be able to get off to whatever without persecution<br>as long as you dont bring that shit into the real world youre fine.<br>cumming to drawings that are on a computer screen doesnt do anyone harm</br></br> </br>  <br>Nope..</br>    <br><br>Behold.</br></br>  Requesting Eli making a footjob meanwhile she's wearing striped stockings and red glasses please    <br>Niiiiiiice!

That would be too easy. </br></br>  <br>wise wolf</br>  So it turns out I like tomboys. Or maybe I'm just so unfashionable that I don't know how to pick out clothes for a girl.  It's probably not very fitting  <br>Nah I actually just wanna act as her suge onii chan. Teach her a thing or 2 about the streets. See her learn lessons the hard way so she can can become tough.  ok maybe just a little but godamn if i'm gonna let some other worthless winy maggot get inside her first fuck no first he's gotta pass through me. </br>  <br>looks slav</br>  <br><br> That's right, anon! </br></br>  <br>It was pretty easy.

Do I have shit taste for actually liking it? I know it's nothing special, but it's fun.  <br>The anime makes it pretty clear that they don't give a shit about making the setting even mildly realistic. <br><br>Just enjoy the pantsu and incent jokes</br></br></br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128143089 <br>Nigga pls, Owari no Seraph was totally worth it.</br>  <br> Do I have shit taste for actually liking it? <br> wanting to fit in <br>Grow a spine niggah</br></br></br>  <br> show is shit <br> main girl is super cute <br> main girl gets majority of the screentime <br> tfw the show is, then, actually not shit </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm ashamed to say that some elections actually turn out that way.</br>  <br> just for Mirai <br>Opinion discarded.</br></br>  <br>I admit, I came THIS close to watching that trash vampire show for her.<br>But then Idid some timing and realized that wasting half an hour on a shit show just for a couple of minutes, if not seconds, of her is not worth it.

If I like a show, but the rest of /a/ doesn't, it won't let it ruin my experience. That's just stupid</br>  <br> implying this isn't true for 3D japs <br><br>This is why personality matters. Because there's nothing else to go on.</br></br></br>  <br>You make that sound like a bad thing.</br>  <br> Some <br>The whole process of election is a glorified popularity contest where the parties just go all over the country doing everything they can to gain the people's favor regardless of actually being good or not.<br>A lot of them might not even write their own speeches.<br>Anyone with enough charisma could win and become leader by just telling the people what they want to hear while backing it up with bullshit even the lowest denominator could understand or at least empathize.<br>The problem with democracy is that no one can undo the clusterfuck of shit left behind by the previous leader in four years, which in itself was past down by the previous previous leader, WHICH in turn was passed down by the previous previous PREVIOUS leader.<br>Every election is well meaningful promises, then when your ass gets elected you spend the next four years trying to unto the decades old messes and have no time or way to actually punch in those promises.<br>Rinse and repeat for the next dumb schmuck that wants a turn.<br>The fall of monarchy was a terrible mistake.<br>Sure there was that asshole king that would pop up in some generation down the line, but I'd be more at ease having a dude literally born and bred for politics be a leader than a college drop out that thought "gee why not?" <br><br>Also every girl is best girl in this show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, she's cute as fuck tbh</br>  <br>3D Japs are also shit, though. Personality is shit tier too.</br>  <br> I have genuinely not been this surprised at an anime for years. <br>Anon, is this sarcasm? I just have to ask because I kinda expected him to turn her down in that way. As an example the whole baseball player focusing on training and turning down cute girls had me see this coming a mile away.</br></br>  I watched both seasons of Free just for Gou.<br><br>I think you can handle it.</br></br>  <br> Also every girl is best girl in this show. <br>That's what a communist would say.</br></br>  <br>Do you have a mental illness? Is this supposed to be b8?</br>  <br>I was watching some jap porn the other day and I couldn't take my eyes of the girl's black hair.</br>  <br>Is there something wrong with not liking 3D women?</br>  <br>He didn't turn her down though. He didn't say he would answer after the election, he said he would accept her feelings then.</br>  <br>Not that guy, but the idea that you could even put a blanket statement so wide onto an entire race of people that has nothing to do with cultural standards or genetic tendencies is a little strange.</br>  <br>Why not, we put a blanket statement on an entire dimension around here. Casual racism be small time.</br>  <br> not voting for the one that can see the future meaning he could literally always make the best possible decision </br>  <br>Whoa there, it isn't a race thing. I don't like any 3D women. Hell, you can even add males and all animals to the list, too.</br>  <br>Why everyone doesn't vote for the loli, I'd never understand. If all of our world leaders were lolis then we'd already have world peace.</br>  <br>Right anon. You just don't like real women.

Who was that fucker with the limp and the dumb look on his face?</br>  <br> show is complete shit <br>fight me you little fag.</br></br>  <br> NINE best girls and boys <br> Implying. <br> I see you forgot to count the all the Misaki clones </br></br></br>  You will never get to tell Akane there's a  camera  in her closet  I think I'd rather listen to 20 minutes of Akane's VA saying Camera than watch this every week  I do that all the time whenever there is a super cute girl. Whenever the cute girl shows up, it motivates me to keep watching no matter what. That's what got me through Tari Tari.  I think this is the first anime I've seen where the truck driver got out of his vehicle.  I wanna see Hikari naked.<br><br>NAKED</br></br>  <br>L O L I C O N<br>O L I C O N<br>L I C O N<br>I C O N<br>C O N<br>O N<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is rare.

My reaction this episode   <br>Good work.</br>  Why did she build such a big wall though?  <br>Small walls can't satisfy anyone, anon</br>  <br>She'll be a Idoru from next ep.<br><br><br>She just wanted something to say her imouto and didn't give much thought to size or price...</br></br></br></br>  Why am I getting incest vibes after the end of episode 2?  <br>You didn't get them in this first episode when a girl was groped by one brother and had her skirt teleported miles away by another?</br>  <br>It's been a week since I saw it, and I'm drunk.<br><br>But Akane getting jealous over her brother was kinda kinky tbh</br></br></br>  <br>Because you're a pervert.</br>  <br>I dropped it because incest is uncomfortable as it hits too close to home for me</br>  <br>Damn, sounds heavy anon.</br>  <br> it hits too close to home for me <br>Rednecks detected.</br></br>  Dumping the 4 pages I did yesterday out of boredom.

What is this?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's literally just torn. Last ep was released the same day as Funi.</br>  <br>It's a Funi edit so 4-5 days after the Japanese broadcast.</br>  <br><br>I'll stick to doki then, they have been pretty nice for this.</br></br>  <br>He claims to have the better sub, though.</br>  <br>How do you manage the brain function to be able to breathe with all the stupid?</br>  <br>Try googling for a brain first or a working pair of eyes</br>  They say perfection doesn't exist.<br><br>I think I found it.</br></br>  <br>She's cute but not perfect.<br><br>Would be perfect if she wasn't so extremely shy and afraid of her own shadow</br></br></br>  <br> implying that isn't what makes her cute </br>  <br>A bit of shyness and getting embarrassed is super cute<br><br>Being afraid of your own shadow and going to extremes so you dont stand out while being voiced by hanakana ruins her perfect looks</br></br></br>  <br>I'll say that several lines from Funi's subs were innacurate when I watched ep 2.</br>  <br> Funi is garbage <br>Well no shit</br></br>  <br>comparison where</br>  <br>Doesn't quite understand the last two frames. So Shuu actually joins Kana just because it's Kana?</br>  <br>They're usually a bit more reliable subs-wise compared to Commie but it was noticeably off this week. <br><br><br>Not at home. Maybe I'll go through it again to see what stuck out tonight.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They're usually a bit more reliable subs-wise compared to Commie <br>Please kill yourself<br><br>At least you wear a trip so everyone can filter your retardation</br></br></br></br>  <br> Doki <br>2/10 you got me to reply</br></br>  <br> Funi <br>0/10<br>Enjoy eating shit</br></br></br>  <br> Funi <br> reliable <br>You must be high or just outright retarded.<br><br>I'll any time take a meme or two in my subs over the utter translation nightmare garbage that Funi or Daisuki subs are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;the kingdom gets to democratically vote for their king (how the fucks does that even work?) <br>en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elective_mona<wbr>rchy</wbr></br></br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br> &gt;show is complete shit <br><br>Your taste is complete shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Based on my own experiences Funisubs trigger my translator senses much less frequently than Commie's do. Both are just as likely to misinterpret lines but Commie's the only one of the two that offends with their overly liberal translations with no regard for characterization and context.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  I can't believe that small mom is everyone's mom.<br><br>Immersion ruined.</br></br>  wow the second episode felt really comfy, much better than the clusterfuck of episode 1, I'm glad I didn't drop it.  <br>Thank you sir.</br>  <br>That exposition game in ep 1 is the most annoying shit ever.</br>  <br>These pages don't match up with any of the raws I found. Is this from volume 3 or did you scan the magazine?</br>  Waiting for incest.    <br> responding to commie devs </br>  <br>UGUU HANA FOREVER</br>  <br>SASUGA ONIISAMA</br>  <br>I guess you'll be waiting indefinitely.</br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br><br>Aren't the pink twins kinda in weird terms, though?</br></br>  <br>This is what I was waiting for.<br><br><br>Implying I want to ruin OTP.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him, but I'm an impoverished wageslave and a hater, so I don't like watching a bunch of rich, well-to-do characters doing stuff if there's no kind of real conflict or tension.</br></br>  <br>You should learn to self-insert. In my experience, it's easiest to insert as the girl, imagining you're being held in Shu's strong arms and welcomed into a big fun home by a loving future mother-in-law. The pain can go away entirely until the next episode preview is over.</br>  <br>I can't control who I self insert as so I tend to get really depressed</br>  <br>I want to film a porno with Akane.</br>  <br>This tbh<br><br>I'm pretty sure "afraid of cameras" is my new fetish of the month</br></br></br>  <br>Does she know about it from the start or is it better to have hidden cameras be revealed mid dicking so they can capture a new level of moembarrassment?</br>  <br>Fuck you. Cameras have only pure and innocent surveillance purposes.</br>  <br>*cuntry</br>  <br>Damn, I've never seen a girl with simple yet straightforward personality who had guts to confess in her debut. I'm impressed, but I still slightly prefer Kanade though.</br>  <br>I want to see her get desperate for his attention.</br>  <br>Not even the best sister, you fucking pleb.</br>  <br>Don't worry, Anon. I feel the same way. Also, for Shiori, as She's just too cute.</br>  <br>fuck im the same. They are super beautiful, they have nice clothes, their worries are totally different than the commonfolk, they have money<br><br>I hate them</br></br></br>  <br>Good. Twincest is even better than incest.</br>  I've heard things going both ways. Is there yuri in this or not. I saw a manga page where one girl kisses another girl on the cheek when she was sleeping. But I don't know if that actually leads to anything.<br><br>So, my question is, is there actual requited yuri in the series? Maybe a side couple or something. Because I see it tagged as "Shoujo Ai" and manga updates. And leaving side how wrong the term "shoujo ai" is they are notoriously wrong on that site.</br></br>  <br>Sasuga, yurifag.</br>  <br>Was there really even a point for you to reply with such meaningless post?</br>  <br>Shiori kisses Akane when she's sick and it makes her feel better.<br>Akane kisses Akane when she's sick and it makes her feel worse.</br></br>  <br><br>I can't even self insert into games with custom creation, let alone a character with an established personality and backstory.</br></br>  <br>not reading manga or Ln it is way faster and less painful</br>  <br>The point is that you should fuck off back to /u/, you fucking cancer.</br>  <br>this if you can't do it for her you might as well give up</br>  <br> the first prince is a hard-working, stable man well respected by all with ideas for the future <br>Shu has zero interest in becoming King, doesn't work towards that goal at all and only motivation is to sabotage Kanade so she doesn't become king.</br></br>  Who else is enjoying the show? Probably one of my favourites this season with how relaxed it is. I want to see more of their powers though. Having another game would be fun, hopefully with less exposition dumping though.<br><br><br> replying to an 11 hour old posts of some idiot taking this shit way too seriously <br>Anon please</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Queen would be 女王(jo-ou), although it might have king's wife connotation.</br></br>  <br>Doing God's work anon.<br><br>Shuu best shoe and boy confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>I miss this MC.</br>  <br>I hope that tomboy appears more</br>  New episode in a few hours.  <br>Is this your fetish</br>  <br>subs Monday ;_;</br>  <br> For cum and country! <br>Can't wait</br></br>  Side question, wasn't the super powers proof of being royalty?<br><br>If so why does some random jackoff have a teleport power?</br></br>  Okay, about Hikari's power, God Hand.<br>Isn't it dangerous?<br>Think about it, she has complete control of life with her touch.<br>What if she decided to age you 1000 years, making you turn into skeleton dust? Or what if she made you so young you'd go passed fetus to non conception and cease to exist?<br>Would you stay dead/nonexistent after 24 hours or would turn back/pop back into existence again?</br></br></br></br>  <br>wat</br>  <br><br>Life is full of dangerous things. Even if she can kill you, it's not that hard for people to die.</br></br>  <br>That would be pretty neat. Ask her to age you do death so you can experience death and then pop back into existence and talk about what it was like.</br>  <br>I think you pop back into existance again because it works more like a reset than a shed enhancements.Like the tree must've just shrank out of nowhere instead of all the excess bark and leaves coming off.</br>  <br>Yeah but the tree was still "alive"<br>If its dead can it really turn back after the 24 hour mark?<br>Could she temporarily bring people back from the dead?</br></br></br>  <br>Torn's doing it. All the typesetting is {\an8} though.</br>  <br>I guess that if she puts you on the brink of death via her powers and you die of japanese cold, then you stay dead because it wasn't her powers that killed you.</br>  Akane in proper twintails made my dick perpetually hard  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Which chapter is this?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tom <br>Who?</br></br>  wasnt there a movie with a big family  <br>tomboys are best fetish</br>  <br>Ron.<br><br>Avoid.</br></br></br>    <br>Actually, it seemed the royalty's superpowers is a well-known fact in this universe, right?</br>  15 mins  <br>The shitty "wannabe based Onii-sama's gf" girl is pretty much the only thing ruining the enjoyment of this series for me. <br>Why can't we just have the family shenanigans happen and leave out the common pleb?</br></br>  <br>It does not sound way more dangerous than having a gun.

It needs a change of author. Shuu once transports away her skirt accidentally, and there's another chapter where she came to school skirtless purely due to bad luck.</br>  <br>I bet Shu does it on purpose</br>  <br>I've been on that boat for over a decade.<br>It's been rough.</br></br>  <br><br>At least this show is a comedy.</br></br>  <br>Nice victim blaming you baka hentai.</br>   show obsesses about the idea of panties showing <br> doesn't show panties <br><br>literal waste of time</br></br></br>  <br>She wouldn't become king that way.</br>    <br>Of course the japanese wouldn't want based onii-sama to be king, gotta go with twin tails and shy. it's a lot less threatening to the manchildren out there. and it gives them a waifu. Personally i'd watch the show if it was just about based onii-sama.</br>  <br><br>Well, or an onee-chan that can Geass. But this doesn't change the fact that most of the voting population are old geezers?</br></br>   constantly surrounded by all these semen demons   Can someone with such sever agoraphobia be described as shy?    I think Hikari accidentally used her magic on me and made part of me larger. Strangely it didn't last 24 hours.  <br>I highly doubt it.</br>  <br> the king is tall, broad, and handsome <br><br>My goodness, no wonder the queen was fine with having 9 kids despite being half his size.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He doesn't want Kanade to be the next King. How would he do that? It doesn't seem like he want's to be king, so not by becoming king himself. Rather, he would raise the popularity of the the person behind her in polarity to king.</br></br>  <br>  the person behind her in popularity to king. <br>Either Aoi (#1) or Akane (#2).  At the end of Volume 1, Akane rises to #1. </br></br>   (((( ;°Д°)))) <br> /ai/ - Idle Activities </br>  The guide: http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6  First in passion, you say?  <br>First in something.</br>  I need to catch up with Aikatsu has anything cool happened?  <br>Just Miyabi becoming best girl.</br>    Official PP stamps to commemorate the 1 year anniversary.<br>Can't imagine what you would use them for.</br>  <br><br>That part was adorable, she really looks like she's enjoying herself</br></br>      <br>units and everyone being cute</br>  <br>see <br>In short, this is a thread (read: general) for all shows and things with a target demographic of little girls.</br></br>    I miss Aikatsu so I think I'm going to have to pick it back up later today.  bump <br><br>I'm currently on episode 137.</br></br>   Boring episode. I don't like the Jalapeños at all. <br>And yet again they made Juri wear something that doesn't suit her.<br><br>This thing was cute though.</br></br></br>  Ah a newspaper dress.  I want to fuck Lala.  <br>Me too dude.</br>  <br>Stamp Lala's face on my cheek</br>  <br>God damn, Pink is so sexy.</br>  <br>Shion is very pretty.</br>    <br>pretty dead</br>  <br>Long haired Shion was great.<br> Short hair still cute. </br></br>  <br> loli Shion <br>I had completely forgotten.</br></br>  <br>Why, thank you.</br>  <br> candlejack jokes </br>    Feels like it might be about time for the plot to kick in now. I'll have to start avoiding posting spoilers.    <br>I wanna fuck this little faggot.</br>    How many people watch Aikatsu raw and how many wait for subs? It kind of feels like half and half so there's hardly ever a big discussion of anything.  <br>Since it airs at 5am my time, and Mezashite usually gets subs out within 3-5 days, I usually wait and watch it subbed.</br>  <br>I watch subbed, but sometimes I end up letting episodes stack up for a few weeks before I catch up.</br>  <br>I used to try to catch the livestream and download the .ts if I missed it but I lost my cap source so I just waited for subs since they're out in a reasonable timeframe. I refuse to watch Ohys and there's no decent raw groups for Aikatsu so the Mezashite encode is the only way.<br>I say used to because at some point (ep 133 judging by my text file) I got too pissed of by Madoka so I stopped watching and considered dropping Aikatsu altogether, but I'll catch up some day soon probably.<br>If I do end up dropping it that means no more BDs bought by me, but since another person on /ai/ has buying/uploading covered for now it's not the end of the world.<br>Now why the fuck did I write so much... I'll get back to finishing JPMC 02 now I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you have against Madoka?</br>  <br>Weird, I haven't seen anyone complain about Madoka since before she even joined the shows. A certain group of people thought she would be boring  and were then BTFO , but then she turned out to be a fun, honest, teasing little devil that loves her Akari-senpai.</br>  <br><br>I honestly can't remember exactly what I had against her as this was 2 months ago, but she ticked me off for some reason and made it not fun to watch Aikatsu!, which is a terrible thing to do.<br>I'll give it a try again soon and it will probably be resolved as she's probably not going to tick me off again.<br> I might've been under quite a bit of stress at the time and my mental well-being is always shaky when that happens especially now that I'm not taking antidepressants any more. </br></br></br></br>  <br>133 was when Madoka first showed some real weakness, and had to overcome her fear and face her grandmother to get a premium dress. I guess only you can know why you didn't like it.</br>  <br>I'll rewatch 133 right now to see if I was just really fucked up at the time.</br>  Behead those who insult Madoka.  <br> implying that I didn't dropped it already   sometimes I wonder why I still hang around </br>  <br>I haven't watched since halfway through S2, but I still keep up with the music and performances  because I honestly believe Aikatsu has the best music out of idol anime and love the CG. </br>  <br><br>What the hell are you doing guys, Aikatsu is better than ever right now.</br></br>  Why is Akari so  insane ?  <br>Me three.</br>  <br>You might like her this time around. I personally found her to be quite endearing in 133.</br>  <br>I don't have the motivation, I'm over 60 episodes behind at this point.</br>  <br><br><br>Okay rewatched it and it was fine, not entirely sold on Madoka but wasn't as terrible as I thought at the time at least.<br>I guess I'll catch up till 141 tonight since I have the time anyway.<br> Given that my mental health affected my enjoyment this much it does mean that I care a lot about Aikatsu! since other shows weren't affected this much. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what the hell are you doing <br>Waiting for Banruse to stop being assholes</br></br>  <br> You don't have time until you finish working on MC </br>  <br>Is that a panty shot?</br>  <br> It's why I said tonight okay, it's only 17:10 here... </br>  <br>It needs 100% more Ichigo though.</br>  <br>what should I make mine say? I'm thinking just かしこまっ! but maybe it would be better as a lewder message</br>  Ded Pirates    NOW IT FLIES TOO?<br>This fucking skateboard...<br><br> she really is </br></br></br>    <br>Raw, Aikatsu is the only show I care enough about to watch the livestream  despite having to stay up until 3AM for it. </br>  <br>Hinaki and Sumire go away.</br>  Can I just skip the second season of Aikatsu  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You'll miss a lot of good stuff, including Akari's introduction.</br>  <br>No. Did you even try? It's certainly better when you don't have to wait weekly. There are some good episodes in the first half, and the second half is required viewing if you want to watch S3 and the movie.</br>  I think I'll keep this for future use  <br>But he would be spared of the dreadful DreAcas stealing screentime, auditions, and constellation dresses from the superior girls.</br>  <br><br>It isn't THAT bad but it is a bit boring compared to the first season. You'd need to see Akari's episodes at least, and I think the season gets a little better once they stop doing the whole tie thing - around when Mizuki makes her return and introduces her partner.<br><br>Your enjoyment/tolerance of Season 2 would probably depend on which of the Dream Academy girls you like. If you like Kii, you're in luck. If you like Maria, however, you're SoL. And I don't mean slice of life.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you like Maria <br>There is anybody besides the little "I also want to be a princess" Japanese girls, who actually like Maria?</br></br>  <br>I like Maria. She's not close to my favourite or anything, but there's no reason to dislike her.</br>  <br>There's no reason to have any opinion on her. She may as well not exist.</br>  <br>That's kind of a negative and pointless opinion. She's there so that viewers can enjoy her, and in-universe she wants to be an idol and just so happens to be good at it. Thinking about it, she's kind of a perfected Fuwari, being an outdoors lighthearted girl but also a princess.</br>  <br>She literally did NOTHING, and had everybody else do stuff for her, while she was busy being cute.<br>Literally Maria Sue. And I don't like the way she got her constellation dress either.</br></br>  <br>It's fun when you take exactly the same screenshots I did.</br>  <br>Those three were really fucking cute.</br>    <br>Somebody set us up the bomb.</br>  <br>I think I've experienced too much Plutia... now I kinda wanna go bully those cut innocent little girls.</br>   you came to the wrong neighborhood puri   <br>It's less the bikini and more the style. Dorothy's is really racy for a 13-year-old and she's posed like a slut. Shion's would probably be okay if they didn't choose the absolute lewdest wrap thing configuration to make it look like she's wearing nothing at all underneath.</br>  <br>I agree with the little girls. This kind of stuff should be left to fanartists.</br>    Alright I just hit the end of the third cour of kira deco. Only 13 episodes left. I'll finish it off tomorrow. Probably.   Spanish and Mexican Cuisine has a deep connection. <br><br>1. A Spaniard is saying that.<br>2. ANYONE is surprised by that.<br><br>The tortilla factoid was pretty interesting though.</br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=knz<wbr>UzruxDG0</wbr>  [ ]  <br> So  from  now  on  we're   Prizmmy </br>  <br>EVERY fucking time.</br>  <br>Reina still sounds like the most feminine one.</br>  <br>I don't even know how I messed up those spoilers. Oh well.</br>  <br>I've done the same thing  with the exact same quote  before. I think it doesn't like it when there are no spaces between the tags.</br>  ALIVE    <br>The red-eyed demon is so beautiful.</br>  What are they watching? It looks lewd, going by their faces.  <br>They're watching Skips, you can see it.</br>  <br>Yes, exactly what he said. Skips is lewd.</br>    Is there a stitch of Hinaki doing Juri's thing?  Passion Jalapeno are fucking gay.   <br>Oh, Mizuki has taken up Gardening? I wonder how she's doing in the Second Banana Independent Aikatsu business.</br>  <br>I think that's taken from an old poster.</br>  The one on the left looks like Wakana.  It really feels like some egg manufacturers have bought into Aikatsu. They've changed it so that little girls will remember to buy eggs in future.<br><br>Long-term marketing strategies like this must be risky.</br></br>  This was alright. Do Juri and Hinaki have the most songs of all the units this season? Three that they've performed together so far. <br><br>And with the next episode preview: will this mean that Yuu is coming back? Kokone has already stayed for several weeks longer than she was supposed to. And Miyabi is just hanging around.</br></br>  <br>Where's Mikuru?</br>  Miyabi a cute.<br>A CUTE</br>  <br>Putting the last touches on the garden I presume?</br>    <br>Who left that kiss mark?</br>      puri  So I said I would catch up to Aikatsu, so I'm working on that.<br>134 - Okay I might've had a wrong idea about Madoka that was somehow amplified the wrong way in 133 causing me to stop watching altogether... I actually like her now after watching this episode I guess.<br>135 - For this new character we took a squirrel and modelled a human after it... And it actually worked I guess.</br></br>  <br>I'd pop-step-get her pregnant.</br>  <br>squirrels are cute shit dude</br>    <br>Rude.</br>    <br>136 - The return of Miyabi, still one of the cutest idles around. <br>I'm guessing nobody redid this stitch yet (haven't bothered checking the last 4 weeks of threads), so I'll be doing that when I get my BDs in a few days (and I guess that also includes the 2 Ran stitches from 125).<br><br><br>They sure are.<br><br>I really like squirrels okay, it wasn't my intention to sound rude...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have that UR.</br>  <br>We can be choco squirrel buddies</br>  Stop saying gracias.  <br>Siento, tsumari gomen.</br>  <br> SkipS goes up against the best duos <br> Goes commando <br> Wins <br><br>Passion Japapeno should have gone bottomless to compete.</br></br></br></br></br>    Akari thighs.   Won by half a percentage point <br> Clear leader of the pack <br><br>THE FIX IS IN</br></br></br>  <br> They were the leaders/on top <br> It was clear from the points <br>Yes, and?</br></br></br>  <br>Must lick.</br>    ded    <br>Well I caught up so here's some thoughts I wrote down in my notebook... Why do I even bother...<br>137 - It sure would suck if holding my breath didn't work to solve hiccups since it's probably the most convenient method.<br>It looked like she might not have held it for long enough though, perseverance is important.<br><br>138 - Well this rating system makes about as much sense as fan calls in DMF so I'm not sure how accurate it is (the small difference they needed to win might not be significant enough).<br>Overall I think the execution of this unit cup was nice, limiting to 2 performances/ep and having backstage shenanigans makes for a nice format.<br>I don't really have much of an opinion on the results, but they were okay I guess.<br><br>139 - MISUNDERSTANDINGS, oh well Johnny was cute as hell and the OTP of Bepp x Gakuen Mother seems to be accurate.<br>Also hey Dreaca exists and I don't mind seeing Seira any more so that's an improvement.<br>And that was a cute scene with Sena and Akari.<br>Song was nice too, I usually like it when it's not generic idol stuff.<br>Also I guess Miyabi is still around for now.<br><br>140 - Play episode, not much to write about, but well executed.<br>I liked the cuts to the audience with Johnny theories.<br>Also I'd just like to add that Miyabi was once again the cutest, but that's not much of a competition when she's around.<br><br>141 - Lol Aikatsu 8. Nice slightly terrifying mascot character.<br>It's good to see Hinaki doing more things I guess.<br>And I guess they're keeping Miyabi around until Kokone leaves? I don't remember if they actually mentioned the duration of her stay at some point.<br><br>Anyway with that I'm caught up and I can once again state that it's one of the more enjoyable shows I watch, I was wrong to consider dropping it after 133.<br><br>tl;dr: Johnny was cute, but Miyabi was the cutest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        dedXded  <br>Kyupikon!</br>    /ai/ needs something to give it some life  Miyutan!  <br>What the...how do I make MPC make screenshots the right resolution?</br>  <br>Miyu and Himika do things to my pripara.</br>  <br>Don't use anamorphic video or use mpv.<br><br>I don't think there is a way for MPC to play nice with anamorphic video.</br></br></br>      <br>Rainbow Live: After Story</br>  <br>I want to fuck Mirei.</br>    <br>Rainbow Live: Dear My Future</br>    It's all downhill from here.

They could contain anything and vary by sheet amounts, but they are packs of setting information sent to various places. Looks like there are two Aikatsu (アイカツ) ones each with 116 sheets up at the moment.<br><br>Mine in particular (240ish sheets) has to mainly do with the 12th episode of the 2nd season plus some other general stuff it seems.</br></br></br>  <br>So all of the cans are from a single episode? I didn't think there would be so much.</br>  <br>Yup. Well, there are plenty of things for an animator to reference.</br>  <br>LONDON<br> We don't care, as long as you shut the fuck up about it </br></br>  <br>P</br>          And for now, I'll leave you with possibly the most significant reference scan I own.  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>Thanks. Have some of an Akari.</br>  We need to go lolier.  <br>Nah, Sena is more of a school swimsuit guy.</br>    <br>is that what happened to the headband then?</br>  <br>Why is there so much amputee Akari art? Stop amputating Akari.</br>  Isn't this actually a symptom of autism?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Studies have shown that literally everyone has autism. I'd take Akari over someone who can't focus long enough to wipe their own ass.</br>  <br>Honestly I have no idea. Several artists do it.<br><br><br>Her dad is autistic too.</br></br></br></br>  I think Akari's mom might be cuter than her.  <br>She doesn't seem to be sorting them by categories. I bet she's just imitating some other autistic kid she saw because it seemed like he was having fun. That's typical non-autist behavior.</br>  why  <br>Because of my dick.</br>  <br>One of the things about the autism spectrum is that it's very wide and pretty much everybody has some aspects of it.<br>Autism is usually only diagnosed if you suffer from those aspects you have.<br>Note that this is way too simplified and you should take this with a grain of salt as I'm by no means an expert.  Just someone that was said not to be autistic (without proper testing), only to be diagnosed anyway a few years later. </br></br></br>  <br>Hair-down Juri is gracias.</br>  <br>Not possible. Akari's mom is cute, but Akari is the cutest girl in the whole multiverse.</br>   vampire butt   <br><br>Anyway got a good crop of Akari's reaction there?</br></br>  <br><br>Oh wait never mind, someone already posted it. That's what I get for not scrolling up.</br></br>  <br>She should stop being so cute. It's not fair on the other idles.</br>    <br>RIP Ayumi.</br>      Aroma's outfit got a batman recolor.  <br>That's an incredibly ugly coord, even by PP standards.</br>  <br>Why are the dresses in Pripara so awful?</br>  <br>Probably because they weren't made to appeal to you.</br>  <br>I mean, even considering it's for young girls.</br>  <br>Yes. Paca.</br>  <br><br>Bottom right looks exactly like Usagi Tsukino, but with pigtails instead of odango. <br><br> mfw thats what Crystal could have looked like </br></br></br></br>  I like Fuwari's bird.  <br> Ajimi <br>Okay, so she's taste. So we've got:<br><br>Aroma : Scent<br>Mikan : Sight<br>Fuwari : Touch<br>Hibiki : Sound<br>Ajimi : Taste<br><br>People were thinking that Mikan was "taste" for obvious reasons, but when you think about it, you've got 見 and 観.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, where the fuck did all of this come from? Is this a thing?

I honestly had to stop and walk away when I got to this part. Even now, it still pisses me off.</br>  <br>oh come on OP<br><br>it's a SEOOOOO manga. if you were reading that expecting anything but MC being a wishy-washy whinny asexual indecisive beta fagot, who strings along women, then changes his mind because another girl is crying, while best girls get run over by trucks, or dumped by the peice of shit MC in favor of awful selfish bitches, then you went into a SEOOOOO manga with the wrong expectations.</br></br></br>    <br>you just had to stab and twist that dagger didn't you?<br><br>fuck<br><br>you know i think this story arc made me dislike her so much it sorta ruined the rest of the manga as i simply couldn't get over my displeasure for that bitch. Zen could have done so much better with ANYONE else. There were so many best girls in this series.</br></br></br></br></br>          <br> whats the context <br>Main heroine stops giving shit about main dude since he's ordinary and can't do shit right and gets forgotten like in pic which like a punch in the gut since anons can self insert</br></br>        <br>I don't have it, but the last few pages of Rotte no Omocha pissed me off.<br><br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking remember what I feel when I read this.<br> Fuuka is best girl <br> MC is not being an indecisive bitch <br> MC and best girl are honest about what they feel <br> No misunderstandings <br> No "All aboard the rage train" <br> Happy and comfy relationship <br> Let's kill the main girl <br>Shit, I know that things would be stalled if that continued, but it still hurt like hell. Fucking Seo. This was your best ruse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont see how this is infuriating to so many, this is how you properly shatter an ideal.</br>  <br>How did that end?

My bet is on  NEVER EVER.   Well, now that the Yui filler is finally over what happens next?  <br>it's just shading anon.</br>  <br>No, that's definitely not shading.

As soon as Marika gets dumped shit will hit the fan.   there's actual spoilers for nisekoi now <br><br>wow</br></br>  Reminder.  <br>nah. She explained to Raku that all forms of love of love are real. USED THE WORDS FALSE LOVE. Possibly enabling him to accept his feelings for Chitoge.</br>  <br>Pure idiocy. Senjogahara was chosen by the fucking end of the first arc.</br>  Goddamn this fucking bullshit going the Toradora route. Onodera bestgirl4life. Shitoge a shit.  is she gonna kill him?  <br>Onodera is not even best Onodera.</br>  <br>You do know Nekomonogatari happened chronologically before Bakemonogatari and Crab. He even had this "is this shit love or lust?" part in it, and contemplated on marrying Cat.<br><br>You probably didn't even watch beyond Bakemonogatari.  I understand, both series are shit harem series anyway. </br></br></br>  <br> You do know Nekomonogatari happened chronologically before Bakemonogatari and Crab <br>Doesn't matter, as Nekomonogatari is not the first arc.<br><br>No one would be reading Nisekoi if the first arc was him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened.</br></br></br></br>   there are actually people who think someone will win this in the next five years <br><br>Author's gonna milk this cash cow as long as he can by last-second asspulling reasons why nobody can win the Rakubowl, over and over, like he always has.</br></br>    <br> Doesn't matter, as Nekomonogatari is not the first arc. <br>Actually, it's the second arc, just after Kizu and before Bake. Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes.<br><br> No one would be reading Nisekoi if the first arc was him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened. <br>Not the point of the screencapped post though.<br><br>Kosaki was choronologically first girl, just like Cat. Chitoge was the first girl in the first season, just like Senjougahara.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually, it's the second arc, just after Kizu and before Bake. Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes. <br><br>But /a/non, the novel order it´s the same.<br>Nisio wrote first Bake &gt; Kizu &gt; Neko</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually is Bake &gt; Kizu &gt; Nise &gt; Neko</br>  People discussing other series, that's how bad Nisekoi is. Not even in a Nisekoi thread people want to talk about Nisekoi.  <br><br>Chronologically. That means the whole Cat arc happened before Senjougahara even appeared. It's the same thing with Kosaki. She was in the Rakubowl way before Chitoge appeared.<br><br>It's not about the what Nisio wrote first or what the anime adapted first, it's all about the story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is you said "It´s the first season that aired, yes" <br>Implying that the novel order is different and it´s not.</br></br>  <br> Stop saying Bake is the first arc. It's the first season that aired, yes. <br>It is the first arc, you dumb fuck. It was the first LN too.<br><br><br> Kosaki was choronologically first girl, just like Cat.

It was the first LN too. <br>Oh yeah, it is. My bad.<br> Yes, chronologically it is similar, but arc-wise it is not. <br>It's settled then. This would've been alot shorter if you just told me this from the beginning, sheesh. Still not sure why you're so mad over this, seeing I've been repeating "chronologically" all this time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Autism.   raku giving a response in the same chapter <br>Holy shit color me surprised. And here I was expecting Komi to somehow handwave this plot and bring it up again in 100 chapters.<br><br>Especially when raku went<br> WHAT THE HELL IS THIS <br>I kind of expected him not to recognice the confession as a confession despite Yui basically screaming that she wants his babies.</br></br></br></br></br>  My favorite picture of Onodera  <br> I kind of expected him not to recognice the confession as a confession <br>And he didn't. She had to repeat herself.</br></br>  WHEN WILL I BE FREE FROM THIS CURSE KNOWN AS NISEKOI???<br><br>I CAN'T FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE!!!!!!</br></br>  Why the fuck do I enjoy reading this shit so much? Like I adore these characters but there is literally 0 plot advancement, yet this has taken the spot of my 2nd favorite manga. It just makes me so happy. Am I autistic?  I like Tsugumi's boobs.  <br><br>Nothing wrong with enjoying things, dude.</br></br>   fade to black <br><br>They fucked didn't they?</br></br>   178 chapters <br><br>You could have fully read several great mangos in that time. Think about that for a little while.</br></br>  <br> I adore these characters. <br>Well there's your answer.<br><br>Nothing wrong there. These are top tier girls for the most part.</br></br></br></br>  Holy fucking shit this chapter, JUST FUCKING FUCK THE BLONDE BITCH AND END THIS SERIES FAGGOT.  <br>He needs to set up a proper WA2 ending first</br>  Who cares if the plot moves or not?<br><br>Do you actually think it's a good plot?</br></br>  <br><br>No. I actually enjoy shitting on this manga more than I enjoy reading it.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like /a/</br>   f/a/ggots actually want this to end <br>I hope it continues forever. Make it a slice of life manga.</br>  d-don't mind me, just posting best girl!  <br>Losers not allowed.</br>  <br> Make it a slice of life manga. <br><br>Wait, it isn't?</br></br></br>  <br>So adorable. I literally got into Nisekoi because I got a postcard from my weeb sister with Chitoge, Raku, and Onodera on it and thought she looked so cute.</br>  <br> weeb sister <br><br>Did you fuck her?</br></br></br>  <br>it's clearly a adventure seinen</br>  <br>No t yet </br>  <br>I want to make Yui reach her climax.</br>  <br>the mangaka is really talented. the way he frames and presents the story, and the way his characters are all likeable and fun. the overall plot doesn't really matter that much in these kinds of series, but it's by no means bad. characters develop slowly. the dramatic bits never weigh down the manga's fun overtone but still manage to make you care about the characters and feel a little suspense.<br><br>it's a good snack.</br></br></br>  <br>But why'd you post Chitoge?</br>  <br>You'd make a good dodgy car salesman</br>  <br>I've been reading this kind of shit since the first time I read Love Hina on a cjb site. Nisekoi is really good.</br>  So, the whole purpose of Yui-nee was making that faggot realise he likes Chitoge. Based Shuu helped a lot.  I'm so fucking glad RedHawk are the ones releasing Nisekoi. Imperial Scans did a shitty job.  I hope Komi Naoshi isn't a faggot and makes Y-san win the Marikabowl in the manga  <br>Y-San is the hero we don't deserve.</br>  <br>Y-san mai husbando</br>  <br>I knew it. The shitty fucking tsundere is gonna win. Fuck this shitty fucking predictable as fuck manga and fuck you Komi.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED.</br></br></br>  <br>But I'm a Tsugumifag.</br>  <br> the shitty tsundere <br>I know you're just fishing for replies, but what exactly is wrong with a Chitoge end? Especially with the improved Chitoge?</br></br>  <br>I agree with all of this but Komi's blueballing every time plot progression is hinted still rustles me.</br>  <br> Marika gets dumped <br> implying she won't get killed off in a way that makes even dense-as-fuck Raku realize the importance of letting people know your feelings before it's too late <br><br><br> him telling his grandchildren about when he and Chitoge were younger and all the antics that happened. <br>Ah yes, the hit TV show How I Met Your Grandmother<br><br><br>Stereotypical tsundere twin tails always wins, first girl always wins, people not liking how they made Chitoge so shitty of a tsundere in the beginning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't deserve it, she was abusive and still in denial about her feelings and she swooped in first chapter. <br>Meanwhile Onodera has been loving Raku since middle school, worked her ass off to get into the same high school and is honest with her feelings. Yes, there is the entire spaghetti bullshit that Raku shows too but that's mostly the author's shitty writing to delay the series until Chitoge wins. In all honesty, Onodera should have won by now. Raku was about to confess before the series started but again, harem trope bullshit stood in the way. <br><br>In all honesty, I'm sick of this series, we know how it's going to end, so just Komi, fucking end it now so I can close this stupid book and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Stereotypical tsundere twin tails always wins <br>Well, there's always Saekano...<br> first girl always wins <br>Nothing inherently wrong with that<br> people not liking how they made Chitoge so shitty of a tsundere in the beginning <br>Oh come on, that's ancient history. And if people are so concerned about development/progression to the point of exasperation when it doesn't happen in Nisekoi, why discount Chitoge's character growth? That just sounds inconsistent to me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128196943 <br> kosako </br>  <br>Several reasons. Get ready for some tl;dr.<br><br>1. It's so fucking predictable. It's always the first girl introduced that ends up winning in the end so all this bullshit drama is completely unnecessary and pads out this sorry excuse of a story.<br><br>2. Because modern tsunderes are all the fucking same. They start off as complete abusive and psychotic bitches that everyone fucking hates and finally when they start warming up dumbasses in the fanbase start liking her while smart people remember what an absolute fucking bitch they were. It's pathetic.<br><br>3. People who like tsunderes are absolute retarded faggots. Their excuse for liking tsunderes is "It feels like taming a lion." No it fucking doesn't. The MC ending up with a tsundere means that he got pussy-whipped.<br><br>4. Because modern tsunderes are all fucking horrible. We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night. Tsundere initially meant someone who's initially cold and even hostile towards another person before gradually showing their warm side over time (i.e. Rin). This change of behavior is permanent, and that's where the classic tsundere type is different form the modern tsundere). Today's tsunderes are those that switch between hostile (and sometimes even violent) and lovestruck personalities over and over again to the point of being schizophrenic (i.e. Shitoge). Guys don't find that attractive IRL. We find it fucking crazy and steer clear of that shit. Classic tsunderes I'm cool with. Modern tsunderes are complete psychobitches. <br><br>5. Because modern tsunderes win all the fucking time and I'm God damn sick of it.<br><br>There. Those are my reasons. Yes this is tl;dr, I don't give a shit. I'm mad. Fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   tfw you will read a chapter where kosaki gets rejected and suffers in this lifetime <br><br>JUST</br></br>  <br> Oh come on, that's ancient history. <br>People don't forget faggot. And IRL, first impressions are key to forming a relationship. If you meet a girl and here first instinct is to act like a total bitch to you, then you fucking walk away and find someone else. Chitoge is a fucking bitch.</br></br>  ONODERA IS GOING TO LOSE HAHAHA  <br>That'll likely not happen, I doubt it'll get that far.<br>We'll probably end with Raku realizing his feelings and confessing to Chitoge and that'll be the end. If anything, we'll see the reactions and everyone will be happy for them. The end, happily ever after.  It's stupid. </br></br>  <br> I've never interacted with anyone in real life ever: The Post </br>  <br> several reasons <br>Did you really type all of that just now? You basically say the same thing in reasons 2 and 4. 1 and 5 too. 3 is generalization. And does it really matter what she did in the past if it didn't have lasting negative consequences for anyone? MC likes her and cares about her, he isn't playing the fake love game anymore. She gets along with everyone. No one remembers or cares if she used to DK except fans like you.<br><br><br> And IRL, first impressions are key to forming a relationship <br>I think you missed the part in this manga where their relationship began as a reluctant arrangement for ceasefire between two mobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That never happened.</br>  <br>Well then enlighten me smartass. Have you ever met and formed a relationship with an IRL modern tsundere?</br>  I'm a Chitogefag but even I can feel the sorrow that will be the chapter where Onodera gets eliminated from the run.  <br>Yes I did type all that. Bare with me, I'm an angry drunk. I'm just fucking sick of tsunderes winning all the time.</br>  I dropped this shit 5 months ago<br><br>If there is any chance Tsugumi wins the bowl i'm reading it again<br><br>Should i?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lel, get fucked kosaki fag</br>  <br>Honestly I don't care who Raku ends up with. I just fucking hate Shitoge.</br>  <br> We haven't had a good tsundere since Tohsaka Rin from Fate/stay night.  <br><br>Stopped reading there gr8 b8 m8</br></br></br>  <br> IRL modern tsundere <br><br>I've formed a relationship with somebody that has grown on me, yes.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm just fucking sick of tsunderes winning all the time <br>Take a break from anime then and start reading manga. Good ones. There aren't many modern tsunderes, or any tsunderes for that matter, if you know which kinds to read. And go easy on the drink.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it, why not? I've had Vagabond on my backlog for a while now so I think I'll just read that. Sorry if I came off like an asshole.</br>  <br> Take a break from anime then and start reading manga. <br>But Nisekoi IS a manga...</br></br>  <br> Good ones. <br>C'mon Ralph, you're not THAT stupid.</br></br>  <br>Post a pic then faggot.</br>  <br>Name 10 good tsunderes then.</br>  New Teppu is out, for anyone who's interested.  <br>first for DEM ABS</br>  any render and clean version from this image  Yuri end confirmed.

Didn't shounen series teach you anything!?<br>Never give up or give in and always give your best possible.<br>Also letting witches do everything over you, have you no shame as a man? Plane squadrons can bait neurois into following them whilst coordinating a offensive with the witches on cleanup. You gotta think other purposes and strategies. Naval forces can do effective barrages and ground forces have their own toys that work on the smaller stuff.<br>Sure the real planes can't do much for the offensive on their own except maybe for the 75mm cannon planes which are impractical anyways.<br>And in the end you get to fly alongside the angels themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think some here would pretty much do anything to be in the SWverse.</br>  <br> wanting to die a shit death because you wanted to get close to a witch <br>It's like you don't know you can just stand on the sidelines and fap.</br></br>  <br>MEDIOCRE</br>  Bike, bike, as fast as you can<br>You can't get caught by the Magic God, man.<br><br>Chapter 2, 3/16 parts translated by js06:<br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_2</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe?

(laugh) "I like the fact that at the beginning she was a weakling, but due to Naruto's influence she steadily became strong." <br><br>  Kishimoto: "That's because Hinata doesn't stand at the main character's side like normal heroines*... she's the type that watches him from the shadows." <br><br>  Interviewer: "I thought the heroine was Sakura?" <br><br>  Kishimoto: "That's right. But Sakura is addicted to Sasuke." (laugh) "The reason why Hinata came to like Naruto is clear, but I've deliberately avoided writing down the reason why Sakura came to like Sasuke." (laugh) "That's because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And yet this how Sakurafags portay her.  <br>Why does she have an ass on her chest?</br>  <br>sorry that isn't very good</br>  <br> Her character literally revolves around Sasuke <br>And the sad part is that without Sasuke she's actually kinda alright. Compare her portrayal in The Last to the Gaiden and you'll see what I mean.</br></br>  <br><br>She probably just ripped out a puppies eyes,</br></br>  What has to be done to make Sakura more popular?  <br> But honestly what makes this poll less accurate than a poll that a very small amount of people voted? <br><br> Votes based on people that visit the cafe regularly only <br> All the Cafe votes tend to produce the same results each time in each location <br>How is that accurate/fairly represented?<br><br>The TM poll itself at least gives everyone and anyone the chance to vote versus those who go to the cafes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Even during the Heaven's Fall  <br>As you said, Rin (and saber) have appeared in a lot of stuff since 06 DEEN. Hell, Rin is a major contender to win Shirou in the so called "Illya route." Even in the HF movie, Rin plays a huge part, and I'm pretty sure receives even more screen time than Sakura. With all the fans prior to the announcement of the HF movies plus all the secondaries UBW anime brought in who circlejerk Rin like crazy, I don't see a chance of sakura surpassing Rin.</br>   HF will make Sakura surpass Rin <br>That never happens. THAT NEVER HAPPENS. <br>Also, Saber is fucking hopeless. The king of cucks will always sit on first place.</br></br>  <br>She has much more screen time than both of them,</br>   Precure thread   <br>I took it as a Gununu from both</br>  <br>¡ᴉʞʞnq ʇsǝq sᴉ ᴉʞʞnq uʍop-ǝpᴉsd∩</br>    <br>Now cut that out!</br>  <br><br>He actually does get development. <br><br>Towards the end of Dokkan and  the final episode </br></br></br></br>  Nagato's stern is very vulnerable.  Not sure why they replaced Ashigara with Kaga yesterday. <br><br>Maybe she gets something as well.</br></br>  <br>No that's and old drawing that was on the cover of something.</br>  <br>yes and?</br>  No translations today, but I did spend a while tinkering with ffmpeg.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>96971<br>DL of original: http://tinyurl com/ozblyrr</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>It's for promoting the dazzle camo version of her figure, but Shibafu was too lazy to repaint his original drawing so they had to do with the old one.</br></blockquote>]
