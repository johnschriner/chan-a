[ This is a series where everyone is butthurt.   daily reminder   Lelei a cute  <br> daily reminder that Orcs were framed by the perfidious Elves </br>  I wondered how many nationalistic nips jizzed themselves at this.  <br><br>Has there been an anime before that has rectally rustled Americans this much?</br></br>  <br>Not to my knowledge.</br>  <br>Japan is pretty wealthy, and even say Poland would look like a superpower next to the Empire.</br>  <br><br>Damn Elves and their false flagging.</br></br>  The OST is shit tbh lads.  <br>Wait what? Did this author honestly think this is true?</br>  <br>Who is this, I want to commit a crime?</br>  <br>Loli Pina</br>  <br>i don't agree and i don't see us reaching more of a commong point that where we are, besides i wanna go play CKII but i can't since im discussing this with you, so since we avanced so much let's admit here that we think differently and drop it, my stand on those is. I believe it has to be punishment as to create the fear of consequences on those that aren't naturally fit to live in society, redesigning prisons and creating facilities are an extra expense that may very well create more poverty increasing the crime i the long term, because it would be a damn huge expense, and a much larger constant drain of resources than what it is already, the next thing im about to say is a bit childish and i haven't given it as much thought as the rest since i just thought about it and right now i just turned 26 hours in a row without sleep, don't worry, i liked it, marathoned 2 shows in a row and finished a VN, i would just make much samllers cells but keep them individual and restrict their interactions in common spaces like when eating or exercising through permanent surveillance, ther are ther to be punished after all, it would be an increase in resources i the form of the extra surveillance but not as huge as the facilities suggested above, everything i said before this have been my thoughts on those matters since long ago, only the last part has been thought just now, if you want to keep going then just answer me, i'll probably end up tabing out every 5 seconds to check if i have an aswer since i always do that</br>    <br><br>Just wait until Rakudai.</br></br>  How's the adaptation so far? Faithful? How's the animation?  <br>What happened to the curvaceous bombshell redhead with the silly name? I was told she'd appear in this episode, but she was nowhere to be seen.</br>  <br><br>I'm enjoying the Anime but haven't read the manga, from what I've heard they change a lot of stuff.<br><br>Still pretty good if you haven't read the manga first though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i wanna put a baby into a little girl</br>  <br>Redhead, appeared, but she's not exactly a bombshell, we'll see how it goes once she strips off the armor.<br><br>Loli version was nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't it supposed to be an adaption of the LN anyway?</br>  <br>She's cute.</br>  You will never explore another world with your buddies.  Remember she has sex with monster girls whores  Does Japan really think it can go full isolationism if it has the Gate resources? America, Russia, China, Canada, Australia, etc are all rich in resources, but they still need trade. Plus resource extraction is no longer the cash cow it once was.  <br> chinese, russian and american agents milling about <br> find a black agent <br>It makes perfect sense. Could just buy american firearms, but who the fuck would train a monkey just to implicate the USA?</br></br></br>  <br>You done editing the pic?</br>  <br>She reminds me of AV-san from Amaburi.</br>  <br>Very poor, heavy censorship, redesigned characters and so far one extreme personality change.</br>  <br>Why didn't you let this die with the old thread?</br>  <br>Anime design is based on the novels not on the manga</br>  <br>Is that a bad thing? Because that would be exactly what I would be doing.</br>  <br>The USA really has fuckall trade. It's too big to really need it.</br>  <br> exactly what I would be doing. <br>Let's not kid ourselves anon. Unless you're a tall 3.14 qt with med skills you're not having lesbian sex with angel whores.</br></br>  <br>Well the visual design is worse for all but rory and chuka. And I don't like pina's new personality.</br>  <br><br>So the JSDF is where idols go after they become old hags?</br></br>  WTF? I though these went out of style after the Napoleonic wars, people don't still use this shit do they?  <br>The jews fund it.</br>  <br>When your enemies are even pre-middle ages, yes it makes sense.<br>What good would HESCOs be against swords?</br></br>  <br>I don't know who the fuck is who.<br><br>First panel from left to right, top to bottom<br> Furuta <br><br>Second Panel<br> Kurata <br><br>Third Panel<br> Tomita <br> Kuribayashi <br> Kurokawa <br><br>4th Panel<br> forgot that old man's name <br><br>5th and 6th are obvious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I though these went out of style after the Napoleonic wars, <br><br>Surprise surprise, locals haven't reached Napoleonic era yet.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to need a reference source for this. What chapter are we talking about exactly?</br>  <br>Star forts are better than anything the Empire has or has even seen, they are still using single wall square forts like Italica mind you.</br>  <br>Look at the harpy, you would fuck her like her clients?</br>  <br>Do you know what an 'arc of fire' and 'killing zone' is? That shape works well to funnel troops between two points for better killing.</br>  <br>It really could.<br>After dealing with the Empire, Japan could easily just cut itself off, and use the Gate world to their content, without interference.<br><br>That's assuming other countries don't get mad about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga why? They look cool.</br>  <br>And promise her a life of luxury beyond the gate without ever fulfilling it, yes.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Yeah but the Japanese military has, I would think there would be more effective modern military fort designs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still can't get over how dumb her name is.</br>  <br> Japan ceases all contact with the rest of the world <br> No more anime <br> no more manga <br> no more LN <br><br>THERE WOULD RIOTING IN THE STREETS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>When you have machine guns and mines, you really don't need to go to more expense than simple chain link fences, barbed wire, and manned guard towers. Maybe with dogs running between the fences too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lies and slander. This Idolmaster reject is pure as the snow that's been stepped on by the dirty winter boots of a married couple in love.</br>  <br>Akusho chapters have Kurokawa bonding with whores but no lesbian sex.</br>  <br>So every base should be a box then? You obviously have no idea of military architecture.</br>  <br>What good is simple chain link fences for storing your food and equipment from harsh outdoor weather? Tarps?</br>  <br>Japan would still give the US a slice of the pie, they already stated that the US which is already assuming it has a slice, is what keeps China and Russia from just marching into Japan outright. They say the current cold war type stalemate is preferable.<br><br><br>Star forts work wonders against people with spears and swords, it is also cheap to build.<br><br><br>Mines cost more money that a few walls, they also need the walls in case something like a dragon or similar large monster decides to bum rush them, chain link, barbed wire and guard towers, even mines do shit against large monsters.<br><br>Mines are bad, they have a large amount of trade and civilians running around.<br><br>They still have barbed wire, it's their first line of defense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>there is no proof Kurukawa is having sex with them.<br>She get along with them, especially with the angel but everything else is doujinshi plot material</br></br>  <br>Reminder that all Idolmaster rejects want to be dicked by an elite soldier, preferably with ranger training.</br>  <br>Besides the fact that everyone else including America would instantly pull another Commodore Perry and force Japan back open with the threat of shelling their capital.</br>  <br>she is the lewdest and most malicious JSDF named girl though</br>  <br><br>almost, just seeing what else I can add with the extra room I've got</br></br>  <br>She seems to get along well with just about everyone. She's just easy to get along with.</br>  <br>All anime women with Kuro in their names are all slutty and lewd.</br>   how am I going to pay for all these housing, clothes, and food? <br> well, I can just whore myself <br><br>Seriously, what's wrong with Tuka? I've always thought elf is an honorable race given the way they look</br></br></br>  <br>Except when that ranger is also SF, an otaku, and has a mage, an elf, a dark elf, and a goth loli demigoddess all trying to ride his dick.<br><br><br>She's young, stressed, and in a land where prostitution, rape, and slavery is the norm.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ARE YOU SAYING MY KURONEKO IS A SLUT AND LEWD?!<br><br>SHE IS A KAWAII KONEKO</br></br></br>  <br> the way they look <br>elves are clearly for sexual</br></br>  "In August of 20XX, a portal to a parallel world, known as the "Gate," suddenly appeared <br>the JGSDF dispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team<br>Youji Itami, a JSDF officer as well as a 33-year-old otaku, was appointed as the leader of the Team"<br><br>Why would anyone proceed to watch this show after reading that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>ISIS filler when?</br>  <br>you should read Re: Monster</br>  <br>You'd still get your anime, manga, and LN, it would just be hard to import  unless you're in a country allied with the States <br><br><br> Japan would still give the US a slice of the pie, they already stated that the US which is already assuming it has a slice, is what keeps China and Russia from just marching into Japan outright. They say the current cold war type stalemate is preferable. <br>Well that's true—but Japan still has that potential.<br><br><br>Just keep America happy, and all things go over well, like the other guy mentioned.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because anyone is not a burger, a chink, or a gook</br>  <br>She's also an excellent marksman, hunter, musician, etc. She is very employable without having to resort to prostitution.</br>  Black &gt; Red &gt;&gt;&gt; Blue&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Yellow  <br>Actually asking for reparations after such light attack that exceeds even Japanese annual budged is pretty jewish.

Whenever someone says something that the posters largely disagree with, /dng/ has been directing people to the /a/ thread. But when the do the same thing here, they redirect them to /dng/. <br><br>I'm just wondering if there was some sort of conflict between the two threads, or if SOMETHING happened, here. I've honestly been out of the loop for a while.</br></br>   not posting the best girl for a new thread. <br>its like you fags dotn even care anymore.</br>  WHEN?    <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Pixiv makes it hard for me to take Yuri seriously some times. They seem to like the idea that he's obsessed with mochi.</br>  <br>/a/rc-v talks about the anime and some times about the card game which can go on with out people fling shit on each other and say X card is better that X card, from what ive seen people in arc-v thread are some what nicer than that shit-hole /dng/, while as people who ENJOY playing pet decks &amp; having fun /dng/ is where fun goes to die.</br>  <br>If you wanna talk about Nationals or Regionals go to /dng/.<br><br>If you wanna talk about the mysteries of the Ruris, post here.<br><br>Above all else don't be a meta-posting faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'll get her spot light soon. Right now it's bikers, samurai and ninja time.</br>  <br>We like to have fun here.<br>You like to be insufferable tryhard tripfags there.</br></br>  <br>Soon after Gon v. Crow.<br>Now if you were referring to when we'll see Reira's smile in-show I couldn't say. That expression is Kaiba Ultra Parallel Rare</br></br>  <br>But the best girl was posted in the OP</br>  <br>In all my time on /a/ I never knew what true love was like until Serena. <br><br>I understand Yuya and Shun's pain of no Ruri.</br></br></br>  <br>Because when /dng/ is bad, as of the recent banlist, it dissolves into mostly shitposting and elitism, and usually a combination of both, like how anything that isn't apparently Nekroz, Qlis, Shaddolls, BA, or Tellars is a rogue petdeck that can't win shit and shouldn't even be played. <br><br>Not everyone at /dng/ is like that, but a lot of them are, whether it's shitposting or not.<br><br>Meanwhile we just argue between who has Serena, Fusion vs. Xyz, and Ruris.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like I'll fit right in, then.<br><br>Trips seem to be dwindling nowadays. Coincidentally, so is post quality, but, eh, fair point.<br><br><br>Sorry, that'll be the last of that from me.

I think the only people she's called by name are Reiji and Yuzu.</br>  <br> implying anyone will ever love Sawatari <br> except for me </br></br>  <br>False.</br>  <br>She told him to calm down once and he calmed down, who else is capable of that?

We all are.<br>They would pull some combo on you and you will be sealed into a cardboard prison</br></br>  <br>Petit Milady.</br>  <br>Tommy Heavenly6, BACK-ON, or Sambomaster.</br>  <br> When Yuri falls, Leo's last resort is Supreme King Judai <br> Judai and Yuya have a duel in their Supreme King modes for maximum edge <br><br>That would be extremely entertaining</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish they would do that again. Hyperdrive and Ride to Survive were too good for their own good.</br>  <br>I'd at least be an antagonist for one of the Lancers to take down.</br>  smoll &amp; not so smoll  <br>The God of War shall not lose.</br>  <br>Yugi is such a fucking manlet.</br>  <br>I wonder what deck Yuri plays, I hope it's bugs</br>  <br>I would pee myself if that happened. Too bad they're busy perfoming for mainstream anime.</br>  <br>What if I play Vampires with Plaguespreader for Synchros and Dragon's Mirror for Dragonecro? I'd be cool and using all the summoning methods!</br>  <br>I want Yuri to card me.</br>  <br>How can Jack be so tall if he only eat instant ramen as a child.</br>  <br>That or grim m  fairy tales.</br>  <br>Why is Yuri so perfect?</br>  <br> Jack's old duel disk <br>One job.</br></br>  <br>Kaiba and Jack are all the way on the right away from the manlets.</br>  <br>Pure Aryan genetics.</br>  <br>I dont think he was able to have it often, they were poor so it was an occasional treat</br>  Are there actually Tuner monsters in the world of Zexal?<br>Scrap Hunter appears in Zexal and it mentions Tuner monster.</br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  <br>Specially if the monsters are the ends of the tales, which all know almost all of them end miserable or dead.</br>  <br> Evilswarm </br>  <br>Yes, but everyone circlejerks XYZ SHOKAN as kind of the best thing around.<br>Kaito once upon a time did a total of one fusion and one ritual summon and never did it again for instance.</br></br>  <br>Probably. Zexal probably just focused on shilling Xyzs<br> I still want Magnedragon to get a fucking print </br></br>  <br>Because his voice is sex.</br>  <br>Kaito was truly the savior of Zexal duels</br>  <br>Indeed, without him and IV the duels would have been so shit.</br>   characters in the anime create their own cards on the spot <br><br>Fuck it, I'm gonna make some fake cards and get them made.

I can't for the life of me find it.<br><br><br>Actually, Rex and Weevil basically faced each other in the finals of a tournament that was, essentially, a Nationals. (Rex won, but in-canon they were supposedly good.)<br><br><br>If you need help with PSCT, let us know.

I won't explode with anger or seethe with resentment. I'll tell her it's a great story and i'm glad she had fun.

Who wins?  <br>Clear Mind summons Quasar which blows everything out of the water so you tell me</br>  I wish there was a ritual user in the cast.

Pretty sure Yuma could Shining Draw a ZW that ups a Hopes attack by half the attack of a monster it battles, and makes it unable to activate effects when its attacked or whatever</br>  <br>But then if he summons Shooting Star, Yuma wont have time to Shining Draw because he will have been hit by 5(3?)

I swore that I will stick to my Steadfast Dueling style no matter what! <br><br> Yuya: That’s going to be pretty difficult, considering that you’re having a Riding Duel with Crow. <br><br> GONGENZAKA: I WON’T EVEN MOVE A STEP, NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY! <br><br> Yuya: Then how are you going to perform a Riding Duel? You will have to move… <br><br> GONGENZAKA: WHAT!? NOOOOOOOOO!

Oh...well we'll just create some random new archetype in a few months that'll dominate for a year and call it a day.</br>  <br>It's not shit if you shove it in chaos dragons.</br>  YAMEROOOOO  What is this expression trying to convey?    <br>The pleasure of making ketchup</br>  Who's better skill wise,Judai or Yusei?  <br>i's that feeling when some little faggot who thinks he's hot shit falls and knows something about entertainment falls right into your trap and gets rekt</br>  <br>yusei</br>  <br>Yusei.</br>  <br>I like it.<br>Whenever I see one of those scrubs on DN who hosts a "NO EXTRA DECK" or "NO XYZ/SYNCHRO/PENDULUM" duel I go in with my BLS deck and beat the crap out of him to show them what happens when they try to get an easy win with their bad decks.<br>I used to do it with Monarchs, but they kept ragequitting</br></br></br>  <br>Do you use mini knights + manju/senju?</br>  think the new movie will have xyz and synchro?<br>it's called dark side of dimensions so you could say it takes place in another dimension</br>  <br>Yuma &gt; Yuya &gt; Yusei &gt; Yami &gt; Judai<br><br>Then again we don't know the extent of Zexal's generation ability, or how the power of batshit-mode Yuya works.</br></br></br>  I SET MY SCALES FROM 1 TO 8  <br>I use the Knights and Manju, but not Senju</br>  <br>I can't wait for them to meet. The suffering will be immense.</br>  <br>I SET MY SCALES FROM 1 TO 12</br>  <br>I do something similar, if I see somebody hosting a NO PENDULUM duel, I'll ask them why they don't want Pendulums they'll usually say "they broke the game" or "they're too OP".<br>I then tell them, it's not Pendulum you should fear, but Xyz. I then beat them with Rank 4 spam and mock them for thinking Pendulums are anywhere near as dangerous and degenerate as Xyz</br></br>  Who the fuck designs these posters?  <br>Do you use ptolemaus -&gt; nova -&gt; infinity?</br>  <br>If Gon gets SHS pendulums they better be Scale 1 and Scale 12</br>  <br>But Pendulums and XYZ are so degenerate we're in danger of splitting the earth's crust.<br>And OddEyes.dek is far more deadly than any R4 engine.</br></br>  <br>Pendulum's are fun to use though</br>  <br>Of course, they need to be taught a lesson</br>  <br>Someone at Otomedia, I think.<br>When do we get another one of these, anyway?</br></br>  <br>Exactly, that's my point. I wanted to show those idiots that complaining about Pendulums being "broken" is stupid when Clownblade and Infinity exist, since Pendulums at least are fun and have more variety in their strategies</br>  <br>I find it absurd how many random Level 12's are showing up in Arc V. That number used to be sacred. <br><br>R12 deck when? Railway is nice and all but to wield monsters that are three times the Rank of most XYZ monsters in use, that's how you know you're really the master race.</br></br></br>  <br>Igknights kick Clownblades ass<br> I'm still mad Dragoknight isn't Fire Attribute, that would've made Igknights a whole new league of brutal. </br></br>  <br>The only Rank 12 in existence is the upcoming Number 93 Utopia Kaiser, and he isn't a real Rank 12 since his materials are 2 Numbers of the same rank, not level 12 monsters</br>  <br>I just got that the STAR motif, which appear on buttons here and on her regular jacket, is a pairing to her MOONlight deck.</br>  <br>My favorite is the one with Yuya and Sawatari, but I haven't found a good scan of it.</br>  <br>Holy shit you're not kidding.<br>Surely there are more Hopu's than there are spots in the Extra Deck by now?<br>This is making Heroes look conservative.</br></br></br>  <br>Scale 12 doesn't let you summon level 12 monsters.<br>Also, there really aren't many level 12s in arc-V.</br></br>  <br>They might as well print this son of a bitch by now.</br>  Scale 0 and Scale 13 when  <br> Yuya that high <br> Judai that low <br><br>Judai is one of the few people who should have beat Yugi and has the best drawing and searching skill of any of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Chojiro has a couple L12 Cardians, but they were all made level 2 so it didn't matter.</br>  <br> 1000000 <br><br>Jesus christ Zexal...</br></br></br>  <br>You can't attack other monsters.<br>If you don't declare an attack, you lose the duel. <br>The only way to beat it is to have one of your monsters surpass 100000 Att.<br> And Castel ;^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how it still loses to Castel even though it's crazy overpowered.</br>  <br>If EGAOYuya is losing a duel, he drops the cards and rips his opponents neck. So he's pretty damn powerful.</br>  <br><br> Cannot be Targeted or Destroyed by card effects ;^) <br> Your opponent cannot activate cards during the battle phase ;^) <br> Cannot be banished ;^) <br> If your opponent does not declare an attack, they become your sex slave for life ;^) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me fix this for you.<br><br>Atem &gt; Yusei &gt; Judai &gt; Yugi &gt; Yuya &gt; Yuma</br></br></br>  <br> The opponent cannot use cards or effects <br> This card gains 1000000 ATK for every card in the graveyard, deck, hand, on the field, and those banished <br> Your opponent must attack this card if it is his turn <br> This card can be summoned Turn 1 from your Deck with no special requirements, even on your opponent's turn <br><br>It's balanced and there isn't power creep though guys, I swear!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A nice idea, too bad it's wrong<br>Given the circumstances Atem physically cannot overcome any later deck</br></br>  <br> Requires 5 Level 13 monsters  <br> The previous form, Numerronius, is never printed <br>Nah, it's fine.</br></br></br>  <br>Then that isn't based on skill, it's based on decks. Even then, Atem's deck does a good job of stalling with Marshmallow or whatever given the right circumstances and considering if they all dueled, said script would dictate Atem to win regardless.<br><br>Hell Judai had to lose on purpose just to have Atem win. Based on pure and raw skill Atem is still the best duelist, regardless of their decks, hell Yugi might technically be if we're going with end of DM Yugi. <br><br>There is no way in hell that if they all dueled that Atem would lose to any of them, hell in all likelihood it'd probably be Atem/Yugi &gt; Judai &gt; Yusei &gt; Yuma &gt; Yuya, because the oldest get special privileges.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Arc V's final boss isn't as ridiculous as Don Thousand</br>  <br>Wasn't it Yugi who owned Marshmallon not Atem?</br>  <br>It's basically true. Yuya, despite being such a nice and cheery protagonists, is the one YGO MC most amenable to solving problems with violence.</br>  <br>All the MC's have invincible plot armor.<br>If they fought it would be like having five identical infinite forces/immovable objects smashing together and expecting a fixed result. <br>Or five John Cena's having a simultaneous arm wrestle and expecting one to come out on top.</br></br></br>  <br>Why we still give attention to posts like that.<br><br>obvious /dng/ fag is obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes Yugi is the one who used Marshmallon, either way Yugi is getting the new BLS/Gaia support for the new movie in all likelihood and Atem is likely going to either be using a supped up deck as well or using whatever Johan/Yusei villain uses.</br>  What's the new movie going to be about, anyway?  <br>That would be the case if Judai hadn't lost to Yugi. <br><br>Yugi has the most plot armor, he'll win regardless.</br></br></br>  <br>Spring or Summer of next year.</br>  <br>Are you fucking kidding me? That duel was inconclusive. We never find out if Yugi won or not.<br>Please calm your nostalgia.</br></br>  <br>Yusei<br><br><br>I'd have it:<br>Yusei = Yami &gt; Judai &gt; Yugi &gt; Yuya &gt; Yuma</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's cute! CUTE!</br>  <br>What, not when, I was asking if there is any info on the plot.</br>  <br>Did you forget that Judai attacked Slifer instead of just ending his turn allowing Slifer to go back to the graveyard? <br><br>Judai lost on purpose, it wasn't about winning, it was about getting his love of the game back, which he did. <br><br>Besides it has nothing to do with nostalgia if you seriously don't think the writers would have Yugi win even against Yusei or some shit, and I don't even like Yugi as much as Judai, Yusei, and Yuya, but it's still a fact.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have to expect LITERALLY GOD to be kinda ridiculous.</br>  <br>Sorry, it's 6am and I'm tired. As far as I know, villain resurrects and uses Atem, Kaiba is the main hero and not Yugi, Yugi and Kaiba are probably dueling at the start, flashbacks to Atem here and there, Kaiba/Yugi vs. Villain/Atem in space with D-Gazers.<br><br>That's pretty much it.</br></br></br>  <br>is there a source for that?</br>  <br>I don't have it, but some of it is from the trailer, and I remember reading someone had some info from when they showed it or right before they showed it. Sorry I don't have it.</br>  Well /a/? CHOOSE.  <br>Choose for what?<br>Dueling? <br>Punching? <br>Glueing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya looks like a failed entertainer.<br>Yuri looks like he's trying to hard to appear straight.<br>Yugo looks fine.<br>Yuto looks like he just crawled out of a gay fashion show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya he pulls the cosplay off best, but that's not saying much</br>  <br>Which cosplay works best for each character's associated series rep.<br><br>Yuto-Yuma &gt; Yuya-Yami &gt; Yuri-Yuki &gt; Yugo-Yuse</br></br></br>  <br>Try some mixing up</br>  <br>Alright.</br>  <br>Why is Anna there?</br>  <br>I want to  fuck  Slifer slacker Yuri.</br>  <br>None of those are Yuzu, so they're worthless.</br>  <br><br>Yuya.

Yusei would lose to Yugi, it'd be bullshit, but he'd lose. I mean they don't consider Yugi a legendary duelist for nothing in 5Ds.</br>  <br>Depends on the deck really. I think it'd be better to have Rank 4s made into Rank 5s though.</br>  <br>It would be better they just made some of the generic R4's into R3's or R2's. Just to mix it up a bit.<br>There is no R3 engine for instance.</br></br>  <br> no R3 engine <br>BA sure has one.</br></br>  <br>Honestly, its kinda backwards on how easy rank4 is to make and how literally all of them have very good effects while other ranks are a bit harder to make and their effects tends to be mediocre</br>  I finished Zexal I. It good really good towards the end, but I think Faker got pardoned too easy? He was literally saying that he didn't care about his sons episodes ago and then suddenly he's all "Oh, it was my plan to save Haruto."<br><br>Zexal II looks good.</br></br>    <br>Great taste.

Kosaki and Marikas rejections are going to suck.   feel indifferent towards the rejection <br><br>Oh baby. Dropping Nisekoi five months ago is finally revealing its perks.<br>Just a few more and I'll eventually stop giving a fuck about it completely.<br><br>Feels good.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a Tsugumifag and I think Chitoge is going to win, but Kosaki Boring Satellite Onodera is still well in the running.</br>  <br>Nah, it's over. The anons are right, he'll realize his crush on Onodera is just that and his real love is Chitoge and all that cliche bullshit about promise girl and stupid shit. <br>I love Onodera but even I can't ignore the writing on the wall.</br></br>   Yui having a heart-to-heart with only Chitoge <br> not Kosaki <br> not even her dying friend Marika <br> literally said she's rooting for Chitoge <br><br>Yeah it's over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>That's shit.</br></br></br>   I always pick the loser HanaKana girls   <br> Fucking hell I didn't even care about Yui that much and that still kind of hurt to read <br>Because you realize that her character was introduced just to get BTFO.</br></br>  <br>She was introduced for 2 things. Stir shit up and cause drama and get rejected.</br>  FUCKING DROPPED   twelve chapters ago <br> Raku: "I don't give a shit about the promise and I'm about to confess to Onodera." <br> nothing happens <br> now <br> Raku: "Holy shit I might actually be in love with Chitoge despite nothing happening since Christmas. Also promise girl promise girl promise girl." <br><br>It's not even the fact that I'm a Kosakifag (I really don't care anymore), but this is just shit writing. Raku is being made into a fidgety and indecisive retard in order to bait the audience.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Allow me to correct you there. Raku said he would confess to Kosaki IF she was the promise girl. But in the end he chose to abandon the promise.<br><br>The promise was brought up this time around not by Raku since he lost interest in it, but by Yui who knows everything about it.<br><br>Basically it was Komi telling us we will find out eventually, even if it doesn't matter. Hell one of the requirements Yui put on that info is that Raku already make up his mind.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember that, it seemed like a major step for Raku to throw away the stupid promise 10 years ago and move on with a girl he really loved.<br><br>Boy, were we stupid to believe that this story would have progression.</br></br></br>  <br> Raku is being made into a fidgety and indecisive retard in order to bait the audience <br>Raku is an underage virgin dude who never had a gf and is crushing hard on the most boring human being on earth. The utter lack of experience defines his character. He'll learn about love not being an everlasting thing and stuff like divorce soon enough.</br></br>  <br>Yep. Didn't do anything. <br><br>She was introduced only during chap 120(?). It's barely over 50 chapters later and she's already out of the race. Can't even comment on how she declared she would try to make Raku fall in love with her to Chitoge, confess to him out of the blue, get BTFO then quit.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah yes, you're right. But at this point I have to wonder what the point of the promise girl and the past is if it won't matter. 99% it will be confirmed to be Chitoge or Onodera after Raku has already chosen her just to show it was fate or other shit like that. I'd rather have the promise girl be Marika or Onodera with Raku still choosing Chitoge, or the other way around. Komi should have the balls to fuck them over after fucking with the readers so damn much.</br>  <br>Rude. Uncle Komi works hard, you know.</br>  <br>Easily the most retarded part of Nisekoi. It's like his brain is programmed to deny any emotional development, every time he feels something for a girl he denies it and acts like he still loves Onodera.</br>  <br><br>He was going to confess until tree happened.</br></br>  <br>At being a troll.</br>  <br>See you next week, anon-kun.</br>  <br>The fact that you're still in the threads 5 months later is not a good sign.</br>  Can't say I'm looking forward to the conclusions. Going by Tsugumi, Yui and Haru, he can't really write a satisfactory elimination process, after having built up the girls so much. I like Chitoge, but it mostly feels like the other girls are getting cheated out of a proper chance by the author. "lol I fell asleep", "lol she couldn't be serious", "lol I guess I'm just imagining things", "lol I'll keep my feelings secret for now" "lol I'll bow out and support my sister" etc., all until Chitoge can close the gap.  <br> every time he feels something for a girl he denies it and acts like he still loves Onodera <br>I'm still impressed about how he denied Yui into oblivion in less than one minute.</br></br>  <br>Onodera is obviously going to be the promise girl, but Raku will decide that it doesn't matter.</br>  <br> &gt;Raku: "Holy shit I might actually be in love with Chitoge despite nothing happening since Christmas. Also promise girl promise girl promise girl." <br>But Raku didn't bring up the promise girl, Yui did. He hardly even reacted when Yui said she would tell him after he decides.</br></br>  <br> I like Chitoge, but it mostly feels like the other girls are getting cheated out of a proper chance by the author <br> 4 cuties will have to eat shit for the last one to get a bit of vanilla <br>I'm starting to see what's so wrong about Nisekoi.</br></br></br>  <br> But at this point I have to wonder what the point of the promise girl and the past is if it won't matter.  <br> 99% it will be confirmed to be Chitoge or Onodera after Raku has already chosen her just to show it was fate or other shit like that. <br>Why are you still wondering about it if you already know the answer?</br></br></br>  <br>Considering the attitude of Japanese harem lovecom readers, that's not even funny.</br>  <br>I think that will be worse than actually just losing. <br>No, what would be worse is that at the end Raku decides the promise doesn't matter anymore and throws the locket away and confesses to Chitoge and they live happily ever after. Then it shows the locket broken open and inside it shows Onodera was the promise girl as one final "fuck you" to the Onodera fans.</br></br>  <br>Problem is there are only 2 developed males in this entire series and they're both taken. She's destined to get some shitter, go lesbo, or be foreveralone permavirgin.</br>  <br>I doubt it. If she was promised girl why then Yui was talking to Chitoge not Kosaki in this chapter?</br>  <br> Onodera is the promise girl <br> Could have made it happen with Raku for literally 11+ years <br> Sitting around doing nothing while Chitoge inches closer to winning <br>Being an Onoderafag must suck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Onodera is obviously going to be the promise girl <br> Raku will decide that it doesn't matter <br>Onodera will get BTFO harder than the dinosaurs, Japan will frown, Komi will smile and tell them it's their fault for not supportig DA and now they won't get a refund for all the money they put into Nisekoi.<br><br> I kinda wonder how much wasted paper will result from all those tankoubons getting destroyed. </br></br></br></br></br>   komi is weeding out the undesirables <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br><br> Implying Yui's future husband wasn't introduced this chapter </br></br>  What will Y-san do when Marika loses?  <br> Sitting around doing nothing  <br> Being an Onoderafag must suck <br>Yeah, she does suck.<br><br> Oh my, Raku is asleep. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What drives me mad about the current developments is that there's been no natural progression I can't think of in Raku shifting from Onodera to Chitoge. We got by far the most shippy plot between Raku and Onodera yet (or between Raku and one of the girls in general) just a few chapters ago, they had a great time, were about to confess to each other, Raku finally said fuck it to the retarded promise and then... He sees Chitoge once and suddenly she's the cutest thing ever and won't leave his mind. And his subconscious is telling him he might actually love Chitoge without him realizing it on his own. I'm reminded of another harem from a few years ago (Ai Kora) where the MC literally decides on which girl to go after because he suddenly has a dream about her despite her not being in the lead compared to the others in any way until then. Now, it's not as bad here because it's always been blatantly obvious that the only real contestants are Chitoge and Onodera, but what's been happening feels forced and unnatural IMO.</br>  <br> Yui <br> undesirable <br>Cut off your balls, they're pointless.</br></br></br>  Stop calling her Onodera. There are 3 Onoderas. All you're doing is causing confusion. Just call her Kosaki, that's what her name is.  <br> lose <br>Probably nothing.<br> die <br>Murder Komi.</br></br></br></br>  SOMETHING HAPENNED ?<br>AFTER TWO YEARS DID SOMETHING JUST HAPPEN ?</br>  <br>Y-san would suicide bomb Jump HQ if Marika died.</br>  <br>Yep. Well, the prolonged limbo by the series should've already been a sign.</br>  <br>Not just that but Raku is so uncertain of himself, one question from Shuu throws him completely off.</br>  <br>He's been tsundere for Chitoge the whole manga, someone needed to tell him to make him realize that, also the possibility of losing her.</br>  <br>why would a christmas tree lighting up ruin a fucking love confession now ? fuck you rakku fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you</br>  <br>Newfag detected.</br>  <br>Fuck off and have some Jitsu wa instead.</br>  <br>Because he couldn't just fall asleep there.</br>  <br>If someone just says Onodera, its clear who they are talking about, there is no confusion.</br>  <br>Yeah, fuck the people saying Onodera will lose just because she's beta. She'll lose because random interruptions always screw her over. There's no theme or message here.</br>  Let's not forget Raku thinks Chitoge likes a guy. Now he has the pressure to figure out his feelings and confess or lose Chitoge forever. <br><br>But the boy Chitoge likes is Raku, he just doesn't know it yet. Because it's funny, right guys? It's so FUCKING FUNNY.</br></br>  <br>The only thing forced about whats been happening is that he's still in such denial about liking Chitoge. He's had feelings for her for a long time now but he just refuses to admit that they are romantic feelings. By this point he should have realized that he likes both and started trying to decide.</br>  <br> If she gets interrupted she should just keep trying. Trying to confess to him like 3 times over the course of 2 years, and giving up as soon as the conversation is interrupted is retarded. The random interruptions screw her over but she could easily deal with the,.</br>  <br>The "fuck you" to Onodera is already as big as it can get. If at any single point in the manga Onodera or Raku hadn't been cockblocked about conveying their feelings with random bullshit like  ("Oh no! The tree lit up! Better postpone my confession!"), they'd have already started a perfectly regular relationship. But now Chitoge is finally ahead in the game and Onodera will be written out of the competition in some way, e.g. "Haha, I woke up today and realized I wasn't really in love with Raku the whole time! No hard feelings, you two go on be happy!" or somesuch. Problem is Komi didn't manage to write Chitoge as best girl by a clear margin. They're all great, so it feels bad when they get offed one after another for plot reasons.</br>  <br>She'll lose because the whole universe including herself will screw things up.<br><br>That's a sign of something not meant to happen.<br><br>Yui got the easy way out. Marika will only have to end her life and Onodera will probably nearly die of dehydration. Tsugumi will simply adjust to being a mistress when Chitoge isn't around.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "lol I'll bow out and support my sister" <br><br>That really worked out great for Haru. Sacrificed her own ambition and then her sister gets dumped too.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the best option?<br><br>Raku rejecting Onodera and going for Chitoge or Raku and Onodera dating a bit before Raku ultimately dumping her for Chitoge? Marika is presumed dead by then.</br></br></br>  <br>That's how it'd work in real life, but such logic cannot be applied here. She'd just keep getting screwed over. Look at the Christmas story, Onodera actually asked Raku what he was going to tell her after the tree interruption and then they got interrupted again by the phone ringing.</br>  <br>Onodera losing will be the start of Doodledera forever</br>  <br> Doodledera forever </br>  <br> Problem is Komi didn't manage to write Chitoge as best girl by a clear margin. They're all great, so it feels bad when they get offed one after another for plot reasons. <br>This is just a problem with harems in general though. If you make one girl the best girl and have a huge lead the whole time then it's boring/pointless when the other girls get screen time. If you even it out and give the side girls more development it feels bad when they don't have a chance.</br></br>  <br>As far as I'm concerned the fact that she gives up on it so easily is her own fault and I don't really feel bad about it happening.</br>  <br> Problem is Komi didn't manage to write Chitoge as best girl by a clear margin <br>I don't think this ever was the point.</br></br>  <br>It's all shitty writing in the end</br>  <br>It's been obvious that Raku has liked Chitoge for a while, but Raku is stubborn and it seems is more in love with the idea of being in love with Onodera that he ignores that he ignores everything else, including his own changing feelings.</br>  Why hasn't there been a Haru chapter forever? I thought the anime would've prompted a Haru appearance but I'm surprised it hasn't.  <br>If she were written convincingly, I could agree, but in Nisekoi it feels more like heavyhanded author intervention instead of something that naturally flows from the characters, so it leaves an extremely bad aftertaste.</br>  <br>No one is reading Nisekoi for good writing.</br>  <br>Well yeah, because Komi doesn't want to get bitched at for having the characters never try to convey their feelings, but he also doesn't want to have any actual development with the main story.</br>  <br>Well obviously all of the characters act how the author wants them to, but from an in-story perspective it's still her fault for not trying harder to confess when she's had plenty of time.</br>  It would have been more interesting if Raku and Kosaki did start dating but in secret. So Raku has to keep his fake relationship with Chitoge going while dating Onodera in secret.  <br>But that conflicts with how Raku is actually written. He really is in love with Onodera and every time they're alone together they're always shown to be a great and healthy potential couple. Why should he even want to switch to someone else when that's the case and why should I as a reader want it, aside from waifufagging?</br>  <br>And that's why the whole story feels so unsatisfactory to me. If you don't manage to get all your readers onto the same page, then you missed the mark with the romance plot. It's not even a very convincing play on the "false love" theme. The initial reason for the moniker was the mafia pretend lovers shtick, but that was mostly used in an unexciting way. Also, nothing false about the love of all those girls for Raku. Komi simply wrote a bunch of all round lovable girls and now all save 2 get shafted (the other "winner" being Ruri, since she was Shuu's foil from the beginning).</br>  <br>He does genuinely like Onodera, but he also has similar feelings for Chitoge. It's not about giving up on one girl so you can completely shift all your feelings towards another, Raku just needs to decide which one he cares about more.</br>  <br>I guess I didn't quite get my point across. Of course all the characters are puppets for the author, but the key to success is whether the author manages to make me forget that a character is running on rails, which I think Komi did not. When the meta workings of a story become too apparent to make things happen (e.g. a lot of (un)lucky incidences or the whole story unravels) then I fault the author, not the character.</br>  <br>I feel that Raku does like Onodera but he fell for Chitoge without realizing it. Ever since this moment I felt that subconsciously he cared for Chitoge more than Onodera.</br>  <br>Naw you got that point across, I just didn't think thats what we were talking about. I agree with everything you said about it being Komi's fault, I just don't feel bad for Onodera as a character.</br>  <br>Agreed, from then on it felt like they were at least equal to him. It feels like he's moved on from Onodera but isn't ready to admit it to himself because he still doesn't seem himself as being in a real relationship with Chitoge.</br>  <br>Meh, I wouldn't say that. For all he knew, Chitoge was in danger at that moment. Leaving Onodera there was simply the right thing to do regardless of personal feelings.</br>  So, bets on what we get next week?<br> Marika rejection <br> Another chapter of Raku trying to decide <br> Push by Onodera/Chitoge <br> Unrelated slice of life shit where nothing happens <br> Something else </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Unrelated slice of life shit where nothing happens <br><br>This.</br></br></br>  <br>Unless the manga is winding down and not intending to actually go through the full third year or getting a timeskip, we're getting shit-all for a while after all this "excitement".</br>  <br>Most likely scenario, but I still think theres a chance that we get a few more chapters of everyone thinking about stuff before going back to nothing happening.</br>  <br>But that is why Nisekoi is so great and otters find it so hard to drop it. Having only one or two girls be worthwhile makes a harem drama pointless with other girls being more annoyances than anything else. Even though there are many girls in Nisekoi that get shafted by the plot, the fact that they are all great in their own way gives them a measure of worth and lets them have their own individual fanbases rooting for them. That it is painful and salty to see your chosen girl lose shows how appealing they are and how good the manga is.</br>  <br> Chitoge <br> great </br></br>  I fucking hate this mango.   read manga <br> character crosses intersection happily <br> you begin expecting him <br> suddenly <br> truck-san appears blasting 70mph down a busy pedestrian filled intersection <br> manages to miss everyone but your waifu <br> either stops in a structure or mysteriously vanishes <br><br>Oh, truck-san<br>This is a thread to discuss our friend, Truck-san and all of his exploits.<br><br>Japanese don't actually drive like this in real life right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Anime about cute trucks hitting cute things when?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lBn<wbr>AY4VH9T4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>official thread theme</br></br></br>  <br>H-how do I make sure sempai doesn't notice me?</br>  <br> Japanese don't actually drive like this in real life right? </br>  <br> HOOOOOOOOONK <br>CHEEEEEEEN!!</br></br>  <br>The looks like it's squinting at the girl.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiha<wbr>bara_massacre</wbr></br>  <br>Mate, have you ever seen an asian driver?</br>  <br>It all makes so much sense</br>  <br>Chen can operate motor vehicles?</br>  <br>Not very well.</br>  Holy fuck I saw a Nissan electric truck, it's sneaky even in an area with low ambient noise.  <br>Fucking ninja trucks</br>  Why are these trucks so fucking deadly?  <br>Wasn't this during an MGS4 launch?</br>  <br>Why would you build quieter trucks when they're already so deadly?</br>  <br>Natural evolution.<br>Survival of the fittest.<br><br>One day, the trucks will be the new dominant species.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now they can kill you before you noticed and without witnesses.</br>  Are trucks the sharks of the land?  <br>So is Pixar's Cars actually a grim portent of our very own future?</br>  <br>To make them deadlier.<br><br>It's the agenda of the gubbiment.</br></br></br>  <br>You're lucky you aren't a cute anime girl.

What's everyones preorders?  <br>go fuck yourself with this bullshit again</br>  <br>Same as last thread.</br>  <br>Wait for it to really start.</br>  In this time before wonfes, i'd like to make a question for all buyfags.<br><br>What is your dream figure that will NEVER get made? And i'm not talking "anything my waifu", i'm talking about a very specific figure based on a illustration or moment from a show that you are 100% sure will never be made, but you'd buy it instantly if it was. As an example, for me it would be a figure based on this illustration.</br></br>  <br>Go fuck yourself.</br>  Hopefully we'll get a painted huke Saber Alter.    <br>I'd be surprised if we didn't to be honest</br>  I Hope there's MonMusu stuff  <br> print this out on all the computers in a computer lab back in high school  <br> somehow don't get in trouble </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> get a boner watching rape and torture shit <br> this made me flaccid <br>thats so fucking disgusting pls kys</br></br></br>  <br>Help me in starting to dislike the mouth too, I don't want to splurge 200 bucks on her but I'm still fine with the crazy face.</br>  <br> not wanting to watch tama's cute belly get drenched in cum <br>Fag.</br></br>  <br>The only explanation is that one of your school's higher-ups was into scat</br>  <br>Why does this even exist? It looks like shit and it's not relevant to Miku at all, I'm guessing it's based on some dumb illustration.<br><br>Why would you do that when there are tons of worthy Miku modules from the various Project Diva games?<br><br>Retards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your new is showing.</br>  <br>This is actually pretty creative bait, i commend you for the effort</br>  <br> it's not relevant to Miku at all <br><br>You're right.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get it if you don't want to splurge.<br><br> shitposting this early </br></br></br>  <br>Miku is worst girl anyway. More Luka and Rin figures please.</br>  <br>Is this bait? It has to be, I refuse to believe that someone in here could be this retarded.</br>  <br>Newshit please go</br>  <br>This brings back memories.</br>    <br>holy shit I forgot all about this<br><br>man the early 2000s internet was the best. what ever happened to that spirit of fun and laughing at other peoples misfortune?<br><br>I miss the prank pulling 4chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, i want a Figma Black Hanekawa, in the cat PJ's. I REALLY want her in the bra and panties, but that seems too lewd for GSC, even though they've released lewd figma's before.</br></br>  <br> GK <br>Fuck I may as well.</br></br>  <br>That's the problem, I still want to and not even the mouth is making me want her less. The exclusive thing stings but on the other hand it means flat shipping, she's also not going to come out before April and I could safe up the money if I wanted to.<br>I'll have to wait for tomorrow for a few more pictures and if there are more potential pre-orders for next year that would fuck me over money wise.</br></br>  <br>What? I don't watch shit anime like Wixoss and it looks exactly like Miku.</br>  <br>Looks really good from behind but this face is a bit creepy. Hopefully he'll look better painted.</br>  <br>Then I would advice to just get it. Not all figs are perfect. May as well get it, especially if you're a wixoss fan. Unless they announce new figs its pretty much your only choice aside from nendroids and </br>  <br> shit anime like Wixoss <br>Don't be so salty Borutos only getting prize figs.</br></br>  Hey guys; just a quick question from a non-buyfag.<br>You guys do group orders for blind box type things? I really want to order picture related but I only want Kaede and not the others.<br>(source: amiami; around $30 for the set)</br></br>   Mishirojou GTFO <br> Protected the Egaos <br> Gave fans some good ol' fans. <br><br>Why is Kaede so BASED?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Kaede a best</br>  Oh, god. I don't whether to be aroused or fearful.  Kaede is not attractive in the slightest.  <br>It must be tough being both blind and deaf. My condolences.</br>  miku is so enthusiastic  <br> Gave fans some good ol' fans. <br>I will always love this joke.</br></br>  <br>Sorry I'm not, I just don't have a fetish for ugly hags with penis hair.</br>  So how was this episode suddenly so amazing? I didn't have much of an opinion on Kaede before but woah. All the vague cameos from her finally paid off.<br><br>I've been enjoying CG for wacky idol hijinks, but this really felt comparable to some of the high points of the 765 anime.</br></br>  <br>Because they went tore you a new one then patched it up.<br><br>Dat ending is also pretty hype and actually wants you to know what happens next.</br></br></br>  <br>Minamin would make a good mom</br>  The OP is so good.  <br>Funny thing is, from the PV, people expecting drama from this episode  or at least me  but then everybody got HEALED.</br>  <br> everybody got HEALED <br><br>That's the problem.<br><br>Mishiro was still playing nice. Kaede's actions was a declaration of war against Mishiro. As far as she was concerned, 346 would easily bend to her will with little problems. This episode made it clear that it was the opposite; the idols and staff will do everything in their power to fight back.<br><br>Unfortunately, this just gives Mishiro incentive to take off the kid gloves and enforce her authority by turning into the Wicked Stepmother. Beware the Drama in the next few epiodes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to marry Anya!</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  So, uh, when they refer to "10th", they mean a 10th anniversary concert right? But why do they call the LL concert 6th?   miu   <br> So how was this episode suddenly so amazing <br>Because after 14 episodes they finally focused on a Cinderella Girl that people actually like?</br></br>  <br>I like Ranko and Minami</br>  <br>Because its the 6th big LL concert.</br>  If the top dog idol rejects her she has no leg to stand on.<br><br>Everyone rolls with the Kaede if she ain't down with your plan you might as well give up.</br></br>  <br>Liar.</br>   All these people demonizing Mishiro already <br><br>She's just a hardworking woman who wants to improve the company and make daddy proud.<br><br>Stop bullying her.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll keep bullying her until she shows a genuine egao.</br></br>  <br>Try me</br>  <br> I am Evil! Stop Laughing! </br>  <br>Sasuga top idol, no should we call her top cake?</br>  <br> mfw just want her and TakeP to fuck already <br>I like how obsessed she is with time or how it's like she has a time limit. Maybe she's the real Cinderella?</br></br>  This was all Rin's fault  Local CEO blown the fuck out by best asset.  <br>Hey, I love Uzuki. It's just that she has to share her spotlight with two others who I'm not that fond of.</br>  I hope they show Kaede more and not just give her the spotlight in this episode then forget about her in the next ones.  <br>She also got more performance, screentime, lines and relevancy than Chieri/Kanako/Rika/Miria will ever get, so fuck A-1.<br>Not because Kaede got too much, but because some CP girls got nothing.</br></br>  <br>Miu is a good girl</br>  <br>Yes she is.</br>  Why is Koi Kaze such a godly song?  That ED credit, they put Kaede name after Mio, they usually never separate 14 CP names from each other and only put other characters name after 14 CP no matter how many screentime they get, not even in episode with a lot of Mika she can get in first colomn name  Kaede is the best. The best I tell you.  <br>Oh those CP girls are gonna get theirs, don't you worry about it.</br>  I want to go bar hopping with Kaede then take her home and listen to her dajare all night long.  Is this mishiro father?  This thread needs more Kaede love.  I want to lick Uzuki's armpits.  Does Riina become Natsuki's protege or something?  <br>Superior prpr idol.</br>  <br>One of the sponsors I believe.</br>  <br> protege <br><br>So that's what the kids are calling it these days.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Pick your favorite idol armpits</br></br></br>  <br>It's only fair that one's favorite idol part should belong to their favorite idol.</br>  <br>I don't like the way he looks at Mika</br>  This show really loves idol pits.  <br>Koi Kaze is gorgeous, but Yuki no Hana has something enthralling to it.</br>  <br>Roccat's.</br>  <br>you forgot an extra 0 there</br>  <br>Stand down men, we are in the presence of a armpit/shoulder god</br>  Anzu's cute little cough there.
