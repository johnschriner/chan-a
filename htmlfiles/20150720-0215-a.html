[ How does one become the strongest like Accelerator?  start by not being a faggot like OP  <br>100 Push-ups<br>100 Sit-ups<br>100 Squats<br>10 km run<br><br>Every day for at least three whole years.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  so are these chicks lesbians or what?  Nope just good friends -_-  Hetfags would argue with you to death  <br>Yes.</br>  Girls can't love girls.  Just friends who'd agree to a 3some.  post pictures of them doing lewd stuff together<br><br>and someone get that webm of reina running her finger over kumikos lips</br></br>  <br>Probably. Their relationship is far more romantic than platonic.<br>Try explaining that to the shitposters, though.</br></br>  <br>Got you covered bro.</br>     yurifags still mad   <br>About what? I don't see anything to be mad about.</br>  <br>They got what they wanted though</br>  <br>Do you even watch the shows you shitpost about?</br>  <br>Why do you insist on taking the bait? These threads won't ever stop as long as people like you fall for it every single time.</br>  Bi if anything.  how did you feel when you saw this?  <br>I felt like a giddy child. Yuri has magic powers.</br>  <br>enraged<br><br>i want to slam their heads together and make them kiss</br></br></br>  <br>The better question is: Who cares?<br>The show they're from is awful. And if you're watching things for yuri bait then there's a problem.</br></br>  <br>I dropped this anime at epsidoe 9 or so, worth it to pick it back up?<br>Asuka was my favourite btw</br></br>  Do NOT sexualize the Hana.  Why does Kiyoshi get all the fine bitches?  Tell that to Hiramoto  <br>Does it already count as a generic harem series?</br>  she already does that fine just by her self   check Gelbooru <br> nothing but Meiko porn <br><br>This is how it should be.</br></br></br>  <br><br>no it doesnt, Hana is the only girl that likes Kiyoshi after 180 fucking chapters</br></br>  <br>but mari is also confirmed entranced by kiyoshi's ass</br>  <br>Who is Chiyo?</br>  <br>someone who friendzoned kiyoshi early on</br>  <br>But she was jealous when that whole Kiyoshi/Mari thing went down.</br>  <br>that was only supposed to look like jealously to fool the readers. it was later explained that she was honestly worried for mari as she was rumoured to have become a slut</br>  <br>More like worried about her sisters honor and school reputation.</br>  <br> seeing that her man is happy wearing chiyo's headband she changes her mind and forces him to keep her panties on <br>Hana is the only girl who has displayed jealously in the series so far...oh there's Risa too</br></br>  <br> citation needed </br>  <br><br>Because he had great taste</br></br>  <br>That was never touched on again. It was a gateway into getting her to kiss his ass. The entire point of that scene was to humiliate mari after all the bullshit she did at the start.</br>  <br>She was only worried about mari this has been discussed a lot.</br>  <br>are you serious? did you completely miss the poison sucking chapters?<br><br><br>it was confirmed back then with the flashback and mari's behaviour (she got horny while sucking kiyoshi's ass)</br></br></br></br>  <br> That was never touched on again. <br>it's akira we are talking about here. you can bet that he hasn't forgotten about that</br></br>  <br>if its akira were talking about then you can expect something that completely shatters your expectations, she could find an even better guys ass. I recall gakuto having quite an ass.</br>  <br>fair enough, but so far my point still stands.<br>In addition, she's going to spend more time with kiyoshi than the other boys in the next few chapters because of the cavalry battles</br></br>  <br>And glasses bro girl, she cried and shit when she thought he was taken away by joe</br>  <br>But that still doesn't mean she likes him, so until proven differently her or chiyo doesn't have romantic feeling for him. Hell I, not even sure if Mari even likes him as a person</br>  So i started reading this after putting it off for ages and..<br>Jesus christ, I get the feeling I'm reading the wrong translation.</br>  <br>Because of a nice ass? What his father told her was that any guy with a nice ASS! can't be a bad person, not that she should fall for any guy with a a nice ass.</br>  <br>That guy must be joking.</br>  <br> Tyranny </br>  <br>I never said that she fell for kiyoshi, I was talking about his ass.</br>  <br><br>So you're saying that you think Kiyoshi has a nice ass?</br></br>  <br><br>Easily yes.</br></br>  So why did Mari start hating her dad?  <br>Mine is better.</br>  <br>I guess I am..</br>  <br>The only thing we know is because hes a pervert.</br>  <br>Try to guess.</br>  <br> implying she doesn't have a repressed father complex </br>  <br>perhaps his indiscretions caused a divorce?</br>  <br>Whoah, wait a minute. Is it already Monday? Japanese raws were already released?</br>  <br>yup</br>  <br><br>She didn't understand the ass mans life.</br></br>  <br>everyone has a brain fart once in a while.<br>this happens when you don't hire proofreaders.</br></br>  <br> Utopia hasnt even done 183 yet <br><br>Yes i know it was translated but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Their site has been down for days as well.</br>  <br>Do people not understand what a harem is? If there are two girls then it's just a triangle. Mari has not shown any interest in Kiyoshi. Chiyo is debatable, but not really.<br><br>I also disagree with the anon who said that Hana's only interested in him sexually. Obviously she's interested in him romantically, why else would she have snatched the headband from Chiyo or let him keep her underwear on? I mean, really.</br></br></br>  <br> or let him keep her underwear on? <br>she didn't "let" him, she forced him to keep her underwear on after witnessing his happy face while wearing chiyo's headband</br></br>  <br>He didn't resist &amp; agreed to it so he wasn't forced to do shit.<br><br>Also, doesn't change the fact that she has romantic feelings for him.</br></br></br>  <br>She probably got into some embarrassing situations for the ethical asspects her dad taught her.</br>  <br>  doesn't change the fact that she has romantic feelings for him. <br>I wasn't really trying to confute that<br> He didn't resist &amp; agreed to it so he wasn't forced to do shit. <br>he didn't object because his head was still spinning after all the concentrated shit happened in the previous chapters but hana clearly told him to keep her underwear on no matter what</br></br></br></br>  <br>So did Kate have a tight butt Mari get herself into?</br>  <br> Do people not understand what a harem is? <br>They do. Controversial posts just help to get a discussion going.</br></br>  Probably my favorite page  <br>No wonder most male MC are beta seeing that page it's the best mix of being in love and being serious for the girl.</br>  <br>His head was not spinning, that was the<br>Point of the scene w/Gakuto.</br></br>  <br>but that's what he keeps repeating himself in ch 184</br>  So Hana has to win right?<br><br> She has pictures of them making out. They've pissed all over each other. Unless Hana is ready to get into some freaky shit and accept that the guys has been macking with another broad, Hana should be the default winner </br></br>  <br> My brain isnt working <br><br>Just means hes still thinking about things.</br></br></br>  <br> unless hana <br>Chiyo</br></br>  <br>He went from being scared of Chiyo to finding his resolve and declaring that he still likes her. That's a complete 180 of earlier.</br>  <br>Hana has to come out &amp; be honest, I think. Once she can do that then maybe, but I'm kinda hoping that Kiyoshi &amp; Chiyo do it first &amp; it doesn't work out. Who knows with this manga though?</br>  <br>He wasnt scared of chiyo herself, he was scared of the idea of corrupting her which is why he says stay away from me. What declaration?</br>  <br>yes but what does that have to do with my post? my only point is that hana genuinely likes kiyoshi. As you mentioned, Kiyoshi is still going after chiyo</br>  <br><br>He's chasing an ideal girl that doesn't exist. But that's ok, in the end, his Id will prevail.</br></br>  <br>Hana has so has Chiyo.</br>  <br>I don't know, it depends whether akira wants to drag things out or not. he might give in to anime fags (if sales go well) and turn the series into a more conventional harem series by adding chiyo and maybe mari to kiyoshi's harem for real</br>  <br>No they havent. Hana at least gives him huge clues but neither chiyo nor hana have directly come out and told him.</br>  <br>It's not their fault he suffers from MCitis <br><br>literally can't be any more forward<br> Grope me as much as you want <br> My sisters a slut if she's trying to get you <br><br>vs<br> Show me your dick <br> Make out sessions <br> Pissing on each other <br> General jealousy <br><br>Coming out and saying it would just be pointless at this stage</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was scared of corrupting her, b/c he thought he was corrupted.</br>  <br> Grope me as much as you want <br>You're misinterpreting this scene completely. If she actually wanted him to grope her she wouldnt have started crying. This is the penultimate result of her sisters flashback thinking of "You can't understand it until you try it" and chiyo constantly repeating "Its settled my sister really is a slut".</br></br>  <br><br>I doubt it, but it's possible. It would certainly be disappointing, as has had very little actual interaction with anyone besides Hana.</br></br>  Just started reading this yesterday, and shit's gotten really fucking bad since the introduction of the real student council. The whole plot is now moving on retarded yaoi and SM antics for the boys, and SLUT MISUNDERSTANDINGS for the sisters and MC. The fabled ass-man turned out to be a pussy-ass bitch too<br><br>Its almost unbelievable how this manga turned into complete shit in just this arc</br></br>  I love the mango, but why can't I get myself to watch the anime?  <br>Stop reading it then.</br>  <br>  JC Staff <br><br>It's okay</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point. If she liked Kiyoshi she would not have done that. I wonder if the scenes with Chiyo seeming that she suspects them are really going to be a red herring or she ends misinterpreting them. Though it can't be a coincidence that she keeps interrupting them. She, almost seems like the antagonist to their progress.</br>  Someone can translate the title of chapter 183 for me please?  <br>She is an urine slut.<br><br><br>He lied about that.<br><br><br> not even sure if Mari even likes him as a person <br><br>Why would you think that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Theres a huge buildup of misunderstandings and jumping to her own conclusions with her. Shes going to be completely disappointed when nobody gives a shit about her birthday in the way she thinks everyone is preparing for it. It sounds like a buildup to where we see a darkside to her that kiyoshi will mostly likely not enjoy at all and start to wonder.</br>  What's going to be really awesome about this anime is that while a good portion of them will start to do that shit where they start off strong &amp; end pretty weak this one will have a solid ending.  So will fugly get NTR'd?   There is no such thing as a bad sumo-love <br> There is no such thing as a bad crow-lover <br> There is no such thing as a bad Ass lover  <br><br>Sumo is the mother<br>Crows are the sister<br>Ass is the father<br><br>So what's Chiyo's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking it </br>  <br>Because even if she does show him more respect for how much he has help her she still doesn't seem to trust or like him. It feels like she's waiting for him to fuck up so she can start hating him again</br>  <br>change ring</br>  <br> not liking yaoi and SM antics </br>  <br><br>no wait, I think it's "changeling" from the movie</br></br>  <br>don't make /v/ tier threads</br>  <br> her whole character is built upon assumptions and jumping to conclusions, think about even since her first introduction <br> seen MC easer and assumed he liked sumo also <br>  jump to the conclusion that since he (faked) like sumo and help a crow he couldn't had peeked on the girls and wasn't a bad person  <br>  seen he had her outfit and assumed he was a pervert, turned him in and act him in trouble  <br>  assumed her sister was a slut <br> assumed the boys actually cared enough about her to find out about her Bday and make her a gift <br>  assumed the mc wanted his blankets on the floor folded and that they weren't for a reason  <br> assumed the panties belonged to glasses bro  <br>Etc basically she's a plain person who usually makes situation worse with her assumption</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Changeling is a 2008 American drama film, written by J. Michael Straczynski and directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, that explores child endangerment, female disempowerment, political corruption, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence.<br> female disempowerment, mistreatment of mental health patients, and the repercussions of violence. <br><br>sounds about right</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no such thing as a bad  liar. </br>  <br>its fine when it doesn't stall a heated arc for 40 chapters<br>I can't stand watching those faggots episodically build that rocket with retarded Andre running around anymore</br></br>  <br>I agree with the slut-arc, could have been shorter. <br><br>The boys building the PBR instead of an actual simple bottle rocket was fucking hilarious and completely in-character, one of these pooped his pants in front of the whole class, the other one got naked and placed a bottle on his penis in front of his girlfriend and the third one was planning to run bound in ropes into the girls' changing room. They're fucking retarded.<br><br>It starts gaining momentum again, don't worry.<br>Also why the fuck do you think the assman is a bitch?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed Andre at the start, now I feel as though he ruins any panel he's in.</br>  <br>Cause his character lives from Meiko.The confident one.</br>  <br><br>Meiko got annoying as well, with all the fucking sweating.</br></br>  <br> Also why the fuck do you think the assman is a bitch? <br>His daughter's best friend (also his student) gets abused into mindbreak and he won't take his own daughter's word on that. She needs help, not get locked alone in a room<br>And then there's rumors all over the school about his daughters being sluts, and they also get bullied for that.</br></br></br>  <br>mari treated him like a bitch through the whole first arc and he took it without putting her in her place. guy's down with midlife crisis, he needs to get back on track sure.</br>  <br>*soon, not sure</br>   such a talented artist spends his time drawing perverted high school stories <br>And not a day goes by that I don't thank the gods that there are people like this in the world.</br>  <br><br>wait for bd</br></br>  <br>Thx ;D , ahhh and this frase on vice abdomen?</br>  <br>I mean, she caught him red-handed with literally porn. The Chairman's hijinks are one of the things that make this manga so special for me.</br>  <br>Did she enjoy getting peed on?</br>  <br>well, he should have explained to her that there's nothing wrong with porn. catching him is not the problem, the problem is her thinking he's doing something wrong</br>  <br>Mari was right.<br>It is wrong to be caught like that.</br></br>  <br>Mari wasn't right. She wasn't mad that she caught him. She was mad he was reading porn, regardless if he got caught or not, because she considers porn something bad. Which is really dumb.</br>  <br>No she wasnt. What he does in his free time is none of her god damn buisness.</br>  So did Chairman cheat on his wife is that why Mari hates him?  <br>I have the feeling it's either that or a boy did something bad/pervy to mari. In both cases it'd be really poor and cheap, I hope the mangaka can come up with something better than this.</br>  <br>something like: "in the end, the style is going to match the fashion"</br>  <br><br>God is faces on women have gotten so shit.<br><br>I loved his realistic approach in the early chapter, he's gone more and more animu with each chapter, chapter 250 will have them with no fucking noses.</br></br></br></br>  <br> being caught watching porn at work  <br>that's not exactly his free time</br></br>  <br>Not in the school which would not matter if he had not been caught.</br>    <br> weekly issues <br> better art than monthly issued manga <br>how does he do it?</br></br></br>  <br>He loves what he does and it shows.</br>   I can't pee when I have an erection <br><br>that's incorrect...</br></br>  <br>A lot of backgrounds and props are photographs.</br>  <br>I want to believe. I want to believe that Chiyo's character is going to turn around at some point.<br><br>Reading back in the story there's a lot of foreshadowing &amp; mirroring. Maybe that scene with her during the Sumo thing is a sign of things to come when she realizes that everyone lied to her, especially Kiyoshi?</br></br></br>  <br>If you seriously think mari was mad because he was reading porn in school, as opposed to reading porn in general, your reading comprehension is in the negatives.</br>  <br>I think it's way less than you think. If anything he rises a lot of panels aside from the flashbacks.</br>  <br>*reuses</br>  <br>It does matter where you read your porn.</br>  The fact the author is sexualizing Hana more in the latest chapters doesn't bode well, so far the only reason to believe she might have won was the fact that she's the only one that hasn't show her tits.  <br>not to mari. she's mad at porn regardless of where.<br>besides, a principal who's alone in his office room reading porn might be a little in poor taste, but it's not like it's morally reprehensible. still, the point stays, location was not the reason for mari's reaction.</br></br>  <br>Well, he also writes that manga about Robert Johnson, he's pretty versatile.</br>  <br>Wtf are you talking about? Hasn't the author been specializing Kiyoshi too?! Hasn't the big joke with Hana that they have been having sexy time together?</br>  <br>Dumbest post of the day award goes to....</br>  Link to the raws?  <br>Hana will steal all the MC's first but Chiyo will still win</br>  <br>This , being hana is suffering.<br>Funny suffering.</br></br>  <br>*sexualizing</br>  <br> tfw Hana is his first girlfriend too </br>  <br> Hana is his first wife </br>  LIVE I TELL YOU<br><br>LIVE FOR THE SAKE OF HANA</br></br>  This thread is lacking Hana expressions.   karate <br>of course it had to be the dane cook of martial arts</br>    <br> Claims GF status <br> Takes his first time <br> Forces to take responsibility <br> First divorce as well <br><br>Chiyo - A man who takes responsibility can't possibly be evil!<br><br>The end</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone fucking forgets that the only reason Kiyoshi is still in school is because of Chiyo that threatened to quit too.  <br>If you aren't that bothered now you might as well wait until the BDs and try watching again.</br>  <br>He stayed because of her breasts.</br>  <br>I forget most of the details about the story.</br>  <br>I really don't remember almost everything.</br>  Reminder that Hana lusts for Kiyoshi's D on a daily basis  <br>Well he also grew the resolve to stay because he had goals like the wet-tshirt contest.</br>  <br>medusa cant come soon enough</br>  <br>I'm half tempted to get that 1/7th scale figure of Hana to make her pose with dat medusa</br>   yfw Prison School becomes the SAO of this season <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oIS<wbr>iuPK3l04</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Why do people always run to SAO as the first comparison?<br><br>SAO is by no means a decent example of literature, 2 years of semen glopping endlessly into mainstream popularity is all it has going for it.</br></br></br>  <br>I really want to know, was the 2 years line really in the ln?</br>  <br>why are they talking so much in the first few seconds with nothing happening? is that how people watch anime?</br>  <br> 1/7th Hana figure with medusa pussy <br><br>I'd buy the shit out of it</br></br></br>  <br>It's been out since december, it just cost like $160+, i might buy one early august off amazon. Even comes with a bottle prop and some other stuff</br>  <br><br>That was hilarious, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Holy shit, it's true! This is the single greatest fucking thing ever!</br>  <br>they are on jcafe</br>  <br>mmh, it ain't that bad, you just need to get through the beginning of the new arc, it gets better again after a couple chapters. I mean that moment got me bored too, but really, it gets better after a while !</br>  <br> Medusa shit there. <br>Yeah way to ruin it.</br></br>  <br>it certainly is but 160$ is a bit too much for me. <br>Now I wonder why burglars in japan even bother assaulting banks and jewelry shops when they could make millions just by robbing random otakus rooms</br></br>  <br> nearly all of them are niggers. <br><br>also ? what's the point of filming yourself while watching an anime, I mean are there actually people watching those kind of videos ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I did it was pretty funny since you can emphatize with the reactions of other people.<br><br>Of course the first sitting is alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>good to know that you are a filthy fucking secondary lelouch you piece of shit</br></br>   kissing before marriage <br>slut</br>  <br>Yeah, why would I lie to you? There's also figures of the vice president as well. One is like huuuge and one is oddly proportioned. I'm just gonna order the Hana figure though. Maybe put some aside for a potential new figure release due to the anime.</br>  <br>I hope you are wearing your purity ring anon.</br>  <br> Do NOT sexualize the Hana. <br>hanakana was an inspired choice to voice hana. <br><br>she'd giving me a permaboner with her gangsta voice combo'ed with her genki voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>AROUND HIS DICK!</br>  Well /a/, what is your...Choice?!  Reminder that if you don't think Mari has something for Kiyoshi you're in denial  <br>More like anyone who thinks Mari has something for Kiyoshi is delusional.</br>  When will get Jo's arc where he conquers many young female hearts? He's the token harem protag of this series.  <br>The time of troubles is not yet upon us.</br>  <br>More like, if you don't think mari and a vlad-style impalement are a match made in heaven you're delusional.</br>  Kiyoshi wants to do things with girls &amp; Hana wants to do things with him. When is Kiyoshi gonna realize this?  <br>when hana starts wanting to do with him the things he wants to do with girls and not whatever her confusion invents as pee-revenge.</br>  This hana shit has dragged on long enough, why doesn't she just tell him to fuck her brains out?  The adaptation is shit so far  <br>hopefully the bd's aren't shit</br>  <br>for the same reason shingo thought putting a bottle on his dick as kiyoshi suggested was a legitimately good idea and a non-psycho like anzu would go for it, or why shingo and joe blew it with anzu and cake recently. mangaka has characters act stupider than usually to avoid making relationships</br>  <br>I think it's great.</br>  <br>But I thought illicit relationships were banned. Also, how bad would it look if a student council member &amp; prisoner were dating?</br>  <br>They arent banned unless the USC is in power. Which is why the boys helping them is a double edged sword.</br>  <br>I don't suggest they'd date in public. But announcing their interest for one another and trying to date in secret, or even off school -since not in prison anymore- would have worked for anzu/shingo. Similarly, for kiyoshi/hana, being honest with each other and then trying to hide they're dating-shenanigans ought to be the way to go, not this stupid back and forth.</br>  <br> double edged sword <br>dumb. <br>the word you're looking for is dumb. they could have asked kate to make a wet-t-shirt contest in exchange for helping her crush mari, she'd oblige happily</br></br></br>  <br>shit or not its still aoty material</br>  <br><br> The boys are dumb <br><br>Shocker.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they showed they can be pretty smart at the end of the first arc though, they shouldn't turn back to being idiots whenever the plot demands it, it feels cheap.</br>  <br>Unless Kate's side has a Chiyo no one is going to be asking her for shit.</br>  <br>Sorry that was meant for:</br>  <br>the boys =/= kiyoshi. the rest didn't give a shit about the usc and mari until kiyoshi pointed out kate didn't plan for wet-t-shirt contest. at that point, it'd make more sense to ask kate for one, than help mari.</br>  <br>They are only smart when they working towards a goal with Gakuto being the providing the true brains behind everything. I have yet to see Gakuto really move on his own. He really only moves into action, because of Kiyoshi. Kiyoshi only moves forward, because of Chiyo who fucks him over as well as aid him at the same time.</br>  <br>They can't. They can't let it be known that easily to the world that they are a bunch of perverts. They all want girlfriends, after all. They don't want to be hated. Can you imagine the chaos and destruction that would come crashing down on their asses if the girls found out WHY they are having a wet t-shirt contest? Oh, the humanity!<br>Not to mention the fact that kate obviously does not aprove of the contest (hence its disapearance from the calendar). What if she simply did not comply AND put them in jail for making such a resquest? Think of the risks and consequences!<br>Also: the courage necessary to make such request! The path they took is the only real option.</br></br></br>  <br>Working with Kate would mean being against Chiyo. Not gonna happen.</br>  <br>Good response. It takes into account that these characters are human. The other anon can't seem to grasp that small detail.</br>  <br>Not to burst your bubble, but the world (=the school) knows why they went to prison in the first arc. Everyone thinks of them as creepy perverts already, that boat has sailed.<br><br><br>I was referring to the rest of the 5, not kiyoshi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She didnt disappear anything from the calender. They have a completely different event which is clamming. Knowing this manga the wet-tshirt contest is either a lie or completely different from what the boys expect and the clamming is actually what you think is because kate is a huge fucking dyke and would be the one to do that.</br>  <br>So? They are trying to start anew &amp; meet some girls this time. Don't want to tarnish their rep even more than it already is.</br>  FUCK HANA SHE'S A SHIT<br><br>A SHIT<br><br><br>KATE A BEST</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you're grasping at straws mate, the boys being viewed as non-perverts is impossible. besides, a girl who would consider being a pervert a bad thing would be a poor fit for them anyway.</br>  <br> you probably enjoy the same shows as these freaks <br> you probably have the same waifu as them <br> you probably have jerked off to their favorite hentai manga </br></br></br>  <br>It's good for the comedic scenes anyway.<br> but muh pantyshots <br>kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>When did this happen?</br>  <br>I want her to be raped by a black man</br>  <br>When they go to Kiyoshi's room to do ouroboros and Hana starts off by making a show of being as casual as possible</br>  <br> stalker <br> best <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, I don't remember that at all.</br>  <br>JUST<br>CUCK</br></br>  why are chapters 168-175 missing from batato  <br>Its when you get to see a more honest part of her and she keeps forgetting her whole revenge stuff because you know by now what she really wants.</br>  <br><br> hur dur what's tyranny </br></br>    <br>Just because they are doesn't mean they aren't trying. For example the I &lt;3 WT tee shirts. Why not just spell it out rather than put WT? Because they hiding it! There's a good reason they aren't running down the ball proclaiming it down the halls of the school. C'mon man.</br>  <br>The irony is that you are using a Naruto pic.</br>  <br>Why? I assume getting raped by anyone is just as bad, regardless. I have never heard anyone go: If I get raped I really hope it's by an Asian dude.'</br>  <br>Probably because that's what would be the most degrading.</br>  <br>Has anyone made a 120sec webm summary of episode 2 yet?</br>  <br>Fuck, I didn't mean to quote!</br>  <br>It's just as bad, regardless.</br>  <br>I didn't know it was Naruto, how do you know it's from Naruto? do you watch Naruto? Fuck off.</br>  <br>That whole segment before the Ouroboros was sorta endearing, seeing the characters act like a new couple without noticing it</br>  <br> trying this hard to fit in after making a mistake <br>Don't piss yourself dude.</br></br>  Rapists usually aren't sexualized.  <br> It was a gateway into getting her to kiss his ass <br>No, it was characterization to show that her dislike of boys stems from her conflict with her father, and that she can deny it all she wants but she shares her father's preference for nice asses.</br></br>  I never got into this because I couldn't get past the MC being a super perverted cunt and all his friends or whatever you wanna call them are masochistic as fuck<br>Is this shit worth re-picking up the manga?</br>  <br>Try again once your balls have dropped.</br>  <br>I just want to see S girls fucked by the big nigger cock, what's the matter?<br>Same thing goes for Meiko.</br></br>  <br>This 'shit' is worth picking up for the reactions alone.</br>  <br>I don't see why you say that. It just wasn't interesting past the typical anime 'muh sexi skool gurl!'</br>  <br>Then go back to your Gary Stu action shit that's meant for 12 year old boys.</br>  <br>Are you that anon that's obsessed with the girls getting raped?</br>  <br><br> ¥11,800 <br> Somehow equating to $160+ <br>Come on guys all it takes is a simple search. Even with EMS it would never cost 160+ don't be retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only S girls. And by black cocks.</br>  <br><br>Nice blog.</br></br>  <br>Then go write some fan fiction or hire an artist for a commission to get your rocks off. You are not contributing to the discussion.</br>  <br>Jokes are so much better due to delivery and timing.</br>  <br> hire an artist for a commission to get your rocks off. <br>That would be a great idea, I guess I'll get in touch with Andou Hiroyuki to draw a doujinshi about that.<br>Thanks anon, you truly inspire me to do great things.</br></br></br>  <br> almost 100$ without shipping <br>it's still too much</br></br>  <br> I want to believe that Chiyo's character is going to turn around at some point <br>I feel like she'll become the president of the 3rd Student Council, which will also include some of the boys, and then go full tyrant mode when she finds out about all the lies. Mari, Kate, Kiyoshi, Hana, and maybe some of the others  Andre and Risa?  will end up in prison,  as will the Assman,  and we'll get a flashback to whatever turned Mari into a psycho misandrist as the cast tries to recover Chiyo from the dark side.<br><br>I'd be happy to oblige,</br></br></br></br>  Where else can I go read th manga without worrying about any chapters getting deleted like at batoto?  <br>I used mangafox mostly, the majority of the chapters there are Utopia</br>  <br>This is perhaps the least harem series of all time<br><br>It took like 80 chapters for the girls to treat Kiyoshi as anything less than scum</br></br></br>  He started in on Sumo with nothing but lies. DAMN DIRTY LIES.<br><br>He saw Hana peeing and it mindbroke her.<br><br>Mari is the only fine bitch that knows what a scoundrel he is but can't deny that she wants to go and take a bite of his manly ass.<br><br>Kiyoshi is sort of the prettyboy of the prison schools, though, so it makes sense bitches love Kiyoshi. It takes a refined lady to like Andre WHATS WRONG WITH YOUR FACE</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> not your generic Harem trash  <br><br> It took like 80 chapters for the girls to treat Kiyoshi as anything less than scum <br>it sure does takes a while to redeem yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>its funny no one mentions his face</br></br>  <br><br>Given she's gay, being raped by a dude in general would be pretty nasty.</br></br>  <br>SAO was originally a fucking phone novel written by a teenager. I am completely serious. Chapter 16.5 is the smut chapter that was removed from the official LN print after some publisher picked the author up because SAO was popular.<br> Two years of semen made a gushing sound as it flowed endlessly into Asuna <br>Is totally a fucking quote from 16.5, it might be something other than "gushing" but I'm certain I remembered the rest of it.</br></br></br>  <br>are you offended by smut and porn?</br>  <br> forgetting THE GLOP <br><br>/a/non... I'm dissapointed.</br></br></br>  <br>No I love smut. I just enjoy the fact that SAO was literally written by a highschooler. It shuts people down hard when they defend it. Prose is kind of important in smut but 16.5 is just too funny. It's exactly why that line is made of.</br>  <br>I FUCKING KNEW IT. I remembered that it was a g sound but glop just didn't come to mind because come the fuck on.</br>  Two liters of ragu sauce made a moist squishing noise as it splattered irregularly into the lasagna platter.  <br> ragu <br> not using the based Prego brand as a base for further enhancements <br><br>I just don't know about some people</br></br></br></br>   Hana is my waifu   <br>It's the amount and just what kind of porn.<br>Fucking speedreaders not knowing the chairman also had "peeping girls changing and bath room" on his computer.</br></br>  <br>You are fucking retarded kill yourself</br>  i feel like chiyo would go together well with gakuto. their chemistry just clicks  Reminder: Only Chiyo had made Kiyoshi Happy on the entire manga  <br> Mari is the only fine bitch that knows what a scoundrel he is  <br>actually hana is the only one who knows everything about kiyoshi</br></br>  <br>Chiyo is Kiyoshi Good End, the perfect good girlfriend candidate, but Hana is his True End, as perverted as him and also as innocent in all of this, Mari is his Bad End who will fuck him over for her own convenience like she already did with Kate.</br>  <br> I never got into this because I couldn't get past the MC being a super perverted cunt and all his friends or whatever you wanna call them are masochistic as fuck <br> Is this shit worth re-picking up the manga? <br>stop right there. <br><br>unless you're a landwhale or castrated by one, or under the age of 12 you should be finding this show hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  The Mari a slut arc lasted waaay too long  <br><br>I remember when first reading through this and thought Chiyo was purposely setting up the boys to get their time in prison expanded with the photo she made with Kiyoshi seeing Mari and the Chairman received it simultaneously.</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128265388 <br>faggot</br></br>    The prez is too hot, I'm sorry Hana  <br>Carpet munchers just aren't attractive at all.</br>  <br><br>shit taste tbh</br></br>  <br>He stole the jacket from/ sumo girl</br>    <br>Mari thinks he's a scoundrel, b/c he's a man. Hana knows he's a scoundrel, but also knows his good points too. Chiyo just sees his good points.</br>  Oh Gawd save me  <br> Chiyo just sees his good points <br><br>More like what she wants to see as good points he doesnt really have.</br></br></br>  Best page  <br><br>Chiyo has a sister complex, she feels nothing for Kiyoshi</br></br>  <br>So by that logic she will want to fuck Kate cause her sister did it too?<br><br>No, Chiyo likes Kiyoshi for real.<br><br><br>There's no info yet in the manga why Mari hates men?<br>As little girl she loved her daddy ass and was proud of it, so what the hell happened there to change her thinking?<br><br>Was she raped or molested by one of his father older associates?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is not an American comic &amp; it's a comedy so most likely no to the rape backstory.</br>  <br>that's the problem with mari. everyone else makes sense, she's just misandry because misandry<br>meiko loves mari, her actions are explained as loyalty<br>hana is just a confused child and rpetty much cares only for kiyoshi<br>kate is a stalker who chases after mari<br>fujo didn't do anything bad to be honest<br>risa was part of the asc who was treated like shit, it makes sense for her to join kate's coup<br>but mari's actions are not explained, unlike for the rest of the members of both councils<br>and I fear we'll get something lame like "daddy cheated on mommy" and that supposedly will have to suffice as "characterisation" for mari</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think she had any evil intention. she didn't even know that kiyoshi had broken out of prison</br>  <br>Her dad is a pervert and so are the new male students.<br>It is possible that there was no male person in her life she could respect after she understood how other people think of her dad's creepy ass-obsession.</br></br>  How did she become so lewd?
