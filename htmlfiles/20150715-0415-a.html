<br>They weren't, it was just warm in the room (even 8man states that shortly after this scene), add in the fact that they were wearing track suits and you can see them being hot by their flushed cheeks.<br><br> Why was she smiling? <br>They were talking about her love, hayama.<br><br> Why was he looking at her lips? <br>8man was attempting to lip read, she sometimes tends to talk really low.<br><br> Why did she lean in? <br>She didn't, it was an anime only thing.

I forced my friend to watch this with me so he made me listen to the OP every fucking time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Iroha know she is stepping dangerously by trying to steal 8man from double yy?</br>  <br>Pretty sure those two didn't even know there was a race until Hikigaya held Iroha's bag for him.</br>  <br>As long as you same 60~ people keep shitposting, the ride will never end. <br><br>One Rinfag made KEY threads every night for 2 years.</br></br></br>  <br> hating christmas cakes. <br>absolutely disgusting.<br><br>my captcha - cakes</br></br></br></br>  <br>She knows how dangerous it is so she keeps it a secret, she's already pretty scared of Yukino and doesnt want to compete with both Yukino and Yui.</br>  <br>That's S2 ending: 8man's secret ballad.<br>If you "bought the fucking novels faggot", you would have gotten it.</br></br>  <br>The ED was great, though. Hello alone &gt; Everyday world. Not by a large stretch, but it was.</br>  Have you accepted the Haruno end yet, delusional /a/nons?  <br>Hello Alone is pretty depressing and sad though.</br>  <br>them trips confirm</br>  <br>I wholeheartedly agree. Not a yukinofag, but wow the ballad ver. was amazingly beautiful.<br><br>The original ED was just kind of there. Pretty sure everyone skipped over it. I only like the sort of faint trumpet or violin or whatever thingy you can barely hear.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a fool if you think three consecutive numbers mean anything.<br>Am I literally the only one who wants Haruno to get with Hayama?</br></br>  <br>I wonder what it feels like for Yui. I bet at the beginning and middle she was certain that no one on earth could possibly like him but her. Now I wonder how she feels that Hikki is swimming in bitches.</br>  I only just noticed the small differences in the opening of season 2. The cat Yukino was looking at starts shaking his tail, the still pictures that appear during it changed, 8man starts to actually appear holding a book on closeup (probably only a fix, no deeper meaning), the cup they got for 8man starts appearings in the tray and iroha appears among the three in the room. Each of them are gradual, the two last don't appear until episode 11 or 12.<br><br><br>But it matches the melancholy of their relationship perfectly.<br><br><br>Even though it was obvious they were saving money with the stills, I still liked to watch just to see the montages with the three of them drawn in real photos, but yeah, the slow ballad was completely heartfelt. And I'm a senseifag, not even a yukinofag, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Accepted it? I embrace it.<br><br>Haruno is a goddess.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder if you like Iroha then you're a cuck  <br>Nope, but just because it would solve a lot of problems and they kind of deserve each other. She's kind of a (caring) bitch. He's kind of a (caring) dick. They can put up with eachother. Works like a charm.</br>  <br>Yui is kinda dumb so she probably thought a lot of girls liked Hikigaya since she's the bright-eyed idealist hypocrite.<br>Yukino is the one who'd be weirded out, she's seen human beings at their worst after all. As there aren't that many who'd give fish eyes the time of day.</br></br>  <br>If you love someone, you can only see their good points. She's probably just going 'Oh shit, they caught on that he was actually a jackpot of a man. I should've seen this coming!' or something of the sort.</br>  <br>Imagine the sex tho. The hate-fucking would be glorious and the conversations intriguing. What we don't see of those two when they meet some non-main characters must be so awesome. Both talking about their outlooks with Hayama trying to be kind, while Haruno being completely judgmental and whispering to him all the little irregularities and insecurities that person is hiding away.<br><br> Hayama should get a POV chapter. </br></br></br>  <br>It must mess with Yukino that as soon as she realized her feelings she finds out Yui also loves him. <br><br> . As there aren't that many who'd give fish eyes the time of day. <br>She must have known someone else would have her fetish.</br></br></br></br>    <br> steal <br> implying he belongs to anyone besides Komachi right now <br><br>But she's well aware of double YY and she's being smart about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's nothing but a gigantic shipping shit flinging mess.<br> It's not ending anytime soon.</br></br>  <br>I can't believe people repost this horrible GIMP job.<br>The string of saliva is well done though.</br></br>  Is oregairu a scanned yet?  <br>I approve of a side story.<br><br><br>Yukino knew Yui liked him since the start. Yui made sure to broadcast her love all the time. Yukino herself couldn't understand what Yui saw in 8man at the time. Her realizing she also likes him came much later than that, and if you ask me, she might have taken so long to admit it to herself exactly because she also likes Yui and felt guilty deep down. Unlike Yui, who seems like she wouldn't be against stealing 8man for herself even if it made Yukino suffer, Yukino probably places her own feelings in a lower priority than Yui.<br><br>I get some hardcore White Album 2 vibes from how things are going, with Yui being Setsuna.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's the other way around boii. Yukino has hair of black and she's the most popular of the two. So odds are, you're cuck senses are tingling the wrong way. Unless we're both wrong, and this ends up being a dark horse victory.</br>  <br> boii <br> cuck <br>So much cancer in a single post. And I can't even understand what you wrote, that phrasing is terrible. Is English not your first language?</br></br></br>  <br> you're <br>Need to be 18 to post on 4chan</br></br>  <br>It kinda feels like he's sexually harassing Iroha that entire time.</br>  <br>No he's sexually harassing 8man.</br>  <br>Cool allegation, but you're full of shit. Do you have proof of that?

She didn't even realize it herself until around that time<br><br> after school <br>She was begging Yui to stay while she tries to give 8man chocolates even after Yui was being considerate.<br><br> during the date <br>Tried her best to not be a bother and left them alone after looking at the penguin plaque. She was literally dying inside when Yui gave 8man cookies.<br><br>It is obvious she only realized it the night before the date.<br><br>Yui likes 8man and Yukino so much she would rather burn Yukinox8man to the ground than deal with it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  1/8  新しいはす～  <br>2/8</br>  <br>Actual Yukinofag here. I don't agree with him. Quit trying to start something, fagget.</br>  <br>3/8</br>  <br>Why didn't 8man chinkan her against her will?</br>  <br>It's called interpretation. Something that should be diverse, and not an echo chamber.<br><br><br>Great screencap, saved. I think we should be above this shit calling when every group is guilty of being generally passive aggressive.</br></br></br></br>  <br>4/8</br>  <br>JUST FUCK ALREADY WE KNOW YOU WANT TO</br>  <br>5/8</br>  <br>6/8</br>  <br>You can't against the willing.</br>  <br>7/8</br>  <br>8/8<br><br>Now someone please translate this.</br></br></br>  <br>R</br>  <br> no iroha <br>Nah, somebody else will bother eventually.</br></br>  <br><br>There isn't any Yui so I ain't going to TL it.<br><br><br>Hikki is Yui's property.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hikki is Yui's property. <br>You got that wrong.</br></br>  <br>Oh, do this one then.</br>  <br>C'mon do it<br>pretty please I need to know how it ends</br></br>  <br>Why is this /v/ tier thread still allowed? All the cancer in this sorry board is gathered here, there are even facebook tier posts.<br><br>Please, stop. There's absolutely no need for 24/h threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Yui.</br>  <br>Another Yuri</br>  <br>This. Also Fate threads should be given Naruto treatment too.</br>  <br>Naruto treatment? Pretty sure Naruto threads were given the OK even from 4chan's original founder and all the people trying to bait them failed miserably and were cleaned by the janitors.</br>  <br> Naruto treatment <br>You mean do nothing? Because that is what mods are doing with Naruto threads.</br></br>  <br>Very few Yukinofags are decent,<br>but most Yukinofags are under-age circle jerk faggots that came from MAL.<br><br> spamming photoshoped images <br> spamming OP lyrics <br> asking the same retarded questions over and over again (What did she lean in? Why didn't he kiss her against her will?) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's literally two people man. Whole thread is just a circlejerk anywho. Their's just happens to be more simple than ours. Plus there's not much to talk about. All this is is a rerun, especially this late in the day.</br>  <br> What did she lean in? Why didn't he kiss her against her will? <br>I started both of those and I'm a Yuifag. I regret it, I don't like to meme. Nothing I ever say about Yui catches on.</br></br>  <br>See, fuckin' falseflaggers man. Nice quads tho</br>  <br>Take responsibility.</br>  <br>I wasn't falseflagging, I just thought it was funny to suggest she wasn't up for a kiss and act purposefully dense.<br><br><br>How? By Yuiposting?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I posted the lyrics only because someone asked me to. And I like to read between their lines. <br>But most of the things you are saying are correct.</br></br>  <br> Yuifag <br> 4444 <br> shi-shi-shi-shi <br><br>Nice boat end confirmed</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I wonder what Yuifags would do if Yui went yandere.

Now Yui is on equal footing with Yukino and her ship is still alive.</br></br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  When will this happen again?    What happened to Yui's tsun? She has been pure dere for like forever.  <br>Sorry for the delay, was busy drinking. Partly drunk TL, good night.<br><br> Wha...What are you saying?  <br> I don't think I understand. <br> What was I doing? I don't understand... <br><br> How likely was the confession supposed to succeed in my mind? <br> Me, broken hearted? <br> I tasted more of the glimpse of dreadful things... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  At last I come form hell to take the Yahari thread and Yaharifags with me!<br><br>There you will be punished for shitposting, circlejerking, falseflagging, spamming, and and the grave sins that you have committed on /a/.<br><br>So fess up and then you'll feel the pain of remorse, a pain that surpasses every other.<br><br>You'll be able to understand the value of precious hours that you've wasted here instead of doing some genuine works.<br><br>Rest In Peace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mods please put me out my misery.

The major bummer of e-hentai has always been how they treat tags like some precious special resource that takes tons of space, rather then something effectively free. Unlike the booru's for example EH hates having precision in tags, so it's fine if you want everything but if you want to drill down to get something specific it sucks. Since they have lots of stupid "defaults" rather then having a blank slate be a default it can be hard to eliminate things if you don't want those defaults.<br><br>Not that the booru's are perfect either, there's a lot of room for improvements in metadata in general. I'd love to see something next gen put together with full multidimensinoal graph plugin and the like. But for flat lists the booru's are a ton better then EH. But EH is where a lot of content is at so that's how it goes unfortunately. Probably too much inertia to ever change to something better now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> milf <br> not good </br></br>  <br> wanting guys_only <br><br>Literally a faggot.</br></br></br>  <br> Futanari on female <br>futanari -"futanari on male"</br></br>  <br><br>Whats the point of searching for asian porn in a hentai site?</br></br>  <br> 2015  <br> not bi <br>Literally a shitter</br></br></br>    <br> implying that's the same thing <br>You are part of the problem.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't work like that.</br>  <br> Defending milfs <br> Posting memelords fetish <br>You have failed me anon</br></br></br>  <br> this is a site admin <br>mj pls</br></br>  <br> *click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click*</wbr></wbr> <br> BAKA ONIICHAN! <br> *click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click**click**click**click<wbr>**click**click*</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> <br> I GUESS I'LL LET YOU CAN SEE A QUICK PANTY FLASH <br> OK THAT WAS EXCITING ENOUGH NOW ONTO THE NEXT CHAPTER <br> you have completed chapter 2 of 571334 <br> zzZZZzzzzZz <br>I've had more erotic experiences with Excel documents.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> what is autoread </br>  <br>from my experience, auto-read is ALWAYS too slow, unless it's all the way up, in which case it's sanic fast.</br>  <br><br>Damn fucking straight.<br><br><br><br> tfw there are pretty much no Drakengard doujins </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do they have the "presence rule" for tagging and then have tags that would almost never qualify, such as "cum in eyes"<br><br>Like you're not supposed to tag something if it only shows up for one page, well sometimes certain fetishes or sexual positions or whatever would only show up briefly, but I can't tag it because obviously there would only be one page of the chick getting cum in her fucking eyes</br></br>  Why are panda threads being banned?

It's the way things have always been done, except before we did it, but nobody here then is here now, so we've always used Exhentai.

You drag and drop your collection and then set the tags by Ex url or searching by the filename. It takes a while to get everything tagged up at first if you have a large collection but it's well worth the effort in my opinion</br>  <br>I get disappointed everyday.</br>  do you think this is a fucking game?  <br>Yet despite that rule, I see so much shit marked with 'anal' for something that only shows up on one page, sometimes if at all, and half of the time it's something like a buttplug or beads.</br>  Why is "confined space" not a tag? You know those "stuck in a locker" doujins, all great.  <br><br>That's why something like smegma was given such a low presence because it tends to only be in a few panels, maybe 2 pages at most unless we're talking about a tank.</br></br>  <br>Apparently I once searched for furryshit because that showed up somehow. I should clear history and then kill myself.<br><br>I mostly browse the front pages anyway.  Don't need tags when you check often enough to look over all releases. </br></br></br>    <br>I wouldn't have to look up so much gay shit if tg stuff wasn't so fucking scarce.</br>  <br>That is not how you search the mind break tag.</br>  Am i doing this right lads?  <br>Use more direct tags.</br>  <br>Excellent<br><br><br>A fellow Asheman.<br><br><br>It is good taste though.<br><br><br>Cancer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    How do you guys sort your collection?

Get your probes off of me baka! </br></br>  <br> Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and the Voyager twins are studying abroad </br>  <br>Jupiter &gt; Saturn &gt; Uranus &gt; Neptune &gt; Earth &gt; Venus &gt; Mars &gt; Mercury</br>  Pluto not being a planet, and the term "Dwarf Planet" being accepted, is like a really bad meme.<br><br>Its not an asteroid or a random rock that's stationery in its orbit from the Sun, its a body that is actually rotating in orbit around the sun, and it looks in appearance like a planet enough.<br><br>If it orbits around the sun and it's a round body that has a fixed orbit trajectory and it rotates, then its a planet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ranking by diameter <br> not by mass </br></br>  <br><br><br>Technically it's still a planet, but it's not native to the Solar System. It was a lost astral body that was captured by it, instead of being formed from the same spacedust as the Sun.<br><br>It doesn't count not because it's a loli, but because it's adopted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That classification was only created because of the prospect of dozens, maybe even hundreds of bodies similar to Pluto being discovered. If we were going to consider every single one of them a planet, teaching about the solar system would become a complete mess.<br><br>The only meme here is people being stupid enough to think a celestial body receiving a different classification than before implies it has been "demoted" or "excluded".</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dwarf planets are still types of planets, there are also terrestrial planets and gas giants, but for whatever reason no one pays any attention to that major distinction.<br><br>The rest of your post was painful to read, it's like you half understand what you're talking about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well it sure has been "excluded" from all the 'Solar System Planet lists' I've seen since then</br>  <br>Venus is a poison fairy.</br>  <br> the prospect of dozens, maybe even hundreds of bodies similar to Pluto being discovered. <br>They rarely make a headline.<br><br>So what, if there is a super massive star that's 100 times the mass of the sun, and it has planets around it, which do exist. Then the planets in orbit would look even more puny than pluto is to our sun.<br><br>I mean, there is actually a theoretically accepted maximum mass a planet can have before it collapses you know.<br><br>And going back to by point earlier, the presence of even more massive stars from our sun already makes our planet and even jupiter and saturn look puny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> If it orbits around the sun and it's a round body that has a fixed orbit trajectory and it rotates, then its a planet. <br><br>Not according to the IAU. A planet must:<br><br>1. Orbit around its star<br>2. Have a spherical shape.<br>3. Be the dominant gravitational body in its orbit.<br><br>Pluto fails the 3rd stipulation, because its orbit ducks through Neptune's and Neptune is the dominant gravitational force. The fact it passed the first two is what established it as a dwarf planet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Venus is a NEET <br> Never gets sunlight <br> Smells weird <br> No one feels confortable around it <br>Jupiter is seito kaichou and Mars is the tsundere, Uranus and Neptune are those two guys that never get any development and just stay on the background and just fights over who is best blue</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh I guess I can't argue with that. Poor Pluto-chan, she just didn't have enough mass.</br>  <br>The difference between a planet and a dwarf planet has nothing to do with mass, it's about how much shit similar to the planet there's in its orbit.<br><br>At least read about the things you're trying to discuss<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clear<wbr>ing_the_neighbourhood</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Pic related goes into the whole reclassification kerfluffle in some detail, as well as a lot of interesting stuff about astronomy in general. I thought it was a pretty good read. <br><br>Written by the scientist who's credited with the discovery of Eris.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Disney will sue.</br>  <br>The real, non-discriminatory ranking.</br>  Doesn't Pluto have a bunch of small moons, and one really big one?<br><br>Shame they didn't get a look in.</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, they got the big one in one of the photographs</br>  <br>Uranus always does the SHAFT head tilt.</br>  <br>At least she has enough gravity to capture 5 moons. Take that Earth, and your biased organisms.<br><br>Doesn't having the ability to pull 5 moons in and keep them constitute a form of clearing its own neighbourhood?<br><br> This all shouldn't really matter because we're in /a/ and this thread isn't anime. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they did.

It's actually worse like this.</br>  <br> we <br>who the fuck is "we"? Its just you bitching every fucking night about it nigger</br></br>  <br>They are back to the zero budget and the stick body drawing, for a photoshoot.<br>I wasn't expecting more, but saying I should be grateful for that is quite something.</br></br>  <br><br>Are you saying stick body isn't sexy as fuck?</br></br>  I'm not a huge fan of Rin but I can respect her thighs  <br>I'm saying they should put a minimal effort into drawing them, but apparently it will never happen to Dekoration.<br>I don't even know whether it is because Rika and Miria are lolis, or they overdesigned the clothes and can't draw the girls decently with them on.</br></br>  <br> the stick body drawing <br>The girl has pretty much the same body proportions as Chihaya, what did you expect?<br>Xebec's artistic license?</br></br></br>  <br>They put minimal effort in everything apart from episode 1, the end of 3 and arguably 8, you can't just say it was only Dekoration that got cut.</br>  <br>There are many better thighdols than Rin.</br>  <br>It only makes it funnier that Mika's bust size is only 80, which is pretty much below average in the clusterfuck that is CG.</br>  Gonna put a ring on that trailer trash  <br>At least the BDs seem to fix things.</br>  <br><br>Did somebody say thighs?</br></br>  <br>You know what I mean, and it's not her being flat, though no, her proportions aren't on Chihaya level.<br><br><br><br>They sure put a lot of effort into making Mika look sexy in her photoshoot, or drawing Miku's asses, or giving nice midriffs to Miku and Riina.<br>I don't think I will forgive this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sans-nekomimi Miku is so ridiculously attractive it's not even funny</br>  Which idol's body do you like best?  <br><br>None of the Cinderella Girls even come close, unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>Miku's body is real fine.<br><br><br>Looking at the episodes again I'm really confused by your standards, Mika's photoshoot scene in episode 2 fit the same level of quality throughout the entire episode which isn't impressive, and I can't say much about Miku and Riina since A-1 got their shit together in that episode only to lose it by episode 13.</br></br></br></br>  <br> her proportions aren't on Chihaya level. <br> Chihaya: 72/55/78 <br> Rika: 72/54/75 <br>Even Miria is curvier than the two of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This shit needs to fucking holy shit I'm so fucking mad<br>when did this shit start? 2? 3? years ago<br>fucking butt flaps man.<br>I'm fucking mad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Miku doesn't look as good as Maya in that uniform.</br></br>  <br>Miku is basically a less angry Maya</br>  <br>Rika has a 72 bust size for a much shorter body, and Chihaya has broader shoulders too.<br>Not the same proportions. But that's not what I'm saying either ways.</br></br>  <br>What's your CG favorite, then?</br>  <br><br>But she isn't as scary and doesn't have a cute as fuck sister.</br></br>  <br> butt flaps <br>are you fucking insane mate?</br></br>  <br><br>Look at that fucking picture and tell me it looks normal.</br></br>  <br> Maya k2 <br> Scary <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because she is wearing slutty underwear that doesn't keep her ass in place.</br>  <br> doesn't have a cute as fuck sister. <br>You don't know that<br>She keeps her private life and her work life separate, nya<br><br>ENGLISH?!? cant?<br>how can you fucking</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>shit needs to stop*<br><br><br><br>can you see ass cheeks looking at a girl front on?<br>no you can't<br><br>this shit started like 2 or 3 years ago man.<br>I think I'm going insane, like I'm the only one that noticed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anya is the cutest and sweetest!  <br><br>Preach it</br></br>  <br><br>Ok she isn't as scary when she's K2, but she is definitely cuter than Miku.</br></br>  <br>Anya's animal motif is a cat too, that chain was unnecessary.</br>  <br>Shes wearing a miniskirt, probably wearing slutty underwear that goes all the way up her crack of course her cheeks are gonna stick out.</br>   yurifags will defend this   <br>That's a wolf though<br><br>Was this done by the Saekano mangaka? It looks really similar for some reason</br></br></br>  Who is the most famous 346 idol in the CG universe?    <br>Yes it is.<br><br><br>Probably Kaede and her unit, considering 346 has merchandise of them everywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fell in love with her after the first drama track.<br>Her drunken antics in cool jewelries only cemented her status as my number one.</br></br>  <br>that's a boat though</br>  <br>Where's my Ayane Sakura idol in im@s, Scamco?</br>  <br>346Pro is a hueg company, if anything I'd say Kaede, KWSM, Mayu, Miho, Mika, Akane, Koume, Sachiko and Airi seem to be the Flagship Idols, but there's many many more established (voiced, non-voiced cameo) idols other than the main 14 of the Cinderella Project girls.</br>  <br><br> boat <br><br>Are you also implying Naka-chang can't be an idol?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But that's canon. It happened in the anime.</br>  <br><br>Who should she voice?</br></br>    <br> Ayane Sakura <br>She's got too much under her name, they already have enough A-list VA with Kaede, Ranko and Anya</br></br>  <br>her and KWSM's stint in the Majiawas made me a H@gfag</br>  <br>How do you put Kaede VA in same level with Ranko and Anya, both of them and Ayane Sakura are still new</br>  <br> not posting the best couple <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br><br>Chihaya can't be gay. She's already my wife.</br></br>  <br><br>You both failed to post the best OTP.</br></br>  <br>Not saying it like they're on the same level, but Maaya Uchida and Sumire Uesaka are getting big really fast, and they already had a big lead ahead of the others bar Hayamin</br>  <br><br>They have literally nothing in common, though.

Reminder that Mio is genki done horribly, Rin's personality couldn't be more boring, and that Uzuki is the best girl.  But short hair only fits lewd idols. <br><br>Rin needs something else</br></br>  <br>Of NG? Sure</br>  <br>Well the full version of saihyou is out if it makes you feel any better.<br><br><br>Best in a bad situation there, Uduki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't particularly like Uzuki, but she's easily the best of those three because the other two are so immensely shitty.</br>  <br>Can't wait to destroy that smile etc etc.</br>  I don't want an Uzuki drama arc.<br><br>It'll be too sad. <br><br>What are potential scenarios?</br></br></br></br>  <br> hfw being called cute and sexy </br>  <br><br>Uzuki knows she has to go against Mika in idol/waifu battle, it is inevitable.</br></br>  Just a reminder that Makoto dated P twice<br><br>That is all</br></br>  <br>Makoto is a good girl.</br>  <br><br>It probably won't be that bad, at least she won't compete with 961</br></br>  How many Newtons?  <br>On another note, how many new tonnes did she gain since the first cour?</br>  <br> It probably won't be that bad <br>But this is worse. Kuroi is a cartoonish villain at best. And 961 is clearly portrayed as an "evil" and "enemy" corporation.<br><br>Meanwhile, this Stepmother that has been haunting the trailer is more or less implied to be an upper executive of 346. So if this "Stepmother" figure was to cause shit, it would be an internal conflict. And just imagine, Uzuki finally became a princess of the white castle, and now the queen of the castle is bullying her / asking her to fuck off. The trauma would be destroy her.<br><br>Fucking hell, the preview does not ease my worries. <br><br>- the arrival of the Stepmother is introduced as a stinger after the preview proper (a media technique almost exclusively used by villains)<br>- ominous silence with only the ticking clock<br>- the perpetually cheerful Chihiro sporting a worried face<br>- RAIN. FUCKING RAIN. Rain is the harbinger of doom and drama in im@s. And do you know what's worse? It's raining, AT NIGHT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Enough to make squeezing her more fun.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Threadly reminder that if you like Makoto you are, for all intents and purposes, a homosexual.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really see how this is only Uzuki drama it's foreshadowing and I don't really like it at all.<br><br>The anime was supposed to be about the Cinderella Project getting big, 14 girls who all want to become idols TOGETHER, and are then separated by episode 5 and given small amounts of development in favor of 7 episodes for Uzuki, Rin and Mio. Which all leads to a badly done and lackluster final performance where they just feel like a bunch of misfits tacked together under a single name compared to the Jibun Restart performance in the original anime. Hell the only friendships that were made outside of their units was Ranko with Anastasia and maybe with Minami too. The PV does indeed show some kind of drama shadow falling into the second cour, but I don't see how it won't involve the suffering of the entire project and just Mrs. Ganbarimasu.<br><br>Yes I'm fucking mad, they are all Cinderella, just because one fits the theme better doesn't mean they should get special treatment like the first time. Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody said that it's only Uzuki's drama. All the other girls will have their own issues to deal with and they'll get an episode for that. However the eponymous stepmother will probably have no hand with that. Given the setting it's bad to have one primary "villain" that will torment the others.<br><br>Kuroi was designated as the enemy and his wrath extended to the whole of 765. And admittedly, episodes he played in were actually the worst of the 2011 anime. (Hibiki and Takane episodes nvr4get)<br><br>It wouldn't make sense for an executive of 346 to annihilate one of their own major projects. She'd probably target one or two weak links in her efforts to "improve" it. And on the topic of weak links and bullying material, Uzuki is a prime target. There is also the matter of her being the main red (thus being contractually obligated to suffer alot) and the one befitting the classical cinderella archetype.<br><br>There is more than one kind of Cinderella Story nowadays. It's a thematic framing that has evolved over the years. Everybody is a Cinderella in their own ways, but for Uzuki's case, the classic way of telling it fits her best.<br><br><br> 7 episodes for Uzuki, Rin and Mio. <br><br>I'll give you episode 1, 3 and 6, but episode 2 and 4 were more or less for the project as a whole. Just because NG was the vehicle POV, doesn't mean it was about them. Episode 5 was also about the project but more on Miku's side. And episode 7 was primarily for Producer.<br><br> they just feel like a bunch of misfits tacked together under a single name  <br><br>Because they are. Unlike 765 who had plenty of time working together as idols even before Producer's arrival, the Cinderella Project is literally a bunch of people who don't know each other made to work as idols.<br><br>Jibun Restart is a celebration of the 765 girls finally reaching a breakthrough in their careers after working together for so long.<br><br>GOIN!! marks the first step and grand debut of the Cinderella Project as a united group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GOIN!! marks the first step and grand debut of the Cinderella Project as a united group. <br>You better stop comparing it to 765's performance, or I'll hit you.<br>This wasn't work together, they don't care about each other, they don't know each other, and this will evidently continue on the next cour.<br>So lifeless, so stiff, it's shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was taking your seriously before but it looks like you are one of those purists who put 765 on a pedestal and immediately disregard anything else not 765 as absolute dysfunctional shit.<br><br>Clearly, you hate CG and any attempt to reason with you will fail. So for your own sake, just stop watching CG.</br></br></br>  <br>Most of 2 was about NG specifically Rin and Uzuki getting to know Mio, the other Project characters weren't even introduced until near the end where they get 1 line of their gimmick and it's back to NG being chosen for Mika's concert, 7 wasn't just about Producer too but also about Mio getting out of her funk and Rin getting over whatever the fuck she was sulking about. The others are really getting shafted here outside the lucky few.</br>  <br>Nah, I'm being reasonable. Cinderellas don't know each other and that's it, and they don't care about each other. They work in a cold giant company which doesn't invest in the girls.</br>  <br>This is why vehicle characters are always fucking shit, makes it even worse that they're the most boring of the lot.</br>  <br> but episode 2 and 4 were more or less for the project as a whole. Just because NG was the vehicle POV, doesn't mean it was about them. <br>Episode 2 kind of was, if it were about the Project then they would have been introduced far earlier than 12 minutes in, given more than a line each and would have spent more time showing more of their characters instead of Uzuki, Rin and Mio wasting time and fucking up a simple photoshoot.</br></br>  <br>You keep forgetting that the setting of both groups were drastically different. So your comparisons to 765 are misguided.<br><br>765 is an already established (but unpopular) agency who was already operating with its idols even before Producer's arrival. Naturally, they are already quite well acquainted with each other. And their Producer is an amiable (yet admittedly boring and unreliable) guy. So relationships in the group go rather smoothly.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Cinderella Project is a collection of whackjobs who don't know shit about each other. The foundations of this group are shaky at best and their distant Producer doesn't help at all. The whole first cour is about them warming up to each other.<br><br>Hell, the entire episode before the episode 13 performance is a training camp to grow their teamwork and feel for each other's tempos. And like anon <br> said, the GOIN!! performance is like their debut of finally accepting each other and being able to work as a group. <br><br>  friendships  <br>You act like 765 (in the anime) was depicted to be completely chummy with each other. More often than not, most of them stayed with their peer group.<br><br>In the first 13 episodes of 2011, have you seen Takane hang out with say, Yayoi or see Iori chum it up with Yukiho?<br><br>Naturally, working together for that long, it's assumed to be that they get along, but it's not like they have the time to explicitly depict the friendships with each other.<br><br>Even moreso for the Cinderella Project as they have only been together for a few months at best. Naturally, the first people they get accustomed with are the ones in their sub-units. Admittedly, the same closeness of 765 isn't to be expected yet due to the amount of time together. but it's stupid to assume that they aren't friends or they don't get along. There are plenty of incidental scenes showing them hanging out with each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Meanwhile, the Cinderella Project is a collection of whackjobs who don't know shit about each other. <br>That's my beef, we don't even know that for sure, they said a 3 episode introduction arc of the characters, but instead it's NG all the way through and leaves it to assumption that they were all acquainted with each other while NG was fucking around with the camera following them. The worst mistake was giving the anime vehicle characters.</br></br>  <br>Then I guess I'm a faggot.</br>  <br>gonna make that tomboy blush</br>  <br> they were all acquainted with each other <br><br>They're not.<br><br>Here is where knowledge of the mobage comes in. Most of the Project girls live in different parts of Japan. If you notice, upon starting idolhood, quite a few of them lived in a dorm provided by the agency. It's highly unlikely that were prior acquainted to each other before passing the Audition. Even for the Project idols who live in the Tokyo area (Kanako, Riina, Miria, Kirari and NG), it's still unlikely that they know each other.<br><br>Granted, upon passing the Cinderella Auditions, they might have been attending 346 ahead of time to get acquainted with fellow Audition passers. But this is probably just two or three weeks before NG's arrivals as the special snowflake passers. And that span of time isn't enough to classify the Project Girls as "well-acquainted".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All I ask is that the finale performance be a big group song with both the newbies and veterans.  <br>What if you're a girl and like Makoto?</br>  Soon.  <br><br>Sachiko doesn't have time for this.</br></br>  This is why I hate vehicular characters in stories full of many other potentially intricate characters, but we only learn about the select few vehicle ones. The anime did showcase too much of the NG characters, and that is a common concern for what may happen in the second cour. This, coupled with stupid shit about how the 2nd cour will put Uzuki in the limelight for drama purposes while leaving other characters in the shadows, really doesn't help make anyone else feel confident. It should at least be about the fourTEEN girls, not FOUR girls (NG+Mika), much less about only one.<br><br>So the next time you think to post that stupid copypasta about Uzuki doing an ultimate ganbarimasu to save the day, you better think about how you're pissing off everybody else who has a different taste in idol and is already upset over the 2nd cour's treatment of anyone that isn't NG. Fuck off with your stupid focusing on even just one character, and it's a fucking NG at that. Ganbarifuckyou.</br></br>  <br>I wanna squeeze her cheeks.</br>  <br>Holy shit anon.<br><br>Everybody is talking about Uzuki's arc because she is the Main Red. Whether you like it or not, she is THE heroine and primary representative of Cinderella Girls. Thus, she will accordingly get 2-3 episodes for her. <br><br>Did you fucking flip out when Haruka had her Drama arc in 2011 too? We had 2 episode of Haruka flipping out how 765 was losing its Danketsu and 1 entire episode of Haruka hallucinating and getting healing. That's a whole 3 episodes for Haruka's development. (Not to mention the idolmaster movie was basically HARUKA: The Movie)<br><br>And of course, it's not like it was all Haruka either. Haruka's arc showed the growth of the other idols. But the primary focus was still on her.<br><br>It would basically be the same for Uzuki. She would be the star of that arc, but its not like the other idols will fall to the backseat.<br><br>Besides, you got to learn to accept that an equal representation for an im@s anime that pleases all fans is just impossible. In 2011, alot of girls still got shafted in the most horrible of ways. Nobody likes talking about the Hibiki episode for example, and while amazingly fun, Azusa's episode didn't do much for her character other than establishing that she is an "ARA ARA, I'M SO DITZY" character. Of which most viewers probably already figured out by episode one. Asking for a perfect im@s anime is tantamount to asking for a perfect Touhou or Kancolle anime with equal representation: a goddamn pipe dream.<br><br>Certain characters will end up taking more spotlight. Deal with it.<br><br> I eagerly await the Million Live anime and watch you flip out as Mirai gets the spotlight rather than whoever your favorite ML is. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't compare 2011 Im@s's shafting to Cinderella Girls' "we don't care about half of the girls" crap.</br>  I want to kill her  <br> Blah blah Uzuki heroine <br>Fuck off.<br><br> Blah blah Haruka <br>People didn't like certain characters getting shafted in the 2011 anime either. Don't bring that up as an example to follow you fucking idiot.<br><br>You're just a biased Uzukifag.<br><br> equal representation for an im@s anime that pleases all fans is just impossible. <br>Again, stop using the 2011 anime as an example to follow. It's not. It is possible, it is just lazy and biased storytelling. All you have done so far is said "well, that's what the 2011 anime did!!!" and that's ignorant as fuck.<br><br>Also,<br> ML <br>Nobody cares. Go back to /@/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, you're being blinded by whatever stick you have up your ass. Both series are plenty guilty of alot of things. I honestly love both series, but I acknowledge their failings. But the basis of your hate is on some serious irrational bias.<br><br>Either way, there is no real reason to compare the two. It's a case of apples and oranges here. But whatever, assuming you are the same guy as the above posts with the same sentiments, there is obviously no convincing whatever irrational hatred you have. If you want to have the last word, feel free to reply to this post with a "Whatever you deluded CG fag! CG is shit and doesn't care about its characters! DURR" or something to that effect. If it makes you feel better. It's okay, I'll let you have it.<br><br>Meanwhile, if you want something else to asspain about, have this:<br><br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/1<wbr>4/the-idolmaster-re-arcade-announce<wbr>d-for-smartphone/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We're shoving the Main Reds in your face whether you like it or not. <br> Love, Scamco. </br></br>  <br>Sure sure, you flaming faggot.</br>  <br>CG cares about its characters, but only those who are not Chieri, Kanako, Anzu, Rika or Miria.<br>That's a fact. Im@s 2011 never gave that shit to anyone, not even Ritsuko or Hibiki or Yukiho.</br></br>  <br>Wow, what a cutie!</br>  <br> CG cares about its characters, but only those who are not nonmembers of NG <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> Fuck off. <br><br>Can't deal with the fact that the starring girls of their respective franchise are Haruka, Uzuki and Mirai?<br><br>That's okay. Scamco will keep forcing them in your face until you like them. <br><br><br> Ritsuko <br><br>Hey, QUALITY aside, Ritsuko's episode was one of the best of 2011.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CG only cares about Rin, Uzuki and Mio.<br>The rest is upto which fanbase has the bigger wallet</br></br>  <br>Candy Island episode was good too, but they are still stuck at "who is that girl again" after their episode.</br>  <br>No shit? That's what I have been expressing. I'm clearly protesting the bias. What are you going to point out next, water is wet?</br>  <br> CG only cares about Rin and Uzuki <br><br>FTFY<br><br>If they loved Mio so much, she would've been part of the Absolute Nine CD. Thankfully, they were in the right mind to put in a far superior girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because sukebanfags managed to team up for once to take down the evil quitter, so it was the fans' doing.</br>  <br><br>Takumi is so lewd</br></br>  The fuck is up with all the adult idols? They shouldn't be on the stage and jumping for fucks sake.  Daily reminder Kikuchi Makoto belongs to me.  <br>Oops forgot my name.</br>  <br><br>Literally who.<br><br>Filtered.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not if I filter you first.</br>  <br> http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/<wbr>14/the-idolmaster-re-arcade-announc<wbr>ed-for-smartphone/</wbr></wbr> <br><br>Son, that's a fake.<br><br><br> blah blah bias. <br><br>Whatever entry in an im@s franchise, there will always be a "main" idol that will star the flagship media forgoing. That's just how it is. It's not like they eat up every other media. There are plenty of 765 or CG manga/games that DOESN'T star Haruka or Uzuki. It's just that for a big project like an anime, the designated Leaders/Mascots will get priority spotlight. Thats just how shit rolls. You act like the Reds ruin anything they touch.<br><br>Touhou has a fuck huge cast with massively popular characters, and yet Reimu (and to a lesser extent, Marisa) always ends up taking the lead. Don't tell me you get mad as fuck at that too?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can only rig so much, and Takumi got her place for ranking in an election which is determined by money, taking my last point into account</br>  <br>Actually, we didn't quite get much Uzuki for being a red leader.<br>I hope we'll be getting a bit more of her.</br></br>  <br>Most of Uzuki's screentime in the first cour was actually concentrated on episode 1. We see her making a side comment one or two times per episode but that's about it.<br><br>Then again, Haruka didn't really start making her presence more defined until the latter half of the 2011 anime either. <br><br>So we're about par for course here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is anyone bringing up Touhou here? Touhou != Idols. Am I in /jp/ or some shit?</br>  I really don't care who gets cour focus, I just want a stargazing episode with Anya, where Producer finally mans up and calls her by her nickname instead of just "Anastasia-san"  <br> Don't tell me you get mad as fuck at that too? <br>...What? I couldn't care less about 2hu. Fuck off.<br><br>You seem to fail to make the distinction that yes, I understand how things are, and what I want things to be like. The former is exactly why I'm flipping my shit, and that's exactly what I have been expressing this whole time.<br><br>Do you need a rocket scientist's help to figure things like that out?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mans up and calls her by her nickname <br>That would just be awkward and slightly out of character for TakeP. You as Producer on the other hand is a different story, but that's an in-game thing, we're talking about the anime here. If TakeP does something weird of him like when he tried to talk informally last time, I'm just gonna keep making this facial reaction.</br></br>  <br> http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/<wbr>14/the-idolmaster-re-arcade-announc<wbr>ed-for-smartphone/</wbr></wbr> <br>http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/82<wbr>54829.html<br> LOL </br></wbr></br></br>  <br> that's exactly what I have been expressing this whole time. <br><br>And I've been reiterating the futility of whatever frustrations you have the whole time. Nothing wrong with being mad at things you don't like, but I'm just reiterating facts. The im@s leading characters are here to stay in the spotlight. Especially if it's something big like an anime.<br><br>What I'm focusing on here is you flipping out. You act like the presence of Reds ruin everything there in the franchise but that's hardly the case. There is still plenty of shit to do and enjoy in im@s, Reds aside. Plenty of official media that deals with the other characters. It's not like all CDs have Haruka or Uzuki in them.<br><br>Hell, I'm not even scratching the surface of the fan community.<br><br>Again at risk of using an analogy that you'll probably also dismiss as irrelevant; It's like you're getting mad at Mickey being the lead mascot of Disney, sure he fucking pops out alot whether you like it or not, but it's not like everything else Disney is dominated by Mickey's character.<br><br>You're letting one minor annoyance get the best of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the closest I'll ever see to TakeP bonding with Anya anyway, she had so much exposure but no focus that I'm starting to doubt if A-1 will bother with her anymore</br>  <br> It's like you're getting mad at Mickey being the lead mascot of Disney <br>There's a difference between being a franchise of a company called Idolm@ster and not Uzukim@ster or Redm@ster and then having a promotional recognizable mascot that just gets his own features that usually have his own name in the title. If we were talking about Disney releasing Disneym@ster and then having it be all about Mickey, this would be a different story, if I even gave a shit about Disney in the first place, but I don't.<br><br>This is Idolm@ster, not NGm@ster, Redm@ster, Uzukim@ster, or whathaveyou. And when it comes to promotional material like magazine covers and the like, sure, go ahead and put the postergirls on there, but when it's an anime series where we should be seeing more of the rest of them, it gets to be irritating when the ones others probably like are barely there. Granted, imagine those who don't even have a voiced idol feel, but NG shouldn't need to be shoved in there in the STORY when it's not necessary. Hell, instead of NG being in the audience of the CI episode, why couldn't Kirari be there at least for Anzu? That would have made more sense, even. Instead we get Mio trying to make some kind of dumb analysis which almost comes off as pointing out the obvious and Rin just kind of sitting there and Uzuki being ganbarimasu as usual.<br><br>I'm going to complain and protest no matter what until I see a change in results, and it will never subside just because someone tries to rationalize it as "that's just how it is, deal with it" and even the last part of that sentiment only serves to motivate me even more to complain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I do agree NG whoring is the worst, Uzuki isn't as whored out as Rin, she has been put in pretty much every group album scamco can put her in and uses her for literally every event that goes on both ingame and out.</br>  <br>Wait, you're still talking about Uzuki?<br><br>Fuck. I'm talking about Reds and im@s mascots in general.<br><br>But for the record, Uzuki has been snubbed for most part in the first cour you know? Likewise, just with Haruka, she will get a dedicated arc for her.<br><br>Hope to see you madpost every thread from this week onwards then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, in all fairness, Uzuki did take a bit of a backseat in cour one, but I'm speaking in general that NO character should be spotlighted more than others, or at least if they are, there should be an epsilon of difference. I see that Uzuki saves the day copypasta and it just irritates me that that would probably be the attitude that A-1 actually has and it would totally make my idol, as well as other peoples' idols, just be girls only standing around saying things ike "Where's Uzuki?" and strip them of their personality otherwise or just leaving them to being simple one note characters.</br>  <br>For the record, I'm speaking about this shit below:<br><br> TakeP gets sent out by StepmotherP to menial jobs for other well established 346 idols while she manages the CG's <br> Rin gets TP hijacked, MioHondaTime gets Positive Passion'd <br> Dookie's Gambarimasu levels are dangerously low, goes into silent Despair(TM), main red drama event horizon established <br> Cakes and New Voices contact the remaining CG's wondering about sexymofo TakeP since they haven't seen him since he last supported them at a recent event (cue PreppyP, RockYouP, KimonoP, SportyP, BanchouP, HagswarmProtectionP, GlowstickRaveP, GroomP, etc collage) <br> the lost/runaway Cinderellas re-appear (faces not shown) and apologize to TakeP, also telling them about StepmotherP "brainwashing them" away from him because he was such a newbie back then <br> Chihiro calls him back into the office, tells him about the mising Gambarimonster and other recent StepmotherP shenanigans <br> Egao goes over 9000, Super EgaoJin God TakeP is born thanks to the remaining CG's and takes the glass slipper to Dookie to prep her for end of season live <br> Awakened Dookie saves the CG's concert in episode 24 with S(mile)ING </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never liked it either, another drama ensues because of NG doing shit again, at least Chihaya's problem was linked to Takane to an extent.</br>  <br>You really are focusing too much on NG here and making every incidental appearance of them as a complaint.<br><br>In Ranko's episode, other than Mio's suggestion at the start of the episode, they were mostly background characters. It was Rin who gave TakeP the push, but it was Miku and Kanako who gave the right method to TakeP to get through to Ranko<br><br>NG being in CI's episode was strange so I'll give you that.<br><br>Dekoration's episode was mostly them and Mika. Mio was non-existent and Uzuki and Rin had one or two lines, but the same could be said for any other Non-Deko idol who happened to appear that episode.<br><br>And Asterisk episode was also mostly them, sure NG had one or two lines that episode but just like with the Deko episode, the same can be said for any of the other idols.<br><br>And the big training camp episode, it was focused on them as a whole, most of them getting more focus than NG.<br><br>I won't deny that NG is framed as the main group in the story, but you seem to have a filter in your eyes that make you furious everytime a NG girl appears on screen to the point that you rationalize as THEY ARE FORCING THEM TOO MUCH FUCK.<br><br><br><br>And speaking of the pasta, that was basically a joke from /@/<br><br>It was basically a spawn of a discussion about Haruka being Idol Jesus, how Uzuki was insignificant in the first cour, and how Uzuki will suddenly evolve to be someone surpassing Haruka's<br><br>At one point, somebody just started regularly posting it.

And if the omelette is TP and more Karen for me, then I'm sorry, but something's gotta give. If you're lucky, they either do a double booking or Karen and Nao are a duo unit instead.</br>  <br>By then I knew that was pasta. But it CG is a different beast and it was easier to think of someone as actually being serious about that. Whatever, we'll see what happens then, but I'm going to remain pessimistic.</br>  <br>Her job position dictates horrible things for her unfortunately.<br><br>She'll get over it with Danketsu though.

A new audience wouldn't understand that off the bat, but could easily come to the same conclusion after going through the relevant NoMakes and Magic Hours.<br><br>Probably not the best of ways to handle an anime, but at the same time, there's really just far too much information about each individual girl to sufficiently dispense at a reasonable pace within the episodes proper.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if she were an avid communist <br> post an russian aristocrat <br> in uniform of federal army </br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to marry MInami</br></br>  <br>That was the problem the first time, I viewed these things as just bonus side material that didn't need to be looked at, so I ignored most of them, so when something related to those things happened, I was just like "eh?" It's bad enough I've got little attention span for waiting on and reading the translations for that kind of stuff as well when I prefer some eye candy animation to go with it, and so it just seems like a chore to bother. I would hope they leave it as bonus side material instead in the next cour.</br>  <br> marry Minami <br><br>she's used goods, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not completely unwarranted though<br><br>We do know that it's Minami's first job as leader and even in the previous episode, we've seen that it's been taking its toll on Minami. So her collapsing due of overwork/stress is not a development without proper build up.<br><br>Is it a tad convenient and just a development made to induce tension? Definitely. But at the very least, it's more more thought out than say, Ryuuguu Komachi suddenly being caught in a storm.<br><br>I liked Jibun Rest@rt more than GOIN!!, but holy shit, was making Ryuuguu Komachi get stuck in a storm a way too fucking convenient of a set up and just screams lazy writing that you pull out of your ass at the last moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why was S3 so much worse than S1 and 2?  <br>They were all shit.</br>  <br> Why was shit worse than shit and shit? <br><br>I don't understand.</br></br></br>  The series is moving farther and farther away from the girl that made it worth watching in the beginning.  <br>Why does everybody like her? She appeared for like 1 episode.</br>  <br>Anime original content, its never a good idea.<br><br><br><br>animeonlyfag please, its been years sinse her name even came up in the novels, ashy tits is long forgotten. <br><br><br>faggots trying to be different and like the cunt that no one actually likes to be different.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because they didn't stick to the novel and started to go anime original and they messed up the story heavily especially the last episodes.</br>  <br>Did nothing wrong?</br>  <br>Can you blame retards for doing dumb ass shit that makes no sense and gets them killed?</br>  Because the further you go into it's story, the more DxD tries to pretend it's a shounen, rather than focusing on the T&amp;A people want to see from it in the first place.  <br>Wut? No TNK skips ss3 and goes straight for ss4, they never make ss3 in the first place.</br>  <br>Because DxD is a shitty show designed for -8 kiddos who masturbate to boobteasing and retarded plot, still they try to defend this piece of shit really hard instead of watching/reading something really good.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>They screwd up Koneko's personality</br>  <br>Her what now?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Spot the females or homosexuals in the thread.<br><br><br>People like seeing shameless protagonists in ecchi anime with outgoing girls, but you can only push that so far before it becomes H, so the show had to switch gears and focus on the other elements of the show which is kind of terrible at doing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The anime didn't fuck up a single thing about her. <br><br>Animeonlyfags shouldn't be allowed to comment on why a season that doesn't follow the LN's is bad.</br></br></br>  They tried to introduce an original storyline that was crap and didn't mesh well with the source material.  <br> Assblasted DxDfag trying too hard <br><br>The LN is shit for virgin kiddos, the show is the same shit deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>fun fact: i just didn't like her switch of personality. i dont care if this is based on the LN and it doesn't destroy the entire series for me. Koneko just was my favorite and she is now a different character.</br>  <br>Too much dumb anime original plot, not enough PLOT.</br>  <br>Is it safe to assume you think Shinmai is good?</br>  <br>Reading the OP... Didn't find anything that this thread is about LN/Anime comparision.<br><br>Be free to open your own LNonlyfags-thread</br></br></br>  <br> virgin kiddos <br>They don't impregnate their harem anon</br></br>  <br>Rushed the season.</br>  <br> Didn't find anything that this thread is about LN/Anime comparision. <br><br> Why was S3 so much worse than S1 and 2? <br><br>Main differnce between S3 and the first 2 season IS that it did not follow the LNs, so asking why S3 was bad opens up the discussion of all the content changed/skipped/added in it compared with the volumes of the novels that it was based on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More stupid fights and less tits</br>  <br> fun fact: i just didn't like her switch of personality. <br><br>Her switch is not that intence unless she is in her nekomata mode, she goes from being stoic and emotionless, to being a little less stoic and actually showing emotions for the people in her "family" and Issei, and even then she is WAY less intence about her feelings than all of the other girls.<br><br>Her big changes like i said come in her nekomata mode and when she goes into heat which has yet to happen in the anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  Casanova scans of latest chapter:<br>http://casanovascans.com/read/shoku<wbr>geki_no_soma/en/0/126/page/1<br><br>Extra Chapter<br>http://imgur.com/a/rY6Rd/</br></br></br></wbr></br>  I remember during the elections that Marui commented about the theme dishes for each of the quarterfinal rounds (bento, hamburgers, desserts, and ramen) as being significant<br><br>has anyone theorized what he was referring to? could it be that those are the specialties of the top 4 seats of the elite 10?</br></br>  <br>Commoner food, so basic and popular innovation and expansion is hard.<br> Tsukasa specializes in bento and is selling bento during the festival <br>That would be cute.</br></br></br>  <br>someone else commented on that during the same arc, it's that all of the dishes have a wide range of interpretation so you can get some really weird shit that shows the true personality of each cook. if it was a lot more specific and rigid category, everyone would just have to make variations on basically the same dish.</br>  <br>I think there's more to it than that. ryoko even said that the theme has a huge degree of freedom, which doesn't make expansion hard</br>  <br>Interesting.<br><br>I can see Momo being the desserts expert. Rindo is probably bento. Tousuke is ramen, and Tsukasa is Hamburgers.</br></br></br>  More TLRD spoilers.<br>http://toloverulove.blog121.fc2.com<wbr>/blog-entry-3343.html</wbr></br>  <br>ah, nice, the new spin-off magazine<br>Busy month for yabuki.</br></br>  <br>mikan sucking on a dick as usual</br>   5th grader <br> Able to give paizuri </br>    <br>I think the majority of us want to.
