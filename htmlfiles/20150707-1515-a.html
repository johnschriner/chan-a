I hope you dont plan on actually using it.</br>  <br>wanna sell the mako</br>  <br>Really hope you're not using that.</br>    <br>Just wait for Mako to come out.</br>  I'll ask again. Are these any good? As in the translations and quality?  <br>T-thanks for using my picture, OP.</br>  <br>I would have bought a poster. Skateboard, what is this 1990? May as well put it on those kendama toys that every middle schooler has.</br>  Sorry for taking a bit to respond.<br><br>I'm looking for ~85 USD<br><br>I'd take 50 for her.<br><br>Both have been opened and displayed, but aren't damaged or anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  So much pink!<br><br>And blurry camera phone showing how much I suck apparently.</br></br>   tfw forgot password to NY and couldn't log in to order pic related the whole weekend because of AX. <br>Glad I got one of the last ones at the temporary reduced price. She's a little less popular than Azusa it seems.<br><br>Why the heck is she so cheap on NY though. She's cheaper than even ordering her straight from animaru.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. They hired the translator that did the Baka-Tsuki TLs. It's essentially the same but cleaned up and edited.</br>  <br> cross </br>  <br>WHEN THE FUCK DID THAT MAKO FIG GET RELEASED? I'VE BEEN WAITING ON THAT SHIT FOR AAAGES</br>  <br> not owning a cross <br><br>faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I have these they are good. Sometimes you can't tell if kyon is thinking or speaking but other than that no major issues</br>  <br>Fuck you too!</br>  <br>nice board, i wouldn't use it tho, but i used hookups boards a lot when i was an edgy teenager, loved that decks</br>  My filth arrived  <br>Pre-orders closed months ago, anon.</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>The FBI is probably tracking your every movement right now</br>  <br> KLKfag too retarded to keep up with a figures preorder and release dates. <br>Not surprised.</br></br>  <br>But of course! I invite the agent investigating me over to play poker every Sunday night. Mr B can't hold his booze at all.</br>  <br>Are you from Reddit?</br>  Anyone know if memory foam pillows are sold in daki size? <br>I want to snuggle with my Pochaco in the densest way possible.</br>    <br>cute but that middle one is quite lewd.</br>  Don't know if anyone else has this nendoroid, but this is probably the hardest one to put together with the long hair and all. Is there an easy way for the stand that anyone's figured out?  <br>Skatefag here. Most boards with anime related things on then are shit. Hook Ups board company is kill</br>  <br>That's intentional, they do it in the show too.</br>  <br>It's just a bare navel, thighs and thin panties, anon. What's lewd about those?</br>  <br>when I first saw it, it looked like a dick bulge</br>  <br>Nice.<br><br>Pic is a recent arrival.<br><br>Also, preordered:<br>https://www.melonbooks.co.jp/detail<wbr>/detail.php?product_id=130875</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lewd tbh. I hope you read them in public</br>  <br>Pic related. I had the same board for 5 months and it razor tailed. Also it had a Noice pressure cracked after 4 months</br>  Why would anyone pay for a hardcopy of doujins other than to support an artist they like?  <br> It's just a bare navel </br>  <br>Oh shit, I know that middle one, it's titled like "Thank you very bitch' or something right?</br>  <br>You're my fetish.</br>  <br>Sent you a message on mfc for gouki.</br>  <br>The title reads "The Breasts of the Girl with Short Pants".</br>  <br>She is nowhere near the hardest nendo to assemble.</br>  <br>About how much are you looking for for homu? How is the box condition?</br>  <br>Whoa re you?</br>  <br>Collection purposes, and in the case of doujinshi, it's the only way to get a copy since not every doujinshi gets scanned.</br>  <br> since not every doujinshi gets scanned <br>I hope you are a nice person that scans the doujin he buys that aren't on the net already.</br></br>  <br>Why do people buy art books?</br>  I remember an anon once mentioning how toranoana will switch between regular orders and reservations at specific times. I've figured out that reservations will turn off at 9AM Japan time but does anyone know when they turn back on?  <br>To scan them so I can enjoy them for free.</br>  <br>Why do people buy things?</br>  <br>Why do people buy?</br>  <br>Why do people?</br>  <br>Why do?</br>  <br>Why?</br>  Selling figures, shoot me a PM if you see something you want! I'm getting boxes tomorrow for those of you who have already claimed stuff, so shipping prices will be in then!<br>http://myfigurecollection.net/profi<wbr>le/xYellow</wbr></br>  <br>How much for meido kuroneko?</br>  <br>?</br>  <br>How much for you?</br>  <br><br>While I don't scan every doujinshi I have that hasn't been released (mainly due to lack of time, and that I find scanning/cleaning tedious), I do scan things on occasion.   I've done a few from this pic actually.  </br></br>  <br>How much for everything?</br>  <br>That's mai daughteru and I'm really unsure about selling her, actually.<br><br><br>That's lewd, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good don't sell her, I was just interested in seeing how much you were going to charge for her.</br>    <br>WHY WHY WHY WHY?<br>OH, It's from the show!</br></br>  <br> enuma elish <br> those two Rita doujins <br>I like you</br></br></br>  <br>How much for that magical nia?</br>  <br>How much for Tsukihi?</br>  <br>I would scan every single doujin and manga I own if I could do it without damaging them. <br>I'm tempted to get that book scanner someone posted in the other thread but I'm not 100% sure it's worth it. Seems kinda unstable too. <br><br>I just want to share.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Browse around and see which ones are good.<br>If I owned doujins and mangos I would prefer to scan them so I can read them easily without worrying about wearing out my books.</br></br>  <br>How much for both Nichijou nendies?</br>  <br>I kinda want that shredded one but 8" is titchy. Think I'd get the school girl. What're the shapes like?</br>  <br><br><br> shoot me a pm <br> asks in the thread anyways <br><br>Quit being retards.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This looks like it could work too. One of these days I'll have to go over to Staples or Best Buy and see if they have any on display that I can fiddle with. Seems like it'd be more convenient than trying to get a book to balance on the scanner bed just right.</br>  <br>That thing looks like a toy.<br>I'd be surprised if it were good quality.</br></br>  <br> Hook Ups board company is kill <br>Disappointed. <br><br><br>Was it your second deck or something I get razor tail within a few a weeks and they normally don't last me more than two months because they snap on me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> scanning &amp; damaging doujinshi. <br><br>For me, If I don't feel too strongly about a doujinshi, I won't scan it since I find scanning in general to be bothersome. <br><br>But, If I really like a doujinshi, I might not scan it since I want to keep by book in good condition. On the other hand I feel strongly enough, I'll rip it apart without hesitation (well maybe slight hesitation) since, it's worth scanning and sharing. <br><br><br>That looks pretty neat. Depending on the price/image quality(most important) I might get that. If it makes scanning faster and non-destructive (although it might be since some artwork goes directly into the spine, and you'd have to pry it open anyway) then I'm all for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one I'm considering costs close to $300 so it's pretty average. There seems to be some really nice and big ones, but those cost over a grand.<br><br>Yeah, I don't like touching them too much either. I prefer digital over physical when it comes to reading so it would benefit me too. <br><br><br>I've looked into those for a long time too and honestly none seem to be good enough to produce high quality scans. They seem to have problems keeping things strait and the image quality isn't too nice from what I've seen.<br>You'd have to get one yourself to really test it out, but I don't think it's worth the money and trouble.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Got another fig of my beatiful waifu Rikka</br>  <br>Rikka is shit and also already has a boyfriend.</br>  <br>It was during a leg injury so I'd say maybe 3 of those 5 months weren't skated.</br>  <br>Shit fig.<br>Shit waifu.</br></br>  <br> not cucking yuuta </br>  <br>I just grabbed an image from the first result off Amazon. It only saves in JPEG or PDF, though supposedly it scans at 300, 600 or 900 DPI.<br><br><br> If it makes scanning faster and non-destructive (although it might be since some artwork goes directly into the spine, and you'd have to pry it open anyway) then I'm all for it. <br>Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I have a hard time keeping things balanced on my scanner, which is quite old now. Sometimes I don't dare try to scan something because the binding's too stiff and I want to keep damage to a minimum.<br><br><br> They seem to have problems keeping things strait and the image quality isn't too nice from what I've seen. <br>Most of my scans with a regular scanner end up crooked anyway so that doesn't bother me so much. Sucks about the quality though. I probably won't be buying one for a while, anyway; have other things to get first that take priority.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  filename <br>same</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry but I wouldn't be caught dead with this kind of stuff in public. I'm a lay-low faggot that likes anime and occasional cute girls doing cute things but how can this be socially acceptable to parade outside publicly?</br>  <br>Also got Ryuko while I was at AX</br>  <br>Please scan the Ran Yakumo one. She's been my waifu for like 10 years.<br><br>If you have other Ran ones or foxgirl ones scan those too.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shit taste.<br>I wouldn't be surprised if you overpaid for those shitty prize figures too.</br></br>  <br>And Satsukki</br>  <br><br>How much did you pay?</br></br>  <br>normalfag get out</br>  <br>$20 each</br>  <br>That seems pretty neat. I've had a bunch of stuff I've been meaning to scan, but it is a pain in the ass. I might grab one of those and try it out, since it looks like they're only around $50.</br>  <br>I hope you weren't expecting people to use that board in public.</br>  <br>Just one more thing, and my favorite thing I bought as well.</br>  <br>I kind of agree with him to an extent.<br>Its like gayfags and tattoofags.<br>You're gay? Cool keep it to yourself, no need to let the whole world know.<br>You like MLP? Good for you, fuck off, no I don't want to talk about ponies.<br>These are the type of people that I can't stand, and anime loving faggots who do it are no better than pony fags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've fapped to that pic before.<br>How's it feel knowing the reason her eye is shut is because I nutted into it.<br>Now you know why she wears the eyepatch.</br></br></br>  <br>If you do get one post the results here.</br>  <br>But nobody is fucking talking about this in public. Nobody is forcing you to come into these threads, let alone /a/ of all boards. You don't like figures? Good for you, fuck off. Nobody gives a single shit about your opinion, it's not valued or wanted in these threads or on the board.</br>  Is Polypropylene a good material for posters?<br>Looking to buy these.</br>  To whoever warned me about amazon jp shipping being shitty on the handling, I'm sorry I doubted you. Just got this picture from my roommate who signed for it while I was away, I hope there's no damage to the books.  <br>Of course. Probably going to hold off and see if it goes on sale during Amazon's prime day thing.</br>  <br> on the board </br>  <br>This. Most anime boards are for show. Even Hook Ups don't last long</br>  <br>Jesus buying from Amazon jp is like playing Russian roulette. Luckily I've never had one turn out this bad. <br>Be sure to leave feedback about packaging. Maybe if enough people bitch about it they'll use something better.</br></br>  <br>Why do you all hate on my waifu so much?</br>  <br>It wouldn't be so bad if their boxes were sturdy enough to withstand the weight of books. In that picture it looks incredibly flimsy. So far I haven't had trouble with light things like BDs and CDs.

I'm just not getting why they'd be bootleg. That would be weird, though.</br>  1 more week  <br>They even made it out with my name.

Here are my general reasons.<br><br>Legitimate covers:<br>-Unlicensed doujin art sold only at Comiket or commissioned at Toranoana<br>-AJ two-way tricot material<br>-Retails for around 12,000 yen<br><br>Kinokuniya x Animate covers:<br>-Same art<br>-Peach skin material<br>-Sold for 40 USD<br><br>Some covers included exclusives that were sold only on one website and limited to 100 pieces. There is no way it would go for 40 USD at some convention in the United States.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I mean, plenty of official covers have been on shitty smooth knit and sold at low(er) prices. But yeah, if it's the same design as some exclusive then it's definitely a bootleg. That is strange.</br>   get dio fig <br> face where he grins has defects <br>Damn it.</br></br>  <br> -Peach skin material <br>Confirmed bootleg</br></br>  <br> -AJ two-way tricot material <br>There are other makers besides AJ, you know. And comiket is just a fraction of what comes out, plenty of covers are done through mail order or other events (like ore no yome). I know what you mean, but it's a bit misleading.</br></br>  <br>Yes, and Maxima.</br>  I just got a couple of Dragon Ball figures in today, Goku and Gyūmaō. I'm amazed that Japan can sell these figures so cheaply. American equivalents at these prices (Funko Pop! for instance) are pieces of shit. Gyūmaō is especially impressive. It's incredibly solid and has some great detail and paint apps.  <br>Reasonable.</br>  <br>You already posted this exact post in the other thread.</br>  <br><br> all that shit taste <br><br>please off yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one replied  :( </br>  Is it possible to recover from the slope without quitting cold turkey?<br>Like, just buying shit from time to time.</br>  <br>wait a minute I seem to remember seeing a pic of the gun wielding Bulma post-hotglue session</br>  <br>Not mine. It's a cheap figure though, so it wouldn't suprise me.</br>  <br>You sure it wasn't yours?</br>    <br><br>It's actually what would anyone pay for a prize on release.<br>Prize figures usually retail for 1.5k~, add 1k from RSAL (and the 500 yen fee from Manda if you ordered there) and you end up with 2.5/3k, which is $20/25.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty pissed I missed the sketch sessions.</br>  Are you a fan of cotton candy?  <br>I can't handle all these new translations</br>  <br>DEFEND YOUR TERRITORY</br>  <br>She really didn't seem like the jealous type from the cover page art, thought she would be a standard airhead, and nothing else.</br>  <br>She might be an airhead, but she's British airhead and she's that stubborn bulldog attitude buried beneath all that cotton candy.</br>  Today's chapter  <br>I want to poke her in all the right places.</br>    Might as well dump the latest batch.  <br>Smug Misuzu is the best Misuzu.</br>    <br> Do what you must, I have already won </br>  <br><br><br>She really is.</br></br></br>  <br>He totally wants the T.

Foreign airheads are always American, valley girl types.</br>  <br>Nice try  faget </br>  <br>It's the most obvious bait imaginable</br>  <br>I know, it's been like this every year.<br>But summerfags never actually go away, they just continue to shit up the board year round</br></br>  <br>One day somebody will seriously post shit like that and everyone will think they're trolling</br>  <br>Eternal September</br>  <br>Now I'm curious how many reps and how many sets she does, which would tell us what she's lifting for.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127690028   <br>Karate. I don't know what kind of workout she'd need for that. Who /fit/ here?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127689863 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127689642 <br>MODS<br>MODS<br>MODS<br>MODS<br>MODS</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your ability to crop leaves much to be desired.</br>  <br>Not from /fit/ so I don't know what they'd think of it, but for the martial arts I did, my teacher told me to do low weight high reps. Got kind of funny looks using a 5 pound dumbbell, until people realized I was doing sets of 100 at fairly high speed. Mine was weird old chinese stuff though, not karate.</br>  So what will it be like when Tomo finally wins the Jun bowl?    <br>The manga will end.</br>  <br>One chapter dedicated to him confessing to her on their way home form school.<br>The next chapter dedicated to her staring at him, the blush getting more intense as she catches on to what he said.<br>The last chapter will be her saying she loves him too and they walk home together not hand in hand though because that's too embarrassing right now.<br>It will be beautiful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A no holds barred fist fight will turn into shagging somehow</br>  <br>High impact sexual violence.</br>  <br>10/10 would read over and over again</br>  <br> is that how they do it in Britain? <br>Inch'allah m8</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Implying he hasn't already cracked and glued the pieces back together again several times over by now. <br>The man is seriously desperate to preserve their current state of affairs.</br></br>  So...Tomo, Misuzu or British? and why?  Misuzu &gt; Tomo &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shit &gt;&gt;&gt; The British slag  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  <br>BAKA!</br>  <br>There will be no confession, they will merely be at home, fighting each other and throwing punches until they suddenly rip off each other's clothes and engage in furious angersex before they even realize what they're doing.</br>  <br>Misuzu.<br>So much sexual tension every time she talks to Jun.</br></br>  <br>Tomo and Jun are best couple, but Misuzu is best girl.</br>  Fuck everyone already with muh sexual tension. There's no sexual tension between Misuzu and Jun. It's just banter.  Is this any popular in Nippistan? Any chance for an adaptation?  <br>Anon, if two people of the opposite gender aren't all over each others' genitalia then it's obviously because they want to fuck really badly.</br>  <br>So the manga is a contest between Misuzu trying to crack Jun via Tomo and Jun trying to maintain his act regarding Tomo? Nice.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're having some sexual tension with /a/.</br>  <br>Only if it gets published like Danna ga nani</br>  <br>I want Tomo and Jun to get together, them to have a drunken threesome in college that leads to a short ménage à trois before they go back to how they were before.</br>  <br>I guess you're right. There's no plot to speak of an scenes are rather short.</br>  <br>Even if it is popular, there's no enough material to adapt properly. Out of 100 chapters you have enough material for maybe one 24 minute episode.</br>  I guess it could be an anime if they adapted around eight chapters into two minutes episodes. Like Teekyuu.  <br>My DICK.</br>  <br>You have to admit, if this was a different manga with no Tomo and just these two, everyone would be obsessed with the inevitable hate fucking.</br>  <br>Banner potential.<br><br>Mos tof Misuzu and Jun's panels together are actually.</br></br></br>  so does jun like her but doesnt think she likes him/doesnt want to ruin their friendship or is he just dense mc and doesnt realize she likes him or that he likes her.  <br>I think he's starting to like her but doesn't act on it in case it ruins their current relationship.</br>  <br>Probably as he got older he developed feelings and is trying to suppress them to not ruin the greatest friendship he has ever had. I don't think he is dense and understood what tomo meant but he didn't want to risk it.</br>  <br>Read </br>    <br><br>I have no idea what you expect that anon to do. I don't think you understand how cropping works.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sometimes, in panels like these, it looks like Misuzu's scrunchy is actually her hand. Like she's holding it up and doing a scratching motion, as if she's pretending to be a catgirl.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love to see some Tomo related banners</br>  <br>They could have changed the width of the window before taking the screenshot.</br>  <br>That's true. Still, I don't mind the picture as it is anyway.</br>  HERE'S WHAT  I think  HAPPENED.<br><br>Jun fell in love with her back since when they were kids, but she was too dense to notice/care about that. He confessed and she did the same shit he did (I love you too bro!). Feeling bad/guilty about potentially ruining his good friendship with her because of his selfish desires, he promised to never see her as a love interest again.<br><br>What's your theories?</br></br></br></br>  <br>i want her to push me down and wrap my dick in tomo's spats and jerk me off but squeeze and stop me from ejaculating whenever i get close until it becomes unbearable and she makes me beg her to let me cum where she finally gets me off by stepping on my dick.</br>  <br>My favorite part about this manga is seeing how far can Misuzu go in breaking Jun and what's the next childish act that Jun will do to make her shut up.<br><br>Saying shut up, pushing her in the rain, scrunchie throw, forehead flick. Bringing her face close like that is just asking for it.</br></br></br>  Fucking britfags.  <br>And Misuzu actually likes Jun but loves Tomo too much to step in but instead is doing what she can to drive them together since it is obvious to her Jun and Tomo's true feelings.</br>  <br>I like it.</br>  <br>They're all bakas.</br>    <br>Misuzu is actually in love with Jun but realizes she never had a chance since Tomo is so close to him. She got over it in due time but Jun's continued naivety regarding Tomo's feelings triggers her own guilt and insecurities, which is why she's so passive aggressive with him.</br>  <br>tfw you will never have tomboys falling for you ;_;</br>    <br>How many raw chapters are out?</br>    <br>Stop posting that in every thread<br><br><br>I would a Misuzu but my heart belongs to Tomo</br></br></br></br>   try to don't be too lewd   <br> 91 </br>  Jun loves Tomo but because Misuzu is trying to set them up he doesn't want to "lose" to Misuzu. Misuzu actually loves Jun and she is cucking herself.  <br>The proper term is britbong, anon</br>  <br>  I'm actually gay <br>  :D ? </br></br>    <br>I CAN DO IT<br>I CAN DO IT NINE TIMES</br></br>  <br>Not cool man</br>  <br>And now the wait begins.</br>  <br>At this point my guess would be something along those lines. Jun obviously likes Tomo, but he doesn't want to ruin their BFF relationship and so to stifle his desires tries to convince himself as hard as he can that Tomo is a guy. The reason he's so terse with Misuzu is because she's constantly trying to break his resolve.<br><br> Also Misuzu likes Jun but is repressing it for the sake of her friend. Her relationship with Jun's friend will kick off when he realizes this and starts teasing her about it. </br></br></br>  <br>Part of me hopes the scanlators will keep releasing in batches of ten so that these threads actually have purpose.</br>    <br>I can smeel the bloodbath from here<br><br><br>New chapter fucking when?</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>I really really need to know the reasons behind this "Misuzu loves Jun", i just don't get it</br></br></br>  <br>Delusional headcanon because they just want them to fuck.</br>  <br>L-lewd</br>        <br>The best friend who plays wingman while secretly liking the one they're trying to help their friend get with is a fairly common archetype. Doesn't mean it's true here, but that's why people keep bringing it up.</br>  <br>Why you didn't do these one for the latest chapter of Nisekoi? Goddamn it anon</br>    <br>Because the way Misuzu is so hostile and teasing to Jun exudes some sort of underlying frustration. The fact that the three of them are childhood friends makes it a strong possibility that Misuzu also had a crush on Jun at some point. She seemed to be demure and girly and could have been attracted to Jun's rough and tumble personality.<br><br>While Tomo and Jun's relationship is adorably awkward, Jun and Misuzu's is more dark and spicy for lack of a better simile.</br></br></br>  <br>How lax is the dress code in that high school?</br>  <br>We Nozaki-kun and Isshuukan Friends now</br>  <br/>      <br>Heyyy, nice too see you here satan.<br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br>  <br>Real talk, broccoli really didn't do anything wrong and I was genuinely surprised to find out how /a/ reacts to that scene after I read it.</br>  <br>I agree, he didn't. Kurosawa should have done something about his crush on Takigawa. It's his own fault he lost her to Broccoli.  I was happy when he started dating the bully. </br>  <br>RULES OF NATURE</br>  How many chapters have been translated? The place I read it from has them group together like 1-10 is together, but it's only 10 pages which seems off to me.      <br>Because it feels like NTR, even though it isn't.</br>  <br>I assume both of you are talking about that manga where the guy with afro gets a girlfriend and the girl teased the hell out of MC, if not then i don't know</br>    <br>90 chapters out of 91. Its a daily webcomic, every chapter is a single page. The batches of 10 were the translators catching up with the backlog</br>  <br>Ah, thanks. It just seemed odd that each chapter was 1 page.</br>  <br> New chapter fucking when? <br>Not soon enough</br></br>    <br>Guess its time to wait for another half-year to see a new one</br>   Thread dies upon revelation that TLs are caught up.   <br>Why does this only happen to the best manga?</br>  <br>Dont forget the 10-days wait for another dump<br><br><br>It hurts to live</br></br></br></br>  <br>How often is it updated anyways?</br>    <br>It updates every day until caught up to the manga. The manga does a page. At best, once caught up we will get a chapter every week and a half</br>  <br>It's weird to see /pol/'s Arabic improving.</br>  <br>Every day, but since posting 1 page every day is kinda dumb we wait for at least 10 days</br>  <br>Read the scanlator's website.</br>  <br> Dont forget the 10-days wait for another dump <br>Have they confirmed how often they'll be TL-ing it?</br></br>  <br>I see it too</br>  <br> the girl teased the hell out of MC <br>But she didn't.<br>They were book buddies, nothing more, all the teasing was in his imagination.</br></br></br>  <br>See: </br>  nigga wtf  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br> wtf </br>  <br>I need some hints about that manga to read it, please anon<br><br><br>There's powerful niggatry at work here</br></br></br></br>  All this tomboy love.

My dick has never been this hard from all this sexual tension</br>  <br> whom <br>nope</br></br>  <br> Yes <br> She'd hate it, and Jun would laugh at her, causing poor Tomo to throw the cat ears and collar down out of frustration. She would cry adorable tomboy tears </br></br>  <br>misuzu</br>    <br> She's got HUGE...personality. </br>  <br>Is she really defenseless?</br>  <br>I feel like girls with small breasts being self-conscious about it is the one trope in anime/manga that will absolutely never die</br>  <br><br>She would be the worst possible person to ask though</br></br>  <br>An accredited university in Texas.</br>  She likes it.  <br>That's like saying the trope of people worrying about money will never die. Its a trope for a reason, it commonly happens in real life and most people (even those not afflicted with it) can relate to it</br>    <br>As much as I hate it and wish more anime girls would be proud of their DFC, you're right. It's too common in the real world for it to die. Maybe if flat became stylish again, but I doubt it'll happen.</br>  <br>But it's not like the vast majority of anime or manga creators can relate to being a girl with small breasts, or like the vast majority of the audience can either. I think it's just more of a cute thing that is thrown into every series because it's been done a thousand times before and no one's complained yet.</br>  They're probably gonna kiss and fuck without officially confessing. Like one day after a sparring session at the dojo the two find themselves inexplicably grappling, then Jun starts smelling her  <br>I complain about it. Girls should celebrate the beauty of flatness.</br>  What would you have done if she said this to you?      <br>Push her into the rain.</br>    <br>stuff her in a closet and jam the door so she couldn't get out</br>  <br>Just suki.<br><br>Daisuki is a little weird, doesn't usually mean romantic like.</br></br></br>  post yfw NTR  <br><br>Steal her hair scrunchy and not give it back</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=B4b<wbr>XaBIwQV4</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>unzip my dick</br>  <br>fuck off micchy you got ntr'd by a god</br>  <br>Show her this picture and say that she's destined to be with this goofus.</br>  <br>Unfortunately we went in the wrong direction of your ideal.

The fact that in the future I'll be able to bang anime girls at any time is actually one of the things motivating me to keep going in life.</br>  <br>I'd drag her to a pool and stuff her long hair in the pool drain, she would be stuck and then she would drown.</br>  <br>Why do you want to bully the Tomo you horrible horrible person?</br>  <br><br>Can't be because Naoto is obviously by far the superior tomboy</br></br>    <br>No, I want flatchested girls to bully the Tomo.

It just feels as if there's something personal to her attacks at Jun. The next closest person she showed her 'dark' side to, was to Tanabe and that was when he was trying to interfere in Tomo and Jun's life. Call it delusional shipping, but there is just has to be something going on between Misuzu and Jun. Maybe it was a failed confession, or a rejected childhood romance, or even stood up at their promised meeting, but it just feels as if there is something more than a simple dislike between the two.</br>  <br><br>I'm not even about shipping, I just want her to be able to sometimes join in with Jun and Tomo for sex when she finally gets them together</br></br>  <br> You will never cuddle with Chie on the couch while watching Kung Fu movies after a big steak dinner </br>  <br><br>You realize you're going to have to cook that steak dinner, right?</br></br>  <br>I just wanted you to know anon, I got your reference.

If it doesn't taste good with just that, you need to get better quality steak.<br><br><br>On the off chance that anyone involved in this conversation isn't just trolling, it's not blood like what comes out from a cut, it's just a watery fluid, transparent and tinted red. Some people sop it up, others just ignore it, either way, the main attraction is the steak, not the blood, unlike some european dishes I could mention.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I-It's not gay if balls don't touch, Jun-kun <br> But you're a g-girl </br></br>  So what's the verdict on the new girl?<br><br>Also OP because it keeps getting taken down:<br>http://galax.moe/</br></br></br>  What will Hajime teach us this season?  <br>I need to see more of her. Now she's kinda meh since she's basically Hajime2.<br>I hope Gel-chan will be also developed into something more than moeblob.<br><br>While I understand the concept of real life OP I would so much prefer something in the style of first 15s.<br>And at the end when they all land it should be O.D. landing last. Shit is literally "We apocalypse now" and "The Angel of Death/ God descents"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also that fucking moment Joe gets out of the portal and fights JETS</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lzJ<wbr>9fr0uC-s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>She's similar to Hajime but not an exact replica. She can actually display emotions besides happiness.</br>  <br>Well, in the original series Gel Sadra was an artificially aged villain, so she's bound to develop into something, but on the other side we have X, so who knows.</br>  <br>Whats the deal with this site? What does it log into?</br>  Cthuko subs where?  <br>Does anyone have a sound webm of the first OP?</br>  <br>People trying to make sense from OP/ED words when?</br>  <br>as soon as you time it for them https://twitter.com/valerauko/statu<wbr>s/618089191646232576</wbr></br>  /a/ seriously needs more gloom    <br>This image makes me gloomy</br>    I like her.<br><br>She's Hajime with the inability to properly express emotions replaced by HOTBLUD.</br></br>  <br> So what's the verdict on the new girl? <br>Chris and Rosalie managed to create their own daughter. I love it. She's a great character. The ufo can go home for all I care though.</br></br>   tfw still no GALAX   More self-aware internet comments when?  <br> there will never be a mass social media that directs people to their best ran by a cute trap </br>  Gel is obviously the final boss; Hajime will befriend her at the end, though. <br>Tsubasa isn't all that much like Hajime; Tsubasa is supposed to be very aggressive, impulsive and temperamental. Tsubasa always lets her emotions get the better of her and changes moods pretty quickly. Her Gatchaman suit is the ULTIMATE COMBAT suit designed specifically for fighting and has super-speed, super-strength and energy beams.</br>  <br>Where'd you get the thing about her suit being like that? I get the hot-blooded part but I'd be surprised if her suit doesn't involve something related to fireworks.</br>  <br><br>Working on it</br></br>  I still need to finish the first season, I don't even remember why I stopped watching.  <br>I don't remember why didn't I pick it up when it aired but when I marathoned it, it became one of my favourites from that year. Good music can make any show likeable, and this season has even better characters (Tsubasa) so I have really high hopes for it.</br>  <br> Rui's tablet. </br>      Laughed more than I should.  I like her.  <br>It's on the official site.</br>  <br>I love her voice. She should be in most shows not hanashit.</br>    <br>Gatchaman crowds: in thighs</br>  Just came here to say that the ED song is awesome. Bye.  <br>The episode needed more Ruirui.</br>  <br>He has both a crowd and a gatchasuit...how does that work, I thought they were the same thing?</br>  <br>Her thighs are too big, they look weird</br>  <br>Crowds is his power, the suit is a suit.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=u_z<wbr>t-drliJU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yes, yes, but aren't they both a manifestation of his soul?</br>  <br>The crowd is part of his note power.<br><br>The soul-note reflects what the person wants. Rui wants everyone to be heroes, so he can empower other people by making them crowds. He's a Gatchaman though.</br></br></br>  <br>his note is called codec and crowds note, so it seems he can switch the modes?</br>  <br>But why? It's clear in this universe, JJ saved Saya and turned her into an actual little girl. What more do you want?</br>    <br>best girl</br>  <br>he's actually a boy</br>    please wear clothes utsutsu  <br>Any idea who the artist is? I don't remember that in the OP or anywhere else.</br>  <br>is hilarious how in the intro she uses the same duck backpack which hajime used on S1<br><br>I hope also she uses twinbraids more often</br></br></br>  Who is hotter, Hajime or Tsubasa?  <br>utsutsu</br>  <br>She's a slut, sluts aren't hot</br>  <br>sorry, but you´re dick disagrees</br>  <br>Hajime, pantyhose wins.</br>  <br>Hajime. Tsubasa is a very close second but she has short hair<br>and she's not the original Hajime.</br></br>  Didn't care for her or the episode itself. Hopefully it gets better<br><br><br>Give them about 2 to 6 months</br></br></br>   same VA <br>Tusk is now living inside Hajime´s hajimes. Lucky bastard.</br>  <br>what´s the problem with short hair? on looks I'd choose Tsubasa over Hajime, but Hajime's voice and personality makes her hotter</br>  <br>Katze, you faggot. There is no other answer. Hajime is too accepting and Tsubasa too underdeveloped at this point.</br>  <br>Nothing BAD with it per se, but I just like long hair. If Hajime had more midriff and slightly longer hair she'd be absolutely perfect.</br>  Red alien best girl.  <br> loli <br>No thanks</br></br>  <br>2cute<br><br>i really hope she is the villain<br>BANE is not enough for me after Berg Katse</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked the first season but after watching episode 00 and 01, I have no idea what the fuck is going on. <br><br>New gatchaman, random alien girl, emote clouds over head, evil glasses guy, Red crowds. so much, too much....iono go Bird.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Katze and Paiman know her she's in all likelyhood older than you</br>  <br>It's simple. VAPE are going to fight a marketing war with the gatchaman for the prime minister seat. The red loli wants everybody united so she's going to manipulate everyone until Tsubasa finds inner peace and a grey emote cloud and saves the day.</br>  <br>But where do these things come into play?</br>  Utsutsu and Rui are best girls hands down  new girl is hot too but I don't know how to feel about her yet   <br> rui <br> girl </br></br>  What do you think anon? Is this accurate?    <br> climbing all over shit <br> look like idiots <br> red white and blue <br>insight confirmed for anti-american</br></br></br></br>  <br> origami reddit <br>I don't know what this means.</br></br>    <br>This. <br>I rally hope we get to hear that wild laugh of his again.</br></br>      <br><br>This is better.</br></br>  <br>If it looks cute, stick your dick in it anon. Don't question</br>  I'm going to post this every day until you like it.  I HATE IT  I want to stick my fish in between her tits.

I was the only one that could work on Sunday, and after a while I had to do it right there.<br>No I didn't use the work PC or the work network, I'm not that stupid.<br>Anyway, shit was really damn good.</br></br> </br>    <br> I once fapped at work in the toilet while taking a shit, then it became a habit <br><br>It was inevitable</br></br></br>  <br> I considered fapping in the toilet. But I did it WHERE I work, in front of my desk. After I came I wondered what the fuck did I just do. </br>  <br>There isn't a wrong choice to make.</br>  <br> That feeling of regret after you fap at work <br>You learn to live with that</br></br>  <br>Always Sento.</br>  <br> I once fapped at work after everyone left for the day, real late, like 9 PM. When I jizzed, I shot my load into the bottle of hand cream that belonged to a hot coworker she kept on her desk and then shook it up. I got massively hard the next day watching her use it </br>  <br>Dirty dirty Earth fairy, straight up the butt, no condom.</br>  <br>I did this and have no regrets.</br>  <br>This one. These are some good breedin hips</br>  <br>Damn, legit creepy,yo.</br>  <br>What if  she actually knew and used it anyway </br>  <br>Light novel material right here.<br> My co-worker can't be this lewd! </br></br>  <br>Why does she have a thing of water in her mouth?</br>  <br>Let her pretend to be a dude and she'll pay you.</br>  Beware the breast beast.    <br><br>As I found out from another Anon, they don't always update the site as soon as they update the reader.</br></br>  <br> O-onee-chan? </br>  Evil Chitose...<br>How did this happen? I can't remember where this came from.</br>    Trunks is surprisingly really tall  <br>have you noticed that trunks looks like a younger Dr. Briefs?</br>  <br>Are you inblying vegeta got cucked?</br>  <br>He's probably getting his first pre-puberty growth spurts.</br>  Why is he such a shit father? Literally getting super excited about abandoning his family.  <br>Do you not know how babby is made</br>  <br>Confirmed for dying on purpose</br>  Also notice how Trunks and Bulma have the same back-of-the-head<br><br><br>He's always excited about training. They love him anyway. Somehow.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah i thought so too, I think that it is kinda cool that he takes after his grampa<br><br><br>No he just implies that he looks like his grandfather.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems about right. Although Krillin definitely lost a foot in Super.</br>  <br>I'm sure he'll visit. They all know it's his favorite thing to do and let it slide. Even Chi-chi chilled out on him. He just needs to make sure he stops by regularly for some father/son bonding and to  Make love with his Chinese Princess of a wife.  </br>   yfw GT is canon in the 6th Universe     is this canon or is it like GT? Who know if toriyama is behind this or not ?  <br><br>same as bulma's dad too</br></br>  <br>Think we'll get any episodes focused on Chestnut's family?</br>  <br>you need to get your eyes checked anon i still see 2 feet on krillin</br>  <br>I can't imagine that being much fun.<br><br>A Kame House episode is necessary.</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama is doing the plot<br><br><br>I believe that will be 3rd episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats how Kame seinin leveled up for fighting Freeza's goons. he had to constantly avoid getting beaten by eighteen for his perverted antics.<br><br>there I just gave you an episode</br></br></br>  <br>wait maybe 18 grew?<br><br>she looked tall in the Super OP image but here she's shorter</br></br></br>  Will the third chapter of Kamehasutra ever be translated from Portuguese?<br>Will PBX start making new DragonBall stuff again?</br>  <br>Man imagine how hard it is for Krillin to get laid with perverts like Roshi and Oolong around all the time. Not to mention turtle and Maron.</br>  <br>Shit man. Krillin really robbed the Cradle if 18 is still having growth spurts.</br>  <br>Goten also seems shorter if compared to DBZ. Is it just me?</br>  <br> SSJ4 Goku vs SSGSS Goku. <br>TORIYAMA PLZ</br></br>  <br>Toriyama (and his assistants) were never consistent with height. Vegeta and Frieza constantly changed in the OG manga and series.</br>  <br>its his fault. after the 21st budokai he asked if he could stay at the Kame house for a while longer. that while turned into 30 some years</br>  <br>some anon claimed it wasn't toriyama who was doing the plot. How is this "Canon"? Does the manga follow the anime or is the anime who is following the manga?</br>  How do you go from faggy kid with a bowl cut to glistening Adonis?    Anyone else afraid this new series will be too child friendly? I feel like DBZ is too mainstream now to get away with some of the violent/racy things it got away with in the past.  <br>Nobody is having kids. There are no children in Japan anymore to cater to.</br>   there are actually people who haven't dropped this childish dogshit already   <br>yeah I miss the days when dragon ball wasn't mainstream way back in alternate universe B5</br>  <br>Roshi's basically like Krillin's grandpa at this point. He probably wants to live with his family. Plus there's no rent.</br>  <br>this doesn't answer my shit nigga</br>  <br><br>I think ever since the Buu saga was made, Toriyama had wanted to get back to the roots of Dragonball (more lighthearted, less "epic" fights). That's not to say DB fights weren't good, but they didn't have as much violence as DBZ. I'm thinking Super will probably be similar to the Buu saga in terms of silliness.</br></br>  <br> posting kumiko </br>  Is GT worth a watch even if it's not canon? I always avoided it.  me and my gf loved the first episode  <br> there are actually people who just enter the thread to shitpost and post smug moeblob faces <br>love this place. Stay mad faggot :^)</br></br>  <br>The last episode</br>  <br>It has an amazing ending, and some fun scenes here and there, but no. It's mostly a pain to watch</br>   Haruhichan still has no episode releases <br><br>send help</br></br>  Are Dragon Ball Minus and Jaco the Galactic Patrolman canon?  <br>Yes.</br>  I love Satan's jap voice, his voice is a lot more heroic.  <br> Gf <br>You sound like a   Well rounded individual  </br></br>  <br>Please anon... it hurts.</br>  <br>The show was always child friendly anon</br>  <br>Yeah, I hate mainstream stuff. Hope Dragon Ball never becomes mainstream.</br>  <br>I have very recently watched GT. Solely out of morbid curiosity<br><br>It is really bad. Like I seriously cannot fathom how it was made. <br><br>A few episodes in, you'll understand why it was unpopular in Japan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking source<br>I swear to god if it's taken out of context like the golden frieza 1 billion joke im gonna cap a bitch</br></br>  <br> I feel like DBZ is too mainstream now  <br> Too mainstream now <br> Literally the most popular manga before One Piece <br> Survived for over 18 years on video games and nostalgia alone <br> Got a new series because of two really popular movies <br> Too mainstream now </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's joking anon.<br><br>Toei will really never revisit GT. It only lives on in video games</br></br></br>  <br> A few episodes in, you'll understand why it was unpopular in Japan <br>Nigga, GT was one of the best-selling series in Japan back in the 90s. It outsold Dragon Ball and DBZ.</br></br>   tfw only one decent chi chi figure   <br>Toriyama pretends it doesn't exist ond so should you</br>  <br> 1 billion <br>You calling Frieza a little pussy bitch, faggot?</br></br>  I don't know why but i loved the part where piccolo was watching over Gohan and Videl.<br>He cares so much</br>  <br>Is that why its ratings were in the toilet<br><br>GT has higher sales because it actually had a home release in Japan. Unlike Z which didn't get one until years later</br></br></br>  Super will never have anything as epic as this  <br> epic </br>  <br> epic <br>Also, like all Fusions, it was another anticlimax</br></br>  <br> yfw when you realize Gogeta was a super saiyan god </br>    <br>Post-Cyborg Apocalypse is a helluva drug.</br>  <br>The wrestle mania voice fits so perfectly though. English is better hands down.</br>  <br>Being one of the 5 people who actually enjoyed GT i'd be every happy.</br>  <br>you'll cry at the end, calling it now.</br>   First episode is filler <br> People waited 20 years for this </br>  <br>Am I the only one who hates Bulma's current hairstyle? Even the shit she had in Cell saga was better than this.</br>  <br>I hated that this version of trunks was never a costume in any game. It's his coolest outfit/version</br>  <br>What's the purpose of that jacket?</br>  <br>Slice of life DB is best DB.</br>  <br>What're the odds of us getting great saiyaman Videl in Super?</br>  <br>Didn't teenage Videl hate girly stuff? Why did she become full waifu by DBS?</br>  <br> Drunk saiyaman in BOG <br>I could see Gohan running around as Saiyaman in Super. <br><br>but Videl being fun? Shes WAY too waifu tier now to do something cool like that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>to look cool?<br><br>What's the purpose of half the outfits in anime</br></br></br>  <br>Bad. Videl is just a background character now because Toriyama is determined to make his show waifu-free.</br>  <br>so in the manga, the aliens tried to poison beerus and he told him no poison could take him down. Then he blew up everyone &amp; the planet<br><br>in the anime, he said it (the food) was too fat and not good for him, so he only blew up half the planet.<br><br>Nice one Toei</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why the hell did Gohan drop the helmet? He looks dumb without it and clashes with Great Saiyagirl's costume.</br>  So they're getting married because she's pregnant right?  <br>Trunks is older than Goten.</br>  <br>Future Trunks was always the best. I wish we would get more of him.</br>  <br>Bulma said it wasn't cool</br>  <br>He dropped the helmet because he wanted to compete in the Budokai as the great Saiyaman but protective headgear is against the rules, and I guess he just never switched back after Buu saga ended.</br>  <br>Gohan beat her. Women need to know their place.</br>  <br>He replaced it because you can't wear a helmet in the Tenkaichi. Since the Tenkaichi is probably where the most folks ever saw him, the headwrap probably became a more "iconic" symbol of the Saiyaman than the helmet ever was. Why go back to a look the public he wants to protect isn't familiar with?<br><br>It's not like he needs a helmet anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>helmets are not allowed in the tenka ichi budokai so he started wearing a bandana and sunglasses.</br>  <br> striking down an entire race that were clearly planning on killing him <br>vs<br> fucking a plant over by destorying half of it and leaving the survivors to a slow and painful death because one of the foods was too fatty <br><br>Yeah Toei, that was WAY too child friendly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That means Broly is canon too. I hope he becomes a new enemy that is stronger than them.</br>  <br><br><br>He also got rid of the cloak. What a pussy.</br></br></br>  <br>God Bulma was such a passive-aggressive bitch in this scene. I loved it.</br>  <br>That's actually Bulma's way of being sincere. When she invites the nameks and Vegeta over to live with her, she reminds them they no longer have homes. Which is in rather poor taste, considering their planets were blown the fuck up after the GENOCIDE OF THEIR RACE.</br>  <br>Why is he wearing a seatbelt?</br>  <br>the characters shown are still alive and no poison (or malicious intent) is mentioned, that's the difference. <br>Regardless of how the planet will be after, since kids don't know any better</br></br>  <br> be manlet <br> your rival is stronger and a tallfag <br> have children <br> my kid is stronger and taller <br>rekt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish this nigga had been in the Buu saga, or even the RoF move</br>  <br>Trunks is basically a male Bulma.<br>even has the same hair color as her manga version.</br></br>  <br> Goku <br> 5'6" <br> tallfag </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree; Vegeta is a shit. He gets outshined by all the other Saiyans. Even his brother gets a better waifu.</br>  <br>I wanna waifu the fuck out of Gure but I don't want to be labeled a pedophile.<br><br>Will she and Tarble ever appear again?</br></br></br>   Still no animal people <br><br>Is it because the animators cant draw them or is it because Toriyama forgot them?</br></br>  <br> toriyama <br> designing anything but some shoddy writing <br><br>ayy the lmao</br></br></br></br>  So is AnimeRG the best group for subs still, or are people sticking with them since they're the fastest?  <br>The only non manlet is piccolo and he's fucking big guy around 8 feet.</br>  <br>Geez how tall is the rest of the cast, Goku towers over them in the OP</br>  <br>DragonTeam is best</br>  <br>They've been really inconsistent with characters' heights lately. 18 has grown like a whole foot since her first appearance and Krillin has always been drawn inconsistently. The only one who always looks about the same is Ox King and maybe also Puar.</br>  <br>Kid Goku's cute</br>  <br>There's a whole planet of animal people that got blown up.<br><br>Tori clearly hates them.</br></br></br>  <br> Recently <br>Toriyama's never been consistent. Y'all need to got rewatch Frieza and Vegeta shapeshift on Namek.</br></br>  <br>He drew Jaco and there weren't any there either, so he probably still forgot them.</br>  <br> gohan <br> not spopovich. </br></br>  <br>Hell, even Ox King was originally bigger than he is now. He use to tower over literally thing. Now? He's probably Piccolo height at best.</br>  So, is the episode out yet?  <br>Vegeta genes.</br>  <br>Of course Genocide loses it's sting when all the victims of the genocide are no longer dead.</br>  <br> Goku <br> 5'6'' <br><br>He is like 5'10'' which is considered tall in Japan.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yea</br>  <br>And yet his new villain is a cat and a fat cat.<br><br>Also, I think maybe they replaced the bug aliens with the pigs because they cant draw them the bugs like Toriyama can. I think these maybe animators cant draw anything that doesnt have a humanish face. Even the snake had eyebrows thrown on.</br></br></br>  <br>No. It comes out after Haruhi becomes a God again.</br>  <br>Will the dinosaurs have feathers?</br>  <br>With his hair he is. Shave him and he's 5'6".</br>  <br>Why the fuck has FT never been introduced again?<br>You would think after spending some much time with everybody he would at least come back and say hi or something</br></br>  <br>they were all killed by Buu. when the gang wished for all humans to be revived, they weren't part of it.</br>  <br>the nameks Vegeta killed were still dead, but they still lost their planet</br>  <br>Will DBS even have any dinosaurs period?</br>  <br>Watch the last saga. The Shadow Dragon Saga was brilliant, and the last episode made you feel like they were intent on closing the book for good.<br><br>I support Super and all the new faces we'll get, but GT definitely left a place in my heart. Give it a go. Fuck the canonfags. Akira does not give a fuck. And Teen Bra is pure sex.</br></br></br>  <br>Oolong came back. <br><br>Oh, and Yamchas floating cock sock did too.</br></br></br>  <br> The Shadow Dragon Saga was brilliant <br>You're absolutely, unquestionable retarded.</br></br>  <br>That bitch somehow managed to be even more of a slut than her mother.</br>  <br> anon complements GT <br> Some other dude has to fly in and call foul <br>GT was fun</br></br></br>  <br>it wasn't a bad idea, just was executed poorly. LIke all of GT</br>  <br>Go play Xenoverse. It has him. But he's not as cool as in DBZ.</br>  <br> Anon says something stupid <br> Someone calls him stupid. <br>Yes, that's how /a/ works. Enjoy your stay.<br><br><br> it wasn't a bad idea, <br> Let's suddenly introduce a caveat to the dragonballs and fuck around with how everyone's powers work <br> not a bad idea </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GT was shit, and I say that as someone who has a lot of nostalgia for it from buying bootleg fansub VHS tapes of GT at the mall as a kid.</br>  <br>Not him, but the galaxy exploration arc was definitely the best part of the show. Shadow Dragon Saga was just more chumped Z so were S17 and Baby.</br>  <br>Everything in Dragonball is "Suddenly" introduced. And by good idea, I meant the idea of wishes having a consequence. <br><br>Unfortunately there were a lot of plot holes with that, like the dragons being stronger than king piccolo</br></br></br>  <br>Only things I don't dislike about GT:<br><br>SS4 (could do without the retarded fur and the gay mascara).<br>SS4 Gogeta (they should had made him serious like his movie version though)<br>100x Big Bang Kamehameha, it's cool to use in vidya.</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw will never suck on Trunks boy penis   <br> Everything in Dragonball is "Suddenly" introduced. <br>No it wasn't.<br><br> And by good idea, I meant the idea of wishes having a consequence.  <br> Changing the premise of a series 500+ episodes in to create some contrived drama and a boring conflict is good  <br> I don't care about the tone or direction of a series, I just like the idea that "actions have consequences" <br>No, that's fucking stupid and has no place in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice reply. If you watched it, it was a nice condensation of Dragon Ball from the beginning to end, Haze being comedic to the shift in tone starting with Natron's facade as a weakling and ending with Omega, whose design is slightly similar to Frieza's and him being the penultimate villain of that arc. But keep insulting people for actually giving it some credit rather than jump on the "NON-CANON, IT'S SHIT YOU HAVE SHIT TASTE" bandwagon.<br><br>For what it's worth, SSJ4 was better than Super Saiyan God. Leagues better.</br></br></br>  <br>According to the GT Perfect Works or whatever it was called, SS4 Goku was only as strong as Vegito, so God Goku would destroy him.</br>  <br> No it wasn't. <br><br>Name one thing that isn't so I can laugh at you.</br></br></br>  <br> The Shadow Dragon Saga was brilliant <br>That's a bit strong, but it was probably the most solid part of GT.<br><br>Si Xing Long was a bro.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've read and watched every part of the series. You're an idiot who saw "adventure through space!" and thought it somehow captured what the series was always about.<br><br><br>Goku being an alien was foreshadowed the entire time. SSJ was foreshadowed for an entire arc. Someone being a God then someone else being a higher up God has been happening since Kame. The entire Cell/Android saga was Goku fighting an old foe.<br><br>What ever came out of nowhere?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only Dragon I like, and the one that was a chick  until she turns into her real form .</br>  So, can I watch this if I haven't seen the newest movie?  <br> Actions have consequences has no place in the series <br> completely ignoring the Android arc which has Goku's actions coming back to haunt him <br> The android arc is full of contrived drama and a desolate future wasteland in a comedy series <br><br>It fits just fine. You're just booty blasted for some reason that people enjoyed an arc you didn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  RoF english subtitles here<br>http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx<br><br>Did he post any progress yet?</br></br></br>  <br> A scientist holding a grudge is the same as divine entities embodying their greed and folly coming to haunt them for a moral abuse of power <br>You're a fucking moron.</br></br>  <br>Delicious blue feet</br>  <br>Toryiama is the one planning the overall plot for the series. He isn't actually the one writing the scripts for any of the episodes though.<br><br>The Super manga is an adaptation of the anime, not the other way around.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it doesn't really matter.</br>  <br> I've read and watched every part of the series <br>I always hear this. This just gives you away so much. I only mentioned the last arc being a reason to watch GT, as it did build up Goku pressing himself to his limits to the point where he died(Shenron revived him, but only for the last attack. Note he faded away afterwards). Sit down.<br><br>And if you read the series like you said, you'd know Goku was based on the main character from Journey to the West. Him transforming under the full moon isn't alien at all. It's a common trope for those who have mammal-based appendages.<br><br>Sit the fuck down.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sweet, thanks.</br>  <br>RoF had Freeza's cut up bits squirming on the ground and Goku being pierced by a beam. When we get serious battles I don't think they'll be any softer than before.</br>  <br> Nigga, GT was one of the best-selling series in Japan back in the 90s. <br><br>Those sales are actually from the early 00s. I'd guess the higher sales happened because it's anime original so people couldn't just buy the manga.<br><br>Anyway, GT's original run on tv was a disaster (the first two episodes are on par with some of Z's lowest in ratings, and it only drops from there, never really recovering). There were also production issues, like the main writer leaving right around the beginning of the Baby arc and then another big writer leaving right after the Baby arc ended.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his just gives you away so much.  <br>Gives me away as what? Someone who doesn't type like a 12 year old from MAL like you do?<br><br> Him transforming under the full moon isn't alien at all.  <br>I never said it was, you fucking retard. <br><br> Sit the fuck down. <br>I wish GT didn't attract so much offboard faggotry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Super's first arcs are going to be extremely extended retellings of the two new movies.<br><br>Extended to such degrees they're still just setting shit up and establishing the characters' current status quo, even. Half the episode was purely about explaining why Goku is hanging out at Kaio's planet when Beerus drops by.</br></br></br>  <br> Goku being an alien was foreshadowed the entire time.  <br><br>No it fucking wasn't. People saying Goku is weird isn't foreshadowing he's an alien. he was originally based on Son Wukong is the monkey king. He's also friends with shape shifting animals and there are other monsters in the world, so you can't even say that's "him transforming into a monkey" is foreshadowing for that.<br><br>  SSJ was foreshadowed for an entire arc. <br>Saiyans and super saiyan are all dropped out at the same time when all this info about Saiyans are coming about. How are you going to complain about magic dragons, and not some monkey aliens from space that conveniently show up after piccolo is defeated? Get the fuck out of here.<br><br> The entire Cell/Android saga was Goku fighting an old foe. <br><br>Which is "Actions having consequences". Something you said doesn't fit in the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta is now taller then Bulma in the opening, everyone has magical changing heights. But Trunks was always supposed to be taller, he is a year older</br>  <br>Not to mention when Freeza was standing on the wound and just fucking goku up in general</br>  <br> People saying Goku is weird isn't foreshadowing he's an alien. <br> "Aliens always seem to have crazy hair" <br>And then we see Goku in shot with his crazy hair.<br> Goku gets scanned by RR scanner <br>And then it says he isn't human<br> "What, are you even human?" <br>And then Goku says "probably not."<br><br>You're a fucking moron. Stop posting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the movie retellings will last 3 to 4 episodes<br><br>One to introduce the threat<br>The other for them to come to earth and do their thing<br>And the last for Goku to beat them</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No it fucking wasn't. People saying Goku is weird isn't foreshadowing he's an alien. he was originally based on Son Wukong is the monkey king. He's also friends with shape shifting animals and there are other monsters in the world, so you can't even say that's "him transforming into a monkey" is foreshadowing for that. <br><br>He outright tells Piccolo Daimao that he knows he isn't a human, when Piccolo starts saying that no human could compare to him.</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bo3<wbr>7377GB5M</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Except he doesn't beat Beerus. I doubt he'll be able to beat Champa either.</br>  <br>Episode 1 is the beginning of the BoG retelling and it's going at an extremely slow pace so far. This is basically Toriyama getting as much time as he wants to tell his story instead of having to condense it into the length of a movie.</br>  <br><br> Shit father <br> bred a bunch of kids who are powerful enough on their own   Not counting Gohan <br> Gohan married Videl meaning huge compensation with money just by letting Mr. Satan pretend to win <br><br>What more do you want?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Aliens always seem to have crazy hair  <br>When does this happen?<br><br> And then it says he isn't human  <br>Yeah, at that point in the series he's a monster monkey boy<br><br> And then Goku says "probably not." <br>He knows he has a tail and no one else does, but this also the same world with emperor pilaf, Guran, Baba's monster friends and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Teen Bra <br>She's 10</br></br>  <br> When does this happen? <br>Yamcha says it.<br><br> he's a monster monkey boy <br>What the fuck does this mean?<br><br> but this also the same world with emperor pilaf, Guran, Baba's monster friends and shit. <br>What's you're fucking point? He explicitly states he knows he isn't human. You can't say him being revealed to be an alien later on is dropped out of nowhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Not human. He's a fucking monkey. The only reason you think it means alien now is because you know where the story leads. Goku fucking fought frankenstein, Yamcha fought the invisible man, Upa and Puar fought a vampire.<br><br>Garan is some monster that spits up some unbreakable saliva, and all of sudden you asssume "not human" immediately means alien?</br></br></br>  So who are the best  latino  non-speed subs?  <br>Kek, I'm 6'1". The thought of Goku barely reaching my chest makes me  hard. </br>    <br> tfw you are way taller than Goku and Vegeta <br>Being tall is suffering</br></br>  The animation seems pretty bad.  <br> English is better hands down. <br>Haha, no.</br></br>   foreshadowing  <br> people think Toriyama knew where his story was actually going <br>he made it up as he went and forgot half of it.</br></br>  <br><br><br>So, are there any doujins of Gure?</br></br></br>  <br>No it's not. Sure, we bump our heads into shit from time to time, but tall girls like tall guys. And legs for days. It helps that they are fucking rare too, more willing to take a dick in the ass.</br>  <br> Exactly Goku's height <br>I won't get called a manlet now! r-right..?</br></br>  <br>No and the only r34 is shit</br>  <br>but they poo there</br>  <br>i pray one of the alternate universes in DBS will have him</br>  <br> but I'm not a guy </br>    <br>Then congratulations, you are the 1%. Feels good mang.</br>  <br>he's not in an alternate universe. He's in an alternate timeline altogether.</br>    <br>he doesn't have to remember anymore, the autist that did AF is now Toei's Dragonball Continuity guy.</br>  <br>OH SHIT THAT'S MY FIRST GET IN THE 2 YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE. FUGGGG YESSSSS</br>  <br> he killed Roshi <br><br>That still rustles me beyond belief</br></br></br>  <br><br>As another one of these 5, I agree with this post</br></br>   used to mock people for liking female Goku's voice <br> watch BoG and then the first episode of Super <br> suddenly like female Goku <br> think the American dub sounds weird <br>Did this happen to anyone else?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigga so stronk he got his own entire two-page spread.</br></br>  <br><br>Nope. You're simply suffering from shit taste syndrome</br></br>  <br>they could easily just say its a different universe</br>  <br>no, but my view on Gohans japanese voice has changed. I hate the Kai dub of Gohan/Kid Goku. and original Z VA was meh at very best. But Japanese I really like the cute tone.</br>  <br>Please tell me Toriyama didnt really say Friezas power level is 100 quintillion.</br>  <br>never watched an entire dub ep, but adult Goku's voice is forever shit.</br>  <br>I've always liked the sub voice, it's makes Goku hilarious.</br>  <br>What a shame, if they just added 1 extra 0 he'd be at Sextillion.</br>  What the fuck, I'm just watching Yo! Son Goku now and I'm shocked that Lunch is in it. Why doesn't anyone ever mention this when talking about what happened to her?  <br>That doesnt look anything like her.</br>  <br>Tori just "explained" her absence by saying she's in and out of prison a lot. In DBO she sets the world record for most successful prison escapes</br>  <br>cause not that many people watched this garbage oav</br>   “Dragon Ball Super” is a complete continuation of the Majin Buu story arc. It’s got a bit of post-battle aftermath, continues with the “Battle of Gods” arc where the God of Destruction Beerus appears and the “Revival of ‘F'” arc where Freeza comes back to life, and then, I’ve written a strange new story where they finally depart from this universe. They’re fighting against their neighbors, Universe 6! They’ll yell at me if I give away too many spoilers, so I’ll keep the rest a secret, but they’re chasing after giant Super Dragon Balls; I think things will unfold in a bright and simple way, that will be really fun and exciting! <br><br>What kind of Waifus do you want from Universe 6 /a/?</br></br>  <br>He obviously killed himself on purpose when he teleported Cell to King Kai's planet to let Cell explode, he had time to teleport back out, instead he sat there for like 10 seconds waiting on Cell to explode.</br>  <br>but it was hilarious</br>  <br>Universe 6 already gave me my waifu.</br>  <br>Well, it's kinda a dick move to kill Kaio and then teleport yourself to safety</br>  <br>Loli fighters.</br>  <br>He couldve teleported all of them out in the time it took him to explain what was happening.</br>  <br> American <br> The ultimate enemy </br></br>  <br>In the manga he doesn't explain. He just says sorry, and it feels immediate.</br>  <br>You already got that bratty bitch Pan.</br>    <br>Care to explain that Gohan?</br>  <br>Man I miss old Toriyamas art style. That looks bad. Why cant things be like how they used to be?</br>  <br> Man I miss old Toriyamas art style.  <br> anime <br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan never would have met Videl if Chichi didn't enroll him into school. So that's more Chichi's fault than anything else.</br>  <br>Its called Sayin Dick. powerful stuff.<br> Tamed the smartest engineer in the universe <br> Tamed the strongest Human (unless you guys think Krillin&gt;Videl) <br> Tamed the bitchiest bitch, who in reality just wants a bright future for her kids <br>Don't underestimate the dick that could destroy worlds<br> The fuck's a condom? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Furrie pls</br>  <br> Broly goes SSJG <br> Just his base form with red hair <br><br>I for one, actually would like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can still by looking at his...anything else that hes still degraded.</br>  <br>Weird how they remembered every possible character for that party except Tien and Chaozu</br>  <br>Oh shut up faggot, they've been a part of the Dragonball world since the beginning.</br>  <br>I really like DB filler. I like epic fights but not every episode.</br>   Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br> Videl is about as bland female as it gets, not the strong independent woman from DBZ <br><br> Literal strongest men on earth are maximum beta in the presence of their wife <br><br>Did I miss something or am I stupid?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can some kind anon post the whole ,gif or Webm?</br>  <br>Tenshinhan probably asked "Is Vegeta coming?" and then told them to fuck off when he they told him yes.</br>  <br> Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br>He was always Goku's son. <br><br> Videl is about as bland female as it gets, not the strong independent woman from DBZ <br> strong independent woman <br>she was in high school, what the fuck?<br><br> Literal strongest men on earth are maximum beta in the presence of their wife <br>None of them are beta to their wives. Not even Krillin<br><br>So yeah, you are retarded, and know nothing of the series you're complaining about</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the best SoL anime that has been released in the last decade /a/?  <br><br>Watch it for Pan and watch the Black Star Saga<br><br>AVOID THE BABY SAGA AND SUPER 17 AT ALL COSTS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying that no one will die in DB Super? That is not going to be good. DBZ revolved around people dying, entire alien races destroyed. If they dumb this show down it will fail</br>  <br> Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br>anon, kamehamesutra isn't canon</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, especially after watching Kai's buu saga. That shit will get anyone burned out from all those fights.</br>  <br>First episode already had a victim..<br><br>My childhood memories</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Goten appears to be Goku's son, not Gohan's <br><br>Interesting. Another thing I noticed is that Gohan appears to be Goku's son, which makes him and Goten brothers.<br><br>Hm.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's impossible to dumb down dragonball</br>  Why haven't all the SJW and feminists called out DBS for its portrayal of Videl?  <br>  <br><br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she bought Gohan a book? What's so bad about that?</br>  <br>I've seen several people in these threads complain about the sexism but I think they were just baiting</br>  <br>Why would they? She's the one supporting him and putting him through school</br>  Couldn't Buu just make candy with his magic powers?  <br>he'd have to kill people for it remember.</br>  <br>No, I grew up with it, and always liked it.<br> female Goku <br>He sounds like a boy.</br></br></br>  <br>Cyborg Apocalypse. It makes anyone awesome.</br>   6 months since Buu saga <br> Puppy is full grown dog </br>   tfw watched all of DBZ when i was younger <br> wanna get back into the series and catch up with the the new movie + DBS <br> look for torrents <br> fucking nothing being seeded <br>anyone know any good actually active torrents for DBZ?</br></br></br></br>  So why is Piccolo stalking Gohan/Videl?  <br>A hulking rapist-faced beast of a man punched her womb out.<br>I think that'd take anyone out of the feisty tomboy phase.</br></br>  Wasn't Videl a tomboy? Or the manly spirit literally got beat out of her by Spopovich?  <br>Because he has lost control of his life.</br>  <br>He cucked Gohan</br>  <br>Maybe Dr. Briefs built her into like an adult body in the 5 years after that picture</br>  <br>You'd have better luck getting a Kai torrent.<br><br><br>She could still be, we've only seen her around Gohan who brings out her soft side because she loves him, and Goten/Trunks who she's being nice and motherly to since <br>-She's pregnant<br>-Goten is going to be her brother-in-law</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because his life has lost no meaning.<br>He's not strong enough to be a rival for Goku anymore.<br>Dende is the Guardian of the Earth/Dragon ball Battery so he doesn't have to.<br>The only thing he's got left to live for is Gohan. Basically living vicariously through him.<br>Gohan's basically like his soap opera now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No active torrents for the most popular animu ever made <br>You just fucking suck.</br></br>  <br>They turned him into skinny regular Trunks in Xenoverse, but whenever I say it doesn't make sense, everyone's just pointing out that Future Trunks' old design was "gay". At least stick to how your characters look, that's all I want.</br>  <br> She's pregnant <br>She's not pregnant until BoG</br></br>   ITT: Shirobako <br>I just finnished Shirobako, and it´s such a great work. I don´t have enough words to describe the magnificent development of the characters. <br>Also, Miyamori best girl</br></br>  <br><br> I don´t have enough words to describe the magnificent development of the characters.  <br><br>Just like Demo</br></br></br></br>  <br>who?</br>  <br>kek. I'm assuming OP only watched the first cour</br>  <br>No, i made that opinion because of the cry of miyamori in ep 23</br>  <br> Also, Miyamori best girl <br>You mean Ema.</br></br>  is the Cry of Miyamori the anime scene of the decade so far  <br><br>The love is dead.<br><br>Here, have best pairing</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Zuka-chan-senpai, please recommend a real dentist to Ema. She can afford it now.</br></br>  Please, Andou is best girl.  <br>I would give my right nut for them to loosely do a S2 arc on what happened in Oreimo. It would be absolutely hilarious to see production so invested in a  Kuroneko end  and watch them drown in their own tears as they animate pic related.</br>  Whenever I watch hentai now, I imagine Zuka's the one doing the voice. All of the voices. Makes watching hentai so much better in every way.  2nd OVA fucking when?  <br>Aren't they just episodes of the series they were working on?</br>  AOTY. Too bad you missed all of the dank memes.<br><br>Also, obligatory if you haven't seen it yet. No memes here, this is actually official.</br></br>  <br>Ema got a nice raise at the end though. Same for Miyamori.</br>  <br>I wonder what they'd lose just lowering the VA paychecks. There's certainly no shortage of voice actors.</br>  <br>They'd lose the VA to another project. Don't underestimate the power of a famous VA in selling an anime.</br>  <br>I wish I could be a goth loli.</br>  Team subtlety right here.  <br>how does a college student make more than an animator?</br>  The smuggest  Ai is love.

The threads were pretty fun too, but shame you missed that. There were so many threads when episode 16 aired.<br>Also, every girl is best.</br>  Diesel=Aoi&gt;Ema&gt;Zuka&gt;shit&gt;tires  <br>I can get behind this</br>  S2 when?  <br>What a waste of cream.</br>  <br><br>All 4 main girls are best girls</br></br>  Someone post the Jojo ending  <br>I see what you did there.</br>  <br> no mention of the copypastas <br>Half the reason I lurked these threads every week was to see how you sick fucks would bully the bakos next.</br></br>  <br><br>Did somebody say bullying?

It is the culmination of the effort of Aoi to go one step further to her dream, but also, it has a mix of emotions. There´s joy and a little sadness for herself, but on that last thing, i can´t figure out why</br>  3D-chan a cute.  Remember, you are here forever.  <br>*It's a solid 7/10, maybe 8/10, depending on how you look at it</br>  When ARE they coming?  <br>Who cares about side characters?</br>  <br> you will never be forced to work OT by Erica </br>  <br>I need more perfection.

My only gripe was Ai. They should have toned down her shyness. All girls were great though.    You guys only talk about girls, girls, and girls. How the fuck BASED Kantoku not even mentioned yet?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nCG<wbr>QVe627As</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> working in korea <br>I seriously hope you're not white, brown, black, hispanic or any form of asian that isn't korean.</br></br>  <br>Anime needs more fat guys.</br>  <br>Kantoku for Street Fighter V</br>  <br>That was a great scene. I'm quite surprised the part where he tips his hat isn't thrown around much on this board.</br>  <br> magnificent development of the characters <br>You mean the waste of time with a main character who was perfectly developed from the get go but whined about nothing for the entire show.<br>The other character who simply lucked into her job.<br>Or the two underdeveloped ones that barely had any screen time or lines.<br>Artist girl was fine, but nothing amazing.<br><br>The other characters weren't fully developed with proper arcs but they were still worlds more interesting than the five otaku bait girls.<br><br>Other than those characters it's a great show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  2nd OVA when?   Aaaandes Chuckyyy   Are braids and glasses the ultimate disguise in nippon / 2D?  Everyone knows who Homura is regardless of the glasses and hair.  <br> Are braids and glasses the ultimate disguise in nippon / 2D? <br>Good thing they developed hyper-accurate PM's (Hand movement and sound recognition, possibly even photographing) without developing any kind of Biometric recognition.</br></br>  Translation of prologue soon  entei08<br> Prologue is a philosophical-ish analysis of the world ending. <br><br> Chapter 1 part 1, Touma being chased on the bike by the darkness thing in the blurb, he manages to slide under a train thanks to its high specs to in order to escape.  <br> The bike can go up to 50kph, lean 70 degrees without falling over, auto stance recover, electronic controlled shock absorbers, can jump to a height of 20 metres. <br><br> part 2 onward., Komoe cries that Touma is in danger of repeating a year.  <br> Therefore he must undertake this criminal awareness event right now, on top of extra classes in the winter break to even have a chance of not staying back a year. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The event is basically having students play the role of criminals, police and hostages.  <br> The three idiots play as criminals, wearing a skin-colored tightsuit and white trunks.  <br> Aogami manages to incur the rage of Fukiyose somehow and bought collateral damage to his two friends.  <br> In order to escape, Touma literally ran up the school building wall from the third floor and succeeded.  <br> Just when he is about to run up to the fourth floor (still on the wall btw), Misaka playing as the police walks past the school and spots him in his hilariously embarrassing outfit, like a pervert looking into a building. <br> Just before the encounter Misaka was actually mulling over the events of NT 10, conflicted but determined to talk to Touma about it in a way that wouldn't hurt the boy.  <br> The sight of his pathetic self enraged/embarrased her so much, Touma almost got a railgun up his ass.  <br> Just before this can happen, Seria opens a window and lets Touma inside the building, specifically, her secret base.  <br> Seria plays a hostage but couldn't be bothered about this whole event.  <br> She generously offers to share her snacks and flirts with Touma a bit, randomly throwing out a comment about how Touma's screams of horror when she opened the window reminds her of a monster being treated like a human after stones were thrown at him.  <br> It could be alluding to Touma's childhood horrors when people treated him like a plague, so maybe Seria knows about his past.  <br> Preview ends here. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The sight of his pathetic self enraged/embarrased her so much, Touma almost got a railgun up his ass.  <br><br>What a fucking bitch.</br></br></br>  <br> Wall running Touma <br>Ordinary High School Student passing through.</br></br>  <br>In other words, translation for best girl's volume is soon.</br>  <br> best girl </br>  <br>Deal with it.</br>  <br><br>Misaka is the qtest.</br></br>  <br> bitch <br> cute <br>Nope.</br></br></br>  <br> Cover is Misaka <br> Actually a Seira volume <br>Let it happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, THK. I'm tired of your shit.</br>  <br>I don't care.</br>    <br> Just before the encounter Misaka was actually mulling over the events of NT 10, conflicted but determined to talk to Touma about it in a way that wouldn't hurt the boy.  <br>Biri trying her best to deal with her tsun side.</br></br>  <br>Too bad she's shit at it.</br>  How many people saying "what a bitch" about Mikoto's comedy scene that doesn't make a damn bit of difference beyond being unfunny and old praise Othinus? Im guessing a lot.  <br>Resolution to end it all soon. I'm routing for BRO end.</br>  <br>Same</br>  <br>Zero. Only THK goes retard and nitpicks Mikoto because she's popular.</br>  So how many of you picked up this series for best boy?  <br> Only THK hates Mikoto <br><br>Can you please stop this stupidity?</br></br></br>  <br>Me! I went into this series a long time ago for no one but Accelerator. Still here for Accelerator, and Misaka genepool</br>  <br>Is she ok?<br>Her hair are going through her eyelashes.</br></br>  I want to spend eternity with Mikoto.<br><br><br>I wish I could live happily in AC with her.</br></br></br>  <br> live happily <br> In Academy City <br><br>lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is why Itsuwa is the best girl. She is a nice and mature girl that doesn't hurt or abuse Touma and is the most ideal and useful partner for him.</br>  <br>He wants your attention just ignore him.</br>  <br> Implying I said that <br>THK pls.</br></br>  <br> Zero. Only THK goes retard and nitpicks Mikoto because she's popular. <br> ONLY <br>That is exactly what you said. Its time to accept that the world doesn't revolve around you</br></br></br>  <br> What is context to 's post <br>Stop trying so hard, THK. It makes you obvious. You can't even prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>You can always shit yourself and spend your time with the turd. Same thing.</br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br>"THK" also hates Index.</br>  <br>Orsola is the only one he's walked in on who hasn't beat the shit out of him.</br>  <br>Too bad nuns can't marry.</br>  <br>No obvious signs of his distinctive autism has been directed at Index in the past, so nope.</br>  <br>So your logic is shit. People love to rip Index apart when she gets comedy scenes with Touma.</br>  What is it with /a/ and their boogeyman mentality. It's not like there's only one Mikoto hater. Not everyone thinks the same and /a/ isn't really a hive mind either.<br><br>Though it's funny: you all look like idiots. Please continue.<br><br><br>Time for best girl? Time for best girl!<br><br> The sight of his pathetic self enraged/embarrased her so much, Touma almost got a railgun up his ass.  <br><br>Classic Mikoto.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Waiting for Othinus to steal the spotlight from Misaka.  <br>I fear for the backlash if that happens. There is literally nothing Mikoto has or can do against the Nordic goddess in terms of power, importance and relevance for Touma and the plot.</br>  <br> all those horrible jpg artifacts <br> image.jpg <br>Jesus Christ how horrifying, how do you fuck up this badly? Do you not know how to save images even on a phone?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not /a/. It's just a couple of faggots that are forcing this THK shit in almost every series they can.<br><br>Though it's funny, you see people hating tsunderes in Oreimo and Infinite Stratos threads all the time, yet the THK boogeyman is forced by no one. This leads me to suspect it's just the work of a delusional samefag who wants to force his spacegoat and his lack of presence and activity can be noted in threads for the two aforementioned series.</br></br></br>  <br>finally a man of taste to save us all</br>  <br>Impossible. She's now a exposition side character, which is Index's original role. They both share the role of Touma's encyclopedia against magic stuff(in short, as side-kicks) and I assume they won't have as much appearance time as Mikoto in this volume.</br>  <br>There is going to be a shitposting like no fucking tomorrow if the pattern continues with touma and girl on cover and girl has some kind of setback.<br><br> NT10 Othinus turned 15cm <br> NT11 Touma cant remember anything about Misaki <br> NT12 Index role is that of a support character <br> NT13 Misaka's turn <br> <br>I still wonder if the 15cm Othinus really is a setback, she still going strong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>has toma ever walked in on itsuwa? until he does we won't know</br>   Mikoto hyped up again <br> Plot derails to Seria <br> Touma has to save the world again and repeats the year <br> Volume ends with Mikoto having done nothing but assault Touma again. <br><br>Cool</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Othinus is the current main heroine. Misaka is a secondary heroine. Othinus has a shit ton of more impact on Touma than Misaka ever could have.</br>  <br> spacegoat </br>  <br>Othinus' role is still an enigma. No one is sure if her current miniature status is permanent or if she can go back to her normal Magic God form at will or triggered by something else. <br><br>She's at least one of the few logical characters that could actually help against another magic god.</br></br></br>  <br>Oddly enough the "poster" he is rabidly chasing is also absent. Kind of strange that those "two" always appear together and never separately.</br>  <br> Othinus is the current main heroine. <br>Delusions much? She's just "another girl Touma rescued".<br><br><br>With her knowledge, yes. But as of now that's all she can do.</br></br></br></br></br>   Now, on the other hand, there is an entirely different type of angel; and here we must be especially careful to remember that we include gods and devils, for there are such beings who are not by any means dependent on one particular element for their existence. They are microcosms in exactly the same sense as men and women are. They are individuals who have picked up the elements of their composition as possibility and convenience dictates, exactly as we do ourselves... I believe that the Holy Guardian Angel is a Being of this order. He is something more than a man, possibly a being who has already passed through the stage of humanity, and his peculiarly intimate relationship with his client is that of friendship, of community, of brotherhood, or Fatherhood. <br><br>Othinus best girl.</br></br>  <br>Nah man. Othinus isn't even in the same category as the other girls. She's by far the most important girl for Touma's character.</br>  <br> She's by far the most important girl for Touma's character. <br>You mean another mouth for Touma to feed. Like I said: she's sidekick-zoned like Index.</br></br>  <br>Fukiyose book when?</br>  <br>You're fucking delusional. THK is real, and here's the biggest example of his existence.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/118694<wbr>586/<br>Look through the ghost. There was around 300 posts made by him.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>You dragged me here.</br>  <br>So THK is a bot? You do realize that you don't need to be human to spam in the archive, right?</br>  <br>And I assume you have proof that THK is posting here? That he really is this THK character and not another anon with the same style or opinion?</br>  <br>We finally getting Seria volume?</br>  <br> Most imporant characters to Touma <br> Index <br> Othinus <br><br>NT9 and NT10 showed us just how far Touma would go for index and an unbreakable bond was created in NT10 with Touma and Othinus.<br><br>Misakafags just dont want to accept that Touma sees Misaka as nothing more than a friend. <br><br>COMPARE WHEN MISAKA SAVES TOUMA AND OTHINUS SAVES HIM.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sssh. Don't argue with Othinusfags. I look forward to them shitting themselves when they get BTFO just like all the other girls.  <br>There's captcha on the archives.</br>  <br>Being relegated to sidekick zone doesn't invalidate what I said about her, and doesn't mean she can't be relevant again. She can perfectly steal the spotlight in this volume and it would be fitting for her character and role in the story.</br>  <br>How long until Touma cuts bullets out of the air with his bare hands, like any normal high school student?</br>  <br>I hope she gets her own novel like Misaki did</br>  <br> COMPARE WHEN MISAKA SAVES TOUMA AND OTHINUS SAVES HIM <br><br> COMPARE ORANGES AND MELONS! <br><br>No. Try comparing how Touma saved the two from death first. Touma showed equal determination for both, battling beings more powerful than him.<br><br>And while Orthinus is an encyclopedia now, Mikoto can fully support Touma as an L5 electromaster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> captcha <br><br>Kek. Even the captcha in 4chan can be bypassed.</br></br></br>  <br>The only Level 5 that can help Touma against the magic side is Accel.</br>  <br>Is that Yukari form Persona 3?</br>  <br> you see people hating tsunderes in Oreimo and Infinite Stratos threads all the time, yet the THK boogeyman is forced by no one <br>Maybe that's cause a lot more people hate/used to hate Kirino and Houki whereas Mikoto is more or less popular<br>At least she used to be, maybe not anymore</br></br></br>  <br> implying captcha bypass on 4chan <br>If it was bypassed that easily, people would sell the advertising method to the people who run spam bots for money, rather than use it to spam animu opinions. <br><br>With passes they'd be quickly revoked if they contained advertising content.</br></br></br></br>  <br> fighting accel =/= fighting the world <br>ok<br>  Mikoto can fully support Touma as an L5 electromaster <br><br>ahhahahahahahahah, oh god you can't be serious. Mikoto is helpless against the magic side. I'd take my chances with the mini god.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She lost to YukinoSHITa Yukino in the last yearly LN poll.</br>  JS06<br>FINISH HEAVY OBJECT<br>FUCKING<br>HELL</br></br></br>  <br> tfw i only read the LN because some anon said he fights some broken guy called fiamma with his new wings <br> tfw it was all a lie </br></br>  <br>Mikoto, Mugino and Kakine can hold their own against any magician.<br><br>Though Accel might be the only guy who can 1v1 against a Magic god. Not even Touma can win in an outright fight with one. He won against Orthinus because he got to her feels.</br></br></br>  <br>Touma showed personal and emotional attachment for Othinus though. And there are all those scenes where they flirt and bond with each other. Where they clearly enjoy being with each other. Mikoto never got anything of that level, and she is one of the least useful characters for Touma against the current threats.</br>  <br> Can hold their own against any Magician <br> Accel 1v1 against a Magic God <br><br>Anon, what are you doing?</br></br></br></br>  <br> No. Try comparing how Touma saved the two from death first. Touma showed equal determination for both, battling beings more powerful than him. <br><br>Accel never had shit on Touma while Touma fought the world for Othinus<br><br> And while Orthinus is an encyclopedia now, Mikoto can fully support Touma as an L5 electromaster. <br><br> implying Misaka can actually give support vs a magic god <br><br>I cant wait to see how much bs this volume is going to be. <br><br>I bet this person who comes to help is going to do all the fighting against the magic god.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto, Mugino and Kakine can hold their own against any magician. <br>Not against saints, only Kakine would be able to hold his own.<br><br> Though Accel might be the only guy who can 1v1 against a Magic god.  <br>You're not serious right? I don't think you understand just how out there magic gods are.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mikoto confirmed Saint tier, of course she can.</br>  <br>No need to lie anon, magic side niggas are weak as fuck besides the saints.</br>  <br> Mikoto never got anything of that level <br>Touma entertains Mikoto's chases and even chats with her. Remember Daihaisei?</br></br>  <br>It's not easy, but it can be done. Accel spammer even returned some months ago to spam some threads. I imagine the captcha of the archive is much easier to bypass.</br>  <br>To be fair, Crowley BTFO the Magic Gods in the last volume, so Kamachi can do whatever he wants at this point and just point to them being weakened by that.</br>  <br>Shit yeah, but last year was the year of Yahari. Watari's LN sweeped virtually every category (best artist, best boy, etc) if I remember right. <br><br>And it's not like teh Biri slid out of rankings, she still took 2. Compare to Kuroneko and Sena who literally disappeared when they used to be in the top 10 all the time. Though I suppose their respective series ending may have had something to do with it</br></br></br>  <br> Mikoto, Mugino and Kakine can hold their own against any magician. <br>only kakine and that is under the impression magicians can't make a way to fuck him up.<br><br> Though Accel might be the only guy who can 1v1 against a Magic god <br><br> 1v1 against a Magic god <br><br>WHAT</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel never had shit on Touma while Touma fought the world for Othinus <br><br>That's rich. Accel beat Touma to death. Touma won on purely plot armour.</br></br></br>  <br>What surprised me the most about it wasn't so much how much Yahari was on there but rather the fact that Othinus somehow made it into the top 10.</br>  <br> You're not serious right? I don't think you understand just how out there magic gods are. <br>Crowley powered them down remember?<br><br>Also they did mention Magic Gods have to power down when entering reality.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> THK apologists to a serious autist spams and recognizable hate posts, to the point of using the same old arguments every single time <br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br> all the non saint gods right seat <br> vasila <br> knight leader <br> the queen <br> carissa <br> thor <br> marian <br> any of gremlin <br> birdway <br> crowley himself <br> weak <br>ok</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's really nothing special. He does the same with his other friends. It would be completely different if there was and actual flirtatious intent, emotion involved from his part and most importantly, mutual development.</br>  <br> Crowley powered them down remember? <br>No, he just made it possible to kill them, they're still at the very top of the magic side.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Shut up please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And you think that means Accel can beat one? Anon 50/50 othinus would have fucking killed Accel.</br>  <br>Welcome to R/a/ildex threads, where autism reigns supreme. Wait till people tell you it used to be SO much worse back when NT3 came out.</br>  <br>If the magic gods were now so weak that even Accel could fucking beat one there wouldn't be any point to hype the volume as much as they've been doing.</br>  <br> That's really nothing special. He does the same with his other friends. <br>And also with Orthinus and with Misaki way back, according to flashback. Try wearing that shipping goggles less tight next time.</br></br>  <br>Technically only 50/50 chance, like everyone else (though I guess if you interpret NT 8 to mean Othinus was fated to win the whole time it doesn't matter).<br><br>But yeah, it's completely asinine to try and put Accel on the level of Magic Gods, it took his white wings for him to barely survive the equivalent of Fiamma throwing a hissy fit.</br></br></br>  So like the usual Index spoiler threads, the posts at the top are the only info and the rest of the thread is pointless waifushit, right?  <br>Correct.</br>  <br>The Magic Gods could only be killed by time travel or something like that preventing them from even becoming a Magic God in the first place. To kill any of them, Accel'd have to wisen up and not go vector/deflection/wings spam on them.</br>  <br> Anon 50/50 othinus would have fucking killed Accel. <br><br>That's because she has the ability to win 100% at 50% of the time. That ability is OP but it also means that she can get rekt at 50%.<br><br><br> there wouldn't be any point to hype the volume as much as they've been doing <br><br>No, the point of the hype is on the cover.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So the Mikoto shit posting begins. How can one cute girl cause so much butthurt?  <br>Yes. In fact I was just about to tell you thARRRGGGHHH KANZAKI HELP ME, IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN</br>  <br> Misaki <br>Pre-memory loss Touma doesn't count.<br><br> Othinus <br>Is the one I'm talking about. Don't just ignore all their scenes in NT10, their history in NT9 and the context. Not to mention that being in a desperate adventure together helps being way more intimate than just casual meetings. You have to be really delusional to think the level of closeness and development of Mikoto with Touma is nowhere near Othinus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so have those 2 fucked yet or at least confessed.....</br>  <br>Magic gods can time travel anon</br>  <br>Literally the only difference between Othinus and a true Magic God is that their chance of victory is at 100% instead of 50%. They both have infinite power.<br><br>Also it turned out no, she couldn't get wrecked. Remember NT 8? The whole arc was one big flip of the coin and it came up heads, she was always going to win.</br></br></br>  <br> she can get rekt at 50% <br>Doesn't matter. She won't die and will just try again.</br></br>  <br> Wait till people tell you it used to be SO much worse back when NT3 came out. <br><br>But it was. People even spammed guro images and bestiality doujins back then.</br></br></br>   Don't just ignore all their scenes in NT10, their history in NT9 and the context. <br><br>If you say that then don't go ignoring all the other girls Touma has history with.<br><br> Pre-memory loss Touma doesn't count. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If she only wins 50% of the time, statistically speaking it's better to get a semi powerful ability which could troll about 90% of weak opponents 100% of the time than a 50%/50% chance you'd be defeated by a blade of grass.<br><br><br>If you kill them or their ancestors before they become a magical god they'd never have been able to time travel in the first place, rendering the magic god timeline defunct.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Accelerator will be the strongest character by the end of the series.  <br>When she loses she doesn't auto lose, see when she cut of ollerus/thor's arm she didn't know it was olly and both of their arms fell off, at worse she would kill herself with accel at best she would kill him then heal afterwards.</br>  <br>I'm not ignoring that though. When I say "things of that level", it means that you simply can't compare her to the other girls Touma has NORMAL relationships with. <br><br>And no, pre-memory loss Touma doesn't count. He's dead.</br></br></br>  AGAIN HAPPENING IT'S ME HELP KANZAKI ARRRGGGHHH  <br>He will be the weakest one after all the Esper powers get removed from the earth.</br>  <br>The strongest before he kicks the bucket saving Touma, most likely.</br>  <br>I think he will definitely do something massively important. And I don't think Touma's gonna beat the big boss without his help.</br>  <br>They are not bound by time or fate anon<br><br>Magic God Othinus could control everything. Without exaggeration, she controlled the world itself. If she wanted to, she could have galaxies collide to kill Kamijou Touma. Or she could break the bonds between the particles making up his body and cause his very existence to disperse. If she was the slightest bit dissatisfied with something, she could turn back time, re-lay the rails of fate that led to the future, and create the exact result she wanted.</br></br></br>  <br> other girls Touma has NORMAL relationships with. <br> NORMAL <br><br>Sure. Did Touma had a date and a romantic dinner with Orthinus? Comeback when they did.</br></br></br></br>  If I take off Othinus' hat, will she die?  <br><br>When she does a Phoebe Kates/Fast Times At A Certain Highschool pool scene moment with Touma.</br></br>  <br>Also time didn't exist in the void the Magic Gods were hanging out in, i'm pretty sure they're acasual.<br><br>Besides that, they have infinite power and their existence itself is infinite and stretches forever. Plus according to Ollerus a Magic God knows what they need to know. Even if you tried to change their past I doubt that would work out for you. They'd probably show up in front of you and laugh in your face.</br></br></br>  <br>I can see this happening. I can also see him being saved at the very last moment by   the mercy of Will/Last Order </br>  <br>Did any other girl spend millions of years dealing with Touma alone which created a deep understanding and formed an unbreakable bond between the two? They're beyond romantic shit at this point.</br>  <br>Not if this nigga still rolling with a gun after.</br>  <br> Magic God Othinus could control everything <br>Not the 50/50 version. Nope.<br>If she flipped a coin and tails comes up she lose.<br><br> When she loses she doesn't auto lose <br>She failed to kill Olly. That's the 50/50 she lost.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How was vol. 12? <br>I stopped halfway because I was waiting for the translations and then for some reason I never read it again.</br>  <br>no Touma went on a honeymoon with Othinus</br>  <br>Touma was trying to punch her for millions of years. That's so romantic.<br><br>Kek.</br></br></br>  <br> implying Touma doesn't deserve most of what happens to him </br>  <br> implying she wouldn't hold him down and demand that he take responsibility if he's going to see her like that </br>  <br>she tied with ollerus, the only difference lose = normal attack like all the fights with olly, win = auto win like how she beat kakine with a fucking choke. with 50 lose she would have to try to beat accel.</br>  <br>That was part of the enemies stage. They did indeed have the most romantic moments in the series anyway. The car scene, pic related, the last battle, etc.</br>  Reminder that Worst and LO's feelings for Accel are fake.  <br><br>Mostly this is because she can't die.<br><br>Even if she loses, it won't kill her, so she can just try again until she wins. She's an infinite existence.</br></br></br></br>  Why is NT so shit?  <br>Reminder that NT10 proved that this shitpost is, in fact, full of shit</br>  <br>Again, your goggle's too tight.<br><br>None of those bear any romantic connotations and even the part where Touma chats up with the nun or the part Mikoto hugs him and shows her support is more romantic.</br></br></br>  <br>They are going to die soon so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Don't be like that Accelfag. Will-tan can still separate LO from Accel if she wants.</br>  <br>When did I say she couldn't? But NT10 proved that she won't. Because she literally said she wouldn't.</br>  Is this THK crap the person I kept on getting people claiming I was simply because i didn't like Mitoko like a bunch of retards? I mean really just because i didn't change the filename from the booru once doesn't mean that filename is a connection to some weirdo conspiracy to hate on Mikoto.  It was extra silly because that was the first time I came into a railgun thread in months as i was behind in the LNs and yet I got hounded about how clearly their expert analysis of my writing style meanns i must be some other poster that's been around for months.  <br><br><br>Accel can't even 1v1 vs a magical mook with minimal preptime.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If a being is omnipotent/has infinite power then they should be able to create a task which they cannot perform. On the other hand, if the being can create a task that they are unable to perform, there is something they cannot do. (Even in the 100% phase. Counting the 50%/50% and fairy phase Othinus' power was not infinite as it had a beginning and an end. Furthermore, the very fact that she couldn't remember how to reconstruct the world as it was strongly suggests that Othinus didn't know what she needed to know. )<br><br>Furthermore, if the magic gods were acausal/the flow of time didn't exist the pre-magic god phase and the 15cm existence would not have existed in the first place. <br><br>If once upon a time a presumably unimportant driver appeared and without their appearance the to-be magic god would have never even found Gremlin or discovered how to unlock their powers in the first place, they never would have reached the state of knowing what they need to know or indeed doing what they could have done.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And he can kill all the clones so she ceases to exist.</br>  <br>Dude, you don't even need googles to see it. And please, Mikoto's scene wasn't even good. It was a poor attempt to make her do something similar to Will-tan. The impact of her scene pales in comparison to her own clone in NT9 or the big Touma and Othinus scenes in NT10.</br>  <br>I don't believe you. Unless THK was trolling you or you are pretending to be someone else, it takes a special kind of autistic hate to be called out as THK. Merely saying you simply dislike is nothing like what THK would say.</br>  <br>Will-tan is just a plot device.<br>Reminder that the strongest character in Raildex is Kamachi and that every other answer is non-canon. <br><br><br>He's not going to be doing any of that because LO could shut off his connection to the rest of the network.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not happening, either. I'm assuming he will die and Will make a place for him with her or she will mercifully do something to prevent him from dying</br>  <br>They're not omnipotent, but they do have infinite power and existence. The difference being that they don't have an infinite number of applications for their power.<br><br>Hell, we know it's infinite because the entire reason the 50/50 dilemma occurred in the first place is because she had infinite power, it's like half of the plot being New Testament.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah i know he wouldn't do that just saying he could and also pretty sure he don't even need the network with his white wings now.</br>  <br>He doesn't but he does need a Drama Preserving Handicap to at least pretend that the Power Creep hasn't hit critical levels.</br>  <br>The first few villains were Izzard, Accelerator, and fucking Gabriel, Kamachi never gave a shit.</br>  <br>Just ignore him. He is a legitimate stalker psycho, he even keeps post numbers for months so that he can spam them in every thread, archives his own collection of quotes as "proof," and keeps creepy pastas to feed his obsession.</br>  What's the chances of the next antagonist being shit again?  <br>He is literally already doing it for this thread in the archives right now</br>  <br>Not him, but I've seen random people get called out as THK by people who are almost certainly just trying to derail threads. For a recent example, https://archive.moe/a/thread/127482<wbr>625/#q127504214</wbr></br>  <br>I want this so bad.<br><br>I also want this to happen<br>  Misaka confesses <br> Touma rejects her due to PTSD <br> later says that he isn't ready to go out with anyone as his life is COMPLETE and UTTER shit that could turn worse at a moment's notice but s willing to be friends with her and will always come to her if she is in need <br> Misaka recalls it being the same thing he promised he'd do for Etzali back in August <br> Mikoto sees Touma reuniting with Index and Othinus <br> she sees Touma be really really happy and realizes where there is no place in his heart for her <br> says goodbye to Touma <br> she ACTUALLY SAYS HIS NAME AFTER HER REJECTION <br> she breaks down in tears but smiles that she finally set her feelings free </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma rejecting her on the grounds that his life sucks would just end with her deciding to make his life better so they can date.</br>  Waiting for my boy to get his revenge on that witch.  <br>I know this is a meme/copypasta and you're doing this as a Othinusfag/Misakahater, but this wouldn't be all that bad minus the tears</br>  <br>Don't worry about it, he has even called me THK a few times and I love Misaka.</br>  <br>Wrong link? THK was in that thread and he was shitposting. He called called out, then typically went on the counter by playing up the boogeyman defensive.</br>  <br>Where you perhaps saying negative things about another tsundere from another series? <br><br>That is what triggers the THK autists.</br></br></br>  <br>I linked to a random post by accident, but it was the right thread. https://archive.moe/a/thread/127482<wbr>625/#q127497264 is the first THK mention there. There were tsundere posted in a worst girl thread, and of course that means THK must be behind it all and needs to be stopped. It's either intentional shitposting or outright delusion.</wbr></br>  <br>Wait for him to justify and rationalize his theories about THK being the only person in the whole board that hates tsundere.</br>  <br>Context. Pretty sure that poster meant it as a meme cause most of those girls are frequently hated by THK. Anyways, THK did revealed himself a few hours later down the thread.</br>  <br>Dont forget if you tell him to go away or shut up you automatically become THK yourself. In fact I expect him to pop up soon and accuse all of us of samefagging.</br>  THK is cancer. I wish Accelspammer came back so he can deal with THK.  <br>Accelspammer is the hero we need, THK Is the one we deserve.</br>  <br> 7 <br><br> 7 <br><br> 7 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss him ;_;</br>  <br>There was also a THK argument in that thread in which the THK believers got BTFO.</br>  <br>I suppose so if he wants to lay in a puddle of his own vomit for the rest of his now short life he can try.<br><br>Uh good for you I guess? <br><br><br>Refresh my memory please? How did it do so because i have absolutely no memory of what you recall?<br><br><br>Sure NP. I tend to stay away from raildex threads when it's not around an update day anyway and i've generally learned better than to point out flaws in a plan with the brick wall that is shippers. <br><br>I was starting to wonder if he had ripped off old posts of mine specifically related to Misaka for copypasta or something.<br>While I'm perfectly willing to point out exactly why i dislike Misaka and whatnot I'm willing to point out flaws in any character i perceive whether i like them or not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares if some people use it intentionally? Facts remains THK is a serious problem and he is literally behind majority of the reckless hate that goes beyond overzealous and dedicated shitposting. Certain girls gets it the worst of his sperging, so it ain't difficult to observe the quality and lack of reasoning of the hate to determine if it is him.</br>  <br>I don't hate Misaka though. I only wish she could get some development already.</br>  <br> BTFO <br>Never happened, troll. Questioning whether THK is real or not seriously makes you new as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't the scene in pic related essentially count as the same as being walked in on? I mean Touma told her about it and she just got embarrassed and ran off to change.</br>  <br>Hey I have no problem calling out the shit writing or poor characterization or stupid crap she does. But god forbid we should do but adore the tusn goddess.<br><br> Misaka is best Raildex regardless. </br></br></br>  <br> Facts remains THK <br>Who is he among us? Just go out saying "any guy who hates tsunderes" already, you autistic nutjob.</br></br>  All the THK and LRD bullshit is what's going to make Js06 abandon us  <br>She has gotten development, but its always forgotten next volume.</br>  <br>Proof that you didn't read the thread. The argument wasn't about a shitposter's existence, it was about people being retarded enough to call anyone who hates what they like THK.</br>  <br>Lurk moar.</br>  <br> Lurk moar. <br>Nice meme.</br></br>  <br>If I were js06 I would have abandoned you guys already. Or at least stay away from interacting with the community and buying my own book for raws to translate.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> Doesn't know how to spot THK <br><br> LRDTHK namefag is an apologist <br>Heh.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It has already ruined raildex threads. The constant autistic bitching over it is a bigger problem than the actual "THK."</br>  <br> apologist <br><br> point <br> ______ <br> Your head </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What newfags say to save face despite being fucking new.</br>  <br>I got the point. Thanks.</br>  <br> What newfags say to save face despite being fucking new. <br> Can't admit the fact that THK is now a meme used against people who don't like what they like to win internets <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also said this some days back in the archive. Even though I'm a Mikotofag, I'm not blind to her flaws and even criticize her for them. Yet rabid faggots will jump on your throat calling you a faggot tsundere hater. It's fucking stupid how that also means you're THK.</br>  <br> This is what I want people to believe <br>Your tactic won't work.</br></br>  <br>The worst thing is that this autistic shit isn't limited to Raildex threads only. It has ruined plenty of threads for other series as well.</br>  <br> It's fucking stupid how that also means you're THK. <br>IKR.<br><br>I suppose I should call the Orthinusfag I was arguing with earlier THK to make the autists accept me.<br><br><br> Your tactic won't work. <br> Implying it didn't </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Missed a spot.<br><br> How about doing some push-ups to help (me) hold up my weapon...? </br></br></br>  But Ushio kai ni was like months ago!

Yadokari and Bob (see: Nachi K2) can be equally guilty of this.</br></br>  <br>But Nachi was meant to be drawn like that, I dont believe anyone exists that looks at Ashigara's face only and say they cant identify its gender, or are you saying shibafuships are boys with tits and its fine?</br>  <br>Nachi is handsome.</br>    <br>Cute</br>  <br>He looks like the dude from Jormungand, obviously not the MC, the other one.</br>  <br> I dont believe anyone exists that looks at Ashigara's face only and say they cant identify its gender <br>You were talking about the faces, not the bodies. Put Ashigara's head on a male body/head and it'd just look like any other androgynous anime boy.<br> or are you saying shibafuships are boys with tits and its fine? <br>I'm saying you're imposing a strange double standard, since as far as anime goes any face (no matter how feminine) can just be conceived as male.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I was talking about the faces only, not sure what are you trying to quote there, but I could agree that with a male body they could look right, but you have to admit that, of all the kancolle artist's faces, shibafu ones are the most "genderless" ones.<br>And I dont feel that I have double standards, I just dont like shibafu and I was explaining some valid points of mine, thats all.</br></br>  <br>your reply</br>  I don't like Shibafu's art but I love Kaga, what's wrong with me guys?  <br> but you have to admit that, of all the kancolle artist's faces, shibafu ones are the most "genderless" ones. <br>I don't. Most of the kancolle artists don't draw masculine males much. Judging their ability to draw male faces by their female faces is a silly argument to make. If anything, Yadokari is the most "genderless."</br></br>  <br>your reply</br>    <br><br>Samefag</br></br>  we never got scans of them  <br>That Kaga is beautiful, thanks a lot Shibafu</br>    <br>I somehow prefer other artists' Kaga to the original's. Her sidetail looks weird when drawn by Shibafu.</br>  <br>your reply</br>  <br><br><br>why so mad shibafu</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about, her sidetail looks fine to me</br>  I hope they will release more character songs.  <br>storytime</br>  When did the fanon shift Zuikaku to be a harem lead? I thought she was for bullying?  <br>Zuizui dance has a charming effect on other shipgirls.</br>  <br>Zui-turkey is still the best fanon</br>  <br>When she became a senpai.
