[ TPP, destroying what we love.<br>http://mainichi.jp/select/news/2015<wbr>0728k0000m020060000c.html<br><br>The doujin market can and probably will be threatened by this.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>The problem is not only the doujin market. It may as well come to affect aggregate sites like sadpanda and batoto.</br>  <br>Wouldn't even shit like deviantart or the boorus be under attack too? Same with wikis and what not. Nothing is safe.</br>  <br><br>Just relocate them to countries that aren't in this deal yet.</br></br>  How much time until we're no longer able to imagine copyrighted material?  <br>Yep. If someone/anyone reports it, they're fucked.</br>  <br><br>Once they have a something that puts ads in our dreams.</br></br>  As per usual, Japan only cares after shit its the fan, instead of before it<br><br>Thanks Abe.</br></br>  It's time to stop TPP, TiSA and TTIP, anons.<br><br>WRITE YOUR REPRESENTATIVES<br>EMAIL YOUR REPRESENTATIVES<br><br>If you are in the US, you have two senators and one congressmember. Write your opposition to the TPP.<br><br>If you are from some parliamentary country, send the letters to your backbencher MPs.<br><br>If you're from the EU, send the fucking emails/letters to your MEPs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Meh I was tired of /a/ anyway.  <br><br>And the anime itself</br></br>  http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/27-1/manga-author-ken-ak<wbr>amatsu-renews-concerns-about-trade-<wbr>deals-effect-on-doujinshi-and-cospl<wbr>ay</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>   The Counsel for Negotiations is supposed to "negotiate". Anyone can blindly swallow demands, even a kid. I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. If they can't even do that, Japan may as well be America's dog. <br><br> This is in response to the TPP finalizing the copyright protection period as "70 years after the author's death", and non-Antragsdelikt. The latter means that anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. </br></br>  <br>Well, the problems with the TPP is that they're trying to force ISPs to become IP gatekeepers. Effectively meaning a huge censorship power will be forced upon them.</br>  http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/27-1/manga-author-ken-ak<wbr>amatsu-renews-concerns-about-trade-<wbr>deals-effect-on-doujinshi-and-cospl<wbr>ay</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I just don't care anymore. It seems like every other year something threatens my hobby and I go into panic mode. I just don't care anymore.  <br>Too late.<br><br>It already passed.<br><br>We fought hard.<br><br>There was an EPIC shitstorm on /pol/.<br><br>But I guess shitposting and memes are more important.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They win when you stop caring.</br>   Disney once again pays out the ass and changes the law to keep the Mouse   <br> http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-n<wbr>ews/2015/07/27-1/manga-author-ken-a<wbr>kamatsu-renews-concerns-about-trade<wbr>-deals-effect-on-doujinshi-and-cosp<wbr>lay</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr> </br>  The world is going to destructive apocalypse in a handbasket with the TPP and all people can talk about is a fucking blonde guy who won't even win the GOP primaries.<br><br>Fucking media are corporate scum.</br></br>  So, will anything actually happen? We had similar things before and not much happened.  <br>Did he always use two guns?</br>  <br><br><br>Could you stop this?</br></br></br>  <br> There was an EPIC shitstorm on /pol/. <br>Fuck off, we don't care about /pol/.</br></br>  <br>The only thing that passed was the Trade Promotion Authority.<br><br>And by only 10 votes in the US House. Yesterday, 11 Democrats who voted for it said they'll vote against the TPP if certain conditions aren't met. So there's still a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Companies rule the media too</br>  <br>Any butthurt faggot on the Internet can now report doujins for copyright infringement. So yes, it's huge. People will be more willing to take legal action.</br>  <br>So we all go irc, problem solved.</br>  So what? Why should doujins be the only exception from copyright laws?<br><br>This has been long overdue tbh</br></br>  <br> people will stop doujinshi from being made <br> we'll go to the IRC and so download the doujinshi that weren't made </br></br>  <br>TPP does not make doujinshi illegal though.</br>  First thing to do if this passes is takedown any yuri doujin scanlators/artists. <br>The storm is coming.</br>  <br>This also takes away the free advertisement for the author of the original source the doujins were made from. Even if the mangaka/anime studios don't have a problem with the doujins, if someone reports them they're gone.</br>  So wait did it already pass or is this just the monthly bitch thread about it?  <br>Doujins aren't exception, the copyright holders in Japan seriously don't care about people making them for basically no profit.<br><br>But now TPP would make it so that copyright holders in Japan not giving a damn about doujin makers doesn't matter, anyone can shut them down since it's violating copyright.</br></br></br>  <br>They never have been. But the companies that hold the rights never went after them because it would be absolutely terrible for business and possibly cripple the entire industry.<br>With this shit, they don't have a choice in the matter because other people will go after them for it.<br><br>It's like if the police were forced to press assault charges on your child because he hit you with a wooden bat and there was nothing you could do about it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Japanese industry already has copyright laws. They're putting shitty American laws on their copyright laws.<br><br>Copyright laws were created to protect creators. American copyright extends protections after the creator's death plus 70 years, which is stupid and stifles innovation that Japan has. Which is why we've gotten much more variety in anime/manga in Japan compared to the shit comic book capeshit we have in America.</br></br></br>  <br>What kind of retards came up with this shit?</br>  <br> tbh <br>Kill yourself<br><br> copyright laws <br>Copyright laws for the most part are stupid, and piracy should be supported. This sort of shit is bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>see <br>And that's in the States. But if it does go through all the way and Japan signs it (which is more or less decided), things go really south.<br><br><br>Corporate.</br></br></br></br></br>  How much time left?  Americans: Ruining everything since 1776<br><br>Thanks a lot you mobility scooter riding fleshbags full of shit. Go choke on some hamburgers.</br></br>  <br>Bigwigs who can actually profit from all this.</br>  <br> unauthorised depictions of copyrighted characters in copyrighted manga <br> not illegal </br></br>  <br>i dont know</br>  <br>Exactly.<br>TPP didn't change that.<br>Moron.</br></br></br>  <br>and that 70 years was after they extended it. see<br><br>Disney has twice paid enough people to get laws changed so they didn't give up Mickey Mouse and alot of other IPs</br></br></br>  <br>There are original doujinshi. Not all are parodies.</br>  Once again americucks ruin the world  thanks corporatism  I don't even care anymore  <br><br>4chan should block foreign IPs.</br></br>  <br>thanks usa</br>  Time to expand my panda folder,huh.  <br>Getting rid of over half of your site's traffic isn't exactly good business.</br>  <br>Curious why is Disney in danger of giving up the mouse and their IPs? Like aren't they actively using it?</br>  When will americans stop sucking corporate dick?  <br>It's irrelevant. Copyright is for a set period.</br>  <br>When they stop liking money.</br>  <br>When Hell freezes over.</br>  <br>And trademark is infinite as long as the ip is in active use.</br>  <br><br>You can't be this retarded. Surely.</br></br>  <br> I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. <br><br>Why are you all panicking?</br></br></br>  <br> most Americans being piss-poor but still believing that one day they'll be rich as fuck. </br>  <br><br><br>So if copyright ends but the trademark is active due to the ip being active, what consequences would befall Disney hypothetically speaking? I'm trying to grasp why they are trying so hard or these laws.</br></br></br>  <br>Elasticity will just make it more vague and therefore easier to abuse</br>  <br>Because Japan has no real power over international policy that's spearheaded by Murrica. They are America's dog, after all.</br>  <br>It would be easier to dodge the copyright stuff.</br>  <br>We disagree.<br><br><br>It's less about Mickey and more about all the other stuff that Disney has brought out back then, like movies etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Well, the problems with the TPP is that they're trying to force ISPs to become IP gatekeepers. <br><br>Nope, not gonna happen.<br>Nobody will support it since it goes against many rules of privacy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> most Americans still have the pride to not want to make a living leaching of other peoples money. <br><br>Yours is the most healthy country in the west at least in this respect</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any idea how much media disney owns?</br>  <br>But don't they actively use those movies and stuff in Disney World/Land/Sea/etc? I mean last I went they had fucking everything and then some, or at least to my limited knowledge.</br>  <br>Considering google, facebook and microshit are selling literally everything you do on your computer do you really think that has any relevance to anything? Not to mention all the NSA shit.<br><br>Privacy has been dead for a long time.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's why I'm asking.</br>  <br>One thing is spying on me, I know they can't do shit with that data, another thing is blocking my access to some sites.</br>  I thought there was already a thread for this.  <br> Nope, not gonna happen. <br>That's already the rule being negotiated now. The only countries with sizable populations against the TPP are Malaysia and the United States (only 38% support).<br><br>So what are you going to do?</br></br></br></br>  <br>And then you realize that you're actually the only person left.</br>  <br> people still don't know disney owns an absurd amount of the media </br>  <br> kikes <br> not owning everything <br><br>Pick one<br><br>"There's no such thing as public opinion, only Published opinion"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I know they can't do shit with that data <br><br>Do you seriously believe this?</br></br></br>  <br> Nobody will support it since it goes against many rules of privacy. <br>that's what deutschland said too, and look what happened</br></br>  <br>Have a look at the chart. Disney owns a decent chunk of all media you come across. Music, images, sport, TV, films, productions, news, etc.<br><br><br>Actually you can do an obscene amount with that data. I briefly worked for a company that collected data on CC transactions for a supermarket chain. The profiles you can build from just that is terrifyingly detailed. There was an uproar a few years ago because Target marketing department knew women were pregnant before they were and would send out advertising for pregnancy/baby stuff<br>http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmir<wbr>hill/2012/02/16/how-target-figured-<wbr>out-a-teen-girl-was-pregnant-before<wbr>-her-father-did/</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Feels good to not consume any of this media.<br> don't own a TV <br> don't listen to or read news <br> don't do anything online exept fap, 4chan, animu and mango <br><br>When I look at normalfags I feel like a modern day hermit, and it feels good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do ISPs censor stuff in germany?</br>  <br> don't listen to or read news <br>That's not something to feel good about.</br></br>  <br>Don't tell /a/ about the incoming 1984. You will get banned.</br>  <br>So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? sadpanda is gone because there's disney stuff there too.<br><br>Interested in sport? Too bad, anything from ESPN is gone too.</br></br></br>  <br>"News" is cancer.</br>  <br> &gt;don't listen to or read news <br>That's not a good thing.</br></br>  <br>Yeah unless you still have to pay for it<br> you have to pay for free tv even though you don't watch it <br> you have to pay for radio channels even though you don't listen to it <br> now they want you to pay for public traffic even though you don't use it <br><br>Living in Germany is fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? <br><br>Mass Suicide.</br></br></br>  So I better download all the doujins and fanart that exists of my waifu as soon as possible?  <br>Which data was used to reach that conclusion when the women didn't even know about their pregnancy?</br>  <br>Only if you're unable to reflect and filter.</br>  <br>What are you waiting for?</br>  <br>moot predicted that the entire internet would go dark as anons would invade every single community.</br>  <br>Why? I can't stop any of the bad shit happening and I don't want to worry about it since there's really nothing I can do, when I was younger I used to try. We don't have any control over stuff and this thread illustrates a prime example of that. I'll deal with it when it comes around.<br><br>Why do I need to know what's going on in someone's version of the 'news' which is likely just propaganda anyway? Why do I need to know that there was a horrible rail accident in another country? It doesn't effect me at all, the only people who need to know are normalfags who have to be able to hold conversations with other normalfags about what's going on in the world.</br></br></br>  <br> So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? <br>I'll do what I probably should have done a long time ago and reading good fiction and non fiction books in every minute of free time.</br></br>  <br>Because news tell you how much shit is going down. All I read in newspaper the last few days is "ISIS HERE, BOMBS FUCKING EVERYWHERE. HOW WAS IT POSSIBLE FOR THIS CAT TO CLIMB THIS TREE?"</br>  <br> So what happens when 4chan goes down due to people posting copyrighted disney material? <br><br>I'll either become serial killer or get into politics.</br></br></br>  <br> reading books <br><br>Fuck off, nerd.</br></br></br>  <br> Not reading alternative news <br><br>Your loss</br></br></br>  <br>Only if you want to get sued. It would be better that you forget about her before they start suing for thoughts as well.</br>  <br>Anon moves and infects every other community on the net. 4chan is a containment website, a majorly important one at that</br>  <br>How fast do you read? Because buying books constantly gets pretty pricey and it's not like you'll be able to pirate them.</br>  <br>Mangos are books, anon. And animes are moving mangos so books as well.</br>  <br> alternative news <br><br>For what? News are pretty much controlled by the media.<br>The Ebola case was a huge deal but then 10 days after there was not a single article about it as if that disease never happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that the same thing?</br>  <br>Pretty much. And I can't be bothered to spend an hour or two conducting independent research to find out about the what may be the truth behind the subject matter of an article I read that was concocted by some journalist jew with a shitty bias and an agenda. Only to learn that it was all half truths and omission but that I am, in fact, still fucked anyway because the government have made it a auto life sentence for microwaving your HDDs.</br>  <br>You don't need to buy new.<br>My father reads a lot and he goes to the flea market once per week to stock up on new books for 50 cent per piece.</br></br>  Revolution when?  <br> and it's not like you'll be able to pirate them. </br>  <br>The library is still a thing.</br>  <br>Dunno if you'd be able to do that since publishers don't get money from reselling books.</br>  <br>If you're that Kraut you might want to try Die Anstalt.<br>Otherwise, Last Week Tonight.</br></br>  Aside from signing the treaty, doesn't a country have to ratify it for it to become law? I can't imagine any truly democratic parliament (especially an upper house) passing a treaty that so heavily infringes upon a nation's right to independence and self-government. Isn't this the reason why Chairman Obama wants to FastTrak™ it? Japan especially would NEVER ratify a treaty which allows filthy foreigners to ravage it so hard.  <br> I can't imagine any truly democratic parliament <br>Shame there's no such thing</br></br>  <br>Except I don't and will never have a girlfriend or family so 90% of the drain most people experience on their finance doesn't apply to me, I live comfortably on very modest income.<br><br>However I still pirate my shit whenever I can.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Not reading alternative news <br>What, like Vice or The Onion? <br><br>More like alternative bias, amirite?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Die Anstalt <br>That already sounds like propaganda. What news do they cover for example?</br></br>  <br>Government is run by the highest bidder. Copyright holders are lobbying this in all their countries, that's why it's being fast tracked and kept in as much secrecy as they can to let it pass without any interruptions.</br>  <br>Anime is as big as it is because of doujins and fanart. If they want to kill their own business fucking let them.</br>  <br>That's not really true, the fact that the executive in the USA is being forced to use a non-democratic process to pass the treaty is testament to this.<br><br>The fact that such a process exists in the first place is a whole other story.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a satire show.<br>Differently from the old format "Neues aus der Anstalt", their focus is no longer on being funny but on actually trying to explain matters.<br>It's rather left-wing though, so you might dislike their view on topics.</br></br></br>  <br>Im not talking about liberal garbage<br><br>More like  "conspiratorial"  news</br></br></br>  <br> Vice <br> Onion <br> news <br><br>What news?<br>All they blogpost about is how it's wrong to be a white cis male.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The admins here don't seem to be worried, and that's enough proof for me. <br><br>Everything will be okay!</br></br></br>  仕方が無い  <br>D you even realize how sold out the American government (and not only) is? Why do you think people have been wanting for a long while to make it illegal for them to get paid by big corporation? Democracy is a nice sounding myth. Like everything else it doesn't work because of humans. You think CISA and whatever was bad? This the same thing on a world scale including things outside the internet too giving complete control to companies to outsource their work force, make laws that suit them, spy on you in case you do something that might cost them money and completely not care about any consumer friendly laws. The TPP lets America outsource to Asia. TTIP lets them sell in Europe, while sharing all the other crap. This is so bad, it sounds like some dystopian fiction, while being real.</br>  <br>Why the hell isn't lobbying illegal already?<br>Nothing good ever comes from it. Only corruption.</br></br>  OK EVERYBODY<br><br>This is the gameplan.<br><br>Contact all of your representatives telling them that you will vote for the most anti-TPP (Pacific)/TTIP (Atlantic) party in your country if multi-party parliament.<br><br>Contact all of your representatives and tell them to oppose TPP if you are from the US (you have 2 senators and 1 congressman).<br><br>During this time, start revving up your downloading services from sadpanda, danbooru, pixiv, batoto, horriblesubs or whatever.<br><br>Also, buy hard drive disks by staggered pairs, so that you will have backups of your downloads, and since they are staggered, they probably came from different batches, increasing chances of having shitty ones at the same time.<br><br><br>Let's go anons. Time to stop this shit TPP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anno will save us.</br>  <br> Only corruption. <br>Exactly.<br>So why would the benefactors outlaw it?</br></br></br>  I came here to check dubs, where are they?  <br> Why the hell isn't lobbying illegal already? <br>$$$</br></br>  <br> Last Week Tonight. <br>That shit is SJW infested shit. If it panders to politically correct shits, it's useless. Bill Maher is better.</br></br>  <br>That's anon, I need to laugh today.</br>  <br>Democracy wont solve this Anon, either bomb your parliament or shoot up some politicians. It's the only thing that's going to work.</br>  I, for one, welcome the great tangification  <br>Sweet trips.</br>  <br>Stop being an idiot. We stopped SOPA and ACTA through mass voter mobilization. We can do it again against this fucking monster of a trade agreement.</br>  <br>I'll try him out.<br>And for the record, I've got nothing against people with an agenda, so long as I understand it.<br>I'll just filter out anything that doesn't fit my own view.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't do shit against something which is 90% supported by corporate lobbyists.</br>  <br>I'm not even going to argue that point anymore.<br>ISIS and other assorted mujahedeen proved you can literally crush the democrashits to pulp and make them suck your cock even if they outnumber you 1000 to 1. <br><br>In the end the man with the gun makes the laws, sheep are free to vote, their vote means jack shit if you put a bullet in their heads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The main Opposition party in Australia will pass it because they care more about getting elected than acting in the public interest.</br>  <br>I live in a nonfactor country with a party in charge that won't change soon, so I guess I sit this out.</br>  <br><br>Getfaggotry is against the rules.<br>Try .</br></br></br>  <br>Both SOPA and ACTA were supported by corporate lobbyists, man. And they were defeated. We have to mobilize voters to contact their reps. That's the best way of dealing with this.</br>  <br>That was when 4chan and reddit wasn't completely controlled and compromised.<br><br>And don't forget coprorations and banks put big money into this, so do you really think we can win this one?</br></br></br>  <br>No need to get so upset /pol/.</br>  <br>SOPA and ACTA were small fried compared to this shit. And this time there is not uncle Google, papa Wiki and others telling you that you have to fight for your freedom.</br>  <br>I'll remind you ACTA passed in Japan.</br>  <br>Who's going to lobby against lobbying?</br>  <br> Both SOPA and ACTA were supported by corporate lobbyists, man.  <br>Nowhere near to the extent of these trade agreements.</br></br>  <br> tfw you live in DC and have no meaningful representative <br><br><br>I know you're baiting, but mass shootings/bombings have never successfully advanced someone's agenda. It just makes you and the cause look crazy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And they were defeated. <br>Not in Japan, shill.</br></br>  <br> Both SOPA and ACTA were supported by corporate lobbyists, <br>No, they were supported by Hollywood while other large companies were opposed to it.<br>Most of the drive against them came from those companies who made us think that "we" did it.<br>"We" did not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing you meant "thanks"?<br><br>Either way, it's good that you're relaxed. The admins are, too.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>CONTACT YOUR REPS, YOU HOOLIGANS.</br></br></br></br>  inb4 the law is passed and nothing changes.<br><br>The media stirred some big shit in France back when the anti-piracy law Hadopi was about to get voted. A few years after, nothing fucking happened and a lot of people pirate without concern. Sure, there might have been some high-scale downloaders that got arrested (and I'm pretty sure the Megaupload incident scared off some casual pirates) but so far, I haven't heard of people getting warning letters or shit like this, neither have I gotten one.</br></br>  <br> America has an official form of political corruption <br>I'm so shocked by this. Truly the land of the free.</br></br>  <br>I'd threaten them with a gun to their heads if that counts as lobbying against lobbying</br>  <br>Lobbying is still technically an expression of democracy and free spech, so laws against it wouldn't survive a legal challenge. It'd probably take a referendum to fix it, and even that might not be an option.</br>  <br>I think we're past the point where it matters if the majority thinks we look crazy or not. I'd like to remind you that the tyranny of mob rule is why we're in this mess to begin with.<br><br> also I'd like to see an armed mobilization of NEETs and weaboos ala ISIS that'd be hilarious </br></br></br>  <br>NO<br><br>SHIT IS FUCKED UP<br><br>IT'S THE END<br><br>ONLY ONE SOLUTION LEFT<br><br>SUDOKU NOW</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mass shootings/bombings have never successfully advanced someone's agenda <br>Oh yeah?<br>What about Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan?<br>Now it's spreading to Turkey.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem with TTP is that some lawyer could literally walk into comiket, make a few photos and then start sueing the shit out of the doujin circles even if the original author is okay with the doujin circles copying his characters.<br><br>And someone probably will do this because he can earn money with it.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw i would probably stop coming to a local clinic i work to because the boredom will me without dem animus <br> tfw i would probably go mushishi and travel everywhere and be a travelling shameless doctor <br> tfw all the things i cared and loved are dead <br><br>life aint fair</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know for you but I ain't risking my life so that anons can fap to their doujins.</br>  <br><br> be ausfailian <br> govt has americuck dick so far up their arse they're the first link on sadpanda if you search all the way through tags <br> be living in japan <br> filthy gaijin so I can't contact anyone </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They should make the russian army handle that. Just look at the chechens. Cuckmericans can't do shit.</br>  <br>Maybe we'll meet each other on our travels, Anon. We can tell stories of better days.</br>  What's /pol/'s favorite anime?  <br>I'm not Clapistani. Australian politicians are useless. The only pollies who have tried to do anything have more or less been told by the government to keep quiet and wait for more information.</br>  <br> not suing the lawyer for their own copyright infringement </br>  <br>There used to be regular LOGH threads on /pol/,</br>  <br>Russia doesn't have enough money to pay off all the mujahedeen in the Middle East. Heck they barely had enough money to pay off the chechens.<br><br> ywf Russia is basically paying jiziya now <br><br>L<br>O<br>L</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Netherlands here<br>We're doing all we can</br></br>  <br> PR <br> Privatized water industry <br>Uh, no.<br><br>Copyright is tough enough as it is, why not just leave it alone?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Americucks haven't had any military success since WW2</br>  <br> pay  <br>What? They should pay them in lead. Kill all of them including the children. You know the good old russkie way.</br></br>  <br> There was an uproar a few years ago because Target marketing department knew women were pregnant before they were and would send out advertising for pregnancy/baby stuff <br><br>Actually, the uproar was because Target knew the girl (who if I remember right was underage, and if not was definitely still living with her parents) was pregnant before HER FATHER knew, and when they sent her baby ads he took it as Target trying to push girls to become unwed (teenage?) mothers. Again, not realizing his daughter was a slut who was already knocked up.</br></br></br>  <br>fuck /pol/ they are an inverted version of tumblr sjws</br>  <br>Fuck off retard, you are in /pol/ territory now fuck off.</br>  <br>These aren't anti-piracy laws. They are trade agreements. Trade agreements with terrible clauses. <br><br>Trade is the strongest political force in the world, always has been. There is a reason why people like Google and Wikipedia aren't up in arms about it this time. We are dealing with a different monster altogether.</br></br></br>  <br>So why is it that amerifags have such a boner for weapons but when a chance to use them appear they never use them<br>Doesn't your right to bear guns exist only for this sole purpose?</br></br>  <br>That was brought up in the last topic and promptly ignored by the americucks</br>  <br>What do they gain from sending troops somewhere?</br>  <br> WW2 <br> success <br>Cleaning off the leftover dirt is not a success.</br></br></br>  <br>If the original author is alright with it, then it should be ok. Sueing someone for using someone else's characters despite the person being okay with it is a waste of time and energy, and it's only going to waste some money in judicial affairs for a non-existent gain in term of corporate affairs. They'd have to sue the person REALLY hard to cover all the expenses, and all of this for nothing because it won't improve at all the numbers of official merch selling (it might even lower them through boycott).<br><br>I'm pretty sure manga authors and anime studios are aware what makes money, and will prevent such shit from happening, they are not stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>No really fuck off /pol/tard. <br>All you faggots are capable of is crying about people not accepting your delusions about race and other social politics bullshit.</br></br>  <br>I dunno what would a a military based economy gain from a military action which also wins them natural resources and soft power?</br>  <br>Now the popular opinion in America is very anti gun, unless it's in the hands of law enforcement. I need to get out of this country</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure manga authors and anime studios are aware what makes money, and will prevent such shit from happening, they are not stupid. <br><br>Pretty much this. People forget that anime producers have their own lobby shit. It is safe to assume they are doing their job and try to get some loopholes into TPP.</br></br></br>  <br>Hearts and minds :^)</br>  <br> If the original author is alright with it, then it should be ok. <br><br>TTP literally changes that fact. That's the core of the problem for /a/-related material.<br>If there's a copyright infringement anyone can sue, even if the original author is okay with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waste some money in judicial affairs <br>That's the point. Lawyers' pockets get fatter and they barely have to do anything.</br></br>  <br> If there's a copyright infringement anyone can sue, <br>why did anyone think thats a good idea?</br></br>  <br>I don't see how that can possibly protect the third party lawyers from the original creators for fucking around with their shit. Don't tell me the copyright holders can't sue the lawyers back?</br>  <br> If the original author is alright with it, then it should be ok <br>But that's the point of TPP.<br>Even if the original author is ok with it, they have no say about people suing doujinshi authors.<br><br>Besides, the main problem with this is that TPP may affect entire doujinshi and image aggregate sites and shut them down.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't it be? This way corporations have their copyrights protected without having to shill out money to do so. Win-win.</br>  <br>Because it allows Clapistani lawyers to get filthy stinking fucking rich.</br>  <br> Don't tell me the copyright holders can't sue the lawyers back? <br>nope</br></br>  <br> copyright holders already don't sue doujinshi authors <br> going to sue high-power lawyers </br></br>  <br>Of course they can't. They'd be acting well within the law.</br>  <br> Why do you think people have been wanting for a long while to make it illegal for them to get paid by big corporation? <br><br>I've always wondered what keeps this from happening. It's clearly the only way to make things more fair.</br></br></br>  <br>But is anybody really going to do this? People and judges will know that this sueing won't benefit the author but some high-class judicial cucks and will directly label are pure greed. This is irrelevant, sueing because someone else's is in danger is the legal equivalent of giving yourself momentarily the rights to this property, which outlawed. The corporates really are turning this world upside-down.</br>  <br>Avoiding the news is something that makes you feel good if the news depresses you anyway.</br>  <br><br>That is literally the most ass backwards retarded shit I've ever read. <br>And I fucking use literally sparingly.</br></br></br>  <br>I know a lot of people who have earned a beautiful letter, anon.</br>  <br> But is anybody really going to do this? <br>No one's gonna turn down free money.<br>They don't even have to directly go to court.

They are normal duels, except they ride bikes. There's nothing to explain.</br>  <br><br>There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds. But the writers duped us and instead of using Speed Spells, they chose Action Cards.<br><br>Slimy fucks</br></br></br></br>  <br> reading <br> in a fucking public location <br><br>This makes absolutely no sense<br><br>How did you get to the library? Your car? Where do you sleep at night? Your house? <br><br>Why choose to go to neither of those places, in the comfort of your own area, instead of at a public place?<br><br>People who actually read at the library are hazards of life</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise but are even cheaper because you don't need to draw them and those don't rely on Speed Counters to activate.</br>  <br> There were actually people getting buttmad about the chance of Speed Spells returning as they are just bullshit cards that have literally what effects that can change the duel around in seconds <br>As opposed to regular spells and traps? At least Angel Baton led to skilly as fuck plays</br></br>  <br> reading comprehension <br><br>I was talking about the title of the card, asshole</br></br></br>  Greydles are fucking stupid<br>That is all</br>  <br>NTR-V<br>T<br>R<br>V</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w4w<wbr>q5_5dUhE</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Masked Hero players are angry virgins </br></br>  <br>So is your mom.</br>  <br>What's wrong with being a waifufag anon? I literally made a deck with mine and the Red-Eyes cards in CORE set thanks that they are Lv 7, but after this I have to search another alternative, if you don't like it, don't buy it, I for sure am not gonna waste money for Konami and their rarity fetish, so I just stick with other ideas.</br>  <br>Does anyone have videos of duels where people are losing or do lose and throw a fit?<br><br>Neckbeards getting mad at a card game would be hilarious</br></br></br>  <br>When the opening of the season replaced the Action Duel thing with the Riding Duel, I had hope that we would get a break from them. I don't know about you guys but it kinda kills tension for me most of the time when a guy can always get a card that bails him out just by reaching offscreen and pulling one. At least resources have to be used with situational stuff. I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum. I just wanted a break from Action Duels.</br>  <br> I was talking about the title of the card, asshole <br> What the fuck does that even say <br><br>No, i'm pretty sure you just didnt make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br> OP 4 will never be done by Nona Reeves <br><br>Kill me.</br></br></br>   tfw I read the script now and Gongenzaka has Pendulum <br>Now I can expect something for Yuzu right?</br>  <br>She still has her generic Pendulums.</br>  <br>They've both had Pendulum since the Championship.</br>  <br> Now I can expect something for Yuzu right? <br>No. Gon is working for Reiji who gave everyone Pendulums. Yuzu won't have Melodious Pendulums for now at least.</br></br>  <br>The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot.<br><br>I think you are just being retarded and reeling me in with this b8</br></br></br>  <br>Reiji probably just walked into her room and handed her new Pendulums. He does whatever the fuck he wants.</br>  <br> I doubted Speed Spells because they mess up Pendulum <br>Why? They don't even treat Pendulums like they are half Spell Cards in the anime.</br></br>  Tadaima  <br>There are no Kingus among us, we'd all scrub out against each other and just draw constantly.</br>  <br> Fun thing is that Action Cards have basically the same function as Speed Spells plotwise <br><br>Not really. Speed Spells work just like regular spells just that they a little more restricted. <br>Speed Spell and Speed Counters were great because contrary to their name they slowed the game down and both player had to built up their counters before doing the big plays. Meanwhile Arc-V duels don't last longer than three turns for the most part</br></br></br></br>  <br>All could have been resolved if he was there instead.<br><br>I bet Chojiro could bring Sora's EGAO back.</br></br></br>  <br> I just dropped by to say hello and hope you ENJOY your stay at LDS' very own Maiami Medical Function </br>  <br> The title of the card is so tinted in gray that you can barely (BARELY) make out even one of the words, faggot. <br>Oh, so I was right the first time then<br> Why cant I read the low rez blurry scan? <br>The English version of the card isnt even out retard, all we have is CAC version and the shitty scans Konami just put up</br></br></br></br>  <br>jokes on you, i dont local/tourny i just enjoy spellcaster decks. and i dont see how that "wrecked" me in anyway only thing i wrecked was your mom last night faggot.</br>  <br>Activating a Pendulum in the Pendulum Scale counts as activating a Spell Card.</br>  <br>That would be Serena's room he's going to walk into, not Yuzu's. And Serena won't be using those Pendulums for a long while, just like Shun-niichan.</br>  <br>This really looks legit</br>  <br>Pendulums become Spell Cards in the Scale Zone, it's like this in the anime too. Spell Destruction can easily ruin Pendulums.</br>  <br>there are very few videos but they are in the pits of youtube....</br>  <br><br>They could've easily made an exception rule for pendulums.</br></br>   Gogenzaka getting sent into a labor camp <br>He's probably going to befriend everybody there just like he did in prison, won't he.<br><br>It'll be hilarious if Gongenzaka is actually the one to end up uniting the Commons against the Tops.</br></br></br>  If I was Dan Green I'd learn whatever I could about competitive YGO, then enter tournaments under a pseudonym. Then once I sit down to games I'd mindbreak them by detailing every play I make in full Yami voice.  <br>Serena probably wont ever use them honestly, she's too prideful to Fusion. Besides what would her Pendulums even be, Moonlight Silver Crane and Moonlight Brown Raccoon?</br>  <br> just like Shun-niichan. <br><br>R-Ruri?</br></br></br>  Recently I was watching Monster Musume because I wanted to start watching ecchi anime, and after the third episode, I just though about how a Yu-Gi-Oh! harem ecchi anime would be and what monsters would appear, big points if Dark Magician Girl is just support Ms. Smith tier instead of one of the girls. Whaddya think?  <br>I say you should leave this place before you get your ass kicked and carded.</br>  <br>They'd be broken then. It'd be a lot harder to get rid of them and you'd almost certainly have to use certain monster effects to get rid of the Pendulums as opposed to the actual monsters on the field.</br>  <br>More like Yuya will make her pendulums though the magic pendant to give as a gift to her after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ and then finally Pendulum. And Yuya goes in reverse gaining Pendulum first then XYZ/Pendulum then Synchro/Pendulum and then finally Fusion/Pendulum.</br>  <br>Are you Shun or Sora? If you are Shun you can be part of that show with 4 Ruris. If you are Sora leave please I don't want fusion scum near me.</br>  <br>If every episode is a beach episode then sure, I'm down...maybe cute date episodes too.</br>  <br> after she gains XYZ summoning to complete the cycle of her going from Tribute to Fusion to Synchro to XYZ <br>Not too long ago you guys were sure as sure she'd learn XYZ during the championship arc. Maybe its time to accept Standard people learning multiple summoning methods (besides Pendulum) will mainly be reserved for Yuya and Reiji</br></br>  <br>Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it. Everyone else has their reasons for their specific summoning methods. <br><br>And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means.</br></br></br>  I have a feeling that Masumi and Yaiba will be sent to Synchro as back up at some point.<br><br> And Masumi will Xyz Summon Gem-Knight Pearl </br></br>  <br>I doubt that will happen, but boy it will be popular.<br><br> cute date episodes too. <br>I ship Yosenju Kamamitachi (3) with Harpie Girl and Harpie Dancer so if something like this happen it will be perfect.</br></br></br></br>  <br> rock up to your local <br> agree to duel some guy <br> you both sit down <br> IT'S TIME TO DUEL <br> wait what the fu- <br> I PLACE ONE CARD FACE DOWN AND END MY TURN </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sawatari is probably the only person beside them that'll learn it, he just fits the mold for it <br>He seems to be more the Advanced summon guy than anything, he even did it with Yosenju<br><br> And so far all the Ruris have used Fusion, whatever that means. <br>We can be pretty sure Rin hasnt, and hopefully Ruri hasnt or Shun will cry</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ooh, and Yaiba could pull out Invoker.</br>  <br>We have to find out if she Synchro summons when it is her turn in the tournament. If she does then it is a good likelihood of her learning all summoning methods. The irony is that the timing would fit since right now soon there will be a Synchro booster set, followed by a XYZ booster set and if the pattern follows a Fusion booster set announced soon after that.</br>  <br> other guy spends 5 minutes playing solitaire <br> declares his attack <br> mirror force <br> starts raging <br> MIND CRUSH <br> silence all around <br> Dan just gets up and struts off proud of himself </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  High Speed Ruris.  <br>As a big Ecchi fan, that will be the best thing ever. Besides the classic ones, I think that they can put monsters that don't have anime or manga appearances based on<br> Level <br> Rank <br> Summon Method <br> Extra Deck <br> Ritual <br>And I think that Rituals will be either the most bullied for being non-Extra Deck or the most difficult to date because of their non-Extra Deck, but they will be the most worthwhile in both cases.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, Sawatari is a lot like Yuya honestly, I could see him slowly starting to incorporate the other summoning methods.</br>  <br>Konami needs to release his archetype first though.</br>  <br>Multiple summoning methods is portrayed as a really highly skilled thing, Yuyas only able to do it because DRAGONS. I love Shingo, but I dont think he has the skill for it</br>  <br>At this point anything is possible. We really haven't seen much of the Underworld Troupe, besides that it's Pendulum. Hell, it could just be a pure Pendulum deck with a Pendulum boss.</br>  <br>not just dragons anon don't forget Yuzu</br>  <br>Before being stuck with troupe, he did study and incorporate new strategies (monarch deck, pendulum strategy with Yosenju), so him picking up stuff is not impossible.<br>With the scale 1-8 pendulums, 2500 Ace and ENTERTAINMENT DUEL focus, he is pretty much trying to be Yuya, so he could copy that too</br></br>  <br>Hiiiii</br>  <br>Sawatari has skill, he's just dumb and arrogant, like Serena. He clearly knows how decks and cards work outside of his first appearance/duel which he fucked up, everything after that he's been pretty on point and look at his deck now. <br><br> Pendulum <br> 2500 Ace <br> Entertainment Dueling <br> Bugging Yuya in the Manzai and trying to be his friend <br><br>He's trying to emulate Yuya, after seeing Gon Pendulum Synchro, I'd imagine he'd want to get even stronger himself and prove that he's not a weakling and holding people back. He's going to have that one amazing moment in Academia where he just goes off, but still fails in the end due to keikaku by Yuri or Dennis or some shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   &gt; Black Stone of Legend is a secret rare <br>YAMEROOOOOO</br>  <br>yuya a cute!</br>  <br><br>I want Sawatari to step his game up so badly, but even after repeatedly getting BTFO he thinks he's good, so he'll never git gud ;____;</br></br>  <br>What if he actually did lose on purpose though? We'll never know, like why do kids love cinnamon toast crunch?</br>  <br>But we still don't know what all of his new Underworld Troupe deck is like.</br>  <br> World where you can summon (by a big price) your monster and be with you <br> Level and Rank are usually rivals unless they have the same numbers, also numbers don't have any effect whatsoever <br> Normal/Non-Effect monsters and Effect monsters don't get along very well <br> There are multiple copies monsters in the worlds, but you can only summon 1 monster, and it have to be one that you opened in a booster (there are exceptions) <br> Monsters that you summon in real life depends on this: <br> Any Main Deck monster other than Pendulum and Ritual: they can get along very well with you and be bros <br> Ritual: the most hardest to summon because you have to Tribute something (though not necesarily lifes as a Hungry Burger was summoned using 6 burger found in the trash), and still will appreciate/support you/love you forever because you sacrifice something for them, depending on the genre/type/attribute they could be the best ones for anything, even better than Xyz in many cases, but you need to develop your relationship with them <br> Fusion: usually the more easier in some cases but not so worthy, because they were summoned using more than 1 monster, they almost always have some different personalities, but if you learn to deal with it, they are like the Main deck ones <br> Synchro: the most interesting ones as you can bring any Synchro monster with different monster and anything can happen, if you bring a Tempest Magician with an Effect Veiler she can get some breast complex <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br> Pendulum: literally newcomers and people need to wait for more information. <br> fuck my autism </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But we do, we know they're funky and sassy</br>  <br> Xyz: literally the most easier and popular, they are like Rituals minus the summon difficulty and they are slight inferior in personality to the blue cards, Xyz is the one who people prefer these days <br>I sense some butthurt</br></br>  <br>Ritual master race reporting in.</br>  <br>Are ritual Red-Eyes better than Xyz spam the whole field?</br>  <br> XYZ spam <br> in front of Lord of the Red <br>That would be fun to watch.</br></br></br>  <br>Uhh isn't Flare Metal dragon not destroyed by card effects while it has Xyz?? Also Return of Red-Eyes still summons a Red-Eyes even when destroyed</br>  <br> not using both <br><br>I love having Lord of the Red, Flare Metal, Archfiend Black Skull Dragon, and Azure Eyes Silver Dragon all on the field. I hope Red-Eyes get their own Synchro.</br></br></br>  How can I ENJOY the card game when my favorites archetypes are expensive, Konami-kun?<br><br>I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid. There is any other good cards on Clash of Rebellions which may become Secret Rare too on TCG?<br><br>Also, I miss Future Fusion/Dragon's Mirror combo to summon 2 FGDs.</br></br></br></br>  So when will Academia ruin the Friendship Cup? Before Yugo beats Yuya or when Dennis reveals he is a traitor like Jack?  <br>Archfiend Black Skull Dragon seems too slow with Red-Eyes fusion and has no protection</br>  <br> draw red-eyes fusion <br> use it to summon ABSD right away <br>It's pretty fast. And it's a pet deck, who cares if it doesn't have protection on it. It's meant for  fun .</br></br></br>  <br>I really love the design of the Xyz Red-Eyes.</br>  <br><br>But what I'm saying i that the anime doesn't treat them as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>Was that confirmed or are you just saying that?</br>  <br>When I mean slow I mean you can't summon/special summon anything else but yeah your right this deck is meant for fun</br>  <br>I'm going off the fact that no cards that have been used so far that target, negate, or destroy S/T's have been used on Pendulums<br><br>Also, even though the character point out "So Pendulum cards go to the Extra Deck" no one has made a remark like "So Pendulum card are half Monster half Spell?"</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sawatari couldn't have used Cricket Close in his first duel with Yuya if the Pendulums weren't treated as Spell Cards</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure it does</br>  <br>Ah you're right, my apologies then.</br>   TCG will never make mill viable   <br> What is BA <br>Hot garbage that somehow still manages to live<br> What is Diamond killing any and all mill decks <br>The reason why BA is hot garbage</br></br></br></br>  So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right?  <br>So, if I have an Herald of Ultimateness, will he be like, my most perfect attorney?</br>   Stratos still banned for 10+ seasons in murrica, while its not in Japan <br><br>Someone please do jihad on konami or murrica</br></br>  <br> he summons HoU <br> he always get in trouble because he is your typical bad luck brian "law version" <br> tfw he can be declared not guilty in every courtroom but he tries to be lawful till the end even if he sucks at it. <br>I actually love this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>One of Monarch's biggest issues is ratios between themselves and fodder. Looks like he focused solely on monarchs and tributing his partners' monsters in a tag duel like a real scumbag.</br>  <br>Someone needs to fire Tewart</br>  <br>Do you not know what mill is?</br>  <br><br>No he didn't. He did exactly what he would have done had he not realized that. It's just to make Gon   and his butthurt fans   feel better about losing. Otherwise he'd go on and cry the next episodes about how he failed to avenge Yuya</br></br>  <br> I play with Red-Eyes cards from the beggining, this is fucking stupid <br> Trying to be hipster for a deck that was used in the original anime <br>Anon please</br></br></br>  <br> So we all agree Gon lost on purpose once he realized Crow was fighting for the kids right? <br>Gonfags are so delusional. They dont even understand the character they keep defending if they think that's something he'd ever do</br></br>  <br>KoA's evil truly knows no bounds.</br>  <br><br>It's not real Gonfags. It's just buttmad Crowhaters pretending to be Gonfags. You'll notice that every character wins will suddenly have an obnoxious "fanbase" that wanted to see their character win. Heck I bet even fucking Shinji will suddenly have a rabbid and butthurt fanbase when Crow wins against him next round</br></br>  Who will card ENJOY? I bet its that traitor Jack or Bennis  <br>Of Black Stone in Japanese? Like 200 yen. A playset of Ultra Flare Metal Dragons is about 900 yen. Although it'll be like $10 and $40 respectively for Burgerland.</br>  <br>  Crow <br>You mean Tsukikage?</br></br>  Reminder this will play at the last episode at the very last scene of Arc-V<br>https://<span>youtu.be/DRSxtqO9ajc  [ ]</br>  <br>I can see it now<br><br> HE HAS NO RELEVANCE WHY DID HE WIN <br> WHY IS HE EVEN A LANCER? <br> HE'S A FUCKING BODYGUARD NOT A FIGHTER <br> ninjas riding motorcycles <br> SHINJI WAS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT <br> WHO EVEN USES NINJAS ANYMORE? THAT WAS SO ZEXAL <br> I HOPE HE GETS CARDED </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I mean after Shinji beats Tsukikage and Crow and Shinji face off in round 2</br></br>  <br>I was talking about the stone. $10 bucks sound reasonable.</br>  <br> Implying it won't be Passionate Duelist Arc-V version because you know Yugi is going to be tied up in all this shit </br>  <br>Me, I misread and thought you were talking about if Tsukikage won</br>  <br><br> Enjoy is now a permanent member of the cast <br> yfw </br></br></br>  <br>Nah I prefer worst ED to be played instead</br>  <br>Nah he was just happy he lost to someone with purpose and someone with guts to make sacrifices (aka Crow losing LP on purpose) to make better gains.</br>  <br><br>On the other hand Yuya shouldn't have been able to use misdirection wing if Pendulum cards count as Spell and trap cards. <br><br>Speaking of misdirection wing I wonder when Yuya will use it again. It's one of his most powerful cards and Reiji needed serious bullshit to get past that</br></br></br></br>  Have me, Shun  YUZUUUU I AM COMING JUST FOR YOU  <br>I'd wait to see if it's a bust Secret. Although Kinka-Byo is fucking $7 and the Critias cards did get stupidly high.<br><br>I hate importing OCG singles because it's always scalped. I'd rather just buy boxes from AmiAmi if they had any. CORE sold like lightning compared to DOCS.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, but that ending is so bad</br>  <br><br>I love how there's people who act like Gon lost on purpose when he did nothing of the sorts while the entire episode revolved around how Crow wasn't even paying attention to the duel implying he would have had a much easier time winning had he played serious from the start. (Shinji points out that Crow made a rushed start, implying his opening move wasn't his usual playstyle, Crow kept looking at the audience every 5 seconds and he even points out himself how he should have put his monsters in defense position)<br><br>Gon had absolutely no way of winning this duel at all.</br></br></br></br>  Ending of Arc-V will involve  Yuzu dumping Yuya's ass for irrelevant Masumi   I thought Gon vs Crow was gonna be a two parter.<br>Looks like we'll get Shota NTR instead</br>  <br><br>Was it confirmed that it's bracket system? Or are pairs randomly determined after evety round?</br></br>  <br>INSIDE YUYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>It's probably random pairs, look at the reactions of Yuya, Yuzu and Dennis, no one knows who is vsing who.</br>  <br>Shut up Masumifag, go back to Tumblr writing shipping fanfics.</br>  <br>Considering what Dennis said about all technological forms of communication being scrambled across dimensions, do you think Best Dad and company are watching the Friendship Cup from Standard with Mieru's Crystal Apple Uranai Baba-style?</br>  <br>But we get unrestricted RotA in place, which helps more decks out.</br>  What happened to mono?  <br>mono is kill</br>  <br>Too busy playing fighting games and getting aids to sub children's card games.</br>  <br><br>YGO EP066 Status: <br>Script/Timing - In Progress<br>QC - <br>Uploading -<br>(65 is on the backburner to be finished after 66)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I will never be ready for this episode, holy shit.  <br>Protip: It never gets better.</br>  <br/>  <br>No, definitely. The remaining five episodes are all very good, but 59 is the high point of 5D's, for sure.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about the quality of the series.  ;_; </br>  <br> Something in heaven was killed. <br><br>Jesus christ who the fuck named these decks? It's as fucked up as crazy Aki's deck names.</br></br></br>  <br>Well on the other hand consider Lucciano's decks. I tend to think he and Sora could have been great friends.</br>  So I believe long ago I told this thread that Majespecters would be the next level degenerate scum. Look how they turned out.  <br> I played my first Majespector opponent during the day the update was launch and I was sincerely surprised at how utterly ass devastated the guy I dueled was when I beat them with my Jack Atlas deck<br><br>I've never built a deck before and to see it do so well is rather uplifting</br></br></br>  <br>My  dick! </br>   Still no Abyss, Belial or King Calamity on devpro <br>I can't kingu to this</br>  So /a/, what old card would you like to see new support. I vote for my nigga here  <br>Lmao isn't devpro supposed to be faster at updating than percy?</br>  God, I just want to see Yuya and Yugo duel each other already. Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon vs Clear Wing Synchro Dragon is just too hype.  <br>I just want them to go D R A G O N S on each other</br>  <br>Seiyaryu. My cardfu back in the day.</br>  <br>I want to see new Magnet Warrior support</br>  <br>Thunder Dragon</br>  <br>You could always play...ARG format pff. <br> people were actually ok with losing 3 bubbleman to get fucking stratos. </br></br>  Anyways as badass as Gon's new synchro looks I hope it does more than get HUGE though maybe his deck will become more pendulum focused since that was a pretty high power combo for anime. 5k!!!!!  <br> Lmao <br><br> ... <br> pff. </br></br></br></br>  Shun is shorter than Reiji, what a manlet.  <br>I actually want Tsukikage to win now.</br>  <br>How tall is Reiji, exactly?</br>  <br>pshh...nothin personnel...kid</br>  <br>He's not winning. Did you forget the scene in the OP? It's the only one bar Reji confronting Leo and Yugo vs Yuya that hasn't happened yet.</br>  <br>It's happened. Tsukikage was protecting Reira from Security.</br>  <br>If the scenes in the OP are anything to go by, Yuya, Yugo, Yuzu, and Crow will advance, while Gongenzaka, Serena, Tsukikage and Sawatari will drop out.</br>  <br>Not stated, I'd say 1.78 at most.<br>Have a Marco sensei.</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for my LDS rocket.</br>  <br>Waiting forever.</br>  <br>Can he ever catch a break from his winning streak?</br>  <br> Serena will lose </br>  <br>you know mad chimera did shoot a rocket at Blaze falcon in sora vs shun 1</br>  Why can't you be more like /dng/, /a/?  <br><br><br>How about you fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Tag Force 4 was a special game.</br>  <br>EGAO World hatsudo</br>  <br>She'll have to lose eventually if we make it to the end of the tournament. The only question is who defeats her. I'd like to see her duel Yuzu, but Bennis will probably take her out.</br>  <br>Is it bad to get an erection from the names of decks?</br>  <br>nigga those Aki deck's names IIRC</br>  <br>Explains why I have a throbbing erection, then.</br>  <br>You're likely right. Fusion nuts seem to be into keeping a clean win record and always going back to defeat who beat them before. Hmm, I kinda want this because they could show us what card Dennis planed on using on her before he noticed the obelisk force.</br>  Tell me /a/ what cards do you want to see cameo's of? Mine would be pic related.  <br>Fucking hate that fucking card.</br>  why did they choose to put the worst elements of 5d's into arc-v?    I can't for them to leave Synchro Dimension and we never see Crow again until he lays the finishing blow upon the final boss because Konami thinks everyone loves Crow.  Not enough fanservice.   return 1 BW <br> increase ATK until next draw <br>holy shit this card so good</br></br>  <br>You cannot attack though, so meh?</br>  <br> still no shirtless Yuuya </br>    <br> le Gale recycler <br>Its difficult to actually lv3 Synchro in Blackwings though.</br></br>  <br>Have meido Yuya.</br>  <br>Acceptable replacement</br>  <br>Oh right cannot attack, only good for first turn then</br>  <br> Look at thumbnail <br> "Why are her legs so short?" <br> That was from her knees down, didn't realize the middle area was her thighs and butt </br></br></br>  <br>There is also the bride Yuya.</br>  <br>So Shun would be about Yusei's height of 1.75?<br> tfw 1.76 <br>I-I'm 1.78 in shoes, so maybe I can wear a scarf and go full Reiji</br></br></br>  So does this mean Monosubs won't ever release 65 or what  <br>66 is taking priority. He'll probably release both around the same time.</br>  tfw it actually 3 different lv 3 BW synchro  <br> One can become a tuner <br> one can recover cards from graveyard <br> one minuses to deal 300 damage <br>One of these doesn't belong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>300 damage anon. That 3/40 of their life points!</br>  <br><br>All three can become tuners I believe. We don't know what the secondary eff of the third one is</br></br>  <br>How about now?</br>  <br> Just topdecking a free Neo Tachyon, Dark Knight, or Giant Red Hand <br>Man thank god for that you have to draw it part or this card would be fucking retarded</br></br>  <br>This picture is a best picture.</br>  <br>Yuya would be wearing a EGAO in these situations. You can see all their personalities in their faces. So why is Yuya Y[uke]ya?</br>  <br>I've heard something about it having new support in one of the new Legendary Yugi's Decks that will come out soon.</br>   Ultra and Secret <br>Jesus, what are you doing KoA?</br>  <br>Are you surprised?</br>  <br>Why are you still playing TCG? You almost deserve to pay those unholy price tags for pieces of cardboard.</br>  <br>So in other words the duel was scripted. Real nice deduction. Even though Crow was distracted they gave Gon garbage for a hand, Crow two set up turns and a really weak Synchro that was deliberately shit as possible so Crow wins. So no shit Crow won, what a skilled duelist.</br>  <br>It'll be like $8 at best if people actually decide to play the deck, which they won't.<br><br>The set already has enough holos that people don't want to pull.</br></br></br>  <br> The set already has enough holos that people don't want to pull. <br> posts the dracoknight synchro <br>Have you not looked at Majespecter Dracoknights or what.</br></br></br>  <br>Not much but Luster P seems like the more useful card, and Ignister will probably just go up in price closer to the TCG release of DOCS.<br><br>Probably should have posted Tell or something, but I just remember literally every OCG CORE box opening I saw getting one or two of Ignister.</br></br></br>  <br>This only really happened with Crow vs Gon and Sora vs Shun. Both weren't exactly unexpected reactions considering Sorafags and Crow haters.<br>That's two duels.</br></br>  <br><br>Except Gon's hand wasn't really weak. Infact his hand was better than most of his duels.<br><br>If he had summoned any of his other Synchro monsters he still would've lost</br></br></br></br>  Anyone got a Red Demon's deck?  <br>But Crow could have found an Action Card that inflicted 4000 damage to Gon. Gon had no chance of winning.</br>  I wonder what archetypes the Tops duelists are going to run.<br><br>They'd have to be overpowered anime-only archetypes to make Crow not look like a faggot for whining about Tops while playing fucking BLACKWINGS.</br></br>  <br>Nobody actually buys cards anymore, they just use DN or Pro. At least anybody intelligent.</br>  <br>Who is he getting married to?</br>  <br>Someone crude and strong.</br>  <br>It really was, wasted two cards on Magnets, then the crappy shitty Pendulums reduced it further then no Souls either though they're a fairly large part of Gon's deck. Then the Synchro which had a restriction just so Gon couldn't take advantage of the misplay. I would have laughed hard if Soul buster Gauntlet showed up. Or any Soul really.</br>  <br>Crow?</br>  <br>Literally the only card in Gon's entire deck that would have saved him was the Glove</br>  <br>Shingo is the DSP of cardgames, except Shingo is funny.</br>  <br>That's probably why he decided to use Flutist as a random LV3 instead of the better Glove. Also not giving Flutist it's proper effect so it was straight up bad. What I'm saying is that a random Kabuto play would be better since that only wastes one card. But it was blatantly scripted like it was said before so Gon would have lost anyway.</br>  <br>Sawatari isn't running around like this constantly.<br><br> WHY WONT MY TRAP PLAY, I ACTIVATED CALL OF THE HAUNTED, BUT I HAVE NO MONSTERS IN THE GRAVEYARD, WHY CANT I TAKE IT FROM YOURS, THIS IS STUPID <br> Draw Phase: WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO HERE, I DONT GET IT, THIS GAME ISN'T CLEAR ENOUGH <br><br>etc. you get the point, Sawatari is dumb, but he's not that dumb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My deck maybe Xyz, but she is my ace.</br>    <br>I wouldn't call Sawatari dumb, he's just overconfident.</br>  <br>Yes, but he does blame Yuya for his own stupidity.</br>  <br>Nekroz.</br>  <br>I like how everyone ignores that Gon's cards were scripted so badly. Usually when someone makes a misplay they get punished for it but nah Gon can't do anything because his Synchro has a specific restriction. Then there's the Pendulums with insulting effects. Then there's blatant Magnet garbage which is obvious Raikiri bait. Then there's Gon not taking the first turn because he botches bike riding even though Crow's apparently distracted and shouldn't have made it to the first corner first then.<br>As a Samurai player this episode was really disappointing.</br></br>  <br>He only blamed Yuya for things after their first duel. Since their 2nd, he thinks of Yuya as one of his 'Sawatari Generation' disciples in an affectionate way.</br>  <br>Well, he must've forgotten that when they entered the Synchro Dimension. Because, he is reason security learned about Action Duels, and Pendulum Summoning. If Crow hadn't came along, they would've been sent to the facility.</br>  <br>Look I agree that Gon deserved the win more but there's not much you can do about plot armor sadly. Gon's cards were deliberately terrible especially the Synchro but blame the duel writing for that not Crow.</br>    Don't worry guys we probably won't have to deal with Crow's shit after this arc right. Right guys. He's not going to become a permanent cast member is he?      <br>Not likely. If they're really going to bring someone from Synchro along (since they were looking for strong people to join them), maybe Shinji?</br>    <br>fuck you, its going to be ENJOY guy he's pretty cool.</br>  <br>Enjoy is gonna die man.</br>  <br>Why is this a thing? I didn't get the impression Yuri and Serena were close.</br>  <br>He's old and old guys rarely get to help save the world in shonen so it's sadly inevitable. He's much more likable than expected. Why can't we have him instead of the boring thing that is Crow? I mean when he gets carded I'm going to be sad, if Crow gets carded my reaction will be one of happiness.</br>  <br>We know next to diddly shit about Yuri at the moment, and the other three pairs are close, so there's going to be something involving them for sure. The question is is there already a bond there (that was suppressed somehow) or will it form after they meet?</br>  <br>Because BUY BLACKWINGS</br>  <br>I want to  hug  shota Yuri.</br>  <br>The flashback of him as a kid is going to break some hearts, I can tell. A kid becoming THAT fucked up in the future can't not be a sad story.</br>  <br>My guess is they were, or would've been close, but Leo showed up and kept Serena locked up in academia</br>  <br>it'll be badass if he takes on more than 2 assholes from the DA.</br>  <br>They showed a few episodes of Tokumatsu. He's already likable<br>They showed more of Crow and I still don't like him. I guess he's a good person for raising the kids but still he just isn't interesting and I don't care really.</br></br>  Anon-kun, are you ready for bed?  <br>Always.</br>  <br>Eh Sora vs Shun was a bigger outrage Probably because the show still had hype then. Crow winning caused anger but at least the thread was moving. Now it's near dead. Crow brutally murdered the hype. Though to be fair to him it was already massively declining.</br>    <br>It's good that the thread is slowing down, but it's far from dead. If you think this is dead, you should have seen earlier on in the show's run where we had threads lasting for upwards of two days.</br>  <br>WELL THAT ESCALATED QUICKLY</br>  <br>we already knew that Crow would win, even if we said Gon was going to deep down we all knew who'd win. the point reminds that Crow killed the fun anything crow touches with his manlet hands turns to shit.</br>  <br>Has anyone translated the names of Tag Force Special decks? The wiki doesn't have any</br>  <br>The english patch translates them if you want to try that.</br>  <br>Aporia's decks<br> The Current Despair <br> Just Despair <br> Inevitable Despair <br> The Hope Beyond Despair </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any interesting deck names?</br>  <br>Yeah this really. I had a tiny sliver of hope that Gon would win and something unpredictable would happen but no Crow won and it was just as meh as I thought it would be. It doesn't help that the new SHS Synchro that I was hyped for was really underpowered and blatantly designed so Crow would win.</br>  <br>It turns out Placido, like his namesake, is really into music<br> Wisel Overture <br> Wisel Prelude <br> Wisel Symphony <br> Wisel Armageddon <br><br> Wisel Concerto <br> Wisel Rhapsody <br> Wisel Divertimento <br> Wisel Requiem </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>eh, not terribly funny but Meiru's is Happy Blue Unfortune<br> It's Necloths. </br></br>   yfw Ruri's eye color is   Galaxy   <br>Tried looking up the names in some Japanese wiki and I'm laughing at Sora's decks:<br> The Way I Use Scissors <br> Scissors Mischief <br> Scissors Mischief (the meaning is a bit meaner) <br> Seriousness of Scissors <br>I miss you so much, Sora...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i just hope Crow doesnt become part of the main cast we all know whos going to be replaced pic related and it hurts me so.<br><br>even she is disgusted.</br></br></br>  <br>Haha, Sora sure likes his Scissors. Any more, gems? What are Sawatari's decks called?</br>  I I had to come up with Tag Force style decknames, here's what I'd call Shun's<br> Falcon's Revenge <br> Falcon's Resistance <br> Falcon's Rebellion <br> Falcon's Revolution </br></br></br></br>  <br>Or<br><br> Must find Ruri <br> Found a Ruri, but not Ruri <br> Found a Second Ruri, still not Ruri <br> Ruri~ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I Am the Chosen One <br> Ice Emperor (Sawatari would fit SO well at Hyoutei) <br> Moebius Empire <br> Yosenju Phantom <br><br><br>His deck names are<br> Falcon Hunting <br> Eagle Hunting <br> Hawk Hunting </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are Yuya and Yuzu's decks called?</br>  <br>Glove only works on direct attacks so it wouldn't save him from that last attack, and frankly, someone having a shitty hand makes for a more realistic duel.<br><br>So many duels would have different results if the characters played their best pieces right away.</br></br></br>  <br>this is pretty much it for Shun.</br>  <br> Let's Have Fun Together Deck <br> Entertainment Deck, First Act <br> Entertainment Deck, Second Act <br> Entertainment Deck, Encore <br><br> Super Melodious Live <br> Melodious' Etude <br> Divine Melody Melodious Polyphony <br> Melodious Superb Song Symphony </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How the fuck is it not likely. What the fuck do you think all that Kizunaing with Yuya is for?</br></br>  <br>Thank you based anon.<br>One last request, what are Reiji and Gon's decks called?</br></br>  <br> shitty hand makes for a more realistic duel. <br>Proper duels don't have plot armor cards to save you.<br>But yes I forgot that Glove only works on direct attacks. Ah well, guess there's nothing else he could use instead other than good old Soulbang Cannon for a draw or give Flutist the proper effect since it's one of the key cards used in real life. Besides the new cards Gon used were awful beyond belief. It would have been better if he never used Pendulums because he might get two Samurais that aren't shit. Bad duel was bad.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh cry some more. Gon has never been much of a wombo combo king in the anime. <br>You can't even think of a strategy how Gon would have won with your would be hand</br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that the butthurt fags are not true Gonfags, just some Crowhaters who pretend to be Gonfags<br>If Gon lost to Dennis, no one would have given a shit<br>If Gon lost to Shun, no one would have given a shit<br>If Gon lost to fucking Tsukikage no one would have given a shit<br>But God forbid Crow defeats someone</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right, I don't want Crow to win and I don't like Gon, Gons deck is cool at least though.</br>  <br>I'm not going to completely change his hand. Obviously he couldn't win with the cards he was given outside of Flutist's real effect. I'm faulting the writer for giving Gon trash cards in the first place. It's like  says. It's scripted. But his regular strategy of protecting a Samurai with Souls was gone. <br>But I'm done with this. Crow will lose eventually.</br></br>  <br><br>  It's scripted <br><br>Just stop. You just sound like an absolute retard who think that there are actual people playing card games in the anime. EVERY DUEL IS SCRIPTED</br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem isn't that Gon lost or that Crow is a faggot, it's how Gon lost. Duels are scripted yes, but it felt like Gon's cards and the duel itself was tailored made to make him lose, which usually is not the case, most of the time even with Jack/Yuya there is a clear case of their hands and cards putting up a fight or leading to a good duel. <br><br>In Gon's case there was nothing he could have done regardless of any strategy, and that's what was bad about the duel. Yuya could have beat Jack if he hadn't over-extended and Fused/Xyz'd right off the bat, Gon did not have this, his hand was tailored made to lose.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the point retard discussing potential plays is pointless other than to waste time. I'm not mad that Gon lost. I'm mad that he lost in an unsatsifying way.</br>  <br><br>Gon didn't need to play his magnets first and could've just blocked the first attack with the card he used anyway and used his magnets for synchro summons<br>He could have used one magnet to summon flutist in the first turn and synchro summon right off the bat and play more agressively. <br><br>But Gon always stall for his first turn. That's what he's done in every duel so far so I find it pretty funny that people are getting mad at it just now just because he played against Crow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reiji's are just called<br> D <br> DD <br> DDD <br><br>Gon-chan<br> Steadfast Duel, Legion Volume <br> Steadfast Duel, Introductory Manual <br> Steadfast Duel, Practical Assessment Volume <br> Steadfast Duel, Advanced Volume <br>(not 100% sure about "Legion", but Google isn't giving me anything else and I can't figure out if it's a reference to something specific)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This, Gon is a faggot that is gonna get himself and others carded because he refuses to do anything. <br><br>Hell he refused to fucking do anything against Jobelisk after seeing people get fucking carded, he just stalled and was like "Here Shun, you do it."</br></br></br>  <br>Not the anon you're replying to, but "all that Kizunaing"? Maybe it felt like there was a lot of Crow if you're watching weekly, but I recently caught up and binge watched the past ~20 episodes and it didn't seem like there was that much of focus on Crow.</br>  <br>Because other than Trumpeter which was just used as a Tuner with no effect and Flutist used as a random LV3 with no effect, everything else was new. So they gave Gon a bunch of really bad new cards tailor made so he could lose. That's probably where it's coming from. Though yes people hate Crow and it doesn't help the matter.</br>  <br><br>He used the magnets against Security. He did the exact same opening move. But nobody bitched there</br></br>  <br>Wait what. As soon as he saw "Yuzu" in danger he went to help. He gave Shun Pendulums because his deck is built for taking on multiple opponents at once. Easier than him playing something for sure. The writers are also massive Shunfags.</br>  <br><br>If Gon hadn't played anything people would cry how the writers make Gon play like a retard just to make Crow win<br>If Gon had Synchro summoned in the first turn and Crow blew up his monsters people would cry about how Gon should've saved it because it was obvious that it was gonna get blown up<br>If Gon uses a literally previously established opening move he used in duels before people are still gonna bitch BECAUSE FUCK CROW FUCK LOGIC REEEEE</br></br></br></br>  <br>And he'd lost there too and I'd have bitched, but big poppa Shun came to save the day.</br>  <br>The Magnets were ok. Even if they were only Raikiri bait and just put Gon down two cards. Everything else on the other hand especially the Synchro is trash.</br>  <br>This thread is filled with dishonor</br>  <br><br>That's even the worst thing. Gon didn't do anything at all. He was just there to get BTFO, demonstrate the Goyo effs and have Shun save his ass without putting up a fight or retaliating himself. It was just unnecessary and the sole purpose of this was to wank Shun's cock some more</br></br>  Crow a shit, Gon a shit. They should've drawn and both got sent off.  <br>what does happen if a draw occurres? Do they restart the duel with like 1000lp?</br>  <br>They probably just draw, and someone gets a free bye, or yeah, they'd just restart the duel.</br>  <br>Nobody other than Shun did anything there. It was plain Shun wanking.</br>  <br>Mitchio and Tepei sort of did something. Sawatari just got fucked from the start like all of his duels pretty much.<br><br>Serena is the only one with a real excuse though since their decks were tailored made to counter hers, just like Shun's is tailored made to counter any special summons.</br></br></br>  <br>So why don't people hate Shun again? He receives more favorism than Crow ever did. Is it muh Ruri?</br>  <br>I think because Shun is more of a joke half the time with his Ruri.wav. That and people actually tend to like his duels, Sora/Shun was one of the best duels YGO has had. <br><br>They do get pissy at him though too. I've seen quite a few people call him Crow 2.0 and BUY RAIDRAPTORS.</br></br></br>  <br>People started getting annoyed with him with the Shun vs Dennis match where he had a 3000 LP handicap just to shill him. then in the Secruity match where the preview talked about his overwhelming strength and nobody did much except provide fodders for him.<br>If the Shunfaggotry continues then more people are either going to like it because Shun is so cool or start disliking Shun.</br></br>  <br>MFW I dueled my brother.</br>  Holy shit are you faggots still bitching about Gon losing? Everyone not named Yuya is gonna fucking lose.  <br>And Shun, and Serena, and Reiji, and Reira, and  Jack </br>  <br>Who are those people above Futoshi and Yuya?</br>  Is Jack the Synchro Shun?  <br>Above futsoshi looks like Idol-chan</br>  <br>Shun is the Xyz Jack, and Reiji is the Standard Jack, now we just need Fusion Jack.</br>  So I decided to watch 5Ds and cant inderstand why you fags hate everything after episode 64, I mean they have a fucking riding duel IN SPACE and the loser gets killed by a black hole. What the fuck  <br>Because some plot points were dropped after the sex cult thing, and some characters were shoved to the side for no reason or just completely shit on, like Sherry.</br>  <br>If this is true, then that would make Rin Jack's sister.</br>  <br>Jack is a traitor for a reason, he left his poor little sister behind in the commons, but Yugo doesn't understand and just sees him as the cool older brother that became Kingu.</br>  <br>I didn't mind it except for the stupid amount of filler and how Z-ONE was actually a Yusei cosplayer.</br>  <br> Fusion Jack <br>That sounds like a Trap Card.</br></br>  <br>Does it now? I don't have King in my name for nothing.</br>  <br>Shun will be protected because the writers suck him off hard. The tourney will be interrupted before he loses.<br>Serena is going to get captured and become irrelevant so who cares if she loses or wins.<br>Reira may have infant immortality.<br>Reiji probably won't even duel this arc until the end and won't lose until he faces his father.<br>Jack will probably job to Synchro using Yuya.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Serena is going to get captured and become irrelevant so who cares if she loses or wins. <br><br>I care.</br></br></br>  <br> Serena is going to get captured and become irrelevant so who cares if she loses or wins. <br>It's sad because it's true.</br></br>  <br> he left his poor little sister behind in the commons <br><br>Disgusting. Jack deserves to get carded for abandoning his imouto.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Don't worry Snack Butler to the rescue.</br></br></br>  <br>It's sad all Ruris will get to be damsels in distress eventually.</br>  <br> tfw used to like Sawatari but hate him now <br>When is he gonna get Manjoume'd</br></br>  <br>but nobody mistook Shun for Jack, Yuya and Yuzu are probably the only ones with counterparts</br>  <br>Whats wrong with his face?</br>  <br>Fusions</br>  <br>To be fair he couldn't duel Steadfast on a motorcycle which might explain his bad cards. He drew less forcefully so got rewarded with worse cards.</br>  <br> bringing dishonor to the Gongenzaka family name </br>  <br>Does everyone in the dojo also use Superheavy Samurais? Because otherwise them only playing monsters is dumb</br>  They're gonna fuck in a few episodes, aren't they?  <br>She has a crush on him in both the game and the manga, so I'd like to believe the anime would follow suit.<br><br>Also,<br> letting a guy touch your tits while armlocking him <br>Is this how slavs show their affection?</br></br></br></br></br>  MC's design in the anime is shit.  <br>I like his eyebrows.</br>  <br>At least he's doesn't look like a blond gay faggot.</br>  <br> Is this how slavs show their affection? <br>Only if you're a fifteen year old slav.</br></br>  <br>Why is yuu such a faggots?</br>   I... want to save everyone! <br>I like this MC.

HMAS Vampire would also be cute if she come with the whole blonde loli vampire theme with her.<br>Don't know about VMF, maybe someone who served alongside Bep during her time in Pacific fleet.</br></br>    <br>Blame Refrain</br>    <br>Yeah, Enterprise is waifu killer and only shitter likes her</br>  <br> no HMS Gay Viking <br>Stalker pls</br></br>  <br>Not before Japanese coastal ships, I need those super loli ships.</br>  <br> Enterprise is waifu killer <br>Maybe if your waifu wasn't shit, she'd be alive.</br></br>  Kaga is mou kuso  <br>It's not her fault but Commander in Chief of the combined fleet.</br>  Would Lexington CV-2 be a delicious Christmas cake ?  <br>I searched in Google and Yandex, no results.<br>Source?</br></br>  <br>It's moe sugoi, anon.</br>  <br>No Yadokari is going to draw her and she's going to be a loli. <br><br> i-074 </br></br></br>    where you been son  <br> That self deprecation <br><br>Urge to friend, rising.</br></br></br>  last chapter was 100x more interesting  <br>How are all the girls so best? I came for the tomboy and I stayed for everything.</br>  Jun getting Tomboy stolen by marshmallow when  is there a term for ntr, only with best friends instead of sex, because i think that might happen to misuzu  <br>FrieNTR?</br>  <br>It's not NTR unless it is cheating. Stop forcing it on everything you see you damnable idiots.</br>  <br>Why does everyone use it anyway? NTR is a hentai-only fetish. No use screaming it every time a love-triangle or something appears.</br>  <br>Because most of 4chan's population can only communicate in memes.</br>  <br>I chuckled a bit at the last panel because she has small boobs.</br>   she isn't an idiot nip <br>based</br>  <br>The innocence bit is just so she can nab her fuccboi and secure his seed.</br>  <br>I prefer it to  cuck  anyway.</br>  <br><br>Man I'd do the same if I was a pretty girl. Nab myself some strong androgynous boy for som /ss/</br></br>  <br>All this Misuzu really makes me wonder how, if ever, is she and this guy is supposed to get together.<br><br>What will she see in him, I wonder. That is a bigger and more ridiculous mystery than "Why can't Jun accept Tomo's into him"</br></br></br>  <br>He's a really nice guy and that's all she wants, someone who likes her for who she is.<br><br>Plus, he's easy to mess with.</br></br></br>  <br>He wouldn't push her into the rain though.</br>  <br>It's more fun to train them.<br><br>He'll be strangling her with an extension cord in three months tops.</br></br></br>  <br>Let´s hope she doesn´t create a male yandere.<br> Would be kinda interesting to see though. </br></br>  <br>Perhaps that is a way to spice up her life and annihilate her icy mask.</br>  <br>Tomo chan a best</br>  <br>But Misuzu a better?</br>  <br>As long as he doesn´t turn out like pic related i´m fine. She prolly just needs a guy who won´t betray her and maybe some phsical contact  especially some lewd ones .  </br>  <br> ntr </br>    <br>she's a good girl but still among the worst tbh</br>  <br>He likes Misuzu's 'devilish' attitude, so while he's easy to mess with, he doesn't seem like he'll retaliate the same way Jun did.<br><br>no idea if that's a good or bad thing</br></br></br>  <br>shitty taste near-satan chan</br>  <br>Definitely good for the romance, I would say.<br> Misuzu with regular banter <br> realizes he's one of the only boys who actively take interest in her. <br> AND he has proven he likes to deal with her shit <br>How could they not get together? And i'm pretty sure it's hinted at on the cover art.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the hate sex is gonna be incredible</br>  <br>bitch had it coming</br>  <br>The pushing into the rain makes her wet on the outside, and the bullying makes her wet inside.<br><br>This guy provides that small cherry on top.</br></br></br>  <br> provides <br>He'll be taking her small cherry away tbh.</br></br>  <br>is it just me, or have we not seen this guy in ages?<br>He's starting to feel like an afterthought.</br></br>  <br><br>The guy is in denial so hard.</br></br>  <br>He is the classic Sunohara-type character, a perverted 'best friend' of MC.<br><br>He will always be tertiary.</br></br></br>  <br> That level of smug <br>I hope she lost her scrunchie.</br></br>  <br>Love Tomboys.<br>Would date a tomboy.<br>Would marry a tomboy.<br>Would impregnant a tomboy and accept responsibility.<br>Tomboys are simply all around impeccable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would kill to push her into the rain.</br>    <br><br>COTTON CANDY A CUTE<br><br>A CUTE</br></br></br></br>    Do you enjoy watching anime about little girls crying? What's wrong with you?   ending could have been the perfect chance to have her smile for more than half a frame <br>Ya blew it NNB.</br>  <br><br>The episode was great, you blew it.</br></br>  <br>I just want to see her smile.</br>    <br>wtf am i looking at?</br>  <br>Yes, Uchuu no Stellvia is my favorite series.</br>  <br><br> wtf </br></br>  Best episode yet  This show is so fucking slow and boring, even for a slice of life. I have no idea how people enjoy watching it.  <br>turn off your brain</br>    Ren-chon is losing all her friends.  <br>Is this symbolic for the small vietnamese boy she accidentally shot?</br>  <br>The simplicity is the beauty<br>Also looking at the recent trend of anime, you won't get this type of series very frequently.<br>No, it's different from KinMosa or Gochumon etc.<br>This series is just special in it's own way.<br>It reminds us a bit of the long gone glorious Yotsuba.</br></br></br></br></br>   [Vivid] Non Non Biyori Repeat - 04 [599F6F1C].mkv <br>May may subs are out.</br>  <br>It reminds me of my spring of youth when everything was simple and fun things were fun.</br>   want to read the manga <br> mfw trying to read the Kami translations </br>  <br>Watching NNB makes me sad that children these days are fucked. They're not allowed to be kids, they're covered in bubble wrap until they go to college where they make safe rooms for all the anxiety problems they get from being denied a childhood.</br>  WAKE ME UP INSIDE  I never asked for this.  <br>No, it's symbolic for all the villagers she and her unit massacred and the children she orphaned.</br>  Were NNB threads always shit? I remember the first season threads being a lot more fun.  I wish I had a house like this, it looks super comfy.    Kaede. ;_;<br><br>Also, what the fuck is it with country towns and lolly stores? Went to a town for some scones and there was store solely dedicated to lollies in a &lt;1000 town. <br><br>How does the business structure remain profitable?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Were NNB threads always shit? <br>Yes.</br></br>    <br>This one is not even so bad yet.</br>  <br>Stock doesn't go off, doesn't need many staff, small town land rates are probably pretty good for this type of thing. I don't know all the ins and outs of business but I can see why there'd be one in every country town.</br>  <br>Faggots have ruined them with their shitty Vietnam meme.</br>  <br>Why Komari is flying like Chiyo-chan?</br>   Pool episode <br><br>Hotaru's D-cups return!</br></br>  Best episode yet due to best girl candy store, even if it was for just a second.  Your face when?  <br><br>It's mostly rampant lolicons with their forced sexualization especially of Ren-chon.</br></br>      <br> The sunshine crying <br><br>Too much, anon.</br></br></br>  <br> empty room 101 <br>Take it back. Bring them back. <br>Why aren't you bringing them back? <br> Why? </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> empty room 101 <br>Is that some reference or something?</br></br></br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>Well neither me nor goolge understood it.</br>  <br>Then maybe you should watch the sunshine.</br>    <br>I'll return to it if there is no good sol next season.</br>  <br>Tell me about Nee-nee, why does she wear the masks?</br>  <br>So far the second season is pretty shit compared to the first, which makes for shittier threads.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  <br>Cut it out.</br>  Why is Hotaru so shit? She ruined the whole episode.  What the hell?      <br>I want to kirie umaru's ebinas</br>  Is this really necessary  <br> yes </br>  <br> Only 6 Umaru threads <br>Looks like the meme is dying</br></br>  <br>She loves her onii-chan.</br>  <br> 1x i want to X Y thread <br> 1x new whining thread <br> 1x old whining thread that got hijacked </br></br></br>  <br>Yes, good to be back in the times where people ignore circlejerks and just post whatever they want</br>  <br><br>WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> &gt;&gt; <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this meant to be gross or off putting? It's funny, it looks like it's a still from the actual show</br>  <br>Stay mad at AOTY nigger.</br>  <br>There he is. There he goes again. Look, everyone! He posted it once again! Isn't he just the funniest guy around?! Oh my God.<br><br><br>I can almost see your pathetic overweight frame glowing in the dark, lit by your computer screen which is the only source of light in your room, giggling like a little girl as you once again type your little Umaru thread up and fill in the captcha. Or maybe you don't even fill in the captcha. Maybe you're such a disgusting NEET that you actually paid for a 4chan pass, so you just choose the picture. Oh, and we all know the picture. The "epic" masked man, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your MORNING COLA on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about an chibi imouto anime. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic meme-posting NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING?" You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are. A sad little man laughing in the dark by himself as he prepares to indulge in the same old dance that he's done a million times now. And that's all you'll ever be.</br></br></br></br>  <br> cola <br> this lazy of an edit </br></br>    <br> spending 10 minutes to make this <br>That's some fucking dedication.</br></br>  <br><br>dafuk is this shit?</br></br>  <br>I missed you, WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT THING-kun</br>  How does she puberty?
