[ A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.  How are people supposed to see anime as art when KyoAni keeps making stuff like this?  I love Gotou.   That crushing feeling when you can't get good, no matter how hard you try.    Have you been working on those lip slurs anon?   SO UGLY.   EVEN Hazuki and Natsuki was amazed at how shit Kumiko was playing, and they didn't even make the cut.   Why don't they just fuck already?   Maybe they don't know how.   I just can't take this character seriously. I want to laugh whenever I see her dumb face on the screen. She's just so adorably autistic.     2special4u?   shh, Kumiko is sleeping   I want to put her in a room filled with LEGO bricks and watch her play with them all day long.    Because in Japan girls are gay in High School up until they find the D that they want then they endlessly pursue that D. If they fail they're doomed to Christmas Cake status.  Girls aren't allowed to switch D pursuit unless the new D is above and beyond all expectations in the ultimate shape of masculinity.  You now understand why Harems are such fierce competitions.        Why must you respond to shitposters?     girls only allowed to change Ds if new D is greater   thus harems are competitive  Surely it can't be that hard to find something superior to the faggots who typically find themselves leading harems?       Robert fripp did it, you can do it too.    I want to drink her blood.   You would think that, however density also starts with D and dense D also sounds like density which means the harem lead is the ultimate D.  Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.      What are you talking about, anon? Just look at her.    I want to fuck her sister.   Like pie in the sky    I want to fuck all the Hibikes at the same time.  How would socially awkward attempt to court Taki?   peace-chan has a name    I sort of miss those days. Things were so much simpler then.     That's basically the main reason why I want season 2. I want to see her try to act flirty around him.     Invite him on a quick trumpet walk up Mt. Fuji  iykwim .    She should go after him with a bottle of water offering it to him because it's hot. Taki thanks her and Reina dies.    I-I don't anon.   I don't know. I think she would just try to talk to him a little while and then tell him that she loves him if he's enjoying the conversation or smiles.  That or  she would mount him and demand that she start touching him, even though she would probably grab one of his hands and put it on her breast.           The same way how Kumiko approached Taki-sensei this episode. Leave her cellphone intentionally, they go to the room where she left it and then she rapes him there.      H-here, drink this sensei   Oh? You're giving me water?   It's because you look h-hot.  She then leaves blushing furiously and amazed at herself for being so bold.       So that's why Reina wanted Kumiko to tell her what happened.  Sasuga Reina.     Do you think Reina runs a blog or since she's so super special and different from all the other girls her age she has a traditional, physical diary where she writes about her interactions with Taki-Sensei?     I did it Kumiko, I told Taki I thought he looked hot      She would drug his drink, wait for it to kick in and rape him. A few months layer Reina sends him a positive pregnancy test result and attached to it is picture of her grinding his dick.     Reina shitposts about her crush on /r9k/    get on my level bitch.      Reina?  More like REEEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?      Reina is a pussy that pretends to be hardcore around other people. She would probably faint if Taki-Sensei even touched her.      She's also an M, I don't see her raping anyone.    She's M and S.  She reminds me of me.      Holly fuck a 'proper' nosebleed sacre bleu!     Kousaka-san, you'll be playing the solo. Not Nakaseko-san. You'll play. Got it?   Y-YOU TOO!      She's probably only an M because she found Taki's laptop open one day, and learned, among other things, that Taki hasn't mastered private browsing.      Now its time to disscuss medecine.what was the cause of Kumiko's nosebleed? Stress? Dry air? Obscure disease?       What does Taki does on his computer? Jacking off to professional orchestra music?     He watches that one amateur porn video he made with his wife over and over again. Then cries at the end.     It was not dry air. Kyoto is like the fucking Amazon in summer.    We went over this. The only causes for nosebleeds in anime are punches to the face or indecent thoughts. And I'm pretty sure Kumiko wasn't punched off-screen.      Implying they had time to do that  Taki married and his wife died like the week after what a fucking loser      Dehydration      10 orchestra hacks that will change your life   What this 10 year old trumpet prodigy does next will blow your mind   Depression help       Yuuko plz   Well whadda you know.  Screens are up, fuckers.     It's Key AIDS. Kumiko will be hospitalized right before the competition and Reina will completely fuck up her solo because she's worried about Kumiko. Reina will become a pariah, reviled by the band while looked on by Taki with only a gaze of deep disappointment while Kumiko becomes sicker and sicker. Kumiko will eventually die and Reina will try to throw herself off the school roof before being stopped by  Shuichi  who will  confess his love to her.    why the fuck did I write this       This shits going around.    Like seriously.    Holy shit the ponytail is back.    Ponytails everywhere.    Ponytail is back. Nice.    3 ADs  It's over KyoAni is finished.    JUSTICE    Kumiko must be sweating in that uniform she hates summer after all.      ponytails are back      last episode not called "Hibike! Euphonium"  I'm ready for you, second season.    Didn't Tamako's last episode have even more ADs?   Leave it to Kyoani to have us waiting until the end. The promo image didn't lie, Kumiko has the hairband around her wrist.   Nope, only one.    BUCHOU!    Look at her fucking uniform!  these illustrations will most likely become drama cds, as it happened with free!      Are the winter uniforms their performance uniforms? Only the slackers seem to be wearing their summer get up.       Ponytails vs. Ribbons: which is better?        !       Is it not possible that this scene is before or after their performance?    I think its for the more formal look.  コンクールの舞台で演奏できる時間は“たった”12分間。 それは一瞬のようで、でも永遠のようで……。 吹奏楽部員たちはその12分のために青春のすべてをかけて練習してきた。 北宇治高校吹奏楽部の演奏が始まる。         I'm pretty sure there have been some relatively recent KyoAni episodes with a couple of ADs, I just can't remember which shows did it. Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  It's pretty funny just how little staff is required per episode in KyoAni shows compared to other productions.     Are they really going to focus on music?  Hold old is Taki anyway?   Dehydration, which is why she was given water.    Ponytail is back, fick ja!          Taki in formal attire  How wet will Reina be?     Taki is 34. You should know this by now, Anonymous.     return of the ponytail   return of the winter uniform  It's the obligatory fan service episode.      There have been rare eps with two ADs but three is quite unusual for Kyoani.    I'll ask my friend. I'm pretty sure he can see the future.    Wiki says 34, although it varied from 32-34 before. I'd like novelanons to confirm ;-;    Brilliant.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]       Asuka ponytail  I still have mixed feelings about her but now I'm definitely aroused.      the description of the scene is that they fell asleep during practice. And the entire page is dedicated to the duet episode. It's probably one of those "it happened but we didn't show it" artworks. Kumiko has the hairband because she always puts up her hair for concerts, and they were practicing in the concert hall.       Well, it is the closing of three consecutive productions for KyoAni. With this many ADs on board here's hoping for a really well-animated performance. It would be great to have back-to-back episodes with cool animation highlights.     1434178590484.jpg  I really love the uniform designs in this show. The color palettes are very cute. I also like the little number in the back. Nice touch.     Who is she again?    Episode 13 "Goodbye, Competition" The amount of time to play in the concert is just twelve minutes. It seems like it will be over in an instant, but it seems like it will last an eternity... For the sake of those twelve minutes, the concert band members have stakes the springtime of their youth. Kitauji High School Concert Band's performance begins now.       I-I fucking love taki.    We know Riko, we know.    None of that says it can't be an actual scene. Do you not want it to be an actual scene?   Who are the staff for the last episode?   Reina please contain yourself    Go back to your trumpet solo.     Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  3 animators teams. 1 from Do, 2 from KyoAni. They might reach 20 KAs this time.  Too bad, their best animators already worked on episode 10-12 so they probably won't be in the finale.          start the show with ponytails   end the show with ponytails   There must be some deep symbolism in this, I can't figure it out though.       Who are KyoAni's best animators these days? Is Kigami still relevant as a key animator?    they had like 9 KA on the last episode, do they even need 20?   There's lots of instruments and tiny details this episode.   They sure do if they're going all-out on depicting the performance.    of course he's still relevant, he did episodes 5 and 11    But no tiny hats.     Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.   I chuckled a bit, but it's true best boys can be found in the sausagefest that are baseball mangas.      5 and 12*    Direction: Kawanami  SB: Yamada AD: Sezaki, Akitake, Hikiyama      Huh, no Ishidate. He's normally the finale guy.    Their best or most experienced that aren't AD or ED - Tatsuya Satou - Shinpei Sawa - Hiroshi Karata - Kunihiro Hane - Yoshinori Urata - Mariko Takahashi - Kouhei Nakahara Kigami actually worked solely on key animation for like a year before Hibike.            Do we know which staff members haven't been very active lately? IIRC Ogawa and Utsumi have been pretty quiet so maybe they are doing some new project.     normally  Outside of his own show and Chuu2? Not really.     he's 34, although I forgot where they mention his age     although I forgot where they mention his age  Pretty much when he first appears.     there's no way Utsumi isn't doing animation for the Free movie. She's just directing anything for it.    just not*   Even Natsuki was embarrassed.   Holy shit, Kumiko sucked.    BD/DVD vol.2&amp;vol.3 also added event ticket.  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/650<wbr>45</wbr>     Its over. KyoAni on bankruptcy watch.      3 event tickets  We jew now     She's not in a position to judge.  She didn't even make the audition.       I think the both of you may be misinterpreting that scene.     I hope she's working under Takemoto's supervision. Her talent shines through the most when she's led by someone else. Same with Ishidate.    more like time to announce a s2    Do they have enough event tickets?    better add more tickets just in case    tfw Aoi won't be at the concert   Yes. That position, yes.    ■感謝イベント　京都でお祭りフェスティバル ～南座へようこそ～ 概要    日程：2015年10月31日(土)   時間：17:00開場／17:30開演   会場：京都四條 南座 (京都市東山区四条大橋東詰)   The same day as KyoAniDo event. It's in Kyoto too.            tfw I don't give two fucks about a random non-character with a subpar design      same day as KyoAniDo event  Isn't that counterproductive?    live action  Is the next episode the last?   There's an OVA in December.     Beach episode confirmed     Too many guys    So we don't end with them playing in the competition?    What? Sauce?    7 volumes, 2 episodes each. That means episode 13 + OVA is in the last volume.    http://anime-eupho.com/product/  続巻発売日情報   第4巻：2015年9月16日（水）  第5巻：2015年10月21日（水）  第6巻：2015年11月18日（水）  第7巻：2015年12月16日（水）  Volume 7 of BDs goes on sale on December 16th. Every BD volume contains two episodes and a short special. Anime TV series only has 13 episodes.  It's the same thing that happened with Amagi Brilliant Park. TV series had 13 episodes, OVA came out with the seventh BD volume.                They announce S2 on Tuesday, right?  I want to fuck Kumiko, hard.   Taki tapped that right?    KyoAni has been consistently doing this format for their TV shows since Chuu2Ren.       Asuka stoic as fuck whilst everyone else is has varying degrees of damn when Kumiko got told.   Now that I think about it, they didn't focus on Shuu's reaction, did they.    Right, because she can't feel empathy.      That reminds me of Haruhi.    god, are japanese ugly without photoshop and centimeters of make up  Centuries of imbreeding do that to you. Almost as bad as English.       That little river play was cute, a push for each other to get good.   Get good, Kumiko.    Must be a communist.        <br/>    Asuka reads it for the first time and plays it flawlessly. Kumiko, who has been playing euphonium for seven years, struggles even after practicing for an entire week.       If you look at the music for the piece she played for her middle school competition, it's not that hard in comparison. The degree of difficulty is just this much higher than what she's used to.  Asuka's just special.    Will Shoe1 win the Kumikobowl?     Maybe on the new AniDO project? They have something to announce next month.     Why do most japanese in highschool look ugly? Is it because of inbreeding?     If they make two more seasons, or a two cour second season, then yes. If they end it with this season, nope. It's an adaptation of a novel, and in the novel he only wins the k-bowl at the end of the third volume.      He's already out of the running.    He's the only one in the running. It might take him a year but he'll get to the finish line eventually.      He's the only one in the running.  That's what you think.     Piss off Kumiko     tfw you will never go to a Hibike event     WAKE UP BITCH    Please don't suck so much donkey dick and PUT THE FUCKING BLANKETS.    Would be weird if AniDo announced the new show and not Kyoani. Even Free's announcement was all under Kyoani's name.     Not Kigami Not Ishidate  3 ADs....  I can't say they're cutting corners but I'm kinda disappointed.             Violin-chan is a cutie.      Is Aoi daijobu?  I hope she gets into a uni and STEM subject of her choice.     I never understood the obsession to study for college during your final high school year.    That's the feeling that indicates that you're not trying hard enough.    Entrance exams. You can't go to college if you don't pass them.    Are entrance exams in japan really that hard? To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd.   Why isn't Reina in any special classes? Is that normal in Japan? Here in America, autistic children have their owns classes. And when they take standard classes with normal students, they have a chaperon with them at all times.  You will never date Reina and then go out with other girls to make her jealous. ;_;   It's the only way to get into university, and the choices of universities you can get into is determined by your score.   It can also mean the difference between a life long white collar job or whatnot.        It depends on the college you want to get into but yes, students are very stressed out during this time because their future depends on it. In Japan it's hard to get in to college but easy to graduate, but in America it's relatively easy to get into college but more difficult to graduate.    It's better to make them socialize with normal people instead of treating them like special snowflakes or giving them Ritalin like in ameriland.    They are the most important exams you will take in your educational career as the university you go to will depend on your results, and that has more influence on your future job prospects than how you actually get on at university.    They are announcing something next month and many people are not working on anything for a long time. It makes sense for them to start acting independently.     To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd  It's not odd at all in an Asian country. An entire year is nothing when everyone else starts preparing for the exam since their first year of highschool.      I have faith in the Yamada. Hopefully they don't dissapoint with the finale like they did on Ep 11.       inb4 it's just another seasonal staff illustration thing        It just seems kind of odd to base what university you go to on one exam, rather than your overall academic performance.    I think they'll give a solid hint that Kumiko likes Shuichi otherwise they would never should have bothered with the whole Kumiko doesnt know about her feelings sub-plot.  What's Kumiko feeling here?  Abject despair that she'll never reach Reina's skill level?       I can only assume she is aiming for a very hard or unusual career or something, otherwise sperging out just because you want to get into liberal arts, marketing or nursery would be kind of stupid, any diploma from any college could pretty much do the job. I used to think that without a degree from a top tier university you'd be pretty much unemployed for life but it isn't really that important for most 'normal' jobs.      The kind of university you graduate from matters more in Japan. People and employers might look down on you if you're from a third-rate school. Even in the dating world they look at where you graduated from as a way of picking a mate. Probably because better school = better job = payed better = security.   In Aoi's case she'd already failed to get into the high school she wanted so she's already stressed out about veering off the path she wanted. I don't know if it will ever be mentioned what career she's going for but it must be something she really wants.      Do lacks a digital department, they can't be independent.      That doesn't matter, Do can't be independent because they're not a separate entity, they're a subsidiary owned entirely by KyoAni. Pretty much a KyoAni studio in Osaka with a fancy name.     Where is that pic of red rinnon blowing the paper? She has the guts to be in a position of authority.   red ribbon*    What the fuck is wrong with the Japanese male hair styles.    They have shit hair genetics that don't really allow them to have more than 3 styles.    I don't think it's going to be anything too overt. Maybe hints of them reconciling, but no strong romantic hints. Romance hasn't really been an important part of this show, so to make a big revelation of Kumiko realizing her love for Shuichi would feel out of place.  But I also don't think we're going to get any pathetic, cheap yuribait like episode 11 scene either. Yamada is doing the storyboard for this episode, and based on her previous work I doubt she'd stoop that low.     I finally understand the context of this picture.  Reina is murdering Kumiko.     Someone needs to shop Ufo-kun and a shadow of Reina with a knife.     No, I expect a solid one. They've been lacking really because they had to go crazy with the yuri bait.     Where is that image even from? Is it just fan art or an official one?     I finally understand  No anon, you don't.     That teacher hhhnnng    It was one of the very first pieces of official art, and its purpuse obviously was to bait otaku into that nifty new Kyoani show since that artwork looks like POV shot of somebody about to rape Kumiko. If there's one thing all otaku love, it's fat faceless men raping virginal highschool girls.    You're right. They should stop making art so people can see anime as art.    Her ankles though    The Euphonium player is kinda cute.     most highschoolers are ugly  Holy shit anon you are onto something.      anime with so little confidence in its story it has to resort to school girls almost humping each other for the viewers' titillation   art      Can't blame them after hearing best girl Asuka play that part. Asuka raised the bar too high for Kumiko.    The concert scene is one thing they could animate in advance, you know?    I'm still mad about this.  Hibike! Euphonium could have been Kyoani's magnum opus, the first work since Hyouka to surpass it.  But they had to completely shit on it and ruin it just because that faggot Hanada can't go five minutes without an obnoxious yuribait fanservice scene.        Anime is a mistake.     virginal  I don't wanna know how often her cactus was slimy.      mfw he's working with Kyoani again for their next show     When will Kyoani fire that faggot already? All of the Kyoani shows he wrote the script for flopped.     mfw     You're overreacting     He's right. People focus more on the shipfaggotry rather than the story.      Maybe on this shitty board.     I don't go to under anime related websites, but I was under the impression that shipfaggotry is even more insufferable on most of them, and that the conversations almost exclusively revolve around it. Is that not the case?    This shit is everywhere, the only thing that differs is the tone of the debate.   You can travel back in time to the day before the first episode aired.  What would you tell yourself about the show?      Stop kidding yourself. It's every discussion forum.     Cheer for Natsuki and Haruka, it would be a good investment. Avoid Asuka.     It'll never get S2.     Even though I know it won't happen, I'd probably have more respect for the show if it actually went all the way and made Kumiko/Reina canon in the end. At least then there'd be a point to all the yuribaiting.    Avoid all threads on /a/ (or anywhere else for that matter) after episode 8 like the plague.    What does that have to do with the quality of the actual show?  I'm not sure what you would like the Kumiko x Reina scenes to be replaced with either. I know we would all like more music, but without the Kumiko x Reina scenes where would Kumiko's character development come from? Shuuichi?      Not him but the blatant yuribait scenes did feel really out of place in the show and since it'll lead nowhere it was simply pointless to add it in the first place.    Horiguchi is nowhere to be seen    Horiguchi left Kyoani.    If Reina is supposed to be awkward around people then have her be awkward not price charming. Less yuribait more freindship that actually help Kumiko and Reina develop.    Yeah, same. I don't have a problem with the yuri part, I have a problem with the bait part. If they decided to make a yuri romance, fair enough, that also could have made it a great show. But this bait is just pathetic.   Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem. It's like watching two completely different shows when you compare those scenes to all the other scenes. They could have portrayed their relationship as an intense, emotional relationship without resorting to trying to make them look as gay as possible.        since it'll lead nowhere  Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  Who cares about where they'll "lead. It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.       She took a break from animating and illustrates full-time now.     It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.  And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers, which is cheap and irritating when everyone knows they're both supposed to be straight.    I found this:  http://www.kaga-create.co.jp/saki/i<wbr>ndex.html</wbr>    lots of the character pix being posted on the live futaba thread   This is another Shinohayu leak.   That's from months ago.   When was the last time you got a chombo?   That is disgraceful     Eh Gokumi is still jew enough to only provide still picture instead of real animation for the Vita game.   Cashgrab.        waiting almost 3 months for the game to be released    Posting this every thread until the vita game trailer is released. Please look forward to it   I just started watching this. It's fun but don't understand what's going on when they are playing   I really hope there's another Saki Live. I would fucking book a trip to japan just to see it. I'd probably cry from hearing all that amazing music live.     That entire fucking website   Did an intern design this shit?  Also   Now you can play mahjong even after being condemned to the beach!          Please get hyped for the loading screens. Does anyone have rips of the loading screens from the other 2 games?    Sounds about right, actually. Most people start off watching for the cute girls, and get interested in mahjong later.   I don't think a manga has ever quite made my blood boil with excitement quite like Saki does.   Since then, many of us are stuck    Why is this so mesmerizing to watch?     /sp/-lite, chinktile edition.     L E G E N D E G E N D          Since when did mahjong become a sport?     The game's coming out in 3 months. It might get released without a trailer ever even being produced.    Since people toki'd while playing it.    I made a commitment and I intend to stick to it no matter what.   Remember Tohai? Episode two has been subbed.  www.viki.com/videos/1063663v-tohai-<wbr>i-episode-2</wbr>     I feel like Ritz really likes using the "fire in front of the eye" thing to indicate that a character is scary.    I hope someone will translate the new Akagi live action.   Damn that Washizu really looks like that guy from Umineko, while Akagi didn't looked as badass as I hope.      Since Achiga turned t/a/noshii threads into a microcosm of /sp/.  The legendary shitstorms of the last 5 chapters of Achiga-hen or so would make /sp/ proud.       6 school   I hope they increase the amount of school      There's gonna be DLC so perhaps we'll get Usuzan and Rinkai later. I will pay top dollar to play as Shiratodai again.     Kind of disappointing that they didn't include the other schools.    Yesterday i accidentally declared ron on my grandpa without a yaku     What is this? Computer mahjong that doesn't make chombo impossible? Not sure if epic fail or epic win.      Because you're self-inserting as the monkey and living the dream.     I want to fuck Kuro     School section   Every girl has cute cut-in except for Saki   Anon I'm scared      did shitrue get destroyed by Grandmaster yet?   Why is there no link on Osamuko? Someone else translated it?    That's still a half a year to a year off, at the pace Shinohayu is at.    Actually, scratch that, it's closer to two years or so.   If they show a middle school tournament, we'll see Grandmaster around 2020.   And if you add those 20s together, you get her age as well!           lightning under you      We are Toki        But Onee-chan...     Kikes &gt; dykes   Cakes = Best of All.  http://zudo-n.blogspot.de/2015/06/2<wbr>2.html  slackers out  so fourth round of the best 8 next.    </wbr>   hmm, here you can see more of the played hands. http://blog.goo.ne.jp/katsu666/e/2a<wbr>eedd138a65ca979a7314f89a9039dd</wbr>     does it mean what I think that it means?  August can't come soon enough.  http://blog.goo.ne.jp/katsu666/e/a0<wbr>69cfc92f53d9103f3e2560ec012ec3</wbr>        I don't get it.    The same guy translated it, he probably just forgot to post about it.      Shino lost or the best 2 pass the round?    Is the one on the left the girl that wanted the others to kneel down in front of her?   Just started watching the Saki anime, if it's good I will read the manga afterwards. So far I'm not really that impressed, though. In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules. But I'll give it some time, maybe these are just some starting problems.     Does a chombo round get repeated like when the dealer wins or it's a draw with dealer tenpai? Because if it isnt couldn't you use a deliberate chombo to win the game in the last round if you're more than 10 or 12k ahead and will still have 30k+ afterwards?       Best 2 advance, so the number of players is halved from this round onward: from 16 to 8 (next round) to the final 4.   Ritz chapter / short series will start in August.        In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules.  Which one?      In the second episode there was already a plot hole/false explanation of rules.   Like what? Absurd fluctuations in probability and magic I ain't gotta explain shit moments aside, the anime is pretty accurate to the rules of the game.  Do note that they do insert some house rules some times.        Saki wanted to end a game with +/-0 so she ignored a possible ron on a 5pin, because the player who played it was currently in the lead and she would overtake her. Then directly on the next turn a red 5pin was discarded. It was explained (by the club president) that Saki ignored the tile as well, because with the additional red 5 her hand would become to big to finish with +/-0. Howver since she ignored the 5pin in the turn before she was furiten for it anyway and couldn't call it even if she wanted. So the president didn't seem to know that rule which is hardly believable as this is absolute basic defensive strategy.    see    Nodoka dealt the red 5 after Saki's turn, so Saki wasn't in furiten.    Wow I don't remember CG being used for anything but the mahjong table mechanics.     If the player ignores a hand completing tile discard from an opponent, they are in temporary furiten until their next draw.  That said, you can see in  that Nodoka is after Saki. Riichi Mahjong follows a Counter-Clockwise flow. By the time that Nodoka drops the Aka 5p, Saki is no longer in furiten as she would've drawn another tile by then.       Also, that was all in the first episode, not the second episode.   As everyone else said, Saki was in tenpai on 6th discard. Yuuki's 5pin was her 7th discard, and Nodoka's 5pin was her 8th discard. They skip some rounds for pacing reasons and you can just assume everyone knows the rules (except Kaori).   Shit I can't count. 6/7/8 should be 7/8/9, but you get the point    Interesting but is this really the time Ritz? It better be Saki related at least and it seems a little early for Teruhayu.     If the player ignores a hand completing tile discard from an opponent, they are in temporary furiten until their next draw.  Yeah, I know. But I'm pretty sure the tiles were consecutive discards without Sakis turn inbetween, Nodoka discarded the 5pin and then that genki girl (can't remember her name) discarded the red 5. I will rewatch it later when I'm home, though and see if I missed something.     See   That's the table of the game. Remember, Riichi is counter-clockwise. Hell, here is a page from the manga depicting the seat order.    Nodoka discarded the 5pin and then that genki girl (can't remember her name) discarded the red 5.   Well, theres your fucking problem. You're remembering things wrong. Yuuki dropped a regular 5p and Nodoka dropped the red 5p.  Yuuki (genki girl) first discarded the regular 5p which Saki ignored. Then came Mako (green hair) and Saki's turns. By the time Nodoka dropped the red 5p, Saki has drawn from the wall and ended her temporary furiten.              These kids play better than Seiko.     Not that guy, but I think he's talking about that totally-real-biography by that Koizumi guy.    Maybe they'll annouce an spin off with Akagi?    she will try to find her father in Shimane prefecture this time.   RitzHayu      I wonder what the story is between those two. They must be friends IRL or something.   TOKI TOKI   TOKI! AKAN!    Every time that Ritz wins a mahjong game he has to do a special chapter. Don't ask what she has to do if he wins - it never happened.  Just joking.       伝説の少女 説 の 少 女         He's her long-lost father.   This thread better not go Toki again.  Which show would you like to see a crossover with? I think the girls from Yuyuyu are lesbian enough to reach the finals.    who?     Free! Eternal Summer     Named characters remainung in the bowl: Shino, Kokoro, Zenno, Legend, Cat Chamber. Place your bets who will be playing against Shino and Kokoro in the next round and who will pass to final.    Bamboo Blade. Vanguard: Azuma Sergeant: Miya Miya Lieutenant: Saya Vice Captain: Kirino Captain: Tama-chan         We don't know if the players will be split up or not, so Shino and Kokoro could play together.  I also want to see Harue and Mihirogi.      Too bad al of YuYuYu girls get it worse than Toki after using powers.    Akagi    Akagi should teach at Kiyosumi.     Akagi's in space.     Kainou-pro could channel his spirit.   Rough predictions for final game. Teru+ Satoha+ Kuro- Yuki- Sumire+ Hao+ Yuu- Mako- Shibuya- Choe+ Ako+ Hisa- Seiko+ Megan- Arata- Nodoka+ Awai- Nelly- Shizuno+ Saki+/-0        The Legend of Koizumi.     Pft. Rinkai isn't making it to the finals. Uzusan and Himematus for the win!     Wouldn't that mean Kiyosumi loses? Nodoka isn't that good.  Also Seiko + seems off.      I feel like Saki should be breaking out of her +/- 0 shell and  dragging the world into new era of despair,  showing her sister how far she's come.    Achiga loses and shitrue kills herself. The end.     And then she is reborn, stronger and more dangerous than before.    How do you pronounce 7447? Seven-four-four-seven? Seventyfour-fourtyseven? Nana-yon-yon-nana? Nanajuyon-yonjunana?     seven four four seven    Nanoha.    Though I want Usuzan to pass, Nelly has to job harder than Seiko did for it to happen (she clearly doesn't intend to) and Himematsu facing Kiyosumi three times in a row is against the flow. Besides, Rinkai are the only ones who are absolutely not playing in racist individuals, so finals will be the last we can see of them.  Vice-captain prediction is the one I am most confident in. Megan's and Arata's powers were fully explored, while Seiko's weren't, so she should have an edge over them. As for Nodoka, she is middle school champion, period. Now that she doesn't restrict herself from using left hand the game will be a one-sided massacre with Seiko barely surviving.      Семь-четыре-четыре-семь.    I'd be up for some zenryouku zenkai yakuman bombs.    Seventy four four seven     Saki will decide to destroy Nelly, in a vicious scorched earth maneuver that leaves them both robbed of points, while the other two schools squeak by.   Then it is revealed that Nelly dies her hair and wears contacts.       7,447. Seven, four-forty-seven.    At what rate does this get subbed?    I think the last time I saw the first episode posted was around 6 months ago.     1:0     Are you telling me i have to wait 6 months on that cliffhanger?    I'm telling you that I have no idea.   Bump for Shinohayu raws Also Fujita-pro's birthday.    The translator intends to do the rest, but if he's too slow you can always just watch the raws or read the manga.     Or I can take a ride on a time machine!  That handily also translates all languages.       Long haired Saki!     It's her third stage power-up.    Saki crossover with DBZ. How long will fights last?  dead thread  How will you propose marriage to your favorite Saki? Serious answers only.     How will you propose marriage to your favorite Saki?  Tell her that I want to go to Nationals with her     So forceful.    More long haired Saki    Please keep posting or show me where I can find more. This is a miracle I wish I'd known about years ago    She looks like a real woman. What could have been...    i'd hollow out tile, put the ring in it, and throw it at a little girl      I don't read moon or know how to play Mahjong but I'm getting the game anyway, wish me luck /a/.     I would abduct her from her tents in the middle of the night. <br/>      What is the first thing real life people will do with this game?     Rape it.     I think you should let her ron on it.    That wasn't deep at all Teru.    Where's her horn?    Hair only sticks up when it's short     Fine, next time it'll be straight into the kidneys.    Never realized Saki-san has the same VA as Rin from Fate. Nice range.    She sounds closer to Saki as Hayate.    Toki, do you ever think people are looking at us from somewhere beyond our reality.  No, Ryuuka, that's just silly talk.      second strongest school     What does Toyone's height smell like?    Cucumber Melon    Years.  Good luck, anon.      I like how she comes into focus towards the end.   Riichi Ippatsu Tsumo vs. open Tanyao  Which is more annoying when you have yakuman tempai?     Riichi Ippatsu Tsumo, unless it's open Tanyao dora 3.     AI Mahjong   Start in North Seat   Get Chiihou tenpai, get hype as fuck   Suddenly, West scores a Renhou from South's discard   Well, actually the game doesn't recognize Renhou so the winning hand was actually a plain tanyao but still.   And I never played AI Mahjong ever again          If you mean that someone won while you had a yakuman hand (implied by ippatsu tsumo) then riichi ippatsu tsumo because of the ippatsu yaku.  Open tanyao is a valid strategy to win a round quickly and to prevent that another player wins a big hand.       Which is more annoying when you have yakuman tempai?  How about choosing the wrong wait, only to see what could've been the winning tile spill out in front of you?     Subscribed to your mahjong blog   Anyone ever gotten a junchan + sanshoku?  DON'T YOU DIE ON ME   I did back when I used to play the game in Tenhou. I had a baiman, but it wasn't enough to beat the 1st place.    I want to  NTR_  Ryuuka.   Let this thread stay toki.    What if she gained weight?     Then I can share her with Toki.   Just don't expect to share Toki.   ~   I want to play  tenhou_  with you guys!     With long hair, Saki looks a lot like Shino.     keep the thread alive  Still waiting for proper raws. ~30 pages of Shinohayu    DEPEETS LROE    Igarashi working hard as always.  Ritz should just officially make Saki monthly and do a consistent 30 pages instead of constant delays and broken promises.     What makes you think it'll make any difference? Give her a month, and we'll get one chapter every two months.  Ritz's a hack.          30 page   Hard work   Please, in the old days she could curn out 70 or 80 page no problem.   Ritz stop pestering her.           Could they POSSIBLY be related?     Yeah, a couple. I threw on an iipeiko once for top level beauty, but I haven't been able to replicate that one as much as I've tried    Is she the angry faced pro in the main series.  I don't really want to plunge in to Shinohayu since I am waiting it to end first to avoid hell waits.      That's because Ritz locked up Igarashi in the basement during the run of Achiga.  Since then, Igarashi reported Ritz to the authorities and so Ritz couldn't employ the "Lock-Igarashi-in-the-basement-unti<wbr>l-she-finishes-the-pages" tactic anymore.</wbr>      That's Ritz.  Read it anyway and wait with us.   Igarashi should give Ritz a taste of her own medicine.       Ritz is busy taking photos for the backgrounds.  She asked to set Shinohayu in Okinawa (hello Kokoro, Wakane) or Hawaii, but it was rejected by the editor. I wonder why...       raws  posted 7 hours ago.   I was busy  working , sorry.  http://raw.senmanga.com/Shinohayu-T<wbr>he-Dawn-of-Age/022/1  http://raw.senmanga.com/Saki-Biyori<wbr>-Otona-no-Maki/39/1</wbr>  </wbr>                   and so it starts      Shino has two fans already. Time to spread the tanoshii.     nice starting hand     Shino has two fans already.  Does Richardson not count?     riichi   In the end, does this count as yuri or not.    Anyone?  So, what if the chances of this being localized? Everyone seems to think there's no chance, and if this was even two years ago I'd agree. But with the recent western success of Senran Kagura and Hyperdimension neptunia on the lewd front, as well as zero escape and Dangan ronpa on the twist filled VN front, I'd say there's a pretty good chance.  Damn .. The feels   I'd say 78% We still don't know what 4inifity is. Maybe it's a localization.     If you ask me, since 5pb's behind it, it's probably going to be a mix of if the Punchline video game does well in Japan and Steins;Gate doing well in the west with the new PS3/Vita release.   I know this is just the neutral end but I'm pissed Pine/Yuuta died for no reason  Let's hope the next one actually has the brains to fucking stay alive when being handed the opportunity      Let's hope the next one actually has the brains to fucking stay alive  That's your job, anon.     Is living in a possibly immortal body alone (except a bunch of weak no-name fagets) such a good thing? I'd say sacrifice Chiyoko.     That's your job, anon.  haha touche    PL twitter page says there'll be more info about the game this week or the next.   No, tis not the body but the soul that counts.    Yes. Or if not, just play the game and get a yuri end.     Does he count as a transgender protagonist?   In the end, its still shit   Is 78% a meme that I've just never seen before or something? This was getting spammed in another thread I was in earlier.    Was just my guess   It doesn't count as yuri because it's not even explicitly romantic. There were hints but it didn't go anywhere. It was a friendship end.   Shit end fitting for a shit show. Deserves to be the new samurai flamenco aka flop of the season.    No anon, as long as you play the game all can be forgiven. The game is all that matters. The anime doesn't need to be able to stand on its own two legs even a little bit.    Teraoka didn't even end up getting punished.  Really it would've been better if Yuuta just let her sacrifice herself.     feels  did you do the dank r9k frog meme face irl?      tfw Punchline was a letdown   tfw HxH and Bagserk on infinite hiatus   tfw Totsuka didn't win      What was up with the scene with Chiyoko in her idol group near the end? Is she still alive or what?   play the game for the true ending  It doesn't matter, that's not OUR Yuuta. That's someone else. Our Pine is dead and he's not coming back. https://d.maxfile.ro/tyoxzuazyk.mp4<wbr></wbr>     It's still Pine   Is it just me or was the spirit yuta smarter than yuta?   I'm guessing she was wearing a wig.    This spirit Yuuta is more informed than our Yuuta because our Yuuta pretty much explained the entire plot to him.     She uses the face mask     How does that thing even work.    watch that certain episode   The ending made sense for me. We knew that Mikatan's body was going to die as far back as episode 6, so we all predicted some sort of body swap ending, where  They all get their original bodies back, meaning Guriko dies   She and Teraoka switch, making a weird body swap romance between her and Yuuta, meaning Guriko dies   She switches with Yuuta, meaning one Yuuta dies  We also knew that having two Yuutas at the end wouldn't work out, but it was under the assumption that he would give his body back (or his original body) to the current spirit Yuuta.  It's also alright for it to be bittersweet. An ending like this is more memorable to me than a super happy ending where everything turns out alright. Teraoka has to go on living forever and making up for his sins, and Chiyoko can continue living as Mikatan due to the Facemaker/Voicemaker.  It's really depressing that Yuuta no longer exists in this universe, and I would have liked some sort of romantic follow-up between Mikatan and Yuuta, but I can accept that the games will expand on these matters.          Who was the cat?   Reincarnated Yuuta. Notice that Chiranosuke is a kitten in the episode, and 49 days have passed since Yuuta died, with his picture falling over when they go see Chiranosuke.  The last time Yuuta and Chiranosuke talk, the latter tells him that he hopes they can meet again someday. He eventually becomes a spirit and helps out the current spirit Yuutas.      Thanks for clearing it up for me   what pushed you to finish this chinese cartoon?  I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7.   I originally decided to watch the first episode due to the character style alone, as it reminded me a lot of Sushio. I wasn't really impressed by the PVs, and the first 5 minutes of the first episode were the most interesting to me. However, there was that rumor going around that episode 6 was going to be some game-changer, as Marina Inoue had said it was her favorite episode.  I also heard that Uchikoshi, the guy behind the Zero Escape series, was the writer for Punch Line, so I decided that it was only fair to give it a chance and see if it evolves beyond just mindless pantsu fanservice. It really started picking up at the end of episode 4, got better in 5, and episode 6 was worth the wait. Every episode since then was consistently good, and I really grew to like the characters and wanted to see how their story would play out.  Now this isn't really a series with that much symbolism. Instead, the fun is trying to unravel the plot episode by episode based on the clues you get, and then wait to see how the ending is handled, especially since this was written by a guy who is used to writing things so that multiple endings work.        I liked it from start to finish.  I'm glad I got on the ride from the first episode and never got off.  I like how the show presented everyone with the possibility that the world and everyone could end, and the series showed exactly just how. To me, it makes the ending feel like an accomplishment and achievement to Pine. Out of the billions of Yuutas, he was finally able to save the world. But could he save himself?  What made the ending even better was how the "peaceful" future went; it wasn't the future Pine expected. Watching the final episode, I intuitively knew that not everyone could be saved; but as Chiyoko Überfied for the last time, I caught myself hoping that everyone could survive and live together the way they all wanted to.  The show betrayed my hope, but that's what I think made it so much more powerful. Pine did not want this future to happen, but he's glad it did.           FUCK YEAH, HUMANITY!   Picked it up because MAPPA did SnB and Garo. I enjoyed the fun, light-hearted moments in between the mysteries and plot twists and the characters were unique and likable. I was actually surprised how much I actually cared for the whole cast by the end of it. Had fun the whole time and have no complaints.     reminded me a lot of Sushio  The designer was a Gainax/Trigger employee.    All these nice response tho        Chiyoko makes me want to commit a crime.    Prepare to get your ass kicked   Haven't started with the series yet. Does it stay well on its own or is it a blue balling advert for the game?   It held up well, personally. Doesn't go into detail on a few things but MCs problems are all resolved in the end, and the main cast is lovable as fuck.    What kind of crime?    What  said The characters are adorable and interesting but their development weren't enough. Needs more episodes.     Unspeakable things.    play the fucking game: the animation  i feel tricked      I'm an ally of justice! Seigi no mikata! I will not allow this.      Anon, when you want to say  hold hands  here, you just spoiler it and hope that mods are asleep.   First time is scary, because the guy might feel rough, or he could be very soft. You might get sweaty, but the feeling of skin against skin is second to none.  I hear police sirens, sorry, I gotta g        Would you date Rabura?   In the end, does this count as yuri or not.    Only to get close to Meika-chan.    Yes and break up after bed.   Gliese pls go       I would date that qt3.14 with the kid    That's adultery!    Yeah, our videos would be adult videos    we'll never get to know the pulp fiction crew   who was this guy supposed to be, again?   Hitler    A US colonel being possessed by Tsubouchi Qmay, the same spirit that possessed Ito's crazy teacher Tomoda. He wants the bear cub because he believes it's the only way he can become a W, which will let him survive VR-1's impact.  Tsubouchi Qmay was the original leader of Qmay, but he died from Überfying too much and continued to live on as a spirit.      That kid wants to aggressively /ss/ badly.   I don't think I understood what happened.  Why did he go back in time to start the loop? what about the cat, who is he?  Also, I am probably forgetting about this but do we know who was the one possessing the army general?     Oh right, thanks. So Rabura and Ito knew who he was because Yuta told them about Qmay, then?     Why did he go back in time to start the loop?  Because someone had to go back in time to make sure all this works out right. The Yuuta at the end is probably the only Yuuta who will go back in time to do this, since that area is out of the loop. He's just making sure it happens correctly.  what about the cat, who is he?   Reincarnated Yuuta  Also, I am probably forgetting about this but do we know who was the one possessing the army general?     They overheard Yuuta's entire story when he was telling it to Meika.             who was the one possessing the army general  Qmay      &gt;what about the cat, who is he?    Reincarnated Yuuta  Wait what   Because someone had to go back in time to make sure all this works out right  Why? things already worked out right, why start again?         read  Enough time has passed since Yuuta died for Chiranosuke to be born and grow a bit.     This series is a clusterfuck, in a good way.    This series is a clusterfuck, in a good way  Not really. Excel Saga was.    Would someone mind telling me what a W is? Becoming one lets you survive the asteroid, but is it just a position in the Qmay group or something more?  when will MAPPA get their first big hit?   Oh yeah, and  Why? things already worked out right, why start again?  Someone possessed Rabura in the past and made the schematics for Meika and all the future information about Justice Punch that Professor Tenga needed. If no one goes to the past to fax this information to him, you'll end up with a paradox in which none of what just occurred can happen. Yuuta goes back to the past and fulfills his duty by making sure the future can happen. After all, trying to rewrite history would also create a paradox since it would remove the need to go back in time to rewrite history, meaning no one would go back in time to change things. He just has to enable the future to happen. But since it's before the loop and timeline split, he doesn't have to loop back every time, only this one time.  The loop itself actually begins on Monday, December 21st, 2015, and ends on Thursday, December 31st, 2015.         Thanks for the explanation     The loop itself actually begins on Monday, December 21st, 2015, and ends on Thursday, December 31st, 2015   I think the game gets released near these dates.     It's also a buy the game ending, because the supremely happy ending didn't happen yet. Muhi's power could create an ending where all three of them live.     If you don't beat it by then you have to buy the game again   This is how ZE3 is going to be funded     I'd still plough Narugino all the same.   I want to fuck Narugino  Why did Yuuta have to be such a fag and cover up his sexy body?      Why is she her skin so dark?    Time paradoxes is something fiction rarely does right. The Pine who died had a very unique set of experiences on him that the ghost Pine hadn't, which means that the time paradox already exist, as one Pine is fundamentally different from the other. In fact, it also means that he can change the future without triggering the same loop conditions (which were vastly different on the two loops we saw). In the end, it all points out to a setting where a time paradox isn't really possible, but you have alternate realities instead.   I know I'm overthinking this, but I can't help it with time travel shenanigans.          Because dark skin in best skin    When they start making shows otaku want instead of shows they want to do. Same reason most BONES production are bombing.   Meika shouldn't be existing, because there's nobody to actually create her original design.   It was me, Dio.    This is the bootstrap paradox. Uchikoshi wrote a wall of text in English about it in response to a query about Punch Line. https://twitter.com/Uchikoshi_Eng/w<wbr>ith_replies</wbr>     That's the punchline    Yes, there is. Herself   So who was the bear? Was he actually just a lie by Teraoka to trick the Qmay leader or is there another story behind it?   Panties.    He became the cat, you know that right?    There is no romance because Yuuta has been a girl too long and has identified himself as a girl. And girls cannot love other girls.    No I wouldn't date a fucking slut, what is she a stripper now?    What kind of mindfuck would you call when you're now in the body who also happen to be the body of the person you loved the most in this world?     Not "That's u-turn, anon."  Wasted opportunity.    I want to plough Narugino and Ito. Hard.   haha its funny because that's how japs would say "your turn" in english...    Q: I understand that the story’s pacing is the same as the anime’s, but are there original developments in the game?    Uchikoshi: For things that weren’t represented or remained mysterious in the anime, see the game. Playing the game will answer questions that you may have. One particularly important thing is that the ending is different.    Q: It’s different?    Uchikoshi: Yes. The content of the game is different from the tv anime. The frequency of time loops is also different – the game has more.    Q: So, about the ending . . .    Uchikoshi: What to say? The TV anime ends at episode 12, but the game adds in about 10 episodes’ worth of content.    Well I don't know about you guys but I think this is it for me.  I'm not going to depend desperately on fan translations or the thin hope at localization anymore. I'm sick of getting games years after they hit or never being able to read companion LNs.  I'm going to learn Japanese.   Punchline is worth it.                     What if  the final yuuta dont enter to guriko's body, he be a free spirit. Girls adopt chiranosuke, yuuta posses the cat and live as a cat. He leave cat's body and return the past, in a cat form. Like a first chapter yuuta who lives a big part of his live in the chiyoko's body, and its why his spirit looks like chiyoko     My english sucks, i know     You probably shouldn't. The narrative is essentially going to have the game mechanics built around doing several time loops in order to achieve the true end with each successive loop acting as a newgame+.  It's going to get super tedious.      Muhi is a W, like Teraoka and Qmay said, but he wasn't the only W, which is what Qmay was led to believe.    and has identified himself as a girl.  Let's not do this for the thousandth time.       8/10, solid finale for a solid series. I wish they hadn't gone for the "You're gonna carry that weight." cliche, and they had gone ahead with the full switch.  Hell, Guriko was ready to atone with her life and they went with the "lolno, too easy, I'm gonna die just so you can reflect on what you did and suffer a life of feeling guilty" It's as retarded as the guy that cut his own dick to displease his wife. Fuck, the more I think of it, the more it pisses me off.        Then I'll find out for myself!     tfw Yuuta will continue to leap forever   making right what once was wrong...     That's exactly what happens, except that Yuta doesn't possess the cat but actually takes its form.   I ended up enjoying this shit more than I thought I would  maybe you can archive perfect happy ending on the games     Yuuta is already Chiranosuke. He was reincarnated as him after he died. Think of it like Kagome and Kikyou. They seem like two very different people, but Kagome is still her reincarnation and has some similarities to her.     I'm going to learn Japanese.    Punchline is worth it.  I enjoyed Punchline, but it really isn't. And ZE3, which could be worth it, will totally be an English-first game given the lack of support Japan has for the franchise      That's just how Japanese culture work. Like if you murder one person they'd kill you, however if you're a war criminal they allow you to enjoy the remainder of your life where you will atone for the sins you committed. Its just Japan being retarded again...     I don't know, possessing the cat actually sounds more plausible to me.     Yuta is the cat  is there any proof or is this just speculation?    Well, it worked for Ghost Trick.    Its strongly implied.    Chiranosuke is different in personality to Yuuta, like watching cat porn on his laptop and drinking sake. He's not being possessed, and he's kind of his own character, but he's still in this because he's Yuuta.  <br/>      Excel Saga was great, and I admit I haven't read the manga, but from what I can recall things were forced together just for comedic effect, it wasn't really clusterfucky as this. It was just stuff almost randomly smashed together. Also, people knowing from the past had no real consequences, just "oh, my long lost friend" or "oh, my long lost enemy".      You are your own grandfather thing on time travel   So... does Chiyoko/Mikatan pretend to be Yuuta now whenever his sister comes to visit them? That's kinda fucked up isn't it?   That fucker is really pissed off to yell at us in english...    You'd become different too after six billion Yuutas.    or maybe she knew all about the (im boy trapped in a girls body)  so all you need to archive perfect happy ending is  Beat up Possessed Teacher    Stop Robot from hacking shit  The game is not gonna be fun         I'm not sure how to interpret the ending. Chiyoko and Ito are both leaving for school. Ito is in normal clothing, when before she was in a private school for girls where she wore a uniform. Chiyoko is in a sailor fuku. I don't know if they're going to the same school now or what. We never even knew what Yuuta did for school.     Punchline isn't the only thing I want to play or read, though. But Punchline is worth pushing myself over the starting line, I mean.      Ito says she goes to a technical school in the end, which is where she got the cat from. I can't remember what a technical school is though.     No you must live and atone.   Oh, fuck off. Lamest shit since communism.     I think it's just him promising C to save G.    I don't get why people are getting so pissed over this. If Yuuta hadn't done this, he would have to live in Pine's immortal body and he wouldn't get to be Chiranosuke and help all the other Yuutas.    So wait a minute. Isn't the original loop broken as shit?  Spirit Yuuta needs to go back and possess Rabura. But in the first loop we experience Spirit Yuuta never actually does that, which would violate the whole loop principle.     Yuuta is pretty smart and has planned out things far ahead into the future. Also Guriko made a mistake, it doesn't fucking nullify their friendship. Pine wanted to protect them and he did that.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocat<wbr>ional_school#Japan</wbr>    A Technical School is where, instead of being a full College/University with secondary classes and general learning, you attend specifically to learn how to do a certain job. A Technical School for Aeronautic Engineers would be hands-on working with parts and fixing example planes.     The reizokan fax machine or whatever is capable of sending stuff to the past, so physical Yuuta could have done it in the first loop, but since he was dead in loop 2, spirit Yuuta had to do it manually.  Or more likely when Yuuta died his spirit went free again and went back to the past to do it. That'd also fit in with the Yuuta-in-Chiranosuke theory.  I guess we gotta play the game.           So then Ito's going to a new school.       bad guy dies because he failed his goal.   instead he must live and be wake up to guilt and pain.   I actually like this.       Yeah, that's to be expected. Why would she go to her old school again?   Its not a bad thing, but its overused as fuck.        Its not a bad thing, but its overused as fuck.   so is the alternative "I pay it gladly" ending, there's nothing new under the sun      I think "villain makes a heroic sacrifice at the last moment to instantly atone for all the bad things they've done" has been done way more. That's the end I was expecting, but I'm happy they went with partial body swap instead.    Dropped it 2 episodes ago     ...      Case in point, Ito was killing American military forces left and right. Is she the cutest war criminal ever?     they attacked 1st     Nah, you can see people escaping.  S-sometimes.      Guriko got off way too easy.   They're the badguys of the world. Fuck them...     Yuta never got to fuck Narugino in his "own" body knowing all the sweet spots     For the soldiers, I thought it was funny how they got a few guys that could speak English quite well but then left it obvious they were Japanese due to a few bouts of Engrish.  And then suddenly we got soldiers who sounded to be native English speakers. What's up with that anyway? Why do they settle for Engrish instead of just finding a native speaker? There's got to be a decent demand for them.      The british guy sounded alright. Not sure why he was with the US army but hey.      They just don't care, and no one who will watch it over there will be able to tell the difference. I'm learning Japanese and I'm getting an ear for it, but I still wouldn't be able to tell if some random Japanese on prime time TV was legit or not.     what the fuck? he clearly still considers himself to be a guy     His spirit form is his borrowed body, tho, so clearly he's used to it.  Also he ditched the "I'm a man" thing in order to get a sneak peek on Meika's pantsu.       damn. RIP Yuta our savior. He died for our sins. Damn it man why couldn't you have just swapped with guriko. :'^( gonna miss him. he went through so much to save everyone and create a world where everyone could live happily. but instead chose not to live in that world. maybe it was because Chiyoko had asked him to save Guriko too.Well you got what you fucking wanted Chiyoko!   But anyways, now that the ghost Yuta is traveling back in time isn't he wiping out this timeline completely? Maybe hes going to recreate this one but basically this time he is going to actually get his body back. Maybe prevent the whole missile thing to begin with.   But if he doesn't and just recreates this timeline exactly, would that mean that every disembodied Yuta would always have to loop back, do everything, and then ultimately die again?  idk what im saying anymore i need some time to digest this         How many Americans did Ito slay? She wrecked them hard.   Poor Paladins.     The elements are laid out for a better ending in the game.  I just want an OVA sequel with both Pine and Guriko taking part in wacky hijinx at the boarding house.        But anyways, now that the ghost Yuta is traveling back in time isn't he wiping out this timeline completely?   It can go either way.   Time travel has two possibilities- Changing the past negates the future, or it splits off into an alternate dimension.  This show isn't telling us which is the right answer, which is good, because it means you can take it however you want. Either the remaining survivors lived on in their world while Yuuta went on to save another dimension's humanity in his search for a happy and peaceful future, or this was just a practice run that will be reset when he alters things and will eventually lead him to changing the future to get the best result.  I think that in the end if everything works out and there's no reason to continue the loop, the spirit Yuuta will need to find a new body.   We actually have the means to do that, since Meika could theoretically build him a robot body- there's also Muhi who's got some sort of regenerative ability too.               thats not really what happened. She was like "dont look at me you pervert" and he was like "what? before you said it was fine because I'm a girl!' Sounded more like he was just annoyed that she diregarded him being a guy when he said it before, but now that she knows the story she is treating him differently.  And just because he is used to being in that body doesn't mean he considers himself to be a girl on the inside. We see that he tyes his boobs up with bandages and dresses/styles himself like a guy. Plus it would create a lot of confusion and ruin the twist if we saw that he looked differently when in ghost form. I image that your ghost form is what you imagine/know you look like and when he goes to look in the mirror he expects to see what himself in his current body.     Enjoy your bad ending animeonly fags.  Traslation never.     in Buddhist belief it takes 49 days to be reincarnated    Even with MC dying which is often a solid shit end no matter the series, this was a pretty satisfying end. That "you will live with what you did" was fucking intense. 10/10 ending for a overall 7.5/10 anime, will rewatch at some point     I was a bit sad at first, but then I remembered there's actually two MCs, so he's still half alive.    I mean I know it's an anime so the story is pants-on-head-retarded, but wtf was that Guriko shit   people experimented on me   you wouldn't understand my pain   therefore everyone must die   but hey cool let's just be friends and switch bodies again   also Pine stopping his Uber and not just finishing Guriko, thereby not forcing Chiyoki to go Uber and die. I get it, it's a friendship above all else, but still dumb           He was brainwashed by a cult. He's literally a nutso victim.     Guriko was looking for a way out all along    And in Shinto the mourning period is 49 days.   STOP saying the cat is reincarnated Yuuta. The cat is just a cat.  Why would he watch cat porn if he was a human in disguise?  Stop confusing people that come here to seek explanations.       Yes, she live as a girl and died as a girl it was more complex than a typical genderswap      the specifically mentioned 49 days makes it pretty clear<br/>     You're not fooling anyone, Chiranosuke.     implying Yuta isn't a furry  In all seriousness, it was made quite clear that he was pulling up the cat porn on purpose to mess with Yuta.     Qmay's spirit died on the same day. The cat could be him.    A mixture of being a pretty much forever alone test subject and growing up in a cult, probably. Like he does say that he honestly loves the ideals Qmay stands for (regular humans being inferior beings and all), but he also still cares for his old friends and wants to be friends with them because heck, they're the only friends he has ever had and they're the same as him.   be glorious superior übermensch   kill all inferior humans (who made you suffer)   live happily with your friends who are also glorious superior übermensch   Then he realises that he fucked up since one of his best friends is dying because of him, thinks the best way to solve the problem is to sacrifice himself and gets served by Yuuta and has to actually deal with it.          Chiyoko.   So wait, I've got a question for you /a/. I remember hearing about this show a while ago, before it started airing, and thinking it sounded awful. What eventually got me to watch was when I learned of Kotaro Uchikoshi's involvement because I was a huge fan of 999 and VLR. I went in fully aware of the wild ride it was going to be as a result.  If not for that I'm certain I would have stayed away. So why the hell did you guys decide to watch it?     Uchikoshi, MAPPA, Gainax Design, Popular Composer. It was a dream team.    MAPPA!     I've never played an Uchikoshi game and just picked it up at random.  I was drawn in by the mystery angle where you put the story together from bits and pieces, and I really like shows with a permanent setting that has a lot of character like the Korai House.  It's an immersive show.         Uchikoshi and it looked like  fun     nu/a/s first genserswap animoo  it has been a good while though, but a generic genderswap romance. very common for anime or manga.     Body switched for almost their whole life  Really? Then I'd like to know someting similar like above     You will only find a soul swapping that took place for 9 years in here.    Yamada and the Seven Witches. literally airing the same season.    Yuri, selfcest, straight, non-blood related incest all in one.     almost their whole life  No.     But the body swapping for that show has not been for most of their life.     It's ok for bittersweet because they have more impact   Even if the MCs reasoning was literally fucking retarded   If you actually want ta proper conclusion that addresses what happens, buy the game!  Punchlinefags in a nutshell.       Kill yourself.    The look on the dads face.     you do know that you're in a punchline thread, right? and that shitposting is against the rules?      Why would he watch cat porn if he was a human in disguise?  He's not a human in disguise. He was a human, now he is a cat.    Did I understand that right?  black hair is in purple hair body   purple hair is in white hair and acts like a faggot   white hair is in black hair body   in the end, black is in black, purple in white, purple body kill and white hair soul goes back in past?         and why is that important to the point that Punchline is a gender bender?  http://bato.to/search?genres=;i15&amp;g<wbr>enre_cond=and</wbr>       Nope, white soul (Yuuta) is also kill. There were two Yuutas, the one who was kicked out of his body and stayed as a spirit (possessing Rabura etc) goes back to the past to set the loop up and try to get a better ending and the one who swaps bodies with dying Mikatan (the one who we've followed during the whole series) dies.     gender bender  No it's more accurate to label it as a freak friday slip like characters swap bodies (or, equally, swap minds/souls). There's Chiyoko who is originally a girl and still swapped into a girl. No change     Sorry, I'll try to circlejerk only. No negative opinions allowed.  I really like how they left a lot of plot points open or did things that just don't make sense under the guise of "it's only an advertisement for the game." It makes for a great mystery.       It's not the focus, though.      It makes for a great mystery   It would feel lacking and wouldn't be as good if the series didn't end without it       that's a lot between circlejerking and what you're obviously doing, baiting and shitposting      If "it's shit and the fanbase is retarded" is a valid opinion, I've got another one for you. You're shit and get the fuck out.      It would feel lacking  No, it would feel competent.     baiting and shitposting   Anyone who has a negative opinion is shitposting  How could anyone have a problem with a complete mess of a story that doesn't even pretend to address half the issues it brings up and has been a disjointed mess from week one? You're right, it must be shitposting.         First Gakkou Gurashi CM: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yxf<wbr>ztD5ksls&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]  It looks pretty good.     First time I'm hyped for a Lerche show since Carnival Phantam.   Well that was  misleading   Looks fine, but how they handle the post apocalyptic parts and the zombies is going to make or break the adaptation, so it's pretty much nothing.    The CM already trolled us  based Lerche     Didn't watch the CM but they usually put the best looking scenes from the first few episodes in those.    Alittel disappointing that there are no zombie or dog zombie in that CM    They can't even go that far with this or they'd spoil people.  Man, the inevitable reactions of people who will watch this blind are going to be golden.      Not bad.    Seems like they decided to increase the dog's screntime, huh. That's good   it's gonna hit like a brick when he got turned.      Unless GG is getting priority treatment from Lerche I don't see it ending up good.   Which scenes are we looking forward to the most?  Wow, it sure is comfy SoL with loads of heartwarming moments. Pick up.    Man, the inevitable reactions of people who will watch this blind are going to be golden.   The key visuals and synopsis already state they are survivors of a zombie apocalypse, anybody who overreacts to the "tweest" would be a faggot pretending to be retarded like this guy       I think everyone knows the twist. However, I think a lot of people believe it'll be a cute sort of zombie apocalypse with no real suffering. There's plenty of LNs and such like that.    Obviosuly.  Also, the zombie dog.       There are still people who just download shit blindly without even reading the synopsis or just based on screenshots.    They've also updated the official site.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gw-<wbr>WkbDHBT0</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=GsA<wbr>moRoe0Zk</wbr>  [ ]  The other two      That mysterious new girl is also colored now. Oh and apparently MOSAIC.WAV is composing the music for the series.    The helicopter!  Or, if they go for a second cour,  the eventual breakdown of everyone in the cast. :)       The eyes look weird.    Who the fuck are these people   How will they handle what happens afterwards?   Fuck off     Is this the first genuine grimdark zombie apocalypse anime we've had? HotD obviously doesn't count since that's some campy B-movie cheese and some of the other series with zombie elements I've recalled are in the same boat as well.  Huh. That's pretty queer if not rather interesting.    Another SoL? Kiniro was enough to be honest.   Oh god, yes. Little girls suffering is delicious.  Man, closed eyes one is gonna get everyones killed isnt she.       when there's off model QUALITY shots in the fucking preview, you know a show is not worth watching. DROPPED.  only thing left on my summer watch list is Working S3. i guess the nips really want me to drop this hobby and go out and get a life...    Translation when?    You'd think that there'd be more when that zombie boom a few years back happened.     It's Lerche and they are doing like two more shows next season, your fault for getting your hopes up.  Also, I don't know what to think of the supposed 8 or so writers working on it, it can be a complete mess.       Fuck. First we lost radio-chan and now this !?       I want edits of this image    sorry    A teacher, school president, Kurumi's dead crush, I don't remember the girl.    She'll probably just be an anime original victim.    When indeed...    Which ones?  The one who is infected or the one who mindbroke?       Kurumi's dead crush   wtf?      7. And considering that the original author is in charge of the composition I don't think that it should be bad.    Don't worry, the little girl is very tough  and soft like a teddy bear      I hope so.    It's fine,  it's not like she was ever really there    I hope that they'll release the actual PV earlier than on July 2.   He was faceless in the manga.   How early on does it get revealed that  Yuki is imagining Megu-nee?  It has been a while since I've read the first part of the manga.  I feel this will turn out like that tarot Madoka ripoff. Generic suffering.   Isn't that the retard from who was infected in supermarket?    All of them.   Why did they add that weird pink surrounding her pupil?  It's like she is staring straight into my soul. If you replaced that part with more brown it would look way better.      I was thinking the same, but I'm not sure.   No, this guy's the very first zombie Kurumi ever killed.    Oh shit, this means they'll expand the pre-outbreak flashbacks and drag the delusion switch all the way to the end of ep1.   Who's looking forward to them meeting some new girls (from Idolmaster)?   What happened to the crossbow    Who are these sluts?    This was brilliant. Cant remeber a zombie movie or manga that has done something similar. Maeby andys tape from the dawn of the dead remake.    Middle looks like the one who'd die first. Left does things to my dick    Forgot pic  My new waifus.         It'd be nice if the adaptation got this far, but I doubt it. Nice sucker punch for the last episode maybe     This happened.    So cute girls really are the best at surviving in this world, huh.    Actually a lot of shit happened in this chapter.     Can someone upload them elsewhere? They're blocked in Germoney.     ...why?    Sasuga shovel -chan.  Incredible how the blackhaired one manage to survive zombie apocalypse with a skirt that short.  Imagination loli cant show expression like those.       Which ending was most disappointing?   R2 was fun at least. AZ was just a ball of whirling bad angst and drama for no reason with Count Faggot. What a waste of time.    That's what he said    Obligatory    A/Z because literally nothing happened.  It starts off with the war and builds up for the entire first and second seasons, then Hime wakes up and she's like lolnope and everyone agrees with her.  The war ends and nothing significant happens other than Slaine being thrown in prison because fuck Slaine.  At least in VVV's and GC's ending, shit actually happened.          You and I both, anon.

USA stores are out of the question for me, since they either require immediate payment or the shipping is beyond ridiculous.      Thanks to the anon who posted about the Hobby Search sale.   She is really cute.    I like to reuse my boxes when I ship things to sell because I am a friend to the environment. Not a casual tree killing consumer.

Are they even any good or is this a ruse?    I asked last thread but I want more opinions. What do you guys think about Pureneemo dolls? I just found a (very) good deal of one from my waifu and if they're good I'll actually buy her.     All NIB btw.     Good thing I don't like their Nendos, Figmas and that I decided to pass on the Stronger scales since they will look like shit unless you get the full set.     How many times has Tharja been glued?     all bandwagon shit   It's always those people who end up selling shit.      No idea, sorry. If it's you're waifu, you may as well go for it.    Anyone know where I could maybe preorder these? HLJ doesn't have them. Seems like they're made by Takara Tomy  <br/>   I'll give you $20 for all of them shipped.

There's 1 prize figure and a bunch of small time merch so I've bought anything and everything I can find. There's only 1 GK that I've never seen and no proxy has been able to find it for me.

Jeeze it's about time. And this was all for a replacement part from GS.   Do people like her because she sounds almost inhuman?  Everyone else sounds like a typical voice actor in a sound booth. While Maki sounds like someone putting on a fake accent and talking from behind you.     pre-order starts July 1st  Anyone see anything on the Raiden nendo? Saw he has a nude body but am worried it'll be a GSC exclusive   If it is, how shitty would it be to order straight through GSC?       took 50 days for a replacement part to get through customs  What the fuck     Senbonzakura Miku Nendo how much?    It was a new leg part for my Amatsukaze nendo. They must have thought it was some kind of bullet or something.    Deja vu    My only package that's ever gotten lost in the mail was a replacement piece from GSC. No tracking so after a month I emailed them and they sent me another one.    Did they open it?    my only package that's ever gotten lost is things I send to other people on Ebay.    I'm picking it up tomorrow.    I'm still waiting on my RSAL package from AmiAmi after a month. I should probably send them an e-mail.    Why?     After a month   You're fully aware that SAL can take up to 4 months, right?       Yes, but this is as far as it has gotten in that time. My USAL packages consistently take 2 weeks. My last one took 9 days.     Yikes     Yes, but this is as far as it has gotten in that time. My USAL packages consistently take 2 weeks. My last one took 9 days.   It really doesn't matter in what time you usually get them with that shipping method, it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 months, if you send them a mail before that they'll basically tell you to fuck off since the limit time is still far away.      Doesn't matter, they'll just tell you to wait.    I dispatched it, out of my hands anon. Look at my hands! No package, see? Baka gaijin.    Yeah. That.  Zero, new in box.  Characters I liked? Sorry you don't have a tongue.  $30 shipped.          Email or mfc?     Not "Rook at mai handus anon-san. No pakkegu, shi?

Not that I'm arguing but every source I've seen states 5 weeks, Just like 3 months is supposed to be the max for surface.  I know when I had to contact them about EMS they told me to fuck off until it had been a month.      I'll give you 35 for Miku nendo.   Do any of your guys have any serious blu ray collection of anime? I'm talking more than 20 shows.  Most of the shows I would love to own are $50-$120 for the series. The only two shows that I really like and are affordable to me are Watamote and Mysterious Girlfriend X and both of those are just barely below $40. But I enjoy those and would rewatch them again once a year or so.  No...what's the point...I already have them digitally. Blu-ray better quality maybe?  I'm just trying to justify spending money on this. How do you guys justify blu rays?         How much for Red?    Maybe you should learn kana before attempting to imitate Engrish.    Ruku atto mai handosu! No pakkeji, shi? Baka waitto piggu. I think.     Closer but still not completely correct    I know. I tried my best.    You can watch it on the television.   My cat brought me a bird   Let it go    Thanks for sharing. Is it alive? My cats bring me dead rats and occasionally pieces of a bird every couple of days.    Maybe your cat wants you to order some doujin.      <br/>       Car imploded, pls buy burd         isn't it because with delivery services one weeks is actually 9-10 days since you can't count weekends, thus making Monday to Friday (5 days) Saturday, Sunday (that you don't count since they don't work) then Monday and Tuesday (7) to get a week?     Is this your cat?      clothesandfigs@gmail.com   $58 shipped if I can ship in the same box it came in with it being right against the cardboard, $63 if not         Cute     justifying localized  Nigger try buying some Jap BDs.      How much for Tharja and Tell Your World Miku?     I wiill, for today I put it in a cage with water until tomorrow morning.   Though my cat has big fangs, the birds seems to be ok.   yes that's my cat.          How did you know?    Jap BD's? I'm sorry I don't really understand what you mean by that. Like importing them form a Japanese seller? Would they even have english subs?  I don't see anything like this in the buyfag guide.      Yes No      If you need a justification to buy blu-rays you don't even watch then buy the original releases to support the creators directly instead of giving money to some shitty localization hack job.   Watch the rips, keep the BDs.       File width, size, quality and original file name. Here is his Ivy.    Only recently have I started buying JP releases, I've got about 40 volumes of things, about 15 of those are Jap.  I didn't really like spending $60 AUD on a single series, that comes in a crappy box with no extras.  Look for second hand Jap releases, you can find BD sets (maybe minus the collectors box) for rather cheap, and they look great with lots of bonuses.      Impressive    Yes, importing a Japanese blu-ray from Japan. A strange concept I know.    why don't you send him an email?     I going to try this out. Do you guys recommend any sources for Japanese blu rays?   I feel like im being trolled here.   I do appreciate your help though!         I get the feeling that most of us really have too much free time.     I feel like im being trolled here.      They're expensive, but content is better.   CDJapan has bunch of newer releases. Older things will go through manda like everything else or just YJA.       You're so useless that it's moe.    UPS said my package would be here today   check location   its literally the town next over   DELIVERY DELAYED DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, DELIVERY HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED...   mfw it was 78 degrees all day, bright and sunny  I fucking hate UPS so fucking much.        Depends on how many you are buying at once. Check the guide for a list of shops and compare prices.    Thank you. I honestly really only want like 4-5 blu rays for shows that I consider a 8/10 or above but that will probably grow in the future    Nobody wants to work at 78 degrees, it's a fucking sauna.     78   hot  It's California, it's not even humid, it's not even hot due to the sea breeze.  Meanwhile USPS is delivering my Yamato on time.       What kind of fag are you? Would you buy 1 great expensive figure or 2 good figures that cost the same as the great one together?  GSC exclusive bonus is some cutesy stickers.  Neither. I like nendoroids.     Whichever one I want more and appeals to me the most. Why compromise for any reason?    well amiami gave me a warning for missing a payment and now theres an order i want to cancel, wish me luck.   Quality&gt;Quantity    Someone with such poor forethought doesn't deserve any luck.   600mm of giggle inducing silliness.  After what GSC put out I don't think anyone will want Union Creative's Mikasa.   Team Fortress' Heavy x ray version.   Orca has a new bunny girl going up for preorder next week.  I am really looking forward to seeing proper shots of painted Cordelia.   I have literally 52 nendoroids     I'm surprised anyone still gives a shit about this terrible franchise. Everyone bought and sold their collections within the six months.     After the Levi they did I don't think anyone would want her anyways.   Might order 2 just for the arcade   I would buy neither and get art books instead.    Looks good(though I'm not very fond of her bikini's color) there aren't many Chouun's good figures out there.    The best and worst part of this manga for me is that it's kind of a history class on videogames. It's good because it's interesting but fuck it drags on so much.    The amount of merchandise it got so far is pretty astounding. It does seem to be slowing down a bit. Once the second season starts up I wonder how much more we will be seeing.    $70 shipped Tharja $60 shipped Miku  To the anon who emailed me for Miku nendo it's not letting me reply for some reason but $30 shipped is fine but if you wanna pay $35 I won't stop you.       Huh, I thought she wore white? Am I wrong?    It's the sort of thing idiots who don't know anything about buyfagging buy at cons, I guess. aka a large portion of SNK's fanbase.    https://<span>youtu.be/4-h_RLZWvzw  [ ]   We need kof nendos.       Her armor is white. She has it off.    I don't know, it's ugly like the source material.    Wow, rude.   How does TOM have Tenshi so cheap?  Time to cross the event horizon.   The one time /a/nons are being helpful and you think it's a troll.     I agree with you,all my money for some KOF nendos, even I will take KOF Cu-poches       tony taka   doll   the unholiest thing in recent ages.       The great expensive one. I usually buy nendoroids but for a figure which looks amazing I gladly pay more than just two okay ones. Like kotori from alter.    Welcome to the club   Should I buy multiples of amakuni Muramasa? Not sure how rare she'll be.      there are people shilling hotglued figures on this very thread     They even included the silly feet Awakening characters have while in combat.    Fuck off and kill yourself.    What I don't get is why anyone would even post this. It's not "shocking" and hasn't been ever. You're not funny or cool for recording it and posting it on a thread on /a/, and you're even sadder if you saved some faggot hotgluing his figure and then posted it on /a/.    Try eBay. People would pay a lot for them, especially Red and Elsa.    i thought it was moe so i wanted to share     Elsa is 4k brand new most places.      stalking people in an Anonymous image board     It's art anon. Or performing arts.     This saddens me.     Kill yourself.     Scat &amp; Diaperfags rank higher than you dumbasses into hotglue. At least their fetishes aren't huge waste of money     Are you from 6 months ago?       hot gluing unironically      Diapers get pretty expensive, buddy.       tfw going to nippon land in October      tfw can't buy figs due to holiday cost     life is suffering          Why    Reduce,  reuse , recycle. That's what 'ol grandma used to say.    It's just as much "Art" as the retards who make 2 minute walking simulators about gay children running away from home. No, I'd actually consider that more of an artwork than this. Congrats.    Who the hell go to Japan without extra money for the goodies?   Friend go to Nippon with me   Ask if he wanna add more luggage weight   No, I am fine. I will only be sight seeing   End up buying fuck tons of cosplay costumes   Pay more for luggage space on flight back          Is the the birth of an epic new maymay?!  Should I?   Do it. He's best boy.     Tales a shit but he actually looks cute. I would. That stubble and ponytail are great.    Probably, you know you're in trouble when it doesn't show up in another couple weeks.  They might not be inclined to help you until it gets more toward the 2+ month period. Asking them to have the post office look into it sooner probably isn't a bad idea though.  I'm still in the dark about my rsal package from february. Mandarake initiated a search with the post office, but haven't really heard much. I assume it's gone, I just hope I get the 6000 yen insurance or whatever.. It's still a net loss of like 2700 or so which sucks.        But  Karol  is best boy   Anyone wanna take my Wo preorder from BiJ off of my hands?    I dunno anon, most people don't buy large items when their on holiday  i plan on bringing £500 to spend on merc. Which should be enough for what i want.   Did you keep the boxes after you bought them? The size of the box will really limit what you can take back.   I'm told customs is a pain in ass as well.           finally got 1k in the bank   considering blowing it all on figures  Sorry for the minor blog but jesus christ what a slippery slope.      Think about the comming years and figures. If you buy now a lot of shit you maybe wont have enough room for things you woll enjoy more in the comming year. Only buy stuff which you really really like and think about it for a few days before ordering.      I'm glad I'm a picky motherfucker.     I've answered personal ads on craigslist for figure money more than once. You don't know the real struggle.     If I were a cute gril, I'd have as many stds as figures.    safe some money for upcoming years. At least wait for wonfest for the time being       If I were a cute gril, I'd have as many stds as figures.  You could remove cute and you'd still have the same result. There are some desperate people looking for any female to fuck.     just blew $2,500 on a computer   grail pops up on manda   Is this hell?       spending 25k on a comp  What the fuck anon. A good one shouldn't cost more than a grand, tops.     He said 2.5k not 25K     I dunno anon, most people don't buy large items when their on holiday  i plan on bringing £500 to spend on merc. Which should be enough for what i want.   Did you keep the boxes after you bought them? The size of the box will really limit what you can take back.   I'm told security is a pain in ass as well.          muh 4k gaymin     2.5k on a PC   The fuck are you doing. A high tier one that will last you 5 years minimum (at which point you would only need to change the GPU) cost you 1.3k tops.    inb4 I got an Allienware!         Oh sorry, forgot to mention I live in Australia. The Land of Double-Priced Computer Parts.     See   My life really is hell.        Holy shit anon you just made my nose twitch     I automatically typed 25k and meant anime dollars, sorry.  My condolences.       My condolences.      Th-Thanks.    <span>youtube.com/watch?v=w5KRawOXy4U  [ ]   Oh come on, it's not that expensive. You way over future proofed if the specs were actually worth that much.   Amakuni Muramasa or Hestia?    I also bought an expensive as fuck monitor for all my anime needs.      noice      Hestia is FoTM everyone will forget by the end of the year, Momohime is guarantied to stay popular just like she has been for years and her figure will most likely skyrocket after release just like the last one. Your choice in the end though.      Surprisingly enough, that was quite interesting.    What do you currently have in the mail, or is just about to ship?     Absolutely nothing because of delays again.    Day 1 PO     Instant pre-order.     preorder starts tomorrow when the final episode of UBW anime airs.    Any word if this is exclusive or not yet?     not chloe  Why     It's Aniplex+Stronger, which means it's exclusive.     How come Stronger is releasing prototypes and then the painted version so fast yet other manufactures can take year. That Rin was announced just a month ago, it can't get faster than that.     Aniplex+Stronger   What do you think.           Fuck that spin-off piece of shit. I want an actual Illya scale, not magical girl nonsense which is all we're getting that to that shit.     figma Snake figma The Thinker figma Criminal/figfix Conan Cu-poche Hibiki Ganaha Cu-poche Dark Magician Girl         Literally whom?      part of me wanted to believe     All three with SAL, so won't see any of them for another week or so.     That's not bad if you live in USA as your local retailers will have her for cheaper than BiJ/NY.   If you live in  Mexico  like me then you're fucked since 90% of those figures aren't available here from any USA store or if it is they charge ridiculous shipping fees. I talking about shit like 7k for a fucking 1/8 that weights 1kg.      Tell me experienced buy fags, I want the following.   a girl dressed in gothic lolita fashion   not a "stick in the mud" personality   from a somewhat decent anime   Ever since I played no more heroes 2 when I fought Margaret Moonlight I had a bit of an obsession with the fashion, and I want me a statue or a somewhat decent figure of one.  My problem is none of pic related exist and most characters I've seen seem just boring, only one that got my interest up was kurumi tokisaki from date a live, but one problem   only in stock brand new is her sexy kotobukiya statue   The hair cover thing is cute but the statue I want of her is long out of stock, I actually don't want anything sexy I just want something respectable, anyone willing to help find a thing that isn't from china or isn't a heavily marked up second hand thing?  As for what I got myself recently just mp-10 convoy, figma snake, bishujo psylocke x force costume (impulse purchase I kinda regret, gonna stack her at the rear of my collection) and unite warriors superion.  I might be a guy but seeing something like this on my bed side would just be nice, for once something refined as opposed to robots, manly men or overly sexy characters.  Anyone willing to help a guy who has no idea?                     You already asked, everyone already told you Hestia a shit. Now stop.    Fuck off    D-style Burglary Dog some pre-owned Ymir fig     Read guide. Check tags on mfc for whatever you are looking for. Also read the guide.     Fuck tons of Alter figurines getting reissue.   So, are they declaring bankruptcy soon?      Which?     Why wouldn't they, it's easy money for them. Don't have to pay for a new sculpt, just reuse old molds.    I was just asking for help, but ok, I get it.  I should of guessed too many stuck up princesses are here, I just thought someone might like to help a guy choose something other than what a friend suggest.  I'll just go do what my friends suggest and get me that kotobukiya hestia, thanks.   Links not working, where I am is blocking it and its honestly quite annoying, but thanks, I'll read the guide in 2 months time when I'm back in australia, hopefully our government doesn't censor this place, where else can I get hands on user experiences, youtube sucks and photos without commentary suck.  I do thank you personally though, its common sense to read the guide but its just not working, nor is facebook  or reddit, think the hotel where I am went over kill with the internet filter .  I should of mentioned it first I suppose but I guess I thought people are nicer on /a/, first guy shown me this place's true colors, I'll be gone now so feel free to make fun of me, cheers                Or they could ruin shit in re-release like with Shizuo and Izaya     Horizon Kazuno, Dress Code Saber, Suguha's sugus.   Just to name a few.      You sound like you belong to reddit.    Go back to your hugbox fag.     friends   Hestia   facebook   reddit  This is an 18+ website.          Here we go.    I don't understand the Gisen Yagyu re-release since I saw her going for 3500 yen     I should of guessed too many stuck up princesses are here   I guess I thought people are nicer on /a/      Still no Yoko rerelease.     titty imouto getting re-release   Nice.       no KnK Aozaki re-release   Ill get her and Elizabeth alter someday     Recently got half of my shit out of storage. I need more shelves to accommodate figs, artbooks, DVD/BD and Manga    that butt   I am tempted.     This isn't actually official, the figsoku blog owner noticed that Amiami updated their products and "possibly leaked" upcoming Alter re-releases. Some of these don't make any sense, so I'm not sure if it's anything to go by. I wouldn't get your hopes up. But like literally none of this shit is rare or even in a huge demand,    Subscribed.     webcam  Reee.    So...much...meat.   Those colors are really nice.    I like the teal theme.    Got to skype with family somehow; had to dust off an old one.   Preordered. I'm not passing up the opportunity to buy another Momohime. It will be rare on the aftermarket regardless.   The majority of them are on Amiami as re-releases right now. Actually, now that I think of it, the missing ones are probably because they are male characters and I was looking at the bishoujo section.    I tried to downvote you because I thought for sure with a shitpost like this I must be on Reddit.    Don't trust promo shots. they are carefully lit and have been mangled through lightroom.     Aniplex and their jewpricing can fuck off, I'll wait for GSC or Alter.     Shit figures getting re-released.   That's the only re-release that I want.  Another anon was saying that the only reason why they haven't re-released it was that they probably lost or destroyed the original mold.         The rerelease is scheduled for July. These are just shelf warming overstocks that they likely found in a warehouse somewhere collecting dust.  Almost all of these figures don't even sell at these prices A/B preowned.       Nadeko and that SAO chick are dirt cheap as is. Why would they re-release them?     Minus in comfy-points for the following:  Uncomfy desk Uncomfy chair Shitty mouse Only one small monitor Facing windows Flip phone KLKShit Mouse pad being way too small No apparent media buttons on your keyboard Being a mechafag  In conclusion; pretty uncomfy.   At least you have a 3DS.                     Minus in comfy-points for the following:   Uncomfy desk  Desk is very comfy for me  Uncomfy chair  Just because your fat ass won't fit in it  Shitty mouse  Gets the job done  Only one small monitor  Point taken   Facing windows  nowhere else to put  Flip phone  runs android, makes calls, decent 16mp camera  KLKShit  saved anime  Mouse pad being way too small  it is indeed  No apparent media buttons on your keyboard  why would I need that?  Being a mechafag  Eva aren't mecha, they are human angel hybrids  In conclusion; pretty uncomfy.   At least you have a 3DS.  I have two of them                            No apparent media buttons on your keyboard  Why would anyone want that?      No apparent media buttons on your keyboard   owning a shitty keyboard with media buttons       You're pathetic. Quit posting your shitty room and go back to /v/.     Your room wasn't passable on /v/ and it's double not relevant here. Fuck off.     Just in case I decide to rate someone else's setup in the future; this isn't me.    Only got picco ones and they're adorable.  Pure neemo seems kinda hit and miss as far as apperance goes. In that sense they're like RAHs. But they are barely more expensive than a scale figure, so it's not so bad.  They got rooted hair, but since you're buying her for the character that shouldn't be a problem.         Post a picture. I find most of them creepy but some are fine.    Not enough meat.       How the fuck did this go so fast?   Preorder hard as fuck    because best girl   Does anyone have a photo of her pantsu?    you dirty bastard      What is mfc?     Miu is a sexy gal.      Relatively inexpensive and good quality figure of a main character from a popular series.   Man I love witch hats.  Most of my Blame! reprints came today, Amazon decided to ship one separately for some reason. They look amazing, bigger than I expected too. Chaika is there for scale.    Buy only merch of your best girl   Who cards here   you already posted that before    pls show more, and what's the size compared to the jojonium ?    IMO that looks much better than the cu-poche hibiki. The joints are more concealed    It's a ruse. BiJ is literally just one random French guy trying to operate a warehouse out of Japan. At least N-Y has 11 employees.    What if my best girl is Miku?   So MF's Venera got delayed recently, which got me thinking; will their Plamya-sama also get delayed? There are a number of differences between them in terms of marketing, which I have to assume will play a part in deciding whether or not the latter will also be delayed.  Plamya-sama was exclusive to the GSC store, and she had a limited window for pre-orders, Venera did not have either of those things going for her.  Can someone with more experience lend me their thoughts?        You're fucked    I remember some fag here saying Mercedes was going to be rereleased. WELL?    7 days   7 volumes   Tonight, the forgotten fight on.

In related news, Jien Mei is confirmed to be voiced by KanaHana ruining my dreams of having HnM be voiced by her.  Also for some reason, they don't have a picture of her, just a silhouette with a coming soon.  This probably doesn't mean the crew is already having budget problems where they can't even post a damn drawing.        Right. Already did that. Now to where we left off.                          33 volumes   1 week  I got this shit.        I'd reccomend doing it in three days 1 to 12/13 12 to 24 24 to 33          Hm. I'll try. But why three parts?     To avoid burning yourself out as each one could serve as a climax for their respective third. Also, the anime is three cours.  I honestly just read it all in one go but that's just me.       Same here.         Not Hinowa.   Ushio will never understand how tsundere work.        It's poster material.          That fucking scene. You know that He didn't forget about him, yet it's still poweful.                        Ushio sure gets hit a lot by the women of this manga.                                                Here we go.      Not my Weaponfu!                                                                           omoshiroi      Yaa, gomen gomen!        TADIMA     Gashunk!   HANASE!  M-MASAKA!    D-Dame.   TEME KONO YARO   HAYAI!  BAKANA!   every time   BAKA HENTAI!   fuck spiders   Tuskete!    Fucking Niggers.     Did that last one hit him in the eye?    why you gotta do this s4s-kun  why      yes    Yes.    Black people, man.    Why would you ever kill an elephant. Why don't you just leave it do its own thing. Eat some fucking plants, shit a lot. What the fuck man.    Is that Serena Williams?   To sell the tusks.    this one is just sad     Why would you ever kill an elephant.  sometimes they get to close to villages and destroy their crops or its for their ivory     gotta gi me som ivory mayne.   Ittekimaaasu!  K-kaa-san, Yamete kudasai.      That's depressing.  Fuck       this was the saddest shit ever in this movie    what the fuck's wrong with it?    Chinks will pay out the ass for magic dick tusk magic pills.  And y'know, elephants do have a nasty habit of stomping on farmland and eating villagers crops.      yes  no      food and safety bull elephants regularly kill people and destroy crops     j-just run pleeease    fuck you    never gets old    This. Chinks pay a fucking huge amount of money for this shit. Same goes for turtles from Madagascar.    Lion cub broke its back while hunting with its mom. Lioness left it to die.    I'm Crimean rivers here.    Somehow I didn't find it as bad as that sloth program they advertised with "babies getting pajamas! So cute!"  The weaker baby dies and then the second one refuses to eat or move and dies. Sloths just fucking give up. Like there's a video on youtube of a cougar chasing a sloth and the sloth just closes its eyes in pain and lets go.

You don't take chances with hippos.    If you're hunting, don't you want to make sure it's dead? I hate this stupid "don't hurt animals!" mentality where everybody assumes they're just killing because they can.     not FROG GUNDAMU, IKIMASU!

Based Hippos    This, hippos are scary    Hippos are  big  animals    It's not like the hippos are killing anything that matters.      yes goyim. It is the dumb brown peoples who are your real enemy!       elephants regularly kill people  [citation needed]   I think you're mistaking elephants for hippos.       You saying humans don't matter? How pro-hippo can you be?       Where were humans mentioned? I thought we were talking about Africans?      black screen, oh oh I dont want to play that webm    There's baby goats and dolphin, trust me.      African nigger reporting in.  Hippos need overkill.  They WILL fight to the very end.  They're insanely tough creatures, even on the brink of death.  You know how white people call brave people "lions"?  Well in much of Africa, brave people were called "Hippos"               That one of the dog chasing the deer   That's all swell and nice, but giving a teeny bit of a distorted view of reality. 99.999999% of the time things don't work out like that. For every 1 dog and monkey pair of buddies, there's 5,000,000,000 wildebeest that are eviscerated and literally eaten alive by hyena.        That's how our ancestors hunted long long ago too.

How they live their lives has worked well for millions of years and as tragic as it may be that lion cub in death will give life back to something else.

It'd be more liberal to intervene you dumbshit     fucking why what the fuck is this obvious the bizon wanted to get away couldn't he get out the fucking way jesus man herbivores are fucking retarded        All that movement open the wound so wide its entire insides spilled out.

So how much money does random wild animal B deserve to keep it alive instead of being random wild animal T's lunch? Small things in reserves work, but treating something serious that will pull the animal out of any social contact for weeks or months will fuck it over indefinitely unless you pump even more money into reconditioning areas. A guy who's good with a camera isn't the person to rely on for those facilities.    instead of ramming the other bison it could've also just barreled through the wolf pack.

That should shut the rats down without pain or realisation.        That should shut the rats down without pain or realisation.   Should being the operative word.  Those rodents are flipping the fuck out when the gas starts kicking in.        Pretend  This is, in all reasonable likelihood, exactly what he's doing.   I bet the guy used something like nitrogen or CO2. That should shut the rats down without pain or realisation.  I don't know about nitrogen, but I know he didn't use CO2. I've seen that done before, and it is nowhere near as quick. CO2 'euthanasia' is just slowly suffocating the rats to death.         Those rodents are flipping the fuck out when the gas starts kicking in.  Whatever he is doing is an extremely quick and relatively humane way to kill your feeder animals.

See: <br/>       it's been at least 200,000 years since the homo sapien came into being and the industrial revolution was about 200 years ago (and domestic farming a lot longer before that), there is no excuse for this shit, they're niggers and that's why they're still hunting their food with fucking sticks.     I would have guessed carbon monoxide, but then I remembered that it's essentially impossible to obtain without a laboratory license.    That's a fucking retarded stereotype. It shows you're literally incapable of thinking for yourself, and instead humor the ramblings of butthurt euroscum that often like to claim "murrica don't know shit about the rest of the world", yeah...like you? No other country gives a fuck about another countries politics religion, and history. Why is it when an american seems even slightly uninformed about worldwide news (as if watching the news is brag-worthy in the first place), he's automatically labeled a "murrican".  Americans do know quite a lot about other countries.   We just don't give a fuck about them, or you for that matter - I find that often more times than not, whatever eurofaggot it is that finds himself claiming murricans don't know shit about other countries, and that they only care about murrica "because muh freedums" - are actually the arrogant ones, who either 1.) know jack shit about america, believing only the ridiculous bullshit they see on their mainstream news outlets, or 2.) know next to jack shit about whatever country in question it is they're claiming the american doesn't know anything about, making themselves out to be a hypocrite in the process.  Everyone knows a lot about america because of it's fucking reputation, what it's done, what it has, how far it's advanced (and failed for that matter), so of fucking course people are going to know more about america than other countries. I;E - China, Russia, Japan and Australia           You just need 5% CO2 concentration in the atmosphere for it to become dangerous to humans (thanks, the pirated epub of the Martian is just finished), and that balloon is definitely a lot more than 5% of the volume of that container.  I don't think it's suffocation necessarily, it's CO2 poisoning. Which might be the same as suffocation.           I've done animal colony work in the research lab before, and what he's doing is probably a much less humane version of what I do. You're supposed to use CO2 and in a specific amount of liters per minute so that they fall unconscious quickly. That guy's just putting them through a slow death through asphyxiation.          See that's the thing. With CO2 it is suffocation. With CO it's poisoning. That's why a favorite suicide method is inhalation of CO, as it's totally painless and lacks that gasping/terror of CO2 suffocation.    yeah the universe is inherently corrupt, but what can you do about it besides cry yourself at night and drown it with anime?    what, are you too good for spears?

I'm watching this anime at the moment. Its been really good so far. What is your opinion on it?   By its eleventh expansion pack, the massively multiplayer online role-playing game Elder Tale has become a global success, having a following of millions of players. However, during the release of its twelfth expansion pack: Novasphere Pioneers, thirty thousand Japanese gamers who are all logged on at the time of the update, suddenly find themselves transported inside the game world and donning their in-game avatars. In the midst of the event, a socially awkward gamer called Shiroe along with his friends Naotsugu and Akatsuki decide to team up so that they may face this world which has now become their reality along with the challenges which lie ahead.      first season was good second season was meh third season never     It was nice. Unlike SAO that pacing and connection between episodes are... none. Most retarded pacing ever seen.  Scrub arc is sleep inducing.   I think the 2nd season sucks balls  Also try not to make yourself too obvious newfriend. Welcome to /a/.      So is Akatsuki arc. Though there are once in a while some interesting scenes thrown in, like the problem with the fluff text.      Why the fuck did you post the synopsis? You really think nobody here has heard of it before?  So many newfags these days.     No shit it's summer. There's been clueless newfags at least since May.     Synopsis   I thought it was spoiler for the next LN or something. Why would you do that? For what purpose?      2nd season is just. fucking. awful.    Second season was okay Third season was disappointing The opening still good  DATABASE        Third season  Are you from the future?     No Third season for me is after they've got the gold from that rich npc guy.    Is this some new kind of troll?  Because I'm not getting it.     I personally loved both scrub quests.  That adventuring was just so comfy.        Every source says it's second season/series   I'm sooo cool and different so I will call it third season because I'm so cool and different and progressive   God I fucking hate retards like you.        unlike SAO  But it's the other way around, you fucking retard.     Thinking that people on /a/ won't know your show  How new are you   Would you be friends with a robot, /a/?  Depends on what you mean by robot. To me, anything that imitates human behavior on a sufficiently advanced level seizes to be a robot and becomes a(n artificial) human.   I don't think they'd want to be friends with me, since the moment sufficiently advanced robots become a reality, I'm selling a kidney to buy a sexbot.   I guess the proper terms for machines like pic related or Sammy would be Cyborg? They're almost indistinguishable from humans in both of the series.  Maybe they would. While giving you sex at the same time.        the proper terms for machines like pic related or Sammy would be Cyborg?  Yes, but the proper term hides the fact that it's basically the same as us as far as behavior in concerned. There may even be some slight differences in character, but I wouldn't say "my dear humans and autists" either. They are not actual humans*, and they don't look like humans from the inside, but calling them anything but humans is bound to lead to prejudice and discrimination.  * though I would like to have an argument on what a human actually is, because to me that blurry definition could easily be altered to include cyborgs and other beings.          It's not about imitating human behavior on a superficial level though, since that can be achieved with enough effort while still not actually approaching the inner workings of a conscious mind, it's about emulating cognitive processes.   A stupid and obviously artificial even to a casual observer intelligence can be a lot closer to a sentient being than something meticulously designed solely to fool people with no regard of giving it true consciousness.        That's illegal, and there is no friendship there.     Nothing in that rule that says that two friends can't go and have a nice cup of coffee or a romantic piano session together.   ITT: Retarded permavirgins.   What le fuck    I'm sure that is what most peopkle would actually say IRL if AI could equal or surpass the human level.  "Anon, your cute why don't you have a gf?"

In an imoni kai, people cook stew in a huge pot and then give portion sizes to people, so I'm pretty sure he'd give quantity aside from quality.    True. People just can't take that Italian pretty boy jobber seriously anymore. He's coming the comic relief/running gag of this manga.     Curry doesn't want to see his waifu's stall do badly  are you referring to Alice ? or Jun If it's Jun sorry mate he's been sonzoned      You will never finish your backlog     You might have ADD      browsing 4chan   not being able to spot an obviously satirical post      maybe. I can't even read entire threads anymore, sometimes.  what can you do      You're right - because I don't have a backlog.    I know. That's why I deleted it.   Why are his hands and arms wrapped.   He loses his balance if he shaves them anon    but why is Sakura wheezing and sweating everywhere? Is she dying or something    Remember when Tsunade warned him that applying wind to the Rasengan would damage his arm? This is what happens after 100 crazy Rasengans plus this too:     That was before he could throw it.    yeah, how the hell will they tie this all up in one chapter? </blockquote>]
